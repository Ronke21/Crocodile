<text>The New York Review of Books (or NYREV or NYRB) is a semi-monthly magazine with articles on literature, culture, economics, science and current affairs. Published in New York City, it is inspired by the idea that the discussion of important books is an indispensable literary activity. &quot;Esquire&quot; called it &quot;the premier literary-intellectual magazine in the English language.&quot; In 1970, writer Tom Wolfe described it as &quot;the chief theoretical organ of Radical Chic&quot;.

The &quot;Review&quot; publishes long-form reviews and essays, often by well-known writers, original poetry, and has letters and personals advertising sections that had attracted critical comment. In 1979 the magazine founded the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, which soon became independent. In 1990 it founded an Italian edition, &quot;la Rivista dei Libri&quot;, published until 2010. The &quot;Review&quot; has a book publishing division, established in 1999, called New York Review Books, which publishes reprints of classics, as well as collections and children&#x27;s books. Since 2010, the journal has hosted a blog written by its contributors. The &quot;Review&quot; celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2013. A Martin Scorsese film called &quot;The 50 Year Argument&quot; documents the history and influence of the paper over its first half century.

Robert B. Silvers and Barbara Epstein edited the paper together from its founding in 1963 until Epstein&#x27;s death in 2006. From then until his death in 2017, Silvers was the sole editor. Ian Buruma became editor in September 2017 and left the post in September 2018. Gabriel Winslow-Yost and Emily Greenhouse became co-editors in February 2019; in February 2021 Greenhouse was made editor.

==History and description==

===Early years===
&quot;The New York Review&quot; was founded by Robert B. Silvers and Barbara Epstein, together with publisher A. Whitney Ellsworth and writer Elizabeth Hardwick. They were backed and encouraged by Epstein&#x27;s husband, Jason Epstein, a vice president at Random House and editor of Vintage Books, and Hardwick&#x27;s husband, poet Robert Lowell. In 1959 Hardwick had published an essay, &quot;The Decline of Book Reviewing&quot;, in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, where Silvers was then an editor, in a special issue that he edited called &quot;Writing in America&quot;. Her essay was an indictment of American book reviews of the time, &quot;light, little article[s]&quot; that she decried as &quot;lobotomized&quot;, passionless praise and denounced as &quot;blandly, respectfully denying whatever vivacious interest there might be in books or in literary matters generally.&quot; The group was inspired to found a new magazine to publish thoughtful, probing, lively reviews featuring what Hardwick called &quot;the unusual, the difficult, the lengthy, the intransigent, and above all, the &quot;interesting&quot;&quot;.

During the 1962–63 New York City newspaper strike, when &quot;The New York Times&quot; and several other newspapers suspended publication, Hardwick, Lowell and the Epsteins seized the chance to establish the sort of vigorous book review that Hardwick had imagined. Jason Epstein knew that book publishers would advertise their books in the new publication, since they had no other outlet for promoting new books. The group turned to the Epsteins&#x27; friend Silvers, who had been an editor at &quot;The Paris Review&quot; and was still at &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, to edit the publication, and Silvers asked Barbara Epstein to co-edit with him. She was known as the editor at Doubleday of Anne Frank&#x27;s &quot;Diary of a Young Girl&quot;, among other books, and then worked at Dutton, McGraw-Hill and &quot;The Partisan Review&quot;. Silvers and Epstein sent books to &quot;the writers we knew and admired most. ... We asked for three thousand words in three weeks in order to show what a book review should be, and practically everyone came through. No one mentioned money.&quot; The first issue of the &quot;Review&quot; was published on February 1, 1963, and sold out its printing of 100,000 copies. It prompted nearly 1,000 letters to the editors asking for the &quot;Review&quot; to continue. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it &quot;surely the best first issue of any magazine ever.&quot;

&quot;Salon&quot; later commented that the list of contributors in the first issue &quot;represented a &#x27;shock and awe&#x27; demonstration of the intellectual firepower available for deployment in mid-century America, and, almost equally impressive, of the art of editorial networking and jawboning. This was the party everyone who was anyone wanted to attend, the Black and White Ball of the critical elite.&quot; The &quot;Review&quot; &quot;announced the arrival of a particular sensibility ... the engaged, literary, post-war progressive intellectual, who was concerned with civil rights and feminism as well as fiction and poetry and theater. The first issue projected &quot;a confidence in the unquestioned rightness of the liberal consensus, in the centrality of literature and its power to convey meaning, in the solubility of our problems through the application of intelligence and good will, and in the coherence and clear hierarchy of the intellectual world&quot;. After the success of the first issue, the editors assembled a second issue to demonstrate that &quot;the &quot;Review&quot; was not a one-shot affair&quot;. The founders then collected investments from a circle of friends and acquaintances, and Ellsworth joined as publisher. The &quot;Review&quot; began regular biweekly publication in November 1963.
Silvers said of the editors&#x27; philosophy, that &quot;there was no subject we couldn&#x27;t deal with. And if there was no book [on a subject], we would deal with it anyway. We tried hard to avoid books that were simply competent rehearsals of familiar subjects, and we hoped to find books that would establish something fresh, something original.&quot; In particular, &quot;We felt you had to have a political analysis of the nature of power in America – who had it, who was affected&quot;. The editors also shared an &quot;intense admiration for wonderful writers&quot;. But, Silvers noted, it is a mystery whether &quot;reviews have a calculable political and social impact&quot; or will even gain attention: &quot;You mustn&#x27;t think too much about influence – if you find something interesting yourself, that should be enough.&quot; Well-known writers were willing to contribute articles for the initial issues of the &quot;Review&quot; without pay because it offered them a chance to write a new kind of book review. As Mark Gevisser explained: &quot;The essays ... made the book review form not just a report on the book and a judgment of the book, but an essay in itself. And that, I think, startled everyone – that a book review could be exciting in that way, could be provocative in that way.&quot; Early issues included articles by such writers as Hardwick, Lowell, Jason Epstein, Hannah Arendt, W. H. Auden, Saul Bellow, John Berryman, Truman Capote, Paul Goodman, Lillian Hellman, Irving Howe, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Lewis, Dwight Macdonald, Norman Mailer, Mary McCarthy, Norman Podhoretz, Philip Rahv, Adrienne Rich, Susan Sontag, William Styron, Gore Vidal, Robert Penn Warren and Edmund Wilson. The &quot;Review&quot; pointedly published interviews with European political dissidents, including Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Andrei Sakharov and Václav Havel.

===Since 1979===
During the year-long lockout at &quot;The Times&quot; in London in 1979, the &quot;Review&quot; founded a daughter publication, the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;. For the first six months this journal appeared as an insert in the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;, but it became an independent publication in 1980. In 1990 the &quot;Review&quot; founded an Italian edition, &quot;la Rivista dei Libri.&quot; It was published for two decades until May 2010.

For over 40 years, Silvers and Epstein edited the &quot;Review&quot; together. In 1984, Silvers, Epstein and their partners sold the &quot;Review&quot; to publisher Rea S. Hederman, who still owns the paper, but the two continued as its editors. In 2006, Epstein died of cancer at the age of 77. In awarding to Epstein and Silvers its 2006 Literarian Award for Outstanding Service to the American Literary Community, the National Book Foundation stated: &quot;With &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, Robert Silvers and Barbara Epstein raised book reviewing to an art and made the discussion of books a lively, provocative and intellectual activity.&quot;

After Epstein&#x27;s death, Silvers was the sole editor until his own death in 2017. Asked about who might succeed him as editor, Silvers told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;I can think of several people who would be marvelous editors. Some of them work here, some used to work here, and some are just people we know. I think they would put out a terrific paper, but it would be different.&quot; In 2008, the &quot;Review&quot; celebrated its 45th anniversary with a panel discussion at the New York Public Library, moderated by Silvers, discussing &quot;What Happens Now&quot; in the United States after the 2008 election of Barack Obama as president. Panelists included &quot;Review&quot; contributors such as Joan Didion, Garry Wills, novelist and literary critic Darryl Pinckney, political commentator Michael Tomasky, and Columbia University professor and contributor Andrew Delbanco. The 45th anniversary edition of the &quot;Review&quot; (November 20, 2008) began with a posthumous piece by Edmund Wilson, who wrote for the paper&#x27;s first issue in 1963.
In 2008, the paper moved its headquarters from Midtown Manhattan to 435 Hudson Street located in the West Village. In 2010, it launched a blog section of its website that &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;lively and opinionated&quot;, and it hosts podcasts. Asked in 2013 how social media might affect the subject matter of the &quot;Review&quot;, Silvers commented: &quot;I might imagine [a] witty, aphoristic, almost Oscar Wildean [anthology of] remarks, drawn from the millions and millions of tweets. Or from comments that follow on blogs. ... Facebook is a medium in which privacy is, or at least is thought to be, in some way crucial. ... And so there seems a resistance to intrusive criticism. We seem at the edge of a vast, expanding ocean of words ... growing without any critical perspective whatever being brought to bear on it. To me, as an editor, that seems an enormous absence.&quot;

&quot;The Review&quot; began a year-long celebration of its 50th anniversary with a presentation by Silvers and several contributors at The Town Hall in New York City in February 2013. Other events included a program at the New York Public Library in April, called &quot;Literary Journalism: A Discussion&quot;, focusing on the editorial process at the &quot;Review&quot; and a reception in November at the Frick Collection. During the year, Martin Scorsese filmed a documentary about the history and influence of the &quot;Review&quot;, and the debates that it has spawned, titled &quot;The 50 Year Argument&quot;, which premiered in June 2014 at the Sheffield Doc/Fest in England. It was later seen at various film festivals, on BBC television and on HBO in the US. Asked how he maintained his &quot;level of meticulousness and determination&quot; after 50 years, Silvers said that the &quot;Review&quot; &quot;was and is a unique opportunity ... to do what one wants on anything in the world. Now, that is given to hardly any editor, anywhere, anytime. There are no strictures, no limits. Nobody saying you can&#x27;t do something. No subject, no theme, no idea that can&#x27;t be addressed in-depth. ... Whatever work is involved is minor compared to the opportunity.&quot; A special 50th anniversary issue was dated November 7, 2013. Silvers said: 
An independent, critical voice on politics, literature, science, and the arts seems as much needed today as it was when Barbara Epstein and I put out the first edition of the &quot;New York Review&quot; fifty years ago – perhaps even more so. Electronic forms of communication grow rapidly in every field of life but many of their effects on culture remain obscure and in need of new kinds of critical scrutiny. That will be a central concern of the &quot;Review&quot; for the years to come.

Ian Buruma, who had been a regular contributor to the &quot;Review&quot; since 1985, became editor in September 2017. He left the position in September 2018 after backlash over publishing an essay by Jian Ghomeshi, who has been accused by 20 women of sexual assault, and defending the publication in an interview with &quot;Slate&quot; magazine. The &quot;Review&quot; stated that it did not follow its &quot;usual editorial practices&quot;, as the essay &quot;was shown to only one male editor during the editing process&quot;, and that Buruma&#x27;s statement to &quot;Slate&quot; about the staff of the &quot;Review&quot; &quot;did not accurately represent their views&quot;. Gabriel Winslow-Yost (formerly a senior editor at the &quot;Review&quot;) and Emily Greenhouse (formerly the managing editor of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and earlier an editorial assistant at the &quot;Review&quot;) were named co-editors in February 2019; Daniel Mendelsohn, a longtime &quot;Review&quot; contributor, was named to the new position of &quot;editor at large&quot;. In February 2021, Greenhouse was made editor of the &quot;Review&quot;, while Winslow-Yost became a senior editor.

===Description===
The &quot;Review&quot; has been described as a &quot;kind of magazine ... in which the most interesting and qualified minds of our time would discuss current books and issues in depth ... a literary and critical journal based on the assumption that the discussion of important books was itself an indispensable literary activity.&quot; Each issue includes a broad range of subject matter, including &quot;articles on art, science, politics and literature.&quot; Early on, the editors decided that the &quot;Review&quot; would &quot;be interested in everything ... no subject would be excluded. Someone is writing a piece about Nascar racing for us; another is working on Veronese.&quot; The &quot;Review&quot; has focused, however, on political topics; as Silvers commented in 2004: &quot;The pieces we have published by such writers as Brian Urquhart, Thomas Powers, Mark Danner and Ronald Dworkin have been reactions to a genuine crisis concerning American destructiveness, American relations with its allies, American protections of its traditions of liberties. ... The aura of patriotic defiance cultivated by the [Bush] Administration, in a fearful atmosphere, had the effect of muffling dissent.&quot; Silvers told &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;The great political issues of power and its abuses have always been natural questions for us.&quot;

&quot;The Nation&quot; gave its view of the political focus of the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; in 2004:
The Review took a vocal role in contesting the Vietnam War. ... Around 1970, a sturdy liberalism began to supplant left-wing radicalism at the paper. As Philip Nobile observed in ... 1974 ... the &quot;Review&quot; returned to its roots and became &quot;a literary magazine on the British nineteenth-century model, which would mix politics and literature in a tough but gentlemanly fashion.&quot; ... The publication has always been erudite and authoritative – and because of its analytical rigor and seriousness, frequently essential – but it hasn&#x27;t always been lively, pungent and readable. ... But the election of George W. Bush, combined with the furies of 9/11, jolted the editors. Since 2001, the Review&#x27;s temperature has risen and its political outlook has sharpened. ... Prominent [writers for] the Review ... charged into battle not only against the White House but against the lethargic press corps and the &quot;liberal hawk&quot; intellectuals. ... In stark contrast to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; ... or &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; ..., the &quot;Review&quot; opposed the Iraq War in a voice that was remarkably consistent and unified.

Over the years, the &quot;Review&quot; has featured reviews and articles by such international writers and intellectuals, in addition to those already noted, as Timothy Garton Ash, Margaret Atwood, Russell Baker, Saul Bellow, Isaiah Berlin, Harold Bloom, Joseph Brodsky, Ian Buruma, Noam Chomsky, J. M. Coetzee, Frederick Crews, Ronald Dworkin, John Kenneth Galbraith, Masha Gessen, Nadine Gordimer, Stephen Jay Gould, Christopher Hitchens, Tim Judah, Murray Kempton, Paul Krugman, Richard Lewontin, Perry Link, Alison Lurie, Peter Medawar, Daniel Mendelsohn, Bill Moyers, Vladimir Nabokov, Ralph Nader, V. S. Naipaul, Peter G. Peterson, Samantha Power, Nathaniel Rich, Felix Rohatyn, Jean-Paul Sartre, John Searle, Zadie Smith, Timothy Snyder, George Soros, I. F. Stone, Desmond Tutu, John Updike, Derek Walcott, Steven Weinberg, Garry Wills and Tony Judt. According to the National Book Foundation: &quot;From Mary McCarthy and Edmund Wilson to Gore Vidal and Joan Didion, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; has consistently employed the liveliest minds in America to think about, write about, and debate books and the issues they raise.&quot;

The &quot;Review&quot; also devotes space in most issues to poetry, and has featured the work of such poets as Robert Lowell, John Berryman, Ted Hughes, John Ashbery, Richard Wilbur, Seamus Heaney, Octavio Paz, and Czeslaw Milosz. For writers, the &quot;depth [of the articles], and the quality of the people writing for it, has made a &quot;Review&quot; byline a résumé definer. If one wishes to be thought of as a certain type of writer – of heft, style and a certain gravitas – a &quot;Review&quot; byline is pretty much the gold standard.&quot; In editing a piece, Silvers said that he asked himself &quot;if [the point in any sentence could] be clearer, while also respecting the writer&#x27;s voice and tone. You have to listen carefully to the tone of the writer&#x27;s prose and try to adapt to it, but only up to a point. [No change was made without the writers&#x27; permission.] ... Writers deserve the final word about their prose.&quot;

In addition to domestic matters, the &quot;Review&quot; covers issues of international concern. In the 1980s, a British commentator noted: &quot;In the 1960s [the &quot;Review&quot;] opposed American involvement in Vietnam; more recently it has taken a line mildly Keynesian in economics, pro-Israeli but Anti-Zionist, sceptical of Reagan&#x27;s Latin-American policy&quot;. The British newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; has described the &quot;Review&quot; as &quot;the only mainstream American publication to speak out consistently against the war in Iraq.&quot; On Middle East coverage, Silvers said, &quot;any serious criticism of Israeli policy will be seen by some as heresy, a form of betrayal. ... [M]uch of what we&#x27;ve published has come from some of the most respected and brilliant Israeli writers ... Amos Elon, Avishai Margalit, David Grossman, David Shulman, among them. What emerges from them is a sense that occupying land and people year after year can only lead to a sad and bad result.&quot;

Caricaturist David Levine illustrated &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; from 1963 to 2007, giving the paper a distinctive visual image. Levine died in 2009. John Updike, whom Levine drew many times, wrote: &quot;Besides offering us the delight of recognition, his drawings comfort us, in an exacerbated and potentially desperate age, with the sense of a watching presence, an eye informed by an intelligence that has not panicked, a comic art ready to encapsulate the latest apparitions of publicity as well as those historical devils who haunt our unease.&quot; Levine contributed more than 3,800 pen-and-ink caricatures of famous writers, artists and politicians for the publication. Silvers said: &quot;David combined acute political commentary with a certain kind of joke about the person. He was immensely sensitive to the smallest details – people&#x27;s shoulders, their feet, their elbows. He was able to find character in these details.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Levine&#x27;s illustrations as &quot;macro-headed, somberly expressive, astringently probing and hardly ever flattering caricatures of intellectuals and athletes, politicians and potentates&quot; that were &quot;replete with exaggeratedly bad haircuts, 5 o&#x27;clock shadows, ill-conceived mustaches and other grooming foibles ... to make the famous seem peculiar-looking in order to take them down a peg&quot;. In later years, illustrators for the &quot;Review&quot; included James Ferguson of &quot;Financial Times&quot;.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the &quot;lively literary disputes&quot; conducted in the &#x27;letters to the editor&#x27; column of the &quot;Review&quot; as &quot;the closest thing the intellectual world has to bare-knuckle boxing&quot;. In addition to reviews, interviews and articles, the paper features extensive advertising from publishers promoting newly published books. It also includes a popular &quot;personals&quot; section that &quot;share[s] a cultivated writing style&quot; with its articles. One lonely heart, author Jane Juska, documented the 63 replies to her personal ad in the &quot;Review&quot; with a 2003 memoir, &quot;A Round-Heeled Woman&quot;, that was adapted as a play. In &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Matt Schudel called the personal ads &quot;sometimes laughably highbrow&quot; and recalled that they were &quot;spoofed by Woody Allen in the movie &quot;Annie Hall&quot;&quot;.

Several of the magazine&#x27;s editorial assistants have become prominent in journalism, academia and literature, including Jean Strouse, Deborah Eisenberg, Mark Danner and A. O. Scott. Another former intern and a contributor to the &quot;Review&quot;, author Claire Messud, said: &quot;They&#x27;re incredibly generous about taking the time to go through things. So much of [business today] is about people doing things quickly, with haste. One of the first things to go out the window is a type of graciousness. ... There&#x27;s a whole sort of rhythm and tone of how they deal with people. I&#x27;m sure it was always rare. But it feels incredibly precious now.&quot; Still another, Sigrid Nunez, commented of the editors: &quot;You had these two people who were at the top of everything, who had no interest in anything except doing this amazing job. They were strangely without ego.&quot;

The &quot;Review&quot; has published, since 2009, the &quot;NYR Daily&quot;, which focuses on the news.

==Critical reaction==
&quot;The Washington Post&quot; calls the &quot;Review&quot; &quot;a journal of ideas that has helped define intellectual discourse in the English-speaking world for the past four decades. ... By publishing long, thoughtful articles on politics, books and culture, [the editors] defied trends toward glibness, superficiality and the cult of celebrity&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; praised the paper as &quot;one of the few venues in American life that takes ideas seriously. And it pays readers the ultimate compliment of assuming that we do too.&quot; &quot;Esquire&quot; termed it &quot;the most respected intellectual journal in the English language&quot; and &quot;the premier literary-intellectual magazine in the English language.&quot; Similarly, in a 2006 &quot;New York&quot; magazine feature, James Atlas stated: &quot;It&#x27;s an eclectic but impressive mix [of articles] that has made &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; the premier journal of the American intellectual elite&quot;. &quot;The Atlantic&quot; commented in 2011 that the &quot;Review&quot; is written with &quot;a freshness of perspective&quot;, and &quot;much of it shapes our most sophisticated public discourse.&quot; In celebrating the 35th birthday of the &quot;Review&quot; in 1998, &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented, &quot;The N.Y.R. gives off rogue intimations of being fun to put out. It hasn&#x27;t lost its sneaky nip of mischief&quot;.

In 2008, Britain&#x27;s &quot;The Guardian&quot; deemed the &quot;Review&quot; &quot;scholarly without being pedantic, scrupulous without being dry&quot;. The same newspaper wrote in 2004: 
The ... issues of the &quot;Review&quot; to date provide a history of the cultural life of the east coast since 1963. It manages to be ... serious with a fierce democratic edge. ... It is one of the last places in the English-speaking world that will publish long essays ... and possibly the very last to combine academic rigour – even the letters to the editor are footnoted – with great clarity of language. In &quot;New York&quot; magazine, in February 2011, Oliver Sacks stated that the &quot;Review&quot; is &quot;one of the great institutions of intellectual life here or anywhere.&quot; In 2012, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the &quot;Review&quot; as &quot;elegant, well mannered, immensely learned, a little formal at times, obsessive about clarity and factual correctness and passionately interested in human rights and the way governments violate them.&quot;

Throughout its history, the &quot;Review&quot; has been known generally as a left-liberal journal, what Tom Wolfe called &quot;the chief theoretical organ of Radical Chic&quot;. A 1997 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, however, accused the paper of having become &quot;establishmentarian&quot;. The paper has, perhaps, had its most effective voice in wartime. According to a 2004 feature in &quot;The Nation&quot;,
One suspects they yearn for the day when they can return to their normal publishing routine – that gentlemanly pastiche of philosophy, art, classical music, photography, German and Russian history, East European politics, literary fiction – unencumbered by political duties of a confrontational or oppositional nature. That day has not yet arrived. If and when it does, let it be said that the editors met the challenges of the post-9/11 era in a way that most other leading American publications did not, and that &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; ... was there when we needed it most.

Sometimes accused of insularity, the &quot;Review&quot; has been called &quot;The New York Review of Each Other&#x27;s Books&quot;. Philip Nobile expressed a mordant criticism along these lines in his book &quot;Intellectual Skywriting: Literary Politics and the New York Review of Books&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; characterized such accusations as &quot;sour grapes&quot;. Phillip Lopate commented, in 2017, that Silvers &quot;regarded his contributors as worthy authors, and so why punish them by neglecting their latest work?&quot;. In 2008, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote, &quot;the pages of the 45th anniversary issue, in fact, reveal the actuality of [the paper&#x27;s] willfully panoramic view&quot;.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the 2013 50th Anniversary issue &quot;gaudy with intellectual firepower. Four Nobel Laureates have bylines. US Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer muses on reading Proust. There&#x27;s the transcript of a long-lost lecture by T. S. Eliot.&quot; In 2014, Rachel Cooke wrote in &quot;The Observer&quot; of a recent issue: &quot;The offer of such an embarrassment of riches is wholly amazing in a world where print journalism increasingly operates in the most threadbare of circumstances&quot;. &quot;America&quot; magazine echoed Zoë Heller&#x27;s words about the &quot;Review&quot;: &quot;I like it because it educates me.&quot; Lopate adds that the &quot;Review&quot; &quot;was and is the standard bearer for American intellectual life: a unique repository of thoughtful discourse, unrepentantly highbrow, in a culture increasingly given to dumbing down.&quot; Timothy Noah of &quot;Politico&quot; called it &quot;the country&#x27;s best and most influential literary journal. ... It&#x27;s hard to imagine that Hardwick ... would complain today that book reviewing is too polite.&quot;

== Book-publishing arm ==
The book-publishing arm of the &quot;Review&quot; is New York Review Books. Established in 1999, it has several imprints: New York Review Books, NYRB Classics, The New York Review Children&#x27;s Collection, New York Review Comics, NYRB Poets, NYRB Lit and the Calligrams. NYRB Collections publishes collections of articles from frequent &quot;Review&quot; contributors. The Classics imprint reissues books that have gone out of print in the US, as well as translations of classic books. It has been called &quot;a marvellous literary imprint ... that has put hundreds of wonderful books back on our shelves.&quot;

==The Robert B. Silvers Foundation==
The Robert B. Silvers Foundation is a charitable trust established in 2017 by a bequest of the late Robert Silvers, a founding editor of &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. Its annual activities include the Silvers Grants for Work in Progress, given in support of long-form non-fiction projects within the fields cultivated by Silvers as editor of the &quot;Review&quot;, and the Silvers-Dudley Prizes, awarded for notable achievements in journalism, criticism, and cultural commentary.

<text>GMD Müller Lifts AG, known as GMD Müller, was a ropeway manufacturing company based in Dietlikon, Switzerland. GMD stands for Gerhard Müller Dietlikon.

Founded in 1947 by engineer Gerhard Müller, who is credited with the invention of the modern detachable chairlift in the late 1940s, it was one of the most prolific and respected aerial lift manufacturers in skiing history. The company was bought out by the management in 1985 after Müller&#x27;s death 

==Overview==

In the late 1920s, Gerhard Müller, a mechanical engineering student, was a newcomer to growing sport of skiing. At the time, there were no user-friendly ski lifts in Switzerland.

At a resort hotel outside Zürich, Müller created his first usable ski lift consisting of a 1-inch hemp rope and some old motorcycle parts. Naturally, being a rope tow, guests regularly complained about sore hands and torn clothes resulting from using the lift. The Sami people use reindeer to tow themselves around on skis, but they rest their hands by looping the reins around their hips. Inspired by this practice, Müller solved the problems of his rope tow by creating the first modern T-bar lift.

GMD Müller gave the licence for T-bar lift to polish company Mostostal Zabrze in 1959. Some of this lifts are still exists.

During the 1960s and 1970s GMD Müller installed more than one hundred fixed-grip chairlifts in North America. Many of these lifts are still in service today. In Europe 4-seater gondola lifts with Müller&#x27;s patented detachable cable grips and T-bars were more popular. Some resorts, such as Whistler, were at the time exclusively equipped with Müller lifts.

GMD Müller is also noted for inventing the Aerobus, a self-propelled bus-like vehicle riding on a suspended overhead cable.

Rowema AG legally succeeded GMD Müller Lifts AG in 1985, and continues to service and supply spare parts to existing GMD Müller systems.

<doc id="297136" wikidata="Q593427" url="?curid=297136" title="Korean Buddhism">
<text>Korean Buddhism is distinguished from other forms of Buddhism by its attempt to resolve what its early practitioners saw as inconsistencies within the Mahayana Buddhist traditions that they received from foreign countries. To address this, they developed a new holistic approach to Buddhism that became a distinct form, an approach characteristic of virtually all major Korean thinkers. The resulting variation is called &quot;Tongbulgyo&quot; (&quot;interpenetrated Buddhism&quot;), a form that sought to harmonize previously arising disputes among scholars (a principle called &quot;hwajaeng&quot; 和諍).

Centuries after Buddhism originated in India, the Mahayana tradition arrived in China through the Silk Road in the 1st century CE via Tibet; it then entered the Korean peninsula in the 4th century during the Three Kingdoms Period, from where it was transmitted to Japan. In Korea, it was adopted as the state religion of 3 constituent polities of the Three Kingdoms Period, first by the Goguryeo (also known as Goryeo) in 372 CE, by the Silla (Gaya) in 528 CE, and by the Baekje in 552 CE.

As it now stands, Korean Buddhism consists mostly of the Seon Lineage, primarily represented by the Jogye and Taego Orders. The Korean Seon has a strong relationship with other Mahayana traditions that bear the imprint of Chan teachings as well as the closely related Zen. Other sects, such as the modern revival of the Cheontae lineage, the Jingak Order (a modern esoteric sect), and the newly formed Won, have also attracted sizable followings.

Korean Buddhism has contributed much to East Asian Buddhism, especially to early Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, and Tibetan schools of Buddhist thought.

==Historical overview and development==

===Arrival and spread of Buddhism ===


When Buddhism was originally introduced to Korea from Former Qin in 372, about 800 years after the death of the historical Buddha, shamanism was the indigenous religion. The Samguk yusa and Samguk sagi record the following three monks who were among the first to bring Buddhist teaching, or Dharma, to Korea in the 4th century during the Three Kingdoms period: Malananta – an Indian Buddhist monk who came from Serindian area of southern China&#x27;s Eastern Jin Dynasty and brought Buddhism to the King Chimnyu of Baekje in the southern Korean peninsula in 384 CE, Sundo (Chinese: 順道; Pinyin: Shundao) – a monk from northern Chinese state Former Qin brought Buddhism to Goguryeo in northern Korea in 372 CE, and Ado – a monk who brought Buddhism to Silla in central Korea. As Buddhism was not seen to conflict with the rites of nature worship, it was allowed by adherents of Shamanism to be blended into their religion. Thus, the mountains that were believed by shamanists to be the residence of spirits in pre-Buddhist times later became the sites of Buddhist temples.

Though it initially enjoyed wide acceptance, even being supported as the state ideology during the Goryeo (918–1392 CE) period, Buddhism in Korea suffered extreme repression during the Joseon (1392–1897 CE) era, which lasted over five hundred years. During this period, Neo-Confucianism overcame the prior dominance of Buddhism.

Only after Buddhist monks helped repel the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98) did the persecution of Buddhists stop. Buddhism in Korea remained subdued until the end of the Joseon period, when its position was strengthened somewhat by the colonial period, which lasted from 1910 to 1945. However, these Buddhist monks did not only put an end to Japanese rule in 1945, but they also asserted their specific and separate religious identity by reforming their traditions and practices. They laid the foundation for many Buddhist societies, and the younger generation of monks came up with the ideology of &quot;Mingung Pulgyo&quot;, or &quot;Buddhism for the people&quot;. The importance of this ideology is that it was coined by the monks who focused on common men&#x27;s daily issues. After World War II, the Seon school of Korean Buddhism once again gained acceptance.

===Extent and syncretic impact of Buddhism ===
 
A 2005 government survey indicated that about a quarter of South Koreans identified as Buddhist. However, the actual number of Buddhists in South Korea is ambiguous as there is no exact or exclusive criterion by which Buddhists can be identified, unlike the Christian population. With Buddhism&#x27;s incorporation into traditional Korean culture, it is now considered a philosophy and cultural background rather than a formal religion. As a result, many people outside of the practicing population are deeply influenced by these traditions. Thus, when counting secular believers or those influenced by the faith while not following other religions, the number of Buddhists in South Korea is considered to be much larger. Similarly, in officially atheist North Korea, while Buddhists officially account for 4.5% of the population, a much larger number (over 70%) of the population are influenced by Buddhist philosophies and customs.

==Buddhism in the Three Kingdoms==
When Buddhism was introduced to Korea in the 4th century CE, the Korean peninsula was politically subdivided into Three Kingdoms of Korea: Goguryeo in the north (which included territory currently in Russia and China), Baekje in the southwest, and Silla in the southeast. There is concrete evidence of an earlier introduction of Buddhism than traditionally believed. A mid-4th century tomb, unearthed near Pyongyang, is found to incorporate Buddhist motifs in its ceiling decoration.

Korean Buddhist monks traveled to China or India in order to study Buddhism in the late Three Kingdoms Period, especially in the 6th century. In 526, the monk Gyeomik (謙益) from Baekje traveled via the southern sea route to India to learn Sanskrit and study the Vinaya. The monk Paya (波若; 562–613?) from Goguryeo is said to have studied under the Tiantai master Zhiyi. Other Korean monks of the period brought back numerous scriptures from abroad and conducted missionary activity throughout Korea.

Several schools of thought developed in Korea during these early times:
*the &quot;Samlon&quot; (三論宗) or East Asian Mādhyamaka school focused on Mādhyamaka doctrine
*the &quot;Gyeyul&quot; (戒律宗, or &quot;Vinaya&quot; in Sanskrit) school was mainly concerned with the study and implementation of śīla or &quot;moral discipline&quot;
*the &quot;Yeolban&quot; (涅槃宗, or &quot;Nirvāna&quot; in Sanskrit) school based in the themes of the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot;
*the &quot;Wonyung&quot; (圓融宗, or &quot;Yuanrong&quot; in Chinese) school formed toward the end of the Three Kingdoms Period. This school lead to the actualization of the metaphysics of interpenetration as found in the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot; and was considered the premier school, especially among the educated aristocracy.
*the &quot;Hwaeom&quot; (華嚴宗 or &quot;Huayan school&quot;) was the longest lasting of the &quot;imported&quot; schools. It had strong ties with the &quot;Beopseong&quot; (法性宗), an indigenous Korean school of thought.

The date of the first mission from Korea to Japan is unclear, but it is reported that a second detachment of scholars was sent to Japan upon invitation by the Japanese rulers in 577. The strong Korean influence on the development of Buddhism in Japan continued through the Unified Silla period. It was not until the 8th century that independent study by Japanese monks began in significant numbers.

===Goguryeo===
In 372, the monk Sundo (順道, pinyin: &quot;Shùndào&quot;) was sent by Fu Jian (337–385) (苻堅) of Former Qin to the court of the King Sosurim of Goguryeo. He brought texts and statues (possibly of Maitreya, who was popular in Buddhism in Central Asia), and the Goguryeo royalty and their subjects quickly accepted his teachings. Buddhism in China was in a rudimentary form, consisting of the law of cause and effect and the search for happiness. This had much in common with the predominant Shamanism, which likely led to the quick assimilation of Buddhism by the people of Goguryeo.

Early Buddhism in Silla developed under the influence of Goguryeo. Some monks from Goguryeo came to Silla and preached among the people, making a few converts. In 551, Hyeryang (惠亮), a Goguryeo monk was appointed the first National Patriarch of Silla. He first presided over the &quot;Hundred-Seat Dharma Assembly&quot; and the &quot;Dharma of Eight Prohibitions&quot;.

===Baekje===
In 384, the Gandharan monk Marananta arrived in Baekje and the royal family received the strain of Buddhism that he brought. King Asin of Baekje proclaimed, &quot;people should believe in Buddhism and seek happiness.&quot; In 526, the Baekje monk Gyeomik (겸익, 謙益) traveled directly to Central India and came back with a collection of Vinaya texts, accompanied by the Indian monk Paedalta (Sanskrit: Vedatta). After returning to Baekje, Gyeomik translated the Buddhist scriptures in Sanskrit into seventy-two volumes. The Gyeyul school in Baekje was established by Gyeomik about a century earlier than its counterpart in China. As a result of his work, he is regarded as the father of Vinaya studies in Korea.

===Silla===

Buddhism did not enter the kingdom of Silla until the 5th century. The common people were first attracted to Buddhism here, but there was resistance among the aristocrats. In 527, however, a prominent court official named Ichadon presented himself to King Beopheung of Silla and announced he had become Buddhist. The king had him beheaded, but when the executioner cut off his head, it is said that milk poured out instead of blood. Paintings of this are in the temple at Haeinsa and a stone monument honoring his martyrdom is in the Gyeongju National Museum. 

During the reign of the next king, Jinheung of Silla, the growth of Buddhism was encouraged and eventually recognized as the national religion of Silla. Selected young men were physically and spiritually trained at Hwarangdo according to Buddhist principles regarding one&#x27;s ability to defend the kingdom. King Jinheung later became a monk himself.

The monk Jajang (慈藏) is credited with having been a major force in the adoption of Buddhism as a national religion. Jajang is also known for his participation in the founding of the Korean monastic sangha.

Another great scholar to emerge from the Silla Period was Wonhyo. He renounced his religious life to better serve the people and even married a princess for a short time, with whom he had a son. He wrote many treatises and his philosophy centered on the unity and interrelatedness of all things. He set off to China to study Buddhism with a close friend, Uisang, but only made it part of the way there. According to legend, Wonhyo awoke one night very thirsty. He found a container with cool water, which he drank before returning to sleep. The next morning he saw that the container from which he had drunk was a human skull and he realized that enlightenment depended on the mind. He saw no reason to continue to China, so he returned home. Uisang continued to China and after studying for ten years, offered a poem to his master in the shape of a seal that geometrically represents infinity. The poem contained the essence of the Avatamsaka Sutra.

Buddhism was so successful during this period that many kings converted and several cities were renamed after famous places during the time of the Buddha.

==Buddhism in the North–South States Period (668–935)==
In the eighth century, Korean Buddhism and its gods were associated with prosperity.

===Unified Silla (668–935)===

In 668, the kingdom of Silla succeeded in unifying the whole Korean peninsula, giving rise to a period of political stability that lasted for about one hundred years under Unified Silla. This led to a high point in scholarly studies of Buddhism in Korea. The most popular areas of study were &quot;Wonyung&quot;, &quot;Yusik&quot; (Ch. 唯識; &quot;Weishi&quot;) or East Asian Yogācāra, &quot;Jeongto&quot; or Pure Land Buddhism, and the indigenous Korean &quot;Beopseong&quot; (&quot;Dharma-nature school&quot;).

Wonhyo taught the Pure Land practice of yeombul, which would become very popular amongst both scholars and laypeople, and has had a lasting influence on Buddhist thought in Korea. His work, which attempts a synthesis of the seemingly divergent strands of Indian and Chinese Buddhist doctrines, makes use of the Essence-Function (體用 &quot;che-yong&quot;) framework, which was popular in native East Asian philosophical schools. His work was instrumental in the development of the dominant school of Korean Buddhist thought, known variously as &quot;Beopseong&quot;, &quot;Haedong&quot; (海東, &quot;Korean&quot;) and later as &quot;Jungdo&quot; (中道, &quot;Middle Way&quot;)

Wonhyo&#x27;s friend Uisang (義湘) went to Chang&#x27;an, where he studied under Huayan patriarchs Zhiyan (智儼; 600–668) and Fazang (法藏; 643–712). When he returned after twenty years, his work contributed to Hwaeom Buddhism and became the predominant doctrinal influence on Korean Buddhism together with Wonhyo&#x27;s &quot;tongbulgyo&quot; thought. Hwaeom principles were deeply assimilated into the Korean meditation-based Seon school, where they made a profound effect on its basic attitudes.

Influences from Silla Buddhism in general, and from these two philosophers in particular crept backwards into Chinese Buddhism. Wonhyo&#x27;s commentaries were very important in shaping the thought of the preeminent Chinese Buddhist philosopher Fazang, and Woncheuk&#x27;s commentary on the &quot;Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra&quot; had a strong influence in Tibetan Buddhism.

The intellectual developments of Silla Buddhism brought with them significant cultural achievements in many areas, including painting, literature, sculpture, and architecture. During this period, many large and beautiful temples were built. Two crowning achievements were the temple Bulguksa and the cave-retreat of Seokguram (石窟庵). Bulguksa was famous for its jeweled pagodas, while Seokguram was known for the beauty of its stone sculpture.

===Balhae (698–926)===
Buddhism also flourished in the northern Korean Kingdom of Balhae, established after the fall of Goguryeo, as the state religion. The remains of ten Buddhist temples have been found in the remains of the capital of Balhae, Sanggyeong, together with such Buddhist artifacts as Buddha statuettes and stone lanterns, which suggests that Buddhism played a predominant role in the life of the Balhae people. The Balhae tomb Majeokdal in Sinpo, South Hamgyong Province, are associated with pagodas and temples: This also indicates that Buddhism had a strong influence over the funerary rituals in Balhae.

After the fall of Balhae, sixty monks from Balhae including the monk Jaeung (載雄) fled together to the newly founded kingdom of Goryeo (918–1392).

=== Seon ===

A new epoch in Korean Buddhism began during the latter Silla with the birth of schools of Korean Seon. In China, the movement toward a meditation-based practice, which came to be known as Chan Buddhism, had begun during the sixth and seventh centuries, and it was not long before the influence of the new meditational school reached Korea, where it was known as &quot;Seon&quot;. The term is more widely known in the West in its Japanese variant, Zen. Tension developed between the new meditational schools and the pre-existing academically oriented schools, which were described by the term &quot;gyo&quot;, meaning &quot;learning&quot; or &quot;study&quot;.

Kim Gyo-gak (金喬覺; 630–729), a prince who became a monastic, came to the region of Anhui to Mount Jiuhua in China. Many Chinese Buddhists believe he was indeed the transformation body of Kṣitigarbha. Two uncles sent by his mother and wife to call him back also became monastics there. His well-preserved, dehydrated body is seen at the monastery he built on Mount Jiuhua today. The two uncles, being officials before becoming monastics, found it difficult to abstain from wine and meat, and so practiced in another place on the mount. People built the palace of the two saints (二聖殿) in their practice place to memorialize them. Many Buddhists visit there.

Beomnang (法朗; fl. 632–646), said to be a student of the Chinese master Daoxin (道信; 580–651), is generally credited with the initial transmission of Chan into Korea. It was popularized by Sinhaeng (神行; 704–779) in the latter part of the eighth century and by Doui (道義; died 825) at the beginning of the ninth century. From then on, many Koreans studied Chan in China, and upon their return established their own schools at various mountain monasteries with their leading disciples. Initially, the number of these schools was fixed at nine, and Korean Seon was then termed the &quot;nine mountain schools&quot; (九山 or &quot;gusan&quot;). Eight of these were of the Mazu Daoyi (馬祖道一; 709–788) lineage, as they were established through connection with either him or one of his eminent disciples. The one exception was the Sumi-san school founded by Ieom (利嚴; 869–936), which had developed from the Caodong school (曹洞).

==Buddhism as state religion in the Goryeo period (918–1392)==

===Rise of the Seon===
As Buddhism in medieval Korea evolved, it served to legitimize the state.

Initially, the new Seon schools were regarded by the established doctrinal schools as radical and dangerous upstarts. Thus, the early founders of the various &quot;nine mountain&quot; monasteries met with considerable resistance, repressed by the long influence in court of the Gyo schools. The struggles which ensued continued for most of the Goryeo period, but gradually the Seon argument for the possession of the true transmission of enlightenment gained the upper hand. The position that was generally adopted in the later Seon schools, due in large part to the efforts of Jinul (知訥; 1158–1210), did not claim clear superiority of Seon meditational methods, but rather declared the intrinsic unity and similarities of the Seon and Gyo viewpoints.

Although all these schools are mentioned in historical records, toward the end of the dynasty, Seon became dominant in its effect on the government and society, as well as the production of noteworthy scholars and adepts. During the Goryeo period, Seon thoroughly became a &quot;religion of the state&quot;, receiving extensive support and privileges through connections with the ruling family and powerful members of the court.

===Hwaeom (Huayan) and Seon===
Although most of the scholastic schools waned in activity and influence during this period of Seon&#x27;s growth, the Hwaeom school continued to be a lively source of scholarship well into the Goryeo, much of it continuing the legacy of Uisang and Wonhyo. In particular the work of Gyunyeo (均如; 923–973) prepared for the reconciliation of Hwaeom and Seon, with Hwaeom&#x27;s accommodating attitude toward the latter. Gyunyeo&#x27;s works are an important source for modern scholarship in identifying the distinctive nature of Korean Hwaeom.

Another important advocate of Seon/Gyo unity was Uicheon. Like most other early Goryeo monks, he began his studies in Buddhism with Hwaeom. He later traveled to China, and upon his return, actively promulgated the Cheontae (), which became recognized as another Seon school. This period thus came to be described as &quot;five doctrinal and two meditational schools&quot;. Uicheon himself, however, alienated too many Seon adherents, and he died at a relatively young age without seeing a Seon-Gyo unity accomplished.

===Jinul===
The most important figure of Seon in the Goryeo was Jinul. In his time, the sangha was in a crisis of external appearance and internal issues of doctrine. Buddhism had gradually become involved with secular affairs, incorporating practices such as fortune-telling and offering of prayers and rituals for success in secular endeavors. Inclination toward these practices resulted in the profusion of an increasingly larger number of monks and nuns with questionable motivations. The correction, revival, and improvement of the quality of Buddhism became prominent issues for Buddhist leaders of the period.

Jinul sought to establish a new movement within Seon which he called the &quot;samādhi and prajñā society&quot; () whose goal was to establish a new community of disciplined, pure-minded practitioners deep in the mountains. He eventually accomplished this mission with the founding of Songgwangsa at Mt. Jogye (曹溪山). Jinul&#x27;s works are characterized by a thorough analysis and reformulation of the methodologies of Seon study and practice.

One major issue that had long fermented in Chan, and which received special focus from Jinul, was the relationship between &quot;gradual&quot; and &quot;sudden&quot; methods in practice and enlightenment. Drawing upon various Chinese treatments of this topic, most importantly those by Huayan Patriarch Guifeng Zongmi (780–841) and Linji master Dahui Zonggao (大慧; 1089–1163), Jinul created a &quot;sudden enlightenment followed by gradual practice&quot; dictum that he outlined in a few relatively concise and accessible texts. From Dahui Zonggao, Jinul also incorporated the hwadu method into his practice. This form of meditation is the main method taught in Seon today.

Jinul&#x27;s philosophical resolution of the Seon-Gyo conflict brought a deep and lasting effect on Korean Buddhism.

===Late Goryeo===
The general trend of Buddhism in the latter half of the Goryeo was a decline due to corruption, and the rise of strong anti-Buddhist political and philosophical sentiment. However, this period of relative decadence would nevertheless produce some of Korea&#x27;s most renowned Seon masters. Three important monks of this period who figured prominently in charting the future course of Korean Seon were contemporaries and friends: Gyeonghan Baeg&#x27;un (景閑白雲; 1298–1374), Taego Bou (太古普愚; 1301–1382) and Naong Hyegeun (懶翁慧勤; 1320–1376). All three went to Yuan China to learn the hwadu practice of the Linji school () that had been popularized by Jinul. All three returned and established the sharp, confrontational methods of the Imje school in their own teaching. Each of the three was also said to have had hundreds of disciples, such that this new infusion into Korean Seon brought about a considerable effect.

Despite the Imje influence, which was generally considered to be anti-scholarly in nature, Gyeonghan and Naong, under the influence of Jinul and the traditional &quot;tongbulgyo&quot; tendency, showed an unusual interest in scriptural study, as well as a strong understanding of &quot;Confucianism&quot; and &quot;Taoism&quot;, due to the increasing influence of Chinese philosophy as the foundation of official education. From this time, a marked tendency for Korean Buddhist monks to be &quot;three teachings&quot; exponents appeared.

A significant historical event of the Goryeo period is the production of the first woodblock edition of the Tripiṭaka called the &quot;Tripitaka Koreana&quot;. Two editions were made, the first one completed from 1210 to 1231, and the second one from 1214 to 1259. The first edition was destroyed in a fire, during an attack by the Mongols in 1232, but the second edition is still in existence at Haeinsa in Gyeongsang. This edition of the &quot;Tripitaka&quot; was of high quality, and served as the standard version of the &quot;Tripitaka&quot; in East Asia for almost 700 years.

==Suppression under the Joseon Dynasty (1392–1910)==

In 1388, an influential general named Yi Seonggye (1335–1408) carried out a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; and established himself as the first ruler of the Joseon dynasty in 1392 with the support of this Neo-Confucian movement. He was posthumously renamed Emperor Taejo of Joseon in 1899. Joseon Buddhism, which had started off under the so-called &quot;five doctrinal and two meditational&quot; schools system of the Goryeo, was first condensed to two schools: Seon and Gyo. Eventually, these were further reduced to the single school of Seon.

Despite this strong suppression from the government, and vehement ideological opposition from Korean Neo-Confucianism, Seon Buddhism continued to thrive intellectually. An outstanding thinker was &quot;Gihwa&quot; (己和; (Hamheo Deuktong 涵虚得通) 1376–1433), who had first studied at a Confucian academy, but then changed his focus to Buddhism, where he was initiated to the &quot;gwanhwa&quot; tradition by &quot;Muhak Jacho&quot; (無學自超; 1327–1405). He wrote many scholarly commentaries, as well as essays and a large body of poetry. Being well-versed in Confucian and Taoist philosophies, Giwha also wrote an important treatise in defense of Buddhism, from the standpoint of the intrinsic unity of the three teachings, entitled the &quot;Hyeonjeong non&quot;. In the tradition of earlier philosophers, he applied &quot;che-yong&quot; (&quot;essence-function&quot;) and &quot;Hwaeom&quot; (&quot;sa-sa mu-ae&quot;, &quot;mutual interpenetration of phenomena&quot;).

Common in the works of Joseon scholar-monks are writings on Hwaeom-related texts, as well as the &quot;Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana&quot;, &quot;Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment&quot;, &quot;Śūraṅgama Sūtra&quot;, &quot;Diamond Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Heart Sutra&quot;. The Jogye order instituted a set curriculum of scriptural study, including the above-mentioned works, along with other shorter selections from eminent Korean monks, such as Jinul.

During the Joseon period, the number of Buddhist monasteries dropped from several hundred to a mere thirty-six. Limits were placed on the number of clergy, land area, and ages for entering the sangha. When the final restrictions were in place, monks and nuns were prohibited from entering the cities. Buddhist funerals, and even begging, were outlawed. However, some rulers occasionally appeared who looked favorably upon Buddhism and did away with some of the more suppressive regulations. The most noteworthy of these was the Queen Munjeong, who, as a devout Buddhist, took control of the government in the stead of her young son Myeongjong (r. 1545–67), and immediately repealed many anti-Buddhist measures. The queen had deep respect for the brilliant monk &quot;Bou&quot; (보우, 普雨; 1515–1565), and installed him as the head of the Seon school.

One of the most important reasons for the restoration of Buddhism to a position of minimal acceptance was the role of Buddhist monks in repelling the Japanese invasions of Korea, which occurred between 1592 and 1598. At that time, the government was weak from internal squabbles, and was not initially able to muster strong resistance to the incursion. The plight of the country encouraged some leaders of the sangha to organize monks into guerrilla units, which enjoyed some instrumental successes. The &quot;righteous monk&quot; (義士; &quot;uisa&quot;) movement spread during this eight-year war, finally including several thousand monks, led by the aging Seosan Hyujeong (서산대사, 西山休靜; 1520–1604), a first-rate Seon master and the author of a number of important religious texts. The presence of the monks&#x27; army was a critical factor in the eventual expulsion of the Japanese invaders.

Seosan is also known for continuing efforts toward the unification of Buddhist doctrinal study and practice. His efforts were strongly influenced by Wonhyo, Jinul, and Gihwa. He is considered the central figure in the revival of Joseon Buddhism, and most major streams of modern Korean Seon trace their lineages back to him through one of his four main disciples: &quot;Yu Jeong&quot; (1544–1610); &quot;Eongi&quot; (1581–1644), &quot;Taeneung&quot; (1562–1649) and &quot;Ilseon&quot; (1533–1608), all four of whom were lieutenants to Seosan during the war with Japan.

The biographies of Seosan and his four major disciples are similar in many respects, and these similarities are emblematic of the typical lifestyle of Seon monks of the late Goryeo and Joseon periods. Most of them began by engaging in Confucian and Daoist studies. Turning to Seon, they pursued a markedly itinerant lifestyle, wandering through the mountain monasteries. At this stage, they were initiated to the central component of Seon practice, the &quot;gong&#x27;an&quot;, or &quot;gwanhwa&quot; meditation. This &quot;gwanhwa&quot; meditation, unlike Zen traditions, did not consist of contemplation on a lengthy, graduated series of kōans. In contrast, the typical Korean approach was that &quot;all &quot;gong&#x27;an&quot; are contained in one&quot; and therefore it was, and still is, quite common for the practitioner to remain with one &quot;hwadu&quot; during his whole meditational career, most often Zhaozhou Congshen&#x27;s &quot;&quot;mu&quot;.&quot;

Buddhism during the three centuries, from the time of Seosan down to the next Japanese incursion into Korea in the late nineteenth century, remained fairly consistent with the above-described model. A number of eminent teachers appeared during the centuries after Seosan, but the Buddhism of the late Joseon, while keeping most of the common earlier characteristics, was especially marked by a revival of Hwaeom studies, and occasionally by new interpretations of methodology in Seon study. There was also a revival, during the final two centuries, of Pure Land Buddhism. Although the government maintained fairly tight control of the sangha, there was never again the extreme suppression of the early Joseon.

==Buddhism under Japanese colonial rule==

During Japan&#x27;s Meiji Restoration in the 1870s, the government abolished celibacy for Buddhist monks and nuns. Japanese Buddhists won the right to proselytize inside cities, ending a five-hundred year ban on clergy members entering cities. Jōdo Shinshū and Nichiren schools began sending missionaries to Korea and new sects formed in Korea such as Won Buddhism.

After the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910, when Japan annexed Korea, Korean Buddhism underwent many changes. The Temple Ordinance of 1911 () changed the traditional system whereby temples were run as a collective enterprise by the Sangha, replacing this system with Japanese-style management practices in which temple abbots appointed by the Governor-General of Korea were given private ownership of temple property and given the rights of inheritance to such property. More importantly, monks from pro-Japanese factions began to adopt Japanese practices, by marrying and having children.

In 1920, the Temple Ordinance was revised to reorganize temple administration and allow the Japanese government to directly oversee the 31 main temples in the country, with new headquarters at Kakwangsa (now Jogyesa). During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Korean Buddhism was placed under greater control. Japanese authorities had many temples&#x27; artworks shipped to Japan. Negotiations for the repatriation of these artworks are still ongoing today.

==Buddhism and independent Korea (1945~present)==

When Korea was liberated by the surrender of Japan in 1945, the celibate monastics of what has become the largest sect of Korean Buddhism in terms of adherents and the number of clergy, the Jogye Order, began to take over for the married priests who ran the temples during the occupation. This order sees itself as the primary representative of traditional Korean Buddhism in existence. The Taego Order is the second largest order of Korean Buddhism and includes both celibate and married monks (nuns are expected to remain celibate). This is the only order that maintains the full Korean Buddhist ritual tradition.

===Current situation===

The Seon school, which is dominated by the Jogye Order in terms of the number of clergy and adherents, practices disciplined traditional Seon practice at a number of major mountain monasteries in Korea, often under the direction of highly regarded masters. The Taego Order, though it has more temples than the Jogye Order, is second in size in terms of the number of clergy and adherents and, in addition to Seon meditation, keeps traditional Buddhist arts alive, such as Yeongsanjae and other ritual dance.

Modern Seon practice is not far removed in its content from the original practice of Jinul, who introduced the integrated combination of the practice of Gwanhwa meditation and the study of selected Buddhist texts. The Korean monastic life is markedly itinerant for monks and nuns pursuing Seon meditation training: while each monk or nun has a &quot;home&quot; monastery, he or she will regularly travel throughout the mountains, staying as long as he or she wishes, studying and teaching in the style of the temple that is housing them. The Korean monastic training system has seen a steadily increasing influx of Western practitioner-aspirants in the second half of the twentieth century. The vast majority of Korean monks and nuns do not spend 20 or 30 years in the mountains pursuing Seon training in a form recognizable to westerners. Most Korean monks and nuns receive a traditional academic education in addition to ritual training, which is not necessarily in a formal ritual training program. Those who do spend time in meditation in the mountains may do so for a few years and then essentially return to the life of a parish priest.

Currently, Korean Buddhism is in a state of slow transition. While the reigning theory behind Korean Buddhism was based on Jinul&#x27;s &quot;sudden enlightenment, gradual cultivation&quot;, the modern Korean Seon master, Seongcheol&#x27;s revival of Hui Neng&#x27;s &quot;sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation&quot; has taken Korean Buddhism by storm. Although there is resistance to change within the ranks of the Jogye order, with the last three Supreme Patriarchs&#x27; stance that is in accordance with Seongcheol, there has been a gradual change in the atmosphere of Korean Buddhism.

=== North Korea ===
&quot;See also: Religion in North Korea&quot;
The regime in North Korea actively discourages the practice of religion, including Buddhism. Currently, the country claims to have about 10,000 active adherents of Buddhism. As with other religions in the country, Buddhism came under the close scrutiny of the country&#x27;s government – including worship at Buddhist temples by monks, through the state-sponsored Korea Buddhist Federation. A major temple is Pohyonsa which was preserved by Kim Il-Sung.

Nevertheless, Buddhists in North Korea reportedly fared better than other religious groups – particularly Christians, who were said to often face persecution by the authorities, and Buddhists were given limited funding by the government to promote the religion, given that Buddhism played an integral role in traditional Korean culture.

===South Korea===

Starting in the 1950s, Syngman Rhee and others worked to further divide and weaken the Buddhist Sangha in the country. Rhee campaigned in 1954 against the so-called &quot;Japanized Buddhists&quot;. Western education and scholarship, and the empowerment of women and the poor, caused divisions among Koreans. Specifically, a deep rift opened between married priests and celibate monks, a carryover from Japanese Buddhism&#x27;s influence during the occupation period, though there had been calls for an end to celibacy from some Korean monks before Japan&#x27;s annexation of the Korean peninsula. The differences were so great that fistfights over the control of temples became frequent. Monks, mostly belonging to the celibate Jogye order, threatened to kill themselves. Many of them were against the married clergy. As the Buddhist riots continued, the influence of Buddhism lessened. Buddhism continued to lose followers to Christian missionaries, who were able to capitalize on these weaknesses.

From the 1960s onward, Buddhism has grown considerably, through the formation of independent lay associations (that is, not funded or affiliated to the main orders), with many focused on youths, particularly to propagate and evangelize Buddhist teachings, fellowship and spiritual development, based on the Protestant model. These adaptations have modernized Buddhism in South Korea. Moreover, the South Korean government began devoting substantial funds to restore and reconstruct historic Buddhist temples, helping to revive Buddhism in the country. President Park Chung Hee unsuccessfully attempted during his rule (1961–1979) to settle the dispute by building a pan-national Buddhist organization. However, he did succeed in allying himself with the celibate faction, the Jogye Order.

It was in 1970 that Korean Buddhism split into a fully celibate order which retained the name &quot;Jogye&quot; and the Taego order that includes both celibate and married clergy. The Taego order retained the traditional red kasa whereas the Jogye order changed their kasa to brown to visually differentiate the two orders. Both orders continue to use the Dharmaguptaka Pratimoksha, the lineage of vows for monks and nuns taken in China and Vietnam, though Taego monks have the option of returning the vow of celibacy. When the Jogye order was founded, the government only recognized a small group of celibate Seon practitioners as &quot;legitimate&quot;, thus all of the ritual specialists remained with the Taego order.

In the 1980s, President Chun Doo-hwan, a Presbyterian, adopted anti-Buddhist policies and attempted to restrict Buddhist activities. During his administration, many historic temples were converted into tourist resorts, which deprived temples of their autonomy, as these &quot;national parks&quot; were government-run. Consequently, Buddhists, especially the Jogye Order, were highly critical of these measures. From 27 to 31 October 1980, during the Kyeongsin Persecution, the government raided major Buddhist temples throughout the country, including the headquarters at Seoul&#x27;s Jogyesa, under the guise of anti-government investigations and an attempt to &quot;purify&quot; Buddhism. 55 monks were arrested and many others were interrogated and tortured, including the abbot of Naksansa, who died from the abuses. None of the investigated monks were ever charged, although many were sent to reeducation camps. Throughout the 1980s, the Buddhist community was kept under strict surveillance of government agents and many were prosecuted under false charges of supporting Communists or conspiracy.

To Buddhists, the construct of a state-protecting Buddhism (호국불교 or 護國佛敎, &quot;Hoguk Bulgyo&quot;) had vanished, which served to radicalize a generation of Buddhists, including monks and laity and propelled them to start a movement called Minjung Buddhism (민중불교 or 民衆佛敎, &quot;practical Buddhism&quot; or &quot;Buddhism for the masses&quot;). This modernization emphasized ordinary people and was a reaction to aggressive Christian proselytization in Korea.

From the mid-1980s to date, Buddhism has expanded by through media and education. There are two major Buddhist media networks in South Korea, BTN Buddhist Television Network, Korea&#x27;s only non-sectarian Buddhist Media, which includes cable television and IP Radio and the Buddhist Broadcasting System (BBS), founded in 1990. Buddhist orders are also affiliated with or operate 3 universities, 26 schools and 16 seminaries in the country. The Kwan Um School of Zen is one of South Korea&#x27;s most successful international missionary institutions.

During the 1990s, conflicts between the South Korean government and Buddhist leaders, as well as with fundamentalist Protestant denominations, continued. The government accused Buddhism of immorality and many Protestants used this to forward their missionary work. Some religious gatherings have even turned violent, vandalizing statues of Buddha and Dangun, the mythical founder of Korea. Soon after the Buddhist Broadcasting Service&#x27;s FM radio station was launched in 1990, young men vandalized and destroyed sound facilities worth US$200,000.

There was also a rash of temple burnings in the 1980s and 1990s, and attacks on Buddhist artwork have continued. In one instance, a Protestant minister used a microphone on a cord as a bolo weapon and smashed temple paintings and a statue. In other instances, red crosses have been painted on temple walls, murals, and statues. Buddha statues have also been decapitated. Furthermore, students at Buddhist universities report aggressive attempts to convert them on campus, especially near campus temples.

Sectarian tensions between fundamentalist Protestants and Buddhists occasionally surface due to what has been seen as a tendency of government officials – many of whom are Christians, especially of Protestant denominations – to tilt the political balance in favour of Christians over Buddhists which has led to discontent within the Buddhist community.

Of particular note was the ascension of Lee Myung-bak to the South Korean presidency when the high proportion of Christians in relation to Buddhists in the public sector became known – particularly the president&#x27;s cabinet, where there were 12 Christians to only one Buddhist. among other reported incidences.

Recently, the South Korean public has become increasingly critical of Protestant churches and leaders due to their support for aggressive missionary tactics. This has led many Protestants leaving their churches and converting to Buddhism.

The growing discontent with Protestant Christianity in South Korea has contributed to a spiritual and cultural revival of Buddhism in South Korea, with the number of followers increasing in recent years.

==== Antagonism from Korean Protestantism ====

Fundamentalist Protestant antagonism against Buddhism has increased in recent years. Acts of vandalism against Buddhist amenities and instances of fundamentalist Christians praying for the destruction of all Buddhist temples and monasteries have all drawn attention to this persistent hostility against Buddhism from Korean Protestants. South Korean Buddhists have denounced what they view as discriminatory measures against them and their religion by the administration of President Lee Myung-bak, which they attribute to Lee being a Protestant. The Buddhist Jogye Order has accused the Lee government of discriminating against Buddhism by ignoring Buddhist temples in certain public documents. In 2006, according to the &quot;Asia Times&quot;, &quot;Lee also sent a video prayer message to a Christian rally held in the southern city of Busan in which the worship leader prayed feverishly: &#x27;Lord, let the Buddhist temples in this country crumble down! Further, according to an article in &quot;Buddhist-Christian Studies&quot;: &quot;Over the course of the last decade a fairly large number of Buddhist temples in South Korea have been destroyed or damaged by fire by misguided Protestant fundamentalists. More recently, Buddhist statues have been identified as idols, attacked and decapitated. Arrests are hard to effect, as the arsonists and vandals work by stealth of night.&quot; A 2008 incident in which police investigated protesters who had been given sanctuary in the Jogye temple in Seoul and searched a car driven by Jigwan, then the executive chief of the Jogye order, led to protests by some claiming police had treated Jigwan as a criminal.

In October 2010, students from Church Equipping Worship School posted a clip on YouTube professing a hope that God would destroy a Buddhist temple in Seoul. Later they claimed being taught such by God.

Following public outrages sparked by the video, pastor Choi Ji-ho and students from the school went to Bongeunsa Temple to apologize for the comments made by the student.

The presidency of Park Geun-hye intended to address Protestant Christian antagonism against Buddhists in South Korea, due to increasing calls for religious cooperation in the country by the general public. During the first year of the Park administration, a national message was delivered for the celebration of Buddha&#x27;s Birthday, a contrast from the former Lee Myung-bak administration which was criticised for its role in the suppression of Buddhist influence in South Korea.

<doc id="297137" wikidata="Q2722458" url="?curid=297137" title="Pandurang Shastri Athavale">
<text>Pandurang Shastri Athavale (19 October 1920 – 25 October 2003), also known as Dada /Dadaji (&quot;elder brother&quot;), was an Indian activist, philosopher, spiritual leader, social revolutionary, and religion reformist, who founded the Swadhyaya Parivar (Swadhyaya family) in 1954. Swadhyaya is a self-study process based on the Bhagavad Gita which has spread across nearly 100,000 villages in India, Americas, Europe, Middle East, Oceania and other Asian countries with five million adherents. Noted for his discourses on the Bhagavad Gita, the Vedas and the Upanishads, Dadaji is also known for his selfless work and brilliant knowledge in scriptures.

==Early life==
Pandurang shastri Athavale was born on 19 of October 1920 in Chitpavan Brahmin Family in the village of Roha in Maharashtra (Konkan), India. He was one of five children born to the Sanskrit teacher Vaijanath Shastri Athavale and his wife Parvati Athavale.

When Athavale was twelve years old, his father set up an independent course of study for the young boy. Thus, Athavale was taught in a system very similar to that of the Tapovan system of ancient India. In 1942, he started to give discourses at the &quot;Srimad Bhagavad Gita Pathshala, Madhavbaug, Mumbai&quot;, a center set up by his father in 1926.&quot;

Athavale read diligently in the Royal Asiatic Library for a period of 14 years; at a young age, he was well known to have read every piece of non-fiction literature (ranging from Marx&#x27;s philosophy to Whitehead&#x27;s writings to ancient Indian philosophy). In 1954, he attended the Second World Philosophers&#x27; Conference, held in Japan. There, Athavale presented the concepts of Vedic ideals and the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. Many participants were impressed by his ideas but wanted evidence of such ideals being put into practice in India. Nobel Prize–winning physicist Dr. Arthur Holly Compton was particularly enchanted with Athavale&#x27;s ideas and offered him a lucrative opportunity in the United States, where he could spread his ideas. Athavale politely declined, saying that he had much to accomplish in his native India, where he planned to demonstrate to the world a model community peacefully practising and spreading Vedic thoughts and the message of the Bhagavad Gita.

==Swadhyaya Parivar==

The philosophy of original Vedic Dharma is the base of this movement.
Swadhyaya Parivar established itself in India in 1978 with adherents meeting every Sunday, where prayers are sung and a video recording of Athavale teaching about the Vedic dharma is played. Swadhyaya, which closely translates to &quot;study of the self&quot; is a process based upon Vedic philosophy, and the members of the Parivar are called &quot;Swadhyayees&quot;. Over the years, Athavale&#x27;s followers have taken the Bhagavad Gita&#x27;s concepts of Indwelling God and God&#x27;s universal love, to millions of people: transcending caste, socioeconomic barriers, and religious differences. Athavale personally visited tens of thousands of villages (on foot and rented bicycles), and his brothers and sisters (swadhyayees) went to every house personally and established a selfless relationship with each family and went house to house to spread Gita&#x27;s thoughts. adherents have followed suit to roughly 100,000 villages across India, and at least 34 nations across the globe. Dadaji In these villages, Athavale started various experiments (Prayogs) to impart social activism by means of a god-centric devotion, including cooperative farming, fishing and tree-planting projects in the spirit of collective, divine labour (bhakti), somewhat similar to the Antigonish Movement in Canada. Swadhyayees aim to fulfill Athavale&#x27;s vision of eradicating the world&#x27;s problems by creating a global family united under the principle of a universal blood maker. He felt that the universality of the Bhagavad Gita allows for it to a guide to all of humanity. As such, its thoughts should reach unto the last person. Today, the millions of adherents can be found on every habitable continent in over 35 countries including the Caribbean, Americas, Asia, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Middle East and Africa. It is the Swadhyaya Parivar&#x27;s mission to complete Rev. Athavale&#x27;s vision of a &quot;Universal Brotherhood under the Divine Fatherhood of God.&quot;

==Death==
Athavale died at the age of 83 of cardiac arrest on 25 October 2003, in Mumbai, India. He was cremated on the evening of 26 October at Tattvagyan Vidyapeeth in the Thane district, where hundreds of thousands of mourners had paid their respects to him over a period of 24 hours. Subsequently, his ashes were immersed at Ujjain, Pushkar, Haridwar, Kurukshetra, Gaya, Jagannath Puri, and lastly at Rameshwaram.

==Popular culture==
In 1991 Shyam Benegal created and directed the film &quot;Antarnaad&quot; (The Inner Voice), based on Athavale&#x27;s Swadhyaya Movement or Prayogs, starring Shabana Azmi and Kulbhushan Kharbanda, among others. In 2004 Abir Bazaz directed the documentary &quot;Swadhyaya&quot;, based on the life and works of Athavale.

==Works==
* There are multiple books based on Dadaji&#x27;s pravachan based on Vedic Stotras, The Geeta, and Ramayan. His famous books include Valmiki Ramayan, Geeta Amrutam, Homage to Saints, Prarthana Preeti, Tulsidal, Sanskruti Pujan (describing about the appropriate definitions of culture and dharma), Vijigishu Jivanvad and many more. Written in multiple languages like Gujarati, Marathi, Hindi, and Sanskrit &quot;The Systems: The Way and the Work&quot; (Swadhyaya: The Unique Philosophy of Life), by Shri Pandurang Vaijnath Athavale Shastri (Dada).

<doc id="297139" wikidata="Q3304316" url="?curid=297139" title="Granta">
<text>Granta is a literary magazine and publisher in the United Kingdom whose mission centres on its &quot;belief in the power and urgency of the story, both in fiction and non-fiction, and the story&#x27;s supreme ability to describe, illuminate and make real.&quot; In 2007, &quot;The Observer&quot; stated: &quot;In its blend of memoirs and photojournalism, and in its championing of contemporary realist fiction, &quot;Granta&quot; has its face pressed firmly against the window, determined to witness the world.&quot;

&quot;Granta&quot; has published twenty-seven laureates of the Nobel Prize in Literature. Literature published by &quot;Granta&quot; regularly win prizes such as the Forward Prize, T. S. Eliot Prize, Pushcart Prize and more.

==History==
&quot;Granta&quot; was founded in 1889 by students at Cambridge University as &quot;The Granta&quot;, edited by R. C. Lehmann (who later became a major contributor to &quot;Punch&quot;). It was started as a periodical featuring student politics, badinage and literary efforts. The title was taken from the River Granta, the medieval name for the Cam, the river which runs through the city but is now used only for that river&#x27;s upper reaches. An early editor of the magazine was R. P. Keigwin, the English cricketer and Danish scholar; in 1912–13 the editor was the poet, writer and reviewer Edward Shanks.

In this form the magazine had a long and distinguished history. The magazine published juvenilia of a number of writers who later became well known: Geoffrey Gorer, William Empson, Michael Frayn, Ted Hughes, A. A. Milne, Sylvia Plath, Bertram Fletcher Robinson, John Simpson, and Stevie Smith.

==Rebirth==
During the 1970s the publication, faced with financial difficulties and increasing levels of student apathy, was rescued by a group of interested postgraduates, including writer and producer Jonathan Levi, journalist Bill Buford, and Peter de Bolla (now Professor of Cultural History and Aesthetics at Cambridge University). In 1979, it was successfully relaunched as a magazine of &quot;new writing&quot;, with both writers and audience drawn from the world beyond Cambridge. The magazine&#x27;s first issue as a national publication was entitled &quot;New American Writing&quot;. Bill Buford (who wrote &quot;Among the Thugs&quot; originally as a project for the journal) was the editor for its first 16 years in the new incarnation. During this time the staff included Richard Rayner and the novelist Carole Morin. Ian Jack succeeded Buford, editing &quot;Granta&quot; from 1995 until 2007.

Since 2003, &quot;Granta&quot; has been published in Spain in Spanish. In April 2007, it was announced that Jason Cowley, editor of the &quot;Observer Sport Monthly&quot;, would succeed Jack as editor in September 2007. Cowley redesigned and relaunched the magazine; he also launched a new website. In September 2008, he left after having been selected as editor of the &quot;New Statesman&quot;.

Alex Clark, a former deputy literary editor of &quot;The Observer&quot;, succeeded him as the first female editor of &quot;Granta&quot;. In late May 2009, Clark left the publication and John Freeman, the American editor, took over the magazine.

, &quot;Granta&quot;″s circulation is 23,000. In the 164th issue Sigrid Rausing, who had served as editor since 2013, announced she would turn over editorship to Thomas Meaney with the Autumn issue of 2023.

==Ownership==
In 1994, Rea Hederman, owner of &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, took a controlling stake in the magazine. In October 2005, control of the magazine was bought by Sigrid Rausing. Rausing established the Granta Trust in 2019 as the owner of the magazine.

==Granta Books==

In 1989, then-editor Buford founded Granta Books. Granta&#x27;s stated aim for its book publishing imprint is to publish work that &quot;stimulates, inspires, addresses difficult questions, and examines intriguing periods of history.&quot; Owner Sigrid Rausing has been vocal about her goal to maintain these standards for both the magazine and the book imprint, telling the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, &quot;[&quot;Granta&quot;] will not publish any books that could not potentially be extracted in the magazine. We use the magazine as a yardstick for our books... We are no longer going to look at what sells as a sort of argument, because it seemed to me that we were in danger of losing our inventiveness about what we wanted to do.&quot; Authors recently published by Granta Books include Michael Collins, Simon Gray, Anna Funder, Tim Guest, Caspar Henderson, Louise Stern and Olga Tokarczuk.

When Rausing purchased &quot;Granta&quot;, she brought with her the publishing imprint Portobello Books, founded in 2005; as of January 2019 the Portobello Books imprint was closed, with all its contracted authors therefter published under the Granta Books imprint. Granta Books are distributed by The Book Service in the UK. Granta Books are distributed by Ingram Publisher Services in the US.

==&quot;Granta&quot; Best of Young British Novelists==
In 1983, &quot;Granta&quot; (issue #7) published a list of 20 young British novelists as names to watch out for in the future. Since then, the magazine has repeated its recognition of emerging writers in 1993 (issue #43), 2003 (issue #81) and 2013 (issue #123). In 1996 (issue #54), &quot;Granta&quot; published a similar list of promising young American novelists, which was repeated during 2007 (issue #97). In 2010 &quot;Granta&quot; issue #113 was devoted to the best young Spanish-language novelists. Many of the selections have been prescient. At least 12 of those identified have subsequently either won or been short-listed for major literary awards such as the Booker Prize and Whitbread Prize.

The recognition of Adam Thirlwell and Monica Ali on the 2003 list was controversial, as neither had yet published a novel. Thirlwell&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;Politics&quot;, later met with mixed reviews. Ali&#x27;s &quot;Brick Lane&quot; was widely praised. Those controversially excluded in 2003 included Giles Foden, Alex Garland, Niall Griffiths, Zoë Heller, Tobias Hill, Jon McGregor (who won the International Dublin Literary Award less than ten years later), Patrick Neate, Maggie O&#x27;Farrell and Rebecca Smith.

Dan Rhodes contacted others on the 2003 list to try to persuade them to make a joint statement in protest against the Iraq War, which was gaining momentum at the time. Not all the writers responded. Rhodes was so disappointed he considered stopping writing, but has continued.

In 2023, the list for the first time included international writers who view the UK as their home.

<text>In civil law and Roman law, the legitime (&quot;legitima portio&quot;), also known as a forced share or legal right share, of a decedent&#x27;s estate is that portion of the estate from which he cannot disinherit his children, or his parents, without sufficient legal cause. The word comes from French &quot;héritier légitime&quot;, meaning &quot;rightful heir.&quot;

The legitime is usually a statutory fraction of the decedent&#x27;s gross estate and passes as joint property to the decedent&#x27;s next-of-kin in equal undivided shares. The legitime cannot be infringed in order to give a spouse or other beneficiary a greater share of the estate. Therefore, when a decedent has children and leaves a will, it is unlawful for the testator to override the legitime by special gift which exhausts the estate or by designating his spouse or other person as sole beneficiary. This is known as &quot;preterition&quot; when arising by omission and &quot;disinheritance&quot; when heirs are expressly deprived.

==English common law==
In English common law, there is no legitime; the Statute of Wills (32 Hen. 8. c. 1), provided for the unfettered distribution of a decedent&#x27;s entire estate; a testator is entitled to disinherit any and all of his children, for any reason and for no reason. Most jurisdictions in the United States have enacted statutes that prohibit a testator from disinheriting a spouse, or provided that in the event of such a will the spouse may elect to &quot;take against the will&quot; and claim a statutory share of a decedent&#x27;s estate. This is done as a substitute for the common law rights of dower and curtesy.

It is generally not possible to disinherit a minor dependent child.

== In certain jurisdictions ==

=== Brazil ===

In Brazil, the descendants (alternatively, the parents or grandparents) and the spouse must receive at least 50% of it among themselves.

=== Czech Republic ===


In the Czech Republic, the nearest descendants can require 1/4 of their intestacy portion if they are of age or 3/4 of their intestacy portion if they are under age. (If a child of the deceased died before him, his children can claim forced share instead of him etc.)
=== Greece ===

In Greece, the descendants and the spouse must receive at least 50% of the share that they would have received if the decedent died intestate, that is half of what they would receive under default rules.

=== Louisiana ===
In Louisiana, until the passing of Act No. 788 of 1989, the situation was different. Formerly, in Louisiana the legitime operated to prevent a parent from wholly disinheriting his children, who were and are still called forced heirs. If the decedent left issue in the form of one child, that issue must receive at least 25% of the decedent&#x27;s estate. If there were two or more children, they must receive at least 50% of it among themselves. Similar provisions prevented a decedent with living parents from disinheriting them.

Post-1989 Louisiana law provides for a forced share only if the decedent&#x27;s children are under 24 years of age, or are permanently unable to take care of themselves, referred to as interdicted or subject to interdiction. Otherwise, a decedent&#x27;s issue may be wholly disinherited. This change is essentially the importation of the common law doctrine of freedom of testation, but stops short of fully abolishing forced heirship because that is expressly forbidden by Louisiana Constitution Article XII, Section 5.

=== Scotland ===

In Scotland, &quot;legitim&quot; is the right of the issue (including adult issue) to not less than a defined share of the value of the moveable estate of the deceased. The share is one half, if the deceased left no relict (widow or widower), or one third if there was a relict. For example, if a testator has two children, and no spouse, and in her/his testament leaves everything to one of them, the other would be entitled to half of the legitim fund, which means a half of a half of the total net value of the moveable estate. (Or half of a third if there were a spouse.) Legitim is also called the bairn&#x27;s pairt or part of gear (Scots &quot;bairn&quot; ‘child’).

=== Philippines ===


Under the Civil Code of the Philippines, the legitime is given to and/or shared by the compulsory heirs of the decedent. This is also called &quot;compulsory succession&quot; because the law has reserved it for the compulsory heirs and thus, the testator has no power to give it away to anyone of his liking. The compulsory heirs include the children, or descendants (this class includes the adopted children and legitimated children), legitimate or illegitimate; in their default, the legitimate parents, or legitimate ascendants; the surviving spouse, which concurs with the foregoing classes; and the illegitimate parents.

Thus, legitimate children always get one half of the estate, divided equally between them. The surviving spouse gets a share equal to that of a legitimate child, except when there is only one legitimate child, in which case he or she gets one fourth of the estate. Illegitimate children get one half of the share given to legitimate children.

The legitimate parents or ascendants are excluded by legitimate children or descendants, but not by illegitimate children, and get one half of the estate in such cases. The surviving spouse or illegitimate children, when either concur with the parents or ascendants, get one fourth of the estate. If all concur, the share of the surviving spouse is reduced to one eighth of the estate.

The surviving spouse gets one half of the estate when there are no other heirs, and in certain cases, when the marriage is &quot;in articulo mortis&quot;, he or she gets one third. The surviving spouse also gets one third of the estate when concurring with illegitimate children, who also get the same share. However, the surviving spouse gets one fourth when concurring with illegitimate parents, who also get one fourth of the estate.

The illegitimate children, in default of everyone, get one half of the estate. The illegitimate parents, who are excluded by everyone except the surviving spouse, also get one half in default of everyone.

<text>The Middle Ages in Romania began shortly after the withdrawal of the Roman legions from the former Roman province of Dacia in the late 3rd century and with the start of the Early Middle Ages and the Migration Period that followed afterwards respectively. It subsequently came to an end with the reign of Domn Michael the Brave (1593–1601) who managed, for a short time between 1599 and 1600, to rule Wallachia, Moldavia, and Transylvania together, the three principalities whose territories were to be united some three centuries later to form modern and contemporary Romania. 

Over most of this period, Banat, Crișana, Maramureș, and Transylvania – now regions in Romania to the west of the Carpathian Mountains – were part of the Kingdom of Hungary. They were divided into several types of administrative units, such as &quot;counties&quot; and &quot;seats&quot;. The heads of the Transylvanian counties or &quot;counts&quot; were subordinated to a special royal official called &quot;voivode&quot;, but the province was seldom treated as a single unit, since the Székely and Saxon seats were administered separately. In the kingdom, Romanian peasants, being Orthodox, were exempt from the tithe, an ecclesiastical tax payable by all Roman Catholic commoners. However, Romanian noblemen slowly lost the ability to participate in political life, as the 14th-century monarchs pursued a zealous pro-Catholic policy. Their position became even worse after 1437 when the so-called &quot;Union of Three Nations&quot;, an alliance of the Hungarian noblemen, the Székelys, and the Saxons, was formed in order to crush the Bobâlna peasant uprising.

Wallachia, the first independent medieval state between the Carpathians and the lower Danube was created when Basarab I (&quot;&quot; 1310–1352) terminated the suzerainty of the King of Hungary with his victory in the battle of Posada in 1330. The independence of Moldavia, to the east of the Carpathians, was achieved by Bogdan I (1359–1365), a nobleman from the Voivodeship of Maramureș, who led a revolt against the former ruler who was appointed by the Hungarian monarch. The independence of the two principalities, however, was rarely secure, and vassalage to multiple states became an important aspect of their diplomacy. Although Wallachia paid tribute to the Ottoman Empire from 1417, and Moldavia from 1456, their two medieval monarchs, Mircea the Old of Wallachia (1386–1418) and Stephen the Great of Moldavia (1457–1504) conducted successful military operations against the Ottoman Turks. The two principalities&#x27; trade with other parts of Europe began to decrease after the last decades of the 15th century. Before this the sale of hides, grain, honey, and wax to the Holy Roman Empire, Venice, and Poland, and the import of silk, weapons and other manufactured goods from these areas had been widespread, but by the end of the 16th century the Ottoman Empire became the main market for Romanian products.

Transylvania, together with the neighboring counties, gained the status of an autonomous state under Ottoman suzerainty after the central territories of the Kingdom of Hungary had been annexed by the Ottomans in 1541. The fall of the kingdom also deprived Wallachia and Moldavia of their main ally in the struggle against the Ottoman Empire. In 1594, Michael the Brave of Wallachia joined the anti-Ottoman alliance initiated by Pope Clement VIII. After a series of victory over the Ottomans, he turned against Transylvania and Moldavia where pro-Polish and pro-Ottoman princes were reigning. He invaded and occupied Transylvania in 1599, and Moldavia in 1600. Although the personal union of the three countries collapsed four months later, it served as an ideal for later generations working for the unification of the lands that now form Romania.

== Early Middle Ages (late 8th century–early 13th century) ==

At the end of the 8th century the establishment of the Khazar Khaganate north of the Caucasus Mountains created an obstacle in the path of nomadic people moving westward. In the following period, the local population of the Carpathian–Danubian area profited from the peaceful political climate and a unitary material culture, called &quot;Dridu&quot;, that developed in the region. Finds from the &quot;Dridu&quot; settlements, such as coulters and sickles, confirm the role of agriculture in their economy.

In the 9th century centrifugal movements commenced in the Khazar Kaghanate. One of the subject peoples, the Hungarians left its dominion and settled in the region between the rivers Don and Dniester. They abandoned the steppes and crossed the Carpathians around 896. According to the 13th-century &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; (&quot;Deeds of the Hungarians&quot;) at the time of the Hungarian conquest, Transylvania was inhabited by &quot;Bulaqs and Slavs&quot; (&quot;blasij et sclaui&quot;) and ruled by Gelou, &quot;a certain Vlach&quot; (&quot;quidam&quot; &quot;blacus&quot;), while Crișana was inhabited by several peoples, among them Székelys. Whether the author of the &quot;Gesta&quot; had any knowledge of the real conditions of the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries remains debated by historians. 

In 953, the &quot;gyula&quot;, the second leader in rank of the Hungarian tribal federation, converted to Christianity in Constantinople. Around that time, according to the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, the Hungarians controlled the region on the border of modern Romania and Hungary along the rivers Timiș, Mureș, Criș, Tisa and &quot;Toutis&quot;. In 1003, as the &quot;Annals of Hildesheim&quot; narrates, Stephen I, the first crowned monarch of Hungary (&quot;c.&quot; 1000–1038) &quot;led an army against his maternal uncle, Gyula, and occupied Gyula&#x27;s country.

Stephen I granted privileges to the Roman Catholic Church, for example by ordering the general imposition of the tithe upon the population. Burials in most local pre-Christian cemeteries, for example at Hunedoara, only ceased around 1100. Stephen I also divided his kingdom, including the territories of modern Romania he had occupied, into counties, that is administrative units around royal fortresses, each administered by a royal official called count. In time the &quot;voivode&quot;, a higher royal official first attested in 1176, became the principal of all the counts in Transylvania. In contrast with Transylvania, the counts in modern Banat and Crișana remained in direct contact with the king who appointed and replaced them at will.

From the end of the 9th century the Pechenegs controlled the territories to the east and south of the Carpathians. According to the &quot;Eymund&#x27;s saga&quot;, they fought together with the &quot;Blökkumen&quot; (&quot;Romanians&quot;) in the Kievan Rus&#x27; in the 1010s. The Pechenegs were swept aside from their territories by the Cumans between 1064 and 1078. A late variant of the oldest Turkish chronicle, the &quot;Oghuz-name&quot; relates that the Cumans defeated many nations, including the &quot;Ulâq&quot; (&quot;Romanians&quot;). Some of the Pechenegs fled into the Kingdom of Hungary where they were employed to guard the border districts, for instance in Transylvania.

The 11th-century settlements in Transylvania are characterized by small huts with ceramic assemblages marked by clay cauldrons. The increasing number of coin finds suggests that the province experienced economic growth in the late 11th century. The first document pertaining to the province is a royal charter of 1075 referring to taxes on salt levied at Turda. The earliest precious metal mine in medieval Transylvania, the silver mine at Rodna was first mentioned in 1235.

In the 12th and 13th centuries &quot;hospites&quot; (&quot;guest settlers&quot;) arrived in Transylvania from Germany and from the French-speaking regions on the river Rhine who in time became collectively known as &quot;Saxons&quot;. In 1224 Andrew II of Hungary (1205–1235) granted special liberties to the Saxons who had settled in southern Transylvania. For instance, they were authorized to choose their local leaders; only the head of the entire community, the count of Sibiu, was appointed by the king. They were also granted the right to use &quot;the forest of the Romanians and the Pechenegs&quot;. The first references to viniculture in Transylvania are connected to the vineyards of the &quot;hospites&quot; of Cricău, Ighiu, and Romos.

As a result of the Saxon immigration, the Székelys – Hungarian-speaking free warriors cultivating communal lands – were transferred to the southeast of the province. From the 13th century they were governed independently from the &quot;voivode&quot; by a royal official, the count of the Székelys. Besides the Saxons, the Cistercians became the agents of expansion in Transylvania. When their abbey at Cârța was established in the early 13th century, Andrew II ordered that the strip of land running up to the mountains between the rivers Olt, Cârțișoara and Arpaș be transferred from the Romanians to the new monastery.

Following the defeat of the Cumans by the Mongols on the river Kalka in 1223, some chieftains of the western Cuman tribes accepted the authority of the king of Hungary. Their conversion led to the creation of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cumania to the east of the Carpathians. However, the Orthodox Romanian population of the territory received the sacraments from &quot;some pseudo-bishops of the Greek rite&quot;, according to a papal bull of 1234. In 1233 Oltenia was organized into a military frontier zone of the Kingdom of Hungary, called the Banate of Severin.

The expansion across the Carpathians was stopped by the invasion of the Mongols that lasted from March 31, 1241 to April, 1242. It was a major watershed in the medieval history of the region: although the number of casualties is disputed, even the most prudent estimates do not go below 15 percent of the total population.

== High Middle Ages (1242–1396) ==

=== Outer-Carpathian regions ===

After the withdrawal from the Kingdom of Hungary, the Mongol forces halted at Sarai (now Russia) on the Volga River where their leader, Batu Khan set up his own capital. Henceforth, the steppes between the rivers Dnieper and Danube were under the influence of the Mongols of the Volga, known as the Golden Horde. From the 1260s, a relative of Batu, Nogai Khan settled at Isaccea on the Lower Danube and became the absolute master of the neighboring regions. He made himself independent of the Golden Horde around 1280, but was killed in a battle in 1299.

By the middle of the 14th century, the westernmost Mongol territories had become subject to frequent Polish and Hungarian military offensives. Grand Prince Olgierd of Lithuania penetrated farther into the territories controlled by the Golden Horde than any European army had hitherto done. He won a major victory over the united Mongol troops on the Dnieper near the Black Sea in 1363.

=== Intra-Carpathian regions ===


Having been raided twice by the Mongols within a single year, Transylvania felt the consequences of the invasion of 1241–1242 for more than two decades. The administrative centers of the province, such as Alba Iulia and Cetatea de Baltă, had been destroyed. Due to the severe depopulation, a process of organized colonization commenced that lasted for several decades. For example, a new wave of colonization resulted in the establishment of the Saxon seats of Sighișoara and Mediaș; and the lord of Ilia received, in 1292, royal permission to settle Romanians in the lands he owned.

Since only castles built of stone and walled towns had been able to resist Mongol attacks, following the withdrawal of the Mongols the kings encouraged both the landowners and the townspeople to build stone fortifications. New stone fortresses were built, for example, at Codlea, Rimetea, and Unguraș. The process of urbanization was characterized by the predominance of the Saxon towns: out of the eight towns in Transylvania, only Alba Iulia and Dej were situated in the counties. A charter referring to inns, bakeries, and bathhouses in Rodna proves the city-like way of life of its inhabitants. Salt was still the most important item of trade in this period, but trading with oxen, maidservants, and wine is also documented in royal charters.

In 1257, Béla IV of Hungary (1235–1270) appointed his eldest son, the future Stephen V (1270–1272) to govern the kingdom&#x27;s territories to the east of the Danube. Here the younger king ceded a significant part of his royal domains to noblemen. The first years of the reign of Ladislaus IV of Hungary (1272–1290), were characterized by civil wars throughout the entire kingdom. In Transylvania, the Saxons engaged in a local conflict with the bishop, took Alba Iulia and set fire to the cathedral. The series of wars continued in 1285 with a second Mongol invasion. During its initial stage, the Székelys, the Romanians and the Saxons successfully blocked the Mongols&#x27; access and later organized a series of ambushes provoking panic among the retreating invaders.

By that time, the Romanians&#x27; military role had expanded from their original task of defending the kingdom&#x27;s frontiers. They participated in several military campaigns, for example against Bohemia in 1260 and against Austria in 1291. Their economic role became also recognized, since their pastoral activities connected to cloth production of the Saxon settlements. To the monarchs, they paid a special tax in sheep, called the &quot;fiftieth&quot;. Andrew III of Hungary (1290–1301) even ordered, in 1293, that all the Romanians who had been settled without royal permission on noble domains be returned to the royal estate of Armeni.

In the last decades of the 13th century, &quot;congregatio generalis&quot; (&quot;general assembly&quot;) convoked by the monarchs or their representatives became an important organ of court system. For instance, the general assembly convoked in 1279 by Ladislaus IV for seven counties – among them Bihor, Crasna, Sătmar, and Zărand in the territory what is now Romania – ended with sentencing a despotic person to death. The first charter referring to a general assembly of the Transylvanian counties was recorded in 1288. A general assembly of the Transylvanian nobles, Saxons, Székelys and Romanians was convoked personally by the monarch in 1291.

When Andrew III died in 1301, the entire kingdom was in the hands of a dozen powerful noblemen. Among them, Roland Borsa ruled Crișana, Theodore Vejtehi gained the upper hand in the Banat, and Ladislaus Kán governed Transylvania. The latter&#x27;s authority was also recognized by the Saxons and the Székelys. He even assumed royal prerogatives, such as taking over lands lacking rightful owners. After 1310, he acknowledged Charles I of Hungary (1301–1342) as his sovereign, but in fact continued to rule independently. The king who transferred his residence to Timișoara in 1315 could only strengthen his authority after a long series of confrontations. For instance, Ciceu, the last stronghold of Ladislaus Kán&#x27;s sons surrendered in 1321.

After the king&#x27;s victory, one of his loyal adherents, Thomas Szécsényi was appointed &quot;voivode&quot; who suppressed a Saxon revolt in 1324. At that time, the autonomous Saxon province was divided into seats, each administered by a judge appointed by the king. In appreciation of the Transylvanian noblemen&#x27;s services in the crushing of the revolt, Charles I exempted them from the taxes they had so far paid to the &quot;voivode&quot;s.

In this period, one of the major incentives for the growth of Transylvanian towns was the trade with Wallachia and Moldavia. For instance, Brașov was granted a staple right in 1369 with respect to the trade in cloth from Poland or Germany. Thereafter, foreign merchants had to sell their most sought-after merchandise, broadcloth to the tradesmen of Brașov who resold it in Wallachia in exchange for animals, cotton, wax and honey.

In the 14th century, the name &quot;district&quot; was generalized for the forms of territorial organizations of the Romanians, but only few of them, for instance their district in Bereg County (now in Hungary and Ukraine), achieved official recognition. Maramureș, where Romanians were first mentioned in 1326, was the only district that transformed, around 1380, into a county. Louis I of Hungary (1342–1382) issued a royal decree in 1366 which prescribed firm judicial measures against &quot;the malefactors of any nation, especially Romanians&quot;.

Louis I&#x27;s decree also regulated the legal status of the &quot;knezes&quot;, the Romanians&#x27; local leaders, by establishing a distinction between &quot;knezes&quot; &quot;brought to&quot; their lands by royal writ whose testimony in court weighed like that of nobles (&quot;noble &quot;knezes&quot;&quot;), and others whose evidence counted for less (&quot;commoner &quot;knezes&quot;&quot;). This distinction, however, did not mean real nobility and grant them exemption from royal taxes, even for the noble &quot;knezes&quot;. Their status corresponded to that of the Hungarian &quot;conditional nobles&quot; whose nobility depended on the specified military services they were to render.

According to a royal decree of 1428, Louis I had also ordered that only Catholics be granted land in the Sebeș district of Timiș county. As a result of official pressure, many Romanian noblemen converted to Catholicism. For example, the members of the powerful Drágffy family turned Catholic in the 15th century. The Ottomans raided Transylvania for the first time in 1394. Sigismund I of Hungary (1387–1437) organized a crusade against them, but the battle of Nicopolis (now Nikopol, Bulgaria) ended in disaster for the Christian forces in 1396.

=== Establishment of Wallachia ===

According to a charter issued by Béla IV of Hungary for the Knights Hospitallers in 1247, at that time at least four polities existed in the area to the south of the Carpathians. Two of them, the &quot;cnezat&quot;s of John and Farcaș were granted to the knights, but the lands ruled by Litovoi and Seneslau were left &quot;to the &quot;Olati&quot;&quot; (&quot;Romanians&quot;) &quot;just as they have owned it&quot;. In the 1270s, Litovoi extended his territory and stopped paying tribute to the king, but his army was defeated by the royal forces, and he was killed in the battle.

Romanian historical tradition associates the foundation of Wallachia with the &quot;dismounting of Radu Negru&quot; who crossed the Carpathians from Transylvania accompanied by &quot;Romanians, papists, Saxons, and all kind of men&quot; around 1290. The first sovereign of Wallachia recorded in contemporary sources was Basarab I who obtained international recognition for the independence of the principality by his victory over Charles I of Hungary in the battle of Posada on November 12, 1330. The princes of Wallachia were chosen from among his descendants – either legitimate, or not – by an assembly of the &quot;boyars&quot; until the 16th century.

The &quot;boyars&quot;, members of the landed nobility, formed the most important social group in the principality. The vast majority of the population was formed by peasants who were called several names, such as &quot;vecini&quot; (&quot;neighbors&quot;) or &quot;rumâni&quot; (&quot;Romanians&quot;), in medieval documents. In this period, animals, especially sheep, remained the main item of export, but from the Wallachian Plain great quantities of grain were transported to the Mediterranean area. The basis of the peasants&#x27; diet was formed by millet eaten as porridge, while the &quot;boyars&quot; also used wheat.

The Orthodox Metropolitan See of Wallachia was recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople in 1359. Wallachia issued its own currency under Vladislav I (1364– 1377). The earliest written information about Gypsies in modern Romania, a deed issued by Dan I of Wallachia (&quot;c.&quot; 1383–1386) refers to Vladislav I&#x27;s former donation of Gypsies to the Vodița monastery. Later on, all the important monasteries and &quot;boyars&quot; owned Gipsy slaves.

The Ottomans entered for the first time into Wallachia in 1395. Although the invading troops were defeated somewhere in a &quot;rovină&quot; (&quot;ragged marshland&quot;) in Oltenia, the chaos created by the threat of attacks allowed a group of &quot;boyars&quot; to put Vlad I the Usurper (1395–1397) on the throne. Thus Mircea I was forced to take refuge in Transylvania, where he agreed to be Sigismund I of Hungary&#x27;s vassal. He was restored to the throne and participated in the disastrous crusade of Nicopolis organized by Sigismund I.

=== Establishment of Moldavia ===

After 1241 the territory between the Eastern Carpathians and the Dniester was controlled by the Golden Horde.

Nevertheless, the contemporary Thomas Tuscus&#x27;s reference to the Romanians&#x27; conflict with the Ruthenians in 1277 suggests that Romanian political entities existed in northern Moldavia at that time. In 1345 Andrew Lackfi, the count of the Székelys led an army over the Carpathians and occupied this region where a border province was organized by Louis I of Hungary.

Romanian historical tradition links the foundation of Moldavia to the &quot;dismounting of Dragoș&quot;, a Romanian &quot;voivode&quot; of the Voivodeship of Maramureș. Although Dragoș was succeeded by his son, Sas, his line did not last long. His descendants were soon expelled by Bogdan, a former &quot;voivode&quot; of Maramureș who fled to Moldavia and joined with local &quot;boyars&quot; in a revolt.

In Moldavia, agriculture and animal raising remained the principal economic activities. Similarly to Wallachia, wooden plow remained the main agricultural tool throughout the Middle Ages. The constant clearing of land shows that finding new land was still preferred to crop rotation. The establishment of the principality enhanced the security of travel, thus Moldavia could also profit from the transit trade between Poland and the Black Sea ports. The first local coins were minted in 1377, under Peter I Mușat (&quot;c.&quot; 1375–1391).

The succession to the throne, similarly to Wallachia, was governed by the hereditary-elective principle. Thus either a legitimate or an illegitimate member of the Mușatin family could be proclaimed prince by an assembly of the &quot;boyars&quot;. In 1387 Peter I Mușat recognized Władysław II Jagiełło of Poland as his suzerain, but Hungary also maintained its claim of suzerainty over the principality.
 Therefore, the princes of Moldavia could counterbalance the influence of Poland and Hungary by playing one off against the other.

=== Dobruja ===

After 1242 most of the territory between the Danube and the Black Sea was included in the area dominated by the Mongols. Although the Byzantine Empire reestablished control over the Danube Delta in the 1260s, it fell again under the direct rule of the Golden Horde sometime before 1337. By the end of the 13th century, flourishing communities of Genoese merchants had settled in the towns of Vicina, Chilia and Licostomo.

Towards the middle of the 14th century a state dependent of the Byzantine Empire, known as &quot;the country of Cavarna&quot;, developed in the region. Its first known ruler was Balica. He was succeeded by his brother, Dobrotitsa, for whom part of his holdings, Dobruja, received its name. In about 1385 Ivanco became the ruler of the territory, but he soon disappeared during an Ottoman expedition. Dobruja was occupied by Mircea I of Wallachia in 1390 and by the Ottomans in 1395.

== Towards Ottoman domination (1397–1529) ==

=== Intra-Carpathian regions ===
In order to establish a zone of buffer states, Sigismund I of Hungary tried to draw the neighboring Orthodox rulers under his own suzerainty by granting them estates in his kingdom. For example, Stefan Lazarević of Serbia received Satu Mare, Baia Mare and Baia Sprie in modern Romania, and Mircea I of Wallachia was granted Făgăraș. Sigismund I was also the first monarch who recognized, in 1419, the legislative competence of the Estates in Transylvania. On his initiative, their assembly declared that in case of an Ottoman attack, every third nobleman and every tenth serf would take up arms. Indeed, from 1420 Ottoman attacks occurred on an annual basis. In this period many Saxon churches, and later the Székely churches of the Ciuc region, were fortified, which gave local architecture a distinctive appearance.

The increasing defense costs fell primarily on the serfs: the rent on the land was raised and extraordinary taxes were imposed. The first peasant revolt in the territory of modern Romania broke out due to the efforts taken by the bishop of Transylvania to collect the church taxes. Led by Anton Budai Nagy, the rebellious peasants, who called themselves &quot;the commune of the rightful Hungarian and Romanian inhabitants of this part of Transylvania&quot;, established a fortified camp on the Bobâlna hill early in 1437. They fought two important battles against the noblemen; the first one, at Bobâlna, was won by the peasants, and the second one, near the Apatiu River, had no clear winner. The leaders of the noblemen, the Saxons and the Székelys, however, set up a &quot;brotherly union&quot; in order to join forces and crushed the peasants&#x27; resistance by the end of January 1438.

The Ottomans&#x27; attempt to conquer new territories led to a better organized policy against them. The temporary union of the Eastern and Western Churches proclaimed by the Council of Florence in 1439 also created a favorable background for the concentration of Christian forces. Christendom found its champion in John Hunyadi who gained a series of victories over the Ottomans after 1441. For instance, in 1442 he routed an Ottoman army that had been devastating Transylvania. Through his last victory over Mehmed II at the siege of Belgrade (in modern Serbia) in 1456, he saved the kingdom from Ottoman occupation for several decades. During the reign of his son, Matthias I of Hungary (1458–1490), the Ottomans launched only one serious attack against Transylvania in 1479 when they were defeated at Câmpul Pâinii.

Matthias I used his officials to assert royal prerogatives that had already fallen into disuse. The noblemen found it particularly irksome that the &quot;lucrum camarae&quot;, a tax from which they had been exempted was replaced with a new tax. In Transylvania, the &quot;Three Nations&quot; entered into a formal alliance against the king in 1467, but he quickly intervened and took the disorganized rebels by surprise.

By that time, the land once held in common by the Székely community had gradually become divided into smaller and smaller units; thus a vast number of the free warrior-peasants had to enter the service of their more prosperous fellow Székelys. This social stratification was formally recognized by a royal decree in 1473. Thereafter those who performed mounted military service were differentiated from those who fought as foot-soldiers; those who were unable to finance themselves even as foot-soldiers were legally reduced to servitude.

The prominence of the German element in the towns sometimes led to conflicts along ethnic lines. Thus the struggle for leadership in Cluj (now Cluj-Napoca) between Hungarians and Saxons only came to an end in 1458 by establishing a rule that municipal offices must be shared equally between the two groups. In 1486, Matthias I united all the Saxon districts in Transylvania in the &quot;University of the Saxons&quot; under the leadership of the elected mayor of Sibiu.

After Matthias I&#x27;s death, the assembly of the Estates, called Diet, began to function as a regular organ of power. The peasantry suffered most from the rule of the Estates, for instance, by the limitation of their right to free movement. In 1514 thousands of peasants who had been summoned to Buda (now Budapest, in modern Hungary) to join the crusade proclaimed by Pope Leo X against the Ottomans turned the weapons against their masters. The rebels, led by the Székely George Dózsa, occupied several towns, such as Oradea and Șoimoș, but on July 15 John Szapolyai, the &quot;voivode&quot; defeated them at Timișoara. As a retaliation, the Diet decreed that peasants were to be tied to the land &quot;perpetually&quot;.

The downfall of the Kingdom of Hungary was marked by the battle of Mohács (Hungary) where the royal army was annihilated by the Ottomans on August 29, 1526. Thereafter the noblemen&#x27;s political factions engaged in conflict and elected two kings. One of them, John I Szapolyai (1526–1540) was supported by the lesser nobility, while Ferdinand I of Habsburg (1526–1564) was recognized mainly in the kingdom&#x27;s western counties, but the Transylvanian Saxons also supported him. Seeking the assistance of the Ottomans, John I had to pay homage to the sultan at Mohács in 1529.

=== Wallachia ===
After the battle of Nicopolis, the Ottomans occupied Bulgaria and could attack Wallachia more easily. Mircea I the Old, however, could reoccupy Dobruja in 1402 by taking advantage of the Ottomans&#x27; difficulties after their defeat by Timur Lenk in the battle of Ankara. He even intervened in the Ottoman civil war and supported the struggle of Musa and Mustafa against their brother, Mehmed I. After the two pretenders had been defeated, the Ottomans annexed again Dobruja and occupied Giurgiu, and Mircea I was forced to pay an annual tribute to the sultan. Under Mircea I iron mines were opened at Baia de Fier and copper mining began at Baia de Aramă. In addition, sulfur and amber were extracted in the region of Buzău.

After Mircea I&#x27;s death, princes succeeded one another on the throne with devastating frequency. For instance, Michael I (1418–1420) was overthrown by his cousin, Dan II (1420–1431), and in the next decade the throne was occupied with frequent changes either by Dan II or by his cousin, Radu II the Bald (1421–1427), the former being supported by Sigismund I of Hungary and the latter by the Ottomans.

Alexander I Aldea (1431–1436) was the first Romanian ruler to be forced to render military service to the Ottomans. Two decades later, Vlad III the Impaler (1448, 1456–1462, 1476), notorious as the model for the Dracula legend, turned against the Ottoman Empire. He carried out a series of attacks across the Danube in the winter of 1461–1462. The response was a massive invasion led by Mehmed II who drove Vlad III from the throne and replaced him with his brother, Radu III the Fair (1462–1475). Due to the frequent military operations, the Wallachian Plain was heavily depopulated after the end of the 14th century. On the other hand, Wallachia received a steady flow of immigrants, mostly from the Balkans.

After 1462 Wallachia preserved its autonomy mainly through the intervention of Stephen the Great of Moldavia. At the end of the century, however, Radu IV the Great (1495–1508) became an obedient subject of the sultan and visited Istanbul annually to personally offer the tribute. Even so, he could only stay in power by collaborating with the powerful Craiovești family, strongly connected to the Ottomans by trading. In 1512 a member of this family, Neagoe (1512–1521) rose to throne, but he adopted the dynastic name of Basarab in order to legitimize his rule. He wrote the first original work of Romanian literature, titled &quot;Teachings&quot;, to his son, Teodosius on moral, political, and military questions.

Under Theodosius I (1521–1522) the Ottoman governor of Nicopolis take advantage of the internal fights among the &quot;boyar&quot; parties, and thus dominated the political life of Wallachia. Due to the imminent danger of annexation, the &quot;boyars&quot; grouped around Radu V of Afumați (1522–1529) who fought about 20 battles against the Ottomans. Finally, he was, in 1525, forced to accept Ottoman suzerainty and the rise of the tribute.

=== Moldavia ===

The Orthodox Metropolitan See of Moldavia was recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarch during the reign of Alexander I the Good (1400–1432). He reinforced Moldavia&#x27;s traditional pro-Polish orientation and declared himself a vassal of Władysław II of Poland in 1406. Thenceforth, the Moldavian armies fought together with the Poles against the Teutonic Knights. The first Ottoman attack on Moldavia in 1420 was also repulsed by him. Alexander I&#x27;s death was followed by a long period of political instability, characterized by frequent fights for the throne. For instance, the struggle of his sons, Iliaș I (1432–1442) and Stephen II (1433–1447) ended in 1435 by the division of the country.

Although cottage industries, both in &quot;boyar&quot; and peasant households, were still the main source of clothing, food and construction, specialized production, such as weaving and pottery, started to develop by the middle of the 15th century. The first oil wells went into production in 1440, but their oil was also only for household use. In Moldavia, Gypsy slaves were first mentioned in 1428 when Alexander I awarded 31 Gypsy families to the Bistrița Monastery. In time Gypsies became specialized in several crafts: for example, throughout the Middle Ages the working of iron was an occupation reserved almost exclusively for them.

Peter III Aaron (1451–1457) was the first prince who agreed to pay tribute to the Ottomans in 1456.
 He was ousted by his nephew, Stephen, with the support of Vlad the Impaler of Wallachia. Stephen III the Great was to be the most important medieval Romanian monarch who managed to uphold Moldavia&#x27;s autonomy against Hungary, Poland and the Ottoman Empire.
In the early years of his reign, he remained allied with Poland and the Ottoman Empire, and even joined the Ottomans in attacking Wallachia. He also supported the rebellion of 1467 of the Transylvanian Estates; therefore Matthias I of Hungary launched an expedition against Moldavia, but the royal army was defeated in the battle of Baia.
 He came to view the Ottoman Empire as his chief enemy in the 1470s, and in 1474 he refused to pay tribute. He soon received the ultimatum of Mehmed II who demanded the surrender of Chilia, a fortress recently captured from Wallachia. Upon Stephen III&#x27;s refusal, a large Ottoman army was sent against Moldavia. He called on Pope Sixtus IV, pleading for a crusade. Although the pope acknowledged his merits, by naming him &quot;the Athlete of Christ&quot;, no anti-Ottoman coalition materialized. Even without external military support, Stephen the Great led his troops to victory in the battle of Vaslui on January 10, 1475. Following the battle, he addressed a letter to the Christian princes, expressing the idea that the two Romanian principalities were the &quot;gateway to the Christian world&quot;, and if they fell &quot;all Christendom would be in danger&quot;.

He also recognized Matthias I of Hungary as his suzerain and received, in return, Ciceu and Cetatea de Baltă in Transylvania. The following year, however, he found himself alone when Mehmed II invaded Moldavia. The Moldavian army was defeated in the Battle of Valea Albă, but the Ottomans, suffering from a lack of provisions and an outbreak of the plague, were forced to retreat. Stephen the Great suffered the greatest setback of his reign in 1484 when the Ottomans captured Chilia and Cetatea Alba (now Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, Ukraine) on the Black Sea. Having tried unsuccessfully to regain the fortresses in 1485, he concluded a peace with the sultan and agreed to pay tribute to him.

He was succeeded by his son, Bogdan III the One-Eyed (1504–1517) whose reign was troubled by a long series of military conflicts with Poland and Wallachia. The good relations with Poland were reestablished under the reign of Stephen IV the Younger (1517–1527). His successor, Peter IV Rareș (1527–1538, 1541–1546) intervened in the struggle for the crown of the Kingdom of Hungary: on the order of the sultan, in 1529 he invaded the Székely Land and defeated the army of Ferdinand I&#x27;s partisans.

== Ottoman suzerainty (1530–1594) ==

=== Establishment of Principality of Transylvania ===

After 1529, resistance to John I in Transylvania was broken in a series of small campaigns. For instance, the last Transylvanian magnate to side with Ferdinánd I, Stephen Majláth went over to John I in early 1532, and Sibiu was occupied in 1536. On February 24, 1538, a secret pact was signed in Oradea by the representatives of the two kings of Hungary. According to the treaty, both rulers were allowed to retain the territories which they then held, but the childless John I promised to recognize the Habsburgs&#x27; succession.
However, John I married a daughter of Sigismund I of Poland, Isabella, who in 1540 bore him a son. Already dying, the king took an oath from his barons to evade the treaty of Oradea, and his counselor, George Martinuzzi, had the infant John II Sigismund elected as king (1540–1571). Ferdinand I sent troops to take Buda, but they withdrew upon the advance of the Ottoman army. On August 29, 1541 Suleiman I summoned the Hungarian lords to his camp, and while the reception was taking place, his troops occupied the capital of the kingdom. At the same time the sultan assigned the territories of the kingdom east of the Tisa to Queen Isabella and her son in return for an annual tribute.

On October 18, the kingdom&#x27;s eastern territories, including Transylvania, swore allegiance to the infant king at the Diet of Debrecen (Hungary). Thus a separate country started to emerge, although George Martinuzzi was still negotiating with Ferdinand I on the reunification of the kingdom. For this purpose, in 1551 Ferdinand I sent an army into Transylvania where he was recognized as sole ruler by the Diet. The Ottomans, however, occupied a great part of Banat in 1552, and neither could Ferdinand I consolidate his rule over the kingdom&#x27;s eastern territories. Finally, the Diet, meeting in Sebeș on March 12, 1556, swore again allegiance to &quot;the son of King John&quot;, thus the young king and his mother returned to Transylvania.

The 16th century also brought about major religious changes: the Saxons converted to Lutheranism, while most of the Hungarians converted to Calvinism or Unitarianism; only the Székelys remained more than the other &quot;nations&quot; Catholic. In 1568, the Transylvanian Diet at Torda decreed the free worship of these four &quot;received denominations&quot;, but Orthodoxy still continued to be only tolerated. The Romanians&#x27; status worsened in this period. The Diets of 1554 and 1555 decided that a Catholic or Protestant peasant could not be accused of a crime except there were seven Catholic or Protestant witnesses against him, while an Orthodox peasant could be accused if there were three Catholic or Protestant or seven Orthodox witnesses. The Diet of 1559 also decreed that Romanians who had settled on lands abandoned by Catholic serfs were obliged to pay the tithe.


From the Székelys, continuing warfare demanded increased military service, and the royal administration imposed special taxes on them. Although the leaders of the Székely community were exempted from taxation in 1554, but all the foot soldiers continued to be taxed, resulting in a double burden of military and monetary obligations for them. In 1562 many Székelys took up arms against John II Sigismund, but they were defeated. The Saxon towns continued to develop even in the years of upheaval. Their population, however, increased slowly, mainly as a consequence of the Saxons&#x27; traditional desire for segregation: even Hungarian craftsmen and merchants were prohibited from settling in their towns.

In the Treaty of Speyer of August 16, 1570, John II Sigismund acknowledged his rival, Maximilian I (1564–1576) as the lawful king of Hungary and adopted the title of &quot;prince of Transylvania and parts of the Kingdom of Hungary&quot;. The treaty also marked out the borders of the new principality, which included not only the historical province of Transylvania, but also some neighboring counties, such as Bihor and Maramureș, thenceforward collectively known as Partium. The death of John II Sigismund in 1571 threatened to throw the country again into the hands of the Habsburgs whose officers supported the Unitarian Gáspár Bekes. Now the sultan appointed Stephen Báthory, a Catholic politician, &quot;voivode&quot;.

The decisive battle between the two candidates was won by Stephen Báthory at Sânpaul on July 8, 1575. In the same year, he was elected king of Poland, thus a personal union was formed between the two countries that lasted until his death in 1586. He left the administration of the principality first to his brother, Christopher Báthory (1575–1581), and then to his brother&#x27;s minor son, Sigismund Báthory (1581–1602), bestowing on them the title of &quot;voivode&quot;, while he himself took the title of prince.

In February, 1594 Sigismund Báthory announced that his country would join the anti-Ottoman alliance formed by the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf II, Philip II of Spain and many smaller Italian and German states. Although the Estates twice refused to endorse the declaration of war, Transylvania joined the alliance on January 28, 1595 after the leaders of the opposition had been executed on the order of the monarch. In return Rudolph II recognized Sigismund&#x27;s title of prince.

=== Wallachia ===
The short and unworthy reigns of Radu V&#x27;s successors only increased the crisis of Wallachia. Starting with Mircea the Shepherd (1545–1559), the first prince placed on the throne by the sultan, the crown became negotiable, according to the largest tribute offered. Even Michael the Brave who in time would turn against the Ottomans ascended the throne with the support of some people who had influence with the Sublime Porte, among them Sir Edward Barton, the English ambassador to Istanbul.

He soon embarked upon a program to strengthen the central authority by replacing the members of the &quot;sfatul domnesc&quot;, an advisory body consisting of &quot;boyars&quot;, with &quot;dregători&quot;, that is officials personally loyal to him. Michael the Brave also adopted an anti-Ottoman policy, and upon his initiative Sigismund Báthory of Transylvania and Aaron the Tyrant of Moldavia (1591–1595) signed a treaty to form an anti-Ottoman alliance. The rebellion started by the massacre of all the Ottomans in Wallachia on November 13, 1594.

=== Moldavia ===
In 1531 Peter IV Rareș invaded Poland in order to reoccupy the Pocuția region (in modern Ukraine), but his army was defeated. Now he concluded a secret treaty with Ferdinand I of Hungary, but soon had to seek refugee in Transylvania when Suleiman I led an army against him. This was the first occasion when a prince, Stephen V Lăcustă (1538–1540) was appointed by the sultan. At the same time, the sultan occupied Brăila and Tighina (now in Moldova), and the Budjak region (now in Ukraine). Peter IV Rareș recovered his throne in exchange for a large sum of money in 1541. His death was followed by a period characterized by fights between pretenders to the throne and among the &quot;boyar&quot; parties.

The idea of anti-Ottoman struggle was revived by John III the Terrible (1572–1574) who refused to pay the tribute to the sultan. As a result, Ottoman and Wallachian troops invaded Moldavia, but they were defeated by John III in a surprise attack near Jiliște. Now the sultan sent a large army against Moldavia, and the prince was captured and quartered. Next Aaron the Tyrant joined the anti-Ottoman coalition of Transylvania and Wallachia, and started a rebellion on November 13, 1594, simultaneously with Michael the Brave of Wallachia.

The 16th century was characterized by the flourishing of ecclesiastical mural painting whose technique have remained a secret until today. For example, the interior and exterior frescoes of the Voroneț Monastery represent this &quot;Moldavian style&quot;.

== Age of Michael the Brave (1595–1601) ==

Following their coordinated uprising, Michael the Brave attacked Ottoman strongholds along the Danube and recovered Giurgiu and Brăila, while Aaron the Tyrant seized Ismail (now in Ukraine). In response, the sultan ordered the Grand Vizier, Sinan Pasha to invade Wallachia. The two princes needed the support of Sigismund Báthory who took advantage of the situation to make himself suzerain of Wallachia and Moldavia. When Aaron the Tyrant refused Sigismund Báthory&#x27;s conditions, he was replaced by the latter&#x27;s protégé, Ștefan Răzvan (1595) on the throne.

According to the treaty signed by Michael the Brave on May 20, 1595 in Alba Iulia, Sigismund Báthory became the ruler of the three principalities and adopted the title of &quot;prince of Transylvania, Moldavia and Transalpine Wallachia&quot;. The treaty stipulated, that the taxes would be established in Wallachia by the Transylvanian Diet, together with a council of 12 Wallachian &quot;boyars&quot;. Around that time, the peasants were bound to the land both in Wallachia and Moldavia.

Ottoman troops entered Wallachia in the summer, but they were defeated by Michael the Brave at Călugăreni and by the united armies of the three principalities at Giurgiu. In the meantime, however, the Poles had invaded Moldavia and replaced Ștefan Răzvan by Ieremia Movilă (1595–1606). In June 1598 Michael the Brave recognized the suzerainty of Emperor Rudolph II, who had promised to grant subsidies to him to finance his mercenaries.

On March 30, 1599 Sigismund Báthory abdicated the throne in favor of his cousin, Andrew Báthory (1599). The new prince was loyal to the Poles and promptly demanded that Michael the Brave accept his suzerainty. The latter secured the emperor&#x27;s approval for an invasion of Transylvania and attacked the principality where the Székelys also joined him. He defeated his opponent at Șelimbăr on October 28, 1599 and entered Alba Iulia. Here the Diet recognized him as imperial governor. He respected the traditional organization of Transylvania, and even crushed a revolt of the Romanian peasants, but forced the Diet to relieve the Orthodox priests of feudal obligations. In the spring of 1600, he invaded Moldavia in the name of the emperor and established control over it. In July he even proclaimed himself &quot;prince of Wallachia, Transylvania, and all of Moldavia&quot; in Iași, thus bringing about the union of the three principalities.

However, the Hungarian noblemen, dissatisfied with the disorder, rebelled against his rule, and defeated him at Mirăslău on September 18, 1600. At the same time, the Poles invaded Moldavia and restored Ieremia Movilă to the throne; then they entered Wallachia, where Simion Movilă defeated Michael the Brave at Buzău. In this moment of crisis, Michael the Brave left for Prague to appeal to the emperor for support. He returned to Transylvania in July 1601 at the head of an imperial army. Cooperating with the imperial general, Giorgio Basta, he defeated the Transylvanian troops at Guruslău on August 3, but on August 19 he was assassinated on the order of his former ally, Giorgio Basta.

== After the first union ==

After Michael the Brave&#x27;s death, Transylvania was ruled by an imperial military commission, but under Stephen Bocskay (1604–1606) the principality voluntarily accepted Ottoman suzerainty. In the next decades, the princes of Transylvania, among them Gabriel Bethlen (1613–1629), made several unsuccessful attempts to unify Transylvania, Wallachia and Moldavia.

Wallachia and Moldavia fell back under the control of the Ottoman Empire after Michael the Brave&#x27;s death. Radu Mihnea, prince of Wallachia (1611–1616, 1623–1626) and of Moldavia (1616–1623), was the first ruler to appoint Greeks from the Phanar district of Istanbul to high government posts. This started a trend that ultimately led to the so-called &quot;Phanariot period&quot; in Romania&#x27;s history.

<text>The Kingdom of Romania () was a constitutional monarchy that existed from with the crowning of prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen as King Carol I (thus beginning the Romanian royal family), until 1947 with the abdication of King Michael I and the Romanian parliament&#x27;s proclamation of the Romanian People&#x27;s Republic.

From 1859 to 1877, Romania evolved from a personal union of two principalities: (Moldavia and Wallachia) called the Unification of Moldavia and Wallachia also known as &quot;The Little Union&quot; under a single prince to an autonomous principality with a Hohenzollern monarchy. The country gained its independence from the Ottoman Empire during the 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War (known locally as the Romanian War of Independence), after which it was forced to cede the southern part of Bessarabia in exchange for Northern Dobruja. The kingdom&#x27;s territory during the reign of King Carol I, between 13 (O.S.) / 25 March 1881 and 27 September (O.S.) / 10 October 1914 is sometimes referred to as the Romanian Old Kingdom, to distinguish it from &quot;Greater Romania&quot;, which included the provinces that became part of the state after World War I (Bessarabia, Banat, Bukovina, and Transylvania).

With the exception of the southern halves of Bukovina and Transylvania, these territories were ceded to neighboring countries in 1940, under the pressure of Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union. Following the abolishment of the 1923 constitution by King Carol II in 1938, the Kingdom of Romania became an absolute monarchy, only to become a military dictatorship under Ion Antonescu in 1940 after the forced abdication of King Carol II, with his successor, King Michael I being a figurehead with no effective political power. The country&#x27;s name was changed to Legionary Romania.

The disastrous World War II campaign on the side of the Axis powers led to King Michael&#x27;s Coup against Ion Antonescu in 1944, as a result of which the Kingdom of Romania became a constitutional monarchy again and switched sides to the Allies, recovering Northern Transylvania. The influence of the neighbouring Soviet Union and the policies followed by Communist-dominated coalition governments ultimately led to the abolition of the monarchy, with Romania becoming a Soviet satellite state as the People&#x27;s Republic of Romania on the last day of 1947.

==History==

===Unification and monarchy===

The 1859 ascendancy of Alexandru Ioan Cuza as prince of both Moldavia and Wallachia under the nominal suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire united an identifiably Romanian nation under a single ruler. On 24 January (O.S.) / 5 February 1862, the two principalities were formally united to form the Principality of Romania, with Bucharest as its capital.

On 11 (O.S.) / 23 February 1866 a so-called &quot;monstrous coalition&quot;, composed of Conservatives and radical Liberals, forced Cuza to abdicate. The German prince Charles of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen was appointed as Prince of Romania, in a move to assure German backing to unity and future independence. He immediately adopted the Romanian spelling of his name, Carol, and his cognatic descendants would rule Romania until the overthrow of the monarchy in 1947.

For more than a decade after the formal union of the two principalities, Romania was still nominally a vassal of the Ottoman Empire. However, this was increasingly a legal fiction. Romania had its own flag and anthem, and from 1867 had its own currency as well. Following the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, Romania was recognized as an independent state by the Treaty of Berlin, 1878 and acquired Dobruja, although it was forced to surrender southern Bessarabia (Budjak) to Russia. On 15 March 1881, as an assertion of full sovereignty, the Romanian parliament raised the country to the status of a kingdom, and Carol was crowned king on 10 May.

The new state, squeezed between the Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, and Russian Empires, with Slavic populations on its southwestern, southern, and northeastern borders, the Black Sea due east, and Hungarian neighbours on its western and northwestern borders, looked to the West, particularly France, for its cultural, educational, and administrative models.

Abstaining from the Initial Balkan War against the Ottoman Empire, the Kingdom of Romania entered the Second Balkan War in June 1913 against the Tsardom of Bulgaria. 330,000 Romanian troops moved across the Danube and into Bulgaria. One army occupied Southern Dobruja and another moved into northern Bulgaria to threaten Sofia, helping to bring an end to the war. Romania thus acquired the ethnically mixed territory of Southern Dobruja, which it had desired for years.

In 1916 Romania entered World War I on the Entente side. Romania engaged in a conflict against Bulgaria but as a result Bulgarian forces, after a series of successful battles, regained Dobruja, which had been previously ceded from Bulgaria by the treaty of Bucharest and the Berlin congress. Although the Romanian forces did not fare well militarily, by the end of the war the Austrian and Russian empires were gone; various assemblies proclaimed as representative bodies in Transylvania, Bessarabia and Bukovina decided on union with Romania. In 1919 by the Treaty of Saint-Germain and in 1920 by the Treaty of Trianon most of the territories claimed were assigned to Romania.

===Old Kingdom (1881–1918)===

The Romanian Old Kingdom ( or just &quot;Regat&quot;; or ) is a colloquial term referring to the territory covered by the first independent Romanian nation state, which was composed of the Danubian Principalities – Wallachia and Moldavia. It was achieved when, under the auspices of the Treaty of Paris (1856), the ad hoc Divans of both countries – which were under Imperial Ottoman suzerainty at the time – voted for Alexander Ioan Cuza as their prince, thus achieving a &quot;de facto&quot; unification. The region itself is defined by the result of that political act, followed by the inclusion of Northern Dobruja in 1878, the proclamation of the Kingdom of Romania in 1881, and the annexation of Southern Dobruja in 1913.

The term came into use after World War I, when the Old Kingdom was opposed to Greater Romania, which included Transylvania, Banat, Bessarabia, and Bukovina. Nowadays, the term is mainly of historical relevance, and is otherwise used as a common term for all regions in Romania included in both the Old Kingdom and present-day borders (namely: Wallachia, Moldavia, and Northern Dobruja).

===World War I===

Romania delayed in entering World War I, but ultimately declared war on the Central Powers in 1916. The Romanian military campaign ended in stalemate when the Central Powers quickly crushed the country&#x27;s offensive into Transylvania and occupied Wallachia and Dobruja, including Bucharest and the strategically important oil fields, by the end of 1916. In 1917, despite fierce Romanian resistance, especially at the Battle of Mărășești, due to Russia&#x27;s withdrawal from the war following the October Revolution, Romania, being almost completely surrounded by the Central Powers, was forced to also drop from the war, signing the Armistice of Focșani and next year, in May 1918, the Treaty of Bucharest. But after the successful offensive on the Thessaloniki front which put Bulgaria out of the war, Romania&#x27;s government quickly reasserted control and put an army back into the field on 10 November 1918, a day before the war ended in Western Europe. Following the proclamation of the union of Transylvania with the Kingdom of Romania on 1 December 1918 by the representatives of Transylvanian Romanians gathered at Alba Iulia, Transylvania was soon united with the Kingdom, as was Bessarabia earlier in 1918, since the power vacuum in Russia caused by the civil war there allowed the &quot;Sfatul Țării&quot;, or National Council, to proclaim the union of Bessarabia with Romania. War with the Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919 resulted in the occupation of Budapest by Romanian troops and the end of Béla Kun&#x27;s Bolshevik regime.

===Greater Romania===

====Union with Bessarabia, Bukovina and Transylvania====

At the Paris Peace Conference, Romania received the territories of Transylvania, part of Banat and other territories from Hungary, as well as Bessarabia (Eastern Moldavia between Prut and Dniester rivers) and Bukovina. In the Treaty of Trianon, Hungary renounced in favor of Romania all the claims of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy over Transylvania. The union of Romania with Bukovina was ratified in 1919 in the Treaty of Saint Germain, and in 1920 some of the Western powers recognized Romanian rule over Bessarabia by the Treaty of Paris. Thus, Romania in 1920 was more than twice the size it had been in 1914. The last territorial change during this period came in 1923, when a few border settlements were exchanged between Romania and Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The most notable Romanian acquisition was the town of Jimbolia, while the most notable Yugoslav acquisition was the town of Jaša Tomić.

Romania made no further territorial claims; nonetheless the kingdom&#x27;s expansion aroused enmity from several of its neighbors, including Bulgaria, the Soviet Union, and especially Hungary. Greater Romania now had a significant minority population, especially of Hungarians, and faced the difficulty of assimilation. Transylvania had significant Hungarian and German population who were accustomed to being the power structure; with a historically contemptuous attitude towards Romanians, they now feared reprisals. Both groups were effectively excluded from politics as the postwar regime passed an edict stating that all personnel employed by the state had to speak Romanian. The new state was also a highly centralized one, so it was unlikely that the Hungarian or German minorities would exercise political influence without personal connections in the government in Bucharest. Despite these policies, the Romanian government permitted both Germans and Hungarians the freedom to have separate schools, publications and judicial hearings in their respective languages. These rights were not extended to other minorities, Jews in particular.

====The &quot;interbellum&quot; years====
The Romanian expression România Mare (literal translation &quot;Great Romania&quot;, but more commonly rendered in English: &quot;Greater Romania&quot;) generally refers to the Romanian state in the interwar period, and by extension, to the territory Romania covered at the time. Romania achieved at that time its greatest territorial extent (almost ). At the 1930 census, there were over 18 million inhabitants in Romania.

The resulting &quot;Greater Romania&quot; did not survive World War II. Until 1938, Romania&#x27;s governments maintained the form, if not always the substance, of a liberal constitutional monarchy. The National Liberal Party, dominant in the years immediately after World War I, became increasingly clientelist and nationalist, and in 1927 was supplanted in power by the National Peasants&#x27; Party. Between 1930 and 1940 there were over 25 separate governments; on several occasions in the last few years before World War II, the rivalry between the fascist Iron Guard and other political groupings approached the level of a civil war.

Upon the death of King Ferdinand in 1927, his son, Prince Carol, was prevented from succeeding him because of previous marital scandals that had resulted in his renunciation of rights to the throne. After living three years in exile, with his brother Nicolae serving as regent and his young son Michael as king, Carol changed his mind and with the support of the ruling National Peasants&#x27; Party he returned and proclaimed himself king.

Iuliu Maniu, leader of the National Peasants&#x27; Party, engineered Carol&#x27;s return on the basis of a promise that he would forsake his mistress Magda Lupescu, and Lupescu herself had agreed to the arrangement. However, it became clear upon Carol&#x27;s first re-encounter with his former wife, Elena, that he had no interest in a reconciliation with her, and Carol soon arranged for Magda Lupescu&#x27;s return to his side. Her unpopularity was a millstone around Carol&#x27;s neck for the rest of his reign, particularly because she was widely viewed as his closest advisor and confidante. Maniu and his National Peasant Party shared the same general political aims as the Iron Guard: both fought against the corruption and dictatorial policies of King Carol II and the National Liberal Party.

The worldwide Great Depression that started in 1929 and was also present in Romania destabilised the country. The early 1930s were marked by social unrest, high unemployment, and strikes. In several instances, the Romanian government violently repressed strikes and riots, notably the 1929 miners&#x27; strike in Valea Jiului and the strike in the Grivița railroad workshops. In the mid-1930s, the Romanian economy recovered and the industry grew significantly, although about 80% of Romanians were still employed in agriculture. French economic and political influence was predominant in the early 1920s but then Germany became more dominant, especially in the 1930s.

As the 1930s progressed, Romania&#x27;s already shaky democracy slowly deteriorated toward fascist dictatorship. The constitution of 1923 gave the king free rein to dissolve parliament and call elections at will; as a result, Romania experienced over 25 governments in a single decade.

Increasingly, these governments were dominated by a number of anti-Semitic, ultra-nationalist, and mostly at least quasi-fascist parties. The National Liberal Party steadily became more nationalistic than liberal, but nonetheless lost its dominance over Romanian politics. It was eclipsed by parties like the (relatively moderate) National Peasants&#x27; Party and its more radical Romanian Front offshoot, the National-Christian Defense League (LANC) and the Iron Guard. In 1935, LANC merged with the National Agrarian Party to form the National Christian Party (NCP). The quasi-mystical fascist Iron Guard was an earlier LANC offshoot that, even more than these other parties, exploited nationalist feelings, fear of communism, and resentment of alleged foreign and Jewish domination of the economy.

Already the Iron Guard had embraced the politics of assassination, and various governments had reacted more or less in kind. On 10 December 1933, Liberal prime minister Ion Duca &quot;dissolved&quot; the Iron Guard, arresting thousands; consequently, 19 days later he was assassinated by Iron Guard legionnaires.

Throughout the 1930s, these nationalist parties had a mutually distrustful relationship with King Carol II. Nonetheless, in December 1937, the king appointed National Christian Party leader, the poet Octavian Goga, as prime minister of Romania&#x27;s first Fascist government. Around this time, Carol met with Adolf Hitler, who expressed his wish to see a Romanian government headed by the pro-Nazi Iron Guard. Instead, on 10 February 1938 King Carol II used the occasion of a public insult by Goga toward Lupescu as a reason to dismiss the government and institute a short-lived royal dictatorship, sanctioned 17 days later by a new constitution under which the king named personally not only the prime minister but all the ministers.

In April 1938, King Carol had Iron Guard leader Corneliu Zelea Codreanu (aka &quot;The Captain&quot;) arrested and imprisoned. On the night of 29–30 November 1938, Codreanu and several other legionnaires were killed while purportedly attempting to escape from prison. It is generally agreed that there was no such escape attempt, but that they were murdered in retaliation for a series of assassinations by Iron Guard commandos.

The royal dictatorship was brief. On 7 March 1939, a new government was formed with Armand Călinescu as prime minister; on 21 September 1939, three weeks after the start of World War II, Călinescu, in turn, was also assassinated by legionnaires avenging Codreanu&#x27;s murder.

In 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which stipulated, among other things, the Soviet &quot;interest&quot; in Bessarabia. After the 1940 territorial losses and growing increasingly unpopular, Carol was compelled to abdicate and name general Ion Antonescu as the new Prime-Minister with full powers in ruling the state by royal decree.

===World War II===

===Post-war Kingdom (1945–1947)===

==Economy==
===Pre-Kingdom Era to World War I===
At the time of the proclamation of the Kingdom, there were already several industrial facilities in the country: The Assan and Olamazu steam mills, built in 1853 and 1862 respectively, a brick factory built in 1865, and two sugar factories built in 1873, among others. In 1857, the first oil refinery in the world was built at Ploiești. In 1880, after several railways were built, the CFR was founded. After proclamation of the Kingdom, the pre-established industrial facilities began to be highly developed: 6 more, larger, sugar factories were built and the railway network was expanded more. Another, more modern brick factory was built in 1891.

===Agriculture===
Despite all of these industrial achievements, the overwhelming majority of Romania&#x27;s economy remained agricultural. In 1919, a staggering 72% of Romanians were engaged in agriculture. The Romanian peasantry was among the poorest in the region, a situation aggravated by one of Europe&#x27;s highest birth rates. Farming was primitive and machinery and chemical fertilizers almost unheard of. The Regat (prewar Romania) was traditionally a land of large estates worked by peasants who either had little or no land of their own. The situation in Transylvania and Bessarabia was marginally better. After peasant calls for land reform snowballed into an avalanche, King Ferdinand had to oblige, especially once the Russian Revolution had encouraged peasants to take the matter in their own hands. The land reform passed in 1921 accomplished little however. Large landowners still controlled up to 30% of Romania&#x27;s land, including the forests peasants depended on for fuel. The redistributed plots were invariably too small to feed their owners and most peasants could not overcome their tradition of growing grain over cash crops. Nothing was done to remedy basic problems such as rural overpopulation and technological backwardness. Draft animals were rare, to say nothing of machinery, actual productivity was worse than before. Romanian agriculture struggled in the international market, and with the onset of the Great Depression, collapsed completely.

===Expansion and growth===
Romania&#x27;s 1913 GDP at the 1990 exchange rate amounted to $11.7 billion. However, the 1990 dollar was 9.27 times weaker than the 1938 dollar. Thus, Romania&#x27;s 1913 GDP at the 1938 exchange rate amounted to $1.262 billion.

The 1938 Romanian GDP amounted to 387.204 billion lei, with a GDP per capita of 20,487 lei at an estimated population of 18.9 million. The 1938 average exchange rate was of 1 leu for US$0.00732. Romania&#x27;s 1938 GDP thus amounted to $2.834 billion.

Romania&#x27;s public debt as of 1 April 1938 amounted to 112,267,290,144 lei, of which 78,398,078,964 lei consisted of external debt. Total public debt thus amounted to 29% of Romania&#x27;s 1938 GDP, while public external debt amounted to just over 20%.

===Industrial development===
Despite the destruction provoked by the First World War, Romanian industry managed significant growth, as a result of new establishments and development of the older ones. The MALAXA industrial engineering and manufacturing company was established in 1921 by Romanian industrialist Nicolae Malaxa and dealt especially with rolling stock maintenance and manufacturing. It developed rapidly, and by 1930 Romania had managed to cease importing locomotives altogether, all required rolling stock being supplied by the local industry. Industrial facilities acquired along with the new provinces, such as the Reșița works, also contributed to the rapid development of Romanian heavy industry. Other important establishments were the Copșa Mică works, producing non-ferrous metals and the Romanian Optical Enterprise. Construction also developed, as great monuments like the Caraiman Cross (1928), Arcul de Triumf (1936), and the Mausoleum of Mărășești (1938) were erected. The oil industry was also greatly expanded, making Romania one of the top oil exporters by the late 1930s, which also attracted German and Italian interest.

In 1938, Romania produced 6.6 million tons of crude oil, 284,000 tons of crude steel, 133,000 tons of pig iron, 510,000 tons of cement, and 289,000 tons of rolled steel.

===Armament industry===
Romanian military industry during World War I was mainly focused on converting various fortification guns into field and anti-aircraft artillery. Up to 334 German 53 mm Fahrpanzer guns, 93 French 57 mm Hotchkiss guns, 66 Krupp 150 mm guns and dozens more 210 mm guns were mounted on Romanian-built carriages and transformed into mobile field artillery, with 45 Krupp 75 mm guns and 132 Hotchkiss 57 mm guns being transformed into anti-aircraft artillery. The Romanians also upgraded 120 German Krupp 105 mm howitzers, the result being the most effective field howitzer in Europe at that time. Romania even managed to design and build from scratch its own model of mortar, the 250 mm Negrei Model 1916. Other Romanian technological assets include the building of Vlaicu III, the world&#x27;s first aircraft made of metal. The Romanian Navy possessed the largest warships on the Danube. They were a class of 4 river monitors, built locally at the Galați shipyard using parts manufactured in Austria-Hungary, and the first one launched was &quot;Lascăr Catargiu&quot;, in 1907. The Romanian monitors displaced almost 700 tons, were armed with three 120 mm naval guns in 3 turrets, two 120 mm naval howitzers, four 47 mm anti-aircraft guns and two 6.5 machine guns. The monitors took part in the Battle of Turtucaia and the First Battle of Cobadin. The Romanian-designed Schneider 150 mm Model 1912 howitzer was considered one of the most modern field guns on the Western Front.


The Romanian armament industry was expanded greatly during the Interwar period and World War II. New factories were constructed, such as the Industria Aeronautică Română and Societatea Pentru Exploatări Tehnice aircraft factories, which produced hundreds of indigenous aircraft, such as IAR 37, IAR 80, and SET 7. Before the war, Romania acquired from France the licence to produce hundreds of Brandt Mle 27/31 and Brandt Mle 1935 mortars, with hundreds more produced during the war, and also the licence to produce 140 French 47 mm Schneider anti-tank guns at the Concordia factory, with 118 produced between 26 May 1939 and 1 August 1940 and hundreds more produced during the war; these guns were to be towed by Malaxa Tip UE armored carriers, built since late 1939 at the Malaxa factory under French licence, eventually 126 being built until March 1941. Czechoslovak licence was acquired in 1938 to produce the ZB vz. 30 machine gun, with 5,000 being built at the Cugir gun factory until the start of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941. Romania also acquired the licence to produce the R-1 tankette, but ultimately only one prototype was built locally. German licence was acquired in 1938 to produce 360 37 mm Rheinmetall anti-aircraft guns, but only 102 were produced until May 1941. British licence was acquired to produce 100 Vickers Model 1931 75 mm anti-aircraft guns at the Reșița works, with the first battery of 6 guns entering service on 1 August 1939, and 100 more guns were built during the war for a total production of 200. On 14 June, Romania launched the first locally-built warship, the minelayer .

During the war, Romania copied and produced hundreds of Soviet M1938 mortars, as well as designing and producing up to 400 75 mm Reșița Model 1943 anti-tank guns. Infantry weapons designed and produced by Romania during the war include the Orița M1941 sub-machinegun and the Argeș flamethrower. Romania also built 30 Vănătorul de care R-35, 34 TACAM T-60, 21 TACAM R-2 tank destroyers and rebuilt 34 captured Soviet Komsomolets armored tractors. A few prototype vehicles were also built, such as the Mareșal tank destroyer, which is credited with being the inspiration for the German Hetzer, a Renault R-35 tank with a T-26 turret and an artillery tractor known as T-1. Warships built include the submarines and , a class of 4 minesweepers, 6 Dutch-designed torpedo boats and 2 gunboats.

==Demographics==

According to the 1930 Romanian Census, Romania had a population of 18,057,028. Romanians made up 71.9% of the population and 28.1% of the population were ethnic minorities.
===Cities===

Largest cities as per 1930 census:


Two of Romania&#x27;s seven largest cities in 1930 are currently located outside of Romania as a result of World War II border changes.

===Education===

While the Romanian nobility had a long tradition of sending their sons to Europe&#x27;s finest schools, the educated were otherwise a tiny minority. Transylvania had the most educated population in Greater Romania, while Bessarabia fared the worst. While legally all Romanians were required to undergo at least four years of schooling, in practice few actually did and the system was designed to separate those who would go on to higher education from those who would not. While this was partially necessary due to limited resources, it ensured that peasants had almost no chance of becoming educated.

High school and college education in Romania was modeled after the French system. Students undertook a rigid curriculum based around the liberal arts. Romania suffered from the same problem as the rest of Eastern Europe, which was that most students, coming from aristocratic backgrounds, preferred to study subjects such as theology, philosophy, literature and the fine arts over science, business, and engineering.

==Administrative division==

After Independence, the Romanian Old Kingdom was divided into 33 counties.

After World War I, as a result of the 1925 administrative unification law, the territory was divided into 71 counties, 489 districts (&quot;plăși&quot;) and 8,879 communes.

In 1938, King Carol II promulgated a new Constitution, and subsequently he had the administrative division of the Romanian territory changed. Ten &quot;ținuturi&quot; (approximate translation: &quot;lands&quot;) were created (by merging the counties) to be ruled by &quot;rezidenți regali&quot; (approximate translation: &quot;Royal Residents&quot;) - appointed directly by the King. This administrative reform did not last and the counties were re-established after the fall of Carol&#x27;s regime.

<doc id="297153" wikidata="Q1379683" url="?curid=297153" title="Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici">
<text>Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de&#x27; Medici (4 August 1463 – 20 May 1503), nicknamed &quot;the Popolano&quot;, was an Italian banker and politician, the brother of Giovanni il Popolano. He belonged to the junior (or &quot;Popolani&quot;) branch of the House of Medici of Florence.

==Biography==
Lorenzo was born in Florence, the son of Pierfrancesco de&#x27; Medici (the Elder) and Laudomia Acciaioli. Relations between the senior Medici branch and the younger &quot;Popolani&quot; branch had been tense since the 1440s, and Pierfrancesco had tried to shield his sons from the influence of the senior branch. But Lorenzo and Giovanni were still boys when their father Pierfrancesco died in 1476, and they promptly came under the tutelage of their older cousin, Lorenzo (il Magnifico), the effective ruler of Florence. Facing financial difficulties after 1478, Lorenzo il Magnifico plundered the Popolani boys&#x27; inheritance with &quot;forced loans&quot;. By the time they came of age, they claimed Lorenzo il Magnifico owed them over 100,000 ducats (il Magnifico eventually repaid a little over half of that in 1485).

Nonetheless, Lorenzo il Magnifico ensured his ward obtained the best education that could be bought at the time. Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco studied under notable Florentine Renaissance humanists Marsilio Ficino, Angelo Poliziano and Giorgio Antonio Vespucci (uncle of the navigator Amerigo Vespucci; Amerigo was a fellow-student and, from the 1483, became an employee and friend of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco; in the early 1500s, Amerigo Vespucci would send most of his famous letters on the &quot;New World&quot; to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco). Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco emerged with the reputation as a man of liberal views, a poet and art connoisseur in his own right. In ca. 1485, he commissioned an illuminated manuscript of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; featuring artwork by Botticelli. 


In 1482, Lorenzo il Magnifico arranged for the marriage between the young Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco and Semiramide d&#x27;Appiani, daughter of the Appiani lord Jacopo III of Piombino, who brought not only lucrative commercial ties but also political connections (the Appiani were related by marriage to the Aragonese of Naples). Lorenzo il Magnifico may have commissioned Sandro Botticelli&#x27;s &quot;Pallas Athene Taming a Centaur&quot; as a wedding gift to the new couple, presumably suggesting that Semiramide (represented by Pallas) should endeavour to &quot;tame&quot; young Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco (represented by centaur) (or more metaphorically, the surrender of brute instincts to the goddess of reason, a reference to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco&#x27;s entrance to manhood). It is believed that also on this occasion, either Lorenzo il Magnifico or Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco himself, commissioned Botticelli&#x27;s &quot;Allegory of Spring&quot; to celebrate the wedding - with Mercury representing Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco and Semiramide represented by the central Grace (or possibly Flora). Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco is believed to have later commissioned Botticelli&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot;, one of the most famous paintings of the Renaissance.

Lorenzo di Pierfranceso was the proprietor of the Villa del Trebbio, inherited from his grandfather Lorenzo the Elder, and Villa di Castello, acquired in 1477 on the instructions of Lorenzo il Magnifico. In 1483, he was dispatched as the Florentine ambassador to Paris, to witness the coronation of Charles VIII of France.

Quarrels over the inheritance lingered. The rupture with Lorenzo il Magnifico came to a head in October 1484, when the strongman secured the erasure of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco&#x27;s name from the lists of persons eligible for election to the Florentine political institutions. As part of the settlement in 1485, which involved outside arbitration, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco and his brother Giovanni il Popolano received the Medici family property of Villa Cafaggiolo in the Mugello region. Nonetheless, it was clear that Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco would have to shelve any public office or political ambitions during il Magnifico&#x27;s rule.

When Lorenzo il Magnifico died (1492), Lorenzo and Giovanni sided against the il Magnifico&#x27;s son, Piero (il Fatuo). Two years later they were exiled, but returned when King Charles VIII of France invaded Italy and Piero was ousted from Florence by a Republican government. The two brothers sided with the Republican party, and received the nickname &quot;Popolano&quot; (&quot;of the people&quot;). Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco became one of the most outstanding figures of the new administration, and was regarded by many as the cultural heir of il Magnifico. He protected Botticelli, Michelangelo, Filippino Lippi, Bartolomeo Scala, and in 1494 he founded a workshop of ceramics at Cafaggiolo.

He was overshadowed by Savonarola, but after the latter&#x27;s death it was rumoured he would receive the effective personal rule of the Republic; however, he refused. In 1501, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco was suspected of a plot with Cesare Borgia to favour the latter in the conquest of the city, but the accusations were never confirmed. He died in Florence in 1503.

His grandson Lorenzino de&#x27; Medici was the assassin of Alessandro de&#x27; Medici, the last ruler of Florence from the &quot;senior&quot; branch of the Medici, thereby passing power to Lorenzo&#x27;s great-grandson Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici.

<text>The Kingdom of Romania, under the rule of King Carol II, initially maintained neutrality in World War II. However, Fascist political forces, especially the Iron Guard, rose in popularity and power, urging an alliance with Nazi Germany and its allies. As the military fortunes of Romania&#x27;s two main guarantors of territorial integrity—France and Britain—crumbled in the Battle of France, the government of Romania turned to Germany in hopes of a similar guarantee, unaware that Germany, in the supplementary protocol to the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, had already granted its blessing to Soviet claims on Romanian territory.

In the summer of 1940, the USSR occupied Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, severely weakening Romania and diminishing its international standing. Taking advantage of the situation, Hungary and Bulgaria both pressed territorial claims on Romania. The disputes, arbitrated by Germany and Italy, led to the further losses of Northern Transylvania and Southern Dobruja to Hungary and Bulgaria respectively. The popularity of the Romanian government plummeted, further reinforcing fascist and military factions, who eventually staged a coup in September 1940 that turned the country into a Legionary State under Mareșal Ion Antonescu in partnership with the Iron Guard. Romania officially joined the Axis powers on 23 November 1940. Antonescu assumed full control over Romania in January 1941 and invaded the Soviet Union with the Axis, providing equipment and oil to Germany and committing more troops to the Eastern Front than all other allies of Germany combined. Romanian forces played a large role during fighting in Ukraine, Bessarabia, and in the Battle of Stalingrad. Romanian troops were responsible for the persecution and massacre of 260,000 Jews in Romanian-controlled territories, though half of the Jews living in Romania survived the war. Romania controlled the third-largest Axis army in Europe and the fourth largest Axis army in the world.

The Allies bombed Romania heavily from 1943 onwards, and during the Battle of Romania, Soviet armies occupied the country in 1944. Popular support for Romania&#x27;s participation in the war faltered, and the German–Romanian fronts collapsed under the Soviet onslaught. King Michael of Romania engineered the 1944 Romanian coup d&#x27;état that deposed the Antonescu regime and put Romania on the side of the Allies for the remainder of the war. Despite this late association with the victors, Greater Romania was not restored, except for Northern Transylvania from Hungary.

==Background==


In the aftermath of World War I, Romania, which fought alongside the Entente powers against the Central Powers, had greatly expanded its territory, incorporating the regions of Transylvania, Bessarabia and Bukovina, largely as a result of the vacuum created by the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires. This led to the achievement of the long-standing nationalist goal of creating a &quot;Greater Romania&quot;, a national state that would incorporate all ethnic Romanians. However, the newly gained territories also included significant Hungarian, German, Bulgarian, Ukrainian, and Russian minorities, which put Romania at odds with several of her neighbours. This occasionally led to violent conflicts, as exemplified by the Hungarian–Romanian War and the Tatarbunary Uprising. To contain Hungarian irredentism, Romania, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia established the Little Entente in 1921. That same year Romania and Poland concluded a defensive alliance against the emergent Soviet Union, and in 1934 the Balkan Entente was formed with Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey, which were suspicious of Bulgaria.

Since the late 19th century onwards Romania had been a relatively democratic constitutional monarchy with a pro-Western outlook, but the country faced increasing turmoil in the 1930s as a result of the Great Depression in Romania and the rise of fascist movements such as the Iron Guard, which advocated revolutionary terrorism against the state. Under the pretext of stabilizing the country, the increasingly autocratic King Carol II proclaimed a &#x27;royal dictatorship&#x27; in 1938. The new regime featured corporatist policies that often resembled those of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. In parallel with these internal developments, economic pressures and a weak Franco-British response to Hitler&#x27;s aggressive foreign policy caused Romania to start drifting away from the Western Allies and closer to the Axis.

On 13 April 1939, France and the United Kingdom had pledged to guarantee the independence of the Kingdom of Romania. Negotiations with the Soviet Union concerning a similar guarantee collapsed when Romania refused to allow the Red Army to cross its frontiers.

On 23 August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Among other things, this recognized in a secret annex the Soviet &quot;interest&quot; in Bessarabia (which had been ruled by the Russian Empire from 1812 to 1918). This Soviet interest was combined with a clear indication that there was an explicit lack of any German interest in the area.

Eight days later Nazi Germany invaded the Second Polish Republic. Expecting military aid from Britain and France, Poland chose not to execute its alliance with Romania in order to be able to use the Romanian Bridgehead. Romania officially remained neutral and, under pressure from the Soviet Union and Germany, interned the fleeing Polish government after its members had crossed the Polish–Romanian border on 17 September, forcing them to relegate their authority to what became the Polish government-in-exile. After the assassination of Romanian Prime Minister Armand Călinescu on 21 September, King Carol II tried to maintain neutrality for several months longer, but the surrender of the Third French Republic and the retreat of British forces from continental Europe rendered the assurances that both countries had made to Romania meaningless.

In 1940 Romania&#x27;s territorial gains made following World War I were largely undone. In July, after a Soviet ultimatum, Romania agreed to give up Bessarabia and northern Bukovina (the Soviets also annexed the city of Hertsa, which was not stated in the ultimatum). Two-thirds of Bessarabia were combined with a small part of the Soviet Union to form the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. The rest (northern Bukovina, the northern half of Hotin county and Budjak) was apportioned to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.

Shortly thereafter, on 30 August, under the Second Vienna Award, Germany and Italy mediated a compromise between Romania and the Kingdom of Hungary: Hungary received a region referred to as &#x27;Northern Transylvania&#x27;, while &#x27;Southern Transylvania&#x27; remained part of Romania (Hungary had lost Transylvania after World War I in the Treaty of Trianon). On 7 September, under the Treaty of Craiova, Southern Dobruja (which Bulgaria had lost after the Romanian invasion during the Second Balkan War in 1913), was ceded to Bulgaria under pressure from Germany. Despite the relatively recent acquisition of these territories, those were inhabited by a majority of Romanian speaking people (except Southern Dobruja), so the Romanians had seen them as historically belonging to Romania, and the fact that so much land was lost without a fight shattered the underpinnings of King Carol&#x27;s power.

On 4 July, Ion Gigurtu formed the first Romanian government to include an Iron Guardist minister, Horia Sima. Sima was a particularly virulent antisemite who had become the nominal leader of the movement after the death of Corneliu Codreanu. He was one of the few prominent far-right leaders to survive the bloody infighting and government suppression of the preceding years.

==Antonescu comes to power==
In the immediate wake of the loss of Northern Transylvania, on 4 September 1940, the Iron Guard (led by Horia Sima) and General (later Marshal) Ion Antonescu united to form the &quot;National Legionary State&quot;, which forced the abdication of Carol II in favor of his 19-year-old son Michael. Carol and his mistress Magda Lupescu went into exile, and Romania, despite the unfavorable outcome of recent territorial disputes, leaned strongly toward the Axis. As part of the deal, the Iron Guard became the sole legal party in Romania. Antonescu became the Iron Guard&#x27;s honorary leader, while Sima became deputy premier.

In power, the Iron Guard stiffened the already harsh anti-Semitic legislation, enacted legislation directed against minority businessmen, tempered at times by the willingness of officials to take bribes, and wreaked vengeance upon its enemies. On 8 October 1940 German troops began crossing into Romania. They soon numbered over 500,000.

On 23 November Romania joined the Axis powers. On 27 November 1940, 64 former dignitaries or officials were executed by the Iron Guard in the Jilava prison while awaiting trial (see &quot;Jilava Massacre&quot;). Later that day, historian and former prime minister Nicolae Iorga and economist Virgil Madgearu, a former government minister, were assassinated.

The cohabitation between the Iron Guard and Antonescu was never an easy one. On 20 January 1941, the Iron Guard attempted a coup, combined with a bloody pogrom against the Jews of Bucharest. Within four days, Antonescu had successfully suppressed the coup. The Iron Guard was forced out of the government. Sima and many other legionnaires took refuge in Germany; others were imprisoned. Antonescu abolished the National Legionary State, in its stead declaring Romania a &quot;National and Social State.&quot;

==The war on the Eastern Front==


On 22 June 1941, German armies with a massive Romanian support attacked the Soviet Union. German and Romanian units conquered Bessarabia, Odessa, and Sevastopol, then marched eastward across the Russian steppes toward Stalingrad. Romania welcomed the war because it allowed them to retake lands annexed by the Soviet Union a year prior. Hitler rewarded Romania&#x27;s loyalty by returning Bessarabia and northern Bukovina and by allowing Romania to administer Soviet lands immediately between the Dniester and the Bug, including Odessa and Nikolaev. Romanian jingoes in Odessa even distributed a geography showing that the Dacians had inhabited most of southern Russia. After recovering Bessarabia and Bukovina (Operation München), Romanian units fought side by side with the Germans onward to Odessa, Sevastopol, Stalingrad and the Caucasus. The total number of troops involved on the Eastern Front with the Romanian Third Army and the Romanian Fourth Army was second only to that of Nazi Germany itself. The Romanian Army had a total of 686,258 men under arms in the summer of 1941 and a total of 1,224,691 men in the summer of 1944. The number of Romanian troops sent to fight in the Soviet Union exceeded that of all of Germany&#x27;s other allies combined. A &quot;Country Study&quot; by the U.S. Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress attributes this to a &quot;morbid competition with Hungary to curry Hitler&#x27;s favor... [in hope of]... regaining northern Transylvania.&quot;

Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina were now fully re-incorporated into the Romanian state after they had been occupied by the USSR a year earlier. As a substitute for Northern Transylvania, which had been given to Hungary following the Second Vienna Award, Hitler persuaded Antonescu in August 1941 to also take control of the Transnistria territory between the Dniester and the Southern Bug, which would also include Odessa after its eventual fall in October 1941. Although the Romanian administration set up a civil government, the Transnistria Governorate, the Romanian state had not yet formally incorporated Transnistria into its administrative framework by the time it was retaken by Soviet troops in early 1944.

Romanian armies advanced far into the Soviet Union during 1941 and 1942 before being involved in the disaster at the Battle of Stalingrad in the winter of 1942–43. Petre Dumitrescu, one of Romania&#x27;s most important generals, was commander of the Third Army at Stalingrad. In November 1942, the German Sixth Army was briefly put at Dumitrescu&#x27;s disposal during a German attempt to relieve the Third Army following the devastating Soviet Operation Uranus.

Prior to the Soviet counteroffensive at Stalingrad, the Antonescu government considered a war with Hungary over Transylvania an inevitability after the expected victory over the Soviet Union. Although it was an ally of Germany, Romania&#x27;s later turning to the Allied side in August 1944 was rewarded by returning Northern Transylvania, which had been granted to Hungary in 1940 after the Second Vienna Award.

==War comes to Romania==

=== Air raids ===

Throughout the Antonescu years, Romania supplied Nazi Germany and the Axis armies with oil, grain, and industrial products. Also, numerous train stations in the country, such as Gara de Nord in Bucharest, served as transit points for troops departing for the Eastern Front. Consequently, by 1943 Romania became a target of Allied aerial bombardment. One of the most notable air bombardments was Operation Tidal Wave — the attack on the oil fields of Ploiești on 1 August 1943. Bucharest was subjected to intense Allied bombardment on 4 and 15 April 1944, and the Luftwaffe itself bombed the city on 24 and 25 August after the country switched sides.

=== Ground offensive ===
In February 1943, with the decisive Soviet counteroffensive at Stalingrad, it was growing clear that the tide of the war was turning against the Axis powers.

By 1944, the Romanian economy was in tatters because of the expenses of the war, and destructive Allied air bombing throughout the country, including the capital, Bucharest. In addition, most of the products sent to Germany – such as oil, grain, and equipment – were provided without monetary compensation, as Germany refused to pay. As a result of these uncompensated exports, inflation in Romania skyrocketed. This caused widespread discontent among the Romanian population, even among those who had once enthusiastically supported the Germans and the war, and an angry relationship between Romania and Germany.

Beginning in December 1943, the Soviet Dnieper–Carpathian Offensive pushed Axis forces all the way back to the Dniester by April 1944. In April–May 1944, the Romanian forces led by General Mihai Racoviță, together with elements of the German Eighth Army were responsible for defending northern Romania and took part in the Battles of Târgu Frumos, which David Glantz considered to be an initial Soviet attempt to invade Romania, supposedly held back by Axis defensive lines in northern Romania. The Jassy–Kishinev Offensive, launched on 20 August 1944, resulted in a quick and decisive Soviet breakthrough, collapsing the German-Romanian front in the region. Soviet forces captured Târgu Frumos and Iași on 21 August and Chișinău on 24 August 1944. The strategic Focșani Gate was invaded on 27 August 1944 by Soviet forces, which allowed them to spread out onto Bucharest, the Black Sea and the Eastern Carpathians.

==Highlights (Axis)==
*Romanian engineers contributed to the construction of the longest bridge ever built under fire – the bridge over the Dnieper at Beryslav.
*The Romanian capture of Odessa was the most important wartime conquest – without substantial German support – by any of the minor European Axis powers.
*On 1 September 1942, the Romanian 3rd Mountain Division took part in the largest amphibious assault undertaken in Europe by the Axis Powers during the war. 
*In late 1942, General Ioan Dumitrache captured Nalchik, the furthest point of Axis advance in the Caucasus. 
*Romania provided up to 40% of the Axis personnel in the Kuban Bridgehead. On 7 April 1943, a single Romanian battalion restored the front of an entire German division. 
*When an entire German army (the 6th) came under Romanian command in May 1944 (as part of general Petre Dumitrescu&#x27;s &quot;Armeegruppe&quot;), German commanders came under the actual (rather than nominal) command of their foreign allies for the first time in the war.
*Romania received more Knight&#x27;s Crosses than any other non-German Axis power.
**Ion Antonescu was the first foreigner to be awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross.
**Mihail Lascăr was the first foreign recipient of the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves.
*The Romanian Mareșal tank destroyer is credited with being the inspiration for the German &quot;Hetzer&quot;.
*In terms of heavy armored vehicles, Romania captured 2 KV-1 tanks, 1 IS-2 tank and 1 ISU-152 assault gun. These were the only heavy AFVs that Romania possessed throughout the war, as the country&#x27;s armor establishment - even as late as July 1944 - never went beyond medium tanks and assault guns.
==The Holocaust==

:&quot;See also Responsibility for the Holocaust (Romania), Antonescu and the Holocaust&quot;, &quot;Porajmos#Persecution in other Axis countries&quot;.
According to an international commission report released by the Romanian government in 2004, between 280,000 and 380,000 Jews were murdered or died in various forms on Romanian soil, in the war zones of Bessarabia, Bukovina, and in the formerly-occupied Soviet territories under Romanian&#x27;s control (Transnistria Governorate). Of the 25,000 Romani deported, who were deported to concentration camps in Transnistria, 11,000 died.

Though much of the killing was committed in the war zone by Romanian and German troops, there were also substantial persecutions behind the front line. During the Iaşi pogrom of June 1941, over 13,000 Jews were massacred or killed slowly in trains traveling back and forth across the countryside.

Half of the estimated 270,000 to 320,000 Jews living in Bessarabia, Bukovina, and Dorohoi County in Romania were murdered or died between June 1941 and the spring of 1944, of which between 45,000 and 60,000 Jews were killed in Bessarabia and Bukovina by Romanian and German troops, within months from the entry of the country into the war during 1941. Even after the initial killings, Jews in Moldavia, Bukovina and Bessarabia were subject to frequent pogroms, and were concentrated into ghettos from which they were sent to Transnistria, including camps built and run by the Romanian authorities.

Romanian soldiers and gendarmes also worked with the &quot;Einsatzkommandos&quot;, German killing squads, tasked with massacring Jews and Roma in conquered territories, the local Ukrainian militia, and the SS squads of local Ukrainian Germans (Sonderkommando Russland and Selbstschutz). Romanian troops were in large part responsible for the Odessa massacre, in which from October 18, 1941, until mid-March 1942, Romanian soldiers in Odessa, aided by gendarmes and police, killed up to 25,000 Jews and deported more than 35,000.

The number of deaths in all areas is not certain, but the lowest respectable estimates run to about 250,000 Jews and 11,000 Roma in these eastern regions.

Nonetheless, half of the Jews living within the pre-Barbarossa borders survived the war, although they were subject to a wide range of harsh conditions, including forced labor, financial penalties, and discriminatory laws. All Jewish property was nationalized.

The report commissioned and accepted by the Romanian government in 2004 on the Holocaust concluded:
&quot;Of all the allies of Nazi Germany, Romania bears responsibility for the deaths of more Jews than any country other than Germany itself. The murders committed in Iasi, Odessa, Bogdanovka, Domanovka, and Peciora, for example, were among the most hideous murders committed against Jews anywhere during the Holocaust. Romania committed genocide against the Jews. The survival of Jews in some parts of the country does not alter this reality.&quot;

==The royal coup==


On 23 August 1944, with the Red Army penetrating German defenses during the Jassy–Kishinev Offensive, King Michael I of Romania led a successful coup against the Axis with support from opposition politicians, most of the army and Communist-led civilians. Michael I, who was initially considered to be not much more than a figurehead, was able to successfully depose the Antonescu dictatorship. The King then offered a non-confrontational retreat to German ambassador Manfred von Killinger. But the Germans considered the coup &quot;reversible&quot; and attempted to turn the situation around by military force. The Romanian First, Second (forming), and what little was left of the Third and the Fourth Armies (one corps) were under orders from the King to defend Romania against any German attacks. King Michael offered to put the Romanian Army, which at that point had a strength of nearly 1,000,000 men, on the side of the Allies. Stalin immediately recognized the king and the restoration of the conservative Romanian monarchy.

In a radio broadcast to the Romanian nation and army on the night of 23 August King Michael issued a cease-fire, proclaimed Romania&#x27;s loyalty to the Allies, announced the acceptance of an armistice (to be signed on September 12) offered by Great Britain, the United States, and the USSR, and declared war on Germany. The coup accelerated the Red Army&#x27;s advance into Romania, but did not avert a rapid Soviet occupation and capture of about 130,000 Romanian soldiers, who were transported to the Soviet Union, where many perished in prison camps. The armistice was signed three weeks later on September 12, 1944, on terms virtually dictated by the Soviet Union. Under the terms of the armistice, Romania announced its unconditional surrender to the USSR and was placed under occupation of the Allied forces with the Soviet Union as their representative, in control of media, communication, post, and civil administration behind the front. Some attribute the postponement of a formal Allied recognition of the &quot;de facto&quot; change of orientation until 12 September (the date the armistice was signed in Moscow) to the complexities of the negotiations between the USSR and UK.

During the Moscow Conference in October 1944 Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, proposed an agreement to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin on how to split up Eastern Europe into spheres of influence after the war. The Soviet Union was offered a 90% share of influence in Romania.

The Armistice Agreement of 12 September stipulated in Article 18 that &quot;An Allied Control Commission will be established which will undertake until the conclusion of peace the regulation of and control over the execution of the present terms under the general direction and orders of the Allied (Soviet) High Command, acting on behalf of the Allied Powers&quot;. The Annex to Article 18 made clear that &quot;The Romanian Government and their organs shall fulfil all instructions of the Allied Control Commission arising out of the Armistice Agreement.&quot; The Agreement also stipulated that the Allied Control Commission would have its seat in Bucharest. In line with Article 14 of the Armistice Agreement, two Romanian People&#x27;s Tribunals were set up to try suspected war criminals.

==Campaign against the Axis==

As the country declared war on Germany on the night of 23 August 1944, border clashes between Hungarian and Romanian troops erupted almost immediately. On 24 August, German troops attempted to seize Bucharest and suppress Michael&#x27;s coup, but were repelled by the city&#x27;s defenses. Other Wehrmacht units in the country suffered severe losses: remnants of the Sixth Army retreating west of the Prut River were cut off and destroyed by the Red Army, which was now advancing at an even greater speed, while Romanian units attacked German garrisons at the Ploiești oilfields, forcing them to retreat to Hungary. The Romanian Army captured over 50,000 German prisoners around this time, who were later surrendered to the Soviets.

In early September 1944, Soviet and Romanian forces entered Transylvania and captured the towns of Brașov and Sibiu while advancing toward the Mureș River. Their main objective was Cluj, a city regarded as the historical capital of Transylvania. However, the Second Hungarian Army was present in the region, and together with the Eighth German Army engaged the Allied forces on 5 September 1944 in what was to become the Battle of Turda, which lasted until 8 October and resulted in heavy casualties for both sides. Also around this time, the Hungarian Army carried out its last independent offensive action of the war, penetrating Arad County in western Romania. Despite initial success, a number of ad-hoc Romanian cadet battalions managed to stop the Hungarian advance at the Battle of Păuliș, and soon a combined Romanian-Soviet counterattack overwhelmed the Hungarians, who gave ground and evacuated Arad itself on 21 September.

The Battle of Carei marked the last stage of recovering Romania&#x27;s former territory of Northern Transylvania, ceded in 1940 to Hungary as a result of the Second Vienna Award. On the evening of October 24, 1944, the Romanian 6th Army Corps attacked in the direction of Carei with a force comprising 4 divisions; at the same time, the 2nd Infantry Division of 2nd Army Corps attacked in the direction of Satu Mare, in a pincer movement. On October 25, both cities were freed from Hungarian and German control; by a decree from 1959, this day was established as the Romanian Armed Forces Day.

The Romanian Army ended the war fighting against the Wehrmacht alongside the Red Army in Transylvania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Austria and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, from August 1944 until the end of the war in Europe. In May 1945, the First and Fourth armies took part in the Prague Offensive. The Romanian Army incurred heavy casualties fighting Nazi Germany. Of some 538,000 Romanian soldiers who fought against the Axis in 1944–45, some 167,000 were killed, wounded or went missing.

==Aftermath==

Under the 1947 Treaty of Paris, the Allies did not acknowledge Romania as a co-belligerent nation but instead applied the term &quot;ally of Hitlerite Germany&quot; to all recipients of the treaty&#x27;s stipulations. Like Finland, Romania had to pay $300 million to the Soviet Union as war reparations. However, the treaty specifically recognized that Romania switched sides on 24 August 1944, and therefore &quot;acted in the interests of all the United Nations&quot;. As a reward, Northern Transylvania was, once again, recognized as an integral part of Romania, but the border with the USSR and Bulgaria was fixed at its state in January 1941, restoring the pre-Barbarossa status quo (with one exception). Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Eastern territories became part of Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova.

In Romania proper, Soviet occupation following World War II facilitated the rise of the Communist Party as the main political force, leading ultimately to the abdication of the King and the establishment of a single-party people&#x27;s republic in 1947.

<text>The Socialist Republic of Romania (, RSR) was a Marxist–Leninist one-party socialist state that existed officially in Romania from 1947 to 1989 (see Revolutions of 1989). From 1947 to 1965, the state was known as the Romanian People&#x27;s Republic (, RPR). The country was an Eastern Bloc state and a member of the Warsaw Pact with a dominant role for the Romanian Communist Party enshrined in its constitutions. Geographically, RSR was bordered by the Black Sea to the east, the Soviet Union (via the Ukrainian and Moldavian SSRs) to the north and east, Hungary and Yugoslavia (via SR Serbia) to the west, and Bulgaria to the south.

As World War II ended, Romania, a former Axis member which had overthrown their pro-Axis government, was occupied by the Soviet Union as the sole representative of the Allies. On 6 March 1945, after mass demonstrations by communist sympathizers and political pressure from the Soviet representative of the Allied Control Commission, a new pro-Soviet government that included members of the previously outlawed Romanian Workers&#x27; Party was installed. Gradually, more members of the Workers&#x27; Party and communist-aligned parties gained control of the administration and pre-war political leaders were steadily eliminated from political life. In December 1947, King Michael I was forced to abdicate and the People&#x27;s Republic of Romania was declared.

At first, Romania&#x27;s scarce post-war resources were drained by the &quot;SovRoms,&quot; new tax-exempt Soviet-Romanian companies that allowed the Soviet Union to control Romania&#x27;s major sources of income. Another drain was the war reparations paid to the Soviet Union. However, during the 1950s, Romania&#x27;s communist government began to assert more independence, leading to, for example, the withdrawal of all Soviet troops from Romania by 1958. Overall, from the 1950s to the 1970s, the country exhibited high rates of economic growth and significant improvements in infant mortality, life expectancy, literacy, urbanization, and women&#x27;s rights, but then stagnated in the 1980s.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Nicolae Ceaușescu became General Secretary of the Communist Party (1965), Chairman of the State Council (1967), and the newly established role of President in 1974. Ceaușescu&#x27;s denunciation of the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and a brief relaxation in internal repression led to a positive image both at home and in the West. However, rapid economic growth fueled in part by foreign credits gradually gave way to an austerity and political repression that led to the violent fall of his totalitarian government in December 1989.

Many people were executed or died in custody during communist Romania&#x27;s existence, most during the Stalinist era of the 1950s. While judicial executions between 1945 and 1964 numbered 137, deaths in custody are estimated in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Others were arrested for political, economical, or other reasons and suffered imprisonment or torture.

The 1965 Constitution remained in effect after its dissolution and was amended to reflect Romania&#x27;s transition to democracy. It was replaced by the current constitution on 8 December 1991, after a nationwide referendum abolished the socialist system of government completely and replaced it with a semi-presidential system.

== History ==
===Soviet occupation and rise of the Communists===

When King Michael, supported by the main political parties, overthrew Ion Antonescu in August 1944, breaking Romania away from the Axis and bringing it over to the Allied side, Michael could do nothing to erase the memory of his country&#x27;s recent active participation in the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Romanian forces fought under Soviet command, driving through Northern Transylvania into Hungary proper, and on into Czechoslovakia and Austria. However, the Soviets treated Romania as a conquered territory, and Soviet troops continued to occupy the country on the basis of the Romanians having been active Nazi allies with a fascist government until very recently.

The Yalta Conference had granted the Soviet Union a predominant interest in Romania. The Paris Peace Treaties did not acknowledge Romania as an allied co-belligerent, as the Romanian army had fought hard against the Soviets for the better part of the war, changing sides only when the tides started to turn. The Communists, as all political parties, played only a minor role in King Michael&#x27;s first wartime government, headed by General Constantin Sănătescu, though their presence increased in the one led by Nicolae Rădescu. This changed in March 1945, when Dr. Petru Groza of the Ploughmen&#x27;s Front, a party closely associated with the Communists, became prime minister. His government was broad-based on paper, including members of most major prewar parties except the fascist Iron Guard. However, the Communists held the key ministries, and most of the ministers nominally representing non-Communist parties were, like Groza himself, fellow travelers.

The King was not happy with the direction of this government, but when he attempted to force Groza&#x27;s resignation by refusing to sign any legislation (a move known as &quot;the royal strike&quot;), Groza simply chose to enact laws without bothering to obtain Michael&#x27;s signature. On 8 November 1945, King Michael&#x27;s name day, a pro-monarchy demonstration in front of the Royal Palace in Bucharest escalated into street fights between opposition supporters and soldiers, police and pro-government workers, resulting in dozens of killed and wounded; Soviet officers restrained Romanian soldiers and police from firing on civilians, and Soviet troops restored order.

Despite the King&#x27;s disapproval, the first Groza government brought land reform and women&#x27;s suffrage, the former giving the party widespread popularity among peasants from the south and east, while the latter gained it the support of educated women. However, it also brought the beginnings of Soviet domination of Romania. In the elections of 19 November 1946, the Communist-led Bloc of Democratic Parties (BPD) claimed 84% of the votes. These elections were characterized by widespread irregularities, including intimidation, electoral fraud, and assassinations Archives confirm suspicions at the time that the election results were, in fact, falsified.

After forming a government, the Communists moved to eliminate the role of the centrist parties; notably, the National Peasants&#x27; Party was accused of espionage after it became clear in 1947 that their leaders were meeting secretly with United States officials. A show trial of their leadership was then arranged, and they were put in jail. Other parties were forced to &quot;merge&quot; with the Communists. In 1946 and 1947, several high-ranking members in the pro-Axis government were executed as war criminals, primarily for their involvement in the Holocaust and for attacking the Soviet Union. Antonescu himself was executed on 1 June 1946.

By 1947, Romania remained the only monarchy in the Eastern Bloc. On 30 December that year, Michael was at his palace in Sinaia when Groza and Gheorghiu-Dej summoned him back to Bucharest. They presented him with a pretyped instrument of abdication and demanded that he sign it. With pro-Communist troops surrounding his palace and his telephone lines cut, Michael was forced to sign the document.

===Romanian People&#x27;s Republic===
====1947-48 takeover====
On 30 December 1947, only hours after Michael had been forced to abdicate, Parliament abolished the monarchy and proclaimed Romania a People&#x27;s Republic. In February 1948, the Communists merged with the Social Democrats to form the Romanian Workers&#x27; Party. However, most independent-minded Socialists were soon pushed out. Meanwhile, many non-Communist politicians had either been imprisoned or fled into exile.

The communist regime was formalized with the constitution of 13 April 1948. The new constitution was a near-copy of the 1936 Soviet Constitution. While it guaranteed all manner of freedoms on paper, any association which had a &quot;fascist or anti-democratic nature&quot; was forbidden. This provision was broadly interpreted to ban any party not willing to do the Communists&#x27; bidding, and gave a legal façade to political repression.

;Religion
Although the 1948 Constitution and its two successors provided a simulacrum of religious freedom, the regime in fact had a policy of promoting Marxist–Leninist atheism, coupled with religious persecution. The role of religious bodies was strictly limited to their houses of worship, and large public demonstrations were strictly forbidden. In 1948, in order to minimize the role of the clergy in society, the government adopted a decree nationalizing church property, including schools. The regime found wiser to use religion and make it subservient to the regime rather than to eradicate it. The communist government also disbanded the Romanian Greek-Catholic Uniate Church, declaring its merger with the Romanian Orthodox Church.

====Early years====
The early years of communist rule in Romania were marked by repeated changes of course and by numerous arrests and imprisonments as factions contended for dominance. The country&#x27;s resources were also drained by the Soviet&#x27;s SovRom agreements, which facilitated shipping of Romanian goods to the Soviet Union at nominal prices.

On 11 June 1948, all banks and large businesses were nationalized.

In the communist leadership, there appear to have been three important factions, all of them Stalinist, differentiated more by their respective personal histories than by any deep political or philosophical differences. Later historiography claimed to identify the following factions: the &quot;Muscovites&quot;, notably Ana Pauker and Vasile Luca, who had spent the war in Moscow and the &quot;Prison Communists&quot;, notably Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, who had been imprisoned during the war.

Pauker and her allies were accused of deviating to the left and right. For instance, they were initially allied on not liquidating the rural bourgeoise, but later shifted their position. Ultimately, with Joseph Stalin&#x27;s backing, Gheorghiu-Dej won out. Pauker was purged from the party (along with 192,000 other party members); Pătrășcanu was executed after a show trial.

====Gheorghiu-Dej era====


Gheorghiu-Dej, a committed Stalinist, was unhappy with the reforms in Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s Soviet Union after Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953. He also balked at Comecon&#x27;s goal of turning Romania into the &quot;breadbasket&quot; of the East Bloc, pursuing an economic plan based on heavy industry and energy production. The government closed Romania&#x27;s largest labor camps, abandoned the Danube–Black Sea Canal project, halted rationing and hiked workers&#x27; wages. These factors combined to put Romania under Gheorghiu-Dej on a relatively independent and nationalist route.

Gheorghiu-Dej identified with Stalinism, and the more liberal Soviet government threatened to undermine his authority. In an effort to reinforce his position, Gheorghiu-Dej pledged cooperation with any state, regardless of political-economic system, as long as it recognized international equality and did not interfere in other nations&#x27; domestic affairs. This policy led to a tightening of Romania&#x27;s bonds with China, which also advocated national self-determination and opposed Soviet hegemonism.

Gheorghiu-Dej resigned as the party&#x27;s general secretary in 1954 but retained the premiership; a four-member collective secretariat, including Nicolae Ceaușescu, controlled the party for a year before Gheorghiu-Dej again took up the reins. Despite its new policy of international cooperation, Romania joined the Warsaw Treaty Organization (Warsaw Pact) in 1955, which entailed subordinating and integrating a portion of its military into the Soviet military machine. Romania later refused to allow Warsaw Pact maneuvers on its soil and limited its participation in military maneuvers elsewhere within the alliance.

In 1956, the Soviet premier, Nikita Khrushchev, denounced Stalin in a secret speech before the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). Gheorghiu-Dej and the leadership of the Romanian Workers&#x27; Party (&quot;Partidul Muncitoresc Român, PMR&quot;) were fully braced to weather de-Stalinization. Gheorghiu-Dej made Pauker, Luca and Georgescu scapegoats for the Romanian communist past excesses and claimed that the Romanian party had purged its Stalinist elements even before Stalin died in 1953. In all likelihood, Gheorghiu-Dej himself ordered the violence and coercion in the collectivization movements, since he did not rebuke those who perpetuated abuses. In fact, Pauker reprimanded any cadre who forced peasants, and once she was purged, the violence reappeared.

In October 1956, Poland&#x27;s communist leaders refused to succumb to Soviet military threats to intervene in domestic political affairs and install a more obedient politburo. A few weeks later, the Communist Party in Hungary virtually disintegrated during a popular revolution. Poland&#x27;s defiance and Hungary&#x27;s popular uprising inspired Romanian students to organize meetings in București, Cluj and Timișoara calling for liberty, better living conditions, and an end to Soviet domination. Under the pretext that the Hungarian uprising might incite his nation&#x27;s own revolt, Gheorghiu-Dej took radical measures which meant persecutions and jailing of various &quot;suspects&quot;, especially people of Hungarian origin. He also advocated swift Soviet intervention, and the Soviet Union reinforced its military presence in Romania, particularly along the Hungarian border. Although Romania&#x27;s unrest proved fragmentary and controllable, Hungary&#x27;s was not, so in November Moscow mounted a bloody invasion of Hungary.

After the Revolution of 1956, Gheorghiu-Dej worked closely with Hungary&#x27;s new leader, János Kádár, who was installed by the Soviet Union. Romania took Hungary&#x27;s former premier (leader of the 1956 revolution) Imre Nagy into custody. He was jailed at Snagov, north of Bucharest. After a series of interrogations by Soviets and Romanian authorities, Nagy was returned to Budapest for trial and execution.

Romania&#x27;s government also took measures to reduce public discontent by reducing investments in heavy industry, boosting output of consumer goods, decentralizing economic management, hiking wages and incentives, and instituting elements of worker management. The authorities eliminated compulsory deliveries for private farmers but reaccelerated the collectivization program in the mid-1950s, albeit less brutally than earlier. The government declared collectivization complete in 1962, when collective and state farms controlled 77% of the arable land.

Despite Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s claim that he had purged the Romanian party of Stalinists, he remained susceptible to attack for his obvious complicity in the party&#x27;s activities from 1944 to 1953. At a plenary PMR meeting in March 1956, Miron Constantinescu and Iosif Chișinevschi, both Politburo members and deputy premiers, criticized Gheorghiu-Dej. Constantinescu, who advocated a Khrushchev-style liberalization, posed a particular threat to Gheorghiu-Dej because he enjoyed good connections with the Moscow leadership. The PMR purged Constantinescu and Chișinevschi in 1957, denouncing both as Stalinists and charging them with complicity with Pauker. Afterwards, Gheorghiu-Dej faced no serious challenge to his leadership. Ceaușescu replaced Constantinescu as head of PMR cadres.

The cadres – anyone who was not a rank-and-file member of the Communist Party – were deemed the Party&#x27;s vanguard, as they were entrusted with the power to construct a new social order and the forms of power that would sustain it. They still underwent extensive surveillance, which created an environment of competition and rivalry.

====Persecution, the labour camp system and anti-communist resistance====

Once the Communist government became more entrenched, the number of arrests increased. The General Directorate of People&#x27;s Security, or &#x27;Securitate&#x27;, was established in 1948 with the stated aim &quot;to defend the democratic conquest and to ensure the security of the Romanian People’s Republic against the plotting of internal and external enemies&quot;.

All strata of society were involved, but particularly targeted were the prewar elites, such as intellectuals, clerics, teachers, former politicians (even if they had left-leaning views), and anybody who could potentially form the nucleus of anti-Communist resistance. According to figures, in the years between 1945 and 1964, 73,334 people were arrested.

The existing prisons were filled with political prisoners, and a new system of forced labor camps and prisons was created, modeled after the Soviet Gulag. A decision to put into practice the century-old project for a Danube–Black Sea Canal served as a pretext for the erection of several labor camps, where numerous people died. Some of the most notorious prisons included Sighet, Gherla, Pitești, and Aiud, and forced labor camps were set up at lead mines and in the Danube Delta.

One of the most notorious and infamous brainwashing experiments in Eastern Europe&#x27;s history took place in Romania, in the political prison of Pitești, a small city about northwest of Bucharest. This prison is still infamous in Romania for the so-called &#x27;Pitești experiment&#x27; or Pitești phenomenon, conducted there between 1949 and 1952. The prison in Pitești and the Pitești experiment aimed to &#x27;reeducate&#x27; the (real or imagined) opponents of the regime. It involved psychological and physical torture of prisoners, and the submission of them to humiliating, degrading and dehumanizing acts. Tens of people died in this &#x27;experiment&#x27;, but its aim was not to kill the people, but to &#x27;reeducate&#x27; them. Some of those who were thus &#x27;reeducated&#x27; later became torturers themselves. Of those who survived Pitești, many either took their own lives or ended up in mental institutions.

The Communist government also decided on the deportation of peasants from the Banat (south-west from Transylvania, at the border with Yugoslavia), started on 18 June 1951. About 45,000 people were forcibly &quot;resettled&quot; in lesser populated regions on the eastern plains (Bărăgan). The government decision was directed towards creating a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; against Tito&#x27;s Yugoslavia, but was also used as an intimidation tactic to force the remaining peasants to join collective farms. Most deportees lived in the Bărăgan for 5 years (until 1956), but some remained there permanently.

Anti-communist resistance also had an organized form, and many people opposing the government took up arms and formed partisan groups, comprising 10–40 people. There were attacks on police posts and sabotage. Some of the famous partisans were Elisabeta Rizea from Nucșoara and Gheorghe Arsenescu. Despite the numerous secret police (&quot;Securitate&quot;) and army troops massed against them, armed resistance in the mountains continued until the early 1960s, and one of the best known partisan leaders was not captured until 1974.

Another form of anti-communist resistance, non-violent this time, was the student movement of 1956. In reaction to the anti-communist revolt in Hungary, echoes were felt all over the Eastern bloc. Protests took place in some university centers resulting in numerous arrests and expulsions. The most-organised student movement was in Timișoara, where 3000 were arrested. In Bucharest and Cluj, organised groups were set up which tried to make common cause with the anti-communist movement in Hungary and coordinate activity. The authorities&#x27; reaction was immediate – students were arrested or suspended from their courses, some teachers were dismissed, and new associations were set up to supervise student activities.

Tens of thousands of people were killed as part of repression and agricultural collectivization in Communist Romania primarily under Gheorghiu-Dej.

===Ceaușescu government===
Gheorghiu-Dej died in 1965 and, after a power struggle, was succeeded by the previously obscure Nicolae Ceaușescu. During his last two years, Gheorghiu-Dej had exploited the Soviet–Chinese dispute and begun to oppose the hegemony of the Soviet Union. Ceaușescu, supported by colleagues of Gheorghiu-Dej such as Maurer, continued this popular line. Relations with Western countries and many other states began to be strengthened in what seemed to be the national interest of Romania. Under a policy of de-Russification the forced Soviet (mostly Russian) cultural influence in the country which characterized the 1950s was stopped and Western media were allowed to circulate in Romania instead.

====First years====

On 21 August 1965, following the example of Czechoslovakia, the name of the country was changed to &quot;Socialist Republic of Romania&quot; (&quot;Republica Socialistă România, RSR&quot;) and PMR&#x27;s old name was restored (&quot;Partidul Comunist Român, PCR&quot;; &quot;Romanian Communist Party&quot;).

In his early years in power, Ceaușescu was genuinely popular, both at home and abroad. Agricultural goods were abundant, consumer goods began to reappear, there was a cultural thaw, and, what was important abroad, he spoke out against the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. While his reputation at home soon soured, he continued to have uncommonly good relations with Western governments and with international capitalist institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank because of his independent political line. Romania under Ceaușescu maintained and sometimes improved diplomatic and other relations with, among others, West Germany, Israel, China, Albania, and Pinochet&#x27;s Chile, all for various reasons not on good terms with Moscow.

Ceaușescu refused to implement measures of economic liberalism. The evolution of his regime followed the path begun by Gheorghiu-Dej. He continued with the program of intensive industrialization aimed at the economic self-sufficiency of the country which since 1959 had already doubled industrial production and had reduced the peasant population from 78% at the end of the 1940s to 61% in 1966 and 49% by 1971. However, for Romania, like other Eastern People&#x27;s Republics, industrialization did not mean a total social break with the countryside. The peasants returned periodically to the villages or resided in them, commuting daily to the city in a practice called naveta. This allowed Romanians to act as peasants and workers at the same time.

Universities were also founded in small Romanian towns, which served to train qualified professionals, such as engineers, economists, planners or jurists, necessary for the industrialization and development project of the country. Romanian healthcare also achieved improvements and recognition by the World Health Organization (WHO). In May 1969, Marcolino Candau, Director General of this organization, visited Romania and declared that the visits of WHO staff to various Romanian hospital establishments had made an extraordinarily good impression.

The social and economic transformations resulted in improved living conditions for Romanians. Economic growth allowed for higher salaries which, combined with the benefits offered by the state (free medical care, pensions, free universal education at all levels, etc.) were a leap compared to the pre-WWII situation of the Romanian population. Certain extra retributions were allowed for the peasants, who started to produce more.

====Human rights issues====

Concerned about the country&#x27;s low birthrates, Nicolae Ceaușescu enacted an aggressive natalist policy, which included outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, taxes on childlessness, and legal discrimination against childless people. This period has later been depicted in movies and documentaries (such as &quot;4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days&quot;, &quot;Children of the Decree&quot;). To counter the sharp decline of the population, the Communist Party decided that the Romanian population should be increased from 23 to 30 million inhabitants. In October 1966, Decree 770 was authorized by Ceaușescu.

These pro-natalist measures had some degree of success, as a baby boom resulted in the late 1960s, with the generations born in 1967 and 1968 being the largest in the country&#x27;s history. The natalist policies temporarily increased birth rates for a few years, but this was followed by a later decline due to an increased use of illegal abortion. Ceaușescu&#x27;s policy resulted in the deaths of over 9,000 women due to illegal abortions, large numbers of children put into Romanian orphanages by parents who couldn&#x27;t cope with raising them, street children in the 1990s (when many orphanages were closed and the children ended up on the streets), and overcrowding in homes and schools.

Other restrictions of human rights included invasion of privacy by the secret police (the &quot;Securitate&quot;), censorship and relocation, but not on the same scale as in the 1950s.

During the Ceaușescu era, there was a secret ongoing &quot;trade&quot; between Romania on one side and Israel and West Germany on the other side, under which Israel and West Germany paid money to Romania to allow Romanian citizens with certified Jewish or German ancestry to emigrate to Israel and West Germany, respectively.

====Industrialization====
Ceaușescu&#x27;s Romania continued to pursue Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s policy of industrialization. Romania made progress with the economy. From 1951 to 1974, Romania&#x27;s gross industrial output increased at an average annual rate of 13 percent. Several branches of heavy industry were founded, including the machine-tool, tractor, and automotive industries; large-tonnage shipbuilding; the manufacture of electric diesel locomotives; and the electronics and petrochemical industries.

Prior to the mid-1970s, Bucharest, as most other cities, was developed by expanding the city, especially towards the south, east and west. High density residential neighbourhoods were built on the outskirts of the city, some (such as Drumul Taberei, Berceni, Titan or Giurgiului) of architectural and urban planning value. Conservation plans were made, especially during the 1960s and early 1970s, but all were halted after Ceaușescu embarked on what is known as &quot;The Small Cultural Revolution&quot; (&quot;Mica revoluție culturală&quot;), after visiting North Korea and the People&#x27;s Republic of China and then delivering a speech known as the July Theses. In the late 1970s, the construction of the Bucharest Metro system was started. After two years, 10 km of network were already complete and after another 2 years, 9 km of tunnels were ready for use. By 17 August 1989, 49.01 km of the subway system and 34 stations were already in use.

The earthquake of 1977 shocked Bucharest; many buildings collapsed, and many others were weakened. This was the backdrop that led to a policy of large-scale demolition which affected monuments of historical significance or architectural masterpieces such as the monumental Văcărești Monastery (1722), the &quot;Sfânta Vineri&quot; (1645) and &quot;Enei&quot; (1611) Churches, the Cotroceni (1679) and Pantelimon (1750) Monasteries, and the art deco &quot;Republic&#x27;s Stadium&quot; (ANEF Stadium, 1926). Even the Palace of Justice – built by Romania&#x27;s foremost architect, Ion Mincu – was scheduled for demolition in early 1990, according to the systematisation papers. Yet another tactic was abandoning and neglecting buildings and bringing them into such a state that they would require being torn down.

Thus, the policy towards the city after the earthquake was not one of reconstruction, but one of demolition and building anew. An analysis by the Union of Architects, commissioned in 1990, claims that over 2000 buildings were torn down, with over 77 of very high architectural importance, most of them in good condition. Even Gara de Nord (the city&#x27;s main railway station), listed on the Romanian Architectural Heritage List, was scheduled to be torn down and replaced in early 1992.

Despite all of this, and despite the much-questioned treatment of HIV-infected orphans, the country continued to have a notably good system of schools. Also, not every industrialization project was a failure: Ceaușescu left Romania with a reasonably effective system of power generation and transmission, gave Bucharest a functioning subway, and left many cities with an increase in habitable apartment buildings.

====1980s: severe rationing====

Before austerity, Romania had made considerable progress in many areas. Between 1950 and 1973, Romania joined Yugoslavia and Bulgaria in achieving average annual growth rates that were above both the Central European and the West European average. During the first 3 post-war decades, Romania industrialized faster than Spain, Greece, and Portugal. The infant mortality rate plummeted from 139 per 1,000 during the interwar period to 35 in the 1970s. During the interwar period, half the population was illiterate, but under the communist government illiteracy was eradicated. The population became urbanized, women&#x27;s rights greatly improved, life expectancy grew, among many other achievements.

Romania continued to make progress. High rates of growth in production created conditions for raising living standards of the people. From 1950 to the mid-1980s, average net wages increased more than eightfold. The consumption fund increased 22-fold, and a broad program of building cultural facilities and housing was carried out. Over 80 percent of the country&#x27;s population had moved to new apartments during this period.

Despite all this, living standards in the country remained some of Europe&#x27;s lowest and as early as 1981, there were clear signs of public discontent, such as riots and an angry mob throwing rocks at Ceaușescu&#x27;s helicopter while it made a flight to Transylvania that October. Ceaușescu desired to repay Western loans, and thus enacted a harsh austerity policy, including rationing of food, gas, heating and electricity. People in cities had to turn to natural gas containers (&quot;butelii&quot;) or charcoal stoves, even though they were connected to the gas mains.
With full-scale food rationing in place, the Communist Party published official guidelines on how Romanians could eat nutritiously while reducing their calorie intake by 25%. There was a shortage of available goods for the average Romanian. By 1984, despite a high crop yield and increased food production, wide-scale food rationing was introduced. The government promoted it as &quot;rational eating&quot; and &quot;a means to reduce obesity&quot;. Most of what was available were export rejects, as most of the quality goods were exported, even underpriced, in order to obtain hard currency, either to pay the debt, or to push forward in the ever-growing pursuit of heavy industrialization.

Measures in the mechanization and chemicalization of farming helped to increase the output of agricultural products. In 1950, more than 300 kg of cereals was gathered per head of the population; by 1982 this amount had increased to 1 ton per person. Meat production increased from 29.5 to 100 kg.

In spite of the Soviet-led boycott, Romania participated in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. At that time, it was the only Soviet-aligned country to participate in the Olympic Games.

In the late 1980s, the United Nations Human Development report classified Romania as having had high human development. The life expectancy was 71 years, the literacy rate was 96%, and the Real GDP per capita was $3000.

By 1985, despite Romania&#x27;s huge refining capacity, petroleum products were strictly rationed with supplies drastically cut, a Sunday curfew was instated, and many buses used methane propulsion (they were mockingly named &quot;bombs&quot;); taxis were converted to burning methanol. Electricity was rationed to divert supplies to heavy industry, with a maximum monthly allowed consumption of 20 kWh per family (everything over this limit was heavily taxed). Only one in five streetlights was kept on, and television was reduced to a single channel broadcasting just 2 hours each day. All these policies combined led Romanians to have the lowest standard of living in Europe, with the possible exception of Albania.

====Systematization: demolition and reconstruction====
Systematization () refers to the program of urban planning carried out under Ceaușescu&#x27;s regime. After a visit to North Korea in 1971, Ceaușescu was impressed by the &quot;Juche&quot; ideology of that country, and began a massive campaign shortly afterwards.

Beginning in 1974, systematization consisted largely of the demolition and reconstruction of existing hamlets, villages, towns, and cities, in whole or in part, with the stated goal of turning Romania into a &quot;multilaterally developed socialist society&quot;. The policy largely consisted in the mass construction of high-density blocks of flats (&quot;blocuri&quot;).

During the 1980s, Ceaușescu became obsessed with building himself a palace of unprecedented proportions, along with an equally grandiose neighborhood, Centrul Civic, to accompany it. The mass demolitions that occurred in the 1980s under which an overall area of eight square kilometres of the historic center of Bucharest were leveled, including monasteries, churches, synagogues, a hospital, and a noted Art Deco sports stadium, in order to make way for the grandiose Centrul Civic (Civic center) and the House of the Republic, now officially renamed the Palace of Parliament, were the most extreme manifestation of the systematization policy.

In 1988 massive rural resetlement program began.

====Last years: increased social control====

Control over society became stricter and stricter, with an East German-style phone bugging system installed, and with the Securitate recruiting more agents, extending censorship and keeping tabs and records on a large segment of the population. By 1989, according to CNSAS (the Council for Studies of the Archives of the Former Securitate), one in three Romanians was an informant for the Securitate. Due to this situation, income from tourism dropped substantially, the number of foreign tourists visiting Romania falling by 75%, with the three main tour operators that organized trips in Romania leaving the country by 1987. Ceaușescu also started becoming the subject of a vast personality cult, his portrait on every street and hanging in every public building.

By 1988, with perestroika and glasnost policies in effect in the Soviet Union and China undergoing economic reforms, Romania&#x27;s Stalinist sociopolitical system began to look increasingly out-of-place, but all attempts were made to keep the populace isolated from events going on outside the country. Also, while the West had been willing in the past to overlook Ceaușescu&#x27;s human rights record in lieu of his independent, anti-Soviet stance, this was becoming less relevant with the Cold War winding down. As such, Romania started coming under fire from the United States and its allies, but such complaints were merely brushed off as &quot;unwelcome interference in our nation&#x27;s internal affairs&quot;.

There was also a revival of the effort to build:
*the Danube–Black Sea Canal, which was completed;
*a nationwide canal system and irrigation network, some of which was completed, but most of which is still a project, or was abandoned;
*an effort to improve the railway system with electrification and a modern control system;
*the Cernavodă Nuclear Power Plant;
*a national hydroelectric power system, including the Porțile de Fier power station on the Danube in cooperation with Yugoslavia;
*a network of oil refineries;
*a fairly developed oceanic fishing fleet;
*naval shipyards at Constanța;
*a good industrial basis for the chemical and heavy machinery industries;
*a rather well-developed foreign policy; and
*new towns via the Romanian rural systematization program.

===Downfall===

====Brașov Riot====

December 1989 was the last act of a finale that had started in 1987, in Brașov. The anti-communist riot in Brașov on 15 November 1987 was the main political event that announced the imminent fall of communism in Romania.

The revolt started at the enterprise of Trucks Brașov, as a strike that began on the night of 14 November, on the night-shift, and it continued the next morning with a march downtown, in front of the Council of the Romanian Communist Party.

The population heard about this event through Radio Free Europe. As Emil Hurezeanu tells it: &quot;I remember that Neculai Constantin Munteanu, the moderator of the show, started the broadcast: &#x27;Brașov! So Brașov! Now it started!&#x27; This was the tone of the whole broadcast. We had interviews, information, interpretations of some political interpretations, older press articles announcing open street protests against Ceaușescu.&quot;

The reprisals against the strikers were rapid. The workers were arrested and imprisoned and their families were terrorized, but this act of courage on the part of the workers of Brașov set the stage for future mass revolts. 

Hurezeanu continues: &quot;... All these have been turned into an offensive. The reaction of the regime was expected.. Very soon it was seen that the regime wants to hide it, to cancel it, practically not to respond to claims, not to take measures, to change anything, not to turn this protest into a public debate or even inside the party, in the Political Executive Committee. And then, the recipe of street confrontations with the regime became the only...possible. It became the leitmotif of all the media analysis. [...] It was the beginning of an action against the system that comprises more items. It was a labor protest in a citadel of Ceaușescu, it was an antidictatorial message, it was a clear political context: the pressures of Moscow, Ceaușescu&#x27;s refusal to accept the demands of Gorbachev, the breaking with the West, who changed the views towards the regime – all these have made us to believe that the beginning of the end was coming&quot;.

====Protests in 1989 before the Revolution====
In March 1989, several leading activists of the PCR protested in a letter that criticized the economic policies of Nicolae Ceaușescu, but shortly thereafter Ceaușescu achieved a significant political victory: Romania paid off its external debt of about US$11 billion several months earlier than even the Romanian dictator had expected. Ceaușescu was formally reelected secretary general of the Romanian Communist Party—-the only political party of the Romanian Socialist Republic—-on 14 November at the party&#x27;s XIVth Congress.

On 11 November 1989, before the party congress, on Bucharest&#x27;s Brezoianu Street and Kogălniceanu Boulevard, students from Cluj-Napoca and Bucharest demonstrated with placards that read &quot;We want Reforms against the Ceaușescu government.&quot; The students–Mihnea Paraschivescu, Grațian Vulpe, the economist Dan Căprariu from Cluj and others–were arrested and investigated by the Securitate at the , accused of propaganda against the socialist society. They were released on 22 December 1989 at 14.00. There were other letters and other attempts to draw attention to the economic, cultural, and spiritual oppression of Romanians, but they served only to intensify the activity of the communist police and the Securitate.

====Revolution====
On 16 December, a protest broke out in Timișoara in response to an attempt by the government to evict the dissident pastor László Tőkés from his church flat. Tőkés had recently made critical comments against the regime to the Hungarian media, and the government alleged that he was inciting ethnic hatred. His parishioners gathered around his home to protect him from harassment and eviction. Many passers-by, including Romanian students, spontaneously joined the protest. Subsequently, police and &quot;Securitate&quot; forces showed up at the scene. By 7:30 pm, the protest had spread, and the original cause became largely irrelevant. Some of the protesters attempted to burn down the building that housed the District Committee of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). The &quot;Securitate&quot; responded with tear gas and water jets, while the police attacked rioters and arrested many of them. Around 9:00 pm, the rioters withdrew. They regrouped eventually around the Romanian Orthodox Cathedral and started a protest march around the city, but again they were confronted by the security forces.

Riots and protests resumed the following day, 17 December. The rioters broke into the District Committee building. The army failed to establish order and chaos ensued, with gunfire, fighting, burning of cars, and casualties.

Unlike the Soviet Union at the same time, Romania had not developed a large, privileged elite. Ceausescu&#x27;s family maintained all control of politics and Communist Party officials were paid poorly and often rotated from job to job, thus preventing any potential political rivals from developing a base of support. This prevented the rise of the Gorbachev-era reformist Communism found in Hungary or the Soviet Union. Ceausescu was so bitterly opposed to reform that he went as far as to call for a Warsaw Pact invasion of Poland after its Communists decided to treat with the opposition–a marked turn from his vehement opposition to the invasion of Czechoslovakia two decades earlier.

Similarly, unlike in Poland, Ceaușescu reacted to strikes entirely through a strategy of further oppression. Romania was nearly the last of the Eastern European communist governments to fall; its fall was also the most violent up to that time.

Protests and riots broke out in Timișoara on 17 December and soldiers opened fire on the protesters, killing about 100 people. After cutting short a two-day trip to Iran, Ceaușescu gave a televised speech on 20 December in which he condemned the events of Timișoara, saying he considered them an act of foreign intervention in the internal affairs of Romania and an aggression through foreign secret services on Romania&#x27;s sovereignty, and declared National Curfew, convoking a mass meeting in his support in Bucharest for the next day. The uprising of Timișoara became known across the country, and on the morning of 21 December, protests spread to Sibiu, Bucharest and elsewhere.

Matters came to a head on 21 December, when Ceausescu&#x27;s speech at the Central Committee Building (CC) in Bucharest turned into chaos. The crowd, in a reaction that would have been unthinkable for most of the previous quarter-century, openly booed and jeered Ceaușescu as he spoke. He was forced to hide himself in the CC Building after losing control of his own &quot;supporters&quot;. The night of 21 December brought fighting between protesters and the Securitate, police and part of the army forces; more than 1100 protesters were killed during the fights over the next few days. On the morning of 22 December, it was announced that the army general Vasile Milea was dead by suicide. Believing that Milea had actually been murdered, the rank-and-file soldiers went over almost &quot;en masse&quot; to the budding rebellion. A second attempt at a speech the next day quickly failed. Soon, people were besieging the Central Committee Building, coming within a few meters of Ceaușescu himself; the Securitate did nothing to help him. Ceaușescu soon fled by helicopter from the rooftop of the CC Building, only to find himself abandoned in Târgoviște, where he and his wife Elena were finally tried by a drumhead court-martial, convicted after an hour and a half, and executed by firing squad moments after the verdict and sentence were announced on 25 December. The PCR dissolved soon afterward and has never been revived.

====Controversy over the events of December 1989====
For several months after the events of December 1989, it was widely argued that Ion Iliescu and the National Salvation Front (FSN) had merely taken advantage of the chaos to stage a coup. While, ultimately, a great deal did change in Romania, it is still a subject of contention among Romanians and other observers as to whether this was their intent from the outset, or merely pragmatic playing of the cards they were dealt. By December 1989 Ceaușescu&#x27;s harsh and counterproductive economic and political policies had cost him the support of many government officials and even the most loyal Communist Party cadres, most of whom joined forces with the popular revolution or simply refused to support him. This loss of support from government officials ultimately set the stage for Ceaușescu&#x27;s demise. The Romanian army also was a factor in the regime&#x27;s fall as it suffered from severe budget cuts while vast sums were spent on the Securitate, leaving them severely discontented and unwilling to save Ceaușescu.

==Politics==

RSR&#x27;s political framework was a socialist republic run by a single party, the Romanian Communist Party. All of its legislative meetings took place in Bucharest.

===Foreign relations===

Romania&#x27;s foreign policy was aligned with all nations that were aligned with the Soviet Union. Under Ceaușescu it enjoyed strategic relations with the Western Bloc and the Non-Aligned Movement, and it was the only Eastern Bloc country not to boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

Following the Sino-Soviet split, Romania also maintained relations with China and North Korea as well as the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge-ruled Democratic Kampuchea.

Romania joined the United Nations on 14 December 1955 (see United Nations Security Council Resolution 109) as well as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in 1972. In July 1980, Romania signed a comprehensive trade agreement with the European Economic Community; which in turn became the European Union in 1993 when Romania joined in 2007.

== Legacy ==

Despite the prolonged economic and social crisis between 1982 and 1989 and the following austerity measures; mostly due to the fast and stunning economic growth that was followed by the decline, many Romanians still view the Socialist era of their country positively, looking back nostalgically at an era of perceived stability and safety as opposed to the recent economic and political instability, and also the post-communist corruption that were resilient after 1989, being considered a major problem in the country. More than 53% of Romanians responded in polls that they would prefer to live once again under the Communist regime, and 63% think that their lives were better under it. The last and longest ruling leader of the Communist regime, Ceaușescu, also enjoys a high amount of approval in polls: In 2010, 41% of Romanians would vote for Ceaușescu, by 2014 this percentage reached 46%. In December 2018, 64% of people had a good opinion of Ceaușescu, making him the president with the highest amount of approval in the country.

On the other hand, after the fall of the communist regime, Romania began shifting its political and economic policies from support (albeit tepid) for Moscow to aligning itself with Brussels and Washington by joining NATO in 2004 and the European Union in 2007. Today, the &quot;apologetic presentation&quot; of Nazi and communists governments and denigrating their victims in the audio-visual media is forbidden by decision of the National Audiovisual Council. Dinel Staicu was fined 25,000 lei (approx. 9,000 United States dollars) for praising Ceaușescu and displaying his pictures on his private television channel (&quot;3TV Oltenia&quot;).

<text>After the Communist rulership ended and the former Communist dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu was executed in the midst of the bloody Romanian Revolution of December 1989, the National Salvation Front (FSN) seized power, led by Ion Iliescu. The FSN transformed itself into a massive political party in short time and overwhelmingly won the general election of May 1990, with Iliescu as president. These first months of 1990 were marked by violent protests and counter-protests, involving most notably the tremendously violent and brutal coal miners of the Jiu Valley which were called by Iliescu himself and the FSN to crush peaceful protesters in the University Square in Bucharest.

Subsequently, the Romanian government undertook a programme of free market economic reforms and privatization, following a gradualist line rather than shock therapy throughout the early and mid 1990s. Economic reforms have continued, although there was little economic growth until the 2000s. Social reforms soon after the revolution included easing of the former restrictions on contraception and abortion. Later governments implemented further social policy changes.

Political reforms have been based on a new democratic constitution adopted in 1991. The FSN split that year, beginning a period of coalition governments that lasted until 2000, when Iliescu&#x27;s Social Democratic Party (then the Party of Social Democracy in Romania, PDSR, now PSD), returned to power and Iliescu again became President, with Adrian Năstase as Prime Minister. This government fell in the 2004 elections amid allegations of corruption, and was succeeded by further unstable coalitions which have been subject to similar allegations.

During the recent period, Romania has become more closely integrated with the West, becoming a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2004 and of the European Union (EU) in 2007.

== Revolution ==

1989 marked the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. A mid-December protest in Timișoara against the eviction of a Hungarian minister (László Tőkés) grew into a country-wide protest against the Ceaușescu régime, sweeping the dictator from power.

On 21 December, President Nicolae Ceaușescu had his apparatus gather a mass-meeting in Bucharest downtown in an attempt to rally popular support for his regime and publicly condemn the mass protests of Timișoara. This meeting mirrored the mass-meeting gathered in 1968 when Ceaușescu had spoken out against the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact countries. This time, however, the people turned angry and riot broke out. During the events of the following week, marked by confusion and street fighting, it is estimated that 1,051 people lost their lives. To this day, the real number of casualties are unknown and so are the identities of the individuals responsible for them. Those responsible for the casualties are still called &quot;the terrorists&quot;. Ceaușescu was arrested in Târgoviște. After a summary trial by a kangaroo court, he and his wife were executed on 25 December.

During the Romanian Revolution, power was taken by a group called the National Salvation Front (FSN), which gathered dissidents, both from within the Communist Party and non-affiliated. The FSN quickly assumed the mission of restoring civil order and immediately took seemingly democratic measures. The Communist Party was thus outlawed, and Ceaușescu&#x27;s most unpopular measures, such as bans on abortion and contraception, were rolled back.

==1990–1996==
In the aftermath of the revolution, several parties which claimed to be successors of pre-World War II parties were formed. The most successful were the Christian Democratic National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚ-CD), the National Liberal Party (PNL), and the Romanian Social Democrat Party (PSDR). Their leadership was made of former political prisoners of the 1950s, repatriated émigrés, and people which had not been affiliated with the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). As a reaction, the FSN declared it would participate in the elections as a political party. The announcement triggered a series of anti-government demonstrations in Bucharest. The already tense situation was aggravated by press campaigns. The newspapers, assuming either a strong pro-government or strong pro-opposition stance, issued attacks and tried to discredit the opposing side. The FSN, having a better organisational structure, and controlling the state administration, used the press still controlled by the state in its own advantage. FSN also organised counter-manifestations, gathering the support of the blue-collar workers in the numerous factories of Bucharest. As the anti-government protesters started to charge the Palace of the Parliament, more groups of workers from around the country poured into Bucharest to protect the fragile government. The most notable among these groups where the coal miners of the Jiu Valley, known in Romania for their 1977 strike against the Ceaușescu regime. The workers attacked the offices of opposition parties, however the government intervened and succeeded in re-establishing the order. These events were to be known as the January 1990 Mineriad, the first of the Mineriads.

On 28 February, less than a month later, another anti-government demonstration in Bucharest ended again with a confrontation between demonstrators and coal miners. This time, despite the demonstrators&#x27; pleas for non-violence, several people started throwing stones at the Government building. Riot police and army forces intervened to restore order, and on the same night, 4,000 miners rushed into Bucharest. This incident is known as the Mineriad of February 1990.

Presidential and parliamentary elections were held on 20 May 1990. Iliescu won with almost 90% of the popular vote and thus became the first elected President of Romania. The FSN also secured more than two-thirds of the seats in Parliament. Petre Roman, a professor at the Polytechnic University of Bucharest, son of Valter Roman, a Communist official and veteran of the Spanish Civil War, remained Prime-Minister (position he held immediately after the Revolution). The new government, which included some former low-key members of the Communist party, promised the implementation of some free market reforms.

During the spring 1990 electoral campaign, the opposition parties organised a massive sit-in protest in down-town Bucharest, later known as the &quot;Golaniad&quot;. After the FSN won an overwhelming majority, most of the Bucharest protesters dispersed, however less than a hundred chose to remain in the square. The police efforts to evict them and re-establish traffic in central Bucharest two weeks after the elections was met with violence, and several state institutions were attacked (among them the Bucharest Police and the Interior Ministry). The freshly elected president, Ion Iliescu, issued a call to Romania&#x27;s population to come and defend the government from further attacks. The main group to answer the call were the coal miners of Jiu Valley, leading to the June 1990 Mineriad. The miners and other groups physically confronted the demonstrators and forcibly cleared University Square. After the situation calmed down, president Iliescu publicly thanked the miners for their help in restoring order in Bucharest, and requested their return to the Jiu Valley. The general national and international media portrayal of the miners involvement in these events have been disputed by the miners, who claimed that most of the violence was perpetrated by government agents that were agitating the crowds; these claims, and a growing public suspicion of the sequence and orchestration of events, led to Parliamentary and other inquiries. Parliamentary inquiries showed that members of the government intelligence services were involved in the instigation and manipulation of both the protesters and the miners, and later, in June 1994, a Bucharest court found two former Securitate officers guilty of ransacking and stealing $100,000 from the house of a leading opposition politician.
In December 1991, a new constitution was drafted and subsequently adopted, after a popular referendum. March 1992 marked the split of the FSN into two groups: the Democratic National Salvation Front (FDSN), led by Ion Iliescu and the Democratic Party (PD), led by Petre Roman. Iliescu won the presidential elections in September 1992 by a clear margin, and his FDSN won the general elections held at the same time. With parliamentary support from the nationalist Romanian National Unity Party (PUNR), Greater Romania Party (PRM), and the ex-communist Socialist Party of Labour (PSM), a new government was formed in November 1992 under Prime Minister Nicolae Văcăroiu, an economist and former bureaucrat during the Ceaușescu administration. The government took some limited steps towards the liberalisation of the market, started a privatisation program through management employee buyouts and sought to further relations with the Euro-Atlantic structures (the EEC/EU and NATO; the Snagov Declaration of 21 June 1995 committed the Romanian parliamentary political parties to Romania&#x27;s accession to the EU). The FDSN changed its name to Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR) in July 1993 after the merger with several smaller left-wing parties. This coalition dissolved before the November 1996 elections. This coincided with the bankruptcy of the Caritas pyramid scheme, a major scandal at the time in Romania.

==1996–2000==
Emil Constantinescu of the Romanian Democratic Convention (CDR) won the second round of the 1996 Romanian presidential elections by a comfortable margin of 9% and thus replaced Iliescu as chief of state.

PDSR won the largest number of seats in Parliament, but was unable to form a viable coalition. Constituent parties of the CDR joined the Democratic Party (PD) and the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR/RMDSZ) to form a centrist coalition government, holding 60% of the seats in Parliament. This coalition of sorts frequently struggled for survival, as decisions were often delayed by long periods of negotiations among the involved parties. Nevertheless, this coalition was able to implement some reforms. The new coalition government, under prime minister Victor Ciorbea remained in office until March 1998, when Radu Vasile (PNȚ-CD) took over as prime minister. The period was marked by frequent quarrels inside the coalition, dubious bankruptcy of several major banks, and a general economic downturn. Deteriorating living conditions provoked a new mineriad in 1999. After several battles with the police on the road towards Bucharest, Radu Vasile succeeded in convincing miners&#x27; leader Miron Cozma to back down, and send the miners home. A political independent, Mugur Isărescu, the governor of the National Bank, eventually replaced Radu Vasile as head of the government, helping stabilise the Romanian economy significantly affected by the previous governments.

==2000–2004==
Iliescu&#x27;s Social Democratic Party, now renamed the Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR), returned to power in the 2000 elections, and Iliescu won a second constitutional term as the country&#x27;s president. Adrian Năstase became the Prime Minister of the newly formed government. The opposition frequently accused the government of corruption and attempts to control the press. The government was also accused of allowing local elected leaders of the PSD to gain significant influence over the administration of their region, which allegedly used the newly found power for personal interests. Nevertheless, the Romanian economy witnessed the first years of growth after the 1989 revolution. The government also started several projects for social housing, restarted the construction of the motorway connecting Bucharest to Romania&#x27;s main port, Constanţa, and began the construction of a motorway across the western region of Transylvania. These projects however only had limited success due to generalized corruption under the already well placed 2nd and 3rd rank ex-members of the former Communist Party. 

In the aftermath of the 2001 September 11 attacks, Romania backed the US on its &quot;war on terrorism&quot;, giving overflight rights to the USAF during the US invasion of Afghanistan. The country&#x27;s military also actively participated both in the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force and the US-led Operation Enduring Freedom. In 2004, Romania was finally accepted as a full member of NATO. The Năstase government also took steps towards European integration, although the path was set by the ex-president, Constantinescu. The government successfully finalised negotiations with the European Union on most subjects, and 2007 was set as a tentative date for admission into the Union.

==2004–2007==

Presidential and parliamentary elections took place again on 28 November 2004. No political party was able to secure a viable parliamentary majority. There was no winner in the first round of the presidential elections. Finally, the joint PNL-PD candidate, Traian Băsescu, won the second round on 12 December 2004 with 51% of the vote and thus became the third post-revolutionary president of Romania.

The PNL leader, Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu, was assigned the difficult task of building a coalition government excluding the PSD. In December 2004, the new coalition government (PD, PNL, PUR and UDMR) under prime minister Tăriceanu was sworn in. Soon disputes appeared between the parties of the coalition. Prime minister Tăriceanu, leader of the PNL, and president Băsescu, constitutionally independent but generally regarded as &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the PD, accused each other of supporting illegitimate business interests. The PUR left the coalition after Băsescu declared that the party&#x27;s participation in the coalition was an &quot;immoral solution&quot;, leaving the government with limited support in the Parliament. The frequent disputes between the prime-minister and the president also caused a faction of the PNL supportive of Băsescu to split and form the Liberal Democratic Party (Romania).

Romania joined the European Union, alongside Bulgaria, on 1 January 2007.

== After 2007 ==

The disputes between the PNL prime minister and the president ultimately led to the expulsion of the PD ministers from the government. The PNL and UDMR formed a minority government, with intermittent support in Parliament on behalf of the PSD. As the conflict between the president and parliamentary parties continued, in May 2007, the PNL, PSD, PC (former PUR), and UDMR voted to impeach Băsescu for alleged violations of the constitutions. Nicolae Văcăroiu, the president of the Senate became ad interim president, however Băsescu was reinstated as a national referendum turned down the proposal to depose him. The relations between the president and the parliamentary parties other than PDL (formed after PD and PLD merged) remained tense for the following two years. EU membership and the reduced government powers favoured foreign investment and the Romanian economy.

In late 2008, the government lost the legislative elections, while PSD and PDL won roughly the same number of seats. An uneasy coalition was set up between the two parties, with the PDL president, Emil Boc, as prime-minister. Scandals soon erupted, with the PSD Interior minister changing several times amid allegations of corruption. The PDL youth minister was forced to resign after a Parliamentary commission accused her of siphoning government money towards the European Parliament campaign of Elena Băsescu, the president&#x27;s daughter. Accusation of funds mismanagement were also made against the PDL minister of tourism, Elena Udrea, a close ally of the president. In autumn 2008, during the electoral campaign for the November Presidential elections, the PSD accused coalition party PDL of planning to rig the elections in favour of Traian Băsescu. As a result, Emil Boc expelled the PSD minister of interior from the government, and PSD left the coalition in protest. Soon after, the Parliament approved a motion of no confidence, dismissing the PDL government. The Parliament also voted down two PDL government proposed by Traian Băsescu, and insisted on the creation of a PSD-PNL-UDMR government headed by FDGR/DFDR-member Klaus Iohannis, a proposition turned down by Băsescu. Traian Băsescu succeeded to narrowly win the second round of the presidential election, against PSD candidate Mircea Geoană. Emil Boc was reinstated as prime-minister in a PDL-UDMR government, with the help of splinter groups of PSD and PNL. In late 2009 and 2010 Romania was heavily hit by the worldwide economic crisis, causing several massive protests organised by trade unions. The opposition and the press frequently accused the government of preferential allocation of funds to its members, as well as generalised corruption.

In 2009, President Traian Basescu was re-elected for a second five-year term as the President of Romania.

In January 2014, Romania&#x27;s supreme court sentenced former prime minister Adrian Năstase, who held office between 2000 and 2004, to four years in prison for taking bribe. In 2014, Klaus Iohannis was elected as the President of Romania, and he was re-elected by a landslide victory in 2019.

In December 2020, that month&#x27;s parliamentary election was won by the then oppositional Social Democrats (PSD). Former prime minister Ludovic Orban resigned because of the defeat of his National Liberal Party (PNL). However, Florin Cîțu, a member of the National Liberal Party (PNL) who became its president following the September 2021 congress, became the new prime minister, forming a three party, center-right coalition consisting of the PNL, the USR PLUS (now simply legally known as USR), and the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR/RMDSZ).

In early October 2021, the Cîțu Cabinet was ousted on many grounds by the Parliament in the process of the 2021 Romanian political crisis. USR PLUS (now USR) decided to leave the cabinet in early September due to the national liberals&#x27; tremendous corruption. In late November, a grand coalition consisting of the PSD, PNL, and UDMR/RMDSZ was instated under former army general Nicolae Ciucă, the incumbent Prime Minister of his namesake cabinet. Romania’s new prime minister Nicolae Ciucă formed a coalition government between former arch rivals, his own center-right National Liberal Party (PNL) and center-left Social Democratic Party (PSD). PNL has eight ministers, PSD nine and three from the ethnic Hungarian UDMR group. Since the cabinet&#x27;s investment, Romania experienced a shift towards authoritarianism and illiberalism, as well as an increased corruption. On 15 June 2023, Marcel Ciolacu (PSD) was sworn in as the new Romanian Prime Minister. Rotating premiership had been long agreed as part of a deal by the ruling coalition.

<doc id="297165" wikidata="Q951723" url="?curid=297165" title="Temporary International Presence in Hebron">
<text>Temporary International Presence in Hebron or TIPH was a civilian observer mission in the West Bank city of Hebron established in 1994. Both the Israeli Government and Palestinian Authority called for its creation. It “monitor[ed] the situation in Hebron and record[ed] breaches of international humanitarian law, the agreements on Hebron between Israel and the Palestinian authority and human rights, in accordance with internationally recognized standards&quot;. It also monitored Israeli settlers, and aimed to help the Arab Palestinians who currently live there. It was staffed by personnel from Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey.

In 2019, the Israeli government declined to renew TIPH&#x27;s mandate, effectively expelling the force.

== Establishment ==

The TIPH mission was first established in 1994 after the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre on 25 February 1994, in which 29 Palestinians were killed. On 18 March, the UN Security Council condemned the massacre in United Nations Security Council Resolution 904, and called for a temporary international presence in Hebron. On 31 March, representatives of the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Israeli government signed an agreement requesting Italy, Denmark and Norway to provide observers to form a Temporary International Presence in the City of Hebron (TIPH). The first TIPH mission operated from 8 May to 8 August 1994. However, the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli government could not reach an agreement on the extension of the mandate, and the observers were therefore withdrawn on 8 August.

Peace negotiations between the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Israeli Government resulted in the signing of the Oslo II Accord on 28 September 1995. It called for partial redeployment of the Israeli Defense Forces from the West Bank including &quot;Area H-1&quot; in Hebron. It also called for the creation of another Temporary International Presence in Hebron.

On 12 May 1996, a temporary second TIPH mission observers started, this time with only Norwegian members.

After the IDF&#x27;s partial redeployment from Hebron, the parties signed the Protocol Concerning the Redeployment in Hebron on 17 January 1997, and four days later The Agreement on the Temporary International Presence in the City of Hebron. The third mission, started on 1 February 1997, included observers from Norway, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey. The agreement set a three-month mandate, renewable for a period of three months. Since then the mission has been reinforced with staff from those six countries with Norway as the coordinator.

==Purpose of the TIPH==
According to its mandate, the purpose of the TIPH was:

# to promote by their presence a feeling of security to the Palestinians of Hebron;
# to help promote stability and an appropriate environment conducive to the enhancement of the well-being of the Palestinians of Hebron and their economic development;
# to observe the enhancement of peace and prosperity among Palestinians;
# to assist in the promotion and execution of projects initiated by the donor countries;
# to encourage economic development and growth in Hebron;
# to provide reports as set out in paragraph 7 [of the Agreement on the Temporary international Presence in the City of Hebron]; and
# to coordinate its activities with the Israeli and Palestinian authorities.

==Activities==

Members of the TIPH served as observers and were not permitted to interfere in disputes or incidents. Instead, they reported incidents to the Head of Mission of the TIPH. They had no military or police functions. The members of the TIPH voluntarily opted to be an unarmed mission.

Reports of the TIPH on breaches of international humanitarian law, agreements on Hebron and human rights were not made public. They were available to the Israeli Defense Forces, the Palestinian Police Forces, and the member states. Specifically the reports looked for:
*Damages to private property caused by IDF or settlers.
*Prolonged ID checks or verbal and physical harassments by IDF personnel.
*Other breaches of international human rights standards.
*Breaches of rules applicable to Hebron, such as the Interim Agreement or Hebron Protocol.
Incident reports were analysed twice weekly by the TIPH Report Assessment Group (RAG), which tried to identify patterns.

In addition to observing and creating reports, the TIPH also worked on community relations projects to fulfill its mandate. The projects worked to “promote a feeling of security” and “contribute to economic development” in Hebron.

==TIPH as a peacekeeping force==
One of the differentiating factors between the TIPH and most other peacekeeping forces was that it operated as a bilateral agreement reached by two conflicting parties. Furthermore, it did not have a UN mandate, and instead it was an “intergovernmental organization set up with the sole purpose to perform its mandate, which is based on a bilateral agreement signed by the Israelis and Palestinians.” The advantage of this arrangement was that without being linked to any external organizations, the TIPH served only to perform its mandate. It operated outside any perceived bias international organizations may have had.

===Criticisms===
Karin Aggestam, who served with TIPH in 2000, distinguishes between &quot;neutrality&quot; and &quot;impartiality&quot;. According to Aggestam, TIPH is not expected to be neutral, since its mandate is to monitor the welfare of the Palestinian residents of Hebron in recognition of “the existing asymmetry between Israelis and Palestinians.&quot; Israeli authorities and particularly Israeli settlers, who have never accepted TIPH&#x27;s presence, have frequently accused TIPH of having a Palestinian bias. The Palestinian civilian population often feel frustrated at TIPH&#x27;s practice of observing rather than actively intervening. According to Aggestam the settler population considers TIPH observers to have pre-conceived notions, possibly antisemitic, and often compare TIPH members to Nazi soldiers; as a result, Aggestam says that TIPH members are often subject to verbal and physical harassment, by settler youth in particular, with the IDF looking on passively. Aggestam judges that TIPH &quot;strives towards an impartial and balanced practice to implement the goals stipulated in the mandate.&quot;

According to Aggestam, while the mandate of the TIPH, namely normalization of civil and economic life in Hebron, is a long-term aspiration, it was created as a temporary body with a mandate to be renewed every three months. In addition its members rotate every six to eighteen months. This leads to “inadequate planning and a lack of institutional memory.”

==Incidents==
On 26 March 2002 two observers, Catherine Berruex and Turgut Cengiz Toytunç were killed, and another observer wounded after their car was shot on a road near Halhul. The wounded observer said the shooter was dressed in a Palestinian police uniform and that he kept shooting after the observers told him they were from TIPH. The TIPH car was marked with large orange TIPH stickers, a marking well known to the area&#x27;s residents. An Israeli military court found a Palestinian man guilty of the murders, in September, 2003. Israeli authorities said that three people were involved in the killing.

In February 2006, TIPH staffers fled and evacuated their offices following an attack by hundreds of Palestinians high school children who threw rocks and broke car windows. The attackers shouted their opposition to the publication of Muhammad cartoons in Denmark and Norway. TIPH members began to resume their duties in April 2006.

== Calls for removal==
In July 2017, a TIPH employee punctured the tires of a car owned by a Jewish family. The incident, which was caught on film, shows a TIPH marked vehicle arriving at the scene and man wearing a TIPH vest crouching near the tire as two other men from the vehicle stand watch. According to the Israeli foreign ministry, TIPH head Einar Johnsen expressed his regrets for the incident and said that &quot;TIPH monitors that were involved in inappropriate activity were immediately sent back to the countries&quot;.

In July 2018, the legal counsel of the TIPH was filmed slapping a 10-year-old Jewish boy across the face. After the footage was released, the TIPH member was ordered to leave Israel. The Swiss ambassador to Israel apologized for the actions of the observer.

In November 2018, following complaints alleging TIPH members are involved in the systematic violent targeting of the Jewish community, the Israeli foreign ministry said that a preliminary review determined that TIPH has &quot;outlived its usefulness&quot;. Dore Gold, Tzipi Hotovely, and Land of Israel Knesset caucus advocated the removal of TIPH, while left wing groups and B’Tselem have called for its retention.

On January 28, 2019, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted that he has decided not to extend TIPH&#x27;s mandate, which effectively resulted in the removal of TIPH from the region. Netanyahu justified his decision by saying that Israel &quot;will not allow the continued presence of an international force that operates against us.&quot;

Norway&#x27;s Foreign Minister, Ine Marie Eriksen Søreide warned that withdrawing TIPH may violate the Oslo Accords, and the Palestinian National Authority asked for the UN to “guarantee the safety and protection of the people of Palestine”.

==Twentieth anniversary report==
The TIPH issued a confidential report covering their 20 years of observing the situation in Hebron. The report, based in part on over 40,000 incident reports over those 20 years, found that Israel routinely violates international law in Hebron and that it is in &quot;severe and regular breach&quot; of the rights to non-discrimination laid out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights over the lack of freedom to movement for the Palestinian residents of Hebron. The report found that Israel is in regular violation of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention which prohibits the deportation of civilians from occupied territory. The report also found the presence of any Israeli settlement in Hebron to violate international law.

<doc id="297166" wikidata="Q1260858" url="?curid=297166" title="Narayana Guru">
<text>Sree Narayana Guru () (20 August 1856 – 20 September 1928) was a philosopher, spiritual leader and social reformer in India. He led a reform movement against the injustice in the caste-ridden society of Kerala in order to promote spiritual enlightenment and social equality. A quote of his that defined his movement was &quot;one caste, one religion, and one god for all human beings.&quot; He is the author of the Advaita poem Daiva Dasakam, which is one of the most used poem in Kerala for community prayer.

== Biography ==

Narayanan, né Nanu, was born on 20 August 1856 to Madan Asan and Kuttiyamma in an Ezhava family of ayurvedic physicians, in the village of Chempazhanthy near Thiruvananthapuram, in the erstwhile state of Travancore. Unlike other Ezhavas who confined their Sanskrit reading to ayurvedic works, Narayana guru studied religious texts as well. His early education was in the gurukula way under Chempazhanthi Mootha Pillai during which time his mother died when he was 15. At the age of 21, he went to central Travancore to learn from Raman Pillai Asan, a Sanskrit scholar who taught him Vedas, Upanishads and the literature and logical rhetoric of Sanskrit. A year later, he married Kaliamma but soon disassociated himself from the marriage to commence his public life as a social reformer. He returned to his village in 1881, when his father was seriously ill, and started a village school where he taught local children which earned him the name &quot;Nanu Asan&quot;.

Leaving home, he traveled through Kerala and Tamil Nadu and it was during these journeys, he met Chattampi Swamikal, a social and religious reformer, who introduced Guru to Ayyavu Swamikal from whom he learned meditation and yoga. Later, he continued his wanderings until he reached the Pillathadam cave at Maruthwamala where he set up a hermitage and practiced meditation for the next eight years.

In 1888, he visited Aruvippuram and spent time meditating in a cave near the Neyyar River. It was here that his first and one of his prominent disciple, Sivalingadasa Swamikal, who hailed from an orthodox Nair family, discovered him. During his stay, he consecrated a rock from the deepest part of the Neyyar River, a whirlpool sinkhole known as &#x27;Sankaran Kuzhi&#x27;. It is believed that it was in this &#x27;Sankaran Kuzhi&#x27; sage Agastya gave his worshipping Shiva Linga to Neyyar river somewhere before leaving. This rock was established as the idol of Shiva, and the site has since been known as the Aruvippuram Shiva Temple. The act, which later came to be known as &quot;Aruvipuram Pratishta&quot;, created a social commotion among the upper caste Brahmins who questioned Guru&#x27;s right to consecrate the idol. His reply to them that &quot;This is not a Brahmin Shiva but an Ezhava Shiva&quot; later became a famous quote, used against casteism. It was here, the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP Yogam) was founded on 15 May 1903 by the efforts of Padmanabhan Palpu with Narayana Guru as its founder president.

Guru shifted his base to Sivagiri, near Varkala in 1904 where he opened a school for children from the lower strata of the society and provided free education to them without considering their caste. However, it took him seven years to build a temple there, the Sarada Mutt was built in 1912. He also built temples in other places such as Thrissur, Kannur, Anchuthengu, Thalassery, Kozhikode, and Mangalore and it took him to many places including Sri Lanka (then called Ceylon) where he made his final visit in 1926. On his return to India, he was involved in a number of activities including the planning of the Sivagiri pilgrimage which was planned after his visit to Pallathuruthy in 1927 to attend the anniversary of the S.N.D.P. Yogam.

Soon after the meeting at Pallathuruthy, which was the last public function he attended, Guru became ill and underwent treatment at places such as Aluva, Thrissur, Palakkad, and finally to Chennai; the physicians attended to him included Ayurvedic physicians like Cholayil Mami Vaidyar, Panappally Krishnan Vaidyar and Thycauttu Divakaran Moos as well as allopathic physicians viz. . Krishnan Thampi, Panikker, Palpu and a European physician by name, Noble. He returned to Sarada Mutt and died on 20 September 1928, at the age of 72.

== Legacy ==

=== Fight against casteism ===
Casteism was practised in Kerala during the 19th and early 20th centuries and the backward castes such as Ezhavas and other untouchable castes like Paraiyars, Adivasis and Pulayars had to suffer discrimination from the upper caste community. It was against this discrimination that Guru performed his first major public act, the consecration of Siva idol at Aruvippuram in 1888. Overall, he consecrated forty five temples across Kerala and Tamil Nadu. His consecrations were not necessarily conventional deities; these included a slab inscribed with the words, &quot;Truth, Ethics, Compassion, Love&quot;, a vegetarian Shiva, a mirror, and an Italian sculpture. He propagated the ideals of compassion and religious tolerance and one of his noted works, &quot;Anukampadasakam&quot;, extols various religious figures such as Krishna, The Buddha, Adi Shankara, Jesus Christ.

=== Meeting with Mahatma Gandhi ===
On 12 March 1925, Mahatma Gandhi visited the Sivagiri Ashram in Varkala, Kerala, during the Vaikom Satyagraha. During his stay, he met Narayana Guru, who emphasized the need for education and wealth for the upliftment of lower castes rather than mixed eating and marriages. This conversation, facilitated by a translator, also addressed religious freedom and the caste system. Narayana Guru&#x27;s logical arguments and inclusive practices profoundly impacted Gandhi. Witnessing lower-caste children reciting prayers and their knowledge of the Upanishads impressed Gandhi and challenged his casteist views. Inspired by Guru&#x27;s teachings, Gandhi re-evaluated his stance on caste and untouchability. As a result of this transformative experience, Mahatma Gandhi began to focus on eradicating untouchability and upliftment of Harijans (Dalits) in the national movement. He renamed his newspaper &quot;Young India&quot; to &quot;Harijan&quot; and made the eradication of untouchability a central part of his mission. This marked a significant shift in Gandhi&#x27;s approach, integrating the fight against caste discrimination into the broader struggle for India&#x27;s independence.

Mahatma Gandhi subsequently renamed his newspaper from &quot;Young India&quot; to &quot;Harijan&quot; and made the eradication of untouchability and upliftment of Harijans a part of the national movement.

=== India&#x27;s first - All India Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition ===

In 1905, Narayana Guru organized All India Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition at Kollam, first time in India to facilitate industrialization and agriculture. Guru wanted to convey the importance of regaining the lost places of worship (later rebuilt by the Guru himself) and wealth.

=== Vaikom Satyagraha ===
The social protest of Vaikom Satyagraha was an agitation led by backward caste communities against discrimination in Hindu society of Travancore. It was reported that the trigger for the protest was an incident when Narayana Guru was stopped from passing through a road leading to the Vaikom Temple by an upper caste person. It prompted Kumaran Asan and Muloor S.Padmanabha Panicker, both disciples of Guru, to compose poems in protest of the incident. T. K. Madhavan, another disciple, petitioned the Sree Moolam Popular Assembly in 1918 for rights to enter the temple and worship, regardless of the caste. A host of people including K. Kelappan and K. P. Kesava Menon formed a committee and announced the &quot;Kerala Paryatanam Movement&quot; and with the support of Mahatma Gandhi. The agitation developed into a mass movement which resulted in the opening of the temple as well as three roads leading to it to people of all castes. The protest also influenced the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936.

=== Sivagiri pilgrimage ===
The Sivagiri pilgrimage was conceived by three of the disciples of Guru viz. Vallabhasseri Govindan Vaidyar, T. K. Kittan Writer and Muloor S. Padmanabha Panicker which Guru approved in 1928, with his own recommendations. He suggested that the goals of the pilgrimage should be the promotion of education, cleanliness, devotion to God, organization, agriculture, trade, handicrafts, and technical training and advised Vaidyar and Writer to organise a series of lectures on these themes to stress the need for the practice of these ideals, stating this to be the core purpose of Sivagiri pilgrimage. However, his death soon after delayed the project until 1932 when the first pilgrimage was undertaken from Elavumthitta in Pathanamthitta District.

=== All Religions&#x27; Conference ===
Guru organized an &quot;All Religion Conference&quot; in 1923 at Alwaye Advaita Ashram, which was first such event in India. During this period, communalization escalated into riots in India. In Kerala, the Malabar rebellion occurred. According to the Simon Commission report, more than 112 major communal riots took place in India between 1922 and 1927. Throughout this time, the guru also received letters from a communal leader, Abdul Hamid Qadri Badayuni, from Uttar Pradesh, who later moved to Pakistan. The guru responded to his queries and questions through letters. The All Religions&#x27; Conference, which was the first of its kind in India, was organized against this backdrop to foster peace among the various religions of the country and at the entrance of the conference, he arranged for a message to be displayed which read, &quot;We meet here not to argue and win, but to know and be known&quot;. The conference has since become an annual event, organised every year at the Ashram.

=== Spiritual initiations ===

Narayana Guru provided spiritual initiation to people of all faiths and sects. He initiated an individual from an orthodox Nair family in Koyilandy, who missed seeing the Guru upon his arrival due to huge crowd. This individual composed a poem in praise of the Guru and sent it through a friend. Upon reading the poem, the Guru blessed him by saying he will become a great yogi. This individual later became a yogi and known as Sivananda Yogi of Koyilandy.

Guru Narayana initiated Abdul Khader Masthan, a Muslim man, into spirituality. Born into the traditional Muslim family of Valiyakandy in Kannur city, which was traditionally involved in the copper business, Abdul Khader Masthan came into possession of a copper plate as part of the business. The inscriptions on the copper plate were in the Chenthamizh language. Being illiterate and unable to read even Malayalam, he found it difficult to interpret this ancient script and sought help from many, but to no avail. Eventually, Narayana Guru provided a solution.

Upon examining the script, Narayana Guru read it but did not tell the meaning to him rather he smiled at Abdul Khader Masthan and advised him to consult Sufi saints in Tamil Nadu, who could decipher its meaning. Following Narayana Guru&#x27;s guidance, Abdul Khader met with a Sufi saint in Tamil Nadu. The saint read the inscription, which turned out to be a Sufi text. Inspired by this experience, Abdul Khader Masthan later became a renowned Sufi saint known as Icha Mastan. He has composed many Sufi poems including praise of Shiva.

Narayana Guru welcomed a Muslim named Khader during his Sri Lankan visit who expressed a keen interest in becoming his disciple. Khader inquired whether he would be accepted into the group and if a change of religion was necessary. The Guru assured him that changing his religion was not a prerequisite to becoming a disciple. A year later, during Narayana Guru&#x27;s second visit at Sri Lanka, Khader met him again, this time dressed as a Hindu saint instead of his usual white Muslim attire. The Guru, feigning ignorance, asked Khader who he was. Disappointed, Khader reminded the Guru that he was his disciple, initiated the previous year. Narayana Guru expressed his recognition of the &#x27;old&#x27; Khader and reiterated that changing his Muslim attire was not necessary to be his disciple.

=== Writings and philosophy ===

Guru published 45 works in Malayalam, Sanskrit and Tamil languages which include &quot;Atmopadesa Śatakam&quot;, a hundred-verse spiritual poem and &quot;Daiva Dasakam&quot;, a universal prayer in ten verses. He also translated three major texts, &quot;Thirukural&quot; of Valluvar, &quot;Ishavasya Upanishad&quot; and &quot;Ozhivil Odukkam&quot; of Kannudaiya Vallalaar. It was he who propagated the motto, &quot;One Caste, One Religion, One God for All&quot; (Oru Jathi, Oru Matham, Oru Daivam, Manushyanu) which has become popular as a saying in Kerala. He furthered the non-dualistic philosophy of Adi Sankara by bringing it into practice by adding the concepts of social equality and universal brotherhood.

== Philosophy ==
== Public acceptance, honours and veneration ==
In 1916, Ramana Maharshi hosted Narayana Guru at his Tiruvannamalai ashram when Guru was returning from a trip to Kancheepuram where Swami Govindananda, a disciple of Guru, had established the Sree Narayana Seva Ashram. Rabindranath Tagore met Narayana Guru at the latter&#x27;s ashram in Sivagiri in November 1922. Tagore later said of Narayana Guru that, &quot;I have never come across one who is spiritually greater than Swami Narayana Guru or a person who is at par with him in spiritual attainment&quot;. Three years later, Mahatma Gandhi visited Guru during his 1925 trip to Kerala to participate in the Vaikom Satyagraha after which the Indian independence movement leader stated that &quot;it was a great privilege in his life to have the darshan of an esteemed sage like Narayana Guru.&quot;

On 21 August 1967, Narayana Guru was commemorated on an Indian postage stamp of denomination 15 nP. Another commemorative stamp on him was issued by Sri Lanka Post on 4 September 2009. The Reserve Bank of India and Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India issued two sets of commemorative coins depicting Guru&#x27;s image, each valued at 5 and 100 respectively, on the occasion of his 150th birth anniversary.

The first of the several statues of Narayana Guru was erected at Jagannath Temple, Thalassery in 1927 while he was still alive. His statues are seen in many places in Kerala which include a 24 feet statue at Kaithamukku in Thiruvananthapuram. The Government of Kerala observes his birthday, the Sri Narayana Jayanthi, and the date of his death, Sree Narayana Guru Samadhi as public holidays.

== In popular media ==
The life of Narayana Guru has been portrayed in a number of movies starting with the 1986 film &quot;Sree Narayana Guru&quot;, made by award-winning director P. A. Backer. &quot;Swamy Sreenarayana Guru&quot;, an Indian Malayalam-language film directed by Krishnaswamy, released the same year. Almost a decade and a half later, R. Sukumaran made a film on the life of Guru, titled &quot;Yugapurushan&quot;, in 2010 with Thalaivasal Vijay playing the role of Guru and the film also featured Mammootty and Navya Nair. &quot;Brahmashri Narayana Guru Swamy&quot; is a Tulu film made in 2014 by Rajashekar Kotian on Guru&#x27;s life and the film was the 50th film made in the language. His life during the eight years he spent at Maruthwamala (also known as Marunnumamala) has been adapted into a docufiction, titled &quot;Marunnumamala&quot; and the film was released by Pinarayi Vijayan, the chief minister of Kerala on 9 August 2016.

In 2016, Kerala High court observed that the statue of Narayana Guru cannot be treated as a Hindu deity.

== Death ==
Narayana Guru attained samadhi at Sivagiri, Kerala. The cause of death was indigestion and prostate inflammation. He had told all the great physicians and disciples of that time who came to treat him that the Guru had approached his samadhi in advance and that the ashram should be well looked after and that everyone should live as good people (18 January 1928). The special public meeting of the SNDP meeting held at Kottayam was the last public ceremony attended by Narayana Guru.

In 1927, naturopathy was carried out in Mangatukodi and Kandachira on the banks of Ashtamudikayal along with Pazhavila Chattambiasan. He was bedridden for a long time suffering from senile disease but was treated by many doctors but could not cure the disease completely. He died during meditation in the presence of devotees on 20 September 1928 (Malayalam year: 1104 Kanni 5). It was just three weeks after his 72nd birthday. The body was laid to rest in Sivagiri, Kerala Mathvalap. Today there is a hall with his statue.

<text>Sita Ram Goel (16 October 1921 – 3 December 2003) was an Indian Hindu nationalist writer, and publisher known for his literature pertaining to Hinduism and Hindu nationalism in the late twentieth century. His work has been both celebrated and criticized for its bias towards Hindu nationalism.

In his later career, Goel transitioned into a role as a commentator on Indian politics, aligning himself openly with Hindu nationalism, a stance that has generated significant debate and scrutiny among scholars and observers of Indian society and politics.

==Life==

===Early life===
Sita Ram Goel was born to a Hindu family in Punjab, in 1921; though his childhood was spent in Calcutta. The family looked upon Sri Garib Das, a nirguna saint comparable to Kabir and Nanak, as its patron saint and his verses, &quot;Granth Saheb&quot;, were often recited at their home.

Goel graduated in history from the University of Delhi in 1944. As a student, he was a social activist and worked for a Harijan Ashram in his village. His sympathies for the Arya Samaj, the Harijans and the Indian freedom movement, along with his strong support for Mahatma Gandhi, brought him into conflict with many people in his village; Goel also learned to speak and write Sanskrit during his college days.

==Works==

===&quot;Hindu View of Christianity and Islam (1993)&quot;===
In 1993 the MP Syed Shahabuddin, who in 1988 asked for the ban on &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, demanded a ban on Ram Swarup&#x27;s book &quot;Hindu View of Christianity and Islam&quot;. Goel and Swarup went into hiding because they feared that they could get arrested. The court accepted a bail and the authors came out of hiding. Arun Shourie and K. S. Lal protested against the ban.

===Colin Maine&#x27;s &quot;The Dead Hand of Islam&quot;===
In 1986, Goel reprinted Colin Maine&#x27;s essay &quot;The Dead Hand of Islam&quot; . Some Muslims filed a criminal case against Goel, alleging that it violated Sections 153A and 295A of the Indian Penal Code and similar articles of the Indian Customs Act.

The judge discharged Goel and referred to the earlier court precedent &quot;1983 CrLJ 1446&quot;. Speaking of the importance of that precedent, the judge in his discussion said: &quot;If such a contention is accepted a day will come when that part of history which is unpalatable to a particular religion will have to be kept in cold storage on the pretext that the publication of such history would constitute an offence punishable under Sec. 153A of the Penal Code. The scope of S-153A cannot be enlarged to such an extent with a view to thwart history. (...) Otherwise, the position will be very precarious. A nation will have to forget its own history and in due course the nation will have no history at all. (...) If anybody intends to extinguish the history (by prohibiting its publication) of the nation on the pretext of taking action under the above sections, his act will have to be treated as malafide one.&quot;

===&quot;The Calcutta Quran Petition&quot;===
Goel published &quot;The Calcutta Quran Petition&quot; with Chandmal Chopra in 1986. On 31 August 1987, Chopra was arrested by the police and kept in custody until 8 September for publishing the book with Goel. Goel absconded to avoid arrest.

===&quot;Hindu Temples – What Happened to Them&quot;===
There were proposals in November 1990 in Uttar Pradesh to ban Goel&#x27;s book &quot;Hindu Temples - What Happened to Them&quot;.

==Legacy==
Sita Ram Goel has been described by Koenraad Elst as an &quot;intellectual kshatriya&quot;. David Frawley said about Goel that he was &quot;modern India&#x27;s greatest intellectual kshatriya&quot;, and &quot;one of India&#x27;s most important thinkers in the post-independence era&quot;. According to Frawley, &quot;Sitaram followed a strong rationalistic point of view that did not compromise the truth even for politeness sake. His intellectual rigor is quite unparalleled in Hindu circles...&quot;

<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1965 with the song &quot;I Belong&quot;, composed by Peter Lee Sterling, with lyrics by Phil Peters, and performed by Kathy Kirby. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final, after having previously selected the performer internally.

At the Eurovision final in Naples, the United Kingdom finished in 2nd place for a record fifth time.

==Before Eurovision==
===&quot;A Song for Europe 1965&quot;===
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) held a national preselection to choose the song that would go to the Eurovision Song Contest 1965. It was held on 29 January 1965 and presented by David Jacobs.

The BBC internally selected the singer for the second time. They chose a solo female singer, Kathy Kirby, whose looks were compared to Marilyn Monroe and who had just scored four consecutive top 20 hit singles. The song was then selected by viewers of &quot;The Kathy Kirby Show&quot; on BBC1, casting votes on postcards via post, with the winner &quot;I Belong&quot;, receiving 110,495 votes. Chris Andrews had written one of the six finalists, &quot;One Day&quot; which was recorded by Sandie Shaw with whom he regularly collaborated. Shaw would be the artist selected to represent the , when again Andrews submitted a song.
Kirby released all six songs from the UK final on an Extended Play maxi single &quot;BBC TV&#x27;s A Song for Europe&quot;, which reached number 9 in the UK EP top 20 chart. She subsequently re-recorded the winner and the runner up with different arrangements and released these tracks on a single, which peaked at number 36 in the UK singles chart.

== At Eurovision ==
&quot;I Belong&quot; won the national and went on to come 2nd in the contest.

At the Eurovision final the BBC TV commentary was provided by David Jacobs with David Gell providing the domestic BBC radio commentary. Ian Fenner provided radio commentary for British Forces Radio.

<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1964 with the song &quot;I Love the Little Things&quot;, written by Tony Hatch, and performed by Matt Monro. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final, after having previously selected the performer internally.

==Before Eurovision==
===&quot;A Song for Europe 1964&quot;===
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) held a national selection to choose the song that would go to the Eurovision Song Contest 1964. It was held on 7 February 1964 and presented by David Jacobs.

BBC chose Matt Monro to sing the entries and juries made up of members of the public in sixteen British cities selected &quot;I Love the Little Things&quot; for him to sing at Eurovision.

Monro released all six songs from the British final on an Extended Play maxi single &quot;A Song for Europe&quot;, which reached number 16 in the EP top 20 chart. He subsequently released the winning song on single, with the runner up on the B-Side, but this single failed to reach the official UK Singles Chart.

== At Eurovision ==
&quot;I Love the Little Things&quot; went on to come 2nd in Eurovision.

The contest was broadcast on BBC TV, with commentary provided by David Jacobs.

The n entry in the &quot;&quot;, performed by songwriter Udo Jürgens, caught Monro&#x27;s ear, despite its sixth-place finish, and he recorded an English version titled &quot;Walk Away&quot; (lyric by Monro&#x27;s manager Don Black), earning him another hit single late in 1964.

<doc id="297180" wikidata="Q217101" url="?curid=297180" title="Spit (landform)">
<text>A spit (cognate with the word for a rotisserie bar) or sandspit is a deposition bar or beach landform off coasts or lake shores. It develops in places where re-entrance occurs, such as at a cove&#x27;s headlands, by the process of longshore drift by longshore currents. The drift occurs due to waves meeting the beach at an oblique angle, moving sediment down the beach in a zigzag pattern. This is complemented by longshore currents, which further transport sediment through the water alongside the beach. These currents are caused by the same waves that cause the drift.

==Hydrology and geology==

Where the direction of the shore inland &quot;re-enters&quot;, or changes direction, for example at a headland, the longshore current spreads out or dissipates. No longer able to carry the full load, much of the sediment is dropped. This is called deposition. This submerged bar of sediment allows longshore drift or littoral drift to continue to transport sediment in the direction the waves are breaking, forming an above-water spit. Without the complementary process of littoral drift, the bar would not build above the surface of the waves becoming a spit and would instead be leveled off underwater.

Spits occur when longshore drift reaches a section of headland where the turn is greater than 30 degrees. The spit will continue out into the sea until water pressure (e.g. from a river) becomes too great to allow the sand to deposit. Vegetation may then start to grow on the spit, and the spit may become stable and often fertile. A spit may be considered a special form of a shoal. As spits grow, the water behind them is sheltered from wind and waves, and a salt marsh is likely to develop.

Wave refraction can occur at the end of a spit, carrying sediment around the end to form a hook or recurved spit. Refraction in multiple directions may create a complex spit. Waves that arrive in a direction other than obliquely along the spit will halt the growth of the spit, shorten it, or eventually destroy it entirely.

The sediments that make up spits come from a variety of sources including rivers and eroding bluffs, and changes there can have a major effect on spits and other coastal landforms. Activities such as logging and farming upstream can increase the sediment load of rivers, which may hurt the intertidal environments around spits by smothering delicate habitats. Roads or bulkheads built along bluffs can drastically reduce the volume of sediment eroded, so that not enough material is being pushed along to maintain the spit.

If the supply of sediment is interrupted the sand at the neck (landward end) of the spit may be moved towards the head, eventually creating an island. If the supply is not interrupted, and the spit is not breached by the sea (or, if across an estuary, the river), the spit may become a bar, with both ends joined to land, and form a lagoon behind the bar. If an island lies offshore near where the coast changes direction, and the spit continues to grow until it connects the island to the mainland, it is called a tombolo.

The end of a spit attached to land is called the proximal end, and the end jutting out into water is called the distal end.

==Notable spits around the world==

There is debate as to the longest spit in the world, with both the Arabat Spit in the Sea of Azov and the Younghusband Peninsula in South Australia approximately long. Alternatively, with the natural closing of the Roanoke inlet in 1811, Bodie Island in North Carolina may qualify as the longest, also measuring in at approximately to the peninsula&#x27;s terminus at the Oregon Inlet.

The longest spit in a freshwater body of water is Long Point, Ontario, which extends approximately into Lake Erie.

Farewell Spit in New Zealand, at , in the north-west area of South Island, is believed to be caused by the strong prevailing winds and currents, bringing sand eroded from the Southern Alps of the South Island and depositing these into Golden Bay.

A well-known spit in the UK is Spurn Point at the Humber; it is approximately long. Another is Chesil Beach in the UK, which connects the Isle of Portland to the mainland.

The Curonian Spit, off the coast of Lithuania and Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia, separates the Curonian Lagoon from the Baltic Sea; it is . In a similar fashion, the Vistula Spit separates the Vistula Lagoon from the Gdańsk Bay off the coast of Poland.

Zlatni Rat, a popular pebble beach jutting southward from the harbor town of Bol, on the Croatian island of Brač, is formed by Adriatic currents flowing east and west through the Hvar Channel, along the southern side of the island. The spit bends slightly west or east, changing its direction gradually, depending on the conditions of the tides and weather.

==Human settlement patterns==
Since prehistory humans have chosen certain spit formations as sites for human habitation. In some cases, these sites have been chosen for proximity to marine resource exploitation; the Chumash Native American prehistorical settlement on the Morro Bay is one such location.

<doc id="297182" wikidata="Q509271" url="?curid=297182" title="Margery Kempe">
<text>Margery Kempe ( – after 1438) was an English Catholic mystic, known for writing through dictation &quot;The Book of Margery Kempe&quot;, a work considered by some to be the first autobiography in the English language. Her book chronicles her domestic tribulations, her extensive pilgrimages to holy sites in Europe and the Holy Land, as well as her mystical conversations with God. She is honoured in the Anglican Communion, but has not been canonised as a Catholic saint.

==Early life and family==
She was born Margery Burnham or Brunham around 1373 in Bishop&#x27;s Lynn (now King&#x27;s Lynn), Norfolk, England. Her father, John Brunham, was a merchant in Lynn, mayor of the town and Member of Parliament. The first record of her Brunham family is a mention of her grandfather, Ralph de Brunham, in 1320 in the &quot;Red Register&quot; of Lynn. By 1340, he had joined the Parliament of Lynn. Kempe&#x27;s kinsman Robert Brunham, possibly her brother, became a Member of Parliament for Lynn in 1402 and 1417.

==Life==

No records remain of any formal education that Kempe may have received. As an adult, a priest read to her &quot;works of religious devotion&quot; in English, which suggests that she might have been unable to read them herself, although she seems to have learned various texts by heart. Kempe appears to have been taught the Pater Noster (the Lord&#x27;s Prayer), Ave Maria, the Ten Commandments, and other &quot;virtues, vices, and articles of faith&quot;.

At around twenty years of age, Kempe married John Kempe, who became a town official in 1394. Margery and John had at least fourteen children. A letter survives from Gdańsk which identifies the name of her eldest son as John and gives a reason for his visit to Lynn in 1431.

Kempe, like other medieval mystics, believed that she was summoned to a &quot;greater intimacy with Christ&quot; as a result of multiple visions and experiences she had as an adult. After the birth of her first child, Kempe went through a period of crisis for nearly eight months, which may perhaps have been an episode of postpartum psychosis. During her illness, Kempe claimed to have envisioned numerous devils and demons attacking her and commanding her to &quot;forsake her faith, her family, and her friends&quot;. She claims that they even encouraged her to commit suicide. She also had a vision of Jesus Christ in the form of a man who asked her, &quot;Daughter, why have you forsaken me, and I never forsook you?&quot;.

Kempe affirms that she had visitations and conversations with Jesus, Mary, God, and other religious figures, and that she had visions of being an active participant during the birth and crucifixion of Christ. These visions and hallucinations physically affected her bodily senses, causing her to hear sounds and smell unknown, strange odours. She reported hearing a heavenly melody that made her weep and want to live a chaste life. According to Beal, &quot;Margery found other ways to express the intensity of her devotion to God. She prayed for a chaste marriage, went to confession two or three times a day, prayed early and often each day in church, wore a hair shirt, and willingly suffered whatever negative responses her community expressed in response to her extreme forms of devotion&quot;.

An explanation for bearing this scrutiny from others was her conversation held with the mystic Julian of Norwich, whom she travelled to meet. At the end of their conversation, Julian of Norwich implores that &quot;the more shame she [Kempe] elicits, the more merit she gains in the eyes of the Lord&quot;. Kempe was also known throughout her community for her constant weeping as she begged Christ for mercy and forgiveness.
In Kempe&#x27;s vision, Christ reassured her that he had forgiven her sins. &quot;He gave her several commands: to call him her love, to stop wearing the hair shirt, to give up eating meat, to take the Eucharist every Sunday, to pray the rosary only until six o&#x27;clock, to be still and speak to him in thought&quot;; he also promised her that he would &quot;give her victory over her enemies, give her the ability to answer all clerks, and that [He] will be with her and never forsake her, and to help her and never be parted from her&quot;. Kempe did not join a religious order, but carried out &quot;her life of devotion, prayer, and tears in public&quot;.

Her visions provoked her public displays of loud wailing, sobbing, and writhing, which frightened and annoyed both clergy and laypeople. At one point in her life, she was imprisoned by the clergy and town officials and threatened with the possibility of rape. However, she does not record being sexually assaulted. During the 1420s, she dictated her Book, known today as &quot;The Book of Margery Kempe&quot;, which illustrates her visions, mystical and religious experiences, as well as her &quot;temptations to lechery, her travels, and her trial for heresy&quot;. Kempe&#x27;s book is commonly considered to be the first autobiography written in the English language.

Kempe was tried for heresy multiple times but never convicted. She mentions with pride her ability to deny the accusations of Lollardy with which she was faced. Possible reasons for her arrests include her preaching, which was forbidden to women, her wearing of all white as a married woman, i.e., impersonating a nun, or her apparent belief that she could pray for the souls of those in purgatory and tell whether or not someone was damned, in a manner similar to the concept of the intercession of saints. Kempe was also accused of preaching without Church approval as her public speeches skirted a thin line between making statements about her personal faith and professing to teach scripture.

During an inquiry into her heresy she was thought to be possessed by a devil for quoting the scripture, and reminded of the prohibition against women preachers in 1 Timothy. Kempe proved to be something of a nuisance in the communities where she resided, as her frantic wailing and extreme emotional responses seemed to imply a superior connection to God that some other lay people saw as diminishing their own, or inappropriately privileged above the relationship between God and the clergy.

==Spiritual autobiography==

Nearly everything that is known of Kempe&#x27;s life comes from her spiritual autobiography known as the &quot;Book&quot;. In the early 1430s, despite her illiteracy, Kempe decided to record her spiritual life. In the preface to the book, she describes how she employed an Englishman as a scribe. He had lived in Germany, but he died before the work was completed and what he had written was unintelligible to others. This may possibly have been John Kempe, her eldest son. She then persuaded a local priest, who may have been her confessor Robert Springold, to begin rewriting on 23 July 1436. On 28 April 1438, he started work on an additional section covering the years 1431–4.

The narrative of Kempe&#x27;s &quot;Book&quot; begins with the difficult birth of her first child. After describing the demonic torment and Christic apparition that followed, Kempe undertook two domestic businesses: a brewery and a grain mill, both common home-based businesses for medieval women. Both failed after a short period of time. Although she tried to be more devout, she was tempted by sexual pleasures and social jealousy for some years. Eventually turning away from her worldly work, Kempe dedicated herself completely to the spiritual calling that she felt her earlier vision required.

In the summer of 1413, striving to live a life of commitment to God, Kempe negotiated a chaste marriage with her husband. Although chapter 15 of &quot;The Book of Margery Kempe&quot; describes her decision to lead a celibate life, chapter 21 mentions that she is pregnant once again. It has been speculated that Kempe gives birth to a child, her last, during her pilgrimage; she later relates that she brought a child with her when she returned to England. It is unclear whether the child was conceived before the Kempes began their celibacy, or in a momentary lapse after it.

Sometime around 1413, Kempe visited the female mystic and anchoress Julian of Norwich at her cell in Norwich. According to her own account, Kempe visited Julian and stayed for several days. She was especially eager to obtain Julian&#x27;s approval for her visions of and conversations with God. The text reports that Julian approved of Kempe&#x27;s revelations and gave Kempe reassurance that her religiosity was genuine. However, Julian instructed and cautioned Kempe to &quot;measure these experiences according to the worship they accrue to God and the profit to her fellow Christians.&quot; Julian also confirmed that Kempe&#x27;s tears were physical evidence of the Holy Spirit in soul. Kempe also received affirmation of her gifts of tears by way of approving comparison to a continental holy woman.

In chapter 62, Kempe describes an encounter with a friar who was relentless in his accusation for her incessant tears. The friar admitted to having read of Marie of Oignies and recognised that Kempe&#x27;s tears were also a result of similar authentic devotion. During this time, Kempe&#x27;s spiritual confessor was Richard Caister, the Vicar of St Stephen&#x27;s Church, Norwich, who was buried in the church in 1420. Kempe prayed at Caister&#x27;s burial place for the healing of a priest. After the priest was healed, Caister&#x27;s burial place became a shrine for pilgrimage.

In 1438, the year her book is known to have been completed, a &quot;Margueria Kempe&quot;, who may well have been Margery Kempe, was admitted to the Trinity Guild of Lynn. It is not known whether this is the same woman, and it is unknown when or where after this date Kempe died.

==Later influence==
The manuscript was copied, probably shortly before 1450, by someone who signed himself Salthows on the bottom portion of the final page. This scribe has been shown to be the Norwich monk Richard Salthouse. The manuscript contains annotations by four different writers. The first page of the manuscript contains the rubric &quot;Liber Montis Gracie. This boke is of Mountegrace,&quot; making certain that some of the annotations are the work of monks associated with the important Carthusian priory of Mount Grace in Yorkshire. Although the four readers largely concerned themselves with correcting mistakes or emending the manuscript for clarity, there are also remarks about the Book&#x27;s substance and some images which reflect Kempe&#x27;s themes and images. A recipe, added to the final folio of the manuscript by a late 14th- or early 15th-century reader of the Book, possibly at the cathedral priory in Norwich, provides more evidence of its readership and has been determined to be for medicinal sweets, or digestives, called &#x27;dragges&#x27;.

Kempe&#x27;s book was essentially lost for centuries, being known only from excerpts published by Wynkyn de Worde in around 1501, and by Henry Pepwell in 1521. In 1934, a manuscript, now British Library Add MS 61823, the only surviving manuscript of Kempe&#x27;s &quot;Book&quot;, was found in the private library of the Butler-Bowdon family, and then consulted by Hope Emily Allen. It has since been reprinted and translated in numerous editions.

==Significance==
Part of Kempe&#x27;s significance lies in the autobiographical nature of her book. It is the best insight available of a female middle-class experience in the Middle Ages. Kempe is unusual compared to contemporaneous holy women, such as Julian of Norwich, because she was not a nun. Although Kempe has sometimes been depicted as an &quot;oddity&quot; or a &quot;madwoman&quot;, more modern scholarship on vernacular theologies and popular practices of piety suggests she was not as odd as she might appear.

Her &quot;Book&quot; is revealed as a carefully constructed spiritual and social commentary. Some have suggested that it was written as fiction to explore the aspects of the society in which she lived in a believable way. The suggestion that Kempe wrote her book as a work of fiction is said to be supported by the fact that she speaks of herself as &quot;this creature&quot; throughout the text, dissociating her from her work.

Her autobiography begins with &quot;the onset of her spiritual quest, her recovery from the ghostly aftermath of her first child-bearing&quot;. There is no firm evidence that Kempe could read or write, but Leyser notes that her religious culture was certainly informed by texts. She had such works read to her, including the by Richard Rolle. Walter Hilton has been cited as another possible influence upon Kempe. Among other books that Kempe had read to her were, repeatedly, the &quot;Revelations&quot; of Bridget of Sweden. Her own pilgrimages were related to those of that married saint, who had had eight children.

Kempe and her &quot;Book&quot; are significant because they express the tension in late medieval England between institutional orthodoxy, and increasingly public modes of religious dissent, especially those of the Lollards. Throughout her spiritual career, Kempe was challenged by both church and civil authorities on her adherence to the teachings of the institutional Church. The Bishop of Lincoln and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Arundel, were involved in trials of her allegedly teaching and preaching on scripture and faith in public, and wearing white clothes, interpreted as hypocrisy on the part of a married woman. In his efforts to suppress heresy, Arundel had enacted laws that forbade allowing women to preach, since the very fact of a woman preaching was seen as anti-canonical.

In the 15th century, a pamphlet was published that represented Kempe as an anchoress and stripped from her &quot;Book&quot; any potential heterodoxical thought or dissenting behaviour. That made some later scholars believe that she was a vowed religious holy woman like Julian of Norwich, and they were surprised to encounter the psychologically and spiritually complex woman revealed in the original text of the &quot;Book&quot;.

==Mysticism==
In the 14th century, the task of interpreting the Bible and God through the written word was nominally restricted to men, specifically ordained priests. Because of this restriction, women mystics often expressed their experience of God differently – through the senses and the body – especially in the late Middle Ages. Mystics directly experienced God in three classical ways: first, bodily visions, meaning to be aware with one&#x27;s senses – sight, sound, or others; second, ghostly visions, such as spiritual visions and sayings directly imparted to the soul; and lastly, intellectual enlightenment, where one&#x27;s mind came into a new understanding of God.

Margery Kempe&#x27;s style of mysticism was very participatory, judging by the fact that, along with her visions, she had specific actions that she would complete as a way of devoting herself to God. Namely, Kempe wept frequently as a way of showing her religiosity. There was another, perhaps more important, purpose associated with her weeping; that is, she could &quot;win many souls from him [the Devil] with your weeping&quot;.

==Pilgrimages==

Kempe was motivated to make a pilgrimage by hearing or reading the English translation of Bridget of Sweden&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. This work promotes the purchase of indulgences at holy sites. These were pieces of paper representing the pardoning by the Church of purgatorial time, otherwise owed after death due to sins. Kempe went on many pilgrimages and is known to have purchased indulgences for friends, enemies, the souls trapped in Purgatory and herself.

=== First Great Pilgrimage, 1413–1415 ===
In 1413, soon after her father&#x27;s death, Kempe left her husband to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. During the winter, she spent 13 weeks in Venice but she talks little about her observations of Venice in her book. At the time Venice was at &quot;the height of its medieval splendor, rich in commerce and holy relics.&quot; From Venice, Kempe travelled to Jerusalem via Ramlah.

Kempe&#x27;s voyage from Venice to Jerusalem is not a large part of her story overall. It is thought that she passed through Jaffa, which was the usual port for pilgrims who were heading to Jerusalem. One vivid detail that she recalls was her riding on a donkey when she saw Jerusalem for the first time, probably from Nabi Samwil, and that she nearly fell off the donkey because she was in such shock from the vision in front of her.

During her pilgrimage Kempe visited places that she saw to be holy. She was in Jerusalem for three weeks and went to Bethlehem where Christ was born. She visited Mount Zion, which was where she believed Jesus had washed his disciples&#x27; feet. Kempe visited the burial places of Jesus, his mother Mary and the cross itself. She went to the River Jordan and Mount Quarentyne, which was where they believed Jesus had fasted for forty days, and Bethany, where Martha, Mary and Lazarus had lived.

After she visited the Holy Land, Kempe returned to Italy and stayed in Assisi before going to Rome. Like many other medieval English pilgrims, Kempe resided at the Hospital of Saint Thomas of Canterbury in Rome. During her stay, she visited many churches including San Giovanni in Laterano, Santa Maria Maggiore, Santi Apostoli, San Marcello and St Birgitta&#x27;s Chapel. She left Rome in Easter 1415. When Kempe returned to Norwich, she passed through Middelburg, in today&#x27;s Netherlands.

=== Pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, 1417–1418 ===
In 1417, Kempe set off on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in Spain, travelling via Bristol, where she stayed at Henbury with Thomas Peverel, bishop of Worcester. On her return from Spain she visited the shrine of the holy blood at Hailes Abbey, in Gloucestershire, and then went to Leicester.

Kempe recounts several public interrogations during her travels. One followed her arrest by the Mayor of Leicester who accused her, in Latin, of being a &quot;cheap whore, a lying Lollard,&quot; and threatened her with prison. After Kempe was able to insist on the right of accusations to be made in English and to defend herself she was briefly cleared, but then brought to trial again by the Abbot, Dean and Mayor, and imprisoned for three weeks.

After this, Kempe continued to York. Here, she had many friends with whom she wept and attended Mass. She encountered further accusation, specifically of heresy, of which she was eventually found innocent by the Archbishop. She returned to Lynn some time in 1418.

She visited important sites and religious figures in England, including Philip Repyngdon (the Bishop of Lincoln), Henry Chichele, and Thomas Arundel, both Archbishops of Canterbury. In the 1420s, Kempe lived apart from her husband. When he fell ill, however, she returned to Lynn to be his nursemaid. Their son, who lived in Germany, also returned to Lynn with his wife. Both her son and husband died in 1431.

=== Pilgrimage to Prussia, 1433–1434 ===
The last section of Kempe&#x27;s book deals with a journey, beginning in April 1433, aiming to travel to Danzig with her daughter-in-law. From Danzig, Kempe visited the Holy Blood of Wilsnack relic. She then travelled to Aachen, and returned to Lynn via Calais, Canterbury and London, where she visited Syon Abbey.

==Veneration==
Margery Kempe is honoured in the Church of England with a commemoration on 9 November and in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America together with Richard Rolle and Walter Hilton on 9 November.

==Memorials==
In 2018, the Mayor of King&#x27;s Lynn, Nick Daubney, unveiled a bench commemorating Kempe in the Saturday Market Place. The bench was designed by local furniture-maker, Toby Winteringham, and sponsored by the King&#x27;s Lynn Civic Society.

There is a Margery Kempe Society, founded in 2018 by Laura Kalas of Swansea University and Laura Varnam of University College, Oxford, whose aim is the support and promotion of the scholarship, study and teaching of &quot;The Book of Margery Kempe&quot;.

In 2020, a statue in honour of Kempe was erected at the entrance of a medieval bridge in Oroso in Northern Spain, on the pilgrimage trail she would have followed to Santiago de Compostela.

A sculpture of Kempe, entitled &#x27;A Woman in Motion&#x27;, was installed in King&#x27;s Lynn Minster in 2023. It is made of aluminium and depicts Kempe wearing a wide-brimmed hat typical of medieval pilgrims with her head bowed in prayer.

<text>Charaka was one of the principal contributors to Ayurveda, a system of medicine and lifestyle developed in ancient India. He is known as a physician who edited the medical treatise entitled &quot;Charaka Samhita&quot;, one of the foundational texts of classical Indian medicine and Ayurveda, included under Brhat-Trayi.

Charaka, also known as Charak acharya, was an ancient Indian physician and scholar who made significant contributions to the field of Ayurveda. Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in Indian subcontinent.

Charaka is believed to have lived during the 4th century BCE, although the exact dates of his birth and death are uncertain. He is considered one of the principal contributors to the Charaka Samhita, an ancient Ayurvedic text that is one of the foundational texts of Ayurvedic medicine.

The Charaka Samhita is a comprehensive treatise on various aspects of medicine, including etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and ethical considerations. It covers a wide range of topics, including anatomy, physiology, herbal medicine, surgical techniques, and the use of minerals and metals in medicine.

Charaka&#x27;s approach to medicine was holistic and focused on understanding the body as a whole. He emphasized the importance of maintaining a balance among the three doshas (vata, pitta, and kapha) and believed that disease resulted from an imbalance in these doshas. His treatments aimed to restore this balance through dietary changes, herbal remedies, lifestyle modifications, and therapies such as massage and detoxification.

== Date ==
After surveying and evaluating all past scholarship on the subject of Charaka&#x27;s date, Meulenbeld concluded that, the author called Charaka cannot have lived later than about 150-200 CE and not much earlier than about 100 BCE. Maharishi Charaka is also known as the court physician during the reign of the famous king Kanishka of Kushan Empire.

Charaka has been identified by some as a native of Kashmir. Professor Sylvain Lévi after discovering Buddhist manuscripts in Central Asia and China, came to the conclusion that the famous Charaka, the author of Charaka Samhita belonged to Kashmir. The recension of the text available to us today was done by Acharya Dridhabala, a scholar of Kashmir. Jejjata, the author of commentary on the Charaka Samhita, was also Kashmiri and so was Udbhatta who commented upon Sushruta Samhita.

Charaka is also associated with the University of Taxila.

==Charaka and the Ayurveda ==

The term Charaka is a label said to apply to &quot;wandering scholars&quot; or &quot;wandering physicians&quot;. According to Charaka&#x27;s translations, health and disease are not predetermined and life may be prolonged by human effort and attention to lifestyle .

Charaka seems to have been an early proponent of &quot;prevention is better than cure&quot; doctrine. The following statement is attributed to Charaka:
A body functions because it contains three &quot;dosha&quot; or principles, namely movement (vata), transformation (pitta) and lubrication and stability (kapha). The doshas correspond to the Western classification of humors, wind, bile, and phlegm. These doshas are produced when &quot;dhatus&quot; (blood, flesh and marrow) act upon the food eaten. For the same quantity of food eaten, one body, however, produces &quot;dosha&quot; in an amount different from another body. That is why one body is different from another.

Further, he stressed, illness is caused when the balance among the three doshas in a human body are disturbed. To restore the balance he prescribed medicinal drugs. He also describes various parasitic worms(krimi).

Charaka studied the anatomy of the human body and various organs. He gave 360 as the total number of bones, including teeth, present in the human body. He considered the heart to be a &quot;controlling centre&quot; . He claimed that the heart was connected to the entire body through 13 main channels. Apart from these channels, there were countless other ones of varying sizes which supplied not only nutrients to various organs but also provided passage to waste products. He also claimed that any obstruction in the main channels led to a disease or deformity in the body .

== Charaka Samhita ==
Agnivesha, under the guidance of the ancient physician Atreya, composed an encyclopedic medical compendium in the eighth century BCE, the &quot;Agnivesha Samhitā&quot;. The work received little attention. The &quot;Agnivesha Samhitā&quot; was revised by Charaka and renamed the &quot;Charaka Samhitā&quot;. In this form it became well known. The &quot;Charaka Samhitā&quot; was itself later supplemented with an extra seventeen chapters added by the author , while retaining its name. The &quot;Charaka Samhita&quot; is one of the two foundational text of Ayurveda, the other being the &quot;Sushruta Samhita&quot;. For two millennia it remained a standard work on the subject and was translated into many foreign languages, including Arabic and Latin.

<doc id="297186" wikidata="Q2339246" url="?curid=297186" title="John Suckling (poet)">
<text>Sir John Suckling (10 February 1609 – after May 1641) was an English poet, prominent among those renowned for careless gaiety and wit – the accomplishments of a cavalier poet. He also invented the card game cribbage. He is best known for his poem &quot;Ballade upon a Wedding&quot;.

==Birth==
Suckling was born at Whitton, in the parish of Twickenham, Middlesex, and baptized there on 10 February 1609. His father, Sir John Suckling, was Secretary of State under James I and Comptroller of the Household of Charles I. His mother was Elizabeth Cranfield, sister of Sir Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex.

==Life==
The poet inherited his father&#x27;s estate at the age of 18, having attended Trinity College, Cambridge from 1623 and enrolled at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1627. His intimates included Ben Jonson, Thomas Carew, Richard Lovelace, Thomas Nabbes and especially John Hales and Sir William Davenant, who later furnished John Aubrey with information about him. In 1628, Suckling left London for France and Italy, returning before the autumn of 1630, when he was knighted. In 1631 he volunteered for a force raised by the Marquess of Hamilton to serve under Gustavus Adolphus in Germany. He was back at Whitehall in May 1632, having taken part in the Battle of Breitenfeld and several sieges.

Suckling&#x27;s poetic talent was one of many accomplishments, but commended him especially to Charles I and his queen, Henrietta Maria. He says of himself (&quot;A Sessions of the Poets&quot;) that he &quot;prized black eyes or a lucky hit at bowls above all the trophies of wit.&quot; Aubrey says he invented the game of cribbage and relates that his sisters came weeping to a bowling green at Piccadilly to dissuade him from play, lest he lose their portions.

Suckling was so passionately fond of cards that he frequently spent a whole morning in bed with a pack, studying the subtleties of his favourite games. He was not only the most skilful card-player, but also the best bowler in England. Suckling is said to have sent numerous packs of marked playing cards to aristocratic houses in England and then travelled around playing cribbage with the gentry. He managed to win around £20,000.

In 1634, scandal was caused in his circle by a beating he received at the hands of Sir John Digby, a rival suitor for the daughter of Sir John Willoughby. It has been suggested that the incident, narrated at length in a letter of 10 November 1634 from George Garrard to Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, had something to do with his beginning to seek more serious society. In 1635 he retired to his estates in obedience to an order of 20 June 1632 enforced by the Star Chamber against absentee landlordism, and employed his time in literary pursuits. In 1637 &quot;A Sessions of the Poets&quot; was circulated in manuscript, and about the same time he wrote a tract on Socinianism: &quot;An Account of Religion by Reason&quot; (printed 1646).

In 1639, Suckling assisted King Charles I in his first Scottish war, raising a troop of a hundred horse at a cost of £12,000, and accompanying Charles on the Scottish expedition of 1639. &quot;Putnam&#x27;s Monthly Magazine of American Literature&quot; states,

The amusing &quot;pasquil&quot; was &quot;On Sir John Suckling&#x27;s most warlike preparations for the Scottish war&quot; in &quot;Musarum deliciae&quot; (printed 1656).

Suckling was elected as member for Bramber in Sussex at a by-election on 30 April 1640, during the Short Parliament. It was complained he had won by &quot;undue means&quot;, but the parliament was dissolved on 5 May in any case.

That winter Suckling wrote a letter to Henry Jermyn, afterwards Earl of St Albans, advising the king to disconcert the opposition leaders by making more concessions than they asked for. In May the following year he was implicated in the First Army Plot, an attempt to rescue the Earl of Strafford from the Tower and bring in French troops to the king&#x27;s aid. This was exposed by the evidence of Colonel George Goring. Suckling left London with Jermyn and others on 6 May 1641 to flee to France; they were found guilty of high treason in their absence by Parliament on 13 August 1641.

The circumstances of his short exile are obscure and accounts of how he died vary. Alexander Pope, writing in the next century, stated he had died on arriving in Calais, of fever from a wound in his foot caused by a nail having been driven into his boot by a servant who absconded with his money and papers. He was certainly in Paris in the summer of 1641, when on 3 July Sir Francis Windebanke wrote to his son that Parliament had stopped pensions it had been paying to himself, Suckling and Jermyn. One pamphlet related a story of elopement with a lady to Spain, where he fell into the hands of the Inquisition. Generally accepted is Aubrey&#x27;s statement that he committed suicide by poison in Paris, for fear of poverty. He was buried there at a Protestant cemetery. A pamphlet, &quot;An Elegy on the Renowned Sir John Sutling&quot; (sic) was written in February 1642 or earlier.

==Dramatic works==
As a dramatist Suckling is noteworthy for applying to regular drama the accessories being used in the production of masques. His &quot;Aglaura&quot; (printed 1638) was produced at his own expense with elaborate scenery. Even the lace on the actors&#x27; coats was of real gold and silver. The play, despite its felicity of diction, lacks dramatic interest. The criticism of Richard Flecknoe (&quot;Short Discourse of the English Stage&quot;) that it seemed &quot;full of flowers, but rather stuck in than growing there,&quot; has some weight. &quot;The Goblins&quot; (1638, printed 1646) has some reminiscences of &quot;The Tempest&quot;; &quot;Brennoralt&quot;, or the &quot;Discontented Colonel&quot; (1639, printed 1646) is a satire on the Scots, disguised as Lithuanian rebels in the play. A fourth play, &quot;The Sad One&quot;, was left unfinished due to the outbreak of the Civil War.

According to Samuel Pepys&#x27;s diary (23 January 1666/67), he was persuaded to see &quot;the dancing preparatory to to-morrow for &#x27;The Goblins,&#x27; a play of Suckling&#x27;s, not acted these twenty-five years; which was pretty.&quot;

==Poetry==

Among the best known of his minor pieces are the &quot;Ballade upon a Wedding&quot;, for the marriage of Roger Boyle, afterwards Earl of Orrery, and Lady Margaret Howard, &quot;,&quot; &quot;Out upon it, I have loved three whole days together,&quot; and &quot;&quot; from &quot;Aglaura&quot;.

&quot;A Sessions of the Poets&quot;, describes a meeting of contemporary versifiers under the presidency of Apollo to decide who should wear the laurel wreath. It is the prototype of many later satires.

A collection of Suckling&#x27;s poems first appeared in 1646 as &quot;Fragmenta Aurea&quot;. The &quot;Selections&quot; (1836) published by Alfred Inigo Suckling is in fact a complete edition, of which WC Hazlitt&#x27;s edition (1874; revised 1892) is little more than a reprint with some additions. &quot;The Poems and Songs of Sir John Suckling&quot;, edited by John Gray and decorated with woodcut border and initials by Charles Ricketts, was artistically printed at the Ballantyne Press in 1896. In 1910 Suckling&#x27;s works in prose and verse were edited by A. Hamilton Thompson.

For anecdotes of Suckling&#x27;s life see John Aubrey&#x27;s &quot;Brief Lives&quot; (Clarendon Press ed., ii.242).

<text>Alessandro de&#x27; Medici (22 July 1510 – 6 January 1537), nicknamed &quot;il Moro&quot; due to his dark complexion, Duke of Penne and the first Duke of the Florentine Republic (from 1532), was ruler of Florence from 1530 to his death in 1537. The first Medici to rule Florence as a hereditary monarch, Alessandro was also the last Medici from the senior line of the family to lead the city. His assassination at the hands of distant cousin Lorenzaccio caused the title of Duke to pass to Cosimo I de Medici, from the family&#x27;s junior branch.

==Life==
Born in Florence, Alessandro was recognized by a plurality of his contemporaries as the only son of Lorenzo II de&#x27; Medici, Duke of Urbino, grandson of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici &quot;the Magnificent&quot;. Others believed him to be the illegitimate son of Giulio de&#x27; Medici (later Pope Clement VII), but at the time that was a minority view. Scipione Ammirato, the court historian of the Medicean grand duchy writes that &quot;...some whose authority is credible and that have obtained this secret from penetralia servants, think he was son of Clement, born of a servant of the house when he was a knight of Saint John.&quot;

His nickname &quot;il Moro&quot; is attributed to his relatively dark pigmentation.

Some historians, such as Christopher Hibbert, present two hypotheses as to Alessandro de Medici&#x27;s ancestry: he was &quot;rumoured to be Cardinal Giulio&#x27;s son by either a Moorish slave or a peasant woman from the Roman Campagna&quot;. His mother was identified in documents as Simonetta da Collevecchio. French author Jean Nestor reported in the 1560s that the claim of a Moorish slave origin was a false rumor first spread by Alessandro&#x27;s exiled enemies in Naples. University of Florence historian Giorgio Spini too described this rumour as unfounded, instead tracing Alessandro&#x27;s mother to a peasant from the Roman countryside who would later go on to marry a carrier from Lazio.

===Early life===
Alessandro spent his early childhood in Rome, where he received a humanist education by Pierio Valeriano Bolzani, under the supervision of Pope Leo X and Cardinal Giulio de’ Medici. During those years, a number of unexpected deaths occurred in the Medici family’s senior line: Giuliano de&#x27; Medici, Duke of Nemours (1516); Lorenzo II de&#x27; Medici, Duke of Urbino (1519); and eventually Pope Leo X (1521). This prompted Cardinal Giulio (then Gran Maestro of Florence, later Pope Clement VII), to relocate the remaining Medici heirs to Poggio a Caiano, near Florence: Alessandro; his half-sister Catherine, (later Queen Consort of France); and his cousin Ippolito, (later Vice-Chancellor of the Catholic Church). In 1522, Cardinal Giulio purchased the title &#x27;Duke of Penne&#x27; for Alessandro from Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor.

When Cardinal Giulio became Pope Clement VII in 1523, he left leadership of Florence to Alessandro and Ippolito, under the regency of Papal representative Cardinal Silvio Passerini. Unfortunately, Alessandro and Ippolito were “alike in one respect only, their mutual hatred of each other.” They openly feuded throughout their short lives. Passerini was extremely unpopular with the anti-Medici faction in Florence, as well as with members of the Medici family such as Clarice Strozzi, daughter of Piero the Unfortunate. She disparaged not only Passerini but Alessandro as well, calling him unworthy of the family name. Outrage over the Medici-backed Passerini regency led to a popular revolt four years later.

During the Sack of Rome in 1527, a faction of Florentines overthrew the Medici and installed a theocratic, Savonarola-influenced Republic. Alessandro and Ippolito de&#x27; Medici were advised to leave the city with Cardinal Passerini. Many of the Medicis’ main supporters fled Florence; but eight-year-old Catherine de&#x27; Medici was left behind. Alessandro lived in exile for the next three years.

===Duke of Florence===

In 1530, after a nearly ten month siege of Florence supported by Spanish troops, Alessandro was named head of state. Pope Clement VII chose him for the position over Ippolito, who was made cardinal. Clement’s choice increased tension between the Medici cousins; for the rest of Ippolito’s life, he spoke openly about wanting to overthrow Alessandro and lead Florence. Alessandro arrived in Florence to rule on 5 July 1531. Nine months later he was made hereditary duke by Charles, as Tuscany was technically part of the Holy Roman Empire. This ended the Florentine Republic and started over 200 years of Medici monarchy.

The Florentine Constitution of 1532 consolidated Duke Alessandro’s power. While Clement lived, Alessandro ruled &quot;with the advice of elected councils, trying to calm the nerves of the defeated republicans&quot;; however, as his reign progressed he showed authoritarian tendencies. In 1534, he ordered construction of Florence’s Fortezza da Basso, “to secure the Medici’s control of the city following their recent return after the Siege of Florence, and to provide lodging for a massive contingent of troops.”
Duke Alessandro’s government drew both praise and criticism. His “common sense and his feeling for justice won his subjects’ affection”; and he “enjoyed some status as the champion of the poor and the helpless, as ballads and novelle record.” He was also a patron of the arts, commissioning notable works by Giorgio Vasari, Jacopo Pontormo, Benvenuto Cellini, and Antonio da Sangallo the Younger. Conversely, Florence’s vocal exile community judged his rule as harsh, depraved, and incompetent, an assessment debated by historians. In 1535, the exiles enlisted Cardinal Ippolito to meet with Emperor Charles V to denounce Alessandro&#x27;s government; however, en route to the meeting, Ippolito died under questionable circumstances. Rumors spread that he was poisoned on Alessandro&#x27;s orders. After the exiles voiced their complaints to Charles, Florentine diplomat Francesco Guicciardini responded, “his Excellency’s virtue, his fame, the opinion of him held throughout the city, of his prudence, of his virtuous habits, are a sufficient reply&quot;. Emperor Charles dismissed the complaints, continuing to support Alessandro.

In 1536, Emperor Charles kept a promise to Pope Clement by marrying his daughter, Margaret of Austria, to Duke Alessandro. He seems to have remained faithful to one mistress, Taddea Malaspina, who bore his only children: Giulio de&#x27; Medici (c. 1533/37–1600), who had illegitimate issue, and Giulia de&#x27; Medici.

==Assassination==

In 1537, Duke Alessandro&#x27;s distant cousin and close friend Lorenzino de&#x27; Medici, &quot;Lorenzaccio&quot; (&quot;bad Lorenzo&quot;), assassinated him. The event is the subject of Alfred de Musset’s play &quot;Lorenzaccio&quot;; Alexandre Dumas’ play &quot;Lorenzino&quot;; and the basis for Thomas Middleton’s play &quot;The Revenger&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;, among other works.

On 5/6 January, the Night of Epiphany, Lorenzino entrapped Duke Alessandro through the ruse of a promised sexual encounter with a beautiful widow. As Duke Alessandro waited alone and unarmed, Lorenzino and his servant Piero di Giovannabate, also called Scoronconcolo, ambushed him and &quot;stabbed Alessandro with a dagger several times while the Duke fought back to the point that he bit off a significant portion of one of Lorenzino&#x27;s fingers. Eventually, Alessandro succumbed to his wounds and Lorenzino and Scoronconcolo fled from the palace – after locking the door to the chamber to prevent their crime from being discovered too quickly.&quot;

For fear of starting an uprising if news of his death became public, Medici officials wrapped Alessandro&#x27;s corpse in a carpet and secretly carried it to the cemetery of San Lorenzo, where it was hurriedly buried. In Valladolid, Spain, at the imperial court of Charles V, a solemn funeral was held for Alessandro.

Lorenzino, in a declaration published later, said that he had killed Alessandro to preserve the Republic of Florence. When Florence&#x27;s anti-Medici faction failed to rise, Lorenzino fled to Venice, where he was killed in 1548 at the direct orders of Emperor Charles V. Florence&#x27;s Medici supporters – called Palleschi from the balls on the Medici arms – ensured that power passed to Cosimo, the first of the &quot;junior&quot; branch of the Medici to rule Florence.

Alessandro was survived by two illegitimate children: son Giulio (aged four at the time of his father&#x27;s death) married to Angelica Malaspina, and daughter Giulia, married firstly to Francesco Cantelmo, the Duke of Popoli, and then to Bernadetto de&#x27; Medici, the Prince of Ottajano.

== Popular culture ==
The 2023 Italian short film &quot;Il Moro&quot; directed by Daphne di Cinto is based on Alessandro de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s life. The film has won several awards and was considered for the 96th Academy Awards in the Best Live Action Short Film category. Because of a petition started by di Cinto, the Council of Florence voted in favor of placing de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s name in front of his tombstone, where previously his name had not been inscribed.

<doc id="297191" wikidata="Q7888062" url="?curid=297191" title="United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1968">
<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1968 with the song &quot;Congratulations&quot;, written by Bill Martin and Phil Coulter, and performed by Cliff Richard. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final, after having previously selected the performer internally. In addition, the BBC was also the host broadcaster and staged the event at the Royal Albert Hall in London, after winning the with the song &quot;Puppet on a String&quot; by Sandie Shaw.

==Before Eurovision==
=== Artist selection ===
Cilla Black had been the BBC&#x27;s first choice to sing the 1968 British entry, but she had turned it down as she did not believe any nation was likely to win back-to-back contests. As in 1967 when the UK won with Sandie Shaw, a current pop singer, Cliff Richard, was chosen to sing the song.

===&quot;A Song for Europe 1968&quot;===
The show was held on 5 March 1968 and presented by Cilla Black as a special edition of her debut BBC1 TV series &quot;Cilla&quot;. Unlike the last three UK selections, the songs were not presented at all before the final. Instead, for the first time, the songs were broadcast twice in the final, with the performances repeated immediately after Richard had sung them successively. Viewers cast votes by postcard via mail to choose the winner and 171,300 chose &quot;Congratulations&quot;, a catchy party song, with the runner up over 140,000 behind in the poll. The result was broadcast one week later on 12 March 1968. The votes presented below were only announced rounded up.
=== Chart success ===
Richard released all six short listed songs on an Extended Play maxi single titled &quot;Congratulations: Cliff sings 6 Songs for Europe&quot;, with the winner and the runner up being released on a standard single that spent two weeks at No.1 in the UK Singles Chart. This was the first of only two tracks from the Eurovision Song Contest that topped the UK chart without winning the competition. Cliff recorded French, German, Italian and Spanish versions of the winning song, as well as a German version of &quot;Wonderful World&quot;, which was also recorded (in English) by Elvis Presley.

== At Eurovision ==
&quot;Congratulations&quot; won the national and went on to come a close second in the contest, losing only to Spain by one point.

The contest was broadcast on BBC1, with a colour re-broadcast on BBC2 the next day at 16:30 (BST). It was also broadcast on radio stations BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 2 (both with commentary by Pete Murray).

The BBC appointed Michael Aspel as its spokesperson to announce the British jury&#x27;s votes.

=== Voting ===



==&quot;Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest&quot;==

In 2005, &quot;Congratulations&quot; was one of fourteen songs chosen by Eurovision fans and an EBU reference group to participate in the &quot;Congratulations&quot; anniversary competition. It was one of two British entries to appear in the main competition (along with &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot;). The song was drawn to perform first, preceding &quot;What&#x27;s Another Year&quot; by Johnny Logan.

At the end of the first round, &quot;Congratulations&quot; was not among the five songs proceeding to the final round. It was later revealed that &quot;Congratulations&quot; finished eighth with 105 points.

<doc id="297192" wikidata="Q1039624" url="?curid=297192" title="Janusz A. Zajdel Award">
<text>The Janusz A. Zajdel Award (&quot;Nagroda imienia Janusza A. Zajdla&quot;), often called just Zajdel,
is the annual award given by the Polish science fiction and fantasy fandom for the best stories published in the previous year. It was established in 1984. 

It is the most prestigious of several Polish awards for that genre of literature. 

== Categories ==
The winners are chosen in a vote by fans present at the annual Polcon convention from up to five nominations in each of two categories:
*Novel: works longer than approximately 30,000 words
*Short story: shorter works.

Instant-runoff voting with &quot;No award&quot; as one of the choices is the method used.
Vote counts are not announced.

==History==
Previously the Polish Union of Fans of Science Fiction (Polskie Stowarzyszenie Miłośników Fantastyki) issued the for works of science fiction (1983-1986).

The Zajdel award was created in 1984 (to be awarded from 1985) under the name &quot;Sfinks&quot; (not to be confused with the , an award of the magazine). After the death of the first winner, Janusz A. Zajdel, in 1985, the name was changed in his memory. Zajdel&#x27;s widow, Jadwiga Zajdel, has presented the award to the winners since then.

Until 1989, the award was given by Polish science fiction fan associations, voting as units; since 1990, all fans present at Polcon convention can vote. Since 1991 the system has been based on two-tier ballot, compared to the system used in the Hugo Award. 

Until 1991, there was a single award given for the best story; since 1992, there are two categories: novel and short story. The year 1991 also saw the introduction of the Zajdel statuette, designed by sculptor .

<text>Thomas Nabbes (1605 – buried 6 April 1641) was an English dramatist.

He was born in humble circumstances in Worcestershire, was educated at as a King&#x27;s scholar at the King&#x27;s School, Worcester (1616–1620), and entered Exeter College, Oxford in 1621. He left the university without taking a degree, and in about 1630 began a career in London as a dramatist. He was employed at some point in the household of a nobleman near Worcester, and seems to have been of a convivial disposition. He had at least two children, Bridget and William, both of whom died within two years of his death, and were buried with him at St Giles in the Fields.

==Works==
About 1630 Nabbes seems to have settled in London, resolved to try his fortunes as a dramatist. He was always a stranger to the best literary society, but found congenial companions in Chamberlain, Jordan, Marmion, and Tatham, and was known to many &quot;gentlemen of the Inns of Court&quot; (cf. Bride, Ded.) About January 1632–1633 his first comedy, &quot;Covent Garden&quot;, was acted by the queen&#x27;s servants, and was published in 1638 with a modest dedication addressed to Sir John Suckling. In the prologue he defends himself from stealing the title of the piece—in allusion doubtless to Richard Brome&#x27;s &quot;Covent Garden Weeded&quot;, acted in 1632—and describes his &quot;muse&quot; as &quot;solitary&quot;. His second comedy, &quot;Totenham Court&quot;, was acted at the private house in Salisbury Court in 1633, and was also printed in 1638, with a dedication to William Mills. A third piece, &quot;Hannibal and Scipio, an hystorical Tragedy&quot;, in five acts of blank verse, was produced in 1635 by the queen&#x27;s servants at their private house in Drury Lane. Nabbes obviously modelled his play upon Marston&#x27;s &quot;Sophonisba&quot;. It was published in 1637, with a list of the actors&#x27; names. A third comedy, &quot;The Bride&quot;, acted at the private house in Drury Lane, again by the queen&#x27;s servants, in 1638, was published two years later, with a prefatory epistle addressed &quot;to the generalty of his noble friends, gentlemen of the severall honorable houses of the Inns of Court&quot;. One of the characters, Mrs. Ferret, the imperious wife, has been compared to Ben Jonson&#x27;s Mistress Otter.

Gerard Langbaine, in his &quot;An Account of the English Dramatic Poets&quot; (1691), places Nabbes among the poets of the third rate. The author of Theophilus Cibber&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland, to the Time of Dean Swift&quot; (1753) declares that in strict justice &quot;he cannot rise above a fifth.&quot; This severe verdict is ill justified. He is a passable writer of comedies, inventing his own plots, and lightly censuring the foibles of middle-class London society. Samuel Sheppard in the sixth sestiad (&quot;The Assizes of Apollo&quot;) of his &quot;Times Display&#x27;d&quot; (1646), associates Nabbes&#x27;s name with the names of John Davenant, James Shirley, Francis Beaumont, and John Fletcher, and selects his tragedy of &quot;Hannibal and Scipio&quot; for special commendation. Nabbes displays a satisfactory command of the niceties of dramatic blank verse, in which all his plays, excluding the two earliest comedies, were mainly written. Although he was far more refined in sentiment than most of his contemporaries, he is capable at times of considerable coarseness.

As a writer of masques Nabbes deserves more consideration. His touch was usually light and his machinery ingenious. The least satisfactory was the one first published, viz. &quot;Microcosmus. A Morall Maske, presented with generall liking, at the Private House in Salisbury Court, and heere set down according to the intention of the Authour, Thomas Nabbes&quot;, (1637). A reference to the approaching publication of the work was made in &quot;Don Zara del Fogo&quot;, a mock romance, which was written before 1637, though not published until 1656. Richard Brome contributed prefatory verses. His &quot;Spring&#x27;s Glory&quot; (1638) bears some resemblance to Thomas Middleton&#x27;s &quot;Inner Temple Masque&quot;, published in 1618. The &quot;Presentation intended for the Prince his Highnesse on his Birthday&quot; (1638) is bright and attractive, although it does not appear to have been actually performed. It was printed with &quot;The Spring&#x27;s Glory&quot;, together with some occasional verses. The volume, which was dedicated to William, son of Peter Balle, was entitled &quot;The Spring&#x27;s Glory, a Maske. Together with sundry Poems, Epigrams, Elegies, and Epithalamiums. By Thomas Nabbes&quot; (1639). Of the poems, the verses on a &quot;Mistresse of whose Affection hee was doubtfull&quot; have charm; they were included in William James Linton&#x27;s &quot;Collection of Rare Poems&quot;. Nabbes contributed commendatory verses to Shackerley Marmion&#x27;s &quot;Legend of Cupid and Psyche&quot; (1637); Robert Chamberlain&#x27;s &quot;Nocturnal Lucubrations&quot;, 1638; Thomas Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Poeticall Varieties&quot;, 1640; John Tatham&#x27;s &quot;Fancies Theater&quot;, 1640; Humphrey Mills&#x27;s &quot;A Night&#x27;s Search&quot;, 1640; Thomas Beedome&#x27;s &quot;Poems Divine and Humane&quot;, 1641; and the &quot;Phœnix of these Late Times; or, the Life of Mr. Henry Welby, Esq.&quot; (1637). Henry Welby was an eccentric, who was credited with living without food or drink for the last forty-four years of his life. To the fifth edition of Richard Knolles&#x27;s &quot;Generall Historie of the Turkes&quot; (1638) Nabbes appended &quot;A Continuation of the Turkish Historie, from the Yeare of our Lord 1628 to the end of the Yeare 1637. Collected out of the Dispatches of Sr. Peter Wyche, Knight, Embassador at Constantinople, and others&quot;. The dedication is addressed to Sir Thomas Roe, whom Nabbes describes as a stranger to him.

Nabbes&#x27; verse is smooth and musical. His language is sometimes coarse, but his general attitude is moral. &quot;The Masque of Microcosmus&quot; is really a morality play, in which Physander after much error is reunited to his wife Bellanima, who personifies the soul. The other two masques, slighter in construction but ingenious, show Nabbes at his best. Nabbes&#x27;s plays were collected in 1639; and &quot;Microcosmus&quot; was printed in Robert Dodsley&#x27;s &quot;Old Plays&quot; (1744). All his works, with the exception of his continuation of Knolles&#x27;s history, were reprinted by A. H. Bullen in &quot;Old English Plays&quot; (second series, 1887).

==Burial==
For centuries there was uncertainty about Nabbes&#x27; fate and burial. In a 1628 poem he expressed hope that one day he would be worthy of entombment at Worcester Cathedral in his native Worcestershire, while an 18th-century theatre historian insisted he was interred at London&#x27;s Temple Church. There were no records for him in either place. In the mid-1900s it was finally discovered that Nabbes was buried on 6 April 1641, in his parish churchyard of St. Giles in the Fields. His two young children, Bridget and William, joined him there over the next two years.

<doc id="297194" wikidata="Q434597" url="?curid=297194" title="Juan Ruiz">
<text>Juan Ruiz (), known as the [[Archpriest]] of [[Hita, Guadalajara|Hita]] (&quot;Arcipreste de Hita&quot;), was a medieval Castilian poet. He is best known for his ribald, earthy poem, &quot;El&quot; &quot;Libro de buen amor&quot; (&quot;The Book of Good Love&quot;).

==Biography==

=== Origins ===
He was born in Alcalá de Henares. Little is known about him today, save that he was a cleric and probably studied in Toledo. Though his birth name is known to be Juan Ruiz, he is widely referred to by his title of &quot;archpriest of Hita.&quot;

===Imprisonment===
According to his own book, he was imprisoned for years, thought to be between 1337 and 1350, as punishment for some of his deeds (if the poem is any guide, they were quite inconsistent with his position as priest). However, the poem has long been considered as pseudo-autobiography and the verses that mention his imprisonment appear at the end of the book and are generally thought to have been added after the fact. One of his poems states that he was imprisoned on the order of Gil Albornoz, the Archbishop of Toledo. It is not known whether he was sentenced for his irregularities of conduct, or on account of his satirical reflections on his ecclesiastical superiors. Nor is it possible to fix the precise date of his imprisonment. Albornoz nominally occupied the see of Toledo from 1337 to 1368, but he fell into disgrace in 1351 and fled to Avignon. A consideration of these circumstances points to the probable conclusion that Ruiz was in prison from 1337 to 1350, but this is conjecture. What seems established is that he finished the &quot;Libro de buen amor&quot; in 1343. Indeed, almost nothing is known about the author(s) of the poem or if he was even named Juan Ruiz. One scholarly study found hundreds of clerics in mid-fourteenth-century Castile named Juan Ruiz. The name appears to be the equivalent of John Smith and may have been chosen to represent the everyman.

===Death===
It has been estimated that he died around 1350 (presumably in prison); by 1351, he no longer held the title of archpriest of Hita.

==&quot;The Book of Good Love&quot;==
&quot;El Libro de Buen Amor&quot; (The Book of Good Love) is a massive and episodic work that combines poems to Jesus and Mary; Ruiz&#x27;s unrequited love, and fables. The poem itself is 1,728 stanzas long. The breadth of the writer&#x27;s scope, and the exuberance of his style have caused some to term him &quot;the Castilian Chaucer.&quot; Speculation regarding whether or not the book was actually an autobiography is incessant.

His language is characterized by its richness and its sermon-like tendency to repeat the same concept in several different ways. Noted for being very creative and alive, his work utilizes colloquial, popular vocabulary. His natural gifts were supplemented by his varied culture; he clearly had a considerable knowledge of the colloquial (and perhaps also of literary) Arabic widely spoken in the Spain of his time; his classical reading was apparently not extensive, but he knew by heart the &quot;Disticha&quot; of Dionysius Cato, and admits his indebtedness to Ovid and to the &quot;De Amore&quot; ascribed to Pamphilus; his references to Blanchefleur, to Tristan and to Yseult, indicate an acquaintance with French literature, and he utilizes the &quot;fabliaux&quot; with remarkable deftness; lastly, he adapts fables and apologues from Aesop, from Pedro Alfonso&#x27;s &quot;Disciplina clericalis&quot;, and from medieval bestiaries.

All these heterogeneous materials are fused in the substance of his versified autobiography, into which he intercalates devout songs, parodies of epic or forensic formulae, and lyrical digressions on every aspect of life. He shows a profound knowledge of human emotion and is able to strike a balance between gentleness and brazenness in his shrewd and frequently ironic writing. Ruiz, in
fact, offers a complete picture of picaresque society in the most complex and rich cultural geography of Europe during the first half of the 14th century, and his impartial irony lends a deeper tone to his rich coloring. He knows the weaknesses
of both clergy and laity, and he dwells with equal complacency on the amorous adventures of great ladies, on the perverse intrigues arranged by demure nuns behind their convent walls, and on the simpler instinctive animalism of country lasses and Moorish dancing-girls.

In addition to the faculty of genial observation Ruiz has the gift of creating characters and
presenting types of human nature: from his Don Furón is derived the hungry gentleman in &quot;Lazarillo de Tormes&quot;, in Don Melón and Doña Endrina he anticipates Calisto and Melibea in the
&quot;Celestina&quot;, and Celestina herself is developed from the Trotaconventos of Ruiz. Moreover, Ruiz was justly proud of his metrical innovations: the &quot;Libro de buen amor&quot; is mainly written in the &quot;cuaderna via&quot; modelled on the French alexandrine, but he imparts to the measure a variety and rapidity previously unknown in Castilian, and he experiments by introducing internal rhymes or by shortening the fourth line into an octosyllabic verse; or he boldly recasts the form of the stanza, extending it to six or seven lines with alternate verses of eight and five syllables. But his technical skill never sinks to triviality. All his writing bears the stamp of a unique personality, and, if he never attempts a sublime flight, he conveys with contagious force his enthusiasm for life under any conditions — in town, country, vagabondage
or gaol.

Johan Ruys (original spelling), arcipreste de la Hita, was imprisoned by the Inquisition for a few years due to his one-sided love affair with a lady of the nobility. In our modern society, he would have been charged with &quot;harassment&quot;. He is said to have died 7 or 8 years after his release from the Inquisition&#x27;s holding facility.

There are today three manuscripts of the &quot;Libro de Buen Amor&quot;. The Salamanca version, denoted S, resides in Madrid&#x27;s Biblioteca Real and is considered the best of the three codices. The other two are the Academia Española version, known as Gayoso (G), and the Toledo (T) manuscript.

==Legacy==
Ruiz&#x27;s influence is visible in &quot;El Corbacho&quot;, the work of another jovial goliard, Alphonso Martinez de Toledo, arch-priest of Talavera, who wrote more than half a century before the &quot;Libro&quot; &quot;de buen amor&quot; was imitated by the author of the &quot;Celestina&quot;. Ruiz is mentioned with respect by Santillana, and that his reputation extended beyond Spain is proved by the surviving fragments of a Portuguese version of the &quot;Libro de buen amor&quot;. By some strange accident he was neglected, and apparently forgotten, until 1790, when an expurgated edition of his poems was published by Tomás Antonio Sanchez; from that date his fame has steadily increased, and by the unanimous verdict of all competent judges he is now ranked as the greatest Castilian poet of his century.

Paul Heyse (18301914) published a translation into German of a poem by Ruiz in the 1852 collection &quot;Spanisches Liederbuch&quot; (Spanish Songbook), with the first line &quot;Nun bin ich dein, du aller Blumen Blume&quot;. The translation was set to music for voice and piano by Hugo Wolf (18601903), and published in his 1891 Lieder collection also called &quot;Spanisches Liederbuch&quot;.

<doc id="297196" wikidata="Q28428" url="?curid=297196" title="Baekje">
<text>Baekje or Paekche (; ) was a Korean kingdom located in southwestern Korea from 18 BCE to 660 CE. It was one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, together with Goguryeo and Silla. While the three kingdoms were in separate existence, Baekje had the highest population of approximately 3,800,000 people (760,000 households), which was much larger than that of Silla (850,000 people) and similar to that of Goguryeo (3,500,000 people).

Baekje was founded by Onjo, the third son of Goguryeo&#x27;s founder Jumong and Soseono, at Wiryeseong (present-day southern Seoul). Baekje, like Goguryeo, claimed to succeed Buyeo, a state established in present-day Manchuria around the time of Gojoseon&#x27;s fall.

Baekje alternately battled and allied with Goguryeo and Silla as the three kingdoms expanded control over the peninsula. At its peak in the 4th century, Baekje controlled most of the western Korean peninsula, as far north as Pyongyang, and may have even held territories in China, such as in Liaoxi, though this view is controversial. It became a significant regional sea power, with political and trade relations with China and Japan.

Baekje was a great maritime power; its nautical skill, which made it the Phoenicia of East Asia, was instrumental in the dissemination of Buddhism throughout East Asia and continental culture to Japan.

In 660, it was defeated by the Tang dynasty and Silla, and ultimately submitted to Unified Silla.

== Etymology ==
The most common name used by most historians is Baekje (), meaning &quot;hundred counties&quot;, but was originally founded by Onjo as 十濟, which figuratively means &quot;tens of counties&quot;. Only during the reign of Geunchogo (肖古王) was it renamed as Baekje. It is also attested as 居陀羅 Kudara, meaning &quot;great place&quot;, which could have been a possible endonym that was later on borrowed into Old Japanese.

==History==
===Founding===
Baekje was mainly composed of the native Han (Hanja: 韓人) and the Koreanic Yemaek (Hanja: 濊貊族) from Goguryeo and Buyeo. Those from the Lelang Commandery (Korean: Nakrang, Hanja: 樂浪) came in through trade and conquest, and a small number of Jin (Hanja: 辰人) were also admitted into the polities of Baekje.

According to the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, Baekje was founded in 18 BCE by King Onjo, who led a group of people from Goguryeo south to the Han River basin. Jumong had left his son Yuri in Buyeo when he left that kingdom to establish the new kingdom of Goguryeo. Jumong became Divine King Dongmyeong, and had two more sons with Soseono, Onjo and Biryu. When Yuri later arrived in Goguryeo, Jumong promptly made him the crown prince. Realizing Yuri would become the next king, Soseono left Goguryeo, taking her two sons Biryu and Onjo south to found their own kingdoms with their people, along with ten vassals. She is remembered as a key figure in the founding of both Goguryeo and Baekje.

Onjo settled in Wiryeseong (present-day Hanam), and called his country &quot;Sipje&quot; (십제, 十濟, meaning &quot;Ten Vassals&quot;), while Biryu settled in Michuhol (present-day Incheon), against the vassals&#x27; advice. The people of Wiryeseong lived prosperously, but the salty water and marshes in Michuhol made settlement difficult.

Biryu then went to his brother Onjo, asking for the throne of Sipje. When Onjo refused, Biryu declared war, but lost. In shame, Biryu committed suicide, and his people moved to Wiryeseong, where King Onjo welcomed them and renamed his country &quot;Baekje&quot; (&quot;Hundred Vassals&quot;).

King Onjo moved the capital from the south to the north of the Han river, and then south again, probably all within present Seoul, under pressure from other Mahan states. King Gaeru is believed to have moved the capital north of the river to Bukhansanseong in 132, probably in present-day Goyang to the northwest of Seoul.

Through the early centuries of the Common Era, sometimes called the Proto–Three Kingdoms period, early Baekje gradually gained control over the other Mahan tribes.

===Expansion===
The Baekje Kingdom, which initially belonged to the Mahan confederacy, first integrated the Han River (Korea) basin area, then overthrew Mokji state (), the dominant country, and then integrated Mahan as a territorial state.

During the reign of King Goi (234–286), Baekje became a full-fledged kingdom, as it continued consolidating the Mahan confederacy. In 249, according to the ancient Japanese text &quot;Nihonshoki&quot;, Baekje&#x27;s expansion reached the Gaya confederacy to its east, around the Nakdong River valley. Baekje is first described in Chinese records as a kingdom in 345. The first diplomatic missions from Baekje reached Japan around 367 (According to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;: 247).

King Geunchogo (346–375) expanded Baekje&#x27;s territory to the north through war against Goguryeo, while annexing the remaining Mahan societies in the south. During Geunchogo&#x27;s reign, the territories of Baekje included most of the western Korean Peninsula (except the two Pyeongan provinces), and in 371, Baekje defeated Goguryeo at Pyongyang. Baekje continued substantial trade with Goguryeo, and actively adopted Chinese culture and technology. Buddhism became the official state religion in 384.

Baekje also became a sea power and continued mutual goodwill relationships with the Japanese rulers of the Kofun period, transmitting continental cultural influences to Japan. The Chinese writing system, Buddhism, advanced pottery, ceremonial burial, and other aspects of culture were introduced by aristocrats, artisans, scholars, and monks throughout their relationship.

During this period, the Han River basin remained the heartland of the country.

===Ungjin period===
In the 5th century, Baekje retreated under the southward military threat of Goguryeo, and in 475, the Seoul region fell to Goguryeo. Baekje&#x27;s capital was located at Ungjin (present-day Gongju) from 475 to 538.

Isolated in mountainous terrain, the new capital was secure against the north but also disconnected from the outside world. It was closer to Silla than Wiryeseong had been, however, and a military alliance was forged between Silla and Baekje against Goguryeo.

Most maps of the Three Kingdoms period show Baekje occupying the Chungcheong and Jeolla provinces, the core of the country in the Ungjin and Sabi periods.

===Sabi period===

In 538, King Seong moved the capital to Sabi (present-day Buyeo County), and rebuilt his kingdom into a strong state. Temporarily, he changed the official name of the country as the Nambuyeo (; ; lit. &quot;Southern Buyeo&quot;), a reference to Buyeo to which Baekje traced its origins. The Sabi period witnessed the flowering of Baekje culture, alongside the growth of Buddhism.

Under pressure from Goguryeo to the north and Silla to the east, Seong sought to strengthen Baekje&#x27;s relationship with China. The location of Sabi, on the navigable Geum River, made contact with China much easier, and both trade and diplomacy flourished during his reign and continuing on into the 7th century.

In the 7th century, with the growing influence of Silla in the southern and central Korean peninsula, Baekje began its decline.

===Fall and restoration movement===
In 660, the coalition troops of Silla and Tang China attacked Baekje, which was then allied with Goguryeo. A heavily outmanned army led by General Gyebaek was defeated in the Battle of Hwangsanbeol near Nonsan. The capital Sabi fell almost immediately thereafter, resulting in the annexation of Baekje by Tang China. Tang government set up Ungjin Commandery for the purpose of governing the Baekje area. King Uija and his son Buyeo Yung were sent into exile in China while at least some of the ruling class fled to Japan. The fall of Sabi resulted in one of the infamous episodes in Korean history, as countless Baekje court ladies, concubines and women of the nobility committed suicide by jumping off a cliff near Sabi rather than be captured by the Silla-Tang Alliance. To memoralize this tragic event in history, a pavilion stands at the so-called &quot;Rock of the Falling Flowers&quot; commemorating Baekje&#x27;s defeat and the suicide of the kingdom&#x27;s court ladies and concubines who jumped off the cliff.

Baekje forces attempted a brief restoration movement but faced Silla–Tang joint forces. A Buddhist monk Dochim () and the former Baekje general Buyeo Boksin rose to try to revive Baekje. They welcomed the Baekje prince Buyeo Pung back from Japan to serve as king, with Juryu (주류, 周留, in modern Seocheon County, South Chungcheong) as their headquarters. They put the Tang general Liu Renyuan (劉仁願) under siege in Sabi. Emperor Gaozong sent the general Liu Rengui, who had previously been demoted to commoner rank for offending Li Yifu, with a relief force, and Liu Rengui and Liu Renyuan were able to fight off the Baekje resistance forces&#x27; attacks, but were themselves not strong enough to quell the rebellion, and so for some time the armies were in stalemate.

Baekje requested Japanese aid, and King Pung returned to Baekje with a contingent of 10,000 soldiers. Before the ships from Japan arrived, his forces battled a contingent of Tang forces in Ungjin County.

In 663, Baekje revival forces and a Japanese naval fleet convened in southern Baekje to confront the Silla forces in the Battle of Baekgang. The Tang dynasty also sent 7,000 soldiers and 170 ships. After five naval confrontations, all of which the Silla-Tang joint fleet won, that took place in August 663 at Baekgang, considered the lower reaches of Geum River or Dongjin river, the Silla–Tang forces emerged victorious, and Buyeo Pung escaped to Goguryeo.

==Social and political structure==
The establishment of a centralized state in Baekje is usually traced to the reign of King Goi, who may have first established patrilineal succession. Like most monarchies, a great deal of power was held by the aristocracy. King Seong, for example, strengthened royal power, but after he was slain in a disastrous campaign against Silla, the nobles took much of that power away from his son.

The ruler titles of Baekje were *eraγa (於羅瑕), mostly used by the nobility, and *k(j)ə-n kici (鞬吉支), as he would be called by the commoners. The queen consort was called *oluk (於陸) and pasɨkasɨ (벗〯갓) meaning &quot;woman companion&quot;.

The Hae clan and the Jin clan were the representative royal houses who had considerable power from the early period of Baekje, and they produced many queens over several generations. The Hae clan was probably the royal house before the Buyeo clan replaced them, and both clans appear descended from the lineage of Buyeo and Goguryeo. The &quot;Great Eight Families&quot; (Sa, Yeon, Hyeop, Hae, Jin, Guk, Mok, and Baek) were powerful nobles in the Sabi era, recorded in Chinese records such as Tongdian.

Central government officials were divided into sixteen ranks, the six members of the top rank forming a type of cabinet, with the top official being elected every three years. In the &quot;Sol&quot; rank, the first (&quot;Jwapyeong&quot;) through the sixth (&quot;Naesol&quot;) officials were political, administrative, and military commanders. In the &quot;Deok&quot; rank, the seventh (&quot;Jangdeok&quot;) through the eleventh (&quot;Daedeok&quot;) officials may have headed each field. &quot;Mundok&quot;, &quot;Mudok&quot;, &quot;Jwagun&quot;, &quot;Jinmu&quot; and &quot;Geuku&quot; from the twelfth to the sixteenth, may have been military administrators.

According to the &quot;Samguk Yusa&quot;, during the Sabi period, the chief minister (&quot;Jaesang&quot;) of Baekje was chosen by a unique system. The names of several candidates were placed under a rock (Cheonjeongdae) near Hoamsa temple. After a few days, the rock was moved and the candidate whose name had a certain mark was chosen as the new chief minister. Whether this was a form of selection by lot or a covert selection by the elite is not clear. This council was called the &quot;Jeongsaamhoeui&quot; (政事巖會議, The council of rocks with state affairs).

==Military==
The town leaders and its subjects participated in the military of Baekje on a local level, and loot and captives were distributed among them. The subjects usually worked in the supply division. The position of Jwajang led the military. Geunchogo established the division of central military and local militaries. The people of Baekje usually served in the military for three years. As Baekje entered the Sabi period, the military was divided into the royal private guard, the capital central military and the local military. The royal private guard handled matters such as protecting the palace. The weapons available to the soldiers were diverse.

==Archaeology==
The first ever bone remains of Baekje people were found in the eungpyeongri tombs in buyeo, which made possible reconstructions of appearances of Baekje people possible, and the tombs seem to have no sign of being looted.

==Language and culture==

Baekje was established by immigrants from Goguryeo who spoke what could be a Buyeo language, a hypothetical group linking the languages of Gojoseon, Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Baekje. In a case of diglossia, the indigenous Samhan people, having migrated in an earlier wave from the same region, probably spoke a variety of the same language. Kōno Rokurō has argued that the kingdom of Baekje was bilingual, with the gentry speaking a Puyŏ language and the common people a Han language. A view was proposed by Alexander Vovin, who noted that Japonic languages were spoken in the Tamna Kingdom on modern-day Jeju before the arrival of Koreanic, noting the presence of a Japonic substratum in the Jeju language.

Wooden tablets dated to the late Baekje era have been discovered by archaeologists, and some of them involve the rearrangement of Classical Chinese words according to native syntax. From this data, the word order of Baekje appears to have been similar to that of Old Korean. However, no uncontroversial evidence of non-Chinese grammatical morphemes has been found. Compared to Silla tablets, Baekje tablets are far more likely to employ conventional Classical Chinese syntax and vocabulary without any native influence. 
Buddhism, a religion originating in what is now India, was transmitted to Korea via China in the late 4th century. The Samguk yusa records the following 3 monks among first to bring the Buddhist teaching, or Dharma, to Korea: Malananta (late 4th century) – an Indian Buddhist monk who brought Buddhism to Baekje in the southern Korea, Sundo – a Chinese Buddhist monk who brought Buddhism to Goguryeo in northern Korea and Ado monk who brought Buddhism to Silla in central Korea.

Baekje artists adopted many Chinese influences and synthesized them into a unique artistic tradition. Buddhist themes are extremely strong in Baekje artwork. The beatific Baekje smile found on many Buddhist sculptures expresses the warmth typical of Baekje art. Taoist influences are also widespread. Chinese artisans were sent to the kingdom by the Liang dynasty in 541, and this may have given rise to an increased Chinese influence in the Sabi period.

The tomb of King Muryeong (501–523), although modeled on Chinese brick tombs and yielding some imported Chinese objects, also contained many funerary objects of the Baekje tradition, such as the gold crown ornaments, gold belts, and gold earrings. Mortuary practices also followed the unique tradition of Baekje. This tomb is seen as a representative tomb of the Ungjin period.

Delicate lotus designs of the roof-tiles, intricate brick patterns, curves of the pottery style, and flowing and elegant epitaph writing characterize Baekje culture. The Buddhist sculptures and refined pagodas reflect religion-inspired creativity. A splendid gilt-bronze incense burner ( &quot;Baekje Geumdong Daehyeongno&quot;) excavated from an ancient Buddhist temple site at Neungsan-ri, Buyeo County, exemplifies Baekje art.

Little is known of Baekje music, but local musicians were sent with tribute missions to China in the 7th century, indicating that a distinctive musical tradition had developed by that time.
==Foreign relations==
===Relations with China===

In 372, King Geunchogo paid tribute to the Jin dynasty of China, located in the basin of the Yangtze River. After the fall of Jin and the establishment of Song dynasty in 420, Baekje sent envoys seeking cultural goods and technologies.

Baekje sent an envoy to Northern Wei of Northern Dynasties for the first time in 472, and King Gaero asked for military aid to attack Goguryeo. Kings Muryeong and Seong sent envoys to Liang several times and received titles of nobility.

Tomb of King Muryeong is built with bricks according with Liang&#x27;s tomb style.

===Relations with Japan===
====Cultural impact and military assistance====

To confront the military pressure of Goguryeo to its north and Silla to its east, Baekje (&quot;Kudara&quot; in Japanese) established close relations with Japan. According to the Korean chronicle &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, Baekje and Silla sent some princes to the Japanese court as hostages. Whether the princes sent to Japan should be interpreted as diplomats as part of an embassy or literal hostages is debated. Due to the confusion on the exact nature of this relationship (the question of whether the Baekje Koreans were family or at least close to the Japanese Imperial line or whether they were hostages) and the fact that the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, a primary source of material for this relationship, is a compilation of myth, makes it difficult to evaluate. The &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, which also documents this, can also be interpreted in various ways and at any rate it was rewritten in the 13th century, easily seven or eight centuries after these particular events took place. Adding to the confusion is the discovery (in Japan) that the &quot;Inariyama sword, as well as some other swords discovered in Japan, utilized the Korean &#x27;Idu&#x27; system of writing&quot;. The swords &quot;originated in Paekche and that the kings named in their inscriptions represent Paekche kings rather than Japanese kings&quot;. The techniques for making these swords were the apparently similar to styles from Korea, specifically from Baekje. In Japan, the hostage interpretation is dominant.

Other historians, such as those who collaborated on &#x27;Paekche of Korea and the Origin of Yamato Japan&#x27; and Jonathan W. Best, who helped translate what was left of the Baekje annals, have noted that these princes set up schools in Yamato Japan and took control of the Japanese naval forces during the war with Goguryeo, taking this as evidence of them being more along the lines of diplomats with some kind of familial tie to the Japanese imperial family and as evidence against any hostage status.

As is with many long-past histories and competing records, very little can be definitively concluded. Further research has been difficult, in part due to the 1976 restriction on the study of royal tombs in Japan (to include tombs such as the Gosashi tomb, which is allegedly the resting place of Empress Jingū). Prior to 1976, foreign researchers did have access, and some found Korean artifacts in Japanese dig sites. Recently in 2008, Japan has allowed controlled limited access to foreign archaeologists, but the international community still has many unanswered questions. National Geographic has written that Japan &quot;&quot;the agency has kept access to the tombs restricted, prompting rumors that officials fear excavation would reveal bloodline links between the &quot;pure&quot; imperial family and Koreaor that some tombs hold no royal remains at all.&quot;&quot;
In any case, these Koreans, diplomats and royal relatives or not, brought to Japan knowledge of the Chinese writing system, Buddhism, iron processing for weapons, and various other technologies. In exchange, Japan provided military support.

According to mythical accounts in the controversial &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Empress Jingū extracted tribute and pledges of allegiance from the kings of Baekje, Silla, and Goguryeo. At the height of Japanese nationalism in the early 20th century, Japanese historians used these mythical accounts along with a passage in the Gwanggaeto Stele to establish ideological rationale to the imperialist outcry for invasion of Korea. Other historians have pointed out that there is no evidence of this Japanese account in any part of Korea, in addition to not being in any viable text in China or Korea. Regarding the Gwanggaeto Stele, because the lack of syntax and punctuation the text can be interpreted 4 different ways. Due to this problem in interpretation, nothing can be concluded. Also complicating the matter is that in the Nihongi a Korean named Amenohiboko is described in &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; as a maternal predecessor of , This is highly inconsistent and difficult to interpret correctly.

Scholars believe that the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; gives the invasion date of Silla and Baekje as the late 4th century. However, by this time, Japan was a confederation of local tribes without sophisticated iron weapons, while the Three Kingdoms of Korea were fully developed centralized powers with modern iron weapons and were already utilizing horses for warfare. It is very unlikely that a developing state such as Yamato had the capacity to cross the sea and engage in battles with Baekje and Silla. The &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; is widely regarded to be an unreliable and biased source of information on early relations with Korea, as it mixes heavy amounts of supposition and legend with facts.

Some Japanese scholars interpret the Gwanggaeto Stele, erected in 414 by King Jangsu of Goguryeo, as describing a Japanese invasion in the southern portion of the Korean peninsula. However, Mohan claims that Goguryeo fabricated the Japanese invasion in order to justify its conquest of Baekje. If this stele was a dedication to a Korean king, it can be argued that it would logically highlight Korea&#x27;s conquests and not dedicate it to a strange incident regarding Japan. In any case, because of these various possible interpretations, the circumstances surrounding the stele are still highly debated and inconclusive.

Chinese scholars participated in the study of the Stele during the 1980s. Wang Jianqun interviewed local farmers and decided that no intentional fabrication occurred, adding that the lime on the Stele was pasted by local copy-making workers to enhance readability. Xu Jianxin of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences discovered the earliest rubbed copy which was made before 1881. He also concluded that there was no evidence the Japanese had intentionally damaged any of the characters on the Stele.

Today, most Chinese and Japanese scholars contradict the conspiracy theories, based on the study of the Stele itself and advocate Japanese intervention in the era, although its size and effect are disputed.

In the project of writing a common history textbook, Kim Tae-sik of Hongik University (Korea) denied Japan&#x27;s theory. But, Kōsaku Hamada of Kyushu University (Japan) reported their interpretations of the Gwanggaeto Stele text, neither of them adopting the intentionally damaged stele theory in their interpretations.

====The fall of Baekje and military support from Japan====

Some members of the Baekje nobility and royalty emigrated to Japan even before the kingdom was overthrown. In response to Baekje&#x27;s request, Japan in 663 sent the general Abe no Hirafu with 20,000 troops and 1,000 ships to revive Baekje with Buyeo Pung (known in Japanese as Hōshō), a son of Uija of Baekje who had been an emissary to Japan. Around August 661, 10,000 soldiers and 170 ships, led by Abe no Hirafu, arrived. Additional Japanese reinforcement, including 27,000 soldiers led by Kamitsukeno no Kimi Wakako (上毛野君稚子) and 10,000 soldiers led by Iohara no Kimi (廬原君) also arrived at Baekje in 662.

This attempt, however, failed at the Battle of Baekgang, and the prince escaped to Goguryeo. According to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, 400 Japanese ships were lost in the battles. Only half of the troops were able to return to Japan.

The Japanese army retreated to Japan with several thousand Baekje refugees. The former royal family members were initially treated as &quot;foreign guests&quot; (蕃客) and were not incorporated into the political system of Japan for some time. Buyeo Pung&#x27;s younger brother Seon&#x27;gwang (Zenkō in Japanese) ( or ) used the family name &quot;Kudara no Konikishi&quot; (&quot;King of Baekje&quot;) () (they are also called the Kudara clan, as Baekje was called Kudara in Japanese).

==Legacy==
Baekje was briefly revived in the Later Three Kingdoms of Korea period, as Unified Silla collapsed. In 892, General Kyŏn Hwŏn established Later Baekje, based in Wansan (present-day Jeonju). Later Baekje was overthrown in 936 by King Taejo of Goryeo.

In contemporary South Korea, Baekje relics are often symbolic of the local cultures of the southwest, especially in Chungnam and Jeolla. The gilt-bronze incense burner, for example, is a key symbol of Buyeo County, and the Baekje-era Buddhist rock sculpture of Seosan Maaesamjonbulsang is an important symbol of Seosan City.

Baekje is believed to have introduced the &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot; writing system to Japan, of which the modern hiragana and katakana scripts are descendants. &quot;Kojiki&quot; and the &quot;Nihon shoki&quot; both state this, and though direct evidence is hard to come by, most scholars tend to accept this idea.

On 17 April 2009, Ōuchi Kimio (大內公夫) of Ōuchi clan visited Iksan, Korea to pay tribute to his Baekje ancestors. The Ōuchi are descendants of Prince Imseong.

In 2010, Baekje Cultural Land was opened to visitors. The theme park aims to preserve Baekje architecture and culture.

Baekje Historic Areas, which feature locations with remains of the period, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2015.

<text>Meyer Guggenheim ( ; ; February 1, 1828 – March 15, 1905) was the patriarch of what became known as the Guggenheim family in the United States, which became one of the world&#x27;s wealthiest families during the 19th century, and remained so during the 20th.

== Early life ==
Guggenheim was born in Lengnau, Aargau, Switzerland, on February 1, 1828. He was the son of Simon Meyer Guggenheim and Schafeli (née Levinger) Guggenheim and was of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.

== Career ==
After emigrating from Switzerland in 1847 to the United States, he launched a new life in the importing business. He ultimately made his fortune (one of the largest of the 19th century) through business ventures in mining and smelting, mostly in the United States.

After investing in silver mines in the Leadville mining district of Colorado, he expanded into ore smelting in Colorado. He built a number of smelters across the United States and in northern Mexico. As his several sons grew up, they assumed leading roles in the family mining and smelting business.

== Personal life ==
Guggenheim met Barbara Weil (1834–1900), the daughter of his new stepmother, and married her four years later around 1852. Together, they were the parents of ten surviving children.

Five of their seven sons were active in the family businesses, including:

* Isaac Guggenheim (1854–1922), who married Carrie Sonneborn in 1876.
* Daniel Guggenheim (1856–1930), head of the family after his father&#x27;s death, who was the most active of his sons in developing and acquiring worldwide mining interests.
* Maurice Guggenheim (1858–1939), originally in the lace and embroidery import business; by 1881, he was a financier involved in mining and smelting.
* Solomon Robert Guggenheim (1861–1949), a supporter of modern art through his foundation and donations to the Museum of Modern Art.
* Jeanette Guggenheim (1863–1889), married Albert Gerstle and died in childbirth.
* Benjamin Guggenheim (1865–1912), who died in the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster. He married Florette Seligman.
* John Simon Guggenheim (1867–1941), a one-term senator from Colorado.
* William Guggenheim (1868–1941)
* Rose Guggenheim (1871–1945), who married three times; first to Albert Loeb (head of the New York Stock Exchange), second to Samuel M. Goldsmith in 1908, and third to Charles E. Quicke.
* Cora Gwendalyn Guggenheim (1873–1956), who married to Louis Frank Rothschild, founder of L.F. Rothschild.

After his wife&#x27;s death in 1900, Guggenheim and his sons provided $200,000 to Mount Sinai Hospital for the construction of a hospital in her honor. Guggenheim died on March 15, 1905, in Palm Beach, Florida. He was interred at the Salem Fields Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

=== Descendants ===
Through his son Benjamin, Guggenheim was a grandfather of art collector and socialite Peggy Guggenheim.

<text>Richard Knolles (c. 1545 – July 1610) was an English historian and translator, known for his historical account of the Ottoman Empire, the first major description in the English language.

==Life==
A native of Northamptonshire, Knolles was born in the 1540s, probably at Cold Ashby. He was educated at Lincoln College, Oxford, where he graduated with a BA in January 1565. Knolles then became a fellow at Lincoln College, and obtained his MA there in July 1570. Some time after 1571, he left Oxford to become headmaster at a grammar school in Sandwich, Kent, which was founded by Sir Roger Manwood in about 1563.

After Manwood&#x27;s death in 1592, his son, Sir Peter became Knolles&#x27; professional and literary patron and encouraged him to write.

Knolles died in Sandwich in July 1610, and was buried in St Mary&#x27;s church.

==Works==
In 1603, Knolles published his &quot;Generall Historie of the Turkes&quot;, of which several editions subsequently appeared, among them Sir Paul Rycaut&#x27;s edition (1700). Rycaut&#x27;s edition includes his account of his time in Constantinople as secretary to the English ambassador. While the topic of the Turks was very popular during the period in which Knolles wrote, with an estimated 1,000 works about the Turks published in Europe between 1501 and 1550, Knolles&#x27; history was the first chronicle of the military and political aspects of the Ottoman Empire to be written in English. Previous histories had been available only in Latin and were thus not widely circulated.

Knolles also published a composite translation of Jean Bodin&#x27;s &quot;Les Six livres de la République&quot; in 1606, under the title &quot;The Six Bookes of a Commonweale&quot;. It is based on both the French and Latin versions of Bodin&#x27;s text and was dedicated to Sir Peter Manwood.

He completed a translation from the Latin of William Camden&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot;, which was said to be &quot;much estemed&quot; by Camden, but was never published. The manuscript survives in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.

==Reputation==
Knolles&#x27; work had considerable merits of style and of arrangement. Samuel Johnson praised him as the best of English historians, saying that &quot;in his history of the Turks [Knolles] has displayed all the excellencies that narration can admit.&quot; Johnson explained Knolles&#x27; limited reputation by pointing out that his history recounted &quot;enterprizes and revolutions, of which none desire to be informed&quot;.

<text>The Hotter&#x27;N Hell Hundred is an annual bicycle race in Wichita Falls, Texas. It is held each year on the 4th or 5th Saturday in August (always nine days before Labor Day) and includes professional as well as amateur riders. The professional racers ride a 100-mile road race, as well as time trials and criterium. For the amateur riders, there are road routes of 100 mi, 100 km, 50 mi, 25 mi, and 10 km. The amateur routes are also open for inline skating. Approximately 10,000 to 14,000 riders participate each year, making the Hotter&#x27;N Hell Hundred the largest sanctioned century bicycle ride in the U.S. 2009&#x27;s Hotter&#x27;N Hell had over 14,000 riders.

The race was first held in 1982 as part of the Wichita Falls Celebration. The name is thus a rare example of a triple entendre: one hundred miles (i.e., century) in one hundred degree Fahrenheit weather (the race is held in August, where temperatures in Wichita Falls frequently reach and exceed this level by noon), initially conducted to celebrate the city&#x27;s 100th anniversary.

The race begins at 7:05 am. Participants in the 100 mile route must reach &quot;Hell&#x27;s Gate&quot; at the 60 mile mark no later than 12:30 pm or else cannot qualify to finish the 100 mile segment, instead doing a shorter route. Averaging 20 miles an hour it is possible to complete the ride in five hours or less for well-prepared athletes, however most complete in six to nine hours.

Additional events are held throughout the weekend including mountain bike races.

<text>Jean-Jacques Boissard (1528 – 30 October 1602) was an antiquary and Neo-Latin poet.
==Life==
He was born at Besançon and educated at Leuven; but he secretly left the seminary there, and travelled through (Germany) to Italy, where he remained several years and was often reduced to poverty. His time in Italy gave him a taste for antiquities, and he formed a collection of artefacts from Rome and its vicinity. He then visited the islands of Greece, but illness obliged him to return to Rome. Here he completed his collection, and returned to France; but not being permitted to profess publicly the Protestant religion, which he had embraced some time before, he withdrew to Metz, where he remained until his death.

==Works==
He provided text and drawings for books by Robert Boissard, Theodor de Bry, Jacques Granthomme and Alexandre Vallée. Major works are:
*&quot;Poemata&quot; (1574)
*&quot;Emblemata&quot; (1584)
*&quot;Icones Virorum Illustrium&quot; (1597)
*&quot;Vitae et Icones Sultanorum Turcicorum, etc.&quot; (1597)

<doc id="297203" wikidata="Q181485" url="?curid=297203" title="Blast furnace">
<text>A blast furnace is a type of metallurgical furnace used for smelting to produce industrial metals, generally pig iron, but also others such as lead or copper. &quot;Blast&quot; refers to the combustion air being supplied above atmospheric pressure.

In a blast furnace, fuel (coke), ores, and flux (limestone) are continuously supplied through the top of the furnace, while a hot blast of air (sometimes with oxygen enrichment) is blown into the lower section of the furnace through a series of pipes called tuyeres, so that the chemical reactions take place throughout the furnace as the material falls downward. The end products are usually molten metal and slag phases tapped from the bottom, and waste gases (flue gas) exiting from the top of the furnace. The downward flow of the ore along with the flux in contact with an upflow of hot, carbon monoxide-rich combustion gases is a countercurrent exchange and chemical reaction process.

In contrast, air furnaces (such as reverberatory furnaces) are naturally aspirated, usually by the convection of hot gases in a chimney flue. According to this broad definition, bloomeries for iron, blowing houses for tin, and smelt mills for lead would be classified as blast furnaces. However, the term has usually been limited to those used for smelting iron ore to produce pig iron, an intermediate material used in the production of commercial iron and steel, and the shaft furnaces used in combination with sinter plants in base metals smelting.

Blast furnaces are estimated to have been responsible for over 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions between 1900 and 2015, and are difficult to decarbonize.

==Process engineering and chemistry==

Blast furnaces operate on the principle of chemical reduction whereby carbon monoxide converts iron oxides to elemental iron. 

Blast furnaces differ from bloomeries and reverberatory furnaces in that in a blast furnace, flue gas is in direct contact with the ore and iron, allowing carbon monoxide to diffuse into the ore and reduce the iron oxide. The blast furnace operates as a countercurrent exchange process whereas a bloomery does not. Another difference is that bloomeries operate as a batch process whereas blast furnaces operate continuously for long periods. Continuous operation is also preferred because blast furnaces are difficult to start and stop. Also, the carbon in pig iron lowers the melting point below that of steel or pure iron; in contrast, iron does not melt in a bloomery.

Silica has to be removed from the pig iron. It reacts with calcium oxide (burned limestone) and forms silicates, which float to the surface of the molten pig iron as slag. Historically, to prevent contamination from sulfur, the best quality iron was produced with charcoal.

In a blast furnace, a downward-moving column of ore, flux, coke (or charcoal) and their reaction products must be sufficiently porous for the flue gas to pass through, upwards. To ensure this permeability the particle size of the coke or charcoal is of great relevance. Therefore, the coke must be strong enough so it will not be crushed by the weight of the material above it. Besides the physical strength of its particles, the coke must also be low in sulfur, phosphorus, and ash.

The main chemical reaction producing the molten iron is:
:Fe2O3 + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO2

This reaction might be divided into multiple steps, with the first being that preheated air blown into the furnace reacts with the carbon in the form of coke to produce carbon monoxide and heat:

:2 C(s) + O2(g) → 2 CO(g)

Hot carbon monoxide is the reducing agent for the iron ore and reacts with the iron oxide to produce molten iron and carbon dioxide. Depending on the temperature in the different parts of the furnace (warmest at the bottom) the iron is reduced in several steps. At the top, where the temperature usually is in the range between 200 °C and 700 °C, the iron oxide is partially reduced to iron(II,III) oxide, Fe3O4.

:3 Fe2O3(s) + CO(g) → 2 Fe3O4(s) + CO2(g)

The temperatures 850 °C, further down in the furnace, the iron(II,III) is reduced further to iron(II) oxide:

:Fe3O4(s) + CO(g) → 3 FeO(s) + CO2(g)

Hot carbon dioxide, unreacted carbon monoxide, and nitrogen from the air pass up through the furnace as fresh feed material travels down into the reaction zone. As the material travels downward, the counter-current gases both preheat the feed charge and decompose the limestone to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide:

:CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g)

The calcium oxide formed by decomposition reacts with various acidic impurities in the iron (notably silica), to form a fayalitic slag which is essentially calcium silicate, :
:SiO2 + CaO → CaSiO3

As the iron(II) oxide moves down to the area with higher temperatures, ranging up to 1200 °C degrees, it is reduced further to iron metal:

:FeO(s) + CO(g) → Fe(s) + CO2(g)

The carbon dioxide formed in this process is re-reduced to carbon monoxide by the coke:

:C(s) + CO2(g) → 2 CO(g)

The temperature-dependent equilibrium controlling the gas atmosphere in the furnace is called the Boudouard reaction:

::2CO CO2 + C

The pig iron produced by the blast furnace has a relatively high carbon content of around 4–5% and usually contains too much sulphur, making it very brittle, and of limited immediate commercial use. Some pig iron is used to make cast iron. The majority of pig iron produced by blast furnaces undergoes further processing to reduce the carbon and sulphur content and produce various grades of steel used for construction materials, automobiles, ships and machinery. Desulphurisation usually takes place during the transport of the liquid steel to the steelworks. This is done by adding &quot;calcium oxide&quot;, which reacts with the iron sulfide contained in the pig iron to form calcium sulfide (called &quot;lime desulfurization&quot;). In a further process step, the so-called basic oxygen steelmaking, the carbon is oxidized by blowing oxygen onto the liquid pig iron to form &quot;crude steel&quot;.

==History==

Cast iron has been found in China dating to the 5th century BC, but the earliest extant blast furnaces in China date to the 1st century AD and in the West from the High Middle Ages. They spread from the region around Namur in Wallonia (Belgium) in the late 15th century, being introduced to England in 1491. The fuel used in these was invariably charcoal. The successful substitution of coke for charcoal is widely attributed to British inventor Abraham Darby in 1709. The efficiency of the process was further enhanced by the practice of preheating the combustion air (hot blast), patented by British inventor James Beaumont Neilson in 1828.

=== China ===

Archaeological evidence shows that bloomeries appeared in China around 800 BC. Originally it was thought that the Chinese started casting iron right from the beginning, but this theory has since been debunked by the discovery of &#x27;more than ten&#x27; iron digging implements found in the tomb of Duke Jing of Qin (d. 537 BC), whose tomb is located in Fengxiang County, Shaanxi (a museum exists on the site today). There is however no evidence of the bloomery in China after the appearance of the blast furnace and cast iron. In China, blast furnaces produced cast iron, which was then either converted into finished implements in a cupola furnace, or turned into wrought iron in a fining hearth.

Although cast iron farm tools and weapons were widespread in China by the 5th century BC, employing workforces of over 200 men in iron smelters from the 3rd century onward, the earliest blast furnaces constructed were attributed to the Han dynasty in the 1st century AD. These early furnaces had clay walls and used phosphorus-containing minerals as a flux. Chinese blast furnaces ranged from around two to ten meters in height, depending on the region. The largest ones were found in modern Sichuan and Guangdong, while the &#x27;dwarf&quot; blast furnaces were found in Dabieshan. In construction, they are both around the same level of technological sophistication.

The effectiveness of the Chinese human and horse powered blast furnaces was enhanced during this period by the engineer Du Shi (c. AD 31), who applied the power of waterwheels to piston-bellows in forging cast iron. Early water-driven reciprocators for operating blast furnaces were built according to the structure of horse powered reciprocators that already existed. That is, the circular motion of the wheel, be it horse driven or water driven, was transferred by the combination of a belt drive, a crank-and-connecting-rod, other connecting rods, and various shafts, into the reciprocal motion necessary to operate a push bellow. Donald Wagner suggests that early blast furnace and cast iron production evolved from furnaces used to melt bronze. Certainly, though, iron was essential to military success by the time the State of Qin had unified China (221 BC). Usage of the blast and cupola furnace remained widespread during the Song and Tang dynasties. By the 11th century, the Song dynasty Chinese iron industry made a switch of resources from charcoal to coke in casting iron and steel, sparing thousands of acres of woodland from felling. This may have happened as early as the 4th century AD.

The primary advantage of the early blast furnace was in large scale production and making iron implements more readily available to peasants. Cast iron is more brittle than wrought iron or steel, which required additional fining and then cementation or co-fusion to produce, but for menial activities such as farming it sufficed. By using the blast furnace, it was possible to produce larger quantities of tools such as ploughshares more efficiently than the bloomery. In areas where quality was important, such as warfare, wrought iron and steel were preferred. Nearly all Han period weapons are made of wrought iron or steel, with the exception of axe-heads, of which many are made of cast iron.

Blast furnaces were also later used to produce gunpowder weapons such as cast iron bomb shells and cast iron cannons during the Song dynasty.

=== Medieval Europe ===
The simplest forge, known as the Corsican, was used prior to the advent of Christianity. Examples of improved bloomeries are the Stuckofen, sometimes called wolf-furnace, which remained until the beginning of the 19th century. Instead of using natural draught, air was pumped in by a &quot;trompe&quot;, resulting in better quality iron and an increased capacity. This pumping of air in with bellows is known as &quot;cold blast&quot;, and it increases the fuel efficiency of the bloomery and improves yield. They can also be built bigger than natural draught bloomeries.

====Oldest European blast furnaces====
The oldest known blast furnaces in the West were built in Durstel in Switzerland, the Märkische Sauerland in Germany, and at Lapphyttan in Sweden, where the complex was active between 1205 and 1300. At Noraskog in the Swedish parish of Järnboås, traces of even earlier blast furnaces have been found, possibly from around 1100. These early blast furnaces, like the Chinese examples, were very inefficient compared to those used today. The iron from the Lapphyttan complex was used to produce balls of wrought iron known as osmonds, and these were traded internationally – a possible reference occurs in a treaty with Novgorod from 1203 and several certain references in accounts of English customs from the 1250s and 1320s. Other furnaces of the 13th to 15th centuries have been identified in Westphalia.

The technology required for blast furnaces may have either been transferred from China, or may have been an indigenous innovation. Al-Qazvini in the 13th century and other travellers subsequently noted an iron industry in the Alburz Mountains to the south of the Caspian Sea. This is close to the silk route, so that the use of technology derived from China is conceivable. Much later descriptions record blast furnaces about three metres high. As the Varangian Rus&#x27; people from Scandinavia traded with the Caspian (using their Volga trade route), it is possible that the technology reached Sweden by this means. The Vikings are known to have used double bellows, which greatly increases the volumetric flow of the blast.

The Caspian region may also have been the source for the design of the furnace at Ferriere, described by Filarete, involving a water-powered bellows at Semogo in Valdidentro in northern Italy in 1226. In a two-stage process the molten iron was tapped twice a day into water, thereby granulating it.

====Cistercian contributions====
The General Chapter of the Cistercian monks spread some technological advances across Europe. This may have included the blast furnace, as the Cistercians are known to have been skilled metallurgists. According to Jean Gimpel, their high level of industrial technology facilitated the diffusion of new techniques: &quot;Every monastery had a model factory, often as large as the church and only several feet away, and waterpower drove the machinery of the various industries located on its floor.&quot; Iron ore deposits were often donated to the monks along with forges to extract the iron, and after a time surpluses were offered for sale. The Cistercians became the leading iron producers in Champagne, France, from the mid-13th century to the 17th century, also using the phosphate-rich slag from their furnaces as an agricultural fertilizer.

Archaeologists are still discovering the extent of Cistercian technology. At Laskill, an outstation of Rievaulx Abbey and the only medieval blast furnace so far identified in Britain, the slag produced was low in iron content. Slag from other furnaces of the time contained a substantial concentration of iron, whereas Laskill is believed to have produced cast iron quite efficiently. Its date is not yet clear, but it probably did not survive until Henry VIII&#x27;s Dissolution of the Monasteries in the late 1530s, as an agreement (immediately after that) concerning the &quot;smythes&quot; with the Earl of Rutland in 1541 refers to blooms. Nevertheless, the means by which the blast furnace spread in medieval Europe has not finally been determined.

=== Origin and spread of early modern blast furnaces ===
Due to the increased demand for iron for casting cannons, the blast furnace came into widespread use in France in the mid 15th century.

The direct ancestor of those used in France and England was in the Namur region, in what is now Wallonia (Belgium). From there, they spread first to the Pays de Bray on the eastern boundary of Normandy and from there to the Weald of Sussex, where the first furnace (called Queenstock) in Buxted was built in about 1491, followed by one at Newbridge in Ashdown Forest in 1496. They remained few in number until about 1530 but many were built in the following decades in the Weald, where the iron industry perhaps reached its peak about 1590. Most of the pig iron from these furnaces was taken to finery forges for the production of bar iron.

The first British furnaces outside the Weald appeared during the 1550s, and many were built in the remainder of that century and the following ones. The output of the industry probably peaked about 1620, and was followed by a slow decline until the early 18th century. This was apparently because it was more economic to import iron from Sweden and elsewhere than to make it in some more remote British locations. Charcoal that was economically available to the industry was probably being consumed as fast as the wood to make it grew.

The first blast furnace in Russia opened in 1637 near Tula and was called the Gorodishche Works. The blast furnace spread from there to central Russia and then finally to the Urals.

==== Coke blast furnaces ====

In 1709, at Coalbrookdale in Shropshire, England, Abraham Darby began to fuel a blast furnace with coke instead of charcoal. Coke&#x27;s initial advantage was its lower cost, mainly because making coke required much less labor than cutting trees and making charcoal, but using coke also overcame localized shortages of wood, especially in Britain and elsewhere in Europe. Metallurgical grade coke will bear heavier weight than charcoal, allowing larger furnaces. A disadvantage is that coke contains more impurities than charcoal, with sulfur being especially detrimental to the iron&#x27;s quality. Coke&#x27;s impurities were more of a problem before hot blast reduced the amount of coke required and before furnace temperatures were hot enough to make slag from limestone free flowing. (Limestone ties up sulphur. Manganese may also be added to tie up sulphur.)

Coke iron was initially only used for foundry work, making pots and other cast iron goods. Foundry work was a minor branch of the industry, but Darby&#x27;s son built a new furnace at nearby Horsehay, and began to supply the owners of finery forges with coke pig iron for the production of bar iron. Coke pig iron was by this time cheaper to produce than charcoal pig iron. The use of a coal-derived fuel in the iron industry was a key factor in the British Industrial Revolution. However, in many areas of the world charcoal was cheaper while coke was more expensive even after the Industrial Revolution: e. g., in the US charcoal-fueled iron production fell in share to about a half ca. 1850 but still continued to increase in absolute terms until ca. 1890, while in João Monlevade in the Brazilian Highlands charcoal-fired blast furnaces were built as late as the 1930s and only phased out in 2000.

Darby&#x27;s original blast furnace has been archaeologically excavated and can be seen in situ at Coalbrookdale, part of the Ironbridge Gorge Museums. Cast iron from the furnace was used to make girders for the world&#x27;s first cast iron bridge in 1779. The Iron Bridge crosses the River Severn at Coalbrookdale and remains in use for pedestrians.

====Steam-powered blast====
The steam engine was applied to power blast air, overcoming a shortage of water power in areas where coal and iron ore were located. This was first done at Coalbrookdale where a steam engine replaced a horse-powered pump in 1742. Such engines were used to pump water to a reservoir above the furnace. The first engines used to blow cylinders directly was supplied by Boulton and Watt to John Wilkinson&#x27;s New Willey Furnace. This powered a cast iron blowing cylinder, which had been invented by his father Isaac Wilkinson. He patented such cylinders in 1736, to replace the leather bellows, which wore out quickly. Isaac was granted a second patent, also for blowing cylinders, in 1757. The steam engine and cast iron blowing cylinder led to a large increase in British iron production in the late 18th century.

====Hot blast====
Hot blast was the single most important advance in fuel efficiency of the blast furnace and was one of the most important technologies developed during the Industrial Revolution. Hot blast was patented by James Beaumont Neilson at Wilsontown Ironworks in Britain in 1828. Within a few years of the introduction, hot blast was developed to the point where fuel consumption was cut by one-third using coke or two-thirds using coal, while furnace capacity was also significantly increased. Within a few decades, the practice was to have a &quot;stove&quot; as large as the furnace next to it into which the waste gas (containing CO) from the furnace was directed and burnt. The resultant heat was used to preheat the air blown into the furnace.

Hot blast enabled the use of raw anthracite coal, which was difficult to light, in the blast furnace. Anthracite was first tried successfully by George Crane at Ynyscedwyn Ironworks in south Wales in 1837. It was taken up in America by the Lehigh Crane Iron Company at Catasauqua, Pennsylvania, in 1839. Anthracite use declined when very high capacity blast furnaces requiring coke were built in the 1870s.

==Modern applications of the blast furnace==
=== Iron blast furnaces ===
The blast furnace remains an important part of modern iron production. Modern furnaces are highly efficient, including Cowper stoves to pre-heat the blast air and employ recovery systems to extract the heat from the hot gases exiting the furnace. Competition in industry drives higher production rates. The largest blast furnace in the world is in South Korea, with a volume around . It can produce around of iron per year.

This is a great increase from the typical 18th-century furnaces, which averaged about per year. Variations of the blast furnace, such as the Swedish electric blast furnace, have been developed in countries which have no native coal resources.

According to &quot;Global Energy Monitor&quot;, the blast furnace is likely to become obsolete to meet climate change objectives of reducing carbon dioxide emission, but BHP disagrees. An alternative process involving direct reduced iron (DRI) is likely to succeed it, but this also needs to use a blast furnace to melt the iron and remove the gangue (impurities) unless the ore is very high quality.

==== Oxygen blast furnace ====
The oxygen blast furnace (OBF) process, developed from the 1970s to the 1990s, has been extensively studied theoretically because of the potentials of promising energy conservation and emission reduction. This type may be the most suitable for use with CCS. The main blast furnace has of three levels; the reduction zone (), slag formation zone (), and the combustion zone ().

OBFs are usually combined with top gas recycling. The problem with this, besides significant oxygen expenditures, is the uneven distribution of gas recycled from the top of the furnace to the middle, which collides with the hot gas from below. As of 2023, the technology is only practiced on the experimental level in Sweden, Japan and China.

=== Blast furnaces in copper and lead smelting ===

Blast furnaces are currently rarely used in copper smelting, but modern lead smelting blast furnaces are much shorter than iron blast furnaces and are rectangular in shape. Modern lead blast furnaces are constructed using water-cooled steel or copper jackets for the walls, and have no refractory linings in the side walls. The base of the furnace is a hearth of refractory material (bricks or castable refractory). Lead blast furnaces are often open-topped rather than having the charging bell used in iron blast furnaces.

The blast furnace used at the Nyrstar Port Pirie lead smelter differs from most other lead blast furnaces in that it has a double row of tuyeres rather than the single row normally used. The lower shaft of the furnace has a chair shape with the lower part of the shaft being narrower than the upper. The lower row of tuyeres being located in the narrow part of the shaft. This allows the upper part of the shaft to be wider than the standard.

===Zinc blast furnaces===
The blast furnaces used in the Imperial Smelting Process (&quot;ISP&quot;) were developed from the standard lead blast furnace, but are fully sealed. This is because the zinc produced by these furnaces is recovered as metal from the vapor phase, and the presence of oxygen in the off-gas would result in the formation of zinc oxide.

Blast furnaces used in the ISP have a more intense operation than standard lead blast furnaces, with higher air blast rates per m2 of hearth area and a higher coke consumption.

Zinc production with the ISP is more expensive than with electrolytic zinc plants, so several smelters operating this technology have closed in recent years. However, ISP furnaces have the advantage of being able to treat zinc concentrates containing higher levels of lead than can electrolytic zinc plants.

===Manufacture of stone wool===

Stone wool or rock wool is a spun mineral fibre used as an insulation product and in hydroponics. It is manufactured in a blast furnace fed with diabase rock which contains very low levels of metal oxides. The resultant slag is drawn off and spun to form the rock wool product. Very small amounts of metals are also produced which are an unwanted by-product.

==Modern iron process==

Modern furnaces are equipped with an array of supporting facilities to increase efficiency, such as ore storage yards where barges are unloaded. The raw materials are transferred to the stockhouse complex by ore bridges, or rail hoppers and ore transfer cars. Rail-mounted scale cars or computer controlled weight hoppers weigh out the various raw materials to yield the desired hot metal and slag chemistry. The raw materials are brought to the top of the blast furnace via a skip car powered by winches or conveyor belts.

There are different ways in which the raw materials are charged into the blast furnace. Some blast furnaces use a &quot;double bell&quot; system where two &quot;bells&quot; are used to control the entry of raw material into the blast furnace. The purpose of the two bells is to minimize the loss of hot gases in the blast furnace. First, the raw materials are emptied into the upper or small bell which then opens to empty the charge into the large bell. The small bell then closes, to seal the blast furnace, while the large bell rotates to provide specific distribution of materials before dispensing the charge into the blast furnace. A more recent design is to use a &quot;bell-less&quot; system. These systems use multiple hoppers to contain each raw material, which is then discharged into the blast furnace through valves. These valves are more accurate at controlling how much of each constituent is added, as compared to the skip or conveyor system, thereby increasing the efficiency of the furnace. Some of these bell-less systems also implement a discharge chute in the throat of the furnace (as with the Paul Wurth top) in order to precisely control where the charge is placed.

The iron making blast furnace itself is built in the form of a tall structure, lined with refractory brick, and profiled to allow for expansion of the charged materials as they heat during their descent, and subsequent reduction in size as melting starts to occur. Coke, limestone flux, and iron ore (iron oxide) are charged into the top of the furnace in a precise filling order which helps control gas flow and the chemical reactions inside the furnace. Four &quot;uptakes&quot; allow the hot, dirty gas high in carbon monoxide content to exit the furnace throat, while &quot;bleeder valves&quot; protect the top of the furnace from sudden gas pressure surges. The coarse particles in the exhaust gas settle in the &quot;dust catcher&quot; and are dumped into a railroad car or truck for disposal, while the gas itself flows through a venturi scrubber and/or electrostatic precipitators and a gas cooler to reduce the temperature of the cleaned gas.

The &quot;casthouse&quot; at the bottom half of the furnace contains the bustle pipe, water cooled copper tuyeres and the equipment for casting the liquid iron and slag. Once a &quot;taphole&quot; is drilled through the refractory clay plug, liquid iron and slag flow down a trough through a &quot;skimmer&quot; opening, separating the iron and slag. Modern, larger blast furnaces may have as many as four tapholes and two casthouses. Once the pig iron and slag has been tapped, the taphole is again plugged with refractory clay.

The tuyeres are used to implement a hot blast, which is used to increase the efficiency of the blast furnace. The hot blast is directed into the furnace through water-cooled copper nozzles called tuyeres near the base. The hot blast temperature can be from depending on the stove design and condition. The temperatures they deal with may be . Oil, tar, natural gas, powdered coal and oxygen can also be injected into the furnace at tuyere level to combine with the coke to release additional energy and increase the percentage of reducing gases present which is necessary to increase productivity.

The exhaust gasses of a blast furnace are generally cleaned in the dust collector – such as an inertial separator, a baghouse, or an electrostatic precipitator. Each type of dust collector has strengths and weaknesses – some collect fine particles, some coarse particles, some collect electrically charged particles. Effective exhaust clearing relies on multiple stages of treatment. Waste heat is usually collected from the exhaust gases, for example by the use of a Cowper stove, a variety of heat exchanger.

==Environmental impact==
Fossil fuel (coke, natural gas) use in blast furnaces is a source of greenhouse gas emissions and the blast furnace is the most emission intensive stage of the steel making process. Fuels and reductants such as plastic waste, biomass and hydrogen are being used by steelmakers as possible alternatives to fossil fuels, although cost and availability remain a challenge and deployment is limited. 

Electric arc furnaces (EAF) are cited as an alternative steel production path which avoids the use of blast furnaces, however, depending on the characteristics of the steel product required the two furnace types are not always interchangeable. Furthermore, EAFs utilize steel scrap as a feedstock but estimates suggest that there will not be enough scrap available to meet future steel demand. Using hydrogen gas as a reductant to produce DRI (so called H2-DRI) from iron ore, which is then used as a feedstock for an EAF provides a technologically feasible, low emission alternative to blast furnaces. The H2-DRI EAF production route is in a fledgling state, with just one plant in operation.

A 2000 report from the International Energy Agency Greenhouse Gas Technical Collaboration Programme (IEAGHG) shows that 70% of the emissions from integrated steel plants arise directly from the blast furnace gas (BFG). By treating BFG with carbon capture technology prior to use for heat exchange and energy recovery within the plant, a portion of these emissions can be abated. The report estimates that chemical absorption would cost $35/t of , plus $8–20/t for transportation and storage. At the time, this would have increased steel production costs by 15–20%, presenting a barrier to decarbonisation for steelmakers which typically operate with margins of 8–10%. As of 2024 no blast furnaces have been equipped with carbon capture technology. 

ULCOS (Ultra Low CO2 Steelmaking) was a European programme exploring processes to reduce blast furnace emissions by at least 50%. Technologies identified include carbon capture and storage (CCS) and alternative energy sources and reductants such as hydrogen, electricity and biomass.
==Preserved historic blast furnaces==

Historically it was normal procedure for a decommissioned blast furnace to be demolished and either replaced with a newer, improved one, or to have the entire site demolished and treated for follow-up use of the area. In recent decades, several countries have realized the historic value of blast furnaces and have transformed them into museums. Examples can be found in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Japan, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Mexico, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom, and United States.

<text>Aryabhata ( ISO: ) or Aryabhata I (476–550 CE) was the first of the major mathematician-astronomers from the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy. His works include the &quot;Āryabhaṭīya&quot; (which mentions that in 3600 &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;, 499 CE, he was 23 years old) and the &quot;Arya-siddhanta&quot;.

For his explicit mention of the relativity of motion, he also qualifies as a major early physicist.

==Biography==
===Name===
While there is a tendency to misspell his name as &quot;Aryabhatta&quot; by analogy with other names having the &quot;bhatta&quot; suffix, his name is properly spelled Aryabhata: every astronomical text spells his name thus, including Brahmagupta&#x27;s references to him &quot;in more than a hundred places by name&quot;. Furthermore, in most instances &quot;Aryabhatta&quot; would not fit the metre either.

===Time and place of birth===
Aryabhata mentions in the &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot; that he was 23 years old 3,600 years into the &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;, but this is not to mean that the text was composed at that time. This mentioned year corresponds to 499 CE, and implies that he was born in 476. Aryabhata called himself a native of Kusumapura or Pataliputra (present day Patna, Bihar).

====Other hypothesis====
Bhāskara I describes Aryabhata as &quot;āśmakīya&quot;, &quot;one belonging to the &quot;Aśmaka&quot; country.&quot; During the Buddha&#x27;s time, a branch of the Aśmaka people settled in the region between the Narmada and Godavari rivers in central India.

It has been claimed that the &quot;aśmaka&quot; (Sanskrit for &quot;stone&quot;) where Aryabhata originated may be the present day Kodungallur which was the historical capital city of &quot;Thiruvanchikkulam&quot; of ancient Kerala. This is based on the belief that Koṭuṅṅallūr was earlier known as Koṭum-Kal-l-ūr (&quot;city of hard stones&quot;); however, old records show that the city was actually Koṭum-kol-ūr (&quot;city of strict governance&quot;). Similarly, the fact that several commentaries on the Aryabhatiya have come from Kerala has been used to suggest that it was Aryabhata&#x27;s main place of life and activity; however, many commentaries have come from outside Kerala, and the Aryasiddhanta was completely unknown in Kerala. K. Chandra Hari has argued for the Kerala hypothesis on the basis of astronomical evidence.

Aryabhata mentions &quot;Lanka&quot; on several occasions in the &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot;, but his &quot;Lanka&quot; is an abstraction, standing for a point on the equator at the same longitude as his Ujjayini.

===Education===
It is fairly certain that, at some point, he went to Kusumapura for advanced studies and lived there for some time. Both Hindu and Buddhist tradition, as well as Bhāskara I (CE 629), identify Kusumapura as Pāṭaliputra, modern Patna. A verse mentions that Aryabhata was the head of an institution (&quot;&quot;) at Kusumapura, and, because the university of Nalanda was in Pataliputra at the time, it is speculated that Aryabhata might have been the head of the Nalanda university as well. Aryabhata is also reputed to have set up an observatory at the Sun temple in Taregana, Bihar.

==Works==
Aryabhata is the author of several treatises on mathematics and astronomy, though &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot; is the only one which survives.

Much of the research included subjects in astronomy, mathematics, physics, biology, medicine, and other fields. &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot;, a compendium of mathematics and astronomy, was referred to in the Indian mathematical literature and has survived to modern times. The mathematical part of the &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot; covers arithmetic, algebra, plane trigonometry, and spherical trigonometry. It also contains continued fractions, quadratic equations, sums-of-power series, and a table of sines.

The &quot;Arya-siddhanta&quot;, a lost work on astronomical computations, is known through the writings of Aryabhata&#x27;s contemporary, Varahamihira, and later mathematicians and commentators, including Brahmagupta and Bhaskara I. This work appears to be based on the older Surya Siddhanta and uses the midnight-day reckoning, as opposed to sunrise in &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot;. It also contained a description of several astronomical instruments: the gnomon (&quot;shanku-yantra&quot;), a shadow instrument (&quot;chhAyA-yantra&quot;), possibly angle-measuring devices, semicircular and circular (&quot;dhanur-yantra&quot; / &quot;chakra-yantra&quot;), a cylindrical stick &quot;yasti-yantra&quot;, an umbrella-shaped device called the &quot;chhatra-yantra&quot;, and water clocks of at least two types, bow-shaped and cylindrical.

A third text, which may have survived in the Arabic translation, is &quot;Al ntf&quot; or &quot;Al-nanf&quot;. It claims that it is a translation by Aryabhata, but the Sanskrit name of this work is not known. Probably dating from the 9th century, it is mentioned by the Persian scholar and chronicler of India, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī.

===Aryabhatiya===
Direct details of Aryabhata&#x27;s work are known only from the &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot;. The name &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot; is due to later commentators. Aryabhata himself may not have given it a name. His disciple Bhaskara I calls it &quot;Ashmakatantra&quot; (or the treatise from the Ashmaka). It is also occasionally referred to as &quot;Arya-shatas-aShTa&quot; (literally, Aryabhata&#x27;s 108), because there are 108 verses in the text. It is written in the very terse style typical of sutra literature, in which each line is an aid to memory for a complex system. Thus, the explication of meaning is due to commentators. The text consists of the 108 verses and 13 introductory verses, and is divided into four &quot;pāda&quot;s or chapters:

# &quot;Gitikapada&quot;: (13 verses): large units of time—&quot;kalpa&quot;, &quot;manvantra&quot;, and &quot;yuga&quot;—which present a cosmology different from earlier texts such as Lagadha&#x27;s &quot;Vedanga Jyotisha&quot; (c. 1st century BCE). There is also a table of sines (&quot;jya&quot;), given in a single verse. The duration of the planetary revolutions during a &quot;mahayuga&quot; is given as 4.32 million years.
# &quot;Ganitapada&quot; (33 verses): covering mensuration (&quot;kṣetra vyāvahāra&quot;), arithmetic and geometric progressions, gnomon / shadows (&quot;shanku&quot;-&quot;chhAyA&quot;), simple, quadratic, simultaneous, and indeterminate equations (&quot;kuṭṭaka&quot;).
# &quot;Kalakriyapada&quot; (25 verses): different units of time and a method for determining the positions of planets for a given day, calculations concerning the intercalary month (&quot;adhikamAsa&quot;), &quot;kShaya-tithi&quot;s, and a seven-day week with names for the days of week.
# &quot;Golapada&quot; (50 verses): Geometric/trigonometric aspects of the celestial sphere, features of the ecliptic, celestial equator, node, shape of the earth, cause of day and night, rising of zodiacal signs on horizon, etc. In addition, some versions cite a few colophons added at the end, extolling the virtues of the work, etc.

The &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot; presented a number of innovations in mathematics and astronomy in verse form, which were influential for many centuries. The extreme brevity of the text was elaborated in commentaries by his disciple Bhaskara I (&quot;Bhashya&quot;, c. 600 CE) and by Nilakantha Somayaji in his &quot;Aryabhatiya Bhasya&quot; (1465 CE).

&quot;Aryabhatiya&quot; is also well-known for his description of relativity of motion. He expressed this relativity thus: &quot;Just as a man in a boat moving forward sees the stationary objects (on the shore) as moving backward, just so are the stationary stars seen by the people on earth as moving exactly towards the west.&quot;

==Mathematics==

===Place value system and zero===
The place-value system, first seen in the 3rd-century Bakhshali Manuscript, was clearly in place in his work. While he did not use a symbol for zero, the French mathematician Georges Ifrah argues that knowledge of zero was implicit in Aryabhata&#x27;s place-value system as a place holder for the powers of ten with null coefficients.

However, Aryabhata did not use the Brahmi numerals. Continuing the Sanskritic tradition from Vedic times, he used letters of the alphabet to denote numbers, expressing quantities, such as the table of sines in a mnemonic form.

===Approximation of &quot;π&quot;===
Aryabhata worked on the approximation for pi (π), and may have come to the conclusion that π is irrational. In the second part of the &quot;Aryabhatiyam&quot; ( 10), he writes:
&quot;
&quot;Add four to 100, multiply by eight, and then add 62,000. By this rule the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 20,000 can be approached.&quot;
This implies that for a circle whose diameter is 20000, the circumference will be 62832

i.e, formula_1 = formula_2 = formula_3, which is accurate to two parts in one million.

It is speculated that Aryabhata used the word &quot;āsanna&quot; (approaching), to mean that not only is this an approximation but that the value is incommensurable (or irrational). If this is correct, it is quite a sophisticated insight, because the irrationality of pi (π) was proved in Europe only in 1761 by Lambert.

After Aryabhatiya was translated into Arabic (c. 820 CE), this approximation was mentioned in Al-Khwarizmi&#x27;s book on algebra.

===Trigonometry===
In Ganitapada 6, Aryabhata gives the area of a triangle as
that translates to: &quot;for a triangle, the result of a perpendicular with the half-side is the area.&quot;

Aryabhata discussed the concept of &quot;sine&quot; in his work by the name of &quot;ardha-jya&quot;, which literally means &quot;half-chord&quot;. For simplicity, people started calling it &quot;jya&quot;. When Arabic writers translated his works from Sanskrit into Arabic, they referred it as &quot;jiba&quot;. However, in Arabic writings, vowels are omitted, and it was abbreviated as &quot;jb&quot;. Later writers substituted it with &quot;jaib&quot;, meaning &quot;pocket&quot; or &quot;fold (in a garment)&quot;. (In Arabic, &quot;jiba&quot; is a meaningless word.) Later in the 12th century, when Gherardo of Cremona translated these writings from Arabic into Latin, he replaced the Arabic &quot;jaib&quot; with its Latin counterpart, &quot;sinus&quot;, which means &quot;cove&quot; or &quot;bay&quot;; thence comes the English word &quot;sine&quot;.

===Indeterminate equations===
A problem of great interest to Indian mathematicians since ancient times has been to find integer solutions to Diophantine equations that have the form ax + by = c. (This problem was also studied in ancient Chinese mathematics, and its solution is usually referred to as the Chinese remainder theorem.) This is an example from Bhāskara&#x27;s commentary on Aryabhatiya:
: Find the number which gives 5 as the remainder when divided by 8, 4 as the remainder when divided by 9, and 1 as the remainder when divided by 7
That is, find N = 8x+5 = 9y+4 = 7z+1. It turns out that the smallest value for N is 85. In general, diophantine equations, such as this, can be notoriously difficult. They were discussed extensively in ancient Vedic text Sulba Sutras, whose more ancient parts might date to 800 BCE. Aryabhata&#x27;s method of solving such problems, elaborated by Bhaskara in 621 CE, is called the &quot;&quot; (कुट्टक) method. &quot;Kuṭṭaka&quot; means &quot;pulverizing&quot; or &quot;breaking into small pieces&quot;, and the method involves a recursive algorithm for writing the original factors in smaller numbers. This algorithm became the standard method for solving first-order diophantine equations in Indian mathematics, and initially the whole subject of algebra was called &quot;kuṭṭaka-gaṇita&quot; or simply &quot;kuṭṭaka&quot;.

===Algebra===
In &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot;, Aryabhata provided elegant results for the summation of series of squares and cubes:
:formula_4
and
:formula_5 (see squared triangular number)

==Astronomy==
Aryabhata&#x27;s system of astronomy was called the &quot;audAyaka system&quot;, in which days are reckoned from &quot;uday&quot;, dawn at &quot;lanka&quot; or &quot;equator&quot;. Some of his later writings on astronomy, which apparently proposed a second model (or &quot;ardha-rAtrikA&quot;, midnight) are lost but can be partly reconstructed from the discussion in Brahmagupta&#x27;s &quot;Khandakhadyaka&quot;. In some texts, he seems to ascribe the apparent motions of the heavens to the Earth&#x27;s rotation. He may have believed that the planet&#x27;s orbits are elliptical rather than circular.

===Motions of the Solar System===
Aryabhata correctly insisted that the Earth rotates about its axis daily, and that the apparent movement of the stars is a relative motion caused by the rotation of the Earth, contrary to the then-prevailing view, that the sky rotated. This is indicated in the first chapter of the &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot;, where he gives the number of rotations of the Earth in a &quot;yuga&quot;, and made more explicit in his &quot;gola&quot; chapter:
Aryabhata described a geocentric model of the Solar System, in which the
Sun and Moon are each carried by epicycles. They in turn revolve around the Earth. In this model, which is also found in the &quot;Paitāmahasiddhānta&quot; (c. 425 CE), the motions of the planets are each governed by two epicycles, a smaller &quot;manda&quot; (slow) and a larger &quot;śīghra&quot; (fast). The order of the planets in terms of distance from earth is taken as: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the asterisms.

The positions and periods of the planets was calculated relative to uniformly moving points. In the case of Mercury and Venus, they move around the Earth at the same mean speed as the Sun. In the case of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, they move around the Earth at specific speeds, representing each planet&#x27;s motion through the zodiac. Most historians of astronomy consider that this two-epicycle model reflects elements of pre-Ptolemaic Greek astronomy. Another element in Aryabhata&#x27;s model, the &quot;śīghrocca&quot;, the basic planetary period in relation to the Sun, is seen by some historians as a sign of an underlying heliocentric model.

===Eclipses===
Solar and lunar eclipses were scientifically explained by Aryabhata. He states that the Moon and planets shine by reflected sunlight. Instead of the prevailing cosmogony in which eclipses were caused by Rahu and Ketu (identified as the pseudo-planetary lunar nodes), he explains eclipses in terms of shadows cast by and falling on Earth. Thus, the lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon enters into the Earth&#x27;s shadow (verse gola.37). He discusses at length the size and extent of the Earth&#x27;s shadow (verses gola.38–48) and then provides the computation and the size of the eclipsed part during an eclipse. Later Indian astronomers improved on the calculations, but Aryabhata&#x27;s methods provided the core. His computational paradigm was so accurate that 18th-century scientist Guillaume Le Gentil, during a visit to Pondicherry, India, found the Indian computations of the duration of the lunar eclipse of 30 August 1765 to be short by 41 seconds, whereas his charts (by Tobias Mayer, 1752) were long by 68 seconds.

===Sidereal periods===
Considered in modern English units of time, Aryabhata calculated the sidereal rotation (the rotation of the earth referencing the fixed stars) as 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4.1 seconds; the modern value is 23:56:4.091. Similarly, his value for the length of the sidereal year at 365 days, 6 hours, 12 minutes, and 30 seconds (365.25858 days) is an error of 3 minutes and 20 seconds over the length of a year (365.25636 days).

===Heliocentrism===
As mentioned, Aryabhata advocated an astronomical model in which the Earth turns on its own axis. His model also gave corrections (the &quot;śīgra&quot; anomaly) for the speeds of the planets in the sky in terms of the mean speed of the Sun. Thus, it has been suggested that Aryabhata&#x27;s calculations were based on an underlying heliocentric model, in which the planets orbit the Sun, though this has been rebutted. It has also been suggested that aspects of Aryabhata&#x27;s system may have been derived from an earlier, likely pre-Ptolemaic Greek, heliocentric model of which Indian astronomers were unaware, though the evidence is scant. The general consensus is that a synodic anomaly (depending on the position of the Sun) does not imply a physically heliocentric orbit (such corrections being also present in late Babylonian astronomical texts), and that Aryabhata&#x27;s system was not explicitly heliocentric.

==Legacy==

Aryabhata&#x27;s work was of great influence in the Indian astronomical tradition and influenced several neighbouring cultures through translations. The Arabic translation during the Islamic Golden Age (c. 820 CE), was particularly influential. Some of his results are cited by Al-Khwarizmi and in the 10th century Al-Biruni stated that Aryabhata&#x27;s followers believed that the Earth rotated on its axis.

His definitions of sine (&quot;jya&quot;), cosine (&quot;kojya&quot;), versine (&quot;utkrama-jya&quot;),
and inverse sine (&quot;otkram jya&quot;) influenced the birth of trigonometry. He was also the first to specify sine and versine (1 − cos &quot;x&quot;) tables, in 3.75° intervals from 0° to 90°, to an accuracy of 4 decimal places.

In fact, the modern terms &quot;sine&quot; and &quot;cosine&quot; are mistranscriptions of the words &quot;jya&quot; and &quot;kojya&quot; as introduced by Aryabhata. As mentioned, they were translated as &quot;jiba&quot; and &quot;kojiba&quot; in Arabic and then misunderstood by Gerard of Cremona while translating an Arabic geometry text to Latin. He assumed that &quot;jiba&quot; was the Arabic word &quot;jaib&quot;, which means &quot;fold in a garment&quot;, L. &quot;sinus&quot; (c. 1150).

Aryabhata&#x27;s astronomical calculation methods were also very influential.
Along with the trigonometric tables, they came to be widely used in the Islamic world and used to compute many Arabic astronomical tables (zijes). In particular, the astronomical tables in the work of the Arabic Spain scientist Al-Zarqali (11th century) were translated into Latin as the Tables of Toledo (12th century) and remained the most accurate ephemeris used in Europe for centuries.

Calendric calculations devised by Aryabhata and his followers have been in continuous use in India for the practical purposes of fixing the Panchangam (the Hindu calendar). In the Islamic world, they formed the basis of the Jalali calendar introduced in 1073 CE by a group of astronomers including Omar Khayyam, versions of which (modified in 1925) are the national calendars in use in Iran and Afghanistan today. The dates of the Jalali calendar are based on actual solar transit, as in Aryabhata and earlier Siddhanta calendars. This type of calendar requires an ephemeris for calculating dates. Although dates were difficult to compute, seasonal errors were less in the Jalali calendar than in the Gregorian calendar.

Aryabhatta Knowledge University (AKU), Patna has been established by Government of Bihar for the development and management of educational infrastructure related to technical, medical, management and allied professional education in his honour. The university is governed by Bihar State University Act 2008.

India&#x27;s first satellite Aryabhata and the lunar crater Aryabhata are both named in his honour, the Aryabhata satellite also featured on the reverse of the Indian 2-rupee note. An Institute for conducting research in astronomy, astrophysics and atmospheric sciences is the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) near Nainital, India. The inter-school Aryabhata Maths Competition is also named after him, as is &quot;Bacillus aryabhata&quot;, a species of bacteria discovered in the stratosphere by ISRO scientists in 2009.

<text>Brahmagupta ( – ) was an Indian mathematician and astronomer. He is the author of two early works on mathematics and astronomy: the &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot; (BSS, &quot;correctly established doctrine of Brahma&quot;, dated 628), a theoretical treatise, and the &quot;Khandakhadyaka&quot; (&quot;edible bite&quot;, dated 665), a more practical text.

In 628 CE, Brahmagupta first described gravity as an attractive force, and used the term &quot;gurutvākarṣaṇam (गुरुत्वाकर्षणम्)&quot; in Sanskrit to describe it. He is also credited with the first clear description of the quadratic formula (the solution of the quadratic equation) in his main work, the &quot;Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta&quot;.

==Life and career==
Brahmagupta, according to his own statement, was born in 598 CE. Born in &quot;Bhillamāla&quot; in Gurjaradesa (modern Bhinmal in Rajasthan, India) during the reign of the Chavda dynasty ruler Vyagrahamukha. He was the son of Jishnugupta and was a Hindu by religion, in particular, a Shaivite. He lived and worked there for a good part of his life. Prithudaka Svamin, a later commentator, called him &quot;Bhillamalacharya&quot;, the teacher from Bhillamala.

Bhillamala was the capital of the Gurjaradesa, the second-largest kingdom of Western India, comprising southern Rajasthan and northern Gujarat in modern-day India. It was also a centre of learning for mathematics and astronomy. He became an astronomer of the &quot;Brahmapaksha&quot; school, one of the four major schools of Indian astronomy during this period. He studied the five traditional &quot;Siddhantas&quot; on Indian astronomy as well as the work of other astronomers including Aryabhata I, Latadeva, Pradyumna, Varahamihira, Simha, Srisena, Vijayanandin and Vishnuchandra. 

In the year 628, at the age of 30, he composed the &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot; (&quot;improved treatise of Brahma&quot;) which is believed to be a revised version of the received &quot;Siddhanta&quot; of the &quot;Brahmapaksha&quot; school of astronomy. Scholars state that he incorporated a great deal of originality into his revision, adding a considerable amount of new material. The book consists of 24 chapters with 1008 verses in the ārya metre. A good deal of it is astronomy, but it also contains key chapters on mathematics, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry and algorithmics, which are believed to contain new insights due to Brahmagupta himself.

Later, Brahmagupta moved to Ujjaini, Avanti, a major centre for astronomy in central India. At the age of 67, he composed his next well-known work &quot;Khanda-khādyaka&quot;, a practical manual of Indian astronomy in the &quot;karana&quot; category meant to be used by students.

Brahmagupta died in 668 CE, and he is presumed to have died in Ujjain.

== Works ==
Brahmagupta composed the following treatises:

* &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot;, composed in 628 CE.
* &quot;Khaṇḍakhādyaka&quot;, composed in 665 CE.
* &quot;Grahaṇārkajñāna&quot;, (ascribed in one manuscript)

==Reception==
Brahmagupta&#x27;s mathematical advances were carried on further by Bhāskara II, a lineal descendant in Ujjain, who described Brahmagupta as the &quot;ganaka-chakra-chudamani&quot; (the gem of the circle of mathematicians). Prithudaka Svamin wrote commentaries on both of his works, rendering difficult verses into simpler language and adding illustrations. Lalla and Bhattotpala in the 8th and 9th centuries wrote commentaries on the &quot;Khanda-khadyaka&quot;. Further commentaries continued to be written into the 12th century.

A few decades after the death of Brahmagupta, Sindh came under the Arab Caliphate in 712 CE. Expeditions were sent into &quot;Gurjaradesa&quot; (&quot;&quot;Al-Baylaman&quot; in &quot;Jurz&quot;&quot;, as per Arab historians). The kingdom of Bhillamala seems to have been annihilated but Ujjain repulsed the attacks. The court of Caliph Al-Mansur (754–775) received an embassy from Sindh, including an astrologer called Kanaka, who brought (possibly memorised) astronomical texts, including those of Brahmagupta. Brahmagupta&#x27;s texts were translated into Arabic by Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm al-Fazārī, an astronomer in Al-Mansur&#x27;s court, under the names &quot;Sindhind&quot; and &quot;Arakhand&quot;. An immediate outcome was the spread of the decimal number system used in the texts. The mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (800–850 CE) wrote a text called &quot;al-Jam wal-tafriq bi hisal-al-Hind&quot; (Addition and Subtraction in Indian Arithmetic), which was translated into Latin in the 13th century as &quot;Algorithmi de numero indorum&quot;. Through these texts, the decimal number system and Brahmagupta&#x27;s algorithms for arithmetic have spread throughout the world. Al-Khwarizmi also wrote his own version of &quot;Sindhind&quot;, drawing on Al-Fazari&#x27;s version and incorporating Ptolemaic elements. Indian astronomic material circulated widely for centuries, even making its way into medieval Latin texts.

The historian of science George Sarton called Brahmagupta &quot;one of the greatest scientists of his race and the greatest of his time.&quot;

==Mathematics==
===Algebra===
Brahmagupta gave the solution of the general linear equation in chapter eighteen of &quot;Brahmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot;,

 The difference between &quot;rupas&quot;, when inverted and divided by the difference of the [coefficients] of the [unknowns], is the unknown in the equation. The &quot;rupas&quot; are [subtracted on the side] below that from which the square and the unknown are to be subtracted.

which is a solution for the equation where &quot;rupas&quot; refers to the constants and . The solution given is equivalent to .

He further gave two equivalent solutions to the general quadratic equation

18.44. Diminish by the middle [number] the square-root of the &quot;rupas&quot; multiplied by four times the square and increased by the square of the middle [number]; divide the remainder by twice the square. [The result is] the middle [number].
18.45. Whatever is the square-root of the &quot;rupas&quot; multiplied by the square [and] increased by the square of half the unknown, diminished that by half the unknown [and] divide [the remainder] by its square. [The result is] the unknown.

which are, respectively, solutions for the equation equivalent to,

:formula_1

and

:formula_2

He went on to solve systems of simultaneous indeterminate equations stating that the desired variable must first be isolated, and then the equation must be divided by the desired variable&#x27;s coefficient. In particular, he recommended using &quot;the pulverizer&quot; to solve equations with multiple unknowns.

18.51. Subtract the colors different from the first color. [The remainder] divided by the first [color&#x27;s coefficient] is the measure of the first. [Terms] two by two [are] considered [when reduced to] similar divisors, [and so on] repeatedly. If there are many [colors], the pulverizer [is to be used].

Like the algebra of Diophantus, the algebra of Brahmagupta was syncopated. Addition was indicated by placing the numbers side by side, subtraction by placing a dot over the subtrahend, and division by placing the divisor below the dividend, similar to our notation but without the bar. Multiplication, evolution, and unknown quantities were represented by abbreviations of appropriate terms. The extent of Greek influence on this syncopation, if any, is not known and it is possible that both Greek and Indian syncopation may be derived from a common Babylonian source.

===Arithmetic===
The four fundamental operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) were known to many cultures before Brahmagupta. This current system is based on the Hindu–Arabic numeral system and first appeared in the &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot;. Brahmagupta describes multiplication in the following way:

The multiplicand is repeated like a string for cattle, as often as there are integrant portions in the multiplier and is repeatedly multiplied by them and the products are added together. It is multiplication. Or the multiplicand is repeated as many times as there are component parts in the multiplier.

Indian arithmetic was known in medieval Europe as &quot;modus Indorum&quot; meaning &quot;method of the Indians&quot;. In the &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot;, four methods for multiplication were described, including &quot;gomūtrikā&quot;, which is said to be close to the present-day methods. In the beginning of chapter twelve of his &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot;, entitled &quot;Calculation&quot;, he also details operations on fractions. The reader is expected to know the basic arithmetic operations as far as taking the square root, although he explains how to find the cube and cube-root of an integer and later gives rules facilitating the computation of squares and square roots. He then gives rules for dealing with five types of combinations of fractions: ; ; ; ; and .

====Squares and Cubes====
Brahmagupta then goes on to give the sum of the squares and cubes of the first integers.
12.20. The sum of the squares is that [sum] multiplied by twice the [number of] step[s] increased by one [and] divided by three. The sum of the cubes is the square of that [sum] Piles of these with identical balls [can also be computed].
Here Brahmagupta found the result in terms of the &quot;sum&quot; of the first integers, rather than in terms of as is the modern practice.

He gives the sum of the squares of the first natural numbers as and the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers as .

====Zero====
Brahmagupta&#x27;s &quot;Brahmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot; is the first book that provides rules for arithmetic manipulations that apply to zero and to negative numbers. The &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot; is the earliest known text to treat zero as a number in its own right, rather than as simply a placeholder digit in representing another number as was done by the Babylonians or as a symbol for lack of quantity as was done by Ptolemy and the Romans. In chapter eighteen of his &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot;, Brahmagupta describes operations on negative numbers. He first describes addition and subtraction,
18.30. [The sum] of two positives is positives, of two negatives negative; of a positive and a negative [the sum] is their difference; if they are equal it is zero. The sum of a negative and zero is negative, [that] of a positive and zero positives, [and that] of two zeros zero.
18.32. A negative minus zero is negative, a positive [minus zero] is positive; zero [minus zero] is zero. When a positive is to be subtracted from a negative or a negative from a positive, then it is to be added.

He goes on to describe multiplication,
18.33. The product of a negative and a positive is negative, of two negatives positive, and of positives positive; the product of zero and a negative, of zero and a positive, or of two zeros is zero.

But his description of division by zero differs from our modern understanding:
18.34. A positive divided by a positive or a negative divided by a negative is positive; a zero divided by zero is zero; a positive divided by a negative is negative; a negative divided by a positive is [also] negative.
18.35. A negative or a positive divided by zero has that [zero] as its divisor, or zero divided by a negative or a positive [has that negative or positive as its divisor]. The square of a negative or positive is positive; [the square] of zero is zero. That of which [the square] is the square is [its] square root.

Here Brahmagupta states that = 0 and as for the question of where ≠ 0 he did not commit himself. His rules for arithmetic on negative numbers and zero are quite close to the modern understanding, except that in modern mathematics division by zero is left undefined.

===Diophantine analysis===

====Pythagorean triplets====
In chapter twelve of his &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot;, Brahmagupta provides a formula useful for generating Pythagorean triples:
12.39. The height of a mountain multiplied by a given multiplier is the distance to a city; it is not erased. When it is divided by the multiplier increased by two it is the leap of one of the two who make the same journey.
Or, in other words, if , then a traveller who &quot;leaps&quot; vertically upwards a distance from the top of a mountain of height , and then travels in a straight line to a city at a horizontal distance from the base of the mountain, travels the same distance as one who descends vertically down the mountain and then travels along the horizontal to the city. Stated geometrically, this says that if a right-angled triangle has a base of length and altitude of length , then the length, , of its hypotenuse is given by . And, indeed, elementary algebraic manipulation shows that whenever has the value stated. Also, if and are rational, so are , , and . A Pythagorean triple can therefore be obtained from , and by multiplying each of them by the least common multiple of their denominators.

====Pell&#x27;s equation====
Brahmagupta went on to give a recurrence relation for generating solutions to certain instances of Diophantine equations of the second degree such as (called Pell&#x27;s equation) by using the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm was known to him as the &quot;pulverizer&quot; since it breaks numbers down into ever smaller pieces.

The nature of squares:18.64. [Put down] twice the square-root of a given square by a multiplier and increased or diminished by an arbitrary [number]. The product of the first [pair], multiplied by the multiplier, with the product of the last [pair], is the last computed.18.65. The sum of the thunderbolt products is the first. The additive is equal to the product of the additives. The two square-roots, divided by the additive or the subtractive, are the additive &quot;rupas&quot;.

The key to his solution was the identity,

:formula_3

which is a generalisation of an identity that was discovered by Diophantus,

:formula_4

Using his identity and the fact that if and are solutions to the equations and , respectively, then is a solution to , he was able to find integral solutions to Pell&#x27;s equation through a series of equations of the form . Brahmagupta was not able to apply his solution uniformly for all possible values of , rather he was only able to show that if has an integer solution for = ±1, ±2, or ±4, then has a solution. The solution of the general Pell&#x27;s equation would have to wait for Bhāskara II in .

===Geometry===

====Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula====

Brahmagupta&#x27;s most famous result in geometry is his formula for cyclic quadrilaterals. Given the lengths of the sides of any cyclic quadrilateral, Brahmagupta gave an approximate and an exact formula for the figure&#x27;s area,
12.21. The approximate area is the product of the halves of the sums of the sides and opposite sides of a triangle and a quadrilateral. The accurate [area] is the square root from the product of the halves of the sums of the sides diminished by [each] side of the quadrilateral.
So given the lengths , , and of a cyclic quadrilateral, the approximate area is while, letting , the exact area is

Although Brahmagupta does not explicitly state that these quadrilaterals are cyclic, it is apparent from his rules that this is the case. Heron&#x27;s formula is a special case of this formula and it can be derived by setting one of the sides equal to zero.

===Triangles===
Brahmagupta dedicated a substantial portion of his work to geometry. One theorem gives the lengths of the two segments a triangle&#x27;s base is divided into by its altitude:
12.22. The base decreased and increased by the difference between the squares of the sides divided by the base; when divided by two they are the true segments. The perpendicular [altitude] is the square-root from the square of a side diminished by the square of its segment.
Thus the lengths of the two segments are .

He further gives a theorem on rational triangles. A triangle with rational sides , , and rational area is of the form:

:formula_5

for some rational numbers , , and .

====Brahmagupta&#x27;s theorem====

Brahmagupta continues,
12.23. The square-root of the sum of the two products of the sides and opposite sides of a non-unequal quadrilateral is the diagonal. The square of the diagonal is diminished by the square of half the sum of the base and the top; the square-root is the perpendicular [altitudes].
So, in a &quot;non-unequal&quot; cyclic quadrilateral (that is, an isosceles trapezoid), the length of each diagonal is .

He continues to give formulas for the lengths and areas of geometric figures, such as the circumradius of an isosceles trapezoid and a scalene quadrilateral, and the lengths of diagonals in a scalene cyclic quadrilateral. This leads up to Brahmagupta&#x27;s famous theorem,
12.30–31. Imaging two triangles within [a cyclic quadrilateral] with unequal sides, the two diagonals are the two bases. Their two segments are separately the upper and lower segments [formed] at the intersection of the diagonals. The two [lower segments] of the two diagonals are two sides in a triangle; the base [of the quadrilateral is the base of the triangle]. Its perpendicular is the lower portion of the [central] perpendicular; the upper portion of the [central] perpendicular is half of the sum of the [sides] perpendiculars diminished by the lower [portion of the central perpendicular].

====Pi====
In verse 40, he gives values of ,
12.40. The diameter and the square of the radius [each] multiplied by 3 are [respectively] the practical circumference and the area [of a circle]. The accurate [values] are the square-roots from the squares of those two multiplied by ten.
So Brahmagupta uses 3 as a &quot;practical&quot; value of , and formula_6 as an &quot;accurate&quot; value of , with an error less than 1%.

====Measurements and constructions====

Brahmagupta gives constructions of various figures with arbitrary sides. He essentially manipulated right triangles to produce isosceles triangles, scalene triangles, rectangles, isosceles trapezoids, isosceles trapezoids with three equal sides, and a scalene cyclic quadrilateral.

After giving the value of pi, he deals with the geometry of plane figures and solids, such as finding volumes and surface areas (or empty spaces dug out of solids). He finds the volume of rectangular prisms, pyramids, and the frustum of a square pyramid. He further finds the average depth of a series of pits. For the volume of a frustum of a pyramid, he gives the &quot;pragmatic&quot; value as the depth times the square of the mean of the edges of the top and bottom faces, and he gives the &quot;superficial&quot; volume as the depth times their mean area.

===Trigonometry===

====Sine table====

In Chapter 2 of his &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot;, entitled &quot;Planetary True Longitudes&quot;, Brahmagupta presents a sine table:

2.2–5. The sines: The Progenitors, twins; Ursa Major, twins, the Vedas; the gods, fires, six; flavors, dice, the gods; the moon, five, the sky, the moon; the moon, arrows, suns [...]

Here Brahmagupta uses names of objects to represent the digits of place-value numerals, as was common with numerical data in Sanskrit treatises. Progenitors represents the 14 Progenitors (&quot;Manu&quot;) in Indian cosmology or 14, &quot;twins&quot; means 2, &quot;Ursa Major&quot; represents the seven stars of Ursa Major or 7, &quot;Vedas&quot; refers to the 4 Vedas or 4, dice represents the number of sides of the traditional die or 6, and so on. This information can be translated into the list of sines, 214, 427, 638, 846, 1051, 1251, 1446, 1635, 1817, 1991, 2156, 2312, 2459, 2594, 2719, 2832, 2933, 3021, 3096, 3159, 3207, 3242, 3263, and 3270, with the radius being 3270 (this numbers represent formula_7 for formula_8).

====Interpolation formula====
In 665 Brahmagupta devised and used a special case of the Newton–Stirling interpolation formula of the second-order to interpolate
new values of the sine function from other values already tabulated. The formula gives an estimate for the value of a function at a value of its argument (with and ) when its value is already known at , and .

The formula for the estimate is:

: formula_9

where is the first-order forward-difference operator, i.e.

: formula_10

== Early concept of gravity ==
Brahmagupta in 628 first described gravity as an attractive force, using the term &quot;&quot; to describe it:

The earth on all its sides is the same; all people on the earth stand upright, and all heavy things fall down to the earth by a law of nature, for it is the nature of the earth to attract and to keep things, as it is the nature of water to flow ... If a thing wants to go deeper down than the earth, let it try. The earth is the only &quot;low&quot; thing, and seeds always return to it, in whatever direction you may throw them away, and never rise upwards from the earth.

==Astronomy==
Brahmagupta directed a great deal of criticism towards the work of rival astronomers, and his &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot; displays one of the earliest schisms among Indian mathematicians. The division was primarily about the application of mathematics to the physical world, rather than about the mathematics itself. In Brahmagupta&#x27;s case, the disagreements stemmed largely from the choice of astronomical parameters and theories. Critiques of rival theories appear throughout the first ten astronomical chapters and the eleventh chapter is entirely devoted to criticism of these theories, although no criticisms appear in the twelfth and eighteenth chapters.

In chapter seven of his &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot;, entitled &quot;Lunar Crescent&quot;, Brahmagupta rebuts the idea that the Moon is farther from the Earth than the Sun. He does this by explaining the illumination of the Moon by the Sun.

1. If the moon were above the sun, how would the power of waxing and waning, etc., be produced from calculation of the longitude of the moon? The near half would always be bright.
2. In the same way that the half seen by the sun of a pot standing in sunlight is bright, and the unseen half dark, so is [the illumination] of the moon [if it is] beneath the sun.
3. The brightness is increased in the direction of the sun. At the end of a bright [i.e. waxing] half-month, the near half is bright and the far half dark. Hence, the elevation of the horns [of the crescent can be derived] from calculation. [...]

He explains that since the Moon is closer to the Earth than the Sun, the degree of the illuminated part of the Moon depends on the relative positions of the Sun and the Moon, and this can be computed from the size of the angle between the two bodies.

Further work exploring the longitudes of the planets, diurnal rotation, lunar and solar eclipses, risings and settings, the moon&#x27;s crescent and conjunctions of the planets, are discussed in his treatise Khandakhadyaka.

<doc id="297208" wikidata="Q1423663" url="?curid=297208" title="Yajnavalkya">
<text>Yajnavalkya or Yagyavalkya (, IAST:) is a Hindu Vedic sage featuring in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (c. 900 BCE) and &quot;Tattiriya Upanishad&quot;. Yajnavalkya proposes and debates metaphysical questions about the nature of existence, consciousness and impermanence, and expounds the epistemic doctrine of neti neti (&quot;not this, not this&quot;) to discover the universal Self and Ātman. Texts attributed to him include the &quot;Yajnavalkya Smriti&quot;, &quot;Yoga Yajnavalkya&quot; and some texts of the Vedanta school. He is also mentioned in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; as well as various Puranas, Brahmanas and Aranyakas.

==Highlights==
Staal notes that though the name Yajnavalkya is derived from &quot;yajna&quot;, which connotes ritual, Yajnavalkya is referred to as &quot;a thinker, not a ritualist.&quot;

According to tradition, Yajnavalkya was a pupil of Vaisampayana and the compiler of the &quot;Shukla Yajurveda Samhita&quot;. Yajnavalkya was the pupil of Uddālaka Āruṇi, whom he defeated in debate. 

Within both the &quot;Sukla Yajur Veda&quot; and the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot;, he is depicted as being blunt, provocative and sarcastic. In the first verse of the &quot;Yajnavalkya Smriti&quot;, Yajnavalkya is described as the &quot;yogesvara: meaning &quot;the king of yogis.&quot;

Yajnavalkya plays a central position in a debate known as Bahudakshina Yajna hosted by King Janaka in Mithila, Videha, which is in the east of India, where Yajnavalkya defeats philosophers from all around the country. The debate ended with Gargi, a female scholar and one of the nine gems of King Janaka’s court, clearly asserting Yajnavalkya as the most superior brahmin of them all.

In the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot;, a set of dialogues portrays Yajnavalkya as having two wives, Maitreyi and Katyayani. Maitreyi, as opposed to Katyayani, was more intrigued to gain spiritual knowledge. Maitreyi was known as a brahmavadini, a discusser of Brahman. Katyayani is merely described as &quot;striprajna,&quot; which translates to &quot;woman-like knowledge;&quot; this can be interpreted as one who is well-versed in traditionally females roles. While Yajnavalkya and Katyayani lived in contented domesticity, Maitreyi studied metaphysics and engaged in theological dialogues with her husband in addition to &quot;making self-inquiries of introspection.&quot; In contrast to the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot;, the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot; states Maitreyi is a young beauty who is an Advaita scholar but never marries.

The figure of Yajnavalkya is considered by Scharfstein as one of the earliest philosophers in recorded history. Yajnavalkya is credited by Witzel for coining the term &quot;Advaita&quot; (non-duality of Atman and Brahman). The ideas attributed to him for renunciation of worldly attachments have been important to Hindu sannyasa traditions.

Later in his life, Yajnavalkya left both his wives to live as a renunciant.

==Scriptural references==
Yajnavalkya is associated with several major ancient texts in Sanskrit, namely the &quot;Shukla Yajurveda&quot;, the &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot;, the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot;, the &quot;Taittiriya Upanishad&quot;, the dharma sastra named &quot;Yājñavalkya Smṛti&quot;, &quot;Vriddha Yajnavalkya&quot;, and &quot;Brihad Yajnavalkya&quot;. He is also mentioned in the &quot;Mahabharata,&quot; Puranas, as well as in ancient Jainism texts such as the &quot;Isibhasiyaim&quot;. In the Jainism text Isibhasiyaim, the sage Yajnavalkya is also known as &quot;Jannavakka&quot;.

=== &quot;Taittiriya Upanishad&quot; ===
Yajnavalkya is referenced within the &quot;Taittiriya Upanishad&quot;. Once, the guru Vaisampayana got angry with Yajnavalkya, who was one of his leading disciples. He demanded that Yajnavalkya give back all of his knowledge he had learned from him. With such instructions, Yajnavalkya vomited all of the knowledge. The guru then instructed his other disciples to take the form of partridges (i.e., taittiriya birds) and consume what was regurgitated. This story is why the Upanishad was named the Taittiriya Upanishad. The story is meant to show Yajnavalkya’s genius. Yajnavalkya was also said to have taken the guru’s knowledge and to have added his own insight. Seeing such knowledge, the guru was pleased and instructed his other disciples to learn from Yajnavalkya. A student is encouraged to be active for a thirst of knowledge like Taittiriya birds through this metaphor. 

=== &quot;Brihadaranyanka Upanishad&quot; ===
The &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; is dated at c. 700 BCE. The &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; is known for highlighting Yajnavalkya’s magnetic personality, focusing on his self-confidence.

Yajnavalkya plays a central position within the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanisad&quot;, which is a part of the &quot;Sukla Yajur Veda&quot;. The scripture details one of the most famous debates in Hindu texts in the presence of King Janaka in Mithila, Videha, which is in the east of India, where Yajnavalkya defeats philosophers from all around the country.

In the first story of the &quot;Brihadaranyak Upanisad&quot;, King Janaka hosts a sacrifice known as Bahudakshina Yajna, where he is willing to donate one thousand cows with gold horns to the best brahmin called as Brahmistha. Yajnavalkya immediately orders his disciple Samasrava to take the cows to his home. This causes an uproar in the palace amongst the other sages, led by Asvala, who wondered why Yajnavalkya proclaimed himself as the greatest. Yajnavalkya responds saying that he does not claim himself to be the greatest &quot;Brahmistha&quot; and whoever the greatest Brahmistha is should indeed be honoured. Yajnavalkya says he merely just wanted the cows. This leads to a philosophical debate amongst the sages, in which Yajnavalkya defeats each opponent who faces him by rightly answering their questions. Some of the key participants of the debate include Asvala, Uddalaka Aruni, Bhujyu, Sakalya, Artabhaga, Ushasta, Kahola and others, many who are well known within other Hindu literature. 

Gargi later appears in two sections of the debate in sections 3.6 and 3.8 of the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanisad&quot;. Gargi was a female scholar and she was one of the nine gems of King Janaka’s court. In 3.6, Gargi successively asks about what is the support or cause of different elements in the world, setting up a hierarchical ordering of the world. Gargi finally asks about the support of Brahman. Yajnavalkya responds, &quot;Do not, O Gargi, question too much, lest your head should fall off. You are questioning too much about a deity whom we should not ask too much.&quot;

Yajnavalkya threatens Gargi not to ask what is beyond Brahman. Gargi becomes silent. Yajnavalkya intended to explain that one cannot question who is the support of that which is the support of everything. Yajnavalkya’s threat is not produced out coercion to halt the asking of complex questions, but to end a discussion that had become finite, which Gargi had not realized yet. 

In 3.8, Gargi asks a final series of questions to Yajnavalkya proclaiming that if he can answer these questions, no other brahmin could beat him in this debate. This time, it is seen that Gargi’s rhetoric has shifted; rather than asking questions impetuously or over-eagerly like that in 3.6, Gargi’s questioning becomes more pointed and focused at reaching the pinnacle of the debate through a final test. She first asks, &quot;That which is above the sky, that which is below earth, that which is between the sky and earth, and that which people call the past, present, and future – [what is the support of this all]?&quot; Yajnavalkya responds by saying that the support of this is space. Gargi then asks what is the support of space. Yajnavalkya responds by discussing the metaphysical element known as Akshar (&quot;Brihadaryanka Upanishad&quot; 3.8.8-9), or that which is imperishable. Yajnavalkya says, &quot;This imperishable, Gargi, is the seer but isn’t seen; is the hearer, but isn’t heard; is the thinker, but isn’t thought of; is the perceiver, but isn’t perceived. Other than this, there is no seer. Other than this, there is no hearer. Other than this, there is no thinker. Other than this, there is no perceiver.&quot; 

Gargi’s scholarship is depicted through the fact that she is the first person in the entire debate to discuss the concept of Brahman. The debate ends when Gargi, a female scholar, clearly asserts Yajnavalkya as the most superior of them all.

In the fourth chapter of the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanisad&quot;, Yajnavalkya decides to renounce and leave his family. At that time, Yajnavalkya’s wife, Maitreyi, inquires about the concept of the soul to Yajnavalkya. Maitreiyi, was also very wise and scholarly. She had once asked Yajnavalkya if she would become immortal with all the wealth in the world, in which Yajnavalkya responded with a denial. She then preaches, “&quot;What should I do with that by which I do not become immortal?&quot;

The &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanisad&quot; is one of the first texts to depict women in religious debate. Both Gargi and Maitreyi discuss the deepest spiritual topics of the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanisad&quot;, namely about Brahman and the atman, showing their knowledge and curiosity.

== Works ==

=== &quot;Sukla Yajur Veda&quot; ===
Yajnavalkya was the seer of who received the Shukla Yajurveda from the Divine. Thus, he is known as the founder of the Sukla Yujurveda tradition. Yajnavalkya himself mentions, “Anyone who desires to master yoga should know the Aranyaka that I received from the sun as well as the yoga treatise that I proclaimed.” (Yajnavalkya Smriti 3.110).

=== &quot;Yajnavalkya Smriti&quot; ===
The &quot;Yagnavalkya Smriti&quot; provides instructions to people of all walks of life, including brahmins. It is written as a discourse from Yajnavalka to his sagely disciples about the laws or dharmas of society. The scripture is broken into three sections discussing: (1) achara (i.e., behavior), (2) vyavahara (i.e., legal procedure), and (3) prayascita (i.e., atonement). In the second section, Yagnavalkya breaks down the entire court process into four steps: plaint, plea, evidence and verdict. In the third section, Yajnavalkya claims that through prayascita, the soul and the world are pleased. (&quot;Yajnavalkya Smriti&quot; 3.20). 

The &quot;Yajnavalkya Smriti&quot; is often comparable to a priorly written dharma sastra, the &quot;Manu Smriti&quot;. Both the Manu Smriti and &quot;Yajnavalkya Smriti&quot; are considered the ultimate sources of Hindu Law, however, Yagnavalkya’s smriti was considered more authoritative than that of Manu’s. Although both works are similar, Yajnavalkya places less emphasis on rigidity and more focus on practicality. Yajnavalkya’s smriti is also more precise and organized than that of Manu’s. The British also considered the &quot;Yajnavalkya Smriti&quot; the basis of what they called “the Hindu Law.” 

The &quot;Yajnavalkya Smriti&quot; became even more well-known through a commentary written on it by Vijnaneshvara called the &quot;Mitakshara&quot; in the mid-twelfth century.

=== &quot;Yoga Yajnavalkya&quot; ===
The &quot;Yoga Yajnavalkya&quot; is a commentary by Yajnavalkya on the knowledge of Yoga.

The actual author of &quot;Yoga Yajnavalkya&quot; text was probably someone who lived many centuries after the Vedic sage Yajnavalkya. Ian Whicher, a professor of Religion at the University of Manitoba, states that the author of &quot;Yoga Yajnavalkya&quot; may be an ancient Yajnavalkya, but this Yajnavalkya is not to be confused with the Vedic-era Yajnavalkya &quot;who is revered in Hinduism for &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot;&quot;.

According to Vishwanath Narayan Mandlik, these references to Yajnavalkya in other texts, in addition to the eponymous &quot;Yoga Yajnavalkya&quot;, may be two different sages with the same name.

== Ideas ==

===On karma and rebirth===
One of the early expositions of karma and rebirth theories appears in the discussions of Yajnavalkya.

Max Muller and Paul Deussen, in their respective translations, describe the Upanishad&#x27;s view of &quot;Soul, Self&quot; and &quot;free, liberated state of existence&quot; as, &quot;[Self] is imperishable, for he cannot perish; he is unattached, for he does not attach himself; unfettered, he does not suffer, he does not fail. He is beyond good and evil, and neither what he has done, nor what he has omitted to do, affects him. (...) He therefore who knows it [reached self-realization], becomes quiet, subdued, satisfied, patient, and collected. He sees self in Self, sees all as Self. Evil does not overcome him, he overcomes all evil. Evil does not burn him, he burns all evil. Free from evil, free from spots, free from doubt, he became Atman-Brâhmana; this is the Brahma-world, O King, thus spoke Yajnavalkya.&quot;

===On spiritual liberation===
The section 4.3 of the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; is attributed to Yajnavalkya. It has a dialogue between Janaka and Yajnavalkya exploring the nature of the Atman in different states of consciousness and existence, including wakefulness, dream, deep sleep, death, migration, and final liberation. It discusses the premises of moksha (liberation, freedom), and provides some of its most studied hymns. Paul Deussen calls it, &quot;unique in its richness and warmth of presentation&quot;, with profoundness that retains its full worth in modern times.

=== On the light of man ===
When asked by King Janaka,&quot;What is the light of man?&quot; he replies, &quot;The sun, O King; for, having the sun alone for his light, man sits, moves about, does his work, and returns.&quot; Then the king asks, &quot;When the sun sets, what is the light of man?&quot; He replies, &quot;The moon indeed is his light; for, having the moon alone for his light, man sits, moves about, does his work, and returns.&quot; Then the king asks, &quot;When the sun has set, O Yajnavalkya, and the moon has set, what is the light of man ?&quot; He replies, &quot;Fire indeed is his light; for, having fire alone for his light, man sits, moves about, does his work, and returns.&quot; Then the king asks, &quot;When the sun has set, O Yajnavalkya, and the moon has set, and the fire is gone out, what is then the light of man?&quot; He replies, &quot;Sound indeed is his light; for, having sound alone for his light, man sits, moves about, does his work, and returns. Therefore, O King, when one cannot see even one&#x27;s own hand, yet when a sound is raised, one goes towards it.&quot; Then the king asks, &quot;When the sun has set, O Yajnaavalkya, and the moon has set, and the fire is gone out, and the sound hushed, what is then the light of man?&quot; He replies, &quot;The Self indeed is his light; for, having the Self alone as his light, man sits, moves about, does his work, and returns.&quot;

=== On the self ===
He describes the self by a series of negations and says it is not, not (neti, neti) - not graspable, not destructible, not attached, not disturbed by anything good or bad done by himself. He then says, he who knows this truth remains &quot;controlled, at peace, patient and full of faith&quot; and &quot;everyone comes to be his self&quot; and &quot;he becomes the self of everyone&quot;

=== On dreams ===
Yajnavlkya believed that dreams are active projections of the self. To him, this is evidence that dreaming shares the creative nature of Reality in itself.

===On love and soul===
The Maitreyi-Yajnavalkya dialogue in the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; states that love is driven by &quot;love for oneself (&quot;ātman&quot;),&quot; and discusses the nature of Atman and Brahman and their unity, which forms the core of later Advaita philosophy. The dialogue has survived in two manuscript recensions from the Madhyamdina and Kanva Vedic schools. Although they have significant literary differences, they share the same philosophical theme.

This dialogue appears in several Hindu texts; the earliest is in chapter 2.4 – and modified in chapter 4.5 – of the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot;, one of the principal and oldest Upanishads. Adi Shankara, a scholar of the influential Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy, wrote in his &quot;Brihadaranyakopanishad bhashya&quot; that the purpose of the Maitreyi-Yajnavalkya dialogue in chapter 2.4 of the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; is to highlight the importance of the knowledge of Atman and Brahman, and to understand their oneness. According to Shankara, the dialogue suggests renunciation is prescribed in the &quot;Sruti&quot; (vedic texts of Hinduism), as a means to knowledge of the Brahman and Atman. He adds, that the pursuit of self-knowledge is considered important in the &quot;Sruti&quot; because the Maitreyi dialogue is repeated in chapter 4.5 as a &quot;logical finale&quot; to the discussion of Brahman in the Upanishad.

Concluding his dialogue on the &quot;inner self&quot;, or soul, Yajnavalkaya tells Maitreyi:
=== On dharma ===
In Yajnavalkya Smriti, Yajnavalkya emphasizes the plurality of dharma, drawing from multiple sources including the Vedas, recollections, righteous conduct, self-satisfaction, and desire rooted in right intention. He introduces the idea that fulfilling desires with the right intention is part of dharma, a departure from previous texts. Yajnavalkya emphasizes the significance of gift-giving (&quot;dana&quot;) and yoga in dharma, considering them central practices. He suggests that those who understand the self hold superior knowledge of dharma. Yajnavalkya categorizes dharma into three divisions, covering everyday life, royal conduct, and extraordinary circumstances. He recognizes that not all dharma originates from Vedic sources; some are derived from worldly customs or enforced by rulers.

<doc id="297209" wikidata="Q1938255" url="?curid=297209" title="Longshore drift">
<text>Longshore drift from longshore current is a geological process that consists of the transportation of sediments (clay, silt, pebbles, sand, shingle, shells) along a coast parallel to the shoreline, which is dependent on the angle of incoming wave direction. Oblique incoming wind squeezes water along the coast, generating a water current that moves parallel to the coast. Longshore drift is simply the sediment moved by the longshore current. This current and sediment movement occurs within the surf zone. The process is also known as littoral drift.

Beach sand is also moved on such oblique wind days, due to the swash and backwash of water on the beach. Breaking surf sends water up the coast (swash) at an oblique angle and gravity then drains the water straight downslope (backwash) perpendicular to the shoreline. Thus beach sand can move downbeach in a sawtooth fashion many tens of meters (yards) per day. This process is called &quot;beach drift&quot;, but some workers regard it as simply part of &quot;longshore drift&quot; because of the overall movement of sand parallel to the coast.

Longshore drift affects numerous sediment sizes as it works in slightly different ways depending on the sediment (e.g. the difference in long-shore drift of sediments from a sandy beach to that of sediments from a shingle beach). Sand is largely affected by the oscillatory force of breaking waves, the motion of sediment due to the impact of breaking waves and bed shear from long-shore current. Because shingle beaches are much steeper than sandy ones, plunging breakers are more likely to form, causing the majority of longshore transport to occur in the swash zone, due to a lack of an extended surf zone.

==Development of longshore drift theories==

The concept of longshore drift or transportation of sediment parallel to the shore by wave action has evolved considerably with time. Early observations related to sediment displacement can be traced back to coastal communities, but the formal scientific understanding of this started crystallizing in the 19th and early 20th centuries. While such early perceptions were imprecise, this evolution has encouraged a gradually more sophisticated understanding of the processes occurring at coastlines. Understanding of the coastline processes has continued to evolve through a succession of developments that began many years ago.

===Early observations===
Erosion of coasts and sediment transport was known in ancient times, mostly in those parts of the world where dramatic changes of shores take place. However, these early observations were largely anecdotal. Fishermen, sailors and locals would note that sand and gravel seemingly &quot;moved&quot; down the beaches; they didn&#x27;t fully understand the mechanics, however. Because of the general scientific knowledge, this was an interesting but somewhat misunderstood phenomenon.

===19th century: first scientific studies===
The systematic investigation into the coast processes, including those responsible for longshore drift, began in the mid-1800s when scientists tried to explain the processes of sediment movement along coasts. Among the first of such theories were those proposed by a French engineer, Jean-Baptiste Fourier, and a British geologist, Robert Mallet. They studied wave action and sediment transport; however, at that time, the term &quot;longshore drift&quot; was not yet coined. Instead, the principal focus was to understand the processes of waves and their impact on the resuspension and movement of sand and pebbles. The subject was of primary importance because it helped to explain the morphological features of any coast. However, while much is covered, the complete significance of such mechanisms was yet to be fully realised.

===20th century: longshore drift defined===
In the early years of the 20th century, longshore drift became much more refined in its explanation through oceanographers and coastal engineers. They realized that the angle of wave approach to the coast is of paramount importance to sediment transport. This then led to the development in the concept of &quot;longshore currents,&quot; which in turn transport sediment along the coast. These currents then became recognized as the main agent of longshore drift. An important concept which emerged during this generation was that of the &quot;drift-aligned&quot; beach. It explained how beaches get to form as a result of prevailing wind and wave directions and that on one side of the beach deposition takes place, while on the other side, erosion does. While the mechanics were becoming more apparent, the interrelationship of the forces in play still proved quite problematic for those trying to manage coasts.

==Overview==

===Longshore drift formulas===
Numerous calculations take into consideration the factors that produce longshore drift.
These formulations are:
#Bijker formula (1967, 1971)
#The Engelund and Hansen formula (1967)
#The Ackers and White formula (1973)
#The Bailard and Inman formula (1981)
#The Van Rijn formula (1984)
#The Watanabe formula (1992)

These formulas provide a different view of the processes that generate longshore drift. The most common factors taken into consideration in these formulas are:
*Suspended and bed load transport
*Waves, e.g., breaking and non-breaking
*The shear exerted by waves or the flow associated with waves.

===Features of shoreline change===
Longshore drift plays a large role in the evolution of a shoreline, as if there is a slight change of sediment supply, wind direction, or any other coastal influence longshore drift can change dramatically, affecting the formation and evolution of a beach system or profile. These changes do not occur due to one factor within the coastal system, in fact there are numerous alterations that can occur within the coastal system that may affect the distribution and impact of longshore drift. 
Some of these are:

# Geological changes, e.g. erosion, backshore changes and emergence of headlands.
# Change in hydrodynamic forces, e.g. change in wave diffraction in headland and offshore bank environments.
# Change to hydrodynamic influences, e.g. the influence of new tidal inlets and deltas on drift.
# Alterations of the sediment budget, e.g. switch of shorelines from drift to swash alignment, exhaustion of sediment sources.
# The intervention of humans, e.g. cliff protection, groynes, detached breakwaters.

===The sediment budget===
The sediment budget takes into consideration sediment sources and sinks within a system. This sediment can come from any source with examples of sources and sinks consisting of: 
* Rivers
* Lagoons
* Eroding land sources
* Artificial sources e.g. nourishment
* Artificial sinks e.g. mining/extraction
* Offshore transport
* Deposition of sediment on shore
* Gullies through the land 
This sediment then enters the coastal system and is transported by longshore drift. A good example of the sediment budget and longshore drift working together in the coastal system is inlet ebb-tidal shoals, which store sand that has been transported by long-shore transport. As well as storing sand these systems may also transfer or by pass sand into other beach systems, therefore inlet ebb-tidal (shoal) systems provide good sources and sinks for the sediment budget.

Sediment deposition throughout a shoreline profile conforms to the null point hypothesis; where gravitational and hydraulic forces determine the settling velocity of grains in a seaward fining sediment distribution. Long shore occurs in a 90 to 80 degree backwash so it would be presented as a right angle with the wave line.

==Natural features==
This section consists of features of longshore drift that occur on a coast where long-shore drift occurs uninterrupted by man-made structures.

===Spits===

Spits are formed when longshore drift travels past a point (e.g. river mouth or re-entrant) where the dominant drift direction and shoreline do not veer in the same direction. As well as dominant drift direction, spits are affected by the strength of wave-driven current, wave angle and the height of incoming waves.

Spits are landforms that have two important features, with the first feature being the region at the up-drift end or proximal end (Hart et al., 2008). The proximal end is constantly attached to land (unless breached) and may form a slight “barrier” between the sea and an estuary or lagoon (called &quot;peresyp&quot; in the Russian tradition of geomorphology). The second important spit feature is the down-drift end or distal end, which is detached from land and in some cases, may take a complex hook-shape or curve, due to the influence of varying wave directions.

As an example, the New Brighton spit in Canterbury, New Zealand, was created by longshore drift of sediment from the Waimakariri River to the north. This spit system is currently in equilibrium but undergoes alternate phases of deposition and erosion.

===Barriers===
Barrier systems are attached to the land at both the proximal and distal ends and are generally widest at the down-drift end. These barrier systems may enclose an estuary or lagoon system, like that of Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora enclosed by the Kaitorete Spit or hapua which form at river-coast interface such as at the mouth of the Rakaia River.

The Kaitorete Spit in Canterbury, New Zealand, is a barrier/spit system (which generally falls under the definition of barrier, as both ends of the landform are attached to land, but has been named a spit) that has existed below Banks Peninsula for the last 8,000 years. This system has undergone numerous changes and fluctuations due to avulsion of the Waimakariri River (which now flows to the north of Banks Peninsula), erosion and phases of open marine conditions. The system underwent further changes  500 years Before Present, when longshore drift from the eastern end of the “spit” system created the barrier, which has been retained due to ongoing longshore transport.

===Tidal inlets===
The majority of tidal inlets on longshore drift shores accumulate sediment in flood and ebb shoals. Ebb-deltas may become stunted on highly exposed shores and in smaller spaces, whereas flood deltas are likely to increase in size when space is available in a bay or lagoon system. Tidal inlets can act as sinks and sources for large amounts of material, which therefore impacts on adjacent parts of the coastline.

The structuring of tidal inlets is also important for longshore drift: if an inlet is unstructured, sediment may by-pass the inlet and form bars at the down-drift part of the coast. This may also depend on the inlet size, delta morphology, sediment rate and by-passing mechanism. Channel location variance and amount may also influence the impact of longshore drift on a tidal inlet.

Arcachon lagoon in southwest France is an example of a tidal inlet system, which provides large sources and sinks for longshore drift sediments. The impact of longshore drift sediments on this inlet system is highly influenced by the variation in the number of lagoon entrances and the location of these entrances. Any change in these factors can cause severe down-drift erosion or down-drift accretion of large swash bars.

==Human influences==
This section consists of long-shore drift features that occur unnaturally and in some cases (e.g. groynes, detached breakwaters) have been constructed to enhance the effects of longshore drift on the coastline but in other cases have a negative impact on long-shore drift (ports and harbours).

===Groynes===

Groynes are shore protection structures, placed at equal intervals along the coastline in order to stop coastal erosion and generally cross the intertidal zone. Due to this, groyne structures are usually used on shores with low net and high annual longshore drift in order to retain the sediments lost in storm surges and further down the coast.

There are numerous variations to groyne designs with the three most common designs consisting of:
# zig-zag groynes, which dissipate the destructive flows that form in wave-induced currents or in breaking waves.
# T-head groynes, which reduce wave height through wave diffraction.
# ‘Y’ head, a fish-tail groyne system.

===Artificial headlands===
Artificial headlands are also shore protection structures, which are created in order to provide a certain amount of protection to beaches or bays. Although the creation of headlands involves accretion of sediments on the up-drift side of the headland and moderate erosion of the down-drift end of the headland, this is undertaken in order to design a stabilised system that allows material to accumulate in beaches further along the shore.

Artificial headlands can occur due to natural accumulation or also through artificial nourishment.

===Detached breakwaters===
Detached breakwaters are shore protection structures, created to build up sandy material in order to accommodate drawdown in storm conditions. In order to accommodate drawdown in storm conditions detached breakwaters have no connection to the shoreline, which lets currents and sediment pass between the breakwater and the shore. This then forms a region of reduced wave energy, which encourages the deposition of sand on the lee side of the structure.

Detached breakwaters are generally used in the same way as groynes, to build up the volume of material between the coast and the breakwater structure in order to accommodate storm surges.

===Ports and harbours===
The creation of ports and harbours throughout the world can seriously impact on the natural course of longshore drift. Not only do ports and harbours pose a threat to longshore drift in the short term, they also pose a threat to shoreline evolution. The major influence, which the creation of a port or harbour can have on longshore drift, is the alteration of sedimentation patterns, which in turn may lead to accretion and/or erosion of a beach or coastal system.

As an example, the creation of a port in Timaru, New Zealand in the late 19th century led to a significant change in the longshore drift along the South Canterbury coastline. Instead of longshore drift transporting sediment north up the coast towards the Waimataitai lagoon, the creation of the port blocked the drift of these (coarse) sediments and instead caused them to accrete to the south of the port at South beach in Timaru. The accretion of this sediment to the south, therefore meant a lack of sediment being deposited on the coast near the Waimataitai lagoon (to the north of the port), which led to the loss of the barrier enclosing the lagoon in the 1930s and then shortly after, the loss of the lagoon itself. As with the Waimataitai lagoon, the Washdyke Lagoon, which currently lies to the north of the Timaru port, is undergoing erosion and may eventually breach, causing loss of another lagoon environment.

<text>Anthony Wood (17 December 1632 – 28 November 1695), who styled himself Anthony à Wood in his later writings, was an English antiquary. He was responsible for a celebrated &quot;Hist. and Antiq. of the Universitie of Oxon&quot;.

He meticulously researched and documented the history of Oxford, producing significant works such as the &quot;Historia et Antiquitates Universitatis Oxoniensis&quot; and the &quot;Athenae Oxonienses&quot;. Despite criticism for errors and suspected biases, his works remain invaluable. Wood had free access to university records, consulted with notable scholars, and faced controversy, including banishment from the University of Oxford. Unmarried, he led a life devoted to scholarship and antiquarian pursuits.

==Early life==
Anthony Wood was born in Oxford on 17 December 1632, as the fourth son of Thomas Wood (1581–1643), BCL of Oxford, and his second wife, Mary (1602–1667), daughter of Robert Pettie and Penelope Taverner. His father, who was born in Islington and attended Broadgates Hall, Oxford, was &#x27;fairly wealthy&#x27;, having married well and invested in property in Oxford. His mother was a granddaughter of Richard Taverner (died 1575) of Woodeaton, Clerk of the Signet to Edward VI, and Mary Harcourt, one of the eight daughters of Sir John Harcourt (died 19 February 1566) of Stanton Harcourt.

Wood was sent to New College School in 1641, and at the age of twelve was removed to the free Lord Williams&#x27;s School at Thame, where his studies were interrupted by Civil War skirmishes. He was then placed under the tuition of his brother Edward (1627–1655), of Trinity College, Oxford, and, as he tells us, &quot;while he continued in this condition his mother would alwaies be soliciting him to be an apprentice which he could never endure to heare of&quot;. He was entered at Merton College in 1647, and made postmaster, a type of scholar at Merton.

In 1652, Wood amused himself with ploughing and bell-ringing. &quot;Having had from his most tender years an extraordinary ravishing delight in music&quot;, he began to teach himself the violin and took his BA examinations. He engaged a music-master and obtained permission to use the Bodleian Library, &quot;which he took to be the happiness of his life&quot;. He received the MA degree in 1655, and in the following year published a volume of sermons by his late brother Edward.

==Career as an antiquary==
Wood began, systematically, to copy monumental inscriptions and to search for antiquities in the city and neighbourhood. He went through the Christ Church, Oxford registers, &quot;at this time being resolved to set himself to the study of antiquities.&quot; John Wallis, the keeper, allowed him free access to the university registers in 1660; &quot;here he layd the foundation of that book which was fourteen years afterwards published, viz. &quot;Hist. et Antiq. Univ. Oxon&quot;&quot;. He also came to know the Oxford collections of Brian Twyne to which he was greatly indebted, and those of the assiduous antiquary Ralph Sheldon.

He steadily investigated the muniments of all the colleges, and in 1667 made his first journey to London, where he visited William Dugdale, who introduced him into the Cottonian Library, and William Prynne showed him the same civility for the Tower records.

On 22 October 1669, he was sent for by the delegates of the press, &quot;that whereas he had taken a great deal of paines in writing the &quot;Hist. and Antiq. of the Universitie of Oxon&quot;, they would for his paines give him an 100 li. for his copie, conditionally, that he would suffer the book to be translated into Latine&quot;. He accepted the offer and set to work to prepare his English manuscript for the translators, Richard Peers and Richard Reeve, both appointed by John Fell, Dean of Christ Church, who undertook the expense of printing. In 1674, appeared &quot;Historia, et antiquitates Universitatis Oxoniensis&quot;, handsomely reprinted &quot;e Theatro Sheldoniano&quot; in two folio volumes, the first devoted to the university in general and the second to the colleges. 

Copies were widely distributed, and university and author received much praise; in the following year the magnificent series of illustrations linked to the history were separately published as David Loggan&#x27;s &quot;Oxonia Illustrata&quot;, which contained instructions on where to insert the plates in Wood&#x27;s history; copies of the history &#x27;with the cuts&#x27; became a special gift object for noble visitors to the university.

Wood was disappointed with the Latin translation, and Bishop Barlow told a correspondent that &quot;not only the Latine but the history itself is in many things ridiculously false&quot;.

Despite the carping, Wood&#x27;s meticulously researched text, with extensive footnotes to original sources, remains a worthy successor to Dugdale&#x27;s work which had been his inspiration.

In 1678 the university registers which had been in Wood&#x27;s custody for eighteen years were removed, as it was feared that he would be implicated in the Popish Plot. To relieve himself from suspicion he took the Oath of Supremacy. During this time he had been gradually completing his great work, which was produced by a London publisher in 1691–1692, 2 vols. folio, &quot;Athenae Oxonienses: an Exact History of all the Writers and Bishops who have had their Education in the University of Oxford from 1500 to 1690&quot;, to which are added the &quot;Fasti&quot;, or &quot;Annals&quot; for the said time. Wood contemplated publishing a third volume of the &quot;Athenae&quot;, printed in the Netherlands. The third appeared subsequently as &quot;a new edition, with additions, and a continuation by Philip Bliss&quot; (1813–1820, 4 vols. 4to). The Ecclesiastical History Society proposed to bring out a fourth edition, which stopped at the &quot;Life&quot;, ed. by Bliss (1848, 8vo; see Cent. Mag., N.S., xxix. 135, 268). Bliss&#x27;s interleaved copy is in the Bodleian.

On 29 July 1693, Wood was condemned and fined in the vice-chancellor&#x27;s court for certain libels against the late Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon. He was punished by being banished from the university until he recanted, the offending pages being burnt. The proceedings were printed in a volume of &quot;Miscellanies&quot;, published by Edmund Curll in 1714. Wood was attacked by Bishop Burnet in &quot;A letter to the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry&quot; (1693), and defended by his nephew Thomas Wood, in a &quot;Vindication of the Historiographer&quot;, to which is added the &quot;Historiographer&#x27;s Answer&quot; (1693), reproduced in the subsequent editions of the &quot;Athenae&quot;. The nephew also defended his uncle in &quot;An Appendix to the Life of Bishop Seth Ward&quot; (1697). After a short illness Anthony Wood died, and was buried in the outer chapel of St John Baptist (Merton College), in Oxford, where he had superintended the digging of his own grave only a few days before.

He was described as &quot;a very strong lusty man,&quot; of uncouth manners and appearance, not so deaf as he pretended, of reserved and temperate habits, not avaricious and a despiser of honours. He received neither office nor reward from the university which owed so much to his labours. He never married, and led a life of self-denial, entirely devoted to antiquarian research. Bell-ringing and music were his chief relaxations. His literary style is poor, and his taste and judgment are frequently warped by prejudice, but his two great works and unpublished collections form a priceless source of information on Oxford and her worthies. He was always suspected of being a Roman Catholic, and invariably treated Jacobites and Papists better than Dissenters in the &quot;Athenae&quot;, but he died in communion with the Church of England.

==Legacy==
Wood&#x27;s original manuscript (purchased by the Bodleian in 1846) was first published by John Gutch as &quot;The History and Antiquities of the Colleges and Halls in the University of Oxford&quot;, with a continuation (1786–1790, 2 vols. 4to), and &quot;The History and Antiquities of the University of Oxford&quot; (1792–1796, 3 vols. 410), with a portrait of Wood. To these can be added &quot;The Antient and Present State of the City of Oxford, chiefly collected by A. à Wood, with additions by the Rev. Sir J. Peshall&quot; (1773, 4to; the text is garbled and the editing very imperfect). The &quot;Survey of the Antiquities of the City of Oxford, composed in 1661–66 by Anthony Wood&quot;, edited by Andrew Clark, was issued by the Oxford Historical Society (1889–1899, 3 vols. 8vo). &quot;Modius Salium, a Collection of Pieces of Humour&quot; was published at Oxford in 1751, 12mo. Some letters between John Aubrey and Wood were published in the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (3rd ser., ix. x. xi.).

Wood bequeathed his library (127 manuscripts and 970 printed books) to the Ashmolean Museum, and the keeper, William Huddesford, printed a catalogue of the manuscripts in 1761. In 1858 the whole collection was transferred to the Bodleian Library, where 25 volumes of Wood&#x27;s manuscripts had been since 1690. Many of the original papers from which the &quot;Athenae&quot; was written, as well as several large volumes of Wood&#x27;s correspondence and all his diaries, are preserved in the Bodleian.

==In fiction==
A fictionalised version of Anthony Wood is one of four narrators in Iain Pears&#x27; 1998 novel &quot;An Instance of the Fingerpost&quot;, which is set in the early 1660s.

== Works ==
Wood regularly wrote in his diaries and in other writings. With this, he wrote several accounts of life in Oxford in the mid-17th century. Below are his works:

* &quot;History of Oxford down to 1640&quot; (–1674)
* &quot;Athenae Oxoniensis&quot; (1680–)

<text>Edmund Curll (&quot;c.&quot; 1675 – 11 December 1747) was an English bookseller and publisher. His name has become synonymous, through the attacks on him by Alexander Pope, with unscrupulous publication and publicity. Curll rose from poverty to wealth through his publishing, and he did this by approaching book printing in a mercenary and unscrupulous manner. By cashing in on scandals, publishing pornography, offering up patent medicine, using all publicity as good publicity, he managed a small empire of printing houses. He would publish high and low quality writing alike, so long as it sold. He was born in the West Country, and his late and incomplete recollections (in &quot;The Curliad&quot;) say that his father was a tradesman. He was an apprentice to a London bookseller in 1698 when he began his career.

==Early hucksterism==

At the end of his seven-year apprenticeship, he began selling books at auction. His master, Richard Smith, went bankrupt in 1708, and Curll took over his shop at that point. His early practice was to work in conjunction with other booksellers to write, publish, and sell pamphlets and books and to exploit any furore to produce &quot;accounts&quot; and arguments. For example, in 1712 the witch trial of Jane Wenham had the public&#x27;s interest, and one partner wrote a pamphlet exonerating her, while another condemned her, and both pamphlets were sold at all three shops. He also manufactured a set group of newspaper quarrels between the various &quot;authors&quot; for and against Mrs. Wenham to get free advertising.

As a bookseller, Curll&#x27;s stock was always exceptionally eclectic, and as a publisher, he produced inexpensive books on inexpensive paper. Most of his books sold for one or two shillings, putting them within reach of tradesmen, apprentices, and servants. He carried and published erotic literature and mixed it with serious Christian calls to prayer, &quot;medical&quot; texts, and the like. He also published Whig political tracts. One of his earliest productions was John Dunton&#x27;s &quot;The Athenian Spy&quot;, but he also had titles like &quot;The Way of a Man with a Maid&quot; and &quot;The Devout Christian&#x27;s Companion&quot;. Curll also sold medical cures themselves, and he was unscrupulous in promoting them. In 1708, he published &quot;The Charitable Surgeon&quot;, a feigned book of medical advice on syphilis cures from a pretended physician of public spirit. It explained that one John Spinke&#x27;s cure of mercury was devoid of worth and that the only efficacious cure came from Edmund Curll&#x27;s own shop. Dr. Spinke wrote a pamphlet in reply, and characteristically Curll wrote a reply to that and, to create a scandal, made the outlandish claim that Spinke was ignorant and offered five pounds if Spinke could come to Curll&#x27;s shop and translate five lines of Latin. Spinke did so and used the money to buy some of Curll&#x27;s &quot;cure&quot;, which he had analyzed. In the end, Curll&#x27;s &quot;cure&quot; was also mercury. Curll kept publishing his &quot;Charitable Surgeon&quot;, however, and expanded it with &quot;A new method of curing, without internal medicines, that degree of the venereal disease, called a gonorrhea, or clap.&quot;

In 1712, Curll&#x27;s shop was so successful that he opened a branch in Tunbridge Wells, and he moved to a bigger store on Fleet Street. He began to write his own pamphlets around this time. In 1712 he collaborated with John Morphew, a Tory, to cash in on the excitement over the Henry Sacheverell controversy. After their collaboration, Curll was able to hire away one of Morphew&#x27;s hack writers.

==Piracy==
One feature of Curll&#x27;s career, and the one that most cemented his reputation through the ages, was the unauthorized publication of works originally produced by another house, often against the author&#x27;s wishes. Usually, Curll stayed just across the legal line from piracy, but not always. In 1707, Curll announced in the newspapers that he was going to publish &quot;Poems on Several Occasions&quot; by Matthew Prior. Jacob Tonson had the sole rights to Prior&#x27;s works, but Curll published anyway. In 1716, Curll &quot;again&quot; announced his intent to publish Matthew Prior&#x27;s works, and Prior himself wrote letters of protest to the newspapers. The quarrel with Tonson, and Prior&#x27;s objections, only served as publicity, however, and Curll published the book anyway. In 1710, he printed up Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;Meditation Upon a Broomstick.&quot; He also that year wrote a &quot;key&quot; to other Swift works, and in 1713 he produced a key to &quot;A Tale of a Tub.&quot; Swift was angry at Curll for revealing his authorship of the works (as Swift was ascending in the Church of England), but he was also amused at the dullness of Curll&#x27;s explication of his works. He wrote to Alexander Pope that dunces like Curll were tools for a satirist, that they were valuable in their way. Having gotten into the habit of sapping Swift, Curll did not relent, especially after Swift incorporated Curll&#x27;s notes (without permission) into the apparatus of &quot;A Tale of a Tub.&quot; In 1726, Curll produced a wildly inaccurate &quot;key&quot; to Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. Another alleged case of unauthorized publication came with the poet Edward Young, who sent a poem to Curll for publication, with a letter of solicitation. When the poem was published in 1717, Young took out an ad claiming that the poem and letter were forgeries. In fact, the poem was in praise of a politician who had lost place, and Young&#x27;s letter was authentic.

His connection with the anonymously published &quot;Court Poems&quot; in 1716 led to the long quarrel with Alexander Pope. Curll got three anonymous poems, by Pope, John Gay, and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Pope wrote to Curll warning him not to publish the poems, which only confirmed for Curll the authorship. He published them. In response, Pope and Bernard Lintot, Pope&#x27;s publisher, met with Curll at the Swan tavern. Pope and Lintot seemed resigned and worried only for John Gay&#x27;s prospects. However, they had filled Curll&#x27;s glass with an emetic, causing him, when he went home, to go into convulsions of vomiting. Pope published two pamphlet accounts of the incident and informed the public (a la Swift&#x27;s &quot;Bickerstaff Papers&quot;) that Curll was dead. Curll seized upon the publicity for his own purposes, as well. He published and advertised John Oldmixon&#x27;s &quot;The Catholick Poet&quot; and John Dennis&#x27;s &quot;The True Character of Mr Pope and his Writings.&quot; He reprinted these in 1716, when the atmosphere of England was highly charged after the failure of the Jacobite rising of 1715.

The next step in the Pope/Curll battle came in 1716, when Curll got a bawdy version of the first Psalm written years earlier by Pope. He published it in &quot;folio&quot; and announced that he would be the future publisher of all of Pope&#x27;s works. Also in that year, Curll was sent to jail for publishing an account of the trial of the Earl of Winton. No sooner was he out than he produced a biography of Dr. Robert South, former head of Westminster School. He had printed the eulogy for Dr. South by the current school head, as well. He was invited to the school and expected to be honored for the work he had done on behalf of the memory of the school&#x27;s masters. Instead, the students forced him to his knees by beatings and forced him to beg for an apology. They then wrapped him in a blanket and began beating him with sticks and tossing him in the air. Samuel Wesley, a student at the school and older brother to John Wesley, wrote a mock-heroic poem on the blanket incident. Curll suspected that Pope and his friends were somehow responsible for his treatment, and he began to employ the &quot;phantom poet.&quot; He published a poem called &quot;The Petticoat&quot; by &quot;J. Gay.&quot; This poet was Francis Chute, who used the pseudonym &quot;Joseph Gay.&quot; To siphon off sales of John Gay&#x27;s poems and to wound Pope and his friends, Curll used this phantom twice more.

==Biographies, obscenity and &quot;Curlicisms&quot;==
He was notorious for commissioning hack-written biographies of famous people as soon as they died and for publishing them without regard for inaccuracies and inventions. Perhaps the reference to Curll most often repeated by posterity is John Arbuthnot&#x27;s quip that Curll&#x27;s biographies had become &quot;one of the new terrors of death&quot; (quoted in Robert Carruthers, &quot;The Poetical Works of Pope&quot;, 1853, vol. 1, ch. 3). Curll&#x27;s entire goal was to be the first to the shops with a biography and not in any way to be the best or most accurate account. Thus, his method was to announce that a biography was about to be published and ask the public to contribute any memories, letters, or speeches of the deceased. He would then include these (and sometimes nothing else) in the &quot;biography.&quot; He had no care at all for accuracy and would accept accounts from enemies as quickly as friends. When contributions failed, he would hire an author to invent material. In 1717 alone, he produced biographies of Bishop Burnet and Elias Ashmole. He would later produce, exactly as Swift predicted in his 1731 &quot;Lines on the Death of Dr. Swift&quot;, a hack biography of Swift. Arbuthnot&#x27;s terror was apt, for there was virtually no recourse against Curll&#x27;s press. In 1721, he published a biography of the Duke of Buckingham. He was summoned to the House of Lords for trial, and Lords made a new law making it illegal to publish anything about or by a lord without permission.

Curll became notorious for his indecent publications, so much so that &quot;Curlicism&quot; was regarded as a synonym for literary indecency. In 1718, Curll published &quot;Eunuchism Display&#x27;d&quot;, and Daniel Defoe attacked it as pornography, calling it a &quot;Curlicism.&quot; Curll capitalized on the charge by writing &quot;Curlicism Display&#x27;d&quot; as a defense. The pamphlet was, however, a listing of books in Curll&#x27;s shop, so Curll turned the entire thing into an advertisement. In 1723, he published &quot;A Treatise of the Use of Flogging in Venereal Affairs&quot;, which was a translation of &quot;De Usu Flagrorum&quot;. To the book, Curll added a sexual frontispiece and advertised other &quot;medical&quot; books. In 1724, he published &quot;Venus in the Cloister&quot;, a translation of a mildly erotic French title of the previous century that argued that it is the church, and not Christ, that forbids sexual exploration. That year, an anonymous complaint to the Lords mentioned these two titles specifically as obscenities. As with previous scandals, Curll attempted to turn it to profit by publishing &quot;The Humble Representation of Edmund Curll&quot; and rushing forward a new edition of &quot;Venus in the Cloister.&quot; He was arrested in March and held until July. The courts determined that there was no actual obscenity law, so they prosecuted him for libel. Curll published an apology and promised to quit publishing, but the apology was an ad for two new titles. While Curll was in prison, he met John Ker, who wished his memoirs published. The work contained state secrets from the reign of Queen Anne, so Curll was nervous. He wrote to Robert Walpole for permission. Getting no answer, he treated silence as assent and published the book. The last volume of the memoirs was done by Edmund&#x27;s son, Henry Curll, and both Henry and Edmund were arrested. They spent fourteen months in prison (to February 1728) and were fined for the &quot;Nun in her Smock&quot; and &quot;The use of flogging&quot;, and sentenced to an hour in the pillory for publishing Ker&#x27;s memoirs. Curll wrote and published a broadsheet for his pillory day saying that publishing Ker&#x27;s memoirs had been done out of loyalty to the old queen only, and the crowd therefore did not beat him. Instead, they cheered Curll and carried him away on their shoulders.

==&quot;The Dunciad&quot;==

Pope and Curll tangled again in 1726, when he published some of Pope&#x27;s letters without authorization. Pope avenged himself by having Curll figure very prominently in the 1728 &quot;Dunciad.&quot; In fact, no figure, including the &quot;King of Dunces&quot; Lewis Theobald (nor, later, Colley Cibber) is ridiculed as consistently and viciously in &quot;Dunciad&quot; as Edmund Curll. Curll&#x27;s response was to print a pirate edition, then to produce a &quot;Key&quot; to the poem to explain all the people Pope attacked, and then to publish reply poems that were attacks on Pope personally. &quot;The Popiad&quot;, written possibly by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, &quot;The Female Dunciad&quot;, and &quot;The Twickenham Hotch-Potch&quot; all came out in 1728 as answers. In 1729, Pope&#x27;s &quot;Dunciad Variorum&quot; took further, prose swipes at Curll, and Curll produced &quot;The Curliad: a Hypercritic upon the Dunciad Variorum.&quot; It contained an autobiography, a defense against charges of obscenity (explaining that the flogging text had been meant as a cure for impotence), and a defense of his actions with Pope.

Later in 1729, Curll set out to publish a volume of William Congreve. John Arbuthnot complained in the press of Curll&#x27;s action, so Curll renamed his shop &quot;Congreve&#x27;s Head&quot; and put up a bust of Congreve to spite Arbuthnot and Congreve&#x27;s friends. In 1731 he moved shops to Burleigh Street and advertised an upcoming life of Pope, saying, &quot;Nothing shall be wanting but his (universally desired) Death.&quot; In response to his call for materials, a person known as &quot;P.T.&quot; offered Curll some Pope letters. The letters, however, were fakes, and the entire offer had been a set-up by Pope, who published a corrected version of his letters in 1735. Curll moved his shop again in that year and called it &quot;Pope&#x27;s Head&quot; and sold under the sign of Pope. Two years later, he published five volumes of Pope&#x27;s letters. In 1741, Pope finally prevailed against Curll in the courts. A court ruled that letters affix copyright to the author, although a recipient of a letter has no copyright status.

== Merryland ==
In his last years Curll published a series of &quot;Merryland&quot; books which constitute a major contribution to the somewhat peculiar genre of English seventeenth and eighteenth century erotic fiction in which the female body (and sometimes the male) was described in terms of topographical metaphor. The earliest work in this genre seems to be &quot;Erotopolis: The Present State of Bettyland&quot; (1684) probably by Charles Cotton. This was included, in abbreviated form, in Curll&#x27;s &quot;The Potent Ally: or Succours from Merryland&quot; (1741). Other works published by Curll include &quot; A New Description of Merryland. Containing a Topographical, Geographical and Natural History of that Country&quot; (1740) by Thomas Stretzer (of whom nothing is known), &quot;Merryland Displayed&quot; (1741) and set of maps entitled &quot;A Compleat Set of Charts of the Coasts of Merryland&quot; (1745).

In Curll&#x27;s last years, he continued to publish &quot;Curlicisms&quot; mixed with serious and valuable works. His will indicates that his son had died without issue and that there was no family except his wife. Curll died in London on 11 December 1747.

<text>Boase Massimi Pollitt (BMP) was a British advertising agency which operated between 1968 and 2004 before being renamed as DDB London. It was purchased in 1989 by the US marketing services conglomerate Omnicom. Its lineage can be directly traced to today&#x27;s agency operation Adam &amp; Eve DDB London.

==History==
BMP was founded in October 1968 by Martin Boase, Gabe Massimi, Stanley Pollitt and seven other executives who had previously worked at Pritchard Wood. The group struck out on their own after a failed attempt to buy the Pritchard Wood operation from its parent.

Massimi left the firm in 1971. Stanley Pollitt is co-credited with inventing the job discipline of account planning at Pritchard Wood. He died following a heart attack in 1979, an event which dealt a blow to the agency&#x27;s momentum. 

In 1977, the French advertising holding group Havas of France paid £1.5m for a 50% stake in BMP. It later sold its holding back to BMP.

In 1983, BMP floated on the London Stock Exchange valued at £16 million. After a hostile bid by the French company BDDP, BMP was bought in 1989 for £125 million ($200 million) by DDB Worldwide, part of Omnicom Group, the giant American marketing services holding company and thence became known as BMP DDB.

In January 2004 the company name was officially changed to DDB London, in line with the DDB network&#x27;s decision to rebrand agencies it had acquired worldwide.

==Clients and reputation==
Cadbury-Schweppes moved to the new agency at its foundation. The firm had been a client of Pritchard Wood, and BMP&#x27;s first campaign was for Cadbury&#x27;s Smash, a powdered mashed-potato mix. Other early BMP campaigns included the Cresta bear (&quot;it&#x27;s frothy, man&quot;), Hofmeister bear, the Humphreys, and John Smith&#x27;s Arkwright - all the work of creative director John Webster (1934-2006).

The company had a strong relationship with the Labour Party, dating from the early 1970s when it placed press advertisements for the TUC, attacking the then-Conservative government&#x27;s Industrial Relations Bill. BMP created the advertising for the Labour Party in several successive general election campaigns. Chris Powell, BMP DDB Needham&#x27;s chief executive until 2004, is the brother of Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair&#x27;s Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister, and several people who served in the Labour Party&#x27;s Shadow Communications Agency came from BMP.

A poll in 2000 that selected the UK&#x27;s top 100 television commercials found that 16 were produced by BMP DDB, of which 11 were created by John Webster. An example was the BMP advertisement for the Barclaycard credit card, featuring an accident-prone card user, later expanded into the character of Johnny English played by Rowan Atkinson.
