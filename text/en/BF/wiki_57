<text>The Teen Titans are a superhero team appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, frequently in eponymous monthly series. As the group&#x27;s name indicates, the members are teenage superheroes, many of whom have acted as sidekicks to DC&#x27;s premier superheroes in the Justice League. The original team later becomes known as the Titans when the members age out of their teenage years, while the Teen Titans name is continued by subsequent generations of young heroes. First appearing in 1964 in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #54, the team was formed by Kid Flash (Wally West), Robin (Dick Grayson), and Aqualad (Garth) before adopting the name Teen Titans in issue 60 with the addition of Wonder Girl (Donna Troy) to their ranks.

Over the decades, DC has cancelled and relaunched &quot;Teen Titans&quot; many times, and a variety of characters have been featured heroes in its pages. Significant early additions to the initial quartet of Titans were Speedy (Roy Harper), Aquagirl (Tula), Bumblebee (Karen Beecher), Hawk (Hank Hall), Dove (Don Hall), Harlequin (Duela Dent), and three non-costumed heroes: boxer Mal Duncan, psychic Lilith, and caveman Gnarrk. The series would not become a genuine hit until its 1980s revival as &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; under writer Marv Wolfman and artist George Pérez. This run depicted the original Titans now as young adults and introduced new characters Cyborg (Victor Stone), Starfire (Koriand&#x27;r), and Raven (Rachel Roth), as well as the former Doom Patrol member Beast Boy (Garfield Logan) under his new alias of Changeling, who would all become enduring fan favorites. A high point for the series both critically and commercially was its &quot;The Judas Contract&quot; storyline, in which the Teen Titans are betrayed by their teammate Terra (Tara Markov).

The 1990s featured a Teen Titans team composed entirely of new members before the previous members returned in the series &quot;Titans&quot;, which ran from the late 1990s to the early 2000s. Subsequent stories in the 2000s introduced a radically different Teen Titans team made up of newer DC Comics sidekicks such as Robin III (Tim Drake), Wonder Girl II (Cassie Sandsmark), and Impulse / Kid Flash II (Bart Allen), as well as Superboy (Kon-El), some of whom had previously featured in the similar title &quot;Young Justice&quot;. Later prominent additions from this era included Miss Martian (M&#x27;gann M&#x27;orzz), Ravager (Rose Wilson), Supergirl (Kara Zor-El), Kid Devil, Blue Beetle III (Jaime Reyes), and Solstice (Kiran Singh). Concurrently, DC also published &quot;Titans&quot;, which featured some of the original and 1980s members now as adults, led by Dick Grayson in his adult persona of Nightwing. Important storylines for the 2000s era of Teen Titans included “Titans Tomorrow” and the company-wide crossover &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;. 

In the 2010s, &quot;The New 52&quot; reboot in 2011 added new characters Bunker (Miguel Jose Barragan) and Skitter (Celine Patterson) to the 2000s roster, although the volume proved commercially and critically disappointing for DC, leading to the return of the original Titans in 2016’s &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; era, alongside a new cast of Teen Titans led by Robin V (Damian Wayne) alongside Aqualad II (Jackson Hyde) and Kid Flash III (Wallace &quot;Ace&quot; West), later joined by Red Arrow (Emiko Queen). Later storylines saw the elder Titans establish a Teen Titans Academy for young heroes and serving as the DC Universe’s main heroes during &quot;Dark Crisis&quot; when the Justice League were declared dead. 

The Teen Titans have been adapted to other media numerous times, such as in the animated television series &quot;Teen Titans&quot; and &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot;, and the live-action television series &quot;Titans&quot;. Within DC Comics, the Teen Titans have been an influential group of characters taking prominent roles in all of the publisher&#x27;s major company-wide crossover stories. Many villains who face the Titans have since taken on a larger role within the publisher&#x27;s fictional universe, such as the assassin Deathstroke, the demon Trigon, and the evil organization H.I.V.E..

==Publication history==

===Original incarnation===
Robin (Dick Grayson), Kid Flash (Wally West) and Aqualad (Garth) team up to defeat a weather-controlling villain known as Mister Twister in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #54 (July 1964) by writer Bob Haney and artist Bruno Premiani. They appeared under the name &quot;Teen Titans&quot; in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #60 (July 1965), joined by Wonder Woman&#x27;s younger sister Wonder Girl (Donna Troy). After being featured in &quot;Showcase&quot; #59 (December 1965), the Teen Titans were spun off into their own series with &quot;Teen Titans&quot; #1 by Haney and artist Nick Cardy.

The series&#x27; original premise had the Teen Titans helping teenagers and answering calls. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that Haney &quot;took some ribbing for the writing style that described the Teen Titans as &#x27;the Cool Quartet&#x27; or &#x27;the Fab Foursome&#x27;. The attempt to reach the youth culture then embracing performers like The Beatles and Bob Dylan impressed some observers.&quot; Green Arrow&#x27;s sidekick Speedy makes guest appearances before officially joining the team in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; #19. Aqualad takes a leave of absence from the group in the same issue, but makes several later guest appearances, sometimes with girlfriend Aquagirl. Neal Adams was called upon to rewrite and redraw a &quot;Teen Titans&quot; story which had been written by Len Wein and Marv Wolfman. The story, titled &quot;Titans Fit the Battle of Jericho!&quot;, would have introduced DC&#x27;s first African American superhero, but was rejected by publisher Carmine Infantino. The revised story appeared in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; #20 (March–April 1969). Wolfman and Gil Kane created an origin for Wonder Girl in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; #22 (July–Aug. 1969) and introduced her new costume. Psychic Lilith Clay and Mal Duncan also join the group. Beast Boy of the Doom Patrol makes a guest appearance seeking membership, but was rejected as too young at the time; existing heroes Hawk and Dove, a duo of teenaged superpowered brothers, appear in issue #21; and time-displaced caveman Gnarrk aids the team in two issues.

The series explored events such as inner-city racial tension and protests against the Vietnam War. One storyline beginning in issue #25 (February 1970) saw the Titans deal with the accidental death of a peace activist, leading them to reconsider their methods. As a result, the Teen Titans briefly abandoned their identities to work as ordinary civilians, but the effort was quickly abandoned. Along the way, Aqualad left the series and the character of Mr. Jupiter, who was Lilith&#x27;s mentor and employer, was introduced. He financially backed the Titans for a brief period. The series was canceled with #43 (January–February 1973).

===1970s revival===
The series resumed with issue #44 (November 1976). The stories included the introductions of African American superheroine Bumblebee and former supervillainess-turned-superheroine Harlequin in issue #48 and the introduction of the &quot;Teen Titans West&quot; team in issues #50–52 consisting of a number of other teen heroes, including Bat-Girl (Betty Kane) and Golden Eagle. The revival was short-lived and the series was cancelled as of issue #53 (February 1978), which featured an origin story. At the end, the heroes realized that, now that they were in their early 20s, they had outgrown the name the &quot;Teen&quot; Titans. In the last panel, without speaking, they all go their separate ways.

The title appeared again in 1999 for &quot;Giant Teen Titans Annual&quot; #1 (1967) (), a one-shot special that reprinted selected Silver Age stories in the 1960s-style &quot;80-Page Giant&quot; format.

===&quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; (1980–1996) ===
&quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #26 (October 1980) introduced a new team of Titans, anchored by Robin, Wonder Girl, and Kid Flash and soon followed by The New Teen Titans #1 (November 1980). The series, created by writer Marv Wolfman and artist George Pérez, re-introduced Beast Boy as Changeling and introduced the machine man Cyborg, the alien Starfire, and the dark empath Raven. Raven, an expert manipulator, forms the group to fight her demonic father Trigon the Terrible and the team remains together.

Wolfman and Pérez&#x27;s working relationship quickly evolved to the point where they were plotting the series jointly. Wolfman recalled that &quot;once George moved to the same town I lived in, only five blocks or so away, we usually got together for lunch and would work out a story over the next few hours. In many cases I would then go home and write up a plot based on it, or sometimes George would take the verbal plotting we did and take it from there.&quot;

The team&#x27;s adversaries included Deathstroke the Terminator, a mercenary who takes a contract to kill the Titans to fulfill a job his son had been unable to complete. This led to perhaps the most notable Titans storyline of the era. 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Judas Contract&quot;, in &quot;Tales of the Teen Titans&quot; #42–44 and &quot;Tales of the Teen Titans Annual&quot; #3, featured a psychopathic girl named Terra with the power to manipulate Earth and all Earth-related materials. She infiltrates the Titans in order to destroy them. &quot;The Judas Contract&quot; won the Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide Fan Award for &quot;Favorite Comic Book Story&quot; of 1984 and was later reprinted as a standalone trade paperback in 1988. Robin adopts the identity of Nightwing, while Wally West gives up his Kid Flash persona and quits the Titans. It also featured the introduction of a new member in Jericho, Deathstroke&#x27;s other son.

Other notable &quot;New Teen Titans&quot; stories included &quot;A Day in the Lives...&quot;, presenting a day in the team members&#x27; personal lives; &quot;Who is Donna Troy?&quot;, depicting Robin investigating Wonder Girl&#x27;s origins; and &quot;We Are Gathered Here Today...&quot;, telling the story of Wonder Girl&#x27;s wedding. &quot;Tales of the New Teen Titans&quot;, a four-part limited series by Wolfman and Pérez, was published in 1982, detailing the back-stories of Cyborg, Raven, Changeling, and Starfire. Wolfman wrote a series of &quot;New Teen Titans&quot; drug awareness comic books which were published in cooperation with The President&#x27;s Drug Awareness Campaign in 1983–1984. The first was pencilled by Pérez and sponsored by the Keebler Company, the second was illustrated by Ross Andru and underwritten by the American Soft Drink Industry, and the third was drawn by Adrian Gonzales and financed by IBM.

====&quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 2)====
The &quot;New Teen Titans&quot; relaunched with a new #1 issue in August 1984 as part of a new initiative at DC informally referred to as &quot;hardcover/softcover&quot;. &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; along with &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; and &quot;Batman and the Outsiders&quot; were the first and only titles included in this program. The same stories were published twice, first in a more expensive edition with higher-quality printing and paper distributed exclusively to comic book specialty stores, then republished a year later in the original format, distributed to newsstands. The title was renamed &quot;Tales of the Teen Titans&quot; with issue #41, while a new concurrently published series named &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 2) launched with a new #1 following the release of &quot;Tales of the Teen Titans&quot; #44 and &quot;Annual&quot; #3, the conclusion of the &quot;Judas Contract&quot; storyline. After both titles ran new stories for one year, with &quot;Tales of the Teen Titans&quot; #45–58 taking place prior to the events of &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 2) #1, and a filler issue reprinting a digest-only story and the original preview story from &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #26, the series began reprinting the first 31 issues of the &quot;hardcover&quot; series (sans several back-up stories focusing on Tamaran that ran in &quot;New Teen Titans&quot; #14–18), the first &quot;Annual&quot;, and the lead story from the second &quot;Annual&quot;, before being cancelled with issue #91.

Issue #1 of &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 2) created controversy when Grayson and Starfire were depicted in bed together, although it had been established for some time that they were a couple. The initial storyline, &quot;The Terror of Trigon&quot;, featured Raven&#x27;s demon father attempting to take over Earth and Raven&#x27;s own struggle to remain good despite Trigon&#x27;s demonic blood inside her. Pérez left the series after issue #5. José Luis García-López followed Pérez as the title&#x27;s artist and Eduardo Barreto followed García-López. Paul Levitz scripted or fully wrote issues #28–33 to give Wolfman time to catch up on his writing after he fell behind by taking on &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; and &quot;History of the DC Universe&quot;.

====Name changed to &quot;The New Titans&quot;====
Pérez temporarily returned with issue #50, when the series took the name &quot;The New Titans&quot; without the &quot;Teen&quot; prefix, as the characters were no longer teenagers.

Issue #50 told a new origin story for Wonder Girl, her link to Wonder Woman having been severed due to retcons created in the aftermath of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. Pérez sketched through issues #55, 57 and 60, while only providing layouts for issues #58–59 and 61, with artist Tom Grummett finishing pencils and Bob McLeod as inker. Pérez remained as cover inker to issues #62–67. He would return for the series finale #130 (Feb. 1996) providing cover art. Issues #60 and #61 were part of a five-part crossover with Batman, &quot;A Lonely Place of Dying&quot; and along with issue #65, featured the debut of Tim Drake as the third Robin.

The brief return of Perez and the addition of Tom Grummett failed to move sales for the book, which were starting to decline. Furthermore, the addition of Danny Chase (a teenage psychic) drew negative fan response due to his abusive attitude towards the rest of the team. Believing Wolfman had grown stagnant, DC assigned Wolfman a new editor, Jonathan Peterson, and gave Peterson authority to override Wolfman over the direction of the book.

With Peterson controlling the book&#x27;s direction, the series was rapidly overhauled. The Wildebeest, a villain who used proxies and surrogates to hide his true identity while vexing the Titans, was expanded to a full army of villains called the Wildebeest Society and revealed to be a front for the remaining members of the supervillain group the H.I.V.E. The group fell under the control of Titan Jericho, who in turn was being possessed by the corrupted souls of Azarath. During the &quot;Titans Hunt&quot; storyline that followed (#71–84), Cyborg was destroyed and rebuilt, along with being lobotomized; Danny Chase and Arella (Raven&#x27;s mother) were killed and resurrected as the &quot;gestalt&quot; being Phantasm (an identity created by Chase early in the series); while Raven, Jericho, and Golden Eagle were killed. New character Pantha (based on plans for a female Wildcat character Wolfman conceived in the mid-&#x27;80s) joined the team, along with Deathstroke and Red Star. Deathstroke was also given his own solo book and the team received its first crossover tie-in since &quot;Millennium&quot;, with &quot;The New Titans&quot; #81 being part of the &quot;War of the Gods&quot; storyline.

Peterson also saw the launch of &quot;Team Titans&quot;, which featured a new genetically modified (and heroic) doppelganger of Terra and Donna Troy, who was depowered in the &quot;Total Chaos&quot; crossover. Peterson left the book before &quot;Total Chaos&quot; concluded, leaving Wolfman to deal with the fallout from Peterson&#x27;s editorially mandated storylines, including the final break-up between Starfire and Nightwing as a couple, the return of Speedy as Arsenal, and the resurrection of Raven as a villain.

Following &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot;, the series saw a revamp: Nightwing was removed from the series by Batman editorial and a roster of new young heroes such as Damage and Impulse were inserted into the team to try and renew interest, along with Team Titan survivors Mirage and Terra II. New Green Lantern Kyle Rayner was also brought onto the title and given a prominent romance with Donna Troy, whose marriage with Terry Long had collapsed in the pages of &quot;Team Titans&quot; before the book&#x27;s cancellation. Sales saw a collapse and despite several crossovers with other books (&quot;Damage&quot;, &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, &quot;Darkstars&quot;, and &quot;Deathstroke&quot;), the series was cancelled with issue #130. The series finale saw the return of Blackfire as an ally, as the Titans purged Raven of evil once again to prevent Raven and the revived Citadel Empire from reconquering the Vega star system.

====&quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; and the &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;====

&quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; was widely thought of as DC&#x27;s answer to the increasingly popular &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; from Marvel Comics, as both series featured all-new members and depicted young heroes from disparate backgrounds whose internal conflicts were as integral to the series as was their combat against villains. The two teams met in the 1982 crossover one-shot entitled &quot;Apokolips... Now&quot;, which teamed Darkseid, Deathstroke and Dark Phoenix against both teams. The story was written by Chris Claremont and drawn by Walt Simonson and Terry Austin.

====&quot;New Titans: Games&quot;====
In 1989, Marv Wolfman and George Perez began planning a prestige format special, their first work together on the franchise since Perez left after &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 2) #5. The project was put on hold when it was decided instead to have Perez return to the main book as artist and for their first project back together to be &quot;Who Is Wonder Girl?&quot; instead.

Over the course of 1989 and 1990, George Perez and Marv Wolfman continued to work on &quot;Games&quot; with over half the project being completed. But the ascension of Jonathan Peterson as editor of the series, and Perez moving off of New Titans in order to work on &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; for Marvel led to the book being shelved. 

In the early &#x27;00s, Marv Wolfman and George Perez approached DC about completing the book as a stand-alone graphic novel. The book was completed in 2010 and published in 2011.

The plot had the New Titans be forced by King Faraday to go after a mysterious mastermind who forces his victims to play deadly &quot;games&quot; for his amusement. In the interim, Wolfman had rewritten the plot (most notably, changing the original ending where Nightwing personally executes the main villain of the series after his &quot;games&quot; result in the death of longtime Titan ally Sarah Simms and the maiming of Danny Chase) though retained several key details (the death of Simms and Chase losing his hands) and several additional twists (the introduction of a previously unknown sibling of Raven, the revelation that the main villain was a schizophrenic King Faraday, and the destruction of Titan Tower) that make it impossible to fit into canon, reducing it to an alternate universe side story in Teen Titans lore.

===&quot;Teen Titans Spotlight&quot;===
Due to fan backlash over the hardcover/softcover move to the direct market with the main title, a new newsstand Titans book was launched in August 1986 called &quot;Teen Titans Spotlight&quot;. The series was an anthology series and featured individual members of the Titans in solo stories, often spanning multiple issues. The series also focused on former members of the group (such as Hawk and Aqualad) and the Brotherhood of Evil, detailing the formation of the second version of the group. As the move to the direct market effectively limited &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; ability to be part of company-wide crossovers, two issues of &quot;Spotlight&quot; tied into the &quot;Millennium&quot; crossover event, with the second issue being the coda for the event.

The series failed to catch on and was cancelled in 1988, along with &quot;Tales of the Teen Titans&quot;.

===&quot;Team Titans&quot;===

The Team Titans were one of 100 groups sent back through time to prevent the birth of Lord Chaos, the son of Donna Troy and Terry Long. Their mission was to kill the pregnant Troy before she could give birth. Mirage, Killowat, Redwing, Terra, Nightrider, Prestor Jon and Battalion made up the team.

===&quot;Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 2) (1996–1998)===

&quot;Teen Titans&quot; was written and penciled by Dan Jurgens. It began in 1996 with a new #1 (October 1996), with Pérez as inker for the first 15 issues. Atom, who had become a teenager following the events of &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, leads the brand-new team (of Prysm, Joto, Risk and Argent). Arsenal became a mentor about halfway through and Captain Marvel Junior/ CM3 joins the team. The series ended in September 1998.

A contest was held in the letters pages to determine who would join the team. Robin (Tim Drake), won the vote, but editors on the Batman titles banned his appearance, forcing Jurgens to use Captain Marvel Jr. instead. His inclusion failed to boost sales and the series was then cancelled.

===&quot;Titans&quot; (1999–2003)===
The team returned in a three-issue miniseries, &quot;JLA/Titans: The Technis Imperative&quot;, featuring nearly every Titan and showcasing the return of Cyborg. This led into &quot;Titans&quot;, written by Devin K. Grayson, starting with &quot;Titans Secret Files and Origins&quot; #1 (March 1999).

This team consisted of Nightwing, Troia, Arsenal, Tempest, the Flash, Starfire, Cyborg, Changeling, Damage and Argent. One new member, Jesse Quick, joined. This team lasted until issue #50 (2002). The West Coast branch of the team, Titans L.A., appeared once, in the pages of &quot;Titans Secret Files and Origins&quot; #2.

Between &quot;Teen Titans&quot; and &quot;Titans&quot;, a new generation of young heroes formed a team in &quot;Young Justice&quot;, consisting of Superboy, Robin, Impulse, Wonder Girl, Secret, and Arrowette. The two series concluded with the three-issue miniseries &quot;Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day&quot;, which led to two new series: &quot;Teen Titans&quot; and &quot;Outsiders&quot;.

===&quot;Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 3) (2003–2011) and &quot;Outsiders&quot; (vol. 3) (2003–2007)===

Writer Geoff Johns&#x27; &quot;Teen Titans&quot; series began in 2003, after a three issue miniseries entitled &quot;Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day&quot;, which saw Lilith&#x27;s death and Donna Troy sent to another world after seemingly dying, along with the disbanding of the 1998–2002 Titans roster and the Young Justice team. The relaunch came on the heels of the debut of the &quot;Teen Titans&quot; cartoon on Cartoon Network and reflected DC Comics chief executive Dan DiDio&#x27;s desire to rehabilitate the Titans as one of DC&#x27;s top franchises. Launched at the same time was a companion series, a revived version of &quot;The Outsiders&quot; which featured Nightwing and Arsenal, along with several other Titans members (Captain Marvel Jr. and Starfire).

The series featured several of the main teenage heroes from the Young Justice roster (Robin, Superboy, Wonder Girl, Impulse) and Starfire, Cyborg and Changeling (now rebranded Beast Boy to reflect the cartoon). Raven later returned to the team, reborn in a new teenage body while Jericho was brought back, having escaped death by possessing and laying dormant inside his father Deathstroke&#x27;s mind.

The series renewed interest in the Titans, but drew sharp complaints due to shifts in the personalities of the various Young Justice characters. Most notably, the decision to have Impulse rebrand himself Kid Flash and the decision to Jettison his happy-go-lucky person in favor of a more serious personality. The series, under Geoff Johns, also dramatically retconned Superboy&#x27;s origin with the revelation that he was a hybrid clone based on the combined DNA of Superman and Lex Luthor (a possibility Johns had first suggested in a fan letter published in the Superboy comic book several years before he was employed by DC).

Under Geoff Johns, the Teen Titans were front and center during the build-up and events of the Infinite Crisis crossover. During the lead-in of the crossover, Donna Troy came back in a four-part crossover miniseries with The Outsiders called &quot;The Return of Donna Troy&quot; while Superboy and Cassie Sandsmark became a couple. During Infinite Crisis, Superboy was killed by his evil doppelganger Superboy Prime, Cyborg was severely damaged by cosmic forces unleashed by Alexander Luthor Jr., Starfire was lost in space with several other heroes, while Kid Flash became lost in the Speed Force, re-emerging in the Flash uniform and having aged to adulthood after a failed attempt to stop Superboy Prime.

====&quot;One Year Later&quot; and the post-Geoff Johns Titans====

Following the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, the Teen Titans fell into a state of chaos. Wonder Girl quit the group to join a cult she believed could resurrect Superboy, while Robin took a leave of absence to travel the globe with Batman and Nightwing. Changeling and Raven attempted to keep the Titans going, resulting in a massive open call membership drive that saw a large number of heroes come and join the roster, which was anchored by Beast Boy and Raven. New members include Miss Martian, Kid Devil, Zachary Zatara, Ravager, Bombshell (who like Terra I, was a traitor working for Deathstroke), Young Frankenstein, and Osiris.

During this period, Osiris was driven from the team due to a smear campaign launched by Amanda Waller after she manipulated him into killing a super-villain. The smear campaign against Osiris, along with the war between Black Adam and Intergang, led to Black Adam declaring war on the world. In the ensuing series of battles against the super-hero community, the Titans fought and lost a bloody battle with the villain, culminating in the deaths of Terra II and Young Frankenstein. The deaths led to Beast Boy resigning from the team to join the Doom Patrol along with Herald and Bumblebee, while Raven took a leave of absence to purge Jericho of the dark forces that were corrupting him.

Robin and Wonder Girl eventually rejoined the Titans (now located in San Francisco, California) and helped foil Bombshell&#x27;s plan to frame Miss Martian as Deathstroke&#x27;s latest mole in the team and allowed Raven to cleanse Jericho of the Azarathian corruption that had turned him evil. Geoff John&#x27;s final arc on the series would introduce a new villainous &quot;Titans East&quot; team, led by Deathstroke and Batgirl Cassandra Cain.

Soon after, events related to the &quot;Countdown&quot; story arc impacted the Titans. Duela Dent and Bart Allen are killed; Cyborg leaves, and Supergirl joins and Blue Beetle is invited to train, but the two eventually leave, with the members joining the Justice League of America and Justice League International, respectively. The Titans fight the future, evil adult versions of the group (Titans Tomorrow) and Clock King and the Terror Titans, who are part of Darkseid&#x27;s underground fight club for metahumans.

After the &quot;Batman R.I.P&quot; storyline, Robin leaves and Wonder Girl leads the team. Red Devil loses his powers after Brother Blood absorbs them. Miss Martian returns with several teen heroes liberated from the Dark Side Club. A new team is formed: Wonder Girl, Blue Beetle and the now-powerless Red Devil are joined by Kid Eternity and Static, with the new Aquagirl, Miss Martian and a reformed Bombshell signing up.

In the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; crossover, several dead Titans are resurrected as members of the Black Lantern Corps. In the &quot;Titans: Blackest Night&quot; miniseries, an emergency team consisting of Donna Troy, Cyborg, Wonder Girl, Starfire, Beast Boy, Kid Flash and the new Hawk and Dove, is formed to defend the Tower. In the ensuing battle, Hawk is killed after her predecessor Hank Hall tears her heart out. At the end of the &quot;Blackest Knight&quot; crossover, Hank Hall is resurrected and resumes his partnership with Dove. In the main series, Ravager and Jericho fight their father Deathstroke and the dead members of the Wilson family, resurrected as Black Lanterns.

During this time, several back-up stories begin to run in the series: one called &quot;The Coven&quot;, starring Black Alice, Zachary Zatara and Traci Thirteen and later, one starring Ravager.

Later storylines involve the corruption of Wonder Girl at the hands of various factors (designed to address complaints about the character&#x27;s abusive attitudes towards her teammates post-&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;), Kid Devil is killed in battle, while Kid Eternity is revealed to have been beaten to death by the Calculator after being kidnapped by him.

J. T. Krul became the writer with issue #88 and penciler Nicola Scott became the book&#x27;s artist. The issue&#x27;s teaser shows a line-up of Superboy, Wonder Girl, Raven, Beast Boy, Kid Flash and Ravager. The Titans undergo this roster change in issue #87, the final issue before Krul&#x27;s run. Following a mission to an alternate dimension to rescue Raven, the team splits. Bombshell and Aquagirl are missing in action, Miss Martian is in a coma and she and a powerless Static leave with Cyborg to go to Cadmus Labs to find a way to restore his powers.

Damian Wayne, the current Robin, is announced as a new team member, officially joining in #89. A series for Static was announced. In January 2011, new Titan Solstice debuted in the January 2011 &quot;Wonder Girl&quot; one-shot. She entered the main &quot;Teen Titans&quot; title following the crossover with the &quot;Red Robin&quot; series. During the crossover, Tim asks the Titans for help in tracking down the Calculator after he tries to kill his friend, Tamara Fox. Tim rejoins the team as Red Robin (rather than Robin) but Cassie would remain the leader. Following this, Damian quits the team.

The book concluded with a three-part storyline spanning issues #98–100, which saw Superboy-Prime return to destroy the team. A large group of former Titans arrived and the series ultimately ended with Prime trapped in the Source Wall, seemingly for all eternity. The remainder of the issue consisted of pieces of artwork showcasing the various Teen Titans who appeared in that incarnation of the title, contributed by various DC artists.

===&quot;Titans&quot; (vol. 2) (2008–2011)===
A second ongoing Teen Titans series, titled &quot;Titans&quot;, launched in April 2008 with a cover date of June 2008, written by Judd Winick. The first issue was drawn by Ian Churchill and Norm Rapmund and the second was by Joe Benitez and Victor Llamas. The opening storyline follows the events of the &quot;Teen Titans East Special&quot; one-shot released in November 2007, revealing that Cyborg&#x27;s team survived the attack, except Power Boy, dead after being impaled. The team&#x27;s new line up consists of former &quot;New Teen Titans&quot; Nightwing, The Flash (Wally West), Donna Troy, Beast Boy, Raven, Cyborg, Red Arrow and Starfire.

In the series&#x27; first story, Trigon makes a series of attacks on every member, former or current, of the Teen Titans and Trigon has &quot;another child&quot; that, unlike Raven, will assist him in his attack. After reclaiming Titans Island and establishing a headquarters on the East River, Cyborg sets out to create an East Coast Titans team. During a training session, the team was massacred by an unseen force. Though Cyborg survives, Titans&#x27; members past and present are attacked by demonic entities across the globe. Raven, sensing Trigon&#x27;s presence once again, calls upon her former Titans allies to defeat her fiendish father.

After rescuing several Titans and questioning Trigon himself, the Titans learn that Trigon&#x27;s three children have prepared his second invasion for him. Raven&#x27;s three grown half brothers – Jacob, Jared and Jesse are responsible. Working as a team, the Titans thwart the Sons of Trigon and stop Trigon&#x27;s invasion plan. Following this adventure, Raven chooses her adopted family over her biological family, Red Arrow decided to join his former teammates (although both he and Flash retain their JLA membership) and the Titans were back together as a team.

Following this, the team settles at Titans Tower (the New York base), to recover from the events. While Dick and Kory attempt to make a decision on where their relationship will lead, Raven and Beast Boy go out on a &quot;not-a-date&quot;. During this, Raven reveals that since she faced her brothers, she has begun to feel as if she is losing control and slipping back under her father&#x27;s influence. Although Beast Boy rejects the idea, he is unexpectedly blind-sided as Raven gives in to her darker side, under the influence of her half-brother&#x27;s coaxing. Using her teleporting powers, she and the sons of Trigon vanish, leaving a distraught Beast Boy to warn the others. Using a gemstone that carries Raven&#x27;s pure essence within it, the Titans free Raven of her father&#x27;s evil. As a result, Raven leaves each Titan with an amulet that can be used to cleanse any evil influence from her body.

Following this, Jericho arrives, frantically asking for help to separate himself from Match&#x27;s body. Jericho has turned renegade again and fights the Titans. He is under the control of the numerous people that he has taken command of over the years. Nightwing resigns from the Titans due to .

====&quot;Brightest Day: Titans – Villains for Hire&quot;====
A Comic-Con announcement stated that Cyborg, Donna Troy and Starfire were leaving the team to pursue the JLA. Red Arrow, with his daughter Lian, has already relocated and is no longer involved with the Titans, but he got a spotlight in issue #23 after what happens to him in &quot;Justice League: Cry for Justice&quot; #5. After a series of spotlight issues, &quot;Final Crisis Aftermath: INK&quot; writer-artist creative team Eric Wallace and Fabrizio Fiorentino took over. Deathstroke took over the team with the Tattooed Man and Cheshire.

One of the new members included Carla Monetti a.k.a. Cinder, a young redheaded woman with the ability to manipulate fire. Osiris, a member during the &quot;One Year Later&quot; gap, who had been brought back to life after the events of &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, returned as a member. The final issue of the limited series, &quot;Justice League: The Rise of Arsenal&quot; ended with an advertisement stating that Arsenal&#x27;s storyline would continue.

The team debuted in the one-shot issue &quot;Titans: Villains for Hire&quot;, where they are hired to assassinate Ryan Choi (the Atom) in his home in Ivy Town. The issue quickly became the subject of controversy due to Choi&#x27;s violent death. Allegations of racial insensitivity dogged DC over the decision to kill off a relatively high-profile Asian character.

Following the one-shot, in the team&#x27;s inaugural storyline they were hired to assassinate Lex Luthor following the events of &quot;War of the Supermen&quot;. This is revealed to be a ruse set up by Luthor and Deathstroke to draw out the real assassin, a shape-shifter named &quot;Facade&quot;, who had apparently killed and impersonated a woman on Luthor&#x27;s security detail.

Following several adventures, the Titans are confronted by Ray Palmer and the Justice League for their hand in Ryan&#x27;s murder. The Titans are nearly defeated, but manage to escape thanks to an intervention from the newly resurrected Isis. Following the battle with the Justice League, &quot;Titans&quot; concluded with a two-part storyline which saw Jericho&#x27;s return. The series ended with Arsenal battling Slade for control of the team and the Titans ultimately disbanding and Arsenal taking Jericho under his wing, leaving Slade alone once again.

===&quot;The New 52&quot; (2011–2016)===
DC Comics relaunched &quot;Teen Titans&quot; with issue #1 (cover dated November 2011) as part of DC&#x27;s New 52 event, written by Scott Lobdell with former &quot;Justice League&quot; artist Brett Booth providing interiors. The relaunch was controversial, because it was originally designed as a direct continuation of the previous Teen Titans series before Dan DiDio declared that all previous incarnations of the Titans never existed; this in spite of the fact that early issues of the 2011 series (as well as &quot;Red Hood and the Outlaws&quot; and &quot;Batwoman&quot;) made explicit mention of the previous Teen Titans teams.

The new team is formed by Tim Drake, now rebranded as &quot;Red Robin&quot; to protect teenage heroes from a villain known as Harvest and his organization &quot;N.O.W.H.E.R.E.&quot; A running theme for the 2011–2014 series was Harvest kidnapping young heroes for experimentation and enslavement as part of the villainous scheme for world domination.

The 2011–2014 series featured several crossovers, &quot;The Culling&quot;, which had the team meet the Legion of Super-Heroes, as well as &quot;Death of the Family&quot;, which focused upon a meeting of Batgirl, Red Hood and the Outlaws, and the Titans, as the Joker kidnapped Red Hood and Red Robin. The 2012 &quot;Zero Month&quot; issue provided the &quot;New 52&quot; origin of Tim Drake, recasting him as a young computer hacker who was adopted by Batman to protect him from retaliation by the Penguin.

The 2011–2014 series and Scott Lodbell&#x27;s writing drew negative reviews, though the Lodbell created character Bunker was positively received by fans. Criticism included the meandering Harvest/N.O.W.H.E.R.E storyline, an arc that revealed Kid Flash (Bart Allen) as a futuristic fundamentalist Christian terrorist hiding in the 20th century, as well as the elimination of the franchise&#x27;s lore. The character of Raven and Trigon was originally embargoed by Lobdell, but the characters were brought back due to fan demand. The 2011 series also spawned a short-lived spin-off, &quot;The Ravagers&quot;, which ran for 10 issues and featured Beast Boy, Terra and Caitlyn Fairchild of &quot;Gen13&quot; in major roles.

The series was relaunched in July with a new issue #1 with Will Pfeifer as writer. The series continued with the characteristics of the main characters, but ignored the events of the Ravagers spin-off, presenting Beast Boy both green and in line with his animated series characteristics. The series also added an African American version of the super-heroine Power Girl to the roster.

Due to the backlash against the removal of the previous incarnations of the Titans (and the ripple effect it had upon characters such as Nightwing and Donna Troy), DC launched a new miniseries called &quot;Titans Hunt&quot;, which restored the original 1960s version of the Titans to canon. The series states that all memory of the original Titans was erased by Lilith to protect the team from Mr. Twister. It also alludes to further reality alterations to the DC Universe; these are then picked up on in the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; initiative, beginning a week after &quot;Titans Hunt&quot;, which restores Wally West to canon, along with various aspects of the Pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; continuity.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot; (2016–2020)===

The June 2016 &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; relaunch established two Titans teams: the Titans, with Nightwing, The Flash (Wally West), Lilith, Arsenal, Donna Troy, the Bumblebee and Tempest; and the Teen Titans, consisting of Damian Wayne as Robin, Wallace West as Kid Flash, Jackson Hyde as Aqualad, Beast Boy, Starfire and Raven. &quot;Titans&quot; writer Dan Abnett confirmed in an interview with &quot;Newsarama&quot; that &quot;Titans&quot; characters the Hawk and the Dove, the Herald, Gnarrk and others would be appearing in the new series as well. After the Lazarus Contract event, Wallace West is fired from the Teen Titans and joins Defiance, Deathstroke&#x27;s version of the Titans. However, Wallace returns to the Teen Titans in issue #14. In &quot;Super Sons&quot; #7, Superboy (Jonathan Samuel Kent) acts as a temporary member.

As part of the &quot;New Justice&quot; banner for DC Comics, both teams underwent changes in their roster, with Nightwing, Donna Troy, Raven, Steel (Natasha Irons), Beast Boy, Miss Martian and eventually Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner), and Robin, Kid Flash, Red Arrow (Emiko Queen), Crush (Lobo&#x27;s daughter), Djinn, and Roundhouse for the Teen Titans. The &quot;Titans&quot; series ended its run at issue #36 (April 2019), while &quot;Teen Titans&quot; is ended its run in November 2020 at issue #47.

===&quot;Infinite Frontier&quot; (2021–2022)===
In the &quot;Teen Titans Academy&quot; series, the adult generation of Titans (Nightwing, Starfire, Donna Troy, Beast Boy, Cyborg, and Raven) serve as faculty of a new superhero academy designed to mentor the heroes of tomorrow. Its upperclassmen are the active Teen Titans squad (Bunker, Roundhouse, Crush, Kid Flash III, Red Arrow II, and Jakeem Thunder), while its new students include three bat-themed Gotham residents (the brawny Megabat, techy Bratgirl, and bat-like metahuman Chupacabra) collectively known as the Bat Pack; the established superhero Billy Batson; paraplegic speedster Bolt; EMP-generating Brick Pettirosso; nonbinary ragdoll and apprentice to Doctor Fate, Stitch; Raven&#x27;s star pupil, Dane; tubular shapeshifter Marvin &quot;Tooby&quot; Murakami; ice-wielder Summer Zahid; simian superhero Gorilla Gregg, nephew of Grodd; Hero dial wielder Miguel Montez; green-prehensile-haired Tress; and the amnesiac, super strong, Matt Price. As the new students and faculty of the academy attempt to establish their new school, they are plagued by appearances of someone assuming the costume of Red X, once worn by Dick Grayson and another mysterious copycat. 

As time goes on, the team discover that Dane is the half-demon antichrist, and under the alias Nevermore (reflecting his similarities to Raven), is destined to bring about the apocalypse. In the first story arc&#x27;s conclusion, the mysterious third Red X is revealed to be Brick, operating under the false belief that Dick Grayson is his father; he was manipulated by the second Red X, who bears a longstanding grudge against Grayson. Dane and Brick&#x27;s attacks on the Academy cause the structure to collapse, but the students manage to prevent all but minimal casualties. Matt Price fires optic blasts in the final confrontation, indicating to onlookers that he might be Kryptonian, but Grayson deduces he must be something else, as the blasts give off no heat, more closely resembling Darkseid&#x27;s Omega Beams. &quot;Teen Titans Academy&quot; is one of the series which leads directly into the events of the major company crossover &quot;Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, which sees Nightwing, the Titans, and the other younger heroes step up in the Justice League&#x27;s absence to defeat a possessed Deathstroke&#x27;s dark army and save the multiverse.

===&quot;Dawn of DC&quot; (2023–present)===
Following the events of &quot;Dark Crisis&quot; and during the run of writer Tom Taylor on &quot;Nightwing&quot;, Superman approaches Nightwing with the proposition that he serves as the leader of the new superhero team who succeeds the Justice League following their disbanding. This leads to Nightwing unveiling a new Titans Tower in Bludhaven with the team consisting of him, The Flash (Wally West), Donna Troy, Beast Boy, Cyborg, Starfire, and Raven. This will lead into a new Titans series written by Taylor and illustrated by Nicola Scott. The Titans&#x27; first challenge brings them into conflict with Brother Eternity, a Tamaranean named Xand&#x27;r who used to work for the royal family of Tamaran before betraying them to the Citadel, whom has taken over the Church of Blood (now renamed the Church of Eternity) and infuses Tempest with a parasite to turn him against the team. This later leads to the events of &quot;&quot; where Amanda Waller and Doctor Hate (revealed to be Raven&#x27;s demonic half having escaped her gem and taken on a new form styled after Doctor Fate) take advantage of Beast Boy becoming a Star Conqueror to defeat Brother Eternity&#x27;s master, a Star Conqueror known as the Necrostar, and use him as part of a plot to transform the superheroes and supervillains into mind-controlled animals. Although the Titans do return everyone to normal, Waller frames the Titans as the culprits for the attack, and confiscates the Hall of Justice. In addition, Doctor Hate defeats Raven during the incident, imprisons her in her own gem, and poses as her to infiltrate the Titans. Tempest, freed from the parasite, then finally joins the team.

==Titans Tower==

Titans Tower is the headquarters of the Teen Titans. The first tower was located in New York City, while later series depict it in California, usually the San Francisco Bay Area. Although the location and actual look of the tower has changed throughout the various series, there are a few defining characteristics, such as always being shaped to resemble the letter &quot;T&quot;. In some series the tower is often colored like sky blue or silver. 

The latest Titans Tower is located in Bludhaven, now being rebuilt over a destroyed prison. This acts as the headquarters for a new team of Titans, who now act as the world&#x27;s protectors after the Justice League has gone into a hiatus.

<text>The Government of the United Kingdom is divided into departments that each have responsibility, according to the government, for putting government policy into practice. There are currently 24 ministerial departments, 20 non-ministerial departments, and 422 agencies and other public bodies, for a total of 465 departments.

== Ministerial departments ==

Ministerial departments are generally the most high-profile government departments and differ from the other two types of government departments in that they include ministers. A list of all ministerial departments is shown below.

== Non-ministerial departments ==

Non-ministerial departments are headed by civil servants and usually have a regulatory or inspection function. A list of all non-ministerial departments is shown below.

== Agencies and other public bodies ==
Government departments in this third and final category can generally be split into five types:
* Executive agencies, which usually provide government services rather than decide policy
* Executive non-departmental public bodies, which do work for the government in specific areas
* Advisory non-departmental public bodies, which provide independent and expert advice to ministers
* Tribunal non-departmental public bodies, which are part of the justice system and have jurisdiction over a specific area of the law
* Independent monitoring boards, which are responsible for the running of prisons and the treatment of prisoners

<text>Charles William Bachman III (December 11, 1924 – July 13, 2017) was an American computer scientist, who spent his entire career as an industrial researcher, developer, and manager rather than in academia. He was particularly known for his work in the early development of database management systems.
His techniques of layered architecture include his namesake Bachman diagrams.

== Biography ==
Charles Bachman was born in Manhattan, Kansas, in 1924, where his father, Charles Bachman Jr., was the head football coach at Kansas State College. He attended high school in East Lansing, Michigan, where his father served as head football coach at Michigan State College from 1933–1946.

In World War II he joined the United States Army and spent March 1944 through February 1946 in the South West Pacific Theater serving in the Anti-Aircraft Artillery Corps in New Guinea, Australia, and the Philippine Islands. There he was first exposed to and used fire control computers for aiming 90 mm guns.

After his discharge in 1946 he attended Michigan State College and graduated in 1948 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering, where he was a member of Tau Beta Pi. In mid-1949, he married Connie Hadley.

He then attended the University of Pennsylvania. In 1950, he graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering, and had also completed three-quarters of the requirements for an MBA from the university&#x27;s Wharton School.

Bachman died on July 13, 2017, at his home in Lexington, Massachusetts, of Parkinson&#x27;s disease at the age of 92.

==Career==
Bachman spent his entire career as a practicing software engineer or manager in industry rather than in academia. In 1950, he started working at Dow Chemical in Midland, Michigan.

In 1957, he became Dow&#x27;s first data processing manager. He worked with the IBM user group SHARE on developing a new version of report generator software, which became known as 9PAC. However, the planned IBM 709 order was cancelled before it arrived.

In 1960, he joined General Electric, where by 1963 he developed the Integrated Data Store (IDS), one of the first database management systems using what came to be known as the navigational database model, in the Manufacturing Information And Control System (MIACS) product.

Working for customer Weyerhaeuser Lumber, he developed the first multiprogramming network access to the IDS database, an early online transaction processing system called WEYCOS in 1965.

Later, at GE, he developed the &quot;dataBasic&quot; product that offered database support to Basic language timesharing users.
In 1970, GE sold its computer business to Honeywell Information Systems, so he and his family moved from Phoenix, Arizona to Lexington, Massachusetts.

In 1981, he joined a smaller firm, Cullinane Information Systems (later Cullinet), which offered a version of IDS that was called IDMS and supported IBM mainframes.

=== Bachman Information Systems ===
In 1983, he founded Bachman Information Systems, which developed a line of computer-aided software engineering (CASE) products. The centerpiece of these products was the BACHMAN/Data Analyst, which provided graphic support to the creation and maintenance of Bachman Diagrams. It was featured in IBM&#x27;s Reengineering Cycle marketing program, combining:

# the reverse engineering of obsolete mainframe databases,
# data modeling,
# forward engineering to new physical databases, and
# optimization of physical database designs for performance and DBMS specifics.

In 1991 Bachman Information Systems had their initial public offering, trading on the NASDAQ with the symbol BACH. After reaching a high of $37.75 in February 1992, the price hit $1.75 in 1995.
In 1996, his company merged with Cadre Technology to form Cayenne Software.
He served as president of the combined company for a year, and then retired to Tucson, Arizona. He continued to serve as chairman of the board of Cayenne, which was acquired by Sterling Software in 1998.

==Awards==
* Bachman received the Turing Award from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in 1973 for &quot;his outstanding contributions to database technology&quot;.
* He was elected as a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society in 1977 for his pioneering work in database systems.
* In 2012, Bachman was awarded a National Medal of Technology and Innovation &quot;for fundamental inventions in database management, transaction processing, and software engineering.&quot;
* He was named an ACM Fellow in 2014 “&quot;For contributions to database technology, notably the integrated data store”.&quot; 
* In 2015, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum &quot;for his early work on developing database systems.&quot;

<text>Jornada del Muerto was the name given by the Spanish conquistadors to the Jornada del Muerto desert basin, and the almost waterless trail across the Jornada beginning north of Las Cruces and ending south of Socorro, New Mexico. The name translates from Spanish as &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Journey&quot; or &quot;Route of the Dead Man&quot;. The trail was part of the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro which led northward from central colonial New Spain, present-day Mexico, to the farthest reaches of the viceroyalty in northern Nuevo México Province (the area around the upper valley of the Rio Grande). 

Spaceport America is located in the middle portion of the Jornada del Muerto at an elevation of . The Trinity nuclear test site, the location of the first test of an atomic bomb in 1945 is in the northern portion of the Jornada.

==Natural history==
The Jornada del Muerto basin is wide east to west and from north to south. Terrain is flat desert landforms and xeric vegetation. The historic trail crossing north to south across most of the Jornada is long. The desert basin runs between the Oscura Mountains and San Andres Mountains on the east, and the Fra Cristóbal Range and Caballo Mountains on the west. The western mountains block access to the Rio Grande. The only reliable water source near the middle of the journey was the Ojo del Muerto, which was from the main trail and difficult to reach by wagon train. The Laguna del Muerto or Engle Lake is near the trail, but is often dry. The Jornada is one of the northernmost parts of the Chihuahuan Desert ecoregion in the deserts and xeric shrublands biome. The average elevation is about . 

The Jornada del Muerto remains almost entirely uninhabited and undeveloped to the present day. Located just to the east of the southernmost region of the desert is the Jornada Basin LTER station, used for study of desert ecology, land management, plant physiology, and related topics.

===Volcanism===
The Jornada del Muerto volcano and malpaís are located at the northern end of the desert&#x27;s region and basin. The Jornada del Muerto Volcano is a shield volcano that erupted about 760,000 years ago, reaching an elevation of . The volcano&#x27;s lava flow created the large Jornada del Muerto malpaís lava field, about , about in size. The eruption produced a slow and viscous a&#x27;a lava which leaves a very rough surface, making travel across it difficult.

===Climate===
The climate of Aleman Ranch, near Spaceport America, is typical of the climate of the Jornada del Muerto. Under the Köppen Classification, the climate of Aleman Ranch is at the borderline between desert (BWk) and steppe (BSk) climates. 
==Cultural history==

Abundant evidence of Paleo-Indian occupation has been found near Mockingbird Gap in the northern Jornada. The projectile points and other remains found by archaeologists are examples of the Clovis culture (c. 9000 BCE) and Folsom culture (c. 8000 BCE). Precipitation in the Jornada began to decline about 9000 BCE, resulting in less evidence of the presence of Paleo-Indian cultures. 

The Jornada became well-known to the Spanish in 1598 during the colonizing mission of Juan de Oñate. Oñate, as would later travelers, chose to cross the Jornada rather than follow the Rio Grande because the route was shorter and easier to traverse with the ox-drawn carts and livestock of the Spanish colonists. It took five days of little water for Oñate to cross the Jornada. The Jornada del Muerto was named when the bones of a German (&quot;alemán&quot; in Spanish) were found in 1670 along the route. Aleman became the name of a watering and populated place along the route across the Jornada. 

After passing the &quot;Jornada del Muerto&quot; the earliest Spanish traveling north encountered the walled villages of the Pueblo dwellers, who had a well-developed agriculture and a peaceable tradition. After the first crossing the Jornada del Muerto in 1598 they named one of the first pueblos they came to Socorro (Spanish for &#x27;help&#x27; or &#x27;assistance&#x27;).

In 1680, during the Pueblo Revolt, 2,000 Spanish settlers, including Indians from the Isleta and Socorro Pueblos, were forced to retreat southward, across the Jornada del Muerto, The survivors resettled on the Rio Grande around and south of El Paso del Norte, &#x27;the Pass to the North&#x27;, which is now separated between the Mexican city of Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, and the U.S. city of El Paso, Texas. In 1692, Diego de Vargas led a new group of settlers north across the Jornada del Muerto to resettle northern New Mexico.

On horseback the Jornada could be traversed in as little as two days, as described by Bishop Tamarón traveling north on his visitation to New Mexico in 1760. Leaving the Paraje de Robledo, traveling five leagues:

Homesteaders in the 1860s to 1920s tried to ranch in the Jornada del Muerto, digging wells for the cattle. The first well was at Aleman, dug by Lt. John Martin, and it appears to be the last of the homesteads to be abandoned at the end of the 20th century.

===Trail===
The Jornada del Muerto trail was that part of the Camino Real which when traveling northward departed from the Rio Grande from the Paraje de Robledo, later the site of Fort Selden, just north of Las Cruces, New Mexico. It passed northward up through a gap, between the Selden Hills on the west and Doña Ana Mountains to the east, on to the plain of the Jornada. The last opportunity for filling water barrels and watering stock before passing farther north was from the Paraje de San Diego overlooking the Rio Grande five leagues beyond Robledo and a half league from the River.

The next intermittent water was at Paraje del Perrillo near where the trail passes Point of Rocks which is the southernmost point of the closed Jornada basin. The trail heads basically north through mesquite scrub land to another small intermittent watering place, La Cruz de Alemán, named for a fugitive German merchant who died of thirst there in the 1670s, at a time when it had no water. At that site there are now buildings of the Bar Cross Ranch built on the site of the original settlement in the Jornada del Muerto, the Aleman Ranch, established in 1867.

Further north the trail crosses a number of small ephemeral lake beds the Jornada Lakes, on the way to Engle Lake then known as the Laguna del Muerto. When water was not found in the Laguna del Muerto it could be found to the west at the Ojo del Muerto, a spring in Cañon del Muerto in the southern Fra Cristobal Range nearby to the southeast of the later site of Fort McRae that operated from 1863 to 1876.

At the upper end of the basin the trail was squeezed into the Lava Gate between the Fra Cristóbal Range and the Jornada del Muerto Volcano lava fields. The waterless portion of the trail ends at Paraje de Fray Cristóbal on the Rio Grande, but the trail continued north along the river for five leagues, across a small portion of the Jornada del Muerto Volcano lava fields, which originally reached across the Rio Grande. This large lava field has a very rough surface, making travel across it very difficult. This portion of the trail reached the paraje del Contadero along the Rio Grande south of the Mesa del Contadero. It then passed one of two ways around the Mesa, along the river or over the hills to its east, to a paraje and fords of the Rio Grande known as Val Verde from the 1780s. An extremely large Spanish rancho was later established and a large hacienda was built at the crossing at Val Verde in the early 1820s. However it was abandoned soon after under the pressure of Apache raids and attacks by 1826.

In 1846, Major Philip St. George Cooke and the Mormon Battalion established a wagon road south of San Antonio on an old trail on the west bank of the Rio Grande as far as a few miles above the vicinity of modern Hatch, New Mexico, before turning west to make the route known as Cooke&#x27;s Wagon Road. Soon after the war ended and the California Gold Rush began, thousands of people were following Cooke&#x27;s road west to California down the west side of the Rio Grande. 

With the American acquisition of New Mexico Territory as a consequence of the Mexican American War, protection of settlements and travel by the U. S. Army on the lower Rio Grande below San Antonio began. Fort Conrad was established in 1851 across the river and a little north of the ford of Valverde, and it was replaced in 1854 by Fort Craig miles below the ford and the Mesa, also on the west bank. Fort Thorn was built on the west bank of the Rio Grande in 1853. It was located where a trail from the Jornada road, established by Forty-niners, crossed the Rio Grande to the west bank at San Diego Crossing to meet Cooke&#x27;s road three miles above Fort Thorn. These offered some protection on the Jornada road and also on the Fort Craig - Fort Thorn Wagon Road down the west side of the Rio Grande to Fort Thorn. This road was also the route of supply for the forts. This Army protection, and the supply columns use of the road led to native New Mexican settlements on the lower Rio Grande, at Santa Barbara, near Fort Thorn in 1853 and San Ygnacio de Alamosa 35 miles south of Fort Craig in 1859.

The Rio Grande, Mexico and Pacific Railroad (a subsidiary of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe) in 1880 constructed a railroad southward through the Jornada, which became part of the second U.S. transcontinental railroad in March 1881. Now owned by BNSF, it connects Belen with El Paso, Texas as its El Paso Subdivision.

===Atomic test===
On July 16, 1945 the first detonation of an atomic weapon occurred at the Trinity nuclear test site, in the northernmost part of the Jornada del Muerto Basin. Less than a month after Trinity, nuclear bomb &quot;Little Boy&quot; was detonated over Hiroshima, Japan.

<text>Riddrie () is a north-eastern district of Glasgow, Scotland. It lies on the A80 Cumbernauld Road.

==Location and amenities==
Riddrie is a predominantly residential area consisting of 1920s or earlier semi-detached houses (especially in the area known as Riddrie Knowes), and some 1920s three-story tenement buildings containing multiple apartments. It is the location of Barlinnie prison. The area lies to the north east of the centre of Glasgow.

There is a Vogue bingo hall, library, bowling green and local shops. Bus services link Riddrie with Glasgow City Centre and Cumbernauld. Nearby is Hogganfield Loch, around which is a public park.

== Geology ==
Riddrie sits on limestone with a clay layer over it. This can be seen in the outcrops in the area where the limestone breaks through. There is a stone quarry in the grounds of HMP Barlinnie, which was used to create the War Memorial in Lee Avenue, according to its inscription. Limestone, a biochemical sedimentary rock, is in Riddrie of the Clackmannan Group Type. It dates from the Carboniferous Period and specifically to 318 to 328 million years ago. Coal seams in the immediate area to the east were considered commercially exploitable from the late eighteenth century onwards once the canal had been built. Under Riddrie Knowes there is a sill of volcanic rock, and Glasgow and its environs are much affected by patterns of Ice Age melt.

== History ==

=== Canal and motorway proximity ===
The former Monkland Canal to the immediate north of modern Riddrie was begun by James Watt in June 1770 as the first stage of a plan to allow transport of coal to the centre of Glasgow. One of its water sources was Hogganfield Loch. The canal&#x27;s commercial development had by 1792 allowed coal exploitation close to its route to grow. The first half of the 19th century saw this use intensify with the opening of ironworks in Coatbridge. Both shallow and deep coalmining took place close to and under Riddrie. The Monkland Canal traffic was close by. In the late 18th century, there was a drawbridge at Riddrie where coal was sold at competitive rates. The last deep workings in the area closed in 1931. Mine workings under Riddrie have become unstable in heavy rain, leading to the collapse of ground in Riddrie Park Cemetery.

By the 1920s, the abandoned canal waterway had become a public danger, resulting in Riddrie children drowning, and has been described as a source of &quot;continuous outcry&quot; from residents. The canal was eventually filled in the 1960s and is now the M8 motorway with the exit for Riddrie at Junction 12. Riddrie was a significant point in the M8 project. In 1978, the section from Riddrie to Ballieston roundabout was designed and constructed to a dual three lane motorway standard, in the immediate expectation of 45,000 vehicles per 16-hour day. In 2020, annual average daily flow traffic records show that the Riddrie/Blackhill Junction 12 section carried 70,676 vehicles (almost 10% being heavy goods vehicles).

=== Early records ===
Few early records survive because settlement was so sparse before the mid-19th century. There are some 18th century tax records that indicate the presence of a few wealthier individuals. Income tax was not used in the UK until 1798, and instead a variety of lands, goods and services were taxed. In the late 18th century, horse tax was levied separately on carriage or saddle horses, but not on working farm animals. Captain Christie of Riddrie is shown in the tax roll for 1797–98 as owning one horse. The Farm horse tax rolls show Captain Christie of Riddrie in 1797–98 as owning two farm horses. His neighbours are also shown: William Turnbull of Smithy Croft (two farm horses) and David Bennerman at Lathamhill (four farm horses).

Other records include a land tax listing in 1803 for George Provand, recorded as the owner of Riddrie Park. By 1852, the limited buildings in the area are seen in detail on the &quot;Map of the country for ten miles round Glasgow&quot; at the National Library of Scotland. Riddrie and Riddrie Park together account for only three dwellings.

=== Reformatory at Riddrie Farm ===

From 1861, the House of Refuge in Duke Street, a boys&#x27; reformatory, had added to its operation an experimental branch at Riddrie Farm. Prior to this the harsh regime at the Duke Street reformatory had been conducted entirely indoors. Riddrie Farm extended to and was used for giving the boys a basic training in farm labour as well as some fresh air. In 1866, 25 boys had this opportunity and were educated in &quot;spade-husbandry, to drain the land, to cultivate cabbages and turnips, to tend cows and horses etc.&quot; The Riddrie Farm establishment was fully certified to operate as from 16 January 1867. Riddrie Farm was closed as from 1871 due to excessive costs to run two sites. During its time in operation, Riddrie Farm was supervised and inspected by the Prison Commissioners, being classified as a Reformatory and Industrial School. Riddrie Farm was inspected in June and September 1869 at a point where there were 128 boys resident. There had been discussion as to whether the whole reformatory ought to be relocated to Riddrie, so the character of Riddrie was known to the prison authorities long before the building of Barlinnie. In the period 1866–68, 158 boys were discharged from the Duke Street/ Riddrie Farm reformatory. Forty seven are not accounted for, whereas 34 are convicted of further crimes, and 64 are recorded as &quot;doing well.&quot; In a Glasgow map of 1888, Riddrie can be seen and it is shown as containing only one very large building, the rest being open land.

=== Prison and housing development ===
The Riddrie area settlement was first intensively developed by the construction of Barlinnie prison in the 1880s, in the effort to relieve Glasgow&#x27;s prison overcrowding. The site was bought by the Scottish Prison Department for the purpose from Mr Wilson of Campbellfield. The farmstead was known as Barlinnie, and the surrounding land as Blairlenny. The name Barlinnie can be traced back as far as 1562. It combines Scottish Gaelic, &#x27;blàr&#x27; (field) and &#x27;làanach&#x27; (swampy).

Once the prison was built, it was surrounded by &quot;farmland, mansion houses out to the Monkland Canal, except for an embryonic village at Riddrie Knowes&quot;. The Riddrie housing development of the 1920s of around 1,000 dwellings took place over a greenfield site (as shown in the Ordnance Survey for 1857–93). The development was a response to the urgent need for additional housing following the First World War, and it was the first scheme to be completed on behalf of the City Council under the Addison Act. It was originally council housing (to a high specification for the time) and the properties were built with cavity insulation and electric provision. They were made available to respectable wage-earners who were known to be &quot;people of good character&quot;. The development took place under the control of Glasgow City Council Director of Housing Peter Fyfe (active 1919-23). Approximately 3,000 people moved in. The housing element of the Riddrie scheme was the first to be built, whereas the integrated envisaged church, library, school and cinema were subsequently created.

Riddrie was likely inhabited by the incoming council occupiers during 1922, not 1923 as stated in the &quot;Third Statistical Account of Scotland&quot; (published 1958), on the basis that it is correct that the Minute Book of the Riddrie Ratepayers&#x27; Association records a meeting on 12 December 1922 at 47 Gadie Street at which they chose their name. In February 1922, the new roads were being prepared but show-houses with electricity were available for people to inspect. The full and detailed description of the houses was given wide publicity. In March 1923, 500 children living in newly-constructed Riddrie had to be schooled in Haghill. By February 1924, so many homes in Riddrie were in occupation that the need for a school there was openly described as one of urgent necessity.

Blackhill (adjacent  to the 1920s development of Riddrie) was designated in the 1930s for new housing. The Blackhill area was developed to rehouse people from slum clearance elsewhere. The process of rehousing was abrupt and relocations were without consultation. This resulted in tensions within Riddrie as successive clearances took place. These tensions did not apparently abate over time. In 1962, at a rating appeal brought by the Riddrie Ratepayers&#x27; Association, the Blackhill estate was described by them as &quot;one of the worst slum clearance schemes&quot; that negatively impacted the amenity of Riddrie. In 1977, a Riddrie councillor launched a campaign to get the pedestrian motorway bridge by Gala Street demolished. In the three years since it was built, levels of brick-throwing and vandalism from the Blackhill youths from the other side were said to make life unbearable for Riddrie residents.

Living from around 1927 in Almond Street, Riddrie, Rikki Fulton describes the area in his childhood as a &quot;quiet and pleasant place to live&quot; and well-laid out. Alasdair Gray (born 1934) describes his childhood, recalling the Riddrie Housing Scheme development where he grew up as &quot;good, pleasant and normal&quot; with well-kept gardens and tree-lined streets.

=== Tram and trolleybus connections ===
Glasgow Corporation tramways operated connections to Riddrie. Lightweight trams and later trolley buses linked Riddrie to Glasgow&#x27;s centre. Initially the route went along Cumbernauld Road but by early 1929 there was complaint about a diversion (perhaps a temporary one) along the narrower Gala Street. The Bellahouston to Millerston line ran from 1938. From 1958, a trolleybus service ran from Shieldhall and Linthouse to Riddrie. Shipyard specials connected Riddrie to the docks. The tram system closed in 1962.

=== From 1970 ===
During the 1970s and 1980s, the deteriorated quality of the housing stock in Riddrie, as with other areas in Glasgow, saw a policy focus on regeneration. For Riddrie the Glasgow Eastern Area Renewal (GEAR) Project, ending in 1987, saw significant refurbishment at public expense of the existing 1920s development. The improvements were a part of a city-wide plan of investment. Many of these dwellings have over time become privately owned following the introduction in 1980 by Mrs Margaret Thatcher of a right to buy council housing. In 1983, it was proposed to replace the rotten wooden window frames in the council houses, which the Council insisted should be preceded by the tenants signing an agreement not to buy the dwelling for 10 years. Though most signed, a vocal minority resisted on the basis that they were entitled to new windows anyway. The Council regarded the spending of the window money as depleting their housing reserves if the council house was purchased.

=== From 1990 ===
In November 1993, in an unsolved crime, Paul Hamilton was murdered by gunfire whilst driving his car in Riddrie. It has been suspected this was because he had given an alibi for a man tried for the murder of Arthur Thompson (Jnr) two years previously. This was the son of a well-known professional criminal, Arthur Thompson.

In 2006, Riddrie was reported as one of 14 areas for detailed study in the GoWell project. The project investigated quality of life in low income areas, specifically concentrating on households, housing, neighbourhoods, communities, empowerment and health. The Report is dated February 2012. Riddrie, alongside nearby Carntyne, Townhead and Govan are housing investment areas where gradual upgrades are taking place to dwellings, both internally and externally.

In 2016, the ambitious Seven Lochs Wetland Park project was awarded approximately £4.5 million to create and enhance a linked wildlife/nature scheme with pathways and access routes. The seven lochs in question are: Bishop Loch, Frankfield Loch, Garnqueen Loch, Hogganfield Loch, Johnston Loch, Lochend Loch and Woodend Loch. The lochs, parks, nature reserves and woods are all in the area that begins in Riddrie and extends to Coatbridge in Lanarkshire. At the time this was Scotland&#x27;s largest urban nature park.

=== From 2020 ===
On 31 January 2023, Councillor Angus Millar, Glasgow City Convener for Climate and Transport announced the outcome of the recent consultations in Riddrie that took place as part of the Glasgow &quot;Liveable Neighbourhoods&quot; project. The consultations were destined to produce a successful concept design for Riddrie, described by Councillor Millar as creating a &quot;safer and more attractive public realm in Riddrie.&quot; The Concept Design Report, Tranche 1 includes Riddrie and suggests street improvements and reduction of vehicle traffic by improving alternative active access. Areas for enhancement are: improving the aspect of the junction of Cumbernauld Road and Smithycroft Road; landscaping and pavement widening at Smithycroft Road South Riddrie Town Centre; garden and landscaping at Smithycroft Road South Riddrie Town Centre; and incorporating for school use certain land adjoining Smithycroft Secondary School. Plans include significant &quot;greening&quot; of the space by the provision of gardens, trees, hedges, shrubs, wild flower planting and benches.

== Notable buildings/ features ==

=== Barlinnie prison ===
HMP Barlinnie dominates the skyline of Riddrie where it is located. It was designed initially for 1,000 men, and they were required to break rocks there. The prison also had a library and facilities for teaching skills. In the early years, the prison guards had their own tenements (now demolished) at Barlinnie. The prison has had a number of riots and disciplinary problems, possibly caused by the conditions inside it. The prison burial grounds officially contained 10 corpses. In the 1970s during work, a further (unspecified) number of burials were discovered. In the period 1996-98, eight suicides took place in Barlinnie before an investigation of conditions inside. The prison has become known locally (ironically) as &quot;the Riddrie Hilton&quot; or as &quot;Bar-L&quot; or as &quot;the Big Hoos.&quot;

=== Barlinnie War Memorial ===
There is a war memorial in Lee Avenue, Riddrie, in the form of an obelisk incised with memorial tributes to the officers of HMP Barlinnie and their sons who were killed in action in the First World War. On that part of the monument the inscription reads: &quot;This monument of stone taken from the prison quarry is erected by the staff. It should have been of gold.&quot; There is a further commemoration of prison officers who died in military service in the Second World War.

=== Riddrie Bowling Club ===
This is a lawn bowling club for members, together with a large hall that can be hired for functions. The address is 90 Smithycroft Road. A former President of the Riddrie Bowling Club was Dr James Scott Kinross, the first resident doctor for the housing development of the 1920s. He served in Riddrie until 1941 when he died there. He had been Chairman of a medical board in Glasgow as well.

=== Riddrie Community Gardens ===
In 2008, Riddrie Community Gardens, an unincorporated charitable body, received from the National Lottery a grant to set up a wildlife breathing space, a pond, flower meadows and fruit trees. Glasgow City Council assisted in this provision to take place over four allotments, and also assisted in the training of around 30 volunteers. In the following year, the National Lottery made a further grant to supply additional equipment, horticultural elements and some security fencing for the cabin. The total awarded was £18,993.

=== Riddrie Library ===
The Riddrie Library was purpose-built in 1938. It has one floor, and cost the Glasgow City Council £10,000. It has a handsome Art Deco exterior and is currently run by Glasgow Life on behalf of the City Council. The Riddrie Public Library is described by Alasdair Gray (born 1934) during his childhood as being the repository of a multitude of exciting books. In 2017, he selected it to become a gallery for his works beginning with his picture &quot;Cowcaddens Streetscape in the Fifties&quot; (1964).

The library is open every day from 10 am to 5pm except Sunday when it is closed.

=== Riddrie Park Cemetery ===

==== The main cemetery ====
The Riddrie Park Cemetery at 1171 Cumbernauld Road contains substantial numbers of graves. It is inside the boundaries of Riddrie but lies adjacent to the Lethamhill Golf Course to its east. To its north east, and almost adjacent, lies Hogganfield Loch. This cemetery has an alternative identification as Provanmill Road Cemetery. Its Canmore identification is 268447, where aerial photographs show the pathway network (as at 2005) and proximity to Hogganfield Loch. Canmore is part of Historic Environment Scotland.

The &quot;lost&quot; burial ground of St Mungo&#x27;s (1832–1870) was closed due to overcrowding and concerns for the health of patients in the adjoining infirmary. In 1903, the bodies from St Mungo&#x27;s were exhumed and reburied at Riddrie Park Cemetery.

The Glasgow Corporation Sanitary Department had reserved ground at two Glasgow cemeteries for pauper or unclaimed body burial, including Riddrie Park Cemetery. The annual total of bodies dealt with in this way by the beginning of the First World War was approximately 450.

The Commonwealth War Graves Commission records the cemetery as containing overall (scattered) burials for 100 First World War casualties and 248 Second World War casualties. These numbers are recorded as reflective of the status of Glasgow as headquarters of the Highland Light Infantry and as the location of several large military hospitals during the First World War. Further, the nearby Clydeside shipping yards were a target of intensive bombing during the Second World War, in particular on the night of 13/14 March 1941 (known as the &quot;Clydebank Blitz&quot;). Many civilian and military deaths arose then. A Commonwealth War Graves monument in the form of a large standing white Cross of Sacrifice was erected as a memorial to the soldiers and sailors who died in the First World War and were buried in the cemetery. A new war memorial was created in December 2013 for those who died in military service in the First and Second World Wars. The monument is by the pathway next to the Cross of Sacrifice and was erected because parts of the cemetery are not accessible to the public.

==== The Jewish Cemetery ====
Although strictly outside the bounds of the Riddrie Park Cemetery, the Riddrie Jewish Cemetery adjoins it and is often thought to be a section of it. The need in this area began following the opening in 1880 of the first synagogue in the Gorbals with its small burial plot in Craigton. The requirement for more space was met by the South Portland Street Synagogue opening another cemetery in around 1908 in Riddrie. The plot contains 729 lairs. This served an impoverished section of the population that often could not afford the costs involved. In 1908 the Glasgow Hebrew Burial Society started a saving scheme for members. They in turn bought a small burial ground in Sandymount, in the Shettleston area. The last Riddrie burial in the Jewish Cemetery was in 2003.

==== People and events ====
The cemetery contains the burial plot and marker stone of Lt Henry May VC (1885–1941), who was awarded the Victoria Cross in the First World War for outstanding gallantry. The soldier was serving in the First Battalion, The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) when at La Boutillerie on 22 October 1914 he voluntarily acted despite great personal risk so as to rescue others whilst under heavy enemy fire.

In 1963, Edwin Morgan (later the first &quot;Makar&quot; or Poet Laureate for Scotland) wrote an acclaimed poem called &quot;King Billy&quot; about Billy Fullerton, the deceased leader of the Bridgeton Billy Boys. They were a violent 500-strong gang of Protestant young men in the 1920s and 1930s. Billy Fullerton (1904–1962) is thought to be in an unmarked grave in Riddrie Park Cemetery, as indicated in the opening words: &quot;Grey over Riddrie the clouds piled up, dragged their rain through the cemetery trees. The gates shone cold…&quot;.

In August 2002, a freak accident occurred during heavy rain when old mine workings under the cemetery opened, causing a teenage boy to drown.

The Riddrie Park Cemetery is one of only three Glasgow sites where the Common Blue butterfly was to be found (2007–8).

=== Smithycroft Secondary School ===
Smithycroft Secondary School is a large comprehensive school dating from the 1960s. It takes its pupils from both sides of the M8 motorway. The original school was constructed over the period 1964-66, having been designed by the Glasgow City Council Chief Architect Archibald George Jury. In 1966, Glasgow City Council decided that Riddrie was to be reorganised so as to have comprehensive education. There was to be a new comprehensive secondary school to open for the school year 1967–68. In 1968, in order to accommodate this ambition, the school building was significantly expanded at the cost of £163,000. The built design took the form of a reinforced concrete mass shaped in a circle, with a smaller circle inside it. The larger circle housed wedge-shaped classrooms, and in the middle of the structure was a thirteen sided hall. These were the subject of a photographic survey in 2001 prior to demolition. The portfolio of photographs was archived by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland. The original building was then demolished in its entirety and the current building(s) replaced it.

The Concept Design for Glasgow (2022) suggested that the school should be permitted to take over an area of land facing it to the east (towards the blocked-up underpass) so as to provide additional areas of amenity.

=== St Enoch&#x27;s Parish Church ===
This is a listed (Category C) Church of Scotland building within Riddrie, close to the Barlinnie site, at 860 Cumbernauld Road. It has a hall and a church with a brick-faced exterior and integral design of a simple Gothic high vaulted building with Art Nouveau influence. The complex was built in the years 1927–30 by John Keppie &amp; Henderson, architects. The interior displays an open hammerbeam ceiling and whitewashed aspect. There is a large Celtic cross and an inset stone memorial taken from the previous Saltmarket St Enoch&#x27;s church. The stone is dated as 1780. The site originally included a timber hall dated 1923 by the same architects but was demolished in 1992. Hogganfield lies adjacent to Riddrie and the church is designated by reference to it. The church also contains a black marble memorial with a brass plaque commemorating those parishioners killed in service in the First World War. It was moved to its present location in 1925 when the previous St Enoch&#x27;s church was demolished.

The organ at St Enoch&#x27;s was built in 1930 by H Hilsdon. The 1901 Forster &amp; Andrews organ was moved here from the previous St Enoch&#x27;s. The details of the organ were recorded in 1999 under D07116 at the National Pipe Organ Register.

=== St Thomas the Apostle Roman Catholic Church ===
The church (completed 1957) is at the triangular base of Smithycroft Road/826 Cumbernauld Road and the site is shown on Ordnance survey as including a separate hall and Roman Catholic primary school. The church itself has a brick-faced exterior which displays a large, striking triform three-quarters statuary relief mimicking the shape of three linked window spaces. The interior has been modernised by the white of walls and vaulted ceilings, and the removal of the high altar from the East wall to a central position. The site for the church was purchased from the Garroway Estate, which included an existing old mansion house and other buildings. The church was created to accommodate 1,000 people and was officially dedicated and opened on 21 December 1924 by the Archbishop of Glasgow, Msgr Mackintosh. The Rev Dr McEwan was the first parish priest. The school was to be opened in the early part of 1925 under the Sisters of Notre Dame.

The organ at St Thomas Church is an 1886 Brindley &amp; Foster organ from Dowanhill College, Glasgow. The builders in 1979 at Riddrie were Michael Macdonald. It was surveyed and recorded in 1999 and is registered with the National Pipe Organ Register under D07148. It had previously been at Notre Dame Training College (closed 1968).

=== Vogue Bingo Hall, former cinema ===
Described by Historic Scotland as a &quot;rare survival of iconic streamline Art Deco style super-cinema complex,&quot; the former cinema building at 726 Cumbernauld Road, Riddrie, converted for bingo use in 1968. The cinema opened in March 1938, having been designed by cinema specialist architect James McKissack for George Smith and James Welsh. Welsh was Housing Convenor working for the Glasgow City Council, and was a wartime Lord Provost 1943–45. The Art Deco interior of the cinema was lavish and expensive. It has been exceptionally well-preserved despite its re-purposing. There is a cantilevered canopy over the wide central door, and elegant rounded internal entrance lobby walls. The auditorium has a very big central light fitment and sweeping balcony. The oblong clock is a characteristic decorative feature, alongside the tiled surfaces. The interior decorative elements are banding and cloud-form in design. The main entrance originally had a revolving door. The Singleton cinema group bought and renamed it as the Vogue cinema in 1950. The name of the cinema on opening was &quot;The Riddrie&quot;. It features as a film location in David Hayman&#x27;s &quot;Silent Scream&quot; (1990). The cinema was capable of seating 1,700 people.

In 2008, the building including sweetshop and powerhouse was listed as Category B by Historic Scotland.

<doc id="301390" wikidata="Q215583" url="?curid=301390" title="Dogon people">
<text>The Dogon are an ethnic group indigenous to the central plateau region of Mali, in West Africa, south of the Niger bend, near the city of Bandiagara, and in Burkina Faso. The population numbers between 400,000 and 800,000. They speak the Dogon languages, which are considered to constitute an independent branch of the Niger–Congo language family, meaning that they are not closely related to any other languages.

The Dogon are best known for their religious traditions, their mask dances, wooden sculpture, and their architecture. Since the twentieth century, there have been significant changes in the social organisation, material culture and beliefs of the Dogon, in part because Dogon country is one of Mali&#x27;s major tourist attractions.
==Geography and history==

The principal Dogon area is bisected by the Bandiagara Escarpment, a sandstone cliff of up to high, stretching about 150 km (90 miles). To the southeast of the cliff, the sandy Séno-Gondo Plains are found, and northwest of the cliff are the Bandiagara Highlands. Historically, Dogon villages were established in the Bandiagara area a thousand years ago because the people collectively refused to convert to Islam and retreated from areas controlled by Muslims.

Dogon insecurity in the face of these historical pressures caused them to locate their villages in defensible positions along the walls of the escarpment. The other factor influencing their choice of settlement location was access to water. The Niger River is nearby and in the sandstone rock, a rivulet runs at the foot of the cliff at the lowest point of the area during the wet season.

Among the Dogon, several oral traditions have been recorded as to their origin. One relates to their coming from Mande, located to the southwest of the Bandiagara escarpment near Bamako. According to this oral tradition, the first Dogon settlement was established in the extreme southwest of the escarpment at Kani-Na. Archaeological and ethnoarchaeological studies in the Dogon region have been especially revealing about the settlement and environmental history, and about social practices and technologies in this area over several thousands of years.

Over time, the Dogon moved north along the escarpment, arriving in the Sanga region in the 15th century. Other oral histories place the origin of the Dogon to the west beyond the river Niger, or tell of the Dogon coming from the east. It is likely that the Dogon of today are descendants of several groups of diverse origin who migrated to escape Islamization.

It is often difficult to distinguish between pre-Muslim practices and later practices. But Islamic law classified the Dogon and many other ethnicities of the region (Mossi, Gurma, Bobo, Busa and the Yoruba) as being within the non-canon &quot;dar al-harb&quot; and consequently fair game for slave raids organized by merchants. As the growth of cities increased, the demand for slaves across the region of West Africa also increased. The historical pattern included the murder of Indigenous men by raiders and enslavement of women and children.

For almost 1000 years, the Dogon people, an ancient ethnic group of Mali had faced religious and ethnic persecution—through jihads by dominant Muslim communities. These jihadic expeditions formed themselves to force the Dogon to abandon their traditional religious beliefs for Islam. Such jihads caused the Dogon to abandon their original villages and moved up to the cliffs of Bandiagara for better defense and to escape persecution—often building their dwellings in little nooks and crannies.

==Art==

Dogon art consists primarily of sculptures. Dogon art revolves around religious values, ideals, and freedoms (Laude, 19). Dogon sculptures are not made to be seen publicly, and are commonly hidden from the public eye within the houses of families, sanctuaries, or kept with the Hogon (Laude, 20). The importance of secrecy is due to the symbolic meaning behind the pieces and the process by which they are made.

Themes found throughout Dogon sculpture consist of figures with raised arms, superimposed bearded figures, horsemen, stools with caryatids, women with children, figures covering their faces, women grinding pearl millet, women bearing vessels on their heads, donkeys bearing cups, musicians, dogs, quadruped-shaped troughs or benches, figures bending from the waist, mirror-images, aproned figures, and standing figures (Laude, 46–52).

Signs of other contacts and origins are evident in Dogon art. The Dogon people were not the first inhabitants of the cliffs of Bandiagara. Influence from Tellem art is evident in Dogon art because of its rectilinear designs (Laude, 24).

==Culture and religion==
Today, at least 35% of the Dogon practice Islam. Another 10% practices Christianity. Those who have accepted one of these two monotheistic religions have abandoned their worship of fetishes (idols) which had been prevalent amongst them.

Dogon society is organized by a patrilineal kinship system. Each Dogon village, or enlarged family, is headed by one male elder. This chief head is the oldest living son of the ancestor of the local branch of the family.
The blind Dogon elder Ogotemmeli taught the main symbols of the Dogon religion to French anthropologist Marcel Griaule in October 1946. Griaule had lived amongst the Dogon people for fifteen years before this meeting with Ogotemmeli took place. Ogotemmeli taught Griaule the religious stories in the same way that Ogotemmeli had learned them from his father and grandfather; oral instruction which he had learned over the course of more than twenty years. What makes the record so important from a historical perspective is that the Dogon people were still living in their oral culture at the time their religion was recorded. They were one of the last people in West Africa to lose their independence and come under French rule.

The Dogon people with whom French anthropologists Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen worked during the 1930s and 1940s had a system of signs which ran into the thousands, including &quot;their own systems of astronomy and calendrical measurements, methods of calculation and extensive anatomical and physiological knowledge, as well as a systematic pharmacopoeia&quot;. The religion embraced many aspects of nature which are found in other traditional African religions.

The key spiritual figures in the religion were the Nummo/Nommo twins. According to Ogotemmêli&#x27;s description of them, the Nummo, whom he also referred to as &quot;Water&quot;, had green skin covered in green hair, and were formed like humans from the loins up, but serpent-like below. Their eyes were red, their tongues forked, and their arms flexible and unjointed.

Ogotemmêli classified the Nummo as hermaphrodites. Their images or figures appeared on the female side of the Dogon sanctuary. They were primarily symbolized by the Sun, which was a female symbol in the religion. In the Dogon language, the Sun&#x27;s name (&quot;nay&quot;) had the same root as &quot;mother&quot; (&quot;na&quot;) and &quot;cow&quot; (&quot;nā&quot;). They were symbolized by the colour red, a female symbol.

The problem of &quot;twin births&quot; versus &quot;single births&quot;, or androgyny versus single-sexed beings, was said to contribute to a disorder at the beginning of time. This theme was fundamental to the Dogon religion. &quot;The jackal was alone from birth,&quot; said Ogotemmêli, &quot;and because of this he did more things than can be told.&quot; Dogon men were primarily associated with the single-sexed male Jackal and the Sigui festival, which was associated with death on the Earth. It was held once every sixty years and allegedly celebrated the white dwarf star, Sirius B. There has been extensive speculation about the origin of such astronomical knowledge. The colour white was a symbol of men. The ritual language, &quot;Sigi so&quot; or &quot;language of the Sigui&quot;, which was taught to male dignitaries of the Society of the Masks (&quot;awa&quot;), was considered a poor language. It contained only about a quarter of the full vocabulary of &quot;Dogo so&quot;, the Dogon language. The &quot;Sigi so&quot; was used to tell the story of creation of the universe, of human life, and the advent of death on the Earth, during both funeral ceremonies and the rites of the &quot;end of mourning&quot; (&quot;dama&quot;).

Because of the birth of the single-sexed male Jackal, who was born without a soul, all humans eventually had to be turned into single-sexed beings. This was to prevent a being like the Jackal from ever being born on Earth again. &quot;The Nummo foresaw that the original rule of twin births was bound to disappear, and that errors might result comparable to those of the jackal, whose birth was single. Because of his solitary state, the first son of God acted as he did.&quot; The removal of the second sex and soul from humans is what the ritual of circumcision represents in the Dogon religion. &quot;The dual soul is a danger; a man should be male, and a woman female. Circumcision and excision are once again the remedy.&quot;

The Dogon religion was centered on this loss of twinness or androgyny. Griaule describes it in this passage:

The birth of human twins was celebrated in the Dogon culture in Griaule&#x27;s day because it recalled the &quot;fabulous past, when all beings came into existence in twos, symbols of the balance between humans and the divine&quot;. According to Griaule, the celebration of twin-births was a cult that extended all over Africa. Today, a significant minority of the Dogon practice Islam. Another minority practices Christianity.

Those who remain in their ethnic religion generally believe in the significance of the stars and the creator god, Amma, who created Earth and molded it into the shape of a woman, imbuing it with a divine feminine principle.

=== Marriage ===
The vast majority of marriages are monogamous, but nonsororal polygynous marriages are allowed in the Dogon culture. However, even in polygynous marriages, it is rare for a man to have more than two wives. In a polygynous marriage, the wives reside in separate houses within the husband&#x27;s compound. The first wife, or &quot;ya biru,&quot; holds a higher position in the family relative to any wives from later marriages. Formally, wives join their husband&#x27;s household only after the birth of their first child. The selection of a wife is carried out by the man&#x27;s parents. Marriages are endogamous in that the people are limited to marry only persons within their clan and within their caste.

Women may leave their husbands early in their marriage, before the birth of their first child. After a couple has had children together, divorce is a rare and serious matter, and it requires the participation of the whole village. Divorce is more common in polygynous marriages than in monogamous marriages. In the event of a divorce, the woman takes only the youngest child with her, and the rest remain as a part of the husband&#x27;s household. An enlarged family can count up to a hundred persons and is called &quot;guinna&quot;.
The Dogon are strongly oriented toward harmony, which is reflected in many of their rituals. For instance, in one of their most important rituals, the women praise the men, the men thank the women, the young express appreciation for the old, and the old recognize the contributions of the young. Another example is the custom of elaborate greetings whenever one Dogon meets another. This custom is repeated over and over, throughout a Dogon village, all day.

During a greeting ritual, the person who has entered the contact answers a series of questions about his or her whole family, from the person who was already there. The answer is &quot;sewa&quot;, which means that everything is fine. Then the Dogon who has entered the contact repeats the ritual, asking the resident how his or her whole family is. Because the word &quot;sewa&quot; is so commonly repeated throughout a Dogon village, neighboring peoples have dubbed the Dogon the &quot;sewa people&quot;.

=== Hogon ===

The Hogon is the spiritual and political leader of the village. He is elected from among the oldest men of the dominant lineage of the village.

After his election, he has to follow a six-month initiation period, during which he is not allowed to shave or wash. He wears white clothes and nobody is allowed to touch him. A virgin who has not yet had her period takes care of him, cleans his house, and prepares his meals. She returns to her home at night.
After initiation, the Hogon wears a red fez. He has an armband with a sacred pearl that symbolises his function. The virgin is replaced by one of his wives, and she also returns to her home at night. The Hogon has to live alone in his house. The Dogon believe the sacred snake Lébé comes during the night to clean him and to transfer wisdom.

=== Subsistence pattern ===
The Dogon are primarily agriculturalists and cultivate millet, sorghum and rice, as well as onions, tobacco, peanuts, and some other vegetables. Griaule encouraged the construction of a dam near Sangha and persuaded the Dogon to cultivate onions. The economy of the Sangha region has doubled since then, and its onions are sold as far as the market of Bamako and those of the Ivory Coast. Grain is stored in granaries.

In addition to agriculture, the women gather wild fruits, tubers, nuts, and honey in the bush outside of village borders. Some young men will hunt for small game, but wild animals are relatively scarce near villages. While the people keep chickens or herds of sheep and goats in Dogon villages, animal husbandry holds little economic value. Individuals with high status may own a small number of cattle.

Since the late 20th century, the Dogon have developed peaceful trading relationships with other societies and have thereby increased variety in their diets. Every four days, Dogon people participate in markets with neighboring tribes, such as the Fulani and the Dyula. The Dogon primarily sell agricultural commodities: onions, grain, cotton, and tobacco. They purchase sugar, salt, European merchandise, and many animal products, such as milk, butter, and dried fish.

===Castes===
There are two endogamous castes in Dogon society: the smiths and the leather-workers. Members of these castes are physically separate from the rest of the village and live either at the village edge or outside of it entirely. While the castes are correlated to profession, membership is determined by birth. The smiths have important ritual powers and are characteristically poor. The leather-workers engage in significant trade with other ethnic groups and accumulate wealth. Unlike norms for the rest of society, parallel-cousin marriage is allowed within castes. Caste boys do not get circumcised.

===Circumcision===

In Dogon thought, men and women are born with both sexual components. The clitoris is considered male, while the foreskin is considered female. (Originally, for the Dogon, man was endowed with a dual soul. Circumcision is believed to eliminate the superfluous one.) Rites of circumcision enable each sex to assume its proper physical identity.

Boys are circumcised in age groups of three years, counting for example all boys between 9 and 12 years old. This marks the end of their youth, and they are initiated. The blacksmith performs the circumcision. Afterwards, the boys stay for a few days in a hut separated from the rest of the village people, until the wounds have healed. The circumcision is celebrated and the initiated boys go around and receive presents. They make music on a special instrument that is made of a rod of wood and calabashes that makes the sound of a rattle.

The newly circumcised youths, now considered young men, walk around naked for a month after the procedure so that their achievement in age can be admired by the tribe. This practice has been passed down for generations and is always followed, even during winter.

Once a boy is circumcised, he transitions into young adulthood and moves out of his father&#x27;s house. All of the men in his age-set live together in a &quot;duñe&quot; until they marry and have children.

The Dogon are among several African ethnic groups that practice female genital mutilation, including a type I circumcision, meaning that the clitoris is removed.

The village of Songho has a circumcision cave ornamented with red and white rock paintings of animals and plants. Nearby is a cave where music instruments are stored.

=== Dogon mask societies ===

The &quot;Awa&quot; is a masked dance society that holds ritual and social importance. It has a strict code of etiquette, obligations, interdicts, and a secret language (&quot;sigi sǫ&quot;). All initiated Dogon men participate in Awa, with the exception of some caste members. Women are forbidden from joining and prohibited from learning &quot;sigi sǫ&quot;. The &#x27;Awa&#x27; is characterized by the intricate masks worn by members during rituals. There are two major events at which the Awa perform: the &#x27;sigi&#x27; ritual and &#x27;dama&#x27; funeral rituals.

&#x27;Sigi&#x27; is a society-wide ritual to honor and recognize the first ancestors. Thought to have originated as a method to unite and keep peace among Dogon villages, the &#x27;sigi&#x27; involves all members of the Dogon people. Starting in the northeastern part of Dogon territory, each village takes turns celebrating and hosting elaborate feasts, ceremonies, and festivities. During this time, new masks are carved and dedicated to their ancestors. Each village celebrates for around a year before the &#x27;sigi&#x27; moves to the next village. A new &#x27;sigi&#x27; is started every 60 years.

Dogon funeral rituals come in two parts. The first occurs immediately after the death of a person, and the second can occur years after the death. Due to the expense, the second traditional funeral rituals, or &quot;damas&quot;, are becoming very rare. Damas that are still performed today are not usually performed for their original intent, but instead are performed for tourists interested in the Dogon way of life. The Dogon use this entertainment to earn income by charging tourists money for the masks they want to see and for the ritual itself (Davis, 68).

The traditional dama consists of a masquerade intended to lead the souls of the departed to their final resting places, through a series of ritual dances and rites. Dogon damas include the use of many masks, which they wore by securing them in their teeth, and statuettes. Each Dogon village may differ in the designs of the masks used in the dama ritual. Similarly each village may have their own way of performing the dama rituals. The dama consists of an event, known as the Halic, that is held immediately after the death of a person and lasts for one day (Davis, 68).

According to Shawn R. Davis, this particular ritual incorporates the elements of the &quot;yingim&quot; and the &quot;danyim.&quot; During the &quot;yincomoli&quot; ceremony, a gourd is smashed over the deceased&#x27;s wooden bowl, hoe, and &quot;bundukamba&quot; (burial blanket). This announces the entrance of persons wearing the masks used in this ceremony, while the deceased&#x27;s entrance to his home in the family compound is decorated with ritual elements (Davis, 72–73).
Masks used during the yincomoli ceremony include the &quot;Yana Gulay&quot;, &quot;Satimbe&quot;, &quot;Sirige&quot;, and &quot;Kanaga&quot;. The Yana Gulay mask&#x27;s purpose is to impersonate a Fulani woman, and is made from cotton cloth and cowl shells. The Satimbe mask represents the women ancestors, who are said to have discovered the purpose of the masks by guiding the spirits of the deceased into the afterlife (Davis, 74). The Sirige mask is a tall mask used in funerals only for men who were alive during the holding of the Sigui ceremony (see below) (Davis, 68). The Kanaga masqueraders, at one point, dance and sit next to the bundkamba, which represents the deceased.

The yingim and the danyim rituals each last a few days. These events are held annually to honor the elders who have died since the last Dama. The yingim consists of both the sacrifice of cows, or other valuable animals, and mock combat. Large mock battles are performed in order to help chase the spirit, known as the &quot;nyama,&quot; from the deceased&#x27;s body and village, and towards the path to the afterlife (Davis, 68).

The danyim is held a couple of months later. During the danyim, masqueraders perform dances every morning and evening for any period up to six days, depending on that village&#x27;s practice. The masqueraders dance on the rooftops of the deceased&#x27;s compound, throughout the village, and in the area of fields around the village (Davis, 68). Until the masqueraders have completed their dances, and every ritual has been performed, any misfortune can be blamed on the remaining spirits of the dead (Davis, 68).

===Sects===

Dogon society is composed of several different sects:
*The sect of the creator god Amma. The celebration is once a year and consists of offering boiled millet on the conical altar of Amma, colouring it white. All other sects are directed to the god Amma.
*&quot;Sigui&quot; is the most important ceremony of the Dogon. It takes place every 60 years and can take several years. The last one started in 1967 and ended in 1973; the next one will start in 2027. The Sigui ceremony symbolises the death of the first ancestor (not to be confused with Lébé) until the moment that humanity acquired the use of the spoken word. The Sigui is a long procession that starts and ends in the village of Youga Dogorou, and goes from one village to another during several months or years. All men wear masks and dance in long processions. The Sigui has a secret language, Sigui So, which women are not allowed to learn. The secret Society of Sigui plays a central role in the ceremony. They prepare the ceremonies a long time in advance, and they live for three months hidden outside of the villages while nobody is allowed to see them. The men from the Society of Sigui are called the &quot;Olubaru&quot;. The villagers are afraid of them, and fear is cultivated by a prohibition to go out at night, when sounds warn that the Olubaru are out. The most important mask that plays a major role in the Sigui rituals is the Great Mask, or the Mother of Masks. It is several meters long, held by hand, and not used to hide a face. This mask is newly created every 60 years.
*The &quot;Binou&quot; sect uses totems: common ones for the entire village and individual ones for totem priests. A totem animal is worshiped on a Binou altar. Totems are, for example, the buffalo for Ogol-du-Haut and the panther for Ogol-du-Bas. Normally, no one is harmed by their totem animal, even if this is a crocodile, as it is for the village of Amani (where there is a large pool of crocodiles that do not harm villagers). However, a totem animal might exceptionally harm if one has done something wrong. A worshiper is not allowed to eat his totem. For example, an individual with a buffalo as totem is not allowed to eat buffalo meat, to use leather from its skin, nor to see a buffalo die. If this happens by accident, he has to organise a purification sacrifice at the Binou altar. Boiled millet is offered, and goats and chickens are sacrificed on a Binou altar. This colours the altar white and red. Binou altars look like little houses with a door. They are bigger when the altar is for an entire village. A village altar also has the &#x27;cloud hook&#x27;, to catch clouds and make it rain.
*The &quot;Lébé&quot; sect worships the ancestor Lébé Serou, the first mortal human being, who, in Dogon myth, was transformed into a snake. The celebration takes place once a year and lasts for three days. The altar is a pointed conic structure on which the Hogon offers boiled millet while mentioning in his benediction eight grains plus one. Afterwards, the Hogon performs some rituals in his house, which is the home of Lébé. The last day, all the village men visit all the Binou altars and dance three times around the Lébé altar. The Hogon invites everybody who assisted to drink the millet beer.
*The &quot;twin&quot; sect: The birth of twins is a sign of good luck. The extended Dogon families have common rituals, during which they evoke all their ancestors back to their origin—the ancient pair of twins from the creation of the world.
*The &quot;Mono&quot; sect: The Mono altar is at the entry of every village. Unmarried young men celebrate the Mono sect once a year in January or February. They spend the night around the altar, singing and screaming and waving with fire torches. They hunt for mice that will be sacrificed on the altar at dawn.

== Dogon villages ==
Villages are built along escarpments and near a source of water. On average, a village contains around 44 houses organized around the &#x27;ginna&#x27;, or head man&#x27;s house. Each village is composed of one main lineage (occasionally, multiple lineages make up a single village) traced through the male line. Houses are built extremely close together, many times sharing walls and floors.

Dogon villages have different buildings:

*&quot;Male granary&quot;: storage place for pearl millet and other grains. Building with a pointed roof. This building is well protected from mice. The number of filled male granaries is an indication for the size and the richness of a guinna.
*&quot;Female granary&quot;: storage place for a woman&#x27;s things, her husband has no access. Building with a pointed roof. It looks like a male granary but is less protected against mice. Here, she stores her personal belongings such as clothes, jewelry, money and some food. A woman has a degree of economic independence, and earnings and things related to her merchandise are stored in her personal granary. She can for example make cotton or pottery. The number of female granaries is an indication for the number of women living in the guinna.
*&quot;Tógu nà&quot; (a kind of &quot;case à palabres&quot;): a building only for men. They rest here much of the day throughout the heat of the dry season, discuss affairs and take important decisions in the toguna. The roof of a toguna is made by 8 layers of millet stalks. It is a low building in which one cannot stand upright. This helps with avoiding violence when discussions get heated.
*&quot;Punulu&quot; (a house for menstruating women): this house is on the outside of the village. It is constructed by women and is of lower quality than the other village buildings. Women having their period are considered to be unclean and have to leave their family house to live during five days in this house. They use kitchen equipment only to be used here. They bring with them their youngest children. This house is a gathering place for women during the evening. This hut is also thought to have some sort of reproductive symbolism due to the fact that the hut can be easily seen by the men who are working the fields who know that only women who are on their period, and thus not pregnant, can be there.

==Languages==

Dogon has been frequently referred to as a single language. There are at least five distinct groups of dialects. The most ancient dialects are &quot;dyamsay&quot; and &quot;tombo&quot;, the former being most frequently used for traditional prayers and ritual chants. The Dogon dialects are highly distinct from one another and many varieties are not mutually intelligible, actually amounting to some 12 dialects and 50 sub-dialects. There is also a secret ritual language &quot;sigi sǫ&quot; (language of Sigi), which is taught to dignitaries (&quot;olubarū&quot;) of the Society of the Masks – all of whom must be circumcised men – during their enthronement at the &quot;Sigui&quot; ceremony. 

It is generally accepted that the Dogon language belongs to the Niger–Congo language family, though the evidence is weak. They have been linked to the Mande subfamily but also to Gur. In a recent overview of the Niger–Congo family, Dogon is treated as an independent branch.

The Dogon languages show few remnants of a unique noun class system, an example of which is that human nouns take a distinct plural suffix. This leads linguists to conclude that Dogon is likely to have diverged from Niger–Congo very early. Another indication of this is the subject–object–verb basic word order, which Dogon shares with such early Niger–Congo branches as Ijoid and Mande.

About 1,500 ethnic Dogon in seven villages in southern Mali speak the Bangime language, which is unrelated to the other Dogon languages and presumed by linguists to be an ancient, pre-Dogon language isolate, although a minority of linguists (most notably Roger Blench) hypothesise that it may be related to Proto-Nilo-Saharan.

==Astronomical beliefs==
Starting with the French anthropologist Marcel Griaule, several authors have claimed that Dogon traditional religion incorporates details about extrasolar astronomical bodies that could not have been discerned from naked-eye observation. The idea has entered the New Age and ancient astronaut literature as evidence that extraterrestrial aliens visited Mali in the distant past. Other authors have argued that previous 20th-century European visitors to the Dogon are a far more plausible source of such information and dispute whether Griaule&#x27;s account accurately describes Dogon myths at all.

From 1931 to 1956, Griaule studied the Dogon in field missions ranging from several days to two months in 1931, 1935, 1937 and 1938 and then annually from 1946 until 1956. In late 1946, Griaule spent a consecutive 33 days in conversations with the Dogon wiseman Ogotemmeli, the source of much of Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen&#x27;s future publications. They reported that the Dogon believe that the brightest star in the night sky, Sirius (&quot;Sigi Tolo&quot; or &quot;star of the Sigui&quot;), has two companion stars, &quot;Pō Tolo&quot; (the Digitaria star), and &quot;ęmmę ya tolo&quot;, (the female Sorghum star), respectively the first and second companions of Sirius A. Sirius, in the Dogon system, formed one of the foci for the orbit of a tiny star, the companionate Digitaria star. When Digitaria is closest to Sirius, that star brightens: when it is farthest from Sirius, it gives off a twinkling effect that suggests to the observer several stars. The orbit cycle takes 50 years. They also claimed that the Dogon appeared to know of the rings of Saturn, and the moons of Jupiter.

Griaule and Dieterlen were puzzled by this &#x27;Sudanese&#x27; star system, and prefaced their analysis with the disclaimer, &quot;The problem of knowing how, with no instruments at their disposal, men could know the movements and certain characteristics of virtually invisible stars has not been settled, nor even posed.&quot;

More recently, doubts have been raised about the validity of Griaule and Dieterlen&#x27;s work. In a 1991 article in &quot;Current Anthropology&quot;, anthropologist Wouter van Beek concluded after his research among the Dogon that, &quot;Though they do speak about &quot;Sigu Tolo&quot; [which is what Griaule claimed the Dogon called Sirius] they disagree completely with each other as to which star is meant; for some it is an invisible star that should rise to announce the sigu [festival], for another it is Venus that, through a different position, appears as &quot;Sigu Tolo&quot;. All agree, however, that they learned about the star from Griaule.&quot;

Griaule&#x27;s daughter Geneviève Calame-Griaule responded in a later issue, arguing that Van Beek did not go &quot;through the appropriate steps for acquiring knowledge&quot; and suggesting that van Beek&#x27;s Dogon informants may have thought that he had been &quot;sent by the political and administrative authorities to test the Dogon&#x27;s Muslim orthodoxy&quot;. An independent assessment is given by Andrew Apter of the University of California.

In a 1978 critique, skeptic Ian Ridpath concluded: &quot;There are any number of channels by which the Dogon could have received Western knowledge long before they were visited by Griaule and Dieterlen.&quot; In his book &quot;Sirius Matters&quot;, Noah Brosch postulates that the Dogon may have had contact with astronomers based in Dogon territory during a five-week expedition, led by Henri-Alexandre Deslandres, to study the solar eclipse of 16 April 1893.

Robert Todd Carroll also states that a more likely source of the knowledge of the Sirius star system is from contemporary, terrestrial sources who provided information to interested members of the tribes. James Oberg, however, citing these suspicions notes their completely speculative nature, writing that, &quot;The obviously advanced astronomical knowledge must have come from somewhere, but is it an ancient bequest or a modern graft? Although Temple fails to prove its antiquity, the evidence for the recent acquisition of the information is still entirely circumstantial.&quot; Additionally, James Clifford notes that Griaule sought informants best qualified to speak of traditional lore, and deeply mistrusted converts to Christianity, Islam, or people with too much contact with whites.

Oberg points out a number of errors contained in the Dogon beliefs, including the number of moons possessed by Jupiter, that Saturn was the furthest planet from the sun, and the only planet with rings. Interest in other seemingly falsifiable claims, namely concerning a red dwarf star orbiting around Sirius (not hypothesized until the 1950s), led him to entertain a previous challenge by Temple, asserting that &quot;Temple offered another line of reasoning. &#x27;We have in the Dogon information a predictive mechanism which it is our duty to test, regardless of our preconceptions.&#x27; One example: &#x27;If a Sirius-C is ever discovered and found to be a red dwarf, I will conclude that the Dogon information has been fully validated.&#x27;

This alludes to reports that the Dogon knew of another star in the Sirius system, &quot;Ęmmę Ya&quot;, or a star &quot;larger than Sirius B but lighter and dim in magnitude&quot;. In 1995, gravitational studies indeed showed the possible presence of a brown dwarf star orbiting around Sirius (a Sirius-C) with a six-year orbital period. A more recent study using advanced infrared imaging concluded that the probability of the existence of a triple star system for Sirius is &quot;now low&quot; but could not be ruled out because the region within 5 AU of Sirius A had not been covered.

<text>Ustka (, , ) is a spa town in the Middle Pomerania region of northern Poland with 17,100 inhabitants (2001). It is part of Słupsk County in Pomeranian Voivodeship. It is located on the Slovincian Coast on the Baltic Sea. It is a port town and popular summer seaside resort of Poland.

== History ==
The first settlers arrived at present-day Ustka as early as the 9th century, and established a fishing settlement with the original name of &quot;Ujść&quot;. In the 10th century, it became part of the emerging country of Poland under its first ruler Mieszko I. The first historic records mention the village under the names of &quot;Ujść&quot; or &quot;Ujście&quot; in 1310.

The area at the mouth of the river Słupia was ceded to the nearby city of Słupsk in 1337 with the purpose of building a fishing harbour and a commercial port there to the Baltic Sea. According to documents in 1355 a church was built. In 1382 the city of Słupsk () became a member of the Hanseatic League. The settlement was located in the Duchy of Słupsk, a vassal duchy of the Kingdom of Poland, and later it passed to the Duchy of Pomerania.

The town was given to Brandenburg-Prussia following the partition of the Duchy of Pomerania after the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, and from the 18th century it formed part of the Kingdom of Prussia. On August 1, 1778, a blaze destroyed 18 houses which, however, were soon re-built. In 1871, the town became part of the German Empire. The first railway station was opened in 1878. The rails were transported by the sea and the bedding for the track was formed by sand taken from the dunes on the Western Beach. The first passenger train departed on 1 October 1878. The rail was also used as a main transport facilitating the trade from the harbour. The rail track was extended to run into the harbour, trading mostly grain and spirits. Records state that in 1887, the local harbour shipped 5 million litres of plain spirits. The Harbour lost its importance after World War II, as fishing began to take priority over trade. The current shape of the harbour is a result of an investment between 1899 and 1903 creating the largest port between Stettin (Szczecin) and Danzig (Gdańsk).

The restoration of independent Poland and creation of the so-called Polish Corridor at the end of World War I separated the German exclave of East Prussia from the German Province of Pomerania. As a result, the German Ministry for Transport established a ferry connection to East Prussia (&quot;Sea Service East Prussia&quot; or &quot;Seedienst Ostpreußen&quot;) in 1922, independent of the transit through Poland. These ships also harboured in Stolpmünde. Because of the increasing traffic it was planned for the harbour to be enlarged and modernized. The gigantic new development kicked off at the beginning of 1938. A third pier was started as docking station for the largest vessels. The construction of the new port was halted on 23 September 1939 after the German Invasion of Poland. During World War II, the Germans operated a forced labour subcamp of the Stalag II-B prisoner-of-war camp for Allied POWs.

The old part of the town has retained its layout since the Middle Ages. The small residential buildings were modernised in the 1830s, however the layout of the streets was not changed. Since 2005, Ustka&#x27;s authorities and the European Union embarked on the Revitalisation Programme for Old Ustka. Many buildings have and are being restored.

Monuments in the town include a lighthouse from 1871 (rebuilt to include the octagonal tower in 1892), Main Post Office from 1875 and church from 1882.

After World War II, the new Polish authorities took steps to determine an official name to replace the German &quot;&#x27;Stolpmünde&quot;&#x27;. &quot;Ujść&quot;, &quot;Uszcz&quot;, and &quot;Ustka&quot; were all posted on the main railway station in 1945; &quot;Nowy Słupsk&quot; was the name on the sign at the main Post Office; &quot;Postomino&quot; was the town&#x27;s name at the town hall; and &quot;Słupioujście&quot; was posted at the Harbour Master&#x27;s office. The final name, &quot;Ustka&quot;, was decided upon in the late 1940s.

From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Słupsk Voivodeship.

== Tourism ==

Ustka is a popular tourist destination and a fishing port on the south coasts of the Baltic. For a number of years, following the political changes in Poland, the town has won a string of local awards for the best summer place in the country. After the collapse of the Ustka Shipyard, the only shipyard in Poland to have manufactured fire-proof lifeboats, and a number of fish processing enterprises, the local authorities put tourism as a primary source of income for the town. Since the end of the 19th century, Ustka has been recognised as a summer holiday resort and various illnesses treatment and recovery centre.

There are two beaches in Ustka. The Eastern Beach and the Western Beach, divided by the river Słupia. Since the eastern part of the town contains the centre, the Eastern Beach is more popular than the Western Beach. The Western Beach runs into the territory of the Navy Training Centre (CSSMW, &quot;Centrum Szkolenia Specjalistów Marynarki Wojennej&quot;), access to which was restricted beyond a certain point in the west. However, much more popular, developed and facilitated with numerous bars, restaurants, a concert hall, and a waterfront promenade (built in 1875), the Eastern Beach is more prone to &quot;abrasia&quot; (the erosion of the sea). The maintenance of the beach, which after the winter storm season becomes very narrow, is one of the considerable expenses of Ustka authorities. The Eastern Beach has high sand cliffs. The Western Beach is flat.

There is a new (built in 2013), swing pedestrian bridge over the river Słupia - open for 15 minutes every hour, that links both beaches every day. Road-rail bridge in Ustka is located outside the centre, in the western part of the town - close to the main railway station.

Near Ustka is a military exercise area from which Meteor-type sounding rockets were launched in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Ustka is also a host of the annual International Contest of Fireworks, which takes place in the middle of July.
==Climate==
Ustka has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfb&quot;).

== Demographics ==
Since the medieval Christianization of the region, the local population was Catholic. After the Reformation, most inhabitants of the town were Protestants and the area were subjected to German colonisation and Germanisation. The Germans were expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. As a result, the current population is once again composed predominantly of Roman Catholics.
==Sports==
The local football team is . It competes in the lower leagues.

<text>Burrel (alternate forms &quot;Burrel&quot;, &quot;Mat&quot;) is a town in northern Albania, 91 km from Tirana. At the 2015 local government reform it became a subdivision and the seat of the municipality Mat. It was the seat of the former District of Mat. The population as of the 2023 census is 7,928.

==History==

The last archaeological researches has explored different trails which demonstrate the population of the area from the paleolithic era. The valley of Mati, has been populated during all the historic periods. In antiquity the region was inhabited by various Illyrian populations including the Pirustae. In second century BC the region came under Roman control.

A famous native of Burrel was Ahmet Zogu, first King of the Albanians (born Ahmet Zogolli, later changed to Ahmet Zogu; 8 October 1895 – 9 April 1961), who reigned as King Zog I from 1928 to 1939. He had previously been a Prime Minister of Albania between 1922 and 1924 and President of Albania between 1925 and 1928.

At one time, Burrel was referred to as the &quot;city of apples&quot; because of the apple trees that lined many of the town&#x27;s streets, however, during the time of the Communist regime and the unrest following the change of government, the apple trees were cut down for profit or personal use as firewood. There are hardly any apple trees left in the town now.

Burrel was a miners&#x27; town during Communist Albania, but the mines closed, with the exception of a ferrochrome plant still operational near Burrel.

During the Kosovo conflict there was a refugee camp near Burrel for 2,000 people. With food and water and supplies from NATO and United States Armed Forces.

==Demographic history==
Burrel (&quot;Burjil&quot;) is recorded in the Ottoman &quot;defter&quot; of 1467 as a settlement belonging to the timar of the local Albanians Kali Gjergji, Gjonima, Gjergji, and Todori in the vilayet of Mati. The village had a total of six households which were represented by the following household heads: &quot;Tanush Shurbi&quot;, &quot;Abati Gjergj&quot;, &quot;Andrija Riçi&quot;, &quot;Gjergj Aleksi&quot;, &quot;Peter Shpani&quot;, and &quot;Gjon Skura&quot;.

==Prison of Burrel==

The city used to be the site of one of the most terrible prisons of the communist regime, where both ordinary criminals and political prisoners such as Bashkim Shehu and Fatos Lubonja or the Catholic priest Dom Simon Jubani were held. Another famous inmate was Pjetër Arbnori, later to become a member of the free Albanian Parliament. Arbnori was known as &quot;the Mandela of the Balkans&quot; because of the length of his internment, which lasted for over 28 years. It was one of the Labor camps in the PSRA. The political prisoners used to be condemned for attempts at overthrowing the state or anti-communist propaganda and agitation, for terms of at least 20 years. Often they were re-condemned while in prison. After the fall of the communist regime, the government of the Democratic Party of Albania closed the prison and made it a museum. However, in 1997, Sali Berisha re-opened it as an active prison.

==Archaeology==
The region of Mati is a real archaeological museum and an ancient cradle of the Illyrian culture. Dilaver Kurti explored objects which demonstrate fact for all ancient historic periods, cultural development not only from the region of Mati but even for all the surroundings. It is a very important zone for the study of the Illyrian culture. The Museum of Mat is a real gem of the Illyrian culture, displaying many artifacts of the Illyrians also displayed and analyzed in the book Trashigime Iliro-Arberore by Dilaver Kurti. Kurti also traveled from village to village collecting ethnographic materials and photographs which make up the material of his books Shenime Etnografike Neper Mat and Foklor Nga Mati.

==Sports==
Klubi Sportiv Burreli (KS Burreli) is an Albanian football (soccer) club based in Burrel. Its home stadium is Liri Ballabani Stadium, also known as the Burreli Stadium, which has a capacity of 3,000 visitors. Founded in 1952 under the name &quot;KS 31 Korriku Burrel&quot;, the club first participated in the Albanian First Division in 1982. As of the 2022–2023 season, KS Burreli finished in 10th place, while playing in the Kategoria e Parë.

<doc id="301394" wikidata="Q185215" url="?curid=301394" title="Piranha">
<text>A piranha or piraña (, or ; , ) is any of a number of freshwater fish species in the family Serrasalmidae, or the subfamily Serrasalminae within the tetra family, Characidae in order Characiformes. These fish inhabit South American rivers, floodplains, lakes and reservoirs. Although often described as extremely predatory and mainly feeding on fish, their dietary habits vary extensively, and they will also take plant material, leading to their classification as omnivorous.

==Etymology==
The name originates from Old Tupi &quot;&quot;, being first attested in the 1587 treatise &quot;&quot; by Portuguese explorer Gabriel Soares de Sousa. &quot;Piranha&quot; first appears in 1869 in English literature, likely borrowed from Portuguese.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
Piranhas belong to the family Serrasalmidae, which includes closely related omnivorous fish such as pacus. Traditionally, only the four genera &quot;Pristobrycon&quot;, &quot;Pygocentrus&quot;, &quot;Pygopristis&quot;, and &quot;Serrasalmus&quot; are considered to be true piranhas, due to their specialized teeth. However, a recent analysis showed, if the piranha group is to be monophyletic, it should be restricted to &quot;Serrasalmus&quot;, &quot;Pygocentrus&quot;, and part of &quot;Pristobrycon&quot;, or expanded to include these taxa plus &quot;Pygopristis&quot;, &quot;Catoprion&quot;, and &quot;Pristobrycon striolatus&quot;. &quot;Pygopristis&quot; was found to be more closely related to &quot;Catoprion&quot; than the other three piranha genera.

The total number of piranha species is unknown and contested, and new species continue to be described. Estimates range from fewer than 30 to more than 60.

==Distribution==
Piranhas are indigenous to the Amazon basin, in the Orinoco, in rivers of the Guianas, in the Paraguay–Paraná, and the São Francisco River systems, but there are major differences in the species richness. In a review where 38–39 piranha species were recognized, 25 were from the Amazon and 16 from Orinoco, while only three were present in Paraguay–Paraná and two in São Francisco. Most species are restricted to a single river system, but some (such as the red-bellied piranha) occur in several. Many species can occur together; for example, seven are found in Caño Maporal, a stream in Venezuela.

Aquarium piranhas have been unsuccessfully introduced into parts of the United States. In many cases, however, reported captures of piranhas are misidentifications of pacu (e.g., red-bellied pacu or &quot;Piaractus brachypomus&quot; is frequently misidentified as red-bellied piranha or &quot;Pygocentrus nattereri&quot;). Piranhas have also been discovered in the Kaptai Lake in southeast Bangladesh. Research is being carried out to establish how piranhas have moved to such distant corners of the world from their original habitat. Some rogue exotic fish traders are thought to have released them in the lake to avoid being caught by antipoaching forces. Piranhas were also spotted in the Lijiang River in China.

==Description==
===Size===
Depending on the exact species, most piranhas grow to between long. A few can grow larger, with the largest living species, the red-bellied, reaching up to . There are claims of São Francisco piranhas at up to , but the largest confirmed specimens are considerably smaller. The extinct &quot;Megapiranha&quot; which lived 8–10 million years ago reached about long, and possibly even .

===Morphology===
&quot;Serrasalmus&quot;, &quot;Pristobrycon&quot;, &quot;Pygocentrus&quot;, and &quot;Pygopristis&quot; are most easily recognized by their unique dentition. All piranhas have a single row of sharp teeth in both jaws. The teeth are tightly packed and interlocking (via small cusps) and are used for rapid puncture and shearing. Individual teeth are typically broadly triangular, pointed, and blade-like (flat in profile). The variation in the number of cusps is minor. In most species, the teeth are tricuspid with a larger middle cusp which makes the individual teeth appear markedly triangular. The exception is &quot;Pygopristis&quot;, which has pentacuspid teeth and a middle cusp usually only slightly larger than the other cusps.

===Biting abilities===
Piranhas have one of the strongest bites found in bony fishes. Relative to body mass, the black piranha (&quot;Serrasalmus rhombeus&quot;) produces one of the most forceful bites measured in vertebrates. This extremely powerful and dangerous bite is generated by large jaw muscles (adductor mandibulae) that are attached closely to the tip of the jaw, conferring the piranha with a mechanical advantage that favors force production over bite speed. Strong jaws combined with finely serrated teeth make them adept at tearing flesh.

==Ecology==

Piranhas vary extensively in ecology and behavior depending on exact species. Piranhas, especially the red-bellied (&quot;Pygocentrus nattereri&quot;), have a reputation as ferocious predators that hunt their prey in schools. Recent research, however, which &quot;started off with the premise that they school as a means of cooperative hunting&quot;, discovered they are timid fish that schooled for protection from their own predators, such as cormorants, caimans, and dolphins. Piranhas are &quot;basically like regular fish with large teeth&quot;. A few other species may also occur in large groups, while the remaining are solitary or found in small groups.

Although popularly described as highly predatory and primarily feeding on fish, piranha diets vary extensively, leading to their classification as omnivorous. In addition to fish (occasionally even their own species), documented food items for piranhas include other vertebrates (mammals, birds, reptiles), invertebrates (insects, crustaceans), fruits, seeds, leaves and detritus. The diet often shifts with age and size. Research on the species &quot;Serrasalmus&quot; aff. &quot;brandtii&quot; and &quot;Pygocentrus nattereri&quot; in Viana Lake in Maranhão, which is formed during the wet season when the Pindaré River (a tributary of the Mearim River) floods, has shown that they primarily feed on fish, but also eat vegetable matter. In another study of more than 250 &quot;Serrasalmus rhombeus&quot; at Ji-Paraná (Machado) River, 75% to 81% (depending on season) of the stomach content was fish, but about 10% was fruits or seeds. In a few species such as &quot;Serrasalmus serrulatus&quot;, the dietary split may be more equal, but this is less certain as based on smaller samples: Among 24 &quot;S. serrulatus&quot; from flooded forests of Ji-Paraná (Machado) River, there were several with fish remains in their stomachs, but half contained masticated seeds and in most of these this was the dominant item. Piranhas will often scavenge, and some species such as &quot;Serrasalmus elongatus&quot; are specialized scale-eaters, feeding primarily on scales and fins of other fish. Scale- and fin-eating is more widespread among juvenile and sub-adult piranhas.

Piranhas lay their eggs in pits dug during the breeding season and swim around to protect them. Newly hatched young feed on zooplankton, and eventually move on to small fish once large enough.

==Relationship with humans==


Piranha teeth are often used as tools themselves (such as for carving wood or cutting hair) or to modify other tools (such as sharpening of darts). This practice has been documented among several South American tribes including the Camayura and Shavante in Brazil and the Pacahuara in Bolivia.

Piranhas are also popular as food, being both eaten as a subsistence catch by fishers and sold at market. However, they are often considered a nuisance by fishers because they steal bait, eat catches, damage fishing gear, and may bite when accidentally caught.

Piranhas can be bought as pets in some areas, but they are illegal in many parts of the United States, and in the Philippines, where importers face six months to four years in jail, and the piranhas are destroyed to prevent proliferation.

The most common aquarium piranha is &quot;Pygocentrus nattereri&quot;, the red-bellied piranha. Piranhas can be bought fully grown or as young, often no larger than a thumbnail. It is important to keep &quot;Pygocentrus&quot; piranhas alone or in groups of four or more, not in pairs, since aggression among them is common, not allowing the weaker fish to survive, and is distributed more widely when kept in larger groups. It is not uncommon to find individual piranhas with one eye missing due to a previous attack.

===Attacks===
Although often described as extremely dangerous in the media, piranhas typically do not represent a serious risk to humans. However, attacks have occurred, especially when the piranhas are in a stressed situation such as the dense groups that may occur when the water is lower during the dry season and food is relatively scarce. Swimming near fishermen may increase the risk of attacks due to the commotion caused by struggling fish and the presence of bait in the water. Splashing attracts piranhas and for this reason children are more often attacked than adults. Being in the water when already injured or otherwise incapacitated also increases the risk. There are sometimes warning signs at high-risk locations and beaches in such areas are sometimes protected by a barrier.

Most piranha attacks on humans only result in minor injuries, typically to the feet or hands, but they are occasionally more serious and very rarely can be fatal. Near the city of Palmas in Brazil, 190 piranha attacks, all involving single bites to the feet, were reported in the first half of 2007 in an artificial lake which appeared after the damming of the Tocantins River. In the state of São Paulo, a series of attacks in 2009 in the Tietê River resulted in minor injuries to 15 people. In 2011, another series of attacks at José de Freitas in the Brazilian state of Piauí resulted in 100 people being treated for bites to their toes or heels. On 25 December 2013, more than 70 bathers were attacked at Rosario in Argentina, causing injuries to their hands or feet. In 2011, a drunk 18-year-old man was attacked and killed in Rosario del Yata, Bolivia. In 2012, a five-year-old Brazilian girl was attacked and killed by a shoal of &quot;P. nattereri&quot;. In January 2015, a six-year-old girl was found dead with signs of piranha bites on part of her body after her family canoe capsized during a vacation in Monte Alegre, Brazil. Whereas fatal attacks on humans are rare, piranhas will readily feed on bodies of people that already have died, such as drowning victims.

==Reputation==
Various stories exist about piranhas, such as how they can skeletonize a human body or cattle in seconds. These legends refer specifically to the red-bellied piranha.

Piranha solution, a dangerous mixture of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide known to aggressively dissolve organic material, draws its name from these legends surrounding the piranha fish.

A common falsehood is that they can be attracted by blood and are exclusively carnivores. A Brazilian legend called &quot;piranha cattle&quot; states that they sweep the rivers at high speed and attack the first of the cattle entering the water, allowing the rest of the group to traverse the river. These legends were dismissed through research by Hélder Queiroz and Anne Magurran and published in &quot;Biology Letters&quot;.

===Accounts from Theodore Roosevelt===
When former US president Theodore Roosevelt visited Brazil in 1913, he went on a hunting expedition through the Amazon Rainforest. While standing on the bank of the Amazon River, he witnessed a spectacle created by local fishermen. After blocking off part of the river and starving the piranhas for several days, they pushed a cow into the water, where it was quickly torn apart and skeletonized by a school of hungry piranhas. Roosevelt later described piranhas as vicious creatures in his 1914 book &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="301398" wikidata="Q6062422" url="?curid=301398" title="Iolair">
<text>Iolair (Gaelic for eagle) is a specialised semi-submersible offshore platform designed for BP to support and service oil platforms in the North Sea and served as an emergency support vessel (ESV) in the Forties Oil Field. Since 2000 it has been working in the Cantarell Field, Mexico as an offshore construction and maintenance service vessel operated by Cotemar S.A de C.V.

==Particulars==
&quot;Iolair&quot; is a self-propelled, twin hull, vessel and operates as a dynamically positioned (DP) construction support vessel. The vessel can operate up to a water depth of , is long and wide, and has 350 beds with single and double occupancy.

This unique vessel did not start as an ESV, but rather as the concept of a maintenance and support vessel (MSV). It was proposed for the Forties oil field, jointly owned by British National Oil Corporation and operated by BP Petroleum Development Company Ltd in the North Sea. A particular feature of the design by the Naval Architects was that there was no cross-bracing between the pontoons. Instead, the platform was given extra strength by a box-girder construction and diagonal bracing was arranged from the centre of the platform to the pontoons. This arrangement remained virtually unchanged to the build completion and offered exceptional speed when the vessel was de-ballasted on the surface. The intention was to achieve a rapid response to emergencies, wherever they might be experienced in the North Sea.

As an MSV, the vessel was always conceived to provide accommodation for about 220 persons, saturation diving facilities, a large workshop, craneage, and helicopter landing area with hangar and re-fueling. All were still featured in the eventual design but had been enhanced with other features and sophistication much of which was to support the emergency role. ESV incorporated novelty and ideas that were years ahead of their time. Indeed, part of the brief was that she should still be modern ten years after entering service.

The saturation diving system was equipped with an advanced launch and recovery system.

==History==

Designed by Victor Griffin Carrell and Eric Tim&#x27;s for BP. 
She was built by Scott Lithgow in Port Glasgow, and launched on 6 April 1981. In her early years, she was based in the BP Forties Oil Field.

In 1995, she was sold to U.S. drilling company Reading &amp; Bates. She was to be converted to a workover/well intervention vessel and was stationed West of Shetland. The modifications included removal of some of the top structures, removal of the fire-fighting systems, closing of the dive tube and wave surge tank. However the intended conversion was never carried out and she was heavily involved in the installation of subsea production equipment using Remote Operated Vehicles. She was also heavily involved in the commissioning of the Foinaven and Schiehallion floating production vessels.

In 2000 she left the UK oilfields and went to the Bay of Campeche, Mexico, working in the Cantarell Field. There she carries out construction and platform support work. She was sold in 2001 by Transocean, who had taken over Reading and Bates, then sold to Exeter Marine Ltd. and since 2017 is owned by Iolair Offshore Pte Ltd. and registered in the Marshall Islands, a long way from her original registered port of Dundee in Scotland.

==Industry firsts==
* Heave/swell compensation in the diving tube to enable operation in rougher weather.
* A &quot;Citadel&quot; area to which people could retire and survive if the vessel was engulfed in gas.
* A drenching system to cool exterior surfaces if the vessel was close to a burning platform. 
* The largest capacity and longest range firefighting monitors ever at sea.
* Fixed water-cannon on the after columns to cool the underside of production platforms.

&quot;Iolair&quot; is assured of its place in history by being the subject of a 28p commemorative stamp issued by Post Office Ltd. on 25 May 1983. This was one of a series of three stamps celebrating British Engineering Achievements.

<doc id="301399" wikidata="Q840197" url="?curid=301399" title="Candlemass (band)">
<text>Candlemass is a Swedish doom metal band formed in Upplands Väsby, a suburb of Stockholm, in 1984 by bassist, songwriter, and bandleader Leif Edling, alongside drummer Matz Ekström. The band has had a defining influence on doom metal, with the epic doom genre itself taking its name from their debut album &quot;Epicus Doomicus Metallicus&quot;. Along with Pentagram, Saint Vitus, and Trouble, Candlemass has been recognized as one of the &quot;big four of doom metal&quot;.

After releasing five full-length albums and extensively touring throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Candlemass disbanded in 1994 but reunited three years later. Following another breakup in 2002, the band reformed in 2004 and has continued to record and perform ever since.

== History == 
=== Debut with Johan Längqvist and the classic Messiah Marcolin era (1984–1990) === 
After the breakup of his first band, Nemesis, bassist Leif Edling formed Candlemass, recruiting session vocalist Johan Längqvist, drummer Matz Ekström, guitarist Mats &quot;Mappe&quot; Björkman, and Klas Bergwall. Their debut release, &quot;Epicus Doomicus Metallicus&quot; (1986), quickly established their reputation, securing their place within metal circles and marking a milestone in the doom metal scene. After the release of their debut album, Längqvist was replaced by Messiah Marcolin. By the time the band entered the studio to record their second album, &quot;Nightfall&quot;, in 1987, Bergwall and Ekström had left the group. Jan Lindh joined as the new drummer, and Lars Johansson was added on guitars following the completion of the album. 

Candlemass followed up with &quot;Ancient Dreams&quot; (1988) and &quot;Tales of Creation&quot; (1989). In 1990, they released the live album &quot;Live&quot;. Shortly afterward, internal disputes led to Messiah Marcolin&#x27;s departure from the band in 1991.

=== Vikström/Flodqvist albums, hiatus, and first reunion with Marcolin (1991–2003) === 
After Marcolin&#x27;s departure, Candlemass recruited vocalist Thomas Vikström and recorded &quot;Chapter VI&quot; (1992). The band toured to support the album, but by 1994, Candlemass had disbanded, partly due to the commercial failure of &quot;Chapter VI&quot;, and partly because Edling had formed a new project, Abstrakt Algebra. After Abstrakt Algebra failed to gain traction, Edling recruited a new lineup under the Candlemass name and recorded the album &quot;Dactylis Glomerata&quot;, which was a blend of material intended for a new Abstrakt Algebra album and new Candlemass songs. A year later, the album &quot;From the 13th Sun&quot; was released, both albums featuring vocalist Björn Flodqvist.

In 2002, a previous Candlemass lineup reunited and performed several well-received live shows, releasing another live album. Additionally, remastered versions of &quot;Epicus Doomicus Metallicus&quot;, &quot;Nightfall&quot;, &quot;Ancient Dreams&quot;, and &quot;Tales of Creation&quot; were issued, alongside a DVD titled &quot;Documents of Doom&quot;. The band began working on new material and recorded some songs while seeking a record label. However, internal differences resurfaced, leading to Candlemass disbanding again. In the interim, Leif Edling launched a new project, Krux, featuring former Abstrakt Algebra vocalist Mats Levén and two members of Entombed.

=== Second Marcolin reunion (2004–2006) === 
In November 2004, the band announced their second reunion. They recorded a new album, simply titled &quot;Candlemass&quot;, with the same lineup, and it was released in May 2005. The album earned them a Swedish Grammy that year.

In 2006, the band revealed plans for a new album, slated for release in 2007. However, in October 2006, after ongoing uncertainty surrounding Messiah Marcolin&#x27;s involvement, it was confirmed that he had left the band for good.

=== Robert Lowe era (2007–2012) ===
Candlemass found a new vocalist, Robert Lowe (Solitude Aeturnus), who recorded with the band on their ninth album, &quot;King of the Grey Islands&quot;, released on 22 June 2007. The album was self-produced, except for four songs produced by Andy Sneap.

In March 2008, Mats &quot;Mappe&quot; Björkman was sentenced to two years in prison for grand theft, having been convicted of stealing over 35,000 CDs and DVDs worth approximately 3 million SEK (around $500,000).

Candlemass worked on their tenth studio album in 2008, initially titled &quot;Hammer of Doom&quot;. However, they later renamed it &quot;Death Magic Doom&quot; to avoid conflict with a German festival of the same name. The album was originally scheduled for release on 27 March 2009 but was delayed until 3 April 2009. The band signed with the Austrian label Napalm Records in 2011, who released their eleventh studio album, &quot;Psalms for the Dead&quot;, in June 2012. Despite this, bassist Leif Edling stated that the band would not split up, but wanted to stop before they &quot;get too old and start putting out half-lame albums.&quot;

=== Mats Levén era (2012–2018) ===

On 2 June 2012, Candlemass announced via their website that Robert Lowe had left the band as vocalist, primarily due to concerns over the quality of live performances. The band described this as &quot;a very difficult decision.&quot; Lowe was replaced for the band&#x27;s upcoming shows by longtime friend and collaborator Mats Levén, known for his work with Yngwie Malmsteen, Therion, Treat, and At Vance among others. Levén had previously worked with Leif Edling in Abstrakt Algebra and Krux and had contributed vocals on demos for the &quot;Candlemass&quot; and &quot;King of the Grey Islands&quot; sessions, which are included in the box set &quot;Doomology&quot;. Additionally, keyboardist Per Wiberg (formerly of Opeth and Spiritual Beggars) joined the band on stage for these live performances.

In January 2013, Candlemass was voted the greatest Swedish hard rock/metal band of all time by the writers of &quot;Sweden Rock Magazine&quot;. They were featured in a list of the 100 greatest Swedish hard rock/metal bands of all time in a jubilee edition celebrating the magazine&#x27;s 100th issue. It was also revealed that Candlemass, along with death metal band Entombed (ranked No. 2 on the list), would perform together at a special jubilee concert in Stockholm, arranged by the magazine. 

Despite earlier claims that &quot;Psalms for the Dead&quot; would be their final album, bassist Leif Edling later indicated that he was open to recording new music with Candlemass. To coincide with the 30th anniversary of &quot;Epicus Doomicus Metallicus&quot;, Candlemass released the EP &quot;Death Thy Lover&quot; on 3 June 2016. Additionally, on 29 April 2016, the band released a career-spanning coffee-table book. The book also included two CDs featuring top picks by Leif Edling and Messiah Marcolin, a CD with rare tracks from their early career (including the &quot;Witchcraft&quot; demo), and two DVDs with three live performances.

=== Reunion with Johan Längqvist (2018–present) === 
On 3 September 2018, Candlemass announced the return of Längqvist to the band after a 32-year hiatus. The band stated, &quot;We wanted to find our way back to the roots of Candlemass, back to the soul and essence of the band. Johan Längqvist is back, and we hope this will give us some new energy and kickstart the heart of doom again. We don&#x27;t know if it will last 10 more years or even 5, but if it will give us just another year of having fun and playing the music that we love so much, it will be a blast! The circle is closed; Johan is back!&quot; The band also announced that they were recording a new album for a 2019 release, making it not only the first Candlemass studio album since 2012&#x27;s &quot;Psalms for the Dead&quot;, but their first with Längqvist since 1986&#x27;s &quot;Epicus Doomicus Metallicus&quot;. 

On 6 December 2018, Candlemass announced that their twelfth album would be titled &quot;The Door to Doom&quot; and would be released on 22 February 2019. It was also revealed that the album would feature a guest appearance by Black Sabbath&#x27;s Tony Iommi, who contributes a guitar solo to one of the album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;Astorolus – The Great Octopus&quot;. The band released an EP, &quot;The Pendulum&quot;, on 27 March 2020. Shortly after its release, Leif Edling said that Candlemass was unlikely to release their next studio album until 2022 or 2023. 

On 18 August 2022, the band announced their thirteenth studio album, &quot;Sweet Evil Sun&quot;, and the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Scandinavian Gods&quot;, was released on the same day. The album was released on 18 November.

Candlemass is expected to release a new EP, titled &quot;Black Star&quot;, in May 2025. The band will reunite with former singer Messiah Marcolin for the first time in nineteen years at the Rock Hard Festival in Athens, Greece on 12-13 September 2025.

== Style and influences == 
Candlemass is considered a doom metal band with a sound described as exhibiting &quot;dirge-like, sustain-laden guitar riffing&quot;. Candlemass&#x27; musical style is significantly influenced by early Black Sabbath. Edling, the band&#x27;s main songwriter and sole constant member, has drawn inspiration from Black Sabbath, as well as from bands such as Blue Öyster Cult, Mercyful Fate/King Diamond, Bachman–Turner Overdrive, Rush, Nazareth, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Judas Priest, Motörhead, and Venom.

==Legacy==
Candlemass are considered pioneers of the doom metal subgenre of heavy metal, and the group&#x27;s 1986 debut album &quot;Epicus Doomicus Metallicus&quot; played a part in coining the genre&#x27;s name. Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic said Candlemass &quot;helped reintroduce the lumbering power chords of Black Sabbath to an entire generation of post-New Wave of British Heavy Metal and post-thrash metalheads, almost single-handedly writing the handbook for the modern doom metal movement in the process.&quot;

<text>The Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) is a rapid transit system in the northeastern New Jersey cities of Newark, Harrison, Jersey City, and Hoboken, as well as Lower and Midtown Manhattan in New York City. It is operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. PATH trains run around the clock year-round; four routes serving 13 stations operate during the daytime on weekdays, while two routes operate during weekends, late nights, and holidays. It crosses the Hudson River through cast iron tunnels that rest on a bed of silt on the river bottom. It operates as a deep-level subway in Manhattan and the Jersey City/Hoboken riverfront; from Grove Street in Jersey City to Newark, trains run in open cuts, at grade level, and on elevated track. In , the system saw rides, or about per weekday in , making it the fifth-busiest rapid transit system in the United States.

The routes of the PATH system were originally operated by the Hudson &amp; Manhattan Railroad (H&amp;M), built to link New Jersey&#x27;s Hudson Waterfront with New York City. The system began operations in 1908 and was fully completed in 1911. Three stations have since closed; two others were relocated after a re-alignment of the western terminus. From the 1920s, the rise of automobile travel and the concurrent construction of bridges and tunnels across the river sent the H&amp;M into a financial decline during the Great Depression, from which it never recovered, and it was forced into bankruptcy in 1954. As part of the deal that cleared the way for the construction of the original World Trade Center, the Port Authority bought the H&amp;M out of receivership in 1962 and renamed it PATH. In the 2000s and 2010s, the system suffered longstanding interruptions from disasters that affected the New York metropolitan area, most notably the September 11 attacks and Hurricane Sandy. Both private and public stakeholders have proposed expanding PATH service in New Jersey, and an extension to Newark Liberty International Airport may be constructed in the 2020s.

Although PATH has long operated as a rapid transit system, it is legally a commuter railroad under the jurisdiction of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). Its right-of-way between Jersey City and Newark is located in close proximity to Conrail, NJ Transit, and Amtrak trackage, and it shares the Dock Bridge with intercity and commuter trains. All PATH train operators must therefore be licensed railroad engineers, and extra inspections are required. , PATH uses one class of rolling stock, the PA5.

== History ==

=== Hudson &amp; Manhattan Railroad ===
The PATH system pre-dates the New York City Subway&#x27;s first underground line, operated by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company. The Hudson &amp; Manhattan Railroad (H&amp;M) was planned in 1874, but it was not possible at that time to safely tunnel under the Hudson River. Construction began on the existing tunnels in 1890, but soon stopped when funding ran out. It resumed in 1900 under the direction of William Gibbs McAdoo, an ambitious young lawyer who had moved to New York from Chattanooga, Tennessee, and later became president of the H&amp;M. The railroad became so closely associated with McAdoo that, in its early years, its lines were called the McAdoo Tubes or McAdoo Tunnels.

==== Construction ====
Construction started on the first tunnel, now called the Uptown Hudson Tubes, in 1873. Chief engineer Dewitt Haskin built the tunnel by using compressed air to open a space in the mud and then lining it with brick. The railroad got from Jersey City this way until a lawsuit stopped work; accidents, including a particularly serious one in 1880 that killed 20 workers, caused additional delays. The project was abandoned in 1883 due to a lack of funds. An effort by a British company, between 1888 and 1892, also failed.

When the New York and New Jersey Railroad Company resumed construction on the uptown tubes in 1902, its chief engineer, Charles M. Jacobs, used a different method. He had workers push a tunnelling shield through the mud and then place tubular cast iron plating around the tube. The northern tube of the uptown tunnel was completed this way shortly after work resumed and the southern tube was built the same way. The uptown tubes were completed in 1906.

By the end of 1904, the New York City Board of Rapid Transit Commissioners had given the company permission to build a new subway line through Midtown Manhattan to connect with the Uptown Hudson Tubes, along with 26 years of exclusive rights to the line. The Midtown Manhattan line would travel eastward under Christopher Street before turning northeastward under Sixth Avenue, then continue underneath Sixth Avenue to a terminus at 33rd Street.

In January 1905, the Hudson Companies, with $21 million in capital ($ in ), were incorporated to complete the Uptown Hudson Tubes and build the Sixth Avenue line, as well as construct a second pair of tunnels, the current Downtown Hudson Tubes. The H&amp;M was incorporated in December 1906 to operate a passenger railroad system between New York and New Jersey via the Uptown and Downtown Tubes.

The current Downtown Hudson Tubes were built about south of the first one. Three years of construction using the tubular cast iron method finished in 1909. The uptown and downtown tunnels had two tubes, each with a single unidirectional track. The eastern sections of the tunnels, in Manhattan, were built with the cut and cover method.

==== Opening ====
Test runs of empty trains started in late 1907. Revenue service started between Hoboken Terminal and 19th Street at midnight on February 26, 1908, when President Theodore Roosevelt pressed a button at the White House that turned on the electric lines in the uptown tubes (the first train carrying passengers, all selected officials, had run the previous day). This became part of the current Hoboken–33rd Street line. The H&amp;M system was powered by a 650-volt direct current third rail which, in turn, drew power from an 11,000-volt transmission system with three substations. The substations were the Jersey City Powerhouse, as well as two smaller substations at the Christopher Street and Hudson Terminal stations.

An extension of the H&amp;M from 19th Street to 23rd Street opened in June 1908. In July 1909, service began between the Hudson Terminal in Lower Manhattan and Exchange Place in Jersey City, through the downtown tubes. The connection between Exchange Place and the junction near Hoboken Terminal opened two weeks later, forming the basic route for the Hoboken-Hudson Terminal (now Hoboken–World Trade Center) line. A new line running between 23rd Street and Hudson Terminal was created in September. Almost a year after that, the H&amp;M was extended from Exchange Place west to Grove Street, and the 23rd Street–Hudson Terminal line was rerouted to Grove Street, becoming part of the current Journal Square–33rd Street line. A fourth line, Grove Street–Hudson Terminal (now the Newark–World Trade Center line), was also created. In November 1910, the Hoboken–23rd Street and Grove Street–23rd Street lines were extended from 23rd Street to 33rd Street.

The Grove Street–Hudson Terminal line was extended west from Grove Street to Manhattan Transfer in October 1911, and then to Park Place in Newark on November 26 of that year. After completion of the uptown Manhattan extension to 33rd Street and the westward extension to the now-defunct Manhattan Transfer and Park Place Newark terminus in 1911, the H&amp;M was complete. The final cost was estimated at $55–$60 million ($ - $ in ). A stop at Summit Avenue (now Journal Square), located between Grove Street and Manhattan Transfer, opened in April 1912 as an infill station on the Newark-Hudson Terminal line, though only one platform was in use at the time. The station was completed by February 1913, allowing service from 33rd Street to terminate there. The last station, at Harrison, opened a month later.

==== External relations and unbuilt expansions ====

Originally, the Hudson Tubes were designed to link three major railroad terminals on the Hudson River in New Jersey—the Erie Railroad (Erie) and Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in Jersey City and the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&amp;W) in Hoboken—with New York City. While PATH still connects to train stations in Hoboken and Newark, the Erie&#x27;s Pavonia Terminal at what is now Newport and the PRR terminal at Exchange Place station have been closed and demolished. There were early negotiations for New York Penn Station to also be shared by the two railroads. In 1908, McAdoo proposed to build a branch of the H&amp;M southward to the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal at Communipaw.

When the rapid transit commissioners approved construction of the H&amp;M&#x27;s Sixth Avenue line in 1904, they left open the option of digging an east-west crosstown line. The New York and New Jersey Railroad Company received perpetual rights to dig under Christopher and Ninth Streets eastward to either Second Avenue or Astor Place. The project was started but soon abandoned; about of the tube that was dug still exists.

In February 1909 the H&amp;M announced plans to extend its Uptown Tubes northeast to Grand Central Terminal, located at Park Avenue and 42nd Street. The openings of the 28th and 33rd Street stations were delayed because of planning for the Grand Central extension. &quot;The New York Times&quot; speculated that the downtown tunnels would see more passenger use than the uptown tunnels because they better served the city&#x27;s financial district.

The Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT), a competitor to the H&amp;M, proposed to connect its Lexington Avenue line to the H&amp;M at Grand Central, Astor Place, and Fulton Street–Hudson Terminal once the planned system was complete. Its terminus at Grand Central was supposed to be located directly below the IRT&#x27;s 42nd Street line but above the IRT&#x27;s Steinway Tunnel to Queens. However, the IRT constructed an unauthorized ventilation shaft between its two levels in an effort to force the H&amp;M to build its station very deeply, making it less accessible. As an alternative, it was proposed to connect the Uptown Tubes to the Steinway Tunnel. A franchise to extend the Uptown Tubes to Grand Central was awarded in June 1909.

By 1914, the H&amp;M had not yet started construction of the Grand Central extension, and requested a delay. Six years later, the H&amp;M had submitted 17 applications for delays; in all of them, the railroad said it was not the best time for construction. The Rapid Transit Commissioners declined the last one, effectively ending the H&amp;M&#x27;s rights to a Grand Central extension.

In September 1910, McAdoo proposed another expansion, consisting of a second north-south line through midtown. It would run from Hudson Terminal to 33rd Street and Sixth Avenue, underneath Herald Square and near the H&amp;M&#x27;s existing 33rd Street station. The new line would run mainly under Broadway, with a small section of the line in the south under Church Street. Under McAdoo&#x27;s plan, the city could take ownership of this line within 25 years of completion.

That November, McAdoo also proposed that the two-track Broadway line be tied into the IRT&#x27;s original subway line in Lower Manhattan. The Broadway line, going southbound, would merge with the local tracks of the IRT&#x27;s Lexington Avenue line in the southbound direction at 10th Street. A spur off the Lexington Avenue line in Lower Manhattan, in the back of Trinity Church, would split eastward under Wall Street, cross the East River to Brooklyn, then head down Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn, with another spur underneath Lafayette Avenue. McAdoo wanted not only to operate what was then called the &quot;Triborough System&quot;, but also the chance to bid on the Fourth Avenue line in the future. The franchise for the Broadway line was ultimately awarded to the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) in 1913, as part of the Dual Contracts.

In 1909, McAdoo considered extending the H&amp;M in New Jersey, building a branch north to Montclair, in Essex County. A route extending north from Newark would continue straight to East Orange. From there, branches would split to South Orange in the south and Montclair in the north.

==== Decline and bankruptcy ====
A record 113 million people rode the H&amp;M in 1927. Ridership declined after the opening of the Holland Tunnel late that year and fell further once the Great Depression began. The opening of the George Washington Bridge in 1931 and the Lincoln Tunnel in 1937 drew more riders out of trains and into their cars. The Summit Avenue station was renovated and rededicated as &quot;Journal Square&quot; in 1929; the railroad&#x27;s powerhouse in Jersey City shut down later that year, as its system could now draw energy from the greater power grid.

In the 1930s, service to the Uptown Hudson Tubes in Manhattan was affected by the construction of the Independent Subway System (IND)&#x27;s Sixth Avenue Line. The 33rd Street terminal closed in late 1937; service on the H&amp;M was cut back to 28th Street to allow for subway construction. The 33rd Street terminal was moved south to 32nd Street and reopened in 1939. The city had to pay the railroad $800,000 to build the new 33rd Street station; it reimbursed H&amp;M an additional $300,000 for lost revenue. The 28th Street station was closed at this time as unnecessary since the southern entrances to the 33rd Street terminal were only two blocks away; it was later demolished to make room for the IND tracks below.

The Manhattan Transfer station was closed in mid-1937, and the H&amp;M realigned to Newark Penn Station from the Park Place terminus a quarter-mile () north; the Harrison station across the Passaic River was moved several blocks south as a result. The upper level of the Centre Street Bridge to Park Place later became Route 158.

Promotions and other advertising failed to stem the financial decline of the H&amp;M. The 19th Street station in Manhattan was closed in 1954. That year, the H&amp;M entered receivership due to its constant losses. It operated under bankruptcy protection; in 1956 the two states agreed to settle its unpaid back taxes for $1.9 million. That year, the H&amp;M saw 37 million annual passengers, and transportation experts called for subsidies. One expert proposed a &quot;rail loop&quot;, with the Uptown Hudson Tubes connecting to the IND Sixth Avenue Line, then continuing up Sixth Avenue and west via a new tunnel to Weehawken, New Jersey. By 1958, ridership had dropped to 30.46 million annual passengers. Two years later, creditors approved a reorganization plan. During this time, H&amp;M workers went on strike twice over wages: for two days in 1953, and for a month in 1957.
=== Port Authority takeover ===

In the early 1960s, planning for the World Trade Center resulted in a compromise between the Port Authority and the state governments of New York and New Jersey. The Port Authority agreed to purchase and maintain the Tubes in return for the rights to build the World Trade Center on the footprint of H&amp;M&#x27;s Hudson Terminal, which was the Lower Manhattan terminus of the Tubes. A formal agreement was made in January 1962; four months later, the Port Authority set up two wholly owned subsidiaries: the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation (PATH) to operate the H&amp;M lines, as well as another subsidiary to operate the World Trade Center. All of the Port Authority&#x27;s operations would have been subjected to federal Interstate Commerce Commission rules if it ran the trains directly, but with the creation of the PATH Corporation, only the subsidiary&#x27;s operations would be federally regulated.

In September, the Port Authority formally took over the H&amp;M Railroad and the Tubes, rebranding the system as Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH). Upon taking over the H&amp;M, the PANYNJ spent $70 million to modernize the system&#x27;s infrastructure ($ in ). The PANYNJ also repainted H&amp;M stations into the new PATH livery. In 1964, the authority ordered 162 PA1 railway cars to replace the H&amp;M rolling stock, much of which dated to 1909. The first PA1 cars were delivered in 1965. Subsequently, the agency ordered 44 PA2 cars in 1967 and 46 PA3 cars in 1972.

===Late 20th century===
==== 1970s ====
As part of the World Trade Center&#x27;s construction, the Port Authority decided to demolish Hudson Terminal and construct a new World Trade Center Terminal. Groundbreaking took place in 1966. During excavation and construction, the original Downtown Hudson Tubes remained in service as elevated tunnels. The new terminal, west of the Hudson Terminal, opened in 1971. It cost $35 million to build, and saw 85,000 daily passengers at the time of its opening. Hudson Terminal was then shut down.

The Journal Square Transportation Center opened in 1973, consolidating operations in the 10-story building that is part of the complex.

In January 1973, the Port Authority released plans to double the route mileage of the PATH system with an extension from Newark Penn Station to Plainfield, New Jersey. A stop at Elizabeth would allow PATH to serve Newark Airport, where passengers could transfer to a people mover serving the terminals. Preliminary studies of the right-of-way, as well as a design contract, were conducted that year. The extension was approved in 1975. The Federal Urban Mass Transit Administration was less enthusiastic about the extension&#x27;s efficacy and reluctant to give the Port Authority the $322 million it had requested for the project, about 80% of the projected cost. Eventually, the administration agreed to back it, but in 1977, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the two state legislatures had violated the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s Contract Clause by repealing a covenant in the 1962 bond agreements in order to make the extension possible. In June 1978, the extension, by then estimated to cost $600 million ($ in ), was canceled in favor of improving bus service in New Jersey.

==== Strikes ====
Labor problems also beset PATH during this time. After a January 1973 strike over salary increases was averted, talks failed and workers walked out in April. A month into the strike, negotiations broke down again; the union returned to work in June.

The 1980 New York City transit strike suspended service on the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA)&#x27;s bus and subway routes for 10 days. A special PATH route ran from 33rd Street to World Trade Center via Midtown Manhattan, Pavonia–Newport, and Exchange Place during the NYCTA strike. PATH motormen also threatened to go on strike during this time for different reasons. The special service was suspended in April after some workers refused overtime.

In June 1980, PATH workers again went on strike for higher pay, their first such action since 1973. During the strike, moisture built up in the tunnels and rust accumulated on the tracks; pumps in the underwater tunnels remained in operation, preventing the tubes from flooding. Alternative service across the Hudson River was provided by &quot;inadequate&quot; shuttle buses through the Holland Tunnel. The 81-day strike was the longest in PATH&#x27;s history.

==== 1980s and 1990s ====
Substantial growth in PATH ridership during the 1980s required expansion and improvement of the railroad&#x27;s infrastructure. The Port Authority announced a plan in 1988 that would allow stations on the Newark–WTC line to accommodate longer eight-car trains while seven-car trains could operate between Journal Square and 33rd Street. Two years later, it announced a $1 billion plan to renovate the PATH stations and add new cars. Video monitors were installed in stations to make money from advertising. PATH also sought a fare hike, even though that would reduce its per passenger subsidy, to reduce its $135 million annual deficit. By 1992, the Port Authority had spent $900 million on infrastructure improvements, including repairing tracks, modernizing communications and signaling, replacing ventilation equipment, and installing elevators at seven stations per the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).

A $225 million car maintenance facility was opened in Harrison in 1990. It replaced PATH&#x27;s old Henderson Street Yard—a below-grade, open-air train storage yard at the northeast corner of Marin Boulevard and Christopher Columbus Drive just east of the Grove Street station.

High tides from the December 1992 nor&#x27;easter flooded the PATH tunnels, including a section between Hoboken and Pavonia. Most trains were stopped before reaching the floods, but one became stalled near Hoboken Terminal. Some water pumps within the system were overwhelmed. The Newark–World Trade Center service was not disrupted afterwards, but the Journal Square–33rd Street service was slowed because several spots along the route needed to be pumped out. Service to Hoboken was suspended for 10 days, the longest disruption since the summer 1980 strike.

A section of ceiling in the World Trade Center PATH station collapsed and trapped dozens during the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; the station itself did not suffer any structural damage. Within three days, PATH service to the station resumed.

In the summer of 1993, the Port Authority banned tobacco advertisements in all trains and stations. A new wash for cars opened in mid-September 1993 in Jersey City, replacing the one at the 33rd Street terminal. In April 1994, an ADA-compliant entrance to the Exchange Place station was opened. Two years later, three trains began running express on the Newark–World Trade Center service for six months, cutting running time by 3 minutes. Weekend Hoboken–World Trade Center service began in October 1996 on a six-month trial basis, and the express Newark–World Trade Center service was made permanent on the same day.

=== 21st century ===
==== September 11, 2001, and recovery ====

The World Trade Center station in Lower Manhattan, under the World Trade Center, one of PATH&#x27;s two New York terminals, was destroyed during the September 11 attacks, when the Twin Towers above it collapsed. Just prior to the collapse, the station was closed and all passengers evacuated. Service to Lower Manhattan was suspended indefinitely. Exchange Place, the next-to-last station before World Trade Center, had to be closed as well because trains could not turn around there; it had also suffered severe water damage. A temporary PATH terminal at the World Trade Center was approved in December 2001 and projected to open in two years. Shortly after the attacks, the Port Authority started operating two uptown services: Newark–33rd Street and Hoboken–33rd Street, and one intrastate New Jersey service, Hoboken–Journal Square. A single nighttime service was instituted: Newark–33rd Street (via Hoboken).

In the meantime, modifications were made to a stub end tunnel to allow trains from Newark to reach the Hoboken-bound tunnel and vice versa. The modifications required PATH to bore through the bedrock between the stub tunnel and the Newark tunnels. The stub, the &quot;Penn Pocket&quot;, had been built to take PRR commuters from Harborside Terminal on short turn World Trade Center to Exchange Place runs. The new Exchange Place station opened in June 2003. Because of the original alignment of the tracks, trains to or from Hoboken used separate tunnels from the Newark service. Eastbound trains from Newark crossed over to the westbound track just west of Exchange Place, where they reversed direction and used a crossover switch to go to Hoboken. Eastbound trains from Hoboken entered on the eastbound track at Exchange Place, then reversing direction and used the same crossover switch to get on the westbound track to Newark before entering Grove Street.

PATH service to Lower Manhattan was restored when a new, $323 million second station opened in November 2003; the inaugural train was the same one that had been used for the evacuation. The second, temporary station contained portions of the original station, but did not have heating or air conditioning. The temporary entrance was closed in July 2007, then demolished to make way for the third, permanent station; around the same time, the Church Street entrance opened. A new entrance on Vesey Street opened in March 2008; the Church entrance was demolished.
The construction of the permanent four-platform World Trade Center Transportation Hub started in July 2008, when the first prefabricated &quot;ribs&quot; for the pedestrian walkway under Fulton Street were installed. Platform A, the first part of the permanent station, opened in February 2014, serving Hoboken-bound riders. Platform B and the remaining half of Platform A opened in May 2015. The hub formally opened in March 2016 with part of the headhouse. Platforms C and D, the last two, were opened that September.

====Hurricane Sandy====
In the early morning hours of October 29, 2012, all PATH service was suspended in advance of Hurricane Sandy. The following day, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced that PATH service would be out for 7–10 days due to the storm damage. Storm surge from the hurricane caused significant flooding to the Hoboken and Jersey City stations, as well as at the World Trade Center. An image captured by a PATH security camera showing water flowing into Hoboken during the storm went viral online and became one of several representative images of the hurricane. The first PATH trains after the hurricane were the Journal Square–33rd Street service, which resumed on November 6 and ran only in daytime. Service was extended west to Harrison and Newark on November 12, in place of the Newark–World Trade Center service. Christopher Street and Ninth Street were reopened during the weekend of November 17–18, but remained closed for five days afterward. Normal weekday service on the Newark–World Trade Center and Journal Square–33rd Street lines resumed on November 26. On weekends, trains operated using the Newark–33rd Street service pattern.

The PATH station at Hoboken Terminal suffered major damage after floodwaters as high as submerged the tunnels; it was closed for several weeks for $300 million worth of repairs. The Newark–33rd Street route was suspended for two weekends in mid-December, with the Newark–World Trade Center running in its place, in order to expedite the return of Hoboken service. Hoboken Terminal reopened in December for weekday daytime Hoboken–33rd Street service, followed by the resumption of weekday 24-hour PATH service in early 2013. The Hoboken–World Trade Center trains resumed in late January, and all normal service was restored by March. The Downtown Hudson Tubes were severely damaged by Sandy. As a result, to accommodate repairs, service on the Newark–World Trade Center line between Exchange Place and World Trade Center was to be suspended during almost all weekends, except for holidays, in 2019 and 2020. However, weekend service was restored in June 2020, six months ahead of schedule.

====2010s improvements====
The Port Authority began rebuilding the Harrison station in 2009. It has longer and wider platforms to allow 10-car trains; street-level-to-platform elevators within the platform extensions, in compliance with the ADA, and architectural modifications. The westbound platform of the new Harrison station opened to the public in October 2018 and the eastbound one the following June.

In January 2010, Christopher O. Ward, as executive director, announced that PATH would be spending $321 million on communications-based train control (CBTC) with Siemens&#x27; Trainguard MT, upgrading its signal system for an increase in ridership. CBTC would replace a four-decade old fixed-block signaling system. It would reduce the headway time between trains, allowing more to run during rush hours. At the same time, the entire PATH fleet was replaced with 340 CBTC-equipped PA5 cars, built by Kawasaki Railcar. The original contract was completed in 2011; additional cars were delivered in subsequent years. PATH&#x27;s goal was to increase passenger capacity from 240,000 passengers a day to 290,000. The entire CBTC system was originally expected to become operational in 2017. The Port Authority also spent $659 million to upgrade 13 platforms on the Newark–World Trade Center line to accommodate 10-car trains; until then, the line could only run eight-car trains.

Along with CBTC, PATH began installing positive train control (PTC), another safety system, during the 2010s, per a Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) mandate that all American railroads have it by the end of 2018. The Newark–World Trade Center line west of Journal Square was converted to PTC in April 2018, followed by the segments of track east of Journal Square the following month. This caused delays across the entire system when train operators had to slow down and manually adjust their trains to switch between the two signaling systems. PTC was tested on the Uptown Hudson Tubes from July to October 2018, forcing weekend closures. PTC was finished in November 2018, a month ahead of schedule; and the entire system was converted by December.

The Port Authority also installed two amenities in all PATH stations. Cellphone service was added for all customers by early 2019. Countdown clocks, displaying the time the next train arrives, were installed in all PATH stations that year. Subsequently, in June 2019, the Port Authority released the PATH Improvement Plan, calling for over $1 billion in investments, including $80 million to extend Newark–World Trade Center line platforms, as well as funding for two ongoing projects: $752.6 million to complete the CBTC system by 2022 and $215.7 million on the new PA5 cars by 2022. The goal is to increase train frequencies on the Newark-World Trade Center line by 40 percent, and 20 percent on other lines, during rush hours. Every train on the Newark–World Trade Center line would be nine cars long. In addition, the platform at Grove Street would be extended eastward, at the Marin Boulevard end of the station, and two additional cross-corridors would be added at Exchange Place. The Port Authority would also allocate funds to study the implementation of 10-car trains. In September 2019, service on the Newark–World Trade Center and Journal Square–33rd Street lines would be increased by 10 percent during rush hours, reducing the headway between trains from four minutes to three.

====2020s====
In 2019, the last year before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the PATH carried an average of 284,000 people per day. The second quarter of 2020, which included the nadir of COVID-19 pandemic across the New York metropolitan area, was the worst quarter in PATH&#x27;s history, with a $777 million decline in revenues throughout all of the PANYNJ&#x27;s facility and a specific ridership decline of 94 percent on the PATH system. Train service returned to 96 percent of 2019 levels in June 2020, yet ridership continued to lag far below pre-pandemic numbers, rebounding to only 60 percent of 2019 ridership by February 2022. Amid the spread of the Omicron variant, PANYNJ was projected to reach $3 billion in pandemic losses by March 2022. The platform-lengthening project was finished the same year. In February 2023, it was announced that nine-car operation on the Newark–World Trade Center line would begin the next month; nine-car trains began operating on March 22, 2023.

PANYNJ commissioners voted in late 2023 to spend $230 million replacing some wheel sets on the PA5 fleet and replacing tracks on the New Jersey side. In 2024, the PANYNJ announced that it would spend $430 million to refurbish four stations and replace railroad switches as part of the PATH Forward program. In addition, the agency announced that the Hoboken Terminal station will be closed and extensively refurbished during February 2025.

=== Proposed expansions ===

====Newark Airport extension proposals====
In the mid-2000s, a Newark Airport extension was again considered as the Port Authority allocated $31 million for a feasibility study of extending service from Newark Penn Station, estimated at that time to cost $500 million; the study began in 2012. In September 2013, &quot;Crain&#x27;s&quot; reported that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie would publicly support the extension, estimated by then to cost $1 billion. The governor asked that the airport&#x27;s largest operator, United Airlines, consider flying to Atlantic City International Airport as an enticement to further the project.
In February 2014, the Port Authority&#x27;s Board of Commissioners approved a 10-year capital plan that included the PATH extension to NJ Transit&#x27;s Newark Liberty International Airport Station. The alignment would follow the existing Northeast Corridor approximately one mile (1.6 km) further south to the Newark Airport station, where a connection to AirTrain Newark is available. Five years of construction were expected to begin in 2018.

In late 2014, there were calls for a reconsideration of Port Authority funding priorities. The PATH extension followed the route of existing Manhattan-to-Newark Airport train service (on NJ Transit&#x27;s Northeast Corridor Line and North Jersey Coast Line as well as Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Keystone Service&quot; and &quot;Northeast Regional&quot;). On the other hand, there was no funding for either the Gateway Tunnel, a pair of commuter train tunnels that would supplement the North River Tunnels under the Hudson, or the replacement for the Port Authority Bus Terminal. In December 2014, the PANYNJ awarded a three-year, $6 million contract to infrastructure design firm HNTB to do a cost analysis of the Newark Airport extension.

In 2017, the PANYNJ released a 10-year capital plan that included $1.7 billion for the extension; at the time, construction was projected to start in 2020, with service in 2025. A presentation at two December 2017 public meetings showed the new PATH station would include a park-and-ride lot and a new entrance from the nearby Dayton neighborhood. An extension of the PATH to Newark Airport was still being considered in mid-2022, but the PANYNJ announced in March 2023 that it was deferring funding for the Newark Airport extension to a future capital plan.

====Marion station proposal====

West of Journal Square in Jersey City, the NWK-WTC line runs through the Marion Section parallel to the Conrail Passaic and Harsimus Line freight line. A pedestrian bridge crosses the tracks. Since the 1980s, there have been calls for an infill station to be built there. In 2018, the government of Jersey City and the PANYNJ reached an agreement that included a feasibility study for a potential station, which resulted in the &quot;Marion PATH Station Physical Feasibility Study&quot;. The senior U.S. Senator, the Hudson County Executive, and the Mayor of Jersey City have written letters encouraging the PANYNJ to continue with the project. The estimated cost of construction varies and could be funded by nearby real estate developers.

== Route operation ==

PATH operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. During weekday hours, PATH operates four train services, direct descendants of the four original services operated by the H&amp;M, using three terminals in New Jersey and two in Manhattan. During late nights, weekends, and holidays, PATH operates two services from two terminals in New Jersey and two in Manhattan.

Each line is represented by a unique color on timetables and service maps, which also corresponds to the color of the marker lights on the front of trains. The Journal Square–33rd Street (via Hoboken) service is the only line represented by two colors (yellow and blue), since it is a late-night/weekend/holiday combination of PATH&#x27;s two midtown services, Journal Square–33rd Street and Hoboken–33rd Street. During peak hours, trains operate every four to eight minutes on each service. Every PATH station except Newark and Harrison is served by a train every two to three minutes, for a peak-hour service of 20–30 trains per hour.

, PATH saw 81.7 million passengers. , the system is used by over 283,000 passengers per weekday; almost 105,000 per Saturday; 75,000 per Sunday; and 94,000 per holiday. The busiest station is World Trade Center, whose 46,000 average passengers per day is over 10 times the daily traffic of Christopher Street, the least busy station. Ridership in 2018 was down by around a million compared to 2017 but it was still nearly a record for PATH operation, having increased 10 million from 2013.

These levels of ridership notwithstanding, PATH runs at a deficit, losing about $400 million per year. While some of its recent improvements, particularly in Harrison, have spurred local development, it cannot benefit from that directly as the Port Authority is limited to the revenue it makes from the fees, fares, and tolls it collects, with the state and local governments collecting the sales, income and property taxes arising from development. Its costs are correspondingly increased by having to comply with FRA regulations. PATH is thus subsidized by the Port Authority from surpluses at its airports and seaports.

=== Services ===
The PATH system has of route mileage, counting route overlaps only once. During the daytime on weekdays, four services operate:
* Newark–World Trade Center, also known as NWK-WTC
* Hoboken–World Trade Center, or HOB-WTC
* Journal Square–33rd Street, or JSQ-33
* Hoboken–33rd Street, or HOB-33

Between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Monday to Friday, and all-day Saturday, Sunday, and holidays, PATH operates two train services:
* Newark–World Trade Center
* Journal Square–33rd Street (via Hoboken), or JSQ-33 (via HOB)

Prior to 2006, Hoboken–World Trade Center and Journal Square–33rd Street services were offered on Saturday, Sunday, and holidays between 9 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. In April 2006, these services were indefinitely discontinued at those times and replaced with the Journal Square–33rd Street (via Hoboken) service. During off-peak hours, passengers wanting to travel from Hoboken to Lower Manhattan were told to take the Journal Square–33rd Street (via Hoboken) service to Grove Street and transfer to the Newark–World Trade Center train.

PATH does not normally operate directly from Newark to Midtown Manhattan. Passengers wanting to travel from Newark to Midtown via PATH are told to transfer to the Journal Square-33rd Street service at Journal Square or Grove Street. However, after both the September 11 attacks and Hurricane Sandy, special Newark–33rd Street services were operated to compensate for the complete loss of service to Lower Manhattan. An intrastate Journal Square–Hoboken service was also operated after the attacks. The Journal Square–Hoboken and Newark–33rd Street services instituted after the attacks were canceled by 2003.

From July to October 2018, because of PTC installation on the Uptown Hudson Tubes, the Journal Square–33rd Street (via Hoboken) service was suspended on most weekends. In the meantime, it was replaced by the Journal Square–World Trade Center (via Hoboken) and the restored Journal Square–Hoboken services, since all stations between Christopher and 33rd Streets were closed during the weekends.

Lengths of trains on all lines except the Newark–World Trade Center line are limited to seven cars, since the platforms at Hoboken, Christopher Street, Ninth Street, and 33rd Street can only accommodate seven cars and cannot be extended. In 2009, the Port Authority started upgrading platforms along the Newark–World Trade Center line so that it could accommodate 10-car trains. That line has accommodated nine-car trains in 2023, eight-car trains being the prior.

=== Station list ===
All New Jersey stations, as well as the World Trade Center and 33rd Street terminals in New York, are compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Harrison, the last non-accessible station in New Jersey, was made fully accessible in 2019. The only non-accessible stations are the four intermediate stations on the Manhattan side of the Uptown Tubes–Christopher Street, Ninth Street, 14th Street, and 23rd Street.

== Fares ==

The Port Authority charges a single flat fee to ride the PATH system, regardless of distance traveled. , single-ride fares and two-trip tickets charge $3.00 per trip; 10-trip, 20-trip, and 40-trip cards charge $2.85 per trip; a single-day unlimited, $11.50; a seven-day unlimited, $39.25; and a 30-day unlimited, $120.75. A senior SmartLink costs $1.50 per trip. Single ride tickets are valid for two hours from time of purchase. While some PATH stations are adjacent to or connected to New York City Subway, Newark Light Rail, Hudson-Bergen Light Rail, and NJ Transit commuter rail stations, there are no free transfers between these different, independently run transit systems. PATH began testing out a new contactless payment system called TAPP, similar to MTA&#x27;s OMNY system, at some stations in December 2023. TAPP readers accept only debit and credit cards and digital wallets; the SmartLink cards and OMNY are not compatible with the readers.

=== History ===
==== Tier-based fares ====
The H&amp;M used a tier-based fare system where a different fare was paid based on where the passenger was traveling. For instance, prior to September 1961, an interstate fare to or from all stations except Newark Penn Station was 25 cents, while an intrastate fare was 15 cents. That month, the interstate fare was increased to 30 cents, and the intrastate fare to 20 cents. A fare to or from Newark Penn, regardless of the origin or destination point, was 40 cents because the station&#x27;s operations were shared with the Pennsylvania Railroad at the time. Under Port Authority operation, the PATH fare to and from Newark was lowered in 1966, standardizing the interstate fare to 30 cents. The intrastate fare of 15 cents was doubled in 1970, resulting in a flat rate for the entire system.

==== Tokens ====
PATH fares were paid with brass tokens starting in 1965. The Port Authority ordered 1 million tokens in 1962 and bought a half-million more in 1967. The Port Authority discontinued the sale of tokens in 1971 as a cost-cutting measure, since it cost $900,000 a year to maintain the token fare system. The agency replaced the turnstiles in its stations with new ones that accepted the 30-cent fare in exact change.

==== QuickCards ====
A paper ticket called the QuickCard, introduced in June 1990, was valid only on the PATH system. It stored fare information on a magnetic stripe.

The QuickCard was replaced by the SmartLink card in 2008 as sales were phased out across the system and at NJ Transit ticket machines. By late 2008, PATH had deactivated all turnstiles that accepted cash; they continued to accept the various cards.

The QuickCard was replaced by SmartLink Gray, a non-refillable, disposable version of the SmartLink card. This card was sold at selected newsstand vendors and was available in 10–, 20– and 40–trip increments. Unlike regular SmartLink cards, SmartLink Gray cards had expiration dates. SmartLink Gray was itself discontinued in January 2016.

=== Current payment methods ===
==== SmartLink ====
PATH&#x27;s official method of fare payment is a smart card known as SmartLink. The SmartLink was developed at a cost of $73 million, and initially was intended as a regional smart card that could be deployed on transit systems throughout the New York metropolitan area. It was first made available in July 2007 at the World Trade Center. The SmartLink can be connected to an online web account system allowing a cardholder to register the card and monitor its usage; it allows for an automatic replenishment system linked to a credit card account, wherein the card balance is automatically refilled when five trips remain (for multiple-trip cards) or five days (for unlimited-ride cards).

==== MetroCard ====

PATH fare payment may also be made using single-ride, two-trip, and pay-per-ride MetroCards, the standard farecard of New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). The MetroCard is a magnetic stripe card, like the QuickCard. PATH riders paying their fare using MetroCard insert the card into a slot at the front of the turnstile, which reads the card and presents the MetroCard to the rider at a slot on the top of the same turnstile. Other types of MetroCards, including unlimited-ride MetroCards, are not accepted on PATH.

Plans for using the MetroCard on PATH date to 1996, when the Port Authority and MTA first considered a unified fare system. At the time, the MetroCard was still being rolled out on the MTA system, and more than 80% of PATH riders transferred to other modes of transportation at some point in their trip. In November 2003, the Port Authority announced that the MetroCard would be allowed for use on PATH starting the following year. The Port Authority started implementing the MetroCard on PATH in 2005, installing new fare collection turnstiles at all PATH stations. These turnstiles allowed passengers to pay their fare with a PATH QuickCard or an MTA Pay-Per-Ride MetroCard. MetroCard vending machines are located at all PATH stations. The machines sell Pay-Per-Ride MetroCards; allow riders to refill SmartLink cards; and sell Single Ride PATH tickets for use only on the PATH system. There are two types of MetroCard vending machines: large machines, which sell both MetroCards and SmartLinks and accept cash, credit cards, and transit benefits cards; and small machines, which do not accept cash or sell PATH single-ride tickets but otherwise perform the same functions as the large vending machines.

In 2010, PATH introduced a $4 two-trip card using the standard MetroCard form. All PATH stations, except for the uptown platforms at 14th and 23rd Streets, contain blue vending machines which sell this card. The front of the card is the standard MetroCard (gold and blue) but on the reverse, it has the text &quot;PATH 2-Trip Card&quot;, &quot;Valid for two (2) PATH trips only&quot;, and &quot;No refills on this card&quot;. The user must dispose of the card after the trips are used up because the turnstiles do not keep (or capture) the card as was done with the discontinued QuickCard.

=== TAPP ===
In June 2019, the Port Authority announced it was in talks with the MTA to implement the new OMNY fare payment system on PATH. Under the announced plan, OMNY would be available to PATH riders by 2022, with both SmartLink and MetroCard being phased out by 2023.
In November 2021, the Port Authority indicated that it would instead implement its own fare payment system, which would be similar to OMNY. This fare system is named TAPP, short for Total Access PATH Payment, and is being tested as of December 2023. TAPP accepts debit and credit cards and phones for fare payment, but does not accept OMNY cards. By March 2024, TAPP-compatible turnstiles had been enabled at six stations. The rollout of TAPP at all New Jersey stations was completed by early May 2024 and was rolled out at all stations in New York later that month.

== Rolling stock ==

=== Current roster ===
, there is only one model, the PA5. The cars are long by wide, a smaller loading gauge compared to similar vehicles in the US, due to the restricted structure gauge through the tunnels under the Hudson River. They can reach in regular service. Each car seats 35 passengers, in longitudinal &quot;bucket&quot; seating, and can fit a larger number of standees in each car. PA5 cars have stainless steel bodies and three doors on each side. LED displays above the windows (between the doors) display the destination of that particular train. The PA5 cars are coupled and linked into consists up to 8 cars long, with conductors&#x27; controls on all cars and engineers&#x27; cabs on the &quot;A&quot; (driving) cars; trains on the Newark–World Trade Center line will be lengthened to 10 cars as part of the line&#x27;s 2010s upgrades.

In 2005, the Port Authority awarded a $499 million contract to Kawasaki to design and build 340 new PATH cars under the PA5 order to replace the system&#x27;s entire existing fleet. With an average age of 42 years and some cars dating back as far as 1964, the fleet was the oldest of any operating heavy rail line in the United States. The Port Authority announced that the new cars would be updated versions of the MTA&#x27;s R142A cars. The first of these new cars entered revenue service in 2009; all of them were delivered over the next two years. The Port Authority exercised a subsequent contract for 10 additional PA5 cars, bringing the total to 350.

As part of the fleet expansion program and signal system upgrade, the Port Authority had the option to order a total of 119 additional PA5 cars; 44 would be used to expand the NWK–WTC line to 10-car operation while the remaining 75 would be used to increase service frequencies after communication-based train control (CBTC) was implemented throughout the system by the end of 2018. In December 2017, the Port Authority exercised an option to buy 50 extra PA5 cars for $150 million, for an ultimate total of 400 PA5 cars. Subsequently, in July 2018, Kawasaki was awarded a $240 million contract to refurbish the 350 existing PA5 cars between 2018 and 2024. The contract also called for Kawasaki to build and deliver 72 new PA5 cars starting in 2021, for a total of 422 cars; the first of the additional PA5 cars arrived in September 2022. The new cars are being built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries in the U.S. at Lincoln, Nebraska and tested in Yonkers, New York. The 350 existing cars are being refurbished in Yonkers.

Since 1990, all PATH trains are stored and maintained at the Harrison Car Maintenance Facility in New Jersey, located east of the Harrison station. Another train storage yard (Waldo Yard) exists east of the Journal Square station. If the Newark Airport extension is built, a third train storage yard would be built at the airport.

=== Former roster ===

Before the Port Authority takeover, the H&amp;M system used rolling stock series that were given letters from A to J. All of these cars, except for the D and H series, were known as &quot;black cars&quot; for their color. There were a total of 325 cars in series A through J, of which 255 were black cars. The first 190 cars, in classes A through C, were ordered for the initial H&amp;M service and delivered in 1909–1911. The cars, which were built in seven modular segments, measured long with a loading gauge of and a height of , with longitudinal seating and three doors on each side. They were ordered to the narrow specifications of the Hudson Tubes, and were light enough that they could be tested on the Second Avenue elevated in Manhattan, which could only support lightweight trains.

Seventy-five cars in classes E through G were added in 1921–1923, allowing the H&amp;M to lengthen train consists from six to seven cars each to eight. Although classes E-G had similar exterior dimensions to classes A-C, the E-G series had higher capacity, were heavier, and had substantially different window designs compared to the A-C series. The last order of black cars, the 20 cars in series J, was delivered in 1928. Many of the black cars remained in service from their inception until the H&amp;M&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1954. By that time, they required considerable maintenance.

The PRR and H&amp;M joint service comprised 40 cars in classes D and H, which were owned by the H&amp;M, as well as 72 cars from the MP38 class, which were owned by the PRR. Sixty MP38s and 36 Class D cars were delivered in 1911, when the service first operated. In 1927, an additional 12 MP38 cars were ordered under the MP38A classification, as well as four Class H cars. As a result of the different manufacturers and the long duration between the two pairs of orders, the Class D and MP38 cars&#x27; designs were noticeably different from the Class H and MP38A cars&#x27; designs. The red cars were branded with the names of both companies to signify the partnership. The red cars suffered from corrosion and design defects, and were unusable by 1954. All of the red and black car series were designed to be operationally compatible.

The MP52 and K-class, which replaced the D-class and the 60 MP38s ordered in 1911, comprised an order of 50 cars. The 30 MP52s and 20 K-classes were purchased by the PRR and H&amp;M respectively and delivered in 1958 in order to save money on maintenance.

After the Port Authority took over operation of the H&amp;M Railroad in 1962, it started ordering new rolling stock to replace the old H&amp;M cars. St. Louis Car built 162 PA1 cars in 1964–1965. St. Louis also built the PA2, a supplementary order of 44 cars, in 1966–1967. Hawker Siddeley built 46 PA3 cars in 1972. The 95 PA4s were built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries in 1986–1987, replacing the K-class and MP52 series.

PA1, PA2, and PA3 cars had painted aluminum bodies, and two doors on each side. Back-lit panels above the doors displayed the destination of that particular train: HOB for Hoboken, JSQ for Journal Square, NWK for Newark, 33 for 33rd Street, and WTC for World Trade Center. In the mid-1980s, Kawasaki overhauled 248 of the 252 PA1-PA3 cars at their factory in Yonkers, New York, and repainted them white to match the PA4 cars then being delivered. PA4 cars had stainless steel bodies, and three doors on each side. Back-lit displays above the windows (between the doors) displayed the destination of that particular train. All four series were designed to be operationally compatible. Although all four orders contained &quot;A&quot; cars with cabs at one end, the PA1 and PA2 orders also contained some &quot;C&quot; cars. Trains could comprise three to eight cars, but in order to operate, there had to be an even number of &quot;A&quot; cars in the consist, including one &quot;A&quot; car at each end. All PA1-PA4 equipment was retired from passenger service by 2011.
A seven-car PATH train was left under the World Trade Center after September 11, 2001; though five of the cars were destroyed, cars 745 and 143 were not positioned directly beneath the tower and survived the collapse relatively intact. These two cars were cleaned and placed in storage while the remains of the rest of the train had been stripped of usable parts and scrapped. The cars were intended to be displayed in the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum. However, they were deemed too large to be displayed there; as a result, car 745 was instead donated to the Shore Line Trolley Museum, while car 143 was donated to the Trolley Museum of New York.

== FRA railroad status ==

While PATH operates as a typical intraurban heavy rail rapid transit system, it is legally a commuter railroad under the jurisdiction of the FRA, which oversees railroads that are part of the national rail network. PATH&#x27;s predecessor, the H&amp;M, used to share trackage with the Pennsylvania Railroad between the Hudson interlocking near Harrison and Journal Square. The line also connected to the Northeast Corridor near Harrison station and also near Hudson tower. Though there is no longer any through-running of mainline intercity trains into PATH tunnels, FRA regulations still apply to PATH because PATH&#x27;s right-of-way between Newark and Jersey City is very close to the Northeast Corridor. PATH also shares the Dock Bridge near Newark Penn Station with Amtrak and NJ Transit.

While PATH operates under several grandfather waivers, it still must meet more stringent requirements than other American rapid transit systems, such as the proper fitting of grab irons to all PATH rolling stock, installation of PTC, and compliance with the federal railroad hours of service regulations. Additionally, all PATH train operators must be federally certified locomotive engineers, and the agency must conduct more detailed safety inspections than other rapid transit systems. These requirements increase PATH&#x27;s per-hour operating costs relative to other rapid transit systems in the New York City and Philadelphia areas. For instance, it is three times more expensive to operate per hour than the New York City Subway despite having only a fraction of the latter system&#x27;s length and ridership. The PANYNJ has sought to switch its regulator to the Federal Transit Administration, which oversees rapid transit, but the FRA has insisted that safety concerns require PATH to remain under its purview. Alternatively, the Port Authority has considered transferring PATH to NJ Transit.

== Media and popular culture ==

PATH management has two principal passenger outreach initiatives: the &quot;PATHways&quot; newsletter, distributed for free at terminals, as well as the Patron Advisory Committee. Other passenger outreach initiatives include &quot;PATHursday&quot;, allowing passengers to provide enhancing service suggestions. Similarly, the &quot;PATH Riders&#x27; Council&quot; allows feedback about their system design, service, and decision-making. PATH has offered various &quot;Community Poster Competitions&quot; with schools, &quot;Transit Lines Poetry Stories&quot; featuring poet pieces tied with New York and New Jersey region, and &quot;Arts In Transit&quot; and &quot;PATH Performs!&quot; displaying local artists&#x27; work and performances.

=== Media restrictions ===
, PATH regulations state that all photography, filmmaking, videotaping, or creations of drawings or other visual depictions within the PATH system is prohibited without a permit and supervision by a PATH representative. According to the rules, photographers, filmmakers, and other individuals must obtain permits through an application process. Although it has been suggested that the restriction was put in place due to terrorism concerns, the restriction predates the September 11 attacks and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.

According to New Jersey newspaper &quot;Hudson Reporter&quot;, this ban excludes members of the general public who want to take pictures, and the photography and filmography ban only applies for commercial or professional purposes. The general public is allowed to take pictures of PATH stations and all other Port Authority facilities except in secure and off-limits areas. There have been decisions from the United States Supreme Court stating that casual photography is covered by the First Amendment; the case law is mixed. Under the law, PATH employees may not force a casual photographer to destroy or surrender their film or images, but confiscations and arrests have occurred. Litigation following such confiscations or arrests have generally, but not always, resulted in charges being dropped and/or damages awarded.

=== Tunnel decoration ===
On trains bound for Newark or Hoboken from World Trade Center, a short, zoetrope-like advertisement was formerly visible in the tunnel before entering Exchange Place. There was another similar advertisement, visible from 33rd Street-bound trains between 14th and 23rd Streets near the abandoned 19th Street station.

Every year, around Thanksgiving, PATH employees light a decorated Christmas tree at the switching station adjacent to the tunnel used by trains entering the Pavonia/Newport station. This tradition started in the 1950s when a signal operator hung a string of Christmas lights in the tunnel. While PATH officials were initially concerned about putting up decorations in the tunnel, they later acquiesced and the tradition continued. After the September 11 attacks, a backlit U.S. flag was put up beside the tree as a tribute to the victims.

=== In popular culture ===
PATH trains and stations have occasionally been the setting for music videos, commercials, movies, and TV programs. For instance, the White Stripes&#x27;s video for &quot;The Hardest Button to Button&quot; was filmed at 33rd Street. Additionally, the premiere for season 19 of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; was filmed in the World Trade Center station. The PATH system is also often used as a stand-in for the New York City Subway, as in &quot;John Wick: Chapter 2&quot; where it was portrayed as a &quot;Broad Street bound Z train&quot;.

== Major incidents ==

=== Train collisions ===

* On August 31, 1922, two H&amp;M trains collided in heavy fog at Manhattan Transfer, injuring 50 people, eight of them seriously.
* On July 22, 1923, another collision near Manhattan Transfer killed one person and injured 15 others.
* On January 16, 1931, a seven-car H&amp;M train derailed a switch and collided with a wall at 33rd Street, injuring 19 passengers.
* On August 22, 1937, a 5-car H&amp;M train crashed into a wall at Hudson Terminal, injuring 33 passengers.
* On November 26, 1938, 22 passengers were injured when an H&amp;M train sideswiped a PRR engine in Kearny, east of the former Manhattan Transfer station.
* On April 26, 1942, a six-car H&amp;M train derailed at Exchange Place. Five people were killed and 222 more were injured. A subsequent investigation found that the motorman was intoxicated.
* On December 17, 1945, a seven-car H&amp;M train collided with a steel barrier on the Dock Bridge west of Harrison, killing the motorman and injuring 67 passengers.
* On December 13, 1958, an H&amp;M train rear-ended another one at Journal Square, injuring 30 passengers, none seriously.
* On October 16, 1962, 26 people were injured in a crash between two H&amp;M trains at Hudson Terminal.
* On July 23, 1963, a PATH train collided with a PRR engine east of Harrison, killing two passengers and injuring 28 more.
* On January 11, 1968, a rear-end accident at Journal Square injured 100 of the approximately 200 combined passengers on the two trains, 25 of them seriously.
* On October 21, 2009, a PATH train crashed into a bumper block at the end of the platform at 33rd Street. Approximately 13 of the 450 people on board suffered minor injuries; two crew members and five passengers were hospitalized. An investigation by the Port Authority determined that the cause was human error.
* On May 8, 2011, a PATH train crashed into a bumper block at Hoboken Terminal, injuring 34 people; the NTSB said the train engineer failed to control the speed of the train as it entered the station.
* On October 10, 2019, a PATH train derailed and collided with the platform at Newark Penn Station. No one was on the train at the time.

=== Other incidents ===
* A train near Exchange Place caught fire on June 3, 1982, injuring 28 people.
* Part of the ceiling at Journal Square fell onto the platform on August 8, 1983, killing two and injuring 12. A subsequent investigation found that the ceiling collapse had occurred due to the station&#x27;s poor design, bad supervision procedures during construction, and inadequate maintenance.
* In July 2006, an alleged plot to detonate explosives in the Downtown Hudson Tubes (initially said to be a plot to bomb the Holland Tunnel) was uncovered by the FBI. According to officials, this plan was unsound due to the strength of both tunnels, as well as various restrictions in both the Holland Tunnel and the PATH system. Three of the eight planners were arrested.
* On January 7, 2013, an escalator at Exchange Place suddenly reversed itself, resulting in five injuries. After the incident, all of the escalators in the PATH system were inspected.

<text>Frederick William Schneider III (born July 1, 1951) is an American singer-songwriter and frontman of the rock band the B-52&#x27;s, of which he is a founding member. Schneider is well known for his &quot;sprechgesang&quot;, which he developed from reciting poetry over guitars.

==Early life==
Frederick William Schneider III was born on July 1, 1951, in Newark, New Jersey, and lived in Long Branch, New Jersey, after moving there from Belleville, New Jersey. He has said that his musical influences included &quot;Halloween songs and nutty Christmas songs&quot;, along with Motown. After graduating from Shore Regional High School, he attended the University of Georgia, where he wrote a book of poetry for a class project. After college, he was a janitor as well as a Meals on Wheels driver. At the time the B-52&#x27;s formed, he had very little musical experience.

==The B-52&#x27;s==

The B-52&#x27;s got their start in 1976 when founders Cindy Wilson, Ricky Wilson, Kate Pierson, Keith Strickland, and Schneider played an impromptu number after drinking at a Chinese restaurant in Athens, Georgia. The band played their first real gig in 1977 at a Valentine&#x27;s Day party for their friends.

The band&#x27;s first single was &quot;Rock Lobster&quot; which was recorded for DB Records in 1978. It was an underground success, and sold over 20,000 copies in total. In 1979, the B-52&#x27;s signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records for South America, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. They also signed with Island Records for Europe and Asia. After the death of Ricky Wilson in 1985, the band went on hiatus. They reformed in 1989 and went on to mainstream success.

==Other music ventures==
Schneider has released two solo albums: &quot;Fred Schneider and the Shake Society&quot; (1984, reissued in 1991 as &quot;Fred Schneider&quot;) and &quot;Just Fred&quot; (1996), the former of which spawned the single and video &quot;Monster&quot;, which featured Pierson on backing vocals. He also worked on a side project called the Superions, who released a self-titled EP and the album &quot;Destination... Christmas!&quot; in 2010. In February 2011, the band announced they were working on a full-length album, which was eventually released in 2017 under the title &quot;The Vertical Mind&quot;.

==Radio==
Until late 2008, Schneider hosted a show called &quot;Party Out of Bounds&quot; that aired on Friday nights, 9pm to 12 am (ET), on Sirius 33 First Wave. On the show, Schneider played a mix of new wave-era dance, remixes and rarities, interspersed with anecdotes and humor.

==Personal life==
, Schneider was living on Long Island, New York.

On the February 22, 2010, broadcast of &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, Schneider discussed his experience of coming out as gay to his mother. Schneider said that his mother always knew more about him than he knew about himself, and that he came out of the closet while she was vacuuming. His mother replied, &quot;Oh I know, Freddie&quot;, and continued vacuuming. Schneider&#x27;s reaction was, &quot;It&#x27;s like, well, OK. I guess I&#x27;ll go back outside and smoke some pot.&quot;

Schneider is a lifelong vegetarian and in 2014 appeared in a PETA ad campaign discouraging people from eating lobsters.

In May 2023, Schneider received an honorary doctorate degree from Five Towns College in Dix Hills, New York, for his contributions to the music industry.

<text>The Maple Leaf is an international passenger train service operated by Amtrak and Via Rail between New York Penn Station in New York City and Union Station in Toronto via Amtrak&#x27;s Empire Corridor, and the south western part of Via Rail&#x27;s Quebec City–Windsor Corridor. Daily service is offered in both directions; the trip takes approximately 12 hours, including two hours for U.S. or Canadian customs and immigration inspection at either Niagara Falls, New York, or Niagara Falls, Ontario. Although the train uses Amtrak rolling stock exclusively, the train is operated by Via Rail crews while in Canada and by Amtrak crews in the United States. Service began in 1981.

== History ==

Amtrak and Via Rail introduced the &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; along the Hudson River and Erie Canal on April 26, 1981. The &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; replaced Buffalo–Toronto connecting service operated by Via and the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway, the latter of which discontinued passenger service that day. The new &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; was the first collaboration between the two companies and the first direct New York–Toronto passenger service in a decade, the last being an overnight TH&amp;B, New York Central, and Canadian Pacific Railway train called &quot;The Ontarian&quot; (Buffalo–Toronto) that ended in 1967. That earlier train began as the &quot;Cleveland Limited&quot; westbound, with sleeper passengers having a continuous carriage ride (eastbound riders joined the &quot;Ohio State Limited&quot; for the Buffalo-New York City leg). By contrast, the modern &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; was a unified New York City–Toronto train. There was also a New York City–Toronto train named &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; operated by the Lehigh Valley Railroad from 1937 until 1961, a train which traveled through northern New Jersey, northeast Pennsylvania and central New York.

The new train employed Amtrak&#x27;s Amfleet coaches with a dinette car. A 1982 consist included a baggage car, two coaches and a dinette; time spent in customs ranged from thirty minutes to two hours. The new route goes through the two Niagara Falls towns on both sides of the border, before going to Aldershot in Burlington, then Toronto. The prior New York Central trains crossed from Buffalo to Ontario south of the Niagara Falls and made five stops in Ontario before reaching Toronto.

An Amtrak crew operates the train in the United States, while a Via Rail crew operates the train in Canada. The crew change takes place in Niagara Falls, Ontario. Because of this need for a crew exchange, the &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; was led by some of the last EMD F40PH locomotives in Amtrak revenue service. While most Amtrak routes outside the Northeast Corridor had switched to the GE Genesis by 2000, it had not been added to the &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; owing to the Via Rail crews&#x27; unfamiliarity with the unit. The &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; retained the F40PH until Via received its own Genesis locomotives in 2002.

The &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; is one of four New York Amtrak routes that are primarily state-funded with the others being the &quot;Adirondack&quot;, &quot;Empire Service&quot;, and &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot;. Primary funding for these routes is from the New York State Department of Transportation rather than federal funding.

In 2013, the &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; was the target of a failed terror plot involving an attempt by two men, both permanent residents of Canada, who sought to derail the train as it crossed a bridge over the Twenty Mile Creek near Jordan, Ontario. The two men were allegedly affiliates of an Al-Qaeda group operating out of Iran.

In March 2020, the &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; was truncated to Niagara Falls, New York after all non-essential travel across the Canada–United States border was banned in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Via did not provide alternate service on the Canadian side of the border. International service resumed on June 27, 2022. The and &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; was combined between New York and Albany–Rensselaer beginning November 10, 2024, due to construction work in the East River Tunnels limiting capacity at Penn Station. This was reversed effective December 2, 2024, through at least March 2025.

== Operation ==
=== Equipment ===

Most &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; trains consist of five or six cars hauled by a locomotive.

The passenger cars are the Amfleet series built by the Budd Company between the mid-1970s to early-1980s. Most trains include an Amfleet club car which has a combination of Business Class seating with a Café (food service/lounge) and four or five Coach Class cars.

Between New York City and Albany–Rensselaer, trains are pulled by a GE Genesis P32AC-DM dual-mode diesel locomotive at speeds up to . The locomotives operate on third rail electric power in Penn Station and the Empire Connection tunnel and on diesel power for the rest of the route. Between Albany–Rensselaer and Toronto, traditional diesel-only GE Genesis P42DC locomotives are used, although the P32AC-DM locomotive may occasionally stay on the train all the way to Toronto.

In the coming years all equipment will be replaced with Amtrak Airo trainsets, the railroad&#x27;s branding of its combination of Siemens Venture passenger cars and a Siemens Charger diesel-electric locomotive. The trainsets for the &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; will have six passenger cars, which will include a cab control car food service area and a mix of 2x2 Coach Class and 2x1 Business Class seating. The car closest to the locomotive will have batteries to supply electricity to traction motors in the locomotive when operating in Penn Station and the Empire Connection tunnel, eliminating the need for third rail propulsion. The arrangement will eliminate the time-consuming locomotive change at Albany–Rensselaer.

=== Classes of service ===
All classes of service include complimentary WiFi, an electric outlet (120 V, 60 Hz AC) at each seat, reading lamps, fold-out tray tables. Reservations are required on all trains, tickets may be purchased online, from an agent at some stations, a ticketing machine at most stations, or, at a higher cost, from the conductor on the train.
*Coach Class: 2x2 seating. Passengers self-select seats on a first-come, first-served basis.
*Business Class: 2x1 seating with more legroom than coach. Passengers receive complimentary soft drinks.

=== Route ===

In the United States, the Maple Leaf shares the route of the &quot;Empire Service&quot;, Amtrak&#x27;s corridor service along the former main line of the New York Central Railroad. From New York City to Albany, it runs mostly parallel to the Hudson River (viewable on the left side northbound and the right side southbound). In Canada, the service shares the route of GO Transit&#x27;s Lakeshore West commuter rail line.

Prior to the completion of the Empire Connection in 1991, the &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; originated at Grand Central Terminal in New York instead of Penn Station.

The &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; operates over Metrolinx and Canadian National Railway trackage in Canada, and CSX Transportation, Metro-North Railroad, and Amtrak trackage in the United States.
*Metrolinx Oakville Subdivision, Toronto to Burlington
*CN Oakville Subdivision and Grimsby Subdivision, Burlington to Niagara Falls
*CSX Niagara Subdivision, Buffalo Terminal Subdivision, Rochester Subdivision, Mohawk Subdivision, Selkirk Subdivision, and Hudson Subdivision, Niagara Falls to Schenectady (Amtrak leases the Hudson Subdivision between Schenectady and Poughkeepsie from CSX)
*MNRR Hudson Line, Poughkeepsie to Spuyten Duyvil
*Amtrak Empire Connection, Spuyten Duyvil to Penn Station.
*Amtrak Niagara connection, Niagara Falls, NY to CN Niagara Falls Yard (Grimsby Subdivision), Niagara Falls, ON

Amtrak numbers the train as 63 northbound and 64 southbound, while Via numbers it as 97 southbound and 98 northbound.

Northbound trains leave New York during the morning rush, arriving in Syracuse at noon, crossing into Canada during the afternoon rush and arriving in Toronto in early evening. Southbound trains leave Toronto during the morning rush, cross into the United States just after noon and arrive in New York in mid-evening. Trains stop for two hours for customs procedures in Niagara Falls, Ontario northbound and Niagara Falls, New York southbound.

<text>Ilie Theodoriu Năstase (; born 19 July 1946) is a Romanian former professional tennis player. He was ranked as the inaugural world No. 1 in men&#x27;s singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 40 weeks. Năstase is one of ten players to have won over 100 total ATP-level titles, with 64 in singles and 45 in doubles, among which seven majors: two in singles, three in men&#x27;s doubles and two in mixed doubles. He also won four Masters Grand Prix year-end championships. He was the first professional sports figure to sign an endorsement contract with Nike, doing so in 1972. Năstase also wrote several novels in French in the 1980s, and was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1991.

==Career==
At the beginning of his career in 1966, Năstase traveled around the world competing with Ion Țiriac. They represented Romania in the Davis Cup competition, being runners up in 1969, 1971, and 1972. In singles, Năstase won his first tournament at Cannes on 16 April 1967. His first victories against top players happened in 1969 in Stockholm, where he defeated Tony Roche and Stan Smith. Năstase became one of the best players in 1970, with many experts ranking him as the sixth-best player in the world at that time, behind the Australians Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, John Newcombe, and Tony Roche and the American Arthur Ashe. Năstase&#x27;s high ranking resulted from his success at the Italian Open in Rome and at the U.S. Indoor Open in Salisbury, Maryland. With Tiriac, Năstase won the men&#x27;s doubles title at the French Open. In 1971, Năstase was the runner-up at the French Open, where he lost the final in four sets to Jan Kodeš. In December, Năstase won his first Masters Grand Prix title, finishing in front of Stan Smith in a round robin competition.

In 1972, he became the No. 2 in the world, owing to his winning the US Open in a five-set final over Ashe. This tournament was the only event of the year in which all the best players participated. Two months before, at Wimbledon, Năstase narrowly lost to Stan Smith in an epic five-set final, one of the more exciting championship matches. In the Davis Cup, Năstase was undefeated in singles until losing to Stan Smith in the final played on clay in his native Bucharest. In December at the year-end tour finals, Năstase defeated Smith, winning his second consecutive Masters Grand Prix title.

In 1973, Năstase won 17 tournaments, including the French Open, a doubles title at Wimbledon, and a third Masters title. He was the world No. 1 in the ATP rankings that year. He also won the &#x27;Martini and Rossi&#x27; Award, voted for by a panel of journalists and was ranked No. 1 by an international poll of 17 tennis writers, &quot;Tennis Magazine&quot; (U.S.), Bud Collins, Rino Tommasi and Rex Bellamy. In the Davis Cup, he won seven of eight singles rubbers. In matches against the other top players, Năstase was 1–0 against Newcombe and 1–1 against Smith. The Romanian won the French Open without dropping a set (a feat repeated by Björn Borg in 1978 and 1980 and by Rafael Nadal in 2008, 2010, 2017 and 2020), and he won the French Open (clay), Rome (clay) and Queen&#x27;s Club (grass) in succession. Năstase was seeded No. 2 for Wimbledon, behind the defending champion Stan Smith. When the newly formed ATP withdrew its players from the tournament following the suspension by the ITF of Yugoslav Nikola Pilić, only three ATP players (Năstase, Roger Taylor and Ray Keldie) defied the boycott and were fined by the ATP&#x27;s disciplinary committee. Năstase was promoted to No. 1 seed for the players in the subsequently weakened field and publicly stated his support for the ATP action but insisted that as a serving captain, he was under orders from the Romanian army and government to compete and thus could not boycott the tournament. Some contemporary press speculation and later biographies have suggested Năstase contrived to lose his fourth-round match to American Sandy Mayer, but to have lost any earlier to a considerably less able player would have been too obvious. Năstase never has commented publicly on this speculation.

In 1974, he was the only player to qualify for both the WCT Finals and the Masters Grand Prix finals. Năstase played well in the Masters, in particular against Newcombe in the semifinals. (Năstase finished his career with a 4–1 record versus Newcombe, losing only their first match in 1969.) The Romanian, however, lost the final to Guillermo Vilas in five sets.

For the fifth consecutive year, Năstase reached the Masters Grand Prix final in 1975, where he defeated Björn Borg in three straight sets.

During the first half of 1976, Năstase won four tournaments (Atlanta WCT, Avis Challenge Cup WCT, US Open Indoor, and La Costa), and head-to-head, he led Connors 2–1, Vilas 1–0, Ashe 1–0, and Borg 2–0. Năstase did not enter the Australian Open, which was again avoided by most of the top players. Năstase was prevented from entering the French Open because he participated in World Team Tennis. In the second half of the year, third-seeded Năstase lost in straight sets to Borg in the men&#x27;s singles final of Wimbledon and in the semifinals of the US Open. Năstase won three other tournaments during the second half of the year, the Pepsi Grand Slam, South Orange, and the four-man tournament of Caracas, Venezuela, in October (not to be confused with the Caracas WCT tournament in March), making seven tournament championships for the year. Năstase was the world No. 3, behind Connors and Borg.

In 1977, Năstase finished No. 9 in the ATP rankings. He was a quarterfinalist at the French Open and at Wimbledon (losing to Borg), and participated in the WCT Finals. During his quarterfinal match at Wimbledon Năstase had a row with umpire Jeremy Shales. Shales called him &quot;Năstase&quot; when asking him to move to the advantage court, &quot;like a master speaks to a naughty schoolboy.&quot; (Năstase has also said Shales asked him to pick up a piece of paper that had blown onto the court, saying, &quot;Năstase, pick up that paper.&quot;) Năstase angrily replied &quot;You call me Mr. Năstase!&quot;. Since this incident, umpires have always used a courtesy title when addressing the players directly. &quot;Mr. Nastase&quot; later became the title of his autobiography.

He was still one of the 20 best players in 1978; at Wimbledon, he again reached the quarterfinals.

Năstase retired from the tour in October 1985 at the age of 39 after playing in the Grand Prix de Tennis de Toulouse, but he did play the challenger tournament at Dijon in June 1988.

==Controversies==
In the second round of the 1976 US Open against Hans-Jürgen Pohmann, there were several controversial moments involving Năstase. At 5–5 in the third and final set Năstase was furious at a photographer and hit a ball at him and swung his racket near him. The crowd were at fever pitch by this point. Then Pohmann began cramping badly in his leg. &quot;Three times Pohmann went down on his cramped leg and three times he came back to fight Năstase to a standstill&quot;. With the aid of the tournament physician, who attended the leg, Pohmann saved three match points and the set entered a final set tie-break. Năstase was screaming at the umpire and making obscenities to the crowd. Pohmann had two match points but Năstase won and then screamed at Pohmann as the two approached the net. The British umpire George Armstrong refused to shake Năstase&#x27;s hand as Ilie continued raving. Many thought Năstase should have been disqualified. Later, Năstase claimed the match should have been forfeited to him when Pohmann was unable to continue play immediately (he and Pohmann had to be separated in the clubhouse after the match).

In October 1977 at the Raquette d&#x27;Or tournament, Năstase used a &#x27;spaghetti string&#x27; (double-strung) racket to end Guillermo Vilas&#x27;s 46-match winning streak. The racket was known for creating large amounts of top spin and unpredictable bounces. Vilas quit the match in protest of the racket. A few days later, the ATP banned the use of such racquets.

During the US Open in 1979, Năstase was defaulted from his match against John McEnroe. The umpire previously docked Năstase a point in third set and then a game in the fourth for arguing and stalling. A near-riot followed as the crowd disagreed with the umpire&#x27;s decision, throwing beer cans and cups on court. The match was restarted, with the umpire being replaced, before McEnroe won.

In 1994 Năstase, Davis Cup captain of his country, was banned for an away match against Great Britain, for &quot;&#x27;audible obscenities and constant abuse and intimidation of officials&#x27;&quot; in a tie against South Africa.

In 2017, while captaining his country&#x27;s Fed Cup team against Great Britain, Năstase was overheard commenting about Serena Williams&#x27; unborn child, and the then 71-year-old asked Britain&#x27;s Fed Cup captain Anne Keothavong for her room number while posing for photographers. Năstase previously made unfounded comments about Williams allegedly doping. Before Great Britain and Romania began their two-day World Group play-off, Năstase allegedly stormed in to the media centre to confront British journalists over the reporting of his comments the previous day. Năstase could only find Press Association tennis correspondent Eleanor Crook before launching into a tirade about the reporting.

During the second rubber, after the crowd had been told to respect the players, he said to match umpire Andreas Egli: &quot;It&#x27;s not the opera, what&#x27;s your fucking problem?&quot; He was ultimately ejected from the stadium for unsportsmanlike conduct. In a statement the International Tennis Federation (ITF) additionally confirmed that Năstase had his accreditation removed and would take no further part in the tie. The next day, the ITF provisionally suspended Năstase under the Fed Cup Regulations for a breach of the Fed Cup Welfare Policy, meaning that he was banned from the site of any ITF event. When Năstase was ejected from the stadium he met Crook again and, separated by a large number of security guards, verbally attacked her. The next day, despite being banned from the venue, Năstase reappeared and went to have lunch in the onsite restaurant. He additionally sent flowers to the British team. On 21 July 2017, he was suspended by the ITF until 2021.

Williams released a statement on social media branding the comments about her unborn child as racist, noting that it saddened her that we live in a society where these comments can be made. Năstase then apologised on social media regarding the comments he made about Williams, but made comments about Konta speaking to the umpire which upset him. In a further interview with the BBC, Năstase justified his comments to Konta, stating that he only abused her after being ejected from the court and did so as a fan rather than a captain. Năstase also said that he regretted his behaviour in the incident. Năstase was not invited to the 2017 French Open and Wimbledon following his suspension. The Madrid Open, however, invited Năstase to be part of the prizegiving ceremony, which was won by Romanian Simona Halep. This was a move that was deemed irresponsible by the WTA, which had revoked Năstase&#x27;s privileges while the ITF carried out its investigation.

Allegations of inappropriate behaviour included Pam Shriver claiming Năstase frequently asked in a joking manner if she was still a virgin. After about 30 occasions of this happening, Shriver asked him to stop asking that, which he did. Dominique Monami, captain of the Belgium team, then mentioned that Năstase had abused her in the round before the match with Great Britain. Monami later added that Năstase was abusive for two games during the match between Elise Mertens and Irina-Camelia Begu.

==Playing style==
Considered one of the most gifted tennis players in history, Năstase was noted for his ability to entertain, amusing spectators with his antics and mimicry. Even during a crucial phase of a match, he was likely to do something bizarre that would entertain the crowd.

One of the fastest players, he is remembered for his magnificent lobs and retrieves. Năstase could apply a discomforting spin to his shots, being an expert at putting the ball just beyond an opponent&#x27;s reach. His greatest weakness was a fragile nervous system and erratic temperament.

Năstase pioneered a distinctive tennis shot, a backward, over-the-shoulder wrist-flick useful as a last resort in recovering lobs. Tennis writer Bud Collins dubbed the shot the &quot;Bucharest Backfire&quot; after Năstase.

According to &quot;The Independent&quot;, Năstase is best remembered for being one of the better players never to win the singles title at Wimbledon, for his tantrums, and his good looks.

==Athletic distinctions==
* Năstase has the all-time highest winning percentage (88%, 22 wins and only 3 losses) in the year ending tournaments (today ATP Tour Finals) winning four times, in 1971, 1972, 1973 and 1975.
* He is one of the five tennis players (third place) in the world who won more than 100 pro titles (57 singles and 45 doubles) according to the ATP website, though there are many titles that are not included in the ATP statistics.
* Năstase was the first professional sports figure to sign an endorsement contract with Nike.

==Awards and accolades==
* Năstase was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1991.
* In March 2009, Năstase was made a knight of the France&#x27;s Legion d&#x27;honneur, being acclaimed for his &quot;impressive sporting career&quot; and &quot;the sense of spectacle&quot; he created when playing.
* On 19 July 2016, his 70th birthday, Năstase received the Star of Romania, his country&#x27;s highest civil award, for services to sport.

* &quot;The Net&quot; (&quot;Le filet&quot;, 1986)
* &quot;Mr Nastase: The Autobiography&quot; (&quot;Mr Năstase: Autobiografia&quot;, 2004)

==Political career==

He holds the rank of major general in the Romanian military. He entered Romanian politics in 1995, joining the Social Democracy Party of Romania and making an unsuccessful run for mayor of Bucharest in 1996. Elected to the Romanian Senate for a Bucharest seat in 2012, he initially sat for the Conservative Party (PC), then subsequently switching to the National Union for the Progress of Romania (UNPR) in July 2015 after the former party ceased to exist. He left the UNPR in 2016, after it merged with the People&#x27;s Movement Party.

==Personal life==
Năstase has been married five times: his first wife was Dominique Grazia, a Belgian fashion model, whom he wed at the age of 26 and whom he was married to for 10 years, and with whom he has a daughter, Nathalie. His second wife was American actress Alexandra King, whom he married in 1984, and with whom he adopted two children, Nicholas and Charlotte. His third wife was Romanian fashion model Amalia Teodosescu, whom he married in 2004. They have two children, Alessia and Emma Alexandra. After they split in 2010, he married Romanian fashion model Brigitte Sfăt in 2013; their marriage ended in 2018. In 2019, he married Ioana Simion.

&quot;Maxim&quot; has placed Năstase at number 6 on its &quot;Living Sex Legends&quot; list, as he is reputed to have slept with over 2,500 women. Năstase&#x27;s own estimate of 800 to 900 was too low for the writer of his biography who wanted a larger number to improve his reputation. After hearing this, his third wife, Amalia, said that she was happy to have conquered such a man. Năstase met Amalia at a Sting concert and married her in a Greek Orthodox ceremony on 5 June 2004, followed by a civil ceremony in July of the same year. They divorced in February 2010, after six years of marriage.

As he played for the Army&#x27;s sports club Steaua, he was an employee of the Ministry of Defence.

In 2010 he appeared in the &quot;Be free&quot; video of Smiley&#x27;s band Radio Killer alongside footballers Ioan Lupescu and Ousmane N&#x27;Doye.

On 25 May 2018, Năstase was arrested twice within a six-hour span for drunk-driving and riding a scooter through a red light.

He was involved in an animation project, and provides the Romanian voice of the federal agent in the Disney movie &quot;G-Force&quot;.

During the second season of &quot;Masked Singer România&quot;, Năstase appeared as &quot;Bufnița&quot; on 9 September 2021. He sang &quot;My Way&quot; by Frank Sinatra, unmasking himself before the audience vote for elimination.

<text>The Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company , also branded as MTA Metro-North Railroad and commonly called simply Metro-North, is a suburban commuter rail service operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), a public authority of the U.S. state of New York. Metro-North serves the New York Metropolitan Area, running service between New York City and its northern suburbs in New York and Connecticut, including Port Jervis, Spring Valley, Poughkeepsie, Yonkers, New Rochelle, Mount Vernon, White Plains, Southeast and Wassaic in New York and Stamford, New Canaan, Danbury, Bridgeport, Waterbury, and New Haven in Connecticut. Service in Connecticut is operated under contract with the Connecticut Department of Transportation. Similarly, service on lines west of the Hudson River is operated under contract with NJ Transit. Metro-North also provides local rail service within the New York City boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx.

Metro-North is the descendant of commuter rail services dating back as early as 1832. By 1969, they had all been acquired by Penn Central. MTA acquired all three lines by 1972, but Penn Central continued to operate them under contract. Service was transferred to Conrail in 1976, when it absorbed most of Penn Central&#x27;s railroad functions after Penn Central&#x27;s bankruptcy. The system took its current form in 1983, when the MTA took over direct operation of Conrail&#x27;s commuter services in the northern portion of the Tri-State Area and formed Metro-North to run them.

There are 124 stations on Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s five active lines, which operate on more than of track, with the passenger railroad system totaling of route. It is the second busiest commuter railroad in North America in terms of annual ridership, behind the Long Island Rail Road and ahead of NJ Transit (both of which also serve New York City). , Metro-North&#x27;s budgetary burden for expenditures was $1.3 billion, which it supports through the collection of taxes and fees. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

Additionally, ferry service connecting to Metro-North is operated by NY Waterway, also under contract with the MTA.

== Lines ==

=== East of the Hudson River ===
Three lines provide passenger service on the east side of the Hudson River to Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan: the Hudson, Harlem, and New Haven Lines. The Beacon Line is a freight line owned by Metro-North but is not in service.

The Hudson and Harlem Lines terminate in Poughkeepsie and Wassaic, New York, respectively.

The New Haven Line is operated through a partnership between Metro-North and the State of Connecticut. The Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) owns the tracks and stations within Connecticut, and finances and performs capital improvements. MTA owns the tracks and stations and handles capital improvements within New York State. MTA performs routine maintenance and provides police services for the entire line, its branches and stations. New cars and locomotives are typically purchased in a joint agreement between MTA and CTDOT, with the agencies paying for 33.3% and 66.7% of costs respectively. CTDOT pays more because most of the line is in Connecticut. The New Haven Line has three branches in Connecticut: the New Canaan Branch, Danbury Branch and Waterbury Branch. At New Haven, CTDOT runs two connecting services, the Shore Line East connecting service continues east to New London, and the Hartford Line service continues north to Hartford, and Springfield, Massachusetts.

Amtrak operates inter-city rail service along the New Haven and Hudson Lines. The New Haven Line is part of Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor. Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; runs from New Rochelle to New Haven, while Stamford and New Haven are also served by the high-speed &quot;Acela.&quot; At New Haven, the New Haven Line connects to the Amtrak New Haven–Springfield Line. The Hudson Line is part of the Empire Corridor, and the Yonkers, Croton-Harmon, and Poughkeepsie stations are all served by Amtrak as well as Metro-North.

Freight trains operate over Metro-North lines, though the company itself does not operate freight services. The Hudson Line connects with the Oak Point Link and is the main route for freight to and from the Bronx and Long Island. Freight railroads CSX, CP Rail, P&amp;W, and Housatonic Railroad have trackage rights on sections of the system. &quot;See&quot; Rail freight transportation in New York City and Long Island.

=== West of the Hudson ===
Metro-North provides service west of the Hudson River on trains from Hoboken Terminal, New Jersey, jointly run with NJ Transit under contract. There are two branches: the Port Jervis Line and the Pascack Valley Line. The Port Jervis Line is accessed from two NJ Transit lines, the Main Line and the Bergen County Line.

The Port Jervis Line terminates in Port Jervis, New York, and the Pascack Valley line in Spring Valley, New York, in Orange and Rockland Counties, respectively. Trackage on the Port Jervis Line north of the Suffern Yard is leased from the Norfolk Southern Railway by the MTA, but NJ Transit owns all of the Pascack Valley Line, including the portion in Rockland County, New York.

Most stops for the Port Jervis and Pascack Valley Lines are in New Jersey, so NJ Transit provides most of the rolling stock and all the staff; Metro-North supplies some equipment. Metro-North equipment has been used on other NJ Transit lines on the Hoboken division.

All stations west of the Hudson River in New York are owned and operated by Metro-North, except , which is owned and operated by NJ Transit.
=== Connecting ferry service ===

In partnership with NY Waterway, Metro-North also provides ferry service across the Hudson River to Ossining station and Beacon station, with the Haverstraw–Ossining Ferry and Newburgh–Beacon Ferry respectively.

== History ==

=== Predecessors ===
Most of the trackage east of the Hudson River and in New York State was under the control of the New York Central Railroad (NYC). The NYC initially operated three commuter lines, two of which ran into Grand Central Depot (now Grand Central Terminal). Metro-North&#x27;s Harlem Line was initially a combination of trackage from the New York and Harlem Railroad and the Boston and Albany Railroad, running from Manhattan to Chatham, New York in Columbia County. At Chatham, passengers could transfer to long-distance trains on the Boston and Albany to Albany, Boston, Vermont, and Canada. On April 1, 1873, the New York and Harlem Railroad was leased by Cornelius Vanderbilt, who added the railroad to his complex empire of railroads, which were run by the NYC. Grand Central Depot, built in 1871, served as the southern terminus of NYC&#x27;s Harlem and Hudson Divisions; it would be replaced by Grand Central Station in 1900, and by Grand Central Terminal in 1913. The Boston and Albany came under the ownership of NYC in 1914.

NYC&#x27;s four-track Water Level Route paralleled the Hudson River, Erie Canal, and Great Lakes on a route from New York to Chicago via Albany. It was fast and popular due to the lack of any significant grades. The section between Grand Central and Peekskill, New York, the northernmost station in Westchester County, became known as the NYC&#x27;s Hudson Division, with frequent commuter service in and out of Manhattan. Stations to the north of Peekskill, such as Poughkeepsie, were considered to be long-distance services. The other major commuter line was the Putnam Division running from 155th Street in upper Manhattan (later from Sedgwick Avenue in the Bronx) to Brewster, New York. Passengers would transfer to the IRT Ninth Avenue Line for midtown and lower Manhattan.

From the mid-19th century until 1969, the New Haven Line, including the New Canaan, Danbury, and Waterbury branches, was owned by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (NYNH&amp;H). These branches were started in the 1830s with horse-drawn cars, later replaced by steam engines, on a route that connected Lower Manhattan to Harlem. Additional lines started in the mid-19th century included the New York and New Haven Railroad and the Hartford and New Haven Railroad, which provided routes to Hartford, Springfield, Massachusetts, and eventually Boston. The two roads merged in 1872 to become the NYNH&amp;H, growing into the largest passenger and commuter carrier in New England. In the early 20th century, the NYNH&amp;H came under the control of J.P. Morgan. Morgan&#x27;s bankroll allowed the NYNH&amp;H to modernize by upgrading steam power with both electric (along the New Haven Line) and diesel power (branches and lines to eastern and northern New England). The NYNH&amp;H saw much profitability throughout the 1910s and 1920s until the Great Depression of the 1930s forced it into bankruptcy.

Commuter services west of the Hudson River, today&#x27;s Port Jervis and Pascack Valley lines, were initially part of the Erie Railroad. The Port Jervis Line, built in the 1850s and 1860s, was originally part of the Erie&#x27;s mainline from Jersey City to Buffalo, New York. The Pascack Valley Line was built by the New Jersey and New York Railroad, which became a subsidiary of the Erie. Trains that service Port Jervis formerly continued to Binghamton and Buffalo, New York (today used only by freight trains), while Pascack Valley service continued to Haverstraw, New York. In 1956, the Erie Railroad began coordinated service with rival Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad, and in 1960 they formed the Erie Lackawanna. Trains were rerouted to the Lackawanna&#x27;s Hoboken Terminal in 1956–1958.

=== Penn Central ===

Passenger rail in the United States began to falter after World War II. Commuter services historically had always been unprofitable, and were usually subsidized by long-distance passenger and freight services. As these profits disappeared, commuter services usually were the first to be affected. Many railroads began to gradually discontinue their commuter lines after the war. By 1958, the NYC had already suspended service on its Putnam Division, while the newly formed Erie Lackawanna, in an effort to make a successful merger, began to prune some of its commuter services. Most New Yorkers still chose the train as their primary means of commuting, making many of the other lines heavily patronized. Thus the NYC, the NYNH&amp;H, and the Erie Lackawanna had to maintain service on these lines. Mergers between railroads were seen as a way to curtail these issues by combining capital and services and creating efficiencies.

In February 1965, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and Connecticut Governor John N. Dempsey jointly suggested that operations of the New Haven Line, the New Haven Railroad&#x27;s struggling commuter rail operation, be transferred to the New York Central Railroad as part of a plan to prevent the New Haven Railroad from going bankrupt. If the operational merger occurred, the proposed Metropolitan Commuter Transit Authority (MCTA; now Metropolitan Transportation Authority, or MTA) and the existing Connecticut Department of Transportation (ConnDOT) would contract with New York Central to operate the New Haven Line to Grand Central Terminal. Due to growing debts, the railroad would have to cease operating passenger trains on the New Haven Line if nothing was done. A joint report from both agencies, released in September of that year, recommended that the line be leased to New York Central for 99 years, with the MCTA and CTA acting as agents for both states. In October, the MCTA found that the New Haven Line&#x27;s stations and infrastructure were even more decrepit than those of the LIRR. The New Haven Railroad&#x27;s trustees initially opposed New York Central&#x27;s takeover of the New Haven Line, as they felt that the $140 million offer for the New Haven Line was too low. After some discussion, the trustees decided to continue operating the New Haven Line, but only until June 1967.

In 1968, following the Erie Lackawanna&#x27;s example, the NYC and its rival the Pennsylvania Railroad formed Penn Central Transportation with the hope of revitalizing their fortunes. In 1969 the bankrupt NYNH&amp;H was also combined into Penn Central by the Interstate Commerce Commission. However, this merger eventually failed, due to large financial costs, government regulations, corporate rivalries, and lack of a formal merger plan. In 1970 Penn Central declared bankruptcy, at the time the largest corporate bankruptcy ever declared. The same year, the MTA also entered into a long-term lease of Penn Central&#x27;s Hudson, Harlem, and New Haven Lines. Penn Central continued to operate the now-subsidized lines under contract to the MTA. In April 1970, Rockefeller proposed that the state take over the Hudson and Harlem Lines, and the next month, he signed a bond issue that provided $44.4 million in funding to these lines.

The MTA and ConnDOT took over ownership of the New Haven Line in January 1971. In May 1972, the MTA also gained ownership of the Hudson and Harlem Lines. Penn Central continued to operate all three routes under contract. As part of its plan to modernize the commuter lines, the MTA ordered high-speed &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; railcars for the New Haven Line as well as for the Hudson and Harlem Lines. After a series of delays and derailments in mid-1972, which involved Penn Central trains near Grand Central Terminal, Chairman Ronan expressed his disapproval of the way Penn Central was running its railroads. He said that the proportion of trains running on schedule had declined after Penn Central had inherited the Hudson, Harlem, and New Haven Lines in 1968.

=== Conrail ===
In 1976, Congress awarded the MTA &quot;temporary&quot; funding so the LIRR and Penn Central commuter routes could be handed over to local private operators. The bankrupt Penn Central&#x27;s commuter routes were taken over by Conrail, an entity created by the federal government, the same year. Many of the other Northeastern railroads, including the Erie Lackawanna, followed Penn Central into bankruptcy, and so they had been merged into Conrail. However, the handover to private owners did not happen.

In March 1981, the administration of President Ronald Reagan suggested that struggling Conrail commuter operations across five states be transferred to state agencies. At the time, Conrail was being floated by the federal government as a private for-profit freight-only carrier. Even with state subsidies, the federal government did not want Conrail to take on the operating costs of the commuter lines, which it was relieved from by the Northeast Rail Service Act of 1981. Thus, it became essential that state-owned agencies both operate and subsidize their commuter services.

Over the next few years commuter lines under the control of Conrail were gradually taken over by state agencies such as the newly formed NJ Transit in New Jersey, the established SEPTA in southeastern Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority in Boston. In March 1982, the MTA announced it would take over the Harlem, Hudson, and New Haven Lines as long as there was no extra operating cost involved. The MTA and ConnDOT officially took control of the Harlem, Hudson and New Haven Lines on January 1, 1983 and merged them into the Metro-North Commuter Railroad.

=== MTA operation and rebrand ===
Metro-North took over the former Erie Lackawanna services west of the Hudson and north of the New Jersey state line. Since those lines are physically connected to NJ Transit, operations were contracted to NJ Transit with Metro-North subsidizing the service and supplying equipment.

In preparation for the takeover, Metro-North was created as a division of the MTA, with Peter Stangl as president. Once under the MTA&#x27;s control, the agency planned to phase in capital improvements over the following five years. As part of the transition, the MTA needed to negotiate new labor contracts with the 17 unions representing 5,000 Conrail employees who would become MTA employees and had to negotiate the transfer of most of Conrail&#x27;s assets.

Much work was needed in reorganization, as significant business success would not appear for at least two decades, following the faltering railroad industry in the 1970s. Conrail and later Metro-North had decided to trim whatever services they felt were unnecessary. A significant portion of the old New York Central Central Harlem line between Millerton and Chatham, New York was abandoned by Conrail, leaving northeastern Dutchess and Columbia counties with no rail transportation. Most commuter lines were kept in service although they were in much need of repair.

==== Strike ====
On March 7, 1983, after labor negotiations between the MTA and the United Transportation Union (UTU) broke off, Metro-North employees went on strike. Commuters were left to carpool or use shuttle buses running to subway stations in the Bronx. Metro-North wanted to eliminate minimum staffing requirements and wanted the complete freedom to assign crews–a demand that the employees would not agree to. This was the first strike to shut down the New Haven, Harlem, and Hudson at the same time since January 1961. The UTU also went on strike against NJ Transit, which took over Conrail lines in New Jersey, and against SEPTA in Philadelphia. Two weeks into the strike, Metro-North President Peter Stangl estimated that it lost $80,000 a week due to the strike. The chairman of the MTA&#x27;s finance committee, Stephen Berger, feared that Metro-North would lose 5% of its pre-strike ridership of 90,000–costing the railroad $1.3 million.

Richard Ravitch, the MTA Chairman, asked President Reagan to seek legislation to place the dispute under the law of New York State. Even though Metro-North was a state agency, the workers remained under federal law because Conrail was a federal agency. Reagan had turned down a request by Governor Mario Cuomo to intervene, but indicated that he would listen if a congressionally approved proposal was issued. The strike lasted six weeks, and ended on April 18 when the two sides agreed to binding arbitration.

==== Initial investments ====
The first major project undertaken by Metro-North was the extension of the third-rail electrification on the Harlem line from to a new station at Brewster North (since renamed ). This was completed in 1984. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, all wayside signals that did not protect switches and interlockings north of Grand Central were removed and replaced by modern cab signaling.

In October 1998, the New York State Department of Transportation announced that the Newburgh–Beacon Shuttle would be developed in conjunction with Metro-North, running from the Beacon station on the Hudson Line to the Newburgh park-and-ride on Route 17K.

==== Recent initiatives ====
Metro-North spent the better part of its early days updating and repairing its infrastructure. Stations, track, and rolling stock all needed to be repaired, renovated, or replaced. The railroad succeeded and by the mid 90s gained both respect and monetary success, according to the MTA&#x27;s website. 2006 was the best year for the division, with a 97.8% rate of on-time trains, record ridership (76.9 million people), and a passenger satisfaction rating of 92%. In December 2017, the MTA announced that the Metro-North Railroad stations at , , , , and , would receive a complete overhaul as part of the Enhanced Station Initiative and would be entirely closed for up to 6 months. Updates would include cellular service, Wi-Fi, USB charging stations, interactive service advisories, and maps.

The Harlem and Hudson lines and the Park Avenue mainline to Grand Central were previously owned by Midtown TDR Ventures LLC, who bought them from the corporate successors to Penn Central. The MTA had a lease extending to the year 2274 and an option to buy starting in 2017. The MTA exercised their option to buy what was now Argent Ventures&#x27; rail assets on November 13, 2018. Under the terms of the deal, the MTA purchased Grand Central Terminal, as well as the Hudson Line from Grand Central to a point 2 miles (3.2 km) north of Poughkeepsie, and the Harlem Line from Grand Central to Dover Plains.

== Infrastructure ==
=== East of Hudson ===

==== Propulsion systems ====
Most services running into Grand Central Terminal are electrically powered.

Diesel trains into Grand Central use General Electric P32AC-DM electro-diesel locomotives capable of switching to a pure electric mode. These locomotives have contact shoes compatible with Metro-North&#x27;s under-running 750 V DC third rail power distribution system. Shoreliner series coaches are used in push-pull operation.

On the Hudson Line, local trains between Grand Central and are powered by third rail. Through trains to Poughkeepsie are diesel powered and do not require a change of locomotive at Croton-Harmon. The Harlem Line has third rail from Grand Central Terminal to Southeast and trains are powered by diesel north to . At most times, passengers between Southeast and Wassaic must change at Southeast to a diesel train powered by Brookville BL20-GH locomotives. Electric service on the Hudson and Harlem lines uses M3 and M7 MU cars.

The New Haven Line is unique in that trains use both third rail and 12.5 kV AC from overhead catenary. The line from Grand Central Terminal to uses third rail, while the section from Pelham east to New Haven State Street, which is , uses overhead catenary. These electrification systems overlap between Mount Vernon East and Pelham stations and trains change power systems from one to the other while running between the stations. Multi-system M8 railcars equipped with third rail shoes and pantographs are used for electric service on the line.

The New Canaan Branch also uses overhead catenary. The Danbury Branch was electrified, but became a diesel line in 1961. The Waterbury Branch, the only east-of-Hudson Metro-North service which has no direct service to Grand Central, is diesel only.

Power is collected from the bottom of the third rail as opposed to the top, used by other third rail systems, including the Long Island Rail Road and New York City Subway. This system is known as the Wilgus-Sprague third rail, and the SEPTA Market–Frankford Line in Philadelphia and Metro-North are the only two systems in North America that use it. It allows the third rail to be completely insulated from above, thus decreasing the chances of a person being electrocuted by coming in contact with the rail. It also reduces the impact of icing in winter.

==== Signaling and safety appliances ====
The Hudson, Harlem and New Haven lines and the New Canaan branch and all passenger rolling stock is equipped with cab signalling, which displays the appropriate block signal in the engineer&#x27;s cab. All rolling stock is equipped with Automatic Train Control (ATC), which enforces the speed dictated by the cab signal by a penalty brake application should the engineer fail to obey it. There are no intermediate wayside signals between interlockings: operation is solely by cab signal. Wayside signals remain at interlockings. These are a special type of signal, a go, a slow or a stop signal. They do not convey information about traffic in the blocks ahead – the cab signal conveys block information.

Metro-North began upgrading its Operations Control Center in Grand Central Terminal in 2008. All control hardware was replaced and software upgrades were performed. The new OCC at Grand Central opened over the weekend of July 18, 2010.

=== West of Hudson ===

Most of the rolling stock on west-of-Hudson lines consists of Metro-North owned and marked Comet V cars, although occasionally other NJ Transit (NJT) cars are used as the two railroads pool equipment. The trains are also usually handled by EMD GP40FH-2, GP40PH-2, F40PH-3C, Alstom PL42AC, or Bombardier ALP-45DP locomotives, although any Metro-North or NJ Transit diesel can show up. Metro-North owned and marked equipment operated by NJ Transit can also be seen on other NJ Transit lines.

== Rolling stock ==

The Metro-North Railroad uses an electric fleet of M3A, M7A, and M8 electric multiple units. Multiple diesel locomotives and push-pull coaches are in use as well.

Although Metro-North uses many abbreviations (MNCR, MNR, MN, etc.) the only official reporting marks registered and recognized on AEI scanner tags is &#x27;MNCW&#x27;. Rolling stock owned by the Connecticut Department of Transportation bears the CTDOT seal and either the New Haven (&quot;NH&quot;) logo or the MTA logo and is identified using the reporting mark &#x27;CNDX&#x27;.

== Fare policies ==

Metro-North offers many different ticket types and prices depending on the frequency of travel and distance of the ride. While the fare policies of the east of Hudson and west of Hudson divisions are essentially the same, west of Hudson trains are operated by NJ Transit using its ticketing system.

=== East of Hudson ===
Tickets may be bought from a ticket office at stations, ticket vending machines (TVMs), online through the &quot;WebTicket&quot; program or through apps for iOS and Android devices, or on the train. Monthly tickets may be bought through the MTA&#x27;s &quot;Mail&amp;Ride&quot; program where monthly passes are delivered by mail. There is a discount for buying tickets online and through Mail&amp;Ride. A surcharge is added if a ticket is purchased on a train.

Ticket types available include One-way, Round-trip (two One-way tickets), 10-trip, Weekly (unlimited travel for one calendar week), Monthly (unlimited travel for one calendar month), and special student and disabled fare tickets. MetroCards are available on the reverse side of the Round-trip, Weekly, and Monthly tickets.

All tickets to/from Manhattan (Grand Central Terminal and Harlem–125th Street) are distinguished as being peak or off-peak. Peak fares, substantially higher than off-peak, apply on weekdays to travel to Manhattan on trains that arrive in Grand Central between 6 am and 10 am, and to travel from Manhattan on trains that leave Grand Central between 6 am and 9 am and 4 pm and 8 pm. Note that peak fares do &quot;not&quot; apply to travel to Manhattan on trains that arrive in Grand Central during the afternoon/evening rush hour. Off-peak fares are charged at all other times on weekdays, and off-peak fares are charged all day Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. Tickets for travel outside Manhattan, including tickets for travel to/from the Bronx, are called Intermediate tickets and are not subject to peak fares.

Metro-North stations are split between 14 zones in New York state. In Connecticut, the fare structure is more complex due to the many branches on the New Haven Line. Generally, these zones correspond to express stops on the lines and from &quot;blocks&quot; of service within the schedules.

In 2017, it was announced that the MetroCard fare payment system, used on New York City-area rapid transit and bus systems, would be phased out and replaced by OMNY, a contactless fare payment system. Fare payment would be made using Apple Pay, Google Wallet, debit/credit cards with near-field communication enabled, or radio-frequency identification cards. As part of the implementation of OMNY, the MTA also plans to use the system in the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad.

==== CityTicket ====
In 2003, the LIRR and Metro-North started a pilot program in which passengers traveling within New York City were allowed to buy one-way tickets for $2.50. The special reduced-fare CityTicket, proposed by the New York City Transit Riders Council, was formally introduced in 2004. The discounted fares were initially only available for travel on Saturdays and Sundays. In March 2022, it was expanded to include all off-peak trains throughout the week for $5. The MTA announced plans in December 2022 to allow CityTickets to be used on peak trains as well; governor Kathy Hochul confirmed these plans the next month. The peak CityTickets, as announced in July 2023, would cost $7 each. As part of a one-year pilot program starting in July 2024, monthly tickets for Metro-North trips entirely within New York City would also receive a 10% discount.

CityTicket is valid for travel that begins and ends within New York City. CityTickets can only be bought before boarding, except at Willets Point on the Long Island Rail Road where they can be purchased on board, and they must be used on the day of purchase.
=== West of Hudson ===
All West of Hudson stations are included in NJ Transit&#x27;s fare structure, and a single ticket may be purchased for travel between any two stations on either system.

== Plans ==

=== East of Hudson ===

==== Hudson Line ====

On May 23, 2009, Metro-North opened , a station with direct, game-day &quot;Yankee Clipper&quot; trains from all East of Hudson lines. Trains from the New Haven and Harlem lines gain access via the wye at Mott Haven Junction, the first time that scheduled revenue service has operated across this section of the wye.

Northward expansion of the Hudson Line has often met opposition from residents of communities including Hyde Park and Rhinecliff, even though the latter is home to Amtrak&#x27;s Rhinecliff station, frequented by commuters from northern Dutchess and northern Ulster Counties. Supervisors of some towns north of Poughkeepsie began expressing interest in extending rail service in 2007.

==== Harlem Line ====

There are plans to redevelop the former Wingdale Psychiatric Center into a mixed-use commercial and residential neighborhood known as Dover Knolls, centered around the station.

Northward expansion took place most recently when it was extended from Dover Plains to Wassaic in 2000, requiring a costly rebuilding of tracks that had been abandoned years before. Going further north would require substantial investment to rebuild tracks, grade crossings, stations and other facilities that were removed long ago, and obtaining eminent domain for the train property used by the Harlem Valley Rail Trail. Expansion of either line would probably be limited to Dutchess County, as extending Metro-North into Columbia County, and thus to Chatham, would require changes to the MTA charter, and residents of that county would become subject to the MTA tax.

In 2014, Metro-North officials announced that they would be installing security cameras at all stations on the Harlem and New Haven Lines in order to address public safety concerns. These concerns arose from an incident on September 29, 2013, where the body of 17-year-old Mount Saint Michael Academy student Matthew Wallace was found on the tracks of the station. Wallace, who was inebriated at the time, was killed when a northbound train struck him while he was standing on the platform. Due to the lack of cameras at the station, footage of his death did not exist.

==== New Haven Line ====

Discussions are underway to re-electrify the Danbury Branch with a concurrent expansion to New Milford. Connecticut officials and Metro-North also began construction of a new station in West Haven in November 2010. It was opened on August 18, 2013. CTDOT is also moving forward on a study to increase freight service on the New Haven Line in an effort to reduce the number of trucks on the congested Connecticut Turnpike. Metro-North has upgraded most of the original 1907–1914 New Haven Railroad catenary system, a project begun in the early 1990s and scheduled to finish in mid-2018. The Danbury Branch is to receive $30 million for station upgrades along the line as well as implementation of a new signal system.

Plans to extend the Waterbury Branch northeast from Waterbury are under discussion. The extension would bring passenger rail service to central Connecticut, including the two largest cities in Connecticut without passenger rail service, Bristol and New Britain, and on to Hartford, where transfers to Amtrak would be possible.

In 2014, Metro-North officials announced that they would be installing security cameras at all stations on the Harlem and New Haven Lines in order to address public safety concerns.

==== Penn Station Access ====

In September 2009, Metro-North announced plans for a $1.7 million environmental impact statement on accessing Penn Station; although this possibility had been considered for several decades, it was never pursued because there was no space for any more trains in Penn Station. The project therefore depended upon the completion of East Side Access, which redirected some Long Island Rail Road trains from Penn Station to Grand Central upon its completion in early 2023. Weekday Metro-North service in the Bronx includes 253 daily trains with approximately 13,200 daily boardings. In addition, Metro-North also connects 5,000 Bronx residents to suburban jobs, making it the largest rail reverse-commute market in the United States. Governor Andrew Cuomo publicly and strongly supported the project in January 2014.

New Haven Line trains would enter the Hell Gate Line through New Rochelle. At Sunnyside Yards, they would enter Manhattan via the East River Tunnels. Stations would be built at Co-op City, Morris Park, Parkchester/Van Nest, and Hunts Point. Open houses were held at each of the four proposed stations in the Fall of 2012. Stations would be wheelchair-accessible, with bicycle parking and multi-modal transfer areas to train or bus. Cuomo endorsed the New Haven Line portion of the Penn Station Access project in his 2014 State of the State speech, stating that some Sandy recovery money could pay for the project&#x27;s cost of over $1 billion. He did not mention the Hudson Line portion of the project.

On October 28, 2015, the MTA Board of Directors approved a 2015–2019 Capital Program which included $695 million in planned spending for the Penn Station Access project. Upon completion of the Environmental Review process, Metro-North will design and implement the track and structural work needed to operate on the Hell Gate Bridge and its approaches in the Bronx and Queens; communications and signals work; power improvements, including third rail, power substations, and catenary; construction of the four stations in the Bronx; and rolling stock specification development for the fleet needed to operate the service. A groundbreaking ceremony for Penn Station Access took place in the Bronx on December 9, 2022.

Service is planned to begin in 2027 at the earliest. The opening of East Side Access in 2023 diverted some Long Island Rail Road trains to Grand Central Madison, therefore opening up slots at Penn Station for Metro-North service. During peak hours there will be between six and ten trains on the New Haven Line to Penn Station. There will be four trains per hour to Connecticut in the reverse peak direction, and there will be two trains per hour to and from Penn Station during off-peak and weekends.

=== West of Hudson ===
The MTA was working with the Tappan Zee Bridge Environmental Review on several options where the replacement for the Tappan Zee Bridge would have included a rail line to connect the Pascack Valley Line in Rockland County to the Hudson Line in Westchester County. A proposed bus rapid transit system using the new bridge was shelved as too expensive, but the bridge was structurally built for expansion with BRT and/or commuter rail at a later date. This is now part of a dedicated bus lane system planned to go into service in late 2018.

Metro-North is considering extending Port Jervis Line service to Stewart International Airport in Newburgh, a move that could make a Tappan Zee Bridge rail line even more useful, as it would serve both commuters and travelers who choose to fly to and from Stewart, instead of the three major New York City-area airports.

== Major accidents ==
* On February 17, 1987, at about 7:05 PM, a slowly moving 14-car Metro-North Hudson Line train collided with an empty Metro-North train returning to Grand Central on an elevated stretch of tracks at 140th Street and Park Avenue in the Bronx. Twenty passengers were injured in the accident, none of them seriously.
* On April 6, 1988, at 7:59 AM, a northbound Metro-North train collided with another Metro-North train in Mount Vernon, New York, resulting in the death of an engineer. Both trains were empty at the time of the collision.
* On May 17, 2013, at 6:01 PM EDT during the evening rush hour, two trains collided when an eastbound train derailed in Bridgeport, Connecticut just east of the Fairfield Metro station blocking the adjacent track just as a westbound train passed traveling in the opposite direction. At least sixty passengers were injured, including five with critical injuries. It also caused a major disruption to other rail service in the Northeast Corridor. Amtrak halted all service between New York City and Boston.
* On December 1, 2013, at 7:19 AM EST, seven passenger cars and a diesel locomotive from Poughkeepsie to Grand Central Terminal derailed in the Spuyten Duyvil section of the Bronx, killing four people and injuring 65, 12 of them critically. At least three cars out of seven were flipped over on their sides. The train was traveling into the curve at an excessive speed of in a curve. Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Empire Service&quot; was halted until 3:00 PM, and Hudson Line service was suspended until December 4.
* On February 3, 2015, at about 6:30 PM EST, a train on the Harlem Line hit a sport utility vehicle at a railroad crossing in Valhalla, New York, killing its 49-year-old driver Ellen Brody instantly upon impact. The fuel tank of the car was ruptured, causing the car and the train to catch on fire, after the electrified and live 700 volt DC underrunning third rail was pulled up and punctured through the roof of the first 2 cars. The accident killed six people, injured 12, and forced the evacuation of hundreds of people aboard the train. The National Transportation Safety Board led an investigation of the accident.

<doc id="301418" wikidata="Q17989657" url="?curid=301418" title="1944 Bombay explosion">
<text>The Bombay explosion (or Bombay docks explosion) occurred on 14 April 1944, in the Victoria Dock of Bombay, British India (now Mumbai, India) when the British freighter SS &quot;Fort Stikine&quot; caught fire and was destroyed in two giant blasts, scattering debris, sinking surrounding ships and setting fire to the area, killing around 800 to 1,300 people. Some 80,000 people were made homeless and 71 firemen lost their lives in the aftermath. The ship was carrying a mixed cargo of cotton bales, timber, oil, gold, and ammunition including around 1,400 tons of explosives with an additional 240 tons of torpedoes and weapons.

==Vessel, the voyage and cargo==

The was a 7,142 gross register ton freighter built in 1942 in Prince Rupert, British Columbia, under a lend-lease agreement; the name &quot;Stikine&quot; was derived from the Stikine River in British Columbia. 

Sailing from Birkenhead on 24 February, via Gibraltar, Port Said and Karachi, she arrived at Bombay on 12 April 1944. Her cargo included 1,395 tons of explosives including 238 tons of sensitive &quot;A&quot; explosives, torpedoes, mines, shells, and munitions. She also carried Supermarine Spitfire fighter aircraft, raw cotton bales, barrels of oil, timber, scrap iron and approximately £890,000 of gold bullion in bars in 31 crates. The 8,700 bales of cotton and lubricating oil were loaded at Karachi and the ship&#x27;s captain, Alexander James Naismith, recorded his protest about such a &quot;mixture&quot; of cargo. The transportation of cotton through the sea route was inevitable for the merchants, as transporting cotton by rail from Punjab and Sindh to Bombay was banned at that time. Naismith, who lost his life in the explosion, described the cargo as &quot;just about everything that will either burn or blow up.&quot;

==Incident==

In the mid-afternoon around 14:00, the crew were alerted to a fire onboard burning somewhere in the No. 2 hold. The crew, dockside fire teams and fireboats were unable to extinguish the conflagration, despite pumping over 900 tons of water into the ship, and nor were they able to find the source due to the dense smoke. The water was boiling all over the ship, due to heat generated by the fire.

At 15:50 the order to abandon ship was given, and sixteen minutes later there was a great explosion, cutting the ship in two and breaking windows over away. This and a later second explosion were powerful enough to be recorded by seismographs at the Colaba Observatory in the city. Sensors recorded that the earth trembled at Shimla, a city over 1,700 km away. The shower of burning material set fire to neighbourhoods in the area. Around were set ablaze in an arc around the ship. Eleven neighbouring vessels had been sunk or were sinking, and the emergency personnel at the site suffered heavy losses. Attempts to fight the fire were dealt a further blow when the second explosion from the ship swept the area at 16:34. Burning cotton bales fell from the sky on docked ships, the dock yard, and neighbourhoods outside the harbour. The sound of explosions was heard as far as away. Some of the most developed and economically important parts of Bombay were wiped out by the blast and resulting fire. The Australian hospital ship AHS &quot;Wanganella&quot; had been moored off Bombay when the explosion occurred. She was subsequntly brought in to port, spending a week treating the wounded before resuming her voyage to Taranto, Italy.

===News===
The details of the explosions and losses were first reported to the outside world by the Japanese-controlled Radio Saigon, which gave a detailed report of the incident on 15 April 1944. British-Indian wartime censorship permitted news reporters to send the reports only in the second week of May 1944. &quot;Time&quot; magazine published the story as late as 22 May 1944 and still it was news to the outside world. A movie depicting the explosions and aftermath, made by Indian cinematographer Sudhish Ghatak, was confiscated by military officers, although parts of it were shown to the public as a newsreel at a later date.

===Loss===

The total number of lives lost in the explosion is estimated at more than 800, while some estimates put the figure at around 1,300. More than 500 civilians lost their lives, many of them residing in adjoining slum areas, but as it was wartime, information about the full extent of the damage was partially censored. The results of the explosion are summarised as follows:
*Two hundred and thirty-one people killed were attached to various dock services including fire brigade and dock employees.
*Of the above figure, 66 were firemen
*More than 500 civilians were killed
*Some estimates put total deaths at up to 1,300
*More than 2,500 were injured, including civilians
*Thirteen ships were lost and some other ships heavily or partially damaged
*Of the above, three Royal Indian Navy ships were lost
*Thirty-one wooden crates, each containing four gold bars, each gold bar weighing 800 Troy ounces or almost 25 kg. (almost all since recovered)
*More than 50,000 tonnes of shipping destroyed and another 50,000 tonnes of shipping damaged
*Loss of more than 50,000 tonnes of food grains, including rice, which gave rise to black marketing of food grains afterwards.

==Suburban relief activities==
D. N. Wandrekar, a senior journalist at &quot;The Bombay Chronicle&quot; newspaper, stated in a report dated 20 April 1944 that &quot;Mumbaikars&quot; () are always known for their good heart which is why around five days after the incident massive relief activities were shifted to the suburbs owing to the neutralisation of South Mumbai from the damages caused. Soon after the calamity people from the affected areas began pouring into the suburbs. About six thousand persons from the Mandvi area, mostly middle class, went to Ghatkopar. The workers and others from Ghatkopar got the three schools opened for their accommodation and private households also provided accommodation to these unfortunate families.

There was a rush of labourers from the dock areas who wanted to get out of Bombay on foot by the Agra Road. Ghatkopar workers opened a kitchen for them at the Hindu Sabha Hall. The kitchen served food for about a thousand persons twice daily. The Ghatkopar kitchen was still running when Vile Parle&#x27;s Irla residents started running a second centre for about 500 persons, where food and lodging were provided for the refugees. A third kitchen was opened at Khotwadi and Narli Agripada in Santacruz where about 300 people were being served. In Khar, arrangements had been made to give rations to about a hundred persons who had found accommodation in Kherwadiand Old Khar village. Khar Danda, a fishing village, had made arrangements for about a hundred people&#x27;s accommodation and food. Many families on Salsette Island, also known as Mumbai suburb, opened their doors to the needy.

==Salvage==
As part of the salvage operation, sub-lieutenant Ken Jackson, RNVR was seconded to the Indian government to establish the pumping operation. He and chief petty officer Charles Brazier arrived in Bombay on 7 May 1944. Over a period of three months, many ships were salvaged. The de-watering operation took three months to complete, after which Jackson and Brazier returned to their base in Colombo. Jackson remained in the Far East for another two years, conducting further salvage work. For their efforts with the pumping operation, both men were rewarded: Brazier was awarded the MBE, and Jackson received an accelerated promotion. An Australian minesweeper, HMAS &quot;Gawler&quot;, landed working parties on 21 June 1944, to assist in the restoration of the port.

==Aftermath==
It took three days to bring the fire under control, and later, 8,000 men toiled for seven months to remove around 500,000 tons of debris and bring the docks back into action.

The inquiry into the explosion identified the cotton bales as probably being the seat of the fire. It was critical of several errors:

* Storing the cotton below the munitions
* Not displaying the red flag (B flag) required to indicate a &quot;dangerous cargo on board&quot;
* Delaying unloading the explosives
* Not using steam injectors to contain the fire
* A delay in alerting the local fire brigade

Many families lost all their belongings and were left with just the clothes on their backs. Thousands became destitute. It was estimated that about 6,000 firms were affected, and 50,000 people lost their jobs. The government took full responsibility for the disaster, and monetary compensation was paid to citizens who made a claim for loss or damage to property.

During periodic dredging operations to maintain the depth of the docking bays, many intact gold bars have been found, some as late as February 2011, and returned to the government. A live shell weighing 45 kg (100 lb) was also found in October 2011. The Mumbai Fire Brigade&#x27;s headquarters at Byculla has a memorial to the fire fighters who died. National Fire Safety Week is observed across India from 14 to 21 April, in memory of the 66 firemen who died in this explosion.

===Ships lost or severely damaged===
Apart from &quot;Fort Stikine&quot;, the following vessels were sunk or severely damaged.

<text>Super Friends is an American animated television series about a team of superheroes which ran from 1973 to 1985 on ABC as part of its Saturday-morning cartoon lineup. It was produced by Hanna-Barbera and was based on the Justice League of America and associated comic book characters published by DC Comics. The title of the series varied from season to season, as did the superheroes on the team. Nine seasons, comprising a total of 93 episodes, were produced.

==Series titles==

Over the years, the show existed under several titles:
* &quot;Super Friends&quot; (1973)
* &quot;The All-New Super Friends Hour&quot; (1977)
* &quot;Challenge of the Superfriends&quot; (1978)
* &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest SuperFriends&quot; (1979)
* &quot;SuperFriends&quot; (1980–1983)
* &quot;Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show&quot; (1984)
* &quot;The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians&quot; (1985)

==Writing==
Plotlines for the later series involved many of the familiar DC Comics super-villains, like the Joker and the Riddler, that the first incarnation of the &quot;Super Friends&quot; did not. Instead, like the comic books, they focused on the far-fetched schemes of mad scientists and aliens, who were invariably revealed as being well-intentioned, and simply pursuing their goals through unlawful or disreputable means. Typically, at the end of each story, a peaceful and reasonable discussion would be performed by the heroes to convince the antagonists to adopt more reasonable methods.

&quot;The All-New Super Friends Hour&quot; departed somewhat from the previous series&#x27; formula by featuring villains using more elaborate methods to further their goals; as a rule they could not be reasoned with, requiring the heroes to use direct force to stop them. Beginning with &quot;Challenge of the Superfriends&quot;, several of the heroes&#x27; arch-villains from the comic books (such as Lex Luthor and the Riddler) began to feature prominently in comic-style stories. Throughout the series, plots often wrapped themselves up neatly in the final minutes of an episode in the fashion of the typical comic books and deus ex machina.

==Production history==
In 1973, animation company Hanna-Barbera acquired rights to the DC Comics characters and partnered with the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) to adapt the &quot;Justice League of America&quot; comic book for television. The network made several changes in the transition including the change of name to &quot;Super Friends&quot; to &quot;cut off any accusations of extreme patriotism&quot;. Nevertheless, team members sometimes referred to themselves as the Justice League on the show. The violence common in superhero comics was toned down for a younger audience and to adhere to broadcast standards governing violence in 1970s children&#x27;s television.

As a DC Comics-based show, the &quot;Super Friends&quot; franchise was owned by DC&#x27;s parent company Warner Bros., who later put the series into syndication. Cartoon Network, which had the rights to air most of the rest of the Hanna-Barbera library from its inception in 1992, was not able to air &quot;Super Friends&quot; until after the merger of Warner Bros.&#x27; parent company, Time Warner and Cartoon Network&#x27;s parent company, Turner Broadcasting System was completed in 1996. This merger also led to Warner Bros. taking control of Hanna-Barbera and all of its other assets as well. The series was owned by Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, DC Comics Entertainment, Warner Bros. Family Entertainment, and Warner Bros. Animation.

===1973–1974 series===

&quot;Super Friends&quot; first aired on ABC on September 8, 1973, featuring well-known DC characters Superman, Batman and Robin, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman. Superman, Batman and Robin, and Aquaman had each previously appeared in their own animated series produced by Filmation, and voice talent from these prior programs was brought in to work on the new show (with the exception of Marvin Miller who was replaced by Norman Alden as the voice of Aquaman). Shortly before the &quot;Super Friends&quot; series was developed, Superman and Wonder Woman also guest-starred in two episodes of &quot;The Brady Kids&quot; (voiced by Lennie Weinrib and Jane Webb under Filmation), while Batman and Robin appeared in two episodes of &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot;.

In addition to the superheroes, a trio of sidekicks was introduced, each of whom were new characters not drawn from the comic books: Wendy and Marvin (voiced by Sherry Alberoni and Frank Welker) and Wonder Dog (also voiced by Welker), none of whom had any special abilities (save the dog&#x27;s unexplained ability to reason and talk). The trio—or at least its human members—were depicted as detectives and/or superheroes-in-training; the &quot;teen detectives and their talking animal&quot; cliché, originally popularized by &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, was typical in Hanna-Barbera cartoons of the 1970s.

Each episode began with the heroes responding to an emergency detected by the TroubAlert computer in the Hall of Justice, which served as the headquarters of the team. Colonel Wilcox (voiced by John Stephenson), a U.S. Army official, was a recurring character who would act as a government liaison with the Super Friends during emergencies. Conflicts were usually resolved with the antagonists persuaded to adapt more reasonable methods to achieve their aims (with the assistance of the heroes). Natural disasters triggered by human (or alien) activity were often shown, and environmental themes featured strongly in the program. Three other DC Comics superheroes were featured as guest stars during this season: Flash, Plastic Man, and Green Arrow; the latter two did not appear in any subsequent episodes of the series.

This first run of &quot;Super Friends&quot;, consisting of 16 one-hour episodes which were rerun several times, concluded on August 24, 1974. At this point, the series was cancelled, but interest in superheroes among ABC&#x27;s prime-time viewers (with the success of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; and the live-action &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; series) caused the network to revive &quot;Super Friends&quot;. The original 16 episodes of the series were rebroadcast as a mid-season replacement, running from February 7, 1976, to September 3, 1977. These episodes were edited into half-hour versions. At the same time, DC Comics published a &quot;Super Friends&quot; comic, which used Wendy and Marvin from issue #1 (November 1976) to #6 (August 1977). In the meantime, Hanna-Barbera began production on a revamped version of the show.

===1977–1978 season: &quot;The All-New Super Friends Hour&quot;===

&quot;The All-New Super Friends Hour&quot; featured four animated shorts per program. Wendy, Marvin, and Wonder Dog were dropped from this and all future TV iterations of &quot;Super Friends&quot;, and were replaced by Wonder Twins Zan and Jayna, and their pet monkey, Gleek. Unlike Wendy and Marvin, Zan and Jayna had super powers. A total of 15 episodes were produced. Darrell McNeil of the Hanna-Barbera animation studios later explained the change in cast: 

The show followed a basic format each week. The first segment of every show featured two of the heroes teaming up in a separate mini-story. The second segment featured a story with the Wonder Twins. The third segment was considered the primary adventure of the week, featuring the entire Super Friends roster (including the Wonder Twins) in a longer adventure. The fourth and final segment featured a story with one of the primary lineup and a &quot;special guest star&quot;. This segment typically featured a problem that was solved using the guest star&#x27;s unique abilities.

Between segments there were short spots with members of the Super Friends giving basic safety lessons, providing first-aid advice, demonstrating magic tricks, creating crafts, and presenting a two-part riddle featuring the week&#x27;s primary plot line. This was the first season to feature two villains appearing in the comic books, Black Manta and Gentleman Ghost. Each appeared in only one episode this season and each was somewhat modified for television.

===1978–1979 season &quot;Super Friends&quot; / &quot;Challenge of the Superfriends&quot;===

The next season of &quot;Super Friends&quot; featured two segments:

====First segment: &quot;Super Friends&quot; episodes====
The first segment of the program featured the established group of heroes: Superman, Batman and Robin, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, and the Wonder Twins and Gleek. They were rerun with intro from the &quot;All-New Super Friends&quot; Hour when in syndication in the early 1980s, but they are seldom seen in syndication since then.

====Second segment: &quot;Challenge of the Superfriends&quot;====
The second half-hour of the show introduced the Legion of Doom, a team of 13 recurring foes who are the Super Friends&#x27; worst enemies. They used a swamp-based mechanical flying headquarters, the Hall of Doom, as a contrast to the Super Friends&#x27; gleaming Hall of Justice. A total of 16 episodes were produced.

Additional heroes who had previously appeared as guest stars were added to the roster as well, to make a total of 11. These included The Flash, Green Lantern, and Hawkman from DC Comics and three Hanna-Barbera creations to reflect diversity: Black Vulcan, Apache Chief, and Samurai.

The &quot;Challenge of the Superfriends&quot; segment was expanded to 90 minutes mid-season, with reruns of earlier episodes filling out the last half-hour.

===1979–1980 season: &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest SuperFriends&quot;===

In the fall of 1979, the &quot;Super Friends&quot; returned to their prior format, bringing back the original set of five DC superheroes and Zan, Jayna, and Gleek. Eight half-hour episodes were created for this run, with the majority of the season consisting of rebroadcasts of &quot;The All-New Super Friends Hour&quot; from 1977 to 1978 and The Super Friends segments from &quot;Challenge of the Superfriends&quot; from 1978 to 1979. Renamed &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest SuperFriends&quot;, this series began on September 22, 1979, and ran until September 27, 1980.

===1980–1982 seasons: &quot;SuperFriends&quot;===

Renamed &quot;SuperFriends&quot; in 1980, the series changed formats again, abandoning the production of half-hour episodes and producing seven-minute shorts. Each episode of &quot;SuperFriends&quot; would feature a rerun from one of the previous six years and three new shorts. These new adventures featured appearances by the core group of five Super Friends and Zan, Jayna, and Gleek. There were also guest appearances from members previously depicted in &quot;Challenge of the Superfriends&quot; and the Hanna-Barbera-created hero El Dorado, who was added to the show in 1981 to provide additional cultural diversity.

This would prove to be one of the longer-lived incarnations of the series (three years). A total of 22 episodes were produced.

===1982–1983 season: &quot;The Best of the Super Friends&quot; (reruns)===
For the 1982–1983 television season ABC ran half-hour reruns of shows from the previous seven seasons, with none of the seven-minute shorts rebroadcast. ABC called the rerun package &quot;The Best of the Super Friends&quot;.

===1983–1984 season: Australian &quot;lost episodes&quot;===
Hanna-Barbera and Warner Bros. had created a syndication package of the earlier &quot;Super Friends&quot; series (co-distributed by LBS Communications); these were picked up by stations across the United States and typically broadcast on weekday afternoons. Not wishing to compete with the syndication programming, ABC dropped the series from the 1983–1984 Saturday morning television line-up but continued to fund the production of new episodes. In total, 24 &quot;lost episodes&quot; were produced, and were intended to only be broadcast in Australia. Three of these episodes received American airings when &quot;Super Friends&quot; returned to Saturday-morning ABC television the following year. The remainder aired on the USA Network in 1995, as part of the &quot;Superman/Batman Adventures&quot; show. The 1983 Lost Episodes of &quot;Super Friends&quot; were released on DVD by Warner Home Entertainment (via DC Comics Entertainment, Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, and Warner Bros. Family Entertainment) in April 2009.

===1984–1985 season: &quot;Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show&quot;===

&quot;Super Friends&quot; returned to ABC Saturday, September 8, 1984, with a new 30-minute program typically featuring two 11-minute stories per episode. This incarnation featured Superman, Batman, Robin, Wonder Woman, and the Wonder Twins and Gleek, this time teamed up with Firestorm. In addition to this core group, episodes during this season also featured cameos by old (and new) Super Friends. The series ended August 31, 1985, and featured comic-book villains such as Brainiac, Lex Luthor, Mirror Master, Mr. Mxyzptlk, Darkseid, and his henchmen from Apokolips. This title of this season and the next featured the phrase &quot;Super Powers&quot; to tie in with a toy line produced by Kenner.

===1985 season: &quot;The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians&quot;===

In the fall of 1985, the next version of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s depiction of the DC Comics heroes began, although it no longer carried the &quot;Super Friends&quot; name. This series returned to a conventional lineup for the team, with a focus on teen members Cyborg and Firestorm. Once again headquartered at the Hall of Justice in Metropolis, the heroes battled such familiar foes as Lex Luthor, Brainiac, the Scarecrow, and recurring villain Darkseid. It also contained the only appearances in the series by Joker, Penguin, the Royal Flush Gang, and Felix Faust.

Notably, it is in this series that Batman&#x27;s origin is depicted for the first time outside of comics.

&quot;The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians&quot; lasted one season before being canceled. The final new episode aired was &quot;Escape From Space City&quot; on October 26, 1985. This third cancellation would be the final one, and &quot;Galactic Guardians&quot; marked the end of &quot;Super Friends&quot;.

==References to the Justice League of America name==
Beginning with the original &quot;Super Friends&quot; season, the opening narration describes the team&#x27;s headquarters as &quot;the great hall of the Justice League&quot;. The opening credits of &quot;Challenge of the Superfriends&quot; names the Super Friends as the Justice League of America. In addition to the appearance of a JLA emblem on a communicator and a reference to a mission to repair the Justice League satellite, the Super Friends are often linked with the JLA. The Justice League satellite is the same design as the Justice League Satellite that appeared in the comics at the time, but is smaller than its comic book counterpart.

==Reception==
In January 2009, IGN listed &quot;Super Friends&quot; as the 50th best animated television series.

==Home video releases==
==Spin-offs==
===&quot;Legends of the Superheroes&quot;===

On January 18 and 25, 1979, Hanna-Barbera ran two one-hour live-action specials under the umbrella title &quot;Legends of the Superheroes&quot;. The first special, &quot;The Challenge&quot;, was loosely based on the Super Friends and the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; series and included several other DC characters who replaced Samurai, Black Vulcan, and Apache Chief: Black Canary, Huntress, and Captain Marvel. The second special, &quot;The Roast&quot;, featured Ed McMahon as emcee of the roast, along the lines of &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot; specials. Due to Warner Bros.&#x27; contracts on Wonder Woman and Superman, they were unable to be featured on the specials.

===&quot;The Plastic Man Comedy Adventure Show&quot;===

Plastic Man appeared in the first season of &quot;Super Friends&quot;, in one episode. Later, Ruby-Spears Productions released a series starring the character in his own solo adventures.

===&quot;Batman&quot;===
A Batman animated series was also considered in the mid-1980s, presumably with Adam West reprising his role as the voice of Batman. &quot;The Fear&quot; was written as a pilot episode for the series, but was instead adapted into an episode of &quot;The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians&quot;.

===&quot;The New Teen Titans&quot;===
In 1983, a cartoon based upon &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; comics began development. It was created as a companion for the &quot;Super Friends&quot;, to be set in the same continuity. Robin was not going to be featured in the cartoon though, at least not as a regular, since in the &quot;Super Friends&quot; universe, he was a member of the Justice League. Like &quot;Super Friends&quot;, the show was to be developed by Hanna-Barbera for ABC, but since shows like &quot;The Smurfs&quot; (airing on NBC) were so popular at the time, this show was never picked up by the network. The show would have featured Wonder Girl as the leader, along with Cyborg, Kid Flash, Changeling, Raven and Starfire. Although the show failed to get picked up, a television commercial with a substance abuse theme did feature the Titans, as they would have appeared in the animated series, along with a new superhero named the Protector who would have been the replacement character for Robin. A Teen Titans animated TV program was eventually produced, adding Robin and removing Wonder Girl, Kid Flash and Protector.

===&quot;DC Super Friends&quot;===

Fisher-Price developed a toy line named DC Super Friends featuring DC Comics characters as toys for young children. A comic book series and direct-to-video original animation called &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; (2010) was developed to tie-in. The video features the World&#x27;s Greatest Super Friends theme, allusions to the Legion of Doom, and the Super Friends and their Hall of Justice.

==Comic books==
===&quot;Super Friends&quot;===
The first use of the &quot;Super Friends&quot; name on a DC Comics publication was in &quot;Limited Collectors&#x27; Edition&quot; #C-41 (December 1975-January 1976) which reprinted stories from &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #36 and 61 and featured a new framing sequence by writer E. Nelson Bridwell and artist Alex Toth. DC published a comic book version of the &quot;Super Friends&quot; from November 1976 to August 1981. The comic book series was launched by E. Nelson Bridwell and artist Ric Estrada. Zan and Jayna were given back stories and secret identities as a pair of blond-haired high school kids; they were more competent heroes than their cartoon counterparts.

While the television cartoons were not part of the same fictional universe as the DC comic books, writer E. Nelson Bridwell made the comic book accord with the other DC titles via footnotes. An example of trying to fit &quot;Super Friends&quot; into the DC Universe:
* Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog were the only ones active at the Hall of Justice, because the Justice League are in the 30th Century with the Justice Society (as shown in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #147–148). Robin was busy helping the Titans in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; #50-52. Bridwell also gave them last names and ties to the other characters&#x27; histories; Wendy Harris was the niece of detective Harvey Harris (who helped train Batman) and Marvin White was the son of Diana Prince (the woman who helped provide Wonder Woman with a secret identity upon her arrival in America). While the show never explained the departure of Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog, the story was found in &quot;Super Friends&quot; #6–9.

The argument for the comic being part of the Earth-One continuity also included the fact that certain elements of the series impacted other books in the DC line:

1. TNT&#x27;s appearance in Kandor in an issue of &quot;Superman Family&quot; that references events exclusively from &quot;Super Friends&quot; issue #12.

2. Sinestro&#x27;s lack of a power ring in an issue of &quot;The Brave and The Bold&quot; after the ring was destroyed in &quot;Super Friends&quot; issue #46.

3. Superman already being familiar with Dr. Mist and the international heroes in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; after meeting them in &quot;Super Friends&quot; issues #7–9 and #12–13.

Because the Super Friends stories were referenced in and the events in them remembered by the characters in the core DC superhero titles - for example, in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #155 (June 1978 - Red Tornado remembers using his powers to break the time barrier, which he did in &quot;Super Friends&quot; #8) - they have to be considered part of the Pre-Crisis Earth 1 ensemble of stories.

In 2008, DC began publishing a new &quot;Super Friends&quot; comic book starring Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash (Wally West) and Green Lantern (John Stewart). Based on the eponymous Imaginext toyline, it is aimed at children (being part of the Johnny DC imprint), with an art style reminiscent to that of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Super Hero Squad&quot;. Written by Sholly Fisch with art mainly from Dario Brizuela, Stewart McKenny and J. Bone (who was cover artist throughout the series), it ran for 29 issues, from May 2008 to September 2010.

===&quot;Extreme Justice&quot;===
In the comics, the Wonder Twins were members of the short-lived &quot;JLI&quot; offshoot, &quot;Extreme Justice&quot;.

===&quot;Young Justice&quot;===
&quot;Young Justice&quot; was a comic series that followed the adventures of a group composed of the latest teen superheroes of the late 1990s and early 2000s, including Robin, Superboy, Impulse, and Wonder Girl. Towards the end of the run, Young Justice was involved in a mission which required them to invade an island whose population was made up of super-villains. To conduct a successful attack, the core team assembled all the then-known teen heroes (including the Wonder Twins). As in &quot;Extreme Justice&quot;, neither spoke English and both seemed to enjoy eating CDs. Unlike their cartoon counterparts, the Wonder Twins were rude and sarcastic.

===&quot;Super Buddies&quot;===

The lighthearted nature of the show was spoofed in the 2000s with two DC miniseries, &quot;Formerly Known as the Justice League&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not the Justice League!&quot; (although these series were more direct take-offs on the 1980s Blue Beetle/Booster Gold-era Justice League). In these miniseries the group is known as the &quot;Super Buddies&quot;, and consists of a team of ex-Justice League members. A television advertisement for the team shows them posing in the postures of the original &quot;Super Friends&quot; title card.

===&quot;Teen Titans&quot;===
As of issue #34 (2006), Wendy and Marvin were part of the DC continuity. They are now fraternal twins (a nod to their &quot;Super Friends&quot; successors, the Wonder Twins), engineering geniuses (having graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at age 16), and are employed at Titans Tower as maintenance crew and mechanical troubleshooters. They were responsible for restoring Titans member Cyborg to full functionality after he sustained damage to his artificial body parts during the events of the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; mini-series. Wonder Dog was also introduced into the series, although (unlike the cartoon) he was not a lovable sidekick and pet, but a murderous, shape-shifting demon dog who was sent to Titans Tower to kill the team. Wonder Dog killed Marvin and attacked Wendy, leaving her crippled from the waist down. Wendy is a supporting character in the &quot;Batgirl&quot; series, where she receives help accepting her disabilities from former Batgirl Barbara Gordon.

===&quot;Justice League of America&quot;===
During the events of the 2005 company-wide &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; crossover the Justice League Watchtower was destroyed by Superboy-Prime, leaving the JLA without a base of operations. To that end, the team established the Hall of Justice in Washington, D.C. to act as an embassy for the team and an emergency base of operations if needed. In the continuity of the comics, the Hall was designed by Green Lantern and Wonder Woman. In &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #46 (2010) Samurai made his first appearance in the DC Universe, where he was shown as one of the heroes driven temporarily insane by Alan Scott.

===&quot;Wizard&quot; magazine===
Issue #77 of &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine parodied the Super Friends; the JLA was sent through a dimensional rift and met some of the Super Friends. After Martian Manhunter used his Martian vision to melt the villain and his machine (much to Green Lantern&#x27;s dismay: &quot;You have to trick him into leaving, or shutting off his machine, NOT direct physical violence!&quot;), the Super Friends decided to send the Justice Leaguers back to their own dimension. As a jest, the magazine also ran an April Fool&#x27;s promotion for a Wonder Twins special by painter Alex Ross. The book, entitled &quot;Wonder Twins: Form of Water&quot;, was to be one of Alex Ross&#x27; oversized books chronicling the Justice League. The plot would see Zan and Jayna using their powers to help the Earth&#x27;s famine- and drought-stricken nations after their monkey, Gleek, contracted super-rabies from severe dehydration.

===&quot;Superman and Batman: World&#x27;s Funnest&quot;===
In the Elseworlds one-shot &quot;Superman and Batman: World&#x27;s Funnest&quot;, Bat-Mite and Mr. Mxyzptlk travel to different worlds within the DC Universe. On one of them, they encounter the Super Friends.

==The Super Friends in other DC media==
===&quot;Superman: The Animated Series&quot;===
In the &quot;&quot; two-part episode &quot;Apokolips... Now!&quot;, Superman is fighting the Parademons in Metropolis. In the background is a building resembling the Hall of Justice, referred to in dialogue as &quot;Metropolis Plaza&quot;. This was likely a reference to Darkseid&#x27;s forces previously appearing in the final two seasons of &quot;Super Friends&quot;.

===&quot;Gen13&quot;===
In the &quot;Gen13&quot; film, the Super Friends were name dropped by Grunge toward the end of the film. When it was unanimously decided that Caitlin Fairchild, Freefall and Grunge were going to become a superhero team under the tutelage of John Lynch; Grunge said &quot;We&#x27;ll be just like...like the Super Friends!&quot;

===&quot;Justice League&quot;===
At the end of &quot;Secret Origins&quot;, the premiere three-episode arc of &quot;Justice League&quot;, Superman proposes the formation of a superhero coalition including himself, Batman, Wonder Woman, the Flash (Wally West), the Green Lantern (John Stewart), the Martian Manhunter, and Hawkgirl. In a direct reference (and perhaps a criticism of the somewhat silly name), the Flash jokingly asks if such a team would be called &quot;Super Friends&quot;. Superman relabels the guild as the &quot;Justice League&quot;.

===&quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;===
In the animated series &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, Gorilla Grodd reforms his Secret Society this time an even larger group of villains. While not called the Legion of Doom (due to DC executives disallowing the creative team from using the name), their headquarters is a craft similar to the Hall of Doom, located in a swamp. Additionally, the Justice League&#x27;s Metro Tower headquarters in Metropolis strongly resembled the Hall of Justice.

The Ultimen, loosely based on characters created for the Super Friends, appear in the episode &quot;Ultimatum&quot;, as allies and later antagonists to the League. The Ultimen consisted of Long Shadow (based on Apache Chief and voiced by Gregg Rainwater), Juice (based on Black Vulcan and voiced by an uncredited CCH Pounder in a digitally-altered voice), Wind Dragon (based on Samurai and voiced by James Sie), and Downpour and Shifter (based on the Wonder Twins and voiced by Grey DeLisle). They are a group of superheroes created by Project Cadmus to be loyal to the government, with Maxwell Lord as their manager. Additionally, they are genetically unstable and have short lifespans, being continuously cloned and implanted with false memories.

===&quot;The Batman&quot;===
The animated series &quot;The Batman&quot; featured a modified version of the JLA Watchtower which closely resembled the Hall of Justice.

===&quot;Batman: The Brave and the Bold&quot;===
The Hall of Justice appeared in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Sidekicks Assemble!&quot;, with a pastiche of the music played when the Hall appeared in &quot;Super Friends&quot;.

===&quot;Smallville&quot;===
The Wonder Twins appeared in the &quot;Smallville&quot; episode &quot;Idol&quot;, with Zan played by David Gallagher and Jayna played by Allison Scagliotti. Gleek did not appear physically, but a cartoonish image of him was shown on each of the twins&#x27; cellphones.

===&quot;Young Justice&quot;===
The Hall of Justice was featured in &quot;Young Justice&quot; as the Justice League&#x27;s decoy base of operations. Additionally, Wendy and Marvin appear as classmates of Conner Kent and Megan Morse. The members of the Injustice League operate out of a base resembling the Legion&#x27;s Hall of Doom.

In the second season, approximations of the minority members created for &quot;Super Friends&quot; (similar to the Ultimen example above) are introduced as teenagers given powers by the Reach. The group consists of Tye Longshadow (Apache Chief), Asami &quot;Sam&quot; Koizumi (Samurai) and Eduardo &quot;Ed&quot; Dorado Jr. (El Dorado). The exception is Black Vulcan, whose place is taken by Milestone Media hero Static (though Black Lightning also appears in the series).

===&quot;DC Nation Shorts&quot;===
The title of the &quot;Super Best Friends Forever&quot; DC Nation Shorts is a play on the title &quot;Super Friends&quot;. Additionally, Black Vulcan&#x27;s costume can be seen in the background of the first &quot;Black Lightning&quot; short. The &quot;Farm League&quot; carries several homages to the Super Friends including its narrator, characters used and graphics.

===&quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot;===
In the &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; &quot;Two-Parter&quot; episode, the Titans go to the Hall of Justice to use the pool, as later, they become members of the Justice League to save the Justice League members from Darkseid. This sequence parodies the introduction of the super heroes as in the &quot;Super Friends&quot; series.

In the episode &quot;You&#x27;re Fired&quot;, Beast Boy is fired from the Teen Titans, and a competition is held to find his replacement. The eventual winners are the Wonder Twins.

===Arrowverse===
The shows set in The CW&#x27;s Arrowverse have featured multiple references to the &quot;Super Friends&quot;.

In the pilot episode of &quot;Supergirl&quot;, Winn Schott considers calling the group of Supergirl / Kara Zor-El and her allies (himself, James Olsen, and Alex Danvers) &quot;The Super Friends&quot;. In the fourth season episode, &quot;What&#x27;s So Funny About Truth, Justice, and the American Way?&quot;, Kara forms a small team of heroes that includes herself, Brainiac 5, The Dreamer, and the Martian Manhunter and directly calls them &quot;The Super Friends&quot;. In the fifth-season episode, &quot;Back From the Future - Part One&quot;, the S.T.A.R. Labs base is noted to be called the Hall of Justice in the future.

In the &quot;Invasion&quot; cross-over event, across &quot;Supergirl&quot;, &quot;The Flash&quot;, &quot;Arrow&quot; and &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;, the secret S.T.A.R. Labs base used by the heroes was based on the Hall of Justice. Also later on in that season, Barry and Supergirl sing a duet called &quot;Super Friends&quot; to escape the Music Meister&#x27;s musical.

Season 2 of &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot; features multiple references to &quot;Super Friends&quot;, including the villainous group being dubbed the &quot;Legion of Doom&quot; by Nate Heywood; in the episode &quot;Doomworld&quot;, the new design of S.T.A.R. Labs in the altered timeline resembles the Hall of Doom. In the final scene of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Barry repurposed the secret S.T.A.R. Labs base previously used in &quot;Invasion!&quot; as the headquarters for Earth-Prime&#x27;s heroes. In the closing moments of the crossover, the unnamed team is disrupted by the confusing sound of laughter (revealed to be an escaped Gleek, hinting at a possible future inclusion of the character and/or Wonder Twins). Afterwards, the camera pans out to the headquarters as music based on the original series plays in the background.

===&quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;===
In &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;, the cast of the &quot;Super Friends&quot; are seen celebrating an anniversary party in the Fortress of Solitude, which Batman was not invited to, featuring characters like El Dorado, The Wonder Twins, Gleek and Wonder Dog.

===&quot;Teen Titans Go! &amp; DC Super Hero Girls: Mayhem in the Multiverse&quot;===
The first incarnation of the Super Friends appears at the end of the 2022 crossover film &quot;Teen Titans Go! &amp; DC Super Hero Girls: Mayhem in the Multiverse&quot;, with the team consisting of Superman, Batman, Robin (Dick Grayson), Wonder Woman, and Aquaman. After Cythonna ends up in the TTG universe, Raven sends the crystal to the &quot;Super Friends&quot; universe. The Super Friends plan to send it back, but they take one look at the Teen Titans fighting over the remote and decide not to.

===Tomorrowverse===
====&quot;Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths – Part Three&quot;====
&quot;The All-New Super Friends Hour&quot; incarnation of the Super Friends made their return in the 2024 final installment of the Tomorrowverse, &quot;Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths – Part Three&quot;, with the team consisting of Superman, Batman, Robin (Dick Grayson), Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and the Wonder Twins.

It is established that the Super Friends exist on Earth-508. Their appearance is brief, however, as their world is destroyed by an anti-matter wave sent by the Anti-Monitor.

==Video games==
===&quot;Injustice: Gods Among Us&quot;===
The Hall of Justice is a playable stage in &quot;&quot;.

===&quot;Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham&quot;===
In &quot;Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham&quot;, the Hall of Justice is one of the game&#x27;s hubs, while the Hall of Doom and the surrounding swamp environs are explorable areas.

==Toys==
===Super Powers Collection===

The Super Powers toy line (and associated tie-in merchandise) was based on the final two seasons of &quot;Super Friends&quot;. Samurai, an original character from the show, and the Hall of Justice were both released. Plans for future waves from Super Powers would have also included Apache Chief, El Dorado, Black Vulcan and the Wonder Twins.

===&quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;===

The toy line based on &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; released a three pack of figures from characters created for &quot;Super Friends&quot;, namely Black Vulcan, Apache Chief and Samurai. They were chosen over the Ultimen characters that actually appeared in the JLU animated series: Juice, Long Shadow and Wind Dragon.

===&quot;DC Super Friends&quot;===
Fisher-Price began to produce DC Comics characters in a kid-friendly toyline named after the &quot;Super Friends&quot;.

===&quot;DC Universe Classics&quot;===

Paying homage to Super Powers, DC Universe Classics produced original &quot;Super Friends&quot; characters such as Apache Chief, Black Vulcan, El Dorado, Samurai and the Wonder Twins.

<text>Jesse Lee Barfield (born October 29, 1959) is an American former professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball as a right fielder from 1981 to 1992 for the Toronto Blue Jays and the New York Yankees.

A two-time Gold Glove Award winner, Barfield was a strong defensive player featuring an impressive throwing arm that allowed him to lead the American League (AL) five times in outfielder assists. He ended his playing career ranked second only to Baseball Hall of Fame member, Chuck Klein, in outfielder assists per 1,000 innings. He was also provided strong offense, winning a Silver Slugger Award and leading the American League in home runs in 1986, the same year he was named to the American League All-Star team.

Injuries prematurely ended Barfield&#x27;s major league career after 11 seasons. He played his final season of professional baseball in 1993 with the Yomiuri Giants of the Nippon Professional Baseball league. After his playing career, Barfield worked as a major league coach for the Houston Astros, Texas Rangers and the Seattle Mariners.

==Career==
===Toronto Blue Jays (1981–1989)===
Barfield was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays in the ninth round (233rd overall) of the 1977 Major League Baseball draft. He made his major league debut on September 3, 1981, going 1-for-4 with one RBI and a stolen base in a 4–3 win against the Chicago White Sox. In the fifth Inning, Barfield recorded an RBI single in off White Sox pitcher Steve Trout for his first career hit and RBI. He appeared in 25 games to close out the season, batting .232 with two home runs and 9 RBI. Barfield became the Blue Jays&#x27; starting right fielder the following season, and hit .246 with 18 home runs and 58 RBI in 139 games. On April 25, he hit the first grand slam in Blue Jays franchise history against the Boston Red Sox. After the season, Barfield finished eighth in American League Rookie of the Year voting.

In 1983, Barfield hit .253 with 27 home runs and 68 RBI in 128 games. The following year, he increased his average to .284 with 14 home runs and 49 RBI in 110 games. Barfield combined with George Bell and Lloyd Moseby to form what many analysts considered the best all-around outfields of the 1980s for the Blue Jays.

In 1985, Barfield batted .289 with an on-base percentage of .369 and a slugging percentage of .536, which was 42 percent higher than the league average or adjusted OPS+. He hit for both power and speed, with 27 home runs, 84 RBI, 22 stolen bases, 22 assists and achieved 6.8 Wins Above Replacement. His batting average was a career-high, and he became the first Blue Jays player to hit 20 homers and steal 20 bases in the same season. That season Toronto reached the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. In his only playoff competition—the American League Championship Series (ALCS)—Barfield batted .280 with one home run, 4 RBI, and one stolen base in the Blue Jays&#x27; seven-game loss to the Kansas City Royals.

Despite the Blue Jays&#x27; failure to defend their 1985 division title, Barfield enjoyed his best personal season in 1986. He collected career-highs in batting average (.289, tying the previous season), 40 home runs, 108 RBI, 107 runs, 170 hits, 35 doubles, and wRC+ (147). His 40 homers led the major leagues and set a team record that lasted one year. Also, Barfield won both a Gold Glove Award and a Silver Slugger Award, and he was selected to the American League All-Star team.

The 1987 season saw Barfield play in a career-high 159 games, hitting .263 with 28 home runs and 84 RBI. He also won his second Gold Glove that year. The following year, his average dipped to .244 with 18 home runs and 56 RBI in 137 games. In 1989, he began the season batting just .200 with five home runs (out of 16 total hits) and 11 RBI in 28 games.

===New York Yankees (1989–1992)===
On April 30, 1989, Barfield was traded to the New York Yankees for pitcher Al Leiter. Barfield finished the 1989 season with the Yankees, and his average increased slightly to .240, with 18 home runs and 56 RBI in 129 games. In 1990, he hit .246 with 25 home runs and 78 RBI in 153 games, but he never produced quite like the club had hoped. In 1991, Barfield hit just .225, although he produced 17 home runs and 48 RBI in 84 games for a Yankees team that was one of the worst in recent history.

By 1992, injuries and general ineffectiveness forced his retirement at the age of 32, after he hit just .137 (13-for-95) with two home runs and 7 RBI in 30 games. He was granted free agency on November 4.

While with the Yankees, Barfield was a resident of Tenafly, New Jersey.

===Final years===
In 1993, Barfield played in Japan with the Yomiuri Giants, reuniting with Lloyd Moseby, but he batted just .215 with 26 home runs and 53 RBI in 104 games.

Barfield joined the Houston Astros for spring training in 1994 and was projected to be the opening-day right-fielder, but injuries prevented him from making the team.

==Career overview==
Throughout his career, Barfield was a free swinger and racked up more than 140 strikeouts in each of five seasons (1985–1987, 1989, and 1990). For most of his time in the Major Leagues, his productivity overshadowed his strikeouts; however, by 1990, one in three of Barfield&#x27;s at bats resulted in a strikeout.

Barfield was a career .256 hitter with 241 home runs, 716 RBI, and a 39.4 WAR in 1,428 games. He was inducted in the Kinston Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 1990. In 2023, Barfield was elected into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Later life==
Barfield&#x27;s elder son, Josh, is a former infielder with the San Diego Padres and Cleveland Indians. Another son, Jeremy, was selected by the New York Mets during the 2006 draft. Jeremy opted to attend San Jacinto Community College instead and was drafted again in 2008 by the Oakland Athletics. He spent eight seasons in the Athletics&#x27; and Colorado Rockies&#x27; minor league systems and two independent leagues before joining the Boston Red Sox organization in 2017.

On August 22, 2006, the Associated Press reported that Barfield was taken to a hospital after he suffered a head injury when he was allegedly shoved down a flight of lower stairs by his son, Jeremy, during a family argument. The incident also resulted in Jeremy&#x27;s arrest on a Class A misdemeanor charge of family assault.

In 2007 and 2008, Barfield served as a color commentator for Blue Jays games on CBC. Currently, he works at Competitive Edge Sports in The Woodlands, Texas.

<doc id="301426" wikidata="Q7547922" url="?curid=301426" title="Snood (video game)">
<text>Snood is a puzzle video game programmed by Dave Dobson. &quot;Snood&quot; was released for Mac OS in 1996 as shareware, then for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows in 1999. An adaptation for Game Boy Advance was developed by Rebellion Developments and released by Destination Software in 2001, and an iOS version was developed by Iron Galaxy and released by EA Mobile on May 8, 2009. Dobson founded Snood, LLC to sell the game.

As in &quot;Puzzle Bobble&quot;, connecting three or more identical Snoods makes them disappear from the board. When the board is cleared, the level advances. If the Snoods reach the bottom of the screen, a life is lost. Play is not time-limited in most game modes.

A sequel, &quot;Snood 2: On Vacation&quot;, was developed by Gravity-i and released by Destination Software for Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS in October and November 2005 respectively.

== Gameplay ==
 The pieces in the game are called &quot;Snoods&quot;. There are seven regular Snoods and four Special Snoods. The regular Snoods are Jake (blue), Midoribe (green), Mildred (grey), Spike (purple), Zod (red), Geji (light blue), and Sunny (yellow).

Each turn, the player launches a Snood of randomly selected color into the playfield. If the Snood lands adjacent to two or more Snoods of the same color, all connecting Snoods of that color vanish and any pieces left unattached beneath the vanished Snoods drop down. The player&#x27;s score increases with the number of Snoods eliminated. With each Snood launched, a &quot;Danger Meter&quot; increases and when it reaches the top, all the Snoods in play lower a level. If the Snoods drop past the lowest level of the playing field, the game is over. Releasing Snoods reduces the &quot;Danger Meter&quot;.

The first special Snood is called &quot;Numbskull&quot;, which is shaped like a human skull and is the one type of Snood that is never launched into play, which means it cannot be joined with other Snoods except Wildcard. If Numbskulls are found at the start of a level, they will have to be isolated and dropped by the player to remove them from the board. If the player loses the game, all the Snoods will turn into Numbskulls, serving as a visual game over message.

The other three special Snood pieces may be launched, and appear at random (and infrequently). One is called &quot;Stone&quot; which is round and gray, and will always knock out the Snoods adjacent to where it lands. Another is called &quot;Wildcard&quot; which appears to cycle through all of the regular Snoods and Numbskull and may be used in place of any of them, but if it does not join any two or more identical pieces together, it would just drop, and if it joins more than one set of two or more identical pieces, even if each set has different piece from each other, all such sets would be eliminated. The last is called &quot;Rowbuilder&quot;, a diamond-shaped creature which will fill one row horizontally with like regular Snoods. In the registered game, users may control how frequently these special Snoods appear.

The premise is simple. Unlike &quot;Puzzle Bobble&quot;, there is no conventional time limit in Snood modes other than Time Attack, but players must eliminate Snoods efficiently enough to prevent the gradually descending ceiling from crushing them. Many levels also require Snoods to be ricocheted off of walls in order to get them in the appropriate spot, which can be tricky. Snood requires considerable skill at approximating angles as well as strategy.

== Awards and recognition ==
Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, Inc., lists &quot;Snood&quot; as one of his favorite games.

Jupiter Media Metrix found in 2001 that &quot;Snood&quot; was the ninth most-played game with 1.5 million unique users. This is most notable because most of the games on the list came with various versions of Windows (such as the top-ranked game, &quot;Solitaire&quot;, with 46.7 million users). The &quot;addictive&quot; qualities of the game have been described in an article titled &quot;Snood: At Least It&#x27;s Not Crack&quot;.

&quot;Snood&quot; received the 2004 Shareware Industry Award for Best Game Action/Arcade on July 17.

&quot;Snood&quot; has been used regularly by the Ronald McDonald House staff at Stanford University as a tool to teach seriously ill children. It has also been used as palliative for patients who are undergoing chemotherapy, bone marrow transplants and dialysis.

&quot;Snood&quot; was voted &quot;One of the Top 10 Things on the Web to make you happy&quot;, by the &quot;Daily News&quot; (New York) in April 2009.

<doc id="301428" wikidata="Q120649" url="?curid=301428" title="Gold Glove Award">
<text>The Rawlings Gold Glove Award, usually referred to as simply the Gold Glove, is the award given annually to the Major League Baseball (MLB) players judged to have exhibited superior individual fielding performances at each fielding position in both the National League (NL) and the American League (AL). The Gold Glove is widely considered one of the most prestigious defensive awards in baseball.

Winners for position awards are determined from voting by the managers and coaches in each league, who are not permitted to vote for their own players. Additionally, a sabermetric component provided by the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) accounts for about 25 percent of the vote. For the utility player awards, the sabermetric component and other defensive statistics are exclusively used to select the winners, without any voting by coaches.

In 1957, the baseball glove manufacturer Rawlings created the Gold Glove Award to commemorate the best fielding performance at each position. Winners receive a glove made from gold lamé-tanned leather and affixed to a walnut base. In the inaugural year, one Gold Glove was awarded to the top fielder at each position in MLB; since 1958, separate awards have been given to the top fielders in each league. In 2020, Rawlings began issuing a Gold Glove Award for team defense, with one recipient each in the American and National Leagues. Starting in 2022, a Gold Glove Award in each league has been awarded to a utility player.

For 2016–2019, a Gold Glove was also awarded each year to one fastpitch softball player in the National Pro Fastpitch league.

==History==
For the first four seasons of the award (1957 to 1960), individual awards were presented to left fielders, center fielders, and right fielders. From 1961 through 2010, the phrase &quot;at each position&quot; was no longer strictly accurate, since the prize was presented to three outfielders irrespective of their specific position. Any combination of outfielders, often three center fielders, could win the award in the same year. Critics called for awarding a single Gold Glove for each individual outfield position, arguing that the three outfield positions are not equivalent defensively. Starting in 2011, separate awards for each outfield position were once again presented. In the 1985 American League voting, a tie for third-place resulted in the presentation of Gold Glove Awards to four outfielders (Dwayne Murphy, Gary Pettis, Dwight Evans and Dave Winfield); this scenario was repeated in the National League in 2007 (Andruw Jones, Carlos Beltrán, Aaron Rowand, and Jeff Francoeur).

Before the involvement of the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) in the voting process in 2013, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; writer Peter Abraham argued the Fielding Bible Awards &quot;are far more accurate (and accountable)&quot; than the Gold Glove awards since statistics are used along with the opinions of an expert panel. The Gold Gloves are selected by managers and coaches who may have seen a player as few as six times during the season. Naturally, statistics can be contentious, and there is still no universally agreed system of fielding stats (even with advanced metrics) in 2024; moreover, a manager gets to see each team in their league during a season, and can indeed form an opinion over that span of whom they felt was the best fielder at each position.

Bill Chuck of Comcast SportsNet New England claimed that Gold Glove voters frequently counted only errors to determine winners. Geoff Baker of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; maintained the votes for the Gold Gloves rely largely on a player&#x27;s past reputation. The Associated Press proposed that &quot;some fans have viewed the Gold Gloves as mostly a popularity contest, even suggesting that a player&#x27;s performance at the plate helped draw extra attention to his glove.&quot; After winning the AL Gold Glove at first base in both 1997 and 1998, Rafael Palmeiro won again in 1999 with the Texas Rangers while only appearing in 28 games as a first baseman; he played in 128 games as a designated hitter that season, resulting in a controversy. Derek Jeter, winner of five Gold Gloves, believes that many defensive factors cannot be quantified. In 2013, Rawlings collaborated on the Gold Glove Award with SABR, who provided the SABR Defensive Index (SDI) to add a sabermetric component to the selection process. The index accounted for 25 percent of the vote, while managers and coaches continued to provide the majority. Afterwards, Jay Jaffe of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; wrote that the Gold Gloves &quot;appear to have significantly closed the gap on their more statistically driven counterparts.&quot; SABR and &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; believed that the impact to the voting results by SDI, which is also included on the voters&#x27; ballots, went beyond its own 25% weight and also influenced the managers&#x27; and coaches&#x27; voting.

===Multiple winners===
The most Gold Gloves ever won by one player is 18 by pitcher Greg Maddux. He won 13 consecutive awards from 1990 to 2002, all in the National League. Brooks Robinson has the most wins for a position player, with 16 Gold Gloves, all at third base, and is tied for the second-highest total overall with pitcher Jim Kaat; both players won their 16 awards consecutively. Iván Rodríguez has won the most Gold Gloves as a catcher, with 13 career awards in the American League. Ozzie Smith has 13 wins at shortstop; he and Rodríguez are tied for the fourth-highest total among all winners. Among outfielders, Roberto Clemente and Willie Mays, who played primarily right field and center field, respectively, are tied for the lead with 12 Gold Gloves. Keith Hernandez, the leader at first base, has won 11 times, and Roberto Alomar leads second basemen with 10 wins. Other players with 10 or more wins include shortstop Omar Vizquel (11), catcher Johnny Bench (10), third basemen Mike Schmidt (10), and Nolan Arenado (10) and outfielders Ken Griffey Jr., Ichiro Suzuki, Andruw Jones, and Al Kaline (10 each).

The only player to win Gold Gloves as an infielder and outfielder is Darin Erstad, who won Gold Gloves as an outfielder in 2000 and 2002 and as a first baseman in 2004, all with the Anaheim Angels. The only other player to win Gold Gloves at multiple positions is Plácido Polanco, who won at second base (2007, 2009 AL) and third base (2011 NL). Family pairs to win Gold Gloves include brothers Ken and Clete Boyer (third base), brothers Sandy Alomar Jr. (catcher) and Roberto Alomar (second base), Bengie and Yadier Molina (catcher), father and son Bobby and Barry Bonds (outfield), and father and son Bob (catcher) and Bret Boone (second base).

The 2021 St. Louis Cardinals hold the record for most Gold Gloves by a single team in a single season with five. They also won the team Gold Glove for the National League in the same year.

==Winners by Year==

==All-time Gold Glove Team==

On February 20, 2007, Major League Baseball and Rawlings announced that an all-time Gold Glove Team would be named during the 50th anniversary of the first Gold Glove Awards. Rawlings asked 70 baseball reporters, former players, and former managers to select 50 names for the ballot, from an initial selection of 250 names. The team was selected by fans, who voted at the Rawlings Gold Glove website, at United States Postal Service offices, and at sporting goods stores. The results were announced at the 2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.

==Teammates==

===Middle infield duos===
In the history of the Gold Glove Award, there have been twelve double-play combinations, or pairs of middle infielders, that have won awards in the same year. Shortstops and second basemen depend upon each other for the majority of double plays. The most common type of double play occurs with a runner on first base and a ground ball hit towards the middle of the infield. The player fielding the ball (generally the shortstop or second baseman) throws to the fielder covering second base, who steps on the base before the runner from first arrives to force that runner out, and then throws the ball to the first baseman to force out the batter for the second out. Mark Belanger won four Gold Gloves with the Baltimore Orioles alongside winning partner Bobby Grich, and Joe Morgan paired with Dave Concepción for four combination wins with the Cincinnati Reds. The most recent teammates to accomplish the feat are Dansby Swanson and Nico Hoerner, who won with the Chicago Cubs in 2023.

† = Hall of Fame

===Batteries===

Since 1957, there have been five Gold Glove batteries. The pitcher and catcher, collectively known as the battery, are the only two players on the field involved in every pitch. In particular, the pitcher and catcher control the running game with tools such as pickoffs or the strength of the catcher&#x27;s throwing arm. The first pitcher and catcher on the same team to win Gold Gloves in the same year were Jim Kaat and Earl Battey, with the Minnesota Twins in 1962. Only two pairs of batterymates have won Gold Gloves together more than once: Iván Rodríguez and Kenny Rogers won with the Texas Rangers in 2000, and again with the Detroit Tigers in 2006. Yadier Molina and Adam Wainwright matched the feat, winning in both 2009 and 2013.

==Platinum Glove Award==

In 2011, Rawlings added an annual Platinum Glove Award awarded to the best defensive player in each league, as selected by fans from the year&#x27;s Gold Glove winners. Numbers after a player&#x27;s name indicate that he has won the award multiple times.

==National Pro Fastpitch==
In 2016, Rawlings announced it would begin awarding a gold glove annually to a female fastpitch softball player in the National Pro Fastpitch (NPF) league.
NPF coaches and managers vote for a winner (excluding those on their respective teams). This award is in addition to the collegiate and high school awards added in 2007, the 50th anniversary of the inaugural Gold Glove Awards.

<doc id="301429" wikidata="Q3851760" url="?curid=301429" title="Linear elasticity">
<text>Linear elasticity is a mathematical model as to how solid objects deform and become internally stressed by prescribed loading conditions. It is a simplification of the more general nonlinear theory of elasticity and a branch of continuum mechanics.

The fundamental &quot;linearizing&quot; assumptions of linear elasticity are: infinitesimal strains or &quot;small&quot; deformations (or strains) and linear relationships between the components of stress and strain. In addition linear elasticity is valid only for stress states that do not produce yielding.

These assumptions are reasonable for many engineering materials and engineering design scenarios. Linear elasticity is therefore used extensively in structural analysis and engineering design, often with the aid of finite element analysis.

==Mathematical formulation==

Equations governing a linear elastic boundary value problem are based on three tensor partial differential equations for the balance of linear momentum and six infinitesimal strain-displacement relations. The system of differential equations is completed by a set of linear algebraic constitutive relations.

=== Direct tensor form ===
In direct tensor form that is independent of the choice of coordinate system, these governing equations are:

* Cauchy momentum equation, which is an expression of Newton&#x27;s second law. In convective form it is written as: formula_1
* Strain-displacement equations: formula_2
* Constitutive equations. For elastic materials, Hooke&#x27;s law represents the material behavior and relates the unknown stresses and strains. The general equation for Hooke&#x27;s law is formula_3

where formula_4 is the Cauchy stress tensor, formula_5 is the infinitesimal strain tensor, formula_6 is the displacement vector, formula_7 is the fourth-order stiffness tensor, formula_8 is the body force per unit volume, formula_9 is the mass density, formula_10 represents the nabla operator, formula_11 represents a transpose, formula_12 represents the second material derivative with respect to time, and formula_13 is the inner product of two second-order tensors (summation over repeated indices is implied).

=== Cartesian coordinate form ===

Expressed in terms of components with respect to a rectangular Cartesian coordinate system, the governing equations of linear elasticity are:

* Equation of motion: formula_14 where the formula_15 subscript is a shorthand for formula_16 and formula_17 indicates formula_18, formula_19 is the Cauchy stress tensor, formula_20 is the body force density, formula_21 is the mass density, and formula_22 is the displacement.These are 3 independent equations with 6 independent unknowns (stresses). In engineering notation, they are: formula_23
* Strain-displacement equations: formula_24 where formula_25 is the strain. These are 6 independent equations relating strains and displacements with 9 independent unknowns (strains and displacements). In engineering notation, they are: formula_26
* Constitutive equations. The equation for Hooke&#x27;s law is: formula_27 where formula_28 is the stiffness tensor. These are 6 independent equations relating stresses and strains. The requirement of the symmetry of the stress and strain tensors lead to equality of many of the elastic constants, reducing the number of different elements to 21 formula_29.

An elastostatic boundary value problem for an isotropic-homogeneous media is a system of 15 independent equations and equal number of unknowns (3 equilibrium equations, 6 strain-displacement equations, and 6 constitutive equations). Specifying the boundary conditions, the boundary value problem is completely defined. To solve the system two approaches can be taken according to boundary conditions of the boundary value problem: a displacement formulation, and a stress formulation.

===Cylindrical coordinate form===
In cylindrical coordinates (formula_30) the equations of motion are
formula_31
The strain-displacement relations are
formula_32
and the constitutive relations are the same as in Cartesian coordinates, except that the indices 1,2,3 now stand for formula_33,formula_34,formula_35, respectively.

=== Spherical coordinate form ===
In spherical coordinates (formula_36) the equations of motion are
formula_37

The strain tensor in spherical coordinates is
formula_38

== (An)isotropic (in)homogeneous media ==
In isotropic media, the stiffness tensor gives the relationship between the stresses (resulting internal stresses) and the strains (resulting deformations). For an isotropic medium, the stiffness tensor has no preferred direction: an applied force will give the same displacements (relative to the direction of the force) no matter the direction in which the force is applied. In the isotropic case, the stiffness tensor may be written: formula_39 where formula_40 is the Kronecker delta, &quot;K&quot; is the bulk modulus (or incompressibility), and formula_41 is the shear modulus (or rigidity), two elastic moduli. If the medium is inhomogeneous, the isotropic model is sensible if either the medium is piecewise-constant or weakly inhomogeneous; in the strongly inhomogeneous smooth model, anisotropy has to be accounted for. If the medium is homogeneous, then the elastic moduli will be independent of the position in the medium. The constitutive equation may now be written as:
formula_42

This expression separates the stress into a scalar part on the left which may be associated with a scalar pressure, and a traceless part on the right which may be associated with shear forces. A simpler expression is:
formula_43
where λ is Lamé&#x27;s first parameter. Since the constitutive equation is simply a set of linear equations, the strain may be expressed as a function of the stresses as:
formula_44
which is again, a scalar part on the left and a traceless shear part on the right. More simply:
formula_45
where formula_46 is Poisson&#x27;s ratio and formula_47 is Young&#x27;s modulus.

===Elastostatics===
Elastostatics is the study of linear elasticity under the conditions of equilibrium, in which all forces on the elastic body sum to zero, and the displacements are not a function of time. The equilibrium equations are then formula_48
In engineering notation (with tau as shear stress),
* formula_49
*formula_50
*formula_51
This section will discuss only the isotropic homogeneous case.

====Displacement formulation====
In this case, the displacements are prescribed everywhere in the boundary. In this approach, the strains and stresses are eliminated from the formulation, leaving the displacements as the unknowns to be solved for in the governing equations.
First, the strain-displacement equations are substituted into the constitutive equations (Hooke&#x27;s Law), eliminating the strains as unknowns:
formula_52
Differentiating (assuming formula_53 and formula_41 are spatially uniform) yields:
formula_55
Substituting into the equilibrium equation yields:
formula_56
or (replacing double (dummy) (=summation) indices k,k by j,j and interchanging indices, ij to, ji after the, by virtue of Schwarz&#x27; theorem)
formula_57
where formula_53 and formula_41 are Lamé parameters.
In this way, the only unknowns left are the displacements, hence the name for this formulation. The governing equations obtained in this manner are called the &quot;elastostatic equations&quot;, the special case of the steady Navier–Cauchy equations given below.

{\partial y} + \frac{\partial \tau_{zx}}{\partial z} + F_x = 0&lt;/math&gt;
formula_60

Using the assumption that formula_41 and formula_53 are constant we can rearrange and get:
formula_63

Following the same procedure for the formula_64-direction and formula_65-direction we have
formula_66
formula_67

These last 3 equations are the steady Navier–Cauchy equations, which can be also expressed in vector notation as
formula_68

Once the displacement field has been calculated, the displacements can be replaced into the strain-displacement equations to solve for strains, which later are used in the constitutive equations to solve for stresses.

===== The biharmonic equation =====
The elastostatic equation may be written:
formula_69

Taking the divergence of both sides of the elastostatic equation and assuming the body forces has zero divergence (homogeneous in domain) (formula_70) we have
formula_71

Noting that summed indices need not match, and that the partial derivatives commute, the two differential terms are seen to be the same and we have: formula_72 from which we conclude that: formula_73

Taking the Laplacian of both sides of the elastostatic equation, and assuming in addition formula_74, we have
formula_75

From the divergence equation, the first term on the left is zero (Note: again, the summed indices need not match) and we have:
formula_76
from which we conclude that:
formula_77
or, in coordinate free notation formula_78 which is just the biharmonic equation in formula_79.

====Stress formulation====
In this case, the surface tractions are prescribed everywhere on the surface boundary. In this approach, the strains and displacements are eliminated leaving the stresses as the unknowns to be solved for in the governing equations. Once the stress field is found, the strains are then found using the constitutive equations.

There are six independent components of the stress tensor which need to be determined, yet in the displacement formulation, there are only three components of the displacement vector which need to be determined. This means that there are some constraints which must be placed upon the stress tensor, to reduce the number of degrees of freedom to three. Using the constitutive equations, these constraints are derived directly from corresponding constraints which must hold for the strain tensor, which also has six independent components. The constraints on the strain tensor are derivable directly from the definition of the strain tensor as a function of the displacement vector field, which means that these constraints introduce no new concepts or information. It is the constraints on the strain tensor that are most easily understood. If the elastic medium is visualized as a set of infinitesimal cubes in the unstrained state, then after the medium is strained, an arbitrary strain tensor must yield a situation in which the distorted cubes still fit together without overlapping. In other words, for a given strain, there must exist a continuous vector field (the displacement) from which that strain tensor can be derived. The constraints on the strain tensor that are required to assure that this is the case were discovered by Saint Venant, and are called the &quot;Saint Venant compatibility equations&quot;. These are 81 equations, 6 of which are independent non-trivial equations, which relate the different strain components. These are expressed in index notation as:
formula_80
In engineering notation, they are: formula_81

The strains in this equation are then expressed in terms of the stresses using the constitutive equations, which yields the corresponding constraints on the stress tensor. These constraints on the stress tensor are known as the &quot;Beltrami-Michell&quot; equations of compatibility:
formula_82
In the special situation where the body force is homogeneous, the above equations reduce to
formula_83

A necessary, but insufficient, condition for compatibility under this situation is formula_84 or formula_85.

These constraints, along with the equilibrium equation (or equation of motion for elastodynamics) allow the calculation of the stress tensor field. Once the stress field has been calculated from these equations, the strains can be obtained from the constitutive equations, and the displacement field from the strain-displacement equations.

An alternative solution technique is to express the stress tensor in terms of stress functions which automatically yield a solution to the equilibrium equation. The stress functions then obey a single differential equation which corresponds to the compatibility equations.

====Solutions for elastostatic cases====

===== Thomson&#x27;s solution - point force in an infinite isotropic medium =====

The most important solution of the Navier–Cauchy or elastostatic equation is for that of a force acting at a point in an infinite isotropic medium. This solution was found by William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) in 1848 (Thomson 1848). This solution is the analog of Coulomb&#x27;s law in electrostatics. A derivation is given in Landau &amp; Lifshitz. Defining
formula_86
formula_87
where formula_46 is Poisson&#x27;s ratio, the solution may be expressed as formula_89 where formula_90 is the force vector being applied at the point, and formula_91 is a tensor Green&#x27;s function which may be written in Cartesian coordinates as:
formula_92

It may be also compactly written as:
formula_93
and it may be explicitly written as:
formula_94

In cylindrical coordinates (formula_95) it may be written as:
formula_96
where is total distance to point.

It is particularly helpful to write the displacement in cylindrical coordinates for a point force formula_97 directed along the z-axis. Defining formula_98 and formula_99 as unit vectors in the formula_9 and formula_35 directions respectively yields:
formula_102

It can be seen that there is a component of the displacement in the direction of the force, which diminishes, as is the case for the potential in electrostatics, as 1/&quot;r&quot; for large &quot;r&quot;. There is also an additional ρ-directed component.

===== Boussinesq–Cerruti solution - point force at the origin of an infinite isotropic half-space =====
Another useful solution is that of a point force acting on the surface of an infinite half-space. It was derived by Boussinesq for the normal force and Cerruti for the tangential force and a derivation is given in Landau &amp; Lifshitz. In this case, the solution is again written as a Green&#x27;s tensor which goes to zero at infinity, and the component of the stress tensor normal to the surface vanishes. This solution may be written in Cartesian coordinates as [recall: formula_103 and formula_104, formula_46 = Poisson&#x27;s ratio]:

formula_106

===== Other solutions =====
* Point force inside an infinite isotropic half-space.
* Point force on a surface of an isotropic half-space.
* Contact of two elastic bodies: the Hertz solution (see Matlab code). See also the page on Contact mechanics.

=== Elastodynamics in terms of displacements ===

Elastodynamics is the study of elastic waves and involves linear elasticity with variation in time. An elastic wave is a type of mechanical wave that propagates in elastic or viscoelastic materials. The elasticity of the material provides the restoring force of the wave. When they occur in the Earth as the result of an earthquake or other disturbance, elastic waves are usually called seismic waves.

The linear momentum equation is simply the equilibrium equation with an additional inertial term:
formula_107

If the material is governed by anisotropic Hooke&#x27;s law (with the stiffness tensor homogeneous throughout the material), one obtains the displacement equation of elastodynamics:
formula_108

If the material is isotropic and homogeneous, one obtains the (general, or transient) Navier–Cauchy equation:
formula_109

The elastodynamic wave equation can also be expressed as
formula_110
where
formula_111
is the &quot;acoustic differential operator&quot;, and formula_112 is Kronecker delta.

In isotropic media, the stiffness tensor has the form
formula_113
where
formula_114 is the bulk modulus (or incompressibility), and formula_41 is the shear modulus (or rigidity), two elastic moduli. If the material is homogeneous (i.e. the stiffness tensor is constant throughout the material), the acoustic operator becomes:
formula_116

For plane waves, the above differential operator becomes the &quot;acoustic algebraic operator&quot;: 
formula_117
where
formula_118
are the eigenvalues of formula_119 with eigenvectors formula_120 parallel and orthogonal to the propagation direction formula_121, respectively. The associated waves are called &quot;longitudinal&quot; and &quot;shear&quot; elastic waves. In the seismological literature, the corresponding plane waves are called P-waves and S-waves (see Seismic wave).

=== Elastodynamics in terms of stresses ===
Elimination of displacements and strains from the governing equations leads to the Ignaczak equation of elastodynamics
formula_122

In the case of local isotropy, this reduces to
formula_123

The principal characteristics of this formulation include: (1) avoids gradients of compliance but introduces gradients of mass density; (2) it is derivable from a variational principle; (3) it is advantageous for handling traction initial-boundary value problems, (4) allows a tensorial classification of elastic waves, (5) offers a range of applications in elastic wave propagation problems; (6) can be extended to dynamics of classical or micropolar solids with interacting fields of diverse types (thermoelastic, fluid-saturated porous, piezoelectro-elastic...) as well as nonlinear media.

== Anisotropic homogeneous media ==

For anisotropic media, the stiffness tensor formula_124 is more complicated. The symmetry of the stress tensor formula_125 means that there are at most 6 different elements of stress. Similarly, there are at most 6 different elements of the strain tensor formula_126. Hence the fourth-order stiffness tensor formula_124 may be written as a matrix formula_128 (a tensor of second order). Voigt notation is the standard mapping for tensor indices,
formula_129

With this notation, one can write the elasticity matrix for any linearly elastic medium as:
formula_130

As shown, the matrix formula_131 is symmetric, this is a result of the existence of a strain energy density function which satisfies formula_132. Hence, there are at most 21 different elements of formula_133.

The isotropic special case has 2 independent elements:
formula_134

The simplest anisotropic case, that of cubic symmetry has 3 independent elements:
formula_135

The case of transverse isotropy, also called polar anisotropy, (with a single axis (the 3-axis) of symmetry) has 5 independent elements:
formula_136

When the transverse isotropy is weak (i.e. close to isotropy), an alternative parametrization utilizing Thomsen parameters, is convenient for the formulas for wave speeds.

The case of orthotropy (the symmetry of a brick) has 9 independent elements:
formula_137

=== Elastodynamics ===
The elastodynamic wave equation for anisotropic media can be expressed as
formula_138
where
formula_111
is the &quot;acoustic differential operator&quot;, and formula_112 is Kronecker delta.

==== Plane waves and Christoffel equation ====
A &quot;plane wave&quot; has the form
formula_141
with formula_142 of unit length.
It is a solution of the wave equation with zero forcing, if and only if formula_143 and formula_120 constitute an eigenvalue/eigenvector pair of the &quot;acoustic algebraic operator&quot;
formula_145
This &quot;propagation condition&quot; (also known as the Christoffel equation) may be written as
formula_146
where
formula_147
denotes propagation direction and formula_148 is phase velocity.

<text>The Cabinet Office is a ministerial department of the Government of the United Kingdom. It is responsible for supporting the prime minister and Cabinet. It is composed of various units that support Cabinet committees and coordinate the delivery of government objectives via other departments. it had over 10,200 staff, mostly civil servants, some of whom work in Whitehall. Staff working in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office are part of the Cabinet Office.

==Responsibilities==
The Cabinet Office&#x27;s core functions are:
* Supporting collective government, helping to ensure the effective development, coordination, and implementation of policy;
* Supporting the National Security Council and the Joint Intelligence Organisation, coordinating the government&#x27;s response to crises, and managing the UK&#x27;s cyber security;
* Promoting efficiency and reform across government through innovation, transparency, better procurement, and project management, transforming the delivery of services, and improving the capability of the Civil Service;
* Political and constitutional reform

The Cabinet Office has responsibility for the following at the UK national level:
* the Home Civil Service
* the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority
* the Government Commercial Function and the Government Commercial Organisation.
* the government&#x27;s digital, data, and technology (DDaT) function is through the Government Digital Service

==History==
The department was formed in December 1916 from the secretariat of the Committee of Imperial Defence under Sir Maurice Hankey, the first Cabinet Secretary.

Traditionally the most important part of the Cabinet Office&#x27;s role was facilitating collective decision-making by the Cabinet, through running and supporting Cabinet-level committees. This is still its principal role, but since the absorption of some of the functions of the Civil Service Department in 1981 the Cabinet Office has also helped to ensure that a wide range of Ministerial priorities are taken forward across Whitehall.

It also contains miscellaneous units that do not sit well in other departments. For example:
* The Historical Section was founded in 1906 as part of the Committee for Imperial Defence and is concerned with Official Histories.
* The Joint Intelligence Committee was founded in 1936 and transferred to the department in 1957. It deals with intelligence assessments and directing the national intelligence organisations of the UK.
* The Ceremonial Branch was founded in 1937 and transferred to the department in 1981. It was originally concerned with all ceremonial functions of state, but today it handles honours and appointments.

In modern times the Cabinet Office often takes on responsibility for areas of policy which are the priority of the Government of the time. The units that administer these areas migrate in and out of the Cabinet Office as government priorities (and governments) change.

==Ministers and civil servants==

The Cabinet Office Ministers are as follows, with cabinet ministers in bold:

Leaders of the Houses of Commons and Lords supported by the Cabinet Office are as follows:

The Cabinet Office&#x27;s most senior civil servants are as follows, as of February 2025:

The Cabinet Office also supports the work of the Whips Offices of the House of Lords and House of Commons.

The Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Cabinet Office supports the work of ministers.

==Committees==

Cabinet committees have two key purposes:
* To relieve the burden on the Cabinet by dealing with business that does not need to be discussed at full Cabinet. Appeals to the Cabinet should be infrequent, and Ministers chairing Cabinet Committees should exercise discretion in advising the prime minister whether to allow them.
* To support the principle of collective responsibility by ensuring that, even though a question may never reach the Cabinet itself, it will be fully considered. In this way, the final judgement is sufficiently authoritative that Government as a whole can be expected to accept responsibility for it. In this sense, Cabinet Committee decisions have the same authority as Cabinet decisions.

==Buildings==

The main building of the Cabinet Office is at 70 Whitehall, adjacent to Downing Street. The building connects three historically distinct properties, as well as the remains of Henry VIII&#x27;s 1530 tennis courts, part of the Palace of Whitehall, which can be seen within the building. The Whitehall frontage was designed by Sir John Soane and completed by Sir Charles Barry between 1845 and 1847 as the Treasury Buildings. Immediately to the west Dorset House (1700) connects the front of the building to William Kent&#x27;s Treasury (1733–36), which faces out onto Horse Guards Parade. The latter is built over the site of the Cockpit, used for cock fighting in the Tudor period, and subsequently as a theatre. In the early 1960s the buildings were restored and many of the Tudor remains were exposed and repaired. Significant renovations between 2010 and 2016 converted many of the floors to open plan and created new office space. The Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms are located on this site.

The department occupies other buildings in Whitehall and the surrounding area, including part of the Government Offices Great George Street at 1 Horse Guards, as well as sites in other parts of the country.

<text>The Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) was a United Kingdom government department. Its creation was announced on 12 June 2003; it took over the functions of the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department. On 28 March 2007 it was announced that the Department for Constitutional Affairs would take control of probation, prisons and prevention of re-offending from the Home Office and be renamed the Ministry of Justice. This took place on 9 May 2007.

It was primarily responsible for reforms to the constitution, relations with the Channel Islands and Isle of Man and, within England and Wales, it was concerned with the administration of the Courts, legal aid, and the appointment of the judiciary. Other responsibilities included issues relating to human rights, data protection, and freedom of information.

It incorporated the Wales Office and the Scotland Office, but those offices remained the overall responsibility of the Secretary of State for Wales and Secretary of State for Scotland respectively.

After the 2005 general election, it gained additional responsibilities for coroners and conduct of local government elections in England.

<doc id="301454" wikidata="Q5243052" url="?curid=301454" title="Dayananda Saraswati (Arsha Vidya)">
<text>Swami Dayananda Saraswati (15 August 1930 – 23 September 2015) was a renunciate monk of the Hindu Saraswati order of sannyasa. He was also known as Pujya Swamiji and was a traditional teacher of Advaita Vedanta. He was the founder of the Arsha Vidya Gurukulams in Pennsylvania, USA; Rishikesh, Uttarakhand and Coimbatore Tamil Nadu, India. He was also the spiritual Guru of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan, (the third-highest civilian award in the Republic of India), for his service to the nation in the field of spirituality in 2016.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Swami Dayananda Saraswati was born as Natarajan in Manjakkudi in Thiruvarur district of Tamil Nadu on 15 August 1930 to Shri Gopala Iyer and Smt Valambal. He was the eldest of four sons. His early schooling was at the District Board School in Kodavasal. His father died when he was eight years old, which meant Natarajan had to shoulder the responsibility in the family alongside his education. 

After completion of his education at seventeen years of age, Natarajan came to Chennai for earning a livelihood, where he learnt English and began his career as a journalist for the weekly magazine &quot;Dharmika Hindu&quot; run by T. K. Jagannathacharya (TKJ). However, owing to nominal income, Natarajan, at the behest of a friend Rangachari, enrolled in the Airforce as a combatant in Bangalore with the GTS (Ground Training Station). He was underweight and could not qualify but was allowed to continue, he later stated that he aspired to be a pilot. Family duties, being his father&#x27;s shraddham (a ceremony performed in honour of a dead ancestor), caused him to leave the Airforce and primarily he did not like the rigidity. &quot;There was no freedom, I felt they were trying to control my mind. I have never allowed anybody to ever control me at any time, no one. That is why I think I am a Swami.&quot;

Natarajan resumed his career as a journalist with &#x27;Dharmika Hindu&#x27; magazine before joining a news agency, &#x27;The Lens&#x27; run by Shri Rajagopal. He also worked for the erstwhile Volkart Brothers (now Voltas Limited). While in his absence his younger brother M.G.Srinivasan took charge of the agricultural fields of the family household and ensured that the family had income to live.

=== Involvement with Chinmaya Mission ===

Natarajan was interested in Vedanta. After listening to the public talks of Swami Chinmayananda in the year 1952, Natarajan was involved with the Chinmaya Mission in various roles and was appointed secretary of the Mission within the first year of its inception. He attended sanskrit classes of P.S. Subramania Iyer, a retired Professor of English. It was Iyer who introduced the meter of chanting the Bhagavad Gita verses that was initially followed by Chinmaya Mission centres, and is followed even today by all the Arsha Vidya centres amongst other centres as well.

Swami Chinmayananda entrusted Natarajan with the responsibility to set up Chinmaya Mission&#x27;s Madurai branch. In 1955, Natarajan accompanied Swami Chinmayananda to Uttarakashi and helped him in the preparation of a Gita manuscript for publication. In Uttarakashi, he met Swami Chinmayananda&#x27;s Guru, Tapovan Maharaj, who advised him, &#x27;You have a duty to yourself which is also important. Stay here, meditate and study.&#x27; Natarajan could not take up that offer at that point in time. However, he promised Swami Tapovan Maharaj that he would return after one year to study with him and he did. Natarajan returned to Madras and took up the editorship of &quot;Tyagi&quot;, a fortnightly magazine of Chinmaya Mission. In 1956, on the advice of Swami Chinmayananda, Natarajan shifted to Bengaluru and continued to edit &quot;Tyagi&quot; which was also moved to Bengaluru. During his stay, Natarajan joined the Sanskrit College in Chamrajpet and studied with Prof. Veeraraghavachariar.

=== Sannyasa ===

In 1961, with the permission of Swami Chinmayananda, Natarajan went to study under Swami Pranavananda at Gudivada to clarify his doubts on Vedanta and self-enquiry. The stay with Swami Pranavananda helped Natarajan learn that Vedanta is a Pramāna (a means of knowledge) to know the truth of the Self. In Natarajan&#x27;s own words,

This shift in his vision about Vedanta impelled Natarajan to study the Shastra with Sankara&#x27;s commentaries. In 1962, he was given Sannyasa by Swami Chinmayananda and named Swami Dayananda Saraswati. In 1963, he went to Mumbai, to the newly inaugurated Sandeepany Sadhanalaya of the Chinmaya Mission, where he undertook the responsibility of editing the magazine of the mission &quot;Tapovan Prasad&quot;. In addition, Swami Dayananda taught chanting of the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads to the students of Sandeepany.

In November 1963, Swami Dayananda undertook a study-pilgrimage to Rishikesh and stayed in a grass hut in Purani Jhadi now known as Dayananda Nagar. He spent three years there, studying Brahma Sutras under Swami Tarananda Giri at the Kailash Ashram.

=== Public talks ===

Around 1967, due to the declining health of Swami Chinmayananda, the Mission approached Swami Dayananda to give public talks and lectures. Between 1967 and 1970, Swami Dayananda travelled to different towns and cities in India spreading the teachings of Gita and the Upanishads. In 1971, Swami Dayananda agreed to conduct a long-term study program at Sandeepany Sadhanalaya, Powai, Mumbai and formulated a curriculum that would unfold the vision of Vedanta. 

Between 1972 and 1979, Swami Dayananda conducted two three-year residential Vedanta courses in Mumbai. In his words,

In 1979, Swami Dayananda established a three-year study program at Sandeepany West in Piercy, California. In 1982, he returned to India and continued to spread the message of the Upanishads through public talks and lectures.

=== Final days ===

Swami Dayananda Saraswati died by the banks of the Ganga, surrounded by his devotees and students in the late evening of 23 September 2015. He had been ailing for some weeks and been in and out of hospitals for some time. He was 85 years of age. Swamiji&#x27;s last rites were performed in the traditional manner as befitting a renunciate. He was buried in a grave, known as &quot;bhu&quot; samadhi, to the loud chanting of Vedic hymns and mantras. Many dignitaries, Hindu leaders and his students were there to pay their final respects. 

== Arsha Vidya Centres ==

=== Teaching ===

Swami Dayananda assisted by his senior disciples has taught ten three-year programs (eight in India and two in the United States) and many of his students from these programs are now teaching all over the world. More than two hundred of his Sannyasi disciples are teaching Vedanta and Panini system of grammar. They form the Arsha Vidya Sampradaya.

=== Institutions ===

Swami Dayananda has established four traditional teaching centres and many more across the globe through his students with a primary focus on teaching Vedanta, Sanskrit and related disciplines. These traditional teaching centres are known as &#x27;Arsha Vidya&#x27; or &#x27;Arsha Vijnana&#x27; (Knowledge of the Rishis). The word &#x27;Arsha&#x27; has been used by many of Swami Dayananda&#x27;s students in naming their facilities to mark their lineage.

The four Arsha Vidya teaching centres that Swami Dayananda has established are:
* Arsha Vidya Peetham, Swami Dayananda Ashram, Rishikesh 249201, Uttarakhand, India
* Arsha Vidya Gurukulam, P.O. Box 1059, Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania 18353, USA
* Arsha Vidya Gurukulam, Anaikatti, Coimbatore – 641108, Tamil Nadu, India 
* Arsha Vijnana Gurukulam, Amravati Road, Nagpur, Maharashtra, 410033, India

These residential centres conduct long-term courses, 1–2-week retreats, weekend study programs and family retreats throughout the year and the subjects taught include the Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, Brahma Sutras and several other related texts of Vedanta. The study also includes the Sanskrit commentary of Adi Sankara on these texts, known as Bhashya. Along with these studies, Sanskrit language is also taught with Panini system of grammar. The Gurukuls also conduct sessions of daily meditation and satsangs. Additionally, yoga, Indian classical music, ayurveda, jyotisha and allied disciplines are also taught.

Swami Dayananda initiated another centre at his birth place, Manjakkudi, a village in Tamil Nadu, under the aegis of Swami Dayananda Educational Trust (SDET). It manages an arts college, two higher secondary schools and a traditional Veda Pathasala. With the inauguration of the Swami Dayananda Memorial, residential study programmes are conducted by the disciples of Swami Dayananda.

Jnanapravaha, a Vedanta study centre, was designed to hand over the legacy of Swami Dayananda Saraswati&#x27;s teachings at his birthplace in Manjakuddi. It is in this location, students of Vedanta discover the study material and resources necessary to further their knowledge in Advaita Vedanta.

The teaching centres founded by Swami Dayananda conduct programs for the public to study the knowledge of Vedanta. There are more than sixty centres in India and across the globe that carry on the tradition of Vedantic teaching under the banner of &quot;Arsha Vidya&quot;.

=== Students ===

The media has referred to Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India and actor Rajinikanth as disciples of Swami Dayananda Saraswati. The prominent sannyasi disciples of Swami Dayananda include Swami Suddhananda Saraswati who administered the Swami Dayananda Ashram at Rishikesh. Due to ill health, he later handed over the administration of the Ashram to Swami Sakshatkrtananda Saraswati, who serves as the current head and chief acharya of the ashram. Swami Viditatmananda Saraswati serves as the head and chief acharya at the Arsha Vidya Gurukulam in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania. Swami Sadatmananda Saraswati serves as the head and chief acharya at Arsha Vidya Gurukulam at Annaikatti, Coimbatore. Swamini Brahmaprakasananda heads the Arsha Vijnana Gurukulam at Nagpur.

Some of his other senior disciples are Swami Paramarthananda, Swami Tattvavidananda, Swami Suddhabodhananda, Swami Brahmatmananda, Swami Paramatmananda, Swami Nijananda, Swami Tadrupananda, Swamini Brahmalinananda, Swami Paripoornananda and Swami Shankarananda. All teachers from the Arsha Vidya tradition impart the knowledge of Advaita Vedanta around the world to seekers as taught by Swami Dayananda Saraswati. 

Prominent disciples include Swami Omkarananda Saraswati, who led the Bhuvaneshwari Peetam in Malamelkudi, Pudukottai and was appointed by Swami Dayananda Saraswati to head the Dharma Rakshana Samithi (DRS).

Other students include Anantanand Rambachan, a professor of religion at St. Olaf College, Minnesota (USA), and Vasudevacharya, previously Dr. Michael Comans, former faculty member in the Department of Indian Studies at the University of Sydney. Radha (Carol Whitfield, Ph.D.) an early student of Swami Dayananda helped establishing Sandeepany West and Arsha Vidya Gurukulam at Saylorsburg USA, Arsha Kulam in California a centre for teaching of Advaita Vedanta.

==Associated organizations, activities, and dialogues==

===All India Movement for Seva===
In addition to teaching, Swami Dayananda has initiated various philanthropic efforts. He founded the All India Movement for Seva (AIM for Seva) in the year 2000, with the vision of transforming society through a network of service, to bridge the urban-rural divide, thereby, empowering every person to contribute to the progress of the nation. The focus was on value-based education and reaching out to the children of rural India through a network of Chatralayams (Free student hostels) and schools. Swamiji proposed not alienate the child during their schooling and that parents are required initially to attend the school until the child is comfortable in the environment away from home.

In 2002, a major project witnessing growth in 2023 was initiated by Swami Dayanandaji. Located in Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu, &quot;Swami Dayananda Krupa Home&quot; provides lifetime therapy and support to men and children with developmental delays. Awarded consultative status with ECOSOC (Economic and Social Council) by the United Nations in 2005, this organization is focused on serving people in the remote, rural areas of India, in the areas of education and health care.

=== Arsha Vidya Research and Publication Trust ===
The Arsha Vidya Research and Publication Trust (AVRandPT) is the source for Swami Dayananda&#x27;s teaching and writings. It is a registered non-profit organisation since 21 February 2005, and is head-quartered in Mylapore, Chennai. AVRandPT publishes Swamiji&#x27;s teachings, covering his decades of classes, public lectures and short and long term courses. These are available in printed book form, audio, video, ebook formats and on card pen drives. The trust has also created a mobile app, &quot;Teachings of Swami Dayananda&quot;, which is available for Android and iOS.

=== Hindu Dharma Acharya Sabha ===
In 2000, as an initiative of the Hindu Dharma Acharya Sabha, an apex body of Hindu religious heads of the various Sampradayas was created and convened by Swami Dayananda Saraswati&#x27;s efforts. A congregation of the heads of various traditions meet, discuss contemporary issues concerning Hinduism and provide leadership and service to the society and country.

=== Dharma Rakshana Samiti ===
In 1999, Dharma Rakshana Samiti was started by Sri Dayananda Saraswati to preserve Hinduism, its vision and way of life as the spiritual culture of India. Swamiji recognised that Hinduism, in present times, needs to be protected and preserved by its adherents.
=== Inter-religious dialogue and international forums ===
Swami Dayananda has supported several inter-religious dialogues. He has participated in Hindu-Jewish conferences facilitated by the World Council of Religious Leaders under that organisation&#x27;s &quot;Religion One on One&quot; initiative. He had also participated in two Hindu-Buddhist summits. The first one, organised by the &quot;Global Peace Initiative of Women&quot;, held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, in 2009 and the second one was organised in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in 2010.

Sri Swami Dayananda has participated and contributed to a number of other international forums including:
* United Nations gathering of NGOs in 1980
* UNESCO Seoul Global Convention in September, 1995
* United Nations 50th Anniversary Celebration in October, 1995
* Millennium World Peace Summit in New York, September 2000
* Initiated the International Congress for the Preservation of Religious Diversity - in Delhi, November 2001
* The Conference on the Preservation of Sacred Sites in Taipei in June, 2002
* Initiated the World Council for Preservation of Religious Diversity in Bangkok June, 2002
* The Global Peace Initiative of Women in Geneva, October 2002
* Initiated a Hindu-Christian dialogue with the World Council of Churches in Geneva, October 2002
* Youth Peace Summit in Nairobi 2003

=== Restoration of temples, practices and worship ===
Swami Dayananda has promoted the preservation of ancient cultures, religious and spiritual practices of India that have survived several millennia yet struggle in modern times due to lack of support. He has started several Veda Pathashalas (Centers of Learning of Vedas) for the preservation of Vedas and Agamas to prevent their extinction due to a lack of infrastructure for learning.

Swami Dayananda had appointed 35 oduvars in ancient Siva temples and paid them monthly allowance to sing the &quot;Panniru Tirumurai&quot;, songs explaining Saiva Siddhanta philosophy.

Swami Dayananda helped building five chariots for Sri Mahalingaswamy Temple at Tiruvidaimarudur near Kumbakonam in 2010 at a cost of more than five crore rupees and provided funds for the annual chariot festival.

Swami Dayananda Saraswati filed a Writ Petition (W.P. 476/2012) before the Supreme Court of India challenging the Constitutional validity of various provisions of the Hindu Religious Endowments and Institutions Acts of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Pondicherry. This matter is now pending before the Supreme Court.

He supported Dr. Subramanian Swamy to defend and protect Ram Sethu when the Union Government wanted to create a channel breaking it. He helped Dr. Subramanian Swamy implead in the Chidambaram Temple Case in the year 2009. Though the Podu Dikshitars and Dr. Subramanian Swamy lost the case in the Chidambaram Temple matter before the Madras High Court, their appeals were allowed by the Supreme Court which by its judgment, dated 06-Jan-2014 threw the Government out of the Chidambaram Sri Natarajar Temple, by setting aside the judgments passed by the Madras High Court. The Supreme Court&#x27;s Judgment in the Chidambaram Temple Case came as a boost for retrieving Hindu temples from Government control.

<doc id="301456" wikidata="Q177576" url="?curid=301456" title="Happy ending">
<text>A happy ending is an ending of the plot of a work of fiction in which there is a positive outcome for the protagonist or protagonists, and in which this is to be considered a favourable outcome.

In storylines where the protagonists are in physical danger, a happy ending mainly consists of their survival and successful completion of the quest or mission; where there is no physical danger, a happy ending may be lovers consummating their love despite various factors which might have thwarted it. A considerable number of storylines combine both situations. In Steven Spielberg&#x27;s version of &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, the happy ending consists of three distinct elements: The protagonists all survive the countless perils of their journey; humanity as a whole survives the alien invasion; &quot;and&quot; the protagonist father regains the respect of his estranged children. The plot is so constructed that all three are needed for the audience&#x27;s feeling of satisfaction in the end.

A happy ending is epitomized in the standard fairy tale ending phrase, &quot;happily ever after&quot; or &quot;and they lived happily ever after&quot;. (&quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; has the more restrained formula &quot;they lived happily until there came to them the One who Destroys all Happiness&quot; (i.e. Death); likewise, the Russian versions of fairy tales typically end with &quot;they lived long and happily, and died together on the same day&quot;.) Satisfactory happy endings are happy for the reader as well, in that the characters they sympathize with are rewarded. However, this can also serve as an open path for a possible sequel. For example, in the 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Luke Skywalker defeats the Galactic Empire by destroying the Death Star; however, the story&#x27;s happy ending has consequences that follow in 1980&#x27;s &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; that are reversed in 1983&#x27;s &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. The concept of a permanent happy ending is specifically brought up in the Stephen King fantasy/fairy tale novel &quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot; which has a standard good ending for the genre, but simply states that &quot;there were good days and bad days&quot; afterwards.

==Features==
A happy ending only requires that the main characters be all right. Millions of innocent background characters can die, but as long as the characters that the reader/viewer/audience cares about survive, it can still be a happy ending. Roger Ebert comments in his review of Roland Emmerich&#x27;s &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;: &quot;Billions of people may have died, but at least the major characters have survived. Los Angeles is leveled by multiple tornadoes, New York is buried under ice and snow, the United Kingdom is flash-frozen, and much of the Northern Hemisphere is wiped out for good measure. Thank god that Jack, Sam, Laura, Jason and Dr. Lucy Hall survive, along with Dr. Hall&#x27;s little cancer patient.&quot;

In Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, the Jewish Holocaust is a grim unchangeable background; viewers know that six million Jews would be murdered by the Nazis, and nothing can change that. Still, the specific Jews who in the film have a name and a face are saved by the courageous Schindler, and their survival in the midst of all the horrors does provide the audience with a satisfying happy ending.

==Examples==
===William Shakespeare===
The presence of a happy ending is one of the key points that distinguish melodrama from tragedy. In certain periods, the endings of traditional tragedies such as &quot;Macbeth&quot; or &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, in which most of the major characters end up dead, disfigured, or discountenanced, have been actively disliked. In the seventeenth century, the Irish author Nahum Tate sought to improve William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; in his own heavily modified version in which Lear survives and Cordelia marries Edgar. Tate&#x27;s version dominated performances for a century and a half and Shakespeare&#x27;s original was nearly forgotten. Both David Garrick and John Philip Kemble, while taking up some of Shakespeare&#x27;s original text, kept Tate&#x27;s happy ending. Edmund Kean played &quot;King Lear&quot; with its tragic ending in 1823, but he reverted to Tate&#x27;s crowd-pleaser after only three performances. Only in 1838 did William Macready at Covent Garden successfully restore Shakespeare&#x27;s original tragic end – Helen Faucit&#x27;s final appearance as Cordelia, dead in her father&#x27;s arms, became one of the most iconic of Victorian images and the play&#x27;s tragic end was finally accepted by the general public. Most subsequent critics have not found Tate&#x27;s amendments an improvement, and welcomed the restoration of Shakespeare&#x27;s original. Happy endings have also been fastened – equally, with no lasting success – to &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Othello&quot;.

There is no universally accepted definition of a happy ending; such definitions can considerably vary with time and cultural differences. An interpretation of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;″s forced conversion of Shylock to Christianity is that it was intended as a happy ending. As a Christian, Shylock could no longer impose interest, undoing his schemes in the play and ending the rivalry between him and Antonio, but more important, contemporary audiences would see becoming a Christian as a means to save his soul (cf. Romans 11:15). In later times, Jews (and non-Jewish opponents of anti-Semitism) strongly objected to that ending, regarding it as depicting a victory for injustice and oppression and as pandering to the audience&#x27;s prejudices.

Similarly, for sixteenth-century audiences, the ending of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; – a formerly independent and assertive woman being broken and becoming totally submissive to her husband – might have counted as a happy ending, which it would not under present-day standards of women&#x27;s place in society (see The Taming of the Shrew#Sexism controversy).

===Don Juan===

Most interpretations of the legend of Don Juan end with the protagonist rake being dragged off to Hell, in just retribution for his many sins (for example, the ending of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;). However, José Zorrilla – whose 1844 play &quot;Don Juan Tenorio&quot; is the version most well known in the Spanish-speaking world – believed that a story should never end sadly, and must always have a happy ending. In Zorrilla&#x27;s depiction, Don Juan is saved at the last moment from the flames of Hell by the selfless pure love of Doña Inés, a woman whom he wronged but who forgave him; she had made a deal with God to offer her own blameless soul on behalf of Don Juan&#x27;s, thus redeeming Don Juan and taking him with her to Paradise.

===The Octoroon===

&quot;The Octoroon&quot;, an 1859 anti-slavery play by Dion Boucicault, focuses on the tragic love between the white George Peyton and the Octoroon girl Zoe. Her one-eighth black ancestry is enough to prevent their marrying. In the American society of the time, it would have been unacceptable to present a play ending with a mixed-race couple consummating their love. Rather, the play ends with Zoe taking poison and dying, the grief-stricken George at her side. However, when the play was performed in England, where prejudice was less strong, it was given a happy ending, culminating with the young lovers happily getting together against all odds.

===Opera===

In 17th-century Italy, Francesco Cavalli wrote the opera &quot;Didone&quot;, based on Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; (Book 4 in particular) and set to a libretto by Giovanni Francesco Busenello. However, Busenello&#x27;s libretto changed the tragic ending provided by Virgil, in which Dido commits suicide after Aeneas abandons her. In Busenello&#x27;s version Iarbas, King of the Getuli, shows up in the nick of time to save Dido from herself, and she ends up happily marrying him.

Fifty years later, Tomaso Albinoni wrote the opera &quot;Zenobia, regina de’ Palmireni&quot; (Zenobia, Queen of the Palmyrans) - loosely based on the historical life of the 3rd-century queen Zenobia of Palmyra, who for many years defied the might of the Roman Empire until finally overcome by the armies of the Roman Emperor Aurelian. She was overthrown and taken captive to Rome, and her kingdom summarily annexed to the Roman Empire. However, Albinoni changed the historical ending of Zenobia&#x27;s drama. In Albinoni&#x27;s ending, after various plot twists the magnanimous Aurelian becomes impressed with Zenobia&#x27;s honesty and integrity, and restores her to her throne.

===Ballet===
Tchaikovsky&#x27;s ballet &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, as originally presented in 1895, ends tragically with the lovers Odette and Siegfried dying together, vowing fidelity unto death to each other. However, under the Soviet regime, in 1950 Konstantin Sergeyev, who staged a new &quot;Swan Lake&quot; for the Mariinsky Ballet (then the Kirov), replaced the tragic ending with a happy one, letting the lovers survive and live happily ever after. Similar changes to the ending of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; were also made in various other times and places where it was presented (see Swan Lake#Alternative endings).

===Novels===
A &quot;Times&quot; review of &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; strongly criticized John le Carré for failing to provide a happy ending, and it gave unequivocal reasons why in the reviewer&#x27;s opinion (shared by many others) such an ending is needed: &quot;The hero must triumph over his enemies, as surely as Jack must kill the giant in the nursery tale. If the giant kills Jack, we have missed the whole point of the story.&quot;

George Bernard Shaw had to wage an uphill struggle against audiences, as well as some critics, persistently demanding that his &quot;Pygmalion&quot; end happily with the marriage of Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolittle. To Shaw&#x27;s great chagrin, Herbert Beerbohm Tree who presented the play in London&#x27;s West End in 1914 had sweetened the ending and told Shaw: &quot;My ending makes money; you ought to be grateful. Your ending is damnable; you ought to be shot.&quot; The irritated Shaw added a postscript essay, &quot;&#x27;What Happened Afterwards&quot;, to the 1916 print edition, for inclusion with subsequent editions, in which he explained precisely why in his view it was impossible for the story to end with Higgins and Eliza marrying. Nevertheless, audiences continued wanting a happy ending also for later adaptations such as the musical and film &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. As seen in one of his preserved notes, Shaw wanted the play to end with Eliza becoming independent and assertive and shaking off Higgins&#x27; tutelage: &quot;When Eliza emancipates herself – when Galatea comes to life – she must not relapse&quot;. This might have made it a happy ending from the point of view of present-day feminism. In 1938, Shaw sent Gabriel Pascal, who produced that year&#x27;s film version, a concluding sequence which he felt offered a fair compromise: a tender farewell scene between Higgins and Eliza, followed by one showing Freddy and Eliza happy in their greengrocery-flower shop; this would have been a happy end from the point of view of Freddy, who in other versions is left trapped in hopeless unrequited love for her. However, Pascal did not use Shaw&#x27;s proposed ending, opting for a slightly ambiguous final scene in which Eliza returns to Higgins&#x27; home, leaving open how their relationship would develop further. Several decades later, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; ended similarly.

===Sherlock Holmes===
The Sherlock Holmes novel &quot;The Sign of Four&quot; included, in addition to the normal detective plot, also an important romantic plot line. While investigating the book&#x27;s mystery, Holmes&#x27; faithful companion Dr. Watson falls in love with the client, Mary Morstan, and by the ending she consents to marry him. A fairly conventional and satisfying happy ending worked well for &quot;The Sign of Four&quot;, but Watson&#x27;s matrimonial bliss with his Mary proved cumbersome for the normal format of the Sherlock Holmes stories in general, which involved Holmes and Watson setting out on a new adventure at a moment&#x27;s notice. With Watson no longer sharing quarters with Holmes on Baker Street but having his own married home, a new adventure needed to begin with Holmes barging into the Watson family home and taking Watson off to an adventure after apologizing to Mrs. Watson for &quot;borrowing&quot; her husband. Rather than having to regularly initiate stories with such scenes, Conan Doyle summarily killed off Watson&#x27;s wife. In &quot;The Adventure of the Norwood Builder&quot;, Watson is seen back in his old Baker Street quarters and the readers are told that his wife had died some time before; the circumstances of her death were never told, nor were readers given a chance to share the widowed Watson&#x27;s grief in the direct aftermath. Readers accepted Mary&#x27;s death without serious demur, though in &quot;Sign of Four&quot; she had been a sympathetic and likeable character. In Sherlock Holmes stories, a happy ending usually consisted of Holmes solving the mystery with Watson&#x27;s help and the criminal turned over to the police (or, in some cases, released magnanimously by Holmes), and readers were satisfied with that. However, when Conan Doyle attempted to kill off Holmes himself, at the tragic ending of &quot;The Final Problem&quot;, readers refused to accept this ending, made strong and vociferous protests, and eventually forced the author to bring Holmes back to life.

=== Science fiction ===
Science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published the &quot;Future History&quot;, a series of stories attempting to depict the future of humanity (particularly, of the United States). Heinlein&#x27;s plan included the writing of two interlinked novellas set in the Twenty-First Century (then a distant future time). The first would have depicted a charismatic preacher named Nehemiah Scudder getting himself elected President of The United States, seizing dictatorial power and establishing a tyrannical theocracy which would last to the end of his life and several generations after; the second - depicting the successful revolution which finally brings down the theocracy and restores democracy. In fact, as Heinlein explained to his readers, he found himself unable to write in full the first part - which would have been &quot;too depressing&quot;, ending as it had to with the villain&#x27;s total victory. Rather, Heinlein contented himself with a brief summary describing Scudder&#x27;s rise, prefacing the novella If This Goes On— which ends happily with the overthrow of the theocracy and the restoration of a democratic regime.

In another Heinlein work, Podkayne of Mars, the author&#x27;s original text ended tragically. The book&#x27;s eponymous protagonist, an interplanetary adventuring teenage girl, flees the scene of an impending nuclear blast in the swamps of Venus, only to remember that an extraterrestrial baby was left behind. She goes back and gets killed in the blast, saving the baby by shielding it with her own body. This ending did not please Heinlein&#x27;s publisher, who demanded and got a rewrite over the author&#x27;s bitter objections. In a letter to Lurton Blassingame, his literary agent, Heinlein complained that it would be like &quot;revising Romeo and Juliet to let the young lovers live happily ever after.&quot; He also declared that changing the end &quot;isn&#x27;t real life, because in real life, not everything ends happily.&quot; Despite his objections, Heinlein had to give in and when first published in 1963, the book had an amended ending, in which Podkayne survives though needing prolonged hospitalization. Heinlein, however, did not give up. At his insistence, the 1993 Baen edition included both endings (which differ only on the last page) and featured a &quot;pick the ending&quot; contest, in which readers were asked to submit essays on which ending they preferred. The 1995 edition included both endings, Jim Baen&#x27;s own postlude to the story, and twenty-five of the essays. The ending in which Podkayne dies was declared the winner. Among the reasons why readers favored this ending were that they felt Heinlein should have been free to create his own story, and also that they believed the changed ending turned a tragedy into a mere adventure, and not a very well constructed one at that. This restored tragic ending has appeared in all subsequent editions.

A basic theme of Joe Haldeman&#x27;s &quot;The Forever War&quot; is the protagonist being trapped in a centuries-long, futile space war. While remaining young due to traveling at relativistic speeds, he feels a growing alienation as human society is changing and becoming increasingly strange and incomprehensible to him. For example, he is appointed as the commanding officer of a &quot;strike force&quot; whose soldiers are exclusively homosexual, and who resent being commanded by a heterosexual. Later in the book, he finds that while he was fighting in space, humanity has begun to clone itself, resulting in a new, collective species calling itself simply &quot;Man&quot;. Luckily for the protagonist, &quot;Man&quot; has established several colonies of old-style, heterosexual humans, just in case the evolutionary change proves to be a mistake. In one of these colonies, the protagonist is happily reunited with his long-lost beloved and they embark upon monogamous marriage and on having children through sexual reproduction and female pregnancy – an incredibly archaic and old-fashioned way of life for most of that time&#x27;s humanity, but very satisfying for that couple.

=== Fantasy ===
A central element in the Black Magician trilogy by Trudi Canavan is the developing relations of protagonist Sonea with the powerful magician Akkarin. At first she fears and distrusts him, but as she grows to understand his motivations and to share his difficult and dangerous struggle, the two fall very deeply in love with each other. However, at the end of the final part, The High Lord, Akkarin sacrifices himself, giving all his power to Sonea and dying so that she could defeat their enemies, the evil Ichani. The grieving Sonea is left to bear Akkarin&#x27;s child and carry on his magical work as best she can. Many readers were shocked by this ending. To repeated queries on why Akkarin had to die, Canavan answered &quot;When the idea came to me for this final scene I knew I had a story worth giving up full time work to write, because at the time I was utterly sick of books where all the characters are alive and happily shacked up with a love interest by the end. If characters died it was in some expected way that left you feeling warm and fuzzy about their &#x27;sacrifice&#x27;. Death shouldn&#x27;t leave you feeling warm and fuzzy. Akkarin was a casualty of war. War is a cruel and random killer. It doesn&#x27;t kill based on who deserves it more or less. And, hey, you&#x27;re never going to forget that ending!&quot;. However, many of the fans refused to accept Akkarin&#x27;s death as final. A fan identifying herself as &quot;RobinGabriella&quot; wrote and posted an alternate ending letting Akkarin live: &quot;The ending I really wanted but never got. Akkarin lives! This is for all you people who wanted Sonea to be happy at long last, wanted a happy ending, or just wanted Akkarin for yourselves. Enjoy!&quot;

===Hollywood films===

In numerous cases, Hollywood studios adapting literary works into film added a happy ending which did not appear in the original. 
* Mary Shelley&#x27;s 1818 novel, &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, ended with the deaths of Victor Frankenstein and Elizabeth Lavenza. In the 1931 film adaption they survive and marry. 
* C. S. Forester&#x27;s 1935 novel &quot;The African Queen&quot; has a British couple, stranded in Africa during the First World War, hatch a plot to sink a German gunboat; they make an enormous, dedicated struggle, with boundless effort and sacrifice, but at the last moment their quest ends with failure and futility. In the 1951 film adaptation they succeed, and get to see the German boat sink (just in time to save them from being hanged by the Germans). 
* Truman Capote&#x27;s 1958 novella &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; ended with the main character, Holly Golightly, going her own solitary way and disappearing from the male protagonist&#x27;s life. In the 1961 film made on its base she finally accepts the love he offers her and the film ends with their warmly embracing, oblivious of a pouring rain.
* Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s fairy tale &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; ends with the protagonist mermaid making a noble sacrifice, resigned to seeing her beloved prince marrying another woman. She is, however, unexpectedly rewarded for the sacrifice by the chance to earn herself an immortal soul by further good deeds in air-spirit form. As written by Andersen, acquiring an immortal soul had been her main objective from the start, with the prince chiefly a means to this end, and thus Andersen may have meant this as a &quot;spiritual happy ending&quot;. However, the 1989 Disney adaptation paid much less attention to the spiritual aspect and focused on the love interest, and they replaced Andersen&#x27;s ending and presented the American public with a less subtle one and more conventional ending: the mermaid (Ariel) does get to happily marry her prince (Eric). Disney later added a sequel, obviously impossible for the Andersen original, focused on the child born of that marriage.
* Herman Wouk&#x27;s novel &quot;Marjorie Morningstar&quot; ends with the formerly vibrant protagonist giving up her dreams of an artistic career, marrying a mediocre middle-class man approved by her parents and becoming totally reconciled to the commonplace life of a suburban housewife and mother. In her review for Slate Magazine, Alana Newhouse wrote that &quot;most female readers cry when they reach the end of this book, and for good reason. Marjorie Morningstar, as they came to know her, has become another woman entirely&quot;; Newhouse expressed the opinion that an adaptation to a film or a stage play which would keep the book&#x27;s ending &quot;would not run for a week&quot;. But the makers of the film version did change the ending, letting Marjorie end up in the loving arms of a talented, sensitive and warm-hearted playwright – whom she unwisely rejected in the book, and who in the film version can be expected to encourage and support her in launching her own artistic career.
* George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; has a particularly harsh ending, with the protagonists Winston and Julia being totally broken by the totalitarian state against which they tried to rebel, their subversive &quot;criminal thoughts&quot; driven out of their minds and being forced to betray each other and destroy their love for each other. The 1956 adaptation had two alternate endings made. One, faithful to the Orwell original, ended with a rehabilitated and brainwashed Winston fervently joining the crowd cheering &quot;Long live Big Brother!&quot;. The alternate ending had Winston rebelling against his brainwashing and starting to shout, &quot;Down with Big Brother&quot;, whereupon he is shot down. Julia runs to his aid and suffers the same fate. Clearly, the theme of two individuals waging a foredoomed rebellion against an all-powerful oppressive state effectively precluded the option of so radically changing the ending as to let them live &quot;happily ever after&quot;. The maximum realistic change was to create a &quot;moral happy end&quot;, letting Winston and Julia keep their integrity and dignity and die as martyrs.

<doc id="301460" wikidata="Q173273" url="?curid=301460" title="Chinmayananda Saraswati">
<text>Swami Chinmayananda Saraswati (IAST: Svāmī Cinmayānanda Sarasvatī), also known as Pujya Gurudev Swami Chinmayananda Saraswati (born Balakrishna Menon; 8 May 1916 – 3 August 1993), was a Hindu spiritual leader and a teacher. In 1951, he founded Chinmaya Mission, a worldwide nonprofit organisation, in order to spread the knowledge of Advaita Vedanta, the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads, and other ancient Hindu scriptures. Through the Mission, Swami Chinmayananda spearheaded a global Hindu spiritual and cultural renaissance that popularised these spiritual texts and values, teaching them in English all across India and abroad.

Swami Chinmayananda was originally a journalist and participated in the Indian independence movement. Under the tutelage of Swami Sivananda and later Tapovan Maharaj, he began studying Vedanta and took the vow of sannyasa. He gave his first &quot;jñāna yajña&quot;, or lecture series about Hindu spirituality, in 1951, starting the work of the Mission. Today, Chinmaya Mission encompasses more than 300 centres in India and internationally and conducts educational, spiritual, and charitable activities.

Swami Chinmayananda&#x27;s approach was characterized by an appeal to the English-educated Indian middle class and Indian diaspora; he gave lectures and published books in English. Swami Chinmayananda also helped found the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), an Indian right-wing Hindu organization that is considered a member of the Sangh Parivar. In 1964, he convened delegates to create the VHP at Sandeepany ashram and served as the organisation&#x27;s first president. He aimed to &quot;awake(n) the Hindus and to make them conscious of their proud place in the comity of nations,&quot; saying that, &quot;Let us convert Hindus to Hinduism, then everything will be all right.&quot;

Swami Chinmayananda authored 95 publications, including commentaries on the major Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita. He was a visiting professor of Indian philosophy at several American and Asian universities, and he conducted university lecture tours in many countries.

==Biography==
===Indian independence movement and imprisonment===

Approaching August 1942, in the midst of a wide-scale attempt by Indian activists to make the British &quot;Quit India,&quot; Balan was one of the students to join in writing and distributing leaflets to stir up national pride. A warrant was issued for his arrest. When word of this reached him, he went undercover spending the next year moving around in the state of Abbottabad, out of range of British officials, and then moved to Delhi.

In 1944, almost two years after the British had issued his arrest warrant, believing his case was long forgotten, Balan arrived in Punjab and associated himself with several freedom groups. He advised students on distributing leaflets and organising public strikes but was arrested and imprisoned. He spent several months in unhygienic conditions in prison and caught typhus. This caused him to be among those who were carried out into the night and tossed beside a road on the outskirts of the city, where he was found by a passing Indian Christian. Reminded of her son serving in the army, she took him to her home and called for a doctor, who insisted that he be taken to a hospital.

===Career in journalism===

Balan slowly recovered his health. K. Rama Rao gave Balan his first job, as a journalist at &quot;The National Herald&quot;, a young newspaper that had been founded a few years back by Jawaharlal Nehru. He wrote a series of articles on the imperative of socialism in a society where the vast majority of people were poor. He covered subjects ranging from history and culture to social and political issues. Articles such as &quot;In Praise of the Postman,&quot; and &quot;The Mochi—Symbol of Craftsmanship,&quot; gained him a reputation as a controversial character. In 1947, he began a new series of articles for &quot;The Commonweal&quot;.

===Study of Vedanta===
It was while working as a journalist that he travelled to Sivananda&#x27;s ashram in Rishikesh for this purpose of writing an exposé of the sadhus. He later said, &quot;I went not to gain knowledge, but to find out how the swamis were keeping up the bluff among the masses.&quot;
In the summer of 1947, Balan arrived in Rishikesh, by the banks of the Ganges and made the one-mile hike to the Divine Life Society, the ashram of Swami Sivananda. The sages opened his eyes. Balan extended his stay from a week to a month, then more and more. At the age of 31, he went from being a sceptic to an enthusiast, finally becoming a renunciate monk. He began reading more about Hindu scriptures and reviewing spiritual books. Sivananda recognised Balan&#x27;s latent talents and entrusted him to organise a Gita Committee. Having returned to the Divine Life Society ashram, on 25 February 1949, the holy day of &quot;Mahashivratri&quot;, Balan was initiated into &quot;sannyasa&quot; (Hindu vow of renunciation) by Sivananda, who gave him the name &quot;Swami Chinmayananda&quot;, or &quot;bliss of pure Consciousness.&quot;

With Sivananda&#x27;s blessing, Chinmayananda sought out one of the greatest Vedantic masters of his time, Tapovan Maharaj of Uttarkashi, and devoted the next few years of his life to an intensive study of Vedanta under his tutelage.

===Launch of spiritual movement===

In 1951, flying in the face of orthodox Hindu traditions but with the blessings of his guru, Chinmayananda decided to bring the teachings of Vedanta to the masses. In May of that year, he left the Himalayas with a plan to set out on an all-India tour and to visit places of worship to see how Hindu religious heritage was being handed down. He said of that time: “I was miserably disillusioned and disappointed about ... the stuff doled out as the best in Hinduism. ... My experiences during those five months of roaming only strengthened my conviction that I must execute ... Upanishad &quot;Jñāna Yajña&quot; sessions (lecture series) all over India, in all the great cities.&quot;

Chinmayananda held his first lecture series at a Ganesha temple in the city of Pune in December 1951. His audiences soon swelled from a handful into thousands. Army officers from the Southern Command attended and the audience overflowed into the lanes near the temple. Everyone in the audience, man and woman, across all social strata, was asked to participate in the rituals.

===Chinmaya Mission===

At the end of the second &quot;jñāna yajña&quot; in Madras in 1953, a handful of people expressed the desire to create a forum for the study and discussion of Vedanta. Chinmayananda agreed in principle, but he said, &quot;Don&#x27;t start any organization in my name. I have not come here to be institutionalized. I have come here to give the message of our ancient sages, which has benefited me. If it has benefited you, pass it on.&quot;

The Madras group insisted that the best way to &quot;pass it on&quot; was through the support of a forum. They wrote back pointing out that the word &quot;Chinmaya&quot; did not have to indicate Chinmayananda&#x27;s name, since, in Sanskrit, the word itself means &quot;pure Knowledge,&quot; which they were seeking. He conceded. On 8 August 1953, the Chinmaya Mission was formed.

Before long, hundreds of study groups were set up all over the country for people to get together in small batches to study religion and philosophy in a systematic manner. Devi groups were organised for women to take up regular spiritual study and social work.

In 1956, the 23rd &quot;jñāna yajña&quot; in Delhi was inaugurated by the President of India, Rajendra Prasad. He spoke highly of the work Chinmayananda was doing to restore India&#x27;s cultural glory. In a span of five years, Chinmayananda had instructed over 50,000 of his countrymen through 25 &quot;jñāna yajña&quot;s across the country.

On 6 March 1965, Chinmayananda set out on his first global teaching tour, covering 39 cities in 18 countries: Thailand, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, United States, Mexico, Spain, United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, France, Switzerland, Italy, Greece and Lebanon. Over the next 28 years, he continued these international discourses, staying only a week or so in each place, delivering a minimum of two lectures a day, and handling numerous meetings, interviews, discussions, and programs. He wrote scores of letters a day.

It soon became necessary to co-ordinate the growing spiritual movement in the United States. Chinmaya Mission West was formed in 1975 for this purpose.

Chinmayananda&#x27;s message resonated with heads of other faiths. One of his &quot;yajña&quot;s in Bombay was inaugurated by Cardinal Valerian Gracias, a prominent Catholic archbishop of the time. The Dalai Lama, head of the Tibetan Buddhist order, visited with him at the Chinmaya Mission ashram in Sidhbari in 1981. Chinmayananda was a supporter of interfaith dialogue and participated in many interfaith events.

In 1992, he undertook a lecture tour of twelve US universities to establish an international library and research center, the Chinmaya International Foundation, in Kerala, India.

===Vishva Hindu Parishad===

In 1963, Swami Chinmayananda wrote an article airing the idea of calling for a World Hindu Council, inviting delegates from throughout the world to discuss the difficulties and needs concerning the &quot;survival and development of Hindu culture.&quot; This attracted the attention of RSS &quot;pracharak&quot; S. S. Apte, who was airing similar ideas at that time.

In the same year, Chinmaya Mission collected ₹10,000 to fund the construction of the Vivekananda Rock Memorial, which the RSS was building at the time in Kanyakumari. Additionally, in August 1964, the Pope announced that the International Eucharistic Conference would be held in November in Bombay, and stated that a specific number of Hindus would be converted to Christianity; Chinmayananda announced in response that he would convert an even greater number of people to Hinduism.

Apte and Chinmayananda jointly organised such a conference at the Sandeepany ashram in August 1964, which resulted in the founding of the Vishva Hindu Parishad. Swami Chinmayananda was elected as president and Apte as general secretary of the new organisation.

According to Chinmayananda, the VHP was founded in order to

awake(n) the Hindus and to make them conscious of their proud place in the comity of nations. Once we have made every Hindu conscious of his own identity, the Parishad has done its job and we shall feel fully rewarded... ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let us convert Hindus to Hinduism, then everything will be all right.He also believed that the VHP should be focused on educating members of the Hindu diaspora and their children about knowledge of their &quot;cultural duties and spiritual values&quot; and give them the opportunity to &quot;learn, to appreciate and involve themselves in our tradition&quot;. In the 1980s, Chinmayananda also supported the VHP&#x27;s Ekatmata Yatras, stating that those who oppose the yatras &quot;have no respect for national unity and suffer from alienation from the country.&quot;

In 1992, Chinmayananda attended the Vishwa Hindu Parishad&#x27;s 5th European Hindu Conference in Frankfurt, Germany, where the ongoing Ayodhya dispute was a major topic of discussion. During the conference, he stated that the 14 pillars of the Babri Masjid that were identifiable as Hindu temple pillars should be turned over to the Hindus. The mosque was illegally destroyed by VHP activists later that year in an escalation of the Ayodhya dispute.

In January 1993, he gave an interview to Ram Madhav in which he discussed the demolition of the Babri Masjid. Comparing it to the fall of the Berlin Wall, he asserted that &quot;pulling down that structure is nothing wrong&quot; because it was not really used as a mosque. &quot;First let us have this Rama Temple,&quot; he said, after which there were &quot;two more monuments which are built upon our Krishna’s birth place and Kashi Viswanath.&quot; He stated that enthusiasm for the Ram Temple today was not enough, asking Hindus, &quot;Are we ready to live Rama’s life?&quot;

At the time of his death, Chinmayananda was to have been a featured speaker at the World Vision 2000 Global Conference in Washington, D.C., from 6 to 8 August, staged by the VHP to mark the centenary of Swami Vivekananda&#x27;s 1893 address to the Parliament of World Religions. On 8 August, five days after Chinmayananda died, conference delegates observed a moment of silence in tribute to him.

===Illness &amp; Death===
Chinmayananda had many illnesses diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. He had his first heart attack in 1969, when his treatment at the newly opened Chinmaya Mission Hospital in Bangalore made him its first patient. In the summer of 1980, when he was in the United States for a series of &quot;jnana yajna&quot;s, he had to undergo multiple heart bypass surgeries in Texas.

On 26 July 1993, he suffered breathing problems in San Diego, California, while staying at a family devotee&#x27;s house for the day before a yagna camp that was supposed to take place in Los Angeles, the next day. Taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, he was later transferred to Sharp Memorial Hospital, where he had a quintuple bypass surgery on 29 July. But his condition continued to be critical and he was put on a life-support system. He died five days later at 5:45 pm on 3 August 1993, aged 77. His followers mark the date as the occasion of &quot;Mahasamadhi&quot; Day.

On 7 August 1993, thousands of people were at Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi when his body returned to India. It was transported to Sidhbari, Himachal Pradesh, where it was finally laid to rest in accordance with Vedic ritual. A &quot;mahasamadhi&quot; shrine has been built there.

At the time of his death, Chinmayananda was to have spoke at the VHP&#x27;s World Vision 2000 Global Conference in Washington, D.C., and led the Hindu delegation for the 1993 Parliament of World&#x27;s Religions, both events which took place later that August.

===Tribute===
Forty years after his first &quot;jñāna yajña&quot;, on 24 December 1991, in the Leela Kempinski Hotel, in Bombay, Chinmayananda&#x27;s devotees gathered in Mumbai to offer him an amount of gold equal to his body weight, presented to him on a &quot;tula&quot; (ceremonial balance scale) in an age-old ritual called &quot;suvarņa tulābhāram&quot;. The funds generated were used to support the myriad service projects and programs of Chinmaya Mission.

==Legacy==

===Chinmaya Mission===
Chinmayananda established ashrams around the world as places for spiritual retreat, study, and practice.

There are numerous and diverse devotional, spiritual, cultural, and social projects that the Chinmaya Mission continues to administer and conduct in Chinmayananda&#x27;s memory, including the Bala Vihar, the Chinmaya Yuva Kendra (CHYK, the global youth wing of Chinmaya Mission), and Chinmaya Study Groups for adults, which are also known as Devi Groups. The Mission has also constructed over 58 temples in India and abroad and it operates the Chinmaya Organisation for Rural Development (CORD), which was founded by Chinmayananda to facilitate integrated sustainable development for the poor through self-empowerment.

===Chinmaya International Foundation ===
He established the Chinmaya International Foundation at the Tharavad house of Adi Shankara which the foundation bought – in the village Veliyanad in Eranakulam District in Kerala.

===Nursery school===
From its beginnings in 1965 at a nursery school inaugurated by Chinmayananda in Kollengode, Kerala (India), today there are over 76 Chinmaya Vidyalayas (schools), seven Chinmaya colleges, and the Chinmaya International Residential School in India, and the first Chinmaya Vidyalaya outside India&#x27;s borders, in Trinidad, West Indies.

===Medical facilities===
Chinmayananda inaugurated the Chinmaya Mission Hospital in 1970. The facility has grown into a modern, fully equipped 200-bed hospital in Bangalore in Karnataka, India.

In the late 1970s, Chinmayananda established rural health care services in Sidhbari, Himachal Pradesh, India.

===Publications===
Chinmayananda authored 95 publications in his lifetime, including forty commentaries on classical scriptural texts, eight compilations, 13 co-authored works and 34 original works. Over the years, luxury hotels in India started keeping a copy of his commentary on the &quot;Bhagavad-gita&quot; in all their guest rooms. His books, written in English, have been translated into numerous regional Indian languages, including Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam, Marathi, Telugu, Kannada, Odia, Bengali, Sindhi, and Urdu and in one European language, French. His birth centenary has been celebrated with publication of Chinmaya Birth Centenary Series. A series of 12 books were being published. The last in the series is on the teachings of Swami Chinmayananda, through the analogy of tennis, which he always loved. The book is named as &#x27;Final Score - Love All&#x27;.

===BMI chart===
The BMI (Body Mind Intellect) Chart is a teaching tool innovated by Chinmayananda that became one of his hallmarks. It categorises the totality of human experience, according to the science of Vedanta, by drawing on 11 characters of the English and Devanagari alphabets.

===Honours and recognition===
On 2 December 1992, Chinmayananda addressed the United Nations and the talk was titled &quot;Planet in Crisis.&quot;

The US magazine, &quot;Hinduism Today&quot;, conferred him with its Hindu Renaissance Award and the title of &quot;Hindu of the Year&quot; in 1992.

In 1993, he was selected as &quot;President of Hindu Religion&quot; for the Centennial Conference of the Parliament of the World&#x27;s Religions in Chicago, where Swami Vivekananda had given his address one hundred years previously. He was also to be honoured for his selfless service to humanity in Washington, DC at &quot;World Vision 2000,&quot; a conference of religious leaders organised by Vishva Hindu Parishad on 6–8 August 1993. He did not attend either of the latter two functions, as he attained Mahasamadhi, in San Diego, on 3 August 1993.

On 8 May 2015, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi released a commemorative ₹20 coin to mark his birth centenary.

=== Biopic ===
In 2014, &quot;On a Quest&quot;, an English-language biopic featuring the life and works of Chinmayananda, was released. In June 2022, the movie was released to the public on YouTube in English, Hindi and Sanskrit languages. In August 2022, the movie was released in Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam languages.

<text>The Department for Education and Skills (DfES) was a United Kingdom government department between 2001 and 2007, responsible for the education system (including higher education and adult learning) as well as children&#x27;s services in England.

The department was led by Secretary of State for Education and Skills.

The DfES had offices at four main locations: London (both at the Sanctuary Buildings and Caxton House), Sheffield (Moorfoot), Darlington (Mowden Hall), and Runcorn (Castle View House). The DfES was also represented in regional Government Offices.

The DfES had jurisdiction only in England as education was the responsibility of the Scottish Government, Welsh Assembly Government and the Northern Ireland Assembly.

On 28 June 2007, the DfES was split up into the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. The DCSF was later reorganised as the Department for Education in 2010.

==History==
The Department of Education and Science was created in 1964 with the merger of the offices of Minister of Education and the Minister of Science, with Quintin Hogg as minister. Shirley Williams MP was Minister for Education and Science from August 1967 to October 1969.

In 1992 the responsibility for science was transferred to the Cabinet Office&#x27;s Office of Public Service and the Department of Trade and Industry&#x27;s Office of Science and Technology, and the department was renamed Department for Education.

In 1995, in the reshuffle after the Conservative leadership election of that year, the department merged with the Department of Employment to become the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE).

After the 2001 general election, the employment functions were transferred to the new Department for Work and Pensions, with the DfEE becoming the Department for Education and Skills (DfES).

In 2007, the responsibilities for adult education, further education, and higher education were transferred to the new Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. The remainder of the education system moved to the DCSF.

==Secretaries of State for Education and Skills==
==Permanent Secretary==
The permanent secretary of a UK Department is the senior civil servant. While working under the direction of the political ministers (normally members of the relevant government in the UK, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland), the PS (and other senior civil servants, especially the Finance Director) has many traditional and statutory responsibilities that are aimed at ensuring that government departments are, as far as possible, run in the public interest.

Permanent Secretaries:

*David Bell: Jan 2006 – Jun 2007 (subsequently PS of DCSF)
*Sir David Normington: May 2001 – Dec 2005 (DfES)
*Sir Michael Bichard: Jul 1995 – May 2001 (DfES/DfEE)
*Sir Timothy Patrick Lankester: Feb 1994 – Jul 1995 (DfE/DfEE)
*Sir Geoffrey Holland: Jan 1993 – Jan 1994 (DfE)
*Sir John Caines: Jul 1989 – Jan 1993 (DES/DfE)
*Sir David Hancock: May 1983 – June 1989 (DES)
*Sir James Arnot Hamilton: May 1976 – May 1983 (DES)
*Sir William Pile: Aug 1970 – May 1976 (DES)

<text>Tapovan Maharaj (1889–1957) was a Hindu sage and Vedanta scholar.

==Life==
Swami Tapovan Maharaj is one of the most renowned saints of the 20th century. He was a contemporary of Swami Sivananda Maharaj who was the Guru of Swami Chinmayananda Maharaj.

Swami Tapovan Maharaj was born in 1889 on the Suklapaksha Ekadashi day of Mārgasirsa month. His mother, Kunjamma, belonged to an ancient aristocratic Nair Hindu family at Mudappallur in Palghat Taluk of Kerala. His father, Achutan, belonged to Kotuvayur in Kerala.

Based on his date of birth, the infant&#x27;s horoscope, cast in accordance with family tradition, revealed &quot;unusually contrary indications of huge prosperity and abject poverty&quot;.

Born with purvashrama name Subrahmanyan, he authored two books on his travels through the Himalayas: &quot;Wanderings in the Himalayas&quot; (&quot;Himagiri Viharam&quot;) and &quot;Kailasa Yatra.&quot; Tapovan Maharaj exhibited a deep love for nature and his accounts of his travels demonstrate such. His autobiography, written in Sanskrit is titled &quot;Ishvara Darshana&quot;. He died in the early hours of 16 January 1957, which was the day of Pausha Purnima according to Hindu calendar.

<doc id="301466" wikidata="Q1068978" url="?curid=301466" title="Maple leaf">
<text>The maple leaf is the characteristic leaf of the maple tree. It is most widely recognized as the national symbol of Canada.

==History of use in Canada==
By the early 1700s, the maple leaf had been adopted as an emblem by the French Canadians along the Saint Lawrence River.

Its popularity with French Canadians continued and was reinforced when, at the inaugural meeting of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society in 1834, the maple leaf was one of numerous emblems proposed to represent the society. Speaking in its favour, Jacques Viger, the first mayor of Montreal, described the maple as &quot;the king of our forest; ... the symbol of the Canadian people.&quot;

The maple leaf slowly caught on as a national symbol. In 1868, it was included in the coat of arms of Ontario and the coat of arms of Quebec, and was added to the Canadian coat of arms in 1921. Historically, the golden maple leaf had represented Ontario, while the green maple leaf had represented Quebec. In 1867, Alexander Muir composed the patriotic song &quot;The Maple Leaf Forever&quot;, which became an unofficial anthem in English-speaking Canada. From 1876 until 1901, the leaf appeared on all Canadian coins, and remained on the penny after 1901. The use of the maple leaf as a regimental symbol extended from the 1890s, and Canadian soldiers in the Second Boer War were distinguished by a maple leaf on their sun helmets. During the First World War, badges of the Canadian Expeditionary Force were often based on a maple leaf design. In 1957, the maple leaf colour on the Canadian arms was changed from green to red – some maple leaves are commonly red even in spring as they bud and no seasonal colouring has been assigned heraldically.

The maple leaf became the central national symbol with the introduction of the Canadian flag (suggested by George F. G. Stanley and sponsored by John Matheson) in 1965, which uses a highly stylized eleven-pointed maple leaf, referring to no specific species of maple. Earlier official uses of a maple leaf design often used more than 30 points and a short stem. The one chosen is a generic maple leaf representing the ten species of maple tree native to Canada – at least one of these species grows natively in every province. The maple leaf is used on the Canadian flag and by the Federal Government as a personification and identifier on its websites, as part of the government&#x27;s wordmark.

The maple leaf is also used in logos of various Canadian-based companies (including Canadian subsidiaries of foreign companies and small local businesses) and the logos of Canadian sports teams. Examples include Air Canada, General Motors Canada, the Toronto Maple Leafs and Winnipeg Jets National Hockey League (NHL) franchises, the Toronto Blue Jays Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise, and the Toronto FC Major League Soccer (MLS) club. Several national chains (e.g. McDonald&#x27;s Canada, Wendy&#x27;s Canada) use the maple leaf in place of a possessive apostrophe in their company logo, in order to have consistent branding across the country while complying with Quebec&#x27;s &quot;Official Language Act&quot; (as the French language does not use this punctuation).

The maple leaf is considered a certification mark on product labels in Canada, equivalent to &quot;Product of Canada&quot; which requires 98% of the total direct costs of the product to be incurred in Canada.

Since 1979, the Royal Canadian Mint has produced gold, silver, platinum, and palladium bullion coins, which are officially known as Maple Leafs, as geometric maple leaves are stamped on them. The Trans Canada Highway uses a green maple leaf.

==Other uses==
The Italian city of Campobasso was known as &quot;Canada City&quot; or in a minor way &quot;Maple Leaf City&quot;, since during the Second World War, Canadian troops invaded the city and freed it from the Germans. Moreover, the city has a huge variety of maples which can be found even in the streets.

The U.S. city of Carthage, Missouri, is nicknamed &quot;America&#x27;s Maple Leaf City.&quot;

The city of Chehalis, Washington, was known as &quot;The Maple-Leaf City&quot;.

The mascot of Goshen College in Goshen, Indiana, is the Maple Leaf and the nickname for Goshen College sports teams is the Maple Leafs.

It is usually taken as one of the featured symbols on the emblem of the Pakistani province of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, which is not correct. The actual featured symbol is a Chinar leaf, with &quot;Chinar&quot; being the Persian/Turkish/Urdu name for the Oriental Plane (&quot;Platanus orientalis&quot;), a large broad leaved deciduous tree.

In Estonia and Lithuania, inexperienced drivers are obliged to have a green maple leaf sign visible on the vehicle, serving a similar function that a P-plate does in some other countries.

The maple leaf was also featured on the coat of arms of Sammatti, Finland.

<text>A lozenge ( ; symbol: ), often referred to as a diamond, is a form of rhombus. The definition of &quot;lozenge&quot; is not strictly fixed, and the word is sometimes used simply as a synonym () for &quot;rhombus&quot;. Most often, though, lozenge refers to a thin rhombus—a rhombus with two acute and two obtuse angles, especially one with acute angles of 45°. The lozenge shape is often used in parquetry (with acute angles that are 360°/&quot;n&quot; with &quot;n&quot; being an integer higher than 4, because they can be used to form a set of tiles of the same shape and size, reusable to cover the plane in various geometric patterns as the result of a tiling process called tessellation in mathematics) and as decoration on ceramics, silverware and textiles. It also features in heraldry and playing cards.

==Symbolism==
The lozenge motif dates from the Neolithic and Paleolithic period in Eastern Europe and represents a sown field and female fertility. The ancient lozenge pattern often shows up in Diamond vault architecture, in traditional dress patterns of Slavic peoples, and in traditional Ukrainian embroidery. The lozenge pattern also appears extensively in Celtic art, art from the Ottoman Empire, and ancient Phrygian art.

The lozenge symbolism is one of the main symbols for women in Berber carpets.
Common Berber jewelry from the Aurès Mountains or Kabylie in Algeria also uses this pattern as a female fertility sign.

In 1658, the English philosopher Sir Thomas Browne published &quot;The Garden of Cyrus,&quot; subtitled &quot;The Quincunciall Lozenge, or Network Plantations of the Ancients,&quot; in which he outlined the mystical interconnection of art, nature and the universe via the quincunx pattern. He also suggested therein that ancient plantations were laid out in a lozenge pattern.

Lozenges appear as symbols in ancient classic element systems, in amulets, and in religious symbolism. In playing cards, the symbol for the suit of &quot;diamonds&quot; is a lozenge.

==Applications==
===Calculator===

On equipment, especially calculators, the lozenge is used to mark the subtotal key. It is standardized in ISO 7000 as symbol ISO-7000-0650 (&quot;Subtotal&quot;). In a similar fashion, the square lozenge (⌑), part of the BCDIC character set, was often used on tabulation listings to indicate second level totals in banking installations in the 1960s.

===Computing===
The APL programming language uses the lozenge, called &quot;diamond&quot;, as statement separator.

===Camouflage===
During the First World War, the Germans developed lozenge camouflage (German: ). This camouflage was made up of colored polygons of four or five colors. The repeating patterns often used irregular four-, five- and six-sided polygons, but some contained regular rhombi or hexagons. Because painting such a pattern was very time-consuming, and the paint added considerably to the weight of the aircraft, the pattern was printed on fabric. This pre-printed fabric was used from 1916 until the end of the war, in various forms and colours.

===Flags and emblems===

Several flags feature lozenges, including the flag of Brazil, which contains a yellow lozenge at the center. One official flag of Bavaria is entirely made of blue and white lozenges.

Several emblems feature lozenges, including the Emblem of Uttarakhand, one of the twenty-eight states of India.

===Heraldry===

The lozenge in heraldry is a diamond-shaped charge, usually somewhat narrower than it is tall. A mascle is a voided lozenge—that is, a lozenge with a lozenge-shaped hole in the middle—and the rarer rustre is a lozenge containing a circular hole. A field covered in a pattern of lozenges is described as lozengy; a similar field of mascles is masculy.

===Mathematics===
In axiomatic set theory, the lozenge refers to the principles known collectively as the diamond principle.

===Medicine===

Cough tablets have taken the name lozenge, based on their original shape. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; the first use of this sense was in 1530.

In Finland, the lozenge is associated with salmiak, through Apteekin Salmiakki. Thus, the lozenge is commonly called &quot;salmiakkikuvio&quot; &quot;salmiak shape&quot;. The pattern is often used even if the candy is not actually lozenge-shaped.

===Military insignia===
====Finland====
In the Finnish military, the lozenge symbol is used in the insignia of conscripts undergoing officer training to signify their rank and progress. Conscript Officer Students, who are still in the early stages of their training, wear an insignia with one lozenge. As they advance in their training, they become Conscript Officer Candidates, identified by an insignia with two lozenges. This progression marks their nearing completion of officer training, with the lozenge serving as a clear visual indicator of their status.

====United States====

To implement 10 U.S.C 773, the Secretary of the Navy has prescribed the following distinctive mark for wear by members of military societies which are composed entirely of honorably discharged officers and enlisted personnel, or by the instructors and members of duly organized cadet corps.

&quot;The distinctive mark will be a diamond, inches long by 2 inches wide, of any cloth material. A white distinctive mark will be worn on blue, green, or khaki clothing; and a blue distinctive mark will be worn on white clothing.&quot;

&quot;The distinctive mark will be worn on all outer clothing on the right sleeve, at the point of the shoulder, the upper tip of the diamond to be inch below the shoulder seam.&quot;

The lozenge is used in the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force on the insignia of their respective first sergeants. It is also used in the cadet programs of Army ROTC, Army and Marine Corps Junior ROTC, and the Civil Air Patrol as rank insignia of cadet officers corresponding to the military pay grades of O-4 to O-6 (Cadet Major, Cadet Lieutenant Colonel, and Cadet Colonel).

===Visual arts===
&quot;Lozenge&quot; is the term used to identify the format of a two-dimensional work of art, typically a parallelogrammatic painting on a canvas, panel, or paper support, that hangs as if from one of its corners. An example is &quot;Girl Singing&quot; by Frans Hals.

===Modal logic===
In modal logic, the lozenge expresses that there is &quot;possibility&quot;. For example, the expression formula_1 expresses that it is possible that formula_2 is true.

===Traffic signs===

The lozenge (technically a mascle) can be used on public roadways in the United States and Canada to mark a specific lane for a particular use. The lane will usually be painted with a lozenge at a regular interval, and signage will be installed to indicate the restrictions on using the lane. This marking is most often used to denote high-occupancy vehicle lanes or bus lanes, with accompanying signage reading &quot;◊ HOV LANE&quot; or &quot;◊ BUS LANE&quot; and giving the requirements for a vehicle to be accepted. Prior to 17 January 2006, lozenges could also be used to mark bicycle-only lanes, often in conjunction with a bicycle icon.

Starting in August 2023 on a four-years trial in France, a white lozenge on blue background reserves lanes to car-sharing vehicles (at least one passenger besides the driver).

In Japan and South Korea, a lozenge marked in white paint on the road indicates an upcoming uncontrolled pedestrian crossing. Similarly, in New Zealand a lozenge marked in white paint on the road may be placed to indicate an upcoming pedestrian crossing. 

In the United Kingdom, lozenges are used on tramway signs. For instance, speed limits are shown as a black lozenge on a white background, containing the speed limit in kilometres per hour.
In many parts of Europe, traffic from the right has right of way at all junctions, unless otherwise stipulated. A yellow lozenge is used (typically on major routes) to indicate that the rule does not apply to the current route.

A hollow lozenge is also used in the signage of waterways to identify a hazard. A cross is placed in the lozenge, dividing it in four, to mark a restricted area.

==Square lozenge (Pillow symbol)==
A similar shape, , with concavely curved edges instead of straight lines and oriented such that its edges lie up, down, left and right, is defined in the Miscellaneous Technical Unicode block as a square lozenge. It is used in travel agencies, where it appears on the specialist keyboards used with booking terminals, where it has the familiar name, the pillow symbol. In the 1960s, it was used in banking and for other purposes.

==Encodings==
In Unicode, the lozenge is encoded in multiple variants:
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 

The lozenge is present in DOS code page 437 (at character code 4) and Mac-Roman (at character 215 = 0xd7). The AMS-LaTeX command for the lozenge is codice_1 (formula_3).

Other related unicode characters include:
* 

In IBM 026 punched card code the pillow-shaped square &quot;lozenge&quot; is (12-8-4).

<text>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is a ministerial department of the government of the United Kingdom. It is responsible for environmental protection, food production and standards, agriculture, fisheries and rural communities in the entire United Kingdom. Concordats set out agreed frameworks for cooperation, between it and the Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Executive, which have devolved responsibilities for these matters in their respective nations.

Defra also leads for the United Kingdom on agricultural, fisheries and environmental matters in international negotiations on sustainable development and climate change, although a new Department of Energy and Climate Change was created on 3 October 2008 to take over the last responsibility; later transferred to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy following Theresa May&#x27;s appointment as Prime Minister in July 2016.

==Creation==
The department was formed in June 2001, under the leadership of Margaret Beckett, when the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) was merged with part of the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) and with a small part of the Home Office.

It was created after the perceived failure of MAFF to deal adequately with an outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease. The department had about 9,000 core personnel, .

In October 2008, the climate team at Defra was merged with the energy team from the Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR), to create the Department of Energy and Climate Change, then headed by Ed Miliband.

==Ministers==
Defra ministers are as follows, with cabinet members in bold:

On 8 and 9 July 2024, the appointments of Daniel Zeichner as Minister of State and Emma Hardy MP and and Baroness Hayman of Ullock as Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State was announced, but initially without details of specific portfolios within Defra.

The Permanent Secretary is Tamara Finkelstein, who replaced Clare Moriarty in 2019.

==Responsibilities==
Defra is responsible for British Government policy in the following areas:

* Adaptation to global warming
* Agriculture
* Air quality
* Animal health and animal welfare
* Biodiversity
* Conservation
* Chemical substances and pesticides
* Fisheries
* Flooding
* Food
* Forestry
* Hunting
* Inland waterways
* Land management
* Marine policy
* National parks
* Noise
* Plant health
* Rural development
* Sustainable development
* Trade and the environment
* Waste management
* Water management

Some policies apply to England alone due to devolution, while others are not devolved and therefore apply to the United Kingdom as a whole.

==Executive agencies==
The department&#x27;s executive agencies are:
* Animal and Plant Health Agency (formerly the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency, formed by a merger of Animal Health and the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, and later parts of the Food and Environment Research Agency. Animal Health had launched on 2 April 2007 and was formerly the State Veterinary Service)
* Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science
* Rural Payments Agency
* Veterinary Medicines Directorate

==Key delivery partners==
The department&#x27;s key delivery partners are:
* Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board
* Consumer Council for Water
* Environment Agency
* Fera Science (formerly the Food and Environment Research Agency, now a company in which Defra holds a 25% stake)
* Forestry Commission (a non-ministerial government department including Forest Enterprise and Forest Research)
* Joint Nature Conservation Committee
* Marine Management Organisation (launched on 1 April 2010, incorporates the former Marine and Fisheries Agency)
* National Forest Company
* Natural England (launched on 11 October 2006, formerly English Nature and elements of the Countryside Agency and the Rural Development Service)
* Ofwat (a non-ministerial government department formally known as the Water Services Regulation Authority)
* Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew
* Sea Fish Industry Authority
A full list of departmental delivery and public bodies may be found on the Defra website.

==Defra in England==

Policies for environment, food and rural affairs are delivered in the regions by Defra&#x27;s executive agencies and delivery bodies, in particular Natural England, the Rural Payments Agency, Animal Health and the Marine Management Organisation.

Defra provides grant aid to the following flood and coastal erosion risk management operating authorities:
* Environment Agency
* Internal drainage boards
* Local authorities

==Aim and strategic priorities==
Defra&#x27;s overarching aim is sustainable development, which is defined as &quot;development which enables all people throughout the world to satisfy their basic needs and enjoy a better quality of life without compromising the quality of life of future generations&quot;. The Secretary of State wrote in a letter to the Prime Minister that he saw Defra&#x27;s mission as enabling a move toward what the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has called &quot;one planet living&quot;.

Under this overarching aim, Defra has five strategic priorities:
* Climate change and energy.
* Sustainable consumption and production, including responsibility for the National Waste Strategy.
* Protecting the countryside and natural resource protection.
* Sustainable rural communities.
* A sustainable farming and food sector including animal health and welfare.

Defra aims to procure a significant proportion of the goods and services it requires from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in line with government policy on the SME agenda, and has also encouraged its major contractors to engage with SMEs.

Defra&#x27;s headquarters are at 2, Marsham Street, London. It is also located at Nobel House, 17, Smith Square, London.

<text>USS &quot;Hammann&quot; (DD-412) was a World War II-era in the service of the United States Navy, named after Ensign Charles Hammann, a Medal of Honor recipient from World War I. &quot;Hammann&quot; was torpedoed and sunk during the Battle of Midway, while assisting the sinking aircraft carrier .

&quot;Hammann&quot; was launched by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Kearny, New Jersey on 4 February 1939; sponsored by Miss Lillian Hammann; and commissioned on 11 August 1939, Commander Arnold E. True in command. &quot;Hammann&quot; conducted shakedown off the East Coast and for the next two years participated in training and readiness operations off both coasts.

==Service history==

===Pre-War===

On 10 June 1939, while pulling away from the dock yard in Kearny, New Jersey, &quot;Hammann&quot; briefly crossed paths with which was sailing from Sandy Hook, New Jersey, to New York, New York, with King George VI and Queen Elizabeth aboard during their royal tour of the United States. On 14 June &quot;The Evening Star&quot; reported that during &quot;Hammann&quot;″s sea trials off the coast of Fire Island in the Atlantic Ocean, Senator Ernest Lundeen joined a civilian and press delegation aboard the ship which reached a maximum speed of 40 knots, put screws in full reverse, causing the ship to come to a complete stop in 58 seconds, and then the ship travelled in reverse at a top speed nearing 20 knots.

===World War II===

====Transfer from North Atlantic Patrol to Pacific Duty====

On 7 December 1941, 30 minutes after receiving news of the Attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Hammann&quot; and the other ships in the North Atlantic Patrol left Reykjavík and steamed for the United States. On 17 December, she arrived in Norfolk, Virginia, for fuel, supplies, and new crew. Shortly thereafter, she steamed around Cape Hatteras for Charleston, South Carolina. From there, in early January, she rendezvoused with the battleship and the troop transport to escort the pair through the Panama Canal for San Diego and later San Francisco. On 22 January 1942, she arrived in Pearl Harbor and joined Vice Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher&#x27;s Task Force 17 for action in the South Pacific.

====Pacific Duty====

The destroyer took part in training maneuvers in the New Caledonia area during early March, and on 27 March the Task Force departed for the Coral Sea. &quot;Hammann&quot; acted as screening ship and plane guard for the aircraft carrier , Returning to Tongatapu on 20 April, the Task Force sortied again into the Coral Sea on 27 April for a surprise air raid on Japanese invasion forces on Tulagi.

While screening the carriers during the air raids of 4 May, &quot;Hammann&quot; was directed to rescue two fighter pilots downed on Guadalcanal, some to the north. Steaming at full speed, the destroyer arrived at dusk and sighted a marker on the beach, which proved to be a parachute. The motor whaleboat was put over the side, but dangerous surf prevented it from landing. Consequently, the pilots were recovered with the use of lines from the boat. This accomplished, an attempt was made to destroy the wreckage of the aircraft, but the rough water made this impossible, and &quot;Hammann&quot; returned to &quot;Lexington&quot;″s screen from this successful operation that night.

====The Battle of the Coral Sea====
On 8 May came the main action of the Battle of the Coral Sea, the first naval engagement fought entirely on both sides between aircraft and ships. During the exchange of air attacks, &quot;Hammann&quot; screened the carriers, firing at Japanese torpedo planes as they attacked. Just as the torpedo planes retired, dive bombers appeared, one exploding a bomb off &quot;Hammann&quot;″s starboard bow. &quot;Lexington&quot;, which had taken two devastating torpedo hits to port, was first thought to be under control, but a large internal explosion shortly before 13:00, followed later by others, sealed her fate. As the order was given to abandon ship, &quot;Hammann&quot;, , and stood by to receive survivors. The destroyer picked up nearly 500 men from the water before &quot;Lexington&quot; went down the night of 8 May, scuttled by a torpedoed from the destroyer .

====The Battle of Midway====

The Battle of the Coral Sea, which checked the Japanese advance to the southeast, was over, but new demands called &quot;Hammann&quot; to the north. Under urgent orders from Admiral Chester Nimitz to meet a new threat, &quot;Hammann&quot; moved to Pearl Harbor with the Task Force, arriving on 27 May. After making repairs, it got underway on 30 May and was just in time to take part in the Battle of Midway.

During the air battle on 4 June, &quot;Hammann&quot; screened the carrier , helping to shoot down many of the attacking aircraft. However, the carrier took two torpedo hits and, listing heavily, was abandoned that afternoon. &quot;Hammann&quot; picked up survivors in the water, including &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s commanding officer, Captain Elliott Buckmaster, and transferred them to the larger ships. Efforts were mounted to save the stricken carrier on the next morning. A skeleton crew returned on board the &quot;Yorktown&quot;, and attempts were made to tow her to safety. &quot;Hammann&quot; came alongside on 6 June to transfer a damage control party. The destroyer then lay alongside, providing hoses and water for firefighting, power, and other services while tied up next to the carrier.

The salvage party was making progress when the protective destroyer screen was penetrated by after noon on 6 June. Four torpedoes were fired; one missed, two passed under &quot;Hammann&quot; and hit &quot;Yorktown&quot;, and the fourth hit the destroyer amidships, breaking her in half.

As the debris from the explosion rained down and the ships lurched apart, it was apparent that the destroyer was doomed. Life rafts were lowered and rescue efforts by surrounding ships commenced. &quot;Hammann&quot; sank, bow first, in just four minutes. During that time, Chief Machinist Mate Daniel William Carlson was able to launch a life raft, pass out life vests, and help others over the side of the ship to safety. Following the sinking there was a violent underwater explosion, the likely cause of which was the destroyer&#x27;s depth charges and torpedoes. The explosion caused many deaths in the water, bringing the death toll to 80. Survivors were taken aboard the destroyers and .

==Awards==
&quot;Hammann&quot;″s skipper, Commander Arnold True, was awarded the Navy Cross and a Navy Distinguished Service Medal for his performance while in command of &quot;Hammann&quot; at Coral Sea and Midway. Ensign Theodore E. Krepski was awarded the Navy Cross for his actions rescuing sailors abandoning &quot;Lexington&quot; at Coral Sea. &quot;Hammann&quot; also received two battle stars for her service in World War II.

<text>The Office for Standards in Education, Children&#x27;s Services and Skills (Ofsted) is a non-ministerial department of His Majesty&#x27;s government, reporting to Parliament. Ofsted&#x27;s role is to make sure that organisations providing education, training and childcare services in England do so to a high standard for children and students. Ofsted is responsible for inspecting a range of educational institutions, including state schools and some independent schools. It also inspects childcare, adoption and fostering agencies and initial teacher training, and regulates early years childcare facilities and children&#x27;s social care services.

The chief inspector (&quot;HMCI&quot;) is appointed by an Order in Council and thus becomes an office holder under the Crown. Sir Martyn Oliver has been HMCI ; the chair of Ofsted has been Christine Ryan: her predecessors include Julius Weinberg and David Hoare.

Ofsted publish reports on the quality of education and management at a particular school and organisation on a regular basis. His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectors (HMI) rank schools based on information gathered in inspections which they undertake. An Ofsted section 5 inspection is called a &#x27;full report&#x27; and administered under section 5 of the 2005 Education Act, while a monitoring visit is conducted under the authority given by section 8 of the 2005 Education Act and can also be called an Ofsted section 8 inspection.

==History==
In 1833, Parliament agreed an annual grant to the National Society for Promoting Religious Education and the British and Foreign School Society, which respectively provided Church of England and non-denominational elementary schools for poor children. In 1837, two inspectors of schools, Seymour Tremenheere and the Reverend John Allen, were appointed to monitor the effectiveness of the grant. James Kay-Shuttleworth, then Secretary of the Privy Council&#x27;s Education Committee, ensured that the inspectors were appointed by Order in Council to guard their independence.

The grant and inspection system was extended in 1847 to Roman Catholic elementary schools established by the Catholic Poor School Committee. Inspectors were organised on denominational lines, with the churches having a say in the choice of inspectors, until 1876, when the inspectorate was reorganised by area.

After the Education Act 1902, inspections were expanded to state-funded secondary schools along similar lines. Over time more inspections were carried out by inspectors based in local education authorities, with His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate (HMI) focusing on reporting to the Secretary of State on education across the country.

The government of John Major, concerned about variable local inspection regimes, decided to introduce a national scheme of inspections through a reconstituted HMI, which became known as the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted). Under the Education (Schools) Act 1992, HMI would supervise the inspection of each state-funded school in the country, and would publish its reports for the benefit of schools, parents, and government instead of reporting to the Secretary of State.

In September 2001, HM Chief Inspector of Schools in England became responsible for registration and inspection of day care and childminding in England, and the position was renamed HM Chief Inspector of Education, Children&#x27;s Services and Skills. Previously this was done by 150 local authorities, based on their implementation by 1992 of the Day care Standards provisions of the 1989 Children Act.

Schedule 11 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 changed the way in which Ofsted works without significantly changing the provision. Since 2006 the structure of Ofsted has derived elements from business models, with a chair, an executive board, regional officers, and a formal annual report to Parliament in the light of concerns about schools, and local authority children&#x27;s services. In April 2007, the former Office for Standards in Education merged with the Adult Learning Inspectorate (ALI) to provide an inspection service that includes all post-16 government funded education (but not Higher Education Institutes and Universities which are inspected by the Quality Assurance Agency). At the same time it took on responsibility for the registration and inspection of social care services for children, and the welfare inspection of independent and maintained boarding schools from the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI).

==Current state==
The services Ofsted inspects or regulates include local services, childminding, child day care, children&#x27;s centres, children&#x27;s social care, CAFCASS, state schools, private schools and teacher training providers, colleges, and learning and skills providers in England. It also monitors the work of the Independent Schools Inspectorate. HMI are empowered and required to provide independent advice to the United Kingdom government and parliament on matters of policy and to publish an annual report to parliament on the quality of educational provision in England. Ofsted distributes its functions amongst its offices in London, Manchester, Nottingham, Birmingham, Cambridge, York, Darlington and Bristol.

Ofsted covers only England; the Education and Training Inspectorate in Northern Ireland, Education Scotland (previously HM Inspectorate of Education) in Scotland, and Estyn in Wales perform similar functions within their education systems.

A new Education Inspection Framework (EIF) introduced from September 2019 sets out how Ofsted undertakes inspections under section 5 of the Education Act 2005 (as amended), section 109 of the Education and Skills Act 2008, the Education and Inspections Act 2006 and the Childcare Act 2006.

==Inspectors==

The current Chief Inspector is Sir Martyn Oliver, who was appointed in January 2024 replacing Amanda Spielman. Ofsted directly employs His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectors (HMI), who are appointed by the King in Council. , there were 443 HMIs, of whom 82 were engaged in management, 245 in the inspection of schools, and the rest in the inspection of other areas for which Ofsted in responsible. All HMIs inspecting schools have teaching experience.

When Ofsted was created the original plan was that inspectors would not be drawn from education. the plan was to give parents an independent review of a school untainted by the education establishment. This plan was quickly replaced by a system that existed until 2005. This system was based on schools being inspected by teams containing three types of inspector. Each team was led by a &#x27;registered&#x27; inspector. They were accompanied by a number of &#x27;team&#x27; inspectors, the number of which depended on the size of the school. Each team also contained &#x27;lay&#x27; inspector recruited from outside the world of education. In September 2005 the distinction between registered, team and lay inspectors was removed and all contracted inspectors (as opposed to directly employed HMI) became &#x27;Ofsted inspectors&#x27;.

Most school inspections were carried out by additional Inspectors (AI) employed by external companies known as Regional Inspection Service Providers (RISPs). , there were 1,948 AIs, of whom 1,567 inspect schools. Although Ofsted claims that most of these have teaching experience, in 2012 it was forced to admit that it had done no quality control checks on these inspectors, and that a few of them – including lead inspectors – were not qualified teachers as prior to 2005 they had been &#x27;lay&#x27; inspectors. In 2015, the chief inspector (Sir Michael Wilshall) decided that he wanted more direct control over Ofsted inspectors brought responsibility for their training, deployment and quality &#x27;in-house&#x27; and abolished the contracts with the RISPs who are no more. 40% of additional inspectors who wanted to continue working for Ofsted were not re-hired after the contractual change. Although Ofsted insisted that this was part of a quality control process and &quot;should not be seen as an admission that its inspections were substandard&quot;, serving headteacher and &quot;Times Educational Supplement&quot; columnist Geoff Barton commented &quot;dispensing with almost 40 per cent of inspectors on the grounds of quality is hardly an endorsement of standards.&quot;

An HMI accompanies an Ofsted inspector on a sample of inspections, including 75% of those of secondary schools. Reports produced by RISPs must be checked and signed off by HMI, sometimes with amendments, before publication. New Additional Inspectors must be monitored and signed off by HMI before working independently.

The number of RISPs contracted to conduct school inspections was reduced in 2009 from five to three:
* CfBT Education Trust, covering the North of England
* Serco Education and Children&#x27;s Services, covering the English Midlands
* Tribal Group, covering the South of England
, seventy per-cent of the inspectors are now headteachers or school leaders.

==School inspections==
Ofsted publish reports on the quality of education and management at a particular school and organisation on a regular basis. His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectors (HMI) rank schools based on information gathered in inspections which they undertake. Inspectors carry out regular inspections of all maintained schools and academies, some independent schools, colleges, apprenticeship providers, prison education and many other educational institutions and programmes outside of higher education. Ofsted aims to improve lives by raising standards in education and children&#x27;s social care. Ofsted monitors standards in schools, and tells schools what they are doing right and what they must do to improve.

Inspectors publish reports of findings so they can be used to improve the overall quality of education and training. Inspection reports provides important information to parents, carers, learners and employers about the quality of education, training and care. These groups should be able to make informed choices based on the information published in inspection reports. Ofsted monitors standards in schools, and tells schools what they are doing right and what they must do to improve. Before 2005 each school was inspected for a week every six years, with two months&#x27; notice to prepare for an inspection.

===2005–2012===
In September 2005 a new system of short-notice inspections came into being. Under this system the senior leadership of each school were strongly encouraged to complete a Self Evaluation Form (SEF) on a continual basis, which required them to be aware of strengths and areas for development. Inspections were generally two- or three-day visits every three years, with two days&#x27; notice. They focussed on the &quot;central nervous system&quot; of the school – examining how well the school was managed, and what processes were in place to ensure standards improve; the school leadership and management were expected to be aware of everything in the SEF. The SEF served as the main document when planning the inspection, and was crucial in evaluating the school&#x27;s capacity to improve.

After an inspection of a school, Ofsted published a report on the school on its website. In addition to written comments on a number of areas, schools were assessed on each area and overall on a 4-point scale: 1 (Outstanding), 2 (Good), 3 (Satisfactory) and 4 (Inadequate). Schools rated Outstanding or Good might not be inspected again for five years, while schools judged less favourably were inspected more frequently, and might receive little or no notice of inspection visits. Figures published in March 2010 showed that revised inspection criteria, which were introduced in September 2009, resulted in a reduction from 19% to 9% in the number of schools judged to be Outstanding, and an increase from 4% to 10% in the number of schools judged to be Inadequate.

===2012–2015===

==== Section 5 ====
A framework for section 5 inspections of academies and maintained schools was introduced from January 2012, and replaced with another new framework in September 2012. Public consultation was undertaken, and Ofsted prepared for the new framework after piloting a series of inspections across the country. Among other changes, the new system relabelled the &quot;Satisfactory&quot; category as &quot;Requires Improvement&quot;, with an expectation that schools should not remain at that level.

===2015–2020===
In 2015 they published a Common Inspection Framework, and four handbooks which gave much of the details of inspections. These are no longer/not statutory documents so can be changed regularly. The four handbooks are:
*Maintained schools and academies
*Early years
*Non-association independent schools
*Further education and skills

A new Education Inspection Framework (EIF) introduced from September 2019 sets out how Ofsted undertakes inspections under section 5 of the Education Act 2005 (as amended), section 109 of the Education and Skills Act 2008, the Education and Inspections Act 2006 and the Childcare Act 2006.

A Section 5 is also known as a full inspection; a section 8 is also called a monitoring visit. When the inspectors find serious causes for concern, they may extend the section 8 so it becomes a section 5 with the additional legal powers. Similarly, when using a Section 8 to confirm a Good School&#x27;s continual status, they may extend the inspection by one day so converting it into a Section 5 in order to grade the school outstanding.

==== Section 8 ====
Section 8 of the Education Act 2005 (as amended) gives the Secretary of State the legal authority to request His Majesty&#x27;s Chief Inspector (HMCI) to enter a school for the purpose of obtaining information. Section 8 Inspections cannot change a schools allocated designation but can trigger a Section 5 Inspection where that might happen.

They are used in three ways:
* to monitor the progress a school rated as level 4 (Inadequate) has made in following the advice they had been given
* to inspect school rated as level 1 (Outstanding) and thus exempt from Section 5 Inspection, when information has been received that caused concern
* to enter a school or groups of schools to gather information for the Secretary of State on current issues that maybe needed for a report.

===Format of a 2018 report===
*Address and inspection dates 
*Overall effectiveness: a grade
*Effectiveness of leadership and management: a grade
*Quality of teaching, learning and assessment: a grade
*Personal development, behaviour and welfare: a grade
*Outcomes for pupils: a grade
*Early years provision: if present a grade
*16 to 19 study programmes: if present a grade
*Overall effectiveness at previous inspection: a single grade
This is followed by :
*&#x27;Summary of key findings for parents and pupils&#x27;
*&#x27;What does the school need to do to improve further?&#x27; 

Inspection judgements form the body of the report. For each heading, eight or more critical paragraphs, at the inspectors discretion, are written that support the grade given.

* A single page giving a formal table of data held on the school on Government Databases.
* A free text description of the school.
* Details of the inspection team, and the scope of the inspection.

====Emphasis in 2020====
The two principal strands that are being examined are the effectiveness of safeguarding of the students and the impact of governance and management. Inspectors make graded judgements on the following areas:

* Quality of education
* Behaviour and attitudes
* Personal development
* Leadership and management

===Special measures===
A school is placed into special measures if it is judged as &#x27;inadequate&#x27; (Grade 4) in one or more areas and if the inspectors have decided it does not have the capacity to improve without additional help. Schools placed into special measures receive intensive support from local authorities, additional funding and resourcing, and frequent reappraisal from Ofsted until the school is no longer deemed to be failing. Furthermore, the senior managers and teaching staff can be dismissed and the governing body may be replaced by an appointed Interim Executive Board (IEB). Schools which are failing but where inspectors consider there is capacity to improve are given a Notice to Improve (NtI).

==Home educator inspections==

Ofsted, as of April 2015, was issuing new guidance to inspectors which will include the following: 
*Home-educated children are not, by definition, all in need of protection and help.
*The statutory duty on local authorities (LAs) to identify as far as possible those children not receiving a suitable education does not extend to home-educated children.
*The details, and limits, of the guidance in relation to home education

==Other inspections==
In social care settings that include provision for children and young people, Ofsted has adopted a social care common inspection framework (SCCIF), which applies across all regulated settings.

Ofsted is one of the partner inspectorates contributing to joint targeted area inspections (JTAIs), along with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services. There are two types of JTAI:
*those which undertake an evaluation of an area&#x27;s multi-agency response to identification of initial need and risk (or the ‘front door’ of child protection), and
*those which focus on a particular theme or cohort of children within an area, such as (initially) an area&#x27;s multi-agency response to the criminal exploitation of children.

==Criticisms==
Ofsted was criticised as &#x27;not fit for purpose&#x27; in 2007 by the House of Commons Education Select Committee.
The committee also highlighted their concern about &quot;the complex set of objectives and sectors that Ofsted now spans and its capacity to fulfil its core mission&quot;. Other criticism came from the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) which said &quot;Ofsted is over-reliant on number crunching, using test data which are fundamentally unsound&quot; and added that the organisation was &quot;ripe for overhaul&quot;.

Over a period of several years the Select Committee had questioned the Chief Inspector over its treatment of Summerhill School and what it had learnt from the 1999 Court Case and subsequent inspections. In the Court Agreement between DfE and Summerhill School, Independent Schools Tribunal IST/59, inspections would include two advisors from the school and one from the DfE to ensure the fairness of the process. The school had campaigned for all schools to be similarly inspected, ensuring openness and accountability for the process.

In August 2013, 18 of the 24 newly launched Free Schools were graded Good or Outstanding by Ofsted; however, with over 100 state schools being downgraded from an Outstanding classification that year, the consistency of Ofsted grading was once again brought into question, leading to numerous &#x27;How to get a Good Ofsted&#x27; guides being created.

A 2014 report by the think tank Policy Exchange indicated that many Ofsted inspectors lack the knowledge required to make fair judgements of lessons and that judgements are so unreliable, &quot;you would be better off flipping a coin&quot;.

A 2014 poll of teachers, carried out by Teacher Support Network, revealed that over 90% of teachers felt Ofsted inspections had a neutral or negative impact on students&#x27; results. In response to criticisms about the increased workload inspection frameworks caused, Ofsted pledged it would not change its inspection framework during the school year. Wilshaw also dismissed speculation that Ofsted itself was responsible for teachers&#x27; heavy workload (in excess of 60 hours per week) describing it as &#x27;a red herring&#x27;. However, a 2015 poll by the NUT found that 53% of teachers were planning to leave teaching by 2017, with the extra workload from Ofsted&#x27;s &#x27;accountability agenda&#x27; a key factor in seeking a job with a better work/life balance.

The Ofsted complaints procedure has also been heavily criticised for opacity and a strong bias in favour of the inspectors. Geoff Barton, after writing an article strongly critical of Ofsted&#x27;s use of raw data rather than inspection reports to determine grades, noted that: the Ofsted complaints procedure too often seems constructed around a deep and dutiful need for self-protection. Thus an inspection system that demands transparency from schools refuses to release its own inspection notes, When challenged, it dares us to resort to a Freedom of Information request and then rejects those same requests because they don&#x27;t conform to a definition of &quot;public interest&quot;.

In 2015, an inspector revealed that inspection judgements can be arbitrarily over-ruled by senior figures, commenting on a case where a school had been downgraded: We couldn&#x27;t understand this rationale at all. It turned out that Ofsted had made a brief visit to the school some time before the inspection and had come up with some sort of unreported provisional judgement. So all that evidence we had gathered meant nothing and essentially this team of experienced inspectors was not trusted to make a judgement. Barton concluded his article, &quot;the accounts above reveal an inspection system that appears in too many cases to be doing great damage. My sense is that it&#x27;s time to stop quietly accepting that the way Ofsted is the way Ofsted should be.&quot; In response, Wilshaw attacked Barton for being &quot;too quick to perpetuate a &#x27;them against us&#x27; view of the schools inspectorate... we fall back on a &#x27;clichéd defence-mechanism&#x27; of whingeing about inconsistency&quot;, and insisted that Ofsted was becoming &quot;more rigorous and demanding&quot;. However, Barton argued the letter lost some of its force and all of its credibility for being published on the day 40% of inspectors were sacked for not being up to the job.

In 2019, Ofsted commissioned a survey on teachers&#x27; wellbeing. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that &quot;Teachers said they spent less than half their time in the classroom, with the bulk of their hours spent on marking, planning and administration, including data entry and feedback required by school management to prepare for Ofsted inspections.&quot; Teachers worked a 50 to 57 hour week. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said &quot;Ofsted and the government are the source of much of the stress and anxiety on staff through an extremely high-pressure accountability system.&quot;

On 8 January 2023, Ruth Perry, head at Caversham Primary School in Reading, Berkshire, killed herself while waiting for the publication of a report that downgraded her school from outstanding to inadequate. Perry&#x27;s family said she had described the previous November&#x27;s inspection as the worst day of her life. The National Education Union, school leaders&#x27; union NAHT and the Association of School and College Leaders called for inspections to be halted, and a petition calling for an enquiry into the inspection received more than 230,000 signatures. HM Chief Inspector of Education, Children&#x27;s Services and Skills (the head of Ofsted), Amanda Spielman, rejected the calls to halt Ofsted inspections. As a reaction to the news of Perry&#x27;s death, heads at some schools have worn black armbands during inspections or removed references to Ofsted from their websites.

On 25 March 2023, research carried out by the Hazards Campaign and the University of Leeds as reported in &quot;The Observer&quot;, stated that &quot;Stress caused by Ofsted inspections was cited in coroners&#x27; reports on the deaths of 10 teachers over the past 25 years&quot;. In 2015 headteacher Carol Woodward killed herself following an Ofsed Inspection that downgraded her school to inadequate, and in 2013 headteacher Helen Mann hanged herself when Ofsted advised that her plans to transform the curriculum were not happening quickly enough and her school would lose its top level rating.

A second Ofsted report into Caversham Primary School, published in July 2023, rated the school as good. On 7 December 2023, senior coroner Heidi Connor said the inspection &quot;lacked fairness, respect and sensitivity&quot; and was at times &quot;rude and intimidating&quot;, where the inquest ruled that the Ofsted inspection &quot;likely contributed&quot; to the death of head teacher Ruth Perry. Ms Connor said a prevention of future death notice will be issued and she &quot;very much hopes&quot; the results of the inquest will be used by the Education Select Committee&#x27;s inquiry into Ofsted and how it works.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Hope and Glory&quot;, a BBC television drama featuring actor/comedian Lenny Henry, gave an insight into a fictional portrayal of teachers dealing with a school in Special Measures.
&quot;OFSTED! The Musical&quot; was launched in 2004 at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The piece enjoyed a total sell-out run at Venue 45 and won the Writers&#x27; Guild Award for Drama 2004 and the List Magazine Award. The musical was later broadcast on Teachers TV as part of their launch night schedule.
&quot;Summerhill&quot;, a BBC TV drama, depicted the school being threatened with closure due to an inspection and winning a court case in 2000 against the DfE and its actions based on the inspection report.

<text>Ramana Maharshi (; ; 30 December 1879 – 14 April 1950) was an Indian Hindu sage and &quot;jivanmukta&quot; (liberated being). He was born Venkataraman Iyer, but is mostly known by the name Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi.

He was born in Tiruchuli, Tamil Nadu, India in 1879. In 1895, an attraction to the sacred hill Arunachala and the 63 Nayanmars was aroused in him, and in 1896, at the age of 16, he had a &quot;death-experience&quot; in which he became aware of a &quot;current&quot; or &quot;force&quot; (&quot;avesam&quot;) which he recognized as his true &quot;I&quot; or &quot;self&quot;, and which he later identified with &quot;the personal God, or Iswara&quot;, that is, Shiva. This resulted in a state that he later described as &quot;the state of mind of Iswara or the jnani&quot;. Six weeks later he left his uncle&#x27;s home in Madurai, and journeyed to the holy mountain Arunachala, in Tiruvannamalai, where he took on the role of a sannyasin (though not formally initiated), and remained for the rest of his life.

He attracted devotees that regarded him as an avatar of Shiva and came to him for darshan (&quot;the sight of God&quot;). In later years, an ashram grew up around him, where visitors received upadesa (&quot;spiritual instruction&quot;) by sitting silently in his company or by asking questions. Since the 1930s his teachings have been popularized in the West.

Ramana Maharshi approved a number of paths and practices, but recommended self-enquiry as the principal means to remove ignorance and abide in self-awareness, together with bhakti (devotion) or surrender to the Self.

==Biography==
===Early years (1879–1895)===
Ramana Maharshi was born Venkataraman Iyer on 30 December 1879 in the village Tiruchuzhi near Aruppukkottai, Virudhunagar District in Tamil Nadu, India. He was the second of four children in an orthodox Hindu Brahmin family. His father was Sundaram Iyer (1848–1890), from the lineage of Parashara, and his mother was Azhagammal (1864–1922). He had two brothers Nagaswami (1877–1900) and Nagasundaram (1886–1953), along with a younger sister Alamelu (1887–1953). His father was a court pleader.

Both a paternal uncle of his father and his father&#x27;s brother had become sannyasins. Venkataraman&#x27;s family belonged to the Smarta denomination, and regularly worshiped Shiva, Vishnu, Ganesha, Surya and Shakti in their home.

When Venkataraman was seven he had his upanayana, the traditional initiation of the three upper varnas into Brahmanical learning and the knowledge of Self. He had a very good memory, and was able to recall information after hearing it once, an ability he used to memorize Tamil poems.

Narasimha notes that Venkataraman used to sleep very deeply, not waking from loud sounds, nor even when his body was beaten by others. When he was about twelve years old, he may have experienced spontaneous deep meditative states. &quot;Sri Ramana Vijayam&quot;, the Tamil biography that first appeared in the 1920s, describes a period a few years before the death-experience in Madurai:
When he was about eleven his father sent him to live with his paternal uncle Subbaiyar in Dindigul as he wanted his sons to be educated in the English language, so that they would be eligible to enter government service. Only Tamil was taught at the village school in Tiruchuzhi, which he attended for three years. In 1891, when his uncle was transferred to Madurai, Venkataraman and his elder brother Nagaswami moved with him. In Dindigul, Venkataraman attended a Hindu School where English was taught, and stayed there for a year.

His father, Sundaram Iyer, died suddenly on 18 February 1892. After his father&#x27;s death, the family split up; Venkataraman and Nagaswami stayed with Subbaiyar in Madurai.

===Adolescence and realization (1895–1896)===


Venkataraman first attended Scott&#x27;s Middle School and then the American Mission High School where he became acquainted with Christianity.

In November 1895 Venkataraman realized that Arunachala, the sacred mountain, was a real place. He had known of its existence from an early age, and was overwhelmed by the realisation that it really existed. During this time he also read Sekkizhar&#x27;s &quot;Periyapuranam&quot;, a book that describes the lives of the 63 Nayanmars, which &quot;made a great impression&quot; on him, and revealed to him that &quot;Divine Union&quot; is possible. According to Osborne, a new current of awareness started to awaken during his visits to the Meenakshi Temple at Madurai, &quot;a state of blissful consciousness transcending both the physical and mental plane and yet compatible with full use of the physical and mental faculties&quot;. But Ramana Maharshi later stated that he remained uninterested in religion or spirituality until his awakening eight months later.

According to Narasimha, in July 1896, at age 16, he had a sudden fear of death. He was struck by &quot;a flash of excitement&quot; or &quot;heat&quot;, like some &quot;avesam&quot;, a &quot;current&quot; or &quot;force&quot; that seemed to possess him, while his body became rigid. A process of self-enquiry was initiated, asking himself, &quot;what it is that dies?&quot; He concluded the body dies, but this &quot;current&quot; or &quot;force&quot; remains alive, and recognized this &quot;current&quot; or &quot;force&quot; as his &quot;Self&quot;, which he later identified with &quot;the personal God, or Iswara&quot;.

In one of his rare written comments on this process Ramana Maharshi wrote, &quot;inquiring within &quot;Who is the seer?&quot; I saw the seer disappear leaving That alone which stands forever. No thought arose to say &quot;I saw&quot;. How then could the thought arise to say &quot;I did not see&quot;.&quot;

Later in life, he called his death experience &quot;akrama mukti&quot;, &quot;sudden liberation&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;krama mukti&quot;, &quot;gradual liberation&quot; as in the Vedanta path of jnana yoga. It resulted in a state of mind which he later described as &quot;the state of mind of Iswara or the jnani:&quot;
After this event, he lost interest in school studies, friends, and relations. He was absent-minded at school, &quot;imagining and expecting God would suddenly drop down from Heaven before me&quot;. Avoiding company, he preferred to sit alone, absorbed in concentration on this current or force, and went daily to the Meenakshi Temple, ecstatically devoted to the images of the 63 Nayanmars and of Nataraja, wanting &quot;the same grace as was shown to those saints&quot;, praying that he &quot;should have the same bhakti that they had&quot; and &quot;[weeping] that God should give me the same grace He gave to those saints&quot;.

Knowing his family would not permit him to become a sanyassin and leave home, Venkataraman slipped away, telling his brother he needed to attend a special class at school. Venkataraman boarded the train on 29 August 1896 and reached Tiruvannamalai on 1 September 1896 where he remained for the rest of his life.

===Tiruvannamalai temples (1896–1899)===
====Arunachaleswara temple (1896–1897)====
When Maharshi arrived in Tiruvannamalai, he went to the temple of Arunachaleswara. He spent the first few weeks in the thousand-pillared hall, then shifted to other spots in the temple, and eventually to the Patala-lingam vault so that he could remain undisturbed. There, he spent days absorbed in such deep samādhi that he was unaware of the bites of vermin and pests. Seshadri Swamigal, a local saint, discovered him in the underground vault and tried to protect him. After about six weeks in the Patala-lingam vault, he was carried out and cleaned up. For the next two months he stayed in the Subramanya Shrine, so unaware of his body and surroundings that food had to be placed in his mouth to keep him from starving.

====Gurumurtam temple (1897–1898)====
In February 1897, six months after his arrival at Tiruvannamalai, Ramana Maharshi moved to Gurumurtam, a temple about a mile away. Shortly after his arrival a sadhu named Palaniswami went to see him. Palaniswami&#x27;s first darshan left him filled with peace and bliss, and from that time on, he served Ramana Maharshi as his permanent attendant. Besides physical protection, Palaniswami would also beg for alms, cook and prepare meals for himself and Ramana Maharshi, and care for him as needed. In May 1898 Ramana Maharshi moved to a mango orchard next to Gurumurtam.

Osborne wrote that during this time Ramana Maharshi completely neglected his body. He also ignored the ants which bit him incessantly. Gradually, despite Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s desire for privacy, he attracted attention from visitors who admired his silence and austerities, bringing offerings and singing praises. Eventually a bamboo fence was built to protect him.

While living at the Gurumurtam temple his family discovered his whereabouts. First, his uncle Nelliappa Iyer came and pleaded with him to return home, promising that the family would not disturb his ascetic life. Ramana Maharshi sat motionless, and eventually his uncle gave up.

In September 1898 Ramana Maharshi moved to the Shiva-temple at Pavalakkunru, one of the eastern spurs of Arunachala. He refused to return even though his mother begged him to.

===Arunachala (1899–1922)===

Soon after this, in February 1899, Ramana Maharshi left the foothills to live in Arunachala. He stayed briefly in Satguru Cave and Guhu Namasivaya Cave before taking up residence at Virupaksha Cave for the next 17 years, using Mango Tree cave during the summers, except for a six-month period at Pachaiamman Koil during the plague epidemic.

In 1902, a government official named Sivaprakasam Pillai, with writing slate in hand, visited the young Swami in the hope of obtaining answers to questions about &quot;How to know one&#x27;s true identity&quot;. The fourteen questions he asked the young Swami and his answers formed Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s first teachings on Self-enquiry, the method for which he became widely known, and were eventually published as &quot;Nan Yar?&quot;, or in English, &quot;Who am I?&quot;.

Many visitors came to him and some became his devotees. Kavyakantha Sri Ganapati Sastri, a Vedic scholar of repute in his age, with a deep knowledge of the Srutis, Sastras, Tantras, Yoga, and Agama systems, but lacking the personal &quot;darshan&quot; of Shiva, came to visit Ramana Maharshi in 1907. After receiving &quot;upadesa&quot; from him on self-enquiry, he proclaimed him as Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi. Ramana Maharshi was known by this name from then on. Ganapati Sastri passed on these instructions to his own students, but later in life confessed that he had never been able to achieve permanent Self-abidance. Nevertheless, he was highly valued by Ramana Maharshi and played an important role in his life.

In 1911, the first westerner, Frank Humphreys, then a police officer stationed in India, discovered Ramana Maharshi and wrote articles about him, which were first published in &quot;The International Psychic Gazette&quot; in 1913.

In an appendix to &quot;Self realisation,&quot; Narasimha wrote that in 1912, while in the company of disciples, Ramana Maharshi had an epileptic seizure, in which his vision was suddenly impaired three times by a &quot;white bright curtain&quot; which covered a part of his vision. On the third instance, his vision was completely shut out, while his &quot;head was swimming&quot;, and he felt his heart stop beating and his breathing seize. His skin turned blue, as if he was dead. This lasted for about ten or fifteen minutes, after which &quot;a shock passed suddenly through the body&quot;, and his blood circulation and his respiration returned. In response to &quot;strange accounts&quot; about this event, Ramana Maharshi later explained that it was a seizure, which he used to have occasionally, and that he did not bring it on himself. According to Osborne, it &quot;marked the final completion of Sri Bhagavan&#x27;s return to full outer normality&quot;.

In 1916, his mother Alagammal and younger brother Nagasundaram joined Ramana Maharshi at Tiruvannamalai and followed him when he moved to the larger Skandashram Cave, where Bhagavan lived until the end of 1922. His mother took up the life of a &quot;sannyasin&quot; and Ramana Maharshi began to give her intense, personal instruction, while she took charge of the Ashram kitchen. Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s younger brother, Nagasundaram, also became a &quot;sannyasi&quot;, assuming the name Niranjanananda and becoming known as Chinnaswami (the younger Swami).

During this period, Ramana Maharshi composed &quot;The Five Hymns to Arunachala&quot;, his magnum opus in devotional lyric poetry. The first hymn is &quot;Akshara Mana Malai&quot;. It was composed in Tamil in response to the request of a devotee for a song to be sung while wandering in the town for alms. The &quot;Akshara Mana Malai&quot; (Marital Garland of Letters) tells, in glowing symbolism, of the love and union between the human soul and God, expressing the attitude of the soul that still aspires.

Starting in 1920, his mother&#x27;s health deteriorated. She died on 19 May 1922 while Ramana Maharshi sat beside her.
===Sri Ramanasramam (1922–1950)===
====Commencement of Ramanasramam (1922–1930)====
From 1922 until his death in 1950, Ramana Maharshi lived in Sri Ramanasramam, the ashram that developed around his mother&#x27;s tomb. Ramana Maharshi often walked from Skandashram to his mother&#x27;s tomb. In December 1922, he did not return to Skandashram, and settled at the base of the Hill, and Sri Ramanasramam started to develop. At first, there was only one hut at the &quot;samadhi&quot;, but in 1924 two huts were erected - one opposite the &quot;samadhi&quot; and the other to the north. The so-called Old Hall was built in 1928, where Ramana Maharshi lived until 1949.

Sri Ramanasramam grew to include a library, hospital, post-office and many other facilities. Ramana Maharshi displayed a natural talent for planning building projects. Annamalai Swami gave detailed accounts of this in his reminiscences. Until 1938, Annamalai Swami was entrusted with the task of supervising the projects and received his instructions directly from Ramana Maharshi.

Ramana Maharshi led a modest and renunciate life. However, according to David Godman, who has written extensively about Ramana Maharshi, the popular image of him as a person who spent most of his time doing nothing except sitting silently in samadhi is highly inaccurate. From the period when an Ashram began to rise around him after his mother arrived, until his later years when his health failed, Ramana Maharshi was actually quite active in Ashram activities such as cooking and stitching leaf plates.

====Discovery by westerners (1930–1940)====
In 1931 a biography of Ramana Maharshi, &quot;Self Realisation: The Life and Teachings of Ramana Maharshi&quot;, written by B. V. Narasimha, was published. Ramana Maharshi then became relatively well known in and out of India after 1934 when Paul Brunton, having first visited Ramana Maharshi in January 1931, published the book &quot;A Search in Secret India&quot;. In this book he describes how he was compelled by the Paramacharya of Kanchi to meet Ramana Maharshi, his meeting with Ramana Maharshi, and the effect this meeting had on him. Brunton also describes how Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s fame had spread, &quot;so that pilgrims to the temple were often induced to go up the hill and see him before they returned home&quot;. Brunton calls Ramana Maharshi &quot;one of the last of India&#x27;s spiritual supermen&quot;, and describes his affection toward Ramana Maharshi:
While staying at Sri Ramanasramam, Brunton had an experience of a &quot;sublimely all-embracing&quot; awareness, a &quot;Moment of Illumination&quot;. The book was a best-seller and introduced Ramana Maharshi to a wider audience in the west. Resulting visitors included Paramahansa Yogananda, Somerset Maugham (whose 1944 novel &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; models its spiritual guru after Ramana Maharshi), Mercedes de Acosta and Arthur Osborne, the last of whom was the first editor of &quot;Mountain Path&quot; in 1964, the magazine published by Ramanasramam.

====Final years (1940–1950)====
In November 1948, a tiny cancerous lump was found on Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s arm and was removed in February 1949 by the ashram&#x27;s doctor. Soon, another growth appeared, and an eminent surgeon performed another operation in March 1949 with radium applied. The doctor told Ramana Maharshi that a complete amputation of the arm to the shoulder was required to save his life, but he refused. Third and fourth operations were performed in August and December 1949, but only weakened him. Other systems of medicine were then tried; all proved fruitless and were stopped by the end of March when devotees gave up all hope. To devotees who begged him to cure himself for the sake of his followers, Ramana Maharshi is said to have replied, &quot;Why are you so attached to this body? Let it go&quot;, and &quot;Where can I go? I am here.&quot; By April 1950, Ramana Maharshi was too weak to go to the hall and visiting hours were limited. Visitors would file past the small room where he spent his last days to get one final glimpse. He died on 14 April 1950 at 8:47 p.m. At the same time a shooting star was seen, which impressed some of his devotees as a synchronicity.

==Devotion==
Ramana Maharshi was, and is, regarded by many as an outstanding enlightened being. He was considered to be a charismatic person, and attracted many devotees, some of whom saw him as an avatar and the embodiment of Shiva.

===&quot;Darshan&quot; and &quot;prasad&quot;===

Many devotees visited Ramana Maharshi for &quot;darshan&quot;, the sight of a holy person or God incarnate, which is advantageous and transmits merit. According to Flood, in Indian religions the guru is akin to the image or statue of a deity in the temple, and both possess power and a sacred energy. According to Osborne, Ramana Maharshi regarded giving darshan as &quot;his task in life&quot;, and said that he had to be accessible to all who came. Even during his terminal illness at the end of his life, he demanded to be approachable for all who came for his &quot;darshan&quot;.

Objects being touched or used by him were highly valued by his devotees, &quot;as they considered it to be &quot;prasad&quot; and that it passed on some of the power and blessing of the Guru to them&quot;. People also tried to touch his feet, which is also considered &quot;darshana&quot;. When one devotee asked if it would be possible to prostrate before Sri Ramana Maharshi and touch his feet, he replied:
In later life, the number of devotees and their devotion grew so large that Ramana Maharshi became restricted in his daily routine. Measures had to be taken to prevent people touching him. Several times Ramana Maharshi tried to escape from the ashram, to return to a life of solitude. Vasudeva reports: &quot;Bhagavan sat on a rock and said with tears in his eyes that he would never again come to the Ashram and would go where he pleased and live in the forests or caves away from all men.&quot;

Ramana Maharshi did return to the ashram, but has also reported himself on attempts to leave the ashram:
===Avatar===
Some of Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s devotees regarded him to be as Dakshinamurti; as an avatar of Skanda, a divine form of Shiva popular in Tamil Nadu; as an incarnation of Jnana Sambandar, one of the sixty-three Nayanars; and as an incarnation of Kumārila Bhaṭṭa, the 8th century Mimamsa-philosopher. According to Krishna Bhikshu, one of his early biographers:

===Indian devotees===
A number of Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s Indian devotees (a more extensive list of devotees can be found in V. Ganesan&#x27;s &quot;Ramana Periya Puranam&quot;):
*Ganapati Muni (1878–1936), Sanskrit scholar and poet, activist for Indian independence, and one of Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s foremost devotees. Muni devised the name &quot;Ramana Maharshi&quot;,
*Gudipati Venkatachalam (1894 to 1976), a noted Telugu writer, lived the later part of his life and died near Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s ashram in Arunachalam.
*H. W. L. Poonja, a teacher of self-enquiry, who learned about it when he visited Ramana Maharshi in the 1940s
* Swami Ramdas visited Ramana Maharshi while on pilgrimage in 1922, and after &quot;darshan&quot;, spent the next 21 days meditating in solitude in a cave on Arunachala. Thereafter, he attained the direct realisation that &quot;All was Rama, nothing but Rama.&quot;
* O. P. Ramaswamy Reddiyar, an Indian National Congress politician and freedom-fighter, who served as the Premier of Madras from 1947 to 1949.
* Sri Muruganar (1890-1973), &quot;the shadow of Bhagavan&quot;, &quot;is widely regarded as being one of the foremost devotees of Bhagavan.&quot;
* Manavasi Ramaswami Iyer, who composed &quot;Saranagati&quot;, a popular Tamil devotional song to Ramana Maharshi.
*Sri Sadhu Om, who compiled and edited Sri Muruganar&#x27;s collection of songs into a multi-volume series, a task that took him about 18 years.

===Western devotees===
A list of Western devotees of Ramana Maharshi (not comprehensive):
* Paul Brunton&#x27;s writings about Ramana Maharshi brought considerable attention to him in the West.
*Arthur Osborne, the first editor of the ashram journal, &quot;The Mountain Path&quot;.
*Maurice Frydman (a.k.a. Swami Bharatananda), a Polish-Jewish engineer and humanitarian who later translated Nisargadatta Maharaj&#x27;s work &quot;I Am That&quot; from Marathi to English, was also deeply influenced by Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s teachings. Many of the questions published in &quot;Maharshi&#x27;s Gospel&quot; (1939) were put by Maurice, and they elicited detailed replies from the Maharshi. Maharshi&#x27;s Gospel is the only English language text that was personally proofread by Ramana Maharshi - the original manuscript with corrections in Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s handwriting still exists in the Ashram Archives.
* Ethel Merston, who wrote about Ramana Maharshi in her memoirs.
* Mouni Sadhu (Mieczyslaw Demetriusz Sudowski) (17 August 189724 December 1971), an Australian author of spiritual, mystical and esoteric subjects.
* David Godman, a former librarian at the ashram, who has written about Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s teaching and the lives of Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s lesser-known attendants and devotees.

==Spiritual instruction==
Ramana Maharshi provided &quot;upadeśa&quot; (&quot;spiritual instruction&quot;) by providing darshan and sitting silently together with devotees and visitors, but also by answering the questions and concerns raised by those who sought him out. Many of these question-and-answer sessions have been transcribed and published by devotees, some of which have been edited by Ramana Maharshi himself. A few texts have been published which were written by Ramana Maharshi himself, or written down on his behalf and edited by him.

Ramana Maharshi also provided an example by his own devotion to Shiva, which has been extensively described by his devotees, such as walks around the holy hill Arunachala, in which devotees participated, and his hymns to Arunachala.

===&quot;Self&quot;===
Ramana Maharshi described his Self as a &quot;force&quot; or &quot;current&quot;, which descended on him in his death-experience, and continued throughout his life:
Ramana Maharshi used various terms to denote this Self. The most frequently used terms were &quot;sat-chit-ananda&quot;, which translates into English as &quot;truth-consciousness-bliss&quot;; God, Brahman and Siva, and the Heart, which is not to be confused with the physical heart, or a particular point in space, but was rather to indicate that &quot;the Self was the source from which all appearances manifested&quot;.

According to David Godman, the essence of Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s teachings is that the &quot;Self&quot; or real &quot;I&quot; is a &quot;non-personal, all-inclusive awareness&quot;: 
Ramana Maharshi considered the Self to be permanent and enduring, surviving physical death. &quot;The sleep, dream and waking states are mere phenomena appearing on the Self,&quot; as is the &quot;I&quot;-thought. Our &quot;true nature&quot; is &quot;simple Being, free from thoughts&quot;.

Ramana Maharshi would field many questions about &quot;jnanis&quot; (&quot;liberated beings&quot;) from devotees, but even the terms &quot;jnani&quot; and &quot;ajnani&quot; (non-liberated being) are incorrect, since it leads one to the idea of there being a knower and a known, a subject and an object. The truth of it according to Ramana Maharshi is that there are neither &quot;jnanis&quot; nor &quot;ajnanis&quot;, there is simply &quot;jnana&quot;, which is Self:
===Silence===
Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s main means of instruction to his devotees, in order to remove ignorance and abide in Self-awareness, was through silently sitting together with his visitors, using words only sparingly. His method of instruction has been compared to Dakshinamurti – Shiva in the ascetic appearance of the Guru, who teaches through silence:

Commenting upon this silence, Ramana Maharshi said:
Ankur Barua argues that Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s method of teaching resembled Socratic questioning, guiding seekers to reflect on the source of their own inquiries, which was often aided by silence. In his dialogues with devotees, Ramana emphasized the importance of exploring the nature of the questioner, and not the question. In such moments, the devotee is left in silence.

===Self-enquiry===
&quot;Vichara&quot;, &quot;Self-enquiry&quot;, also called &quot;ātma-vichār&quot; or &quot;jnana-vichara&quot; is the constant attention to the inner awareness of &quot;I&quot; or &quot;I am&quot;. Ramana Maharshi frequently recommended it as the most efficient and direct way of realizing Self-awareness, in response to questions on self-liberation and the classic texts on Yoga and Vedanta. He instructed his disciples to practice self-inquiry &quot;to access the ultimate source of the limited ego,&quot; and to experience &quot;the divine Self&quot; through direct experience, rather than through a mere intellectual process.

According to Ramana Maharshi, the I-thought is the sense of individuality: &quot;(&quot;Aham, aham&quot;) &#x27;I-I&#x27; is the Self; (&quot;Aham idam&quot;) &quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I am that&quot; is the ego.&quot; By paying attention to the &#x27;I&#x27;-thought, inquiring where it comes from, the &#x27;I&#x27;-thought will disappear and the &quot;shining forth&quot; (&quot;sphurana&quot;) of &quot;I-I&quot; or Self-awareness will appear. This results in an &quot;effortless awareness of being&quot;, and by staying with it this &quot;I-I&quot; gradually destroys the &quot;vasanas&quot; &quot;which cause the &#x27;I&#x27;-thought to rise&quot;. When the &quot;vasanas&quot; disappear, the mind, &quot;vritti&quot; also comes to rest, since it centers around the &#x27;I&#x27;-thought, and finally the &#x27;I&#x27;-thought never rises again, which is Self-realization or liberation:
Robert Forman notes that Ramana Maharshi made a distinction between &quot;samadhi&quot; and &quot;sahaja samadhi&quot;. &quot;Samadhi&quot; is a contemplative state, which is temporary, while in &quot;sahaja samadhi&quot; a &quot;silent state&quot; is maintained while engaged in daily activities. Ramana Maharshi himself stated repeatedly that &quot;samadhi&quot; only suppresses the &quot;vāsanās&quot;, the karmic impressions, but does not destroy them. Only by abiding in Self-awareness will the &quot;vāsanās&quot;, which create the sense of a separate self, be destroyed, and &quot;sahaja samadhi&quot; be attained.
===Bhakti===
Although Ramana Maharshi advocated self-enquiry as the fastest means to realization, he also recommended the path of &quot;bhakti&quot; and self-surrender (to one&#x27;s deity or guru) either concurrently or as an adequate alternative, which would ultimately converge with the path of self-enquiry. According to Ramana Maharshi, Jnana and Bhakti are not different paths, but both lead to the same goal: the realization of the Self. He taught that true Bhakti is love for the Self, and since the Self is God, love for the Self is also love for God.

Surrender has to be complete and desireless, without any expectations of solutions or rewards, or even liberation. It is a willingness to accept whatever happens. Surrender is not the willful act of an individual self, but the growing awareness that there is no individual self to surrender. Practice is aimed at the removal of ignorance, not at the attainment of realization.

===Reincarnation===
According to David Godman, Ramana Maharshi taught that the idea of reincarnation is based on wrong ideas about the individual self as being real. Ramana Maharshi would sometimes say that rebirth does exist, to step forward to those who were not able to fully grasp the non-reality of the individual self. But when this illusoriness is realized, there is no room any more for ideas about reincarnation. When the identification with the body stops, any notions about death and rebirth become inapplicable, since there is no birth or death within Self, a teaching known as Ajativada. Ramana Maharshi:
=== Yoga ===
Ramana Maharshi viewed yoga as a means to steady the mind and support self-enquiry. He suggested practices like devotion, breath control, and meditation (dhyana) to calm the restless mind and focus it on the self.

==Background==

===Indian spirituality===

According to Wehr, C. G. Jung noted that Ramana Maharshi is not to be regarded as an &quot;isolated phenomenon&quot;, but as a token of Indian spirituality, &quot;manifest in many forms in everyday Indian life&quot;. According to Zimmer and Jung, Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s appearance as a &quot;mauni&quot;, a silent saint absorbed in &quot;samadhi&quot;, fitted into pre-existing Indian notions of holiness. They placed the Indian devotion toward Ramana Maharshi in this Indian context.

According to Alan Edwards, the popular image of Ramana Maharshi as a timeless saint also served the construction of an Indian identity as inner-oriented and spiritual, in opposition to the oppressive, outer-oriented, materialistic culture of the British colonial rulers:
===Shaivism===

Though Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s answers explain and incorporate elements from Advaita Vedanta, his spiritual life is strongly associated with Shaivism. The Tamil compendium of devotional songs known as &quot;Tirumurai&quot;, along with the Vedas, the Shaiva Agamas and &quot;Meykanda&quot; or &quot;Siddhanta&quot; Shastras, form the scriptural canon of Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta. As a youth, prior to his awakening, Ramana Maharshi read the Periya Puranam, the stories of the 63 Tamil saints. In later life, he told those stories to his devotees:
Ramana Maharshi himself considered God, Guru and Self to be the manifestations of the same reality. Ramana Maharshi considered the Self to be his guru, in the form of the sacred mountain Arunachala, which is considered to be the manifestation of Shiva. Arunachala is one of the five main shaivite holy places in South India, which can be worshipped through the mantra &quot;Om arunachala shivaya namah!&quot; and by Pradakshina, walking around the mountain, a practice which was often performed by Ramana Maharshi. Asked about the special sanctity of Arunachala, Ramana Maharshi said that Arunachala is Shiva himself. In his later years, Ramana Maharshi said it was the spiritual power of Arunachala which had brought about his Self-realisation. He composed the &quot;Five Hymns to Arunachala&quot; as devotional song. On the three occasions Venkataraman (Ramana) referred to himself he used the name &quot;Arunachala Ramana&quot;. Ramana Maharshi also used to smear his forehead with holy ash, as a token of veneration.

In later life, Ramana Maharshi himself came to be regarded as Dakshinamurthy, an aspect of Shiva as a guru of all types of knowledge, and bestower of jnana. This aspect of Shiva is his personification as the supreme or the ultimate awareness, understanding and knowledge. This form represents Shiva in his aspect as a teacher of yoga, music, and wisdom, and giving exposition on the shastras.

===Acquaintance with Hindu scriptures===

During his lifetime, through contact with educated devotees like Ganapata Muni, Ramana Maharshi became acquainted with works on Shaivism and Advaita Vedanta, and used them to explain his insights:
Already in 1896, a few months after his arrival at Arunachala, Ramana Maharshi attracted his first disciple, Uddandi Nayinar, who recognised in him &quot;the living embodiment of the Holy Scriptures&quot;. Uddandi was well-versed in classic texts on Yoga and Vedanta, and recited texts as the &quot;Yoga Vasistha&quot; and &quot;Kaivalya Navaneeta&quot; in Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s presence.

In 1897 Ramana Maharshi was joined by Palaniswami, who became his attendant. Palaniswami studied books in Tamil on Vedanta, such as &quot;Kaivalya Navaneeta&quot;, Shankara&#x27;s &quot;Vivekachudamani&quot;, and &quot;Yoga Vasistha&quot;. He had difficulties understanding Tamil. Ramana Maharshi read the books too, and explained them to Palaniswami.

As early as 1900, when Ramana Maharshi was 20 years old, he became acquainted with the teachings of the Hindu monk and Neo-Vedanta teacher Swami Vivekananda through Gambhiram Seshayya. Seshayya was interested in yoga techniques, and &quot;used to bring his books and explain his difficulties&quot;. Ramana Maharshi answered on small scraps of paper, which were collected after his death in the late 1920s in a booklet called &quot;Vichara Sangraham&quot;, &quot;Self-enquiry&quot;.

One of the works that Ramana Maharshi used to explain his insights was the Ribhu Gita, a song at the heart of the Shivarahasya Purana, one of the &#x27;Shaiva Upapuranas&#x27; or ancillary Purana regarding Shiva and Shaivite worship. Another work used by him was the Dakshinamurti Stotram, a text by Shankara. It is a hymn to Shiva, explaining Advaita Vedanta.

Ramana Maharshi gave his approval to a variety of paths and practices from various religions, with his own upadesa (instruction or guidance given to a disciple by his Guru) always pointing to the true &quot;Self&quot; of the devotees.

===Advaita Vedanta===

In contrast to classical Advaita Vedanta, Ramana Maharshi emphasized the personal experience of self-realization, instead of philosophical argumentation and the study of scripture. Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s authority was based on his personal experience, from which he explained classic texts on Yoga and Vedanta, which he came acquainted with via his devotees. Arvind Sharma qualifies Ramana Maharshi as the chief exponent of &quot;experiential Advaita&quot;, to distinguish his approach from Shankara&#x27;s classical &quot;doctrinal Advaita&quot;. Fort classifies him as a neo-Vedantin, because of the focus on self-inquiry instead of philosophical speculation. Ramana Maharshi himself did not call his insights advaita, but said that &quot;dvaita&quot; and &quot;advaita&quot; are relative terms, based on a sense of duality, while the Self or Being is all there is.

Although Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s teaching is consistent with and generally associated with Hinduism, the Upanishads and Advaita Vedanta, there are differences with the traditional Advaitic school. Advaita recommends a negationist &quot;neti, neti&quot; (Sanskrit, &quot;not this&quot;, &quot;not this&quot;) path, or mental affirmations that the Self is the only reality, such as &quot;I am Brahman&quot; or &quot;I am He&quot;, while Ramana Maharshi advocated Self-enquiry &quot;Nan Yar&quot;. In contrast with traditional Advaita Vedanta, Ramana Maharshi strongly discouraged devotees from adopting a renunciate lifestyle and renouncing their responsibilities. To one devotee who felt he should abandon his family, whom he described as &quot;samsara&quot; (&quot;illusion&quot;), to intensify his spiritual practice, Sri Ramana Maharshi replied:
The scholar of religion Lola Williamson has described Indian gurus such as Ramana Maharshi, Meher Baba, Sri Aurobindo and Swami Satchidananda Saraswati as having developed &quot;Hindu-Inspired Meditation Movements&quot;, also called neo-Vedanta and modernist Hinduism.

==Legacy==
Although many claim to be influenced by him, Ramana Maharshi did not publicise himself as a guru, never claimed to have disciples, and never appointed any successors. While a few who came to see him are said to have become enlightened through association, he did not publicly acknowledge any living person as liberated other than his mother at death. Ramana Maharshi never promoted any lineage.

With regard to the Sri Ramana Ashram, in 1938 Maharshi made a legal will bequeathing all the Ramanashram properties to his younger brother Niranjanananda and his descendants. In 2013, Ramanashram is run by Sri Niranjananda&#x27;s grandson Sri V.S. Raman. Ramanashram is legally recognised as a public religious trust whose aim is to maintain it in a way that is consistent with Sri Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s declared wishes. The ashram should remain open as a spiritual institution so that anyone who wishes to can avail themselves of its facilities.

In the 1930s, Maharshi&#x27;s teachings were brought to the west by Paul Brunton in his &quot;A Search in Secret India&quot;. Stimulated by Arthur Osborne, in the 1960s Bhagawat Singh actively started to spread Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s teachings in the US. Ramana Maharshi has been further popularized in the west by the neo-Advaita movement, via the students of H. W. L. Poonja; this movement gives a western re-interpretation of his teachings by placing sole emphasis on insight alone. It has been criticized for this emphasis, omitting the preparatory practices. Nevertheless, Neo-Advaita has become an important constituent of popular western spirituality.

The scholar Philip Goldberg has listed Western religious thinkers influenced by Ramana Maharshi as including Francis X. Clooney, Georg Feuerstein, Bede Griffiths, Andrew Harvey, Thomas Merton, Henri Le Saux (Swami Abhishiktananada), Eckhart Tolle, and Ken Wilber.

==Works==
===Writings===
According to Ebert, Ramana Maharshi &quot;never felt moved to formulate his teaching of his own accord, either verbally or in writing&quot;. The few writings he is credited with &quot;came into being as answers to questions asked by his disciples or through their urging&quot;. Only a few hymns were written on his own initiative. Writings by Ramana Maharshi are:
* Gambhiram Sheshayya, &quot;Vichāra Sangraham&quot;, &quot;Self-Enquiry&quot;. Answers to questions, compiled in 1901, published in dialogue-form, republished as essay in 1939 as &quot;A Catechism of Enquiry&quot;. Also published in 1944 in Heinrich Zimmer&#x27;s &quot;Der Weg zum Selbst&quot;.
* Sivaprakasam Pillai, &quot;Nān Yār?&quot;, &quot;Who am I?&quot;. Answers to questions, compiled in 1902, first published in 1923.
* Five Hymns to Arunachala:
** &quot;Akshara Mana Malai&quot;, &quot;The Marital Garland of Letters&quot;. In 1914, at the request of a devotee, Ramana Maharshi wrote &quot;Akshara Mana Malai&quot; for his devotees to sing while on their rounds for alms. It&#x27;s a hymn in praise of Shiva, manifest as the mountain Arunachala. The hymn consists of 108 stanzas composed in poetic Tamil.
** &quot;Navamani Mālai&quot;, &quot;The Necklet of Nine Gems&quot;.

<doc id="301484" wikidata="Q3595121" url="?curid=301484" title="Sunderlal Bahuguna">
<text>Sunderlal Bahuguna (9 January 1927 – 21 May 2021) was an Indian environmentalist and Chipko movement leader. The idea of the Chipko movement was suggested by his wife Vimla Bahuguna and him. He fought for the preservation of forests in the Himalayas, first as a member of the Chipko movement in the 1970s, and later spearheaded the anti-Tehri Dam movement from the 1980s to early 2004. He was one of the early environmentalists of India, and later he and others associated with the Chipko movement and started taking up wider environmental issues, such as being opposed to large dams.

==Early life==
Sunderlal Bahuguna was born in the village Maroda near Tehri, Uttarakhand. He claimed in a function arranged at Kolkata, that his ancestors bearing surname Bandyopadhyaya, migrated from Bengal to Tehri, 800 years ago. Early on, he fought against untouchability and later started organising hill women in his anti-liquor drive from 1965 to 1970. He started social activities at the age of 13, under the guidance of Shri Dev Suman, who was a nationalist spreading a message of non-violence, and he was with the Congress Party of Uttar Pradesh at the time of Independence. Bahuguna also mobilised people against colonial rule before 1947. He adopted Gandhian principles in his life and married his wife Vimla with the condition that they would live among rural people and establish ashram in village. Inspired by Gandhi, he walked through Himalayan forests and hills, covering more than 4,700 kilometres (2920 miles) on foot and observed the damage done by mega developmental projects on the fragile ecosystem of the Himalayas and subsequent degradation of social life in villages.

==Chipko movement==
The Chipko movement started in the early 1970s in Uttarakhand (then a part of Uttar Pradesh) from spontaneous action by villagers to save trees from being cut down by forest contractors. In Hindi, &quot;chipko&quot; literally means &quot;to cling&quot;, and the movement got this name since the people trying to save the trees started hugging and Loving onto trees when lumbermen tried to fall those. One of Sunderlal Bahuguna&#x27;s notable contributions to the Chipko movement, and to environmentalism in general, was his creation of the Chipko&#x27;s slogan &quot;Ecology is permanent economy&quot;. Sunderlal Bahuguna helped bring the movement to prominence through a 5,000-kilometer trans-Himalaya march undertaken from 1981 to 1983, travelling from village to village, gathering support for the movement. He had an appointment with the then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and that meeting is credited with resulting in Gandhi&#x27;s subsequent 15-year ban on cutting of green trees in 1980. He was also closely associated with Gaura Devi, one of the pioneers of the movement.

==Anti Tehri Dam protests==

Bahuguna played a major role in the anti-Tehri Dam protests for decades. He used Satyagraha methods and repeatedly went on hunger strikes at the banks of Bhagirathi as a mark of his protest. In 1995, he called off a 45-day-long fast following an assurance from the then Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao of the appointment of a review committee on the ecological impacts of the dam. Thereafter he went on another long fast which lasted for 74 days at Gandhi Samadhi, Raj Ghat, during the tenure of Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda, who gave personal undertaking of project review. However, despite a court case which ran in the Supreme Court for over a decade, work resumed at the Tehri Dam in 2001, after which he was arrested on 24 April 2001.

Eventually, the dam reservoir started filling up in 2004, and on 31 July 2004, he was finally evacuated to new accommodation at Koti. Later he shifted to the capital city of Uttarakhand, Dehradun, and began living there with his wife.

==Legacy and inspiration==

On 8 September 1983, Pandurang Hegde, an environmental activist from Karnataka, started the Appiko (Kannada for Chipko, &quot;to hug&quot;) movement to protest against the felling of trees, monoculture, and deforestation in the Western Ghats, deriving inspiration from Sunderlal Bahugana and the Chipko movement. Bahuguna had visited the region in 1979 to help in the campaign against the proposed Bedthi hydroelectric project. After the Appiko movement started, Bahuguna and Pandurang Hegde walked across many parts of south India promoting conservation of ecology, especially the protection of the Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot. This and the broader Save the Western Ghats Movement led to a moratorium on green felling across the region in 1989.

While best known as an environmental activist and as a passionate defender of the Himalayan people and India&#x27;s rivers, Bahuguna also worked to improve the plight of the hill people, especially working women, and was associated with temperance movements and earlier on with struggles against casteist discrimination.

Bahuguna died on 21 May 2021, due to COVID-19 complications. Shortly after, he was commemorated by Amul in one of its advertisements.

On 21 May 2022, Bahuguna&#x27;s daughter, Madhu Pathak edited and published a souvenir book on his life and work. This book has contributions from reputed social activists, writers, intellectuals and politicians. In addition to Bahuguna&#x27;s life and work, this book also helps the reader in understanding ecological mass-movements in Garhwal Himalayan region.

==Awards==

* 1987: Right Livelihood Award (Chipko Movement)
* 1981: Padma Shri (Refused) In 1981 Bahuguna had refused to accept the Padma Shri over the government&#x27;s refusal to cancel the Tehri dam project despite his protests.

* 1989: Honorary Degree of Doctor of Social Sciences was conferred by IIT Roorkee.

<doc id="301486" wikidata="Q468374" url="?curid=301486" title="Ravi Shankar (spiritual leader)">
<text>Ravi Shankar (born 13 May 1956) is an Indian guru and spiritual leader. He is also referred to as [[Sri|Sri Sri]] or Gurudev. From around the mid 1970s, he worked as an apprentice under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of Transcendental Meditation. In 1981, he founded the Art of Living foundation.

==Life==
Shankar was born on 13 May 1956 in Papanasam, Tamil Nadu, to Vishalakshi and R.S.Venkat Ratnam. He was named &quot;Ravi&quot; (an Indian name which means &quot;sun&quot;) because his birth was on a Sunday, and &quot;Shankar&quot; after the eighth-century Hindu saint, Adi Shankara, whose birthday was the same day as Ravi Shankar&#x27;s. 

Shankar&#x27;s first teacher was Sudhakar Chaturvedi, an Indian Vedic Scholar and a close associate of Mahatma Gandhi. He graduated from the St. Joseph&#x27;s University, Bangalore with a Bachelor of Science degree. After graduation, he travelled with his second teacher, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, giving talks and arranging conferences on Vedic science, and setting up Transcendental Meditation and Ayurveda centers.

In the 1980s, he initiated a series of practical and experiential courses in spirituality around the globe. He says that his rhythmic breathing practice, Sudarshan Kriya, came to him in 1982, &quot;like a poem, an inspiration&quot;, after a ten-day period of silence on the banks of the Bhadra River in Shivamogga, in the state of Karnataka, adding, &quot;I learned it and started teaching it&quot;.

In 1983, he held the first Art of Living course in Switzerland. In 1986, he travelled to Apple Valley, California, in the US to conduct the first course to be held in North America.

==Philosophy and teachings==

===Spirituality===
He believes spirituality is that which enhances human values such as love, compassion and enthusiasm. It is not limited to any one religion or culture. Hence it is open to all people. According to him, the spiritual bond we share as part of the human family is more important than nationality, gender, religion, profession, or other identities that separate us.

According to him, science and spirituality are linked and compatible, both springing from the urge to know. The question, &quot;Who am I?&quot; leads to spirituality; the question, &quot;What is this?&quot; leads to science. Emphasizing that joy is only available in the present moment, his stated vision is to create a world free of stress and violence. His programs are said to offer practical tools to help accomplish this. He sees breath as the link between body and mind, and a tool to relax the mind, emphasising the importance of both meditation/spiritual practice and service to others. In his view, &quot;Truth is spherical rather than linear; so it has to be contradictory.&quot;

==Peace and humanitarian work==

===Pakistan===
He visited Pakistan in 2004 on a goodwill mission and again in 2012 when he inaugurated Art of Living centers in Islamabad and Karachi. The Islamabad center was burned down by armed men in March 2014.

===Iraq===
During his visits to Iraq, at the invitation of Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki, in 2007 and again in 2008, he met with political and religious leaders to promote global peace. In November 2014, Shankar visited the relief camps in Erbil, Iraq. He also hosted a conference to address the dire condition of Yazidis and other non-Muslims in the region.

===Colombia and FARC===
In June 2015, Shankar met with the delegations of Colombian government and the FARC who were negotiating the resolution to Colombian conflict in Havana. He urged FARC leaders to follow the Gandhian principle of non-violence to attain their political objectives and social justice. For his efforts, Colombia&#x27;s House of Representatives awarded him the Simón Bolívar Order of Democracy, Knight Cross grade.

===Venezuela===
In 2019, Shankar met with Venezuelan leaders from both sides to encourage dialogue, end the political conflict and restore peace and stability in the country.

===Kashmir, India===
The South Asian Forum for Peace was launched in November 2016 at a conference titled &quot;Kashmir Back to Paradise&quot; in Jammu. According to Shankar, 90% of people in Kashmir want peace but are neglected. He added, &quot;The solution to the Kashmir problem can only come from the Kashmiris&quot;. This forum is intended to bring together eight South Asian countries to cooperate in areas such as entrepreneurship, skill development, cultural exchange, educational partnerships and women&#x27;s empowerment.

===Northeast India===
68 militants from 11 militant outfits surrendered to the government in Manipur on the eve of India&#x27;s 71st Independence Day in August 2017. The Chief Minister of Manipur, N. Biren Singh, lauded Shankar for his efforts in making this happen and &quot;bringing peace in troubled areas&quot;. Ravi Shankar&#x27;s organization has been working in Manipur for the last 15 years.

In September 2017, at the &quot;Strength in Diversity – North East Indigenous People&#x27;s Conference&quot;, Ravi Shankar claimed that another 500 militants were waiting to &quot;lay down weapons and join the peace process&quot;. The conference was attended by representatives from 67 rebel outfits from the Northeast. Expressing his willingness to facilitate the peaceful transition of any rebel group wanting to join the mainstream, Ravi Shankar claimed that his organization has been working for this for the last 10–12 years and &quot;will continue to work until the last gun is laid down&quot;. Former ULFA General Secretary, Anup Chetia, who was also the convenor of the conference, appreciated Ravi Shankar&#x27;s interest and efforts for peace in the region.

===Ayodhya Ram Mandir dispute===
Ravi Shankar&#x27;s efforts at mediation in the Ayodhya dispute in 2017 received a mixed response from both Hindu and Muslim leaders. Based on Supreme Court of India&#x27;s suggestion for an out-of-court settlement, he proposed a mutual compromise where both communities &quot;gift&quot; neighbouring pieces of land to each other. This proposal was met with a lot of skepticism and resistance.

In March 2019, he was appointed by the Supreme Court of India to a 3-member mediation committee tasked with finding a resolution for the case in 8 weeks. In its final verdict, the Supreme Court of India assigned the disputed land to a trust for building a temple and an alternate piece of land nearby to build a mosque.

===Interfaith dialogue===
Ravi Shankar is involved in interfaith dialogue and currently sits on the Board of World Religious Leaders for the Elijah Interfaith Institute. Through interfaith summits in 2008 and 2010, he has been engaging faith-based leaders for collective action against HIV. In July 2013 at a meeting in UNAIDS headquarters in Geneva, issues including HIV prevention, gender based violence, stigma and discrimination were discussed.

===Prison program===
In 1992, he started a prison programme to rehabilitate prison inmates and help them reintegrate into society.

In 2009, Shankar was named by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine as the fifth most powerful leader in India.

==Criticism==
In 2012, Ravi Shankar, while attending a function in Jaipur, claimed that some Indian government schools are breeding grounds for Naxalism, a movement of militant communist groups in India declared to be terrorist organisations. &quot;All government schools and colleges should be privatised. The government should not run any school. It&#x27;s often found that children from government schools get into Naxalism and violence. Children from private schools don&#x27;t get into this,&quot; he was quoted as saying by media reports, his comments were condemned by educationists and ministers as &quot;unfortunate, illogical&quot;, and termed it as a &quot;bizarre logic for privatisation&quot; Later, he issued a clarification that he didn&#x27;t mean that all government schools breed Naxalism. More clarification followed on his Twitter account: &quot;I specifically referred to sick government schools in Naxal affected areas. Many who have turned to Naxalism have come from these schools. I did not say all Govt schools (where lakhs study) breed Naxalism. Great talents have emerged from these schools &amp; I would never generalize.&quot;

In March 2018, he faced criticism from political leaders for his commentary, where he said, India will turn into Syria if the Ram temple issue is not resolved soon.

<text>Nahum Tate ( ; 1652 – 30 July 1715) was an Anglo-Irish poet, hymnist, and lyricist, who became Poet Laureate in 1692. Tate is best known for &quot;The History of King Lear&quot;, his 1681 adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;, and for his libretto for Henry Purcell&#x27;s opera, &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;. He also wrote the lyrics to a Christmas carol, &quot;While shepherds watched their flocks&quot;.

==Life==
Nahum Tate was born in Dublin and came from a family of Puritan clerics. He was the son of Faithful Teate, an Irish cleric whose father, also Faithful, had been rector of Castleterra, Ballyhaise, until his house was burnt and his family attacked during the Irish Rebellion of 1641.

After living at the provost&#x27;s lodgings in Trinity College Dublin, Faithful Teate moved to England. He was the incumbent at East Greenwich around 1650, and &quot;preacher of the gospel&quot; at Sudbury from 1654 to 1658. He had returned to Dublin by 1660. He published a poem on the Trinity entitled &quot;Ter Tria&quot;, as well as some sermons, two of which he dedicated to Oliver and Henry Cromwell.

Nahum Teate followed his father to Trinity College Dublin in 1668, and graduated BM in 1672. By 1676, he had moved to London and was writing for a living. The following year, he had adopted the spelling &quot;Tate&quot;, which would remain until his death. He died within the precincts of the Mint, Southwark, where he had taken refuge from his creditors, on 30 July 1715 and was buried at St George the Martyr, Southwark on 1 August as &quot;of next to the Prince Eugene, Mint&quot;.

==Works==

Tate published a volume of poems in London in 1677, and became a regular writer for the stage. &quot;Brutus of Alba, or The Enchanted Lovers&quot; (1678), a tragedy dealing with Dido and Aeneas, was dedicated to Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset; it was later adapted as the libretto for Henry Purcell&#x27;s opera &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; (1688 or earlier). &quot;The Loyal General&quot;, with a prologue by Dryden, played at the Dorset Garden Theatre in 1680.

Tate then turned to making a series of adaptations of Elizabethan dramas. His version of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot; altered the names of the characters, and changed the text so that every scene, he wrote, was &quot;full of respect to Majesty and the dignity of courts&quot;; in spite of these precautions, though, &quot;The Sicilian Usurper&quot; (1681), as his adaptation was called, was suppressed on the third performance on account of a possible political interpretation. In 1681, Thomas Betterton played Tate&#x27;s version of &quot;King Lear&quot; (&quot;The History of King Lear&quot;), in which the Fool is omitted. Cordelia has a confidante named Arante, and has her own &quot;abduction&quot; scene on the heath. This version concludes with several happy endings with a presumed marriage between Cordelia and Edgar, for Lear (who regains his throne) and Kent. Although Joseph Addison protested at this mutilation of Shakespeare, Samuel Johnson defended the poetic justice of Tate&#x27;s adaptation. &quot;Coriolanus&quot; became &quot;The Ingratitude of a Commonwealth&quot;, performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1682. Tate&#x27;s farce &quot;A Duke and No Duke&quot; (first printed 1685, but acted earlier at the Theatre Royal) imitated Sir Aston Cockayne&#x27;s &quot;Trappolin suppos&#x27;d a Prince&quot;. His &quot;Cuckold&#x27;s Haven&quot; (performed 1685 at the Theatre Royal) was derived from Chapman and John Marston&#x27;s &quot;Eastward Ho&quot;. &quot;The Island Princess, or the Generous Portugals&quot; (1687) was adapted from John Fletcher. &quot;Injur&#x27;d Love, or the Cruel Husband&quot; (1707), altered from John Webster&#x27;s &quot;The White Devil&quot;, seems never to have been acted.

In 1682, Tate collaborated with John Dryden to complete the second half of his epic poem &quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot;.

Tate wrote the libretto for Henry Purcell&#x27;s opera &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;; its first known performance was in 1689. He also wrote the text for Purcell&#x27;s Birthday Ode &quot;Come Ye Sons of Art&quot; in 1694. Tate also translated &quot;Syphilis sive Morbus Gallicus&quot;, Girolamo Fracastoro&#x27;s Latin pastoral poem on the subject of the disease of syphilis, into English heroic couplets.

Tate&#x27;s name is connected with &quot;New Version of the Psalms of David&quot; (1696), for which he collaborated with Nicholas Brady. Some items such as &quot;As pants the hart&quot; (Psalm 42) rise above the general level, and are said to be Tate&#x27;s work. A supplement was licensed in 1703 that included the Christmas carol &quot;While shepherds watched their flocks&quot;, one of a number of hymns by Tate.

Of his numerous poems, the most original is &quot;Panacea, a poem on Tea&quot; (1700). In spite of his consistent Toryism, he succeeded Thomas Shadwell as poet laureate in 1692. His poems were sharply criticised by Alexander Pope in &quot;The Dunciad&quot;.

==Modern stagings==

In 1985, the Riverside Shakespeare Company of New York City staged Tate&#x27;s &quot;History of King Lear&quot;, directed by W. Stuart McDowell at The Shakespeare Center. Musical interludes were sung by cast members during the act breaks, accompanied by a harpsichord in the orchestra pit. In the summer of 2021, the Tate version of King Lear was performed by the NY Classical Theatre in four New York City outdoor locations.
