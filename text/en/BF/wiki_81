<text>The Smart Personal Objects Technology (SPOT) is a discontinued initiative by Microsoft to create intelligent and personal home appliances, consumer electronics, and other objects through new hardware capabilities and software features.

Development of SPOT began as an incubation project initiated by the Microsoft Research division. SPOT was first announced by Bill Gates at the COMDEX computer exposition event in 2002, and additional details were revealed by Microsoft at the 2003 Consumer Electronics Show where Gates demonstrated a set of prototype smartwatches—the first type of device that would support the technology. Unlike more recent technologies, SPOT did not use more traditional forms of connectivity, such as 3G or Wi-Fi, but relied on FM broadcasting subcarrier transmission as a method of data distribution.

While several types of electronics would eventually support the technology throughout its lifecycle, SPOT was considered a commercial failure. Reasons that have been cited for its failure include its subscription-based business model, support limited to North America, the emergence of more efficient and popular forms of data distribution, and mobile feature availability that surpasses the features that SPOT offered.

==History==

===Development===
Development of SPOT began as an incubation project led by Microsoft engineer, Bill Mitchell, and initiated by the Microsoft Research division. Mitchell would enlist the help of Larry Karr, president of SCA Data Systems, to develop the project. Karr had previously worked in the 1980s to develop technology for Atari that would distribute games in a manner distinct from the company&#x27;s competitors; Karr proposed FM broadcasting subcarrier transmission as a method of distribution, technology which would also be used by Microsoft&#x27;s SPOT. Microsoft Research and SCA Data Systems would ultimately develop the DirectBand subcarrier technology for SPOT. National Semiconductor would aid in the development of device chipsets, which would feature an ARM7 CPU and ROM, SRAM, and a 100 MHz RF receiver chip.

SPOT was unveiled by Bill Gates at the annual COMDEX computer exposition event in fall of 2002. Gates stated that &quot;new devices and technologies will help bring about the next computing revolution&quot; and demonstrated refrigerator magnets that displayed the current time and sports scores, and an alarm clock that could display a list of upcoming appointments, traffic updates, and weather forecasts.
At the Consumer Electronics Show of 2003, Microsoft announced that wristwatches would be the first type of device to utilize the technology in a partnership with watch manufacturers Citizen Watch Co., Fossil, and Suunto. Bill Gates also demonstrated a set of prototype smart watches. SPOT was not Microsoft&#x27;s first foray into the smartwatch business—the company previously co-developed the Timex Datalink with Timex in 1994. During CES, Microsoft claimed that the first SPOT-based smartwatches would be released in the fall of that year; the company would also release a promotional video that displayed an estimated delivery time of fall 2003, but the first devices would be delayed until the beginning of 2004.

At the Windows Hardware Engineering Conference of 2003, Gates unveiled a new set of hardware-based navigational controls codenamed XEEL, designed to create a consistent navigation experience across Windows-based devices, such as smart phones, tablet PCs, and those powered by SPOT. Microsoft intended for XEEL to create a consistent navigation experience across hardware devices that equaled the software interface navigation consistency introduced by the mouse scroll wheel.

In June 2003, Microsoft unveiled its MSN Direct wireless service developed specifically for SPOT, which would be made available across North America. The company stated that the service would enable the delivery of personalized information on devices and, as an example of this functionality, would allow users to receive messages sent from MSN Messenger or calendar appointment reminders from Microsoft Outlook. MSN Direct would use a subscription-based business model, available through monthly or yearly service plans. MSN Direct relied on the DirectBand subcarrier technology developed by Microsoft in conjunction with SCA Data Systems.

===Release===
The first devices to make use of SPOT were released in 2004 by Fossil and Suunto. Tissot would later introduce the first compatible watch to feature a touchscreen, and Swatch would release the first compatible watch, largely tailored towards younger consumers. As smartwatches were the first type of devices to make use of the technology, they became the &quot;de facto&quot; type of device that represented it.

In 2006, Oregon Scientific released the second type of SPOT device, a weather station that displayed regional weather forecasts and other various types of information. A second generation of smartwatches was also released, and were designed to address the shortcomings observed in first generation models. Later that year, Melitta released the third type of device to utilize the technology: a coffee maker that displayed weather forecasts on an electronic visual display. Garmin released the first SPOT-compatible GPS navigation units in 2007.

In early 2008, Microsoft announced that MSN Direct would be available for Windows Mobile, and in early 2009, the service would receive additional location-based enhancements.

===Discontinuation===
Production of SPOT watches ceased in 2008. In 2009, Microsoft announced that it would discontinue the MSN Direct service at the beginning of 2012. The company stated that this decision was due to decreased demand for the service and because of the emergence of more efficient and popular forms of data distribution, such as Wi-Fi. The MSN Direct service continued to support existing SPOT devices until transmissions ceased on January 1, 2012.

==Overview==
SPOT extended functionality of traditional devices to include features not originally envisaged for them; a SPOT-powered coffeemaker, for example, would be able to display information such as weather forecasts on an electronic visual display. Smartwatches featured digital watch displays, referred to as &quot;Channels&quot;, that presented information in a manner that could be customized by a user—a user could also specify the default channel to be displayed; this feature was functionally analogous with a home screen commonly seen in mobile operating systems. Additional channels could be downloaded from a specialized website, and a &quot;Glance&quot; feature would allow a user to cycle through downloaded information.

Manufacturers could also add their own features to SPOT-based devices; as an example, a manufacturer could create its own smartwatch channel in order to distinguish its product from a competitor&#x27;s product. Each SPOT-based device included a unique identification number used to enable secure authentication and encryption of DirectBand signals. Microsoft also reportedly considered an alarm function for SPOT-based smartwatches that would activate in the event of theft.

SPOT relied on the .NET Micro Framework for the creation and management of embedded device firmware. This technology would later be used for the Windows SideShow feature introduced in Windows Vista, which shares design similarities with SPOT. In 2007, five years after SPOT was announced, Microsoft released the first software development kit for the .NET Micro Framework.

<doc id="304718" wikidata="Q1365032" url="?curid=304718" title="Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee">
<text>The Archdiocese of Milwaukee () is a Latin Church ecclesiastical territory, or archdiocese, of the Catholic Church in southeast Wisconsin in the United States. The Archdiocese of Milwaukee is the metropolitan see of the ecclesiastical province of Milwaukee. It includes the suffragan dioceses of Green Bay, La Crosse, Madison, and Superior.

It was formed in 1843, with territory taken from the Diocese of Detroit. It was elevated from a diocese to an archdiocese in 1875. In 2011, the sexual abuse scandal in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee resulted in its filing for bankruptcy.

Pope Francis named Jeffrey S. Grob as archbishop on November 4, 2024.

== Territory ==
The Archdiocese of Milwaukee encompasses the City of Milwaukee along with the following counties:

Dodge, Fond du Lac, Kenosha, Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Racine, Sheboygan, Walworth, Washington and Waukesha.

==History==

=== 1630 to 1800 ===
The first Catholic presence in present-day Wisconsin was that of French Catholic missionaries in the Green Bay area in the 17th century. When French explorer Jean Nicolet entered the Green Bay areas in 1634, he was followed by Jesuit missionaries. Wisconsin became part of the French colony of New France.

Reverend Claude-Jean Allouez celebrated Mass with a Native American tribe near present-day Oconto in December 1669, the feast of St. Francis Xavier. He established the St. Francis Xavier Mission there. The mission moved to Red Banks for a short time in 1671, and then to De Pere, where it remained until 1687, when it was burned. The missionaries worked with the Fox, Sauk, and Winnebago tribes, protected by Fort Francis near Green Bay. When the fort was destroyed in 1728, the missionaries left the area.

When the French and Indian War ended in 1763, the British took control of the Wisconsin area. During the 18th century, the few Catholics in Wisconsin were governed by the Diocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas, based in New Orleans. After the American Revolution ended in 1791, the new United States took over Wisconsin.

=== 1800 to 1843 ===

Catholic jurisdiction for the new Wisconsin Territory passed to the Diocese of Bardstown in 1808, then the Diocese of Cincinnati in 1826. The first new Catholic church in the Wisconsin area in over 100 years was constructed in Fort Howard in 1825. Its parishioners included many French Canadians living in the settlement.

In 1833, the new Diocese of Detroit assumed jurisdiction over the area. In 1837, the missionary Reverend Florimund J. Bonduel traveled from Green Bay to visit the French fur trader Solomon Juneau in Milwaukee. While in Milwaukee, Bonduel celebrated the first mass in that city.

Later in 1837, the Diocese of Detroit sent Reverend Patrick Kelly to Milwaukee to serve as its first resident priest. Kelly celebrated mass in the Milwaukee courthouse until 1839, when he opened St. Peter&#x27;s, the first Catholic church in the city. In 1841, Coadjutor Bishop Pierre-Paul Lefevere of Detroit visited Milwaukee.

=== 1843 to 1875 ===
In November 1843, Pope Gregory XVI erected the Diocese of Milwaukee, taking its territory from the Diocese of Detroit. The new diocese covered all of the Wisconsin Territory, including part of present-day Minnesota. The pope named Reverend John Henni from the Diocese of Cincinnati as the first bishop of Milwaukee.

When Henni took office, he only had four priests ministering to a few Catholics immigrants from Germany and Ireland. The only church in the diocese was St. Peter&#x27;s, which was deeply in debt. Henni in 1845 founded St. Francis Seminary, allowing the seminarians to stay in his residence. He also brought several orders of nuns and priests to Milwaukee.

In 1846, Henni completed Old St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Milwaukee, the second Catholic church in Milwaukee. Designed by architect Victor Schulte in the Zopfstil style, St. Mary&#x27;s was built to serve German immigrants. The Annunciation altarpiece in St. Mary&#x27;s, painted by Franz Xavier Glink was donated to the diocese by King Ludwig I of Bavaria. In 1847, Henni laid the foundation of the new cathedral, St. John the Evangelist. Also designed by Schulte, the cathedral was built with Cream City brick that was fabricated locally. St. John the Evangelist was consecrated by Archbishop Gaetano Bedini, the papal nuncio of the United States, in 1853.

In 1850, Pope Pius IX erected the Diocese of St. Paul, taking Minnesota from the Diocese of Milwaukee. In 1866, the same pope erected the Dioceses of La Crosse and Green Bay, removing their territories from the Diocese of Milwaukee.

=== 1875 to 1889 ===
In 1875, Pius IX elevated the Diocese of Milwaukee to the Archdiocese of Milwaukee, with Henni as first archbishop. In 1880, Bishop Michael Heiss of La Crosse was appointed coadjutor archbishop of Milwaukee by Pope Leo XIII to assist Henni. Heiss served as pastor of St. Mary&#x27;s and rector of St. Francis Seminary. At Saint Francis, Heiss trained German-speaking priests to serve German Catholics of the archdiocese. In one of his last acts, Henni oversaw the opening of Marquette University in Milwaukee in August 1881. After Henni died two days later, Heiss automatically became the next archbishop of Milwaukee.

=== 1889 to 1903 ===

In 1889, the Wisconsin Legislature passed the Bennett Law which required all primary and secondary schools in the state to teach major subjects in English. The law was bitterly resented by German-American communities, both Catholic and Lutheran, that ran schools teaching in German. It was also opposed by Polish and Norwegian communities in Wisconsin. However, there was less opposition from Irish Catholics. The law was endorsed and promoted by the anti-Catholic American Protective Association. Heiss unsuccessfully fought the measure.

After Heiss died in 1890, Leo XIII named Bishop Frederick Katzer as the next archbishop of Milwaukee. At the beginning of Katzer&#x27;s tenure in 1891, the archdiocese contained 227 priests, 268 churches, and 125 parochial schools to serve a Catholics population of 180,000.

Katzer strongly opposed the Bennett law. The outpouring of anti-Catholic sentiment from the law&#x27;s supporters soon moved Irish Catholics against it. A prominent Irish newspaper, the &quot;Catholic Citizen&quot;, labeled the Bennett Law a convergence of &quot;all the sectarian, bigoted, fanatical and crazy impurities&quot; within the Republican Party which had taken the reins of power. When the Democratic Party regained power in Wisconsin, it repealed the Bennett Law in 1891.

=== 1903 to 1940 ===

When Katzer died in 1903, there were 329 priests, 321 churches, 148 parochial schools, and 280,861 Catholics in the archdiocese. Leo XIII replaced Katzer in 1903 with Bishop Sebastian Messmer of Green Bay. In 1921, he prohibited Catholic children in Milwaukee from participating in a Fourth of July pilgrim pageant, which he described as &quot;exclusively a glorification of the Protestant pilgrims,&quot; but later withdrew his objections. Messmer drew criticism from Polish Catholics after condemning the &quot;Kuryer Polski&quot; newspaper in Milwaukee.

During his 26-year tenure, Messmer established Mount Mary College in Milwaukee and saw the elevation of Marquette College to Marquette University. He actively supported the American Federation of Catholic Societies as well as ministries for African American and Hispanic Catholics. Nearly 30 religious orders were founded in the archdiocese and charitable institutions were doubled during his administration. He founded the &quot;Catholic Herald&quot;, the official newspaper of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee, in 1922. Messmer died in 1930.

Following Messmer&#x27;s death in 1930, Pope Pius XI that same year named Bishop Samuel Stritch from the Diocese of Toledo as fifth archbishop of Milwaukee. A fire partially destroyed the Cathedral of John the Evangelist in 1935. Stritch was an advocate for Catholic Action and the Catholic Youth Organization. An opponent of the controversial Charles Coughlin, he once wrote a letter to a Milwaukee rabbi in which he rebuked those who &quot;gain and hold a popular audience, degrade themselves and abuse the trust reposed in them by misquoting, half-quoting, and actually insinuating half-truths.&quot; In 1939, Stritch was appointed archbishop of the Archdiocese of Chicago.

=== 1940 to 1977 ===

Pope Pius XII in 1940 appointed Bishop Moses E. Kiley of the Diocese of Trenton as the next archbishop of Milwaukee. Kiley oversaw an extensive renovation of the fire-damaged Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist, which reopened in 1942. He also rebuilt the St. Aemillian Orphanage in Milwaukee, which had also suffered major fire damage in the 1930s. Kiley renovated St. Francis Seminary, converted Pio Nono High School in St. Francis into a minor seminary, and created a Catholic Family Life Bureau in 1948. Kiley died in 1953.

Bishop Albert Meyer of the Diocese of Superior was appointed archbishop of Milwaukee by Pius XII in 1953. Five years later, in 1958, he became archbishop of Chicago. Pope John XXIII then named Bishop William Cousins from the Diocese of Peoria as the next archbishop of Milwaukee. During the American civil rights movement, Cousins was pressured to respond to the activities of Reverend James Groppi, an activist priest who led several civil rights marches and protests. In 1967, Cousins expressed his support for open housing and Groppi&#x27;s other objectives, triggering a backlash from some Catholics in the archdiocese.

In 1971, Cousins sold a 180-acre tract of archdiocesan land to a commercial developer. Facing opposition for the move, he cited the need to finance programs for the poor in the face of a $4 million debt. After the archdiocese refused several requests from Groppi to be assigned to an African-American parish, he resigned from the priesthood in 1976. Cousins retired in 1977 after 35 years as archbishop of Milwaukee.

=== 1977 to present ===

In 1977, Pope Paul VI appointed Reverend Rembert Weakland, abbot primate of the Benedictine Confederation, as archbishop of Milwaukee. One of Weakland&#x27;s first actions was to sell the suburban home where his predecessor had lived and move to the cathedral rectory. Weakland gave support for the Milwaukee AIDS Project. Amidst abortion controversies, Weakland participated in public &quot;listening sessions&quot;, encouraging Catholic women to share their views on the issue.

In early 2002, Weakland submitted his resignation as archbishop to the Vatican. While Weakland was waiting for his resignation to be accepted, the news media in May 2002 reported that the archdiocese had paid a $450,000 settlement in 1998 to Paul Marcoux, a former seminarian. In 1979, Marcoux had told church authorities about his long-term relationship with Weakland. Weakland publicly admitted to the affair after the story broke and apologized during a church service. Later in May, the Vatican accepted Weakland&#x27;s resignation.

The next archbishop of Milwaukee was Auxiliary Bishop Timothy M. Dolan of St. Louis, named by John Paul II in 2001. Dolan took a special interest in priests and vocations, and the number of seminary enrollments rose during his tenure. In 2009, Dolan was appointed archbishop of New York. To replace Dolan, Pope Benedict XVI named Bishop Jerome E. Listecki of La Crosse in 2009. The archdiocese filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2011 after it failed to reach a settlement with two dozen victims of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy.&quot;

In March 2023, Listecki removed the right to hear confession and give absolution from Reverend James Connell, a retired archdiocesan priest. In an opinion article in &quot;USA Today&quot;, Connell had expressed support for a proposed Delaware law that would invalidate the clergy-penitent privilege in cases that involved sexual abuse. Listecki accused Connell of spreading false information about the sacrament of confession.

As of 2023, Listecki is the archbishop of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee.

On January 14, 2025, Jeffrey Grob, formerly an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Chicago, was installed as the new Archbishop of Milwaukee.

===Sexual abuse scandal===

A 2003 report released by the Wisconsin Senate listed 58 priests from the Archdiocese of Milwaukee with credible accusations of sexual abuse of children. In the report, Archbishop Weakland admitted allowing priests guilty of child sex abuse to continue in ministry without warning parishioners or alerting the police. Weakland stated in his 2009 autobiography that in the early years of the sexual abuse scandal, he did not understand that child sexual abuse was a crime.

In July 2011, the archdiocese launched &quot;a national advertising campaign to notify sex abuse victims of their deadline to file claims. As of early 2012, approximately 550 people were asking for restitution for alleged sexual abuse by clergy in the archdiocese. It paid financial settlements to claimants funded &quot;through various sources, including insurance, loans and the sale of property&quot;, and funds were set aside to pay for therapy.

In June 2012 it was revealed that Dolan &quot;authorized payments of as much as $20,000 to sexually abusive priests as an incentive for them to agree to dismissal from the priesthood when he was the archbishop of Milwaukee&quot; and that &quot;the archdiocese did make such payments... thereby allowing the church to remove them from the payroll.&quot;

In March 2019, the archdiocese announced that it would remove the names of Cousins and Weakland from buildings in the archdiocese due to their poor handling of sex abuse cases. The archdiocese in June 2021 announced that it would only cooperate with an investigation by Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul as far as sexual abuse allegations against living priests. Archbishop Listecki refused to participate in investigations of deceased priests, terming it anti-Catholic bigotry.

==Demographics==
As of 2017, the Archdiocese of Milwaukee had a membership of 591,890 Catholics in 198 parishes, representing the most heavily Catholic region of the state. There were 322 diocesan priests, 370 religious priests, and 147 permanent deacons. The religious orders included 82 brothers and 994 women religious.

The archdiocese houses one provincial seminary (St. Francis de Sales Seminary) educating 56 seminarians. It oversees 94 elementary schools, 13 high schools, and five colleges and universities. Also included in the archdiocese are 12 Catholic hospitals and nine Catholic cemeteries.

==Bishops==

<doc id="304719" wikidata="Q849760" url="?curid=304719" title="Chinese classifier">
<text>The modern Chinese varieties make frequent use of what are called classifiers or measure words. One use of classifiers is when a noun is qualified by a numeral or demonstrative. In the Chinese equivalent of a phrase such as &quot;three books&quot; or &quot;that person&quot;, it is normally necessary to insert an appropriate classifier between the numeral/demonstrative and the noun. For example, in Standard Chinese, the first of these phrases would be:

When a noun stands alone without any determiner, no classifier is needed. There are also various other uses of classifiers: for example, when placed after a noun rather than before it, or when repeated, a classifier signifies a plural or indefinite quantity.

The terms &quot;classifier&quot; and &quot;measure word&quot; are frequently used interchangeably and as equivalents of the Chinese term (). However, the two are sometimes distinguished, with &quot;classifier&quot; denoting a particle without any particular meaning of its own, as in the example above, and &quot;measure word&quot; denoting a word for a particular quantity or measurement of something, such as &#x27;drop&#x27;, &#x27;cupful&#x27;, or &#x27;liter&#x27;. The latter type also includes certain words denoting lengths of time, units of currency, etc. These two types are alternatively called &quot;count-classifier&quot; and &quot;mass-classifier&quot;, since the first type can only meaningfully be used with count nouns, while the second is used particularly with mass nouns. However, the grammatical behavior of words of the two types is largely identical.

Most nouns have one or more particular classifiers associated with them, often depending on the nature of the things they denote. For example, many nouns denoting flat objects such as tables, papers, beds, and benches use the classifier , whereas many long and thin objects use . The total number of classifiers in Chinese may be put at anywhere from a few dozen to several hundred, depending on how they are counted. The classifier , pronounced or in Standard Chinese, apart from being the standard classifier for many nouns, also serves as a &quot;general classifier&quot;, which may often be used in place of other classifiers; in informal and spoken language, native speakers tend to use this classifier far more than any other, even though they know which classifier is &quot;correct&quot; when asked. Mass-classifiers might be used with all sorts of nouns with which they make sense: for example,   &#x27;box&#x27; may be used to denote boxes of objects, such as light bulbs or books, even though those nouns would be used with their own appropriate count-classifiers if being counted as individual objects. Researchers have differing views as to how classifier–noun pairings arise: some regard them as being based on innate semantic features of the noun (for example, all nouns denoting &quot;long&quot; objects take a certain classifier because of their inherent length), while others see them as motivated more by analogy to prototypical pairings—for example, &#x27;dictionary&#x27; comes to take the same classifier as the more common word &#x27;book&#x27;. There is some variation in the pairings used, with speakers of different dialects often using different classifiers for the same item. Some linguists have proposed that the use of classifier phrases may be guided less by grammar and more by stylistic or pragmatic concerns on the part of a speaker who may be trying to foreground new or important information.

Many other languages of the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area exhibit similar classifier systems, leading to speculation about the origins of the Chinese system. Ancient classifier-like constructions, which used a repeated noun rather than a special classifier, are attested in Old Chinese as early as 1400 BCE, but true classifiers did not appear in these phrases until much later. Originally, classifiers and numbers came after the noun rather than before, and probably moved before the noun sometime after 500 BCE. The use of classifiers did not become a mandatory part of Old Chinese grammar until around 1100 CE. Some nouns became associated with specific classifiers earlier than others; the earliest probably being nouns that signified culturally valued items such as horses and poems. Many words that are classifiers today started out as full nouns; in some cases their meanings have been gradually bleached away so that they are now used only as classifiers.

==Usage==
In Chinese, a numeral cannot usually quantify a noun by itself; instead, the language relies on classifiers, commonly also referred to as measure words. When a noun is preceded by a number, a demonstrative such as &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot;, or certain quantifiers such as &quot;every&quot;, a classifier must normally be inserted before the noun. Thus, while English speakers say &quot;one person&quot; or &quot;this person&quot;, Mandarin Chinese speakers say respectively:



If a noun is preceded by both a demonstrative and a number, the demonstrative comes first. (This is just as in English, e.g. &quot;these three cats&quot;.) If an adjective modifies the noun, it typically comes after the classifier and before the noun. The general structure of a classifier phrase is

The tables below give examples of common types of classifier phrases. While most English nouns do not require classifiers or measure words (in English, both “five dogs” and “five cups of coffee” are grammatically correct), nearly all Chinese nouns do; thus, in the first table, phrases that have no classifier in English have one in Chinese.

On the other hand, when a noun is not counted or introduced with a demonstrative, a classifier is not necessary: for example, there is a classifier in
but not in
Furthermore, numbers and demonstratives are often not required in Chinese, so speakers may choose not to use one—and thus not to use a classifier. For example, to say &quot;Zhang San turned into a tree&quot;, both are acceptable: The use of classifiers after demonstratives is in fact optional.


It is also possible for a classifier alone to qualify a noun, the numeral being omitted, as in
===Specialized uses===
In addition to their uses with numbers and demonstratives, classifiers have some other functions. A classifier placed after a noun expresses a plural or indefinite quantity of it. For example:

whereas the standard pre-nominal construction
Many classifiers may be reduplicated to mean &#x27;every&#x27;. For example:

A classifier used along with 一 ( &#x27;one&#x27;) and after a noun conveys a meaning close to &#x27;all of&#x27; or &#x27;the entire&#x27; or &#x27;a ___full of&#x27;. This sentence uses the classifier  ( &#x27;slice&#x27;), which refers to the sky, not the clouds.

Classifiers may also indicate possession. For example, the Standard Chinese equivalent of &#x27;my book&#x27; would often be  (), but in Cantonese this would typically be expressed as

with the classifier serving as a possessive marker roughly equivalent to English &quot;s&quot;.

== Types ==
The vast majority of classifiers are those that count or classify nouns (&quot;nominal classifiers&quot;, as in all the examples given so far, as opposed to &quot;verbal classifiers&quot;). These are further subdivided into &quot;count-classifiers&quot; and &quot;mass-classifiers&quot;, described below. In everyday speech, people often use the term &quot;measure word&quot;, or its literal Chinese equivalent  , to cover all Chinese count-classifiers and mass-classifiers, but the types of words grouped under this term are not all the same. Specifically, the various types of classifiers exhibit numerous differences in meaning, in the kinds of words they attach to, and in syntactic behavior.

Chinese has a large number of nominal classifiers; estimates of the number in Mandarin range from &quot;several dozen&quot; or &quot;about 50&quot;, to over 900. The range is so large because some of these estimates include all types of classifiers while others include only count-classifiers, and because the idea of what constitutes a &quot;classifier&quot; has changed over time. Today, regular dictionaries include 120 to 150 classifiers; the 8822-word &quot;Syllabus of Graded Words and Characters for Chinese Proficiency&quot; () lists 81; and a 2009 list compiled by Gao Ming and Barbara Malt includes 126. The number of classifiers that are in everyday, informal use, however, may be lower: linguist Mary Erbaugh has claimed that about two dozen &quot;core classifiers&quot; account for most classifier use. As a whole, though, the classifier system is so complex that specialized classifier dictionaries have been published.

===Count-classifiers and mass-classifiers===
Within the set of nominal classifiers, linguists generally draw a distinction between &quot;count-classifiers&quot; and &quot;mass-classifiers&quot;. True &quot;count-classifiers&quot; are used for naming or counting a single count noun, and have no direct translation in English; for example:

Furthermore, count-classifiers cannot be used with mass nouns: just as an English speaker cannot ordinarily say *&quot;five muds&quot;, a Chinese speaker cannot say

For such mass nouns, one must use &quot;mass-classifiers&quot;.

Mass-classifiers (true measure words) do not pick out inherent properties of an individual noun like count-classifiers do; rather, they lump nouns into countable units. Thus, mass-classifiers can generally be used with multiple types of nouns; for example, while the mass-classifier  (, box) can be used to count boxes of lightbulbs or of books



each of these nouns must use a different count-classifier when being counted by itself.



While count-classifiers have no direct English translation, mass-classifiers often do:



All languages, including English, have mass-classifiers, but count-classifiers are unique to certain &quot;classifier languages&quot;, and are not a part of English grammar apart from a few exceptional cases such as head of livestock.

Within the range of mass-classifiers, authors have proposed subdivisions based on the manner in which a mass-classifier organizes the noun into countable units. One of these is &quot;measurement units&quot; (also called &quot;standard measures&quot;), which all languages must have in order to measure items; this category includes units such as kilometers, liters, or pounds (see list). Like other classifiers, these can also stand without a noun. Units of currency behave similarly.

Other proposed types of mass-classifiers include
* &quot;collective&quot; mass-classifiers, which group things less precisely

* &quot;container&quot; mass-classifiers which group things by containers they come in


The difference between count-classifiers and mass-classifiers can be described as one of quantifying versus categorizing: in other words, mass-classifiers &quot;create&quot; a unit by which to measure something (i.e. boxes, groups, chunks, pieces, etc.), whereas count-classifiers simply &quot;name&quot; an existing item. Most words can appear with both count-classifiers and mass-classifiers; for example, pizza can be described both using a count-classifier and using a mass-classifier.



In addition to these semantic differences, there are differences in the grammatical behaviors of count-classifiers and mass-classifiers; for example, mass-classifiers may be modified by a small set of adjectives, as in:

Whereas count-classifiers usually may not. For example, this is never said:

Instead the adjective must modify the noun:

Another difference is that count-classifiers may often be replaced by a &quot;general&quot; classifier (), &quot;gè&quot; with no apparent change in meaning, whereas mass-classifiers may not. Syntacticians Lisa Cheng and Rint Sybesma propose that count-classifiers and mass-classifiers have different underlying syntactic structures, with count-classifiers forming &quot;classifier phrases&quot;, and mass-classifiers being a sort of relative clause that only &quot;looks&quot; like a classifier phrase. The distinction between count-classifiers and mass-classifiers is often unclear, however, and other linguists have suggested that count-classifiers and mass-classifiers may not be fundamentally different. They posit that &quot;count-classifier&quot; and &quot;mass-classifier&quot; are the extremes of a continuum, with most classifiers falling somewhere in between.

===Verbal classifiers===

There is a set of &quot;verbal classifiers&quot; used specifically for counting the number of times an action occurs, rather than counting a number of items; this set includes &quot;cì&quot;, / &quot;biàn&quot;, &quot;huí&quot;, and &quot;xià&quot;, which all roughly translate to &quot;times&quot;. For example:

These words can also form compound classifiers with certain nouns, as in &quot;rén cì&quot; &quot;person-time&quot;, which can be used to count (for example) visitors to a museum in a year (where visits by the same person on different occasions are counted separately).

Another type of verbal classifier indicates the tool or implement used to perform the action. An example is found in the sentence:

The word &quot;jiǎo&quot;, which usually serves as a simple noun meaning &quot;foot&quot;, here functions as a verbal classifier reflecting the tool (namely the foot) used to perform the kicking action.

==Relation to nouns==

Different classifiers often correspond to different particular nouns. For example, books generally take the classifier  , flat objects take  () , animals take  () , machines take  , and large buildings and mountains take  . Within these categories are further subdivisions—while most animals take  () , domestic animals take  () , long and flexible animals take  () , and horses take  . Likewise, while long things that are flexible (such as ropes) often take  () , long things that are rigid (such as sticks) take  , unless they are also round (like pens or cigarettes), in which case in some dialects they take  . Classifiers also vary in how specific they are; some (such as   for flowers and other similarly clustered items) are generally only used with one type, whereas others (such as  ()  for long and flexible things, one-dimensional things, or abstract items like news reports) are much less restricted. Furthermore, there is not a one-to-one relationship between nouns and classifiers: the same noun may be paired with different classifiers in different situations. The specific factors that govern which classifiers are paired with which nouns have been a subject of debate among linguists.

===Categories and prototypes===
While mass-classifiers do not necessarily bear any semantic relationship to the noun with which they are used (e.g. &quot;box&quot; and &quot;book&quot; are not related in meaning, but one can still say &quot;a box of books&quot;), count-classifiers do. The precise nature of that relationship, however, is not certain, since there is so much variability in how objects may be organized and categorized by classifiers. Accounts of the semantic relationship may be grouped loosely into &quot;categorical&quot; theories, which propose that count-classifiers are matched to objects solely on the basis of inherent features of those objects (such as length or size), and &quot;prototypical&quot; theories, which propose that people learn to match a count-classifier to a specific prototypical object and to other objects that are like that prototype.

The categorical, &quot;classical&quot; view of classifiers was that each classifier represents a category with a set of conditions; for example, the classifier  () &quot;tiáo&quot; would represent a category defined as all objects that meet the conditions of being long, thin, and one-dimensional—and nouns using that classifier must fit all the conditions with which the category is associated. Some common semantic categories into which count-classifiers have been claimed to organize nouns include the categories of shape (long, flat, or round), size (large or small), consistency (soft or hard), animacy (human, animal, or object), and function (tools, vehicles, machines, etc.).

On the other hand, proponents of prototype theory propose that count-classifiers may not have innate definitions, but are associated with a noun that is prototypical of that category, and nouns that have a &quot;family resemblance&quot; with the prototype noun will want to use the same classifier. For example, &quot;horse&quot; in Chinese uses the classifier  &quot;pǐ&quot;, as in:

In modern Chinese the word has no meaning. Nevertheless, nouns denoting animals that look like horses will often also use this same classifier, and native speakers have been found to be more likely to use the classifier the closer an animal looks to a horse. Furthermore, words that do not meet the &quot;criteria&quot; of a semantic category may still use that category because of their association with a prototype. For example, the classifier  () &quot;kē&quot; is used for small round items, as in:

When words like  (&quot;yuánzǐdàn&quot;, &quot;atomic bomb&quot;) were later introduced into the language they also used this classifier (颗 [顆] kē), even though they are not small and round—therefore, their classifier must have been assigned because of the words&#x27; association with the word for bullet, which acted as a &quot;prototype&quot;. This is an example of &quot;generalization&quot; from prototypes: Erbaugh has proposed that when children learn count-classifiers, they go through stages, first learning a classifier-noun pair only, such as

then using that classifier with multiple nouns that are similar to the prototype (such as other types of fish), then finally using that set of nouns to generalize a semantic feature associated with the classifier (such as length and flexibility) so that the classifier can then be used with new words that the person encounters.

Some classifier-noun pairings are arbitrary, or at least appear to modern speakers to have no semantic motivation. For instance, the classifier  &quot;bù&quot; may be used for movies and novels, but also for cars and telephones. Some of this arbitrariness may be due to what linguist James Tai refers to as &quot;fossilization&quot;, whereby a count-classifier loses its meaning through historical changes but remains paired with some nouns. For example, the classifier  &quot;pǐ&quot; used for horses is meaningless today, but in Classical Chinese may have referred to a &quot;team of two horses&quot;, a pair of horse skeletons, or the pairing between man and horse. Arbitrariness may also arise when a classifier is borrowed, along with its noun, from a dialect in which it has a clear meaning to one in which it does not. In both these cases, the use of the classifier is remembered more by association with certain &quot;prototypical&quot; nouns (such as &quot;horse&quot;) rather than by understanding of semantic categories, and thus arbitrariness has been used as an argument in favor of the prototype theory of classifiers. Gao and Malt propose that both the category and prototype theories are correct: in their conception, some classifiers constitute &quot;well-defined categories&quot;, others make &quot;prototype categories&quot;, and still others are relatively arbitrary.

===Neutralization===
In addition to the numerous &quot;specific&quot; count-classifiers described above, Chinese has a &quot;general classifier&quot; (), pronounced in Standard Chinese. This classifier is used for people, some abstract concepts, and other words that do not have special classifiers (such as &#x27;hamburger&#x27;), and may also be used as a replacement for a specific classifier such as  ()  or  () , especially in informal speech. In Mandarin Chinese, it has been noted as early as the 1940s that the use of is increasing and that there is a general tendency towards replacing specific classifiers with it. Numerous studies have reported that both adults and children tend to use when they do not know the appropriate count-classifier, and even when they do but are speaking quickly or informally. The replacement of a specific classifier with the general is known as classifier &quot;neutralization&quot; ( in Chinese, literally &#x27;classifier -ization&#x27;). This occurs especially often among children and aphasics (individuals with damage to language-relevant areas of the brain), although normal speakers also neutralize frequently. It has been reported that most speakers know the appropriate classifiers for the words they are using and believe, when asked, that those classifiers are obligatory, but nevertheless use without even realizing it in actual speech. As a result, in everyday spoken Mandarin the general classifier is &quot;hundreds of times more frequent&quot; than the specialized ones.

Nevertheless, has not completely replaced other count-classifiers, and there are still many situations in which it would be inappropriate to substitute it for the required specific classifier. There may be specific patterns behind which classifier-noun pairs may be &quot;neutralized&quot; to use the general classifier, and which may not. Specifically, words that are most prototypical for their categories, such as &quot;paper&quot; for the category of nouns taking the &#x27;flatsquare&#x27; classifier  () , may be less likely to be said with a general classifier.

===Variation in usage===

It is not the case that every noun is only associated with one classifier. Across dialects and speakers there is great variability in the way classifiers are used for the same words, and speakers often do not agree which classifier is best. For example, for cars some people use  , others use  , and still others use  () ; Cantonese uses  . Even within a single dialect or a single speaker, the same noun may take different measure words depending on the style in which the person is speaking, or on different nuances the person wants to convey (for instance, measure words can reflect the speaker&#x27;s judgment of or opinion about the object). An example of this is the word for person,  , which uses the measure word  ()  normally, but uses the measure   when counting number of people in a household,   when being particularly polite or honorific, and   in formal written contexts; likewise, a group of people may be referred to by massifiers:



The first is neutral, whereas the second implies that the people are unruly or otherwise being judged poorly.

Some count-classifiers may also be used with nouns that they are not normally related to, for metaphorical effect, as in:

Finally, a single word may have multiple count-classifiers that convey different meanings altogether—in fact, the choice of a classifier can even influence the meaning of a noun. By way of illustration:



== Purpose ==
In research on classifier systems, and Chinese classifiers in particular, it has been asked why count-classifiers (as opposed to mass-classifiers) exist at all. Mass-classifiers are present in all languages since they are the only way to &quot;count&quot; mass nouns that are not naturally divided into units (for example, &quot;three of mud&quot; in English; *&quot;three muds&quot; is ungrammatical). On the other hand, count-classifiers are not mandatory, and are not present in most languages. Furthermore, count-classifiers are used with an &quot;unexpectedly low frequency&quot;; in many settings, speakers avoid specific classifiers by just using a bare noun (without a number or demonstrative) or using the general classifier  . Linguists and typologists such as Joseph Greenberg have suggested that specific count-classifiers are semantically redundant. Count-classifiers can be used stylistically, though, and can also be used to clarify or limit a speaker&#x27;s intended meaning when using a vague or ambiguous noun; for example, the noun   &#x27;class&#x27; can refer to courses in a semester or specific class periods during a day, depending on whether the classifier  ()  or  ()  is used.

One proposed explanation for the existence of count-classifiers is that they serve more of a cognitive purpose than a practical one: in other words, they provide a linguistic way for speakers to organize or categorize real objects. An alternative account is that they serve more of a discursive and pragmatic function (a communicative function when people interact) rather than an abstract function within the mind. Specifically, it has been proposed that count-classifiers might be used to mark new or unfamiliar objects within a discourse, to introduce major characters or items in a story or conversation, or to foreground important information and objects by making them bigger and more salient. In this way, count-classifiers might not serve an abstract grammatical or cognitive function, but may help in communication by making important information more noticeable and drawing attention to it.

== History ==
=== Classifier phrases ===

Historical linguists have found that phrases consisting of nouns and numbers went through several structural changes in Old Chinese and Middle Chinese before classifiers appeared in them. The earliest forms may have been &quot;Number – Noun&quot;, like English (e.g. &#x27;five horses&#x27;), and the less common &quot;Noun – Number&quot; (&#x27;horses five&#x27;), both of which are attested in the oracle bone scripts of Pre-Archaic Chinese (circa 1400 BCE to 1000 BCE). The first constructions resembling classifier constructions were &quot;Noun – Number – Noun&quot; constructions, which were also extant in Pre-Archaic Chinese but less common than &quot;Number – Noun&quot;. In these constructions, sometimes the first and second nouns were identical (&quot;N1 – Number – N1&quot;, as in &quot;horses five horses&quot;) and other times the second noun was different, but semantically related (&quot;N1 – Number – N2&quot;). According to some historical linguists, the &quot;N2&quot; in these constructions can be considered an early form of count-classifier and has even been called an &quot;echo classifier&quot;; this speculation is not universally agreed on, though. Although true count-classifiers had not appeared yet, mass-classifiers were common in this time, with constructions such as &quot;wine – six – &quot; (the word   represented a wine container) meaning &quot;six of wine&quot;. Examples such as this suggest that mass-classifiers predate count-classifiers by several centuries, although they did not appear in the same word order as they do today.

It is from this type of structure that count-classifiers may have arisen, originally replacing the second noun (in structures where there was a noun rather than a mass-classifier) to yield &quot;Noun – Number – Classifier&quot;. That is to say, constructions like &quot;horses five horses&quot; may have been replaced by ones like &quot;horses five &quot;, possibly for stylistic reasons such as avoiding repetition. Another reason for the appearance of count-classifiers may have been to avoid confusion or ambiguity that could have arisen from counting items using only mass-classifiers—i.e. to clarify when one is referring to a single item and when one is referring to a measure of items.

Historians agree that at some point in history the order of words in this construction shifted, putting the noun at the end rather than beginning, like in the present-day construction &quot;Number – Classifier – Noun&quot;. According to historical linguist Alain Peyraube, the earliest occurrences of this construction (albeit with mass-classifiers, rather than count-classifiers) appear in the late portion of Old Chinese (500 BCE to 200 BCE). At this time, the &quot;Number – Mass-classifier&quot; portion of the &quot;Noun – Number – Mass-classifier&quot; construction was sometimes shifted in front of the noun. Peyraube speculates that this may have occurred because it was gradually reanalyzed as a modifier (like an adjective) for the head noun, as opposed to a simple repetition as it originally was. Since Chinese generally places modifiers before modified, as does English, the shift may have been prompted by this reanalysis. By the early part of the Common Era, the nouns appearing in &quot;classifier position&quot; were beginning to lose their meaning and become true classifiers. Estimates of when classifiers underwent the most development vary: Wang Li claims their period of major development was during the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), whereas Liu Shiru estimates that it was the Northern and Southern dynasties period (420–589 CE), and Peyraube chooses the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE). Regardless of when they developed, Wang Lianqing claims that they did not become grammatically mandatory until sometime around the 11th century.

Classifier systems in many nearby languages and language groups (such as Vietnamese and the Tai languages) are very similar to the Chinese classifier system in both grammatical structure and the parameters along which some objects are grouped together. Thus, there has been some debate over which language family first developed classifiers and which ones then borrowed them—or whether classifier systems were native to all these languages and developed more through repeated language contact throughout history.

=== Classifier words ===
Most modern count-classifiers are derived from words that originally were free-standing nouns in older varieties of Chinese, and have since been grammaticalized to become bound morphemes. In other words, count-classifiers tend to come from words that once had specific meaning but lost it (a process known as semantic bleaching). Many, however, still have related forms that work as nouns all by themselves, such as the classifier  ()  for long, ribbon-like objects: the modern word   means &quot;ribbon&quot;. In fact, the majority of classifiers can also be used as other parts of speech, such as nouns. Mass-classifiers, on the other hand, are more transparent in meaning than count-classifiers; while the latter have some historical meaning, the former are still full-fledged nouns. For example,  (, cup), is both a classifier as in  (, &quot;a of tea&quot;) and the word for a cup as in  (, &quot;wine glass&quot;).
It was not always the case that every noun required a count-classifier. In many historical varieties of Chinese, use of classifiers was not mandatory, and classifiers are rare in writings that have survived. Some nouns acquired classifiers earlier than others; some of the first documented uses of classifiers were for inventorying items, both in mercantile business and in storytelling. Thus, the first nouns to have count-classifiers paired with them may have been nouns that represent &quot;culturally valued&quot; items such as horses, scrolls, and intellectuals. The special status of such items is still apparent today: many of the classifiers that can only be paired with one or two nouns, such as   for horses and   for songs or poems, are the classifiers for these same &quot;valued&quot; items. Such classifiers make up as much as one-third of the commonly used classifiers today.

Classifiers did not gain official recognition as a lexical category (part of speech) until the 20th century. The earliest modern text to discuss classifiers and their use was Ma Jianzhong&#x27;s 1898 &quot;Ma&#x27;s Basic Principles for Writing Clearly&quot; (). From then until the 1940s, linguists such as Ma, Wang Li, and Li Jinxi treated classifiers as just a type of noun that express a quantity. Lü Shuxiang was the first to treat them as a separate category, calling them &quot;unit words&quot; ( ) in his &quot;Outline of Chinese Grammar&quot; () published during the 1940s, and finally &#x27;measure words&#x27; ( ) in &quot;Grammar Studies&quot; (). He made this separation based on the fact that classifiers were semantically bleached, and that they can be used directly with a number, whereas true nouns need to have a measure word added before they can be used with a number. After this time, other names were also proposed for classifiers: Gao Mingkai called them &#x27;noun helper words&#x27; ( ), Lu Wangdao &#x27;counting markers&#x27; ( ). The Japanese linguist Miyawaki Kennosuke called them &#x27;accompanying words&#x27; ( ). In the adopted by the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1954, Lü&#x27;s measure words ( ) was adopted as the official name for classifiers in China. This remains the most common term in use today.

=== General classifiers ===
Historically, was not always the general classifier. Some believe it was originally a noun referring to bamboo stalks, and gradually expanded in use to become a classifier for many things with &quot;vertical, individual, [or] upright qualit[ies]&quot;, eventually becoming a general classifier because it was used so frequently with common nouns. The classifier is actually associated with three different homophonous characters: , (now the traditional-character equivalent of ), and . Historical linguist Lianqing Wang has argued that these characters actually originated from different words, and that only had the original meaning of &quot;bamboo stalk&quot;. , he claims, was used as a general classifier early on, and may have been derived from the orthographically similar  , one of the earliest general classifiers. later merged with because they were similar in pronunciation and meaning (both used as general classifiers). Likewise, he claims that was also a separate word (with a meaning having to do with &quot;partiality&quot; or &quot;being a single part&quot;), and merged with for the same reasons as did; he also argues that was &quot;created&quot;, as early as the Han dynasty, to supersede .

Historically, was the only general classifier used in Chinese. The aforementioned   was being used as a general classifier before the Qin dynasty (221BCE); it was originally a noun referring to individual items out of a string of connected shells or clothes, and eventually came to be used as a classifier for &quot;individual&quot; objects (as opposed to pairs or groups of objects) before becoming a general classifier. Another general classifier was  , which originally referred to small twigs. Since twigs were used for counting items, became a counter word: any items, including people, could be counted as &quot;one , two &quot;, etc. was the most common classifier in use during the Northern and Southern dynasties period (420–589 CE), but today is no longer a general classifier, and is only used rarely, as a specialized classifier for items such as pins and badges. Kathleen Ahrens has claimed that ( in Mandarin and in Taiwanese Hokkien), the classifier for animals in Mandarin, is another general classifier in Taiwanese and may be becoming one in the Mandarin spoken in Taiwan.

=== Topological variation ===
Northern dialects tend to have fewer classifiers than southern ones.   is the only classifier found in the Dungan language. All nouns could have just one classifier in some dialects, such as Shanghainese Wu, Jin Chinese in Shanxi, and dialects spoken in Shandong. Some dialects such as Northern Min, certain Xiang dialects, Hakka dialects, and some Yue dialects use for the noun referring to people, rather than .

<text>Richard Lee Sutcliffe (born June 21, 1956), nicknamed &quot;the Red Baron&quot;, is an American former Major League Baseball pitcher with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Cleveland Indians, Chicago Cubs, Baltimore Orioles, and St. Louis Cardinals between 1976 and 1994. Sutcliffe is currently a broadcaster for ESPN and Marquee Sports Network.

A right-hander, Sutcliffe was a three-time All-Star. He won the National League Rookie of the Year award in and the National League Cy Young Award in .

==MLB career==

===Early years and Rookie of the Year===
Sutcliffe attended Van Horn High School in Independence, Missouri where he received All-American honors as an infielder. Sutcliffe was the 21st pick in 1974 amateur draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers. Sutcliffe&#x27;s first full season in the majors was 1979. He won 17 games for the Dodgers and was the first of four consecutive Rookies of the Year for the Dodgers from 1979– (Steve Howe, Fernando Valenzuela, and Steve Sax were the others). Sutcliffe had a rough 1980 for the team; near the end of the season, he was told by Pete Rose that he&#x27;d been tipping his pitches. Sutcliffe improved in 1981, a year in which the Dodgers went on to win the World Series. Although Sutcliffe did not appear on the Dodgers&#x27; roster for their 1981 World Series championship run, he was awarded a World Series ring by the team. Sutcliffe, angry at Dodgers&#x27; manager Tommy Lasorda, whom he accused of lying to him, publicly demanded a trade. (Years later, the two reconciled.) After the season, Sutcliffe was traded, along with Jack Perconte, to the Cleveland Indians for journeyman outfielder Jorge Orta, plus Jack Fimple and Larry White.

===Chicago Cubs===
Sutcliffe won 31 games over the course of the next two seasons for Cleveland and led the American League in earned run average in . In mid-, Cleveland traded a struggling Sutcliffe to the Chicago Cubs for Mel Hall and Joe Carter. Sutcliffe rebounded and won 16 games for the Cubs while losing only one, helping them to the division championship. On October 2, 1984, he started the first game of the NLCS against the San Diego Padres, giving up two hits and no runs, not only gaining the victory, but also hitting a home run in the third inning. Five days later, Sutcliffe pitched the final game of the series at Jack Murphy Stadium, but posted the loss after giving up four runs in the seventh inning.

Sutcliffe won the Cy Young Award with a unanimous vote, beating out Dwight Gooden and Bruce Sutter. He also finished fourth in the league MVP voting. When he re-signed with the Cubs as a free agent the following year, his contract briefly made him the highest-paid pitcher in baseball.

Sutcliffe started the season strong, going 5–3 in his first eight starts, including two complete-game shutouts. A hamstring pull on May 19 limited his starts for the year, followed by a series of arm injuries which would limit Sutcliffe&#x27;s effectiveness over the next two seasons. In , he bounced back to win 18 games and finished second in the league&#x27;s Cy Young voting to Steve Bedrosian despite playing for a last-place Cubs team which also featured National League Most Valuable Player Andre Dawson. He also was presented 1987&#x27;s Roberto Clemente Award, given annually to a Major League player who demonstrates sportsmanship and community involvement.

On July 29, 1988, in Philadelphia, Sutcliffe achieved one of baseball&#x27;s rarest feats, especially for a pitcher, by stealing home plate during an 8–3 win over the Phillies, in which he also notched the victory. In , Sutcliffe won 16 games and made his final All-Star appearance, where he was managed once again by Tommy Lasorda. He also helped the Cubs to another division title, but the Cubs lost to the San Francisco Giants in the playoffs.

===Later years===
Recurring arm injuries caused Sutcliffe to miss most of the and seasons and the Cubs did not offer him a contract for the next season. Signing with the Baltimore Orioles, Sutcliffe went 16–15 and 10–10 in and , starting the first game at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. He ended his career by signing a one-year minor league contract with the St. Louis Cardinals in , going 6–4 in an injury-plagued season. He retired with a career record of 171–139, with an ERA of 4.08. He holds the unique distinction of having won each of the following league awards, once each, and each in a different season: Rookie of the Year (1979), Cy Young Award (1984), ERA leader (1982), and wins leader (1987). Sutcliffe also has the distinction of being the pitcher who faced all-time MLB home run leader Barry Bonds the most times without giving up a home run once, with 51 plate appearances between the two.

===Non-pitching statistics===
As a hitter, Sutcliffe was above average for a pitcher. He posted a .181 batting average (102-for-562) with 42 runs, 4 home runs, 55 RBI, 4 stolen bases and 34 bases on balls. He had a career-high 17 RBI in 1979 as a member of the Dodgers. In eight postseason games, he hit .500 (4-for-8) with 1 run, 1 double, 1 home run and 1 RBI.

Defensively, he was above average, recording a .973 fielding percentage which was 19 points higher than the league average at his position.

<text>The Kingsmen are a 1960s American rock band from Portland, Oregon. They are best known for their 1963 recording of R&amp;B singer Richard Berry&#x27;s &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, which held the No. 2 spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for six weeks and has become an enduring classic.

In total, the Kingsmen charted 13 singles from 1963 to 1968 and five consecutive albums from 1963 to 1966. Their first album, &quot;The Kingsmen in Person&quot;, remained on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart for 131 weeks from January 1964 to August 1966. Their early albums were released internationally in Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Mexico, South Africa, and Taiwan.

==Early years==
Lynn Easton and Jack Ely started performing at an early age in local newspaper-sponsored revues with the Journal Juniors and the Young Oregonians, respectively. In 1957, they started performing together, with Ely singing and playing guitar and Easton on the drum kit. The two teenagers had grown up together, as their parents were close friends. Easton and Ely performed at local parties and events, and soon added Mike Mitchell on guitar and Bob Nordby on bass to round out the band. They called themselves the Kingsmen, taking the name from a recently disbanded group. The Kingsmen began their collective career playing at fashion shows, Red Cross events, and supermarket promotions, generally avoiding rock songs on their setlist. In 1962, Don Gallucci, a high school freshman at the time, was recruited from another local group, the Royal Notes, to play keyboards. Their first recording effort was an unreleased acetate of an instrumental titled &quot;Peter Gunn Rock&quot;. 

==&quot;Louie Louie&quot;==
In 1962, while playing a gig at the Pypo Club in Seaside, Oregon, the band noticed Rockin&#x27; Robin Roberts&#x27;s version of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; being played on the jukebox for hours on end with the entire club dancing. Ely convinced the Kingsmen to learn the song, which they played at dances to a great crowd response. Unknown to him, he changed the beat because he misheard it on a jukebox. Ken Chase, host of radio station KISN, formed his own club to capitalize on these dance crazes. Dubbed &quot;The Chase&quot;, the Kingsmen became the club&#x27;s house band and he became the band&#x27;s manager. On April 5, 1963, Chase booked the band an hour-long session at the local Northwestern Inc. studio for the following day to record a demo tape for a summer cruise ship gig. Adding to the hurried atmosphere, the band had just played a 90-minute &quot;Louie Louie&quot; marathon the night before.

Despite the band&#x27;s annoyance at having so little time to prepare, on April 6 at 10 am the Kingsmen walked into the three-microphone recording studio. &quot;Jamaica Farewell&quot;, one partial and one full take of &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, and &quot;Haunted Castle&quot; were recorded. For &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, the only vocal number, Ely was forced to lean back and sing to a microphone suspended from the ceiling. &quot;It was more yelling than singing&quot;, Ely said, cause I was trying to be heard over all the instruments.&quot; In addition, he was wearing braces at the time of the performance, further compounding his infamously slurred words. Ely sang the beginning of the third verse two bars too early but realized his mistake and waited for the rest of the band to catch up. The Kingsmen were not proud of the recording and wanted to fix their mistakes, but Chase liked the energy and rawness and assured them that the demo version could be redone before a record was released. The one hour session cost either $36, $50, or somewhere in between and the band split the cost.

With a competing &quot;Louie Louie&quot; version from Paul Revere and the Raiders getting heavy play on a competing station, Chase began playing the Kingsmen&#x27;s demo version on his show at KISN. He then contracted with Jerry Dennon&#x27;s Jerden Records to press a single. The B-side was &quot;Haunted Castle&quot;, composed by Ely and Don Gallucci, the new keyboardist; however, Lynn Easton was credited on both the Jerden and Wand releases.

&quot;Louie Louie&quot; reached No. 1 on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; and &quot;Music Vendor&quot; charts and No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. Additionally it reached No. 1 on the CHUM Canada chart and in the UK it reached No. 26 on the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.

The band attracted nationwide attention when &quot;Louie Louie&quot; was banned by the governor of Indiana, Matthew E. Welsh, also attracting the attention of the FBI because of alleged indecent lyrics in their version of the song. The lyrics were, in fact, innocent, but Ely&#x27;s baffling enunciation permitted teenage fans and concerned parents alike to imagine the most scandalous obscenities. (Ironically, the FBI totally missed Lynn Easton yelling &quot;Fuck!&quot; at 0:54 after fumbling a drum fill.) All of this attention only made the song more popular. In April 1966 &quot;Louie Louie&quot; was reissued and once again hit the music charts, reaching No. 65 on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; chart and No. 97 on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot; chart.

In 1985, Ross Shafer, host and a writer-performer of the late-night comedy series &quot;Almost Live!&quot; on the Seattle TV station KING, spearheaded an effort to have &quot;Louie Louie&quot; replace &quot;Washington, My Home&quot; by Helen Davis as Washington&#x27;s official state song. Picking up on this initially prankish effort, Whatcom County Councilman Craig Cole introduced Resolution No. 85–12 in the state legislature, citing the need for a &quot;contemporary theme song that can be used to engender a sense of pride and community, and in the enhancement of tourism and economic development&quot;. His resolution also called for the creation of a new &quot;Louie Louie County&quot;. While the House did not pass it, the Senate&#x27;s Resolution 1985-37 declared April 12, 1985, &quot;Louie Louie Day&quot;. A crowd of 4,000, estimated by press reports, convened at the state capitol that day for speeches, singalongs, and performances by the Wailers, the Kingsmen, and Paul Revere and the Raiders. Two days later, a Seattle event commemorated the occasion with the premiere performance of a new, Washington-centric version of the song written by composer Berry.

Other Kingsmen &quot;Louie Louie&quot; versions with either Lynn Easton or Dick Peterson as lead vocalist appeared on &quot;Live &amp; Unreleased&quot; (recorded 1963, released 1992), &quot;Live at the Castle&quot; (recorded 1964, released 2011), &quot;Shindig! Presents Frat Party&quot; (VHS, recorded 1965, released 1991), &quot;60s Dance Party&quot; (1982), &quot;California Cooler Presents Cooler Hits&quot; (recorded 1986, released 1987), &quot;The Louie Louie Collection&quot; (as the Mystery Band, 1994), &quot;Red, White &amp; Rock&quot; (2002), &quot;Garage Sale&quot; (recorded 2002, released 2003), and &quot;My Music: &#x27;60s Pop, Rock &amp; Soul&quot; (DVD, 2011). Peterson also released a solo version on the 1999 &quot;Circle of Friends, Volume 1&quot; CD.

Over the years the Kingsmen&#x27;s version of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; has been recognized by organizations and publications worldwide for its influence on the history of rock and roll. Rankings and recognition in major publications and surveys are shown in the table below.

==Kingsmen history==

Before the success of &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, the members of the Kingsmen took varied paths. Easton, whose mother had registered the name of the group and therefore owned it, declared that from this point on he intended to be the singer asserting, &quot;It&#x27;s my band because I own the name&quot;, and forcing Ely to play the drums. This led Ely and Nordby to quit the group in 1963, and Gary Abbott and Norm Sundholm were added to play drums and bass, respectively. (The liner notes for the first album, &quot;The Kingsmen In Person&quot;, presented an abridged history with no mention of Ely or Nordby and with Easton as the group’s sole founder and creative force.)

Don Gallucci was forced out because he wasn&#x27;t old enough to tour and later formed Don and the Goodtimes, which morphed into the short-lived Touch. Later, Gallucci became a record producer with Elektra Records, with his most famous production being the Stooges&#x27; seminal second album &quot;Fun House&quot;.

The two remaining original Kingsmen, Lynn Easton and Mike Mitchell, were joined by Gary Abbott, Barry Curtis and Norm Sundholm to record their first album and tour as the official band. Dick Peterson (not Dickie Peterson) replaced Gary Abbott shortly thereafter. This line-up stayed intact from 1964 into 1966 and charted multiple singles and albums with Easton as the principal vocalist.

After Ely&#x27;s departure and considerable chart success by the new line-up, the group learned that he was performing with another group as The Kingsmen. Following legal action, a settlement was reached and Easton, Mitchell, Peterson, Curtis and Sundholm established their rights to the &quot;Kingsmen&quot; name. Thus, Ely was forced to stop using the name, Easton could no longer lip sync to Ely&#x27;s vocals, and subsequent releases of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; were required to have the text &quot;Lead vocal by Jack Ely&quot; below the title. Unable to perform using the Kingsmen name, Ely continued with his groups the Squires and the Courtmen. He also received a gold record for &quot;Louie Louie&quot; as part of the settlement.

The Kingsmen&#x27;s 1964 follow up to &quot;Louie Louie&quot; was a party version of &quot;Money (That&#x27;s What I Want)&quot; which hit the &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot; at No. 16 and on &quot;Cashbox&quot; at No. 17. Then came &quot;Little Latin Lupe Lu&quot; peaking on &quot;Billboard&quot; at No. 46 and &quot;Cashbox&quot; at No. 49. After that it was &quot;Death of An Angel&quot; No. 33 on Cashbox and No. 42 on Billboard.

After starting 1965 with their own float in the Rose Bowl Parade, the Kingsmen returned to the Top 10 nationally with &quot;The Jolly Green Giant&quot; reaching No. 4 on Billboard and No. 8 on Cashbox. The novelty number also made No. 25 on the Billboard R&amp;B chart and hit No. 1 on the RPM Canada chart. The follow-up song was &quot;The Climb&quot;, No. 45 on Cashbox and No. 65 on Billboard. &quot;Annie Fanny&quot; was released next reaching No. 43 on Cashbox and No. 47 on Billboard. Next came &quot;(You Got) The Gamma Goochee&quot;, No. 98 on Cashbox and No. 122 on Billboard. The group also appeared in the beach party movie &quot;How to Stuff a Wild Bikini&quot; singing &quot;Give Her Lovin&#x27;&quot; (released as a B-side to &quot;Annie Fanny&quot;) which appeared on the soundtrack album along with their recording of the title song.

In 1966 the Kingsmen continued to hit the charts with &quot;Killer Joe&quot; reaching No. 77 on Billboard and No. 81 on Cashbox. Their original recording of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; was re-released as &quot;Louie Louie 64-65-66&quot; and re-entered the Billboard, Cash Box, and Record World charts. They also released a promotional item, a &quot;picture-sleeve-clad potato-chip ad jingle 45&quot; titled &quot;The Krunch&quot;, their only picture sleeve single, which did not chart.

1966 also saw two Kingsmen departures: Barry Curtis was drafted and Norm Sundholm opted to work full time for Sunn amplifiers, a business he had started in 1964 with his brother. Replacements were J.C. Rieck on keyboards (until Curtis&#x27;s return) and Kerry Magness on bass, with Magness soon giving way to Pete Borg and then Jeff Beals. 

In 1967 they made the charts for the last time with &quot;Bo Diddley Bach&quot; reaching No. 128 on Billboard, and in July founding member Lynn Easton left the group. He worked for an advertising firm and hosted &quot;this is IT&quot;, a &quot;bandstand-type&quot; show for Portland television station KGW. Singer Turley Richards was brought in as Easton&#x27;s replacement, but he departed later that same year.

In 1968 with the original group on a recording and touring hiatus, the Kingsmen&#x27;s management team worked with the Kasenetz-Katz production organization and studio musicians to release a single on the Earth label (&quot;Feed Me&quot;/&quot;Just A &#x27;B&#x27; Side&quot;). A separate lineup was formed with new members (including lead singer Yank Barry) to tour for a time during 1968–1969 on the East Coast of the United States while the main lineup of the band was inactive.

In 1973 the reactivated group signed with Capitol and released one single which did not chart.

In addition to Jack Ely&#x27;s groups and re-recordings, several of the Kingsmen pursued other solo projects. Dick Peterson and Barry Curtis as the Other Two released two singles in 1966, and Lynn Easton re-recorded &quot;The Jolly Green Giant&quot; in 1976. Peterson as Dick St. Nicklaus released two albums, &quot;Magic&quot; (1979) and &quot;Sweet and Dandy&quot; (1980), and multiple singles. In 2002, Barry Curtis and Steve Peterson joined the revived line-up of The Daily Flash.

In 1983, the group successfully sued K-tel over the release of the 1982 &quot;60&#x27;s Dance Party&quot; album because it featured a 1976 Jack Ely re-recording of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; billed as by &quot;The Kingsmen&quot; and displayed the text &quot;These selections are rerecordings by the original artists&quot; on the back cover. K-tel had also similarly marketed the Lynn Easton re-recording of &quot;The Jolly Green Giant&quot;.

Also in 1983, a music video, &quot;The Kingsmen – Live at Delta House&quot;, aired on MTV. Directed by David Jester, the video recreated the raucous, toga party atmosphere popularized in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot; using the &quot;Delta House&quot; on the University of Oregon campus. Bassist Fred Dennis was featured as the lead vocalist. 

In 1993, members of the group brought legal action against Gusto Records to have all of their original recordings returned. Gusto had acquired the Kingsmen song rights from Springboard International Records, Inc., who had purchased the entire Scepter-Wand catalog in 1977 after Florence Greenberg&#x27;s retirement, but the group had not been paid royalties since 1968. In 1998, the Kingsmen were awarded ownership of all their early recordings, including &quot;Louie Louie&quot;.

When Jack Ely died on April 28, 2015, obituaries were published by the Associated Press, Time, Washington Post, New York Times, The Times, and others. Critic Dave Marsh said that Ely&#x27;s vocal made the Kingsmen&#x27;s &quot;Louie Louie&quot; &quot;...the classic that it is.&quot; Lynn Easton died on April 24, 2020.

Mike Mitchell died on April 16, 2021, on his 77th birthday. At the time of his death, he was the only remaining member of the Kingsmen&#x27;s original lineup who still performed with the band. His &quot;Louie Louie&quot; guitar break has been called &quot;iconic&quot;, &quot;blistering&quot;, and &quot;one of the most famous guitar solos of all time&quot;. &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine noted, &quot;Raw, lightning-fast, and loud, the solo&#x27;s unbridled energy helped make the song a No. 2 pop hit, but also helped set the template for garage-rock – and later hard-rock – guitar.&quot;

As of 2024, Bob Nordby and Don Gallucci are the last surviving members of the &quot;Louie Louie&quot; line-up.

;Discography notes
==Other uses of the name==
Prior to this group&#x27;s formation, another group called The Kingsmen operated in 1958 and was made up of members of Bill Haley &amp; His Comets who were moonlighting from their regular work with Haley. This group scored a hit record (#35) on Billboard with the instrumental entitled &quot;Week End&quot;, written by Rudy Pompilli, Franny Beecher, and Billy Williamson, backed with &quot;Better Believe It&quot; as the B side. They released a follow-up single on East West Records featuring &quot;The Catwalk&quot; backed with &quot;Conga Rock&quot;. Although the Comets did the actual recordings, when the Kingsmen went on tour a different set of musicians performed instead of Haley&#x27;s people. The band made at least one appearance on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; in 1958.

Many other groups have used the name &quot;The Kingsmen&quot;, including a gospel vocal group formed in 1956 (also referred to as The Kingsmen Quartet), and bands that were later renamed as Flamin&#x27; Groovies, The Gants and The Statler Brothers. An a cappella group at Columbia University is traditionally known as the Kingsmen; former members include Art Garfunkel and the original lineup of Sha Na Na.

<text>Problem Child is a 1990 American black comedy film directed by Dennis Dugan in his feature film directorial debut and produced by Robert Simonds. It stars John Ritter, Michael Oliver, Jack Warden, Gilbert Gottfried, Amy Yasbeck, and Michael Richards.

Released on July 27, 1990, the film received negative reviews from critics but was a box office success, grossing $72.2 million worldwide against a production budget of $11 million.

It was followed by two sequels, &quot;Problem Child 2&quot; (1991) and the made for TV &quot;Problem Child 3: Junior in Love&quot; (1995).

==Plot==
Ben Healy Jr. is a pleasant man working for his father, &quot;Big Ben&quot; Healy Sr., a tyrannical sporting goods dealer running for mayor, who intends to sell his entire estate to a Japanese conglomerate, as he considers his son &quot;too nice&quot; to be his heir. Ben would love to have a son, but his obnoxious social climbing wife, Flo, has been unable to conceive. He approaches less-than-scrupulous adoption agent Igor Peabody with his dilemma, and Peabody presents him and Flo with a 7-year-old boy named Junior.

However, Junior is hardly a model child; mean-spirited and incorrigible, he leaves a path of severe destruction in his wake and is pen pals with Martin Beck, a serial killer known as &quot;the Bow Tie Killer&quot;, who mistakes Junior&#x27;s signature for that of a criminal acquaintance of his, &quot;J.R.&quot;. 
Big Ben falls down the stairs, and his room catches on fire. Junior messes up a camping trip with neighbor Roy and his family by urinating on the campfire and manipulating a practical joke played on the kids by Roy. Junior then is taken to his neighbor Lucy&#x27;s birthday party, only for her to ban him from seeing the booked magic act; Ben tries to lift Junior&#x27;s spirits by giving him his good-luck charm, but Junior instead sabotages the party. Finally, Junior displays his method for winning in a Little League baseball game, which involves hitting rival players in the crotch with his bat. Ben has severe doubts about him and takes him back to the orphanage. However, upon hearing that Junior was returned thirty times by previous adoptive families, Ben decides to keep and love him, something no one has ever done. Distraught, Junior retaliates by driving Ben&#x27;s car into Big Ben&#x27;s store, and Big Ben cleans out Ben&#x27;s bank account to pay for the damage. Ben is on the verge of cracking until Beck arrives at the house and kidnaps Junior and Flo.

While Ben initially sees this as good riddance to browbeating Flo and trouble-making Junior, he soon notices signs that Junior is not the monster he appeared to be; through a series of pictures he drew, he depicts children and adults who treated him poorly as deformed monsters with hostile surroundings but depicts Ben as a person in a pleasant background, revealing that he did value him as a father figure. Realizing that Junior&#x27;s behavior was simply a reaction to how he was treated, Ben undertakes a rescue mission to get him back from Beck.

Ben first steals Roy&#x27;s car and hat and confronts Big Ben for money; when he is rudely dismissed, Ben pushes a button that unknowingly puts Big Ben on camera, where he reveals his true nature on the news, mooning the camera.

Ben catches up with Beck and Junior at the circus. Junior gets rescued after escaping from Beck through a trapeze act. Beck drives away, but the Healys are on his tail. After a collision, Flo, who was stuffed in a suitcase, flies over the bridge and ends up in the back of a truck loaded with pigs. Beck is arrested but not before getting a shot off, which hits Ben in the chest. Thinking he has died, Junior apologizes and tells him that he loves him. Ben wakes up and realizes that the bullet ricocheted off the good luck prune he had in his shirt pocket. Junior then removes his bow tie and throws it over the bridge as a symbol of rejecting his relationship with Beck and walks away with Ben. The movie ends with Flo in the back of a truck full of pigs.

==Cast==
* John Ritter as Benjamin &quot;Ben&quot; Healy Jr.
* Michael Oliver as Junior Healy.
* Jack Warden as Benjamin &quot;Big Ben&quot; Healy, Sr., Ben&#x27;s wealthy, mean, and selfish father who holds contempt for Ben&#x27;s kindness and considerate personality.
* Gilbert Gottfried as Igor Peabody, the adoption agent at the orphanage who is Junior&#x27;s nemesis and wants him out of the orphanage and his life. 
* Amy Yasbeck as Florence &quot;Flo&quot; Healy, Ben&#x27;s social-climbing wife who cares far more about the image of being a wife and mother rather than the actual responsibilities or morals.
* Michael Richards as Martin Beck, a childish escaped convict who goes by the moniker &quot;Bow Tie Killer&quot;.
* Peter Jurasik as Roy, Ben and Flo&#x27;s neighbor who is rather brash and arrogant.
* Colby Kline as Lucy Henderson, a little girl whose birthday party is ruined by Junior.
* Dennis Dugan (&quot;cameo&quot;) as All American Dad.

==Production==
The film was shot on location in Texas, from October 2 to November 24, 1989. The primary locations were Dallas, Farmers Branch, Fort Worth, Irving, and Mesquite. Also, there were two weeks of reshoots in Dallas in March 1990. The production budget was originally projected to be $11 million.

Dan Aykroyd, Chevy Chase, Richard Dreyfuss, Steve Martin, Rick Moranis, and Kurt Russell were considered for the role of Ben before it was turned over to John Ritter. The part of Martin Beck was originally offered to Christopher Lloyd, who turned it down because of his commitments with &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot;, released two months before this one, and was replaced by Michael Richards; this was the second role, following &quot;UHF&quot; (1989), that Lloyd had turned down only to be taken by Richards. Then-unknown child actor Macaulay Culkin reportedly auditioned for Junior, but Michael Oliver was ultimately cast. Culkin would later play a character akin to Junior, albeit with a darker side, in the film &quot;The Good Son&quot;.

During a 2014 interview on Gilbert Gottfried&#x27;s Amazing Colossal Podcast, screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski revealed that the story was inspired by the 1988 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article &quot;An Adopted Boy--and Terror Begins&quot; about a married couple suing an adoption agency after they were not informed that their adopted son had severe mental health issues with violent tendencies and had been previously returned to the agency multiple times. While other writers pitched the story as a horror film in the vein of &quot;Bad Seed&quot; or &quot;The Omen&quot;, Alexander and Karaszewski thought it had potential as a comedy, envisioning a dark, adult satire of the then-popular trend in films where cute kids teach cynical adults how to love, as seen in &quot;Baby Boom&quot;, &quot;Parenthood&quot; (directly spoofed by the film&#x27;s poster), &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot;, &quot;Uncle Buck&quot;, &quot;Mr. Mom&quot;, &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot;, and &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot;, but the studio insisted upon turning it into a children&#x27;s film, a conversion that necessitated numerous reshoots and rewrites, leading to a difficult production that left all involved disappointed and anticipating a box office failure. It defied these expectations, becoming a surprise hit and Universal&#x27;s most profitable film of 1990, but was still so embarrassing for Alexander and Karaszewski (Alexander even cried after the cast and crew screening) that they tried to distance themselves from it, which proved difficult. Studios were initially reluctant to hire them or take them seriously based on their work on such a prominent disreputable film but, as the years went by, they would eventually come to work with executives who were children when it first came out, and grew up watching its frequent TV airings, and were excited to be meeting its writers. Looking back, they still feel it&#x27;s &quot;a mess&quot; but take some pride in being involved with one of the &quot;very few [PG-rated] children&#x27;s films &quot;that&quot; black and &quot;that&quot; crazy&quot;, citing the scene where Flo commits adultery with Martin while Ben is catatonic and contemplating murdering Junior in the next room as an example. They added, &quot;And it&#x27;s funny&quot;.

In 2015, Dennis Dugan revealed that he was hired to direct the film, his first feature one (he&#x27;d previously directed episodes of the TV series &quot;Moonlighting&quot;, &quot;Wiseguy&quot;, and &quot;Hunter&quot;), after jumping on a coffee table in a meeting with Universal executives: &quot;You&#x27;re looking at me like I&#x27;m fucking nuts, and this is what we want. We want this kind of chaos&quot;. Dugan suggested John Ritter, with whom he&#x27;d worked as an actor before turning to direct, for the role of Ben. The studio was initially reluctant, feeling they needed a more famous actor, but eventually relented. Jack Warden turned down the role of Big Ben before Dugan offered him half of his net points; he was so touched that he took the part, although he refused Dugan&#x27;s offer. Amy Yasbeck was cast as Flo; she and Ritter fell in love during production, eventually marrying in 1999. Ritter died in 2003. Both he and Gilbert Gottfried were allowed to ad lib while filming, but Universal reprimanded Dugan for shooting too much footage of the latter. The film&#x27;s first test screening was disastrous, with 70 percent of the audience walking out, verbal complaints from viewers, and a score of only 30. The studio forced two weeks of reshoots, including a retooled ending and the addition of key scenes, such as Lucy&#x27;s birthday party.

==Music==
A soundtrack was released by Universal the same day as the film, and included an original composition by The Beach Boys.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was released on July 27, 1990 and debuted in third place, behind &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; and &quot;Ghost&quot;. It went on to be a commercial success at the box office, grossing $53 million domestically and $72 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
The film received negative reviews upon its release. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a rare approval rating of 0% based on 30 reviews, and an average rating of 2.3/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Mean-spirited and hopelessly short on comic invention, &quot;Problem Child&quot; is a particularly unpleasant comedy, one that&#x27;s loaded with manic scenery chewing and juvenile pranks&quot;. On Metacritic, it has a score of 27 out of 100 based on reviews from 12 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave it a grade &quot;A−&quot; on scale of A to F.

The film was heavily censored when shown on television due to the remarks characters made about adoption, which critics saw as insensitive. It was not screened for critics prior to its release.

===Protests over posters===
One of the posters for the film showed the cat Fuzzball in a tumble dryer, with the implication being that Junior had put him inside. A group named In Defence of Animals organized protests against the posters, and some cinemas took them down in response. Director Dennis Dugan later issued a disclaimer saying that the &quot;kitty in the dryer&quot; was metaphorical and never an actual scene in the film. The protests sparked the inspiration for the sequel, this time with a poster of John Ritter inside a dryer looking out, while Fuzzball stands by it.

===Accolades===
For the film (as well as &quot;The Adventures of Ford Fairlane&quot; and &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking Too&quot;), Gilbert Gottfried was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor, but lost to Donald Trump in &quot;Ghosts Can&#x27;t Do It&quot;.

==Home media==
The film was more successful on home video. The VHS version adds an extra bit just before the closing credits, in which Junior interrupts the sequence to tell the audience that he&#x27;ll be back next summer for &quot;Problem Child 2&quot;. Then he disappears and a loud flatulent noise is heard, followed by Ben shouting, &quot;Junior!&quot;, him laughing, and the roll of the closing credits. The VHS version was released on January 31, 1991.

The first DVD release was released by GoodTimes Entertainment on May 1, 2001. It and &quot;Problem Child 2&quot; were released together on DVD in the US on March 2, 2004, as a package entitled &quot;Problem Child Tantrum Pack&quot;. They were presented in open-matte full screen only. However, no home video release thus far features the deleted footage shown on TV airings of it.

The film was re-released on the &quot;Family Comedy Pack Quadruple Feature&quot; DVD (with other comedy films like &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot;, &quot;Kicking &amp; Screaming&quot;, and &quot;Major Payne&quot;) in anamorphic widescreen (being its first widescreen Region 1 DVD release) on August 5, 2008.

It was released on Blu-ray on August 8, 2017.

===TV version===
The film first aired on NBC on September 15, 1991, with 12 minutes of previously deleted scenes and all the profanity was dubbed with different and appropriate words and phrases.

==Legacy==
===Sequels===

The film inspired two sequels: the first, &quot;Problem Child 2&quot;, was released theatrically in 1991; the second, &quot;Problem Child 3: Junior in Love&quot;, was a television film aired on NBC in 1995. The first one brought back the original cast in their original roles and picked up where the first film ended. However, Amy Yasbeck was given a new role with a new dynamic opposite to her original character. In the third and final film, William Katt and Justin Chapman replaced John Ritter and Michael Oliver as Ben and Junior respectively, while Gilbert Gottfried and Jack Warden reprised their roles as Igor Peabody and Big Ben and does not follow the storyline of the first two films.

===Television series===

The film was adapted into an animated television series that aired on USA Network for two seasons, from October 31, 1993, to December 4, 1994. Gilbert Gottfried was the only original cast member to be featured as a voice-over actor, making him the only cast member involved in all three films as well as the animated series.

In 2015, NBC ordered a pilot for a live-action TV series based on the film, produced by STXtelevision, Imagine TV, and NBCUniversal, but the pilot was not picked up by the network.

===In popular culture===
The film was featured in a famous scene from Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1991 remake of &quot;Cape Fear&quot;, where it is shown screening at a movie theatre attended by ex-convict Max Cady (Robert De Niro), attorney Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) and the latter&#x27;s family. Cady, trying to unsettle Bowden and his family, loudly and obnoxiously cackles at the film.

===Adaptations===
In 1995, a Turkish-language adaptation of the film was made called &quot;Zıpçıktı&quot;, which was directed by Ünal Küpeli and featured Şenol Coşkun in the lead role.

<doc id="304726" wikidata="Q795176" url="?curid=304726" title="Kejimkujik National Park">
<text>Kejimkujik National Park () is a national park of Canada, covering in the southwest of Nova Scotia peninsula. Located within three municipalities, Annapolis, Queens, Digby, it consists of two separate land areas: an inland part, which is coincident with the Kejimkujik National Historic Site of Canada, and the Kejimkujik National Park Seaside on the Atlantic coast.

The Historic site is a cultural landscape forested upland plain between the South Shore and the Annapolis Valley. It is home to petroglyph sites, habitation sites, fishing and hunting sites, travel routes and burial grounds, which attest to Mi’kmaq occupancy of this area for thousands of years.

The seaside part is a wilderness protection area featuring coastal bogs, beaches, intertidal areas, and abundant flora and fauna.

The Royal Astronomical Society of Canada has designated the park a dark-sky preserve.

The park is named after Kejimikujik Lake, the largest lake in the park.

==History==
The name &quot;Kejimkujik&quot; is officially translated to &quot;tired muscles&quot; in the Mi&#x27;kmaq language, although other sources interpret it to mean &quot;swollen waters&quot; or &quot;attempting to escape&quot;.

Canoe routes in the park have been used for thousands of years by native peoples to travel from the Bay of Fundy to the Atlantic shore. A major travel route for the Mi&#x27;kmaq was the Mersey River, which runs from Kejimkujik Lake to the Atlantic Ocean. The Mi&#x27;kmaq would often travel up the river to the lake where they camped during the fall and winter months on the shores of the park&#x27;s rivers and lakes.

There are four Mi&#x27;kmaw petroglyph sites in the park containing around 500 individual petroglyphs. They are found in slate beds on the eastern side of Kejimikujik Lake. There are no slates beds on the western side. They are highly protected. Only one site can be visited by the public via a guided tour in the summer. The petroglyphs show aspects of Mi&#x27;kmaw life after European contact, and are dated to the 1700s and 1800s. Many are symbolic and sometimes ambiguous. Motifs associated with traditional culture include canoes, wigwams, traditional costume, and decorative designs. There are also images of prey animals, but none of plants. European motifs include ships, horses, women in dresses, Christian symbols, and five-pointed stars.
&quot;The Tent Dwellers&quot; is a book by Albert Paine which chronicles his travels through inland Nova Scotia on a trout fishing trip. Published in 1908, it takes place in what is now Kejimkujik National Park and the Kejimkujik Seaside Tobeatic Game Reserve.

After European settlement, the Mi&#x27;kmaq living in the area found it increasingly difficult to maintain their traditional way of life. Many Mi&#x27;kmaq families were forced off of their hunting grounds by settlers who were clearing the land for farming and logging. Poverty eventually became pervasive for the area&#x27;s Mi&#x27;kmaq residents. Ultimately, many of these residents either took up farming or found employment as guides for wealthy visitors to the area through hunting and fishing expeditions.

Today, the area does not serve as a residential area, but is still considered to be a spiritual home to the Mi&#x27;kmaq people.

The main Jeremy&#x27;s Bay campground has 355 campsites, many suitable for large RVs, and generates about $1 million per year in fees. A group campground for up to 80 people is at Jim Charles Point, named after the eponymous local First Nations Guide who lived there in the mid-1800s. There are also backcountry primitive campsites accessible by canoe, bicycle or hiking.

There are 15 hiking trails for hiking, skiing, or snowshoeing. Backcountry campsites can also be accessed on foot. Winter camping is possible. Activities such as bird-watching and night sky viewing are also available in the park.

=== Canoeing ===
Canoeing is a popular form of recreation in the park, thanks to its many lakes. There is extensive canoeing on Kejimkujik Lake itself, and many of the smaller lakes in the park are interconnected by portage trails. Many of park&#x27;s backcountry campsites can only be accessed by canoe. Common canoe routes in the park include a loop connecting Big Dam, Frozen Ocean, and Channel Lakes, and the lakes south and west of Kejmkujik Lake, including Peskowesk and Peskawa lakes. From Peskawa Lake, it is possible to reach the Shelburne River and enter the Tobeatic Wilderness Area, located just outside the park.

==Flora==
Most of the park&#x27;s forest is second growth, although it does contain significant areas of intact original habitat. The park is situated in the Southwest Nova Biosphere Reserve in a region characterized as Acadian forest. There are 23 species of ferns that are found in the park. Common ferns include cinnamon fern, bracken fern, and New York fern. Rare ferns such as oak fern, dwarf chain fern, bog fern, and curly-grass fern are also protected in the park. Wildflowers bloom from May through June and common species include blue violet, star-flower, rose twisted-stalk, twin-flower, painted trillium, and goldthread. There are 544 species of vascular plants in the park and 15 species of orchids including Common lady’s-slipper and Rattlesnake plantain. 

==Fauna==
Among the 34 species of mammal found in the park, the more common are: shrews, the star-nosed mole, bats, snowshoe hare, squirrels (including nocturnal flying squirrels), beaver (protected species in Nova Scotia), mice, voles, porcupine, red fox, and white-tailed deer. The park&#x27;s shallow lakes, bogs, and marshes are a habitat to a greater variety of amphibians and reptiles than anywhere else in Atlantic Canada. The other mammals that inhabit this park include eastern coyote, North American river otter, raccoon, bobcat, American black bear and eastern moose. 

Common birds of the park include hermit thrush, white-breasted nuthatch, American woodcock, northern parula, yellow-bellied sapsucker, piping plover (at the seaside), ruffed grouse, common loon, barred owl, and the American black duck.

At the Kejimkujik seaside, harbor seals can be seen. The Little Port Joli Basin and Basin Lake are being used for European green crab research. The removal of the green crabs is essential in research into the dwindling fish stocks on the East Coast.

Invasive species include the chain pickerel and the small-mouth bass.

The park is habitat to many endangered or threatened species, including the Blanding&#x27;s turtle, ribbon snake, piping plover, Canada warbler, common nighthawk, chimney swift, monarch butterfly, and harlequin duck.

Common loons in the park have the highest levels of methyl mercury in their blood of any loons in North America, the result of bioaccumulation. This is reducing their reproduction rates. Yellow perch, long, is their main source of food, and these have been found to have more than twice the mercury level than loons from neighbouring New Brunswick. After years of research, the ultimate source of the mercury remains unknown. Mercury is present in many fish across Nova Scotia, and there are province-wide advisories on all species, except rainbow trout.

The federal government Kejimkujik Ecological Research and Monitoring Centre has run dozens of projects in the park.

==Geography==

The park is located in a flat plain. Its highest point, Mount Tom, is at . Precambrian to Ordovician quartzite and slate form the bedrock, along with Devonian granite. These rocks provide few nutrients to the soils that develop from them. Podzols are found in well-drained areas, which poorly-drained areas are dominated by Gleysols and peat bog.

Fifteen percent of the park is covered by lakes. Evidence of the Last Glacial Period include drumlins, erratics, and eskers. Major rivers include the Mersey, and the Shelburne, major lakes include Kejimikujik, and Luxton.

Kejimujik National Park Seaside includes white sandy beaches and coastal wetland areas. It also has boulder fields and drumlins formed by glacial action.

===Climate===
The park has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with four distinct seasons. Being located inland, in the western part of Nova Scotia, the park has warmer temperatures and higher precipitation than eastern sections of Nova Scotia. Winters are cold with a January average of . During this time of the year, the maximum temperature often stays below freezing although frequent mild spells push maximum temperatures above freezing frequently (about 12–19 days from December to February) and occasionally above when the wind is from the southwest. On average, there are 3.3 days where the temperature falls below per year. Winters are characterized by stretches of unsettled weather, resulting in high precipitation and cloud cover. Snowfall is high, averaging a year.

Summers are warm with a July average of and precipitation is lower (though significant) than the winter months. Temperatures in the park rarely exceed , occurring on 5.9 days per year owing to the moderating influence of the ocean. Spring and fall are transitional seasons that feature mild temperature although they are unpredictable. The park receives of precipitation per year, which is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year.

<text>Xenophon Overton Pindall (August 21, 1873 – January 2, 1935) was a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives, Arkansas State Senate and acting governor of the U.S. state of Arkansas.

==Early life==
Pindall was born at Middle Grove in Monroe County, Missouri. He attended Central College in Missouri and earned his law degree from the University of Arkansas in 1896. He was a member of Kappa Sigma, Xi chapter at the University of Arkansas. Contemporaries of Pindall at Xi Chapter included future Arkansas Governor and Federal Judge John Ellis Martineau, future acting Governor Michael Pleasant Huddleston, future Federal Judge Thomas Clark Trimble III, and future Congressman and Federal Judge Samuel Billingsley Hill.

==Career==
Pindall served as a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1902 to 1906. He ran unsuccessfully for the post of Arkansas Attorney General in 1906 and later that year was elected to the Arkansas State Senate.

On February 11, 1907, Arkansas Governor John Sebastian Little resigned his office due to mental and physical illness. John Isaac Moore was president of the Senate and replaced him as governor. At the end of the legislative session in May, Pindall was chosen as the new president of the Senate and became acting governor.

Pindall served as Governor until January 11, 1909, when his Senate term expired. Pindall&#x27;s successor was Jesse M. Martin, who served as acting governor for three days. During Pindall&#x27;s administration, a pure food and drug law was passed, the Ozark National Forest was created, and laws against price discrimination were enacted.

After leaving office, Pindall became a renowned criminal lawyer operating out of an office in Arkansas City.

==Death and legacy==
Pindall died on January 2, 1935, and is buried in Little Rock, Arkansas, in Roselawn Memorial Park.

The town of Pindall, Arkansas, is named for him. His law office in Arkansas City is on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Jesse M. Martin (March 1, 1877 – January 22, 1915) was best known as the acting governor of the U.S. state of Arkansas from January 11, 1909, to January 14, 1909. Senator Martin served as Acting Governor of Arkansas for three days until the inauguration of Governor George W. Donaghey.

Martin became acting governor after the expiration of the state senate term of Xenophon Overton Pindall. Pindall had served as acting governor during the unexpired term of John Sebastian Little when Little was unable to serve due to physical and mental illness.

==Background==
Jesse M. Martin was born the fifth of eleven children on a farm near London, Arkansas to Jasper J., a farmer, and Martha (née Johnson) Martin. Jesse helped his father on the farm but also taught school after completing his own education. At age 22, he was a law student at Hendrix College and later University of Arkansas. After graduating, he was the circuit of clerk for Pope County for four years. Afterwards, he was admitted to the Arkansas Bar Association and became a partner in the firm Brooks, Hays &amp; Martin. Martin started his political career in 1909 when he was elected to represent his district and was re-elected in 1909. After this term, he was president of the Arkansas State Senate and afterwards lieutenant governor of Arkansas. In 1909, he was Governor of Arkansas for three days until George Washington Donaghey was elected. In 1902, he married Mollie Ferguson and they had one son, Ferguson (born 1905).

<text>The Marsh Arabs (Arabic: عرب الأهوار ʻArab al-Ahwār &quot;Arabs of the Marshlands&quot;), also referred to as Ahwaris, the Maʻdān (Arabic: معدان &quot;dweller in the plains&quot;) or [[Shroug|Shroog]] ( &quot;those from the east&quot;)—the latter two often considered derogatory in the present day—are Indigenous inhabitants of the Mesopotamian marshlands in the modern-day south Iraq, as well as in the Hawizeh Marshes straddling the Iraq-Iran border.

Comprising members of many different tribes and tribal confederations, such as the Āl Bū Muḥammad, Ferayghāt, Shaghanbah, Ahwaris had developed a culture centered on the marshes&#x27; natural resources and unique, Many of the marshes&#x27; inhabitants were forcibly displaced during the Ahwari Genocide when the wetlands were drained during and after the 1991 uprisings in Iraq. The draining of the marshes caused a significant decline in bioproductivity; following the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime, water flow to the marshes was restored and the ecosystem has begun to recover.

==History==

===Origin theories===
The origins of The Ahwari People are still a matter of some dispute. British colonial ethnographers found it difficult to classify some of Ahwaris&#x27; social customs and speculated that they might have originated in Indus Valley (Pakistan). They may have descended from Zuṭṭ, who moved to the region of lower Iraq in the 8th and 9th centuries and followed similar customs and traditions.

Some scholars such as Ali al-Wardi have claimed they are descended from the Nabataeans of Iraq, the Aramaic-speaking people who inhabited Lower Mesopotamia in the Middle Ages, and some of their clans even follow their ancestry to Islamized Mandaeans. 

Other scholars have proposed historical and genetic links between the Marsh Arabs and the ancient Sumerians due to shared agricultural practices, methods of house-building and location. There is, however, no written record of the marsh tribes until the ninth century and the Sumerians lost their distinct ethnic identity by around 1800 BCE, some 2700 years before. Links to Sumerian genetics can likely be traced back to the Arabization and assimilation of indigenous Mesopotamians.

Others, however, have noted that much of the culture of Ahwaris is shared with the desert bedouin who came to the area after the fall of the Abbasid Caliphate.

===1991–2003===
The marshes had for some time been considered a refuge for elements persecuted by the government of Saddam Hussein, as in past centuries they had been a refuge for escaped slaves and serfs, such as during the Zanj Rebellion. By the mid-1980s, a low-level insurgency against Ba&#x27;athist drainage and resettlement projects had developed in the area, led by Sheik Abdul Kerim Mahud al-Muhammadawi of the Al bu Muhammad under the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; Abu Hatim.

During the 1970s, the expansion of irrigation projects had begun to disrupt the flow of water to the marshes. However, after the First Gulf War (1991), the Iraqi government aggressively revived a program to divert the flow of the Tigris River and the Euphrates River away from the marshes in retribution for a failed Shia uprising. This was done primarily to eliminate the food sources of the Marsh Arabs and to prevent any remaining militiamen from taking refuge in the marshes, the Badr Brigades and other militias having used them as cover. The plan, which was accompanied by a series of propaganda articles by the Iraqi regime directed against the Ma&#x27;dan, systematically converted the wetlands into a desert, forcing the residents out of their settlements in the region. Villages in the marshes were attacked and burnt down and there were reports of the water being deliberately poisoned.

The majority of Ahwaris were displaced either to areas adjacent to the drained marshes, abandoning their traditional lifestyle in favour of conventional agriculture, to towns and camps in other areas of Iraq or to Iranian refugee camps. Only 1,600 of them were estimated to still be living on traditional &quot;dibins&quot; by 2003. The western Hammar Marshes and the Qurnah or Central Marshes had become completely desiccated, while the eastern Hawizeh Marshes had dramatically shrunk. The Marsh Arabs, who numbered about half a million in the 1950s, have dwindled to as few as 20,000 in Iraq, according to the United Nations. As of 2003, an estimated 80,000 to 120,000 have fled to refugee camps in Iran. However, following the Multi-National Force overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime, water flow to the marshes was restored and the ecosystem has begun to recover, and many have returned to their native lands.

The Observer&#x27;s Middle East correspondent Shyam Bhatia who spent two weeks with the Marsh Arabs in 1993 wrote the first eyewitness account of Iraqi army tactics at the time of draining the marshes, bombing Marsh villages and then sowing mines in the water before retreating. Bhatia&#x27;s extensive reportage won him the title of International Reporter of the Year, although exclusive film footage of the time he spent in the area has never been screened.

===Since 2003===
With the breaching of dikes by local communities subsequent to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the ending of a four-year drought that same year, the process has been reversed and the marshes have experienced a substantial rate of recovery. The permanent wetlands now cover more than 50% of 1970s levels, with a remarkable regrowth of the Hammar and Hawizeh Marshes and some recovery of the Central Marshes.
Efforts to restore the marshes have led to signs of their gradual revivification as water is restored to the former desert, but the whole ecosystem may take far longer to restore than it took to destroy. Only a few thousand of the nearly half million Marsh Arabs remain in the area in Maysan Governorate, Dhi Qar Governorate and Basra Governorate. Most of the rest that can be accounted for are refugees living in other Shi&#x27;i areas in Iraq, or have emigrated to Iran, and many do not wish to return to their former home and lifestyle, which despite its independence was characterised by extreme poverty and hardship. A report by the United States Agency for International Development noted that while some Ahwaris had chosen to return to their traditional activities in the marshes, especially the Hammar Marshes, within a short time of reflooding, they were without clean drinking water, sanitation, health care or education facilities. In addition, it is still uncertain if the marshes will completely recover, given increased levels of water extraction from the Tigris and Euphrates.

Many of the resettled Marsh Arabs have gained representation through the Hezbollah Movement in Iraq; others have become followers of Muqtada al-Sadr&#x27;s movement, through which they gained political control of Maysan Governorate. Political instability and local feuds, aggravated by the poverty of the dispossessed Marsh Arab population, remain a serious problem. Rory Stewart observed that throughout history, Ahwaris were the pawn of many rulers and became expert dissimulators. The tribal chiefs are outwardly submissive and work with the coalition and Iraqi officials. Behind the scenes, the tribes engage in smuggling and other activities.

==Culture==
The term Maʻdān was used disparagingly by desert tribes to refer to those inhabiting the Iraqi river basins, as well as by those who farmed in the river basins to refer to the population of the marshes.

Ahwaris speak South Mesopotamian Arabic and traditionally wore a variant of normal Arab dress: for males, a &quot;thawb&quot; (&quot;long shirt&quot;; in recent times, occasionally with a Western-style jacket over the top) and a &quot;keffiyeh&quot; (&quot;headcloth&quot;) worn twisted around the head in a turban, as few could afford an &quot;ʻiqāl&quot;.

===Agriculture===
The society of the Marsh Arabs was divided into two main groups by occupation. One group bred and raised water buffaloes while others cultivated crops such as rice, barley, wheat and pearl millet; they also kept some sheep and cattle. Rice cultivation was especially important; it was carried out in small plots cleared in April and sown in mid-May. Cultivation seasons were marked by the rising and setting of certain stars, such as the Pleiades and Sirius.

Some Ahwari branches were nomadic pastoralists, erecting temporary dwellings and moving buffaloes around the marshes according to the season. Some fishing, especially of species of barbel (notably the binni or &quot;bunni&quot;, &quot;Mesopotamichthys sharpeyi&quot;), was practised using spears and datura poison, but large-scale fishing using nets was until recent times regarded as a dishonourable profession by Ahwaris and was mostly carried out by a separate low-status tribe known as the &quot;Berbera&quot;. By the early 1990s, however, up to 60% of the total amount of fish caught in Iraq&#x27;s inland waters came from the marshes.

In the later twentieth century, a third main occupation entered Marsh Arab life; the weaving of reed mats on a commercial scale. Though they often earned far more than workers in agriculture, weavers were looked down upon by both Ahwaris and farmers alike: however, financial concerns meant that it gradually gained acceptance as a respectable profession.

===Religion===
The majority of Marsh Arabs are Twelver Shiʿi Muslims, though in the marshes small communities of Mandaic-speaking Mandaeans (often working as boat builders and craftsmen) live alongside them and they number a couple hundred. The inhabitants&#x27; have a long association with Arab tribes within Persia. Wilfred Thesiger mentioned that the Marsh Arabs who had performed the Hajj and those of them had visited Mashhad (thereby earning the title &quot;Zair&quot;) were considered highly respected within the community; A number of families also claimed descent from Muhammad, adopting the title of &quot;sayyid&quot;.Ahwaris carried out the majority of their devotions in private as there were no places of worship within the Marshes; some were known to visit Ezra&#x27;s Tomb, one of the few religious sites of any kind in the area.

===Society===
As with most tribes of southern Iraq, the main authority was the tribal shaikh. To this day, the shaikh of a Marsh Arab group will collect a tribute from his tribe in order to maintain the &quot;mudhif&quot;, the tribal guesthouse, which acts as the political, social, judicial and religious centre of Marsh Arabic life. The &quot;mudhif&quot; is used as a place to settle disputes, to carry out diplomacy with other tribes and as a gathering point for religious and other celebrations. It is also the place where visitors are offered hospitality. Although the tribal shaykh was the principal figure, each Ahwari village (which may have contained members of several different tribes) would also follow the authority of the hereditary &quot;qalit&quot; &quot;headman&quot; of a tribe&#x27;s particular section.

Blood feuds, which could only be settled by the &quot;qalit&quot;, were a feature of Marsh Arab life, in common with that of the Arab bedouin. Many of the Marsh Arabs&#x27; codes of behaviour were similar to those of the desert tribes.

Most Marsh Arabs lived in arched reed houses considerably smaller than a &quot;mudhif&quot;. The typical dwelling was usually a little more than two meters wide, about six meters long, and a little less than three meters high, and was either constructed at the waterside or on an artificial island of reeds called a &quot;kibasha&quot;; a more permanent island of layered reeds and mud was called a &quot;dibin&quot;. Houses had entrances at both ends and a screen in the middle; one end was used as a dwelling and the other end (sometimes extended with a &quot;sitra&quot;, a long reed structure) was used to shelter animals in bad weather. A &quot;raba&quot; was a higher-status dwelling, distinguished by a north-facing entrance, which also served as a guesthouse where there was no &quot;mudhif&quot;. Traditional boats (the &quot;mashoof&quot; and &quot;tarada&quot;) were used as transport: Ahwaris would drive buffalo through the reedbeds during the season of low water to create channels, which would then be kept open by constant use, for the boats.
The marsh environment meant that certain diseases, such as schistosomiasis and malaria, were endemic; Ahwari agriculture and homes were also vulnerable to periodic droughts and flooding.

==Literature==
Pietro Della Valle (1586–1652) is cited in Gavin Young&#x27;s &quot;Return to the Marshes&quot; as the earliest modern traveler to write about Mesopotamia and probably the first to introduce the word &quot;Madi&quot;, which he spelled &quot;Maedi,&quot; to the Western world.

Young also mentions George Keppel, 6th Earl of Albemarle (1799–1891) as having spent time with the Madan in 1824 and reported in detail on the marsh inhabitants. Of the men Keppel wrote, &quot;The Arab boatmen were as hardy and muscular-looking fellows as ever I saw. One loose brown shirt, of the coarseness of sack-cloth, was the only covering of the latter. This, when labour required it, was thrown aside, and discovered forms most admirably adapted to their laborious avocations; indeed, any of the boatmen would have made an excellent model for an Hercules; and one in particular, with uncombed hair and shaggy beard, struck us all with the resemblance he bore to statues of that deity.&quot; Of the women Keppel observed, &quot;They came to our boat with the frankness of innocence and there was a freedom in their manners, bordering perhaps on the masculine; nevertheless their fine features and well-turned limbs produced a &quot;tout ensemble&quot; of beauty, not to be surpassed perhaps in the brilliant assemblies of civilized life.&quot;

Another account of Ahwaris in English was jointly published in 1927 by a British colonial administrator, Stuart Edwin Hedgecock, and his wife. Gertrude Bell also visited the area. T. E. Lawrence had passed through in 1916, stopping at Basra and Ezra&#x27;s Tomb (Al-Azair), and recorded that the Marsh Arabs were &quot;wonderfully hard [...] but merry, and full of talk. They are in the water all their lives, and seem hardly to notice it.&quot;

The way of life of the Marsh Arabs was later described by the explorer Wilfred Thesiger in his classic &quot;The Marsh Arabs&quot; (1964). Thesiger lived with the Marsh Arabs for months at a time over a seven-year period (1951–1958), building excellent relationships with virtually all he met, and recording the details of day-to-day life in various regions of the marshes. Many of the areas that he visited have since been drained. Gavin Maxwell, the Scottish naturalist, travelled with Thesiger through the marshes in 1956 and published an account of their travels in his 1957 book &quot;A Reed Shaken by the Wind&quot; (later republished under the title &quot;People of the Reeds&quot;). The journalist and travel writer Gavin Young followed in Thesiger&#x27;s footsteps, writing &quot;Return to the Marshes: Life with the Marsh Arabs of Iraq&quot; (1977; reissued 2009).

The first extensive scholarly ethnographic account of Marsh Arab life was &quot;Marsh Dwellers of the Euphrates Delta&quot; (1962), by Iraqi anthropologist S. M. Salim. An ethnoarchaeological study of the material culture of the Marsh Arabs has been published by Edward L. Ochsenschlager: &quot;Iraq&#x27;s Marsh Arabs in the Garden of Eden&quot; (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, 2004).

Rory Stewart described the Marsh Arabs and his experiences as deputy governor in the Maysan province (2003–2004) in his 2006 book, &quot;The Prince of the Marshes&quot; (also published under the title &quot;Occupational Hazards&quot;).

In 2011, Sam Kubba published &quot;The Iraqi Marshlands and the Marsh Arabs: The Ma&#x27;dan, Their Culture and the Environment&quot;. The Iraqi Marshlands and the Marsh Arabs details the rich cultural legacy and lifestyle that survives today only as a fragmented cultural inheritance.

In German, there are Sigrid Westphal-Hellbusch und Heinz Westphal, &quot;Die Ma&#x27;dan: Kultur und Geschichte der Marschenbewohner im Süd-Iraq&quot; (Berlin: Duncker und Humblot, 1962). Sigrid Westphal Hellbusch and her husband Heinz Westphal wrote a comprehensive study on the Madan based on research and observation obtained while living with Madan tribes. These observations outline how the Madan diverge from other Shia communities.

<doc id="304738" wikidata="Q203310" url="?curid=304738" title="Doom 3">
<text>Doom 3 is a 2004 survival horror first-person shooter video game developed by id Software and published by Activision. &quot;Doom 3&quot; was originally released for Microsoft Windows on August 3, 2004, adapted for Linux later that year, and ported by Aspyr Media for Mac OS X in 2005. Developer Vicarious Visions ported the game to the Xbox, releasing it worldwide on April 4, 2005.

&quot;Doom 3&quot; is set on Mars in 2145, where a military-industrial conglomerate has set up a scientific research facility into fields such as teleportation, biological research, and advanced weapons design. The teleportation experiments open a gateway to Hell conducted by Doctor Betruger, resulting in a catastrophic invasion of the Mars base by demons. The player controls a space marine who fights through the base to stop the demons attacking Mars and reaching Earth.

&quot;Doom 3&quot; is the first reboot of the &quot;Doom&quot; series, ignoring the events of the previous games. &quot;Doom 3&quot; utilizes the id Tech 4 game engine, which has since been licensed out to other developers, and later released under the GNU General Public License v3.0 or later in November 2011.

&quot;Doom 3&quot; was a critical and commercial success; with more than 3.5 million copies of the game sold, it was the most successful game by developer id Software up to that date. Critics praised the game&#x27;s graphics, presentation, and atmosphere, although reviewers were divided by how close the gameplay was to that of the original &quot;Doom&quot;, focusing primarily on simply fighting through large numbers of enemy characters. The game was followed by &quot;Resurrection of Evil&quot;, an expansion pack developed by Nerve Software, in April 2005. A series of novelizations of &quot;Doom 3&quot;, written by Matthew J. Costello, debuted in February 2008. An expanded and remastered edition, Doom 3: BFG Edition, was released in the fourth quarter of 2012. It has been ported to various platforms, including some which enable portable and virtual reality gameplay.

==Gameplay==
===Single-player===
&quot;Doom 3&quot; is a story-driven action game played from a first-person perspective with occasional cutscenes in a third-person perspective. As with previous &quot;Doom&quot; games, the main objective is to successfully pass through its levels, defeating a variety of enemy characters intent on killing the player&#x27;s character. &quot;Doom 3&quot;″s more story-centered approach, however, means that the player often encounters friendly non-player characters, who provide key plot information, objectives and inventory items. The game incorporates ten weapons for the players use to survive, including conventional firearms such as a submachine gun, shotgun and grenades, experimental plasma weaponry, and the powerful BFG 9000 and chainsaw weapons of the &quot;Doom&quot; franchise. Enemies come in multiple forms and with different abilities and tactics, but fall into two broad categories of either zombies or demons. Zombies are humans possessed by demonic forces, who attack the player&#x27;s character using their hands and melee weapons or a variety of firearms, while demons are creatures from Hell, most of which attack using claws and spines, or by summoning plasma-based fireballs. The corpses of demons are reduced to ashes after death, leaving no trace of their body behind.

The game&#x27;s levels are semi-linear in nature and incorporate several horror elements, the most prominent of which is darkness. This design choice is not only intended to foster feelings of apprehension and fear within the player, but also to create a more threatening game environment in which the player is less likely to see attacking enemies. This aspect is further enhanced by the fact that the player must choose between holding a weapon and holding the flashlight (until the BFG editions released in 2012 made the &quot;duct tape mod&quot; a standard feature), forcing the player to choose between being able to see or having a readied weapon upon entering a room, which consequently leads to a more deliberate pace for the player. In addition, the levels are regularly strewn with corpses, chopped body parts and blood, sometimes used in conjunction with the game&#x27;s lighting to disorient the player.

Frequent radio transmissions through the player&#x27;s communications device also add to the atmosphere, by broadcasting certain sounds and messages from non-player characters meant to unsettle the player. Early in the game, during and directly after the event that plunges the base into chaos, the player often hears the sounds of fighting, screaming and dying through their radio transmitter. The ambient sound is extended to the base itself through such things as hissing pipes, footsteps, and occasional jarringly loud noises from machinery or other sources. Often ambient sounds can be heard that resemble deep breathing, unexplained voices and demonic taunting from the game&#x27;s antagonists.

Early in the game, the player is provided with a personal data assistant (PDA). PDAs contain security clearance levels, allowing the player to access certain areas that are otherwise locked and off-limits. Additionally, the PDA can be used to read e-mails and play audio logs or video discs that the player&#x27;s character acquires during the game. Whenever the player picks up any of the other PDAs found throughout the game, its contents are automatically downloaded to the player&#x27;s own device. Other PDAs often contain e-mails and audio logs for other characters, which can provide useful information such as storage or door key codes, as well as significant plot details.

===Multiplayer===
&quot;Doom 3&quot; was released with a four-player multiplayer element, featuring four game modes. However, the game&#x27;s community created a modification to boost this to eight or sixteen players. The &quot;Resurrection of Evil&quot; expansion would later officially increase the player limit to eight. The four game modes are all deathmatches. The standard deathmatch game mode involves each player moving around a level, collecting weaponry and killing the other players, with the player with the highest kills when the time runs out winning. A team variation of this involves the same principle. The third game mode is &quot;last man standing&quot;, in which each player has a limited amount of respawns, with players losing a life when they are killed. Eventually, all but one player will be eliminated from the game, leaving the survivor as the winner. The final game mode is &quot;tournament&quot;, in which two players fight each other while the other players watch as spectators. The victor of the battle remains in the arena, facing each other player one at a time until the winner of previous rounds is defeated. The loser then moves to the spectators and the new winner remains to fight the next player. The Xbox version of &quot;Doom 3&quot; also incorporates an additional two-player co-operative mode for the main single-player game.

As of April 15, 2010, the Xbox Live service was shut down, thus online multiplayer for the original Xbox game is no longer available.

==Synopsis==
===Setting===
&quot;Doom 3&quot; is set on the planet Mars in the year 2145. According to the game&#x27;s backstory, the Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC) has grown to become the largest corporate entity in existence with near-unlimited funds, and has set up a research facility on Mars. At this base, the UAC are able to conduct research into several scientific areas, including advanced weapons development, biological research, space exploration and teleportation, outside of legal and moral boundaries. As the player progresses through the game, they learn that the employees on the base are unsettled due to a large number of incidents involving hearing voices, unexplained sightings and increasing cases of paranoia and insanity, often leading to fatal accidents with the facility&#x27;s machinery. Rumors regarding the nature of experiments in the UAC&#x27;s Delta Labs division are especially prevalent among the base&#x27;s employees.

Much of &quot;Doom 3&quot;″s story and dialogue was written by author Matthew J. Costello.

===Characters===
There are five main characters in &quot;Doom 3&quot;. The player assumes the role of an anonymous Space Marine corporal who has just arrived on the UAC&#x27;s Mars base. The player&#x27;s non-commissioned officer in-charge is Master Sergeant Thomas Kelly (voiced by Neil Ross) who gives the player objectives and advice over the player&#x27;s radio for the first half of the game. The antagonist in the story is Dr. Malcolm Betruger (Philip L. Clarke), the head scientist of the UAC&#x27;s enigmatic Delta Labs division, who is revealed to be working in collaboration with the forces of Hell to cause the subjugation of humanity, and his demonic voice frequently taunts the player as the game progresses. The final two principal characters are Elliott Swann (Charles Dennis), a representative of the UAC&#x27;s board of directors, and Jack Campbell (Andy Chanley), a space marine who acts as Swann&#x27;s enforcer and is armed with a BFG 9000. Swann is sent to Mars to check up on Betruger&#x27;s research and investigate the rising number of accidents on the base after a request for assistance from a whistleblower. Swann is almost always accompanied by Campbell, and the two are often shown in the game to be a few steps ahead of the player, but cannot be reached and directly communicated with until late in the game. The game also incorporates a large host of minor characters who add details to the story or assist the player in certain segments. The player encounters multiple scientists involved in the various research and development programs and archaeological digs through the UAC base, as well as fellow marines and security guards. Civilian employees engaged in bureaucratic work and maintenance workers are also seen.

===Plot===
UAC board member Elliott Swann, his bodyguard Jack Campbell, and a recently transferred Marine arrive at Mars City, the main access to the UAC&#x27;s Mars base. Sent to investigate multiple incidents involving the Delta Complex, Swann has a tense meeting with facility director Dr. Malcolm Betruger while the Marine reports to Master Sergeant Thomas Kelly for orders. Kelly orders the Marine to find a scientist from the Delta Labs who has gone missing. The marine finds the scientist in a decommissioned communications facility, where he is frantically trying to send a warning to the UAC on Earth about Betruger&#x27;s teleportation experiments. However, as he tries to explain the situation to the marine, another teleportation test takes place but loses containment, at which point the entire Mars base is swept with a shockwave. The forces of Hell invade through the teleporter&#x27;s portal and transform most of the base&#x27;s personnel into zombies.

Now forced to fend off attacks from zombified base personnel and demons from Hell, the Marine returns to Mars City, where Kelly gives him orders to link up with another squad of marines and get a transmission card containing a distress call to the main communications facility to call for reinforcements. As the Marine progresses through the base, he learns that Swann and Campbell have survived, and are also en route to the communications facility to prevent any messages being sent in order to contain the situation on Mars. The marine squad is ambushed by demons and slaughtered in the EnPro Plant, and although the Marine recovers the transmission card, he is too late to prevent the bulk of equipment at the communications facility being destroyed by Campbell. However, Kelly directs the Marine to a backup system, where the Marine is given the choice of whether to obey Kelly&#x27;s orders to send for reinforcements, or accept Swann&#x27;s argument to keep Mars isolated until the nature of the invasion is understood, so as not to endanger Earth. The Marine is told to go to the Delta Labs by Kelly or Swann, depending on whether the transmission is sent or not.

On the way to the Delta Labs, the Marine is contacted by Betruger, who is now shown to be working in cooperation with Hell in order to invade Earth. If the Marine did not send the distress call to Earth, Betruger does so himself, hoping to use the ships bringing reinforcements to transport the demons to Earth. Betruger then unsuccessfully attempts to kill the Marine using the toxic gases in the base&#x27;s recycling facilities. Upon arriving at the Delta Labs, the Marine learns of the details behind the teleportation experiments, expeditions into Hell to retrieve specimens and Betruger&#x27;s increasing obsession with the tests, as well as of a xenoarchaeological dig under the surface of Mars. The dig is excavating the ruins of an ancient civilization discovered on Mars, and has produced a relic known as the Soul Cube. According to a scientist the Marine finds in the labs, the Soul Cube is a weapon created by the ancient civilization to defend against the forces of Hell. The scientist also reveals that the invasion began when Betruger took the Soul Cube into the portal at the beginning of the game, depositing it in Hell. The Marine pursues Betruger through the labs, but is pulled into the main teleportation portal after being lured into a trap by Betruger.

The portal takes the Marine directly into Hell, where he proceeds to fight his way through a large number of demons to the Soul Cube, defeating its demonic guardian. The Marine is then able to reinitialize the teleportation equipment left by previous research expeditions and return to the Delta Labs. Betruger, however, tells the Marine that although the main UAC teleporter has been destroyed, Hell is opening a Hellmouth on Mars, capable of bringing millions of demons to Mars. The Marine encounters the injured Swann, who informs him that Kelly has been working with Hell for possibly the whole time, and has been transformed by the demons. Telling the Marine that Campbell has gone after Kelly, Swann gives the marine his PDA containing information on the location on the Hellmouth under the surface of Mars and says that he will try to make his way out of the base alone.

However, when the Marine catches up with Campbell in the central computer processing sector of the base, Campbell is mortally wounded; before expiring, he says that Kelly has taken Campbell&#x27;s BFG 9000 weapon. Kelly then begins to taunt the marine in a demonic voice. The Marine eventually faces off with Kelly in the central computer core, revealing Kelly as a cybernetic human grafted onto a tank-like base. The Marine is able to kill Kelly and takes the BFG 9000 before proceeding deeper under the Martian surface to Site 3, the archaeological dig site where the Soul Cube was unearthed. At the primary excavation site, the Marine discovers the Hellmouth, defended by Hell&#x27;s mightiest warrior, the Cyberdemon. Using the Soul Cube, the Marine defeats the Cyberdemon, and the Soul Cube then seals the Hellmouth. The ending cut scene shows the reinforcements from Earth arriving at the base to discover the carnage. They find the Marine alive, but discover that Swann has died from his injuries. They are unable to locate Betruger, who in the final scene is shown in Hell, reincarnated as a dragon-like demon.

=== &quot;The Lost Mission&quot; ===
The player takes the role of the last surviving member of Bravo team, which was seen being ambushed by demons in &quot;Doom 3&quot;. The Bravo team survivor is contacted by Dr. Richard Meyers (voiced by Paul Eiding), a scientist working on teleportation experiments in Exis Labs, and asked to help Meyers destroy an experimental teleportation array that was captured by the demons and is currently held deep inside Hell. The array is potentially powerful enough to send an army of demons all the way to Earth, hence Meyers&#x27; desperation to destroy it. To achieve this goal, the marine must acquire the components necessary to activate the Exis Labs teleportation system, then travel to Hell in order to destroy the teleportation array. In the epilogue, the marine is teleported by Dr. Meyers back to Mars. The reinforcements from Earth arrive to search for another marine who is still missing; eventually, they find him in the Delta Labs complex.

==Development==
===Production===
In June 2000, id Software&#x27;s game engine designer John Carmack, posted an internal company plan announcing a remake of &quot;Doom&quot; using next generation technology. This plan revealed controversy had been growing within id Software over remaking &quot;Doom&quot;. Kevin Cloud and Adrian Carmack, two of id Software&#x27;s owners, were always strongly opposed to remaking &quot;Doom&quot;, believing that id was going back to the same formulas and properties too often. However, after the positive reception to &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot; and the latest improvements in rendering technology, most of the employees agreed that a remake was the right idea and presented the two owners with an ultimatum: allow them to remake &quot;Doom&quot; or fire them. After the reasonably amicable confrontation (although artist Paul Steed, one of the instigators, was fired in retaliation), the agreement to work on &quot;Doom 3&quot; was made. id Software began development on &quot;Doom 3&quot; in late 2000, immediately after finishing &quot;Quake III: Team Arena&quot;. The game was made by 20 to 22 people. The game&#x27;s development budget was $10 million. In February 2001, it was unveiled to the public by Steve Jobs (CEO of Apple at the time when it unveiled) in Macworld Conference &amp; Expo/Tokyo 2001 along with the GeForce 3 at Makuhari Messe and was later demonstrated at E3 2002 at LACC, where a fifteen-minute gameplay demo was shown. It won five awards at E3 that year. 

Early in &quot;Doom 3&quot;″s development, Trent Reznor of the band Nine Inch Nails, a fan of the &quot;Doom&quot; games and composer for id&#x27;s earlier title &quot;Quake&quot;, was set to compose the music and sound effects to &quot;Doom 3&quot;. However, due to &quot;time, money and bad management&quot;, none of Trent Reznor&#x27;s sound effects or music made the final product. Eventually, Nine Inch Nails&#x27; former drummer, Chris Vrenna, produced and fellow Tweaker band member Clint Walsh composed the game&#x27;s soundtrack.

&quot;Doom 3&quot; was also intended to be more storyline-focused than previous id titles, as was demonstrated by the developers&#x27; conscious effort to have more professional voice acting. Late in 2002, two employees at ATI Technologies leaked a development version of &quot;Doom 3&quot; onto the Internet. One year later, a new trailer was shown at E3 2003 and soon afterwards id Software&#x27;s website was updated to showcase &quot;Doom 3&quot; as an upcoming project, although it was also announced that &quot;Doom 3&quot; would not be ready for the 2003 holiday season. According to John Carmack, the development took longer than expected. The developer Splash Damage assisted in design for the multiplayer elements of the game. Around 3,000 beta testers on site provided feedback via QuakeCon. The game&#x27;s crunch period was between January and August 2004.

===Technology===
According to John Carmack, the lead graphics engine developer at id Software, the technology of &quot;Doom 3&quot; was supported by three primary features: unified lighting and shadowing, complex animations and scripting that showed real-time with fully dynamic per-pixel lighting and stencil shadowing, and GUI surfaces that add extra interactivity to the game. The key advance of the id Tech 4 graphics engine developed for &quot;Doom 3&quot; is the unified lighting and shadowing. Rather than computing or rendering lightmaps during map creation and saving that information in the map data, most light sources are computed in real-time. This allows lights to cast shadows even on non-static objects such as monsters and machinery, which was impossible with static non-directional lightmaps. A shortcoming of this approach is the engine&#x27;s inability to render soft shadows and global illumination.

To increase the interactivity with the game world, id Software designed hundreds of high-resolution animated screens for in-game computers. Rather than using a simple &quot;use key&quot; to operate these computers, the crosshair acts as a mouse cursor over the screens allowing the player to use a computer in the game world. This allows for an in-game computer terminal to perform more than one function, from operating security door codes, activating machinery, toggling lights or unlocking weapons lockers. According to the &quot;Doom 3&quot; manual, GUI designer Patrick Duffy wrote over 500,000 lines of script code, and generated more than 25,000 image files to create all of the graphical interfaces, computer screens, and displays throughout &quot;Doom 3&quot;. Other important features of the game engine are normal mapping and specular highlighting of textures, realistic handling of object physics, a dynamic, ambient soundtrack, and multi-channel sound. &quot;Doom 3&quot; on Xbox supports 480p widescreen video display resolution and Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.

==Release==
&quot;Doom 3&quot; achieved gold status on July 14, 2004 and a Mac OS X release was confirmed the next day. &quot;Doom 3&quot; was released in the United States on August 3, 2004, and to the rest of the world on August 13. Due to high demand, the game was made available at select outlets at midnight on the date of release. Additionally, a Linux version was released on October 4, 2004, by Timothee Besset. The Mac OS X version was released on March 14, 2005, and on February 20, 2006, the patch 1.3 Rev A included a universal binary, adding support for Mac OS X on the x86 architecture. Finally, the modified Xbox conversion was released on April 4, 2005, featuring a limited steel book edition and two games including &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot; and &quot;Doom II: Hell on Earth&quot;.

A week before the game&#x27;s release, it became known that an agreement to include EAX audio technology in &quot;Doom 3&quot; reached by id Software and Creative Labs was heavily influenced by a software patent owned by the latter company. The patent dealt with a technique for rendering shadows called Carmack&#x27;s Reverse, which was developed independently by both John Carmack and programmers at Creative Labs. id Software would have placed themselves under legal liability for using the technique in the finished game, so to defuse the issue, id Software agreed to license Creative Labs sound technologies in exchange for indemnification against lawsuits.

During the keynote address at QuakeCon 2011, John Carmack announced that the source code for the &quot;Doom 3&quot; engine would be released. The source code was open-sourced under the GNU GPL-3.0-or-later on November 22, 2011. It contains minor tweaks to the shadow rendering code to avoid potential patent infringement with a patent held by Creative Labs. Art assets such as 3D models, music, sound effects etc. remain subject to the EULA.

===Downloadable content===

On April 4, 2005, eight months after the release of &quot;Doom 3&quot;, id Software released an expansion pack for &quot;Doom 3&quot; on Windows. The expansion, entitled &quot;Resurrection of Evil&quot;, was developed by Nerve Software, a company that had partnered with id Software on several other projects, including &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot; and the Xbox conversion of &quot;Doom&quot;. Once again published by Activision, a Linux version was released on May 24, 2005, and an Xbox version followed on October 5, 2005. The expansion featured a new twelve-level single-player campaign, set two years after the original storyline, as well as three new weapons, one of which is geared towards manipulating the physics in the game. Several new enemy characters were also introduced. Multiplayer gameplay was enhanced, officially increasing the player limit to eight and adding new game modes such as capture the flag. &quot;Resurrection of Evil&quot;″s reception was not as positive as it had been for &quot;Doom 3&quot;, but still received generally favorable reviews from the industry&#x27;s critics.

===Mobile version===

In 2009, Escalation Studios released a spin-off of &quot;Doom 3&quot; for iOS called &quot;Doom Resurrection.&quot; It is a rail shooter much like &quot;Time Crisis&quot; or &quot;The House of the Dead.&quot; It was removed from the App Store a few years later.

===&quot;BFG Edition&quot;===

A re-release of &quot;Doom 3&quot; called &quot;Doom 3: BFG Edition&quot;, published by Bethesda Softworks, was released on October 15, 2012, in Australia, October 16, 2012, in North America and October 19, 2012, in Europe. The &quot;BFG Edition&quot; features enhanced graphics, better sound with more horror effects, a checkpoint save system, support for 3D displays and HMDs, and the ability to use the flashlight while holding a weapon, in the form of the so-called &quot;armor-mounted flashlight&quot;. Also included are the previous expansion pack &quot;Resurrection of Evil&quot;, a new single-player expansion called &quot;The Lost Mission&quot;, and copies of the original &quot;Doom&quot; (the &quot;Ultimate Doom&quot; edition with the add-on fourth episode, &quot;Thy Flesh Consumed&quot;) and &quot;Doom II&quot; (with the expansion &quot;No Rest for the Living&quot;, previously available only for the Xbox 360). The versions of &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Doom II&quot; released with the &quot;BFG Edition&quot; have undergone cultural sensitivity censorship. PC versions of &quot;Doom 3: BFG Edition&quot; other than the GOG.com release require the Steam client and a valid Steam account for installation, play and achievements.

On June 4, 2015, &quot;Doom 3: BFG Edition&quot; was released for Nvidia Shield Tablet and Nvidia Shield TV without online multiplayer. On July 26, 2019, &quot;Doom 3: BFG Edition&quot; was released as &quot;Doom 3&quot; for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One without online multiplayer. On March 29, 2021, &quot;Doom 3: BFG Edition&quot; was released as &quot;Doom 3: VR Edition&quot; for PlayStation 4 via PlayStation VR without online multiplayer.

==Reception==

=== Critical ===
&quot;Doom 3&quot; received a favorable reception from critics, with the PC version of the game holding an 87 percent score and an 88 percent score at the review compilation sites Metacritic and GameRankings respectively. Much praise was given to the quality of &quot;Doom 3&quot;″s graphics and presentation; &quot;GameSpot&quot; described the game&#x27;s environments as &quot;convincingly lifelike, densely atmospheric, and surprisingly expansive&quot;, while &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; described the graphics and non-player character modeling and animation as simply &quot;flawless&quot;, stating that &quot;Doom 3&quot; signalled the return of the &quot;Doom&quot; franchise to the forefront of the computer and video game industry, eleven years after the release of the original &quot;Doom&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Dan Adams noted that the game&#x27;s presentation comprised a remarkably high proportion of the game, stating that &quot;without the atmosphere, &quot;Doom 3&quot; is a plain shooter that hearkens back to those of the &#x27;90s.&quot; In addition, several reviewers praised id Software for making the game still look surprisingly good even on lower graphics levels.

A number of reviewers also praised the attention paid to the game&#x27;s premise and setting; GameSpot&#x27;s Greg Kasavin described getting &quot;the impression that &quot;Doom 3&quot; takes place in a fully realized world&quot; while &quot;IGN&quot; noted that &quot;the UAC base also has a very worn and lived-in feel that adds to the realism.&quot; &quot;Eurogamer&quot; in particular pointed out that the game&#x27;s opening sequence &quot;feels like a fitting tribute to the excellent ideas&quot; of Valve&#x27;s genre-defining &quot;Half-Life&quot;.

Many reviewers noted that &quot;Doom 3&quot; stuck with a similar &quot;run and gun&quot; gameplay style that was successful with its predecessors, and the game was alternately praised and criticized for this element. Several reviews were critical of a perceived repetitiveness in gameplay after a while. In addition, the game&#x27;s artificial intelligence was not regarded as particularly challenging, with GameSpot noting that &quot;enemies follow the same sorts of predictable patterns that [players] may remember from previous &quot;Doom&quot; games&quot; while &quot;GameSpy&quot; stated the way enemies would spawn to attack the player was &quot;gimmicky&quot;; the reviewer noted that players would realize that picking up a lone armor vest would cause a variety of zombies to emerge from hidden compartments in the dark. In addition, several reviewers noted that the game&#x27;s methods of conveying the story were &quot;ineffectual&quot;, compounded by the lack of an identity for the player character. Finally, the game&#x27;s multiplayer was seen as lacking in innovation, with its low player limits and small number of game modes, particularly in contrast to id Software&#x27;s influential &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;.

The Xbox version of &quot;Doom 3&quot; received a similar level of critical support, holding a score of 88 percent on Metacritic and an 87.7 percent score on GameRankings. The game was praised and faulted on many of the same issues as the PC version, although the game was praised for maintaining smooth and user-friendly controls on a gamepad, as well as for including a two player co-operative multiplayer mode, which IGN described as &quot;worth the price of admission alone.&quot; However, some criticism was directed towards slowdowns in play due to the game engine, despite being scaled down for the Xbox, still being demanding on the Xbox hardware.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; named &quot;Doom 3&quot; the best computer game of August 2004, and later gave the game its annual &quot;Best Graphics, Technical&quot; prize. &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; nominated the game for its &quot;Best Technology&quot; award in 2005, which ultimately went to &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;. During the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Doom 3&quot; for &quot;Computer Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Computer First-Person Action Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Innovation in Computer Gaming&quot;, and outstanding achievement in &quot;Art Direction&quot;, &quot;Sound Design&quot;, and &quot;Visual Engineering&quot;.

==== BFG Edition ====
The &quot;BFG Edition&quot; received mixed reviews in comparison. The rework of the graphics and sound design, and inclusion of the new &quot;Lost Mission&quot; content were praised. Most criticisms were aimed toward long loading times, forced auto-saves, and a control scheme which forces the player to cycle through their weapons continuously instead of bound to hotkeys as in the original release.

===Sales===
&quot;Doom 3&quot; was a commercial success for id Software. id expected to sell 4 million copies of the game. In the United States, the computer version sold 760,000 copies and earned $32.4 million (~$ in ) by August 2006. It was the country&#x27;s 16th best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. Its computer version also received a &quot;Gold&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. By the beginning of 2007, over 3.5 million copies of &quot;Doom 3&quot; had been sold worldwide (compared to 2-3 million copies sold for the original &quot;Doom&quot; and 2 million for &quot;Doom II&quot;), making it the most successful project by id Software at the time.

==Legacy==
In early 2008, a new series of &quot;Doom&quot; novels by Matthew J. Costello were published, an author who had worked on the story and scripts for &quot;Doom 3&quot; and &quot;Resurrection of Evil&quot;; previous &quot;Doom&quot; novels had expanded the storyline of the original two &quot;Doom&quot; games. The series of books aims to novelize the story of &quot;Doom 3&quot;, with the first installment, &quot;Worlds on Fire&quot;, published on February 26, 2008. The second book in the series, &quot;Maelstrom&quot;, was released in March 2009.

The game engine for &quot;Doom 3&quot;, id Tech 4, has been licensed out for the use of other developers, such as in Human Head Studios&#x27; &quot;Prey&quot;, Raven Software&#x27;s &quot;Quake 4&quot;, Splash Damage&#x27;s &quot;Enemy Territory: Quake Wars&quot;, Raven Software&#x27;s &quot;Wolfenstein&quot;, and Splash Damage&#x27;s &quot;Brink&quot;; however id Tech 4 has not been widely licensed compared to Epic Games&#x27; Unreal Engine. On November 22, 2011, the source code of the engine was released under the GNU GPL-3.0-or-later, but the game&#x27;s artwork content still remains under the EULA. A later source code drop also included the changes made for the &quot;BFG Edition&quot;, allowing the re-release to potentially be ported to other previously unsupported platforms such as Linux and OS X, and such a port was eventually released.

===&quot;Doom&quot; (2016)===
id Software eventually went on to release another title in the series, this time following the series&#x27; original roots in minimal storytelling and fast-paced action. Development was announced in 2008, then slated to run on the id Tech 5 engine and initially titled &quot;Doom 4&quot;. Titled just &quot;Doom&quot; and powered by the id Tech 6, the game was released in 2016 by Bethesda Softworks for Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 with cross-platform support in its &quot;Snapmap&quot; multiplayer mode. A Nintendo Switch version was released in 2017. It is considered a continuation of the original &quot;Doom&quot; storyline.

<text>The Patterdale Terrier is a breed of dog descended from the Northern terrier breeds of the early 18th century, originally bred in Patterdale, Lake District.

== Description ==

===Appearance===

There are two breed standards for the Patterdale Terrier belonging to the United Kennel Club (UKC) and the American Dog Breeders Association (ADBA), both in the United States, since the United Kingdom Kennel Club does not recognize the Patterdale Terrier.

The UKC standard states that dogs are between 25 and 38 centimetres tall, and specifies that dogs should be in fit, working condition. The UKC standard further specifies:

====Coat and colour====
The coat may be one of three types: &quot;smooth,&quot; &quot;broken,&quot; or &quot;rough.&quot; 
* Smooth coat: Short, glossy hair. Undercoat still usually present.
* Broken coat: Coarse. May be some longer whiskering on muzzle and chin.
* Rough coat: Longer hair overall, including face, ears, and muzzle. Very thick, protective double coat.

All coat types should have dense and coarse double coats that are harsh to the touch and weatherproof.

Colours include black, red, bronze, black and tan, chocolate, liver, or even liver and tan and occasionally brindle, but never fully white. Any other colours, or larger patches of white away from the chest, are indicative of cross-breeding, particularly with the Jack Russell Terrier. It is traditional for a Patterdale terrier to be of solid colour, with no white markings.

=== Temperament ===
Patterdale Terrier puppies tend to be bold and confident beyond their capabilities. The Patterdale is known as a working terrier, rather than a show dog. Typical of terriers, whose work requires high energy and a strong drive to pursue prey, Patterdales are very energetic and can be difficult to socialize. Though also kept as pets, due to being bred for high-intensity work, they may tend towards being too energetic for a sedentary household life.

== History and overview==

The origins of the breed can be traced back to the cross breeding of The Old English Terrier (the original black terrier) and the Northumberland Pit Terrier (now extinct) and later to the Lake District, specifically to Ullswater Hunt master Joe Bowman, an early Border Terrier breeder. where he used the best Red Fell terriers and the best local hunting terriers available to him, so that he could continue his efforts to refine the breed even further.

The breed did not gain notability until Cyril Breay, a schoolmaster and huntsman, refined them even further, using the best dogs of northern England. It is believed that all current Patterdale Terriers descend from dogs bred by Breay.

The Patterdale Terrier is more of a &quot;type&quot; rather than a &quot;breed&quot;, being the result of a culmination of working terrier breeds indigenous to the United Kingdom. Patterdale Terrier Type dogs were bred by poachers across northern England. As well as others, for the hunting and dispatch of the red fox in the rocky fells around the Lake District, North West and North East of England where a traditional digging dog was not always of great use. Patterdale Terriers have also been used for illegal badger baiting in the UK.

The Patterdale was developed in the harsh environment in the north of England, an area unsuitable for arable farming and mostly too hilly for cattle. Sheep farming is the predominant farming activity on these hills. Since the fox is perceived by farmers as being predatory with respect to sheep and small farm animals, terriers are used for predator control. Unlike the dirt dens found in the hunt country of the south, the rocky dens found in the north do not allow much digging. As a consequence, the terrier needs to be able to bolt the fox from the rock crevice or dispatch it where it is found.

The use of &quot;hard&quot; dogs to hunt foxes in this way was made illegal in England and Wales by the Hunting Act 2004, as it runs counter to the code of practice under the Act.

The Patterdale made its way to the United States, where it is used for groundhog, raccoon, fox and nutria with great success. Patterdale Terriers, considered highly adaptable, excel worldwide not just at hunting a wide array of quarry, but in a number of canine sports, such as dog agility and terrier racing. In the US, the Patterdale Terrier was recognised by the United Kennel Club on January 1, 1995, but remains unrecognized by the American Kennel Club.

<text>John Bell Hatcher (October 11, 1861 – July 3, 1904) was an American paleontologist and fossil hunter known as the &quot;king of collectors&quot; and best known for discovering &quot;Torosaurus&quot; and &quot;Triceratops&quot;, two genera of dinosaurs described by Othniel Charles Marsh. He was part of a new, professional middle class in American science, having financed his education with his labor while also being more educated than older fossil collectors. As such, he faced unique challenges throughout his long and productive career.

==Early life==
Hatcher was born on October 11, 1861, in Cooperstown, Illinois, to John B. Hatcher (b. 1835) and Margaret Columbia O&#x27;Neal (b. 1842). When Hatcher was young, his father, who was both a farmer and a schoolteacher, moved the family to Cooper, Iowa. There he received his early education from his father and local schools.

=== Education ===
He first took an interest in paleontology and geology while working as a coal miner to save money for school and discovering fossils of ancient organisms. He matriculated at Grinnell College in 1880 or 1881, then transferred to Yale University&#x27;s Sheffield Scientific School in 1882, in part because of the school&#x27;s esteemed faculty which included James Dwight Dana, a well-renowned professor of geology. After receiving an education in geology, mineralogy, zoology, and botany, Hatcher graduated with a bachelor of philosophy degree from the &quot;Sheff&quot; in 1884 with the graduation thesis &quot;On the Genus of Mosses termed &quot;Conomitrium&quot;.&quot; Before graduating, he showed his coal mines collection of Carboniferous fossils to George Jarvis Brush, professor of metallurgy and director of the Sheffield Scientific School, who then introduced him to the paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh.

==Career==
===Yale University &amp; the United States Geological Survey===
Embroiled with a passion for collecting fossils, Hatcher was hired by Marsh in 1884, for the initial sum of US$50 per month. His first assignment was to work under the supervision of Charles Hazelius Sternberg to collect materials from a site in Long Island, Kansas, dubbed the &quot;Long Island Rhino Quarry&quot; by biographer Lowell Dingus. Hatcher, with his formal education and training from Marsh, proved to be careful worker and was skilled in excavating fossils with less damage than other collectors inflicted. Based on his excavation methods at this site, Hatcher has been credited with being the first to develop a grid system of numbered squares over a dig site, using the grid map to record the exact locations from where specimens were excavated. This kind of map system is considered the basis of the discipline of Taphonomy. The Long Island Rhino Quarry yielded many specimens over various excavations, including fossils of the genus now known as &quot;Teleoceras&quot;.

Hatcher was in Marsh&#x27;s employ until 1893, and he excelled in fossil fieldwork throughout the Western states. In 1889 near Lusk, Wyoming, Hatcher excavated the first fossil remains of &quot;Torosaurus&quot;. Hatcher was eventually unhappy at Yale, in part because of Marsh&#x27;s policy of not allowing assistants to publish on their own. In Hatcher&#x27;s correspondence to Marsh, he cited Marsh&#x27;s failure to obtain for him a permanent position either with Yale University or the United States Geological Survey, as well as constant fieldwork with no breaks to work on his collections, as his reasons for seeking other employment.

In 1890, Hatcher asked William Berryman Scott of Princeton University for a position, but was not successful due to funding. He next negotiated with Henry Fairfield Osborn for a position at the American Museum of Natural History, but ultimately signed a contract with Marsh to work as an assistant in geology at the Peabody Museum of Natural History from 1891 to 1896; the contract also gave him the freedom to work with his collections when not in the field. However, in 1892, funding of the United States Geological Survey was dramatically cut by Congress, and Marsh could no longer pay Hatcher to collect for him in the West. After some negotiations, their contract ended early in 1893.

===Princeton University===
In 1893, with a letter of recommendation from Marsh, after fielding offers from Princeton University and the Philadelphia Academy of Sciences he began a seven-year employ at Princeton University under William Berryman Scott as curator of vertebrate paleontology in the Elizabeth Marsh Museum of Geology and Archaeology and assistant in geology, leading ongoing Princeton Scientific Expeditions during field season and instructing students in geology, paleontology, and field techniques. Although he had already authored two publications related to his collections while still at Yale, between 1893 and 1896 he authored eleven publications while at Princeton, fulfilling one of his long-held desires to work with his collections and write about his findings. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1897.

In 1896, Hatcher conceived of, planned, and secured the greater part of the funding for three expeditions to Patagonia, as well as the idea of publishing the results of the expeditions with funding from J. Pierpont Morgan. In the 1896 expedition he was joined by his brother-in-law Olaf A. Peterson whom he hired away from the American Museum of Natural History to the dissatisfaction of Osborn. On the second expedition in 1897, taxidermist A. E. Coldburn accompanied Hatcher. For the third expedition, a young Barnum Brown of the American Museum of Natural History accompanied Hatcher, owing to Osborn&#x27;s arrangement with Scott. The trips were chronicled in the &quot;Princeton University Expeditions to Patagonia, 1896-1899&quot;. Hatcher produced twelve publications between 1897 and 1903 related to these expeditions. Because of the similarity of the flora and fauna in Patagonia and Australia, he concluded that the two were once connected by land.

Hatcher resigned from Princeton in 1899, departing his position in 1900.

===Carnegie Museum of Natural History===

Beginning in 1900, with recommendations from Dana, Marsh, Scott, and Yale President Timothy Dwight, Hatcher was hired by William Jacob Holland as curator of paleontology and osteology for the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, succeeding Jacob Lawson Wortman. Hatcher supervised William Harlow Reed and hired Charles Whitney Gilmore during his time at the Carnegie Museum. In addition to supervising field expeditions and excavations, he was responsible for the scientific investigation and display of &quot;Diplodocus carnegii&quot;, a species named by Hatcher for his patron Andrew Carnegie (1835–1919), the Scottish-American industrialist. Finished in 1907, casts of &quot;Dippy&quot; were sent to museums in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Austria, Italy, Russia, Spain, Argentina, and Mexico. Hatcher&#x27;s monograph on the find was published in 1901 as &quot;Diplodocus Marsh: Its Osteology, Taxonomy, and Probable Habits, with a Restoration of the Skeleton&quot;.

After succeeding Marsh as the paleontologist for the United States Geological Survey, Osborn asked Hatcher to complete a monograph on Ceratopsia begun by Marsh, who had died a few years earlier. Hatcher agreed but died before the publication was complete; the work was finally completed by Richard Swann Lull in 1907 and included an illustration by famed paleoartist Charles R. Knight.

==Personal life==
Hatcher had six brothers and four sisters. Throughout his life, Hatcher suffered from health ailments. What was diagnosed as &quot;rheumatism&quot; during his lifetime is now thought by descendants to have been Type 1 osteogenesis imperfecta.

In 1887, Hatcher married Anna Matilda Peterson. They had seven children, three of whom did not reach adulthood.

Hatcher died in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on July 3, 1904, of typhoid fever.

==Legacy==
He is interred in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Homewood Cemetery. For 91 years his grave went unmarked (his widow and children moved back to Iowa after his death). However, at the 1995 annual meeting in Pittsburgh of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, some members bought him a headstone engraved with his name and the name of his daughter, Ruth, and the sandblasted image of &quot;Torosaurus&quot;.

Hatcher is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of South American lizard, &quot;Liolaemus hatcheri&quot;, and the scientific name of a notoungulate, &quot;Johnbell hatcheri.&quot;

<text>Samuel Alphonsius Stritch (August 17, 1887 – May 27, 1958) was an American Catholic prelate who served Archbishop of Chicago from 1940 to 1958 and as pro-prefect of the Congregation for Propagation of the Faith from March 1958 until his death two months later. He was elevated to the cardinalate by Pope Pius XII in 1946.

Stritch previously served as Archbishop of Milwaukee from 1930 to 1939 and as Bishop of Toledo from 1921 to 1930.

==Early life and education==
Samuel Stritch was born on August 17, 1887, in Nashville, Tennessee, to Garret (Gerard) (1839–1896) and Katherine (née O&#x27;Malley) Stritch. The O&#x27;Malley family immigrated to the United States from Ireland when Katherine was a young child. They settled in Louisville, Kentucky, where the family opened a boarding house. Garret was born in Ballyheigue, Kerry, in Ireland, but immigrated to Louisville from Dublin in 1879. 

Once in Louisville, Garret boarded with the O&#x27;Malley family; he married Katherine in 1880. The Stritch family later moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where Garret worked as the manager of the Sycamore Mill near Ashland City. The second youngest of eight children, Samuel had two brothers and five sisters. They all attended the Church of the Assumption in Nashville.

Considered a child prodigy, Samuel Stritch finished primary school at age ten and high school at age 14 in Nashville. Deciding to become a priest, Stritch in 1901 entered St. Gregory&#x27;s Preparatory Seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1903. 

Bishop Thomas Byrne of Nashville then sent Stritch to study at the Pontifical Urbaniana Athenaeum &quot;De Propaganda Fide&quot; in Rome, during which time he resided at the Pontifical North American College. He later earned his doctorates in philosophy and in theology. While in Rome, Stritch befriended Monsignor Eugenio Pacelli, who later became Pope Pius XII.

==Priesthood==
Stritch was ordained to the priesthood for the Diocese of Nashville by Cardinal Pietro Respighi on May 21, 1910, at the Basilica of St. John Lateran in Rome. At age 22, Stritch was below the age requirement for ordination, but Pope Pius X granted him a dispensation. He remarked that, &quot;[Stritch] is young in years but old in intelligence. Let him be ordained.&quot;

After Stritch returned to the United States, the diocese assigned him in 1911 as pastor of St. Patrick&#x27;s Church in Memphis. Byrne named him as his private secretary in 1913 and as a diocesan chancellor in 1917. The Vatican appointed Stritch as a domestic prelate in May 1921.

==Episcopal career==

===Bishop of Toledo===
On August 10, 1921, Stritch was appointed the second bishop of Toledo by Pope Benedict XV. He received his episcopal consecration at the Cathedral of Saint Francis de Sales in Toledo on November 30, 1921, from Archbishop Henry K. Moeller, with Bishops John Morris and Thomas Molloy serving as co-consecrators.

During his tenure in Toledo, Stritch established Mary Manse College, a women&#x27;s college in Toledo in 1922. He incorporated the diocesan branch of Catholic Charities in 1923. Stritch laid the cornerstone in 1926 of the new Holy Rosary Cathedral in Toledo.

While in Toledo, Stritch presided at the confirmation of the future comedian Danny Thomas. Stritch would mentor Thomas throughout his life and urged him, a Tennessee native, to locate St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital, Thomas&#x27; main charity, in Memphis, Tennessee.

===Archbishop of Milwaukee===

Following the death of Archbishop Sebastian Messmer, Stritch was named the fifth archbishop of Milwaukee on August 26, 1930 by Pope Pius IX. Stritch suffered from periods of depression early in his tenure as archbishop, but joined nationwide feelings of optimism with the 1932 election of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt. 

Stritch provided extensive support to the victims of the Great Depression. Due to the economic downturn, he refused to spend money restoring the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist, which was heavily damaged by fire in 1935, or St. Francis de Sales Seminary. Stritch once remarked &quot;As long as two pennies are ours, one of them belongs to the poor.&quot;&quot;

Stritch was an advocate for Catholic Action an international movement of lay people, and the Catholic Youth Organization. In November 1939, he was elected chairman of the National Catholic Welfare Conference, the predecessor of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. He also served as vice-chancellor of the Extension Society.

Stritch was an opponent of Reverend Charles Coughlin, a popular anti-Semitic radio broadcaster. Stritch in December 1939 wrote a letter to a Milwaukee rabbi that rebuked those who,&quot;...gain and hold a popular audience, degrade themselves and abuse the trust reposed in them by misquoting, half-quoting, and actually insinuating half-truths.&quot; 

===Archbishop of Chicago===
Despite Stritch&#x27;s protests, Pope Pius XII appointed him the fourth archbishop of Chicago, Illinois, on December 27, 1939. Succeeding the late Cardinal George Mundelein, Stritch was formally installed on January 3, 1940. Stritch was the personal choice of Apostolic Delegate Amleto Giovanni Cicognani for the post, although Roosevelt reputedly wanted Bishop Bernard Sheil instead.

In 1943, during World War II, Stritch signed a peace program developed by American Protestant, Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Jewish leaders. Pius XII created him as cardinal-priest of the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Agnese fuori le mura in Rome during the consistory of February 18, 1946. As archbishop of Chicago, Stritch oversaw the establishment of the first American chapter of the organization Opus Dei, the launching of the Christian Family Movement, and an outreach program to the Puerto Rican community.

In 1952, Stritch delivered the invocation at the opening session of the 1952 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, saying &quot;Today we face a crisis as grave as that of Valley Forge.&quot; Referring to communists and secularists, Stritch asked for divine protection against ;&quot;the aggression of those within and without of Godless enslaving political systems and of those who wittingly or unwittingly seek to take away our freedoms by their advocacy of materialism and Godless humanism.&quot;In 1954, Stritch issued a pastoral letter exhorting Catholics in his archdiocese to not attend the assembly of the World Council of Churches at Evanston, Illinois, writing, &quot;The Catholic Church does not...enter into any organization in which the delegates of many sects sit down in council or conference as equals...She does not allow her children to engage in any activity...based on the false assumption that Roman Catholics, too, are still searching for the truth of Christ,&quot; Stritch&#x27;s pastoral letter against ecumenism dismayed several Protestant and ecumenical figures. 

===Pro-Prefect of the Congregation for the Propagation of Faith===
On March 1, 1958, Pius XII appointed Stritch as pro-prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of Faith in Rome.

===Death===
In May 1958, while in Rome, Stritch suffered a blood clot on his right arm. Surgeons at the Sanatrix Clinic in that city were forced to amputate the arm above the elbow. On May 19th, Stritch suffered a stroke. He died eight days later at age 70.

After lying in state at the Pontifical North American College in Rome and then at the Cathedral of the Holy Name in Chicago, Stritch&#x27;s remains were interred in the Bishops&#x27; Mausoleum at Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois, on June 3rd.

In 1894 he was elected to fill the unexpired term of U.S. Representative Clifton R. Breckinridge. He served in the United States House of Representatives until 1907 when he resigned his seat to take office as Governor of Arkansas.

Little was inaugurated in January 1907, and shortly thereafter suffered a nervous breakdown which left him unable to execute his political duties. He was succeeded by the president of the Arkansas state senate, John Isaac Moore.

==Death==
Little left Arkansas and went to the Texas gulf coast in an effort to rehabilitate. Little never recovered and died in Little Rock, in the Arkansas State Hospital for Nervous Disorders. He is buried at the City Cemetery in Greenwood.

<text>Pennsylvania Route 179 (PA 179) and Route 179 is an state highway in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and Hunterdon County, New Jersey, United States, running along an old alignment of U.S. Route 202 (US 202) from west of New Hope, Pennsylvania, northeast through Lambertville, New Jersey, to Ringoes, where it ends at an intersection with US 202 and Route 31. Past this intersection, the road continues east as County Route 514 (CR 514). It is two-lane, undivided highway for most of its length with the exception of a four-lane stretch in Lambertville. The route crosses the Delaware River on the New Hope-Lambertville Bridge, where the designation changes from PA 179 to Route 179.

PA 179 and Route 179 follow a part of the 18th-century Old York Road which ran between Philadelphia and New York City. Prior to 1953, the road was Route S29 from the Delaware River to downtown Lambertville, a part of Route 29 between Lambertville and Ringoes, and a concurrency of Route 29 and Route 30 in Ringoes. The route was also part of US 202, which was designated over 1926-created US 122 in the mid-1930s. In 1953, the Route S29 and 29 designations were removed in favor of US 202 and Route 30 became Route 69 (now Route 31). Route 179 was formed in 1965 when a bypass for Ringoes was built for US 202 and Route 69. Route 179 extended to Lambertville and PA 179 was created in 1974 when the new US 202 freeway, running over the New Hope-Lambertville Toll Bridge, was completed.

==Route description==

===Pennsylvania===

PA 179 begins at an intersection with US 202 in Solebury Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, heading east on two-lane undivided West Bridge Street through commercial areas. The road crosses into the borough of New Hope and passes near a shopping center and more businesses. Farther east, the route gains a center left-turn lane and enters more residential surroundings as it passes New Hope-Solebury High School. From this point, PA 179 loses the center left-turn lane and passes more homes. Upon crossing the New Hope Railroad at-grade south of New Hope station and crossing over the Delaware Canal, the route heads into the downtown of New Hope and intersects PA 32. PA 179 continues east as East Bridge Street to the New Hope-Lambertville Bridge over the Delaware River.

===New Jersey===
At the middle of the New Hope-Lambertville Bridge, the road enters the city of Lambertville in Hunterdon County, New Jersey and becomes Route 179. It heads east through Lambertville on Bridge Street through the downtown area. At the intersection with Main Street, Route 29 joins Route 179 for a block, forming a wrong-way concurrency At the end of the concurrency, Route 29 turns south onto Route 165 and Route 179 turns north. From here the road continues northeast as the four-lane, undivided Thomas Paine Highway, entering West Amwell Township, where the road heads into farmland and narrows to two lanes. In East Amwell Township, the route intersects CR 603, CR 601, and CR 605 (Queen Road), which heads to an interchange with the US 202 freeway.

The road eventually forms the border between West Amwell and East Amwell Township. Route 179 intersects the US 202 freeway at a partial cloverleaf interchange, where the route is entirely in East Amwell Township. Past this interchange, the route runs along the West Amwell/East Amwell township line until it entirely enters East Amwell Township again and heads into the residential community of Ringoes. In Ringoes, Route 179 intersects the old Route 31 (now CR 579), forming a brief concurrency that lasts with that route until CR 579 heads north on John Ringo Road. Route 179 continues northeast through residential areas on Old York Road to its terminus at the combined US 202/Route 31, where Old York Road continues to the northeast as CR 514.

==History==
The current alignment of PA 179 and Route 179 was a part of Old York Road, a historical 18th-century road that connected Philadelphia to New York City. With the establishment of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, the route was designated as a part of US 122, which became US 202 in the mid-1930s. In Pennsylvania, the route was initially cosigned with PA 52; that designation was removed by 1930. Prior to the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, today&#x27;s Route 179 was composed of three state routes: Route S29, designated in 1949 from the New Hope-Lambertville Bridge into Lambertville, a part of Route 29 from Lambertville to Ringoes that was designated in 1927, and a concurrency of Routes 29 and 30 northeast from Ringoes that was also designated in 1927. In the original 1927 plan, Route 29 would have continued northeast from the end of Route 179 along current CR 514, but it was instead modified to continue north with Route 30 to Flemington and using what had been planned as Route 12 to Somerville.

In the 1953 renumbering, the Route S29 and Route 29 designations were removed from the route in favor of US 202, with Route 29 was realigned to follow former Route 29A to Frenchtown. In addition, Route 30 became Route 69 (now Route 31) to avoid conflicting with US 30 in South Jersey. The bypass of Ringoes for US 202 and Route 69 was opened in the 1960s, and Route 179 was designated along the old alignment of US 202 within Ringoes. The new US 202 freeway between the New Hope-Lambertville Toll Bridge and Route 179 southwest of Ringoes was completed in October 1974. As a result, Route 179 was extended along the old US 202 alignment to the state line in Lambertville and PA 179 was designated along the former US 202 through New Hope. Solebury Township is pushing for a roundabout at the intersection of US 202 and PA 179.

<text>County Route 583 (CR 583) is a county highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Its northern end is at an intersection with Route 27 in Princeton; its southern end is in a concurrency with U.S. Route 1 Business and U.S. Route 206 at an intersection with County Route 653 in Trenton.

The entire route is municipally-maintained except for its concurrency with US 206 where it is maintained by the Mercer County Department of Transportation.

==Route description==

CR 583 begins at the border of Trenton and Ewing Township along two-lane undivided Princeton Avenue (southbound US 206) just northeast of the Prichard Street intersection. From the southern terminus, the road runs northeast concurrent with southbound US 206 through residential and commercial areas, forming the border between Ewing Township to the northwest and Trenton to the southeast. The road crosses CR 622, widening to four lanes before entering Lawrence Township at the CR 613 intersection. In Lawrence Township, Princeton Avenue comes to the CR 645 intersection that provides access to the Brunswick Circle and US 1 Business. Past here, the road intersects the northbound direction of US 206 at Lawrenceville Road, and southbound US 206 splits from CR 583 to join with the northbound direction.

Past US 206, CR 583 becomes two-lane undivided Princeton Pike and continues through suburban residential neighborhoods. After an intersection with CR 546, the route passes business parks and widens into a divided highway as it reaches a cloverleaf interchange at I-295. This interchange has all movements except from southbound I-295 to southbound CR 583, which is provided by way of CR 546. Following this interchange, CR 583 becomes undivided again and heads into a mix of farms and woods. The road forms a brief concurrency with CR 569 as it heads into areas of woodland and residences. The road enters Princeton, where it becomes Mercer Street, and briefly gains a median prior to crossing CR 533. After this intersection, the route passes Princeton Battlefield State Park. Here, CR 583 passes through wooded residential areas as it comes to its northern terminus at Route 27 (Nassau Street) just to the east of Route 27&#x27;s southern terminus at US 206.

<text>Daniel Webster Jones (December 15, 1839December 25, 1918) was the 19th Governor of the U.S. state of Arkansas.

==Biography==
Jones was born in Bowie County, Texas to Isaac N. Jones, a doctor and member of the Congress of the Republic of Texas, and Elizabeth W. Littlejohn. When Jones was a year old, his family moved to Washington, Arkansas (Hempstead County where they owned a large plantation in nearby Lafayette County; Jones attended Washington Academy there and later studied law.

During his childhood, James Black, creator of the famous Bowie knife, lived with the Jones family before moving to Washington, Arkansas. Black attempted to show Daniel his metallurgical secret in 1870, the only person known to have knowledge of Black&#x27;s secret.

==Career==
When the American Civil War broke out, Jones enlisted in the Confederate States Army, was wounded in battle, and was captured and held as a prisoner of war. His highest rank was of Colonel of the 20th Arkansas Infantry Regiment.

In 1874, Jones was elected as prosecuting attorney of the Ninth Judicial District. He served as a presidential elector in 1876 and 1880. He was elected to the post of Attorney General of Arkansas in 1884 and 1886. In 1890, he served a term in the Arkansas House of Representatives.

Jones was elected Governor of Arkansas in 1896, and was reelected in 1898. During his term appropriations were made for the new state capitol building, and a law ordering uniform textbooks in schools was passed.

Jones resumed his law practice after leaving office. He was elected to the House of Representatives again in 1914. After his death his daughter inherited all his belongings. She then sold everything and gained over 2.6 million dollars.

==Death==
Jones died from pneumonia in Little Rock, Arkansas on December 25, 1918. He was buried with a Confederate States Army uniform with an attached American flag at the Oakland Cemetery in Little Rock.

<doc id="304774" wikidata="Q4291904" url="?curid=304774" title="Coincidence circuit">
<text>In physics and electrical engineering, a coincidence circuit or coincidence gate is an electronic device with one output and two (or more) inputs. The output activates only when the circuit receives signals within a time window accepted as &quot;at the same time&quot; and in parallel at both inputs. Coincidence circuits are widely used in particle detectors and in other areas of science and technology. 

Walther Bothe shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1954 &quot;...for his discovery of the method of coincidence and the discoveries subsequently made by it.&quot; Bruno Rossi invented the electronic coincidence circuit for implementing the coincidence method.

==History==
===Bothe and Geiger, 1924-1925===

In his Nobel Prize lecture, Bothe described how he had implemented the coincidence method in an experiment on Compton scattering in 1924. The experiment aimed to check whether Compton scattering produces a recoil electron simultaneously with the scattered gamma ray. Bothe used two point discharge counters connected to separate fibre electrometers and recorded the fibre deflections on a moving photographic film. On the film record he could discern coincident discharges with a time resolution of approximately 1 millisecond.

===Bothe and Kohlhörster, 1929===
In 1929, Walther Bothe and Werner Kolhörster published the description of a coincidence experiment with tubular discharge counters that Hans Geiger and Walther Müller had invented in 1928. The Bothe-Kohlhörster experiment showed penetrating charged particles in cosmic rays. They used the same mechanical-photographic method for recording simultaneous discharges which, in this experiment, signalled the passage of a charged cosmic ray particle through both counters and through thick wall of lead and iron that surrounded the counters. Their paper, entitled &quot;Das Wesen der Höhenstrahlung&quot;&quot;, was published in the &quot;Zeitschrift für Physik&quot; v.56, p.751 (1929).

===Rossi, 1930===
Bruno Rossi, at the age of 24, was in his first job as assistant in the Physics Institute of the University of Florence when he read the Bothe-Kohlhörster paper. It inspired him to begin his own research on cosmic rays. He fabricated Geiger tubes according to the published recipe, and he invented the first practical electronic coincident circuit. It employed several triode vacuum tubes, and could register coincident pulses from any number of counters with a tenfold improvement in time resolution over the mechanical method of Bothe. Rossi described his invention in a paper entitled &quot;Method of Registering Multiple Simultaneous Impulses of Several Geiger Counters&quot;, published in &quot;Nature&quot; v.125, p.636 (1930). The Rossi coincidence circuit was rapidly adopted by experimenters around the world. It was the first practical AND circuit, precursor of the AND logic circuits of electronic computers. 

To detect the voltage pulse produced by the coincidence circuit when a coincidence event occurred, Rossi first used earphones and counted the ‘clicks’, and soon an electro-mechanical register to count the coincidence pulses automatically. Rossi used a triple-coincidence version of his circuit with various configurations of Geiger counters in a series of experiments during the period from 1930 to 1943 that laid an essential part of the foundations of cosmic-ray and particle physics. 

About the same time, and independently of Rossi, Bothe devised a less practical electronic coincidence device. It used a single pentode vacuum tube and could register only twofold coincidences.

==Probability==
The main idea of &#x27;coincidence detection&#x27; in signal processing is that if a detector detects a signal pulse in the midst of random noise pulses inherent in the detector, there is a certain probability, formula_1, that the detected pulse is actually a noise pulse. But if two detectors detect the signal pulse simultaneously, the probability that it is a noise pulse in the detectors is formula_2. Suppose formula_3. Then formula_4. Thus the chance of a false detection is reduced by the use of coincidence detection.

<doc id="304790" wikidata="Q541170" url="?curid=304790" title="George Mundelein">
<text>George William Mundelein (July 2, 1872 – October 2, 1939) was an American Catholic who served as Archbishop of Chicago from 1915 until his death in 1939. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1924.

==Early life and ministry==

George Mundelein was born on Avenue C in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. He was the only son of Francis and Mary (née Goetz) Mundelein, who were of German descent; he had two sisters, Margaret and Catherine. George Mundelein&#x27;s grandfather fought in the American Civil War.

Mundelein received his early education at the parochial school of St. Nicholas Kirche in Manhattan. He attended La Salle Academy and Manhattan College, where he befriended Patrick Hayes (a future cardinal and archbishop of New York). Mundelein graduated from Manhattan College in 1889 with high honors. He then studied at St. Vincent Seminary in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the Pontifical Urbaniana University in Rome.

Mundelein was ordained to the priesthood for the Diocese of Brooklyn by Bishop Charles McDonnell on June 8, 1895.

After Mundelein returned to the United States, the Diocese assigned him to pastoral work in its parishes. He served as secretary to McDonnell until 1897. In 1897, Mundelein was appointed chancellor for the diocese.

==Auxiliary Bishop of Brooklyn==
On June 30, 1909, Mundelein was appointed auxiliary bishop of Brooklyn and titular bishop of Loryma by Pope Pius X. He received his episcopal consecration on September 21, 1909, from McDonnell, with Bishops Charles H. Colton and John O&#x27;Connor serving as co-consecrators, at St. James Cathedral-Basilica. At age 36, Mundelein was the youngest bishop in the country.

==Archbishop of Chicago==
Mundelein was named the third archbishop of Chicago on December 9, 1915, by Pope Benedict XV. The pope had originally intended to appoint Mundelein as bishop of the Diocese of Buffalo, with the more experienced Bishop Dennis Dougherty becoming archbishop of Chicago. However, the British government reportedly objected to having a bishop of German ancestry in Chicago, so close to the Canadian border, during World War I. To placate them, Benedict XV named Dougherty to Buffalo and Mundelein to Chicago.

Mundelein was formally installed as archbishop on February 9, 1916, and was appointed an assistant at the pontifical throne on May 8, 1920.

The archdiocese greatly expanded its charity outreach during the Great Depression, rivaling the efforts of Chicago&#x27;s Associated Jewish Charities. It established a city-wide network of St. Vincent de Paul Societies.

===Poison plot 1916===
At a large dinner held at the University Club of Chicago on February 12, 1916, chef Jean Crones slipped arsenic into the soup. His intent was to poison Mundelein and over 100 other guests, including Illinois Governor Edward F. Dunne. However, the potency of the arsenic was reduced because the kitchen staff was forced to water down soup to accommodate 50 extra guests. 

As the diners started exhibiting symptoms of arsenic poisoning, a doctor at the event prepared a makeshift emetic that the victims could drink to promote vomiting. Mundelein ate only a bite or two of the soup and was unharmed. There were no fatalities. Newspapers later referred to the incident as the &quot;Mundelein poison soup plot&quot;. 

Police were unable to apprehend Crones after the supper. Their investigation revealed that his real name was Nestor Dondoglio and that he belonged to the Galleanist circle of anarchists. 

===Catholic schools===
Almost half the Chicago population was Catholic by the 1920s. For decades, the parishes had been building and running their own schools, employing religious sisters as inexpensive teachers. The languages of instruction were often German or Polish. On taking office, Mundelein centralized control of the parish schools. The archdiocesan building committee now picked the locations for new schools while its school board standardized the school curricula, textbooks, teacher training, testing, and educational policies. Simultaneously he gained a voice in city hall, and Catholic William J. Bogan became superintendent of public schools.

==Cardinal==
Pope Pius XI created Mundelein as cardinal-priest of the Basilica of Santa Maria del Popolo in Rome during the consistory of March 24, 1924. With his elevation, Chicago became the first archdiocese west of the Allegheny Mountains to have a cardinal. In 1926, Mundelein presided over the 28th International Eucharistic Congress in Chicago.

In 1933, the Vatican appointed Mundelein as judge for the apostolic process for Mother Frances Cabrini&#x27;s cause for canonization.

Mundelein served as papal legate to the eighth National Eucharistic Congress in New Orleans, Louisiana, on September 13, 1938. He also served as a cardinal elector in the 1939 papal conclave that selected Pope Pius XII.

==Death==
Mundelein died from heart disease in his sleep on October 2, 1939, in Mundelein, Illinois (a village renamed in his own honor 14 years prior to his death), at age 67. He is buried behind the main altar of the chapel at Mundelein Seminary, which was founded on his initiative.

==Views==

===Church and politics===
Considered a liberal, Mundelein was a friend of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt and a supporter of Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal initiative. A staunch supporter of trade unions, Mundelein once remarked: 

===Film industry===
Mundelein commented on the film industry in 1934, saying, &quot;We don&#x27;t like the Mae West type ... The kind of film in which Will Rogers, Janet Gaynor, and Victor Moore appear is what we have in mind.&quot;

===Marriage===
In 1935, Mundelein said &quot;that not war, nor famine, nor pestilence have brought so much suffering and pain to the human race, as have hasty, ill-advised marriages, unions entered into without the knowledge, the preparation, the thought even an important commercial contract merits and receives. God made marriage an indissoluble contract, Christ made it a sacrament, the world today has made it a plaything of passion, an accompaniment of sex, a scrap of paper to be torn up at the whim of the participants.&quot; He was an outspoken opponent of artificial contraception.

===Ethnic groups===
During his tenure in Chicago, Mundelein launched an effort to unify ethnic Catholic groups such as the Poles and Italians into territorial, instead of ethnic, parishes with mixed success. St. Monica&#x27;s parish, however, was endorsed by Mundelein as the city&#x27;s sole black parish, leading to distaste for the archbishop in both the early 1900s and today. After constructing the landmark Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary in Chicago, Mundelein built St. Mary of the Lake Seminary, later renamed Mundelein Seminary in his honor, in what is now Mundelein, Illinois. Quigley Seminary was the site of Mundelein&#x27;s 1937 &quot;paper hanger&quot; speech, criticizing German Chancellor Adolf Hitler and other Nazi leaders. He also organized the construction of other churches in the see, such as the Saint Philip Neri church and the Corpus Christi Church, both designed by Chicago architect Joseph W. McCarthy. He publicly sparred with the Father Charles Coughlin, the Detroit Catholic priest who broadcast anti-banking and anti-Semitic views to millions of radio listeners until he was forced off the air in 1939.

<doc id="304792" wikidata="Q2340234" url="?curid=304792" title="Mobile Suit Gundam F91">
<text>is a 1991 anime film. It was &quot;Gundam&quot; creator Yoshiyuki Tomino&#x27;s attempt to launch a new &quot;Gundam&quot; saga, set 30 years after &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot;. He re-teamed with character designer Yoshikazu Yasuhiko and mecha designer Kunio Okawara for the occasion.

The film was first released in Japan on March 16, 1991.

==Plot==
The film is set 30 years after the events of &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot; and features an all-new cast of characters.

In the year UC 0123, the military arm of Cosmo Babylonia, the Crossbone Vanguard, attacks the Earth Federation colony Frontier IV. Student mechanic Seabook Arno and his friend Cecily Fairchild are caught in the middle of the fighting as the Federation garrison is quickly overwhelmed. Seabook and Cecily lead a group of refugees into the lower levels of the colony, where they meet up with Seabook&#x27;s father, Leslie. As the group boards a lifeboat, Seabook catches sight of Cecily&#x27;s father, Theo, attempting to abduct her and tries to intervene. However, the Crossbone Vanguard arrives and takes Cecily, who is actually Berah Ronah, part of the Ronah family who are the leaders behind Cosmo Babylonia. Seabook is forced to retreat to the lifeboat while Leslie stays behind to help a lost child.

Cecily is taken to meet her real father, Carozzo, and grandfather, Meitzer, who both dream of overthrowing the corrupt Earth Federation and replacing it with a more just aristocracy. Cecily is reluctant to join them, but feels she has no choice. Meanwhile, the lifeboat manages to reach the neighboring colony Frontier I, but it is also under attack by the Crossbone Vanguard. Seabook&#x27;s group then comes across the &quot;Space Ark&quot;, a Federation training ship carrying the inoperative Gundam F91. Due to the confusion caused by the Crossbone Vanguard&#x27;s surprise attack, the &quot;Space Ark&quot; is run by a barely experienced skeleton crew with no available pilots. Pressed into Federation service, Seabook works on repairing the F91 and discovers it was developed by his mother, Monica. The crew is able to repair the F91 just in time to repel an assault by the Crossbone Vanguard, forcing them to retreat.

Seabook then uses the F91 to return to Frontier IV, where Cosmo Babylonia has already repaired most of the damage to the colony and has fully occupied it. He infiltrates the Ronah estate and makes contact with Cecily. However, he is forced to flee without her when the guards pursue him. Leslie helps Seabook escape Frontier IV, but he suffers a mortal head injury in the process and dies on the return trip to Frontier I. Cecily joins the Crossbone Vanguard under Zabine Chareux&#x27;s command. He helps train Cecily to be a mobile suit pilot and warns her that there are several factions within Cosmo Babylonia working against each others&#x27; interests, with one faction working on a secret superweapon codenamed &quot;Bug&quot;. Seabook returns to Frontier I, where he is again forced by the Federation to help defend the colony against an impending attack by the Crossbone Vanguard. Instead, Seabook and the crew of the &quot;Space Ark&quot; secretly decide to desert and flee to the Moon.

Cecily is assigned the advanced Vigna Ghina mobile suit and accompanies the Crossbone Vanguard as they break into Frontier I. After a brief but intense skirmish, the Crossbone Vanguard are once again forced to withdraw. Seabook encounters Cecily in battle and she decides to defect upon discovering her friends are still alive. Carozzo then arrives at Frontier I and deploys the Bugs, automated war machines designed to specifically hunt down humans. He believes that Earth&#x27;s population must be purged to preserve its environment, and intends to use Frontier I as a testing ground for the Bugs. Seabook and Cecily work together to destroy the Bugs, with Cecily destroying their mothership. Angered, Carozzo deploys in his own mobile armor, the Rafflesia, and battles Seabook and Cecily. The Vigna Ghina is destroyed, ejecting Cecily into space, and Seabook destroys the Rafflesia in response. Zabine arrives on the scene, but decides to spare Seabook and the &quot;Space Ark&quot; due to his disagreement over Carozzo&#x27;s use of the Bugs and Rafflesia. After a desperate search, Seabook is able to find and rescue Cecily as the &quot;Space Ark&quot; arrives to pick them up.

==Voice cast==
==Development==
Originally planned as a full-length television series to mark the tenth anniversary of the Gundam franchise, &quot;Gundam F91&quot; hit a production snag due to staff disputes, and the project was stopped after the screenplays for the first thirteen episodes were written. It was then decided that what was made of the show would be condensed into a theatrical feature film.

A film adaptation in the Gundam franchise had not been created since &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot;. &quot;Gundam F91&quot; was developed with the goal of presenting a new era and new characters, at a time when SD Gundam was the representative of Gundam in film theaters. Tomino commented apart from the actual announcement of the work that the theme of the film would involve family matters.

Yoshikazu Yasuhiko and Kunio Okawara returned to work on the film with Tomino to recreate the core team from the original &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; series. Yasuhiko hadn&#x27;t done anything aside from character designs after &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, but he participated on the condition that he would get to help create the story like he did in the original. In the end, however, he did not participate in the story&#x27;s development, and instead arranged parts of the animation and designed and colored some elements, such as the normal suits (the space suits used in the film). Okawara returned from his design role in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ&quot; to design every mobile suit that appeared in the film The mobile suits he designed were ones that came from conversations with Tomino, much like how it was when they worked on the original series, but they found themselves disagreeing on how radically to change the design elements and theme. Okawara originally took care to keep the number of lines in his designs to a minimum, as the difficulty of animating them for a feature-length film would increase, but Sunrise requested that he use as many lines as he could.

The mobile suits for the film were designed to be smaller than usual—their sizes had been generally increasing up until &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot;, where the Gundam was 18 meters tall but the Nu Gundam was 22 meters. The average size was brought down to about fifteen meters in &quot;Gundam F91&quot;, with Tomino explaining that it would be easier for when the mobile suits were made into model kits, as they would be more easily posed with equally scaled human figures and easier to build dioramas around, the same reason he offered for another animation series he worked on, &quot;Aura Battler Dunbine&quot;. Tomino originally wanted to decrease the size to 10 meters, but it was set at 15 meters to meet the requirements of manufacturers.

In-universe, the shortening of mobile suits was explained as a way to combat the ever-growing costs of producing larger and larger mobile suits. In the same way, the model kits would also decrease in terms of manufacturing cost. In reality, however, as 1/144 scale model kits were becoming the norm instead of 1/100, the cost to develop new technology to color smaller kits and to create smaller, more articulated joints, among other things, actually drove the production cost up. However, this in-universe explanation met with dissatisfaction by fans of the franchise, especially the model kit fans, so after retaining the smaller size through &quot;Mobile Suit Victory Gundam&quot;, starting with &quot;Mobile Fighter G Gundam&quot; the mobile suits were gradually increased in size once again. By the release of &quot;Turn-A Gundam&quot; and &quot;G-Saviour&quot;, the titular mobile suits stood at 20 and 18 meters, respectively.

According to Tomino, the film was designed to be easier to understand than the somewhat confusing &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot;. The main character was a more easily understood hero, and the story ended on a happier note. The theme of &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot; involved Newtypes, but &quot;Gundam F91&quot; chose to go with the easily relatable concept of &quot;family problems&quot; as its main focus, which also made it easier to understand for newer fans of the series. As a result, Tomino has said that &quot;story-wise, the movie was a success.&quot; The first part of the film was presented in a clean, understandable way, but the second part got more chaotic, like &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot;, with situations only being explained with very brief dialogue – the layers of complicated story piled up, and in that sense it became a true successor to the &quot;Gundam&quot; film adaptations.

In the story, round, floating manslaughter weapons called &quot;Bugs&quot; were introduced in order to give more of a direct feel to the pain and violence depicted on screen than the poison gas used in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; and &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot;, though they had the same role of killing people. This is related to Tomino&#x27;s strong belief at the time that children were &quot;continuing to lose touch with real life.&quot;

&quot;Gundam F91&quot; was Sunrise&#x27;s first film that used wide-screen format materials for its production. Until then, all of Sunrise&#x27;s film productions had used normal-sized paper, which were then cut off at the top and bottom in order to adapt it to wide-screen.

==Release==
After the film&#x27;s release, the first six of eight of its film rolls smoothed out certain scenes, and about five minutes of footage was added to the last two rolls. They also had the voice actors re-dub the film, and finally released the &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot; on VHS as &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam F91: The Complete Version&quot;. The later DVD release contained both the original film version and the complete version. However, rolls 1 through 6 on the film version are actually from the revised, complete version, so the original film version has never actually been released on home video.

==Theme songs==
Ending:
* by Hiroko Moriguchi

Insert: (This song wasn&#x27;t used in the movie itself, but it was present on an extended trailer for the movie).
* by Hiroko Moriguchi

==Reception==
In a NHK 2023 survey, respondents have rated &quot;F91&quot; as the 18th most popular Gundam property.

==Legacy==
In production notes it was said that they would &quot;certainly&quot; continue with a sequel to &quot;Gundam F91&quot;, but a project for a continuation never materialized. Later on, however, Tomino was involved with the writing of the manga &quot;Mobile Suit Crossbone Gundam&quot;, which followed the film&#x27;s events to a certain extent. Tomino also wrote a two-part novelization that fleshed out more details of the story.

<text>James Paul Clarke (August 18, 1854 – October 1, 1916) was an American lawyer and politician from the Arkansas Delta during the Progressive Era. He served in public office over a period of almost 30 years, rising from the Arkansas General Assembly to Attorney General of Arkansas and later 18th Governor of Arkansas, ending his career in the United States Senate. In a period of Democratic Party hegemony known as the &quot;Solid South&quot;, Clarke blended positions of the budding Populist movement, such as free silver and railroad regulation, with nationalism and his gifted skills as an orator to popularity and electoral success.

==Early life==
Clarke was born in Yazoo City, Mississippi, in the Mississippi Delta. His father Walter, an architect, died when Clarke was seven years old, and he was raised by his mother, Ellen (), daughter of a prominent planter class family. Clarke attended public schools as well as Tutwilder&#x27;s Academy in Greenbrier, Alabama. After briefly editing a newspaper in Yazoo City, Clarke graduated with a law degree at the University of Virginia in 1878. Clarke was admitted to the bar in 1879, and settled briefly in the small Arkansas River Valley town of Ozark, Arkansas prior to moving to Helena, Arkansas in the Arkansas Delta.

Clarke married Sallie () Wooten of Moon Lake, Mississippi on November 10, 1883. Wooten had a son from previous marriage, Alonzo Stuart &quot;Lonnie&quot; Wooten; the couple had two daughters and a son.

==Career==
===Arkansas General Assembly===
Eight years into his legal career, Clarke won election to the Arkansas House of Representatives to represent Phillips County in 1886. He was seated alongside R. B. Macon and J. N. Donohoo in the 26th Arkansas General Assembly on January 10, 1887. Following a single term in the Arkansas House, Clarke won election to the Arkansas Senate. Clarke represented the 14th District, which covered Phillips and Lee counties beginning with the 27th Arkansas General Assembly. In 1891, he was elected President of the Arkansas Senate for the 28th Arkansas General Assembly.

===Statewide===
He was elected Attorney General of Arkansas and served from 1892 to 1894.
He served as Governor of Arkansas from 1895 to 1897. Clarke was devoted to upholding American nationalism as the keystone of the Democratic Party. &#x27;The people of the South,&#x27; he said in his closing speech of the election, &#x27;looked to the Democratic party to preserve the white standards of civilization.&#x27; Clarke easily defeated his opponents.&quot;

His term was largely unsuccessful and his legislation to end prizefighting and establish four-year terms for state officers failed. After leaving office in 1897, he moved his permanent residence to Little Rock, Arkansas and practiced law.

==US Senate==
Clarke was elected to the United States Senate in 1903 and served until his death in 1916. He served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate during the Sixty-third and Sixty-fourth Congresses.

==Death and legacy==
Clarke died in Little Rock, Arkansas. He is buried at Oakland Cemetery in Little Rock. Despite an ineffective tenure as governor, Clarke and his successor, Daniel Jones, marked a departure in the conservative Democratic Party of Arkansas toward a more populist party. They dealt with the electoral threat of a nascent Populist party by incorporating some reforms into the Democratic platform, in conflict with the positions of national Democrats. Clarke is remembered for a silver tongue, short temper, and willingness to fight.

Clarke&#x27;s statue was one of two statues that were presented by the State of Arkansas to the National Statuary Hall Collection at the United States Capitol. In 2019 the decision was made to replace his statue, and that of Uriah Milton Rose, with statues of Johnny Cash and Daisy Lee Gatson Bates. In the case of Clarke, the reason given is &quot;his racist beliefs&quot;. Clarke&#x27;s own great-great-grandson, State Senator Clarke Tucker, in a 2018 column strongly supported replacing Clarke&#x27;s statue: &quot;I strongly hope one of the new statues will be Daisy Bates or a member of the Little Rock Nine.&quot;

<doc id="304799" wikidata="Q3055058" url="?curid=304799" title="Equivalent potential temperature">
<text>Equivalent potential temperature, commonly referred to as theta-e formula_1, is a quantity that is conserved during changes to an air parcel&#x27;s pressure (that is, during vertical motions in the atmosphere), even if water vapor condenses during that pressure change. It is therefore more conserved than the ordinary potential temperature, which remains constant only for unsaturated vertical motions (pressure changes).

formula_2 is the temperature a parcel of air would reach if all the water vapor in the parcel were to condense, releasing its latent heat, and the parcel was brought adiabatically to a standard reference pressure, usually 1000 hPa (1000 mbar) which is roughly equal to atmospheric pressure at sea level.

==Use in estimating atmospheric stability==

===Stability of incompressible fluid===
Like a ball balanced on top of a hill, denser fluid lying above less dense fluid would be dynamically unstable: overturning motions (convection) can lower the center of gravity, and thus will occur spontaneously, rapidly producing a stable stratification (see also stratification (water)) which is thus the observed condition almost all the time. The condition for stability of an incompressible fluid is that &quot;density decreases monotonically with height&quot;.

===Stability of compressible air: Potential temperature===
If a fluid is compressible like air, the criterion for dynamic stability instead involves potential density, the density of the fluid at a fixed reference pressure. For an ideal gas (see &quot;gas laws&quot;), the stability criterion for an air column is that &quot;potential temperature increases monotonically with height&quot;.

To understand this, consider dry convection in the atmosphere, where the vertical variation in pressure is substantial and adiabatic temperature change is important: As a parcel of air moves upward, the ambient pressure drops, causing the parcel to expand. Some of the internal energy of the parcel is used up in doing the work required to expand against the atmospheric pressure, so the temperature of the parcel drops, even though it has not lost any heat. Conversely, a sinking parcel is compressed and becomes warmer even though no heat is added.

Air at the top of a mountain is usually colder than the air in the valley below, but the arrangement is not unstable: if a parcel of air from the valley were somehow lifted up to the top of the mountain, when it arrived it would be even colder than the air already there, due to adiabatic cooling; it would be heavier than the ambient air, and would sink back toward its original position. Similarly, if a parcel of cold mountain-top air were to make the trip down to the valley, it would arrive warmer and lighter than the valley air, and would float back up the mountain.

So cool air lying on top of warm air can be stable, as long as the temperature decrease with height is less than the adiabatic lapse rate; the dynamically important quantity is not the temperature, but the potential temperature—the temperature the air would have if it were brought adiabatically to a reference pressure. The air around the mountain is stable because the air at the top, due to its lower pressure, has a higher potential temperature than the warmer air below.

===Effects of water condensation: Equivalent potential temperature===
A rising parcel of air containing water vapor, if it rises far enough, reaches its lifted condensation level: it becomes saturated with water vapor (see &quot;Clausius–Clapeyron relation&quot;). If the parcel of air continues to rise, water vapor condenses and releases its latent heat to the surrounding air, partially offsetting the adiabatic cooling. A saturated parcel of air therefore cools less than a dry one would as it rises (its temperature changes with height at the moist adiabatic lapse rate, which is smaller than the dry adiabatic lapse rate). Such a saturated parcel of air can achieve buoyancy, and thus accelerate further upward, a runaway condition (instability) even if potential temperature increases with height. The sufficient condition for an air column to be absolutely stable, even with respect to saturated convective motions, is that the &quot;equivalent potential temperature must increase monotonically with height.&quot;

==Formula==
The definition of the equivalent potential temperature is:
:formula_3
Where:
* formula_4 is the temperature [K] of air at pressure formula_5,
* formula_6 is a reference pressure that is taken as 1000 hPa,
* formula_5 is the pressure at the point,
* formula_8 and formula_9 are the specific gas constants of dry air and of water vapour, respectively,
* formula_10 and formula_11 are the specific heat capacities of dry air and of liquid water, respectively,
* formula_12 and formula_13 are the total water and water vapour mixing ratios, respectively,
* formula_14 is the relative humidity,
* formula_15 is the latent heat of vapourisation of water.

A number of approximate formulations are used for calculating equivalent potential temperature, since it is not easy to compute integrations along motion of the parcel. Bolton (1980) gives review of such procedures with estimates of error. His best approximation formula is used when accuracy is needed:

:formula_16
:formula_17
:formula_18

Where:
* formula_19 is (dry) potential temperature [K] at the lifted condensation level (LCL),
* formula_20 is (approximated) temperature [K] at LCL,
* formula_21 is dew point temperature at pressure formula_5,
* formula_23 is the water vapor pressure (to obtain formula_24 for dry air),
* formula_25 is the ratio of the specific gas constant to the specific heat of dry air at constant pressure (0.2854),
* formula_26 is mixing ratio of water vapor mass per mass [kg/kg] (sometimes value is given in [g/kg] and that should be divided by 1000).

A little more theoretical formula is commonly used in literature like Holton (1972) when theoretical explanation is important:

:formula_27

Where:
* formula_28 is saturated mixing ratio of water at temperature formula_20, the temperature at the saturation level of the air,
* formula_30 is latent heat of evaporation at temperature formula_20 (2406 kJ/kg {at 40 °C} to 2501 kJ/kg {at 0 °C}), and
* formula_10 is specific heat of dry air at constant pressure (1005.7 J/(kg·K)).

Further more simplified formula is used (in, for example, Stull 1988 §13.1 p. 546) for simplicity, if it is desirable to avoid computing formula_20:

:formula_34

Where:
* formula_35 = equivalent temperature
* formula_8 = specific gas constant for air (287.04 J/(kg·K))

== Usage ==
This applies on the synoptic scale for characterisation of air masses. For instance, in a study of the North American Ice Storm of 1998, professors Gyakum (McGill University, Montreal) and Roebber (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee) have demonstrated that the air masses involved originated from high Arctic at an altitude of 300 to 400 hPa the previous week, went down toward the surface as they moved to the Tropics, then moved back up along the Mississippi Valley toward the St. Lawrence Valley. The back trajectories were evaluated using the constant equivalent potential temperatures.

In the mesoscale, equivalent potential temperature is also a useful measure of the static stability of the unsaturated atmosphere. Under normal, stably stratified conditions, the potential temperature increases with height,

: formula_37

and vertical motions are suppressed. If the equivalent potential temperature decreases with height,

:formula_38

the atmosphere is unstable to vertical motions, and convection is likely. Situations in which the equivalent potential temperature decreases with height, indicating instability in saturated air, are quite common.

<doc id="304803" wikidata="Q5275718" url="?curid=304803" title="Digibox">
<text>The Digibox is a device marketed by Sky UK in the UK and Ireland to enable home users to receive digital satellite television broadcasts (satellite receiver) from the Astra satellites at 28.2° east. An Internet service was also available through the device, similar in some ways to the American MSN TV, before being discontinued in 2015. The first Digiboxes shipped to consumers in October 1998 when Sky Digital was launched, and the hardware reference design has been relatively unchanged since then. Compared to other satellite receivers, they are severely restricted. As of 2020, Sky Digiboxes have become largely outmoded, superseded by Sky&#x27;s latest-generation Sky Q boxes and Sky Glass televisions; the previous generation Sky+HD boxes are still in use, however.

==Base technical details==
The Digibox&#x27;s internal hardware specifications are not publicly disclosed, however some details are clearly visible on the system. All early boxes except the Pace Javelin feature dual SCART outputs, an RS-232 serial port, a dual-output RF modulator with passthrough, and RCA socketed audio outputs, as well as a 33.6 modem and an LNB cable socket. A VideoGuard card slot, as well as a second smart-card reader are fitted to the front (these are for the Sky viewing card and other interactive cards). All share an identical user interface and EPG, with the exception of Sky+ HD boxes which have used the new Sky+ HD Guide since early 2009. The DRX595 dropped the RF modulator outputs. A PC type interface was fitted internally to some early standard boxes but was never utilised by Sky. The latest HD boxes only have a single SCART socket but have a RCA/phono socket for composite video output. All Sky+ and HD boxes have an optical sound output.

The serial port outputs data used for the Sky Gnome and Sky Talker. The Sky Gamepad sends data to the box via the serial port.

Uniquely, the second RF port outputs a 9 V power signal which is used to power &#x27;tvLINK&#x27; devices that can be attached to the RF cable next to a TV in a remote room. The tvLINK has an IR detector and sends commands from the remote control back to the Digibox on a 6 MHz carrier on the RF cable. This allows the Sky box to be viewed and controlled from another room by running a single RF cable.

All Digiboxes run on OpenTV (the latest HD boxes now use what is known internally as Project Darwin software) with Sky&#x27;s EPG software and NDS VideoGuard conditional access. The Digibox receives software updates over the air, even when in standby mode should an update be available. The software features Sky-controlled channel numbering, the ability to view OpenTV or WapTV applications provided as &quot;interactive&quot; or &quot;teletext&quot; content on channels (with the full-Internet style service available at first via Open... and later Sky Active), parental controls, the ability to order PPV events and some basic control over lists of favorite channels and show reminders.

Early decoders seemingly support only 700 channels approximately in their channel listing, as Sky has announced it is halting SD channels&#x27; launch applications, with over 100 awaiting launch, over 600 existing channels, and an average closure rate of 1 per week.

==Digibox remote control==
The Digibox remote control comes in four physical designs - blue with new Sky logo, blue with old Sky logo (this version was being issued from around the first year of the Sky service, although that logo fell out of use before it launched), black with new Sky logo (Sony boxes only) and silver with new Sky logo. However, all have multiple variations at present with a new version of Sky remote control being produced every year, to support the addition of new televisions to its universal remote control capabilities.

==Use outside Sky&#x27;s system==
The units are DVB-S compatible, and usually carry the DVB logo on the front. However, their use as a DVB-S receiver for anything other than Sky services is seriously limited by their reduced choice of symbol rates (22,000 and 27,500; additionally 28,250 and 29,000 on Sky+ HD), and their inability to store more than 50 (fewer still on some models) non-EPG channels without losing them. Following a software &quot;upgrade&quot; the Digibox will not display programmes from non 28.2 East Satellites. Additionally, once any form of parental controls are enabled, the &quot;Other Channels&quot; menu requires PIN entry on every use.

The box also refuses to let users view channels which are free-to-air but displaying flags claiming encryption, which locks out some channels even on the satellites Sky use themselves, such as Free to View channels and the &quot;EPG Background Audio&quot; channel.

==Manufacturers and non-common features==
Digiboxes have been made by Amstrad, Sony, Thomson, Panasonic, Grundig, and most commonly, Pace. Although the reference designs were identical, a number of digibox lines have specific faults or traits, such as failing modems on Grundig units, and unstable tuners on older model Pace boxes. Some units add features not found on other models, such as S-Video sockets on some Grundig units, and TOSLINK output on Sony&#x27;s.

For a long period of time in 2004 and 2005, only one Digibox was in production, the Pace DS430N, but Amstrad and Thomson have resumed production with the DRX500 and DSi4212 boxes respectively. Digiboxes for new customers are assigned randomly, and cannot be chosen, creating an after market for specific boxes due to their individual features. Sky bought out Amstrad satellite production in 2007 and now only distribute boxes which initially appeared as Amstrad models but are now badged merely as Sky.

==Standardized design==
In late 2005, it was announced that all future Digiboxes would have a standardized cosmetic design, although retain the three current makers, and have a slightly redesigned remote control, which would be recoloured white with some blue keys.

Thomson and Amstrad began supplying these boxes in late 2005 (with the DSI4214 and DRX550, respectively), with Pace following in late 2006 (with the DS445NB). The standardized design is known as the &quot;Flow&quot; design.

==Other Digiboxes==

A second generation of Digibox exists, marketed as Sky+. These PVR units have three versions: the 40 GB PVR1, the 40 GB PVR2, and the PVR3 which is fitted with a 160 GB HDD with 80GB available for user recordings, and the remaining 80 GB reserved for use by Sky Anytime. All have dual LNB inputs and an optical digital audio output, as well as all other features of the Sky box. These units are manufactured by Amstrad, Pace and Thomson only, and use a different remote control. USB ports are fitted to the PVR3. When Sky+ was launched, there was an additional £10 monthly charge to access the Sky+ functionality if two or more premium packages were not subscribed to. Sky have now removed this charge, effective 1 July 2007. Without a Sky+ Subscription, the Sky+ box reverts to the functionality of a normal Digibox, albeit without Autoview modes.

The Sky+2TB box has 2 TB to record to and is manufactured solely by Thomson. This unit is also fitted with USB ports. (this unit has been discontinued)

A third generation of Digibox also exists, with the additional ability to receive DVB-S2 HDTV signals in the MPEG-4 format. The initial sole manufacturer of these Sky+ HD boxes was Thomson, and made their debut on 22 May 2006 with the launch of HDTV channels on Sky. Although around 17,000 digiboxes were initially produced, they could not meet demand and some had to wait for longer for their SkyHD Digibox. Past manufacturers are Thomson, Pace, Amstrad and Samsung.

These boxes have all the features of a Sky+ box, as well as a HDMI output, and the early Thomson DSI8215 model has component video output. Both SATA and Ethernet ports are also supplied, currently used for the Sky Anytime+ service. As well as requiring a Sky+ subscription or any subscription, HD versions of the subscription channels require the payment of an additional £10.25 (or €15) per month, although HD channels can be viewed on free-to-air services such as BBC One HD, BBC Two HD, BBC Four HD, CBBC HD, ITV HD, ITVBe HD, Channel 4 HD, NHK World HD and with a Freesat from Sky card, Channel 5 HD.

On 16 March 2011, Sky launched the Sky HD box, primarily targeted at multiroom subscribers. and also used for Freesat from Sky installations. The Sky HD box is not a personal video recorder, meaning it has no hard disk and cannot support the Sky+ functionality. These were later replaced with Sky+HD boxes, which had both sets of functionality.

==Card pairing==
All Sky boxes, whether Digiboxes, Sky+ or SkyHD incorporate card pairing. This involves the &#x27;marrying&#x27; or &#x27;pairing&#x27; of a viewing card to one particular STB, thus preventing one card (and indeed subscription) being used on multiple digiboxes. During installation the engineer will initiate a &#x27;callback&#x27; from the STB to Sky via modem and telephone line, transmitting details of the viewing card number and the box in which it is installed. Once this step has been completed it is no longer possible to view premium channels such as Movies or Sports on any other box besides that which the card was paired with. The card can still be used to view non-premium channels such as Sky1 but will display an error message when attempting to watch a movie channel or sports channel with an unpaired box and card combination. A card can be &#x27;re-paired&#x27; in some instances such as STB replacement or multiroom relocation, however this must be initiated by Sky and cannot be completed by an end-user.

==Power consumption==
Standard Digiboxes use almost as much power in standby as when active; the &quot;standby&quot; setting merely mutes the sound and cuts off the picture, but internal signal processing continues at the same rate. Sky+ boxes are believed to reduce their power consumption more significantly in standby because they can spin down hard disks. Power consumption for the standard box varies from around 10 to 18 Watts. Most Sky+HD boxes consume up to 60W when active, falling to ~30W when the disc is powered down. To some degree, this has been addressed with the latest DRX890/895 HD boxes. These have a power consumption of 45W max but now have a &quot;deep sleep&quot; mode consuming around 1/2 W.

<doc id="304806" wikidata="Q2301247" url="?curid=304806" title="Earl of Arundel">
<text>Earl of Arundel is a title of nobility in England, and one of the oldest extant in the English peerage. It is currently held by the Duke of Norfolk, and it is used (along with the earldom of Surrey) by his heir apparent as a courtesy title.

==History==
The earldom was created in 1138 or 1139 for the French baron William d&#x27;Aubigny. Its origin was the earlier grant by Henry I to his second wife, Adeliza of Louvain, of the forfeited &quot;honour&quot; of Arundel, which included the castle and a large portion of Sussex. After his death, she married William, who thus became master of the lands, and who from about the year 1141 is variously styled earl of Sussex, of Chichester, or of Arundel. His first known appearance as an earl is at Christmas 1141. Until the mid-13th century, the earls were also frequently known as Earl of Sussex, until this title fell into disuse. At about the same time, the earldom fell to the originally Breton FitzAlan family, a younger branch of which went on to become the Stuart family, which later ruled Scotland and England.

A tradition arose that the holder of Arundel Castle should automatically be Earl of Arundel, and this was formally confirmed by King Henry VI. An Act of Parliament in 1627 confirmed this designation, and retrospectively applied the earldom to the lords of Arundel, some authorities holding that the earldom stretched back to the reign of Richard I (specifically 1189). However, this designation was not always followed. Some of the lords of Arundel were never addressed as earls during their lifetimes, but nevertheless are counted and numbered as earls here. Other sources may not include some of the earls listed below, and may consider the earldom to have been created more than once.

In his 1834 book on the earls of Arundel, M. A. Tierney (chaplain to the duke of Norfolk) maintains that the first incarnation of the earldom was with the House of Montgomery. Roger of Montgomery, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury was one of William the Conqueror&#x27;s top generals, and William bestowed on him, amongst several hundred other manors, the property at Arundel, with the charge to fortify it with a castle. Montgomery is believed to have built the motte that survives to this day, and is thought to have built a wooden keep on it, overlooking the river Arun. Montgomery and two of his sons are counted by many as being the first incarnation of the earldom, but are often not counted amongst the earls.

In 1580 the 12th Earl, and last FitzAlan to hold the title, died without a male heir. His daughter Mary FitzAlan had married the attainted 4th Duke of Norfolk, and the title passed to their son, Philip Howard, before he too was attainted for treason in 1589. The earldom of Arundel was restored to his son Thomas following the accession of King James I. The 5th Earl of Arundel, the 5th Howard to hold the title, was restored to the principal Howard title of Duke of Norfolk in 1660, and the title has descended with that dukedom ever since.

In 1842, by royal warrant, Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 14th Duke of Norfolk and 13th Earl of Arundel, and his siblings, assumed the surname FitzAlan-Howard, used by the family line to today.

==First creation (c. 1138)==
* William d&#x27;Aubigny, 1st Earl of Arundel (d. 1176)
* William d&#x27;Aubigny, 2nd Earl of Arundel (d. 1193)
* William d&#x27;Aubigny, 3rd Earl of Arundel (c. 1174–1221)
* William d&#x27;Aubigny, 4th Earl of Arundel (d. 1224)
* Hugh d&#x27;Aubigny, 5th Earl of Arundel (d. 1243)
* John Fitzalan (1223–1267), (6th) Earl of Arundel
* John Fitzalan (1246–1272), (7th) Earl of Arundel
* Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel – 1st, 6th or 8th earl – (1267–1302), great-grand-nephew of the 5th Earl. He received a writ in 1289, at his majority, summoning him to Parliament; this is thought to perhaps be a creation of another earldom of Arundel. See below.

== Second creation (1289) ==
* Richard Fitzalan, 1st (or 6th) Earl of Arundel (1267–1302)
* Edmund Fitzalan, 2nd (or 7th) Earl of Arundel (1285–1326) (forfeit 1326)
* Richard Fitzalan, 3rd (or 8th) Earl of Arundel (c. 1313–1376) (restored 1331)
* Richard Fitzalan, 4th (or 9th) Earl of Arundel (1346–1397) (forfeit 1397)
* Thomas Fitzalan, 5th (or 10th) Earl of Arundel (1381–1415) (restored 1400)
* John Fitzalan, 6th (or 11th) Earl of Arundel (1385–1421)
* John Fitzalan, 7th (or 12th) Earl of Arundel (1408–1435)
* Humphrey Fitzalan, 8th (or 13th) Earl of Arundel (1429–1438)
* William Fitzalan, 9th (or 14th) Earl of Arundel (1417–1487)
* Thomas Fitzalan, 10th (or 15th) Earl of Arundel (1450–1524)
* William Fitzalan, 11th (or 16th) Earl of Arundel (1476–1544)
* Henry Fitzalan, 12th (or 17th) Earl of Arundel (1512–1580)

== Third creation (1580) ==
* Philip Howard, 1st, 13th (or 18th) Earl of Arundel (1557–1595) (forfeit 1589)
* Thomas Howard, 2nd, 14th (or 19th) Earl of Arundel (1585–1646) (restored 1604)
* Henry Howard, 3rd, 15th (or 20th) Earl of Arundel (1608–1652)
* Thomas Howard, 4th, 16th (or 21st) Earl of Arundel (1627–1677) (restored as 5th Duke of Norfolk in 1660)

Thereafter the earldom of Arundel has been held by the dukes of Norfolk. The 18th Duke of Norfolk (18th earl) is the current holder.

* Thomas Howard, 5th Duke of Norfolk (1627–1677)
* Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk (1628–1684)
* Henry Howard, 7th Duke of Norfolk (1655–1701)
* Thomas Howard, 8th Duke of Norfolk (1683–1732)
* Edward Howard, 9th Duke of Norfolk (1685–1777)
* Charles Howard, 10th Duke of Norfolk (1720–1786)
* Charles Howard, 11th Duke of Norfolk (1746–1815)
* Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk (1765–1842)
* Henry Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk (1791–1856)
* Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 14th Duke of Norfolk (1815–1860)
* Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk (1847–1917)
* Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk (1908–1975)
* Miles Fitzalan-Howard, 17th Duke of Norfolk (1915–2002)
* Edward Fitzalan-Howard, 18th Duke of Norfolk (b. 1956)

The heir apparent is Henry Fitzalan-Howard, Earl of Arundel and Surrey (b. 1987).
Next in line of succession are Arundel&#x27;s brothers, Lords Thomas and Philip Fitzalan-Howard.

<doc id="304809" wikidata="Q5349086" url="?curid=304809" title="Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan">
<text>The Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan (Urdu: آئین پاکستان میں آٹھویں ترمیم) allowed the President to unilaterally dissolve the National Assembly and elected governments. The National Assembly of Pakistan amended the Constitution of Pakistan in 1985 and the law stayed on the books until its repeal in 1997.

The bill was passed in the absence of the elected Parliament. The eighth amendment was drafted and later enforced by the technocratic-military government of General Zia-ul-Haq. The eighth amendment changed Pakistan&#x27;s system of government from a parliamentary democracy to an assembly-independent republic. The eighth amendment strengthened the authority of the President and also granted additional powers to dismiss the elected Prime Minister&#x27;s government. These powers included the right, expressed in sub-section 2(b) inserted into Article 58, to dissolve the National Assembly (but not the Senate) if, in his or her opinion, &quot;a situation has arisen in which the Government of the Federation cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and an appeal to the electorate is necessary.&quot; (Constitution of Pakistan, Article 58) with the consequence of dismissing the Prime Minister and his or her Cabinet.

==Text==
The Eighth Amendment, besides making a number of other changes to the Constitution, introduced the following clause into Article 58 of the Constitution:
==Effect on democracy==
General Zia-ul-Haq first used the amendment to dismiss Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo for alleged corruption in May 1988. The prime minister had wanted to roll back Zia&#x27;s authority. In 1988, Benazir Bhutto pledged to abolish the amendment in her election manifesto. The amendment stayed on the books however, because she did not have a sufficient number of seats in 1988 and again in 1993. From 1988 to 1996, President Ghulaam Ishaq Khan made extensive use of the eight amendment and the Article 58 2(b) to dissolve the National Assembly. President Khan used the amendment to dismiss the elected governments of Prime Ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif. President Khan first used the VIII Amendment on August 6, 1990, against Bhutto on alleged cases of nepotism and the corruption. In 1993, President Ishaq Khan again used this amendment to dismiss the people-elected government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. In the second instance, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was reinstated as prime minister by the Supreme Court, but the resulting stalemate ended with the resignations of both Khan and Sharif. The use of Article 58 2(b) was almost exclusively justified by the president as necessary, for the removal of corrupt governments that, it was asserted, had lost the confidence of the people. Elections were held each time that caused the ruling party to lose its majority or plurality in the National Assembly. It was again used in 1996 by President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari against his own party leader Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in November 1996.

In 1997, the Thirteenth Amendment was passed, stripping the president of the power to dissolve the National Assembly and call for new elections, effectively reducing the presidency to a ceremonial figurehead.

Pakistan&#x27;s democracy provides no means for the people to directly recall members of Parliament before the end of their terms. Consequently, the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments had the effect of removing the institutional checks and balances on the Prime Minister&#x27;s power, by giving him or her immunity from being legally dismissed. However, an indirectly elected President’s unfettered power to dismiss a directly elected government had been considered excessive by the Parliament, which thus acted to remove it, restoring ultimate authority to the Prime Minister, as is the case in most democracies following the Westminster system of governance.

The power of the president&#x27;s office was partially restored by the Seventeenth Amendment. The power to dissolve the National Assembly and dismiss the Prime Minister was then subject to Supreme Court approval. In 2010, the Eighteenth Amendment was passed by Parliament of Pakistan, repealing the 17th Amendment.

==Eighth Amendment as a compromise==
In general discourse, the Eighth Amendment has become synonymous with Article 58 2(b), which in turn is considered to be the provision that introduced the presidential power to dissolve the National Assembly. However, the Eighth Amendment was in fact a compromise between the Parliament elected in the non-party elections of 1985 and then President Gen. Zia-ul-Haq. Prior to the 1985 election, over a period of six years, Gen. Zia-ul-Haq had already made numerous amendments to the Constitution of 1973 through various Constitution Amendment Orders, the most significant being the Revival of Constitution of 1973 Order (President&#x27;s Order No. 14 of 1985). That Order had in fact granted to the President even more discretion in dissolving the National Assembly. Clause (2) added to Article 58 by that Order stated: &quot;The President may also dissolve the National Assembly in his discretion where, in his opinion, an appeal to the electorate is necessary.&quot; Note that the test of the constitutional functioning of the government was not required for the President to dissolve the National Assembly.

It must also be stated that the Eighth Amendment also caused the elected Parliament to endorse all Orders made by Gen. Zia-ul-Haq by substituting the Article 270A introduced by President&#x27;s Order No. 14 of 1985 by a slightly modified version, preserving the text declaring the validity of all of his actions, including his takeover of July 5, 1977 and subsequent constitutional amendments.

It is not clear whether this explicit parliamentary approval was required for Gen. Zia&#x27;s amendments to obtain legal validity, but it appears that Gen. Zia considered it desirable to obtain this approval and thus chose to compromise by watering down some of the presidential powers his amendments had granted.

James Quigley was born on October 15, 1854, in Oshawa, Canada West (now the Province of Ontario). He was the son of James and Mary Lacey Quigley, whom immigrated to Canada around 1849 from Ireland. The family moved to the United States in 1856, settling in Lima, New York. At age ten, James Quigley was sent to live with his uncle, Father Edward Quigley, the rector of Immaculate Conception Parish in Buffalo, New York. As a young man, James Quigley worked as a dock worker in Buffalo.

After graduating from St. Joseph&#x27;s College in Buffalo in 1872, Quigley passed an entrance examination for the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. However, he soon decided to enter the priesthood instead. Quigley attended Our Lady of Angels Seminary at Niagara Falls, New York. He then went to Europe to study at the University of Innsbruck in Austria and College of Propaganda in Rome.

===Ordination and ministry===
While in Rome, Quigley was ordained a priest by Cardinal Raffaele Monaco La Valletta for the Diocese of Buffalo on April 13, 1879. Following his return to New York, the diocese assigned Quigley as pastor of St. Vincent Parish in Attica. He left St. Vincent&#x27;s in 1884 to become rector of St. Joseph&#x27;s Cathedral Parish in Buffalo. He was transferred to St. Bridget&#x27;s Parish in Buffalo in 1886. 

Quigley preached in Latin, English, Italian and German. He was also conversant in French and Polish. He served for 12 years as the president of the Catholic Schools Board in Buffalo.

Before going to Buffalo, Quigley suffered a nervous breakdown. It took him over 18 months to fully recover it. As was common in that era, he hid the problem from others.

===Bishop of Buffalo===
On December 12, 1896, Pope Leo XIII appointed Quigley as bishop of Buffalo. He was consecrated at St. Joseph Cathedral on February 24, 1897, by Archbishop Michael Corrigan.

In 1899, the Longshoremen&#x27;s Union in Buffalo, representing 1,500 workers who scooped grain out of grain ships, went on strike against the Lake Carriers Association. The Association paid these men through the local saloon keepers, who would subtract fees from their pay for room, board and drinks, leaving them very little. When the saloon keepers raised their fees, the workers went on strike. Quigley opened St. Bridget Church in Buffalo as a headquarters for the strikers, gave them strategic support, and acted as a mediator with the carriers. The strike finally ended when the carriers agreed to pay their workers directly.

In 1902, Quigley embarked on a public campaign against what he termed &quot;socialism&quot; in labor unions in Buffalo. He claimed that some union regulations were unjust and oppressive to Catholic workers. Quigley wrote a pastoral letter in German to the German parishes that called on union members to assert their rights regarding union governance. He also spoke at mass meetings. While claiming to support the union movement, Quigley denounced socialism and gave his interpretation of why the Catholic Church opposed it. As a result of his anti-socialism campaign in Buffalo, Quigley gained a national reputation.

===Archbishop of Chicago===

Quigley was appointed archbishop of Chicago by Leo XIII on January 8, 1903, and installed on March 10, 1903. 

Quigley quickly realized that the rapidly expanding population in the diocese demanded more priests. In July 1903 he started planning a minor seminary, which would provide high school and some college course for teenagers looking to become priests. Cathedral College of the Sacred Heart opened in Chicago in October 1905 with an enrollment of 52 seminarians. After Quigley&#x27;s death, this minor seminary would evolve into the Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary. He also bought property in Chicago for the future establishment of a major seminary for adult seminarians.

In 1905, Quigley asked Reverend John De Schryver, a professor at St. Ignatius College Prep in Chicago, to organize St. John Berchmans Parish for Belgian Catholic immigrants. He also organized national parishes for Italian and Lithuanian immigrants. The resulting parishes flourished as an &quot;important spiritual, cultural, and educational component of Chicago&#x27;s life.&quot; 

Quigley was always interested in Catholic missions, both in the United States and abroad. In 1905 was one of the founders of the Catholic Extension Society, which would support mission churches throughout the country. Quigley hosted the first American Catholic Missionary Conference in Chicago in 1908.

In 1910, Quigley approached Reverend Francis X. McCabe, president of DePaul University, about the lack of higher education opportunities for Catholic women in the archdiocese. DePaul began admitting women the following year.

Quigley had commissioned in 1905 the construction of the Bishops&#x27; Mausoleum in Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois. It was designed by the architect William J. Brinkmann, who planned several churches in Chicago. Completed in 1912, the mausoleum holds the remains of five bishops and archbishops of Chicago.

=== Death and legacy ===
In June 1915, in declining health, Quigley traveled to Rochester, New York, to stay with his brother while receiving medical treatment. James Quigley died in Rochester from what was called paralysis on July 10, 1915, at age 60.

A 1915 resolution by the Chicago City Council named Quigley as;&quot;...one of those men who work quietly and behind the scenes, and who seek no public credit or applause for the work which they do; ...he spent himself...in particular in the service of the many and varied works of charity which have been founded...&quot;The Archbishop Quigley Center in Chicago, formerly the Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary, is named in his honor.

<text>Epistemological realism is a philosophical position, a subcategory of objectivism, holding that what can be known about an object exists independently of one&#x27;s mind. It is opposed to epistemological idealism.

Epistemological realism is related directly to the correspondence theory of truth, which claims that the world exists independently and innately to our perceptions of it. Our sensory data then reflect or correspond to the innate world.

<text>Epistemological idealism is a subjectivist position in epistemology that holds that what one knows about an object exists only in one&#x27;s mind. It is opposed to epistemological realism.

==Overview==
Epistemological idealism suggests that everything we &quot;experience&quot; and know is of a mental nature—&quot;sense data&quot; in philosophical jargon. Although it is sometimes employed to argue in favor of metaphysical idealism, in principle epistemological idealism makes no claim about whether sense data are grounded in reality. As such, it is a container for both indirect realism and idealism. This is the version of epistemological idealism which interested Ludwig Boltzmann; it had roots in the positivism of Ernst Mach and Gustav Kirchhoff plus a number of aspects of the Kantianism or neo-Kantianism of Hermann von Helmholtz and Heinrich Hertz.

A contemporary representative of epistemological idealism is Brand Blanshard.

<doc id="304821" wikidata="Q1136557" url="?curid=304821" title="2003 European heatwave">
<text>The 2003 European heat wave saw the hottest summer recorded in Europe since at least 1540. France was hit especially hard. The heat wave led to health crises in several countries and combined with drought to create a crop shortfall in parts of Southern Europe. The death toll has been estimated at more than 70,000.

The predominant heat was recorded in July and August, partly a result of the western European seasonal lag from the maritime influence of the Atlantic warm waters in combination with hot continental air and strong southerly winds.

== By country ==

=== France ===


In France, 14,802 heat-related deaths (mostly among the elderly) occurred during the heat wave, according to the French National Institute of Health. France does not commonly have very hot summers, particularly in the northern areas, but eight consecutive days with temperatures of more than were recorded in Auxerre, Yonne in early August 2003. Because of the usually relatively mild summers, most people did not know how to react to very high temperatures (for instance, with respect to rehydration). Most single-family homes and residential facilities were not equipped with central air conditioning. While contingency plans were made for a variety of natural and man-made catastrophes, high temperatures had rarely been considered a major hazard.

The catastrophe occurred in August, a month in which many people, including government ministers and physicians, are on holiday. Many bodies were not claimed for many weeks because relatives were on holiday. A refrigerated warehouse outside Paris was used by undertakers as they did not have enough space in their own facilities. On September 3, 2003, 57 bodies were still left unclaimed in the Paris area, and were buried.

The high number of deaths can be explained by the conjunction of seemingly unrelated events. Most nights in France are cool, even in summer. As a consequence, houses (usually of stone, concrete, or brick construction) do not warm too much during the daytime and radiate minimal heat at night, and air conditioning is usually unnecessary. During the heat wave, temperatures remained at record highs even at night, breaking the usual cooling cycle.

Elderly people living by themselves had never faced such extreme heat before and did not know how to react or were too mentally or physically impaired by the heat to make the necessary adaptations themselves. Elderly people with family support or those residing in nursing homes were more likely to have others who could make the adjustments for them. This led to unexpected survival rates with the weakest group having fewer deaths than the more physically fit; most of the heat victims came from the group of elderly not requiring constant medical care; often childless women who lived alone.

That shortcomings of the nation&#x27;s health system could allow such a death toll is a controversy in France. The administration of President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin laid the blame on families who had left their elderly behind without caring for them, the 35-hour workweek, which affected the amount of time doctors could work, and family practitioners vacationing in August. Many companies traditionally closed in August, so people had no choice about when to vacation. Family doctors were still in the habit of vacationing at the same time. It is not clear that more physicians would have helped, as the main limitation was not the health system, but locating those which were needing of assistance.

The opposition, as well as many of the editorials of the French local press, blamed the administration. Many blamed Health Minister Jean-François Mattei for failing to return from his vacation when the heat wave became serious, and his aides for blocking emergency measures in public hospitals (such as the recalling of physicians). A particularly vocal critic was Dr. Patrick Pelloux, head of the union of emergency physicians, who blamed the Raffarin administration for ignoring warnings from health and emergency professionals and trying to minimize the crisis. Mattei lost his ministerial post in a cabinet reshuffle on 31 March 2004.

Not everyone blamed the government. &quot;The French family structure is more dislocated than elsewhere in Europe, and prevailing social attitudes hold that once older people are closed behind their apartment doors or in nursing homes, they are someone else&#x27;s problem&quot;, said Stéphane Mantion, an official with the French Red Cross. &quot;These thousands of elderly victims didn&#x27;t die from a heat wave as such, but from the isolation and insufficient assistance they lived with day in and out, and which almost any crisis situation could render fatal.&quot;

Moreover, the French episode of heat wave in 2003 shows how heat wave dangers result from the intricate association of natural and social factors. Although research established that heat waves represent a major threat for public health, France had no policy in place. Until the 2003 event, heat waves were a strongly underestimated risk in the French context, which partly explains the high number of victims.

Below are statistics for the month of August 2003 in France.

The 2003 heatwave served as a wake-up call for many cities to take action on reducing climate risks in urban areas. The following year, the country drew up the National Heat Wave Plan built on national forecasting and alert systems. Despite hotter summers since, the death toll has been significantly lowered. In addition to a major effort to issue warning messages in time, the plan includes measures such as cooling rooms at senior centers, replacing tarmac at playgrounds with more heat reflective materials, and mandatory insulation in construction regulation. This reflects a growing awareness of the benefit of an integrated response to risks like heatwaves, compared to stand-alone technologies and projects and greater attention paid to green and blue infrastructure in city planning. Since 2012, French construction standards for new buildings and, to a lesser extent for existing buildings, have included requirements regarding comfort during heatwaves. In Paris, adding parks and green spaces has been another key solution to heatwaves. Urban greening is most effective when green spaces are watered during a heatwave. Doing so increases the cooling effect from evapotranspiration.

===Portugal===
In Portugal, there were an estimated 1,953 excess deaths (data corrected, range 1,866 to 2,039); 43% higher than the expected number for that year. 1 August 2003 was the hottest day in centuries, with night temperatures well above . At dawn that same day, a freak storm developed in the southern region of the country. Over the next week, a hot, strong &quot;sirocco&quot; wind contributed to the spread of extensive forest-fires.

Five percent of Portugal&#x27;s countryside and 10% of the forests (215,000 hectares or an estimated ), were destroyed, and 18 people died in the flames. In Amareleja, one of the hottest cities in Europe, temperatures reached as high as .

===Luxembourg===
In Findel, Luxembourg, the temperature reached on 8 and 12 August, making it the country&#x27;s highest temperature since records began in 1947. This temperature record was later broken in July 2019.

===Netherlands===
About 1,500 heat-related deaths occurred in the Netherlands, again largely the elderly. The heat wave broke no records, although four tropical weather-designated days in mid-July, preceding the official wave, are not counted due to a cool day in between and the nature of the Netherlands specification/definition of a heat wave.

The highest temperature recorded this heatwave was on 7 August, when in Arcen, in Limburg, a temperature of was reached, 0.8 °C below the national record (since 1904). A higher temperature had only been recorded twice before. On 8 August, a temperature of was recorded, and 12 August had a temperature of .

===Spain===
Initially, 141 deaths were attributed to the heat wave in Spain. A further research of INE estimated a 12,963 excess of deaths during summer of 2003. Temperature records were broken in various cities, with the heat wave being more felt in typically cooler northern Spain.

Record temperatures were felt in:
* Jerez, 
* Girona, 
* Burgos, 
* San Sebastián, 
* Pontevedra, 
* Barcelona, 
* Sevilla, (the 1995 record was )

===Italy===
The summer of 2003 was among the warmest in the preceding three centuries. The weather station of Catenanuova, in Sicily, had a monthly mean of in July 2003, with an absolute maximum of on 17 July, with monthly mean maximum temperatures of , and in June, July, and August, respectively.
On some days, the increase in power consumption, paired with a 800MW reduction of the electricity imported from France, itself coping with the heat wave, compelled the Italian power companies to set up rolling blackouts. Italy estimated that the number of heat wave related deaths was approximately 20,000.

===Germany===
In Germany, shipping could not navigate the Elbe or Danube, as a result of low water levels. Low water levels at the Rhine led to a reduction of cargo capacity by 70% to 80%. The drought also led to a reduction in agricultural production. Coal Power Plants and Nuclear Power Plants had to reduce their electricity production because they could not discharge cooling water into the rivers because of their already high water temperature. Together with the limited output of hydroelectric power stations, this led to a rise in electricity prices.

Summer 2003 was with an average Temperature of 19.6 °C the warmest in recorded History of Germany. On 9 August temperatures rose to 40.2 °C in Karlsruhe and again to 40.2 °C on 13 August in Karlsruhe and Freiburg. The number of heat related deaths was estimated to be 9500.

===Switzerland===
Melting glaciers in the Alps caused avalanches and flash floods in Switzerland. A new nationwide record temperature of was recorded in Grono, Graubünden.

===United Kingdom===

The United Kingdom experienced one of its hottest summers on record. Atlantic cyclones brought cool and wet weather for a short while at the end of July and beginning of August before the temperatures started to increase substantially on 3 August. Several weather records were broken in the United Kingdom, including a new record for the country&#x27;s highest ever recorded temperature of at Faversham in Kent on 10 August, which remained the highest recorded temperature in the UK until the heatwave in July 2019.

This was the first occasion on which temperatures exceeding had ever been officially recorded in the UK. Scotland broke its highest temperature record with recorded in Greycrook in the Scottish borders on 9 August.

Due to a number of deaths, the UK government released its Heat Health Watch system, issuing warnings if temperatures rise above 30 °C in the day and 15 °C at night. According to the BBC, over 2,000 more people than usual may have died in the United Kingdom during the 2003 heatwave.

The tarmac melted on part of the M25 between Junctions 26 and 27, and rails buckled from expansion on the hottest day in England in 13 years, while two teenaged boys drowned while trying to escape the excessive heat.

===Ireland===
The summer of 2003 was warmer than average in Ireland, but the heat was far less pronounced there than in the rest of Europe. August was by far the warmest, sunniest, and driest month, with temperatures roughly 2 °C above average. The highest temperature recorded was at Belderrig, County Mayo on 8 August.

==Agricultural impact==
Crops in Southern Europe suffered the most from drought.

===Wheat===
These shortfalls in wheat harvest occurred as a result of the long drought.
* France – 20%
* Italy – 13%
* United Kingdom – 12%
* Ukraine – 75% (unknown if affected by heatwave or an early freeze that year)
* Moldova – 80%

Many other countries had shortfalls of 5–10%, and the EU total production was down by 10 million tonnes, or 10%.

===Grapes===
The heatwave greatly accelerated the ripening of grapes; also, the heat dehydrated the grapes, making for more concentrated juice. By mid-August, the grapes in certain vineyards had already reached their optimal sugar content, possibly resulting in 12.0°–12.5° wines (see alcoholic degree). Because of that, and also of the impending change to rainy weather, the harvest was started much earlier than usual (e.g. in mid-August for areas that are normally harvested in September).

The wines from 2003, although in scarce quantity, were predicted to have exceptional quality, especially in France. The heatwave made Hungary fare extremely well in the Vinalies 2003 International wine contest: a total of nine gold and nine silver medals were awarded to Hungarian winemakers.

==Oceanic impact==
The anomalous overheating affecting the atmosphere also created anomalies on sea surface stratification in the Mediterranean Sea and on the surface currents, as well. A seasonal current of the central Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ionian Stream (AIS), was affected by the warm temperatures, resulting in modifications in its path and intensity. The AIS is important for the reproduction biology of important pelagic commercial fish species, so the heatwave may have influenced indirectly the stocks of these species.

==Economic impact==

Extreme heat undermines the working capacity of individuals, resulting in lower productivity, and thus economic output. In 2003, economic losses attributed to excessive heat amounted to 0.5% of European Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
This is 2.5 times higher than the losses experienced during an average year over the historical period 1981–2010. Losses of over 1% of GDP were recorded in areas with high exposure to heat and showing a large share of outdoor work.

<text>The Constitution of Pakistan ( ; ISO: &quot; Āīn-ē-Pākistān&quot;), also known as the 1973 Constitution, is the supreme law of Pakistan. The document guides Pakistan&#x27;s law, political culture, and system. It sets out the state&#x27;s outline, the fundamental rights of the population, the state&#x27;s law and orders, and also the structure and establishment of the institutions and the armed forces. Drafted by the government of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, with additional assistance from the country&#x27;s opposition parties, it was unanimously approved by the 5th Parliament on 10 April and ratified on 14 August 1973. The first three chapters establish the rules, mandate, and separate powers of the three branches of the government: a bicameral legislature; an executive branch governed by the Prime Minister as chief executive; and an apex federal judiciary headed by Supreme Court. The Constitution designates the President of Pakistan as a ceremonial Head of State who is to represent the unity of the state. The first six articles of the constitution outline the political system as a federal parliamentary republic system; as well as Islam as its state religion. The Constitution also encapsulates provisions stipulating the legal system&#x27;s compliance with Islamic injunctions contained in the Quran and Sunnah.

The Parliament cannot make any laws which may be repugnant or contrary to the Constitution; however, the Constitution itself may be amended by a two-thirds majority in both the houses of the bicameral Parliament, unlike the previous legal documents of 1956 and 1962. It has been amended over time, and most recent impulses for political upgrades and reforms has been amended. Although enforced in 1973, Pakistan, however, celebrates the adoption of the constitution on 23 March—when the first set was promulgated in 1956 each and every year as Republic Day.
Technically there are 26 amendments but 23 amendments were made in constitution and three were not passed by the parliament as the three amendments collapsed.

Currently the promulgated Constitution of Pakistan, in its amended form, stands as the 7th lengthiest constitution of the world with a word count of 56,240 Words.

==Origins and historical background==
In a radio talk addressed to the people of Pakistan, broadcast in February 1948, Jinnah expressed his views regarding Pakistan&#x27;s constitution-to-be in the following way:

Pakistan was founded in 1947 as a Dominion (an independent realm or kingdom) within the British Commonwealth. The same was true in independent India. During its first few years of existence the British monarch was also Pakistan&#x27;s head of state, as is still the case in Canada, Australia etc. Before writing a constitution, a Constituent Assembly passed the Objectives Resolution, on the insistence of the ulama and Jamaat-e-Islami, in March 1949 to define the basic directive principles of the new state and to declare state recognition of the sovereignty of Allah over the universe. The Objectives Resolution affirmed the role of democracy and contained religious provisions to enable society to adhere to the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah. The Objectives Resolution has henceforth been inserted as a preamble into each of Pakistan&#x27;s subsequent constitutions.

The country became a republic when its first constitution was approved in 1956 but this was abrogated in 1958 after a military Coup d&#x27;état. Pakistan&#x27;s second constitution was approved in 1962. It granted executive power to the president and abolished the office of the prime minister. It also institutionalised the intervention of military in politics by providing that for twenty years, the president or the defence minister must be a person who had held a rank not lower than that of lieutenant-general in the army. The 1962 constitution was suspended in 1969 and abrogated in 1972.

The 1973 constitution was the first in Pakistan to be framed by elected representatives. Unlike the 1962 constitution it gave Pakistan a parliamentary democracy with executive power concentrated in the office of the prime minister, and the formal head of state—the president—limited to acting on the advice of the prime minister.

The Constitution states that all laws are to conform with the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Quran and Sunnah. The 1973 Constitution also created certain institutions such as the Shariat Court and the Council of Islamic Ideology to channel the interpretation and application of Islam.

After another coup d&#x27;état in 1977, the constitution was held in abeyance until it was &quot;restored&quot; in 1985 but with an amendment (the Eighth) shifting power from the parliament and Prime Minister to the president. Another Amendment (Seventeenth) in 2004 continued this shift, but in 2010, the Eighteenth amendment reduced presidential powers, returning the government to a parliamentary republic.

===Previous legislation as source===
The successful independence movement led the establishment of Pakistan, independent from the British Raj in 1947. The British Empire divided the Raj into two parts, India and Pakistan.

The provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935, had greatly influenced the state and served as its basic legal document until 1956. In 1950, Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan authored the first annexe that would pave a path to the drafting of the Constitution. Elected in 1947, the first Constituent Assembly drafted and adopted its first constitution in 1956.

====1956 Constitution====
Following the adoption of a constitution in India in 1950, Pakistan&#x27;s lawmakers were incentified to work on their constitution. Prime Minister Chaudhry Muhammad Ali and his government officials worked with the opposition parties in the country to formulate a constitution for Pakistan.

Finally, the joint work led to the promulgation of the first set of the constitution on 23 March 1956—a day when Pakistan celebrates its Republic Day over the adoption of the constitution. The constitution provided for parliamentary form of government with a unicameral legislature. It officially adopted Pakistan as &quot;Islamic Republic&quot; and the principle of parity was introduced. Its features were:
* Islamic Republic of Pakistan – Official name of the country was adopted
* Objectives Resolution – The objective resolution was included as preamble by the constitution.
* System of government – Parliamentary with a prime minister as head of government.
* Unicameral Legislature – A single house, only a National Assembly that would consist of 300 members; 150 members from each East and West Pakistan
* President – Required to be a Muslim and ceremonial head of state. In case of internal or external danger she/he could declare a state of emergency in the country.
* Islamic law – No law would be passed against the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah.
* Independent Judiciary – The Supreme Court as an apex court – a final arbitrator of all the decisions.
* Fundamental rights included freedoms of movement, speech and, profession and profess religion, right to life, liberty, and property.
* Language – English, Urdu and Bengali were made national languages.

By the Constitution, Iskander Mirza assumed the presidency but his constant personal involvement in national affairs, contrary to the Constitution, resulted in the dismissal of four elected prime ministers in two years. On 7 October 1958 Mirza staged a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, imposed Martial law, abrogated the Constitution, and appointed the army chief General Ayub Khan as the Chief Martial Law Administrator. Shortly afterwards on 27 October 1958, General Ayub Khan deposed Mirza and declared himself president.

====1962 Constitution====
General Ayub Khan appointed a Constitution Commission to draft another part of the constitution under Chief Justice Muhammad Shahabuddin. Submitted its considerations on 6 May 1961, Ayub Khan altered the entire version of the constitution which was entirely different from the one recommended by Chief Justice Muhammad Shahabuddin. It was promulgated on 8 June 1962. Main feature of this set was the introduction of the presidential system and more consolidated powers to the President. No further changes were carried out to oppose the 1956 document. Its features includes:
*More powers to the President of Pakistan.
*Strengthening of the Islamic Ideology Council.

====1970 Legal Framework Order====
President Ayub Khan invited Chief of Army Staff General Yahya Khan to enforce the martial law in the country. On assuming the presidency, General Yahya Khan acceded to popular demands by abolishing the one-unit system in West Pakistan and ordered general elections on the principle of one man, one vote.

The military government and President Yahya himself made no efforts to frame a constitution, aside from issuing the extrajudicial order in 1970. Across the country, the expectations were that a National Assembly would be set up by holding a free and fair election. To hold the proposed elections, President Yahya promulgated a Legal Framework Order on 30 March 1970 that also spelled out the fundamental principles of the proposed constitution and the structure and composition of the national and provincial assemblies.

In December 1970, nationwide general elections were held simultaneously for both the national and five provincial assemblies. The nationalist Awami League (AL) secured the mandate of East Pakistan but failed to perform in any four provinces of Pakistan. The socialist Pakistan People&#x27;s Party (PPP) under the leadership of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto gained a mandate in Punjab and Sindh but failed in East Pakistan, NWFP and Balochistan.

====1970 constitutional crisis====
Constitutional crisis grew further when the AL refused to make concessions over its six points to draft the constitution and instead maintaining that the AL was able to frame a constitution and to form a central government on its own.

The PPP was not willing to dilute the authority of the federal government in spite of assuring full provincial autonomy for all the provinces of Pakistan. Negotiations on framing the work on constitution were held between January and March 1971 between leaders of the PPP, the AL, and the military government of Yahya Khan, which turned out to be a failure. Under the LFO, the President was to decide when the National Assembly was to meet. By 13 February 1971, the President Yahya announced that the National Assembly was to meet at Dhaka on 3 March 1971. By this time the differences between the main parties to the conflict had already crystallized. Over the six-point issue, the PPP was convinced that a federation based on the six points would lead to a feeble confederation in name only and was part of a larger Indian plan to break up and destroy Pakistan. These fears were evidently shared by the military leaders in the west, including President Yahya Khan who had publicly described Sheikh Mujibur Rehman as the &#x27;future Prime Minister of Pakistan&#x27; on 14 January 1971. Bhutto announced on 15 February that his party would not attend the National Assembly unless there was &#x27;some amount of reciprocity&#x27; from the Awami League. Sheikh Mujib replied at a press conference on 21 February, asserting that &quot;Our stand is absolutely clear. The constitution will be framed on the basis of the six points&quot;.

Such an announcement led the PPP to demand the removal of the National Assembly session, or the opening session to be postponed. The PPP threatened to stage a large scale general strike all over the country. Under pressure by the PPP, President Yahya postponed the National Assembly session on 25 March which came as a shattering disillusionment to the AL and their supporters throughout East Pakistan. It was seen as a betrayal and as proof of the authorities of the Pakistan to deny them the fruits of their electoral victory. This resulted in the outbreak of violence in East Pakistan. The Awami League launched a non-co-operation movement as they virtually controlled the entire province. Due to disturbances in East Pakistan, no National Assembly session was called and the military moved into East Pakistan and executed Operation Searchlight. The civil disobedience movement turned into an armed liberation movement backed by India.

With India successfully intervening in the conflict, the Pakistan military surrendered to the Indian military and almost 93,000 military personnel were taken as prisoners of war on 16 December 1971. Demoralized, gaining notoriety in the country, and finding himself unable to control the situation, President Yahya ultimately handed over the national power to the PPP, of which Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was sworn in on 20 December 1971 as President and as the (first civilian) Chief Martial Law Administrator.

==Constitutional convention==

After Bangladesh was formed in 1971, the PPP formed the government and partially enacted the 1962 constitution. President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto called for a constitutional convention and invited the leaders of the all political parties to meet him on 17 April 1972. Leaders and constitutional experts of the Islamic political parties, conservative parties, socialists and communist parties were delegated to attend the constitutional convention in 1972.

===Drafting and ratification===

The law experts, constitutional analysts, and country&#x27;s reputed clergymen worked on formulating a constitution that they hoped would represent the will and desire of people. Unlike earlier attempts, the convention was not meant for new laws or piecemeal alterations, but for the &quot;sole and express purpose of revising the 1956 articles.&quot; Also, the convention was not limited to the religion, of government and the preservation of the State; rather it was intended to maintain delicacy in commerce, finances, issue of loans to federation, and Separation of powers. Several key ideas of the philosophy of John Locke and Islamic provisions on civil rights were interchanged in the Constitution.

The Constitution ultimately established a bicameral Parliament, with the National Assembly as the lower house and the Senate as the upper house. It also established the parliamentary form of government with Prime Minister as its head of government; the elected National Assembly genuinely representing the will of the people. The Constitution truly maintained a delicate balance between traditionalists and modernists and reflected heavy compromises on fundamental religious rights in the country. The fundamental rights, freedoms of speech, religion, press, movement, association, thought, and intellectual, life, liberty and property and right to bear arms were introduced in the new Constitution. Islam was declared as the State religion of Pakistan. Geography and border statue of the country was redefined and &quot;Pakistan was to be a Federation of Four Provinces.&quot; The Constitution was written in the point of representing the conservative Islam as well as reflecting a heavy compromise over the religious rights and humanism ideas, advocated by the PPP.

On 20 October 1972, the draft was revived by all leaders of the political parties and signed the declaration of adopting the Constitution in the National Assembly on 2 February 1973. Ratified unanimously on 19 April 1973, the Constitution came into full effect on 14 August 1973. On the same day, the successful vote of confidence movement in the Parliament endorsed Zulfikar Bhutto as the elected Prime Minister after latter relinquishing the presidency after appointing Fazal-i-Ilahi to that office.

==Structure==

===Fundamental rights===

Contrary to Constitution of 1956 and Constitution of 1962, several ideas in the Constitution were new, and guaranteed security to each citizen of Pakistan. First part of the Constitution introduced the definition of &quot;State&quot;, the idea of life, liberty and property, individual equality, prohibition of slavery, preservation of languages, right to fair trial, and provided safeguard as to arrest and detention as well as providing safeguards against discrimination in services.

The due process clause of the Constitution was partly based on the British Common law, as many founding fathers and legal experts of the country had followed the British legal tradition. The fundamental rights are supreme in the Constitution and any law that is &quot;ultra vires&quot; the fundamental rights can be struck down by the Apex Courts in their constitutional jurisdiction vested on them under Article 199 of the Constitution.

===Provisions===

In contrast to the constitutions of India and Bangladesh, the Constitution reflected a heavy compromise over several issues to maintain a delicate balance of power among the country&#x27;s institutions. The Constitution defined the role of Islam; Pakistan was to be a Federation of Four Provinces and shall be known as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan; introduction of check and balances, separation of powers, and provided the federal system under which the government should govern.

The Constitution established a &quot;Bicameral Parliament&quot; as a legislative authority that consists of the Senate as Upper house (providing equal provincial representation), and National Assembly as Lower house (providing the will and representation of people). The Constitution put stipulation on the eligibility of becoming President and Prime Minister that only &quot;Muslim&quot; of not less than forty-five years of age and is qualified for becoming the Prime Minister. No law repugnant to Islam shall be enacted and the present laws shall also be Islamised. The Constitution also introduced a new institution known as the &quot;Council of Common Interests&quot; consisting of Chief Minister of each four provinces and an equal number of Cabinet ministers of the Government nominated by the Prime Minister. The Council could formulate and regulate the policy in the Part II of the Legislative List. In case of complaint of interference in water supply by any province the Council would look into the complaint.

Another major innovative introduction in the Constitution is the establishment of the National Finance Commission (NFC) consisting of the Provincial and Finance Ministers and other members to advice on distribution of revenues between the federation and the provinces. The Constitution&#x27;s first parts introduce the Islamic way of life, promotion of local government, full participation of women in national life, protection of minorities, promotion of social and economic well being of the people, and strengthening the bonds with the Muslim world and to work for international peace.

Under the Constitution, the Fundamental Rights include security of person, safeguards as to arrest and detention, prohibition of slavery and forced labour, freedom of movement, freedom of association, freedom of speech, freedom to profess religion and safeguards to religious institutions, non-discrimination in respect of access to public places and in service, preservation of languages, script and culture. The judiciary enjoys full supremacy over the other organs of the state. About national languages, Urdu was declared as national languages, and English as official language; all other languages were preserved by the Constitution.

===Islamic introduction===

Many key ideas on regarding the role of Islam in the State that were mentioned in 1956 Articles were made part of the Constitution:
* The official name &quot;Islamic Republic of Pakistan&quot; as selected for the state of Pakistan.
* Islam is declared as the state religion of Pakistan.
* Enabling of living life, culture, and customs of Muslims, individually or collectively, in accordance with the fundamental principles and basic concepts of Islam.
* Teachings on Arabic, Quran, and &quot;Islamiyat&quot; to be compulsory in country&#x27;s institutions and to secure correct and exact printing and publishing of the Quran.
* Proper organisations of &quot;Zakat&quot;, &quot;Waqf&quot;, and mosques is ensured.
* Prevent prostitution, gambling and consumption of alcohol, printing, publication, circulation, pornography, and display of obscene literature and advertisements.
* Required to be a Muslim to run for bid of becoming the President (male or female) and/or Prime Minister (male or female). No restriction as to religion or gender on any other post, up to and including provincial governor and Chief Minister.
* All existing laws shall be brought in conformity with the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Quran and Sunnah and no law shall be enacted which is repugnant to such injunctions.
* A Council of Islamic Ideology shall be constituted referred to as the Islamic advisory council. 
* The Constitution of Pakistan defined a Muslim as a person who believes in the unity and oneness of Allah, in the absolute and unqualified finality of the Prophethood of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, and does not believe in, or recognise as a prophet or religious reformer, any person who claimed or claims to be a prophet, in any sense of the word or of any description whatsoever, after Muhammad.
* In keeping with this definition, the Second Amendment to the Constitution (1974) declared for the first time the Ahmadiyya Community and/or the Lahori Group as non-Muslims, since their leader, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, claimed to be prophet of God.
* However, the Fourth Amendment (1975) set aside six seats in the National Assembly for non-Muslim representatives to protect minority rights.
* The state shall endeavour to strengthen the bonds of unity among Muslim countries.
*Islamic revisions were introduced into the Pakistan Penal Code.
===Parts===
The individual Articles of the Constitution are grouped together into the following Parts:

*Preamble
* Part I – Introductory 
* Part II – Fundamental Rights and Principles of Policy 
* Part III – The Federation of Pakistan 
* Part IV – Provinces 
* Part V – Relations between Federation and Provinces 
* Part VI – Finance, Property, Contracts and Suits 
* Part VII – The Judicature 
* Part VIII – Elections 
* Part IX – Islamic Provisions 
* Part X – Emergency Provisions 
* Part XI – Amendment of Constitution 
* Part XII – Miscellaneous 
===Schedule===
Schedules are lists in the Constitution that categorise and tabulate bureaucratic activity and policy of the Government.

*First Schedule – 
*Second Schedule – 
*Third Schedule: – 
*Fourth Schedule: – 
*Fifth Schedule: – 

==Amendments==
Unlike the previous documents, the Constitution cannot be changed, instead constitutional amendments are passed; altering its effect. Amendments to the Constitution are made through the Parliament, where a Two-thirds majority and voting is required in both houses for a constitutional amendment to take its effect, in accordance to the Constitution. In addition to this, certain amendments which pertain to the federal nature of the Constitution must be ratified by a majority of provincial legislatures.

, 25 amendments have been made to the Constitution. Among the most important of these are the Eighth (1985) and Seventeenth Amendments (2004), which changed the government from a parliamentary system to a semi-presidential system. By far the largest change to the Constitution was the Eighteenth Amendment made in 2010 which reversed these expansions of presidential powers, returning the government to a parliamentary republic, and also defined any attempt to subvert, abrogate, or suspend the constitution as an act of high treason. Another significant amendment was the second amendment which declared Ahmadis to be non-Muslims. It was unanimously passed by parliament in 1974.

In these amendments, the Twenty-Fifth amendment incorporated the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas into the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

In 2024, the Twenty-Sixth Constitutional Amendment Act was enacted on October 21st, introducing landmark reforms to Pakistan&#x27;s judicial system, with a focus on the Supreme Court and High Courts.

<doc id="304827" wikidata="Q1430760" url="?curid=304827" title="Louis d'or">
<text>The Louis d&#x27;or () is any number of French coins first introduced by Louis XIII in 1640. The name derives from the depiction of the portrait of King Louis on one side of the coin; the French royal coat of arms is on the reverse. The coin was replaced by the French franc at the time of the revolution and later the similarly valued Napoléon. The actual value of the coins fluctuated according to monetary and fiscal policy (see livre tournois), but in 1726 the value was stabilized.

The 1640 issue of Louis d’or contained five denominations: a half Louis and a one, two, four, and eight Louis. All subsequent issues through 1793 were only denominated in half, one, and two Louis.

==Louis XIII==

The Louis d&#x27;or (a gold coin) replaced the franc which had been in circulation (in theory) since John II. In actual practice the principal gold coin circulating in France in the earlier 17th century had been Spanish: the 6.7-gram double &quot;escudo&quot; or &quot;doubloon&quot;, of which the &quot;Louis d&#x27;or&quot; was an explicit copy. There also existed a half-Louis coin (the &quot;demi-louis d&#x27;or&quot;) and a two-Louis coin (the &quot;double louis d&#x27;or&quot;).

The Louis d&#x27;or fixed several problems with previous French gold coinage. Louis XIII previously struck coins from 23 carat gold even though Charles V had made 22 carats the de facto international standard for gold coinage a century earlier. Royal edicts had set the official values of his gold coins so low that it was profitable to export them. Since they were still made by hand, cheaters could shave bits of gold from the edges of the coins before passing them on, an illegal process called clipping. To fix this, Jean Varin, a medalist from Liège, installed machinery in the Paris mint which made perfectly round coins so that clipping could not go undetected. The new demi Louis d&#x27;or maintained the weight of the old écu d’or, but decreasing its fineness to 22 carats, allowing it to circulate at a value of five livres. Its double, the Louis d&#x27;or, had the weight and fineness of the Spanish pistole, or two escudo coins, which was an international trade currency.

Smaller values were available through a number of silver coins – the écu (sometimes called the &quot;louis d&#x27;argent&quot;), also available in , and écu denominations (60, 30 and 15 &quot;sous&quot;) – and copper coins: sous (&quot;s&quot;.) and deniers (&quot;d&quot;.).

The Louis d&#x27;or under Louis XIII had a dimension of about 25 mm, and a weight of 6.75 g.
* Recto: the king&#x27;s head turned to the right with the motto &quot;LVD XIII DG – FR ET NAV REX&quot; ( &quot;Louis XIII, by the grace of God king of France and of Navarre&quot;).
* Verso: the royal monogram (4 double &quot;L&quot;s surmounted by a crown with fleur de lis) and the motto &quot;CHRS REGN VINC IMP&quot; ( &quot;Christ reigns, conquers and commands&quot;).
* Engraver: Jean Varin (1604–1672)

The double louis has a size of 28.5 mm and a weight of 13.47 g. The quatruple louis has a size of 35 mm and a weight of 26.88 g. The 10 louis has a size of 44 mm and a weight of 66.87 g. One of these was sold in 2012 for 210,000 euros, which makes it the most expensive French coin of any time. The half louis has a size of 20 mm and a weight of 3.34 g.

==Louis XIV==

The Louis d&#x27;or under Louis XIV was similar in most respects to its predecessor and had a dimension of +/- 25 mm, and a weight of 6.75 g.
* Recto: the king&#x27;s head turned to the right with the motto &quot;LVD XIIII DG – FR ET NAV REX&quot; ( &quot;Louis XIV, by the grace of God king of France and of Navarre&quot;).
* Verso: the royal monogram (4 double &quot;L&quot;s surmounted by a crown with fleur de lis) and the motto &quot;CHRS REGN VINC IMP&quot; (&quot;Christ reigns, defeats and commands&quot;).
* Engraver: Jean Varin (1604–1672)

==Louis XV==

Under Louis XV, mintage of the Louis d’or was at first reduced while John Law introduced paper money. After Law&#x27;s system failed and Cardinal Fleury became Louis XV&#x27;s chief magistrate in 1726, France returned to a policy of sound money and the mintage of the Louis d’or returned to normal levels. The weight of the Louis d’or was now increased to 8.1580 g and gold content of 0.2405 troy oz, it was revalued at 20 &quot;livres&quot; (₶.), and a commitment was made to maintain this valuation. This promise was kept until 1740 when the louis d’or was revalued to 24 ₶., thereby effecting a 20% devaluation of the livre. This was the last devaluation until the French revolution replaced the louis d’or by the franc.
* Recto: Crowned young head. Notable changes were made to the portrait when the weight of the Louis d’or was stabilized in 1726 and when it was revalued in 1740.
* Verso: The early coinage of Louis XV has a variety of rapidly changing reverse types. When the value of the Louis d’or was stabilized in 1726, a reverse type with the coats of arms of France and Navarre in two ovals was adopted. This reverse earned the coin the nickname &quot;Louis aux lunettes&quot;, i.e. Louis with glasses.
* Engraver: Norbert Roettiers (1703–1748)

==Louis XVI==

The Louis d&#x27;or under Louis XVI was minted between 1785 and 1792 and had a dimension of 23 mm, and a weight of 7.6490 g, a fineness of 0.917, and gold content of 0.2255 troy oz. The double louis has a size of 28.5 mm and a weight of 15.26 g.
* Recto: the king&#x27;s head turned to the left with the motto &quot;LVD XVI DG – FR ET NAV REX&quot; ( &quot;Louis XVI, by the grace of God king of France and of Navarre&quot;).
* Verso: Crowned arms of France and Navarre.
* Engraver: B. Duvivier

==Louis d&#x27;or &quot;constitutionnel&quot;==
During the French Revolution there was a coin named the &quot;Louis d&#x27;or constitutionnel&quot;, a coin of the First French Republic. Engraved on the coin is &quot;24 livres&quot;.

==Louis XVIII==
Contrary to what one might expect, the 20-franc gold coin under Louis XVIII was not a Louis d&#x27;or but a Napoléon gold coin. Because of the new monetary law under Napoleon I, all the 20 francs gold coins from Napoleon I to the 20-franc &quot;coq&quot; are Napoleon gold coins.

==Royal Canadian Mint issues==
In July 1725, the ship &quot;Chameau&quot; left France for Quebec, carrying dozens of military and political VIPs and a fortune in gold and silver, but sank near the end of the voyage. In 1961, a discovery of cannons scattered on the sea bottom alerted Alex Storm, a diver working part-time on a fishing trawler from Louisbourg. Storm carefully mapped the wreckage of the Chameau to locate the treasure compartment. In 1965, after several years of searching, the gold was found and the mystery of the treasure was solved.

The Royal Canadian Mint commemorated this by creating a 1/20th ounce gold coin. The coin was released in October 2006 and was composed of 99.99% pure gold. Its face value was one Canadian dollar and had a limited mintage of 10,000 coins. This numismatic coin, named the Gold Louis, had a weight of 1.555 grams and a diameter of 14.1 mm. Obverse: Queen Elizabeth II. Reverse: the royal monogram (4 double &quot;L&quot;s) surmounted by a crown with fleur de lis and the motto &quot;CHRS REGN VINC IMP&quot; (&quot;Christus regnat, vincit, et imperat&quot;. Latin &gt; &quot;Christ reigns, conquers and commands&quot;). Engravers: Royal Canadian Mint engravers.

<doc id="304829" wikidata="Q715265" url="?curid=304829" title="Wesley Willis">
<text>Wesley Lawrence Willis (May 31, 1963 – August 21, 2003) was an American musician and visual artist. Diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1989, Willis began a career as an underground singer-songwriter in the outsider music tradition. Willis&#x27; songs are typically partially spoken in an MC style, and partially sung in a nasal and out-of-tune manner reminiscent of punk rock vocals. They feature bizarre, humorous and sometimes obscene or absurd lyrics sung over backing created by using the auto accompaniment feature on his Technics KN keyboard. His songs cover a wide variety of topics, with mental illness and consumerism being the most prominent themes. He is best known for songs such as &quot;Rock N Roll McDonald&#x27;s&quot; as well as a series of songs where he would directly insult his demons.

Willis gained a large cult following in the 1990s, particularly after the release of his 1995 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album on the Alternative Tentacles label. Jello Biafra compiled the album&#x27;s track list. In addition to a large body of solo musical work, Willis fronted his own punk rock band, the Wesley Willis Fiasco, during the 1990s. He was a visual artist long before he developed an interest in music, and produced hundreds of intricate, unusual, colored ink-pen drawings, most of them depicting Chicago streetscapes; he frequently sold these on the street for between $20 and $40.

Despite his mainly underground career, Willis has influenced a variety of media. For example, music software company Nullsoft took their slogan &quot;It really whips the llama&#x27;s ass!&quot; for Winamp from Willis&#x27;s song &quot;Whip the Llama&#x27;s Ass&quot;.

==Life and career==
Willis was born in Chicago, Illinois, on May 31, 1963, to Walter and Annie Willis. He had a brother named Ricky, who is also a disabled artist; he also has another brother, Jerry, who worked as an exterminator as of 2014. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Willis grew up in Chicago&#x27;s projects as one of 10 children of parents who had a violent relationship and separated when he was young; he spent time in several foster homes and was essentially raised by two older brothers, who went with him from home to home.&quot; Willis began hearing voices during a period of living at his mother&#x27;s home in the 1980s, when her abusive boyfriend Roger Lee Carpenter held a gun to his head and robbed him of $600 Willis had saved. By the end of the 1980s, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and institutionalized for two months after his diagnosis.

During childhood, Willis developed an interest in art, and in 1988, he was featured in a Chicago public access documentary feature created by Carl W. Hart titled &quot;Wesley Willis: Artist of the Streets&quot;. In &quot;Artist of the Streets&quot;, he was shown walking through Chicago&#x27;s Loop neighborhood, producing his ink pen drawings outside of the Marshall Field and Company Building, and interacting with people curious about his art. The drawings typically encompass detailed Chicago streetscapes, including buildings, vehicles, trees, and landmarks. Willis was known for his ability to draw from memory a completely different location than the one in which he was sitting. During his lifetime, he frequently gave his drawings away to friends or sold them for small amounts (typically $10 or $20) in Chicago parks. However, after his death, Willis began to receive recognition in the art community for his large body of visual art. In 2008 his artwork was exhibited at the Mohamed Khalil Museum of Egypt, and he was the subject of a special exhibit entitled &quot;Drawn By Wesley Willis&quot; at Dominican University.

In 1991, after befriending some musicians from Chicago&#x27;s alternative rock scene and recording several solo albums, he formed the punk rock band the Wesley Willis Fiasco. The band developed a popular underground following as well as attention from musicians such as Eddie Vedder, Henry Rollins, Mike D., Jello Biafra, and the members of White Zombie; and soon caught the attention of Rick Rubin at American Recordings, an independent label distributed by Warner Bros. Records. In early 1994, Willis recorded with the Canadian industrial-metal band Monster Voodoo Machine and appeared on their Juno Award-winning debut studio album &quot;Suffersystem&quot; (RCA Records). In 1995, American Recordings signed Willis as a solo musician; the Wesley Willis Fiasco subsequently broke up in 1996. He went on to record numerous solo albums of novelty rock (two for American Recordings and the remainder for several independent labels or recorded, marketed and released independently by Willis himself), toured frequently, and was profiled on MTV. On September 26, 1996, he was a guest on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; where he played nearly identical songs about Baba Booey and Howard Stern. During his many tours and live appearances, Willis became &quot;famous for greeting fans with a headbutt&quot;; this left him with a distinctive permanent bruise on his forehead.

==Death==
On August 21, 2003, Willis died due to complications from chronic myelogenous leukemia in Skokie, Illinois, at age 40.

==Legacy==
In 2013, a supporting character named Milan was introduced for the ongoing &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; comic. A blind demigod with the power of far-sight and half-brother to Wonder Woman, his physical appearance and mannerisms are based on Wesley Willis.

Willis has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star &quot;might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis&quot;, according to journalist Steve Marsh.

==Song structure and themes==
&quot;Hellride&quot; was the term used by Willis to describe his encounters with &quot;demons&quot; (delusions brought on by schizophrenia), which occurred mainly on the CTA bus lines in Chicago. According to Willis, his demons were trying to ruin his &quot;Harmony Joy Music&quot; or &quot;Joy Rides&quot;. Every song ends with Willis saying the phrase &quot;rock over London, rock on Chicago&quot;, plus a commercial tagline, such as &quot;Wheaties: Breakfast of Champions&quot;, or &quot;Ford: Quality is Job One&quot;.

The Wesley Willis Fiasco songs were punk rock songs with Willis howling his obscene, absurd rants as lyrics. The band recorded three cover songs, including of Thin Lizzy&#x27;s &quot;Jailbreak&quot;, though the band only released one album.

As a solo artist, Willis filled his albums with funny, bizarre, tense, and often obscene statements about crime, fast food, cultural trends, bus routes, violent confrontations with superheroes, and commands for his &quot;demons&quot; to engage in bestiality (in &quot;The Daddy of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, Willis explained that these songs would &quot;gross out&quot; the demons enough to make them leave him alone).

Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that despite Willis&#x27; prolific output his songs were essentially variations on the same simple structure, melody and lyrical themes. He also questioned record company motives for releasing albums by Willis: &quot;It&#x27;s certainly admirable that Willis has decided to not be tied down by his schizophrenia, but it often seems that his audience is laughing at him, not with him.&quot; Erlewine also wrote that listening to a Willis record felt &quot;exploitive&quot;.

==Partial discography==

<doc id="304831" wikidata="Q1898121" url="?curid=304831" title="List of films voted the best">
<text>This is a list of films voted the best in national and international surveys of critics and the public.

Some surveys focus on all films, while others focus on a particular genre or country. Voting systems differ, and some surveys suffer from biases such as self-selection or skewed demographics, while others may be susceptible to forms of interference such as vote stacking.
== Critics and filmmakers ==
=== &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; ===
Every decade, starting in 1952, the British film magazine &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; asks an international group of film critics to vote for the greatest film of all time. Since 1992, they have invited directors to vote in a separate poll. Sixty-three critics participated in 1952, 70 critics in 1962, 89 critics in 1972, 122 critics in 1982, 132 critics and 101 directors in 1992, 145 critics and 108 directors in 2002, 846 critics and 358 directors in 2012, and 1639 critics and 480 directors in 2022.

<text>Atari Games Corporation was an American producer of arcade video games, active from 1985 to 1999, then as Midway Games West Inc. until 2003. It was formed when the coin-operated video game division of Atari, Inc. was transferred by its owner Warner Communications to a joint venture with Namco, being one of several successor companies to use the name Atari.

The company developed and published games for arcades under the Atari brand, and across consumer home systems such as the Commodore 16, Commodore 64, Game Boy, Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and others using the Tengen label for legal reasons. Some of the games Atari Games had developed include &quot;Tetris, Road Runner, RoadBlasters,&quot; &quot;Primal Rage, Hard Drivin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;San Francisco Rush&quot;.

Atari Games effectively operated independently from 1987, when Namco sold its controlling stake, until Time Warner reassumed full ownership in 1994, and it was consolidated into Time Warner Interactive. In 1996, Atari Games was sold to WMS Industries, and the company then became part of Midway Games when that company was spun-off by WMS in 1998. After dropping the Atari name, it ceased operations in 2003; its former assets were later sold back to Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment (now Warner Bros. Games) in 2009 following Midway&#x27;s bankruptcy.

==History==
When the Atari, Inc. division of Warner Communications lost $500 million in the first three quarters of 1983, its arcade coin-op division was the only one to make money. In 1984, Warner sold Atari&#x27;s consumer products division to Jack Tramiel; he named this company Atari Corporation. Warner retained the coin-op division and a few other assets and changed the name of Atari, Inc. to Atari Games, Inc. The agreement between Tramiel and Warner Communications was that Atari Games must always include the &quot;Games&quot; after &quot;Atari&quot; on its logo and that Atari Games could not use the Atari brand at all in the consumer market (computers and home consoles). Atari Games retained most of the same employees and managers that had worked at the old Atari Inc. It was able to carry on with many of its projects from before the transition. Atari Corp., in contrast, froze projects and streamlined staff and operations. In 1985, Warner Communications and Namco jointly formed a new corporation, AT Games, Inc., and Warner transferred the coin-operated games division of Atari Games to the new corporate entity. Namco owned the controlling interest in the new company, while Warner retained 40%. Warner subsequently renamed Atari Games, Inc. to Atari Holdings, Inc., and AT Games became Atari Games Corporation. Namco later lost interest in operating Atari Games and sold 33% of its shares to a group of employees led by Hideyuki Nakajima, who had been the president of Atari Games since 1985. As the company was now split between three entities, Warner (40%), Namco (40%), and the employees (20%), and none of them held a controlling share, Atari Games effectively became an independent company. Atari Ireland was a subsidiary of Atari Games that manufactured their games for the European market; while under Namco, Atari Ireland also manufactured Sega&#x27;s &quot;Hang-On&quot; (1985) for the European market.

Atari Games continued to manufacture arcade games and units, and starting in 1988, also sold cartridges for the Nintendo Entertainment System under the Tengen brand name. The Tengen name was used for its home consumer division that released games, while its home games were mainly developed by Atari Games staff. The companies exchanged a number of lawsuits in the late 1980s related to disputes over the rights to &quot;Tetris&quot;, of which Tengen had published a version for the NES, and Tengen&#x27;s circumvention of Nintendo&#x27;s lockout chip, which prevented third parties from creating unauthorized games. (Atari Games&#x27; legal battles with Nintendo were separate from those of Atari Corporation, which also exchanged lawsuits with Nintendo in the late 1980s and early 1990s.) The suit finally reached a settlement in 1994, with Atari Games paying Nintendo cash damages and use of several patent licenses.

In 1992, Richard Seaborne, who had previously programmed the NES version of &quot;Cyberball&quot; on a freelance basis for Atari, was hired by Atari to develop sports titles for a variety of consoles, most notably Sega Genesis.

In 1989, Warner Communications merged with Time Inc., forming Time Warner. In 1994, Time Warner reacquired a controlling interest in Atari Games and made it a subsidiary of its Time Warner Interactive division. While the company initially maintained the Atari Games brand for arcade games under the new ownership, the Tengen brand was dropped in favor of the Time Warner Interactive label for its home console games. In mid-1994, the Atari Games, Tengen, and Time Warner Interactive Group names were all consolidated under the Time Warner Interactive banner.

On July 12, 1994, Nakajima died at the age of 64. Ed Logg, who was a chief programmer of Atari, briefly left the company for Electronic Arts, only to rejoin Atari Games in 1995 to run its home console games. Time Warner Interactive, via Atari Games became a member of the Nintendo Ultra 64&#x27;s Dream Team in the mid-1990s.

In April 1996, after an unsuccessful bid by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, the company was sold to WMS Industries, owners of the Williams, Bally and Midway arcade brands, which restored the use of the Atari Games name, while the home consumer division was folded into Williams Entertainment, with its existing home consumer division was kept. According to Atari Games president Dan Van Elderen, in 1995, Time Warner decided to exit the video game business and instructed the management at Atari Games to find a buyer for themselves, which surprised him because usually parent companies choose the buyers for their subsidiaries. Time Warner would not return to the video game business until the formation of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment on January 14, 2004.

On April 6, 1998, the video game assets of WMS Industries were spun off as a new independent company called Midway Games, which then gained control of the Atari Games division. Meanwhile, Hasbro Interactive acquired the Atari brand for the home market from JTS Corporation that same year. With the changes in ownership of the two companies, on November 19, 1999, Atari Games Corporation was renamed Midway Games West Inc., resulting in the Atari Games name no longer being used.

In 2001, Midway Games exited the arcade industry, due to a decline in the market. Despite this, Midway Games West continued to produce games for the home market until it was disbanded on February 7, 2003, after a slump in game sales. The studio&#x27;s closure costed the jobs of 30 employees, including three members who had been with Atari since the 1970s. Two previously announced titles, &quot;Nitrocity&quot; and &quot;Gladiator: The Crimson Reign&quot;, were also cancelled in the process.

Although no longer in operation, Midway Games West continued to exist as a holding entity for the copyrights and trademarks of the games originally from Atari Games. In February 2009, Midway Games filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and in July 2009, most of Midway&#x27;s assets were sold to Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, ultimately bringing all of the Atari Games properties back to Time Warner again.

<text>William Meade Fishback (November 5, 1831February 9, 1903) was a lawyer and politician who served as the 17th Governor of Arkansas from 1893 to 1895 and U.S. Senator-elect for Arkansas. He also served in the Arkansas House of Representatives. He was a Unionist and served in the Union Army. He was a delegate at Arkansas&#x27; 1874 Constitutional Convention.

== Early life==
Fishback was born in Jeffersonton, Virginia, in Culpeper County, Virginia, the son of Sophia Ann (Yates) and Frederick Fishback. He is third cousins with James Sevier Conway. He graduated with a law degree from the University of Virginia in 1855.

==Career==
In 1857, Fishback moved to Springfield, Illinois, where he was admitted to the bar and briefly practiced law. During his time in Springfield, he came into contact with Abraham Lincoln and handled foreclosure proceedings for his firm, Lincoln &amp; Herndon. 

He moved to the frontier region of Sebastian County, Arkansas in 1858 and began practicing in Greenwood shortly thereafter. In 1861, Fishback was elected to the Arkansas Secession Convention as a pro-Union delegate. After the convention voted in favor of secession, he fled to Missouri and took an oath of allegiance to the Union. 

Fishback followed the Union Army back into Arkansas in 1863 and was appointed Colonel of the 4th Arkansas Cavalry (USA). He raised 900 soldiers, although his efforts to restore Arkansas into the Union prevented him from leading the regiment. Upon his return to Arkansas, Fishback established a pro-Union newspaper called &quot;The Unconditional Union&quot;, urging voters to ratify the new state constitution that abolished slavery and repudiated secession. In December 1863, he represented 17-year-old David Owen Dodd, who was convicted of spying.

Fishback and Elisha Baxter were selected to represent Arkansas in the United States Senate in 1864, but their admission was blocked in February 1865 as Arkansas had not yet been readmitted into the Union. After serving as a federal treasury agent following the conclusion of the Civil War, Fishback returned to Sebastian County, reopened a law office in Fort Smith and spent the next decade building his practice into one of the most prosperous in western Arkansas.
Fishback was a delegate to the 1874 Arkansas Constitutional Convention. He served as a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1871 to 1881. In 1885 he represented Sebastian County. His occupation was listed as farmer and his post office at Fort Smith. He introduced what came to be known as the &quot;Fishback Amendment&quot;, now known as Amendment 1 (codified as Article 20) of the Arkansas Constitution. This amendment prohibited the state authorities from paying the Holford railroad aid and levee bonds. Failure to pay the Holford debt created credit problems for the state that lasted well into the 20th century.

On September 5, 1892, Fishback was elected Governor of Arkansas. Fishback&#x27;s administration focused on changing the national image of the state. During his term, the St. Francis River levee district was formed. Fishback served as governor until 1895 when he left public office and worked to attract business to the state.

==Death==
Fishback died of a stroke. He is buried at Oak Cemetery in Fort Smith, Arkansas.

<text>The San Joaquin River ( ; ) is the longest river of Central California. The long river starts in the high Sierra Nevada and flows through the rich agricultural region of the northern San Joaquin Valley before reaching Suisun Bay, San Francisco Bay, and the Pacific Ocean. An important source of irrigation water as well as a wildlife corridor, the San Joaquin is among the most heavily dammed and diverted of California&#x27;s rivers.

People have inhabited the San Joaquin Valley for more than 8,000 years, and it was one of the major population centers of pre-Columbian California. Starting in the late 18th century, successive waves of explorers then settlers, mainly Spanish and American, emigrated to the San Joaquin basin. When Spain colonized the area, they sent soldiers from Mexico, who were usually of mixed native Mexican and Spanish birth, led by Spanish officers. Franciscan missionaries from Spain came with expeditions to evangelize the natives by teaching them about the Catholic faith.

Once an inland sea, most of the San Joaquin Valley has a very uniform topography, and much of the lower river formed a huge flood basin. In the 20th century, many levees and dams were built on the San Joaquin and all of its major tributaries. These engineering works changed the fluctuating nature of the river forever and cut off the Tulare Basin from the rest of the San Joaquin watershed. Once a habitat for hundreds of thousands of spawning salmon and millions of migratory birds, today the river is subject to tremendous water supply, navigation, and regulation works by various federal agencies, which have dramatically reduced the flow of the river since the 20th century.

==Name==
The river was called many different names; at times different parts of the river were known by different names. The southern Yokuts called the river, Tihshachu (Tih-shah-choo), meaning salmon-spearing place. The present name of the river dates to 1805–1808, when Spanish explorer Gabriel Moraga was surveying east from Mission San José in order to find possible sites for a mission. Moraga named a tributary of the river (it is not known which one) for Saint Joachim, husband of Saint Anne and father of Mary, the mother of Jesus. The name Moraga chose was later applied to the entire river; it was in common use by 1810.

In 1827, Jedediah Smith wrote in his journal that an unknown group of Native Americans called the river the &quot;Peticutry&quot;, a name which is listed as a variant in the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Geographic Names Information System.

In the Mono language, the river is called &quot;typici h huu&quot;&#x27;, which means &quot;important or great river.&quot;

An earlier name for the lower section of the San Joaquin was &quot;Rio de San Francisco&quot;, which was the name Father Juan Crespí gave to the river he could see entering the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta from the south. A member of the Pedro Fages party in 1772, Crespi&#x27;s vantage point was the hilltops behind modern Antioch. Another early name was &quot;Rio San Juan Bautista&quot;, the origin of which is unknown.

==Course==


The river&#x27;s source is located in the Ansel Adams Wilderness, in the south-central Sierra Nevada at the confluence of three major affluents: the Middle Fork, which rises from Thousand Island Lake at almost above sea level, meets the North Fork, which starts southeast of Mount Lyell, and the South Fork, which begins at Martha Lake in Kings Canyon National Park and flows through Florence Lake, joins a short distance downstream. The Middle Fork is considered the largest of the 3 forks. From the mountainous alpine headwaters, the San Joaquin flows generally south into the foothills of the Sierra, passing through four hydroelectric dams. It eventually emerges from the foothills at what was once the town of Millerton, the location of Friant Dam since 1942, which forms Millerton Lake.

Below Friant Dam (RM267), the San Joaquin flows west-southwest out into the San Joaquin Valley – the southern part of the Great Central Valley – passing north of Fresno. With most of its water diverted into aqueducts, the river frequently runs dry in a 150-mile section. This lack of riverwater begins in the between Friant Dam and Mendota, where it is only replenished by the Delta-Mendota Canal (RM 205) and the Fresno Slough, when the Kings River is flooding. From Mendota, the San Joaquin swings northwest, passing through many different channels, some natural and some man-made. Northeast of Dos Palos, it is only joined by the Fresno and Chowchilla Rivers when they reach flood stage. downstream, the Merced River empties into an otherwise dry San Joaquin (RM118).

The majority of the river flows through quiet agricultural bottom lands, and as a result its meandering course manages to avoid most of the urban areas and cities in the San Joaquin Valley. About west of Modesto, the San Joaquin meets its largest tributary, the Tuolumne. Near Vernalis, it is joined by another major tributary, the Stanislaus River. The river passes between Manteca and Tracy, where a pair of distributaries – the Old River and Middle River – split off from the main stem just above the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, a huge inverted river delta formed by sediment deposits of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.

About from the mouth, the river draws abreast to the western flank of Stockton, one of the basin&#x27;s largest cities. From here to the mouth, the river is dredged as part of a navigation project, the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel. Past the head of tide, amid the many islands of the delta, the San Joaquin is joined by two more tributaries: the Calaveras River and the larger Mokelumne. The river grows to almost wide before ending at its confluence with the Sacramento River, in Antioch, forming the head of Suisun Bay. The combined waters from the two rivers then flow west through the Carquinez Strait and San Francisco Bay into the Pacific.

===Discharge===
The natural annual discharge of the San Joaquin before agricultural development is believed to have been between 6–7.9 million acre feet (7.4–9.7 million m3), equaling a flow of roughly . Some early estimates even range as high as 14 million acre-feet (17.3 million m3), or more than . The numerous tributaries of the San Joaquin – the Fresno, Chowchilla, Merced, Tuolumne, Mariposa Creek, Calaveras, Mokelumne, and others – flowed freely across alluvial flood plains to join the river. All of the major tributaries of the river originate in the Sierra Nevada; most of the streams that start in the Coast Range are intermittent, and contribute little to the flow of the San Joaquin. During the winter, spring, and early summer, storms and snowmelt swell the river; in 1914 – before the development of major dams and irrigation diversions – the California Department of Engineering estimated the river&#x27;s flow in full flood at . In late summer and autumn, there is little water left over to replenish stream flow. Historically, groundwater seepage from Tulare Lake maintained a significant base flow in the river during the dry months – some accounts suggest over 50 percent.

The present conditions of the San Joaquin River at Friant Dam, the average discharge was , or 0.234 million acre-feet per year. The highest average discharge between 1941 and 2015 was in 1983 when the discharge was , with an average of those years of . The water temperature range from 7°Celsius (44.5 °F) in February 2006 to a high of on Oct 4, 2014. This range is less extreme than the temperatures below Vernalis where the range is from 2°Celsius (35.6 °F)on Dec 26, 1987 to on August 9, 1990. The river typically ends above the Mendota Pool. Larger flows in the fall may make it possible for the river to extend further towards the ocean, but for the last several years, this is a rare occurrence. The water is largely held behind Friant Dam.

The typical monthly flow of the San Joaquin River near the Sack Dam is 0. There have been seepage concerns below this part of the river, so current flows are restricted below the Sack Dam.

The present annual flow of the San Joaquin River near Vernalis is about , or 4.5 million acre-feet (5.6 million m3) per year. According to USGS stream gauge #11303500 at Vernalis, above Suisun Bay and below the mouth of the Stanislaus River, the average discharge of the San Joaquin River between 1924 and 2011 was , or 3.3 million acre-feet (4.0 million m3) per year. The highest recorded annual mean was , 15.4 million acre-feet (19.0 million m3), in 1983, while the lowest was , , in 1977. The maximum peak flow occurred on December 9, 1950, at , and a low flow of was recorded on August 10, 1961.

==Geology==

In a geologic context, the San Joaquin River can be divided into two major segments. The upper above Friant Dam in the Sierra is characterized as a steep-gradient, rocky mountain stream. Over millions of years, the upper San Joaquin, as well as the upper reaches of most of its tributaries, have eroded enormous amounts of rock and sediment from the mountains. Most of the Sierras are underlain by granitic igneous and metamorphic rock dating back to the Mesozoic Era (250–66 MYA); in addition many of the San Joaquin&#x27;s tributaries flow across a foothills region of metamorphosed volcanic rock more famously known as the Mother Lode Gold Belt.

The lower part of the river, in sharp contrast, is a meandering stream flowing over Cenozoic alluvial deposits (66 MYA-present), which together comprise the flat floor of the Central Valley. The tremendous volume of sediments that underlie the lower San Joaquin River range from deep, with distance to bedrock generally increasing in a northerly direction. Prior to the uplift of the California Coast Ranges, more than of sediments were deposited at the foot of the Sierras by tidal activity, and the ancestral San Joaquin and its tributaries flowed west over this alluvial plain to the sea, dumping their own sediments onto the marine deposits. Compressional forces along the boundary of the North American and Pacific Plates between 2–4 MYA resulted in the uplift of the Coast Ranges, creating an enclosed basin today known as the Central Valley and resulted in the San Joaquin&#x27;s present path to the sea.

Because of its highly permeable nature, the San Joaquin River&#x27;s valley is underlain by one of the largest aquifers in the Western United States. The aquifer underlying the San Joaquin River and Tulare Basin is estimated to hold nearly of water, of which about half can be pumped economically or is clean enough for human use. The aquifer receives in excess of of inflow per year, mostly from precipitation and irrigation water seepage. Concentration of chloride and other minerals generally increases from east to west across the basin.

==History==

===Indigenous people===
Archaeological finds near the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley suggested that humans first arrived in the region as early as 12,000 but no later than 5,000 years ago. The two major ethnic groups were the Miwok people, who inhabited the northern end of the San Joaquin Valley and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region, and the Yokuts tribes, scattered around the more arid southern portion of the basin. During these pre-European times, the San Joaquin River flowed through rich grasslands and sprawling marshes, flooding every few years and transforming much of the valley into lakes. At the southern end of the valley lay the vast Tulare Lake, formerly the largest freshwater lake in the western United States, which connected with the San Joaquin through a series of marshes and sloughs. The rich vegetation and wildlife surrounding these bodies of water made the San Joaquin Valley a favored home as well as a stopping-off place for other nomadic peoples. The native people, mostly hunter-gatherers, lived off this land of abundance; during the 18th century, the population of the San Joaquin Valley was estimated at more than 69,000, representing one of the greatest concentrations of native people anywhere in North America.
Before European colonization, the Yokuts occupied the entire San Joaquin Valley, from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta south to the Tehachapi Mountains, including the adjacent foothills of the Sierra Nevada to the east and parts of the Coast Range to the west. In contrast, the Miwok occupied land deeper within the Sierra Nevada stretching north from the Merced River to the Mokelumne or the American, a tributary of the Sacramento, and west to the Delta region. Most of the Miwok people in the watershed were part of the appropriately named Sierra Miwok group.

The Yokuts were unique among California natives in that they were divided into true tribes. Each had a name, a language, and a territory.
Of the about 63 known Yokuts tribes, 33 lived along or around the San Joaquin River and its tributaries.
The staple food for San Joaquin Valley inhabitants was the acorn, which when ground, could be made into various foods such as cakes. Grinding the acorns was a simple process where they crushed the nuts using rocks in natural granite depressions. Many of the surviving examples of acorn milling areas can still be found in the foothills, especially around the Kaweah River area.

===Spanish and Mexican influence===
The first recorded non-indigenous person to see the San Joaquin River was Don Pedro Fages in 1772. Fages, accompanied by Father Juan Crespí, reached Mount Diablo near Suisun Bay on March 30 and there gazed upon the merging courses of the Sacramento, San Joaquin and Mokelumne Rivers. Another narrative does not mention Fages&#x27; name, but does say that Crespí was the one who reached Suisun Bay in 1772. During this visit, Crespí called the San Joaquin River &quot;El Rio de San Francisco&quot;, a name that was not used widely due to the river&#x27;s remoteness but persisted until the early 19th century.
In the autumn of 1772 Fages set out from Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa in pursuit of deserters from the Spanish army, and traveled east then north over the Tehachapi Mountains through Tejón Pass, which today carries Interstate 5 into the San Joaquin valley. After crossing the mountains, he came upon the shore of Buena Vista Lake at the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley, and gave the name &quot;Buena Vista&quot; (&quot;beautiful view&quot;) to the pass and a nearby Native American village. However, Fages did not venture farther north, and thus did not further explore the main stem of the San Joaquin River.

The San Joaquin River region remained largely unknown except for the fact of its existence until 1806, when Spanish explorer Gabriel Moraga led the first of several subsequent expeditions into the Central Valley, in order to find potential mission sites. Moraga started out from Mission San Juan Bautista, in present-day San Benito County, on September 21 of that year and traveled east into the San Joaquin Valley. The group skirted the western foothills of the Sierra and christened many place names that remain in use today. In 1807 and 1808, Moraga set out again to the San Joaquin Valley. It was during one of these expeditions that he gave the river its present name, after St. Joachim. He also gave names to many tributaries of the river, such as the Merced River (&quot;El Río de Nuestra Señora de Merced&quot;, &quot;River of our Lady of Mercy&quot;).

Relations between the Spanish and the Native Americans in the earlier expeditions to the valley were initially friendly, and the indigenous people began to grow accustomed to the Spanish that later came to the San Joaquin River region. As early as the 1807 Moraga expedition, it was reported that some natives were hostile and attempting to steal their horses. Indeed, when the natives began to rustle cattle and horses for food, the Spanish retaliated by burning camps and villages. Such conflict created enormous cultural loss, and violence continually escalated between the two sides, with no apparent end in sight.

California became part of Mexico in 1821. The new government secularized the Spanish missions and as a result the conversos in the missions were no longer protected by the missionaries from exploitation. The Mexican government began to tax the missions excessively. From 1820, El Camino Viejo, a route between Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay along the west side of the San Joaquin Valley, brought settlements from the United States into the valley. During Mexican rule, the mission lands in the San Joaquin Valley were subdivided to wealthy landowners (&quot;rancheros&quot;). The mission lands that were supposed to be given to the natives were also fraudulently taken over by American settlers. A famous leader of the natives was the Yokuts Estanislao, who led revolts against the Mexicans in the late 1820s until finally defeated in 1829 on the Stanislaus River, which bears his name today.

===Early American era===

The first American known to see the San Joaquin River was likely Jedediah Smith, a renowned mountain man, fur trapper and explorer. In 1826, Smith arrived in Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, California, when the region was under control of the Mexican government. As this was in violation of a law which prevented foreigners from entering California, and he could have been arrested for spying, he traveled north into the San Joaquin Valley, searching for populations of beaver. Smith noted the fertility and natural beauty of the area, and the apparent peace of the Native Americans living in the villages he passed. His expedition then turned east in an attempt to cross the Sierra Nevada. They tried to summit the range by way of both the Kings River and the American River (a tributary of the Sacramento), but it was early spring and the snow was too deep. They crossed the mountains along the Stanislaus River canyon, becoming the first recorded whites to cross the Sierra Nevada on foot. It is still disputed over whether Smith&#x27;s party discovered gold on the San Joaquin or one of its tributaries. Although some of his men confirmed it, Smith did not make any mention in his journal.
In the early 1830s, a few fur trappers from the Pacific Northwest exploring southwards into the San Joaquin Valley saw an epidemic of smallpox and malaria brought unintentionally by the Europeans that had swept down the San Joaquin River corridor during the summer of 1833, killing between 50 and 75 percent of the entire native population in the valley. The outbreak continued year after year with diminishing acuteness until about 50,000–60,000 indigenous people were dead. Explorer Kit Carson noted in 1839 that &quot;... cholera or some other fearful scourge broke out among them and raged with such fearful fatality that they were unable either to bury or burn their dead, and the air was filled with the stench of their decaying bodies.&quot;

During the time Mexico was in control of California, the San Joaquin River region was only sparsely populated, and used almost exclusively for cattle ranching. When California won independence from Mexico in 1846, becoming part of the United States the following month, a flood of American settlers descended upon the valley. Just a year before, Benjamin Davis Wilson &quot;drove a herd of cattle from his Riverside rancho through the San Joaquin Valley to Stockton and reported seeing not a single white man&quot;. After the Americans took over, emigrants began trickling in increased numbers, establishing the towns of Kingston City, Millerton, and Fresno City. The newcomers also included a group of Mormons led by Samuel Brannan who established a settlement at the confluence of the San Joaquin and the Stanislaus, called New Hope or San Joaquin City.

The real influx came in 1848, when a gold strike on the American set off the California Gold Rush. Within one year, the population of the San Joaquin Valley increased by more than 80,000. The city of Stockton, on the lower San Joaquin, quickly grew from a sleepy backwater to a thriving trading center, the stopping-off point for miners headed to the gold fields in the foothills of the Sierra. Rough ways such as the Millerton Road which later became the Stockton - Los Angeles Road quickly extended the length of the valley, some following old cattle routes and Native American trails, and were served by mule teams and covered wagons. Riverboat navigation quickly became an important transportation link on the San Joaquin River, and during the &quot;June Rise&quot;, as boat operators called the San Joaquin&#x27;s annual high water levels during snowmelt, large craft could make it as far upstream as Fresno. During the peak years of the gold rush, the river in the Stockton area was reportedly crowded with hundreds of abandoned oceangoing craft, whose crew had deserted for the gold fields. The multitude of idle ships was such a blockade that at several occasions they were burned just to clear a way for riverboat traffic.

===Irrigation era===
Although the gold rush attracted tens of thousands of newcomers to the San Joaquin River area, deposits of the precious mineral petered out within a few years, especially on the upper reaches of the San Joaquin and its tributaries which were only suitable for placer mining. Many of these people settled in the San Joaquin Valley, most in the existing towns such as Stockton, Fresno and Bakersfield but some establishing new settlements. These included San Joaquin City, near the confluence of the San Joaquin with the Stanislaus, probably the largest of these post-gold-rush boomtowns. Established in 1851, the town maintained considerable size until 1880, when trade competition from nearby Stockton caused it to diminish. Another notable but much smaller settlement was Las Juntas, near present-day Mendota. This was a haven for criminals and fugitives, and was frequented by the infamous bandits Joaquín Murrieta and Tiburcio Vásquez.

It was in the mid-1860s that the San Joaquin River and its surrounds underwent a substantial change: the introduction of irrigated agriculture. As early as 1863, small irrigation canals were built in the Centerville area, southeast of Fresno, but were destroyed in subsequent floods. The vulnerability of the small local infrastructure led to the establishment of irrigation districts, which were formed to construct and maintain canals in certain areas of the valley. One of the first was the Robla Canal Company in the Merced River area, which went into operation in March 1876, but was soon surpassed by the Farmers Canal Company. The district built a diversion dam on the Merced, sending its water into a pair of canals still in use today.

One of the most powerful early irrigation empires was the Kern County Land and Water Company, established in 1873 by land speculator James Ben Ali Haggin, which grew to supply over through their canal system. Haggin soon ran into conflicts with other landowners over riparian water rights, as the larger districts, including his, had more financial reserves and engineering expertise, and were the first to build dams and diversions on a large scale. This resulted in the drying out of streams and rivers before they reached downstream users and sparked conflict over how much water could be allotted to whom. In Haggin&#x27;s case, his company ran into problems with the Miller &amp; Lux Corporation, run by Henry Miller and Charles Lux, who owned more than throughout the San Joaquin Valley, Tulare Basin, and other regions of California. The court battle that resulted would change water laws and rights in the San Joaquin River valley, and ended up promoting large-scale agribusiness over small farmers.
Miller and Lux were not any newer to the San Joaquin Valley than had been Haggin, but were the driving influence on valley agribusiness until well into the early 20th century. The corporation had begun acquiring land in the valley in 1858, eventually holding sway over an enormous swath reaching from the Kern River in the south to the Chowchilla River in the north. Much of the land that Miller and Lux acquired was swamp and marsh, which was considered virtually worthless. However, with their huge capital, they could afford to drain thousands of acres of it, beginning an enormous environmental change that eventually resulted in the loss of over 95 percent of the wetlands adjoining the San Joaquin River and Tulare Basin.

Henry Miller exercised enormous political power in the state, and most San Joaquin Valley inhabitants either were avid supporters of him or despised him. When Miller died in 1916, his company owned in the San Joaquin Valley alone with hundreds of miles of well-developed, maintained irrigation canals. As said by Tom Mott, the son of Miller and Lux&#x27; irrigation superintendent, &quot;Miller realized you couldn&#x27;t do anything with the land unless you had the water to go with it. Perhaps more than any other person, Miller had more of a lasting impact on the San Joaquin River than any other individual.&quot;

By the early 20th century, so much water was being diverted off the San Joaquin River and its tributaries that the river was no longer suitable for navigational purposes. As a result, commercial navigation began a decline starting in the late 19th century and was completely gone by 1911. With over under irrigation along the river by 1900 – this figure has only grown hugely since then – the river and its tributaries became much narrower, siltier and shallower, with large consequences for the natural environment, for sustainability of water supplies in its valley, and also huge changes for water politics in the state. The San Joaquin and its tributaries seemed to give rise to just about every single possible argument over water, including such cases as &quot;When is a river not a river?&quot; referring to the difference between a slough and a marsh. It has been said that fights over the river have caused &quot;some of the most bitter and longest running lawsuits ever to clog the courts. Arguably, it is the most litigated river in America.&quot;

==Dams, diversions and engineering==

===Hydroelectric development in the early 1900s===

By the early 20th century, Californian cities as far south as Los Angeles were looking to new sources for electricity because of their rapidly growing populations and industries. Two visionaries, railroad baron Henry E. Huntington and engineer John S. Eastwood established a fledgling power company in 1902 today known as Southern California Edison, and acquired water rights to the upper San Joaquin River from the Miller and Lux Corporation. During that year, Huntington and Eastwood devised plans to utilize the water of the San Joaquin River and some of its headwaters tributaries in what would become one of the most extensive hydroelectric systems in the world, known as the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project.

Construction of the system&#x27;s facilities, which included Mammoth Pool and Redinger Dams on the San Joaquin and four additional reservoirs on its tributaries with a total storage capacity of , started in 1911. A total of eight dams and tunnels, the longest of which stretches , and nine powerhouses with a total installed capacity of 1,014 MW were built in stages spanning the 20th century, with the last powerhouse coming on line in 1987. The consistent use and reuse of the waters of the San Joaquin River, its South Fork, and the namesake of the project, Big Creek, over a vertical drop of , have over the years inspired a nickname, &quot;The Hardest Working Water in the World&quot;.

Early 1900s hydroelectric development in the upper San Joaquin River basin was not limited to Southern California Edison. In 1910, the San Joaquin Electric Company built a dam on Willow Creek, a tributary of the San Joaquin River, forming Bass Lake as part of the Crane Valley hydroelectric project. Water from Bass Lake was diverted to a powerhouse on the San Joaquin River beginning in 1917, and two more powerhouses were added in 1919, increasing the total generating capacity to about 28 MW. The Crane Valley project and San Joaquin Electric was purchased by San Joaquin Light and Power Company in 1909, which was in turn purchased by Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) in 1936. In 1920, Kerckhoff Dam was completed on the San Joaquin River about southwest of Big Creek as part of PG&amp;E&#x27;s Kerckhoff hydroelectric project. The dam initially operated with a capacity of 38 MW in the Kerckhoff No. 1 Powerhouse on Millerton Lake. In 1983, the 155 MW Kerckhoff No. 2 Powerhouse was added, bringing the total capacity to 193 MW.

===Stockton Ship Channel===

The San Joaquin was once navigable by steamboats as far upstream as Fresno, but agricultural diversions have greatly slowed and shallowed the river. In addition, this has caused the river to drop large amounts of silt that formerly washed out to sea in its bed, further reducing the depth. In the late 19th century, the city of Stockton, once an important seaport for the San Joaquin Valley, found itself increasingly landlocked because the San Joaquin River, its main connection to the sea, was rapidly silting up. The early 20th century saw proposals to maintain a minimum depth in the lower river by dredging, but these were interrupted by the onset of World War I. In 1925 the city put forth a $1.3 million bond for dredging the lower San Joaquin from its mouth to the Port of Stockton – a distance of by river.

In 1926, Stockton pooled its finances with the federal and state governments for a total of $8.2 million. Construction on the channel, which included widening and deepening the riverbed and cutting off meanders and oxbow lakes, began in earnest in 1928. These included major cuts at Hog Island, Venice Island and Mandeville Island, plus five smaller straightening projects. The navigation project shortened the river length by and deepened it to . Additional deepening work was carried out in 1968 and 1982. Today, the navigation channel, known as the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel, can handle fully loaded vessels of up to and up to long. However, the navigation works have unexpectedly led to low dissolved oxygen levels in the lower San Joaquin River, which has hurt fish populations. This is believed to be a result of the combination of the abrupt geometry change from the shallow river upstream of Stockton to the deep water channel, in addition to pollution from the harbor and city and poor tidal mixing.

===Federal and state projects===


====Central Valley Project====
As early as the 1870s, state and federal agencies were already looking at the Central Valley as an area in need of a large water transport project. In 1931 California&#x27;s Department of Water Resources came up with the State Water Plan, which entailed the construction of dams and canals to transport water from the Sacramento River to the rapidly dwindling San Joaquin. The project was still in its planning stages when the Great Depression hit the United States, and California was unable to raise the funds necessary for building the various facilities. As a result, the project was transferred to the federal government and switched hands several times between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) before finally being authorized in the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1937 as a USBR undertaking and part of the New Deal, a series of large-scale reforms and construction projects intended to provide jobs for the millions of unemployed during the Depression.

Construction of Friant Dam, the main dam on the San Joaquin River, began in 1937 and was completed in 1942. The dam serves for irrigation and flood control storage, but its main purpose is to divert water into the Madera Canal, which runs northwest along the San Joaquin Valley to the Chowchilla River, and the Friant-Kern Canal, which carries San Joaquin water all the way south into the Tulare Basin, terminating at the Kern River. Both are irrigation and municipal supply canals serving primarily agricultural interests. Water from the Friant Dam supplies almost of farmland in Fresno, Kern, Madera, and Tulare counties. The diversion of water off the San Joaquin at Friant Dam leaves little more than a trickle below the dam in most years, except for releases serving farms in the immediate area downstream of Friant.

A key point for irrigation water distribution on the San Joaquin, despite its small size, is Mendota Dam. Built in 1871 at the juncture of the San Joaquin River and Fresno Slough, it initially served to divert water into the Main Canal, an irrigation canal for the riverside bottomlands in the San Joaquin Valley. In 1951, Mendota became the terminus of the Delta-Mendota Canal, a USBR project which conveys up to for from the mouth of the Sacramento River to the usually dry San Joaquin at that point. Water from Mendota is distributed in two directions: released into the San Joaquin for downstream diversions at the Sack Dam, another small diversion dam; and into Fresno Slough during the dry season, when no water is flowing in from the Kings River. The latter sends water into the Tulare Basin through the natural channel of the slough, which in essence conveys water in either direction depending on the time of year – north into the San Joaquin during the rainy season, south into the Tulare during the dry months.

====Eastside Bypass====

Even with the presence of Friant and numerous other flood control dams, large floods still caused significant damage along the San Joaquin River all the way through the late 1950s. The passage of the Flood Control Act of 1944 included provisions for the construction of a levee system along part of the San Joaquin River, but valley farmers were not entirely satisfied. After years of lobbying, farmers convinced the state government to authorize a massive flood-control system of diversion channels and levees whose main component is the Eastside Bypass, so named because of its location east of and parallel to the San Joaquin. Groundbreaking of the huge project was in 1959 and construction was finished in 1966.
The bypass system starts with the Chowchilla Canal Bypass, which can divert up to off the San Joaquin, a few miles above Mendota. After intercepting the flow of the Fresno River, the system is known as the Eastside Bypass, which runs northwest, crossing numerous tributaries: Berenda and Ash Sloughs, the Chowchilla River, Owens Creek and Bear Creek. Near the terminus, the bypass channel has a capacity of roughly . The Eastside Bypass ends just upstream of the Merced River confluence, where the San Joaquin levee system is better designed. However, the levees on the bypass channel are generally more well-built than those on the San Joaquin mainstem and thus the channel of the San Joaquin runs dry in some places where the entire flow has been diverted to the bypass system.

====Proposed dams====
Although fairly large with a capacity of , Millerton Lake, the reservoir of Friant Dam, is small compared to other reservoirs in the San Joaquin basin, such as Don Pedro and Pine Flat. The Bureau of Reclamation in conjunction with the California Department of Water Resources has proposed the construction of a new dam on the San Joaquin, Temperance Flat Dam, a few miles upstream of Friant. The proposed $1.2-3.5 billion dam would stand high and create a reservoir of , well over twice the capacity of Millerton Lake. Proponents of the project cite numerous benefits: flood control, increased storage, hydroelectric potential, and capacity to provide a greater flow in the downstream river during the dry season. It would also give dam operators the advantage of being able to maintain the river to a lower temperature due to the reservoir&#x27;s great depth. The new reservoir would provide an estimated annual yield of . In November 2014 the dam received $171 million of state funding from Proposition 1A, though project backers had sought $1 billion in funding.

However, opponents assert that the upper San Joaquin River, which is already controlled by dozens of smaller reservoirs upstream of Millerton Lake, will not provide sufficient discharge to fill the reservoir except in very wet years. The new reservoir would flood of the San Joaquin River including whitewater runs, fishing areas and historic sites. It would also inundate two Big Creek Hydro powerhouses, causing a potential net loss of electricity generation. There would be significant evaporation losses from the reservoir, and the water required to fill it would put further pressure on already stressed water resources in the San Joaquin River basin.

==Ecology and environment==

Hundreds of years ago, the San Joaquin flowed freely through a grass and marsh-dominated region variously known as the &quot;California prairie&quot;, &quot;California annual grassland&quot;, or &quot;Central Valley grasslands&quot;. It is widely believed that the dominant grass species throughout the San Joaquin River valley and Tulare Basin, as well as the Sacramento Valley, the Sierra foothills and Coast Ranges, was &quot;Nassella pulchra&quot;, a type of bunchgrass more commonly known as purple needlegrass. Today, this vegetation community exists only in isolated pockets because of development of the valley for agriculture, and in much of the remnant open areas where it once thrived, now grows introduced flora such as annual rye and wild oat. The vegetation communities created by the introduced grasses are sometimes referred to as &quot;valley grassland&quot;, which is highly seasonal but is spread throughout the Central Valley from near Redding to south of Bakersfield. These grasses all thrive in the Mediterranean climate that dominates much of the San Joaquin Valley.

The San Joaquin River and its marshes and wetlands provide a critical resting and breeding stop for migratory birds along the Pacific Flyway. Once, the seasonal bird populations in the San Joaquin basin were immense, especially in the now-dry Tulare Lake region: &quot;It took something different, though, to capture the sound of the blue sky as it turned dark and deafening from the wings and cries of millions of native and migratory birds – Canada geese, mallards, swans, pelicans, cranes, teal, and curlews. How to mimic the sudden flight of flocks so immense they extinguished the sun? One of the first white men to camp along the lake could think of only one noise, the roar of a freight train, that compared with the takeoff of the birds.&quot; Historically, the grasslands and the fringes of the great marshes and lakes provided habitat for large grazing animals including pronghorn, mule deer and the endemic tule elk, as well as predators such as the San Joaquin kit fox; all of these species have seen dramatic population declines as their native habitat has fallen under the plow.

Human activities have replaced or altered over 95 percent of the historic wetlands as well as the California oak woodland habitat, which originally occurred along stream and river corridors in the foothills, and the tule grass that once thrived in huge stands on the edges of marshes and lakes. Some of the richest remaining marsh habitats are in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, which, despite significant agricultural and infrastructure development, has retained many of its original swamps and backwaters. Before the 19th century, the delta was a region of numerous islands of nutrient-rich peat, alluvial deposits, winding channels and waterways. Since then, most of the Delta islands have been cultivated, and consistent use of the land has resulted in subsidence, in some cases up to . Water diversions from the rivers feeding it have increased salinity, which has in turn caused declines in fish populations that once thrived in the region.

As defined by the World Wildlife Fund, the San Joaquin River watershed is part of the Sacramento-San Joaquin freshwater ecoregion, which supports almost 40 species of freshwater fish. These include several types of lampreys, sturgeons, sunfish, perch and various anadromous fish species such as salmon and steelhead. Some of these fish are believed to have descended from fishes of the Columbia Basin in geologically ancient times, when the upper reaches of the Sacramento River watershed were connected with that of the Snake River. Up to 75 percent of the historic species were endemic to the Sacramento-San Joaquin basin. Most native fish stocks have suffered because of predation by introduced species and dam construction. In a study from 1993 to 1995, it was found that the main stem of the San Joaquin River was mainly populated by fathead minnow, red shiner, threadfin shad and inland silverside, all of which were introduced. Downstream portions of the river&#x27;s main tributaries were populated mainly by largemouth and smallmouth bass, redear sunfish and white catfish, while native species have survived relatively well in the upper reaches of the river and its tributaries, which also play host to introduced brown trout.

===Pollution===
For its size, the San Joaquin River is one of the most polluted rivers in the United States, especially in its lower course. Years of pesticides and fertilizers being applied to the surrounding lands as well as municipal runoff have led to elevated levels of selenium, fluoride, nitrates and other substances in the river and its tributaries; pesticide pollution is now considered &quot;ubiquitous&quot; to the San Joaquin River system. The selenium is believed to originate from soils on the west side of the valley and in the Coast Ranges, which are rich with the element. Additionally, the San Joaquin is suffering chronic salinity problems due to high levels of minerals being washed off the land by irrigation practices. Abandoned mines contribute toxic acid mine drainage to some tributaries of the river. One of the worst environmental disasters was at Kesterson Reservoir, a disposal site for agricultural drain water which doubled as a wildlife refuge. Initially, animals and plants thrived in the artificial wetlands that were created here, but in 1983, it was found that birds had suffered severe deformities and deaths due to steadily increasing levels of chemicals and toxins. In the next few years, all the fish species died except for the mosquito fish, and algae blooms proliferated in the foul water. These have had not only an adverse impact on San Joaquin River ecology, but also cause pollution to the sources of most of the large aqueducts in the state – the California and Delta-Mendota Canals, for example.

===Salmon===
Before irrigation development, the San Joaquin River and its tributaries once supported the third largest run of Pacific salmon in California, including prodigious spring, summer, fall, and late-fall runs of chinook salmon. The California Department of Fish and Game estimated in the 1930s that the historic salmon run was likely in the vicinity of 200,000 to 500,000 spawners annually, but by the mid-20th century, reduction in river flows led to the run dropping to about 3,000-7,000. Some sources put the historic populations as high as three hundred thousand, but this is highly unlikely because of the limited habitat available in the watershed.
Construction of dams in the San Joaquin watershed has led to nearly all of the good spawning streams, located higher in the mountains near the headwaters of the San Joaquin and its tributaries, being cut off to the salmon. The remaining areas left for the salmon to spawn in are undesirable. Prior to the building of the Friant Dam in 1944, the San Joaquin River was believed to have over 6,000 miles of streambed suitable and available to spawning salmon. However, in 1993 it was estimated that there was just 300 miles.

This significant loss of suitable spawning habitat is due to lack of spawning-sized gravel recruitment from lateral and upstream sources due to the installation of manmade barriers that block this gravel from passing naturally downstream. Without recruitment, high flow releases scour gravel from spawning beds, so that they gradually become smaller and smaller. The smaller pieces of gravel are more easily picked up and moved downstream, leaving behind larger pieces that the salmon are unable to move to bury their eggs in a process called redd construction. This further crowds the salmon into smaller and smaller suitable spawning beds, which increases the likelihood of redd superimposition. This is when spawners construct their redds, or pockets in the gravel to lay their eggs in, on top of preexisting redds, thereby killing or burying some of the eggs in the pre-existing redds. The EPA has also stated that the remaining gravel is &quot;probably fairly highly embedded and therefore of reduced quality and unavailable to fish for spawning&quot;. The Temperature of the water can also affect the level of spawning. The best temperatures for spring and fall run Chinook salmon are between 42 °F and 57 °F. However, in 77% of the years studied by the San Joaquin River Restoration Program, water temperatures were elevated above 57 °F and abnormalities and egg morbidity rates increased.

The introduction of predatory fish species such as bluegill and various types of bass that prey on salmon smolt are also a major contributor to the decline. The San Joaquin&#x27;s point of divergence with the distributary Old River has historically created a sort of bottleneck for out migrating salmon because the Old River in turn branches into many side-channels and sloughs of the delta as well as various canal intakes. Recent years have seen work by the California Department of Water Resources and the California Department of Fish and Game to construct and manage temporary rock barriers at the head of the Old River in order to keep fish in the main channel of the San Joaquin River. In the fall of 2009, just 2,236 salmon returned to the entire river system to spawn; this has led to a government ban on salmon fishing off the coasts of northern California and Oregon. Recent years have seen efforts to bring back some of the salmon population to the San Joaquin and some of its tributaries; these include the establishment of fish hatcheries. , plans had been finalized for a $14.5 million hatchery near Friant Dam as part of a $20 million federal restoration project for the fish.

In late 2012, even though there are still dams in the way of allowing salmon to navigate the entire river, attempts were made to get salmon to lay eggs in the upper portion of the river near Friant Dam.

The closest example of a revived salmon population is the Butte River near Chico.

===Groundwater overdraft===

Because of the heavy demand of water for agriculture and the insufficient flow of the San Joaquin River, groundwater in the San Joaquin Valley&#x27;s rich aquifer has been an important source of irrigation supply since the late 19th century. Historically, surface water was able to provide all the needed supply, but as agricultural lands spread across more and more of the valley, groundwater pumping became increasingly common. Also, with the introduction of better technology that allowed farmers to dig deeper wells and install electrical pumps, groundwater was seen as an often cheaper and easily accessible source compared to the river. Water imported from Northern California through the Central Valley Project managed to stave off increasing rates of withdrawal for several years, until the 1977 California drought heavily decreased water supplies from these sources for a while and caused many farmers to return to groundwater pumping.
Groundwater withdrawal reached its peak during the 1960s with more than being drawn from the aquifer each year – over twice the present flow of the San Joaquin River – which accounted for 69.6% of all the groundwater pumped within the Central Valley, and nearly 14 percent of all the groundwater withdrawn in the United States. In a 1970 study, it was found that more than of the San Joaquin River valley had been affected by land subsidence in excess of . The maximum drop in elevation was near Mendota, the northward bend of the San Joaquin River, at over . In some areas, the water table has declined more than vertically, forcing farmers to sink their wells as deep as to hit more abundant pockets of the underground water.

Even after better practices and new sources of water through federal projects, groundwater pumping continues at a tremendous rate. The San Joaquin Valley aquifer lost about from 1961 to 2003, which despite being a dramatic reduction from the 1960s, still amounts to nearly per year. The subsidence caused by groundwater withdrawal has threatened infrastructure in the San Joaquin Valley, including the California Aqueduct, a State Water Project facility that conveys water from the delta region to coastal-central and southern California. Subsidence has also damaged highways and power lines as well as causing some areas to be more susceptible to flooding.

===Reconnecting to the ocean===

In 2009, the Bureau of Reclamation began to release water from Friant Dam in an effort to restore two once-dry stretches of the San Joaquin of about . These two reaches are from below the dam to Mendota Pool, and from the Sack Dam, a diversion dam approximately downstream, to the confluence with the Merced River. The flows were initially in that year. The increased flows will not only begin to restore large areas of desiccated riverside habitat below the dam, but will serve the primary purpose of restoring salmon runs in the upper San Joaquin watershed. The restoration flows, however, will cause a 12 to 15 percent reduction of water provided by the Friant Division of the CVP with complaints from irrigators in the valley as a result. There has also been a lawsuit regarding damage to farmland west of the San Joaquin, near the town of Los Baños, claiming that the flows are seeping through levees that have not seen use in years due to the drying out of the river channel.

In addition to the dry reaches, the higher discharge in the San Joaquin will help restore a total of of river, figuring in stretches with low or polluted flows. It is also hoped that the water will help dilute contaminants in the river caused by pesticides and fertilizers that are applied to the surrounding farmland. In turn, the boost in flow could assist restoration efforts and help flush out saline water in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, where water is pumped into state aqueducts which provide water supplies to two-thirds of Californians.

Phase One improvements include the following: The San Joaquin River east of Los Banos will be increased to route up to of water by December 2011. Salmon will be re-introduced to the river in 2012, most habitat conservation work on the San Joaquin River will be completed by the end of 2013. Phase One will include interim flows of up to . Capacity will be increased to handle up to from Friant Dam to the Mendota Dam by December 2013. A fish ladder will also be added to the Sack Dam.

Phase Two improvements include the following: The USBR will begin releasing up to , or &quot;full restoration flows&quot;, from the Friant Dam in 2014. Flows will depend on whether the year is wet, dry or for intermediate levels of precipitation. Additional rehabilitation work is projected to continue until 2016 to ensure that the river can transport of water through rainfall and releases from Friant Dam all the way to Bear Creek and the Eastside bypass. The higher capacity of the river is also to accommodate rainfall or prevent flooding.

The total cost of the restoration, one of the largest river recovery efforts in the United States, could be up to $800 million or even a billion dollars. Approximately $330 million will be paid by Central Valley farmers, and the state and federal governments will provide the remaining funding.

The San Joaquin River was last connected to the ocean in 2010. By reconnecting, it means the portion from Friant Dam to where the San Joaquin River joins the Merced river above Vernalis. This may happen in 2016 or 2017.

===Wetlands===
Efforts have been under way to restore wetlands along the San Joaquin River as well as on the historic shores of Tulare Lake. These primarily entail the cleanup of existing wetlands and procuring additional water supplies, rather than converting agricultural land back into the original swamp and marsh. Since wetlands can provide a natural form of flood control – wetlands act like sponges, absorbing flood flows during the rainy season and releasing the accumulated water during the dry season – and also can filter out many forms of toxins, especially from fertilizers, they are important to maintaining good water quality in the San Joaquin River. Wetlands preservation group Ducks Unlimited was awarded a $1 million grant in 2005 as part of the North American Wetlands Conservation Act in order to conduct restoration work on of swamps and marshes throughout the San Joaquin Valley.

==Watershed==
At , the San Joaquin River watershed proper drains a fair swath of inland central California, an area comparable to the size of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. If combined with the Tulare Basin, which historically (and still rarely) experiences northerly outflow to the San Joaquin River, it would be the largest single drainage basin entirely in the state. The San Joaquin River basin is roughly synonymous with the San Joaquin Valley, and is bounded by the Sierra Nevada to the east, the Coast Ranges on the west, and the Tehachapi Mountains on the south.

The San Joaquin Valley&#x27;s major southeast–northwest axis runs roughly parallel with the Pacific coast of California; it measures covering all or parts of seventeen California counties stretching from north of Lodi to well south of Bakersfield. Most of the elevation change in the San Joaquin occurs within the first above Friant Dam. Its highest headwaters are at over , but by the time the river reaches the foothills, it is a mere above sea level.
On the west and northwest, the San Joaquin watershed borders those of rivers draining into the Pacific, while beyond almost all of the other divides lie endorheic basins, mostly of the Great Basin. To the north, a low series of ridges separates the San Joaquin River basin from that of the Sacramento River. The Coast Ranges bound the watershed on the west and borders on the drainages of the Pajaro River, Salinas River and the endorheic Carrizo Plain. On the south, the Tehachapis wall off the Tulare Basin from the Mojave Desert. To the east, the Sierra Nevada separate the San Joaquin drainage from those of multiple smaller rivers that terminate in various Great Basin lakes. From north to south, these are the Carson, Walker, and Owens Rivers. The sloping alluvial fan of the Kings River divides the northern San Joaquin Valley from the Tulare Basin.

The overwhelming majority of the economic base in the San Joaquin River watershed is provided by agriculture. The valley is widely considered one of the most productive farming regions in the world, and the top four U.S. counties ranked by agricultural production are all located in the San Joaquin watershed and Tulare Basin. The crops grown in these four counties alone are valued at over $12.6 billion annually, while the production of the entire valley is estimated at more than $14.4 billion. The main crop in the valley by annual sales is cotton, but more than 200 types of produce are grown along the San Joaquin River and in the Tulare Basin, including rice, almonds and lettuce. Livestock raising is also a major business in the valley. This prodigious output has earned the basin many names, including the &quot;breadbasket&quot; or &quot;salad bowl&quot; of the United States.

, the San Joaquin River watershed had a human population of roughly 4,039,000, about 1.9 million of whom live within the section of the watershed not including the Tulare Basin. The largest cities are Bakersfield, near the south end of the valley on the Kern River; Fresno, roughly in the geographic center; Modesto, on the Tuolumne River; and Stockton, on the southeast fringe of the Delta region. Other major cities include Visalia, Tulare, Hanford, Porterville, Madera, Merced, Turlock, Manteca and Lodi. Population growth is among the highest in the state of California and more than twice the U.S. average. In Madera County, near the geographic middle of the basin, growth was 51.5% between 1990 and 2003, the highest in the San Joaquin basin. Most of the major cities lie on the State Route 99 corridor, which runs along the entirety of the San Joaquin Valley and forms the primary thoroughfare for the valley. Interstate 5 provides the major transportation route for the west side of the valley.

Land cover in the watershed is predominantly agriculture and forest, and large expanses of shrubland and semiarid foothill terrain also occupy portions of the basin in addition to a growing urban percentage. Irrigated land covers 30% of the watershed followed by forested areas in addition to national forest and park land that encompass 26.8% of the total land area. Built-up areas use a much smaller percentage of the watershed, at just 1.9%. In the San Joaquin&#x27;s direct drainage region (not including the Tulare Basin) agricultural cover was 19.2%, forests embraced 28.4%, and urban areas occupied 2.4% as of 1995. The basin&#x27;s main population centers are in the north and south and population density generally increases from west to east. In fact, despite the relatively small percentage of developed areas, more than 50% of the population lives in the watershed&#x27;s four largest cities: Fresno, Bakersfield, Stockton and Modesto.

===Tributaries===
Seven major tributaries flow directly into the San Joaquin River, all of which run from the Sierra Nevada westwards into the main stem. In addition, some of the discharge of the Kings River also enters the San Joaquin directly (but seasonally) through a distributary. Of these, the Tuolumne River is the largest in any respect: longest, greatest drainage basin, and highest discharge. The Merced River is the second largest by length and drainage basin, but the Mokelumne River has a greater flow. Tributaries are listed below proceeding from the mouth upstream, with their respective &quot;main-stem&quot; length, watershed and discharge noted. Rivers of the Tulare Basin are noted below the San Joaquin&#x27;s direct tributaries with their individual data. Most of the tributaries had much larger flows before irrigation diversions – for example, the Tuolumne&#x27;s historic discharge was almost 48% higher than it is now.

<text>James Philip Eagle (August 10, 1837December 20, 1904) was an American politician who served as Speaker of the Arkansas House of Representatives and as the 16th governor of Arkansas, a Baptist minister, and president of the Southern Baptist Convention. He was a Democrat.

== Early life and military service ==
Eagle was born in Maury County, Tennessee. His family moved to Arkansas early in his life and he was educated in the public schools. He married Mary Kavanaugh Oldham in 1882. Her brother William Kavanaugh Oldham moved to Arkansas in 1885 and later entered politics himself, serving as acting governor for a brief time in 1913. A younger brother, Kies Oldham, served as Eagle&#x27;s personal secretary during his time as governor.

Eagle was appointed deputy sheriff of Prairie County, Arkansas, in 1859, a position he held until the start of the American Civil War. Eagle enlisted in the Confederate States Army and rose to the rank of major. He served with the 5th Arkansas Infantry and the 2nd Arkansas Mounted Rifles. He campaigned with the Army of Tennessee and fought in most of that army&#x27;s campaigns from the initial battles in Kentucky all the way to the Battle of Nashville. Eagle was wounded during the Atlanta Campaign.

== Ministry and political career ==
At the conclusion of the war, Eagle attended Mississippi College for less than one year but was forced to withdraw due to illness. He studied for the ministry and was ordained as a Baptist preacher.

Eagle served as a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1873 to 1878. He supported Baxter during the Brooks–Baxter War. Eagle served as speaker of the house in 1875. Eagle was elected Governor of Arkansas in 1888, and was reelected for a second term in 1890. The Eagle administration concerned itself with attracting immigration and support for education.

He was sympathetic to women&#x27;s suffrage and once welcomed Susan B. Anthony to the state though he did not provide active political support. Eagle served on the state capitol commission but was fired by Governor Jeff Davis for allegedly campaigning for an opponent of Davis. Davis was opposed to the construction of the new capitol building.

==Later life and death==
In 1880, he became president of the Arkansas Baptist Convention until 1904. In 1902, he became president of the Southern Baptist Convention until 1904.

Eagle died at his home in Little Rock, Arkansas, of heart failure, on December 20, 1904. He is buried at the historic Mount Holly Cemetery in Little Rock.

<doc id="304856" wikidata="Q5050159" url="?curid=304856" title="Castle Infinity">
<text>Castle Infinity is a discontinued Massively multiplayer online game, the first intended for children. It was launched by Starwave Corporation in 1996, and features personalized avatars, an embedded message system and live chat in a 2D side scrolling game world. It survives as a freeware MMOG.

The game is full of interactions that force players to collaborate with each other in order to pass from one area to the next, by way of four-person vehicles and other game-like lobbying devices.

The a cappella group The Bobs provided several original songs for the soundtrack. Additionally, members of the band also lent their voices for most of the characters.

==History==
&quot;Castle Infinity&quot; was first released in 1996, making it the first fully released MMOG designed for children. It was originally designed by Russell Ginns, Gregg Foster, and Scott Wallin, with art direction and animation by Jonathan Maier and Andy Norman. It was developed and published by Paul Allen&#x27;s early internet company Starwave.

The initial launch included a joint promotion with Netcom, retail displays in Blockbuster Video, and coupons included in the packaging toward the purchase of a USRobotics modem.

Access to the game required a CD-Rom and also a subscription. This technology requirement, plus the nascent child online audience at the time, proved too limiting for wide distribution. At its peak, the service had approximately 4,000 registered players. Ownership passed to Disney when Starwave was acquired in 1997. Disney did not maintain development for the game, and access to the service became intermittent starting in 1998, and was shut down entirely by 2000.

===Revival===
In 2000, the game servers were rescued from a dumpster by Kevin Quitt, a programmer who happened to be one of the game&#x27;s players, and new development of the game began run by Castle Infinity, Inc. a non-profit organization. In 2005 there was fresh media coverage of the game by way of Slashdot and BoingBoing.

In 2011 a new server was launched with the help of former players, including Spencer Jerome, Donald Butyen and Rachel Coleman. At present, Castle Infinity, LLC, manages the effort.

==Story==
Castle Infinity takes place in a virtual world created by dinosaurs 65,000,000 years ago to escape from a comet approaching the earth. The virtual world has become infested with monsters but mammals have evolved to the point that they have invented the internet and can now access the Castle. Players are welcomed in by dinosaurs, who want mammals (kids) to help them save the Castle from the monsters.

==Gameplay==
Castle Infinity is a 2D side-scrolling world, where players collect &quot;grow caps&quot; and &quot;hats&quot; to unlock new play areas. The game places a heavy emphasis on player interaction, and much of the game&#x27;s map is constructed to encourage users to collaborate in order to proceed. Players complete challenges which require multiple players to participate together, such as piloting a submarine that requires four pilots to steer properly. There are many locations where, in order to access higher levels, at least 3 or 4 members are required to stand on the same spot for the lift to activate.

Much of the directing of players between single and multi-player environments was a solution to the challenges of latency. The game was launched when a majority of home users had 9600 or 14.4k Modems. By siphoning players into individual areas, they could experience side-scrolling action. Then, in 4-player or unlimited areas, the focus was on communication and exchanging items.

The game&#x27;s &quot;official language&quot; is Esperanto. Many signs and audio clips feature warnings and comments in a pidgin version of that language.

<text>Starwave was a Seattle, Washington-based software and website company, founded in 1993 by Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft and led by CEO Mike Slade. The company produced original CD-ROM titles, including &quot;Muppets Inside&quot;, and titles for Clint Eastwood, Sting, and Peter Gabriel. They were the original developers of &quot;Castle Infinity&quot;, the first massively multiplayer online role-playing game for children, but Starwave&#x27;s most lasting mark was in the area of web content sites. They developed ESPN.com, ABCNEWS.com, Outside Online, and Mr. Showbiz.com among other sites, setting the standard for much of the commercial Internet explosion of the late 1990s. Starwave also developed the first site and publishing system for Jim Cramer&#x27;s TheStreet.com.

== Disney ==
The company merged with Infoseek and was later sold to The Walt Disney Company. In April 1998, Disney purchased the outstanding shares of Starwave from Allen after an initial buy of about 30% in 1997. The new entity, Walt Disney Internet Group (WDIG) developed the Go.com portal.

In 2004, Disney re-activated the Starwave identity as Starwave Mobile, which published casual games for mobile phones. They published several &quot;Scarface&quot; licensed games including &quot;&quot; and games from Capybara Games including &quot;Critter Crunch&quot;.

<doc id="304861" wikidata="Q196450" url="?curid=304861" title="Amundsen (crater)">
<text>Amundsen is a large lunar impact crater located near the south pole of the Moon, named after the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. It lies along the southern lunar limb, and so is viewed from the side by an observer on the Earth. To the northwest is the crater Scott, a formation of similar dimensions that is named for another Antarctic explorer. Nobile is attached to the western rim.

The rim of Amundsen is slightly distended along the southern edge, and the inner surface is wider at that point than elsewhere along the outer wall. The crater overlaps a smaller crater formation to the northwest, and Hédervári is attached to the northern rim. Just to the south of Amundsen is the smaller crater Faustini.

The inner floor is relatively flat, with a pair of central peaks near the midpoint. Much of the crater floor is cloaked in shadow during the lunar day, with only the southern floor and the central peaks receiving sunlight.

Amundsen Crater hosts 82 square kilometers of carbon dioxide cold traps, where temperatures remain below , potentially containing solid carbon dioxide. Such areas could be high-priority target sites for future landed missions.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Amundsen.

The crater formerly named Amundsen A is now known as Hédervári.

<text>Movable Type is a weblog publishing system developed by the company Six Apart. It was publicly announced on September 3, 2001; version 1.0 was publicly released on October 8, 2001.
The current version is 8.0.

Movable Type is proprietary software. From June 2007 to July 2013, Six Apart ran the &quot;Movable Type Open Source Project&quot;, which offered a version of Movable Type under the GPL.

==Features==
Movable Type&#x27;s features include the ability to host multiple weblogs and standalone content pages, manage files, user roles, templates, tags, categories, and trackback links. The application supports static page generation (in which files for each page are updated whenever the content of the site is changed), dynamic page generation (in which pages are composited from the underlying data as the browser requests them), or a combination of the two techniques. Movable Type optionally supports Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for user and group management and automatic blog provisioning.

Movable Type is written in Perl, and supports storage of the weblog&#x27;s content and associated data within MySQL natively. PostgreSQL and SQLite support was available prior to version 5, and can still be used via plug-ins. Movable Type Enterprise also supports the Oracle database and Microsoft SQL Server.

==History==
Version 1.0 was released in October 2001. Movable Type 2.6 was released February 13, 2003.

The TrackBack feature was introduced in version 2.2, and has since been adopted by a number of other blog systems.

With the release of version 3.0 in 2004, there were marked changes in Movable Type&#x27;s licensing, most notably placing greater restrictions on its use without paying a licensing fee. This sparked criticism from some users of the software, with some moving to the then-new open-source blogging tool WordPress. With the release of Movable Type 3.2, the ability to create an unlimited number of weblogs at all licensing levels was restored. In Movable Type 3.3, the product once again became completely free for personal users.

Six Apart released a beta version of Movable Type 4 on June 5, 2007, and re-launched movabletype.org as a community site, for purposes of developing an open-source version that was released under the GNU General Public License on December 12, 2007. Movable Type 4&#x27;s Enterprise version provides advanced features such as LDAP management, and enterprise database integration such as Oracle, MySQL, user roles, blog cloning, and automated blog provisioning. It is also available as part of Intel&#x27;s SuiteTwo professional software offering of Web 2.0 tools.

Movable Type 5 was released in Open Source and Pro versions in January 2010, with several bug-fix and security updates appearing later in the year. Movable Type Enterprise remains based on Movable Type 4.

Movable Type 6 was released in 2013; this release included the termination (once again) of the Open Source licensing option. Movable Type is now available in &quot;Professional&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; closed versions.

Melody was a fork of the open-source Movable Type distribution, announced in June 2009. Its development was being guided by a non-profit group consisting of current and former Six Apart employees, as well as other consultants and volunteers, but development appeared to cease in the middle of 2011.

At various times, Six Apart also maintained three other weblog publishing systems—TypePad, Vox, and LiveJournal. While Movable Type is a system which needs to be installed on a user&#x27;s own web server, TypePad, Vox, and LiveJournal were all hosted weblog services. LiveJournal, purchased in 2005, was sold in 2007. Shortly before being acquired by web advertising firm VideoEgg to form SAY Media in September 2010, Six Apart announced that it would be shutting down the Vox service at the end of that month, leaving TypePad and Movable Type as the company&#x27;s only blogging platforms. In January 2011, SAY Media announced that Infocom, a Japanese IT company, had acquired Six Apart Japan and that as part of the transaction, Infocom would assume responsibility for Movable Type.

Usage is generally charged by the minute or part of hour. An Internet café will generally also offer refreshments or other services such as phone repair. Internet cafés are often hosted within a shop or other establishment. They are located worldwide, and many people use them when traveling to access webmail and instant messaging services to keep in touch with family and friends. Apart from travelers, in many developing countries Internet cafés are the primary form of Internet access for citizens as a shared-access model is more affordable than personal ownership of equipment and/or software. Internet cafés are a natural evolution of the traditional café. As Internet access rose many pubs, bars, and cafés added terminals and eventually Wi-Fi hotspots, eroding the distinction between the Internet café and normal cafés. In recent years, traditional internet cafés have experienced a significant decline in developed countries due to the widespread availability of personal internet access devices. Conversely, in regions like Southeast Asia, internet cafés have evolved into esports cafés, serving as community hubs for gamers and training grounds for professional players.

==Pre-internet online cafés==


The early history of public access to online networking sites is largely unwritten and undocumented. Many experiments can lay claim to being precursors to internet cafés.

In March 1988, the &#x27;Electronic Café&#x27; was opened near Hongik University in Seoul, South Korea by Ahn Sang-soo (Professor of Hongik University) and Gum Nu-ri (Professor of Kookmin University). Two 16bit computers connected to Online service networks through telephone lines. Offline meetings were held in the café, which served as a place that connected online and offline activities.

In July 1991, the SFnet Coffeehouse Network was opened in San Francisco, United States by Wayne Gregori. Gregori installed coin-operated computer terminals in coffeehouses throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. The terminals dialed into a 32 line Bulletin Board System that offered an array of electronic services including FIDOnet mail and, in 1992, Internet mail.

==Internet cafés==
The concept of a café with full Internet access (and the name &quot;Cybercafé&quot;) was invented in early 1994 by Ivan Pope. Commissioned to develop an Internet event for an arts weekend at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London, and inspired by the SFnet terminal based cafés, Pope wrote a proposal outlining the concept of a café with Internet access. For the event Seduced and Abandoned: The Body in the Virtual World. Over the weekend of March 12–13 in the theatre at the ICA, Pope ran a Cybercafé which consisted of multiple Apple Mac computers on café style tables with menus of available services.

In June 1994, The Binary Café, Canada&#x27;s first Internet café, opened in Toronto, Ontario, according to &quot;Security and Software for Cybercafés&quot;.

Inspired partly by the ICA event and associated with an Internet provider startup, EasyNet, in the same building, a commercial Internet café called Cyberia opened on September 1, 1994, in London, England. &quot;ArtsEmerson&quot; credits it as London&#x27;s first cybercafé, although it also claims it opened before The Binary Café.

The first public, commercial American Internet café was conceived and opened by Jeff Anderson and Alan Weinkrantz in August 1994, at Infomart in Dallas, Texas, and was called The High Tech Cafe.

A bar called &quot;CompuCafé&quot; was established in Helsinki, Finland in September 1993 and relocated to larger premises in October 1994 featuring both Internet access and a robotic beer seller.

In January 1995, the CB1 Café in Cambridge installed an Internet connection. It was the longest running Internet Café in the UK, ultimately closing down in 2015.

The Scottish Bar in French-speaking Switzerland was started on June 27, 1995 by Pierre Hemmer.

In June 1995, three Internet cafés opened in the East Village neighborhood of New York City: Internet Cafe, opened by Arthur Perley, the @Cafe, and the Heroic Sandwich. In 1996, the Internet café Surf City opened in downtown Anchorage, Alaska.

Since early 2010s, the rising popularity of smartphones, due to improved hardware and faster internet connectivity (LTE and 5G NR), started having a major economic impact on internet cafés. It has been estimated that the number of internet cafés in South Korea dropped 17% from 19,000 in 2010 to 15,800 in 2012, and internet cafés in developing countries were struggling to grow.

In China, a 2011 government report stated that 130,000 internet cafés had closed down over the previous six years, due to tightening regulations, which brought the number down to 144,000. One industry consultant estimated the number had reached 136,000 in 2012.

In some locations, however, internet cafés continued to be used for reasons ranging from evading gambling regulations to building communities of language learners. As of 2021, internet cafés are still operating in South Korea for online gaming.

==Characteristics==

While most Internet cafés are private businesses many have been set up to help bridge the &#x27;digital divide&#x27;, providing computer access and training to those without home access. There are also Internet kiosks, Internet access points in public places like public libraries, airport halls, sometimes just for brief use while standing.

Many hotels, resorts, and cruise ships offer Internet access for the convenience of their guests; this can take various forms, such as in-room wireless access, or a web browser that uses the in-room television set for its display (usually in this case the hotel provides a wireless keyboard on the assumption that the guest will use it from the bed), or computer(s) that guests can use, either in the lobby or in a business center. As with telephone service, in the US most mid-price hotels offer Internet access from a computer in the lobby to registered guests without charging an additional fee, while fancier hotels are more likely to charge for the use of a computer in their &quot;business center.&quot;

For those traveling by road in North America, many truck stops have Internet kiosks, for which a typical charge is around 20 cents per minute.

Internet cafés come in a wide range of styles, reflecting their location, main clientele, and sometimes, the social agenda of the proprietors. In the early days they were important in projecting the image of the Internet as a &#x27;cool&#x27; phenomenon.

A variation on the Internet café business model is the LAN gaming center, used for multiplayer gaming. These cafés have several computer stations connected to a LAN. The connected computers are custom-assembled for gameplay, supporting popular multiplayer games. This is reducing the need for video arcades and arcade games, many of which are being closed down or merged into Internet cafés. The use of Internet cafés for multiplayer gaming is particularly popular in certain areas of Asia like India, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and the Philippines. In some countries, since practically all LAN gaming centers also offer Internet access, the terms net café and LAN gaming center have become interchangeable. Again, this shared-access model is more affordable than personal ownership of equipment and/or software, especially since games often require high end and expensive PCs.

Gaming is extremely popular at internet cafés in Asia, which has helped create strong demand and a sustainable business model for most cafés. However, with this growing popularity also comes more responsibility. To compete for market share, internet cafés have started charging less and have turned to alternate ways to maximize revenue. This includes selling food, drinks, game cards, and phone cards to patrons.

==Legal issues==
In 2003 the EasyInternetcafé chain was found liable for copyright infringement occurring when customers used its CD-burning service to burn illegally downloaded music to their own CDs.

In 2005 Italy began requiring entities such as Internet cafés to collect photocopies of the passports of Internet, phone, or fax-using customers as a result of anti-terrorism legislation passed in July of that year.

By 2010, a variation of the Internet café known as a &quot;sweepstakes parlor&quot; had become widespread in certain regions of the United States. These facilities offered entries in a contest to customers who purchase Internet usage. Sweepstakes parlors faced scrutiny by local governments, who argued that sweepstakes parlors are a form of illegal gambling. A large number of these locations faced raids by officials, while a number of states enacted laws to ban them.

There are European countries where the total number of publicly accessible terminals is also decreasing. An example of such a country is Germany. The cause of this development is a combination of complicated regulation, relatively high Internet penetration rates, the widespread use of notebooks, tablets, and smartphones and the relatively high number of wireless internet hotspots. Many pubs, bars and cafés in Germany offer wireless Internet, but no terminals since the Internet café regulations do not apply if no terminal is offered. Additionally, the use of Internet cafés for multiplayer gaming is very difficult in Germany since the Internet café regulations and a second type of regulations which was originally established for video arcade centres applies to this kind of Internet cafés. It is, for example, forbidden for people under the age of 18 to enter such an Internet café, although particularly people under 18 are an important group of customers for this type of Internet café.

==By country==

=== Australia ===
Netcafe opened in St Kilda at the Deluxe Café on April 4, 1995, inspired by the Internet café phenomenon that was going on in Seattle. As Australia&#x27;s first Internet café, founders included Gavin Murray, Rita Arrigo and Christopher Beaumont. Direct from London&#x27;s Cyberia they were joined by Kathryn Phelps and partnerships with Adam Goudie of Standard Computers for hardware and Michael Bethune from Australia Online, Australia&#x27;s first ISP for of course their Internet access. In 1995 it was delivered via a standard analogue phone line using a 9600-Baud US Robotics Modem. Cafe.on.net also opened on Rundle Street in Adelaide in 1995, with the support of Internode&#x27;s Simon Hackett. The Cafe was founded by John Ruciak, and was notable because of its Fast Ethernet connection.

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, the initial concept introduced by Monkey Paulista was based on the business model used by internet cafés in South Korea, since this was the first house LAN to exist in Brazil; it was inaugurated in São Paulo, starting its activities in 1995. The company closed in 2010. However, just a week later for reasons of bureaucracy, the company Lan Game @ The House was opened, and today is the most active LAN house of Brazil. Today it is seen in the country as a way to test new technologies and demonstrate games and other products.

=== China ===

According to the &quot;Survey of China Internet Café Industry&quot; by the People&#x27;s Republic of China Ministry of Culture in 2005, Mainland China had 110,000 Internet cafés, with more than 1,000,000 employees contributing 18,500,000,000 yuan to mainland China&#x27;s GDP. More than 70% of Internet café visitors are from 18 to 30 years old. 90% are male, 65% are unmarried, and 54% hold a university degree. More than 70% of visitors play computer games. 20% of China&#x27;s Internet users go to Internet cafés.

===India===
In India, Internet cafés used by traveling people and business are declining since the arrival of widespread mobile Internet usage. A set of other services are also offered, such as printing of documents or webpages. Operators also help computer illiterates through some government processes (as a part of e-governance in India ). Low speed of mobile Internet and these services offered by Internet cafés help its survival. In India a positive government ID is compulsory for Internet café users in most states.

In 2008, there were 180,000 cyber cafes in India but by 2017, it declined to 50,000, one of primary reasons for decline was rules of IT Act, which caused licensing issues and other restrictions.

=== Indonesia ===

According to APWKomitel (Association of Community Internet Center), there were 5,000 Internet cafés in urban Indonesian cities in 2006 providing computer/printer/scanner rentals, training, PC gaming and Internet access/rental to people without computer or internet access. The website also contains a directory listing some of these warnet/telecenter/gamecenter in Indonesia. In urban areas, the generic name is warnet (or &quot;warung Internet&quot;) and in rural areas the generic name is telecenter. Warnets/netcafes are usually privately owned as bottom-up initiatives, while telecenters in rural villages are typically government or donor-funded as top-down financing. Information on netcafe/warnet in Indonesia can also be found in a book titled: &quot;Connected for Development: Indonesian Case study&quot;.

Currently, no special license is required to operate an Internet café or warnet in Indonesia, except for the ordinary business license applicable to cafes or small shops. Because of hype and poor business planning, many net cafes have closed down. Although the number of Internet cafes are growing, associations such as APWKomitel urge new Internet café owners to do a feasibility study before planning to open an Internet café, and provide a business model called multipurpose community Internet center or &quot;MCI Center&quot; to make the business more sustainable and competitive. Hourly usage rate varies between Rp 2500–15000 ($0,27 – 1,60)

===Japan===
Japan has a strong internet café culture, with most serving a dual purpose as joint Internet-manga cafes. Most chains (like Media Cafe Popeye and Jiyū Kūkan) offer customers a variety of seating options, including normal chair, massage chair, couch, and flat mat. Customers are then typically given unlimited access to soft drinks, manga, magazines, Internet, online video games, and online pornography. Most offer food and shower services for an additional fee. In fact, many purchase &quot;night packs&quot; and shower/sleep in the cafes, giving rise to a phenomenon known as &quot;net cafe refugees&quot; or &quot;net cafe homeless&quot;.

===Kenya===

Internet cafés are prevalent in the city of Mombasa, as poverty and unreliable infrastructure do not make a personal internet connection a viable option for many citizens. The cafés are often combined with a variety of other businesses, such as chemists, manicurists, repair shops, and convenience stores. Video gaming has become particularly profitable in internet cafés in Kenya in recent years.

===Philippines===

In the Philippines, internet cafés, also known as computer shops (often abbreviated to comshop), are found on almost every street in major cities; and there is at least one in most municipalities or towns. There are also internet cafés in coffee shops and malls. High-end restaurants and fast food chains also provide free broadband to diners. Occasionally some internet cafés offer gadget repairs, print or photocopying, and other services. Rates range from P10 (US$0.20) per hour or less, depending on PC specifications) on streets, and up to P100 ($2) per hour in malls.
In some major cities with existing ordinances regulating internet cafés (e.g. Valenzuela, Marikina, Davao, Lapu-lapu and Zamboanga), students who are below 18 years of age are prohibited from playing computer games during regular class hours. Depending on the city, regulations vary in their exact details and implementation. Such city ordinances usually also require internet café owners to:
* Install filtering software to block adult oriented sites
* Prohibit the sales of alcoholic drinks and cigarettes inside their establishment
* Allow open view of rented computers (i.e. no closed cubicles)
* Provide a 50% transparent front wall panel, to allow a clear view of the interior of the establishment
* Provide adequate lighting both inside and outside of the establishment to allow a clear view of the interior at all times
* Sometimes install a CCTV for increased security
* loitering and being in the state of undress is not allowed at all times
* In some occasions, brawling and trashtalking is strictly prohibited when it comes to online game matches

===Poland===

The first Internet café in Poland was opened in 1996. Such establishments soon became very popular among the Polish population, especially young people, who at the time still rarely had access to computers with high-speed Internet at home. They were commonly used to play games like Icy Tower or Counter-Strike, as well as for instant messaging on the Gadu-Gadu client. Internet cafés began losing popularity after Telekomunikacja Polska launched the ADSL &quot;Neostrada&quot; service in 2001, providing home Internet access to many Poles, and most establishments were shut down by the 2010s.

=== Slovakia ===
In Slovakia, the first Internet café was opened officially in the city of Košice on July 17, 1996, providing services such as e-mail, Gopher, News, Telnet, WWW, Talk and others to the general public.

===South Korea===

In South Korea, Internet cafés are called PC bangs. They are ubiquitous in South Korean cities, numbering over 20,000. PC bangs mostly cater to online game playing for the younger generation. On average and mode, use of a PC bang computer is priced at around 1,000 won per hour (about $0.88 USD).

===Spain===
In Spain, the first Internet café was opened officially in the city of Oviedo, the capital city of the Principality of Asturias, on December 19, 1995.

===Taiwan===
Internet cafés are omnipresent in Taiwan, and especially concentrated in major cities, namely Taipei and Kaohsiung.

The Internet café is called a &quot;網咖&quot; (&quot;Wǎng kā&quot;) in traditional Chinese. The first character literally means &quot;net&quot; and the second character is the first syllable of &quot;café.&quot;The rate is consistent at about NT$10~20 in the most part, but prominent districts, such as the Eastern District of Taipei, can charge users up to NT$35 per hour. With the growth of smartphone ownership and free Wi-Fi networks in all major public attractions, the Internet cafés now primarily cater to gamers, and some even provide food and drinks.

===Vietnam===
In Vietnam, almost every internet café advertises itself as a game center. Many internet cafés charge a fairly low fee, usually the equivalent of $0.20 – $0.75 an hour. Services such as food and drink are also often available.
&quot;Internet café&quot; in Vietnamese is &quot;quán net&quot; or &quot;tiệm net&quot; (&quot;quán&quot; or &quot;tiệm&quot; means &quot;store&quot; and &quot;net&quot; is &quot;Internet&quot;).

===United States===
Reputedly, the first kosher cybercafe was the IDT Cafe in New York City&#x27;s diamond district, opened in the spring of 1997.

Internet cafés were prevalent in the 1990s but began to decline in popularity due to the expansion of home-based email and broadband internet access points, as well as the later deployment of Wi-Fi and smartphones. As of 2022, LAN gaming centers can be found in metropolitan areas in the United States. Gaming centers are not as popular in the U.S. compared to East Asia. Like those in Asia, gaming centers typically offer Internet access, food, and drinks.

==In popular culture==
Films such as &quot;The Beach&quot; and &quot;The Proposal&quot; feature an Internet café as a primary setting for significant plot development.

In Marvel Studios&#x27; &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;, the main character enters an internet café where she looks up clues to her past.

<text>Refugees International (RI) is an independent humanitarian organization that advocates for lifesaving assistance, human rights, and protection for displaced people and promotes solutions to displacement crises. It does not accept United Nations or government funding.

==History==
Refugees International was founded by Sue Morton in 1979 as a citizens&#x27; movement to protect Indochinese refugees. Morton resided in Tokyo and Singapore in the first year of Refugees International. In Washington, D.C., the founding Director of Refugees International was Dianne L. Lawson, who incorporated Refugees International in the U.S. (Washington, D.C.), and oversaw of the first public actions taken by Refugees International, a full-page ad in the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, July 19, 1979, in which Refugees International requested that the Executive and Legislative Branches of the U.S. Government act to rescue Vietnamese and Cambodians (Kampucheans) at sea. On the date the ad appeared in the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, Morton and Lawson were part of a march, led by then Senator Paul Simon (D-IL) and the singer Joan Baez, from the Lincoln Memorial to the north side of the White House. At the end of that march, the crowd sang &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; and, to the crowd&#x27;s surprise, President Jimmy Carter strode out from the doors of the White House and announced that he had just ordered the U.S. 7th Fleet to pick up all refugees on boats who were fleeing from Southeast Asia.

Refugees International, powered by only volunteers at its beginning, hired paid staff and expanded its scope beyond Southeast Asia in 1990, advocating for protection for Liberian refugees in Guinea and Kuwaitis in the Iraq-Jordan desert. It now conducts field missions to identify displaced people&#x27;s needs for basic services such as food, water, health care, housing, access to education and protection from harm. Based on their findings during humanitarian emergencies, the organization appeals to policy makers and aid agencies and promotes the strategic benefits of United States foreign aid. The organization is currently focused on displacement crises in and around Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Myanmar, Somalia, South Sudan, and Syria.

==Independence==
Refugees International does not accept government or UN funding, allowing their advocates to be independent. RI leverages donations from individuals, foundations, and corporations.

<text>Blogger is an American online content management system founded in 1999 that enables its users to write blogs with time-stamped entries. Pyra Labs developed it before being acquired by Google in 2003. Google hosts the blogs, which can be accessed through a subdomain of blogspot.com. Blogs can also be accessed from a user-owned custom domain (such as www.example.com) by using DNS facilities to direct a domain to Google&#x27;s servers. A user can have up to 100 blogs or websites per account.

Blogger enabled users to publish blogs and websites to their own web hosting server via FTP until May 1, 2010. All such blogs and websites had to be redirected to a blogspot.com subdomain or point their own domain to Google&#x27;s servers via DNS.

==History==
Pyra Labs launched Blogger on August 23, 1999. It is credited with popularizing the format as one of the first dedicated blog-publishing tools. Pyra Labs was purchased by Google in February 2003 for an undisclosed amount. Premium features, which Pyra had actually offered for a fee, were made free as a result of the takeover. Evan Williams, a co-founder of Pyra Labs, left Google in October 2004. Picasa was acquired by Google in 2004, and Picasa and its photo-sharing service Hello were incorporated into Blogger, enabling users to upload images to their blogs.

Blogger underwent a major redesign on May 9, 2004, which included web standards-compliant templates, individual archive pages for posts, comments, and email posting. Blogger&#x27;s new version, codenamed &quot;Invader,&quot; was released in beta alongside the gold update on August 14, 2006. Users were moved to Google servers, and new features such as interface language in French, Italian, German, and Spanish were added. In December 2006, this new version of Blogger was taken out of beta. By May 2007, Blogger had completely moved over to Google-operated servers. Blogger was ranked 16 on the list of top 50 domains in terms of number of unique visitors in 2007.

On February 24, 2015, Blogger announced that as of late March it would no longer allow its users to post sexually explicit content, unless the nudity offers &quot;substantial public benefit,&quot; for example in &quot;artistic, educational, documentary, or scientific contexts.&quot; On February 28, 2015, accounting for severe backlash from long-term bloggers, Blogger reversed its decision on banning sexual content, going back to the previous policy that allowed explicit images and videos if the blog was marked as &quot;adult&quot;.

===Redesign===
As part of the Blogger redesign in 2006, all blogs associated with a user&#x27;s Google Account were migrated to Google servers. Blogger claims that the service is now more reliable because of the quality of the servers.

Along with the migration to Google servers, several new features were introduced, including label organization, a drag-and-drop template editing interface, reading permissions (to create private blogs) and new Web feed options. Furthermore, blogs are updated dynamically, as opposed to rewriting HTML files.

In a version of the service called Blogger in Draft, new features are tested before being released to all users. New features are discussed in the service&#x27;s official blog.
In September 2009, Google introduced new features into Blogger as part of its tenth-anniversary celebration. The features included a new interface for post editing, improved image handling, Raw HTML Conversion, and other Google Docs-based implementations, including:

* Adding location to posts via geotagging.
* Post time-stamping at publication, not at original creation.
* Vertical re-sizing of the post editor. The size is saved in a per-user, per-blog preference.
* Link editing in compose mode.
* Full Safari 3 support and fidelity on both Windows and macOS.
* New Preview dialog that shows posts in a width and font size approximating what is seen in the published view.
* Placeholder image for tags so that embeds are movable in compose mode.
* New toolbar with Google aesthetics, faster loading time, and &quot;undo&quot; and &quot;redo&quot; buttons, also added the full justification button, a strike-through button, and an expanded color palette.

In 2010, Blogger introduced new templates and redesigned its website. The new post editor was criticized for being less reliable than its predecessor.

In March 2017, Blogger released new designs like Soho, Contempo, Emporio, Notable, and call them as Theme, not templates.

In 2020, Google Blogger slowly introduced an improved web experience for Blogger. They moved everyone to the new interface starting in late June, many Blogger creators see the new interface become their default. Blogger is now responsive on the web, making it easier to use on mobile devices in addition to having a new look.

===Available languages===
As of late 2016, Blogger is available in these 60 languages: Afrikaans, Amharic, Arabic, Basque, Bengali, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (Hong Kong), Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (United Kingdom), English (United States), Estonian, Filipino, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malay, Malayalam, Marathi, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish (Latin America), Spanish (Spain), Swahili, Swedish, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Vietnamese, and Zulu.

===Country-specific Blogger addresses===
In February 2013, Blogger began integrating user blogs with multiple country-specific URLs. For example, exampleuserblogname.blogspot.com would be automatically redirected to exampleuserblogname.blogspot.ca in Canada, exampleuserblogname.blogspot.co.uk in the United Kingdom. Blogger explained that by doing this they could manage the blog content more locally so if there was any objectionable material that violated a particular country&#x27;s laws they could remove and block access to that blog for that country through the assigned ccTLD while retaining access through other ccTLD addresses and the default Blogspot.com URL. If a blog using a country-specific URL was removed it is still technically possible to access the blog through Google&#x27;s No Country Redirect override by entering the URL using the regular Blogspot.com address and adding /ncr after .com. In May 2018, Blogger stopped redirecting to ccTLDs and country-specific URLs would now redirect to the default Blogspot.com addresses.

==Available designs==
Blogger allows its users to choose from multiple templates and then customize them. Users may also choose to create their own templates using CSS. The new design template, known as &quot;Dynamic View&quot;, was introduced on August 31, 2011 with Dynamic Views being introduced on September 27, 2011. It is built with AJAX, HTML5, and CSS3. The time for loading is 40 percent shorter than traditional templates, and allows user to present blog in seven different ways: classic, flipcard, magazine, mosaic, sidebar, snapshot, and timeslide. Readers still have the option to choose preferable views when the blog owner has set a default view.

==Integration==
* AdSense comes optional for each blog, assuming that the parent account is in good standing.
* &quot;Blogger for Word&quot; is an add-in for Microsoft Word that allows users to save a Microsoft Word document directly to a Blogger blog, as well as edit their posts both on- and offline. , Google says &quot;Blogger for Word is not currently compatible with the new version of Blogger&quot;, and they state no decision has been made about supporting it with the new Blogger. However, Microsoft Office 2007 adds native support for a variety of blogging systems, including Blogger.
* Blogger also started integration with Amazon Associates in December 2009, as a service to generate revenue. It was not publicly announced, but by September 2011 it appeared that all integration options had been removed and that the partnership had ended.
* Open Live Writer (formerly Windows Live Writer, originally part of the Windows Live suite) can publish directly to Blogger.

==Blocking==

Blogger has been blocked for various periods of time in the following countries:
* Cuba
* Fiji
* India (some ISPs in 2012 blocking an IP address put into Federal List of Extremist Materials in 2011)
* Iran
* Kazakhstan
* Kyrgyzstan
* Pakistan
* People&#x27;s Republic of China
* Russian Federation (some ISPs in 2012 blocking an IP address put into Federal List of Extremist Materials in 2011)
* Syrian Arab Republic
* Turkey
* Vietnam

Blocking of *.blogspot.com domains by keyword-based Internet filtering systems is also encountered due to the domain containing the substring &quot;gspot&quot;; however, this can be alleviated by excluding the &quot;blogspot.com&quot; section of the URL from the keyword-based Internet filtering whilst the *. section of the URL is exposed to keyword-based Internet filtering.

==Support==
The official support channel is the Blogger Product Forum. This online discussion forum, delivered using Google Groups, serves Blogger users of varying experience, and receives some monitoring from Google staff. &quot;Product Experts,&quot; formerly known as &quot;Top contributors,&quot; are community-members nominated by the Google staff who enjoy additional privileges including managing discussions and direct access to Google staff. There is likely to be a top contributor or other knowledgeable person reading the forum almost all the time.

A number of people, including some top contributors, run personal blogs where they offer advice and post information about common problems.

Stack Exchange&#x27;s Web Applications forum has a tag for &quot;blogger&quot;, which is used for questions about various blogging platforms, including Blogger.

<text>A grenade launcher is a weapon that fires a specially designed, large-caliber projectile, often with an explosive, smoke, or gas warhead. Today, the term generally refers to a class of dedicated firearms firing unitary grenade cartridges. The most common type are man-portable, shoulder-fired weapons issued to individuals, although larger crew-served launchers are issued at higher levels of organization by military forces.

Grenade launchers are produced in the form of standalone weapons (either single-shot or repeating) or as attachments mounted to a parent firearm, usually a rifle. Larger crew-served automatic grenade launchers such as the Mk 19 are mounted on tripods or vehicles.

Some armored fighting vehicles also mount fixed arrays of short-range, single-shot grenade launchers as a means of defense.

==History==

=== Early precursors ===

The earliest devices that could be referred to as grenade launchers were slings, which could be used to throw early &quot;grenado&quot; fuse bombs. The ancestors of modern ballistic grenade launchers, however, were simplistic muzzle-loading devices using a stake-like body to mount a short, large-bore gun barrel into which an explosive or incendiary device could be inserted; these were later refined into shoulder-fired blunderbuss-like firearms referred to as &quot;hand mortars&quot;. These weapons were not highly regarded due to their unreliability, requiring the user to ignite a fuse on the projectile before firing, and with a substantial risk of the explosive failing to leave the barrel; attempts to ignite the fuse on firing using the gunpowder charge resulted in weapons that would often force the fuse into the grenade and make it explode in the barrel.

=== Hand grenade launchers ===
During the First World War, several novel crew-served launchers designed to increase the range of infantry hand grenades were developed, such as the Sauterelle crossbow, the West spring gun, and the Leach trench catapult devices. None were particularly effective, and such devices were ultimately replaced by light mortar systems such as the Stokes mortar, while the task of increasing the range of infantry explosive projectiles was primarily taken by rifle grenades.

A late example of such a system was the Japanese Type 91 grenade, which could be used as a thrown hand grenade, or fitted with adaptors to either be fired as a rifle grenade or used as a projectile by the Type 89 grenade discharger, a light infantry mortar.

=== Rifle grenades ===

A new method of launching grenades was developed during the First World War and used throughout World War II. The principle was to use the soldier&#x27;s standard rifle as an ersatz mortar, mounting a grenade (in many older cases an infantry hand grenade) fitted with a propelling charge, using an adaptor or socket on the weapon&#x27;s muzzle or inside a mounted launching cup, and usually firing with the weapon&#x27;s stock resting on the ground. For older rifle grenades, igniting the charge generally required loading the parent rifle with a special blank propellant cartridge, though modern rifle grenades can be fired using live rounds using &quot;bullet trap&quot; and &quot;shoot through&quot; systems.

The system has some advantages; since it does not have to fit in a weapon&#x27;s barrel, the warhead can be made larger and more powerful compared to that of a unitary grenade round, and the rifle&#x27;s weight and handling characteristics are not affected as with underbarrel systems unless a grenade is actually mounted. While older systems required the soldier carry a separate adaptor or cup to attach to the rifle to make it ready to launch (such as the German&quot; Schiessbecher&quot;), later rifle grenades were often designed to attach to the standard factory-mounted flash hider of the parent rifle; for example, the NATO-standardized 22 mm rifle grenade can be mounted to most post-WWII Western military rifles without the need for an adaptor.

The disadvantage of this method is that when soldiers want to launch grenades, they must mount the grenade to the muzzle prior to each shot. If they are surprised by a close-range threat while preparing to fire the grenade, they have to reverse the procedure before they can respond with rifle fire. Due to the lack of a barrel, rifle grenades also tend to be more difficult to fire accurately compared to under-barrel or stand-alone designs.

Prior to the development of lightweight disposable antitank weapons such as the M72 LAW, large rifle grenades such as the ENERGA were the preferred method for allowing infantry who were not part of dedicated antitank teams to engage vehicles. Rifle grenades have largely fallen out of favor since the late 1960s and early 1970s, replaced in most of their traditional roles by dedicated grenade launchers, though a recent resurgence in interest in such devices for special purposes has occurred.

== Types ==

=== Stand-alone ===
The earliest examples of stand-alone grenade launchers in the modern sense were breech-loading riot guns designed to launch tear gas grenades and baton rounds, such as the Federal Riot Gun developed in the 1930s. One of the first examples of a dedicated breech-loading launcher for unitary explosive grenade rounds was the M79 grenade launcher, a result of the American Special Purpose Individual Weapon program (specifically the 40×46mm grenade round developed during Project NIBLICK, applying the German-developed high–low system to produce manageable recoil). The goal for the M79 was the production of a device with greater range than a rifle grenade but more portable than a mortar. Such single-shot devices were largely replaced in military service with underbarrel grenade launchers, removing the need for a dedicated grenadier with a special weapon. Many modern underbarrel grenade launchers can, however, also be used in standalone configurations with suitable accessories fitted; this is of particular preference for groups using submachine guns as their primary armament, since it is rarely practical to mount an underbarrel launcher on such a weapon. Single shot launchers are also still commonly used in riot control operations.

Heavier multi-shot grenade launchers like the ARWEN 37 are used as tear gas and smoke projectors in riot control, while military launchers like the Milkor MGL are used to provide heavy sustained firepower to infantry; most such devices, dating back to the Manville machine-projector, use a revolver-style cylinder, though a handful of pump-action weapons built like oversized shotguns, such as the China Lake grenade launcher and GM-94, also exist. Magazine-fed semi-automatic designs such as the Neopup PAW-20 and XM25 CDTE have also been created for military use, using smaller rounds (respectively 20 and 25mm) for purposes of practicality in terms of the size of the magazine, and reduced collateral damage compared to 40mm rounds.

=== Attached ===

Since grenade launchers require relatively low internal pressure and only a short barrel, a lightweight launcher can be mounted under the barrel of a traditional rifle; this type of device is referred to as an &quot;&quot;underbarrel&quot; or &quot;underslung&quot;&quot; grenade launcher. This reduces the weight the soldier must carry by eliminating the grenade launcher&#x27;s buttstock and makes the grenade launcher available for use at a moment&#x27;s notice. Underbarrel 40 mm grenade launchers generally have their own trigger group; to fire, one simply changes grips, disengages the safety, and pulls the trigger. In Western systems, the barrel slides forward or pivots to the side to allow reloading; most fire a 40×46mm grenade cartridge. Soviet and Russian launchers are instead loaded from the muzzle, with the cartridge casing affixed to the projectile in the style of a mortar shell. For aiming, underbarrel grenade launchers typically use a separate ladder, leaf, tangent or quadrant sight attached to the launcher or the rifle, either to one side of the handguard or on top of the handguard in between the iron sights. Modern launchers often have the option of mounting more sophisticated aiming systems, such as ballistic rangefinders and day / night sights.

As with the M79, the concept of mounting a dedicated grenade launcher to a service rifle has its roots in the Special Purpose Individual Weapon program; though the experimental Colt XM148 grenade launcher had been produced earlier, it had proved too problematic to adopt. One AAI submission for SPIW mounted a &quot;simple&quot; single-action, single-shot breech-loading underbarrel grenade launcher in lieu of the required semi-automatic multi-shot device. With refinement, this was adopted as the M203 grenade launcher in 1968. A variety of lengths of M203 are available along with numerous parts kits to fit it to various rifles aside from the AR15 pattern weapons it was designed for.

More modern Western grenade launchers address some of the shortcomings of the M203, such as the sliding breech limiting the weapon&#x27;s ability to load outsize projectiles and the lack of factory-fitted sight mounts, with designs like FN Herstal&#x27;s ELGM and Heckler &amp; Koch&#x27;s AG36 featuring a swing-out breech to provide better access, integral sight mounts, and built-in support for standalone conversion. A variant of the latter weapon, the M320 Grenade Launcher Module, was salvaged from the failed XM8 program and adopted in 2008 as the US military&#x27;s replacement for the M203.

Soviet development of an underbarrel launcher for the AK rifle series began in 1966 and in 1978 produced the GP-25, a muzzle-loading device for the AK-74 rifle using a mortar-like grenade round which functions by venting its propellant through holes in the base; this is a variation of the high-low system used by Western rounds, with the base of the projectile acting as the high-pressure chamber and the launcher&#x27;s barrel acting as the low-pressure chamber. Further developments led to the GP series of grenade launchers.

A number of experimental weapon systems have attempted to produce combination weapons which consist of a permanently attached grenade launcher and a carbine assault rifle, often with the rifle mounted underneath the launcher, most notably the XM29 OICW, but so far the only such weapon to reach full production is the S&amp;T Daewoo K11, adopted in limited numbers by the South Korean military.

=== Automatic ===

An &quot;automatic grenade launcher&quot; or &quot;grenade machine gun&quot; is a crew-served support weapon which fires explosive rounds in quick succession from an ammunition belt or large-capacity magazine. As most are heavy weapons, they are normally attached to a tripod or vehicle mounting, and as well as being used to provide heavy suppressing fire in the manner of a heavy machine gun, also have sufficient firepower to destroy vehicles and buildings. Examples include the Mk 19, AGS-17, and the HK GMG.

Automatic grenade launchers generally use a higher-velocity round than infantry weapons; NATO launchers use a 40×53mm grenade round rather than the 40×46mm round used by infantry. There are exceptions to this rule: the crank-operated Mk 18 Mod 0 grenade launcher, a unique example of an AGL which was not fully automatic, and the Mk 20 Mod 0 grenade launcher both used the 40×46mm round, and the Chinese Type 87 grenade launcher, a device intended to be employed like a general-purpose machine gun, uses the same 35×32mm low-velocity grenade round as the QLG91B underbarrel launcher for the QBZ-95 assault rifle.
===Fixed arrays===

Some armored fighting vehicles also mount fixed arrays of short range, single-shot grenade launchers as a means of defense. These devices usually fire smoke grenades to conceal the vehicle behind a smoke screen, though can also be loaded with chaff, flares, or anti-personnel grenades to repel infantry attacks. Vehicle-mounted smoke grenade launchers are also known as smoke (grenade) dischargers. Some World War II examples of these devises are the German &quot;Nebelkerzenabwurfvorrichtung&quot;, &quot;Nebelwurfgerät&quot;, &quot;Minenabwurfvorrichtung&quot; and &quot;Nahverteidigungswaffe&quot;.

==Ammunition==
Most grenade launchers are flexible in terms of the types of ammunition they can employ. In military use, the primary ammunition type for a grenade launcher is fragmentation rounds, with the most common grenade round in use by NATO the 40 mm fragmentation grenade, which is effective against a wide range of targets, including infantry and lightly armored vehicles. The large size of the grenade projectile relative to a bullet also allows for payloads requiring a substantial mass of chemicals, such as flares, incendiary rounds, gas grenades and smoke grenades. Law enforcement users generally employ grenade launchers in riot control operations to project obscuring smoke or tear gas; less-lethal crowd control munitions such as baton and sponge rounds also exist for such use.

Lethal rounds are usually fitted with an inertial fuzing system which arms the warhead after it has rotated a set number of times, in order to prevent the user from harming themselves if a grenade encounters a nearby obstruction.

Western launchers are primarily either the 37 mm flare caliber intended for civilian and law enforcement use, or the larger military 40 mm caliber. This is intended to prevent civilian-legal flare projectors being used to fire lethal military ammunition, since lethal rounds are not manufactured in 37mm caliber. The reverse is not true; a full range of less-lethal ammunition is available in 40 mm caliber, and an increasing number of law enforcement launchers not intended for the civilian market are chambered for 40×46mm rounds.Recently militaries have paid great attention to the development of &quot;smart&quot; grenade systems with integrated sighting systems, which can be used as point-detonating rounds as normal, or fuzed to detonate in mid-air at a preset distance to engage targets in cover with their fragments. This ammunition was first developed as High Explosive Air Burst (HEAB) as part of the Small Arms Master Plan (SAMP) projects: the Objective Individual Combat Weapon (20×28mm and 25×40mm low-velocity) and Advanced Crew Served Weapon (25×59mm high-velocity) projects. The low-velocity round was to have been used by the XM25 CDTE. Following the failure of the SAMP weapon programs, the United States developed 40 mm grenades incorporating similar technology, including the 40×53mm MK285 Programmable Prefragmented High Explosive/Self-Destructible (PPHE/SD) round for the Mk 47 Striker AGL and more recently the SAGM round for 40×46mm underbarrel launchers, an airburst-only computerized grenade which does not require an integrated sighting system. Other countries have also produced grenades using similar technology, including South Korea for the S&amp;T Daewoo K11, Australia during the Advanced Individual Combat Weapon program, and China for the ZH-05 grenade launcher module.

==Legality==

===United States===
In the U.S., under the National Firearms Act of 1934, breech-loading firearms with a barrel diameter of greater than .50 inches (12.7 mm) and no practical sporting use are classified as Title II &quot;destructive devices&quot;, with ownership heavily restricted and banned entirely in some states; in addition, each individual round of explosive ammunition for a grenade launcher is &quot;also&quot; classified as a destructive device and subject to the same restrictions. The state of California additionally considers rifles with integral rifle grenade launching devices as destructive devices in accordance with the definition of such in section 16460 of the California Penal Code. However, it is legal for civilians to own 37mm flare launchers which are not regulated as firearms, some of which are designed to have a cosmetic appearance similar to a grenade launcher and use certain types of ammunition, as the BATFE has ruled that unless such devices are possessed along with direct-fire ammunition such as pellet or beanbag rounds, they are not destructive devices. One result of this is that in American film productions, visually similar 37mm launchers are often substituted for 40mm weapons.

A &quot;grenade launcher&quot; or &quot;grenade launcher mount&quot; is usually included in the list of features defining an &quot;assault weapon&quot;, though this is a legal definition which primarily affects firearms with flash hiders compatible with rifle grenades, since firearms that are designed specifically for launching explosive grenade rounds and their ammunition are already federally restricted as destructive devices. Several state assault weapon bans extend this to include under-barrel 37mm flare launchers on the list of banned features.

<doc id="304892" wikidata="Q3129316" url="?curid=304892" title="Hedayat Amin Arsala">
<text>Hedayat Amin Arsala (; born January 12, 1942) is an economist and a prominent politician in Afghanistan. Mr. Arsala is a former Vice President of Afghanistan, Finance Minister and Foreign Minister and until October 2013 was the Senior Minister of the Republic of Afghanistan, appointed by the President Hamid Karzai.

==Education==
An ethnic Pashtun, Arsala grew up in Kabul, Afghanistan, where he attended high school. THe powerful family Arsala originated from the Nangarhar Province, with his cousins Haji Abdul Qadeer, Din Mohammad and Abdul Haq and his ancestors Wazir Arsala Khan and Aminullah Khan also stemming from this family. He completed his BA and MA in Economics, also focusing on international relations, at Southern Illinois University (SIU) in the United States of America. He also completed the course work and qualifying exams for a PhD in Economics at George Washington University, in Washington, D.C. In May 2008, SIU conferred an honorary doctorate on Arsala for his distinguished services to Afghanistan.

==Career==
In 1969, Arsala was the first Afghan to join the World Bank (WB) through the Young Professional Program. He served there for 18 years in several economic and senior operational posts. Active in the resistance against the Soviet occupation since 1979, he left the WB in 1987 to participate full-time in the Afghan struggle. He was a founding member of the National Islamic Front of Afghanistan (NIFA), led by Pir Sayed Ahmad Gailani and a member of the Supreme Council of Mujahideen Unity (formed in February 1980). He served as the Finance Minister in the Afghan Interim Government (AIG) in exile from 1989 to 1992.

When the Soviets withdrew and there was a subsequent regime change in Afghanistan, Arsala was appointed as the Foreign Minister of the newly formed Mujahideen coalition government in early 1993. He withdrew from that post in 1995 due to infighting and political disagreement amongst some Mujahideen groups.

With the rise of the Taliban, Arsala- with some compatriots- launched a peace campaign which called for a broad-based interim Government through a Loya Jirga. This peace movement, later known as &#x27;The Rome Group&#x27; and its key members, including Arsala, were key participants in the Bonn deliberations after 11 September 2001. The Bonn Conference resulted in the Bonn Agreement and the formation of the Interim Afghan Administration. Mr. Hamid Karzai was appointed Chairman and Mr. Arsala Vice Chairman and the first Minister of Finance in post-Taliban Afghanistan. The Bonn Conference also provided a roadmap for subsequent political developments. In June 2002, the Transitional Government of Afghanistan was formed. The Emergency Loya Jirga of Afghanistan elected Mr. Hamid Karzai as President and Mr. Arsala was appointed as Vice President of Afghanistan.

As Vice-President (VP), Arsala simultaneously headed the Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission. He also chaired the Economic Coordination Council and the National Census Committee. He was a member of the National Security Council and at times, in Mr. Karzai&#x27;s absence, Acting President. After 2.5 years as VP, Arsala was appointed Senior Advisor to the President as well as the Minister for Commerce and Industry. In 2006, he became the Senior Minister of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and in the latter part of 2008, he simultaneously became the Chairman of the Government Coordination Committee (GCC) and served as the Co-Chair of the Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board.

==Accomplishments==
As the first Minister of Finance in the post-Taliban regime, Arsala:
* Introduced the first Afghan budget and enforced fiscal discipline by stopping the finance of Government expenditure through Central Bank borrowing.
* Initiated the discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on introducing the new Afghan currency.
* Led an increase in Government revenue by 60% above IMF projections.

In early 2002, Arsala also co-chaired the first international Afghanistan aid and development conference in Tokyo. Later in the same year, he led the first international aid conference in Afghanistan. He pioneered a number of innovative civil service initiatives aimed at improving the public sector and effective governance within Afghanistan, creating the first Independent Administration Reform and civil service Commission to reform government institutions and introducing a system of civil service appointments and promotion on the basis of merit rather than patronage or nepotism. A champion of public sector reform and private sector growth, as Minister of Commerce and Industry he introduced a number of important improvements to remove barriers to the private sector and champion increased investment:
* Bringing the majority of state revenue sources within the Ministry&#x27;s remit – previously pilfered by officials and political groups – under Government control.
* Drafting new laws on commerce, economic activities and institutions, signing numerous bilateral trade and investment guarantee agreements.
* Accelerating the process of Afghanistan&#x27;s accession to the World Trade Organisation, subsequently formalised.
* Initiating reform of the Chamber of Commerce and Industries and creating an Export Promotion Agency.
* Overseeing a 60% increase in annual exports to US$500 million.

During Arsala&#x27;s tenure, exports increased from US$300 million to US$500 million. He represented Afghanistan at several international conferences including those of Heads of State and Governments.

==Personal life==
Arsala is married, with three children and five grandchildren.

<doc id="304895" wikidata="Q14479211" url="?curid=304895" title="Harold Keke">
<text>Harold Keke (born 1971) is a former Solomon Islands warlord involved with the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army (GRA).

He surrendered to an Australian led peacekeeper force in 2003 and sentenced to life imprisonment for murder.

== Biography ==
The grandson of one of the founders of the South Seas Evangelical Church in Australia, Keke was raised a Catholic in the Solomons, but left the faith to become a petty criminal in Papua New Guinea. After a number of years, he returned home, where he took work as a police officer, and embraced evangelical Christianity.

During the 1990s, tensions flared up between indigenous inhabitants of Guadalcanal and immigrants from neighboring Malaita. Following the election of Bartholomew Ulufa&#x27;alu, militants, including those led by a newly radicalized Keke, began a campaign of intimidation and violence against Malaitan settlers. This, including Keke&#x27;s 1998 raid of a police armory, led to the formation of the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) and all out ethnic warfare in the islands.

Keke views himself as a prophet, leading his people to their &quot;promised land&quot;. He also claims that he had political backing for the start of the conflict from then-premier Ezekiel Alebua—who provided money, weapons, and ammunition for the GRA. This claim has been denied by Alebua, who calls Keke &quot;little more than a violent thug&quot;.

During the ensuing conflict, the MEF gained the upper hand, deposing the government and gaining control of most police forces; making them a &quot;de facto&quot; extension of the militias. Many of the militias opposed to the MEF struck a peace deal in late 2000, but Keke refused to sign, moving his soldiers into the jungles of the Weather Coast to avoid capture.

The GRA, under Keke&#x27;s leadership, has been accused of a variety of crimes, including arson, kidnapping, assassination, and murder. Keke has been personally implicated in more than 50 murders, including that of cabinet minister and priest Augustine Geve, as well as seven missionaries from the Melanesian Brotherhood.

In April 2003, seven Christian brothers—Brother Robin Lindsay and his companions—were martyred on the Weather Coast of Guadalcanal by Keke. Six had gone in search of their Brother Nathaniel, who it turns out had already been tortured and killed. During the tensions Nathaniel had befriended the militant group but Harold Keke accused him of being a government spy and he was beaten to death while singing hymns. They are commemorated by the church on 24 April.

In late 2003, following the arrival of a multi-national intervention force led by Australia, Keke called for a cease-fire, and surrendered to peace-keepers. In 2005, he was convicted of the murder of Geve, and sentenced to life in prison.

<text>A war profiteer is any person or organization that derives unreasonable profit from warfare or by selling weapons and other goods to parties at war. The term typically carries strong negative connotations. General profiteering, making a profit criticized as excessive or unreasonable, also occurs in peacetime. An example of war profiteers were the &quot;shoddy&quot; millionaires who allegedly sold recycled wool and cardboard shoes to soldiers during the American Civil War. Some have argued that major modern defense conglomerates like Lockheed Martin, Mitsubishi, Boeing, BAE Systems, General Dynamics, and RTX Corporation fit the description in the post-9/11 era. This argument is based in the political influence of the defense industry, for example in 2010 the defense industry spent $144 million on lobbying and donated over $22.6 million to congressional candidates, as well as large profits for defense company shareholders in the post-9/11 period.

==History==

=== American Revolution ===
There were a number of food riots during the American Revolution against profiteering merchants, there were more than thirty riots in the period between 1776 and 1779. In 1777 a mob of Boston women beat the merchant Thomas Boylston and confiscated his stock for hoarding coffee and sugar to drive up the price. In East Hartford, Connecticut a mob of twenty women and three men took 218lbs of sugar from a Mr. Pitkin&#x27;s. In Beverly, Massachusetts a mob of 60 women and some additional men forced local merchants to charge the same price for sugar in American paper money and gold coin.

=== Industrial Revolution ===

In 1798, American inventor Eli Whitney received a government contract to manufacture 10,000 muskets in less than two years. After failing to produce a single musket, he was called to Washington to defend his expenditure of the treasury funds before a committee that included both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. Believing to demonstrate the ingenuity of interchangeable parts, Whitney earned widespread support and has been incorrectly credited with inventing the idea of interchangeable parts. However Merritt Roe Smith concluded that this demonstration was staged by marking the parts beforehand, so they were not as interchangeable as he made them seem. Eventually Whitney was able to accomplish his goal of 10,000 muskets with interchangeable parts at a relatively low cost in the next eight years, and later produced more than 15,000 in the following four years.

===Military–industrial complex===

A prominent example of the impact arms-producing industries have over American policy is evident in the case of Lockheed Martin donating $75,000 to House Armed Services Committee chair Representative Mac Thornberry (R-TX). Representative Thornberry later passed a bill through the House of Representatives that would benefit Lockheed Martin. This decision was made as a direct result of the influence of Lockheed Martin. &quot;Politico&quot; has stated that Thornberry was the &quot;highest overall recipient of contractor contributions among all of the 89 members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees.&quot;

==Contemporary manufacturing==
Currently, the United States is the world&#x27;s largest weapons manufacturer and exporter, followed by Russia, France, Germany, China and the United Kingdom consecutively.

===International arms dealers===
Basil Zaharoff&#x27;s Vickers Company sold weapons to all the parties involved in the Chaco War. Companies like Opel and IBM have been labeled war profiteers for their involvement with the Third Reich. In the case of IBM they developed technologies that were used to count, catalog, and select Jewish people whom could then be targeted for efficient asset confiscation, consolidation in ghettos, deportation, enslaved labor, and, ultimately, annihilation.

====Commodity dealers====
War usually leads to a shortage in the supply of commodities, which results in higher prices and higher revenues. Regarding supply and demand in terms of economics, profit is the most important end. During war time, &quot;war-stuff&quot; is in high demand, and demands must be met. Prior to the invasion of Iraq in 2003, oil production was controlled by the Iraqi government, and was off limits to Western companies. As of 2014, foreign owned private firms dominate Iraqi oil production.

====Civilian contractors====
Private military contractors, including civilian contractors, are businesses that supply weapons and training to the military, and also handle logistics and base management. While private military contractors may seem similar to mercenaries, the difference is that mercenaries operate illegally. More recently, companies involved with supplying the coalition forces in the Iraq War, such as Bechtel, KBR, Academi (formerly known as Blackwater) and Halliburton, have come under fire for allegedly overcharging for their services. The modern private military company is also offered as an example of sanctioned war profiteering. On the opposing side, companies like Huawei Technologies, which upgraded Saddam&#x27;s air-defense system between the two Gulf Wars, face such accusations.

====Black marketeers====
A distinction can be made between war profiteers who gain by sapping military strength and those who gain by contributing to the war. For instance, during and after World War II, enormous profits were available by selling rationed goods like cigarettes, chocolate, coffee and butter on the black market. Dishonest military personnel given oversight over valuable property sometimes diverted rationed goods to the black market. The charge could also be laid against medical and legal professionals who accept money in exchange for helping young men and nascent politicians evade the draft.

==The state==
Though war initially had the objective of territorial expansion and resource gathering, the country may also profit politically and strategically, replacing governments that do not fulfill its interests by key allied governments. One example of this is the CIA supporting the Contras with weapons to carry out terror attacks against the Nicaraguan government between the late 1970s and early 1990s.

===Politicians===
Political figures taking bribes and favors from corporations involved with war production have been called war profiteers. Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s first Secretary of War, Simon Cameron, was forced to resign in early 1862 after charges of corruption relating to war contracts. In 1947, Kentucky congressman Andrew J. May, Chairman of the powerful Committee on Military Affairs, was convicted for taking bribes in exchange for war contracts. In 1953 the United States began a covert mission to overthrow the Guatemalan government under Jacobo Arbenez. The process began with the United States labeling the government of Guatemala as a communist government. According to William Blum the reason for the United States’ intervention into Guatemala is that it was pushed by lobbyist from the United Fruit Company. The United Fruit Company had significant holdings within Guatemala and when the government decided to compete with the company this would not be accepted. Numerous officials such as President Eisenhower&#x27;s Under-Secretary of State (and formerly director of the CIA) Walter Bedell Smith was a candidate for an executive position in the company while at the same time he was helping to plan the intervention. This coup was successful and the United Fruit Company was able to keep its holdings within Guatemala thus ensuring its profits were secure. This is typical of the sort of engagements that the U.S became involved in during the cold war that resulted in war profiteering.

Modern-day war profiteering among politicians has increased with the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. According to an article by &quot;USA Today&quot; in 2011 the top 100 largest contractors sold 410 billion dollars’ worth of arms and services. Within this massive expense of services has evolved what is called the revolving door. This revolving door has not differentiated between the two political parties. An example of this revolving door is the case of William J. Lynn III. In 2010 he was confirmed to serve as the number two man in the Pentagon after he worked as a lobbyist for Raytheon. This example shows the process of a person joining the government, then being hired as a lobbyist, and back to government. The revolving door is still in existence to this day.

===Scientific research===

War provides demand for military technology modernization. Technologies originally designed for the military frequently also have non-military use. Both the state and corporations have gains from scientific research. One famous example is Siri, the artificially intelligent &quot;personal assistant&quot; programmed into Apple devices since October 4, 2011. Siri was a spin-off of CALO, a project funded by the government military development group, DARPA. CALO is an acronym that stands for &quot;Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes&quot;.

===In the United States===
The &quot;War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007&quot; intended to create criminal penalties for war profiteers and others who exploited taxpayer-funded efforts in Iraq and elsewhere around the world. This act was introduced first on April 25, 2007, but was never enacted into law. War profiteering cases are often brought under the Civil False Claims Act, which was enacted in 1863 to combat war profiteering during the Civil War.

Major General Smedley Butler, United States Marine Corps, criticized war profiteering of US companies during World War I in &quot;War Is a Racket&quot;. He wrote that some companies and corporations increased their earnings and profits by up to 1,700 percent and how many companies willingly sold equipment and supplies to the US that had no relevant use in the war effort. In the book, Butler stated that &quot;It has been estimated by statisticians and economists and researchers that the war cost your Uncle Sam $52,000,000,000. Of this sum, $39,000,000,000 was expended in the actual war period. This expenditure yielded $16,000,000,000 in profits.&quot;

In the American Civil War, concerns about war profiteering were not limited to the activities of a few &quot;shoddy&quot; millionaires in the North. In the Confederacy, where supplies were severely limited, and hardships common, the mere suggestion of profiteering was considered a scurrilous charge. Georgia Quartermaster General Ira Roe Foster attempted to increase the supply of material to the troops by urging the women of his state to knit 50,000 pairs of socks. Foster&#x27;s sock campaign stimulated the supply of the much needed item, but it also met with a certain amount of suspicion and backlash. Either the result of a Union disinformation campaign, or the work of suspicious minds, rumors, which Foster denied as a &quot;malicious falsehood!&quot;, began to spread that Foster and others were profiteering from the socks. It was alleged that the socks contributed were being sold, rather than given to the troops. The charge was not without precedent. The historian Jeanie Attie notes that in 1861, an &quot;especially damaging rumor&quot; (later found to be true) circulated in the North, alleging that the Union Army purchased 5,000 pairs of socks which had been donated, and intended for the troops, from a private relief agency, the United States Sanitary Commission. As the Sanitary Commission had done in the North, Foster undertook a propaganda campaign in Georgia newspapers to combat the damaging rumors and to encourage the continued contribution of socks. He offered $1,000.00 to any &quot;citizen or soldier who will come forward and prove that he ever bought a sock from this Department that was either knit by the ladies or purchased for issue to said troops.&quot;

====Iraq War profiteers====
Companies such as Halliburton have been criticized in the context of the Iraq War for their perceived war profiteering.

Steven Clemons, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation think tank, has accused former CIA Director James Woolsey of both profiting from and promoting the Iraq War.

The Center for Public Integrity has reported that US Senator Dianne Feinstein, who voted in favor of the Iraq Resolution, and her husband, Richard Blum, are making millions of dollars from Iraq and Afghanistan contracts through his company, Tutor Perini Corporation. Financial disclosure forms indicate that as of January 2020 51 members of Congress and their partners own between $2.3 and $5.8 million of stock in the top 30 corporations that sell goods and services to the U.S. military.

Indicted defense contractor Brent R. Wilkes was reported to be ecstatic when hearing that the United States was going to go to war with Iraq. &quot;He and some of his top executives were really gung-ho about the war,&quot; said a former employee. &quot;Brent said this would create new opportunities for the company. He was really excited about doing business in the Middle East.&quot;
One of the top profiteers from the Iraq War was oil field services corporation, Halliburton. Halliburton gained $39.5 billion in &quot;federal contracts related to the Iraq war&quot;. Many individuals have asserted that there were profit motives for the Bush-Cheney administration to invade Iraq in 2003. Dick Cheney served as Halliburton&#x27;s CEO from 1995 until 2000. Cheney claimed he had cut ties with the corporation although, according to a CNN report, &quot;Cheney was still receiving about $150,000 a year in deferred payments.&quot; Cheney vowed to not engage in a conflict of interest. However, the Congressional Research Office discovered Cheney held 433,000 Halliburton stock options while serving as Vice President of the United States. 2016 Presidential Candidate, Rand Paul referenced Cheney&#x27;s interview with the American Enterprise Institute in which Cheney said invading Iraq &quot;would be a disaster, it would be vastly expensive, it would be civil war, we&#x27;d have no exit strategy...it would be a bad idea&quot;. Rand continues by concluding &quot;that&#x27;s why the first Bush didn&#x27;t go into Baghdad. Dick Cheney then goes to work for Halliburton. Makes hundreds of millions of dollars- their CEO. Next thing you know, he&#x27;s back in government, it&#x27;s a good idea to go into Iraq.&quot; Another prominent critic is &quot;Huffington Post&quot; co-founder, Arianna Huffington. Huffington has said, &quot;We have the poster child of Bush-Cheney crony capitalism, Halliburton, involved in this. They, after all, were responsible for cementing the well.&quot;

====Afghanistan War====

During the Afghanistan War, defense sector stocks outperformed the average of the stock market by 58%. Commentators put into question whether the 2021 Taliban takeover of Afghanistan could be considered a failure for the United States. Jon Schwarz of &quot;The Intercept&quot; wrote that &quot;These numbers suggest that it is incorrect to conclude [that the] Afghanistan War was a failure. On the contrary, from the perspective of some of the most powerful people in the U.S., it may have been an extraordinary success. Notably, the boards of directors of all [top] five defense contractors include retired top-level military officers.&quot;

From 2007, there were regularly more contractors than U.S. forces in Afghanistan. By 2016, private contractors outnumbered US state personnel three to one. In 2016, the Harris Corporation was awarded a $1.7 billion contract to supply communications equipment to Afghan security forces.

===Russian invasion of Ukraine===
The major oil and gas companies, including Shell, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Phillips 66, BP and Sinopec, and the major weapon manufacturers, such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems, reported sharp rises in interim revenues and profits.

The term &quot;ABCD&quot; refers to the four companies – ADM, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus – that dominate world agricultural commodity trading. The ABCD commodity-trading companies have seen large profits as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and rising food prices.

In March 2022, &quot;Bloomberg&quot; reported that China was reselling its US LNG shipments to a desperate Europe at a &quot;hefty profit&quot;. India was buying discounted oil from Russia. Saudi Arabia also increased imports of discounted Russian oil. In September 2022, German Economy Minister Robert Habeck accused the United States and other &quot;friendly&quot; gas supplier nations that they were profiting from the Ukraine war with &quot;astronomical prices&quot;. He called for more solidarity by the US to assist energy-pressed allies in Europe.

In April 2022, Russia supplied 45% of EU&#x27;s gas imports, earning $900 million a day. In the first two months after Russia invaded Ukraine, Russia earned $66.5 billion from fossil fuel exports, and the EU accounted for 71% of that trade.

==In popular culture==

The term &#x27;war profiteer&#x27; evokes two stereotypes in popular culture: the rich businessman who sells weapons to governments, and the semi-criminal black marketeer who sells goods to ordinary citizens. In English-speaking countries this is particularly associated with Britain during World War II. The image of the &#x27;businessman profiteer&#x27; carries the implication of influence and power used to actively cause wars for personal gain, rather than merely passively profit from them. In the aftermath of World War I, such profiteers were widely asserted to have existed by both the Left, and the Right.

Fictional character Lieutenant Milo Minderbinder in the novel &quot;Catch-22&quot; has been called &quot;perhaps the best known of all fictional profiteers&quot; in American literature.

&quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; comic &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; features an arms dealer called Basil Bazarov who sells arms to both sides in a war. He is a recognisable example of this &quot;type&quot; and is specifically based on Basil Zaharoff.

Bertolt Brecht wrote the play &quot;Mother Courage and Her Children&quot; as a didactic indictment of war profiteering.

Daddy Warbucks was a war profiteer.

In the 1985 film &quot;Clue&quot;, Colonel Mustard was a war profiteer who sold stolen radio components on the black market.

The film &quot;The Third Man&quot; features a war profiteer named Harry Lime, who steals penicillin from military hospitals and sells it on the black market.

The film &quot;Lord of War&quot; is a fictional story based on the war profiteer named Viktor Bout, who illegally sold post-Soviet arms to Liberia and other nations in conflict.

The Suicide Machines released their 2005 album, entitled &quot;War Profiteering Is Killing Us All&quot;.

In the 2011 film &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot;, Professor Moriarty acquires shares in many military supply companies and plots to instigate a world war and make a fortune.

In Book 2 of &quot;The Legend of Korra&quot;, the character Varrick attempted to incite and encourage a civil war among the water tribes to make profit from selling weapons.

The song &quot;Masters of War&quot; by Bob Dylan is about war profiteering and the military–industrial complex.

In the film &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot;, Finn, Rose Tico and BB-8 travel to Canto Bight, a coastal city catering to the galaxy&#x27;s rich and elite. Finn is initially mesmerized by the city&#x27;s glitz and glamour until Rose informs him that most of the city&#x27;s inhabitants are war profiteers, having made their fortunes selling weapons and ships to the First Order and the Resistance. Also, the character of DJ shows Finn that the owner of the ship they&#x27;re on made his profit selling weapons to the good guys (the Resistance) and the bad (the First Order). DJ then tells Finn that &quot;it&#x27;s all a machine&quot; and that he should &quot;Live free, don&#x27;t join.&quot;

<doc id="304901" wikidata="Q1796771" url="?curid=304901" title="Köthen">
<text>Köthen () is a town in Germany. It is the capital of the district of Anhalt-Bitterfeld in Saxony-Anhalt, about north of Halle.

Köthen is the location of the main campus and the administrative centre of the regional university, Anhalt University of Applied Sciences/Hochschule Anhalt which is especially strong in information technology. The city is conveniently located at the hub of the Magdeburg–Leipzig, Dessau–Köthen and Köthen–Aschersleben railways.

Köthen is situated in a fertile area with rich black soil suitable to the cultivation of sugar-beets. Industry includes high-tech engineering, manufacture of cranes, as well as chemicals, printing, and foodstuffs.

In English, the name of the city is often spelt anachronistically as Cöthen, a practice that has become standard in the literature relating to the life and work of Johann Sebastian Bach, who resided and worked there from 1717 to 1723.

==History==

Owing to the fertile soil of the region, the area of Köthen is unusually rich in archaeological discoveries. The earliest signs of human habitation date from the early Stone Age about 250,000 years ago and evidence of every succeeding historical period may be found in the collections of the local Prehistorical Museum.

The first documentary mention of &quot;Cothene&quot; dates to 1115; by 1194 it was already known as a market town, becoming a seat of the princes of Anhalt. Köthen was chartered in 1200. For over two centuries (1603–1847) it was the capital of the independent principality (from 1806, duchy) of Anhalt-Köthen.

The town has long been known to classical music enthusiasts as the place of origin of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s best-known secular works, including the Brandenburg concertos and the Well-Tempered Clavier. Bach worked in Köthen from 1717 to 1723 as Kapellmeister for Prince Leopold von Anhalt-Köthen. It is also the birthplace of the composer Carl Friedrich Abel who, together with Johann Christian Bach, founded the popular &quot;Bach-Abel Concerts&quot; in London, the first subscription concerts in England.

Schloss Köthen has been fully restored except for a small side wing bombed in 1944. Its Hall of Mirrors where Bach&#x27;s music is now often performed is a popular attraction. It can be seen on DVD in the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra&#x27;s recording of the Brandenburg concertos. Since 1967 a bi-annual Bach Festival has been held at Köthen, in the various halls of the palace as well as the local churches. Another concert hall was opened in 2008 in the palace complex.

Samuel Hahnemann, the founder of homoeopathy, practised in Köthen from 1821 to 1834, and during this period he published many of his best-known works. In 1855 his disciple Arthur Lutze opened a palatial homoeopathic clinic. Hahnemann&#x27;s home is now open to tourists, and includes an actual working homoeopathic practice. The city has become the national center of homeopathy, location of congresses, and the seat of the new European Homeopathic Library. In 2013, the international homoeopathic medical society, &quot;Liga Medicorum Homoeopathica Internationalis&quot;, relocated its main operations to Köthen, so the city now is kind of a &quot;world&#x27;s capital of homoeopathy&quot;.

The pioneering ornithologist Johann Friedrich Naumann was born near Köthen and was employed at the ducal court for more than two decades (c. 1810-1835). His well-renowned collection of almost 1300 specimens and drawings of European birds is now the main part of an ornithological museum that is also situated in the palace.

<doc id="304903" wikidata="Q312028" url="?curid=304903" title="Eliel Saarinen">
<text>Gottlieb Eliel Saarinen (, ; August 20, 1873 – July 1, 1950) was a Finnish and American architect known for his work with Art Nouveau buildings in the early years of the 20th century. He was also the father of famed architect Eero Saarinen.

==Life and work in Finland==

Saarinen was educated in Helsinki at the Helsinki University of Technology. From 1896 to 1905 he worked as a partner with Herman Gesellius and Armas Lindgren at the firm Gesellius, Lindgren, Saarinen. His first major work with the firm, the Finnish pavilion at the Paris 1900 World Fair, exhibited an extraordinary convergence of stylistic influences: Finnish wooden architecture, the British Gothic Revival, and the Jugendstil. Saarinen&#x27;s early manner was later christened the Finnish National Romanticism and culminated in the Helsinki Central railway station (designed 1904, constructed 1910–14).

From 1910 to 1915 he worked on the extensive city-planning project of Munksnäs-Haga and later published a book on the subject. In January 1911 he became a consultant in city planning for Tallinn, Governorate of Estonia and was invited to Budapest to advise in city development. In 1912, a brochure written by Saarinen about the planning problems of Budapest was published. He was runner up behind Walter Burley Griffin in an international competition to design the new Australian capital city of Canberra in 1912, but the following year he received the first place award in an international competition for his plan of the city of Reval, now known as Tallinn. From 1917 to 1918 Saarinen worked on the city-plan for greater Helsinki. He also designed a series of postage stamps issued 1917 and the Finnish markka banknotes introduced in 1922.

After the divorce from his first wife, Mathilde (who then married Herman Gesellius), on March 6, 1904, Saarinen married his second wife, Louise (Loja) Gesellius, a sculptor in Helsinki, and the younger sister of Herman Gesellius. They had a daughter Eva-Lisa (Pipsan) on March 31, 1905, and a son Eero on August 20, 1910.

==Move to the United States==
Eliel Saarinen moved to the United States in 1923 after his competition entry for the Tribune Tower in Chicago, Illinois, won second place. While it was not built, the streamlined design inspired the architecture of many other skyscrapers. Saarinen first settled in Evanston, Illinois, where he worked on his scheme for the development of the Chicago lake front. In 1924 he became a visiting professor at the University of Michigan.

In 1925 George Gough Booth asked him to design the campus of Cranbrook Educational Community, intended to be an American equivalent to the Bauhaus. Saarinen taught there and became president of the Cranbrook Academy of Art in 1932. Among his student-collaborators were Ray Eames (then Ray Kaiser) and Charles Eames; Saarinen influenced their subsequent furniture design.

During 1929–34, Saarinen contributed product designs for the Wilcox Silver Plate Co. / International Silver Company in Meriden, Connecticut. His iconic tea urn (c. 1934) was first exhibited in 1934–35 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Over the years, the tea urn has been widely exhibited, including in &quot;St. Louis Modern&quot; (2015–16) at the St Louis Art Museum, &quot;Cranbrook Goes to the Movies: Films and Their Objects, 1925–1975&quot; at the Cranbrook Art Museum (2014–15), and in 2005–07, in the touring exhibition &quot;Modernism in American Silver: 20th-Century Design&quot;, organized by the Dallas Museum of Art, which also traveled to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. In 1951–52, the tea urn was featured in the &quot;Eliel Saarinen Memorial Exhibition&quot; which traveled to multiple venues across the United States. In addition to Cranbrook, the Dallas Museum and the St Louis Museum, The British Museum in London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art also hold tea urn-related Eliel Saarinen designs.
Eliel Saarinen became a professor in the University of Michigan&#x27;s Architecture Department.

His son, Eero (1910–1961), became one of the most important American architects of the mid-20th century, as one of the leaders of the International style. Saarinen&#x27;s student Edmund N. Bacon achieved national prominence as Executive Director of the Philadelphia City Planning Commission from 1949 to 1970.

Eliel received the AIA Gold Medal in 1947.

<doc id="304907" wikidata="Q3799118" url="?curid=304907" title="Inside Macintosh">
<text>Inside Macintosh is the developer documentation published by Apple Computer, documenting the APIs and architecture of the Macintosh&#x27;s classic Mac OS.

==History==
The first &quot;Inside Macintosh&quot; documentation, for the first Macintosh, was distributed in two large binders with photocopied 3-hole punched pages. Every few months, updated sections were distributed for insertion into the binders. Some of the original sections were written by very early members of the Macintosh group, including Chris Espinosa and Joanna Hoffman. All of these volumes were designed to be read together, with no information repeated.

In July 1982, Caroline Rose was hired to take over the software documentation, while Bradley Hacker focused on documenting the hardware. In addition to being the lead writer, Rose edited Volumes I–III and was the project supervisor. In 1984, additional writers joined the effort, including Robert Anders, Mark Metzler, Kate Withey, Steve Chernicoff, Andy Averill, and Brent Davis.  

Due to numerous last-minute software changes, the official version to be published by Addison-Wesley was delayed. In the meantime, a $25 Promotional Edition (known as the &quot;phone book edition&quot; because it was published by phone book publisher Lakeside Press) became available in April 1985.

Addison-Wesley published Volumes I–III in July 1985 in two formats: as three separate paperback books and as one hardcover book combining all three volumes. It is the official technical documentation for the original Macintosh, the Macintosh 512K (&quot;Fat Mac&quot;), and Macintosh XL.   

Since Volume IV, authorship is attributed only to Apple Computer in general. Volume IV (October 1986) documents the changes to the system software in the Macintosh Plus, which was introduced in January 1986. Volume V (February 1988) documents the Macintosh II and Macintosh SE, which were introduced in 1987. It discusses Color QuickDraw, the Mac II and Mac SE hardware, and other new software components. Volume VI (April 1991) describes System 7. With 32 chapters, it is thicker than the first three volumes combined.

Shortly after Volume VI was published, Apple revamped the entire &quot;Inside Macintosh&quot; series, breaking it into volumes according to the functional area discussed, rather than specific machine models or capabilities. In this form, the series is far more coherent and a much better reference for programmers. As new functionality was added to the classic Mac OS, new volumes could be written without invalidating those published earlier—in contrast to the first series, which became increasingly obsolete over time.

In the late 1990s, Apple stopped publishing &quot;Inside Macintosh&quot; as a printed book, instead as a CD-ROM at least since 1994, and online. Since then, the CD variant has been phased out, though Apple developers still received online documentation as part of the developer CDs. In its online form, the information is much easier to maintain, but some developers still prefer a printed format.

&quot;Inside Macintosh&quot; covers only the classic Mac OS and a new set of documentation was introduced for Mac OS X. Initially this documentation includes only the Carbon Specification identifying the APIs in Carbon and the Cocoa documentation inherited from OpenStep. Later, the Carbon Specification was refactored into the Carbon Reference, which actually documents the APIs, taking much content from &quot;Inside Macintosh&quot;. The Carbon Reference and Cocoa Reference are bundled together in the ADC Reference Library.

==Reception==
Reactions to Volumes I–III were mixed. Many praised the documentation for its clarity, thoroughness, and consistency, and others disagreed particularly about the lack of sample code.

In the January 27, 1986, issue of &quot;InfoWorld&quot;, columnist John C. Dvorak wrote that the highlight of the Appleworld Conference, for many, was Addison-Wesley&#x27;s publication of &quot;Inside Macintosh&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s $75 and worth every penny. It tells you everything you never wanted know about the Macintosh—a must for any developer.&quot; Also in 1986, &quot;Inside Macintosh&quot; Volumes I–III won an Award of Achievement in the Society for Technical Communication&#x27;s Northern California competition. In 1988, software developer and columnist Stan Krute wrote, &quot;If Pulitzers had a technical writing category, &quot;Inside Mac&quot; would win a prize. [Its writers] have given us the most comprehensive insight into a complex cybernetic system yet seen.&quot;

Bruce F. Webster in &quot;Byte&quot; of December 1985 described &quot;Inside Macintosh&quot; as &quot;infamous, expensive, and obscure [but] for anyone wanting to do much with the Mac [...] the only real [printed] source of information.&quot; He quoted Kathe Spracklen, developer of &quot;Sargon&quot;, as saying that the book &quot;consists of 25 chapters, each of which requires that you understand the other 24 before reading it&quot;. A Mac GUI article by Dog Cow quotes Robert C. Platt as saying, &quot;The best guide to the Mac&#x27;s ROMs is &quot;Inside Macintosh&quot;. Unfortunately, &quot;Inside Macintosh&quot; is also the most incomprehensible documentation ever written.&quot;

<doc id="304916" wikidata="Q1189566" url="?curid=304916" title="Grand Army Plaza">
<text>Grand Army Plaza, originally known as Prospect Park Plaza, is a public plaza that comprises the northern corner and the main entrance of Prospect Park in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. It consists of concentric oval rings arranged as streets, with the namesake Plaza Street comprising the outer ring. The inner ring is arranged as an ovoid roadway that carries the main street – Flatbush Avenue. Eight radial roads connect Vanderbilt Avenue; Butler Place; two separate sections of Saint John&#x27;s Place; Lincoln Place; Eastern Parkway; Prospect Park West; Union Street; and Berkeley Place. The only streets that penetrate to the inner ring are Flatbush Avenue, Vanderbilt Avenue, Prospect Park West, Eastern Parkway, and Union Street.

The plaza includes the Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Arch; the Bailey Fountain; the John F. Kennedy Monument; statues of Civil War generals Gouverneur K. Warren and Henry Warner Slocum; busts of notable Brooklyn citizens Alexander Skene and Henry W. Maxwell; and two 12-sided gazebos with &quot;granite Tuscan columns, Guastavino vaulting, and bronze finials&quot;.

==History==

The site of the future Grand Army Plaza was in the 17th century a pass through the Heights of Guan. It played a small role in the 1776 Battle of Long Island, the biggest battle of the American Revolutionary War.

The 1861 plan for Prospect Park included an elliptical plaza at the intersection of Flatbush and Ninth avenues. In 1867, the plaza was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux as a grand entrance to the Park to separate the noisy city from the calm nature of the Park. Olmsted and Vaux&#x27;s design included only the Fountain of the Golden Spray and the surrounding earth embankments covered in heavy plantings. The berms still shield the local apartment buildings and the Brooklyn Central Library from the noisy traffic circle that has developed. By 1869 the Abraham Lincoln statue by Henry Kirke Brown was north of the plaza fountain&#x27;s stairs, and the statue was moved to the lower terrace of the park&#x27;s Concert Grove in 1895.

The original 1867 fountain was successively replaced by an 1873 lighted fountain, an 1897-1915 fountain for exhibitions, and the 1932 Bailey Fountain, renovated in 2006.
In 1895, three bronze sculpture groups were added to the 1892 Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Arch. 

In 1926, the plaza, previously known as Prospect Park Plaza, was renamed Grand Army Plaza to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the foundation of the Grand Army of the Republic, a fraternal organization composed of veterans of the Union Army and other military services who served in the American Civil War.

In 1975, Grand Army Plaza became a National Historic Landmark. A private funding campaign in 1999 was established to restore the monument. In 2018, keystones from the roof fell and protective barriers were placed around the monument to safeguard pedestrians. A full restoration of the arch and statue was done in 2021, sponsored by the City and Prospect Park Alliance.

In 2008, a competition was held for designs to reorganize Grand Army Plaza to make it a more integral part of Prospect Park and more accessible to pedestrians. At the same time, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) made improvements in accessibility, putting sidewalks and planters in many of the striped areas. These improvements made it somewhat easier and safer for pedestrians and cyclists to cross from the park to the library and to the plaza. The changes made by the NYCDOT were modest in comparison to those in the designs in the competition, most of which called for the rerouting of some of the vast traffic flow.

In November 2022, the NYCDOT started soliciting public feedback for a proposal to close Grand Army Plaza permanently to vehicular traffic, converting the plaza to a pedestrian zone. The proposed pedestrian zone would connect with Underhill and Vanderbilt Avenues; these roads are part of the city&#x27;s Open Streets program, where vehicular traffic is restricted during certain times of day.

==Use==

The area around the Arch forms the largest and busiest traffic circle in Brooklyn, being the convergence of Flatbush Avenue, Vanderbilt Avenue, Eastern Parkway, Prospect Park West, and Union Street. In 1927, Brooklyn&#x27;s &quot;Death-O-Meter&quot;, a sign admonishing drivers to &quot;Slow Up&quot; and displaying a continually updated tally of traffic accident deaths in the borough, was installed.

A popular farmer&#x27;s market, part of the Greenmarket program of GrowNYC is held on the plaza in front of Prospect Park every Saturday from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.

The station is served by two New York City Subway stations and multiple bus routes. The Grand Army Plaza station (), built in 1920 on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line, is on the north end of the Plaza, while the Seventh Avenue station () on the BMT Brighton Line is several blocks northwest. The buses stop at Union Street and 7th Avenue, two blocks north, while the bus stops on Flatbush Avenue.
