<doc id="300465" wikidata="Q584691" url="?curid=300465" title="Diuresis">
<text>Diuresis () is the excretion of urine, especially when excessive (polyuria). The term collectively denotes the physiologic processes underpinning increased urine production by the kidneys during maintenance of fluid balance.

In healthy people, the drinking of extra water produces mild diuresis to maintain the body water balance. Many people with health issues, such as heart failure and kidney failure, need diuretic medications to help their kidneys deal with the fluid overload of edema. These drugs promote water loss via urine production. The concentrations of electrolytes in the blood are closely linked to fluid balance, so any action or problem involving fluid intake or output (such as polydipsia, polyuria, diarrhea, heat exhaustion, starting or changing doses of diuretics, and others) can require management of electrolytes, whether through self-care in mild cases or with help from health professionals in moderate or severe cases.

== Osmotic diuresis ==
Osmotic diuresis is the increase of urination rate caused by the presence of certain substances in the proximal tubule (PCT) of the kidneys. The excretion occurs when substances such as glucose enter the kidney tubules and cannot be reabsorbed (due to a pathological state or the normal nature of the substance). The substances cause an increase in the osmotic pressure within the tubule, causing retention of water within the lumen, and thus reduces the reabsorption of water, increasing urine output (i.e., diuresis). The same effect can be seen in therapeutics such as mannitol, which is used to increase urine output and decrease extracellular fluid volume.

Substances in the circulation can also increase the amount of circulating fluid by increasing the osmolarity of the blood. This has the effect of pulling water from the interstitial space, making more water available in the blood, and causing the kidney to compensate by removing it as urine. In hypotension, colloids are used often intravenously to increase circulating volume in themselves, but as they exert a certain amount of osmotic pressure, water is therefore also moved, further increasing circulating volume. As blood pressure increases, the kidney removes the excess fluid as urine. Sodium, chloride and potassium are excreted in osmotic diuresis, originating from diabetes mellitus (DM). Osmotic diuresis results in dehydration from polyuria and the classic polydipsia (excessive thirst) associated with DM.

==Forced diuresis==

Forced diuresis (increased urine formation by diuretics and fluid) may enhance the excretion of certain drugs in urine and is used to treat drug overdose or poisoning of these drugs and hemorrhagic cystitis.

===Diuretics===
Most diuretic drugs are either weak acids or weak bases. When urine is made alkaline, elimination of acidic drugs in the urine is increased. The converse applies for alkaline drugs. This method is only of therapeutic significance where the drug is excreted in active form in urine and where the pH of urine can be adjusted to levels above or below the pK value of the active form of drug. For acidic drugs, urine pH should be above the pK value of that drug, and converse for the basic drugs. It is because the ionization of acidic drug is increased in alkaline urine and ionized drugs cannot easily cross a plasma membrane so cannot re-enter blood from kidney tubules. This method is ineffective for drugs that are strongly protein bound (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) or which have a large apparent volume of distribution (e.g. paracetamol, tricyclic antidepressants).

For forced alkaline diuresis, sodium bicarbonate is added to the infusion fluid to make blood and, in turn, urine alkaline. Potassium replacement becomes of utmost importance in this setting because potassium is usually lost in urine. If blood levels of potassium are depleted below normal levels, then hypokalemia occurs, which promotes bicarbonate ion retention and prevents bicarbonate excretion, thus interfering with alkalinization of the urine. Forced alkaline diuresis has been used to increase the excretion of acidic drugs like salicylates and phenobarbitone, and is recommended for rhabdomyolysis.

For forced acid diuresis, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is sometimes used. Ammonium chloride has also been used for forced acid diuresis, but it is a toxic compound. Usually, however, this technique only produces a slight increase in the renal clearance of the drug. Forced acid diuresis is rarely done in practice, but can be used to enhance the elimination of cocaine, amphetamine, quinine, quinidine, atropine and strychnine when poisoning by these drugs has occurred.

==Rebound diuresis==

Rebound diuresis refers to the sudden resurgence of urine flow that occurs during recovery from acute kidney injury. In acute kidney injury, particularly acute tubular necrosis, the tubules become blocked with cellular matter, particularly necrotic sloughing of dead cells. This debris obstructs the flow of filtrate, which results in reduced output of urine. The arterial supply of the nephron is linked to the filtration apparatus (glomerulus), and reduced perfusion leads to reduced blood flow; usually this is the result of pre-renal pathology.

The kidney&#x27;s resorptive mechanisms are particularly energetic, using nearly 100% of the O2 supplied. Thus, the kidney is particularly sensitive to reduction in blood supply.
This phenomenon occurs because renal flow is restored prior to the normal resorption function of the renal tubule. As shown by the graph, urine flow recovers rapidly and subsequently overshoots the typical daily output (between 800 mL and 2L in most people). Since the kidney&#x27;s resorption capacity takes longer to re-establish, there is a minor lag in function that follows recovery of flow. A good reference range for plasma creatinine is between 0.07 - 0.12 mmol/L.

==Immersion diuresis==

Immersion diuresis is caused by immersion of the body in water (or equivalent liquid). It is mainly caused by lower temperature and by pressure.

The &quot;temperature&quot; component is caused by water drawing heat away from the body and causing vasoconstriction of the cutaneous blood vessels within the body to conserve heat. The body detects an increase in the blood pressure and inhibits the release of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH)), causing an increase in the production of urine. The &quot;pressure&quot; component is caused by the hydrostatic pressure of the water directly increasing blood pressure. Its significance is indicated by the fact that the temperature of the water does not substantially affect the rate of diuresis. Partial immersion of only the limbs does not cause increased urination. Thus, the hand in warm water trick (immersing the hand of a sleeping person in water to make them urinate) has no support from the mechanism of immersion diuresis. On the other hand, sitting up to the neck in a pool for a few hours clearly increases the excretion of water, salts, and urea.

==Cold-induced diuresis==

Cold-induced diuresis, or cold diuresis, is a phenomenon that occurs in humans after exposure to a hypothermic environment, usually during mild to moderate hypothermia. It is currently thought to be caused by the redirection of blood from the extremities to the core due to peripheral vasoconstriction, which increases the fluid volume in the core. Overall, acute exposure to cold is thought to induce a diuretic response due to an increase mean arterial pressure.
The arterial cells of the kidneys sense the increase in blood pressure and signal the kidneys to excrete superfluous fluid in an attempt to stabilize the pressure. The kidneys increase urine production and fill the bladder; when the bladder fills, the individual may then feel the urge to urinate. This phenomenon usually occurs after mental function has decreased to a level significantly below normal. Cold diuresis has been observed in cases of accidental hypothermia as well as a side effect of therapeutic hypothermia, specifically during the induction phase.

<text>The United Confederate Veterans (UCV, or simply Confederate Veterans) was an American Civil War veterans&#x27; organization headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana. It was organized on June 10, 1889, by ex-soldiers and sailors of the Confederate States of America as a merger between the Louisiana Division of the Veteran Confederate States Cavalry Association; N. B. Forrest Camp of Chattanooga, Tennessee; Tennessee Division of the Veteran Confederate States Cavalry Association; Tennessee Division of Association of Confederate Soldiers; Benevolent Association of Confederate Veterans of Shreveport, Louisiana; Confederate Association of Iberville Parish, Louisiana; Eighteenth Louisiana; Adams County (Mississippi) Veterans&#x27; Association; Louisiana Division of the Army of Tennessee; and Louisiana Division of the Army of Northern Virginia.

The U.S. equivalent of the UCV was the Grand Army of the Republic.

==History==
===Background===
There had been numerous local veterans associations in the Southern United States, many of which became part of the UCV. The organization proliferated throughout the 1890s, culminating with 1,555 camps at the 1898 reunion. The next few years marked the zenith of UCV membership, lasting until 1903 or 1904 when veterans started to die off and the organization gradually declined.

===Purpose===
The UCV outlined its purposes and structure in a written constitution based on military lines. Members holding appropriate UCV &quot;ranks&quot; officered and staffed echelons of command from General Headquarters at the top to local camps (companies) at the bottom. Their declared purpose was emphatically nonmilitary – to foster &quot;social, literary, historical, and benevolent&quot; ends.

According to Paul H. Buck in his Pulitzer-Prize winning history of the reconciliation of North and South, educator Jabez L. M. Curry played a major role in promoting reunification of the sections. He told the 1896 UCV annual convention that their organization was not formed, &quot;in malice or in mischief, in disaffection, or in rebellion, nor to keep alive sectional hates, nor to awaken revenge for defeat, nor to kindle disloyalty to the Union.&quot; Rather their &quot;recognition of the glorious deeds of our comrades is perfectly consistent with loyalty to the flag and devotion to the Constitution and the resulting Union.&quot; The convention agreed with him and formally resolved the Confederate veteran has: &quot;returned to the Union as an equal, and he remains in the Union as a friend. With no humble apologies, no unmanly servility, no petty spite, no sullen treachery, he is a cheerful, frank citizen of the United States, accepting the present, trusting the future, and proud of the past.&quot;

The UCV sponsored &quot;Florida&#x27;s Tribute to the Women of the Confederacy&quot; (1915).

===Reunions===

The national organization assembled annually in a general convention and social reunion presided over by the Commander-in-Chief. These annual reunions served the UCV as an aid in achieving its goals. Convention cities made elaborate preparations and tried to put on bigger events than the previous hosts. The gatherings continued to be held long after the membership peak had passed, and despite fewer veterans surviving, they gradually grew in attendance, length, and splendor. Numerous veterans brought family and friends along, further swelling the crowds. Many Southerners considered the conventions significant social occasions. Perhaps thirty thousand veterans and another fifty thousand visitors attended each of the mid- and late-1890 reunions, and the numbers increased. In 1911, an estimated crowd of 106,000 members and guests crammed into Little Rock, Arkansas—a city of less than one-half that size. Then the passing years began taking a telling toll, and the reunions grew smaller. But still, the meetings continued until, in 1950, at the sixtieth reunion, only one member could attend, 98-year-old Commander-in-Chief James Moore of Selma, Alabama. The following year, 1951, the United Confederate Veterans held its sixty-first and final reunion in Norfolk, Virginia, from May 30 to June 3. Three members attended: William Townsend, John B. Salling, and William Bush. The U.S. Post Office Department issued a 3-cent commemorative stamp in conjunction with that final reunion. The last verified Confederate veteran, Pleasant Crump, died at age 104 on December 31, 1951.

===&quot;The Confederate Veteran&quot;===
In addition to national meetings, another prominent factor contributed to the growth and popularity of the UCV. This monthly magazine became the official UCV organ, the &quot;Confederate Veteran&quot;. Founded as an independent publishing venture in January 1893 by Sumner Archibald Cunningham, the UCV adopted it the following year. Cunningham personally edited the magazine for twenty-one years and bequeathed almost his entire estate to ensure its continuance. The magazine was of very high quality, and circulation was wide. Many veterans penned recollections or articles for publication on its pages. Readership always greatly exceeded circulation because numerous camps and soldiers&#x27; homes received one or two copies for their numerous occupants. For example, an average of 6500 copies were printed per issue during the first year of publication, but Cunningham estimated that fifty thousand people read the twelfth issue.

<doc id="300467" wikidata="Q186910" url="?curid=300467" title="Mogollon Rim">
<text>The Mogollon Rim ( or or ) is a topographical and geological feature cutting across the northern half of the U.S. state of Arizona. It extends approximately , starting in northern Yavapai County and running eastward, ending near the border with New Mexico. It forms the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau in Arizona.

==Description==

The Rim is an escarpment defining the southwestern edge of the Colorado Plateau. Its central and most spectacular portions are characterized by high cliffs of limestone and sandstone, namely the Kaibab Limestone and Coconino Sandstone cliffs. The escarpment was created by erosion and faulting, creating canyons such as Fossil Creek Canyon and Pine Canyon. The name Mogollon comes from Don Juan Ignacio Flores Mogollón, the Spanish Governor of New Mexico from 1712 to 1715.

Much of the land south of the Mogollon Rim lies above sea level, with the escarpment rising to about . Extensive Ponderosa pine forests are found both on the slopes of the Rim and on the plateau to the north. The Mogollon Rim is a major floristic and faunal boundary, with species characteristic of the Rocky Mountains living on the top of the plateau, and species native to the Mexican Sierra Madre Occidental on the slopes below and in the Madrean Sky Islands (high, isolated mountain ranges) further south. 

The Mogollon Rim&#x27;s limestones and sandstones were formed from sediments deposited in the Carboniferous and Permian Periods. Several of the Rim&#x27;s rock formations are also seen on the walls of the Grand Canyon. In many places, the Rim is capped or buried by the extensive basaltic lava flows. 

The uppermost sandstone stratum of the Mogollon Rim, called the Coconino Sandstone, forms white cliffs that sometimes reach several hundred feet high. This formation of the Permian Period is of aeolian (windblown) origin and is one of the thickest sand-dune-derived sandstones on earth. 
Cities and towns near the Mogollon Rim include Payson, Sedona, Show Low, Alpine and Pinetop-Lakeside. The Mogollon Rim is practically bisected by Interstate 17 which runs north-to-south between Flagstaff and Phoenix. 

In June 2002, the eastern portion of the Mogollon Rim was the site of Arizona&#x27;s second-largest wildfire, the Rodeo–Chediski Fire. The Mogollon Rim was also the site of the Dude fire that started on June 25, 1990. This fire grew to cover over and killed six wildland firefighters. Other large fires have burned along the Mogollon Rim since 1990, and the area&#x27;s Ponderosa pine forests remain vulnerable because of past fire-suppression efforts and the buildup of available dry fuel. 

Western novel author Zane Grey built a hunting cabin on the slopes of the Mogollon Rim just northeast of Payson, above Tonto Creek. The cabin was restored by the Phoenix air-conditioning magnate William Goettl during the late 1960s, but it was destroyed by the Dude Fire in 1990.

Louis L&#x27;Amour&#x27;s novel &quot;The Sackett Brand&quot;, set near the Mogollon Rim, includes descriptions of its cliffs.

<doc id="300468" wikidata="Q173633" url="?curid=300468" title="Monica Seles">
<text>Monica Seles (born December 2, 1973) is a Serbian–American former professional tennis player. She was ranked as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s singles by the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA) for 178 weeks (sixth-most of all time), and finished as the year-end No. 1 three times. Seles won 53 WTA Tour-level singles titles, including nine majors: eight as a teenager while representing Yugoslavia and the final one while representing the United States.

A teen phenomenon, Seles became the youngest-ever French Open champion in 1990 at the age of 16. She went on to dominate the women&#x27;s circuit in 1991 and 1992, compiling a total of eight major championships while still a teenager. However, on April 30, 1993, Seles was the victim of an on-court attack when an obsessed fan of Seles&#x27; rival Steffi Graf stabbed Seles in the back with a knife as she was sitting down between games. Seles did not play professional tennis for over two years following the stabbing, struggling with depression and an eating disorder. After returning in 1995, Seles claimed a ninth major championship at the 1996 Australian Open, but was unable to consistently produce her best tennis. She played her last professional match at the 2003 French Open.

Regarded by many as one of the greatest tennis players of all time, Seles was named one of the &quot;30 Legends of Women&#x27;s Tennis: Past, Present and Future&quot; by &quot;Time&quot;. Several players and historians have argued that Seles had the potential to become the most accomplished female player of all time had she not been stabbed. She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2009.

==Early life and career==
Seles was born in Yugoslavia, Novi Sad (Serbia) to an ethnic Hungarian family. Her parents are Ester and Karolj (Eszter and Károly in Hungarian) and she has an older brother, Zoltan (Zoltán in Hungarian). She began playing tennis at age five, coached by her father, a professional cartoonist employed for decades at the &quot;Dnevnik&quot; and &quot;Magyar Szó&quot; newspapers, who drew pictures for her to make her tennis more fun. He is responsible for developing her two-handed style for both the forehand and backhand. Later, her coach was Jelena Genčić. In 1985, at the age of 11, she won the Junior Orange Bowl tournament in Miami, Florida, catching the attention of tennis coach Nick Bollettieri. In early 1986, Seles and her brother Zoltan moved from Yugoslavia to the United States, and Seles enrolled at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy, where she trained for two years and continued to practice until March 1990. Nine months after their arrival at the academy, Seles&#x27; mother and father joined her and Zoltan in Florida.

Seles played her first professional tournament as an amateur in 1988 at age 14. The following year she turned professional on February 13, 1989, and joined the professional tour full-time, winning her first career title at Houston in May 1989, where she beat the soon-to-retire Chris Evert in the final. A month later, Seles reached the semifinals of her first Grand Slam singles tournament at the French Open, losing to then-world no. 1 Graf. Seles finished her first year on the tour ranked world no. 6.

==Tennis career==

===1990–1992===
After a slow start at the beginning of the season, Seles went on a 36-match winning streak and won 6 consecutive tournaments starting in Miami at the Lipton Player&#x27;s Championships. During that winning streak she also won the U.S. Hard Court Championships, the Eckerd Open, the Italian Open, and the Lufthansa Cup in Berlin, Germany (defeating Graf in the final in straight sets). Seles then won her first Grand Slam singles title at the 1990 French Open. Facing world no. 1 Graf in the final, Seles saved four set points in a first-set tiebreaker, which she won 8–6, and went on to take the match in straight sets. In doing so, she became the youngest-ever French Open singles Champion at the age of 16 years, 6 months. Her winning streak was stopped by Zina Garrison at Wimbledon in the quarterfinals, where Seles had a match point before Garrison eventually won 9–7 in the third set. Seles then won the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles title against Martina Navratilova and then defeated Navratilova again in winning the Oakland California tournament, in straight sets. She also won the 1990 year-end Virginia Slims Championships, defeating Gabriela Sabatini in five sets (in the first five-set women&#x27;s match since the 1901 US National Championships), becoming the youngest to ever win the season-ending championships. She finished the year ranked world number 2.

1991 was the first of two years in which Seles dominated the women&#x27;s tour. She started out by winning the Australian Open in January, beating Jana Novotná in the final. In March, she replaced Graf as the world no. 1. She then successfully defended her French Open title, beating the former youngest-ever winner, Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, in the final. Unable to play at Wimbledon, suffering from shin splints, Seles took a six-week break. But she was back in time for the US Open, which she won by beating Martina Navratilova in the final, her third Grand Slam title of the year, to cement her position at the top of the world rankings. She also won the year-end Virginia Slims Championships for the second consecutive time, defeating Navratilova in four sets. At the end of season, Seles had won 10 out of the 16 tournaments she entered (reaching the final of every tournament that she entered that year). She ended the year as the no. 1 ranked player in the world.
1992 was an equally dominant year. Seles successfully defended her titles at the Australian Open, the French Open, and the US Open. She also reached her first-ever final at Wimbledon, but lost to Graf. During Wimbledon, Seles encountered difficulty because of her habit of grunting or shrieking loudly when hitting shots. Her quarterfinal opponent Nathalie Tauziat was the first to complain to the chair umpire about it. During the third set of her semi-final match against Martina Navratilova, Navratilova also complained to the chair umpire about the grunting after Seles went up a break at 4–2. Seles ended up losing the game and the break, but broke back and closed out the match.

From January 1991 through February 1993, Seles won 22 titles and reached 33 finals out of the 34 tournaments she played. She compiled a 159–12 win–loss record (92.9% winning percentage), including a 55–1 win–loss record (98%) in Grand Slam tournaments. In the broader context of her first four years on the circuit (1989–1992), Seles had a win–loss record of 231–25 (90.2%) and collected 30 titles. She once again ended the year as the #1 ranked player in the world.

===1993 stabbing attack===
Seles was the top-ranked women&#x27;s player heading into 1993, having won the French Open for three consecutive years and both the US Open and Australian Open in consecutive years. In January 1993, Seles defeated Graf in the final of the Australian Open, which, at that time, was her third win in four Grand Slam finals against Graf. She then won the Virginia Slims of Chicago over Martina Navratilova in three sets. This was the last title that Seles won before the attack in Hamburg, Germany.

On April 30, 1993, during a quarterfinal match against Magdalena Maleeva at the Citizen Cup in Hamburg, Germany, a German man named Günter Parche, an obsessed fan of Seles&#x27;s rival Graf, ran from the middle of the crowd to the edge of the court during a break between games and stabbed Seles with a boning knife between her shoulder blades, to a depth of . She was quickly taken to a hospital. Her physical injuries took several weeks to heal, but she stayed away from competitive tennis for more than two years. Initially, there was speculation that the attack might have been politically motivated because Seles was from Yugoslavia. She was known to have received death threats in relation to the Yugoslav Wars. However, German authorities were quick to rule this out, describing her attacker as confused and possibly mentally disturbed. According to police, Parche intended to severely injure Seles so that she would be unable to play tennis and Graf would become the world No. 1 player again.

Parche was charged following the incident, but spent less than 6 months in pre-trial detention. In his trial, he was found to be psychologically abnormal, and was sentenced to two years&#x27; probation and psychological treatment. The incident prompted a significant increase in the level of security at tennis tour events. At that year&#x27;s Wimbledon, the players&#x27; seats were positioned with their backs to the umpire&#x27;s chair, rather than the spectators. Seles, however, disputed the effectiveness of these measures. She was quoted in 2011 as saying, &quot;From the time I was stabbed, I think the security hasn&#x27;t changed&quot;. Seles vowed never to play tennis in Germany again, disenchanted by the German legal system. &quot;What people seem to be forgetting is that this man stabbed me intentionally and he did not serve any sort of punishment for it ... I would not feel comfortable going back. I don&#x27;t foresee that happening.&quot; In a later article, &quot;Tennis&quot; reported that Parche was living in nursing homes due to additional health problems. He died in a nursing home in August 2022 at the age of 68.

Graf visited Seles while she was hospitalized. Young Elders, a band from Melbourne, Australia, sent their song called &quot;Fly Monica Fly&quot; to Seles while she was recuperating from the stabbing incident. She later said that the song provided inspiration to her at that time, and subsequently met the band (who later changed their name to the Monicas) following her victory at the Australian Open in 1996. The stabbing incident is the subject of Dan Bern&#x27;s 1998 tribute to Seles, &quot;Monica&quot;. Additionally, American band Majesty Crush paid tribute with &quot;Seles&quot; from the 1993 album &quot;Love-15&quot;.

The WTA suggested that Seles&#x27;s No. 1 ranking be preserved due to her absence from the stabbing, but the ranking was ultimately not preserved. A vote was held at a tournament in Rome in 1993, and 16 of the 17 top players who voted rejected the proposal – Graf did not participate in the tournament and was thus absent from voting. Of those who did vote, only Gabriela Sabatini, who abstained, did not reject the idea of freezing Seles&#x27;s ranking until her return. Seles did not play tennis for two years and suffered from depression as well as an eating disorder as a result of the attack.

===Comeback===
After becoming a U.S. citizen in 1994, Seles returned to the tour in August 1995. In the run-up to her comeback, then-WTA president Martina Navratilova proposed that Seles be reinstated alongside Graf as joint number one. The WTA did so despite some opposition from players including Arantxa Sánchez Vicario and Gigi Fernández, whose tournament placements would suffer greatly by suddenly being placed behind Seles. Graf supported Seles&#x27; co-ranking, but not the additional proposal that Seles&#x27; co-ranking not be determined by the minimum participation of 12 tournaments a year required of everyone else. Graf felt that would give Seles an unfair advantage in the rankings. Seles won her first comeback tournament, the Canadian Open, beating Amanda Coetzer in the final and setting a tournament record for the fewest games dropped by the champion throughout the tournament (14).

The following month at the US Open, Seles reached the final defeating world No.10 Anke Huber, No. 4 Jana Novotná, and No. 3 Conchita Martínez (all in straight sets), but lost to Graf in the final.

In January 1996, Seles won her fourth Australian Open, beating Anke Huber in the final. Her pivotal match was the semifinal vs rising American star Chanda Rubin who led her 5–2 in the final set, and had two break points to lead 5–1. Seles came back from two points from defeat to triumph and reach the final. This was to be Seles&#x27; last Grand Slam title, as she struggled to recapture her best form on a consistent basis. Seles was the runner-up at the US Open to Graf again in 1996. Seles&#x27; last Grand Slam final came at the French Open in 1998, just a few weeks after the death of her father and former coach, Karolj, from cancer. In the run to the final she had defeated world no. 3 Jana Novotná in three sets and world no. 1 Martina Hingis in straight sets, but lost to Sánchez Vicario in the three-set final.

While she did not reach another Grand Slam singles final, she did consistently reach the quarterfinal and semifinal stages in those tournaments and was a fixture in the WTA Tour&#x27;s top 10. In 2002, her last full year on the tour, she finished the year ranked world no. 7, defeated Venus Williams, Martina Hingis, Jennifer Capriati, Justine Henin, Maria Sharapova, Kim Clijsters, and Lindsay Davenport, and reached at least the quarterfinals at each Grand Slam tournament.

Seles competed at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, where she beat Sabatini in a third round match before losing to Jana Novotná in the quarterfinals. Four years later, at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Seles captured her first Olympic medal, a bronze in singles. She defeated Jelena Dokic in the bronze medal match, after pushing eventual gold medalist Venus Williams to a tough three setter in the semis, losing 6–3 in the final set.

Seles helped the U.S. team win the Fed Cup in 1996, 1999, and 2000.

===Hiatus and retirement===

In the spring of 2003, Seles sustained a foot injury. She was forced to withdraw during the second set of a match against Nadia Petrova at the Italian Open. Then, a couple of weeks later and still injured, she lost in straight sets to the same player in the first round of the 2003 French Open. It was the only time she ever lost a first-round match at a Grand Slam. She never again played an official tour match.

In February 2005, Seles played two exhibition matches in New Zealand against Navratilova. Despite losing both matches, she played competitively and announced that she could return to the game early in 2006; however, she did not do so. She played three exhibition matches against Navratilova in 2007. On April 5, she defeated Navratilova in Houston, Texas on clay. On September 14, Seles defeated Navratilova on an indoor court in New Orleans On September 16, she beat her on clay in Bucharest.

In December 2007, Seles told the press that Lindsay Davenport&#x27;s successful return to the tour had inspired her to consider her own limited comeback to play Grand Slam tournaments and the major warm-up events for those tournaments. However, on February 14, 2008, Seles announced her official retirement from professional tennis.
In January 2009, Seles was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

===Assessment===

Seles is widely regarded as one of the great tennis players of all time. In 2012, Tennis Channel created a list of the 100 greatest tennis players. Seles was listed at #19.

Seles won eight Grand Slam titles during her teenage years. However, her career was greatly affected by the stabbing incident. Some involved with the sport have declared that Seles could have become the most accomplished female player ever. In an article written 20 years after Seles was stabbed, Jonathan Scott of &quot;Tennis.com&quot; stated, &quot;Would Monica Seles have been the greatest female tennis player ever? The world will never know.&quot; In a 2013 interview, Martina Navratilova theorized that if Seles had not been stabbed, &quot;We&#x27;d be talking about Monica with the most Grand Slam titles [ahead of] Margaret Court or Steffi Graf.&quot; Mary Joe Fernandez declared that Seles would have at least doubled her Grand Slam championship tally, had she not been attacked. Tim Adams of &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that Seles would have become &quot;the greatest female tennis player ever to pick up a racket.&quot;

During the height of her career (the 1990 French Open through the 1993 Australian Open), she won eight of the 11 Grand Slam singles tournaments she contested. With eight Grand Slam singles titles before her 20th birthday, Seles holds the record for most Grand Slam singles titles won as a teenager in the Open Era.

Until her loss to Martina Hingis at the 1999 Australian Open, Seles had a perfect record at the event (33–0), which is the longest undefeated streak for this tournament (although Margaret Court won 38 consecutive matches there from 1960 to 1968 after losing a match in 1959). It also marked her first defeat in Australia, having won the Sydney tournament in 1996.

Seles was the first female tennis player to win her first six Grand Slam singles finals: 1990 French Open, 1991 Australian Open, 1991 French Open, 1991 US Open, 1992 Australian Open, and 1992 French Open. Seles was also the first female player since Hilde Krahwinkel Sperling in 1937 to win the women&#x27;s singles title three consecutive years at the French Open, a feat subsequently achieved by Justine Henin in 2005–7. (Also, Chris Evert won the title in four consecutive appearances in 1974, 1975, 1979, and 1980).

Shortly after her retirement, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Jon Wertheim stated:
She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame on July 11, 2009. In 2011, Seles was named one of the &quot;30 Legends of Women&#x27;s Tennis: Past, Present and Future&quot; by &quot;Time&quot;.

==Playing style==
Seles was a baseline player who was known for her power-based, highly aggressive playing style. Her unconventional double-handed forehand and backhand were both hit flat, with relentless speed, power, and depth. As a result of her two-handed groundstrokes, she could create sharp angles around the court, and hit winners at will. She was an aggressive return player, and would stand within the baseline to return serves. Further strengths included her fitness, speed, and court coverage, allowing her to be an excellent retriever, and hit winners from any position on the court. Prior to her stabbing, Seles&#x27; greatest strengths were her powerful groundstrokes and mental toughness, with her being described as one of the toughest players to beat on the WTA tour. Seles was also known for accompanying her shots with loud grunting, and was frequently criticized for doing so. Due to her aggressive power game, she is considered one of the inspirations for modern WTA players such as Serena and Venus Williams, Maria Sharapova, and Victoria Azarenka.

==Coaches, equipment and endorsements==

Seles had many coaches through the years. These included: Karoly Seleš (1979–1996), Jelena Genčić (1980–1986), Nick Bollettieri (1986–1990), Sven Groeneveld (1991–1992), Gavin Hopper (1997–1998), Bobby Banck (1999–2001), Mike Sell (2001–2002), and David Nainkin (2003).

In the early 1990s, Seles signed a $4-million endorsement contract with Fila to promote its footwear and tennis apparel. She used a Prince original graphite racquet on court. In August of the 1990 season, Seles switched to a Yonex racquet.

When she returned to the tour in 1995 after the stabbing, Seles wore apparel by Nike and used a Yonex racquet on court.

In the 2000s, Seles wore apparel by Yonex and used Yonex SRQ Ti-800 Pro Long racquet on court.

==Personal life==
Seles was born and raised in Novi Sad, Yugoslavia (now Serbia) to an ethnic Hungarian family. She became a naturalized American citizen in 1994, and she received Hungarian citizenship in June 2007.

On April 21, 2009, Seles released her memoir &quot;Getting A Grip: On My Body, My Mind, My Self&quot;, which chronicles her bout with depression and binge eating disorder (BED) after her stabbing, her father&#x27;s cancer diagnosis and eventual death, her journey back to the game, and a life beyond tennis.

Seles is married to businessman Tom Golisano, who is 32 years her senior. They began dating in 2009. The two announced their engagement on June 5, 2014.

As of 2015, Seles is a paid spokesperson for Shire Pharmaceuticals, the makers of the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat binge eating disorder, to raise awareness of the disorder she has suffered from since she was a young adult. Seles would eat normal amounts of food at meals, and then secretly eat large amounts of junk food when she was alone.

She received the honorary citizenship of Novi Sad in 1993.

==In popular culture==
In 1993, &quot;Seinfeld&quot; featured an episode (&quot;The Lip Reader&quot;) in which the creators fictionalized Seles&#x27;s return to the US Open after her stabbing. In 1996, Seles made a guest appearance in the TV sitcom &quot;The Nanny&quot;. She also appeared on the TV series &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; in 2008 as one of the contestants.

<text>Mach bands is an optical illusion named after the physicist Ernst Mach. It exaggerates the contrast between edges of the slightly differing shades of gray, as soon as they contact one another, by triggering edge-detection in the human visual system. The Mach band illusion is sometimes called the Chevreul illusion.

==Explanation==
The Mach bands effect is due to the spatial high-boost filtering performed by the human visual system on the luminance channel of the image captured by the retina. Mach reported the effect in 1865, conjecturing that filtering is performed in the retina itself, by lateral inhibition among its neurons. This conjecture is supported by observations on other (non-visual) senses, as pointed out by Georg von Békésy. The visual pattern is often found on curved surfaces subject to a particular, naturally-occurring illumination, so the occurrence of filtering can be explained as the result of learnt image statistics. The effect of filtering can be modeled as a convolution between a trapezoidal function that describes the illumination and one or more bandpass filters. A tight approximation is obtained by a model employing 9 even-symmetric filters scaled at octave intervals.

The effect is independent of the orientation of the boundary.

==In radiology==

This visual phenomenon is important to keep in mind when evaluating dental radiographs for evidence of decay, in which grayscale images of teeth and bone are analyzed for abnormal variances of density. A false-positive radiological diagnosis of dental caries can easily arise if the practitioner does not take into account the likelihood of this illusion. Mach bands manifest adjacent to metal restorations or appliances and the boundary between enamel and dentin. Mach bands may also result in the misdiagnosis of horizontal root fractures because of the differing radiographic intensities of tooth and bone.

Mach effect can also lead to an erroneous diagnosis of pneumothorax by creating a dark line at the lung periphery (whereas a true pneumothorax will have a white pleural line).

==In computer graphics==

Mach bands can also appear when there is a discontinuity in the derivative of a gradient, a visual effect common when intensities are linearly interpolated such as in Gouraud shading.

Computer image processing systems use edge-detection in a way analogous to the brain, using unsharp masking to clarify edges in photos for example.

<doc id="300472" wikidata="Q197162" url="?curid=300472" title="Zhang Binglin">
<text>Zhang Binglin (January 12, 1869 – June 14, 1936), also known by his art name Zhang Taiyan, was a Chinese philologist, textual critic, philosopher, and revolutionary.

His philological works include &quot;Wen Shi&quot; (文始 &quot;The Origin of Writing&quot;), the first systematic work of Chinese etymology. He also made contributions to historical Chinese phonology, proposing that &quot;the &quot;niang&quot; (娘) and &quot;ri&quot; (日) initials [in Middle Chinese] come from the &quot;ni&quot; (泥) initial [in Old Chinese]&quot; (known as &quot;niang ri gui ni&quot; 娘日歸泥). He developed a system of shorthand based on the seal script, called &quot;jiyin zimu&quot; (記音字母), later adopted as the basis of zhuyin. Though innovative in many ways, he was skeptical of new archaeological findings, regarding the oracle bones as forgery.

An activist as well as a scholar, he produced many political works. Because of his outspoken character, he was jailed for three years by the Qing Empire and put under house arrest for another three by Yuan Shikai.

==Life==
Zhang was born with the given name Xuecheng (學乘) in Yuhang (now a district in Hangzhou), Zhejiang to a scholarly family. In 1901, to demonstrate his hatred of the Manchu rulers of the Qing state, he changed his name to ‘Taiyan’ after two scholars who had resisted the Qing takeover 250 years before: ‘Tai’ came from Taichong, the pen name of Huang Zongxi, and ‘Yan’ from Gu Yanwu.

When he was 23, he began to study under the great philologist Yu Yue (1821–1907), immersing himself in the Chinese classics for seven years.

After the First Sino-Japanese War, he went to Shanghai, becoming a member of the Society for National Strengthening (強學會) and writing for a number of newspapers, including Liang Qichao&#x27;s &quot;Shi Wu Bao&quot; (時務報). In September 1898, after the failure of the Wuxu Reform, Zhang escaped to Taiwan with the help of a Japanese friend and worked as a reporter for and wrote for &quot;Qing Yi Bao&quot; (清議報) produced in Japan by Liang Qichao.

In May of the following year, Zhang went to Japan and was introduced to Sun Yat-sen by Liang Qichao. He returned to China two months later to be a reporter for the Shanghai-based &quot;Yadong Shibao&quot; (亞東時報). His most important political work, &quot;Qiu Shu&quot; (訄書) was published in 1900–1 and then in a substantially revised edition in 1904.

In 1901, under the threat of arrest from the Qing Empire, Zhang taught at Soochow University for a year before he escaped to Japan for several months. Upon return, he was arrested and jailed for three years until June 1906. He began to study the Buddhist scriptures during his time in jail.

After his release, Zhang went to Japan to join Tongmeng Hui and became the chief editor of the newspaper &quot;Min Bao&quot; (民報) which strongly criticized the Qing Empire&#x27;s corruption. There, he also lectured on the Chinese classics and philology for overseas Chinese students. His students in Japan include Lu Xun, Zhou Zuoren and Qian Xuantong. His most important student was Huang Kan. In 1908, &quot;Min Bao&quot; was banned by the Japanese government. This caused Zhang to focus on his philological research. He coined the phrase &quot;Zhonghua Minguo&quot; (中華民國, literally &quot;Chinese People&#x27;s State&quot;) which became the Chinese name of the Republic of China.

Because of an ideological conflict with Sun Yat-sen and his Three Principles of the People, Zhang established the Tokyo branch of Guangfu Hui in February 1909.

After the Wuchang Uprising, Zhang returned to China to establish the Republic of China Alliance (中華民國聯合會) and chief-edit the &quot;Dagonghe Ribao&quot; (大共和日報).

After Yuan Shikai became the President of the Republic of China in 1913, Zhang was his high-ranking advisor for a few months until the assassination of Song Jiaoren. After criticizing Yuan for possible responsibility of the assassination, Zhang was put under house arrest, in Beijing&#x27;s Longquan Temple, until Yuan&#x27;s death in 1916. After release, Zhang was appointed Minister of the Guangzhou Generalissimo (大元帥府秘書長) in June 1917.

In 1924, Zhang left the Kuomintang, entitled himself a loyalist to the Republic of China, and became critical of Chiang Kai-shek. Zhang established the National Studies Society (國學講習會) in Suzhou in 1934 and chief-edited the magazine &quot;Zhi Yan&quot; (制言).

He died two years later at 67 and was buried in a state funeral. On April 3, 1955, the People&#x27;s Republic of China moved his coffin from Suzhou to Nanping Mountain, Hangzhou. The People&#x27;s Republic established a museum devoted to him beside the West Lake.

He had three daughters with his first wife. With Cai Yuanpei as witness, he married again in 1913, with Tang Guoli (湯國梨), an early Chinese feminist. They had two sons, Zhang Dao (章導) and Zhang Qi (章奇).

==Philosophical beginnings==
Originally, Zhang Binglin was firmly rooted in &quot;Old Text&quot; philology, which emphasized &quot;the diversity of China&#x27;s intellectual heritage led to a serious erosion of the paramount position of Confucius as upheld by the unwavering guardians of orthodoxy&quot; (Kurtz 302). Zhang shared the views of his contemporary, Liu Yiqing, that the Confucian classics should be read as history, not sacred scripture. However, he firmly rejected Liu&#x27;s suggestion to put Chinese intellectual heritage into the matrix of Western philosophy. Joachim Kurtz writes: Zhang Binglin did not oppose radical reconceptualizations per se but only those that uncritically mirrored European taxonomies. Rather than squeezing ancient Chinese texts and concepts into a Western-derived disciplinary corset, Zhang suggested expanding existing categories in such a way as to make space for the new knowledge that the nation, as he readily agreed, so desperately needed.

Zhang replaced conventional sense of &quot;mingjia&quot; (which was the name of one of the nine philosophical schools pre-Qin) with a new understanding—the methodology of debate similar to European logic and Buddhist dialectic.

Zhang&#x27;s thoughts on religion went through multiple phases. Originally, in his pre-imprisonment days, he was highly critical of religion, and wrote several essays that criticized religious concepts: &quot;Looking at Heaven&quot;, &quot;The Truth about Confucianism&quot;, and &quot;On Bacteria&quot;. In these essays, he emphasized that the scientific world could be reconciled with classical Chinese philosophy. However, his thoughts on religion significantly changed following his imprisonment.

===Imprisonment (1903–1906)===
Zhang&#x27;s interest and studies in Buddhism only became serious during the three years he spent in prison for &quot;publishing anti-Manchu propaganda and insulting the Qing emperor as a &#x27;buffoon&#x27; in 1903&quot;. During this time, he read the Yogacara-bhumi, the basic texts of &quot;Weishi&quot; &quot;Consciousness Only&quot; school, and the foundational work of Chinese Buddhist logic (the Nyayapravesa). These texts were given to him by members of the Chinese Society of Education (&quot;Zhongguo jiaoyuhui&quot;). He later claimed that &quot;it was only through reciting and meditating on these sutras that he was able to get through his difficult jail experience&quot;. His experiences with Buddhist philosophical texts gave him a framework to reassess the significance of his pain and suffering and view it in a different light. In 1906, after he was released from prison, Zhang went to Japan to edit &quot;The People&#x27;s Journal&quot; (&quot;Minbao&quot;) and developed a new philosophical framework that critiqued the dominant intellectual trend of modernization theory.

He emerged from jail as devout Yogacarin. His attitude towards religion—namely Buddhism—changed after his time spent in prison. This is made apparent in &quot;Zhang Taiyan&#x27;s Notes on Reading Buddhist Texts&quot;, in which he is concerned with the concepts of &quot;freedom, constraints, sadness, and happiness&quot;. After 1906, Buddhist terms became more prevalent in his writing, especially in his interpretation of Zhuangzi&#x27;s &quot;Discourse on Making Things Equal&quot;.

===Time in Japan (1906–1910)===

Zhang was further exposed to Yogacara Buddhism during his time in Japan (1906–1910), when he was actively involved in nationalist, anti-Manchu politics. During his time there, he edited the Tokyo-based &quot;The People&#x27;s Journal&quot; (&quot;Minbao&quot;), where he first expressed a &quot;Buddhist voice&quot;. While he was in Japan, he joined Tong Meng Hui, a party that was primarily made up of anti-Manchu exiles (including Sun Yat-sen) seeking the cultural and political regeneration of China.

His 1907 text &quot;The Five Negations&quot; denounced how European economies &quot;exhaust their own enterprises&quot; and &quot;extinguish the fertility of the land.&quot;

Upon his return to China, Zhang worked on the commission &quot;convened by the new Nationalist government&#x27;s Ministry of Education in 1913 to establish a national language and helped develop the Chinese phonetic symbol system still used today in Taiwan, among other places.&quot;

The terminology used by Zhang is not common in earlier Chinese philosophical discussions of symbol, language, and the sacred—before the 20th century, Chinese philosophical texts were in classical Chinese (&quot;wenyanwen&quot;), which uses monosyllabic style. The vernacular (&quot;baihua&quot;) began to be more commonly used after the May 4th Movement in 1919. Compound words like &quot;yuyen&quot; were rarely used in pre-20th-century Chinese writings. Zhang was exposed to these linguistic approaches during his time in Japan following his imprisonment.

==Yogacara and Zhang==

=== Zhang’s Buddhist–Daoist approach to history ===
In a time when most Chinese intellectuals favored modernization ideologies and endorsed history as a progressive movement, Zhang Taiyan (Binglin) drew on Buddhism and Daoism to express his critiques. Social and intellectual life during the Qing dynasty was primarily influenced by &quot;widely circulating discourses of modern philosophy and the concrete forces of the global capitalist system of nation-states&quot;. Following a string of defeats in the late 19th century, Chinese intellectuals began to focus on how China could be improved in order to compete in the global capitalist system. This marked a clear departure from previous Chinese thought, which had primarily focused on the teachings of traditional classical Chinese texts. This was thought to effectively prepare bureaucrats for their positions in the imperial government. However, a national crisis—the loss of several armed conflicts—spurred Chinese philosophers towards modernization thinking. Zhang was particularly revolutionary, as he &quot;mobilized Buddhism for politics&quot; and combined elements of Yogacara Buddhist thought with concepts he had developed himself in his pre-revolutionary years.

Zhang understood the conditions of possibility as described by Immanuel Kant in Buddhist terms, namely, &quot;as the karmic fluctuations of the seeds in &quot;alaya&quot; consciousness (the storehouse consciousness)”. 
He viewed history as an “unconscious process of drives”. The storehouse consciousness, which is defined as the highest level of consciousness, contains seeds that initiate historical process. He believed that &quot;karmic experiences develop from unseen roots, which stem from seeds. As we act in these experiences, we unconsciously plant new karmic seeds and so a cycle of the interplay between past, present and future continues&quot;. In his essay &quot;On Separating the Universal and Particular in Evolution&quot;, Zhang utilizes this framework to explain Hegel&#x27;s philosophy of history. What Hegel describes as &quot;a triumphant march of spirit&quot; is actually &quot;a degenerative disaster created by karmic seeds&quot; according to Zhang.

===Yogacara Buddhism and Chinese philosophy===
Yogacara (or &quot;Weishi&quot;) primarily focuses on cognitive processes that could be used to overcome ignorance that prevented one from escaping the karmic rounds of birth and death. Practicers/proponents of Yogacara stress attention to the issues of cognition, consciousness, perception, and epistemology. Yogacara Buddhism is based on the following concepts: three self-natures, storehouse consciousness, overturning the basis, and the theory of eight consciousnesses.

Zhang viewed the teachings and principles of Yogacara as &quot;a sophisticated knowledge system which could serve as an authoritative alternative to the knowledge systems being introduced from the West.&quot;

Yogacara focuses on meditative practice, epistemology and logic. This strain of Buddhism ceased to be popular in China by the time period of the Yuan dynasty (1206–1368). Yogacara principles and writings were reintroduced to China during the 19th century from Japan, where they had been flourishing for centuries. This revival was primarily led by Liang Qichao, Yang Wenhui, Tan Sitong, Zhang Taiyan and many other prominent intellectuals of the late Qing period.

Yogacara was popular with the intellectuals of this period because it was characterized by structured and organized thoughts and concepts. Zhang found &quot;Weishi&quot; easy to understand “because it was essentially concerned with &quot;mingxiang&quot; (definitions of terms), matters in which he had been well grounded due to his rigorous training in the evidential learning techniques associated with Han Learning approaches to Classical Studies (&quot;jingxue&quot;).”

Zhang wrote: There is good reason for my singular respect for faxiang (an alternate name for Weishi). Modern scholarship [in China] has gradually followed the path of &#x27;seeking verification in actual events.&#x27; Of course the detailed analysis carried out by Han Learning scholars was far superior to that which scholars in the Ming were able to achieve. With the beginnings of science [introduced in China in the late-nineteenth century] scholars applied themselves with even greater precision. It is for this reason that faxiang learning was inappropriate to the situation in China during the Ming but most appropriate in modern times. This was brought about by the trends that have informed the development of scholarship.

Zhang wanted to promote Yogacara Buddhism as a philosophy, not a religion. Buddhism was thought to be a form of scientific philosophy superior to religion, science and philosophy. Zhang based his philosophical vision on the doctrine of three natures. He believed that the third nature—the nature of existence being perfectly accomplished—was suitable to serve as the foundation for Chinese philosophy and religion. Zhang was not the only one who believed this—the late Qing discussion of religion became a philosophical project designed to modernize China so it could compete &quot;as a nation-state in an increasingly rationalized and reified world.&quot; He used this belief to critique Western philosophers Kant, Hegel and Plato, who he felt only represented the first and second doctrines of Yogacara.

Zhang felt that &quot;yinming&quot;, or the knowledge of reasons, enabled people to recover the true meaning of Mohist and Confucian tests in ways that Western philosophy could not. Zhang&#x27;s decision to frame his comparative inquiry in terms of &quot;yinming&quot; demonstrates his belief in &quot;yinming&quot; as a more effective &#x27;art of reasoning&#x27; than either the &#x27;Mohist Canons&#x27; or European logic. In his essay &quot;Discussion on the Equalization of Things&quot;, Zhang uses Yogacara Buddhist concepts to make sense of Zhuangzi, an ancient Daoist philosopher. He claims that Zhuangzi&#x27;s notion of equality entails making distinctions without the use of concepts: &#x27;Equalizing things’ (&quot;qiwuzhe&quot;) refers to absolute equality (&quot;pingdeng&quot;). If we look at its meaning carefully, it does not simply refer to seeing sentient beings as equal...One must speak form (xiang, laksana) without words, write of form without concepts (ming) and think form without mind. It is ultimate equality. This accords with the &#x27;equalization of things.&#x27;

Zhang tried to render equality without contradiction between the particular and the universal. Zhang believed that conceptual framework is generated through our karmic actions. When compared to his contemporary Liu Shipei&#x27;s attempt to extract logic from the masters of the Zhou dynasty, Zhang&#x27;s writings and thoughts display a higher level of theoretical sophistication as he had a firmer grasp of the purposes and limitations of European logic as well as knowledge of &quot;yinming&quot; principles and thinking. This enabled him to draw more convincing parallels between the notions he gleaned from his plethora of sources.

==Legacy==
Intellectual historian Joachim Kurtz argues that Zhang&#x27;s most important contribution to the field of Chinese philosophy was &quot;to show that it was possible, at least on an elementary level, to assert the validity of a &#x27;traditional&#x27;, namely Chinese Buddhist conceptual framework while simultaneously redefining individual notions, such as the boundaries of the logical realm, in accordance with a Western-derived understanding&quot;.

Zhang continues to be viewed as an important intellectual figure in modern China in part because of his call for dissociate ideas of sovereign power from Heaven&#x27;s Mandate and to instead associate it with political realism and human capacity.

<doc id="300481" wikidata="Q5483197" url="?curid=300481" title="Francisco Bojado">
<text>Francisco Bojado (born 11 May 1983) is a Mexican former professional boxer who competed from 2001 to 2007. As an amateur, he competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Francisco is also the brother of amateur boxer, Angel Bojado.

==Amateur career==
He compiled an amateur record of 168–15 and represented Mexico at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.

Francisco lost in the second qualifying round at the games. He returned home with his eyes set on turning professional. Shortly after, he was signed by Shelly Finkel, a man who also managed Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson, among many others. Finkel soon helped Bojado sign a multi-fight deal with cable television channel Showtime.

==Professional career==
On January 13, 2001, he made his professional debut by beating Derrick Castor by knockout in the second round in Uncasville, Connecticut. He followed that victory with eight more knockout wins, including wins over veterans Mauro Lucero, Glenn Forde and Eleazar Contreras. But on February 16, 2002, also in Uncasville, he was upset by Juan Carlos Rubio, who beat him by a ten-round decision. He would later avenge the loss to Rubio, by 12-round decision.

On January 24, 2004, Francisco defeated experienced Emmanuel Clottey in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

On July 24, however, he suffered another setback, when former world Jr. Lightweight champion Jesse James Leija beat him by a split ten-round decision. He walked away from the sport following the loss.

In April 2007, Bojado signed a deal with promotional company Golden Boy Promotions, and made his return to the ring on May 4, 2007, against Dairo Esalas at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Bojado won a unanimous decision.

On October 6, 2007, Stephen Forbes won a split-decision upset over Bojado in a junior welterweight bout.

==Outside the ring==
Bojado made an appearance on the HBO short series De La Hoya/Mayweather 24/7 as a sparring partner for Oscar De La Hoya.

Bojado was arrested in 2011 after allegedly failing to stop at US Border security, which resulted in shots being fired at him by police.

In 2013 Bojado got back into the ring and started training.

<doc id="300489" wikidata="Q282971" url="?curid=300489" title="Marooning">
<text>Marooning is the intentional act of abandoning someone in an uninhabited area, such as a desert island, or more generally (usually in passive voice) to be marooned is to be in a place from which one cannot escape. The word is attested in 1699, and is derived from the term maroon, a word for a fugitive slave, which could be a corruption of Spanish &quot;&quot; (rendered as &quot;symeron&quot; in 16th–17th century English), meaning a household animal (or slave) who has &quot;run wild&quot;. &quot;Cimarrón&quot; in turn may be derived from the Taino word &quot;símaran&quot; (“wild”) (like a stray arrow), from &quot;símara&quot; (“arrow”).

The practice was a penalty for crewmen, or for captains at the hands of a crew in cases of mutiny. Generally, a marooned man was set on a deserted island, often no more than a sand bar at low tide. He would be given some food, a container of water, and a loaded pistol so he could die by suicide if he desired. The outcome of marooning was usually fatal, but survival was possible if the condemned could obtain a means of escape, as in the case of pirate Edward England.

The chief practitioners of marooning were 17th and 18th century pirates, to such a degree that they were frequently referred to as &quot;marooners&quot;. The pirate articles of captains Bartholomew Roberts and John Phillips specify marooning as a punishment for cheating one&#x27;s fellow pirates or other offences. In this context, to be marooned is euphemistically to be &quot;made governor of an island&quot;.

During the late 18th century in the southern United States, &quot;marooning&quot; took on a humorous additional meaning describing an extended camping-out picnic over a period of several days.

== Famous maroonings ==

* 1520: Juan de Cartagena and Pedro Sánchez de la Reina
* 1542: Marguerite de La Rocque, rescued in 1544 (two others died)
* 1629: Wouter Loos and Jan Pelgrom de Bye, from &quot;Batavia&quot;
* 1704: Alexander Selkirk, rescued in 1709, another source for Robinson Crusoe
* 1725: Leendert Hasenbosch, a Dutch sailor, was marooned on the deserted Ascension Island in 1725 as a punishment for sodomy. He is believed to have died there of thirst later that year. In 1726, his tent and diary were discovered by passing British sailors, and his diary was later translated and published in London.
* 1807: Robert Jeffrey, rescued eight days later. Captain Warwick Lake of &quot;Recruit&quot; marooned an impressed seaman, Robert Jeffrey, on Sombrero island on 13 December 1807. Eight days later, a passing American vessel, the schooner &quot;Adams&quot; from Marblehead, Massachusetts, rescued him. A court-martial later dismissed Lake from the Royal Navy.

==In literature==

The most famous literary reference to marooning probably occurs in Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot; in which Ben Gunn is left marooned on the island for three years.

A famous real-life marooning, initially at his own request, was that of the sailor Alexander Selkirk on Juan Fernández Island off the coast of Chile, in the Pacific Ocean. Selkirk, a sailor with the Dampier expedition, was worried about the unseaworthy condition of his ship, the &quot;Cinque Ports&quot;, and had argued with the captain until he left Selkirk ashore on the island where they had briefly stopped for water and food supplies. The &quot;Cinque Ports&quot; indeed later sank with the loss of most of her crew. Selkirk was not rescued until four years later, by Woodes Rogers. Selkirk&#x27;s travails provided part of the inspiration for Daniel Defoe&#x27;s novel &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;. Today there are islands off the Chilean coast named Alejandro Selkirk Island and Robinson Crusoe Island.

==In television==
In 2012, Ed Stafford marooned himself on an uninhabited island off Fiji as an experiment for 60 days. He took with him no food, water, or equipment of any kind, except cameras to film the ordeal for Discovery Channel. Stafford completed the task and documents the psychological repercussions in his book &quot;Naked and Marooned&quot;.

<text>The Pimería Alta (translated to &#x27;Upper Pima Land&#x27;/&#x27;Land of the Upper Pima&#x27; in English) was an area of the 18th century Sonora y Sinaloa Province in the Viceroyalty of New Spain, that encompassed parts of what are today southern Arizona in the United States and northern Sonora in Mexico.

The area took its name from the Pima and closely related O&#x27;odham (&quot;Papago&quot;) peoples residing in the Sonoran Desert. Pimería Alta was the site of the Spanish missions in the Sonoran Desert established by the Jesuit missionary Eusebio Kino in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. A significant Pima rebellion against Spanish rule occurred in 1751.

== Terminology ==
The term Pimería Alta first appeared in Spanish colonial documents (especially produced by those in the Catholic Church) to designate an ethno-territorial expanse that spanned much of what is now southern Arizona and northern Sonora. The term derives from the name of the Pima indigenous peoples native to the region. This term, along with the term ‘Pimería Baja’, was a designation used by the Spanish in the Viceroyalty of New Spain to create a geographic distinction between where the different dialects of the Pima language were spoken. While the region was not a political entity, its geographic contours have been described as:

== Pre-contact history ==
Before the first Spanish incursions into the region in the late 17th century, what would come to be the Pimería Alta was home to a diverse array of indigenous tribes. Upon the arrival of the Spaniards, these tribes included:
Even prior to the settlement of these groups in what would come to be the Pimería Alta, humans had settled in the region more than three thousand years before. According to archaeological records, settlements and irrigation canals have been found in the river valleys of the region as far back as 2100 BC. Groups such as the Hohokam, widely considered to be the ancestors of the O’odham, would inhabit the region from approximately AD 500 to AD 1450. While each indigenous group native to the Pimería Alta had its own cultural idiosyncrasies, it can be generalized that those residing in the region were mostly semi-nomadic, relied on crops such as beans, squash and maize to subsist in addition to wild native plants, and were master artisans and pottery makers. There is evidence that those in the region also participated in trade networks that spanned hundreds of kilometers. For instance, evidence indicates trade initiating in the region was done as far west as the Gulf of California and as far south as Central Mexico. Items traded included (but were not limited to) copper bells, precious stones, and shells. Besides settlement of the region by the ancestors of groups such as the Hohokam, this region would also become occupied by Apache groups beginning in the 17th century, whose presence would be detailed in Spanish colonial documents recounting the first expeditions northward. The remains of many pre-contact indigenous settlements in the area persist to this day.

== First Spanish incursions ==
While the southern section of the Sonoran province of New Spain (or Pimería Baja) had been explored by missionaries and begun to be settled by colonists at the first half of the 17th century, incursions into the Pimería Alta can be traced to several decades later. The first known Spanish incursion was made by Father Eusebio Kino, who in 1687 settled his first mission, Nuestra Señora de los Dolores de Cósari, in what is now northern Sonora. Father Kino, a Jesuit sent to the region to establish various missionary settlements, began establishing what would come to be a network of over a dozen missions in the region, not all of which are solely attributable to him (see &quot;Spanish missions in the Sonoran Desert&quot;). The missions of the Pimería Alta had several functions. While proselytizing to indigenous people was one, it also served as a place where the previously nomadic people of the region were settled into sedentary, agricultural lifestyles and became influenced by Spanish religion and culture, at the behest of the Jesuits. Relatedly, the converted indigenous people became a source of economic support for the missions through their labor (directed by missionaries), which was necessary to the success of the mission.

Within the framework of the missions, indigenous peoples were not only instruments of colonization, but also had access to a certain degree of authority within native councils based on these missions, termed &quot;cabildos&quot;. As Cynthia Radding points out:

In this case, &quot;cabildos&quot; both entrenched Spanish control while also granting indigenous peoples living on missions a certain degree of autonomy within the colonial structure. This fact is also significant since, while Jesuit missionaries were the administrators of indigenous lands, they were not the legal proprietors. Under the mission structure, these lands were still legally tied to the indigenous peoples of the mission.

== Colonial period of the Pimería Alta ==
The Jesuit missions of the Pimeria Alta functioned as a fundamental part of Spanish settlement and colonization in the region. In the words of scholars John G. Douglass and William M. Graves:

Despite the initial success of several missions in the area at converting indigenous peoples to Christianity and turning them to sedentary lifestyles, the incursion of the Spanish in the region was oftentimes met with native resistance. A clear example of this is in the fear expressed by many Spaniards – missionaries, colonists, and military men alike – of Apache raids throughout the time period. These raids, along with occasional revolts by the Pima, made the region a hostile place for Spanish colonization.

In the words of a Spanish traveler recounting his observations of the region during the second half of the 18th century:

Translated, the account reads:
 The primary response to native resistance was force. This was best manifested in Spanish military expeditions into the region (sent from further south), of which the establishment of presidios (or military fortifications) were a fundamental component. In the region, a total of 8 presidios were established during the colonial period as a direct response to raids by the Apache and Seris in the region. These presidios often served as a precursor to permanent settlements (as was the case with the Presidio San Agustín del Tucson).

An example of an account depicting such a military expedition is from a campaign journal written by Spanish commanders embarking on a military expedition against the Pimas in the Pimería Alta for four months in 1695:

Significantly, however, not all indigenous peoples openly rebelled against Spanish colonization. Many indigenous peoples in the Pimeria Alta found ways to adapt within the new conditions imposed by Spanish settlement and conquest and made use of official institutions to seek redress when necessary. Additionally, it was not uncommon for indigenous peoples on missions to be attacked during Apache raids against the Spanish. 

As the region became increasingly colonized by the Spanish settlers, they began to establish themselves around increasingly sparse water-bound areas (especially on the riverine areas of the Sonoran Desert). Attempts at agricultural production here were common, and haciendas were often worked by native indigenous workers. Agricultural production was accompanied with efforts to graze cattle in the region and small-scale mining efforts. However, in part due to the scarcity of water, large-scale flooding, and the geography of the desert region, these efforts never produced as much comparable wealth as other parts of New Spain further south. Because of this, these efforts proved to be of relatively little economic significance to the crown.

Adding to this was the local nature of economic production and exchange in the region throughout the colonial period. As noted by Cynthia Radding:

The landscape of Spanish colonization in the region changed upon the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767, a change widely grouped with the Bourbon Reforms of the late colonial period. Many of the missions previously run by the Jesuits were turned over to members of the secular clergy. Despite this change in administration, the missions underwent a general state of decline in both structure and in the number of indigenous peoples rooted to them. This came in contrast to the settlements and presidios in the region, many of which kept expanding throughout the colonial period and into the independence period (often at the expense of the missions). Upon the decline of mission settlements, many of the indigenous peoples whose communities were based around the physical and administrative structure of the mission found their lands increasingly encroached upon by private Spanish interests. The expansion of Spanish private land claims often came at the expense of the historic right to commons that characterized indigenous life on missions. Despite this change, several indigenous communities continued to work the land originally allocated to them while living on the mission. As Radding points out:

Despite the local character of the economy of the Pimería Alta, the social stratification increasingly produced by Spanish private land claims and associated enterprises (agricultural production, cattle grazing, and small-scale mining) created a division between Spanish hacendados and indigenous peasants. This was compounded by the fact that landholding (in turn determined by access to water) became “an instrument of social control.” The problems that this stratification produced proceeded well into the independence period.

== Post-colonial period ==
The impact of colonization in the region cannot be overestimated. Through its inhabitants, remnants of Spanish and native indigenous cultural customs would become a part of life in the Pimería Alta even after the end of the colonial period in 1821. Many of the customs and economic practices characteristic of the region would become entrenched into the independence period. Still it is important to reflect on the differences brought about during both the Mexican independence period and the US after the Gadsden Purchase.

As scholar Edward H. Spencer has articulated, Mexican government policies towards indigenous peoples in the region could be grouped into three categories, all of which had as their primary goal assimilation of indigenous people into Mexican society. The first involved granting of Mexican citizenship, which both hypothetically granted political rights to indigenous peoples of the region while simultaneously stripping them of their political status as ‘Indians’. The second meant attempts to assimilate indigenous peoples into the local Mexican political system, followed thirdly by distribution of small, individual land plots to indigenous families. These policies collectively went against practices established by missionaries in the colonial period, such as communal agricultural production and political organization with a relative degree of autonomy from Spanish authorities. When these policies failed, the Mexican state often used deportations of indigenous peoples of the region (see &quot;Yaqui Wars&quot;) to other parts of the country as a last response to resistance. This response by the Mexican government was coupled with active military aggression. Only in the early 20th century did Mexican government policy shift to include more co-operational approaches to indigenous communities, shifting away from the attempts to institute ‘democratic individualism’ in the 19th century. 

Upon the end of the Mexican–American War in 1848, the Pimería Alta remained part of Mexican state of Sonora and the region continued to be impacted by Mexican political reforms. It was not until 1853 with the signing of the Gadsden Purchase that the northern portion of what was the Pimería Alta was incorporated into the Arizona territory, with the southern portion remaining part of Mexico. The relationship of the US government towards the native residents of the Pimería Alta was radically different from that of the Mexican government. The main tenet of US policy was the forced settlement of indigenous peoples on government demarcated Indian reservations, physically separate from US settlements at large. This approach was in line with patterns of settlement by Anglo-Americans in the newly incorporated Southwestern territories, which alienated indigenous peoples from their prior landholdings. Through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the government&#x27;s policy involved the three tenants of “individual landholding, compulsory education, and religious replacement”. Prior Mexican residents of the region staked out their claim within US settlements, despite the existence of legal racial barriers. Significantly, the landholding claims of Mexican settlers in the region were, while technically respected under the clauses of the Gadsden Purchase, frequently violated and conceded to Anglo-settlers. US settlement in the region was followed by later settlement by African-Americans, Chinese, and other migrant groups who would become attracted to the region&#x27;s economic opportunities brought on in part by the copper mining boom of the late 19th century and by increased agricultural development in the region. Reservations continue to be a facet of life for many Indian nations in the US and their members to the present-day.

== Legacy ==

Much of the Pimería Alta region spans the Sonoran Desert, one of the most ecologically diverse and wettest deserts in the world. Cultural and economic exchanges across national frontiers persisted even after US incorporation of the northern Pimeria Alta region, especially as the result of migration patterns. This exchange persisted despite US restrictions on cross-border economic exchanges and migration, many of which were first implemented in the early 20th century (see &quot;Immigration Act of 1924&quot; and &quot;Mexican Americans&quot;). Also present is the persistent cultural influence of indigenous peoples (including those within the Tohono O’odham, Pascua Yaqui, Ak-Chin and Gila River reservations) as well as those who settled in the region from the colonial period to the present day. Today, the San Xavier Indian Reservation, the second largest Indian reservation in Arizona, is situated in this region, as are the physical vestiges of mission structures and several presidios in both Arizona and Sonora. The ecological impact of European and American colonization in the region has been heavy, with many sources of water (including rivers) having dried out over time due to overuse, manipulation of the environment, and climate change.

<text>Andrey Andreyevich Vlasov (, – August 1, 1946) was a Soviet Russian Red Army general. During the Axis-Soviet campaigns of World War II, he fought (1941–1942) against the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; in the Battle of Moscow and later was captured attempting to lift the siege of Leningrad. After his capture, he defected to the Third Reich and nominally headed the collaborationist Russian Liberation Army (&quot;Russkaya osvoboditel&#x27;naya armiya&quot;, ROA), also becoming the political leader of the Russian collaborationist anti-Soviet movement. 

Initially, this army existed only on paper and was used by Germans to goad Red Army troops to surrender, while any political and military activities were officially forbidden to him by the Nazis after his visits to the occupied territory; only in November 1944 did Heinrich Himmler, aware of Germany&#x27;s shortage of manpower, arrange for Vlasov formations composed of Soviet prisoners of war as armed forces of Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia, a political organisation headed by Vlasov. While for the Nazis the ROA was a mere propaganda weapon, Vlasov and his associates attempted to create an armed political movement independent of the Nazi control that would present an anti-Stalinist program described by Robert Conquest as democratic, while attempting to avoid Nazi antisemitism and chauvinism, with &quot;completing the Revolution&quot; of 1917 being the ultimate goal of the movement.

In January 1945, Vlasov headed the army as it was declared that it would be no longer a part of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. At the war&#x27;s end, the 1st division of ROA aided the May 1945 Prague uprising against the Germans. Vlasov and the ROA were captured by Soviet forces with the United States&#x27; assistance. Vlasov was tortured, and hanged for treason after a secret trial. After his death, his figure and his movement became objects of various narratives in memory politics and historiography.

==Early career==

Born in Lomakino, Nizhny Novgorod Governorate, Russian Empire, Vlasov was originally a student at a Russian Orthodox seminary. He quit the study of divinity after the Russian Revolution, briefly studying agricultural sciences instead, and in 1919 joined the Red Army. He fought in the southern theatre in Ukraine, the Caucasus, and the Crimea during the Russian Civil War, including against the White forces of Anton Denikin and Pyotr Wrangel, and the anarchist army of Nestor Makhno. He distinguished himself as an officer and gradually rose through the ranks of the Red Army. In the 1920s and early 1930s he was a company, battalion, and regimental commander, and graduated from an infantry officer course. He was also an instructor at the Frunze Military Academy.

Vlasov joined the Communist Party in 1930. Sent to China in 1938, he acted as a military adviser to Chiang Kai-shek until November 1939. From February to May 1939 he was the advisor to Yan Xishan, the governor of Shanxi. Vlasov was also the chief of staff to the head of the Soviet military mission, General Aleksandr Cherepanov. He received a military decoration from Chiang and a watch from his wife, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, which were both taken from him after he returned to the USSR. Upon his return, Vlasov served in several assignments before being given command of the 99th Rifle Division. After just nine months under Vlasov&#x27;s leadership, and an inspection by Semyon Timoshenko, the division was recognized as one of the best divisions in the Army in 1940. Timoshenko presented Vlasov with an inscribed gold watch, as he &quot;found the 99th the best of all&quot;. The historian John Erickson says of Vlasov at this point that [he] &quot;was an up-and-coming man&quot;. In 1940, Vlasov was promoted to major general, and on June 22, 1941, when the Germans and their allies invaded the Soviet Union, Vlasov was commanding the 4th Mechanized Corps.

As a lieutenant general, he commanded the 37th Army near Kiev and escaped encirclement. He then played an important role in the defense of Moscow, as his 20th Army counterattacked and retook Solnechnogorsk. Vlasov&#x27;s picture was printed (along with those of other Soviet generals) in the newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot; as that of one of the &quot;defenders of Moscow&quot;. Vlasov was decorated on January 24, 1942, with the Order of the Red Banner for his efforts in the defence of Moscow. Vlasov was ordered to relieve the ailing commander Klykov after the Second Shock Army had been encircled. After this success, Vlasov was put in command of the 2nd Shock Army of the Volkhov Front and ordered to lead the attempt to lift the Siege of Leningrad—the Lyuban-Chudovo Offensive Operation of January–April 1942.

On January 7, 1942, Vlasov&#x27;s army had spearheaded the Lyuban offensive operation to break the Leningrad encirclement. Planned as a combined operation between the Volkhov and Leningrad Fronts on a 30 km frontage, other armies of the Leningrad Front (including the 54th) were supposed to participate at scheduled intervals in this operation. Crossing the Volkhov River, Vlasov&#x27;s army was successful in breaking through the German 18th Army&#x27;s lines and penetrated 70–74 km deep inside the German rear area. However, the other armies (the Volkhov Front&#x27;s 4th, 52nd, and 59th Armies, 13th Cavalry Corps, and 4th and 6th Guards Rifle Corps, as well as the 54th Army of the Leningrad Front) failed to exploit Vlasov&#x27;s advances and provide the required support, and Vlasov&#x27;s army became stranded. Permission to retreat was refused. With the counter-offensive in May 1942, the Second Shock Army was finally allowed to retreat, but by now, too weakened, it was surrounded and in June 1942 virtually annihilated during the final breakout at Myasnoi Bor.

==German prisoner==

After Vlasov&#x27;s army was surrounded, he himself was offered an escape by aeroplane. The general refused and hid in German-occupied territory; ten days later, on July 12, 1942, a local farmer exposed him to the Germans. Vlasov&#x27;s opponent and captor, general Georg Lindemann, interrogated him about the surrounding of his army and details of battles, then &quot;had Vlasov imprisoned in occupied Vinnytsia.&quot;

While in prison, Vlasov met Captain Wilfried Strik-Strikfeldt, a Baltic German who was attempting to foster a Russian Liberation Movement. Strik-Strikfeldt had circulated memos to this effect in the Wehrmacht. Strik-Strikfeldt, who had been a participant in the White movement during the Russian Civil War, persuaded Vlasov to become involved in aiding the German advance against the rule of Joseph Stalin and Bolshevism. With Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir Boyarsky, Vlasov wrote a memo shortly after his capture to the German military leaders suggesting cooperation between anti-Stalinist Russians and the German Army.

==Defection==
Vlasov was taken to Berlin under the control of the Wehrmacht Propaganda Department. While there, he and other Soviet officers began drafting plans for the creation of a Russian provisional government and the recruitment of a Russian army of liberation under Russian command. In the spring of 1943, Vlasov wrote an anti-Bolshevik leaflet known as the &quot;Smolensk Proclamation&quot;, which was dropped from aircraft by the millions on Soviet forces and Soviet-controlled soil. In March of the same year, Vlasov also published an open letter titled &quot;Why I Have Taken Up the Struggle Against Bolshevism&quot;. Even though no Russian Liberation Army yet existed, the Nazi propaganda department issued Russian Liberation Army patches to Russian volunteers and tried to use Vlasov&#x27;s name in order to encourage defections. Several hundred thousand former Soviet citizens served in the German army wearing this patch, but never under Vlasov&#x27;s own command.

Vlasov was permitted to make several trips to German-occupied Soviet Union: most notably, to Pskov, Russia, where Russian pro-German volunteers paraded. The populace&#x27;s reception of Vlasov was mixed. While in Pskov, Vlasov dealt himself a nearly fatal political blow by referring to the Germans as mere &quot;guests&quot; during a speech, which Hitler found belittling. Vlasov was even put under house arrest and threatened with being handed over to the Gestapo. Despondent about his mission, Vlasov threatened to resign and return to the POW camp, but was dissuaded at the last minute by his confidants. According to Varlam Shalamov and his tale &quot;The Last Battle of Major Pugachov&quot;, Vlasov emissaries lectured to the Russian prisoners of war, explaining to them that their government had declared them all traitors, and that escaping was pointless. As Vlasov proclaimed, even if the Soviets succeeded, Stalin would send them to Siberia.
== Vlasov Movement ==

The creation of a political movement behind Vlasov and the Russian collaboration became a result of the conflicts within the Nazi Party and the Nazi bureaucracy. While Hitler and the supporters of the &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot; adhered to the idea of the colonization of the &quot;Untermenschen&quot; and denied any cooperation with the population of the USSR, Alfred Rosenberg proposed the creation of monoethnic nation-states as satellites of the Third Reich ruled by local nationalist collaborators. Hitler rejected this project, but the Soviet defectors were used by &quot;Wehrmacht Propaganda&quot;. Eventually Hitler agreed to use the Soviet defectors for propaganda purposes. As the reports of the &quot;Osstruppen&quot; defecting the Soviet partisans reached Hitler, he demanded that all the units be disbanded, and the men sent to the mines and factories, but this order wasn&#x27;t executed due to the resistance of the &quot;OKW&quot;. After the 20 July plot, the Eastern troops were handed to the SS, and as Hitler weakened due to physical conditions, Himmler found possible the creation of a collaborationist political organisation with its army.

As he defected, Vlasov became the leading figure of the so-called &quot;Russian Liberation Movement&quot;, the main goal of which was the overthrow of Stalinism with the aid of the Nazis; the ROA was thought to be the armed force of the movement. Although the White emigres participated in its formation, the Soviet defectors eventually became its leaders and formulated its political ideals. The Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia (KONR) became the political body of this movement, and its ideals were described in the Prague Manifesto of the Committee in November 1944. Robert Conquest wrote that Vlasov&#x27;s &quot;program shows that he was entirely out of sympathy with Nazism, and only concerned with a democratic Russia.&quot;

As Vlasov became the undisputed leader of the movement, it became referred to as &quot;the Vlasov Movement&quot;, while his Manifesto calls it the &quot;Liberation Movement of the Peoples of Russia&quot;, underlying its multinationality. Although at first Vlasov hoped for an open co-operation of his movement and the Nazis, during his tour at the occupied territories, he emphasised that the Russians, and that National Socialism could not be imposed on Russia, and that &quot;a foreign coat [would] not fit a Russian.&quot; In his nationalist speeches, Vlasov promoted the idea of equal partnership with Germany and the idea of an independent Russia; his speeches angered Himmler, and in response, Wilhelm Keitel issued an order that Vlasov must be returned to POW camp and that his name henceforth should be used only for propaganda purposes. Rosenberg stopped supporting Vlasov, but he was placed under virtual house arrest in Dahlem instead of being sent to the POW camp. Disappointed, Vlasov said several times that he would return to the camp, but was dissuaded by his associates, namely Malyshkin and Wilfried Strik-Strikfeldt.

Ideologically, the Vlasov movement was between the Russian nationalism of the National Alliance of Russian Solidarists, an organisation of far-right origins which collaborated with the Nazis but the members of which were repressed by Gestapo in 1943 and 1944 so Vlasov had to ask Himmler to free them, as its ideologues surrounded Vlasov, and social democratic views of the other Russian POWs in Germany.

Some of Vlasov&#x27;s close associates like , a Soviet journalist of Jewish origins, described themselves as Marxists, Zykov was also described as a Bukharinist. Despite being captured by the Nazi secret police and killed, ostensibly for his Jewish origins and for his views, before the formation of the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia and the creation of its Manifesto, the political organization of the Vlasovites, Zykov was a major ideologue of the Vlasov army and participated in writing of the other Vlasovite program documents. The Vlasovites opposed their programs, the Smolensk Declaration, Vlasov&#x27;s open letter &quot;Why I Decided to Fight against Bolshevism&quot;, the Prague Manifesto of the KONR and &quot;Bloknot Propagandista&quot; (an important document which was written by rather minor members of the KONR as open for discussion and was not recognized as an official program), both to the Western capitalism and Stalinism, which was called by the word &quot;Bolshevism&quot; and described in the Manifesto not as socialism but as &quot;state capitalism&quot;, and proclaimed their devotion to &quot;completing the Revolution&quot; of 1917 without distinguishing the February Revolution and the October Revolution, and to ideals of either a &quot;Russia without Bolsheviks and Capitalists&quot; (Smolensk Declaration and the open letter), or a welfare state (&quot;Bloknot Propagandista&quot;); the influence of the NTS on the Manifesto is seen in the description of the future system of Russia as a &quot;national-labour&quot; system, some of Vlasov&#x27;s generals joined the NTS. All of these documents granted the basic democratic freedoms and rights, including the right of the nations to self-determination and to separate from Russia and did not contain antisemitic remarks and invectives; &quot;Bloknot Propagandista&quot; also contained an attempt in critique of Marxism and denied both internationalism and national chauvinism. However, antisemitic remarks were made in one of the speeches of Vasily Malyshkin in 1943 and in and in Georgi Zhilenkov&#x27;s interview to the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot;; Vlasov was critical of such remarks and replied to the Nazi concerns that &quot;the Jewish question&quot; &quot;was an internal Russian problem and would be dealt with after they [the ROA] had accomplished the primary aim of overthrowing the existing regime&quot;; however, antisemitism frequently appeared in the pro-Vlasov Nazi and collaborationist newspapers issued before the formation of KONR, including the ones edited by Zykov, often in form of articles reprinted from the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; with the citation of the source. The program documents were also written as a compromise with Nazism to various extents: the Smolensk Declaration included some pro-Nazi points (&quot;Germany was not fighting the war against the Russian people and their homeland but merely against Bolshevism&quot;), and the Manifesto included a number of criticisms of the Western Allies as a compromise with Himmler&#x27;s insistence to add antisemitic points.

The Nazis were suspicious of Vlasov, his organisation and his ideological position, and the Gestapo warned about the possibility of the Vlasovites betraying the Reich. The suspicions and criticism of the Vlasovites from the Reich officials was summarised in a document by the Ministry of Propaganda official Eberhard Taubert who described his concerns about the movement being &quot;not National Socialist&quot;: &quot;It is significant that it does not fight Jewry, that the Jewish Question is not recognized as such at all&quot;; instead it presented &quot;a watered-down infusion of liberal and Bolshevik ideologies&quot;, and Taubert described the concern with &quot;strong Anglophile sympathies&quot; and it &quot;toying with the idea of a possible change of course&quot; while not &quot;feel[ing] bound to Germany&quot;. 
Himmler, the head of the SS, had a negative attitude towards Vlasov and the idea of arming Russian formations. For example, in late 1942 he told another SS official who was based in Minsk that Russian collaborators should not be promised a national state and only a liberation from Bolshevism and possibly better living standards. He oversaw the creation of the SS-Volunteer Division &quot;Galicia&quot; in October 1943 from Ukrainian volunteers, but that same month he said that Vlasov made him &quot;genuinely anxious.&quot; Himmler later noted that there were Wehrmacht officers who wanted to give Vlasov a million-man army, and speculated that in the future it could theoritically turn against Germany. Himmler did not want Vlasov to even be used for propaganda and on another occasion said that Vlasov&#x27;s ideology &quot;must be intellectually totally annihilated among us.&quot; Hitler had similar concerns, having said in June 1943 that Vlasov was unneeded, because the Germans &quot;would never build up a Russian army.&quot;

It was not until Germany&#x27;s position was weakened in the spring of 1944 that Himmler began changing his mind, with the encouragement of Gunter d&#x27;Alquen and others, and decided to meet with Vlasov. Their meeting was meant for 21 July 1944, but was postponed by the assassination attempt against Hitler until 16 September 1944. When it happened, Himmler promised Vlasov several Russian divisions. Two began to be formed, the 600th Infantry Division in November 1944 and the 650th Infantry Division in January 1945, respectively.

Earlier, in the summer of 1944 Vlasov, who had been depressed after the first few years of failing to get German support for the Russian Liberation Movement, was sent to an SS recovery center in Ruhpolding that was run by Heidi Bielenberg, the widow of an SS officer. Several weeks after meeting they decided to get married, even though neither one spoke each other&#x27;s language and Vlasov probably knew that his first wife was still alive in the Soviet Union. This may have been done under the pressure of the SS. According to the SS liaison officer to Vlasov, the idea for the marriage came mainly from her, because she liked the idea of becoming the &quot;first lady&quot; of a future Russian state.

==Commander of the ROA==
The only combat of the ROA against the Red Army took place on February 11, 1945, on the river Oder; it was carried out by the First Division led by General Sergei Bunyachenko. After three days of battle against overwhelming forces, the First Division of the ROA was forced to retreat and marched southward to Prague, in German-controlled Bohemia. In March 1945, Bunyachenko started disobeying the commands of the Wehrmacht; eventually Ferdinand Schörner (and later Rudolf Toussaint) threatened to use armed force against the ROA. Vlasov reprimanded Bunyachenko during their meeting with Schörner in assertion of his loyalty, but privately granted Bunyachenko complete independence in sign of his approval while himself taking care of the rest two incomplete divisions.

During the Prague uprising, the officers of the First Division, Bunyachenko and Vlasov gathered a meeting and discussed whether the First Division should help the insurgents. Vlasov spoke against joining the uprising, but his position was not supported by the others, and the First Division joined the uprising. Two days later, the First Division was forced to leave Prague as Communist Czech partisans began arresting ROA soldiers in order to hand them over to the Soviets for execution. Vlasov and the rest of his forces, trying to evade the Red Army, attempted to head west to surrender to the Allies in the closing days of the war in Europe.

==Capture by Soviet forces, trial, and execution==

Vlasov&#x27;s division, commanded by General Sergei Bunyachenko, was captured southeast of Plzeň by the Soviet 25th Tank Corps, after their attempt to surrender to US troops was rejected. Captain M. I. Yakushev of the 162nd Tank Brigade had Vlasov dragged out of his car, put on a tank and driven straight to the Soviet 13th Army HQ. Vlasov was then transported from the 13th Army HQ to Marshal Ivan Konev&#x27;s command post in Dresden, and from there sent immediately to Moscow.

Vlasov was confined in Lubyanka prison where he was interrogated. A secret trial was held, beginning on 30 July 1946 and was presided over by Viktor Abakumov who sentenced him and eleven other senior officers from his army to death for high treason. Vlasov was executed by hanging on 1 August 1946. His execution was among the last death sentences in the Soviet Union carried out by hanging, after which executions were conducted only by shooting.

== Legacy ==
=== Historiography and memory politics ===
==== 20th century ====
In the USSR, the figure of Vlasov was villainized because of the need to defend the official myth of the Great Patriotic War, which was &quot;created and assiduously supported as a pillar of state legitimacy and national culture in the USSR&quot;. However, in the emigration and later in the post-Soviet Russia, he and his movement became objects of various narratives.

The first narrative in the emigration was set up by the former White Guards who served in the ROA or supported Vlasov, although they were a minority in the ROA and had conflicts with the Vlasovites, since the Whites were suspicious of the former Soviet soldiers and sometimes called them &quot;Reds&quot;, while Vasily Malyshkin, one of Vlasov&#x27;s closest associates, charged that the White movement, described by him as a movement of conservative gentry, had remained distant from realities of the USSR, and lacked &quot;any progressive principles&quot;, ranging from apoliticism to reaction, and through seeking a &quot;restoration of the old noble-landowning system&quot; did nothing but legitimizing the Bolsheviks. The Vlasovites and the Whites had very different world views, partially because for the Whites struggle against the USSR and collaboration with the Nazis was not a means of survival, partially because the Vlasovites who were grown on the Soviet culture saw conservatism of the Whites as backward-looking and irrelevant, and Malyshkin suggested that the conflict between the Whites and the Vlasovites was rooted in different social backgrounds and class origins and worldviews. However, after the war, the Whites who participated in the Vlasov Movement sought to connect it with their cause: for example, Constantine Kromiadi wrote that the Vlasov Movement was a part of the &quot;Christian war of the 30 years of the liberation movement against communism&quot;; the White rightists sought to &quot;offset the opprobrium of collaboration with Germany by viewing World War Two through the prism of the Russian Civil War and the Tsarist period&quot; and alleged that the Soviets, not the collaborators, were the real national traitors. Such ideas were not popular among the majority of the surviving Vlasovites, but for a few years the Whites became their new leaders and even established Monarchist Vlasovite organizations, since they were naturalized citizens of European states and had more chances of surviving, also because of &quot;aristocratic cohesion&quot; and such benefits as knowledge of foreign languages, while the Vlasovites were in danger of Operation Keelhaul, forced repatriation to the USSR carried out by the U.S. with the subsequential punishment for treason; the Whites attempted to unite the whole emigration and get funding by the CIA, and the latter could help Vlasovites survive. However, the Whites failed to get the attention of the CIA, and their narrative was soon rejected. However, it would reemerge in post-Soviet Russia.

To get the interest of the U.S. military intelligence, the post-war Vlasovites stressed the anti-Communist nature of their movement. However, the new narrative was left-wing, being constructed by the Menshevik intellectual and historian Boris Nicolaevsky, who after visiting DP camps came to a belief that the Vlasov Movement was democratic and even anti-Nazi to some extent. His narrative was somewhat closer to the truth, as he, unlike the Whites, could cite Vlasovite documents, like the Prague Manifesto of the KONR. However, it was incomplete and still had some factual errors. Nikolaevsky described the Vlasovites with the word &quot;porazhentsy&quot;, &quot;defeatists&quot;, the word used by the Bolsheviks during the World War II towards themselves, as they campaigned against the war efforts of the Russian Empire and for overthrow of the reactionary Tsarist and later imperialist &quot;bourgeois&quot; government with a revolutionary civil war; Nikolaevsky drew a parallel between Vlasov and Leninists and thought the first to be influenced by the latter, believing that Vlasov&#x27;s motivation was to begin a similar civil war. The Vlasovites embraced Nicolaevsky&#x27;s narrative, and he would help them to operate through the CIA-supported AMCOMLIB, however, Roman Gul believed that they were insincere and saw Nicolaevsky only as &quot;a direct and CLEAN entry to Washington&quot; and were interested in the Socialist &quot;émigrés&quot;, including Nicolaevsky, only as powerful representatives of American power. However, the Vlasovites did not have a necessity to present themselves left-wing democrats, since the CIA did not scruple to fund the openly far-right collaborators from the Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations, like the Belarusian Central Council.

Nicolaevsky&#x27;s narrative resulted in a polemics among the &quot;émigrés&quot;, and opponents of Nicolaevsky among &quot;oborontsy&quot;, the word from the vocabulary of the WWI to indicate the patriotic opposition to the Bolsheviks&#x27; defeatism, the supporters of the war effort of the USSR in the WWII, attacked the Vlasovites and Nicolaevsky: according to them, the democratic program was just a way to court the West in the face of Nazi defeat, that they were national traitors and mere &quot;powerless pawns&quot; in &quot;organized and merciless destruction&quot; of their own people, a &quot;propaganda trick&quot;, and that they were unscrupulous people motivated only by lust for power or physical survival whose movement could not be democratic in any way. B. Dvinov, one of the most harsh Nicolaevsky&#x27;s opponents, supported his publications with documents. Alexander Dallin called his publications &quot;a documented but one-sided attempt in Russian émigré politics to reduce the Vlasov movement to a German propaganda trick.&quot;

Among the positions of the &quot;émigrés&quot; was a compromise one that &#x27;Vlasovism&#x27; may be a democratic movement, but Vlasov and the other leaders should be condemned, and that the Vlasovites should admit that collaboration with the Nazis was a mistake, but the Vlasovites from the SBONR, which joined the AMCOMLIB, refused to admit the latter and continued to idolize their executed leader; they accused their opponents of Communism, while the Socialist &quot;émigrés&quot; accused Vlasovites of Nazism, and both claims were dangerous since the FBI had been closely monitoring both of the factions. More to it, the SBONR in their responses made nationalist and allegedly antisemitic dog whistles, since they never mentioned the Jewish origins of their opponents, but contrasted the &quot;Russian people&quot; with the American exiles who &quot;long ago forgotten how to understand&quot; the first; later they compromised themselves more with &quot;historical apologies for restoration and reaction&quot;, therefore making Nicolaevsky&#x27;s narrative unable to be adopted as universal, since one of their publications called Kerensky a traitor for preventing the Kornilov coup in 1917. However, after the polemic Nicolaevsky continued his publications about the biographies of the Vlasovite leaders and did not change his opinion, and not all the Socialist &quot;émigrés&quot; dismissed Nicolaevsky and his narrative.

While Benjamin Tromly and other authors believe the description of the ROA as a somewhat revolutionary movement of ideological protest against Stalinism which conflicted with the Nazis to be largely constructed by the Vlasovites themselves, this claim is rather inaccurate, since the theme of the ROA was explored in the works of several Western historians: along with the sovietologist Eugene Lyons, the chairman of the AMCOMLIB whose attitute towards the Vlasovites was ambivalent, who also believed the ROA to be influenced with Lenin&#x27;s revolutionary defeatism, the historians Jurgen Thorwald and Joachim Hoffmann also contributed to the theme; the historian George Fischer, on the contrary, believed the &quot;inertness&quot; and opportunism caused by Stalinist totalitarianism to be the grounds of the ROA, but he saw Vlasov&#x27;s political career as an overcoming of opportunism and &quot;inertness&quot;, although he failed to &quot;overcome&quot; &quot;Bolshevism&quot;; Catherine Andreev agreed with Fischer&#x27;s last point, but criticized the other two. More to it, Tromly believes that the works of Catherine Andreev and keep the &quot;essential contours&quot; of Nicolaevsky&#x27;s narrative, and that Andreev &quot;bypasses controversial questions about the context in which Vlasov troops were recruited, the émigrés employed in Nazi security agencies, and the deep internal hostilities within the KONR&#x27;s ranks&quot;, as well as the war crimes committed by the soldiers of the ROA. This theme was also explored by Dallin who wrote that &quot;Vlasov was no puppet: therein lay, from the German point of view, both his potential value and his challenge. A relatively &#x27;autonomous&#x27; figure, as yet untarnished by association with German abuses and atrocities, he could appeal to the Soviet population more successfully than could the Germans. But as a leader with a will and a following, he and his movement could also develop a dynamic of their own and — precisely because they might be successful — could become potentially distinct from or even hostile to the interests of the German leadership.&quot; Dallin also wrote that the idea of the &quot;third force&quot; promoted by the Vlasovites and the NTS was doomed: &quot;no &#x27;third force&#x27; could succeed because there was no viable third choice; neither of the titans would tolerate a power vacuum — nor the arrogation of power by a new, autonomous competitor.&quot; Most of these historians relied mostly on the Nazi documents and not the Soviet archives, partly because the latter were unaccessible.

A new narrative was constructed in the 1970s and emerged in Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s book &quot;The GULAG Archipelago&quot;: while not directly advocating collaboration, he and the later authors labelled Vlasov as &quot;the symbol of the suffering Russian people&quot; and its &quot;victimhood&quot; throughout the 20th century. Solzhenitsyn described the Vlasovite prisoners met by him in GULAG camps and wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s not the Vlasovites who betrayed Russia - it&#x27;s the Soviet state which betrayed these soldiers&quot;, since &quot;Stalin sacrificed armies meaninglessly. He had treated prisoners of war as traitors&quot;, and the World War II became &quot;a double sacrifice. This is the idea that the Soviet people, now increasingly perceived as the Russian people, won the war against Nazism despite the brutality and incompetence of the Soviet state. In this context, Vlasov&#x27;s sacrifice is entirely appropriate.&quot; With all these narratives given, Benjamin Tromly calls Vlasov an &quot;empty signifier&quot;. Julia Shapiro writes that Vlasov during his collaboration with the Nazis managed to secure his image for the further generations, but &quot;his intentionally murky
beliefs make him a convenient straw man to suit cultural and political agendas. Based on the
documents, he can be framed as an anti-Bolshevist crusader, Russian patriot, misunderstood
democrat, martyred hero, and fascist puppet. Eighty years on, he still defies categorization.&quot; Shapiro believed that Vlasov&#x27;s motivations were complex and laid between opportunism and ideological opposition; she believes moral relativism and &quot;historical consciousness&quot; to be among his most important qualities.

==== Post-Soviet Russia ====
After the &quot;perestroika&quot; and the fall of the Soviet Union, narratives described above entered Russian historiography and memory politics. These narratives challenge the myth of the Soviet, increasingly perceived as Russian, Victory in the Great Patriotic War, which is significant to Russian national identity. As this myth has been increasingly used by Vladimir Putin and his Putinist regime to legitimize its state and its actions, the figure of Vlasov gains a political value in contemporary Russia. The positive attitude towards Vlasov became visible in the late 1980s, but the majority of Russian society is negative towards collaboration, although there is still no unity on this question. The fall of the Soviet Union did not lead to immediate popularisation of Vlasov among the emerging far-right nationalists, since they preferred the ideals of Pan-Slavism and an Empire to a separatist nation-state. A major liberal politician during the fall of the USSR and the mayor of Moscow Gavriil Popov wrote a complimentary book about Vlasov, but was not supported. In the 2000s various nationalist organizations which associated themselves with the White movement campaigned for rehabilitation of Vlasov; the support for the White narrative in the Church caused a scandal after the reunification of the Orthodox Church in Russia and the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad.

Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s narrative became more or less convenient, since it did not deny the role of Victory and the Great Patriotic War and united it with criticism of Stalin and the understanding of Vlasov&#x27;s tragedy which could be reintegrated into national history, making it more inclusive. Yet, it became debated in the 1990s and received a backlash as a &quot;slander of the entire generation&quot; &quot;who had fought in the war&quot;. The opponents of such narratives, including the Communist Party of the Russian Federation created in 1993, started connecting the apology for Vlasov and the ROA with the chaos of the 1990s: economic collapse, dissolution of the Soviet Union and the First Chechen War, the rize of the organized crime, making Vlasov a symbol &quot;past and current betrayal in Russia&quot;; in the second part of the 1990s, Boris Yeltsin turned back to commemoration of the Great Patriotic War, and after the rise of Putin, &quot;this anti-Vlasov discourse hardens and takes on increasing domestic political uses,&quot; connecting Vlasov with the &#x27;collapse of Empire&#x27; and influence of the West. Jade McGlynn and Tromly describe how Vlasov&#x27;s figure became unsuitable for the Putin regime; however, it was not until 2022 when it received significant attention.

Throughout the 2000s, the state-sponsored narratives of the WWII villainized Vlasov again whenever his figure appeared in public discourse, although the latter did not happen often. In the 2010s, the debates over Vlasov moved to historiography, and Kirill Aleksandrov was stripped of his PhD by the Ministry of Education in 2016 after writing a dissertation about the ROA; the earlier successful defense of this dissertation was followed with a scandal, as pro-Kremlin organizations, including the CPRF, forwarded the dissertation to Russian prosecutors to inspect for violation of Putin&#x27;s &quot;memory law&quot;, which criminalizes &quot;lies about the activities of the Soviet Union in the Second World War&quot; and held rallies with slogans such as &quot;Bandera in Ukraine - Vlasov in Russia&quot;, and Aleksandrov&#x27;s article about Bandera written back in 2014 was designated as an extremist material; the professional historians who joined the attacks compared the dissertation with &quot;blackening of our history&quot; by foreigners.

After the Annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the War in Donbas in 2014 Putin called the Ukrainian authorities &quot;Banderites&quot;, and Kremlin-affiliated media and politicians alike framed the fighting as a rerun of the Second World War; the usage of the word &quot;banderite&quot; became popular in propaganda, and the Russian media and politicians were eager to remind of collaborators of other nationalities, Tatars and Chechens, but avoided Vlasov and the ROA: McGlynn noted that in an analysis of 3,509 comparisons between the 2014 conflict and WWII, Vlasov was mentioned just once, as a reminder of Russian collaboration could &quot;besmirch Russia&#x27;s moral authority as an heir to the Soviet Union&#x27;s Great Victory of 1945 and self-appointed defender of the war&#x27;s memory.&quot;
According to Tromly, the Russian state avoids the mentions of ethnic Russian collaboration and views &quot;reviving a positive memory of Vlasov&quot; as an &quot;instrument of information war&quot; against itself.

The attention to Vlasov increased after the Russian invasion of Ukraine: McGlynn notes that &quot;written references to Vlasovites have increased to levels that usually accompany the release of a popular new book on the subject.&quot; Some of them are related to the Ukrainian units of Russian citizens, like the Freedom of Russia Legion, while prominent nationalist figures have branded Russians fleeing mobilization as Vlasovite deserters, and some media reminded of the connection between Vlasovites and Banderites; after criticizing the war, the journalist Dmitry Kolezev received a flood of messages with the same text: &quot;Only Vlasovites discredit the army.&quot; Before the invasion, Alexei Navalny was labelled a Vlasovite, as the official allegations included &quot;memory crimes&quot;; in 2020, the Russian Foreign Ministry officially protested against a monument to the ROA fighters who participated in Prague Uprising. Putin personally mentioned Vlasov only in 2024, after the presidential elections, during which the Ukrainian units of Russian citizens launched an incursion into Russia; he labelled as &quot;Vlasovites&quot; these units, reminded how the Vlasovites were executed, and ordered the FSB to track down every Russian citizen &quot;fighting against Russia&quot;. He said: &quot;We will punish them without a statute of limitations, wherever they are.&quot;

=== Attempts of rehabilitation ===
In 2001, a Russian organization &quot;&quot;&quot;For Faith and Fatherland&quot; applied to the Russian Federation&#x27;s military prosecutor for a review of Vlasov&#x27;s case, saying that &quot;Vlasov was a patriot who spent much time re-evaluating his service in the Red Army and the essence of Stalin&#x27;s regime before agreeing to collaborate with the Germans&quot;. The military prosecutor concluded that the law of rehabilitation of victims of political repressions did not apply to Vlasov and refused to consider the case again. However, Vlasov&#x27;s Article 58 conviction for anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda was vacated.

==Memorial==

A memorial dedicated to General Vlasov was erected at the Novo-Diveevo Russian Orthodox convent and cemetery in Nanuet, New York. Twice annually, on the anniversary of Vlasov&#x27;s execution and on the Sunday following Orthodox Easter, a memorial service is held for Vlasov and the forces of the Russian Liberation Army.

<doc id="300499" wikidata="Q271619" url="?curid=300499" title="Ipoh">
<text>Ipoh (, ) is the capital city of the Malaysian state of Perak. Located by the Kinta River, it is nearly north of Kuala Lumpur and southeast of George Town in neighbouring Penang. As of the 2020 census Ipoh had a population of 759,952, making it the eighth-largest city in Malaysia by population.

In recent years, Ipoh&#x27;s popularity as an international tourist destination has been significantly boosted by efforts to conserve its British colonial-era architecture. The city is also well known for its cuisine and natural attractions, such as its limestone hills and caves within which Buddhist temples were built.

Ipoh&#x27;s location between Kuala Lumpur and George Town has made it a major land transportation hub within West Malaysia, with both the Malayan Railway&#x27;s West Coast Line and the North-South Expressway cutting through the city. Aside from the land transportation links, Ipoh is also served by the Sultan Azlan Shah Airport.

==Etymology==
The name Ipoh is derived from the Malay name of &quot;Antiaris toxicaria&quot; (&quot;pokok ipoh&quot;) which grows locally. The sap of this plant, which is poisonous, was mixed with Strychnos latex by Aslians to coat the tips of their blowpipe darts for hunting.

==History==

Originally a village, Ipoh began to grow rapidly in the 1880s after huge deposits of tin were discovered within its vicinity. Its geographic location in the rich tin-bearing valley of the Kinta River made it a natural centre of growth.

The Great Fire of Ipoh in 1892 destroyed over half the town, but also presented an opportunity to rebuild the town in a more orderly grid pattern. By 1895, it was the second largest town within the Federated Malay States, which also consisted of Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, and Pahang.

Ipoh was subsequently rebuilt in time for the second tin rush and grew rapidly as a result of the booming tin mining industry, particularly in the 1920s and 1930s.

A local Hakka miner, millionaire Yau Tet Shin, started developing a large tract of the town in the early 1930s, today known as the &quot;New Town&quot;, from the eastern bank of the Kinta River to Greentown. In 1937, Ipoh was made the capital of Perak, replacing Taiping.

Ipoh was invaded by the Japanese on 15 December 1941. In March 1942, the Japanese Civil Administration or Perak Shu Seicho was set up at St. Michael&#x27;s Institution. After the liberation of Malaya by British forces, Ipoh remained the capital of Perak as it does to this day.

Following the depletion of its tin deposits and the collapse of tin prices in the 1970s, the city suffered decades of decline and neglect. With the closure of the tin mines, its urban population was forced to seek employment in other cities within Malaysia. In spite of this, Ipoh remains one of the largest cities in Malaysia in terms of population, with tourism now a main driver of the city&#x27;s economy.

Ipoh gained Municipal status in 1962, and in 1988 it was declared a city by the then Sultan of Perak, Sultan Azlan Shah.

==Geography==
===Topography===
Ipoh is in the state of Perak, which is in the central part of Peninsular Malaysia. The city is in the middle of the karstic Kinta Valley region, on the bank of the Kinta River and the confluence of the smaller rivers Sungai Pinji and Sungai Pari. Hills of limestone, called mogotes, surround the city, which can be found around suburban areas to the northeast, east and southeast.

The Keledang mountain range stretches from the north to the west of the city. This range runs parallel to the Bintang mountain range with the Perak River running on its left bank and the Kinta River to its right. This range is interrupted to the north of Ipoh by a tributary of the Perak River called the Pelus River, which is sourced from the Titiwangsa mountain range, which runs to the east of Ipoh.

===Climate===
Ipoh has a tropical rainforest climate. Ipoh is more subject to the Intertropical Convergence Zone than the trade winds and very rarely has cyclones, therefore it can be described as having an equatorial climate. The city&#x27;s temperature shows little variation throughout the year, the average temperature being . Ipoh sees high precipitation throughout the year with an average of of rain each month and averaging of rain per year. The wettest month is October when on average of rain falls. Ipoh&#x27;s driest month is January which has of rainfall on average.
===Limestone caves===
Mogotes are the most prominent natural features of the city. There are many caves in these outcrops, some of which have cave temples built in them. The Sam Poh Tong Temple is a notable example, along with Kek Lok Tong; Cavern of Utmost Happiness), which lies on the other side of the same outcrop. It is accessible through the Gunung Rapat housing area. Other cave temples in Ipoh include Ling Sen Tong, Nan Tian Tong, Kwan Yin Tong and Perak Tong.

Gua Tempurung, near Gopeng, south of Ipoh, is a show cave open to the public and popular among spelunkers. More than long, it is one of the longest caves in Peninsular Malaysia. Part of it has been developed with electric lighting and walkways, and there are tours of varying lengths and difficulty. A river passage runs about through the hill. There are five large chambers, filled with spectacular speleothems which include stalactites and stalagmites.

==Economy==

In its early history, Ipoh as a settlement was built around its mining industry, although inferior to that of Gopeng, some to the south. Ipoh was once one of the richest cities in Malaysia and South East Asia, in the days when tin was its major product. During the 1980s, when tin prices collapsed, the economy of Ipoh was affected significantly. However, the city has since experienced economic growth. The city of Ipoh hosts the headquarters of several large multinational corporations, such as: Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad, a major palm oil company; Batu Kawan Berhad, an investment company which holds the majority share in Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad; Hovid Berhad, a major Malaysian pharmaceutical company; and Old Town White Coffee (or Old Town Berhad), a food and beverage giant originating from Ipoh which specializes in white coffee. Other public listed companies in Ipoh include, Perak Transit Berhad, Tasek Cement Berhad, DKLS Industries Berhad, Wellcall Holding Berhad, Rubberex Berhad, and Perak Corp. Ipoh also hosts the Malaysian headquarters for several foreign multinational companies, including Finisar, Voith, ITL Asia Pacific, and Sagami Manufacturers.

==Governance==

The Ipoh City Council governs the city. Datuk Rumaizi Baharin, appointed in April 2020, is the current mayor of Ipoh.

Ipoh is divided into two parliamentary constituencies: &quot;Ipoh Barat&quot; (Ipoh West) and &quot;Ipoh Timor&quot; (Ipoh East). The parliamentary seat for &quot;Ipoh Barat&quot; is held by Democratic Action Party (DAP) Representative M. Kulasegaran. The seat for &quot;Ipoh Timor&quot; is held by fellow DAP leader Howard Lee Chuan How. As of 2022, there were 233,000 voters in Ipoh. Most of the voters in Ipoh are Chinese, followed by Malays, Indians and others.

==Demographics==
Ipoh remains one of Malaysia&#x27;s largest cities. As of 2010, the municipal area of Ipoh has a population of 657,892. It ranks as the seventh most populous urban centre in Malaysia (2010).

The following is based on Department of Statistics Malaysia 2010 census.

==Transport==
===Roads===
The old interstate Federal Route 1 connects Ipoh with other major towns and cities in peninsular Malaysia, for example to Alor Setar, Taiping and Penang to the north and Tapah, Kuala Lumpur, Seremban and even Johor Bahru in the south. Motorists from the east coast can use Federal Route 4 (from Gerik) in northern Perak or Federal Route 185 (from Cameron Highlands).

The new North–South Expressway is a faster and more efficient alternative to Route 1. However, some towns such as Kampar can only be accessible via Route 1.

===Train===

Ipoh&#x27;s railway station is operated by Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) and is in the Old Town. However, it does not have intra-city travel like there is in Kuala Lumpur; the railway only connects Ipoh with neighbouring towns and cities. The station is a stately building, referred to by locals as the &quot;Taj Mahal of Ipoh&quot;. KTM Intercity began the Shuttle Train Service between Kuala Lumpur and Ipoh from 1 December 2008 while the modern Electric Train System (ETS) shuttle began from 12 August 2010, with an average speed of , plying the Ipoh-Seremban route, which cut the travelling distance between Ipoh and Kuala Lumpur to 120 minutes. There are 10 dedicated shuttle train services between these two cities daily, beginning at 5 am from both of the stations. Travel time between the cities was expected to be reduced from three hours to two hours and fifteen minutes when the new set of EMU trains arrived in mid-2009.

===Bus===
The inter-city bus terminal is located at Amanjaya Integrated Bus Terminal in Bandar Meru Raya, just north of the city. Medan Kidd is the public transport intracity terminal that is very near to Ipoh Railway Station. Currently, the main public transport operator in the city is PerakTransit under the branding of BAS.MY Ipoh.

===Air=== 
The Sultan Azlan Shah Airport is the only airport in Ipoh, located near Gunung Rapat. Domestic and international flights are available. Scoot and AirAsia provide daily flights from Ipoh to Singapore Changi Airport while Batik Air Malaysia used to provide daily flights to Senai International Airport, serving as a link to the city of Johor Bahru. There are also planned flights to Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and China, with talks of a new airport soon.

<doc id="300505" wikidata="Q1783211" url="?curid=300505" title="Scaramouche">
<text>Scaramouche () or Scaramouch (; Italian: Scaramuccia ; ) is a stock clown character of the 16th-century commedia dell&#x27;arte (comic theatrical arts of Italian literature). The role combined characteristics of the Zanni (servant) and il Capitano (masked henchman), with some assortment of villainous traits. Usually attired in black Spanish dress and burlesquing a don, he was often beaten by Harlequin for his boasting and cowardice.

==History==

Although Tiberio Fiorillo (1608–1694) was not the first to play the role, he greatly developed and popularized it. He removed the mask, used white powder on his face, and employed grimaces. He was small, had a long beard, and wore a predominantly black costume with a white ruff. In France, he became known as Scaramouche. In the 19th century, the English actor Joseph Grimaldi and his son J. S. Grimaldi made numerous appearances as Scaramouche.

==Character==
Scaramouche influences the audience to do his bidding. Rosa says that Coviello (like Scaramouche) is &quot;short, adroit, supple, and conceited&quot;. In Molière&#x27;s &quot;The Bourgeois Gentleman&quot;, Coviello disguises his master as a Turk and pretends to speak Turkish. Both Scaramouche and Coviello can be clever or stupid—as the actor sees fit to portray him.

In Blaise Pascal&#x27;s &quot;Pensées&quot; Section 1 Article 12, Scaramouche is described as a person &quot;who only thinks of one thing. The doctor, who speaks for a quarter of an hour after he has said everything, so full is he of the desire of talking.&quot;

==In puppetry==
Scaramouche is one of the great characters in the Punch and Judy puppet shows with roots in commedia dell&#x27;arte. In some scenarios, he is the owner of The Dog, another stock character. During performances, Punch frequently strikes Scaramouche, causing his head to come off his shoulders. Because of this, the term &quot;scaramouche&quot; has become associated with a class of puppets with extendable necks.

==Scaramouche in popular culture==

* &quot;Scaramouche Jones&quot; (2002) is a solo play by Justin Butcher, which was premiered in its full form by Pete Postlethwaite. In this 100-minute monologue, an aging clown recounts, at the turn of the millennium, the picaresque story of his life, from his early childhood in Trinidad at the start of the 20th century, the son of a gypsy prostitute and an Englishman, through his harsh misadventures in the slave trade and in wartime Poland, where as a gravedigger he found his vocation as a clown while striving to keep children amused by parodying their imminent slaughter.
* In the opening chapter of the book &quot;Phule&#x27;s Company&quot; by Robert Asprin, the main character Willard Phule uses Scaramouche as his alias (&quot;Scaramouche?&quot; Major Joshua said with a frown. &quot;Aside from the obvious reference to the character from the novel.&quot;).

His very public presence in news media prompted an 8.185% increase in searches for &quot;Scaramouche&quot;, according to Merriam-Webster. Cartoonist Ruben Bolling hinted at some striking congruities between Scaramucci&#x27;s conduct in office and the defining traits of the theatrical figure.

<doc id="300519" wikidata="Q938850" url="?curid=300519" title="Citroën Saxo">
<text>The Citroën Saxo is a supermini produced by the French manufacturer Citroën from 1996 to 2003. It was sold in Japan as the Citroën Chanson, because Honda had registered the &quot;Saxo&quot; name. The Saxo was a development of the Citroën AX and Peugeot 106, which shared a platform and running gear (the major difference being interiors and body panels). It was discontinued in 2003, when it was replaced with the Citroën C2 and Citroën C3 which launched a year earlier. Both models were developed alongside the Peugeot 206.

==Overview==

===Engines and performance===
All engines were from the PSA TU engine series that powered the Peugeot 205 from 1988 and the Citroën AX, and had their roots before that with the OHC PSA X engine various other PSA cars used such as the Citroën Visa and the predecessors of the Peugeot 206 (Peugeot 104 and Peugeot 205). The range included five petrol engines and one diesel engine, all naturally aspirated.

Although the quoted power outputs are low in comparison to modern small hatchbacks, or even to other hatchbacks of the time, the kerb weight was generally very low, with even the range-topping VTS having a kerb weight of just , with other smaller engine models (except the diesel) being around 100 kg lighter than this.
This meant a high power to weight ratio resulting in decent acceleration and made the car suitable for city driving. Aside from the VTS which had 16 valves, all engines were the older SOHC units which meant relatively low city MPG figures. Even the popular 1.1i engine would struggle to achieve more than 35 to 40mpg in town when driven carefully.

The real world consumption between the smaller engines and the nippy 1.4i Westcoast/Furio variant was hardly noticeable, however the insurance premiums were. The early 1.0i was quite under powered, with the 1.1i being considered much better, since it was nearly 200cc larger and had roughly 30% more torque.

There were three sport models of the Saxo:

* The Westcoast, later replaced by the Furio which featured a 1.4I 8V engine with a top speed of 175 km/h (109 mph), and a 0-62.5 mph (0–100 km/h) time of 11.2 seconds.
* The VTR MK1 (1997–1999) featured a fuel injected, 1.6-liter 8-valve engine with a top speed of 187 km/h (116 mph) and a 0-62.5 mph (0–100 km/h) time of 10.0 seconds. The VTR MK2 (1999–2003) featured a 1.6I 8V engine with a top speed of 193 km/h (120 mph) and a 0-62.5 mph (0–100 km/h) time of 9.4 seconds.
* The VTS 16V featured a 1.6I engine with a top speed of 205 km/h (127 mph), and a 0 to 60 mph time of 7.8 seconds. The VTS MK1 (1997–1999) and MK2 (1999–2003) shared similar performance, although the MK2 was slightly slower due to it being marginally heavier.
These models included vented front brake discs, with the VTR and VTS also having rear brake discs (solid discs). Also, a different style of control arms and struts was used for the suspension. The VTS had a master brake cylinder, and the VTR and Westcoast/Furio had a .

The VTS had a front anti roll bar and rear anti roll bar, while the VTR and Westcoast/Furio had a front and or sometimes rear antiroll bar. In addition, all the sports models featured a unique bodykit to the other models, commonly known as the &quot;VT&quot; bodykit.

In 1997, the Saxo&#x27;s three speed automatic gearbox was combined with the 1.6i 8V engine which was available on the Saxo SX and VSX. Then, in the end of 1997, the 1.6i automatic was replaced with a 1.4i engine. The 1.6i was more powerful with a top speed of 176 km/h (109MPH) compared with the 1.4&#x27;s top speed of .

Citroën carried on using the 1.4i engine on the facelift Saxo Automatic in 1999. Due to the C3 having a 1.4i automatic gearbox, the Saxo Automatic came to an end in March 2002, whilst the manual models were still sold right up to the end of 2003.

* 1.0 L (954 cc) &quot;TU9&quot; I4, and 
* 1.1 L (1124 cc) &quot;TU1&quot; I4, and 
* 1.4 L (1360 cc) &quot;TU3&quot; I4, and 
* 1.5 L (1527 cc) &quot;TUD5&quot; diesel I4, and 
* 1.6 L (1587 cc) &quot;TU5&quot; I4, and 
* 1.6 L (1587 cc) &quot;TU5&quot; I4, and (later VTR models)
* 1.6 L (1587 cc) &quot;TU5&quot; I4, and 

===Interior and equipment===

The equipment list was generally sparse, with budget models having drivers airbag, seat belt pre tensioners, cassette player, heated rear screen and tinted windows, and early Mark Ones with keypad immobilisers and a clock in place of a tachometer and three stud wheels, much like the AX. Further up the list sunroofs, PAS, Electric windows, ultrasonic alarm, passenger airbag, CD player, tachometer, front fog lights, bodykits, colour coded mirror caps and alloy wheels were added, to name a few.

Although MK2 Saxos were generally better equipped than their older counterparts, the interiors were still dated in comparison to other small hatchbacks of the time, such as the Vauxhall Corsa, with many of the center console controls originating from the older model of the Citroën AX.

The 1.6L VTR and VTS Saxos were the best equipped, with both gaining rear disc brakes as opposed to drum brakes, and ABS as standard for the VTS and an optional extra on all other 1.6-liter models.

Few special models were released throughout the Saxo&#x27;s life, most notably the &quot;Open Scandal&quot;, a Saxo with a full-length sliding canvas roof. Other special editions added certain extras to the lower end model, such as sunroofs or PAS. Notable models are the Westcoast up to 1999 and the Furio to 2003, as they incorporated the standard Saxo bodykit found on the VTR and VTS with a more insurance friendly 1.4-liter engine. The Westcoast is not to be confused with the Eastcoast, which was only available in the 1.0L and later 1.1L engines. The Eastcoast also did not incorporate the &quot;VT&quot; bodykit.

Air conditioning was never an option on right hand drive Saxos because the blower motor was mounted in the bulk head on the driver&#x27;s side. As a result, there was insufficient space available to accommodate the evaporator, except by first ducting the air flow to the passenger&#x27;s side and then at the expense of the glove box.

Although an after market kit was available that did exactly this, the resultant pressure loss made the system noisy and ineffective. The blower motor could also not be easily relocated, since the windscreen wiper motor was mounted in the passenger&#x27;s side space.

In September 1999, the Saxo received a facelift, commonly branded as a Mark II, with the major differences being more modern styled headlights, bonnet and grille to replace the square style on the MK1 and multipoint injection replacing the single point on the 1.1-liter engines. In September 2000, it was a Euro NCAP sufferer of poor results, along with its twin, the 106.

Power steering became standard on all but the very basic models. More subtle changes were alterations to the rear lights (the indicator sections are more &quot;white&quot;) and the engine control unit moved from a single plug to three plugs. The old three-stud wheel layout, as used on the Citroën AX, was also dropped. There was also a minor facelift, during the first phase of the car&#x27;s production, in line with the then current releases by Citroën, moving towards a rounder look.

While the exterior was markedly altered, little changed inside the vehicle. The dashboard and glovebox arrangement remained the same with the possibility of installing a passenger-side airbag in some high range models.

By 2003, some buyers were more attracted to the spacious, and practical five-door C3. However, the 1.6 VTR and VTS models remained popular. The Saxo finally finished production in September 2003, when the three-door C2 was launched. Its twin, the Peugeot 106, also ceased production at this time. By the end of the Saxo&#x27;s production life, its design was seven years old.

===Drag coefficient===
The Saxo has a drag coefficient of . In addition its frontal area is 1.83 m2, giving it a CdA ft² of 6.68.

<text>The European golden plover (Pluvialis apricaria), also known as the Eurasian golden plover, or just the golden plover within Europe, is a relatively large species of plover. This species is similar to two other golden plovers, the American golden plover, &quot;Pluvialis dominica&quot;, and Pacific golden plover, &quot;Pluvialis fulva&quot;, which are both slightly smaller, slimmer and longer-legged than European golden plover, and both have grey rather than white axillary (armpit) feathers (visible in flight, and when the bird stretches its wings on the ground).

==Taxonomy==
The European golden plover was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the other plovers in the genus &quot;Charadrius&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Charadrius apricarius&quot;. The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Pluvialis&quot; that was introduced in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The genus name is Latin and means &quot;relating to rain&quot;, from &quot;pluvia&quot;, &quot;rain&quot;. It was believed that golden plovers flocked when rain was imminent. The species name &quot; apricaria&quot; is Latin and means &quot;to bask in the sun&quot;. The European golden plover is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The European golden plover is quite thickset, with its wings only being slightly longer than its tail. Its most distinct feature is a white &quot;s&quot;-shaped band stretching from its forehead to its flanks.

==Distribution and habitat==
The European golden plover tends to breed in the Arctic tundra and other moorland areas, ranging as far west as Iceland, where they are called Heiðlóa, and as far east as central Siberia; the southernmost breed in Wales and Belarus, after a small breeding population on Dartmoor in southwest England became extinct in about 2010.

In winter, it migrates southwest to milder regions of Europe, northwest Africa, and southwest Asia, from Ireland east to Denmark, and south to the Mediterranean region as far as Algeria, northern Egypt, and the Caspian Sea coast of Iran. It tends to gather in large flocks in open areas, agricultural plains, ploughed land, and short meadows. Vagrants have been recorded west to the east coast of Canada (Newfoundland, Nova Scotia), south to Gambia, and east to Pakistan and northern India.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The European golden plover&#x27;s call is a monosyllabic, slightly descending, melancholic &quot;tuu&quot;.

Its flight action is rapid and powerful, with regular wingbeats.

In the United Kingdom, golden plover chicks rely on craneflies for feeding, while in Sweden march flies are more important.

==Status==
The European golden plover is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. Overall, the species is secure, being listed by IUCN as Least Concern, but populations on the southern fringe of the breeding range are declining or extinct in several countries, including Britain, Denmark (extinct as a breeding bird), Belgium (extinct as a breeding bird), Poland (extinct as a breeding bird), Germany, and southern Sweden. It is most abundant in Iceland, which holds about a third of the global population.

==In culture==
===Folklore===
The European golden plover spends summers in Iceland, and in Icelandic folklore, the appearance of the first plover in the country means that spring has arrived. The Icelandic media always covers the first plover sighting, which in 2017, took place on 27 March, and in 2020, on 16 March.

===Origin of Guinness World Records===
On 10 November 1951, Sir Hugh Beaver, then the managing director of the Guinness Breweries, went on a shooting party in the North Slob, by the River Slaney in County Wexford, Ireland. After missing a shot at a Eurasian golden plover, he became involved in an argument over which was the fastest game bird in Europe, the golden plover or the red grouse (the former being correct). That evening at Castlebridge House, he realised that it was impossible to confirm in reference books whether or not the golden plover was Europe&#x27;s fastest game bird. Beaver knew that there must be numerous other questions debated nightly in pubs throughout Ireland, but there was no book in the world with which to settle arguments about records. He realised then that a book supplying the answers to this sort of question might prove popular. A Guinness employee told Sir Hugh of two twin brothers, Norris and Ross McWhirter, who had opened a fact checking agency in London. Sir Hugh interviewed the brothers and, impressed by their prodigious knowledge, commissioned the book. Later, he published the first Guinness World Records which became a best seller within months.

<text>Eugene Andrew Cernan (; March 14, 1934 – January 16, 2017) was an American astronaut, naval aviator, electrical engineer, aeronautical engineer, and fighter pilot. During the Apollo 17 mission, Cernan became the 11th human being to walk on the Moon. As he re-entered the Apollo Lunar Module after Harrison Schmitt on their third and final lunar excursion, he remains the most recent person to walk on the Moon.

Before becoming an astronaut, Cernan graduated with a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering from Purdue University in Indiana, and joined the U.S. Navy through the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC). After flight training, he received his naval aviator wings and served as a fighter pilot. In 1963, he received a master of science degree in aeronautical engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. Achieving the rank of captain, he retired from the Navy in 1976.

Cernan traveled into space three times and to the Moon twice: as pilot of Gemini 9A in June 1966, as lunar module pilot of Apollo 10 in May 1969, and as commander of Apollo 17 in December 1972, the final Apollo lunar landing. Cernan was also a backup crew member of the Gemini 12, Apollo 7 and Apollo 14 space missions.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Cernan was born on March 14, 1934, in Chicago, Illinois; he was the son of Andrew George Cernan (1904–1967) and Rose Cernan (&quot;née&quot; Cihlar; 1898–1991). His father was of Slovak descent and his mother was of Czech ancestry. He had one older sister, Dolores Ann (1929–2019). Cernan grew up in the Illinois towns of Bellwood and Maywood. He was a Boy Scout and earned the rank of Second Class. After attending McKinley Elementary School in Bellwood, and graduating from Proviso Township High School in Maywood in 1952, he studied at Purdue University where he became a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, serving as a treasurer. At Purdue, Cernan was also president of the Quarterdeck Society and the Scabbard and Blade, and a member Tau Beta Pi engineering honor society. He was on the military ball committee and was a member of the Skull and Crescent leadership honor society. After his sophomore year, he accepted a partial Navy ROTC scholarship that required him to serve aboard between his junior and senior years. In 1956, Cernan received a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering; his final GPA was 5.1 out of 6.0.

=== Navy service ===
Cernan was commissioned a U.S. Navy Ensign through the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) at Purdue, and was initially stationed on the . Cernan changed to active duty and attended flight training at Whiting Field, Florida, Barron Field, Texas, NAS Corpus Christi, Texas, and NAS Memphis, Tennessee. Following flight training on the T-28 Trojan, T-33 Shooting Star, and F9F Panther, Cernan became a Naval Aviator, flying FJ-4 Fury and A-4 Skyhawk jets in Attack Squadrons 126 and 113. Upon completion of his assignment in NAS Miramar, California, he finished his education in 1963 at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School with a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering.

During his naval career, Cernan logged more than 5,000 hours of flying time, including 4,800 hours in jet aircraft. Cernan also made at least 200 successful landings on aircraft carriers.

===NASA career===
In October 1963, NASA selected Cernan as one of the third group of astronauts to participate in the Gemini and Apollo space programs.

====Gemini program====

Cernan was originally selected with Thomas Stafford as backup pilot for Gemini 9. When the prime crew of Elliot See and Charles Bassett was killed in the crash of NASA T-38A &quot;901&quot; (USAF serial 63–8181) at Lambert Field, Missouri, on February 28, 1966, the backup crew became the prime crew—the first time in NASA history this happened. Gemini 9A encountered a number of problems; the original target vehicle exploded during launch and the planned docking with a substitute target vehicle was made impossible by the failure of a protective shroud to separate after launch. The crew performed a rendezvous that simulated procedures that would be used in the Apollo 10 mission; the first optical rendezvous and a lunar-orbit-abort rendezvous. Cernan performed the second American EVA, the third-ever spacewalk, but overexertion caused by a lack of limb restraints prevented testing of the Astronaut Maneuvering Unit and forced the early termination of the spacewalk. Cernan was also a backup pilot for the Gemini 12 mission.

====Apollo program====
=====Apollo 10=====
Cernan was selected as the backup lunar module pilot for Apollo 7—although that flight carried no lunar module. Standard crew rotation put him in place as the Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 10—the final dress rehearsal mission for the first Apollo lunar landing—on May 18–26, 1969.

During the Apollo 10 mission, Cernan and his commander, Tom Stafford, piloted the Lunar Module &quot;Snoopy&quot; in lunar orbit to within of the lunar surface, and successfully executed every phase of a lunar landing up to final powered descent. This provided NASA planners with critical knowledge of technical systems and lunar gravitational conditions to enable Apollo 11 to land on the Moon two months later. Apollo 10 holds the record for the highest speed attained by any crewed vehicle at – more than 11 km per second — during its return from the Moon on May 26, 1969.

=====Apollo 17=====

Cernan declined the opportunity to walk on the Moon as Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 16, preferring to risk missing a flight for the opportunity to command his own mission. Cernan moved back into the Apollo rotation as commander of the backup crew of Cernan, Ronald E. Evans, and Joe Engle for Apollo 14, putting him in position through normal crew rotation to command his own crew on Apollo 17. Escalating budget cutbacks for NASA brought the number of future missions into question. After the Apollo 18 and Apollo 19 missions were cancelled in September 1970, pressure from the scientific community to shift Harrison Schmitt, the sole professional geologist in the active Apollo roster of astronauts, to the crew of Apollo 17, the final scheduled Apollo mission, mounted. In August 1971, NASA named Schmitt as the lunar module pilot for Apollo 17, which meant the original LM pilot Joe Engle lost his opportunity to walk on the Moon. Cernan fought to keep his crew together; given the choice of flying with Schmitt as LMP or seeing his entire crew removed from Apollo 17, Cernan chose to fly with Schmitt. Cernan eventually came to have a positive evaluation of Schmitt&#x27;s abilities; he concluded that Schmitt was an outstanding LM pilot while Engle—notwithstanding his outstanding record as an aircraft test pilot—was merely an adequate one.

Cernan&#x27;s role as commander of Apollo 17 closed out the Apollo program&#x27;s lunar exploration mission with a number of record-setting achievements. During the three days of Apollo 17&#x27;s surface activity (11-14 December 1972), Cernan and Schmitt performed three EVAs for a total of about 22 hours of exploration of the Taurus–Littrow valley. Their first EVA alone was more than three times the length astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin spent outside the LM on Apollo 11. During this time, Cernan and Schmitt covered more than using the Lunar Roving Vehicle and spent a great deal of time collecting geologic samples (including a record of samples, the most of any Apollo mission) that would shed light on the Moon&#x27;s early history. Cernan piloted the rover on its final sortie, recording a maximum speed of , giving him the unofficial lunar land speed record.

As Cernan prepared to climb the ladder for the final time, he spoke these words, currently the last spoken by a human being standing on the lunar surface:
Cernan&#x27;s status as the last person to walk on the Moon means Purdue University is the &quot;alma mater&quot; of both the first person to walk on the Moon (i.e, Neil Armstrong) and the most recent. Cernan is one of only three astronauts to travel to the Moon on two occasions, along with Jim Lovell and John Young. He is also one of only twelve people to have walked on the Moon, as well as the only person to have flown in two different Apollo Lunar Modules in space while not docked to the Apollo Command and Service Module, both times near the Moon.

===Post-NASA activities===

In 1976, Cernan retired from the Navy with the rank of captain and went from NASA into private business, becoming Executive Vice President of Coral Petroleum Inc. before starting his own company, The Cernan Corporation, in 1981. In 1981 and 1982, Cernan joined Frank Reynolds and Jules Bergman on the extensive ABC coverage of the first 3 Space Shuttle launches. Many hours of these ABC broadcasts have been uploaded to YouTube in recent years. From 1987 he was a contributor to ABC News and the weekly segment of its &quot;Good Morning America&quot; program titled &quot;Breakthrough&quot;, which covered health, science, and medicine.

In 1999, with co-author Donald A. Davis, he published his memoir &quot;The Last Man on the Moon,&quot; which is about his naval and NASA career. He is featured in the space exploration documentary &quot;In the Shadow of the Moon&quot; in which he said, &quot;truth needs no defense&quot; and &quot;nobody can take those footsteps I made on the surface of the Moon away from me&quot;. Cernan also contributed to the book of the same name.

Cernan and Neil Armstrong testified before U.S. Congress in 2010 in opposition to the cancellation of the Constellation program, which had been initiated during the George W. Bush administration as part of the Vision for Space Exploration with the aim of returning humans to the Moon and eventually Mars, but was deemed underfunded and unsustainable by the Augustine Commission in 2009.

Cernan paired his criticism of the cancellation of Constellation with expressions of skepticism about Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) and Commercial Crew Development (CCDev), NASA&#x27;s planned replacements for that program&#x27;s role in supplying cargo and crew to the International Space Station. Such companies, Cernan warned, &quot;do not yet know what they don&#x27;t know.&quot; Cernan&#x27;s view of commercial space companies—in particular SpaceX, which participates in both programs—underwent a positive shift after being debriefed by SpaceX venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson as part of his effort to obtain the signatures of nine Apollo astronauts on a photograph meant as a gift to SpaceX founder Elon Musk to commemorate the first successful SpaceX cargo mission to the ISS in 2012. Eventually, Cernan was won over and signed the photograph; &quot;As I told him these stories of heroic entrepreneurship, I could see his mind turning.&quot; Jurvetson wrote; &quot;He found a reconciliation: &#x27;I never read any of this in the news. Why doesn&#x27;t the press report on this?&#x27;&quot;

Cernan gave a eulogy at Armstrong&#x27;s funeral in 2012.

In 2014, Cernan appeared in the documentary &quot;The Last Man on the Moon,&quot; made by British filmmaker Mark Craig and based on Cernan&#x27;s 1999 memoir of the same title. The film received the Texas Independent Film Award from Houston Film Critics Society and the Movies for Grownups Award from &quot;AARP The Magazine&quot;.

===Personal life===
Cernan was married twice and had one daughter. His first wife was Barbara Jean Atchley, a flight attendant for Continental Airlines, whom he married in 1961. They had one daughter, Tracy (born in 1963). The couple separated in 1980 and divorced in 1981. They remained friends. His second marriage was to Janis Ellen &quot;Nanna&quot; Cernan (&quot;née&quot; Jones; 1939–2021), which lasted for nearly 30 years from 1987 until his death. Cernan gained two step-daughters, Kelly and Danielle.

====Death====
Cernan died in a hospital in Houston on January 16, 2017, at the age of 82. His funeral was held at St. Martin&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Houston. He was buried with full military honors at Texas State Cemetery, the first astronaut to be buried there, in a private service on January 25, 2017.

==Organizations==
Cernan was a member of several organizations, including Fellow, American Astronautical Society; member, Society of Experimental Test Pilots; member, Tau Beta Pi (National Engineering Society), Sigma Xi (National Science Research Society), Phi Gamma Delta (National Social Fraternity), and The Explorers Club.

==In popular culture==
On July 2, 1974, Cernan was a roaster of Don Rickles on &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot;. At the end of the roast, Rickles—who attended the Apollo 17 launch—paid tribute to Cernan as a &quot;delightful, wonderful, great hero&quot;.

In the 1998 Primetime Emmy Award-winning HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, Cernan was portrayed by Daniel Hugh Kelly.

The audio commentary for the Criterion Collection release of the film &quot;For All Mankind&quot; was recorded by Cernan and director Al Reinert in 1999.

Cernan was featured in the Discovery Channel&#x27;s 2008 documentary miniseries &quot;When We Left Earth: The NASA Missions&quot;, talking about his involvement and missions as an astronaut.

A popular belief is that Cernan wrote his daughter&#x27;s initials on a rock on the Moon, Tracy&#x27;s Rock. The story, and Cernan&#x27;s relationship with his daughter, was later adapted into &quot;Tracy&#x27;s Song&quot; by pop-rock band No More Kings. The story is inaccurate, as Cernan wrote her initials in the dust, not on a rock. He states in the 2014 documentary &quot;The Last Man on the Moon&quot; that he wrote them in the lunar dust as he left the rover to return to the LM and Earth. The true story of leaving the initials on the lunar surface was prominently mentioned in &quot;The Last Walt&quot;, a 2012 episode of &quot;Modern Family&quot;.

A recording of Cernan&#x27;s voice during the Apollo 17 mission was sampled by Daft Punk for &quot;Contact&quot;, the last track on their 2013 album &quot;Random Access Memories&quot;. Cernan&#x27;s last words from the lunar surface, along with Lunar Module Pilot Harrison Schmitt&#x27;s recollections, were used by the band Public Service Broadcasting for the song &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, the final track of their 2015 album &quot;The Race for Space&quot;.

The Apple TV+ show &quot;For All Mankind&quot; dramatizes the Moon landings. The fictional main character draws comparisons to and shares similarity with the commander of the Apollo 17 mission, Gene Cernan.

<text>The Pacific golden plover (Pluvialis fulva) is a migratory shorebird that breeds during summer in Alaska and Siberia. During nonbreeding season, this medium-sized plover migrates widely across the Pacific.

==Taxonomy==
The Pacific golden plover was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the other plovers in the genus &quot;Charadrius&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Charadrius fulvus&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Fulvous plover&quot; that had been described in 1785 by the English ornithologist John Latham from specimens from Tahiti. The Pacific golden plover is now placed in the genus &quot;Pluvialis&quot; that was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The genus name is Latin and means relating to rain, from &quot;pluvia&quot;, &#x27;rain&#x27;. It was believed that the plovers flocked when rain was imminent. The specific epithet is also from Latin and means &#x27;tawny&#x27; or &#x27;yellowish-brown&#x27;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

== Description ==
Adults are about long with a wingspan averaging At their lightest, fat free, the birds weigh around In March, the birds begin gaining weight. Before leaving for their Arctic breeding grounds, the birds weigh about 

In breeding plumage, the male is spotted gold and black on the crown, back, and wings. Face and neck are black bordered with white, breast is black, rump is dark. Bill is black, legs are gray to black. Female similar but black breast mottled and less distinct.

In nonbreeding plumage, sexes look identical. The black on the face and breast bordered by white is replaced with dark brown, gray, and yellowish patterning and lighter underparts.

Molt to breeding plumage begins in March and April, prior to migration. Molt to nonbreeding plumage begins in the Arctic during egg incubation.

Downy chicks are spotted gold and black on head and back with whitish yellow underparts. Legs and feet are adult size at hatching.

Similar birds are the European golden plover, &quot;Pluvialis apricaria&quot;, and the American golden plover, &quot;Pluvialis dominica&quot;. The Pacific golden plover is more similar to the American golden plover, with which it was once considered the lesser golden plover. The Pacific golden plover is slimmer than the American golden plover, has longer legs, and usually has more yellow on the back.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Pacific golden plover is migratory, and breeds during May, June, and July in Alaska and Siberia. It migrates south to Asia, Australasia, and Pacific islands in August and September, and stays until April or May. A rare vagrant to western Europe.

Although a shorebird, the Pacific golden plover feeds mostly inland, preferring open spaces with short vegetation. During the breeding season, the Arctic tundra provides insects and berries for food, and effective camouflage for predator avoidance.

In Hawaii, Pacific golden plovers, known locally as kōlea, have adapted remarkably to human presence and to human alteration of the natural environment including, backyards, parks, cemeteries, rooftops, pastures, and golf courses. Because kōlea are site-faithful, each bird returns to, and defends, the same territory year after year, resulting in people observing the comings and goings of the kōlea with special interest. Some observers name and feed their birds, and some birds become tame around their caretakers. The oldest kōlea recorded lived to be at least 21 years, 3 months; its age was unknown at banding.

Kōlea are the subject of a Hawaii Audubon Society&#x27;s citizen science project called Kōlea Count, www.koleacount.org. The birds&#x27; habit of returning to the same territory each year allows scientists in Hawaiʻi to attach tiny light level geolocator devices to the birds and retrieve them the following year in the same location. Such research showed that the birds made the nonstop flight between Alaska and Hawai&#x27;i in 3–4 days.

Pacific golden plovers gather in flocks some days prior to migrating north, and fly at altitudes of about to as high as . Some birds do not migrate. These are usually first-year, older, injured individuals, or birds without enough fat reserves to make the journey.

==Behavior and ecology==
=== Breeding ===
The Pacific golden plover breeds in Arctic tundra areas of Siberia and western Alaska. Males usually arrive first, possibly returning to, and defending, the same territory each year. Some males and females appear to arrive paired. Females have been observed searching for breeding partners on the tundra. The male builds a nest of lichen, moss, and grasses, in shallow scrapes on the ground in a dry open area. The female lays 4 eggs, buff-colored with splotches of black and brown. Both male and female share incubation, care of young, and defense from foxes and avian predators.

Soon after hatching, chicks leave the nest to forage, returning to the parent birds to seek warmth and shelter. When juveniles are capable of flight around 26–28 days after hatching, parent birds begin leaving to migrate south. Females usually depart first. Flocks of juveniles remain, making the migration sometimes as late as October and November depending on Arctic weather. First-year birds migrate by instinct, confronting the vagaries of weather during their long southward flights. Once landed, they must compete with each other and established adults for foraging ground.

=== Food and feeding ===
It forages on tundra, in mowed grass, and on beaches and tidal flats, eating nearly anything that crawls including insects, spiders, mollusks, crustaceans, and small reptiles, as well as berries, leaves, and seeds. Foraging pace is a repeated run-stop-peck. Most wintering birds feed singly within an established territory. Non-territorial birds feed in loose groups.

== Conservation ==
The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species dated 10/01/16 assessed the Pacific golden plover to be a species of Least Concern globally. However, the population trend is decreasing, the main threat being a global shift in habitat and alteration due to climate change and severe weather.

<text>Varicella zoster virus (VZV), also known as human herpesvirus 3 (HHV-3, HHV3), is one of nine known herpes viruses that can infect humans. It causes chickenpox (varicella) commonly affecting children and young adults, and shingles (herpes zoster) in adults but rarely in children. As a late complication of VZV infection, Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2 may develop in rare cases. VZV infections are species-specific to humans. The virus can survive in external environments for a few hours.

VZV multiplies in the tonsils, and causes a wide variety of symptoms. Similar to the herpes simplex viruses, after primary infection with VZV (chickenpox), the virus lies dormant in neurons, including the cranial nerve ganglia, dorsal root ganglia, and autonomic ganglia. Many years after the person has recovered from initial chickenpox infection, VZV can &quot;reactivate&quot; to cause shingles.

==Epidemiology==
===Chickenpox===

Primary varicella zoster virus infection results in chickenpox (varicella), which may result in complications including encephalitis, pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia), or bronchitis (either viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis). Even when clinical symptoms of chickenpox have resolved, VZV remains dormant in the nervous system of the infected person (virus latency), in the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia. VZV enters through the respiratory system and has an incubation period of 10–21 days, with an average of 14 days. Targeting the skin and peripheral nerves, the period of illness lasts about 3 to 4 days. Infected individuals are most contagious 1–2 days before the lesions appear. Signs and symptoms include vesicles that fill with pus, rupture, and scab before healing. Lesions most commonly occur on the face, throat, the lower back, the chest and shoulders.

===Shingles===
In about a third of cases, VZV reactivates in later life, producing a disease known as shingles or herpes zoster. The individual lifetime risk of developing herpes zoster is thought to be between 20% and 30%, or approximately 1 in 4 people. However, for people aged 85 and over, this risk increases to 1 in 2.
In a study in Sweden by Nilsson et al. (2015) the annual incidence of herpes zoster infection is estimated at a total of 315 cases per 100,000 inhabitants for all ages and 577 cases per 100,000 for people 50 years of age or older.

VZV can also infect the central nervous system, with a 2013 article reporting an incidence rate of 1.02 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Switzerland, and an annual incidence rate of 1.8 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Sweden.

Shingles lesions and the associated pain, often described as burning, tend to occur on the skin that is innervated by one or two adjacent sensory nerves, almost always on one side of the body only. The skin lesions usually subside over the course of several weeks, while the pain often persists longer. In 10–15% of cases the pain persists more than three months, a chronic and often disabling condition known as postherpetic neuralgia. Other serious complications of varicella zoster infection include Mollaret&#x27;s meningitis, zoster multiplex, and inflammation of arteries in the brain leading to stroke, myelitis, herpes ophthalmicus, or zoster sine herpete. In Ramsay Hunt syndrome, VZV affects the geniculate ganglion giving lesions that follow specific branches of the facial nerve. Symptoms may include painful blisters on the tongue and ear along with one-sided facial weakness and hearing loss. After infection during initial stages of pregnancy, the fetus can be severely damaged. Reye&#x27;s syndrome can happen after initial infection, causing continuous vomiting and signs of brain dysfunction such as extreme drowsiness or combative behavior. In some cases, death or coma can follow. Reye&#x27;s syndrome mostly affects children and teenagers; using aspirin during infection can increase this risk.

==Morphology==
VZV is closely related to the herpes simplex viruses (HSV), sharing much genome homology. The known envelope glycoproteins (gB, gC, gE, gH, gI, gK, gL) correspond with those in HSV; however, there is no equivalent of the HSV gD protein. VZV also fails to produce the LAT (latency-associated transcripts) that play an important role in establishing HSV &quot;latency&quot; (herpes simplex virus). VZV virions are spherical and 180–200 nm in diameter. Their lipid envelope encloses the 100 nm nucleocapsid of 162 hexameric and pentameric capsomeres arranged in an icosahedral form. Its DNA is a single, linear, double-stranded molecule, 125,000 nt long. The capsid is surrounded by loosely associated proteins known collectively as the tegument; many of these proteins play critical roles in initiating the process of virus reproduction in the infected cell. The tegument is in turn covered by a lipid envelope studded with glycoproteins that are displayed on the exterior of the virion, each approximately 8 nm long.

==Genomes==

The genome was first sequenced in 1986. It is a linear duplex DNA molecule, a laboratory strain has 124,884 base pairs. The genome has two predominant isomers, depending on the orientation of the S segment, P (prototype) and IS (inverted S) which are present with equal frequency for a total frequency of 90–95%. The L segment can also be inverted resulting in a total of four linear isomers (IL and ILS). This is distinct from HSV&#x27;s equiprobable distribution, and the discriminatory mechanism is not known. A small percentage of isolated molecules are circular genomes, about which little is known. (It is known that HSV circularizes on infection.) There are at least 70 open reading frames in the genome.

==Evolution==

Commonality with HSV1 and HSV2 indicates a common ancestor; five genes (out of about 70) do not have corresponding HSV genes. Relation with other human herpes viruses is less strong, but many homologues and conserved gene blocks are still found.

There are at least five clades of this virus. Clades 1 and 3 include European/North American strains; clade 2 are Asian strains, especially from Japan; and clade 5 appears to be based in India. Clade 4 includes some strains from Europe but its geographic origins need further clarification. There are also four genotypes that do not fit into these clades. Allocation of VZV strains to clades required the sequence of whole virus genome. Practically all molecular epidemiological data on global VZV strains distribution are obtained with targeted sequencing of selected regions.

Phylogenetic analysis of VZV genomic sequences resolves wild-type strains into nine genotypes (E1, E2, J, M1, M2, M3, M4, VIII and IX). Complete sequences for M3 and M4 strains are unavailable, but targeted analyses of representative strains suggest they are stable, circulating VZV genotypes. Sequence analysis of VZV isolates identified both shared and specific markers for every genotype and validated a unified VZV genotyping strategy. Despite high genotype diversity no evidence for intra-genotypic recombination was observed. Five of seven VZV genotypes were reliably discriminated using only four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) present in ORF22, and the E1 and E2 genotypes were resolved using SNP located in ORF21, ORF22 or ORF50. Sequence analysis of 342 clinical varicella and zoster specimens from 18 European countries identified the following distribution of VZV genotypes: E1, 221 (65%); E2, 87 (25%); M1, 20 (6%); M2, 3 (1%); M4, 11 (3%). No M3 or J strains were observed. Of 165 clinical varicella and zoster isolates from Australia and New Zealand typed using this approach, 67 of 127 eastern Australian isolates were E1, 30 were E2, 16 were J, 10 were M1, and 4 were M2; 25 of 38 New Zealand isolates were E1, 8 were E2, and 5 were M1.

The mutation rate for synonymous and nonsynonymous mutation rates among the herpesviruses have been estimated at 1 × 10−7 and 2.7 × 10−8 mutations/site/year, respectively, based on the highly conserved gB gene.

==Treatment==
Within the human body it can be treated by a number of drugs and therapeutic agents including acyclovir for chickenpox, famciclovir, valaciclovir for the shingles, zoster-immune globulin (ZIG), and vidarabine. Acyclovir is frequently used as the drug of choice in primary VZV infections, and beginning its administration early can significantly shorten the duration of any symptoms. However, reaching an effective serum concentration of acyclovir typically requires intravenous administration, making its use more difficult outside of a hospital.

==Vaccination==

A live attenuated VZV Oka/Merck strain vaccine is available and is marketed in the United States under the trade name Varivax. It was developed by Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme in the 1980s from the Oka strain virus isolated and attenuated by Michiaki Takahashi and colleagues in the 1970s. It was submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval in 1990 and was approved in 1995. Since then, it has been added to the recommended vaccination schedules for children in Australia, the United States, and many other countries. Varicella vaccination has raised concerns in some that the immunity induced by the vaccine may not be lifelong, possibly leaving adults vulnerable to more severe disease as the immunity from their childhood immunization wanes. Vaccine coverage in the United States in the population recommended for vaccination is approaching 90%, with concomitant reductions in the incidence of varicella cases and hospitalizations and deaths due to VZV. So far, clinical data has proved that the vaccine is effective for over ten years in preventing varicella infection in healthy individuals, and when breakthrough infections do occur, illness is typically mild. In 2006, the CDC&#x27;s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended a second dose of vaccine before school entry to ensure the maintenance of high levels of varicella immunity.

In 2006, the FDA approved Zostavax for the prevention of shingles. Zostavax is a more concentrated formulation of the Varivax vaccine, designed to elicit an immune response in older adults whose immunity to VZV wanes with advancing age. A systematic review by Cochrane (updated in 2023) shows that Zostavax reduces the incidence of shingles by almost 50%.

Shingrix is a subunit vaccine (HHV3 glycoprotein E) developed by GlaxoSmithKline which was approved in the United States by the FDA in October 2017. The ACIP recommended Shingrix for adults over the age of 50, including those who have already received Zostavax. The committee voted that Shingrix is preferred over Zostavax for the prevention of zoster and related complications because phase 3 clinical data showed vaccine efficacy of &gt;90% against shingles across all age groups, as well as sustained efficacy over a four-year follow-up. Unlike Zostavax, which is given as a single shot, Shingrix is given as two intramuscular doses, two to six months apart. This vaccine has shown to be immunogenic and safe in adults with human immunodeficiency virus.

==History==

Chickenpox-like rashes were recognized and described by ancient civilizations; the relationship between zoster and chickenpox was not realized until 1888. In 1943, the similarity between virus particles isolated from the lesions of zoster and those from chickenpox was noted. In 1974 the first chickenpox vaccine was introduced.

The varicella zoster virus was first isolated by Evelyn Nicol while she was working at Cleveland City Hospital. Thomas Huckle Weller also isolated the virus and found evidence that the same virus was responsible for both chickenpox and herpes zoster.

The etymology of the name of the virus comes from the two diseases it causes, varicella and herpes zoster. The word &quot;varicella&quot; is possibly derived from &quot;variola&quot;, a term for smallpox coined by Rudolph Augustin Vogel in 1764.

<text>The knowledge gap hypothesis is a mass communication theory based on how a member in society processes information from mass media differently based on education level and socioeconomic status (SES). The gap in knowledge exists because a member of society with higher socioeconomic status has access to higher education and technology whereas a member of society who has a lower socioeconomic status has less access or none at all. Since there is already pre-existing gap of knowledge between groups in a population, mass media amplifies this gap to another level. For example, television news programming targets a more affluent group who are interested in political and science news. The higher status viewer pays more attention to the serious stories and seeks out more in depth information beyond the news program. This article provides an overview of the Knowledge Gap Hypothesis and includes theoretical concepts, historical background, operationalization, narrative review, meta-analytic support, new communication technologies and competing hypotheses.

==Theoretical Concepts==

As originally proposed in 1970 by three University of Minnesota researchers, Phillip J. Tichenor, Associate Professor of Journalism and Mass Communication, George A. Donohue, Professor of Sociology, and Clarice N. Olien, Instructor in Sociology, the hypothesis predicts that &quot;as the infusion of mass media information into a social system increases, segments of the population with higher socioeconomic status tend to acquire this information at a faster rate than the lower status segments, so that the gap in knowledge between these segments tends to increase rather than decrease&quot;. (Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien 1970, pp. 159–160).

Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien suggest 5 factors why the knowledge gap should exist:

# Communication skills: &quot;Persons with more formal education would be expected to have higher reading and comprehension abilities necessary to acquire public affairs or science knowledge.&quot; (Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien 1970, pp. 162) For example, higher socioeconomic status, SES, people generally have more education, which improves their reading, writing, and comprehension skills.
# Amount of stored information: &quot;Persons who are already better informed are more likely to be aware of a topic when it appears in mass media and are better prepared to understand it.&quot;(Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien 1970, pp. 162) For example, more informed people are more likely to already know of news stories through previous media exposure or through formal education and can relate new information to past exposure.
# Relevant social contact: &quot;Education generally indicates a broader sphere of everyday activity, a greater number of reference groups and more interpersonal contacts, which increase the likelihood of discussing public affairs topics with others.&quot; (Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien 1970, pp. 162) For example, higher socioeconomic status, SES, people generally have a network of friends or colleagues that are more likely to have access to more information on news stories and more skilled to research the topics.
# Selective exposure, acceptance, and retention of information: &quot;A persistent theme in mass media research is the apparent tendency to interpret and recall information in ways congruent with existing beliefs and values.&quot;(Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien 1970, pp. 162) For example, a viewer of a news program will pay attention more to story that interests them.
# Nature of the mass media system that delivers information. Different media has specific target markets.(Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien 1970, pp. 162) For example, social media platforms like Tik Tok targets a younger audience whereas daytime television targets an older audience. In the 1970, print media was written for an audience with a higher education level.

==Historical background==

The knowledge gap hypothesis has been implicit throughout the mass communication literature. Research published as early as the 1920s had already begun to examine the influence of individual characteristics on people&#x27;s media content preferences.

1929 William S. Gray and Ruth Munroe authors of The Reading Interests and Habits of Adults examined the education advantages of adults which influenced their reading habits. The well educated reader grasped the subject matter in newspaper articles more quickly and moved on to other types of reading materials that fit their interests. The less educated reader spent more time with the newspaper article because it took that person longer to comprehend the topic.  

1940 Paul Lazarsfeld, head of the Office of Radio Research at Columbia University, set out to examine whether (1) the total amount of time that people listened to the radio and (2) the type of content they listened to correlated with their socioeconomic status. Not only did Lazarsfeld&#x27;s data indicate people of lower socioeconomic status tended to listen to more radio programming, but also they were simultaneously less likely to listen to &quot;serious&quot; radio content.

1950 The authors: Shirley A. Star, a professor in the University of Chicago&#x27;s sociology department and Helen MacGill Hughes, a sociologist of the University of Chicago worte, &quot;Report on an Educational Campaign: The Cincinnati Plan for the United Nations&quot; discovered that while the campaign was successful in reaching better-educated people, those with less education virtually ignored the campaign. Additionally, after realizing that the highly educated people reached by the campaign also tended to be more interested in the topic, Star and Hughes suggested that knowledge, education, and interest may be interdependent.

==Hypothesis operationalization ==
According to the authors, Jack Rosenberry and Lauren A.Vicker, &quot; A hypothesis is basically a research question: the researcher needs to ask questions and answer them in order to formulate theory. The term &quot;hypothesis&quot; also can be used to describe a theory that is still in the development stage or that has not been fully researched and verified. Because of the somewhat contradictory nature of the research findings, the knowledge gap has not yet achieved theory status and is still known as a hypothesis.&quot;

Since the 1970s, many policy makers and social scientists have been concerned with how community members acquire information via mass media. Throughout the years, extensive research has been conducted and taken different approaches to researching the Knowledge Gap Hypothesis. The hypothesis operationalization consists of the following:

* For cross-sectional research, the knowledge gap hypothesis expects that &quot;&quot;at any given time&quot;, there should be a higher correlation between acquisition of knowledge and education for topics highly publicized in the media than for topics less highly publicized. Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien (1970) tested this hypothesis using an experiment in which participants were asked to read and discuss two news stories of varying publicity. The results of the experiment support the hypothesis because correlations between education and understanding were significant for high publicity stories but not significant for low publicity stories.
* For time-series research, the knowledge gap hypothesis expects that &quot;&quot;over time&quot;, acquisition of knowledge of a heavily publicized topic will proceed at a faster rate among better educated persons than among those with less education.&quot; Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien (1970) tested this hypothesis using public opinion surveys gathered between 1949 and 1965 measuring whether participants believed humans would reach the Moon in the foreseeable future. During the 15-year span, belief among grade-school educated people increased only about 25 percentage points while belief among college educated people increased more than 60 percentage points, a trend consistent with the hypothesis.

==Narrative review and meta-analytic support==

Since the 1970s, many policy makers and social scientists have been concerned with how community members acquire information via mass media. Throughout the years, extensive research has been conducted and taken different approaches to researching the Knowledge Gap Hypothesis.

Cecilie Gaziano, a researcher of Communication and Media, Quantitative Social Research and Social Stratification wrote Forecast 2000: Widening Knowledge Gaps, to update her 1983 analysis of knowledge gap studies. Gaziano discusses the connection between education and income disparities between the &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots.&quot; Gaziano conducted two narrative reviews, one of 58 articles with relevant data in 1983 and the other of 39 additional studies in 1997.

The interconnection between income, education and occupation are factors of the knowledge gap throughout history. Here is a closer look at the economic gaps caused by major economic events:

* 1929 The Stock Market Crash - causing the major economic turning point.
* 1950 Consumerism: Post WWII, automobile and television sales increased rapidly. Working and middle class families were buying televisions. All socio economic segments experienced growth.
* 1970 Stagflation: rise of inflation and recession due to oil prices, cost of Vietnam War and international competition of consumer goods caused unequal wealth distribution in the United States.
* 1997 Economic inequality for the have and have nots was greater than 1929
Hwang and Jeong (2009) conducted a meta-analysis of 46 knowledge gap studies. Consistent with Gaziano&#x27;s results, however, Hwang and Jeong found constant knowledge gaps across time. Gaziano writes, &quot;the most consistent result is the presence of knowledge differentials, regardless of topic, methodological, or theoretical variations, study excellence, or other variables and conditions&quot; (1997, p. 240). Evidence from several decades, Gaziano concludes, underscores the enduring character of knowledge gaps and indicates that they transcend topics and research settings.

Gaziano explains the conceptual framework of the knowledge barriers, the critical conceptual issues are the following measurements:

* SES Socioeconomic status: education, income, and occupation
* Knowledge
* Knowledge Gap
* Media publicity

==New Communication Technologies==
The internet has changed how people engage media. The internet-based media has to be accessed with digital devices and accessed to the internet. In the United States, there is a concern about the digital divide because not all Americans have access to the internet and devices. With the hope that Internet would close the knowledge gap, it has exposed the following inequities: access, motivation and cognitive ability. The following research displays the link between access to internet and socioeconomic status, SES.

According to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults conducted Jan. 25-Feb. 8, 2021, Emily Vogels, a research associate focusing on internet and technology, wrote, &quot;More than 30 years after the debut of the World Wide Web, internet use, broadband adoption and smartphone ownership have grown rapidly for all Americans – including those who are less well-off financially. However, the digital lives of Americans with lower and higher incomes remain markedly different.&quot;

&quot;Americans with higher household incomes are also more likely to have multiple devices that enable them to go online. Roughly six-in-ten adults living in households earning $100,000 or more a year (63%) report having home broadband services, a smartphone, a desktop or laptop computer and a tablet, compared with 23% of those living in lower-income households.&quot;

Emily Vogels, continues, &quot;The digital divide has been a central topic in tech circles for decades, with researchers, advocates and policymakers examining this issue. However, this topic has gained special attention during the coronavirus outbreak as much of daily life (such as work and school) moved online, leaving families with lower incomes more likely to face obstacles in navigating this increasing digital environment. For example, in April 2020, 59% of parents with lower incomes who had children in schools that were remote due to the pandemic said their children would likely face at least one of three digital obstacles to their schooling, such as a lack of reliable internet at home, no computer at home, or needing to use a smartphone to complete schoolwork.&quot;

<text>The two-step flow of communication model says that most people form their opinions under the influence of opinion leaders, who in turn are influenced by the mass media. In contrast to the one-step flow of the hypodermic needle model or magic bullet theory, which holds that people are directly influenced by mass media, according to the two-step flow model, ideas flow from mass media to opinion leaders, and from them to a wider population. Opinion leaders pass on their own interpretation of information in addition to the actual media content.

== Basic overview ==
The theory is based on a 1940s study on social influence that states that media effects are indirectly established through the personal influence of opinion leaders. The majority of people receive much of their information and are influenced by the media secondhand, through the personal influence of opinion leaders.

== Concept ==
The two-step model says that most people are not directly influenced by mass media, and instead form their opinions based on opinion leaders who interpret media messages and put them into context. Opinion leaders are those initially exposed to a specific media content, and who interpret it based on their own opinion. They then begin to infiltrate these opinions through the general public who become &quot;opinion followers&quot;. These &quot;opinion leaders&quot; gain their influence through more elite media as opposed to mainstream mass media. In this process, social influence is created and adjusted by the ideals and opinions of each specific &quot;elite media&quot; group, and by these media group&#x27;s opposing ideals and opinions and in combination with popular mass media sources. Therefore, the leading influence in these opinions is primarily a social persuasion.

== About ==
The two-step flow of communication model hypothesizes that ideas flow from mass media to opinion leaders, and from them to a wider population. It was first introduced by sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld &quot;et al.&quot; in 1944 and elaborated by Elihu Katz and Lazarsfeld in 1955 and subsequent publications. Melvin DeFleur and Sheoron Lowery argue the book was much more than a simple research report: it was an effort to interpret the authors&#x27; research within a framework of conceptual schemes, theoretical issues, and research findings drawn broadly from the scientific study of small groups. Unlike the hypodermic needle model, which considers mass media effects to be direct, the two-step flow model stresses human agency.

For example, in the field of science communication, Matthew Nisbet describes the use of opinion leaders as intermediaries between scientists and the public as a way to reach the public via trained individuals who are more closely engaged with their communities, such as &quot;teachers, business leaders, attorneys, policymakers, neighborhood leaders, students, and media professionals.&quot; Examples of initiatives that take this approach include Science &amp; Engineering Ambassadors, sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences, and Science Booster Clubs, coordinated by the National Center for Science Education.

According to Lazarsfeld and Katz, mass media information is channeled to the &quot;masses&quot; through opinion leadership. The people with most access to media, and having a more literate understanding of media content, explain and diffuse the content to others.

Based on the two-step flow hypothesis, the term &quot;personal influence&quot; came to illustrate the process intervening between the media&#x27;s direct message and the audience&#x27;s reaction to that message. Opinion leaders tend to be similar to those they influence—based on personality, interests, demographics, or socio-economic factors. These leaders tend to influence others to change their attitudes and behaviors. The two-step theory refined the ability to predict how media messages influence audience behavior and explains why certain media campaigns do not alter audiences&#x27; attitudes. This hypothesis provided a basis for the two-step flow theory of mass communication.

=== Contemporary debate ===

In the times of digital social media, the more than six decade old theory sparks much new interest. The fact that massive databases are being used to send tailor-made messages to individuals leads back to the idea of a &quot;one-step flow of communication&quot;. The idea is a kind of Hypodermic needle / magic bullet model, with the capacity of big data analytics informed mass customization. Empirical studies by other scholars, in contrast, have found that modern social media platforms, like Twitter, exhibit clear evidence of a two-step flow of communication. Many social media users obtain their news from celebrities or other amplifying opinion leaders, who again get informed by mass media or by individuals with specific insights. The fine-grained digital footprint of social media also suggests that there are more than simply the one-step and two-step modes of communication flow, leading the search for more complex Multistep Flow Models based on distinct network structures.

== Lazarsfeld and Katz ==

Paul Lazarsfeld and Elihu Katz are considered to be the founders of functional theory and their book &quot;Personal Influence&quot; (1955) is considered to be the handbook to the theory.

=== Paul Felix Lazarsfeld ===
One of the first to embark on Communications research was the first to introduce the difference between &#x27;administrative research&#x27; and &#x27;critical research&#x27; in regards to the media. Critical research he believed, criticizes the media institutions themselves for the perspective ways they serve dominant social groups. Critical research favors interperspective and inductive methods of inquiry.

Lazarsfeld&#x27;s study of the 1940 presidential election was published as &quot;The People&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1944). During the research revealed information about the psychological and social processes that influence voting decisions. The study also uncovered an influence process that Lazarsfeld called &quot;opinion leadership.&quot; He concluded that there is a multistep flow of information from the mass media to persons who serve as opinion leaders which then is passed on to the general public. He called this communication process the &quot;two-step flow of communication&quot;.

=== Elihu Katz ===
Elihu Katz was a psychologist in the School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania when he collaborated with Lazarsfeld in 1955. Their research aimed to observe the flow of influence at the intersections of mass and interpersonal communication which resulted in the book &quot;Personal Influence&quot;. Katz pursued Lazarfeld&#x27;s research in a study of the flow of information, which is the basis of &quot;Personal Influence&quot;. Katz and Lazarsfeld concluded that:
&quot;... the traditional image of the mass persuasion process must make room for &#x27;people&#x27; as intervening factors between the stimuli of the media and resultant opinions, decisions, and actions.&quot;

== Published works on the theory ==
=== &quot;The People&#x27;s Choice&quot; ===
The presidential election of 1940 saw President Franklin Roosevelt seek an unprecedented third term in office. Funded by grants from the Rockefeller Foundation, &quot;Life&quot; magazine, and the pollster Elmo Roper, Columbia&#x27;s Office of Radio Research conducted a study of voting. It was based on a panel study of 2,400 voters in Erie County, Ohio. Paul Lazarsfeld, Bernard Berelson, and Hazel Gaudet supervised 15 interviewers, who from May–October interviewed the strategically selected 2,400 members of the community several different times in order to document their decision making process during the campaign. They focused on what factors would influence their decisions as the campaign progressed. &quot;The People&#x27;s Choice&quot;, a book based on this study presented the theory of &quot;the two-step flow of communications&quot;, which later came to be associated with the so-called &quot;limited effects model&quot; of mass media: the idea that ideas often flow from radio and print to local &quot;opinion leaders&quot; who in turn pass them on to those with more limited political knowledge, or &quot;opinion followers.&quot; The results of the research led to the conclusion that sometimes person to person communication can be more effective than traditional media outlets such as newspapers, TV, radio etc. This idea developed further in the book &quot;Personal Influence&quot;.

=== &quot;Personal Influence&quot; ===
In 1944, Paul Lazarsfeld contacted McFadden Publications in regards to his first book, &quot;The People&#x27;s Choice&quot;. The two collaborated forming a mutually beneficial partnership in which Macfadden saw a way to financially profit from advertising to the female population and Lazarsfeld saw a way to gain more information on social influence. Out of this came the study conducted by the Bureau of Applied Social Research in which 800 female residents of Decatur, Illinois, where interviewed through panel interviews to discover what and who primarily influenced their decision making. Lazarsfeld worked with Robert Merton and thus hired C. Wright Mills to head the study. Another part of the research team, Thelma Ehrlich Anderson, trained local Decatur women to administer surveys to targeted women in town. By 1955. the Decatur study was published as part of Elihu Katz and Lazarsfeld&#x27;s book &quot;Personal Influence&quot;. The book concluded that ultimately, face to face interaction is more influential than traditional media influence and thus confirmed the two-step flow model of communication.

== Criticisms ==
The original two-step flow hypothesis—that ideas flow from the media to opinion leaders and then to less active sections of the population—has been criticised. In 1960, conclusions from Deutschmann and Danielson assert, &quot;we would urge that the Katz-Lazarsfeld two-stage flow hypothesis, as a description of the initial information process, be applied to mass communication with caution&quot;.

Everett Rogers&#x27; &quot;Diffusion of Innovations&quot; cites one study in which two-thirds of respondents accredited their awareness to the mass media rather than face-to-face communication. Similarly, critics argue that most of Lazarsfeld&#x27;s findings pertain to learning factors involved with general media habits rather than the learning of particular information.

However, Lazarsfeld&#x27;s two-step hypothesis is an adequate description to understand the media&#x27;s influence on belief and behavior. Troldahl finds that media exposure is a first step to introduce discussion, at which point opinion leaders initiate the second-step flow.

According to Hilbert today&#x27;s digital media landscape simultaneously facilitate one-step, two-step and more complex multi-step flow models of communication. For example, in Twitter networks it is no contradiction that average Twitter users mainly mention intermediating opinion leaders in their tweets (two-step flow), while at the same time traditional mass media outlets receive 80-90 % of their mentions directly through a direct one-step flow from the same users.

<doc id="300548" wikidata="Q173491" url="?curid=300548" title="Tamils">
<text>The Tamils ( ), also known as the Tamilar, are a Dravidian ethnolinguistic group who natively speak the Tamil language and trace their ancestry mainly to the southern part of the Indian subcontinent. The Tamil language is one of the longest-surviving classical languages, with over two thousand years of written history, dating back to the Sangam period (between 300 BCE and 300 CE). Tamils constitute about 5.7% of the Indian population and form the majority in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu and the union territory of Puducherry. They also form significant proportion of the population in Sri Lanka (15.3%), Malaysia (7%) and Singapore (5%). Tamils have migrated world-wide since the 19th century CE and a significant population exists in South Africa, Mauritius, Fiji, as well as other regions such as the Southeast Asia, Middle East, Caribbean and parts of the Western World.

Archaeological evidence from Tamil Nadu indicates a continuous history of human occupation for more than 3,800 years. In the Sangam period, Tamilakam was ruled by the Three Crowned Kings of the Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas. Smaller Velir kings and chieftains ruled certain territories and maintained relationship with the larger kingdoms. Urbanisation and mercantile activity developed along the coasts during the later Sangam period with the Tamils influencing the regional trade in the Indian Ocean region. Artifacts obtained from excavations indicate the presence of early trade relations with the Romans. The major kingdoms to rule the region later were the Pallavas (3rd–9th century CE), and the Vijayanagara Empire (14th–17th century CE).

The island of Sri Lanka often saw attacks from the Indian mainland with the Cholas establishing their influence across the island and across several areas in Southeast Asia in the 10th century CE. This led to the spread of Tamil influence and contributed to the cultural Indianisation of the region. Scripts brought by Tamil traders like the Grantha and Pallava scripts, induced the development of many Southeast Asian scripts. The Jaffna Kingdom later controlled the Tamil territory in the north of the Sri Lanka from 13th to 17th century CE. European colonization began in the 17th century CE, and continued for two centuries until the middle of the 20th century.

Due to its long history, the Tamil culture has seen multiple influences over the years and have developed diversely. The Tamil visual art consists of a distinct style of architecture, sculpture and other art forms. Tamil sculpture ranges from stone sculptures in temples, to detailed bronze icons. The ancient Tamil country had its own system of music called Tamil Pannisai. Tamil performing arts include the theatre form Koothu, puppetry Bommalattam, classical dance Bharatanatyam, and various other traditional dance forms. Hindusim is the major religion followed by the Tamils and the religious practices include the veneration of various village deities and ancient Tamil gods. A smaller number are also Christians and Muslims, and a small percentage follow Jainism and Buddhism. Tamil cuisine consist of various vegetarian and meat items, usually spiced with locally available spices. Historian Michael Wood called the Tamils the last surviving classical civilization on Earth, because the Tamils have preserved substantial elements of their past regarding belief, culture, music, and literature despite the influence of globalization.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Tamil&quot; is derived from the name of the language. The people are referred to as in Tamil language, which is etymologically linked to the name of the language. The origin and precise etymology of the word Tamil is unclear with multiple theories attested to it. Kamil Zvelebil suggests that the term &quot;tamiz&quot; might have been derived from &quot;tam&quot; meaning &quot;self&quot; and &quot;-iz&quot; having the connotation of &quot;unfolding sound&quot;. Alternatively, he suggests a derivation of &quot;tamiz&quot; &lt; &quot;tam-iz&quot; &lt; &quot;*tav-iz&quot; &lt; &quot;*tak-iz&quot;, meaning &quot;the proper process (of speaking)&quot;. Franklin Southworth suggests that the name comes from &quot;tam-miz&quot; &gt; &quot;tam-iz&quot; meaning &quot;self-speak&quot;, or &quot;our own speech&quot;.

It is unknown whether the term &quot;Tamila&quot; and its equivalents in Prakrit such as &quot;Damela&quot;, &quot;Damila&quot;, or &quot;Tamira&quot; was first used as a self designation or a by outsiders. The Hathigumpha inscription from Udayagiri in Eastern India dated to the second century BCE, describes a &quot;T[r]amira samghata&quot; (Confederacy of Tamil rulers), which was in existence for the previous 113 years. Epigraphical evidence from the second century BCE mentioning &quot;Damela&quot; or &quot;Dameda&quot; from ancient Sri Lanka have been found. In the Buddhist Jataka texts, there is a mention of a &quot;Damila-rattha&quot; (Tamil dynasty). Greek historian Strabo (first century BCE) mentions that the Roman Emperor Augustus received an ambassador from &quot;Pandyan of Dramira&quot;. An inscription from Amaravati dated to third century CE refers to a &quot;Dhamila-vaniya&quot; (Tamil trader).

== History ==
=== In India ===
==== Pre-historic period (before 4th century BCE) ====
Archaeological evidence points to the region being first inhabited by hominids more than 400 millennia ago. Artifacts recovered in Adichanallur by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) indicate megalithic urn burials, dating from back to 1500 BCE., which are also described in early Tamil literature. Neolithic celts with the Indus script dated between 15th and 20th century BCE indicate the use of early Harappan language. Excavations at Keezhadi have revealed a large urban settlement, with the earliest artefact dated to 580 BCE, during the time of urbanization in the Indo-Gangetic plain. Further epigraphical inscriptions found at Adichanallur use Tamil Brahmi, a rudimentary script dated to 5th century BCE. Potsherds uncovered from Keeladi indicate a script which might be a transition between the Indus Valley script and Tamil Brahmi script used later.

==== Sangam period (3rd century BCE–3rd century CE) ====


The Sangam period lasted from 3rd century BCE to 3rd century CE with the main source of history during the period coming from the various Sangam literature. Ancient Tamilakam was ruled by a triumvirate of monarchical states, Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas. These kings are referred to as &quot;Vāṉpukaḻ Mūvar&quot; (Three glorified by heaven) in the Sangam literature. The Cheras controlled the western part of Tamilkam, the Pandyas controlled the south, and the Cholas had their base in the Kaveri delta. They are mentioned in the inscriptions from the Mauryan Empire dated to third century BCE. Kalinga inscriptions from the second century BCE refers to a confederacy of the Tamil kingdoms. The three kings called &quot;Vendhar&quot; ruled over several hill tribes headed by the &quot;Velir&quot; chiefs and settlements headed by clan chiefs called &quot;Kizhar&quot;. The rulers of smaller territories were referred to as &quot;Kurunilamannar&quot;, with &quot;Purananuru&quot; mentioning the names of many such chieftains.

The Sangam period rulers patronized multiple religions including vedic religion, Buddhism and Jainism and sponsored some of the earliest Tamil literature with the oldest surviving work being Tolkāppiyam, a book of Tamil grammar. &quot;Purananuru&quot; describes the public life and various unique cultural practices that existed during the period. The text talks about the Vedic Sacrifices performed by the kings as described in the Vedas and the rituals performed for the dead.

Agriculture was an important occupation during the period, and there is evidence that networks of irrigation channels were built as early as the 3rd century BCE. The Sangam literature describe fertile lands and people organised into various occupational groups. The governance of the land was through hereditary monarchies, although the sphere of the state&#x27;s activities and the extent of the ruler&#x27;s powers were limited through the adherence to an established order.

The kingdoms had significant diplomatic and trade contacts with other kingdoms to the north and with the Romans. Roman coins and other epigraphical evidence from South India and potsherds with Tamil writing found in excavations along the Red Sea indicate the presence of Roman commerce with the ancient Tamilakam. Much of the commerce from the Romans and Han China were facilitated via seaports including Muziris and Korkai with spices being the most prized goods along with pearls and silk. There is evidence of emissaries sent to the Roman Emperor Augustus by the Pandya kings. An anonymous Greek traveler&#x27;s account from first century CE, &quot;Periplus Maris Erytraei&quot;, describes the ports of the Pandya and Chera kingdoms in &quot;Damirica&quot; and their commercial activity in detail. It also describes that the chief exports of the ancient Tamils were pepper, malabathrum, pearls, ivory, silk, spikenard, diamonds, sapphires, and tortoiseshell.

==== Medieval era (4th–13th century CE) ====
From the fourth century CE, the region was ruled by the Kalabhras, warriors belonging to the Vellalar community, who were once feudatories of the three ancient Tamil kingdoms. The Kalabhra era is referred to as the &quot;dark period&quot; of Tamil history, and information about it is generally inferred from any mentions in the literature and inscriptions that are dated many centuries after their era ended. Around the seventh century CE, the Kalabhras were overthrown by the Pandyas and Cholas. Though they existed previously, the period saw the rise of the Pallavas in the sixth century CE under Mahendravarman I, who ruled parts of South India with Kanchipuram as their capital. The Pallavas were noted for their patronage of architecture. Throughout their reign, the Pallavas remained in constant conflict with the Cholas, the Pandyas and other kingdoms of Chalukyas of Badami and the Rashtrakutas. The Pandyas were revived by Kadungon towards the end of the sixth century CE and with the Cholas in obscurity in Uraiyur, the Tamil country was divided between the Pallavas and the Pandyas. The area west of the Western Ghats became increasingly distinct from the eastern parts. A new language Malayalam evolved from Tamil in the region and the socio-cultural transformation was altered further by the migration of Sanskrit-speaking Indo-Aryans from Northern India in the eighth century CE.

The Cholas were revived in the ninth century CE by Vijayalaya Chola and the last Pallavas ruler Aparajitavarman was defeated by the Chola prince Aditya I. After the defeat of the Pallavas, the Cholas became the dominant kingdom with the capital at Thanjavur. The Chola influence expanded subsequently with Rajaraja I conquering the entire Southern India and parts of present-day Sri Lanka and Maldives, and increased Chola influence across the Indian Ocean in the eleventh century CE. Rajaraja brought in administrative reforms including the reorganisation of Tamil country into individual administrative units. Under his son Rajendra Chola I, the Chola empire reached its zenith and stretched as far as Bengal in the north and across the Indian Ocean. He defeated the Eastern Chalukyas and the Chola navy invaded the Srivijaya Empire in South East Asia. The Cholas had trade links with the Chinese Song Dynasty and across Southeast Asia. The Cholas built many temples with the most notable being the Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur. The latter half of the eleventh century saw the union of Chola and Vengi kingdoms under Kulottunga I. The Cholas repulsed attacks from the Western Chalukyas and maintained its influence over the various kingdoms of Southeast Asia. According to historian Nilakanta Sastri, Kulottunga avoided unnecessary wars and had a long and prosperous reign characterized by unparalleled success that laid the foundations of the empire for the next 150 years.

The eventual decline of Chola power began towards the end of Kulottunga III&#x27;s reign in the thirteenth century CE. The Pandyas again reigned supreme under Maravarman Sundara I and defeated the Cholas under Rajaraja III. Though the Cholas were revived briefly with the aid of Hoysalas, civil war between Rajaraja and Rajendra III weakened them further. With the Hoysalas later siding with the Pandyas, the Pandyas consolidated control over the region. The Pandya empire reached its zenith in the thirteenth century CE under Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan I after he defeated the Hoysalas, the Kakatiyas and captured parts of Sri Lanka. The Pandyas ruled from their capital of Madurai and expanded trade links with other maritime empires. Venetian explorer Marco Polo mentioned the Pandyas as the richest empire in existence. The Pandyas also built a number of temples including the Meenakshi Amman Temple at Madurai. In the fourteenth century CE, the Pandyan empire was engulfed in a civil war and also faced repeated invasions by the Delhi Sultanate. In 1335, the Pandyan capital was conquered by Jalaluddin Ahsan Khan and the short-lived Madurai Sultanate was established.

==== Vijayanagar and Nayak period (14th–17th century CE) ====
The Vijayanagara kingdom was founded in . The Vijayanagara empire eventually conquered the entire Tamil country by and ruled for almost two centuries. In the sixteenth century, Vijaynagara king Krishnadeva Raya was forced to intervene in the conflict between their vassals, the Cholas and the Pandyas. The Nayak governor under Raya briefly took control of Madurai before it was restored to the empire. The Vijayanagara empire was defeated in the Battle of Talikota in 1565 by a confederacy of Deccan sultanates. The Nayaks, who were the military governors in the Vijaynagara empire, took control of the region amongst whom the Nayaks of Madurai and Nayaks of Thanjavur were the most prominent. They introduced the palayakkararar system and re-constructed some of the temples in Tamil Nadu including the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai.

==== Later conflicts and European colonization (17th to 20th century CE) ====
In the 18th century, the Mughal empire administered the region through the Nawab of the Carnatic with his seat at Arcot, who defeated the Madurai Nayaks. The Marathas attacked several times and defeated the Nawab after the Siege of Trichinopoly (1751-1752). This led to a short-lived Thanjavur Maratha kingdom. Europeans started to establish trade centres from the 16th century along the eastern coast. The Portuguese arrived in 1522 followed by the Dutch and the Danes. In 1639, the British East India Company obtained a grant for land from the Vijayanager emperor and the French established trading posts at Pondichéry in 1693. After several conflicts between the British and the French, the British established themselves as the major power in the eighteenth century CE. The British regained control of Madras in 1749 through the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle and resisted a French siege attempt in 1759.

The British East India Company demanded tax collection rights, which led to constant conflicts with the local Palaiyakkarars and resulted in the Polygar Wars. Puli Thevar was one of the earliest opponents, joined later by Rani Velu Nachiyar and Kattabomman in the first series of Polygar wars. The Maruthu brothers along with Oomaithurai, formed a coalition with Dheeran Chinnamalai and Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja, which fought the British in the Second Polygar War. In the later 18th century, the Mysore kingdom captured parts of the region and engaged in constant fighting with the British which culminated in the four Anglo-Mysore Wars. By the late eighteenth century CE, the British had conquered most of the region and established the Madras Presidency with Madras as the capital. On 10 July 1806, the Vellore mutiny, which was the first instance of a large-scale mutiny by Indian sepoys against the British East India Company, took place in Vellore Fort. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British Parliament passed the Government of India Act 1858, which transferred the governance of India from the East India Company to the British crown, forming the British Raj.

Failure of the summer monsoons and administrative shortcomings of the Ryotwari system resulted in two severe famines in the Madras Presidency, the Great Famine of 1876–78 and the Indian famine of 1896–97 which killed millions and the migration of many Tamils as bonded laborers to other British countries eventually forming the present Tamil diaspora. The Indian Independence movement gathered momentum in the early 20th century with the formation of the Indian National Congress, which was based on an idea propagated by the members of the Theosophical Society movement after a Theosophical convention held in Madras in December 1884. Various Tamils were contributors to the Independence movement including V. O. Chidambaram Pillai, Subramaniya Siva and Bharatiyar. The Tamils formed a significant percentage of the members of the Indian National Army (INA), founded by Subhas Chandra Bose.

==== Post Indian Independence (1947–present) ====
After the Independence of India in 1947, the Madras Presidency became Madras state, comprising present-day Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. The state was further re-organised as a state for Tamils when the boundaries were redrawn linguistically in 1956 into the current shape. On 14 January 1969, Madras state was renamed Tamil Nadu, meaning &quot;Tamil country&quot;. In 1965, Tamils agitated against the imposition of Hindi and in support of continuing English as a medium of communication which eventually led to English being retained as an official language of India alongside Hindi. After experiencing fluctuations in the decades immediately after Indian independence, the Human Development Index of the Tamils have consistently improved due to reform-oriented economic policies and in the 2000s, the region has become one of the most urbanized states in the country.

===In Sri Lanka===
====Pre-Anuradhapura period (before fifth century CE)====
There are various theories from scholars over the presence of Tamil people in Sri Lanka. Historian K. Indrapala states that Tamil replaced a previous language of an indigenous mesolithic population, who later became the Eelam Tamils and the cultural diffusion happened well before the arrival of Sinhalese people in Sri Lanka. Eelam Tamils consider themselves lineal descendants of the aboriginal Naga and Yaksha people of Sri Lanka. A cobra totem known as &quot;Nakam&quot; in the Tamil language is still part of the Tamil tradition in Sri Lanka. Remains of settlements and megalithic burial sites of people culturally similar to those of present-day Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu in modern India have been excavated at Pomparippu on the west coast and in Kathiraveli on the east coast of the island. These epigraphical evidence have been dated to a period between fifth century BCE and second century CE. Cultural similarities in burial practices in South India and Sri Lanka were dated by archeologists to the beginning of the Iron Age in the region around twelfth century BCE. There were specific migration routes that extended from South India to the island. These people moved further to the South of the island, and intermingled with the existent people.

====Anuradhapura period (4th century BCE to 10th century CE)====
Black and red ware potsherds found in Sri Lanka from the early reign of Anuradhapura kingdom, indicate a similar cultural connection with the people of South India. The Tamil Brahmi inscriptions on them indicate Tamil clan names such as &quot;Parumakal&quot;, &quot;Ay&quot;, &quot;Vel&quot;, &quot;Utiyan&quot;, &quot;Ticaiyan&quot;, &quot;Cuda&quot; and &quot;Naka&quot;, which points to the presence of Tamils in the region. Excavations in Poonakari in the north of the island have yielded several inscriptions including the mention of &quot;vela&quot;, a name related to &quot;velirs&quot; of the ancient Tamil country. Epigraphical evidence of people identified as Damelas (the Prakrit word for Tamil people) from the second century CE have been found in Anuradhapura, the capital city of the northern Rajarata region.

Historical records mention that the three Tamil kingdoms were involved in the island&#x27;s affairs from second century BCE. Chola king Ellalan captured the Anuradhapura Kingdom from 205 BCE to 161 BCE. Tamil soldiers from Tamilakam came to Anuradhapura in large numbers in the seventh century CE with the local chiefs and kings relying on them. In the eighth century CE, various Tamil villages collectively known as &quot;Demel-kaballa&quot; (Tamil allotment), &quot;Demelat-valademin&quot; (Tamil villages), and &quot;Demel-gam-bim&quot; (Tamil villages and lands) were established. In the ninth and tenth centuries CE, Pandya and Chola incursions started in the island which culminated with the Chola annexation of the island.

====Polonnaruwa and Jaffna kingdom (11th–15th century CE)====
The Chola influence lasted until the latter half of the eleventh century CE and the Chola decline was followed by the restoration of the Polonnaruwa monarchy. In 1215, following Pandya invasions, the Tamil-dominant Aryacakravarti dynasty established the Jaffna Kingdom on the Jaffna peninsula and in parts of northern Sri Lanka. In the fourteenth century CE, the Aryacakaravarthi expansion into the south of the island was halted by Alagakkonara, who belonged to a feudal family from Kanchipuram that migrated to Sri Lanka in the previous century and converted to Buddhism. He served as the chief minister of the Sinhalese king Parakramabahu V (1344–59 CE) and his descendant Vira Alakeshwara briefly became the king later before the Ming admiral Zheng He overthrew him in 1409 CE after which the influence of his family declined. The caste structure of the Sinhalese also accommodated Hindu immigrants from South India, which led to the emergence of new Sinhalese caste groups such as the &quot;Radala&quot;, the &quot;Salagama&quot;, the &quot;Durava&quot; and the &quot;Karava&quot;.

====Later conflicts and European colonization (16th–20th century CE)====
The Aryachakaravarthi dynasty continued to rule over large parts of northeast Sri Lanka until arrival of the Europeans on the island in the sixteenth century CE. Portuguese traders reached Sri Lanka by 1505 CE and the Jaffna kingdom came to the attention of Portuguese due to its presence as a logistical and strategic base for accessing the interior ruled by the Kandyan kingdom. King Cankili I resisted contacts with the Portuguese and repelled Parava Catholics who were brought from India to the Mannar Island to take over the lucrative pearl fisheries from the Jaffna kings. The wrested Mannar during the first invasion in 1560 and killed king Puvirasa Pandaram during the second expedition in 1591. After the conflicts, the Portuguese secured the kingdom in 1619 from the unpopular Cankili II, who was helped by the Thanjavur Nayaks. English sailor Robert Knox arrived in the island in 1669 and described the Tamil settlements in the &quot;An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon&quot; published in 1681.

The Dutch captured the island later and ruled for more than a century. Following the 1795 invasion of the British and the Kandyan Wars, the island came to the control of the British in the early nineteenth century CE. Upon arrival in June 1799, Hugh Cleghorn, the island&#x27;s first British colonial secretary, wrote to the British government: &quot;Two different nations from a very ancient period have divided between them the possession of the island. First the Sinhalese, inhabiting the interior in its Southern and Western parts, and secondly the Tamils who possess the Northern and Eastern districts. These two nations differ entirely in their religion, language, and manners.&quot; Irrespective of the ethnic differences, the British imposed a unitary state structure in British Ceylon for better administration. During the British colonial rule, Tamils held higher positions in the government and were favoured by the British for their qualification in English education. In the northern highlands, the lands of the Sinhalese were seized by the British and Indian Tamils were settled there as plantation workers. Tamils who migrated in the nineteenth century CE to work on tea plantations were later termed as the Indian Tamils.

====Post Sri Lankan independence (1948–present)====
Sri Lanka gained independence in 1948 and after the colonial rule ended, ethnic tension rose between the Sinhalese, who constituted a majority, and the Tamils. In 1956, the Sinhala Only Act designated Sinhala as the only official language of Sri Lanka, which forced many Tamils to resign as civil servants because they were not fluent in the language. The Tamils saw the act as linguistic, cultural and economic discrimination against them. Anti-Tamil pogroms in 1956 and 1958 resulted in deaths of many Tamils and further escalated the conflict. More than a million Indian Tamil plantation workers were made stateless after Sri Lanka refused citizenship to them. In 1964, the Sri Lankan and Indian governments entered into an agreement, based on which, about 300,000 would be granted Sri Lankan citizenship and about 975,000 Tamils would be repatriated to India over a period of fifteen years.

A new Constitution enacted in the 1970s further discriminated against the Tamils and various state-sponsored schemes led Sinhalese settlers into Tamil populated areas. The 1977 anti-Tamil pogrom was followed by a crackdown against the Tamils, which curtailed their rights. Following the declaration of state of emergency in 1981, state-backed Sinhalese mobs turned on Tamils, which led many Tamils to leave the country as refugees resulting in an exodus more than half a million to India and other countries. By the 1970s, initial non-violent political struggle for an independent Tamil state in the north and east of Sri Lanka, developed into a violent secessionist insurgency. This led to the bloody Sri Lankan Civil War for more than three decades. The conflict resulted in the deaths of at least 100,000 Tamils in the island and led to the flight of over 800,000 refugees. The war ended after the Sri Lankan military offensive in 2009. Since the end of the civil war, the Sri Lankan state has been subject to much global criticism for violating human rights as a result of committing war crimes through bombing civilian targets, usage of heavy weaponry, the abduction and massacres of Sri Lankan Tamils and sexual violence.

== Geographic distribution ==

=== India ===
As per the 2011 Census, there were 69 million Tamil speakers, constituting about 5.7% of the Indian population. Tamils formed the majority in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu (63.8 million) and the union territory of Puducherry (1.1 million). There were also significant Tamil population in other states of India such as Karnataka (2.1 million), Andhra Pradesh and Telangana (0.7 million), Maharashtra (0.5 million), and Kerala (0.5 million).

=== Sri Lanka ===
Sri Lankan Tamils, also known as Eelam Tamils, are classified into two ethnicities by the Sri Lankan government, namely Sri Lankan Tamils, and Indian Origin Tamils who accounted for 11.2%, and 4.1% respectively of the country&#x27;s population in 2011. The Sri Lankan Tamils (or Ceylon Tamils) are the descendants of the Tamils of the old Jaffna Kingdom and east coast chieftainships called Vannimais. The Indian Tamils (or Hill Country Tamils) are descendants of laborers who migrated from Tamil Nadu to Sri Lanka in the 19th century to work on tea plantations. Most Sri Lankan Tamils live in the Northern and Eastern provinces and around Colombo, whereas most Indian Tamils live in the central highlands. Historically, both the Tamil ethnic groups have identified themselves as separate communities, although there has been a greater sense of unity since the 1980s.

There also exists a significant Tamil Muslim population in Sri Lanka. However, they are listed as a separate entity under the Moors by the government. However, genealogical evidence suggests that most of the Sri Lankan Moor community are of Tamil ethnicity, and that the majority of their ancestors were also Tamils who had lived in the country for generations, and had converted to Islam from other faiths.

===Tamil diaspora===

Significant emigration from Indian subcontinent began in the late 18th century, when the Tamils went as indentured labourers and established businesses in other territories under the control of the British empire such as Malaya, Burma, South Africa, Fiji, Mauritius, and the Caribbean. The descendants of these Tamils continued to live in these countries, and practice their original culture, tradition and language. They form significant proportion of the population in Malaysia (7%) and Singapore (5%). A significant population also exists in South Africa, Mauritius, Fiji, as well as other regions such as the Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. However, subsequent generations might not speak the language as a mother tongue, but instead as a second or third language.

There is a small Tamil community in Pakistan, notably settled since the partition in 1947. Since the 20th century, Tamils have migrated to other regions such as Middle East and the Western World for employment. A large emigration of Sri Lankan Tamils began in the 1980s, as they sought to escape the ethnic conflict there. The largest concentration of Eelam Tamils outside Sri Lanka is found in Canada.

== Culture ==
=== Language ===

Tamil people speak Tamil, which belongs to the Dravidian languages and is one of the oldest classical languages. According to epigraphist Iravatham Mahadevan, the rudimentary Tamil Brahmi script originated in South India in the 3rd century BCE. Though the old Tamil preserved features of Proto-Dravidian language, modern-day spoken Tamil uses loanwords from other languages such as English. The existent Tamil grammar is largely based on the grammar book &quot;Naṉṉūl&quot; which incorporates facets from the old Tamil literary work &quot;Tolkāppiyam&quot;. Since the later part of the 19th century, Tamils made the language as a key part of the Tamil identity and the language is personified in the form of &quot;Tamil̲taay&quot; (&quot;Tamil mother&quot;). Various varieties of Tamil is spoken by the Tamils across regions such as Madras Bashai, Kongu Tamil, Madurai Tamil, Nellai Tamil, Kumari Tamil and various Sri Lankan Tamil dialects such as Batticaloa Tamil, Jaffna Tamil and Negombo Tamil in Sri Lanka.

=== Literature ===

Tamil literature is of considerable antiquity compared to the contemporary literature from other Indian languages and represents one of the oldest bodies of literature in South Asia. The earliest epigraphic records have been dated to around the 3rd century BCE. Early Tamil literature was composed in three successive poetic assemblies known as Tamil Sangams, the earliest of which destroyed by floods. The Sangam literature was broadly classified into three divisions: &quot;iyal&quot; (poetry), &quot;isai&quot; (music) and &quot;nadagam&quot; (drama). The early Tamil literature was compiled and classified into two categories: &quot;Patinenmelkanakku&quot; (&quot;Eighteen Greater Texts&quot;) consisting of the &quot;Ettuttokai&quot; (&quot;Eight Anthologies&quot;) and the &quot;Pattuppattu&quot; (&quot;Ten Idylls&quot;), and the &quot;Patinenkilkanakku&quot; (&quot;Eighteen Lesser Texts&quot;).

The Tamil literature that followed in the next 300 years after the Sangam period is generally called the &quot;post-Sangam&quot; literature which included the Five Great Epics. Another book of the post Sangam era is the &quot;Tirukkural&quot;, a book on ethics, by Thiruvalluvar. In the beginning of the middle age, Vaishnava and Saiva literature became prominent following the Bhakti movement in 7th century CE with hymns composed by Alwars and Nayanmars. Notable work from the post-Bhakti period included &quot;Ramavataram&quot; by Kambar in 12th century CE and &quot;Tiruppugal&quot; by Arunagirinathar in 15th century CE. In 1578, the Portuguese published a Tamil book in old Tamil script named &quot;Thambiraan Vanakkam&quot;, thus making Tamil the first Indian language to be printed and published. &quot;Tamil Lexicon&quot;, published by the University of Madras between 1924 and 1939, was amongst the first comprehensive dictionaries published in the language. The 19th century gave rise to Tamil Renaissance and writings and poems by authors such as Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai, U.V.Swaminatha Iyer, Damodaram Pillai, V. Kanakasabhai and others. During the Indian Independence Movement, many Tamil poets and writers sought to provoke national spirit, notably Bharathiar and Bharathidasan.

=== Art and architecture ===
According to Tamil literature, there are 64 art forms called &quot;aayakalaigal&quot;. The art is classified into two broad categories: &quot;kavin kalaigal&quot; (beautiful art forms) which include architecture, sculpture, painting and poetry and &quot;nun kalaigal&quot; (fine art forms) which include dance, music and drama.

==== Architecture ====
Dravidian architecture is the distinct style of architecture of the Tamils. The large &quot;gopurams&quot;, which are monumental ornate towers at the entrance of the temples form a prominent feature of Hindu temples of the Dravidian style. They are topped by &quot;kalasams&quot; (finials) and function as gateways through the walls that surround the temple complex. There are a number of early rock-cut cave-temples established by the various Tamil kingdoms. The Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram, built by the Pallavas in the 7th and 8th centuries has more than forty rock-cut temples, monoliths and rock reliefs. The Pallavas, who built the group of monuments in Mahabalipuram and Kanchipuram, were one of the earliest patronisers of the Dravidian architectural style. These gateways became regular features in the Cholas and the Pandya architecture, was later expanded by the Vijayanagara and the Nayaks and spread to other parts such as Sri Lanka. There are more than 34,000 temples in Tamil Nadu built across various periods some of which are several centuries old. The influence of Tamil culture had led to the construction of various temples outside India by the Tamil dispora. The Mugal influence in medieval times and the British influence later gave rise to a blend of Hindu, Islamic and Gothic revival styles, resulting in the distinct Indo-Saracenic architecture with several institutions during the British era following the style. By the early 20th century, the art deco made its entry upon in the urban landscape. In the later part of the century, the architecture witnessed a rise in the modern concrete buildings.

==== Sculpture and paintings ====
Tamil sculpture ranges from stone sculptures in temples, to detailed bronze icons. The bronze statues of the Cholas are considered to be one of the greatest contributions of Tamil art. Models made of a special mixture of beeswax and sal tree resin were encased in clay and fired to melt the wax leaving a hollow mould, which would then be filled with molten metal and cooled to produce bronze statues. Tamil paintings are usually centered around natural, religious or aesthetic themes. Sittanavasal is a rock-cut monastery and temple attributed to Pandyas and Pallavas which consist of frescoes and murals from the 7th century CE, painted with vegetable and mineral dyes in over a thin wet surface of lime plaster. Similar murals are found in temple walls, the most notable examples are the murals on the Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangam and the Brihadeeswarar temple at Thanjavur. One of the major forms of Tamil painting is Thanjavur painting, which originated in the 16th century CE where a base made of cloth and coated with zinc oxide is painted using dyes and then decorated with semi-precious stones, as well as silver or gold threads.

==== Music ====

The ancient Tamil country had its own system of music called &quot;Tamil Pannisai&quot;. Sangam literature such as the &quot;Silappatikaram&quot; from 2nd century CE describes music notes and instruments. A Pallava inscription dated to the 7th century CE has one of the earliest surviving examples of Indian music in notation. The Pallava inscriptions from the period describe the playing of string instrument veena as a form of exercise for the fingers and the practice of singing musical hymns (&quot;Thirupadigam&quot;) in temples. From the 9th century CE, Shaivite hymns &quot;Thevaram&quot; and Vaishnavite hymns (&quot;Tiruvaymoli&quot;) were sung along with playing of musical instruments. Carnatic music originated later which included rhythmic and structured music by composers such Thyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar, and Shyama Shastri. Villu Paatu is an ancient form of musical story-telling method where narration is interspersed with music played from a string bow and accompanying instruments. Gaana, a combination of various folk musics is sung mainly in Chennai.

There are many traditional instruments from the region dating back to the Sangam period such as parai, tharai, yazh, and murasu. Nadaswaram, a reed instrument that is often accompanied by the thavil, a type of drum instrument are the major musical instruments used in temples and weddings. Melam is from a group of percussion instruments from the ancient Tamilakam which are played during events and functions.

Silambattam is a martial dance using a &quot;silambam&quot;, a long staff of about in length, often made of wood such as bamboo. It was used for self-defense and to ward off animals and later evolved into a martial art and dance form. Adimurai (or Kuttu varisai) is a martial art specializing in empty-hand techniques and application on vital points of the body. Varma kalai is a Tamil traditional art of vital points which combines alternative medicine and martial arts, attributed to sage Agastiyar and might form part of the training of other martial arts such as silambattam, adimurai or kalari. Malyutham is the traditional form of combat-wrestling.

Wootz steel used to make weapons, originated in the mid-1st millennium BCE in South India. Locals in Sri Lanka adopted the production methods of creating wootz steel from the Cheras and the later trade introduced it to other parts of the world. Since the early Sangam age, war was regarded as an honourable sacrifice and fallen heroes and kings were worshipped with hero stones and heroic martyrdom was glorified in ancient Tamil literature. Defeated kings committed &quot;Vatakkiruttal&quot;, a form of ritual suicide.

==== Modern arts ====
The Tamil film industry nicknamed as Kollywood and is one of the largest industries of film production in India. Independent Tamil film production have also originated outside India in Sri Lanka, Singapore, Canada, and western Europe. The concept of &quot;Tent Cinema&quot; was introduced in the early 1900s, in which a tent was erected on a stretch of open land close to a town or village to screen the films. The first silent film in South India was produced in Tamil in 1916 and the first Tamil talkie film was &quot;Kalidas&quot;, which released on 31 October 1931, barely seven months after the release of India&#x27;s first talking picture &quot;Alam Ara&quot;.

=== Clothing ===
Ancient literature and epigraphical records describe the various types of dresses worn by Tamil people. Tamil women traditionally wear a &quot;sari&quot;, a garment that consists of a drape varying from to in length and to in breadth that is typically wrapped around the waist, with one end draped over the shoulder, baring the midriff. Women wear colourful silk sarees on traditional occasions. Young girls wear a long skirt called &quot;pavaadai&quot; along with a shorter length sari called &quot;dhavani&quot;. The men wear a &quot;dhoti&quot;, a long, white rectangular piece of non-stitched cloth often bordered in brightly coloured stripes which is usually wrapped around the waist and the legs and knotted at the waist. A colourful &quot;lungi&quot; with typical batik patterns is the most common form of male attire in the countryside. People in urban areas generally wear tailored clothing, and western dress is popular. Western-style school uniforms are worn by both boys and girls in schools, even in rural areas.

=== Calendar ===
The Tamil calendar is a sidereal solar calendar. The &quot;Tamil Panchangam&quot; is based on the same and is generally used in contemporary times to check auspicious times for cultural and religious events. The calendar follows a 60-year cycle. There are 12 months in a year starting with &quot;Chithirai&quot; when the Sun enters the first &quot;Rāśi&quot; and the number of days in a month varies between 29 and 32. The new year starts following the March equinox in the middle of April. The days of week (&quot;kiḻamai&quot;) in the Tamil calendar relate to the celestial bodies in the solar system: Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn, in that order.

=== Food and hospitality ===

Hospitality is a major feature of Tamil culture. It was considered as a social obligation and offering food to guests was regarded as one of the highest virtues. Rice is the diet staple and is served with sambar, rasam, and poriyal as a part of a Tamil meal. Bananas find mention in the Sangam literature and the traditional way of eating a meal involves having the food served on a banana leaf, which is discarded after the meal. Eating on banana leaves imparts a unique flavor to the food, and is considered healthy. Food is usually eaten seated on the floor and the finger tips of the right hand is used to take the food to the mouth.

There are regional sub-varieties namely Chettinadu, Kongunadu, Nanjilnadu, Pandiyanadu and Sri Lankan Tamil cuisines. There are both vegetarian and meat dishes with fish traditionally consumed across the coast and other meat preferred in the interiors. The Chettinadu cuisine is popular for its meat based dishes and generous usage of spices. The Kongunadu cuisine uses less spices and are generally cooked fresh. It uses coconut, sesame seeds, groundnut, and turmeric to go with various cereals and pulses grown in the region. Nanjilnadu cuisine is milder and is usually based on fish and vegetables. Sri Lankan Tamil cuisine uses gingelly oil and jaggery along with coconut and spices, which differentiates it from the other culinary traditions in the island. Biryani is a popular dish with several different versions prepared across various regions. Idli, and dosa are popular breakfast dishes and other dishes cooked by to the Tamil people include upma, idiappam, pongal, paniyaram, and parotta.

=== Medicine ===
Siddha medicine is a form of traditional medicine originating from the Tamils and is one of the oldest systems of medicine in India. The word literally means perfection in Tamil and the system focuses on wholesome treatment based on various factors. As per Tamil tradition, the knowledge of Siddha medicine came from Shiva, which was passed on to 18 holy men known as &quot;Siddhar&quot; led by Agastya. The knowledge was then passed on orally and through palm leaf manuscripts to the later generations. Siddha practitioners believe that all objects including the human body is composed of five basic elements – earth, water, fire, air, sky which are present in food and other compounds, which is used as the basis for the drugs and other therapies.

=== Festivals ===
Pongal is a major and multi-day harvest festival celebrated by Tamils in the month of Thai according to the Tamil solar calendar (usually falls on 14 or 15 January). Puthandu is known as Tamil New Year which marks the first day of year on the Tamil calendar and falls on in April every year on the Gregorian calendar. Other major festivals include Karthikai Deepam, Thaipusam, Panguni Uthiram, and Vaikasi Visakam. Aadi Perukku is a Tamil cultural festival celebrated in the Tamil month of Adi and the worship of Amman and Ayyanar deities are organized during the month in temples across Tamil Nadu with much fanfare. Other festivals celebrated include Ganesh Chaturthi, Navarathri, Deepavali, Eid al-Fitr and Christmas.

=== Sports ===


Jallikattu is a traditional event held during the period attracting huge crowds in which a bull is released into a crowd of people, and multiple human participants attempt to grab the large hump on the bull&#x27;s back with both arms and hang on to it while the bull attempts to escape. It has been practised since Sangam period with the aim of keeping people fit. Proficiency in the sport was considered a virtue while untamable bulls were held as a pride of the owner. Kabaddi is a traditional conatct sport that originated from the Tamils. Chess is a popular board game which originated as Sathurangam in the 7th century CE. Traditional games like Pallanguzhi, Uriyadi, Gillidanda, Dhaayam are played across the region. In modern times, Cricket is the most popular sport.

== Religion ==

As per the Sangam literature, the Sangam landscape was classified into five categories known as &quot;thinais&quot;, which were associated with a Hindu deity: Murugan in &quot;kurinji&quot; (hills), Thirumal in &quot;mullai&quot; (forests), Indiran in &quot;marutham&quot; (plains), Varunan in the &quot;neithal&quot; (coasts) and Kotravai in &quot;palai&quot; (desert). Thirumal is indicated as a deity during the Sangam era, who was regarded as &quot;Paramporul&quot; (&quot;the suprement one&quot;) and is also known as Māyavan, Māmiyon, Netiyōn, and Māl in various Sangam literature. While Shiva worship existed in the Shaivite culture as a part of the Tamil pantheon, Murugan became regarded as the &quot;Tamil kadavul&quot; (&quot;God of the Tamils&quot;). In Tamil tradition, Murugan is the youngest son of Shiva and Parvati and Pillayar is regarded as the eldest son, who is venerated as the &quot;Mudanmudar kadavul&quot; (&quot;foremost god&quot;).

The cult of the mother goddess is treated as an indication of a society which venerated femininity. The worship of Amman, also called Mariamman, is thought to have been derived from an ancient mother goddess, and is also very common. Kannagi, the heroine of the &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot; is worshipped as a goddess by many Tamils, particularly in Sri Lanka. In the Sangam literature, there is a description of the rites performed by the priestesses in temples. Among the ancient Tamils, the practice of erecting memorial stones (&quot;natukal&quot;) was prevalent and it continued till the Middle ages. It was customary for people who sought victory in war to worship these hero stones to bless them with victory. In rural areas, local deities called Aiyyan̲ār (also known as Karuppan, Karrupasami, Muniandi), are worshipped who are thought to protect the villages from harm. Their worship probably emanated from the hero stone worship and appears to be the surviving remnants of an ancient Tamil tradition. Idol worship forms a part of the Tamil Hindu culture similar to the Hindu traditions.


During the Sangam period, Ashivakam, Jainism and Buddhism also had a significant following. Jainism existed from the Sangam period with inscriptions and drip-ledges from 1st century BCE to 6th century CE describing the same. The Kalabhra dynasty, who were patrons of Jainism, ruled over the ancient Tamil country in the 3rd–7th century CE. Buddhism had an influence in Tamil Nadu before the later Middle Ages with ancient texts referring to a Vihāra in Nākappaṭṭinam from the time of Ashoka in 3rd century BCE and Buddhist relics from 4th century CE found in Kaveripattinam. Around the 7th century CE, the Pandyas and Pallavas, who patronized Buddhism and Jainism, became patrons of Hinduism following the revival of Saivism and Vaishnavism during the Bhakti movement led by Alwars and Nayanmars.

The Christian apostle, St. Thomas, is believed to have preached Christianity to the Tamils between 52 and 70 CE. Rowthers were Tamils who were converted to Islam by the Turkish preacher Nathar Shah in the tenth century CE and follow the Hanafi school. Other Muslim clans such as Marakkayar, Labbai, and Kayalar originated as a result of the trade with the Arab world. Majority of the Tamil Muslims speak Tamil rather than Urdu, which is spoken by Muslims in other parts of the Indian subcontinent. Mercantile groups introduced &quot;Cholapauttam&quot;, a syncretic form of Buddhism and Shaivism in northern Sri Lanka and Southern India. The religion lost its importance in the 14th century when conditions changed for the benefit of Sinhala and Pali traditions.

As of the 21st century, majority of the Tamils are adherents of Hinduism. The migration of Tamils to other countries resulted in new Hindu temples being constructed in places with significant population of Tamil people and people of Tamil origin, and countries with significant Tamil migrants. Sri Lankan Tamils predominantly worship Murugan with numerous temples existing throughout the island. There are also followers of Ayyavazhi in Tamil Nadu, mainly in the southern districts. Atheist, rationalist, and humanist philosophies are also adhered by sizeable minorities, as a result of Tamil cultural revivalism in the 20th century, and its antipathy to what it saw as Brahminical Hinduism.

<text>The soft palate (also known as the velum, palatal velum, or muscular palate) is, in mammals, the soft tissue constituting the back of the roof of the mouth. The soft palate is part of the palate of the mouth; the other part is the hard palate. The soft palate is distinguished from the hard palate at the front of the mouth in that it does not contain bone.

==Structure==

===Muscles===
The five muscles of the soft palate play important roles in swallowing and breathing. The muscles are: 
# Tensor veli palatini, which is involved in swallowing
# Palatoglossus, involved in swallowing
# Palatopharyngeus, involved in breathing
# Levator veli palatini, involved in swallowing
# Musculus uvulae, which moves the uvula

These muscles are innervated by the pharyngeal plexus via the vagus nerve, with the exception of the tensor veli palatini. The tensor veli palatini is innervated by the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (V3).

==Function==
The soft palate is moveable, consisting of muscle fibers sheathed in mucous membrane. It is responsible for closing off the nasal passages during the act of swallowing, and also for closing off the airway. During sneezing, it protects the nasal passage by diverting a portion of the excreted substance to the mouth.

In humans, the uvula hangs from the end of the soft palate. Touching the uvula or the end of the soft palate evokes a strong gag reflex in most people.

===Speech===
A speech sound made with the middle part of the tongue (dorsum) touching the soft palate is known as a velar consonant.

It is possible for the soft palate to retract and elevate during speech to separate the oral cavity (mouth) from the nasal cavity in order to produce the oral speech sounds. If this separation is incomplete, air escapes through the nose, causing speech to be perceived as nasal.

===Modelling===

Within the microstructure of the soft palate lie a variety of variably-oriented fibers that create a nonuniform surface with a nonuniform density distribution. The tissue has been characterized as viscoelastic, nonlinear, and anisotropic in the direction of the fibers. Young modulus values range from 585 Pa at the posterior free edge of the soft palate to 1409 Pa where the soft palate attaches to the maxilla. These properties are useful when quantifying the effects of corrective orthopedic devices such as the Hotz Plate on cleft lip.

Quantitative analyses have been done on bilateral and unilateral cleft palate to better understand geometric differences in cleft palate throughout the course of its development and correction. Despite the difficulty in finding common, comparable landmarks between normal soft palates and cleft palates, analytical methods have been devised to assess differences in degree of curvature of the alveolar crest, two-dimensional and three-dimensional surface area, and slope of the alveolar crest.

Finite element analysis has demonstrated effective modeling of soft-palate extension and movement. It has also been an effective tool for evaluating the craniofacial effects of corrective orthopedic devices and cleft lip.

==Clinical significance==

===Disease===

Pathology of the soft palate includes mucosal lesions such as pemphigus vulgaris dsg - 3, herpangina and migratory stomatitis, and muscular conditions such as the congenital cleft palate and cleft uvula.
Petechiae on the soft palate are mainly associated with streptococcal pharyngitis, and as such it is an uncommon but highly specific finding. 10 to 30 percent of palatal petechiae cases are estimated to be caused by suction, which can be habitual or secondary to fellatio.

<text>Muurame is a municipality of Finland, located south-west of Jyväskylä, the regional capital of Central Finland. Muurame itself is located between two lakes, Lake Päijänne and Lake Muuratjärvi. These two lakes are connected to each other via River Muurame. Altogether there are 37 lakes in Muurame. The biggest lakes beside Päijänne are Muuratjärvi and Lake Kuusjärvi. River Muurame streams through the population center of Muurame, which was founded in 1921.

The Muurame church is of Alvar Aalto&#x27;s design, being his first church design to be completed in 1929. It was comprehensively restored in 2016 to its original design.

== Name ==
&quot;Muurame&quot; is a dialectal word referring to the cloudberry, which also can be seen in the municipal coat of arms. Similar toponyms nearby include Muuratsalo, Muuratjärvi, Muuramenlampi and Muuratharju.

== History ==
Muurame was originally a part of the Jämsä. There were also external hunting grounds of Pälkäne in the area. 
In 1539, there were four farms in Muurame: two of the estates paid taxes to Jämsä, while the other two were taxed from Pälkäne.

Korpilahti, including Muurame, was separated from Jämsä in 1861. Muurame was in turn separated from Korpilahti in 1921. Säynätsalo was separated from Muurame ecclesiastically in 1922 and administratively in 1924.

<doc id="300561" wikidata="Q298930" url="?curid=300561" title="Phil Lynott">
<text>Philip Parris Lynott (, ; 20 August 1949 – 4 January 1986) was an Irish musician, songwriter, and poet. He was the co-founder, lead vocalist, bassist, and primary songwriter for the hard rock band Thin Lizzy. He was known for his distinctive pick-based style on the bass and for his imaginative lyrical contributions, including working-class tales and numerous characters drawn from personal influences and Celtic culture.

Lynott was born in the West Midlands of England and grew up in Dublin with his grandparents. He remained close to his mother, Philomena, throughout his life. He fronted several bands as a lead vocalist, including Skid Row alongside Gary Moore, before learning the bass guitar and forming Thin Lizzy in 1969. After initial success with &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot;, the band had several hits in the mid-1970s, such as &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot;, &quot;Jailbreak&quot; and &quot;Waiting for an Alibi&quot;, and became a popular live attraction combining Lynott&#x27;s vocal and songwriting skills with dual lead guitars. Towards the end of the 1970s, Lynott embarked upon a solo career and published two books of poetry. After Thin Lizzy disbanded, he assembled and fronted the band Grand Slam.

In the 1980s, Lynott increasingly suffered drug-related problems, particularly an addiction to heroin. In 1985, he had a final chart success with Moore, &quot;Out in the Fields&quot;, before his death in 1986. He remains a popular figure in the rock world, and in 2005, a statue in his memory was erected in Dublin.

==Early life==

Phil Lynott was born in Hallam Hospital in West Bromwich. His mother, Philomena Lynott, was born in Dublin and his father, Cecil Parris, was from Georgetown, British Guiana. Philomena met Parris, who had moved to the United Kingdom to seek work, in Birmingham in 1948 and they were in a relationship for a few months, until Parris was transferred to London. Shortly afterwards, Philomena found she was pregnant and, after Lynott was born, she moved with her baby to a home for unmarried mothers in Selly Park, where he was baptised on 4 September. Philomena subsequently moved to Manchester but stayed in touch with Parris who helped pay towards his son&#x27;s support. She subsequently had two more children who were placed for adoption. Lynott believed he was different from his peers at school, but did not suffer any major racist attacks.

Lynott first attended school in Moss Side, Manchester. In 1957, due to accounts of racism and Lynott being mixed race, his mother sent him to live with his grandparents, Frank and Sarah Lynott, in Crumlin, Dublin. The presence of Frank gave him a father figure for the first time in his life. His mother stayed in Manchester and remained close to her son. She later took over the management of the Clifton Grange Hotel in Whalley Range with her partner, Dennis Keeley. The hotel, nicknamed &quot;The Biz&quot;, became popular with showbusiness entertainers, and was later referred to in a song on Thin Lizzy&#x27;s debut album. Lynott had a happy childhood growing up in Dublin and was a popular character at school.

==Career==

===Early years===
Lynott was introduced to music through his uncle Timothy&#x27;s record collection, and became influenced by Motown and The Mamas &amp; the Papas. He joined his first band, the Black Eagles, in 1965 as a lead singer, playing popular covers in local clubs around Dublin. He attended the Christian Brothers School in Cavan, where he became friends with Brian Downey, who was later persuaded to join the band from the Liffey Beats. The group fell apart due to the lack of interest of manager Joe Smith, particularly after the departure of his two sons, guitarists Danny and Frankie.

Lynott then left the family home and moved into a flat in Clontarf, where he briefly joined the group Kama Sutra. It was in this band that he learned his frontman skills, and worked out how to interact with an audience. In early 1968, he teamed up with bassist Brendan &#x27;Brush&#x27; Shiels to form Skid Row. Downey was not interested in Shiels&#x27; request to be the drummer, so the job went to Noel Bridgeman. The band signed a deal with Ted Carroll, who would later go on to manage Thin Lizzy, and played a variety of covers including &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and several numbers by Jimi Hendrix. Because Lynott did not play an instrument at this point in his career, he instead manipulated his voice through an echo box during instrumental sections. He took to smearing boot polish under his eyes on stage to draw attention to himself, which he would continue to do throughout Lizzy&#x27;s career later on, and regularly performed a mock fight with Shiels onstage to attract the crowd. In mid-1968, guitarist Bernard Cheevers quit to work full-time at the Guinness brewery in Dublin and was replaced by Belfast-born guitarist Gary Moore.

Despite increased success, and the release of a single, &quot;New Faces, Old Places&quot;, Shiels became concerned about Lynott&#x27;s tendency to sing off-key. He then discovered that the problem was with Lynott&#x27;s tonsils; he subsequently took a leave of absence from the band. By the time he had recovered, Shiels had decided to take over singing lead and reduce the band to a three-piece. Feeling guilty of having effectively sacked one of his best friends, he taught Lynott how to play bass, figuring it would be easier to learn than a six-string guitar, and sold him a Fender Jazz Bass he had bought from Robert Ballagh for £36, and started giving him lessons.

Lynott and Downey quickly put together a new band called Orphanage, with guitarist Joe Staunton and bassist Pat Quigley, playing a mixture of original material alongside covers of Bob Dylan, Free and Jeff Beck. Still learning the bass, Lynott restricted himself to occasional rhythm guitar alongside singing lead.

At the end of 2006, a number of Skid Row and Orphanage demo tapes featuring Lynott were discovered. These were his earliest recordings and had been presumed lost for decades.

===Thin Lizzy===
Towards the end of 1969, Lynott and Downey were introduced to guitarist Eric Bell via a founding member of Them, keyboardist Eric Wrixon (Bell had played in a later line-up of Them). Deciding that Bell was a better guitarist, and with Lynott now confident enough to play bass himself, the four formed Thin Lizzy. The name came from the character &quot;Tin Lizzie&quot; in the comic &quot;The Dandy&quot;, which in turn came from the nickname for the Ford Model T car. The H was deliberately added to mimic the way the word &quot;thin&quot; is pronounced in a Dublin accent. Lynott later discovered the saying attributed to Henry Ford, &quot;Any colour you like as long as it&#x27;s black,&quot; which he felt was appropriate for him. Wrixon was felt by the others to be surplus to requirements and left after the release of the band&#x27;s first single, &quot;The Farmer&quot;, in July 1970.

During the band&#x27;s early years – and despite being the singer, bassist and chief songwriter – Lynott was still fairly reserved and introverted on stage, and would stand to one side while the spotlight concentrated on Bell, who was initially regarded as the group&#x27;s leader. During the recording of the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Shades of a Blue Orphanage&quot; (1972), Lynott very nearly left Thin Lizzy to form a new band with Deep Purple&#x27;s Ritchie Blackmore and Ian Paice, called Baby Face. &quot;Ritchie turned up in the studio one day to jam,&quot; recalled Downey. &quot;I was asked to play drums to Phil and Ritchie jamming… Me and Eric looked at each other like, &#x27;Well, that&#x27;s the end of the band then.&#x27; It lasted a week, then Phil came back as if nothing had happened. He wanted to be the leader of his own band, not the singer in someone else&#x27;s.&quot; Due to being in dire financial straits Lizzy did, however, soon record an album of Deep Purple covers under the name Funky Junction. Lynott did not sing on the album as he felt his voice was not in the same style as Ian Gillan.

Towards the end of 1972, Thin Lizzy got their first major break in the UK by supporting Slade, then nearing the height of their commercial success. Inspired by Noddy Holder&#x27;s top hat with mirrors, Lynott decided to attach a mirror to his bass, which he carried over to subsequent tours. On the opening night of the tour, an altercation broke out between Lynott and Slade&#x27;s manager Chas Chandler, who chastised Lynott&#x27;s lack of stage presence and interaction with the audience and threatened to throw Lizzy off the tour unless things improved immediately. Lynott subsequently developed the onstage rapport and stage presence that would become familiar over the remainder of the decade.
Thin Lizzy&#x27;s first top-ten hit was in 1973, with a rock version of the traditional Irish song &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot;, featuring a cover by Irish artist and friend Jim Fitzpatrick. However, follow-up singles failed to chart and, after the departure of Bell, quickly followed by Moore replacing him and, briefly, Downey, Thin Lizzy were near collapse by mid-1974. It was not until the recruitment of guitarists Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson and the release of &quot;Jailbreak&quot; in 1976 that Thin Lizzy became international superstars on the strength of the album&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot;. The song reached the top 10 in the UK, was No. 1 in Ireland and a hit in the US and Canada. However, while touring with Rainbow, Lynott contracted hepatitis and the band had to cancel touring.

Lynott befriended Huey Lewis while Lewis&#x27;s band, Clover, was supporting them on tour. Lewis was impressed with Lynott&#x27;s frontman abilities and was inspired to perform better, eventually achieving commercial success in the 1980s. Lynott&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Cowboy Song&quot; and &quot;Massacre&quot;, were particularly influenced by the band&#x27;s US touring. He had a particular affinity for Los Angeles.

Having finally achieved mainstream success, Thin Lizzy embarked on several consecutive world tours. The band built on &quot;Jailbreak&quot;″s success with the release of a string of hit albums, including &quot;Johnny the Fox&quot; (1976), &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; (1977), &quot;Black Rose: A Rock Legend&quot; (1979), and the live album &quot;Live and Dangerous&quot; (1978), which features Lynott in the foreground on the cover. However, the band was suffering from personnel changes, with Robertson being replaced temporarily by Moore in 1976, and then permanently the following year, partly due to a personal clash with Lynott.
By the early 1980s, Thin Lizzy were starting to struggle commercially, and Lynott started showing symptoms of drug abuse, including regular asthma attacks. After the resignation of longtime manager Chris O&#x27;Donnell, and with Gorham wanting to quit, Lynott decided to disband Thin Lizzy in 1983. He had started to use heroin by this stage in his career, and it affected the band&#x27;s shows in Japan when he was unable to obtain any. He managed to pick himself up for the band&#x27;s show at the Reading Festival and their last gig (with Lynott as frontman) in Nuremberg on 4 September.

===Later years===
In 1978 Lynott began to work on projects outside Thin Lizzy. He was featured in &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s Musical Version of The War of the Worlds&quot;, singing and speaking the role of Parson Nathaniel on &quot;The Spirit of Man&quot;. He performed sessions for a number of artists, including singing backing vocals with Bob Geldof on Blast Furnace and the Heatwaves&#x27; &quot;Blue Wave&quot; EP.

Lynott took a keen interest in the emergence of punk rock in the late 1970s, and subsequently became friends with various members of the Sex Pistols, The Damned and Geldof&#x27;s band The Boomtown Rats. This led to him forming an &quot;ad-hoc&quot; band known as &quot;The Greedies&quot; (originally &quot;The Greedy Bastards&quot;, but edited for public politeness). The band started playing shows in London during Lizzy&#x27;s downtime in 1978, playing a mixture of popular Lizzy tracks and Pistols songs recorded after John Lydon&#x27;s departure. In 1979, The Greedies recorded a Christmas single, &quot;A Merry Jingle&quot;, featuring other members of Thin Lizzy as well as the Pistols&#x27; Steve Jones and Paul Cook. The previous year, he had performed alongside Jones and Cook on Johnny Thunders&#x27; debut solo album &quot;So Alone&quot;. Lynott became friends with Midge Ure of the Rich Kids, who deputised for Thin Lizzy during 1979 shortly after joining Ultravox. Lynott persuaded Thin Lizzy&#x27;s management to sign Ultravox.
In 1980, though Thin Lizzy were still enjoying considerable success, Lynott launched a solo career with the album, &quot;Solo in Soho&quot;: this was a Top 30 UK album and yielded two hit singles that year, &quot;Dear Miss Lonelyhearts&quot; and &quot;King&#x27;s Call&quot;. The latter was a tribute to Elvis Presley, and featured Mark Knopfler on guitar. His second solo venture, &quot;The Philip Lynott Album&quot; (1982) was a chart flop, despite the presence of the single &quot;Old Town&quot;. The song &quot;Yellow Pearl&quot; (1982), was a No. 14 hit in the UK and became the theme tune to &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

In 1983, following the disbanding of Thin Lizzy, Lynott recorded a rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll medley single, &quot;We Are the Boys (Who Make All the Noise)&quot; with Roy Wood, Chas Hodges and John Coghlan. Lynott regularly collaborated with former bandmate Moore on tracks including the singles &quot;Parisienne Walkways&quot; (a No. 8 UK hit in 1979) and &quot;Out in the Fields&quot; (a No. 5 UK hit in 1985, his highest-charting single). In 1984, he formed a new band, Grand Slam, with Doish Nagle, Laurence Archer, Robbie Brennan and Mark Stanway. The band toured The Marquee and other clubs, but suffered from being labelled a poor version of Thin Lizzy owing to the inclusion of two lead guitar players, and split up at the end of the year due to a lack of money and Lynott&#x27;s increasing addiction to heroin.

During 1983–1985 Lynott co-wrote songs with British R&amp;B artist Junior Giscombe, although nothing was officially released and most remain as demos. However, one song, &quot;The Lady Loves to Dance&quot;, was mastered with producer Tony Visconti and nearly released before being pulled by the record company, Phonogram. Lynott was particularly upset about not being asked to participate in Live Aid, which had been organised by his two friends, Geldof and Ure, the latter of whom had briefly stood in as a guitarist for Thin Lizzy. Geldof later said this was because the Band Aid Trust could only accommodate commercially successful artists selling millions of albums, which neither Lynott nor Thin Lizzy had done. In 1984, Lynott appeared as team captain (against Alvin Stardust) on the 1980s BBC quiz show &quot;Pop Quiz&quot;, hosted by Mike Read.

His last single &quot;Nineteen&quot;, co-written by Laurence Archer and Mark Stanway and produced by Paul Hardcastle, was released a few weeks before his death. It bore no relation to the producer&#x27;s chart-topping single of the same title some months earlier. &quot;This was a guy whose records I used to play when I was at school,&quot; said Hardcastle. &quot;He was a hero of mine – I couldn&#x27;t work out why he wanted to work with &quot;me&quot;. He said to me, &#x27;You&#x27;re at the top of your game technically right now, so can you help me?&#x27;&quot; The producer played the bassline on Lynott&#x27;s Fender. &quot;He walked in on me playing it and I thought, &#x27;Shit!&#x27; said Hardcastle. &quot;But he said, &#x27;That&#x27;s fokken great – we&#x27;re keeping that on there.&quot;

Throughout December 1985 Lynott promoted &quot;Nineteen&quot;, performing live on various television shows. The same month, he gave his final interviews in which he promulgated his possible plans for the near future; these included more work with Moore and even the possibility of reforming Thin Lizzy, something which he had privately discussed with Gorham previously. He recorded some material with Archer, Lewis, and members of the News in 1985, which was not released.

===Poetry===
Lynott&#x27;s first book of poetry, &quot;Songs for While I&#x27;m Away&quot;, was published in 1974. It contained 21 poems that were all lyrics from Thin Lizzy songs, except one titled &quot;A Holy Encounter&quot;. Only 1,000 copies of the book were printed. In 1977, a second volume was released, titled &quot;Philip&quot;. In 1997, both books were brought together in a single volume, again titled &quot;Songs for While I&#x27;m Away&quot;. This compendium edition featured illustrations by Tim Booth and Jim Fitzpatrick, and the original introductions by Peter Fallon and John Peel.

==Personal life==
Born in England and raised in Ireland, Lynott always considered himself to be Irish. His friend and Thin Lizzy bandmate Scott Gorham said in 2013, &quot;Phil was so proud of being Irish. No matter where he went in the world if we were talking to a journalist and they got something wrong about Ireland, he&#x27;d give the guy a history lesson. It meant a lot to him.&quot; In the early 1980s, he purchased properties on the Howth peninsula north of Dublin, one of which, White Horses in Sutton, was a 50th birthday present for his mother; the house was later the site of a memorial room for the artist.

On 14 February 1980 Lynott married Caroline Crowther, a daughter of British comedian Leslie Crowther. He met her when she was working for Tony Brainsby in the late 1970s. They had two children: Sarah (born 19 December 1978), for whom the eponymous 1979 song was written, and Cathleen (born 30 July 1980), for whom the eponymous 1982 Lynott solo song was written. The marriage fell apart in 1984 after Lynott&#x27;s drug use escalated. Lynott also had a son, born in Dublin in 1968, who had been placed for adoption; in 2003 Macdaragh Lambe learned that Lynott was his biological father, and this was confirmed by Philomena Lynott in a newspaper interview in July 2010.

Lynott was a football fan and supported Manchester United. He was good friends with United and Northern Ireland footballer George Best, and the pair regularly socialised at the Clifton Grange Hotel. Lynott later became a shareholder of the club.

==Illness and death==

Lynott&#x27;s last years were heavily affected by drug and alcohol dependency, leading to his collapse on 25 December 1985 at his home in Kew. He was discovered by his mother, who was not aware of his heroin addiction. She contacted his wife, Caroline, who knew about it and immediately identified the problem as serious. After Caroline drove him to a drug clinic at Clouds House in East Knoyle, near Shaftesbury, he was taken to Salisbury Infirmary where he was diagnosed as suffering from septicaemia. Although he regained consciousness enough to speak to his mother, his condition worsened by the start of the new year and he was put on a ventilator. He died of pneumonia and heart failure due to septicaemia on 4 January 1986 at the age of 36.

Lynott&#x27;s funeral was held at St Elizabeth&#x27;s Church, Richmond, on 9 January, with most of Thin Lizzy&#x27;s ex-members in attendance, followed by a second service at Howth Parish Church near Dublin on 11 January. He was buried in St Fintan&#x27;s Cemetery in Sutton, County Dublin.

==Legacy==
===Thin Lizzy revivals and Vibe for Philo===
Thin Lizzy regrouped for a one-off performance in 1986, with Bob Geldof taking lead vocals, and reformed as a touring act in 1996. In 2012 the members of Thin Lizzy decided to record new material but chose to do so under the name of Black Star Riders as they and Lynott&#x27;s widow felt uncomfortable about new Thin Lizzy recordings without Lynott.

Every January from 1987 to 2019, with a final event in 2023, Lynott&#x27;s friend Smiley Bolger hosted a festival for him on the anniversary of his death, called the Vibe for Philo. A number of musicians performed at the festival, including Thin Lizzy tribute bands and, occasionally, former Thin Lizzy members.

===Releases===
Both Lynott&#x27;s and Thin Lizzy&#x27;s back catalogues have been re-released in expanded editions. In April 2007, the 1996 film &quot;The Rocker: A Portrait of Phil Lynott&quot;, which consisted mainly of archive footage, was released on DVD in the UK. In August 2010, &quot;Yellow Pearl&quot; was released. This is a collection of songs from Lynott&#x27;s solo albums, B-sides and album tracks.

===Family and trust===
On 4 January 1994 a trust in Lynott&#x27;s name was formed by his family and friends to provide scholarships for new musicians, and to make donations to charities and organisations in his memory.

Lynott&#x27;s mother struggled to come to terms with her son&#x27;s death and visited his grave on a regular basis. In September 2012, she, Scott Gorham and Lynott&#x27;s widow objected to Mitt Romney&#x27;s use of &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot; during his election campaign. In an interview with Irish rock magazine &quot;Hot Press&quot;, Philomena said, &quot;As far as I am concerned, Mitt Romney&#x27;s opposition to gay marriage and to civil unions for gays makes him anti-gay – which is not something that Philip would have supported.&quot;

===Memorials, stamps and coins===
In 2005 a life-size bronze statue of Lynott by Dublin sculptor Paul Daly was unveiled on Harry Street, off Grafton Street in central Dublin. The ceremony was attended by Lynott&#x27;s mother Philomena, who had worked with the Roisin Dubh Trust on the campaign for the status, and by former band members Moore, Bell, Robertson, Downey, Gorham and Darren Wharton, who performed live.

On 3 October 2019 An Post released two commemorative stamps, with artwork by Jim Fitzpatrick, one of the Black Rose album cover, and one a portrait of Lynott. They were launched in the UK by Lynott&#x27;s children and ex-wife. On 27 November 2019, the Central Bank of Ireland issued 3,000 €15 silver commemorative coins as part of the &#x27;Modern Irish Musicians&#x27; series, commemorating the 70th anniversary of Lynott&#x27;s birth in 1949. On 17 December 2020 a plaque was unveiled at his childhood home on Leighlin Road, Crumlin.

In 2019 a plaque was put up at Sandwell Hospital where Lynott was born. A bronze portrait bust of Lynott was installed in his birth town of West Bromwich and unveiled on what would have been his 72nd birthday on 20 August 2021. It was designed by local artist Luke Perry and crowdfunded by Thin Lizzy fans. However, it has been criticised for its lacking a likeness to Lynott.

===Biographies and documentary===
A biography by Niall Stokes was released in 2015, entitled &quot;Philip Lynott: Still In Love With You&quot;; a further biography, authorized by the Lynott family, &quot;Cowboy Song&quot;, was released in 2016. Other biographical accounts include &quot;Phil Lynott: The Rocker&quot; by Mark Putterford, &quot;Philip Lynott: Renegade of Thin Lizzy&quot; by Alan Byrne, and &quot;Tha Ballad of the Thin Mark: The Authorised Biography of Philip Lynott and Thin Lizzy&quot; by Stuart Bailie. Lynott&#x27;s mother, Philomena, published &quot;My Boy: The Philip Lynott Story&quot;, an autobiographical volume with much content on Phil, in 1995.

A documentary taking its name from Lynott&#x27;s poetry collection, &quot;Phil Lynott: Songs for While I&#x27;m Away&quot;, featuring interviews with people who knew Lynott and worked with him, and some of his admirers such as U2&#x27;s Adam Clayton, was released in 2020.

==Musical style and equipment==

Lynott purchased a Fender Jazz Bass from Brush Shiels when starting Thin Lizzy. He used other basses early in the band&#x27;s career, including a bi-amped Rickenbacker and an Ampeg Dan Armstrong lucite (see-thru) bass. His signature instrument was a black Fender Precision Bass, furnished with a mirror pickguard used frequently on stage and in videos. In the later part of Thin Lizzy&#x27;s career onwards, he used an Ibanez Roadstar RS900.

When playing bass Lynott always used an attacking style with a pick, favoring eighth notes or triplets. His bass lines could be heard in the foreground and on top of the beat, signalling a &quot;pushed&quot; chord played slightly before the first beat of the next bar.

Lynott wrote the majority of Thin Lizzy&#x27;s lyrics, often refining the words up until the last minute when vocals were ready to be recorded. A variety of themes and characters were featured, drawing from the Celtic heritage of Irish history. Death was a common theme, such as &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot;, &quot;Massacre&quot;, &quot;Killer on the Loose&quot; and &quot;Angel of Death&quot;. Early material in particular drew on personal experiences and family around Dublin. He began to include American themes into his lyrics, such as &quot;Cowboy Song&quot; and &quot;Massacre&quot;, after Thin Lizzy began regularly touring the US. Several songs feature the character &quot;Johnny&quot;, which Lynott used as an alter ego for himself. &quot;The Boys are Back in Town&quot; was written from the point of view of the band and the audience being in a gang together, which contributed to its success.

Lynott&#x27;s singing style set him apart among hard rock musicians, with a seemingly casual sense of off-the-beat phrasing &quot;closer to folk or jazz.&quot;

<text>Grace Llewellyn (born March 18, 1964) is an American educator, author, and publisher. She is the founder of &quot;Lowry House Publishers&quot;, founder and director of &quot;Not Back To School Camp&quot; and &quot;The Hive: Self-Directed Learning for Teens&quot;.

==Biography==
Llewellyn was born on 18 March 1964 in Boise, Idaho, United States. Her parents were a nurse and a geologist writer and she had five siblings.

She completed her B.A. from Carleton College in 1986. After teaching for three years, she came across the work of John Holt, which led her to reconsider her approach to education.

In 1991 she wrote &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook: How to Quit School and Get a Real Life and Education&quot;. At that time, home-schooling was illegal in some US states.

Llewellyn published the &quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; through her publishing company, Lowry House Publishers.

In 1996 she started the Not Back to School camp for independent learners; the camp has been running for over 25 years.

<doc id="300566" wikidata="Q1488972" url="?curid=300566" title="UTA Flight 772">
<text>UTA Flight 772 was a scheduled international passenger flight of the French airline Union de Transports Aériens (UTA) operating from Brazzaville in the People&#x27;s Republic of the Congo, via N&#x27;Djamena in Chad, to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France on 19 September 1989, which crashed into the Ténéré desert near Bilma, Niger, killing all 170 people on board after an in-flight explosion caused by a suitcase bomb. It is the deadliest aviation incident to occur in Niger.

==Aircraft and crew==
The aircraft, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, with American registration serial number 46852, was manufactured in 1973 and first flew on 13 March. It was the 125th DC-10 produced, and had accumulated 14,777 flight cycles over 60,276 flight hours at the time of its hull loss. It was equipped with three General Electric CF6-50C2R engines.

The captain, 40-year-old Georges Raveneau, was an experienced pilot, with a total of 11,039 flight hours, 2,723 of which were on the DC-10. The left-seat pilot, 38-year-old Jean-Pierre Hennequin, had a total of 6,442 flight hours, 28 of which were on the DC-10. The first officer, 41-year-old Michel Crézé, had a total of 8,357 flight hours, 754 of which were on the DC-10. The flight engineer, 28-year-old Alain Bricout, had a total of 597 flight hours, 180 of which were on the DC-10.

==Incident==

On Tuesday, 19 September 1989 the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 aircraft took off from N&#x27;Djamena International Airport at 13:13. Forty-six minutes later, at its cruising altitude of , a suitcase bomb exploded in the cargo hold, causing UTA Flight 772 to break up over the Sahara east of Agadez in the southern Ténéré and to the north of the Termit Massif in the Zinder Region of Niger. The explosion scattered debris over hundreds of square miles of desert. All 170 occupants were killed.

==Victims==
The victims came from 18 different countries, the majority being French, Chadian, and Congolese nationals. After the plane was bombed, Leonardo Leonardi, a spokesperson for the Italian Embassy in Paris, said that the embassy believed that six Italians were on the flight. A spokesperson of the Friars Minor Capuchin religious order said that two members of the order were on board the aircraft. The bishop of Moundou, Chad, was also on the flight.

The other countries with victims were Algeria, Belgium, Bolivia, Cameroon, Canada, the Central African Republic, Greece, Mali, Morocco, Senegal, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo).
Eight of the fatalities were oil workers (from Esso, Parker, and Schlumberger) returning following the completion of drilling of the &quot;Kome-3&quot; borehole in southern Chad.

Among the victims was Bonnie Barnes Pugh (&quot;née&quot; Coverley), wife of Robert L. Pugh, American ambassador to Chad at the time.
==Investigation==
An investigation commission of the International Civil Aviation Organization determined that a bomb placed in a container in location 13-R in the forward cargo hold caused the destruction of the aircraft. The commission suggested that the most plausible hypothesis was for the bomb to have been inside the baggage loaded at Brazzaville airport. Initial speculation over which groups might have been responsible for destroying UTA Flight 772 centered upon Islamic Jihad, who were quick to claim responsibility for the attack, and the &quot;Secret Chadian Resistance&quot; rebel group, which opposed president Hissen Habré. Five years previously, on 10 March 1984, a bomb destroyed another UTA aircraft from Brazzaville shortly after the DC-8 had landed at N&#x27;Djamena airport. There were no fatalities on that occasion and those responsible were never identified.

==Trial &quot;in absentia&quot;==
The investigators obtained a confession from one of the alleged terrorists, a Congolese opposition figure, who had helped recruit a fellow dissident to smuggle the bomb onto the aircraft. This confession led to charges being brought against six Libyans. French judge Jean-Louis Bruguière identified them, as follows:

* Abdullah Senussi, brother-in-law of Muammar Gaddafi, and deputy head of Libyan intelligence;
* Abdullah Elazragh, Counsellor at the Libyan embassy in Brazzaville;
* Ibrahim Naeli and Arbas Musbah, explosives experts in the Libyan secret service;
* Issa Shibani, the secret agent who purchased the timer that allegedly triggered the bomb; and,
* Abdelsalam Hammouda, Senussi&#x27;s right-hand man, who was said to have coordinated the attack.

In 1999, the six Libyans were put on trial in the Paris Assize Court for the bombing of UTA Flight 772. Because Gaddafi would not allow their extradition to France, the six were tried &quot;in absentia&quot; and were convicted.

On 5 September 2012, the country of Mauritania extradited Abdullah Senussi to Libyan authorities. Senussi was to be tried in Libya for crimes he allegedly committed during the time he was the close assistant to Gaddafi. Senussi appeared in a Libyan court for a pre-trial hearing on 19 September 2013. On 11 October 2013, the International Criminal Court ruled that he can be tried in Libya and lifted their warrant.

===Alleged motive===
The motive usually attributed to Libya for the UTA Flight 772 bombing was retaliation against the French for supporting Chad against the expansionist projects of Libya toward Chad.

The Chadian–Libyan War (1978–1987) ended in disaster for Libya following the defeat at the Battle of Maaten al-Sarra in the 1987 Toyota War. Muammar Gaddafi was forced to accede to a ceasefire ending the Chadian–Libyan conflict and his dreams of African and Arab dominance. Gaddafi blamed the defeat on French and United States &quot;aggression against Libya&quot;. The result was Gaddafi&#x27;s lingering animosity against the two countries which led to Libyan support for the bombings of Pan Am Flight 103 and UTA Flight 772.

==Libyan compensation==
The Paris court awarded the families of the UTA victims sums ranging from €3 000 to €30 000 depending on their relationship to the dead. Not content with this award, the French relatives&#x27; group &quot;UTA DC10 Families&quot; ()&quot;&quot; signed an agreement on 9 January 2004 with the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations accepting a compensation payment of US$170 million, or $1 million for each of the 170 UTA victims. By May 2007, it was reported that 95% of this compensation money had been distributed. However, the families of the seven American victims refused to accept their US$1 million awards and began pursuing the Libyan government through a federal court in Washington. 

On 19 September 2006, the court was asked to rule that the Libyan government and six of its agents were guilty of the destruction of UTA Flight 772 on 19 September 1989. Damages of more than US$2 billion were claimed for the loss of life and the destruction of the DC-10 jet.

In April 2007, D.C. District Judge Henry H. Kennedy found Libya directly responsible for the bombing and presided over a three-day bench trial from 13 August 2007 to 15 August 2007. On 15 January 2008, Judge Kennedy issued an order awarding US$6 billion in damages to the families and owners of the airliner; Libya appealed this decision. 

In October 2008, Libya paid $1.5 billion into a fund to be used to compensate relatives of the:
#Lockerbie bombing victims;
#American victims of the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing;
#American victims of the 1989 UTA Flight 772 bombing; and,
#Libyan victims of the 1986 US bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi.

As a result, U.S. President George W. Bush signed an executive order dismissing all of the pending compensation cases in the U.S. and restoring the Libyan government&#x27;s immunity from terror-related lawsuits.

==Other statements==
In &quot;Manipulations Africaines&quot; (&quot;African Manipulations&quot;), published in February 2001, Pierre Péan investigated the sabotage of UTA Flight 772. He alleged that evidence pointed to Iran and Syria (acting through the Hezbollah movement), but that due to political context (notably the Gulf War), France and the United States tried to put the blame on Libya. He accuses judge Jean-Louis Bruguière of deliberately neglecting proof of Lebanon, Syria and Iran being involved to pursue only the Libyan trail. He also accused Thomas Thurman, a Federal Bureau of Investigation explosives expert, of fabricating false evidence against Libya in both the Pan Am Flight 103 and UTA Flight 772 sabotages.

On 18 July 2011, former Libyan foreign minister Abdel Rahman Shalgham, who had defected from the Libyan government in March at the beginning of what would become the 2011 Libyan civil war, told &quot;al-Hayat&quot; that the Libyan government was responsible for the bombing of UTA Flight 772. He stated &quot;The Libyan security services blew up the plane. They believed that opposition leader Mohammed al-Megrief was on board, but after the plane was blown up, it was found that he was not on the plane.&quot; He also claimed that &quot;The Lockerbie operation was more complex ... the role of states and organizations has been discussed, and while the Libyan services were implicated, I do not think it was a purely Libyan operation.&quot;

==Memorial==

In 2007 a memorial was created in the desert by Les Familles de l&#x27;Attentat du DC-10 d&#x27;UTA, an association of the victims&#x27; families. In order to retain the sanctity of the crash site, the memorial is about away from it, so that it can be seen from planes following the same air route as Flight 772. The memorial, at , is constructed of black rock in the shape and dimensions of the DC-10 airplane inside a compass, with the starboard half of the plane&#x27;s horizontal stabilizer used as a compass point, and 170 broken mirrors to reflect the victims of the crash. The stabilizer carries a plaque with the names of those on board. The memorial is visible in aerial imagery on Google Maps.

The organizer of the memorial was Frenchman Guillaume Denoix de Saint Marc, whose father, Jean-Henri, died on the flight.

As of 2020, the memorial has become buried under sand due to desertification and is no longer visible.

==In popular culture==
Rush drummer Neil Peart mentioned this incident at length in his travel memoir, &quot;The Masked Rider: Cycling in West Africa&quot;, as he had taken this flight less than a year prior to the incident from N&#x27;Djamena to Paris once he was finished with his Cameroon bicycling tour.

A book by Stu Newburger called &quot;The Forgotten Flight: Terrorism, Diplomacy and the Pursuit of Justice &quot;is about the crash.

<text>A hidden camera or spy camera is a camera used to photograph or record subjects, often people, without their knowledge. The camera may be considered &quot;hidden&quot; because it is not visible to the subject being filmed, or is disguised as another object. Hidden cameras are often considered a surveillance tool.

The term &quot;hidden camera&quot; is commonly used when subjects are unaware that they are being recorded, usually lacking their knowledge and consent; the term &quot;spy camera&quot; is generally used when the subject would object to being recorded if they were aware of the camera&#x27;s presence. In contrast, the phrase &quot;security camera&quot; refers to cameras that are visible and/or are accompanied by a warning notice of their presence, so the subject is aware of the camera&#x27;s presence and knows they are being filmed.

The use of hidden cameras raises personal privacy issues. There may be legal aspects to consider, depending on the jurisdiction in which they are used.

==Description==
A hidden camera can be wired or wireless. Hidden cameras are connected, by cable or wirelessly, to a viewing or recording device, such as a television, computer, videocassette recorder, network video recorder, digital video recorder, memory card, or another data storage medium. They may also store their images or recordings online, such as through a livestream. Hidden video cameras may or may not have audio recording capabilities. Hidden cameras may be activated manually, remotely, or through motion detection.

A hidden camera may not be visible to the subject, for example, because it is fitted with a long-focus lens and located beyond the view of the subject, or because it is obscured or hidden by an object, such as a one-way mirror. Hidden cameras can be built into a wide variety of items, ranging from electronics (television sets, smoke detectors, clocks, motion detectors, mobile phones, personal computers) to everyday objects where electronics are not expected to be found (stationery, plants, glasses, clothing, street lights).

== Use ==
Common applications for hidden cameras are property security, personal surveillance, photography, or entertainment purposes, though they may also be used for espionage or surveillance by law enforcement, intelligence agencies, investigative journalists, corporations, or other entities. They may also be used for illegal activity, such as criminal scope-outs, stalking, or voyeurism.

Hidden cameras may be installed within common household objects for parents to monitor and record the activities of nannies and sometimes the children themselves. These hidden cameras are commonly referred to as &quot;nanny cams&quot;. The use nanny cams can be a subject of controversy. For example, a 2003 criminal case in Florida, involving a nanny that was allegedly caught by a nanny cam violently shaking a baby, was thrown out in 2006 when the video was considered &quot;worthless evidence&quot;; however, this was due to issues regarding video quality, not legality, and several earlier cases used clearer nanny cam footage as evidence. Some hidden camera television shows have also led to lawsuits or the cancellation of episodes by the people who were trapped in set-ups that they found unpleasant. 

Hidden cameras are sometimes placed in holiday rental apartments such as those advertised on Airbnb. Questions have been raised about the safety and privacy of holidaymakers in these circumstances.

==In media==

Hidden cameras are sometimes used in reality television and social media, where they are used to catch participants in unusual or absurd situations. Participants will either know they will be filmed, but not always exactly when or where; or they will not know they have been filmed until later, at which point they may sign a release or give consent to the footage being produced for a show. This latter subgenre of unwitting participants began in the 1940s with Allen Funt&#x27;s &quot;Candid Microphone&quot; theatrical short films.

==Legal issues==

=== South Korea ===
In South Korea, hidden cameras (abbreviated to &quot;Molka&quot; in Korean) proliferated in the 2010s and enabled the spread of voyeuristic images and videos. The term &quot;Molka&quot; can refer to both the actual cameras as well as the footage posted online.

=== United Kingdom ===
The use of hidden cameras is generally permitted under UK law, if used in a legal manner and towards legitimate ends. Individuals may use covert surveillance in their own home, in the workplace for employee monitoring, outside of a domestic or commercial property for security purposes and in security situations where there may be a need to do so. There are a number of laws under the Data Protection Act and Human Rights Acts that may affect the use of hidden cameras.

In any type of covert surveillance, footage should only be used for the purpose for which it has been taken, which must be a legitimate security reason. The person in possession of the footage is responsible for its use, and must only retain footage for as long as it is reasonably needed. It is not permitted to release the footage to third parties except when there is a legal necessity.

It is illegal under UK law to deploy covert cameras in areas where individuals would have an expectation of privacy, such as bathrooms, changing rooms, and locker rooms. It is also illegal to place hidden cameras in someone else&#x27;s home or on someone else&#x27;s property.

=== United States ===
In the United States, the purchase, ownership, and use of hidden cameras and nanny cams is generally considered legal in all 50 states. However, U.S. Code Title 18, Chapter 119, Section 2512 prohibits the interception of oral communication by &quot;surreptitious manner&quot; such as a hidden recording device, and so most hidden video cameras are not available with audio recording. Additionally, it is illegal in 13 states to record audio without express or written consent of the nanny being recorded. Despite this, some hidden cameras are still sold in the United States with audio recording capabilities, though their use is illegal and their recordings cannot legally be used as evidence.

<doc id="300568" wikidata="Q957386" url="?curid=300568" title="Liskov substitution principle">
<text>The Liskov substitution principle (LSP) is a particular definition of a subtyping relation, called strong behavioral subtyping, that was initially introduced by Barbara Liskov in a 1987 conference keynote address titled &quot;Data abstraction and hierarchy&quot;. It is based on the concept of &quot;substitutability&quot; a principle in object-oriented programming stating that an object (such as a class) may be replaced by a sub-object (such as a class that extends the first class) without breaking the program. It is a semantic rather than merely syntactic relation, because it intends to guarantee semantic interoperability of types in a hierarchy, object types in particular. Barbara Liskov and Jeannette Wing described the principle succinctly in a 1994 paper as follows:
&quot;Subtype Requirement&quot;: Let be a property provable about objects of type . Then should be true for objects of type where is a subtype of . 
Symbolically:
:formula_1
That is, if S subtypes T, what holds for T-objects holds for S-objects.
In the same paper, Liskov and Wing detailed their notion of behavioral subtyping in an extension of Hoare logic, which bears a certain resemblance to Bertrand Meyer&#x27;s design by contract in that it considers the interaction of subtyping with preconditions, postconditions and invariants.

== Principle ==
Liskov&#x27;s notion of a behavioural subtype defines a notion of substitutability for objects; that is, if &quot;S&quot; is a subtype of &quot;T&quot;, then objects of type &quot;T&quot; in a program may be replaced with objects of type &quot;S&quot; without altering any of the desirable properties of that program (e.g. correctness).

Behavioural subtyping is a stronger notion than typical subtyping of functions defined in type theory, which relies only on the contravariance of parameter types and covariance of the return type. Behavioural subtyping is undecidable in general: if &quot;q&quot; is the property &quot;method for &quot;x&quot; always terminates&quot;, then it is impossible for a program (e.g. a compiler) to verify that it holds true for some subtype &quot;S&quot; of &quot;T&quot;, even if &quot;q&quot; does hold for &quot;T&quot;. Nonetheless, the principle is useful in reasoning about the design of class hierarchies.

Liskov substitution principle imposes some standard requirements on signatures that have been adopted in newer object-oriented programming languages (usually at the level of classes rather than types; see nominal vs. structural subtyping for the distinction):

* Contravariance of method parameter types in the subtype.
* Covariance of method return types in the subtype.
* New exceptions cannot be thrown by the methods in the subtype, except if they are subtypes of exceptions thrown by the methods of the supertype.

In addition to the signature requirements, the subtype must meet a number of behavioural conditions. These are detailed in a terminology resembling that of design by contract methodology, leading to some restrictions on how contracts can interact with inheritance:

* Preconditions cannot be strengthened in the subtype.
* Postconditions cannot be weakened in the subtype.
* Invariants cannot be weakened in the subtype.
* History constraint (the &quot;history rule&quot;). Objects are regarded as being modifiable only through their methods (encapsulation). Because subtypes may introduce methods that are not present in the supertype, the introduction of these methods may allow state changes in the subtype that are not permissible in the supertype. The history constraint prohibits this. It was the novel element introduced by Liskov and Wing. A violation of this constraint is, for example, defining a &quot;mutable point&quot; as a subtype of an &quot;immutable point&quot;. This is a violation of the history constraint, because in the history of the &quot;immutable point&quot;, the state is always the same after creation, so it cannot include the history of a &quot;mutable point&quot; in general. Fields added to the subtype may, however, be safely modified because they are not observable through the supertype methods. Thus, one can define a &quot;circle with immutable center and mutable radius&quot; as a subtype of an &quot;immutable point&quot; without violating the history constraint.

== Origins ==
The rules on pre- and postconditions are identical to those introduced by Bertrand Meyer in his 1988 book &quot;Object-Oriented Software Construction&quot;. Both Meyer, and later Pierre America, who was the first to use the term &quot;behavioral subtyping&quot;, gave proof-theoretic definitions of some behavioral subtyping notions, but their definitions did not take into account aliasing that may occur in programming languages that support references or pointers. Taking aliasing into account was the major improvement made by Liskov and Wing (1994), and a key ingredient is the history constraint. Under the definitions of Meyer and America, a mutable point would be a behavioral subtype of an immutable point, whereas Liskov substitution principle forbids this.

<text>The Ohrekreis was a district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) in the north-east of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Altmarkkreis Salzwedel, Stendal, Jerichower Land, the district-free city Magdeburg, Bördekreis, and the districts Helmstedt and Gifhorn in Lower Saxony. Its territory is now incorporated into Börde.

== History ==
In 1680 the area of the district became part of Brandenburg, and the &quot;Holzkreis&quot; roughly covering the area of the Ohrekreis was created.

In 1816 the districts were rearranged, thus the two new districts Neuhaldensleben (later renamed to Haldensleben) and Wolmirstedt were created. Except two changes in 1908 when the municipality Rothensee became part of Magdeburg, and in 1944 when Calvörde became part of Haldensleben the districts did not change until a bigger reform in 1952. The district Haldensleben lost its southern part and instead part of the district Gardelegen was added; and Wolmirstedt lost 21 municipalities to the districts Tangerhütte, Haldensleben, and Wanzleben. In 1994 the two district were merged to the new district Ohrekreis, including a few municipalities from the districts Stendal and Klötze. In 2007 the next reform starts in Saxony-Anhalt. The two districts Ohrekreis and Boerdekreis will unite to the new district Boerde (working title).

== Geography ==
The district is located on the plain called Magdeburg Börde (in the south), the Drömling (in the northwest) and the Colbitz-Letzlingen Heath (in the northeast), and named after the river Ohre which flows parallel to the canal &quot;Mittelland Canal&quot;. In the west the Aller flows through the district.
== Coat of arms ==

The topleft part of the coat of arms show a beech branch, symbolizing the beech forests in the district. The wavy line in the bottomright symbolizes the river Ohre, after which the district is named.

<doc id="300571" wikidata="Q224887" url="?curid=300571" title="End-of-life product">
<text>An end-of-life product (EOL product) is a product at the end of the product lifecycle, which prevents users from receiving updates, indicating that the product is at the end of its useful life (from the vendor&#x27;s point of view). At this stage, a vendor stops the marketing, selling, or provisioning of parts, services, or software updates for the product. The vendor may simply intend to limit or end support for the product. In the specific case of product sales, a vendor may employ the more specific term &quot;end-of-sale&quot; (&quot;EOS&quot;). All users can continue to access discontinued products, but cannot receive security updates and technical support. The time-frame after the last production date depends on the product and relates to the expected product lifetime from a customer&#x27;s point of view. Different lifetime examples include toys from fast food chains (weeks or months), mobile phones (3 years) and cars (10 years).

==Product support==

Product support during EOL varies by product. For hardware with an expected lifetime of 10 years after production ends, the support includes spare parts, technical support and service. Spare-part lifetimes are price-driven due to increasing production costs, as high-volume production sites are often closed when series production ends. Manufacturers may also continue to offer parts and services even when it is not profitable, to demonstrate good faith and to retain a reputation of durability. Minimum service lifetimes are also mandated by law for some products in some jurisdictions. Alternatively, some producers may discontinue maintenance of a product in order to force customers to upgrade to newer products.

==Computing==
In the computing arena, the concept of end-of-life has significance in the production, supportability and purchase of software and hardware products. For example, Microsoft marked Windows 98 for end-of-life on June 30, 2006. Software produced after that date may not work for it. Microsoft&#x27;s product Office 2007 (released on November 30, 2006), for instance, is not installable on Windows Me or any prior versions of Windows. Depending on the vendor, end-of-life may differ from end of &quot;service&quot; life, which has the added distinction that a vendor of systems or software will no longer provide maintenance, troubleshooting or other support. Such software that is abandoned service-wise by the original developers is also called abandonware. Sometimes, software vendors hand over software on end-of-life, end-of-sale or end-of-service to the user community, to allow them to provide service and further upgrades themselves. Notable examples are the web browser Netscape Communicator, which was released in 1998 by Netscape Communications under an open-source license to the public, and the office suite StarOffice, which was released by Sun Microsystems in October 2000 as OpenOffice.org (LibreOffice forked from this). Sometimes, software communities continue the support on end-of-official-support even without endorsement of the original developer, such developments are then called unofficial patches, existing for instance for Windows 98 or many PC games.

In an IT context, an end of life announcement (EOLA) may be issued to mark the commencement of a product&#x27;s end of life status. The EOLA may precede the last order date (LOD) by up to 90 days. Customers need to order the product before the last order date. JEDEC standards specify the end of the product life cycle. For example, the Sega Dreamcast&#x27;s EOLA was issued on January 31, 2001, 60 days before the last order date.

The end-of-life announcement happens before the product&#x27;s end of life.

<text>The pomerium or pomoerium was a religious boundary around the city of Rome and cities controlled by Rome. In legal terms, Rome existed only within its &quot;pomerium&quot;; everything beyond it was simply territory (&quot;ager&quot;) belonging to Rome.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;pōmērium&quot; is a classical contraction of the Latin phrase &quot;&quot; (). The Roman historian Livy writes in his &quot;Ab Urbe Condita&quot; that, although the etymology implies a meaning referring to a single side of the wall, the &quot;pomerium&quot; was originally an area of ground on both sides of city walls. He states that it was an Etruscan tradition to consecrate this area by augury and that it was technically unlawful to inhabit or to farm the area of the &quot;pomerium&quot;, which in part had the purpose of preventing buildings from being erected close to the wall (although he writes that, in his time, houses were in fact built against the wall on the line). Other writers suggest a derivation from , &quot;against the wall&quot;.

==Location and extensions==
Tradition maintained that the &quot;pomerium&quot; was the original line ritually ploughed by Romulus around the walls of the original city and that it was expanded by Servius Tullius. The legendary date of its demarcation, 21 April, continued to be celebrated as the anniversary of the city&#x27;s founding.

The &quot;pomerium&quot; did not follow the line of the Servian walls, and remained unchanged until the dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla, in a demonstration of his absolute power, expanded it in 80 BC. Several white marker stones (known as &quot;cippi&quot;) commissioned by Claudius have been found &quot;in situ&quot; and several have been found away from their original location. These stones mark the boundaries and relative dimensions of the &quot;pomerium&quot; extension by Claudius. This extension is recorded in Tacitus and outlined by Aulus Gellius. The latest pomerial stone from the reign of Claudius was discovered on 17 June 2021 in the vicinity of the Mausoleum of Augustus.
The &quot;pomerium&quot; was not a walled area, but rather a legally and religiously defined one marked by cippi. It encompassed neither the entire metropolitan area nor even all the Seven Hills (the Palatine Hill was within the &quot;pomerium&quot;, but the Capitoline and Aventine Hills were not). The Curia Hostilia and the well of the Comitium in the Forum Romanum, two extremely important locations in the government of the city-state and its empire, were located within the &quot;pomerium&quot;, while the Temple of Bellona was beyond the &quot;pomerium&quot;.

==Associated restrictions==
&quot;Pomerium&quot; represented a sacred boundary. According to Livy, violating the &quot;pomerium&quot; was akin to stretching the human body too far. 
*The magistrates who held &quot;imperium&quot; did not have full power inside the &quot;pomerium&quot;. They could have a citizen beaten, but not sentenced to death. This was symbolised by removing the axes from the fasces carried by the magistrate&#x27;s lictors. Only a dictator&#x27;s lictors could carry fasces containing axes inside the &quot;pomerium&quot;.
*It was forbidden to bury the dead inside the &quot;pomerium&quot;. During his life, Julius Caesar received in advance the right to a tomb inside the &quot;pomerium&quot;, but his ashes were actually placed in his family tomb. However, Trajan&#x27;s ashes were interred after his death in AD 117 at the foot of his Column, which was within the &quot;pomerium&quot;.
*Provincial promagistrates and generals were forbidden from entering the &quot;pomerium&quot;, and resigned their imperium immediately upon crossing it (as it was the superlative form of the ban on armies entering Italy). Ceremonies of triumph, in which an army would march through the city in celebration of a victory, were an exception to this rule, although a general could only enter the city on the very day of his triumph, and would be required to wait outside the &quot;pomerium&quot; with his troops until that moment. Under the Republic, soldiers also lost their status when entering, becoming citizens: thus soldiers at their general&#x27;s triumph wore civilian dress. The &quot;Comitia Centuriata&quot;, one of the Roman assemblies, consisting of centuriae (voting units, but originally military formations within the legions), was required to meet on the Campus Martius outside the &quot;pomerium&quot;. Similarly to the triumph, the Roman ovation also allowed a general to cross the &quot;pomerium&quot; without losing rank, but generally he could not bring his soldiers and had to enter on foot rather than on a chariot led by white horses.
*The Theatre of Pompey, where Julius Caesar was murdered, was outside the &quot;pomerium&quot; and included a chamber where the Senate could meet allowing the attendance of any senators who were forbidden to cross the &quot;pomerium&quot; and thus would not have been able to meet in the Curia Hostilia.
*Weapons were prohibited inside the &quot;pomerium&quot;. Praetorian Guards were allowed in only in civilian dress (toga), and were then called collectively &quot;cohors togata&quot;. But it was possible to sneak in daggers (the proverbial weapon for political violence; see &quot;sicarius&quot;). Since Julius Caesar&#x27;s assassination occurred outside this boundary, the senatorial conspirators could not be charged with sacrilege for carrying weapons inside the sacred city.

<doc id="300579" wikidata="Q630678" url="?curid=300579" title="Tree of Ténéré">
<text>The Tree of Ténéré (French: ) was a solitary acacia (&quot;Vachellia tortilis&quot; subsp. &quot;raddiana&quot;) that was once considered the most isolated tree on Earth. It was a landmark on caravan routes through the Ténéré region of the Sahara Desert in northeast Niger, so well-known that it and the Arbre Perdu (Lost Tree) to the north are the only trees to be shown on a map at a scale of 1:4,000,000. The tree is estimated to have existed for approximately 300 years until it was knocked down in 1973 by a drunk truck driver.

==Background==
The Tree of Ténéré was the last of a group of trees that grew along the Azalai when the Sahara desert was less parched than it is today. The tree had stood alone for decades. During the winter of 1938–1939, a well was dug near the tree and it was found that the roots of the tree reached the water table 33–36 meters (108 to 118 feet) below the surface.

Commander of the Allied Military Mission Michel Lesourd, of the [Central service of Saharan affairs], saw the tree on May 21, 1939:

In his book , French ethnologist and explorer Henri Lhote described his two journeys to the Tree of Ténéré. His first visit was in 1934 on the occasion of the first automobile crossing between Djanet and Agadez. He describes the tree as &quot;an Acacia with a degenerative trunk, sick or ill in aspect. Nevertheless, the tree has nice green leaves, and some yellow flowers&quot;. He visited it again 25 years later, on 26 November 1959 with the Berliet-Ténéré mission, but found that it had been badly damaged after a vehicle had collided with it:

==Death and monument==
The Tree of Ténéré was knocked down by a Libyan truck driver, reportedly drunk, in 1973. On November 8, 1973, the dead tree was installed in a dedicated shrine on the grounds of the Niger National Museum in Niamey.

A simple metal sculpture representing the tree stands to mark its former location and general appearance in the desert.

==In popular culture==
The sculpture representing the Tree of Ténéré and the Tree&#x27;s story feature prominently in the 2006 film &quot;La Gran final&quot; (&quot;The Great Match&quot;). In the film, a group of Tuareg nomads in the Sahara race to find a power supply and broadcast reception for their television in time to watch the 2002 FIFA World Cup Final between Germany and Brazil, eventually using the tree sculpture as a makeshift antenna.

In 2017, a group of artists created a massive, four-story tall LED sculpture entitled &quot;Tree of Tenere&quot; that was showcased at Burning Man. The sculpture consisted of 25,000 molded leaves containing 175,000 LEDs. In 2021 the artists re-developed the sculpture and created a permanent installation in the Deep Ellum neighborhood of Dallas, Texas.

In 2018, the tree&#x27;s story appeared as a main theme in the official music video of &quot;Transmission/Michaelion&quot; by Ibeyi.

<doc id="300587" wikidata="Q431490" url="?curid=300587" title="Gnomes (South Park)">
<text>&quot;Gnomes&quot; is the seventeenth and penultimate episode of the second season of the American animated television series &quot;South Park&quot;. The 30th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on December 16, 1998. The episode was written by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, along with Pam Brady, and directed by Parker. This episode marks the first appearance of Tweek Tweak and his parents.

In the episode, Harbucks plans to enter the South Park coffee market, posing a threat to the local coffee business owners, the Tweek Parents. Mr. Tweek, scheming to use the boys’ school report as a platform to fight Harbucks, convinces the boys to deliver their school report on the supposed threat corporatism poses to small businesses, moving the South Park community to take action against Harbucks.

&quot;Gnomes&quot; satirizes the common complaint that large corporations lack consciences and drive seemingly wholesome smaller independent companies out of business. Paul Cantor described the episode as &quot;the most fully developed defense of capitalism&quot; ever produced by the show because of various themes in the episode. In the episode, smaller businesses are portrayed as being at least as greedy as their corporate counterparts, while their products are of lower quality compared to the products offered by large corporations. The episode is also known for the nonsensical business plan that the gnomes of the title devise, whose three steps consist of:
# Collect underpants
# Profit 
which later became a common meme used to mock poorly-thought-out business and political strategies.

==Plot==

Mr. Garrison&#x27;s job is on the line because he does not teach anything relevant, so in an effort to save his job, he makes the class do oral presentations on a current event for the town committee. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny are grouped together with Tweek, a jittery child. Tweek suggests that the presentation be about the &quot;Underpants Gnomes&quot;, tiny gnomes that sneak into his house and steal his underpants. The boys agree to stay at Tweek&#x27;s house to work on Mr. Garrison&#x27;s homework assignment and to see if Underpants Gnomes exist.

Tweek&#x27;s parents, who own a coffee shop, give the boys coffee to help them stay up. The boys drink too much coffee, and end up wired, bouncing off the walls of Tweek&#x27;s bedroom rather than writing their report. Tweek claims the gnomes arrive at 3:30 a.m.; as the time approaches, the boys realize they have nothing to present. Tweek&#x27;s father enters the room, offering the boys a propagandist speech against Harbucks, a national chain of coffee houses that is threatening his business. As he does this, the gnomes steal underpants from Tweek&#x27;s dresser, but only Tweek notices them.

The boys&#x27; presentation is a hit, much to Mr. Garrison&#x27;s surprise; the town committee is so moved that they lobby Mayor McDaniels to pass a law against Harbucks. The mayor agrees to a so-called Prop 10, allowing the townspeople to vote on whether Harbucks may remain in South Park. Mr. Garrison, knowing that the boys did not write the first presentation, piles the pressure on, telling them they better follow through, or else Mr. Hat will do &quot;horrible things&quot; to them. After Cartman effortlessly turns the townspeople against Harbucks, it is revealed that the mayor expects the boys to do yet another presentation just before the vote. The boys, however, know nothing on the subject. As they are at their wits&#x27; end, they finally see Tweek&#x27;s gnomes and ply them for information. At the gnomes&#x27; lair, the gnomes claim to be business experts and explain their three-phase business plan:

: Phase 1: Collect underpants
: Phase 2: ?
: Phase 3: Profit

When the boys give their presentation for the vote, they do a report that is completely different from their previous piece. They now say, having spoken to the gnomes, that corporations are good, and are only big because of their great contributions to the world. While speaking, they admit that they did not write the previous paper, which causes Mr. Garrison to be carried away as he lashes out at the boys, telling them they have ruined his life for the last time. Mrs. Tweek applauds their honesty and admits to the same facts herself. She persuades the whole town to try Harbucks Coffee. When everybody does try it, they all agree that Harbucks coffee is better than Tweek&#x27;s coffee, including Mr. Tweek, who accepts an offer to run the Harbucks shop. Meanwhile, the gnomes continue to steal underpants from the oblivious townspeople.

==Production==

&quot;Gnomes&quot; was written by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, along with Pam Brady, and directed by Parker. It is the seventeenth episode in the second season of &quot;South Park&quot; and the 30th episode of the series overall. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on December 16, 1998. &quot;Gnomes&quot; marks the first appearance of Tweek Tweek and his parents.

==Theme==

The episode satirizes the common complaint that large corporations lack scruples and drive seemingly wholesome smaller independent companies out of business. Paul Cantor, a literary critic and economic theorist who taught college courses revolving around the &quot;Gnomes&quot; episode, described it as &quot;the most fully developed defense of capitalism&quot; ever produced by the show. Cantor said the episode challenges the stereotype that small businesses are public servants who truly care about their customers by portraying local business owner Mr. Tweek as greedier and having fewer scruples than that of the corporation he is challenging; Tweek knowingly takes advantage of American distrust for big businesses and nostalgia for simpler times in his fight to maintain his bottom line. At the end of the episode, Kyle and Stan conclude big corporations are good because of the services they provide people, and uphold the notion that the businesses providing the best product deserve to succeed in the marketplace and grow to become larger.

==Cultural impact==
Following the episode&#x27;s release, the underpants gnomes, and particularly the business plan lacking a second stage between &quot;Collect underpants&quot; and &quot;Profit&quot;, became an Internet meme and has been widely used by many journalists and business critics as a metaphor for failed, internet bubble-era business plans and ill-planned political goals. Cantor said &quot;no episode of &quot;South Park&quot; I have taught has raised as much raw passion, indignation, and hostility among students as &#x27;Gnomes&#x27; has. I&#x27;m not sure why, but I think it has something to do with the defensiveness of elitists confronted with their own elitism.&quot; In January 2013, when it was announced that Parker and Stone were opening a new production studio, Important Studios, both the pair and their investors were jokingly compared to the gnomes included in &quot;Gnomes&quot;.

Elon Musk referenced the underpants gnomes&#x27; plan in his presentation on Mars conquest in September 2016.

Mark Painter compared the &quot;plan lacking a second stage&quot; of socialism between &quot;capitalism creates alienated labor and pauperism&quot; and &quot;socialist revolution leading to world communist utopia&quot; to the underpants gnomes in his &quot;History of The Twentieth Century&quot; podcast episode 271 &quot;The Roots of Fascism&quot; in which he compares and contrasts socialism, liberalism, conservatism and fascism.

==Cultural references==
*The Harbucks company is a reference to Starbucks, one of the largest coffee house chain companies in the world.
*Gnomes are often associated with the world of finance. Several commentators suggested the gnomes in &quot;South Park&quot; could be a reference to the phrase Gnomes of Zurich, a disparaging term for Swiss bankers.

==Home media==
All 18 episodes of the second season, including &quot;Gnomes&quot;, were released on a DVD box set on June 3, 2003.

<text>Whale watching is the practice of observing whales and dolphins (cetaceans) in their natural habitat. Whale watching is mostly a recreational activity (cf. birdwatching), but it can also serve scientific and/or educational purposes. A study prepared for International Fund for Animal Welfare in 2009 estimated that 13 million people went whale watching globally in 2008. Whale watching generates $2.1 billion per annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers. The size and rapid growth of the industry has led to complex and continuing debates with the whaling industry about the best use of whales as a natural resource.

== History ==
Organized whale watching started in the United States, when Cabrillo National Monument in San Diego was declared a public venue for observing the migration of gray whales; the spectacle attracted 10,000 visitors in its first year, 1950. In 1955 the first water-based whale watching commenced in the same area, charging customers $1 per trip to view the whales at closer quarters. The industry spread throughout the western coast of the United States over the following decade.

In 1971 the Montreal Zoological Society commenced the first commercial whale watching activity on the eastern side of North America, offering trips in the St. Lawrence River to view fin and beluga whales. By the mid-1970s, live captures for aquaria had reduced the orca populations in the coastal waters of British Columbia and Washington, particularly the southern resident orca population. According to their scientific chroniclers, in the 1980s commercial whale watching started becoming an alternative means of viewing and appreciating orcas. In 1984, Erich Hoyt, who had spent much time amongst the orcas of British Columbia, published the first comprehensive book on whale watching, &quot;The Whale Watcher&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, which Mark Carwardine called his number one &quot;natural classic&quot; book in &quot;BBC Wildlife&quot; magazine.

By 1985 more visitors watched whales from New England than California. The rapid growth in this area has been attributed to the relatively dense population of humpback whales, whose acrobatic behavior such as breaching (jumping out of the water) and tail-slapping thrilled observers, and the close proximity of whale populations to the large cities there.

Whale watching tourism has grown substantially since the mid-1980s. The first worldwide survey of whale watching was conducted by Hoyt for the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDCS) in 1992. It was updated in 1995 and submitted by the UK government to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meetings as a demonstration of the value of living whales. In 1999, the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) asked Hoyt for another expansion, which was published in 2001. In 2009 the survey was completed by a team of economists and this report estimated that in 2008, 13 million people went whale watching, up from 9 million ten years earlier. Commercial whale watching operations were found in 119 countries. Direct revenue of whale watching trips was estimated at US$872.7 million and indirect revenue of $2,113.1 million was spent by whale watchers in tourism-related businesses.

Whale watching is of particular importance to developing countries. Coastal communities have started to profit directly from the whales&#x27; presence, significantly adding to popular support for the protection of these animals from commercial whaling and other threats such as bycatch and ship strikes using the tool of marine protected areas and sanctuaries. In 2007, the Humane Society International sponsored a series of workshops to introduce whale watching to coastal Peru and commissioned Hoyt to write a blueprint for high quality, sustainable whale watching. This manual, later translated into Spanish, French, Indonesian, Japanese, Chinese and Dutch, with co-sponsorship from WDCS, IFAW and Global Ocean was updated in English in 2012 in ebook form.

== Conservation ==

The rapid growth of the number of whale watching trips and the size of vessel used to watch whales may affect whale behavior, migratory patterns and breeding cycles. There is now strong evidence that whale watching can significantly affect the biology and ecology of whales and dolphins.

Environmental campaigners, concerned by what they consider the &quot;quick-buck&quot; mentality of some boat owners, continue to strongly urge all whale watcher operators to contribute to local regulations governing whale watching (no international standard set of regulations exist because of the huge variety of species and populations). Common rules include:

*Minimize speed/&quot;No wake&quot; speed
*Avoid sudden turns
*Minimize noise
*Do not pursue, encircle or come in between whales
*Approach animals from angles where they will not be taken by surprise
*Consider cumulative impact – minimize number of boats at any one time/per day
*Do not coerce dolphins into bow-riding.
*Do not allow swimming with dolphins. (This last rule is more contentious and is often disregarded in, for example, the Caribbean.) In New Zealand, the rules adopted under the Marine Mammals Protection Act specifically allow swimming with dolphins and seals but not with juvenile dolphins or a pod of dolphins that includes juvenile dolphins.

In Uruguay, where whales can be watched from the beach, legislators have designated the country&#x27;s territorial waters as a sanctuary for whales and dolphins. It is illegal to be less than 300 metres from a whale.

== Locations ==

Whale watching tours are available in various locations and climates. By area, they are:

===Atlantic and Indian oceans===
==== South Africa ====

In South Africa, the town of Hermanus is one of the world centers for whale watching. Between May and December southern right whales come so close to the Cape shoreline that visitors can watch whales from their hotels. The town employs a &quot;whale crier&quot; (cf town crier) to walk through the town announcing where whales have been seen.

You can watch the whales in Hermanus from the cliff tops, from a boat or the air. Boat-based whale watching tours are available out of the Hermanus New harbour which allows the public to view southern right whales from June till Mid December. Port Elizabeth runs a boat-based whale watching tour out of the Port Elizabeth harbour which allows the public to view southern right whales from July to November, humpback whales from June to August and November to January, and Bryde&#x27;s whales all year round, up-close. Visitors can also see humpback whales from the lighthouse at Cape Recife (the Westerly point of Algoa Bay), and southern right whales from viewing points along the coast. Boat-based whale watching (and dolphin watching) is also a popular tourist attraction in a number of other coastal towns in South Africa, such as Plettenberg Bay, where the industry is linked to conservation and education efforts through Plettenberg Bay-based volunteer marine conservation organisations. Plettenberg Bay is visited by southern right whales in the winter months and humpback whales in the summer months. Bryde&#x27;s whales are resident throughout the year. The other famous centre for whale watching is False Bay. Tours leave Gordon&#x27;s Bay and follow the coast around the bay. Species include southern right whales, humpback whales and Bryde&#x27;s whales. Orcas are present during the winter months. Visitors include pilot whales and pygmy sperm whales. Many species of dolphin are encountered including Heaviside&#x27;s dolphins. The same tours include great white sharks at Seal Island and the African Penguin Colony at Simon&#x27;s Town.

==== Southwest Atlantic – Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay====

In Brazil, humpbacks are observed off Salvador in Bahia State and at the National Marine Park of Abrolhos during their breeding season in austral winter and spring. Likewise, southern right whales are observed from shore in Santa Catarina State and Espírito Santo during the same season. Mother/calf pairs can come as close to shore as 30 meters (about 100 feet). Income from whale watching bolsters coastal communities and has made the township of Imbituba, the Brazilian &quot;whale capital&quot;.

In Argentina, Península Valdés in Patagonia hosts (in winter) the largest breeding population of southern right whales, with more than 2,000 catalogued by the Whale Conservation Institute and Ocean Alliance. The region contains six natural reserves, and is considered to be one of the premier whale watching destinations in the world, particularly around the town of Puerto Pirámides and the city of Puerto Madryn, as the whales come within of the main beach and play a major part in the large ecotourism industry in the region.

In Uruguay, southern right whales are observable from the beach in two coastal departments – Maldonado and Rocha – from June to November. The points where most sightings in Maldonado are made are Punta Colorada, Punta Negra, Playa Mansa and Punta Salinas in Punta del Este, and in Rocha off La Paloma and La Pedrera beaches.

==== Northeast Atlantic ====
Tidal straits, inlets, lagoons, and varying water temperatures provide diverse habitats for multiple cetacean species. Substantial numbers live off the coasts of Great Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Scandinavia, Portugal, Spain, and France. Commercial car ferries crossing the Bay of Biscay from Britain and Ireland to Spain and France often pass by enormous blue whales and much smaller harbor porpoise. Land-based tours can often view these animals.

Off the south coast of Ireland, humpback whales and fin whales are regularly seen on organized whale watching trips between July and February. Species seen all year include minke whales, orcas, harbour porpoises, and common, bottlenose, and Risso&#x27;s dolphins. There is also a resident group of bottlenose dolphins in the Shannon Estuary which attracts tourists all year round.
Chanonry Point is one of the best spots in the UK to view bottlenose dolphins. The dolphins are visible from the shore, particularly on an incoming tide when they play and fish in the strong currents. Other wildlife, including porpoises and grey seals, can also regularly be spotted.

In Northern Norway (Nordland and Troms counties) orcas are visible in the Vestfjorden, Tysfjorden, Ofotfjorden and Andfjorden as the herring gathers in the fjords to stay over the winter and off the Lofoten islands during the summer. At Andenes on Andøya in Vesterålen and around Krøttøya in Troms, sperm whales can be observed year round, summer whale watching trips occur from May till September, winter trips with killer whales and humpback whales are offered from October till April. Tromsø also offers whale watching for sperm and other whales. The continental shelf Eggakanten and deep water where the sperm whales congregate, is very close to shore, beginning only from the Andenes harbour.

In Portugal whale watching is available in the Algarve. Lagos and Portimão are the most important whale-watching places. The species observed in this area are the fin, killer, and pilot whale, and the bottlenose, common, and striped dolphin.

In the middle of the Northeast Atlantic, around the Madeira, the Azores and the Cape Verde archipelagos, whale watching is on the increase and popular due to more protection and education. One of the most common whales in these regions is the sperm whale, especially groups of calving females.

In Spain whale watching is available along the Strait of Gibraltar, the Canary Islands, and in the Bay of Biscay. Tarifa is the most important whale watching town in the Strait of Gibraltar; this gateway to the Mediterranean Sea is also a central point in between the colder waters to the North and the tropical waters off of Africa: a good route for migrating cetaceans. The species observed in this area are the bottlenose, common, and striped dolphin, and the pilot, sperm, fin, and killer whale.
In the Canary Islands it is possible to see these and others, such as the blue, beaked, false killer, and Bryde&#x27;s whale, and the Atlantic spotted, rough-toothed, and Risso&#x27;s dolphin.

In Iceland it is possible to see whales in Eyjafjörður, Breiðafjörður, Skjálfandi and Faxaflói. The towns offering whale watching are Dalvík, Hauganes, Húsavík, Akureyri, Hólmavík, Grundarfjörður and Reykjavík. Most common are the minke, humpback, blue, killer, and sperm whale, as well as the white-beaked dolphin, and the harbour porpoise.

==== Northwest Atlantic ====
In New England and off the east coast of Long Island in the United States, the whale watching season typically takes place from about mid-spring through October, depending both on weather and precise location. It is here that the humpback whale, fin whale, minke whale, and the very endangered/heavily protected North Atlantic right whale are often observed. For generations, areas like the Gulf of Maine and Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (part of the inner waters formed by Cape Cod&#x27;s hooked shape) have been important feeding grounds for these species: to this day a very large portion of the waters off the Eastern Seaboard are rich in sand lance and other nutritious treats for mothers to teach their calves to feed on.

In the past this area was the US whaling industry&#x27;s capital, particularly Nantucket, an island just off the coast of Massachusetts. Though whaling has been banned for many years, and strict laws prohibit molestation of these large wild mammals, it is not unknown for the whales to approach whale watching boats uninvited, particularly curious calves and juveniles: it is not unknown in particular, for example, for juvenile humpbacks to approach the boat and spyhop to get a better look at the humans aboard. In recent years it is also not uncommon to see these animals playing and feeding in harbors, including New York City or Boston where fish species of interest to the whales have lately returned in astonishing numbers. As of 2011, an expert from Cornell University has recorded the vocalizations of six whale species including the humpback, the fin whale, and the massive blue whale within close proximity of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in the lower portion of New York Harbor and there is at least one company offering marine life tours out of The Rockaway Peninsula in Queens. Due to these increasingly frequent visits, new laws address the safety of boaters, commercial fishermen, and the whales themselves: off the coast of Boston, for example, cargo vessels must slow down to protect the much slower North Atlantic right whale and there is talk of erecting an apparatus for the much more heavily trafficked waters surrounding New York City that can warn boats of a whale&#x27;s presence and location so as to avoid accidentally striking the animal. Because of the relative diversity of whales and dolphins within easy access of shore, cetacean research takes place at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, and the Riverhead Foundation among other centers.
Eastern Canada has many whale watching tours in the estuary and gulf of St. Laurence River, in Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, Nova Scotia or New Brunswick. Twenty-two species of whales and dolphins frequent the waters of Newfoundland and Labrador, although the most common are the humpback, minke, fin, Beluga and killer whales. Another popular whale-watching area is at Tadoussac, Quebec, where Belugas favor the extreme depth and admixture of cold fresh water from the Saguenay River into the inland end of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Humpbacks, minkes, fin and blue whales are also frequently seen off Tadoussac. The Bay of Fundy is an equally important feeding ground for large baleen whales and dozens of other creatures of the sea; it shares a population of migrating humpbacks with America and is a known summer nursery for mother right whales with calves.

On the east coast of the United States, Virginia Beach, Virginia whale watching is a winter activity from the end of December until the middle of March. Fin, humpback, and right whales are seen off the Virginia Beach coast on whale watching boat trips run by the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center. Sightings are mostly of juveniles who stay near the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay where food is plentiful, while the adults continue to the Caribbean to mate. &quot;Mom&quot; and &quot;Dad&quot; pick up their offspring on the way back north where the whole family summers.

Ecotourism based on kayak trips is gaining in popularity in warm-water vacation destinations such as Sarasota Keys. Guided kayak trips take kayakers on a tour of the local ecosystem. Kayakers can watch dolphins breach and manatees eat sea grass, in shallow bay water.

The waters surrounding Virginia are also a known migration corridor for the endangered North Atlantic right whale: Pregnant females must pass through this area around December to reach their birthing grounds down the coast in Georgia and Florida. For these reasons the waters between the Delmarva Peninsula and the barrier islands that stretch southwards towards northern Florida must be monitored every winter and spring as mothers give birth to their calves, nurse them, and then ready themselves and their younglings to return north for the cooler waters near New England and Canada.

==== Caribbean ====
About 25 species are observed in the Caribbean Sea&#x27;s waters, such as humpback whales, sperm whales, beaked whales and many other small cetaceans. Principal whale watching activities are done in Samaná Bay in the Dominican Republic, a known breeding ground for humpbacks. Caribwhale and the Caribbean Whale Watch Association include operators engaged in sustainable whale watching activity, as well as experts, conservationists and research groups, such as the International Fund for Animal Welfare, Dalhousie University and Association Evasion Tropicale.

==== Northern Indian Ocean ====
On the South and East Coasts of Sri Lanka and The Maldives, the industry is growing. During winter and summer, pygmy blue and sperm whales cross the southern tip of the island, migrating to the warmer waters of Southeast Asia.
Many pygmy blue whales can be seen at Dondra point in Sri Lanka, accessed through the Mirissa or Weligama harbour. Whale-watching tours can be arranged in Sri Lanka.
Blue whales and some types of dolphins can be seen in the sea of Mirissa in Sri Lanka. Many sightings have been reported from November to April.

==== Northern Mediterranean Sea ====

In the Pelagos Sanctuary for Mediterranean Marine Mammals, located in the waters of Italy, France and Monaco, there are eight species of marine mammals residents, most of them all year. Frequent summer excursions depart from the ports of Genoa and Imperia, in Liguria, Northern Italy.

===Pacific Ocean===
==== East Pacific –Colombia, Ecuador &amp; Panama====
In Colombia, the towns of Bahía Solano and Nuquí are visited by a large number of Humpback whales from late July to the beginning of October. In southern Costa Rica, Marino Ballena National Park has two seasons when whales visit.

In Panama, the Pearl Islands archipelago receive an estimated 300 humpbacks whale from late June to late November. These had become now the main attraction for whale watching tours starting in Panama City. In the Gulf of Chiriqui, the World Heritage Site of Coiba Island National Park and the islands near the town of Boca Chica are offering opportunities for whale watching. Isla Iguana near Pedasi is now a popular destination for whale watchers. Several foundations train local community members to perform as guide and captains for whale watching tours.

In Ecuador, from June to September, there are many sites from which large groups of humpback whales can be seen, including Isla de la Plata (AKA Little Galapagos) and Salinas, at the tip of the Santa Elena Peninsula.

==== Northeast Pacific –Mexico and United States====
On the West Coast of Canada and the United States, excellent whale watching can be found in Alaska (summer), British Columbia, and the San Juan Islands/Puget Sound in Washington, where whales are 
sighted from shore nearly every day, year-round. Three types of orca pods can be observed in the Northeast Pacific: resident, transient, and offshore killer whales.

On the Oregon Coast, several whale species, especially gray whales, may be seen year-round, and the state trains volunteers to assist tourists in the winter months, during whale migration season. In California, good whale-watching can be found year-round on the Southern California coast. During the winter and spring (December–May), gray whales can be seen from shore on their annual migration (the best spot being Point Vicente), while blue whales are often seen between July and October. Fin whales, minke whales, orcas, and various species of dolphins can be seen year-round. In spring, summer, and fall at the Farallon Islands off San Francisco, one may see humpbacks, grays, and blue whales.

In Mexico, the various lagoons of Baja California Sur become breeding habitat for gray whales in February and March.
Humpback whales can be seen off the southern tip of Baja California, and off Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco on the west coast of Mexico, and Barra de Potosi on the south coast of Mexico in the state of Guerrero. A number of towns in Mexico celebrate the whale&#x27;s arrival with festivals such as Guerrero Negro, in the first half of February and the port of San Blas on 24 and 25 February.

In late March 2021, a blue whale was spotted near the Orange County, California coastline. These mammals are typically seen in summer months, but this blue whale was spotted out of season, heading north, close to the Balboa Pier and Newport Beach shoreline.

==== Central Pacific –Hawaii====
Each winter 4,000 to 10,000 North Pacific humpback whales migrate from Alaska to Hawaii. In the vast waters that line Alaska&#x27;s coast, an encounter with a whale is likely. In the summer, after thousands of whales have made their way to the rich feeding grounds of Alaska waters, sightings are extremely common. Whale watching is possible within as well as outside the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary. The best places to see whales in Hawaiʻi is in the protected channels between the Hawaiʻian islands. The best months to see the whales here are January and February when you can expect to see between 2 and 4 whales per 15 minute period, although fluctuations between 0 and 20 sightings are normal.

==== West Pacific –East and Southeast Asia ====

Many countries in Asia have large whale watching industries. In 2008 the largest, in terms of number of tourists, were mainland China, Taiwan and Japan. India, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, the Philippines and the Maldives also have dolphin watching and some whale watching. China&#x27;s dolphin watching is almost entirely focussed on Sanniang Bay in Guangxi. Taiwan has several whale watching ports on its east coast. Japan has a range of whale and dolphin watching businesses on all main islands and Okinawa, Zamami, Ogasawara, Mikura-Jima and Miyake-jima.

In the Philippines, over thirty species of whales and dolphins can be observed around Pamilacan in Central Visayas, Davao Gulf, the northern coast of the province-island Babuyan Islands in Batanes, Pasaleng Bay, and Malampaya Sound, Palawan. The Visayas is particularly known area for dolphin sightings, and is home to one of the larger populations of the Fraser&#x27;s dolphin in the world. Dolphin species in the Visayas are attracted to fish lures and to commercial fishing operations. In the northernmost province of Batanes, at least 12 species of whales and dolphins has been sighted, making it the single location in the country with the highest cetacean diversity. There seems to be no specific whale watching season in the Philippines, although the calmer waters of the summer season typically provides the best conditions. Some populations, like those of the Irrawaddy dolphin, Bryde&#x27;s whale, and humpback whales in Batanes, appear migratory. Other populations have yet to be studied. Some former coastal whaling communities in the Philippines have also started to generate whale watching income.

====Southeast Pacific –Chile and Peru====
In the Gulf of Corcovado and the waters of Guaitecas Archipelago a variety of whales and dolphins can be been spotted, including: Peale&#x27;s dolphins, black dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, humpback whales, minke whales and killer whales. The Gulf of Corcovado is &quot;arguably the largest feeding and nursing ground for blue whales [...] in the entire Southern Hemisphere&quot;. All of this makes Guaitecas Archipelago a privilidged place for whale watching. In the localities of Piñihuil, Quellón and Melinka local fishermen offer whale watching tours.

==== Southwest Pacific – New Zealand and Australia====

Kaikōura in New Zealand is a world-famous whale-watching site. The sea around Kaikōura supports an abundance of sea life, with the town&#x27;s income stemming largely from the tourism generated from whale watching and swimming with or around dolphins. Recently the sperm whale watching at Kaikōura has developed rapidly and now it is an industry leader, arguably the most developed in the world. The town went into recession after the collapse of whaling in New Zealand. Its recent development has been used to advocate the benefits of watching whales instead of hunting them.

The Sunshine Coast and Hervey Bay (where the whales stay and rest before migrating) in Queensland, Australia offer reliable whale watching conditions for southern humpback whales from the end of June through to the end of November each year. Whale numbers and activity have increased markedly in recent years. Sydney, Eden, Port Stephens, Narooma and Byron Bay in New South Wales are other popular hot spots for tours from May to November.

Southern right whales are seen June–August along the south coast of Australia. They are often readily viewed from the coast around Encounter Bay near Victor Harbor and up to a hundred at a time may be seen from the cliff tops at the head of the Great Australian Bight near Yalata. See also Whaling in Australia.

In Western Australia, whales are watched near Cape Naturaliste in the south-east Indian Ocean and at Cape Leeuwin where the Indian and Southern Oceans meet.

In the Southern Ocean there are many spots to see whales, both from land or aboard ship. Albany on the south coast of Western Australia the town where the last land based whaling station in the southern hemisphere was located is now home to a thriving whale watching industry. In Victoria a popular site is Logan&#x27;s Beach at Warrnambool, as well as in the waters off Port Fairy and Portland. In Tasmania whales can be seen all along the east coast and even on the River Derwent. In South Australia whales are watched in the Great Australian Bight Marine Park areas and closer to Adelaide at Victor Harbor.

In eastern Australia, whale watching occurs in many spots along the Pacific coast. From headlands, whales may often be seen making their migration south. At times, whales even make it into Sydney Harbour.

New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife took an active role in 2010 during the peak southern whale watching season between May and November with the launch of its whale watching site.

== Whaling and whale watching ==
The three biggest whaling nations (Canada, Greenland and Norway) have growing whale watching industries. The next four whaling nations (Japan, United States, Russia and Iceland) also have whale watching industries. Indeed, Iceland had the fastest-growing whale watching industry in the world between 1994 and 1998.

===Canada===
Whale watching and hunting take place in different regions of Canada: the former mainly on Atlantic and Pacific coasts, the latter exclusively in the Arctic. Whale watching happens in the Saint Lawrence River, western Hudson&#x27;s Bay near Churchill, and British Columbia. Hunting takes place in eastern Hudson&#x27;s Bay (Nunavik, Quebec), Nunavut and the Beaufort Sea. Researchers have suggested the hunting areas would benefit more from whale watching than hunting since hunting takes more resources than it earns. In 2018, 
Canada implemented new restrictions intended to cut human interactions with whales. Following these rules, all boats must stay farther away from the mammals than before. Some activities, including snorkeling with humpbacks, are banned.

===Greenland===

Greenland has small whale watching operations in Disko Bay and Nuuk. Both areas have beluga hunts. There has been controversy over who is allowed to participate in hunts and consume the meat.

=== Norway ===

Enjoyment of observing live cetaceans is rather separated from the domestic whaling industry in Norway; however, whale watching has become a popular national tourist attraction in recent years, especially in Andfjorden (Vesterålen and Troms) and around Tromsø.
*Uniquely, public opinions against whaling showed sudden rises in 2014, when a possibly pregnant minke whale &quot;Heiko&quot;, named after Keiko the orca and a local cetacean researcher Heike Vester who monitors the whale&#x27;s safety, successfully shook off whaling vessels by taking refuge in the very shallow fjord of Lofoten, where large whales had not been seen for years; this has provided chances for locals to witness cetaceans at close range. Heiko&#x27;s appearance soon resulted in an increase in interest among locals. As time passed, Heiko attracted more domestic and international interest, which has resulted in greater questioning and opposition to the whaling industry in Norway.

=== Japan ===

Erich Hoyt and other conservationists argue that a whale is worth more alive and watched than dead. The goal is to persuade their governments to curtail whaling activities. This debate continues at the International Whaling Commission, particularly since whaling countries complain that the scarcity of whale meat and other products has increased their value. However, the whale meat market has collapsed, and in Japan the government subsidizes the market through distribution in schools and other promotion. In 1997, 2,000 tonnes of whale meat were sold for $30m – a 10-tonne minke whale would thus have been worth $150,000. There is no agreement as to how to value a single animal although its true value is probably much higher. However, it is clear from most coastal communities that are involved in whale watching that profits can be made and are more horizontally distributed throughout the community than if the animals were killed by the whaling industry.
*There have been disputes and skirmishes between whale watching operators and whalers in the nation. For example, whaling was operated right in front of watching vessels, causing malaise among domestic and international passengers on board, and domestic disputes spread on the Internet in Nemuro Strait in 2007. Local tour operators confirmed that targeted species for hunting such as Baird&#x27;s beaked whales and Dall&#x27;s porpoises are known to disappear or have become harder to approach in the seasons of whaling operations in the area. Recent notable declines and disappearances (or abandoning of historical habitats) of minke and Baird&#x27;s beaked whales in coastal waters caused by commercial and scientific whaling that have been operated in wide ranges off the eastern half of Honshu and Hokkaido especially off Abashiri, Gulf of Sendai, and along the coast of Chiba, caused dramatic decreases in sightings of both species in many areas, enough for whalers to be forced to change their operating ranges, and a watching operator in Muroran claimed that whaling affected the profits of the operator due to serious declines and low rates of successful minke sightings in the area. Hunting of Baird&#x27;s beaked whales in Sea of Japan has ceased in recent decades, and the whales have been said to have become more friendly during this period; however, commercial whaling was resumed in Sea of Japan and caused concerns among cetacean conservationists.
*The first whale watching in Japan was conducted in Bonin Islands in 1998 by a group called &quot;Geisharen &quot;鯨者連&quot;&quot; which was formed by groups of domestic and international people including both domestic and international celebrities and notable cetacean researchers and conservationists such as Roger Payne, Erich Hoyt, Richard Oliver, Jim Darling, John Ford, Kyusoku Iwamoto (cartoonist), Hutoushiki Ueki (science writer), Nobuyuki Miyazaki (head chief of the Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute of The University of Tokyo), Nobuaki Mochizuki (one of the world&#x27;s first whale photographers to record a North Pacific right whale underwater in 1990 in Bonin Islands), and Junko Sakuma (freelancer). During this time until before the group reach the destination, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan) and other groups and anonymous individuals watched the group&#x27;s movements and tried to pressure them not to conduct the tour. Prior to this movement, those who claimed conserving marine mammals including pinnipeds, or individuals who tried to correct illegal and over-extensive hunts (including C. W. Nicol, who was a sympathizer with Japan&#x27;s whaling industries) or domestic media that have done reporting assignments in Japan had been discriminated. These include a former fisherman who was ostracized from the community, later to become a whale-watching operator. Several other tours have been operated by former whalers or dolphin hunters in places such as Abashiri and Muroto.

===Russia===

Russian whale watching involves orcas off the Kamchatka peninsula on the edge of the Sea of Okhotsk.

Beluga are hunted in the Sea of Okhotsk as well as farther north. Erich Hoyt of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society has identified other places in Russia to develop whale watching.

=== Iceland ===
Upon the resumption of whaling in Iceland in August 2003, pro-whaling groups, such as fishermen who argue that increased stocks of whales deplete fish populations, suggested that sustainable whaling and whale watching could live side by side. Whale watching lobbyists, such as Húsavík Whale Museum curator Asbjorn Bjorgvinsson, counter that the most inquisitive whales, which approach boats very closely and provide much of the entertainment on whale-watching trips, will be the first to be taken. Pro-whaling organisations such as the High North Alliance on the other hand, claim that some whale-watching companies in Iceland are surviving only because they receive funding from anti-whaling organizations. In 2020, Iceland ceased whaling activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and decreasing sales to Japan limited the feasibility of a harvest. That same year, whaling for minke whales by the only company targeting domestic markets was permanently ended. A similar decision to halt all whaling activities was made for the summer whaling season of 2021 in light of ongoing pandemic restrictions and steady increases in whale watching tourism.

=== Portugal ===
In comparison, the government of the Azores has promoted an economic policy centred on tourism that includes whale watching. With the decline of whaling in the early 1970s in the islands, many of the communities of the archipelago involved in whaling (including villages and towns, specifically on the islands of Faial, Terceira, São Miguel and Pico) were transformed into hubs for whale watching services (that followed the migratory tracts during the summer), while older buildings and factories were re-purposed into museums.

<text>Gilbert Frank Amelio (born March 1, 1943) is an American technology executive. Amelio worked at Bell Labs, Fairchild Semiconductor, and the semiconductor division of Rockwell International, and was also the CEO of National Semiconductor and Apple Computer.

==Early life and career==
Amelio grew up in Miami, Florida, of Italian born parents, and graduated from Miami High School. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree, master&#x27;s degree, and PhD in physics from the Georgia Institute of Technology. While at Georgia Tech, Amelio was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity.

Amelio joined Bell Labs as a researcher in 1968.
In 1970, Amelio was on the team that demonstrated the first working charge-coupled device (CCD).
He moved to Fairchild Semiconductor in 1971, where he led the development of the first commercial CCD image sensors in the early 1970s, and in 1977 became head of the MOS division.
He worked his way up to president of the semiconductor division of Rockwell International, and then its communications systems division.

Amelio joined National Semiconductor as president and chief executive in February 1991.

==Apple Computer==
In 1994 Amelio joined the board of directors of Apple. After his resignation from National Semiconductor, Amelio became Apple CEO on February 2, 1996, succeeding Michael Spindler. His salary was a reported $990,000 plus bonuses and a $5 million loan. He also received approximately $100,000 for the use of his business jet by Apple the previous year according to the section &quot;Certain Transactions&quot; in the Apple Proxy Statement for 1996.

Amelio cited several problems at Apple including a shortage of cash and liquidity, low-quality products, lack of a viable operating system strategy, undisciplined corporate culture, and fragmentation in trying to do too much and in too many directions. To address these problems Amelio cut costs, reduced Apple&#x27;s work force by one third, discontinued the Copland operating system project, and oversaw the development of Mac OS 8.

To replace Copland and fulfill the need for a next generation operating system Amelio started negotiations to buy BeOS from Be Inc. but negotiations stalled when Be CEO Jean-Louis Gassée demanded $275 million; Apple was unwilling to offer more than $200 million. In November 1996 Amelio started discussions with Steve Jobs&#x27;s NeXT, and bought the company on February 4, 1997, for $400 million.

During Amelio&#x27;s tenure Apple&#x27;s stock continued to slump and hit a 12-year low in Q2 1997 that was at least partially caused by a single sale of 1.5 million shares of Apple stock on June 26 by an anonymous party who was later confirmed to be Steve Jobs. Apple lost another $708 million. On the July 4, 1997 weekend, Jobs convinced the directors to oust Amelio in a boardroom coup; Amelio submitted his resignation less than a week later; and Jobs then became interim CEO on September 16. Jobs later quoted Amelio as having said:

Apple is like a ship with a hole in the bottom, leaking water, and my job is to get the ship pointed in the right direction.

It was reported that Amelio&#x27;s contract gave him about $3.5 million in severance pay, after a $2.3 million performance bonus in 1996.

==Post-Apple career==
Since 1998 Amelio has been a venture capitalist. In February 2001, Amelio became CEO of Advanced Communications Technologies (ADC). ADC is the United States arm of an Australian firm that has developed a product for the wireless communications industry called SpectruCell. He became senior partner at Sienna Ventures in Sausalito, California in May 2001.

In 2005 he co-founded Acquicor with ex-Apple CTO Ellen Hancock and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Acquicor acquired Jazz Semiconductor in early 2007, and sold it in 2008 for a loss.

Amelio was a director and chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association. Since 1996 he has been an advisor to the Malaysia Multimedia Super Corridor and to Malaysia&#x27;s Prime Minister. In June 2003 he was named chairman of the board of Ripcord Networks; where he joined Steve Wozniak, Ellen Hancock, and other Apple alumni. Amelio was a board member of AT&amp;T Inc., Pacific Telesis, Chiron Corporation, Sematech, InterDigital, and Georgia Tech (as chairman), as well as a trustee of the American Film Institute.

He was a contributor to the report &quot;An American Imperative&quot; (1993), and author of the books &quot;Profit from Experience&quot; (1995, ) and &quot;On the Firing Line: My 500 Days at Apple&quot; (1998, ).

In November 2020, Amelio joined the board of directors for Nashville-based augmented reality startup VideoBomb.

Amelio joined the board of directors for Computer Museum of America in September 2023.

==Awards and honors==
Amelio is an IEEE Fellow. He received the IEEE Masaru Ibuka Consumer Electronics Award in 1991 for contributions to the development of the charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensors in consumer video cameras. He has been awarded 16 patents.
