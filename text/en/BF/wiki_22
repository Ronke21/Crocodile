<text>Lugano (, ; ; ) is a city and municipality within the Lugano District in the canton of Ticino, Switzerland. It is the largest city in both Ticino and the Italian-speaking region of southern Switzerland. Lugano has a population () of , and an urban agglomeration of over 150,000. It is the ninth largest Swiss city.

The city lies on Lake Lugano, at its largest width, and, together with the adjacent town of Paradiso, occupies the entire bay of Lugano. The territory of the municipality encompasses a much larger region on both sides of the lake, with numerous isolated villages. The region of Lugano is surrounded by the Lugano Prealps, the latter extending on most of the Sottoceneri region, the southernmost part of Ticino and Switzerland. Both western and eastern parts of the municipality share an international border with Italy.

Described as a market town since 984, Lugano was the object of continuous disputes between the sovereigns of Como and Milan until it became part of the Old Swiss Confederation in 1513. In 1803, the political municipality of Lugano was created, following the establishment of the canton. Since 1882, Lugano has been an important stop on the international Gotthard Railway. The rail brought a decisive contribution to the development of tourism and more generally of the tertiary sector which are, to this day, predominant in the economy of the city.

==Name and coat of arms==
The toponym is first recorded in 804 AD, in the form &quot;Luanasco&quot;, in 874 as &quot;Luano&quot;, and from 1189 as &quot;Lugano&quot;. Traditional German-language variants of the name (now virtually unused) are , &quot;Lauis&quot;, &quot;Lauwis&quot;, &quot;Louwerz&quot;.
The local Lombard form of the name is rendered . The etymology of the name is uncertain, suggestions include derivation from Latin (&quot;grove&quot;), from a Vulgar Latin &quot;*lakvannus&quot; (&quot;lake-dweller&quot;) and from the god Lugus. In Romansch, especially in traditional Sursilvan dialect, the city is known as &quot;Ligiaun&quot;.

==History==
===Pre-history===
The shores of Lake Lugano have been inhabited since the Stone Age. Within the modern city limits (Breganzona, Castagnola, Davesco and Gandria) several ground stones or quern-stones have been found. In the area surrounding Lugano, items from the Copper Age and the Iron Age have been found. There are Etruscan monuments at Davesco-Soragno (5th to 2nd century BC), Pregassona (3rd to 2nd century BC), and Viganello (3rd to 2nd century BC). Graves with jewellery and household items have been found in Aldesago, Davesco, Pazzallo and Pregassona along with Celtic money in Viganello.

The region around Lake Lugano was settled by the Romans by the 1st century BC. There was an important Roman town north of Lugano at Bioggio. There are fewer traces of the Romans in Lugano, but several inscriptions, graves and coins indicate that some Romans lived in what would become Lugano.

===Foundation of Lugano===
The first written mention of a settlement at Lugano can be found in documents, which are of disputed authenticity, with which the Longobard king Liutprand ceded various assets located in Lugano to the Church of Saint Carpophorus in Como in 724. Other documents, dating from 804 and 844 refer to Lake Lugano as Laco Luanasco, and an act of 984 indicates Lugano as a market town.

During the fighting between Guelphs and Ghibellines and the new disputes between Como and Milan, during the 14th and 15th centuries, Lugano was the scene of clashes between opposing forces. After a long rule by the Rusca family, Lugano was freed from the domination of Como, which had been taken over in 1335 from the Visconti. At the same time, the link between the town and the valley strengthened. By 1405–06 documents attest to a &quot;vallis comunitas Lugani et&quot;, a governing body that was independent of Como. The new community included the parishes of Lugano, Agno, Riva San Vitale and Capriasca. In 1416 the Duke of Milan, Filippo Maria Visconti, conquered the region of Lugano and the Rusca valley and made it a fief. A year later, Lugano&#x27;s freedoms were first documented in a series of statutes modelled on those of Como. The town was able to secure complete independence.

===Lugano during the Renaissance===

Between 1433 and 1438 the Duke of Milan sat as a feudal lord over Lugano. He compensated the Rusca family with the ownership of Locarno. Under the reign of his heirs in the following decades rebellions and riots broke out, which lasted until the French invasion of 1499.

===Lugano as a dependency of the Old Swiss Confederacy===
Lugano was the object of continuous disputes between the sovereigns of Como and Milan, in particular by the powerful dynasties of the Visconti (rulers of Milan) and the Rusca (rulers of Como), until it became a Swiss dominion in 1513.

An important name in this period was that of the von Beroldingen, a noble family from Uri, whose members between 1576 and 1798 served as chancellors of the &quot;Vogt&quot; residing in Lugano. A key member of this family was (1624-1706), who served as Lugano&#x27;s chancellor and general captain, serving also Spain, and receiving the title of Baron from Leopold I in 1691. He commissioned the construction of Palazzo Beroldingen, on the site of the current , and , in Castagnola.

===Lugano during the Enlightenment===

In 1746, the Agnelli brothers opened the first printing press and bookshop in Lugano. They began publishing the newspaper &quot;Nuove di diverse corti e paesi&quot; in 1748 and changed its name to &quot;Gazzetta di Lugano&quot; in 1797. The newspaper was widely read in north and central Italy. It supported the cause of the later Jansenists against the Jesuits and therefore was banned in 1768 in the territory of the Papal States. It was open to the themes of enlightened reform and the American Revolutionary War. It was the first newspaper in the Italian language to publish an excerpt from the Declaration of Independence of 1776. After the death of Abbot Gian Battista Agnelli in 1788, who had been the editor for more than 40 years, Abbot Giuseppe Lodovico Maria Vanelli took over the paper. Under Abbot Vanelli, it supported the revolutionary ideas from France, which drew protests from the Austrian government in Lombardy. The publication of the magazine ceased abruptly after edition number 17 of 29 April 1799, following the anti-French riots in Lugano during which the Agnelli printing house was sacked and Abbot Vanelli was shot.

Swiss control lasted until 1798 when Napoleon conquered the Old Swiss Confederation and created the Helvetic Republic, within which Lugano became the capital of the Canton of Lugano.

===Canton of Lugano===

The canton of Lugano unified the former Landvogteien of Lugano, Mendrisio, Locarno and Valmaggia. However, as with the other cantons of the Helvetic Republic, the autonomy of Lugano was very limited, the republic having been founded by Napoleon in order further to centralise power in Switzerland. The canton was led by a Directory of five members, who appointed a &quot;national préfet&quot;.

The canton was deeply divided between &quot;patriots&quot; supporting the Cisalpine Republic, and traditionalist &quot;aristocrats&quot;. By 1799 riots broke out in Lugano, and the second préfet, Francesco Capra, fled the town. Power passed to a provisional government sympathetic to the Habsburgs. However, French occupation was restored in 1800. Discontent continued and in early 1802 a revolt in Capriasca led to the autumn &quot;pronunciamento&quot; of Pian Povrò, which declared the independence of Lugano from the Helvetic client republic.

With the Act of Mediation, the following year, political agitation was finally quelled, as were the struggles between unionists and federalists. The canton of Lugano merged with Bellinzona creating the canton of Ticino, which endures to the present day.

===Lugano in the early 19th century===

After 1803, the political municipality of Lugano was created. One of the primary tasks of the new city government was to determine the division of property and authority between the patriziato and the new political municipality. Two agreements between the two organizations, in 1804 and 1810, began this process. In the second half of the 19th century, the political municipality received various properties and rights from the patriziato. Francesco Capra, the préfet during the Helvetic Republic, became the first mayor of Lugano from 1803 until 1813. The cantonal constitution of 1814, set Lugano, Bellinzona and Locarno as capitals of the Canton. They each served as the capital in a six-year rotation. Lugano was the capital in 1827–33, 1845–51 and 1863–69.

In the 19th century, the city government was dominated by the Liberal Party. In 1900, slightly more than half of the seats on the city council (at the time 50 total members, but 60 members since 2004) were held by Liberals. Most of the rest of the seats were held by either Conservatives or Socialists.

The city government initially had eleven members, but in 1908 their number was reduced to five and in 2004 increased to seven. Throughout most of the 20th century, the Liberals held the absolute majority here as well. The rest of the municipal executive posts were held by the Conservatives, the Socialists (1944–48, 1976–80 and since 2000) and the Ticino League (since 1992).

Around 1830 new civic and government buildings began to emerge in Lugano. The town also began to expand into the surrounding hills, along the Cassarate, and toward Molino Nuovo, Paradiso and Castagnola. In 1843–44 the city hall was built on the site of the Bishop&#x27;s Palace (built in 1346). It housed the cantonal government in 1845–51 and again in 1863–69. Since 1890, it has housed the city government. The promenade was built in stages: the first part was in the 1870s, the second in the first decade of the 20th century. In the first decades of the 19th century, the roads that connect Lugano with Bellinzona (1808–12), Ponte Tresa (1808–20) and Chiasso (1810–16) were built. In 1848 the first steamboat on Lake Lugano began to operate, with regular, scheduled service since 1856.

===Modernization of the city===
The construction of the Melide causeway between Melide and Bissone in 1844–47 favoured the development of the Chiasso-Bellinzona-Lugano-Gotthard line at the expense of the north–south route along Lake Maggiore. This tendency for development was strengthened further in 1882 with the completion of the Gotthard railway line. The railway station was built in 1874–77 in Lugano, and transformed it into one of the main links between northern Italy and central and northern Europe, which led to the development of tourism and in general, helped the services sector.

From the mid-19th century to 1970 the city recorded consistent population growth, especially between 1880 and 1910, when the population more than doubled. This increase was partly due to foreign nationals settling in Lugano (in 1870 18.7% of the population, 1910 43.6%) and people from other language areas of Switzerland (1870 1.4% of the population, 1910 6.9%). In the last three decades of the 20th century, the population fell slightly, despite the merger in 1972, of the municipalities of Castagnola and Brè-Aldesago. This reflected a trend to move away from the centre to the suburban communities.

However, in 2004 the municipalities of Breganzona, Cureggia, Davesco-Soragno, Gandria, Pambio-Noranco, Pazzallo, Pregassona and Viganello were incorporated into the municipality and followed by Barbengo, Carabbia and Villa Luganese in 2008. This, among other factors, resulted in a doubling of the population to 52,059 in 2006, of which over a third were foreigners. In 2013 the municipalities of Bogno, Cadro, Carona, Certara, Cimadera, Sonvico and Val Colla were incorporated into the municipality.

===Postwar Lugano===

Following the Second World War, and particularly during the 1960s and 70s, thanks to an abundant flow of capital from nearby Italy, Lugano experienced a period of exponential growth in banking activities which led to it placing itself as the third financial centre of Switzerland, with over 100 banking institutions present in the city. Trade, tourism and finance are the mainstays of the local economy. In 2000, nine-tenths of the workers were employed in the services sector, of which three-quarters were commuters, including many cross-border commuters (13% of the working population).

Lugano was the host city of the 1956 Eurovision Song Contest, the first-ever edition of the contest. In 1975, the Congress Center was built followed in 1978 by the new City Hospital. In 1963 the city acquired the land for the airfield Lugano-Agno, and the first scheduled flights was in 1980. At the beginning of the 21st century they began the Grande Lugano projects, including: the car tunnel Vedeggio-Cassarate, which started in 2005 and connects the A2 motorway with the neighbourhood of Cornaredo, the creation of a new Kulturpol on the site of the former Grand Hôtel Palace and a convention and exhibition centre in the area of Campo Marzio.

===Israeli replication===

In June 2011, officials of the Israeli town of Yehud announced they would undertake a massive construction project to replicate Lugano&#x27;s old square in the centre of their town, to reinvigorate commerce and tourism. The replica will be replete with neoclassical columns and colonnades.

==Geography and climate==

===Topography===

The municipality Lugano lies at the edge of Lake Lugano ( or ), which is situated between the lakes Lago Maggiore and Lago di Como, south of the Alps. It lies at the heart of the Sottoceneri, that part of the canton of Ticino that lies south of the Monte Ceneri Pass.

The city centre is located on the lake shore just to the west of where the river Cassarate enters the lake. The city&#x27;s waterfront forms a crescent around the bay between the Brè () and the San Salvatore () mountains.

Because of the historical development of the city, incorporating some relatively distant suburbs but leaving other, nearer, suburbs as independent municipalities, the borders of the city are disparate. A large and sparsely populated section of the city is on the east bank of Lake Lugano and separated from the city by that lake. Similarly, the inner-urban but independent municipality of Paradiso is a near-enclave, totally surrounded as it is by the municipality and Lake Lugano.

Based on the 1997 land survey, the municipality Lugano has a total area of . Of this area, or 10.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 21.0% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 14.0% is settled (buildings or roads), or 0.1% is either rivers or lakes and or 0.4% is unproductive land.

Of the built-up area, housing and buildings made up 9.4% and transportation infrastructure made up 3.0%. while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 1.2%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 0.5% is used for growing crops and 9.4% is used for alpine pastures. Almost all the water in the municipality is in lakes.

===Climate===

Lugano is amongst the warmest places in Switzerland, along with Locarno and Grono. Lugano has a rare temperate version of a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cfa) for the latitude, closely bordering on a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb) due to the warmer average being 22 °C (71.6 °F). Although the US National Academy of Sciences considers a sea-like climate, the vegetation is from the subtropics with deciduous forest. It is characterized by relatively mild winters and warm humid summers. It has an average of 98.1 days of rain or snow per year and on average receives of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which Lugano receives an average of of rain, while the driest month of the year is February with an average of of precipitation over 4.6 days.

Located on a plain in southern Switzerland and protected by the Alps and lakes, the climate is one of the mildest in the country, typical of the Italian Lakes in the Insubrian region. In addition, the precipitation is ample while the deviations of temperature are moderate. Lugano is also one of the sunniest Swiss cities. The greatest precipitates anticipate and succeed much of the summer. Winter freezing temperatures are more common on the night of January (between 27 and 28 days), but the low temperatures remains are rare and do not occur every year. Much of the summer is pleasant, but warm days above 30 °C (86 °F) are not uncommon (average of about 8 days).

It usually snows every winter, but often a single snowfall doesn&#x27;t leave more than 50cm on the ground. Heavier snowfalls or blizzards are possibile but not very common.

The highest temperature recorded in Lugano is , recorded in July 1945, with the lowest temperature recorded being , recorded in February 1929.

===Coat of arms===
The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is Gules, a cross throughout argent, between the upper case serif letters L, V, G and A (respectively in the I, II, III and IV quarters). The coat of arms dates from around 1200. The four letters on the coat of arms are an abbreviation of the name Lugano.

===Neighborhoods and circles===
The municipality is subdivided into 25 quartieri (neighborhoods) which are grouped into three (cantonal) circles.

Quarters 1–9 are the older quarters of the city, which have been added to by successive enlargements of the municipality in 2004, 2008 and 2013; these enlargements involved previously independent municipalities becoming parts of the municipality.

===Natural sights===
A very popular destination in Lugano is Lake Lugano. The lake is in size, 63% of which is in Switzerland and 37% in Italy. It has an average width of roughly and is nearly at its widest. The maximum depth of the lake is . The water is generally warm with average water temperatures in the summer ranging from to .

Several companies provide tourist boat services on the lake. A popular excursion is by boat to the picturesque lakeside village of Gandria. Additionally, there are numerous shipyards, water taxis and boat rental sites along the lake, as well as hotels and restaurants that offer moorings. Bathing in the lake is allowed at any of the 50 or so bathing establishments located along the Swiss shores.

In addition to the lake, Lugano is surrounded by mountains, which provide a number of opportunities for sports or sightseeing. Two mountains, both providing excellent views over the city and lake, bracket each end of the town&#x27;s waterfront. Monte Brè (), to the north, is reputedly Switzerland&#x27;s sunniest spot and is also home to the old village of Brè. Monte San Salvatore (), to the south, has an old church and museum atop its summit. Both mountains are accessible by funicular railways, which are themselves easily accessible by frequent city bus or by car.

Slightly further afield is Monte Generoso (), with a view that encompasses the lakes of Lugano, Como and Maggiore, as well as the Alps from the Matterhorn to the Bernina Range, the Lombardy Plains, and, on a clear day, the city of Milan. The summit can be reached by taking either an SNL boat, or a railway train, to Capolago, and changing there onto a rack railway train of the Monte Generoso Railway.

There were 1,932 students in the two-year middle school and 47 in their pre-apprenticeship, while 884 students were in the four-year advanced program.

The upper secondary school includes several options, but at the end of the upper secondary program, a student will be prepared to enter a trade or to continue on to a university or college. In Ticino, vocational students may either attend school while working on their internship or apprenticeship (which takes three or four years) or may attend school followed by an internship or apprenticeship (which takes one year as a full-time student or one and a half to two years as a part-time student). There were 492 vocational students who were attending school full-time and 722 who attend part-time.

The professional program lasts three years and prepares a student for a job in engineering, nursing, computer science, business, tourism and similar fields. There were 89 students in the professional program. , there were 3,537 students in Lugano who came from another municipality, while 887 residents attended schools outside the municipality.

The main building, built in 1909, was originally the hospital of Lugano and since 1996 it is home of the university. In the next years, several added buildings enriched the headquarter until the other side of the river, in the quarter called Viganello. In fact, the area of the older buildings on the west side of the river is called &quot;West Campus&quot; (or &quot;Campus Ovest&quot; in italian), whereas the newest building (active since 2021) on the other side of the river is called &quot;East Campus&quot; (or &quot;Campus Est&quot; in italian) and it houses both the university USI and the University of Applied Sciences of Southern Switzerland SUPSI.

==Transport==


===Air===
Lugano is served by Lugano Airport, in the nearby municipality of Agno. Currently, only Silver Air operates to Lugano Airport. While there is limited service to Lugano&#x27;s airport, Milan&#x27;s airports are not that far away and provide access to a greater number of worldwide locations. Milan Malpensa Airport is connected to Lugano by a direct hourly train with a travel time of 1:45h from/to Lugano, or about one hour, 80 km by road.

===Railways===
Lugano&#x27;s railway station is situated on the historically and concurrently important Gotthard railway line, which links northern Switzerland with Ticino and Italy. Since the inauguration of the Gotthard Base Tunnel, in 2016, and the Ceneri Base Tunnel, in 2020, train connections with cities in Northern Switzerland, such as Zürich, Luzern and Basel, have been improved, with significantly faster services through the base tunnels.

Long-distance trains of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS), together with international trains of Trenitalia, connect Lugano with the cities of northern Switzerland and with Italy. The trains operate under the InterCity and EuroCity brands. Service is provided hourly to Zürich and once every two hours to Basel and Milan. One train per day operates to each of Bologna, Genoa and Venice. All the above trains operate via the Gotthard and Ceneri base tunnels. Between April and mid October, the tourist oriented Gotthard Panorama Express connects Lugano with Lucerne once a day by train and boat, travelling by train over the historic high-level Gotthard route, and then by boat along the length of Lake Lucerne.

Lugano is also served by several lines of regional trains of the Treni Regionali Ticino Lombardia (TILO) network which operates in the canton of Ticino and the north of the Italian region of Lombardy. Line RE80 provides a half-hourly semi-fast service northbound to Locarno and southbound to Mendrisio and Chiasso, with alternate southbound trains continuing to Milan. Line S10 provides a half-hourly all-stations service northbound to Bellinzona and Biasca and southbound to Mendrisio and Chiasso, with alternate southbound trains continuing to Como and occasional northbound trains continuing to Airolo. Line S50 provides an hourly service to Milan Malpensa Airport, running coupled to an S10 service between Biasca and Mendrisio. All the above trains use the Ceneri Base Tunnel, but line S90 provides a half-hourly service north to Giubiasco and an hourly service south to Mendrisio serving all the stations over the old high-level Ceneri route.

Additionally, the metre gauge ( gauge) Lugano-Ponte Tresa Railway (FLP) provides a quarter-hourly service to Agno, Lugano Airport and Ponte Tresa. The service operates as line S60 from its own station adjacent to the main railway station.

Lugano is also served by three funicular railways. The Funicolare Città–Stazione, which has recently been renewed, is a short line connecting Lugano railway station to the lower part of the city centre by the lake, whilst the Funicolare Monte Brè and the Funicolare Monte San Salvatore ascend nearby hills to vantage points. A fourth funicular, the Funicolare degli Angioli, still exists but has not operated since 1986.

===Road===
Lugano is located along the A2 motorway, a part of the European route E35 that stretches over between Amsterdam and Rome. Like the original railway, the A2 to the north crosses the Ceneri and Gotthard passes and links Lugano to northern Switzerland and, via Basel, to the German motorway network. To the south it crosses the Swiss-Italian border at Chiasso, linking to the Italian motorway network. The motorway runs to the west and south of the city, using extensive tunnelling to deal with the mountainous landscape.

The Trasporti Pubblici Luganesi (TPL) operate frequent inner city buses throughout Lugano and some of its closer neighbours. The Autolinee Regionali Luganesi (ARL) runs buses connecting Lugano with the districts of Davesco, Sonvico and the towns of Canobbio, Lamone and Tesserete, whilst the Società Navigazione del Lago di Lugano (SNL) runs buses to the lakeside districts of Gandria and Campione d&#x27;Italia, complementing its boat services to the same locations. TPL, ARL and SNL services operate from the &quot;Lugano Centro&quot; bus station.

Longer distance buses, as well as some local buses, are operated by PostBus Switzerland, known locally as the &quot;AutoPostale&quot;. Its &quot;Palm Express&quot; service connects Lugano railway station to St. Moritz. Other &quot;AutoPostale&quot; buses operate from an underground bus station and ticket office, located at Via Balestra 4 in the centre of Lugano. ASF Autolinee, an Italian bus company, operates an international bus route from Lugano to Menaggio, on the shores of Lake Como.

===Shipping===
Boats of the Società Navigazione del Lago di Lugano (SNL) provide services on Lake Lugano. Whilst these are principally provided for tourist purposes, they also connect Lugano with other lakeside communities. Several of the landing points are within the sparsely populated section of the municipality that lies on the east side of the lake and have no road access.

==Culture==

Lugano hosts the Swiss National Sound Archives, responsible for safeguarding the sound heritage of Switzerland.

The Palazzo dei Congressi is the performing arts centre for Lugano. It is the main venue for the Orchestra della Svizzera Italiana.

The Lugano Festival runs during April and May, followed by the related &quot;Progetto Martha Argerich&quot; in June. Estival Jazz arrives in July. Between July and August, there is the LongLake Festival, one of the greatest urban open-air happenings in Switzerland. During one month, the LongLake offers over 300 events in downtown Lugano.

The Blues-to-Bop Festival arrives in late August and early September turns the town into a hive of activity as thousands crowd the streets and piazzas for free open-air concerts.

In 1956, the Teatro Kursaal in Lugano hosted the first Eurovision Song Contest.

The MASI (Museo d&#x27;Arte della Svizzera italiana) has two parallel objectives: the conservation and study of the Museum&#x27;s permanent collection, which is above all made up of works belonging to the 19th and 20th centuries; and the planning and presentation of temporary exhibitions. It focuses on the art of the cantons of Ticino and Graubünden (Grigioni in Italian) and presents artists from the region on a regular basis. Lugano Arte e Cultura (LAC) is a cultural centre dedicated to music, visual and performance arts. It opened in 2015.

The district of Brè-Aldesago offers its visitors charming corners created by its characteristic stone buildings. The cobblestone streets of the town offer art enthusiasts an artistic path that is very interesting both because of the presence of national and international &quot;names&quot; and the combination of art and the environment.

==Sports==

Hockey Club Lugano (HCL) plays in the National League (NL), the top tier of Swiss hockey and is by far the town&#x27;s number one team. They play at the Cornèr Arena and have won seven national titles, having participated twice in the European Cup final round and once in the top four final in the Euroleague. In 1991, Lugano reached the final of the Spengler Cup and twice reached third place in the IIHF Continental Cup Superfinal.

FC Lugano plays in the Swiss Super League. They play at the Stadio Cornaredo and won the Swiss title in 1938, 1941 and 1949 and the Swiss Cup in 1931, 1968 and 1993. 
The Stadio Cornaredo currently sits 4,800 people. It hosted the Italy-Belgium match at the 1954 FIFA World Cup. According to some sources, Lugano is the smallest city ever to hold a World Cup match. Around the soccer field there is a gravel lane used during athletic contests and that, outside of official match and training hours, can be used by joggers free of charge. Next to the stadium are three small training fields. There are also two artificial grass fields: one for field hockey and one for soccer. There is also a skate park next to the stadium.

BC Lugano Tigers (former Basket Club Lugano) plays in the Swiss National League A (LNA). They play at the Elvetico gym, won the Swiss Cup in 2011 and have been Swiss LNA Champions in 2000, 2001, 2006 and 2010.

Lugano annually hosts the racewalk Gran Premio Città di Lugano Memorial Albisetti and the Ladies Open Lugano, an International level WTA tennis tournament. The city hosted the 1953 and 1996 UCI Road World Championships, as well as the 18th Chess Olympiad.

Lugano has traditionally been one of Switzerland&#x27;s hubs in Water polo. The Società Nuoto Lugano won the Swiss Championship a total of 17 times.

<text>Fatema Mernissi (; 27 September 1940 – 30 November 2015) was a Moroccan feminist writer and sociologist.

==Biography==
Fatema Mernissi was born on 27 September 1940 in Fez, Morocco. She grew up in the harem of her affluent paternal grandmother along with various female kin and servants. She received her primary education in a school established by the nationalist movement, and secondary level education in an all-girls school funded by the French protectorate. In 1957, she studied political science at the Sorbonne in Paris and later at Brandeis University in the US, where she gained her doctorate in 1974.

She returned to work at the Mohammed V University in Rabat and taught at the Faculté des Lettres between 1974 and 1981 on subjects such as methodology, family sociology and psychosociology. Further, she was a research scholar at the University Institute for Scientific Research at the same university.

Mernissi&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Veil: Male-Female Dynamics in Muslim Society&quot; was written for her PhD thesis and later published as a book which recognizes the power of Muslim women in relation to the Islamic faith. Mernissi is known for her sociopolitical approaches towards discussing gender and sexual identities, specifically those in Morocco and other Muslim countries. She is regarded as an influential feminist figure, as she was a renowned public speaker, scholar, teacher, writer, and sociologist. Mernissi died in Rabat on 30 November 2015.

== Publications and their influence ==
Mernissi&#x27;s first monograph, &quot;Beyond the Veil&quot;, was published in 1975. A revised edition was published in Britain in 1985 and in the US in 1987. &quot;Beyond the Veil&quot; has become a classic, especially in the fields of anthropology and sociology, on women in the Arab World, the Mediterranean area or Muslim societies in general.

As an Islamic feminist, Mernissi was largely concerned with Islam and women&#x27;s roles, analyzing the historical development of Islamic thought and its modern manifestations. Through a detailed investigation of the nature of the succession to Muhammad, she cast doubt on the validity of some of the &quot;hadith&quot; (sayings and traditions attributed to him), and therefore the subordination of women that she sees in Islam, but not necessarily in the Qur&#x27;an.

In 1984, she contributed the text &quot;The merchant&#x27;s daughter and the son of the sultan&quot; to the anthology &quot;Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women&#x27;s Movement Anthology&quot;, edited by Robin Morgan. Her most famous book as an Islamic feminist, &quot;The Veil and the Male Elite: A Feminist Interpretation of Islam&quot;, is a quasi-historical study of the role of the wives of Muhammad. It was first published in French in 1987 and translated into English in 1991. The book was subsequently banned in Morocco, Iran, and the Arab states of the Persian Gulf.

As a sociologist, Mernissi mainly undertook field work in Morocco. On several occasions in the late 1970s and early 1980s, she conducted interviews in order to map prevailing attitudes to women and their work. She did sociological research for UNESCO and ILO as well as for the Moroccan government. In the same period, Mernissi contributed articles to periodicals and other publications on women in Morocco and women and Islam from a contemporary as well as from a historical perspective.

Her work has been cited as an inspiration by other Muslim feminists, such as those who founded Musawah and others. For &quot;Doing Daily Battle: Interviews with Moroccan Women&quot; (1991), she interviewed peasant women, women labourers, clairvoyants and maidservants. In 1994, Mernissi published a fictional memoir, &quot;Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood&quot; (in the US, the book was originally titled &quot;The Harem Within: Tales of a Moroccan Girlhood&quot;, and is still known by that title in the UK).

A recurring topic in her writings is the fictional character Scheherazade of &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;. Her article, &quot;The Satellite, the Prince, and Scheherazade: The Rise of Women as Communicators in Digital Islam&quot; explores cases in which women take part in online media, while &quot;Digital Scheherazades in the Arab World&quot; covers the topics of online activities shifting cultural ways. In these essays, she mentions how technology is quickly spreading – one of the main sources being the World Wide Web – and analyses the roles and contributions of women in this movement.

She wrote extensively about life within harems, gender, and public and private spheres. &quot;Size 6: The Western Women’s Harem,&quot; is an essay from her book, &quot;Scheherazade Goes West: Different Cultures, Different Harems&quot; that discusses the repression and pressures women in different societies face merely based on their physical appearance. Whether she analyzes women in Moroccan society or in the West, she claims that they must live up to stereotypical, culturally imposed standards, such as dress sizes. Mernissi compares the clothing size 6 to harems and states that these Western practices isolate and mistreat women.

===Ethnocentrism: &quot;Beyond the Veil&quot; ===
In 1975, Fatima Mernissi&#x27;s first book, &quot;Beyond the Veil&quot;, was published, and it was considered revolutionary. Mernissi broke down the ethnocentric stereotypes Western society had developed towards Islam, especially Muslim women. She distinguished Muslim women from the homogenized group of ‘third-world women’ that Western feminism had created. Mernissi also fought to overcome Western assumptions that Muslim women were helpless victims of both their religion and the men of their religion. Western stereotypes ostracized Muslim men who did not fit the white, masculine, hegemonic mold dominating the first world society, developing racist ideas towards a religion that was believed to oppress women.

However, Mernissi pointed out that Muslim women were not victims of their religious practices any more than Western women were victims of the patriarchy; both groups of women were oppressed by specific social institutions within a religion or society created to profit from the marginalization of others. Furthermore, Mernissi explained that Western women were veiled, just as Muslim women were, yet Western veils were much more discreet. She argued that youth and beauty veiled Western women, and once a woman no longer had these, she was hardly recognized by society.

Mernissi broke down the ethnocentric approach Western Feminism had been utilizing and wrote to bring more clarity to the diversity necessary within the global Feminine movement. Mernissi&#x27;s legacy is revolutionary because she created a space within an initially predominantly Western movement that allowed Muslim women to participate without compromising their religious practices. Mernissi&#x27;s work highlighted how Western feminism could be detrimental to the empowerment of women around the globe if it lacked an intersectional approach to women&#x27;s issues.

===Intersectionality: &quot;The Forgotten Queens of Islam&quot; ===
In the book &quot;The Forgotten Queens of Islam&quot;, Fatima Mernissi uses an intersectional approach to understand the positions of women throughout early Islamic history through social and political identities that created modes of discrimination. Her aim was to bring to light the significant contributions that women had made throughout early Islamic history and debunk the misconceptions about the absence of women as political and authoritative figures. She does this by exploring the leadership roles that women were involved in throughout Islamic history and alters the way women are portrayed in historiographies. She claims that women held powerful political positions despite religious titles that were given to men. This is exemplified through the many historical accounts that she provides about fifteen women and the active roles that they played in pre-modern Islam politics.

For instance, the role that female slaves played in leading slave revolts against religious rulers without the use of violence (Mernissi, 1994). Moreover, Mernissi distinguishes between “Political Islam,” the period where radical change occurred and women&#x27;s roles were disregarded or forgotten, and “Rislala Islam,” where women&#x27;s lives were transformed (Mernissi, 1994). She was fundamental in contributing to the overall academic literature on women&#x27;s visibility in Islamic history outside of their traditional roles by highlighting their involvement in politics, religion, and cultural change.

===Gender Roles: &quot;Women’s Rebellion &amp; Islamic Memory&quot; ===
In the book &quot;Women&#x27;s Rebellion &amp; Islamic Memory&quot;, Fatima Mernissi analyzes the role of women in relation to the world of contemporary Islam. In her work, she explores the idea of sexual identity and gender roles in the Islamic world and helps to redefine the narrative surrounding it. Mernissi discusses some of the most prominent issues to do with the status of Muslim women, such as the masking of women&#x27;s contribution to the economies of Arab states (Mernissi, 1996). Furthermore, Mernissi delves into different demographic, including education and literacy. She uses this to help explain the importance of these factors not only for the empowerment of women in Islam, but also for their health (Mernissi, 1996).

Furthermore, Mernissi analyzes the role of the state in gender roles as well as the outcome of a state that ultimately supports inequality. She ultimately argues that the freedom from these controlling traditions and expectations of women is the only way for the Arab world to develop. Mernissi&#x27;s work is extremely influential in Islamic feminism, intersectionality, and global feminism, by focusing on issues surrounding Muslim women in the Arab world. This book, in particular, was able to bring light to specific issues that women deal with in the Islamic world, such as issues of sexual identity and gender roles, and the effects these can have on women&#x27;s empowerment and health.

=== &quot;Islam and Democracy: Fear of the Modern World&quot; ===
In her book, &quot;Islam and Democracy: Fear of the Modern World&quot;, Fatima Mernissi employs a transnational approach to analyse the socio-political context of the Arab-Islamic world shortly after the Gulf war. She debates whether the established fundamentalism dominating the Middle East could ever be compatible with the democratic processes used in Western societies. Mernissi raises questions around the uncertainty Muslims feel towards a form of government that is “unislamic” and may compromise their Islamic way of life, including morals and values, such as modesty. Moreover, she explores issues such as the fear of the Islamic religion, democracy, the United Nations Charter, freedom of thought and individualism (Mernissi, 2002).

For instance, she looked at how fundamentalism controlled what a woman would be able to wear, so a democratic society that freed women to dress as they pleased could appear threatening to a hyper-masculine culture. She contests that a living democracy should allow for the legal and constitutional ability to disagree with the state. Mernissi then suggests ways in which progressive Muslims, including feminists, who choose to advocate for democracy and resist fundamentalism should draw from the same sacred texts as those who seek to oppress them, in order to prove that Islam is not fundamentally against women.

== Awards and legacy ==
Mernissi&#x27;s works focus on providing a voice for oppressed and marginalized women. She brings to light the contributions of women to the economy and acknowledges the roles that affect how females are viewed within Islamic cultures. Throughout her career, Mernissi was an avid spokesperson regarding women&#x27;s rights and equality, while also embracing the Islamic faith. She uses historical religious research to make claims for her modern feminist stances.

In 2003, Mernissi was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award, along with Susan Sontag. Mernissi&#x27;s acceptance speech, &quot;The Cowboy or Sinbad?&quot;, covered the topic of globalization, and was recognized for her pensive take, considering both the issue and effects of culture. In 2004, she was awarded the Erasmus Prize, alongside Sadik Al-Asm and Abdolkarim Soroush. For this award, she was recognized for her sociocultural impact, since it was dedicated to &quot;Religion and Modernity&quot;. In 2017, The Middle East Studies Association created the Fatema Mernissi Book Award to &quot;recognize outstanding scholarship in studies of gender, sexuality, and women’s lived experience&quot;.

Mernissi&#x27;s legacy can be greatly attributed to her scholarly and literary contributions to the early Islamic feminist movement. Mernissi tackled issues such as Eurocentrism, intersectionality, transnationalism and global feminism in her publications and public lectures. The New York Times quoted her in an obituary: &quot;Not only have the sacred texts always been manipulated, but manipulation of them is a structural characteristic of the practice of power in Muslim societies,” Fatema Mernissi, &quot;The Veil and the Male Elite: A Feminist Interpretation of Women’s Rights in Islam&quot; (1991)

<doc id="295872" wikidata="Q2027065" url="?curid=295872" title="Pitch control">
<text>A variable speed pitch control (or vari-speed) is a control on an audio device such as a turntable, tape recorder, or CD player that allows the operator to deviate from a standard speed (such as 33, 45 or even 78 rpm on a turntable), resulting in adjustments in pitch. The latter term &quot;vari-speed&quot; is more commonly used for tape decks, particularly in the UK. Analog pitch controls vary the voltage being used by the playback device; digital controls use digital signal processing to change the playback speed or pitch. A typical DJ deck allows the pitch to be increased or reduced by up to 8%, which is achieved by increasing or reducing the speed at which the platter rotates. 

Turntable or CD playing speed may be changed for beatmatching and other DJ techniques, while pitch shift using a pitch control has myriad uses in sound recording.

== Vari-speed in consumer cassette decks ==

Superscope, Inc. of Sun Valley added vari-speed as a feature of portable cassette decks in 1975. The C-104 and C-105 models incorporated this feature.

Superscope trademarked the name Vari-Speed in 1974. The trademark category was Computer &amp; Software Products &amp; Electrical &amp; Scientific Products. The trademark goods and Services use was Magnetic tape recorders and reproducers. The trademark expired in 1995.

== DJ pitch usage ==

For DJs the possibility to alter the pitch on their turntables or CD players is standard. On the Technics SL-1200 turntables there both has been the possibility of changing the pitch +/− 8% and models where you could change the pitch +/− 16%. This has become the standard amongst DJs and most software that emulates a DJ setup have their pitch control often standard at +/− 8%. With the possibility to change it to +/− 16% and some other values. By changing the pitch the DJ can alter the BPM of a record within this limited range. This is a key component for beatmatching, enabling the DJ to get two records to play at the same BPM thereby synchronising the beat for the dancers.

== Reset button ==
On Technics SL-1200 turntables, pressing the Reset button returns the pitch to a fixed preset value of +/−0% regardless of the pitch control position.

<doc id="295888" wikidata="Q5867480" url="?curid=295888" title="History of calendars">
<text>The history of calendars covers practices with ancient roots as people created and used various methods to keep track of days and larger divisions of time. Calendars commonly serve both cultural and practical purposes and are often connected to astronomy and agriculture.

Archeologists have reconstructed methods of timekeeping that go back to prehistoric times at least as old as the Neolithic. The natural units for timekeeping used by most historical societies are the day, the solar year and the lunation. Calendars are explicit schemes used for timekeeping. The first historically attested and formulized calendars date to the Bronze Age, dependent on the development of writing in the ancient Near East. In Victoria, Australia, a Wurdi Youang stone arrangement undergoing research could date back more than 11,000 years. In 2013, archaeologists unearthed ancient evidence of a 10,000-year-old calendar system in Warren Field, Aberdeenshire. This calendar is the next earliest, or &quot;the first Scottish calendar&quot;. The Sumerian calendar was the next earliest, followed by the Egyptian, Assyrian and Elamite calendars.

The Vikram Samvat has been used by Hindus and Sikhs. One of several regional Hindu calendars in use on the Indian subcontinent, it is based on twelve synodic lunar months and 365 solar days. The lunar year begins with the new moon of the month of Chaitra. This day, known as Chaitra Sukhladi, is a restricted (optional) holiday in India.
A number of ancient and medieval inscriptions used the Vikram Samvat. Although it was purportedly named after the legendary king Vikramaditya Samvatsara (‘Samvat’ in short), ‘Samvat’ is a Sanskrit term for ‘year’. Emperor Vikramaditya of Ujjain started Vikram Samvat in 57 BC and it is believed that this calendar follows his victory over the Saka in 56 B.C.

A larger number of calendar systems of the ancient East appear in the Iron Age archaeological record, based on the Assyrian and Babylonian calendars. This includes the calendar of the Persian Empire, which in turn gave rise to the Zoroastrian calendar as well as the Hebrew calendar.

Calendars in antiquity were usually lunisolar, depending on the introduction of intercalary months to align the solar and the lunar years. This was mostly based on observation, but there may have been early attempts to model the pattern of intercalation algorithmically, as evidenced in the fragmentary 2nd-century Coligny calendar. Nevertheless, the Roman calendar contained very ancient remnants of a pre-Etruscan 10-month solar year.

The Roman calendar was reformed by Julius Caesar in 45 BC. The Julian calendar was no longer dependent on the observation of the new moon but simply followed an algorithm of introducing a leap day every four years. This created a dissociation of the calendar month from the lunation.

Sub-Saharan African calendars can vary in days and weeks depending on the kingdom or tribe that created it. 

In the 11th century in Persia, a calendar reform led by Khayyam was announced in 1079, when the length of the year was measured as 365.24219858156 days. Given that the length of the year is changing in the sixth decimal place over a person&#x27;s lifetime, this is outstandingly accurate. For comparison the length of the year at the end of the 19th century was 365.242196 days, while at the end of the 20th century it was 365.242190 days.

The Gregorian calendar was introduced as a refinement of the Julian calendar in 1582, and is today in worldwide use as the &quot;de facto&quot; calendar for secular purposes.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;calendars&quot; itself is taken from the &quot;calends&quot;, the term for the first day of the month in the Roman calendar, related to the verb &quot;to call out&quot;, referring to the calling or the announcement that the new moon was just seen. Latin meant &quot;account book, register&quot;, as accounts were settled and debts were collected on the calends of each month.

The Latin term was adopted in Old French as and from there into Middle English as by the 13th century. The spelling &quot;calendar&quot; is from Early Modern English.

==Prehistory==

Many Upper Paleolithic cave paintings of animals from across western and central Europe are accompanied by sequences of dots and lines. It has been hypothesized that these are tally marks representing lunar months, with the year beginning at the end of winter. A branching &quot;Y&quot; symbol represents mating or birthing month for the associated animal, making each sequence a phenological calendar.

A number of prehistoric structures have been proposed as having had the purpose of timekeeping (typically keeping track of the course of the solar year). This includes many megalithic structures, and reconstructed arrangements going back far into the Neolithic period.

In Victoria, Australia, a Wurdi Youang stone arrangement could date back more than 11,000 years. This estimate is based on the inaccuracy of the calendar, which is consistent with how the Earth&#x27;s supposed orbit is thought to have changed during that time. The site is found near the world&#x27;s oldest known site of permanent aquaculture.

A mesolithic arrangement of twelve pits and an arc found in Warren Field, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, dated to roughly 8,000 BC, has been described as a lunar calendar and was dubbed the &quot;world&#x27;s oldest known calendar&quot; in 2013.

==Antiquity==

===Ancient Sumerian===

The ancient Sumerian calendar, roughly dated to 2100 BC, divided a year into 12 lunar months of 29 or 30 days. Each month began with the sighting of a new moon. Sumerian months had no uniform name throughout Sumer because of the religious diversity. This resulted in scribes and scholars referring to them as &quot;the first month&quot;, &quot;the fifth month&quot;, etc. To keep the lunar year of 354 days in step with the solar year of 365.242 days an extra month was added periodically, much like a Gregorian leap year. There were no weeks in the Sumerian calendar. Holy days and time off from work were usually celebrated on the first, seventh and fifteenth of each month. In addition to these holy days, there were also feast days which varied from city to city.

===Babylonia and Persia===
Although the earliest evidence of Iranian calendrical traditions is from the second millennium BC, predating the appearance of the Iranian prophet Zoroaster, the first fully preserved calendar is that of the Achaemenids. Throughout recorded history, Persians have been keen on the idea and importance of having a calendar. They were among the first cultures to use a solar calendar and have long favoured a solar over lunar and lunisolar approaches. The sun has always been a symbol in Iranian culture and is closely related to the folklore regarding Cyrus the Great.

==== Old Persian calendar ====
Old Persian inscriptions and tablets indicate that early Iranians used a 360-day calendar based on the solar observation directly and modified for their beliefs. Days were not named. The months had two or three divisions depending on the phase of the moon. Twelve months of 30 days were named for festivals or activities of the pastoral year. A 13th month was added every six years to keep the calendar synchronized with the seasons.

==== Zoroastrian calendar ====

The first calendars based on Zoroastrian cosmology appeared in the later Achaemenid period (650 to 330 BC). They evolved over the centuries, but month names changed little until now.

The unified Achaemenid Empire required a distinctive Iranian calendar, and one was devised in Egyptian tradition, with 12 months of 30 days, each dedicated to a yazata (Eyzad), and four divisions resembling the Semitic week. Four days per month were dedicated to Ahura Mazda and seven were named after the six Amesha Spentas. Thirteen days were named after Fire, Water, Sun, Moon, Tiri and Geush Urvan (the soul of all animals), Mithra, Sraosha (Soroush, yazata of prayer), Rashnu (the Judge), Fravashi, Bahram (yazata of victory), Raman (Ramesh meaning peace), and Vata, the divinity of the wind. Three were dedicated to the female divinities, Daena (yazata of religion and personified conscious), Ashi (yazata of fortune) and Arshtat (justice). The remaining four were dedicated to Asman (lord of sky or Heaven), Zam (earth), Manthra Spenta (the Bounteous Sacred Word) and Anaghra Raocha (the &#x27;Endless Light&#x27; of paradise).

==== Modifications by Parthians, Ardashir I, Hormizd I, Yazdgerd III ====
The Parthians (Arsacid dynasty) adopted the same calendar system with minor modifications, and dated their era from 248 BC, the date they succeeded the Seleucids. Their names for the months and days are Parthian equivalents of the Avestan ones used previously, differing slightly from the Middle Persian names used by the Sassanians. For example, in Achaemenid times the modern Persian month &#x27;Day&#x27; was called &quot;Dadvah&quot; (Creator), in Parthian it was &quot;Datush&quot;, and the Sassanians named it &quot;Dadv/Dai&quot; (&quot;Dadar&quot; in Pahlavi).

When in April of AD 224 the Parthian dynasty fell and was replaced by the Sasanid, the new king, Ardashir I, abolished the official Babylonian calendar and replaced it with the Zoroastrian. This involved a correction to the places of the &quot;gahanbar&quot;, which had slipped back in the seasons since they were fixed. These were placed eight months later, as were the &quot;epagemonai&quot;, the &#x27;Gatha&#x27; or &#x27;Gah&#x27; days after the ancient Zoroastrian hymns of the same name. Other countries, such as the Armenians and Choresmians, did not accept the change.

==== The formation of the current Persian calendar in the 11th century ====

Toghril Beg, the founder of the Seljuq dynasty, had made Esfahan the capital of his domains and his grandson Malik-Shah was the ruler of that city from 1073. An invitation was sent to Khayyam from Malik-Shah and from his vizier Nizam al-Mulk asking Khayyam to go to Esfahan to set up an Observatory there. Other leading astronomers were also brought to the Observatory in Esfahan and for 18 years Khayyam led the scientists and produced work of outstanding quality. During this time Khayyam led work on compiling astronomical tables and he also contributed to calendar reform in 1079.

Cowell quotes the &quot;Calcutta Review&quot; No 59:
Khayyam measured the length of the year as 365.24219858156 days. Two comments on this result. Firstly it shows an incredible confidence to attempt to give the result to this degree of accuracy. We know now that the length of the year is changing in the sixth decimal place over a person&#x27;s lifetime. Secondly it is outstandingly accurate. For comparison the length of the year at the end of the 19th century was 365.242196 days, while today it is 365.242190 days.

===Classical Greece===

The Greeks, as early as the time of Homer, appear to have been familiar with the division of the year into the twelve lunar months but no intercalary month &quot;Embolimos&quot; or day is then mentioned. Independent of the division of a month into days, it was divided into periods according to the increase and decrease of the moon. Thus, the first day or new moon was called &quot;Noumenia&quot;. The month in which the year began, as well as the names of the months, differed among the states, and in some parts even no names existed for the months, as they were distinguished only numerically, as the first, second, third, fourth month, etc.

The ancient Athenian calendar was a lunisolar calendar with 354-day years, consisting of twelve months of alternating length of 29 or 30 days. To keep the calendar in line with the solar year of 365.242189 days, an extra, intercalary month was added in the years: 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, 19 of the 19-years Metonic cycle. See About the structure of the Attic Calendar The Athenian months were called Hekatombion, Metageitnion, Boedromion, Pyanepsion, Maimakterion, Poseidon, Gamelion, Anthesterion, Elaphebolion, Munychion, Thargelion, and Skirophorion. The intercalary month usually came after Poseidon, and was called second Poseidon. See also: Athenian Calendar. A reconstruction of the Attic Calendar is given by Academy of Episteme.

In addition to their regular, &quot;festival&quot; calendar, the Athenians maintained a second, political calendar . This &quot;conciliar&quot; calendar divided the year into &quot;prytanies&quot;, one for each of the &quot;phylai&quot;, the subdivisions of Athenian citizens. The number of phylai, and hence the number of prytanies, varied over time. Until 307 BC, there were 10 phylai. After that the number varies between 11 and 13 (usually 12). Even more confusing, while the conciliar and festival years were about the same length in the 4th century BC, such was not regularly the case earlier or later. Documents dated by prytany are frequently very difficult to assign to a particular equivalent in the Julian calendar.

The table of Greek Olympiads, following the four-year cycles between the Olympic Games from 1 July 776 BC, continued until the end of the 4th century AD. The Babylonian Era of Nabonassar, beginning on 26 February 747 BC, was used by the Greeks of Alexandria. It was later known in the Middle Ages from the works of Ptolemy.

===Hellenistic period===
The Greek calendars were greatly diversified by the Hellenistic period, with separate traditions in every Greek state. Of primary importance for the reconstruction of the regional Greek calendars is the calendar of Delphi, because of the numerous documents found there recording the manumission of slaves, many of which are dated both in the Delphian and in a regional calendar.

The Roman Republican calendar numbered years based on the sitting consuls. References to the year of consulship were used in both conversation and official records. Romans from the same family often had the same &quot;praenomen&quot;, which sometimes makes it difficult to distinguish them, and there were two consuls at any one time, each of whom might sometimes hold the appointment more than once, meaning that it was (and is) necessary to be well educated in history to understand the references. The Romans had an eight-day week, with the market-day falling every eight days. It was called a &quot;nundinum&quot; or &#x27;nine-day&#x27; in inclusive counting.

Most of the regional Hindu calendars are inherited from a system standardized in classical Hindu astronomy as adopted via Indo-Greek transmission in the final centuries BC, and reformed by Gupta era astronomers such as Aryabhata and Varāhamihira.

===China===
Before the Spring and Autumn period (before 770 BC), the Chinese calendars were solar calendars. In the so-called five-phase calendar, the year consists of 10 months and a transition, each month being 36 days long, and the transitions 5 or 6 days. During the Warring States period (~475–220 BC), the primitive lunisolar calendars were established under the Zhou Dynasty, known as the six ancient calendars (). The months of these calendars begin on the day with the new moon, with 12 or 13 months (lunations) in a year. The intercalary month is placed at the end of the year. In Qin China, the Qin calendar () was introduced. It follows the rules of Zhuanxu&#x27;s calendar, but the months order follows the Xia&#x27;s calendar.

===Vedic and Pre-Vedic Era /Ancient India ===
Timekeeping was important to Vedic rituals, and &quot;Jyotisha&quot; was the Vedic-era field of tracking and predicting the movements of astronomical bodies in order to keep time, in order to fix the day and time of these rituals, which were developed around the end of 2nd millennium BC as mentioned in &quot;Sathapatha Brahmana&quot;. This study was one of the six ancient &quot;Vedangas&quot;, or ancillary science connected with the Vedas – the scriptures of Hinduism, which was quoted by 5th-century BC scholar Yaska. The ancient extant text on Jyotisha is the &quot;Vedanga-Jyotisha&quot;, which exists in two editions, one linked to Rigveda and other to Yajurveda. The Rigveda version is variously attributed to sage Lagadha, and sometimes to sage Shuci. The Yajurveda version credits no particular sage, has survived into the modern era with a commentary of Somakara, and is the more studied version.

The Jyotisha text &quot;Brahma-siddhanta&quot;, probably composed in the 5th century AD, discusses how to use the movement of planets, sun and moon to keep time and calendar. This text also lists trigonometry and mathematical formulae to support its theory of orbital, predict planetary positions and calculate relative mean positions of celestial nodes and apsides. The text is notable for presenting very large integers, such as 4.32 billion years as the lifetime of the current universe.

Water clock and sun dials are mentioned in many ancient Hindu texts such as the Arthashastra. The Jyotisha texts present mathematical formulae to predict the length of day time, sun rise and moon cycles.

The modern Hindu calendar, sometimes referred to as &quot;Panchanga&quot;, is a collective term for the various lunisolar calendars traditionally used in Hinduism. They adopt a similar underlying concept for timekeeping, but differ in their relative emphasis on the moon cycle or the sun cycle, the names of months and when they consider the New Year to start. The ancient Hindu calendar is similar in conceptual design to the Jewish calendar, but different from the Gregorian calendar. Unlike the Gregorian calendar which adds additional days to the lunar month to adjust for the mismatch between twelve lunar cycles (354 lunar days) and nearly 365 solar days, the Hindu calendar maintains the integrity of the lunar month, but inserts an extra full month according to complex rules, every few years, to ensure that the festivals and crop related rituals fall in the appropriate season.

The Hindu calendars have been in use in the Indian subcontinent since ancient times, and remain in use by the Hindus in India and Nepal, particularly to set Hindu festival dates. Early Buddhist and Jain communities of India adopted the ancient Hindu calendar, later Vikrami calendar and then local Buddhist calendars. Buddhist and Jain festivals continue to be scheduled according to a lunar system in the luni-solar calendar.

===Roman Empire===

The old Roman year had 304 days divided into 10 months, beginning with March. However the ancient historian Livy gave credit to the second early Roman king Numa Pompilius for devising a calendar of 12 months. The extra months &quot;Ianuarius&quot; and &quot;Februarius&quot; had been invented, supposedly by Numa Pompilius, as stop-gaps. Julius Caesar realized that the system had become inoperable, so he effected drastic changes in the year of his third consulship. The New Year in 709 AUC began on 1 January and ran over 365 days until 31 December. Further adjustments were made under Augustus, who introduced the concept of the &quot;leap year&quot; in 757 AUC (AD 4). The resultant Julian calendar remained in almost universal use in Europe until 1582, and in some countries until as late as the twentieth century.

In the first century BC, Marcus Terentius Varro introduced the &quot;Ab urbe condita&quot; epoch, assuming a foundation of Rome in 753 BC. The system remained in use during the early Middle Ages until the widespread adoption of the Dionysian era in the Carolingian period.

In the Roman Empire, the AUC year could be used alongside the consular year, so that the consulship of Quintus Fufius Calenus and Publius Vatinius could be determined as 707 AUC (or 47 BC), the third consulship of Caius Julius Caesar, with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, as 708 AUC (or 46 BC), and the fourth consulship of Gaius Julius Caesar as 709 AUC (or 45 BC).

The seven-day week has a tradition reaching back to the ancient Near East, but the introduction of the &quot;planetary week&quot; which remains in modern use dates to the Roman Empire period (see also names of the days of the week).

==Middle Ages==
===Christian Europe===

The oldest calendar of saints of the Church of Rome was compiled in the mid-4th century, under Pope Julius I or Pope Liberius. It contained both pagan and Christian festivals. The oldest extant manuscript of the early Christian calendar is the so-called Calendar of Filocalus, produced in AD 354. A more extensive martyrology was compiled by Jerome in the early 5th century. Jean Mabillon published a calendar of the church of Carthage made in ca. AD 483. The Anno Domini epoch is introduced in the 6th century. Extant calendars of the early medieval period are based on Jerome&#x27;s system of numbering of the years of the Metonic cycle, later called the Golden Numbers. A Carolingian-era calendar published by Luc d&#x27;Achery is entitled &quot;Incipit Ordo Solaris Anni cum Litteris a S. Hieronymo superpositis, ad explorandum Septimanae Diem, et Lunae Aetatem investigandam in unoquoque Die per xix Annos.&quot; (&quot;here begins the order of the solar year with the letters placed by Saint Jerome, for the purpose of finding the day of the week and the age of the Moon for any day within [the cycle of] 19 years&quot;). The Leiden Aratea, a Carolingian copy (dated 816) of an astronomical treatise of Germanicus, is an important source for the transmission of the ancient Christian calendar to the medieval period.

In the 8th century, the Anglo-Saxon historian Bede the Venerable used another Latin term, &quot;ante uero incarnationis dominicae tempus&quot; (&quot;the time before the Lord&#x27;s true incarnation&quot;, equivalent to the English &quot;before Christ&quot;), to identify years before the first year of this era. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, even Popes continued to date documents according to regnal years, and usage of AD only gradually became common in Europe from the 11th to the 14th centuries. In 1422, Portugal became the last Western European country to adopt the &quot;Anno Domini&quot; system.

The Icelandic calendar was introduced in the 10th century. While the ancient Germanic calendars were based on lunar months, the new Icelandic calendar introduced a purely solar reckoning, with a year having a fixed number of weeks (52 weeks or 364 days). This necessitated the introduction of &quot;leap weeks&quot; instead of the Julian leap days.

In 1267, the medieval scientist Roger Bacon stated the times of full moons as a number of hours, minutes, seconds, thirds, and fourths (&quot;horae&quot;, &quot;minuta&quot;, &quot;secunda&quot;, &quot;tertia&quot;, and &quot;quarta&quot;) after noon on specified calendar dates. Although a third for of a second remains in some languages, for example Arabic ثالثة (&quot;ṯāliṯa&quot; /θaː.liθa/), the modern second is further divided decimally.

Rival calendar eras to &quot;Anno Domini&quot; remained in use in Christian Europe. In Spain, the &quot;Era of the Caesars&quot; was dated from Octavian&#x27;s conquest of Iberia in 39 BC. It was adopted by the Visigoths and remained in use in Catalonia until 1180, Castille until 1382 and Portugal until 1415.

For chronological purposes, the flaw of the Anno Domini system was that dates have to be reckoned backwards or forwards according as they are BC or AD. According to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;in an ideally perfect system all events would be reckoned in one sequence. The difficulty was to find a starting point whence to reckon, for the beginnings of history in which this should naturally be placed are those of which chronologically we know least.&quot; For both Christians and Jews, the prime historical date was the Year of Creation, or &quot;Annus Mundi&quot;. The Eastern Orthodox Church fixed the date of Creation at 5509 BC. This remained the basis of the ecclesiastical calendar in the Greek and Russian Orthodox world until modern times. The Coptic Church fixed on 5500 BC. Later, the Church of England, under Archbishop Ussher in 1650, would pick 4004 BC.

===Islamic calendar===
The Islamic calendar is based on the prohibition of intercalation (&quot;nasi&#x27;&quot;) by Muhammad, in Islamic tradition dated to a sermon held on 9 Dhu al-Hijjah AH 10 (Julian date: 6 March 632). This resulted in an observationally based lunar calendar shifting relative to the seasons of the solar year.
During the Mughal rule, the land taxes were collected from Bengali people according to the Islamic Hijri calendar. This calendar was a lunar calendar, and its new year did not coincide with the solar agricultural cycles. According to some sources, Mughal Emperor Akbar asked his royal astronomer Fathullah Shirazi to create a new calendar by combining the lunar Islamic calendar and solar Hindu calendar already in use, and this was known as &quot;Fasholi shan&quot; (harvest calendar). According to Amartya Sen, Akbar&#x27;s official calendar &quot;Tarikh-ilahi&quot; with the zero year of 1556 AD was a blend of pre-existing Hindu and Islamic calendars. It was not used much in India outside of Akbar&#x27;s Mughal court, and after his death the calendar he launched was abandoned. However, adds Sen, there are traces of the &quot;Tarikh-ilahi&quot; that survive in the Bengali calendar. Some historians attribute the Bengali calendar to the 7th-century Hindu king Shashanka.

===Other===
The ancient Taichu calendar of China was refined in the medieval period. The Dàmíng Calendar (), created in the Liang dynasty by Zu Chongzhi, introduced the equinoxes. The use of a syzygy to determine the lunar month was first described in the Tang dynasty Wùyín Yuán Calendar ().

The Yuan dynasty (13th/14th century) Shòushí calendar () used spherical trigonometry to find the length of the tropical year. This calendar had a 365.2425-day year, identical to the Gregorian calendar.

A number of other epichoric calendars are tentatively reconstructed for the medieval period. Such reconstructions are mostly limited to a list of month names, as is the case with the pre-Christian Germanic calendar as well as with the Bulgar calendar, which was supposedly in use among the Bulgars in the 10th century, as reconstructed from the 15th-century &quot;Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans&quot;.

===Ethiopian Calendar===
The Ge&#x27;ez or Ethiopian Calendar is a calendar originating from the Ethiopian Empire. It is the liturgical year for Ethiopian and Eritrean Christians belonging to the Orthodox Tewahedo Churches and closely follows the Coptic Christian calendar.

A useful chart providing all the equivalents can be found in Chaîne&#x27;s book on chronology in Ethiopia and Egypt, and can easily be consulted online at the Internet Archive, from to . 

===Nigerian Calendars===
The Igbo calendar is the traditional calendar system of the Igbo people from present-day Nigeria. The calendar has 13 months in a year (afo), 7 weeks in a month (onwa), and 4 days of Igbo market days (afor, nkwo, eke, and orie) in a week (izu) plus an extra day at the end of the year, in the last month. The name of these months was reported by Onwuejeogwu (1981). The Yoruba calendar is a calendar used by the Yoruba people of southwestern and north central Nigeria and southern Benin. The calendar has a year beginning on the last moon of May or first moon of June of the Gregorian calendar. The new year coincides with the Ifá festival. The traditional Yoruba week has four days, the four days that are dedicated to the Orisa.

===Ghana/West African===
The Akan Calendar is a Calendar created by the Akan people (a Kwa group of West Africa) who appear to have used a traditional system of timekeeping based on a six-day week (known as nnanson &quot;seven-days&quot; via inclusive counting). The Gregorian seven-day week is known as nnawɔtwe (eight-days). The combination of these two system resulted in periods of 40 days, known as adaduanan (meaning &quot;forty days&quot;).

===Xhosa Calendar===
The traditional isiXhosa names for months of the year poetically come from names of stars, plants, and flowers that grow or seasonal changes that happen at a given time of year in Southern Africa.

The Xhosa year traditionally begins in June and ends in May when one of the brightest stars visible in the Southern Hemisphere, Canopus, signals the time for harvesting.

==Mesoamerica==

Of all the ancient calendar systems, the Maya and other Mesoamerican systems are the most complex. The Mayan calendar had two years, the 260-day Sacred Round, or &quot;tzolkin&quot;, and the 365-day Vague Year, or &quot;haab&quot;.

The Sacred Round of 260 days is composed of two smaller cycles: the numbers 1 through 13, coupled with 20 different day names: Imix, Ik, Akbal, Kan, Chicchan, Cimi, Manik, Lamat, Muluc, Oc, Chuen, Eb, Ben, Ix, Men, Cib, Caban, Eiznab, Cauac, and Ahau. The Sacred Round was used to determine important activities related to the gods and humans: name individuals, predict the future, decide on auspicious dates for battles, marriages, and so on.

The two cycles of 13 and 20 intermesh and are repeated without interruption: the cycle would begin with 1 Imix, then 2 Ik, then 3 Akbal and so on until the number 13 was reached, at which point the number cycle was restarted so 13 Ben would be followed by 1 Ix, 2 Men and so on. This time Imix would be numbered 8. The cycle ended after 260 days, with the last day being 13 Ahau.

The Vague Year of 365 days is similar to the modern Gregorian calendar, consisting of 18 months of 20 days each, with an unlucky five-day period at the end. The Vague Year had to do primarily with the seasons and agriculture, and was based on the solar cycle. The 18 Maya months are known, in order, as: Pop, Uo, Zip, Zotz, Tzec, Xuc, Yaxkin, Mol, Chen, Yax, Zac, Ceh, Mac, Kankin, Maun, Pax, Kayab and Cumku. The unlucky five-day period was known as Uayeb, and was considered a time which could hold danger, death and bad luck.

The Vague Year began with the month of Pop. The Maya 20-day month always begins with the seating of the month, followed by days numbered 1 to 19, then the seating of the following month, and so on. This ties in with the Maya notion that each month influences the next. The Maya new year would start with 1 Pop, followed by 2 Pop, all the way through to 19 Pop, followed by the seating of the month of Uo, written as 0 Uo, then 1 Uo, 2 Uo and so on. These two cycles coincided every 52 years. The 52-year period of time was called a &quot;bundle&quot; and was similar to a modern-day century.

==Modern calendars==

While the Gregorian calendar is now in worldwide use for secular purposes, various medieval or ancient calendars remain in regional use for religious or social purposes, including the Julian calendar, the Hebrew calendar, the Islamic calendar, various Hindu calendars, the Zoroastrian calendar, etc.

There are also various modern calendars that see limited use, either created for the use of new religious movements or reformed versions of older religious calendars, or calendars introduced by regionalist or nationalist movements.

<text>The following lists events that happened during 1956 in [[Afghanistan]].

==Incumbents==
* Monarch – Mohammed Zahir Shah
* Prime Minister – Mohammed Daoud Khan

==Events==

* January 27 – King Zahir approves the new cabinet still headed by Mohammad Daud Khan, a king&#x27;s cousin, who also holds the portfolio of defense; Naim Khan, another king&#x27;s cousin, continues as Foreign Minister and Second Deputy Premier; Ali Mohammad Khan becomes First Deputy Premier. Daud has thus finally succeeded in ousting from the government the supporters of Gen. Mohammad Arif, Minister of Defense, who was dismissed and put under arrest at the beginning of December 1955. At the same time more than 70 other persons, both army officers and civilians, were also arrested.
* January 28, 1956 – A joint Soviet-Afghan statement says that the U.S.S.R. will ensure delivery of &quot;equipment and materials&quot; on account of the $100,000,000 credit granted in December 1955, and will also grant &quot;other services connected with technical assistance in building certain installations&quot; in many branches of Afghan economy. According to Pakistani sources, $40,000,000 of the Soviet credits is earmarked for arms from the U.S.S.R. and Czechoslovakia and $60,000,000 for building airports and roads.
* March 21–22 – On his way to India, Anastas Mikoyan stays in Kabul.
* July 1956 – The Swedish citizen Gunnel Gummeson and her American boyfriend Peter Winant disappear in Afghanistan on their way home from India. 
* July 1956 – Adnan Menderes, the Turkish prime minister, pays a visit to Afghanistan.
* August 1956 – Maj. Gen. Iskander Mirza, the president of Pakistan, stays four days in the Afghan capital. It is believed that both Menderes and Mirza discussed at Kabul the possibility of Afghanistan&#x27;s joining the Baghdad Pact, the problems of the Pathan or Pakhtu tribesmen, and their aspiration for a &quot;Pakhtunistan&quot; state.
* November 1956 – Mohammad Daud, the Afghan prime minister, visits Karachi, Pakistan. No mention is made thereafter in Afghan official statements of the &quot;Pakhtunistan&quot; question, that is, Afghan plans to create a separate state for Pakhtu-speaking peoples in Pakistan.

<text>Stafford () is a market town and the county town of Staffordshire, England. It is located about south of Stoke-on-Trent, north of Wolverhampton, and northwest of Birmingham. The town had a population of 71,673 in 2021, and is the main settlement within the larger Borough of Stafford, which had a population of 136,837 in 2021.

Stafford has Anglo-Saxon roots, being founded in 913, when Æthelflæd, Lady of Mercia founded a defensive burh, it became the county town of Staffordshire soon after. Stafford became an important market town in the Middle Ages, and later grew into an important industrial town due to the proliferation of shoemaking, engineering and electrical industries.

== History ==
===Ancient===
Prehistoric finds suggest scattered settlements in the area, whilst south-west of the town lies an Iron Age hill fort at Berry Ring. There is also evidence of Roman activity in the area, with finds around Clark and Eastgate Street. However it is thought that the Romans reclaimed the marsh for agriculture rather than settlement.

===Anglo-Saxon===
Stafford means &quot;ford&quot; by a staithe (landing place). The original settlement was on a near island, on a gravelly lowland bounded by loop of the River Sow to the south and west (a tributary of the River Trent). The eastern boundary was formed by Sandyford brook, with a marshy area to the north. Despite many drains being constructed in the 19th century, the area is still prone to flooding.
Stafford has been identified as the island of Bethney, or Bethnei where St Bertelin is said to have founded a hermitage about AD 700, before moving to a more remote area.

Others then settled in the area and named it Stafford. There may have been a settlement near the river crossing in 913, when Æthelflæd, Lady of Mercia founded a burh (fortified settlement) at Stafford; one of many founded across Mercia as part of her campaign against the Danes (Vikings). A mint was founded at Stafford by King Æthelstan (924-39) which continued in operation until the reign of Henry II (1154–89). Stafford also provided an industrial area for centralised production of Roman-style pottery (Stafford Ware), which was supplied to a chain of West Midlands burhs.

The county of Staffordshire was formed at about this time, with Stafford as its county town. Stafford lay within the Pirehill hundred.

===Norman and medieval===
In the Autumn of 1069, a rebellion led by Eadric the Wild against the Norman Conquest culminated in the Battle of Stafford, during which the Anglo-Welsh rebel army was decisively defeated by Norman forces led by Brian of Brittany and William I. Two years later another rebellion, led by Edwin, Earl of Mercia, ended in Edwin&#x27;s assassination and distribution of his lands among the followers of William the Conqueror, who granted Robert de Tonei (later known as Robert de Stafford) the manor of Bradley and one third of the king&#x27;s rents in Stafford. The estate became the seat of the powerful Stafford family.

Following the Battle of Stafford, and the subsequent Harrying of the North, Stafford underwent an extensive period of depopulation and urban decay. Archaeological evidence has revealed that much of the town had been abandoned following the battle, and when the Doomsday Book was completed in 1086, seventeen years after the battle, the town was declared to still be &quot;partially waste&quot; with almost a third of the messuages uninhabited.

Stafford Castle, was first built by Robert de Stafford on a nearby hilltop to the west in the wake of the Norman Invasion, where the motte, moat and baily remain visible to this day. It was first made of wood and later rebuilt in stone around 1348. It has been rebuilt since. A wooden castle had been built in 1070 much closer to the town centre, however this had fallen into ruin by the recording of the Doomsday Book and its precise location remains unknown.

Stafford was a walled town by 1086. The town walls were probably wooden originally, but later rebuilt in stone. There were four gates on the roads into the town from the north, south, east and west. By around 1670 the walls were in ruin, and their remnants were gradually demolished.

Stafford became an important market town during the Middle Ages, which had a particular focus of trading cloth and wool. By the 1280s there were various trades such as tanning, glove making and shoe making being practised in the town. A guild of shoemakers was founded in 1476.

Medieval Stafford was served by two churches; St Chad&#x27;s, which is the oldest building in Stafford, dating from the mid-12th century, and St Mary&#x27;s which dates from the early-13th century.

King Richard II was paraded through the town&#x27;s streets as a prisoner in 1399, by troops loyal to Henry Bolingbroke (the future Henry IV).
===Tudor===
In 1521, Stafford was described as &#x27;a proper and fair town&#x27;, although it went into decline during the Tudor period, and in 1540, many of the houses were described as being in a state of disrepair. Elizabeth I visited Stafford in 1575, at this time the town was still in a state of decay.

The Ancient High House, believed to be the largest timber-framed town house in England, was built in 1595 by John Dorrington; it was extensively restored during 1976-86.

===17th century===
When James I visited Stafford in 1617, he was said to be so impressed by the Shire Hall and other buildings that he called it &quot;Little London&quot;.

During the English Civil War, Stafford was initially held by the Royalists; King Charles I visited Stafford shortly after the outbreak of the war in September 1642, staying for three days at the Ancient High House. The town resisted two assaults by the Parliamentarians in February 1643, but was later taken by them in May 1643, when a force led by Sir William Brereton captured the town by stealth. Stafford then became the seat of the parliamentary county committee. Stafford Castle was defended by a garrison led by Lady Isabel Stafford, but the Parliamentarians finally won control in 1643. A few months later an order was given for the demolition of the castle. However, Stafford&#x27;s famous son Izaak Walton, author of The Compleat Angler, was a staunch Royalist.

In 1658 Stafford elected John Bradshaw, who had been judge at the trial of King Charles I, to represent the town in Parliament. During the reign of Charles II, William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford became implicated in the Popish Plot, in which Titus Oates whipped up anti-Catholic feeling with claims of a plot to have the king killed. Lord Stafford was among those accused; he was unfortunate to be the first to be tried and was beheaded in 1680. The charge was false and on 4 June 1685, the bill of attainder against him was reversed.

===18th century to present===
The town was represented in Parliament from 1780 by the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan. During that period, the town&#x27;s mechanised shoe industry was founded, the best-known factory owner being William Horton. The shoemaking industry flourished over the next century, and became Stafford&#x27;s staple trade, at its height in the 1880s, there were 39 manufacturers in the town. The industry went into steady decline from thereon, and by 1958 there was just one manufacturer, Lotus remaining. The last shoe factory was demolished in 1998.

In 1814, Stafford was linked to the canal network by the River Sow Navigation; a short navigation which linked Stafford to the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. The navigation fell into disuse in the 1930s.

The railways arrived in Stafford in 1837 when the Grand Junction Railway was opened, linking the Liverpool and Manchester Railway to Birmingham, which provided the first rail connection to London. The Trent Valley Railway to Rugby and then direct to London, was opened in 1847. Two more lines, both now closed then followed, from Stafford to Shrewsbury in 1849, and to Uttoxeter in 1867. Stafford became a major junction, which helped to attract other industries.

In the late 19th century, Stafford&#x27;s economy began to diversify into engineering, when the locomotive manufacturer W. G. Bagnall opened a large works in the town in 1875. In the early 1900s electrical engineering became a major activity, when Siemens Brothers, opened a large factory in the town, producing such items as electrical motors, generators and transformers. The electrical industry has been under the ownership of several companies since, including English Electric and GEC.

The Friars&#x27; Walk drill hall was completed in 1913, just in time for the First World War.

The M6 motorway was opened to the west of Stafford in 1962.

In 2013 Stafford celebrated its 1,100th anniversary year with a number of history-based exhibitions, while local historian Nick Thomas and writer Roger Butters were set to produce the two-volume &quot;A Compleat [&quot;sic&quot;] History of Stafford&quot;.

===Civic history===
Stafford was already an ancient borough by the time of the Domesday Book of 1086. Its borough status was confirmed in 1206, when King John issued a charter. Stafford was reconstituted as a municipal borough in 1835. The borough boundaries were expanded in 1876, 1917 and 1934.

The modern Borough of Stafford covers a much larger area then the town itself, and was created in 1974, when the old municipal borough of Stafford was merged with the Stafford Rural District, the Stone Rural District and the Stone Urban District.

===Historic population===
== Landmarks ==
The Elizabethan Ancient High House in the town centre is the largest timber-framed town house in England. It is now a museum with temporary exhibitions.

Stafford Castle was built by the Normans on the nearby hilltop to the west in about 1090, replacing the post-Conquest fort in the town. It was first made of wood, and later rebuilt of stone. It has been rebuilt twice since, and the ruins of the 19th-century Gothic revival castle crowning the earthworks incorporate much of the original stonework. The castle has a visitor centre with audio-visual displays and hands-on items. There is also a recreated medieval herb garden. Shakespeare productions take place in the castle grounds each summer. The castle forms a landmark for drivers, as it is visible from the M6 motorway.
The oldest building now in Stafford is St Chad&#x27;s Church, dating back to the 12th century. The main part of the church is richly decorated. Carvings in its archways and on its pillars may have been made by a group of stonemasons from the Middle East who came to England during the Crusades. Much of the stonework was covered up in the 17th and 18th centuries and the church took on a neo-classical style. In the early 19th-century restoration, work was carried out on the church and the Norman decoration rediscovered. The church hosts &quot;Timewalk&quot;, a computer-generated display that relates the journey of history and mystery within the walls of the church.

St Mary&#x27;s, the collegiate church formerly linked to St Bertelin&#x27;s chapel, was rebuilt in the early 13th century on a cruciform plan, with an aisled nave and chancel typical of the period. It has an impressive octagonal tower, once topped by a tall steeple, which can be picked out in Gough&#x27;s plan shown above. The church was effectively two churches in one, divided by a screen, with the parish using the nave and the collegiate canons the chancel. St Mary&#x27;s was restored in 1842 by Giles Gilbert Scott.
The Shire Hall was built in 1798 as a court house and office of the Mayor and Clerk of Stafford. The Shire Hall used to be the town&#x27;s court house, and is a Grade II listed building. In recent times, the building was used as an art gallery and library, before a new facility was built within the new council buildings, The Market Square has recently gone under a £2 million redevelopment which was completed in November 2023.

Green Hall on Lichfield Road is a Grade II listed manor house (now apartments), originally built about 1810 as Forebridge Hall, known after 1880 as Green Hall. It was previously used as a girls&#x27; school and as council offices.

The Shugborough Hall country estate is out of town. It once belonged to the Earls of Lichfield and is now owned by the National Trust. The 19th-century Sandon Hall is north-east of Stafford. It is set in of parkland, as the seat of the Earl of Harrowby. Weston Hall stands east of Stafford, in the Trent valley with a large park and was once part of the Chartley estate. It is thought that the main part of the hall was built about 1550 as a small dower house, but the architectural evidence suggests it is Jacobean. Weston Hall was extended in 1660 into a three-gabled structure with high-pitched roofs.

== Culture ==

Stafford Gatehouse Theatre is the town&#x27;s main entertainment and cultural venue. Its Met Studio is a dedicated to stand-up comedy and alternative live music. There is an art gallery in the Shire Hall. Staffordshire County Showground, just outside the town, holds many national and local events. The annual Shakespeare Festival at Stafford Castle has attracted many notable people, including Frank Sidebottom and Ann Widdecombe.

Victoria Park, opened in 1908, is a 13-acre (53 ha) Edwardian riverside park with a play park, bowling green, bird cages and greenhouses. It has a children&#x27;s play area, a sand-and-water-jet area replacing an open-air paddling pool, and a bmx/skateboard area. Stafford also has a 9-hole golf course near the town centre.

Recent developments on Riverside allowed for an expansion of the town, notably with a new Odeon cinema to replace the ageing one at the end of the high street. Stafford Film Theatre is based at the Gatehouse Theatre and shows independent and alternative films. There is a tenpin bowling alley at Greyfriars Place. The new Stafford Leisure Centre opened in 2008 on Lammascote Road.

Night life consists of smaller bar and club venues such as Casa, the Grapes, the Picture House, neighbouring night clubs Couture and Poptastic, Hogarths, and rock gigs at the live music venue Redrum. Most of these are in walking distance of each other. There is a big student patronage, with coaches bringing them from Stoke-on-Trent, Cannock, and Wolverhampton.

A new shopping centre was completed in 2017, housing major stores and a number of restaurants,
The guildhall shopping centre no longer is open

Like most of the British Isles, Stafford has a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest Met Office weather station is at Penkridge, about 5 miles to the south.

== Economy ==

=== Shoemaking ===
Stafford has a history of shoemaking as far back as 1476, when it was a cottage industry, but a manufacturing process was introduced in the 1700s. William Horton founded a business in 1767 that became the largest shoe company in Stafford, selling worldwide. He had several government contracts through the town&#x27;s Member of Parliament (MP), the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan. The shoe industry gradually died out in the late 20th century, with Lotus Shoes the last manufacturer. Its factory in Sandon Road was demolished in 2001 and replaced by housing.

=== Engineering ===
A locomotive firm, WG Bagnall, was set up in 1875 to manufacture steam engines for the London, Midland &amp; Scottish Railway and the Great Western Railway. Between 1875 and 1962, the Castle Engine Works in Castle Town produced 1,869 locomotives, including steam, diesel and electric. It was taken over in 1961 by English Electric, which also bought the Stafford-based engine manufacturer WH Dorman &amp; Company. This had merged with Bagnall&#x27;s by then.

Since 1901, a major industrial activity has been heavy electrical engineering, particularly power station transformers. The works have been successively owned by Siemens Brothers, English Electric, GEC and GEC Alsthom. Alstom T&amp;D was sold in 2004 to Areva. At the end of 2009, Areva T&amp;D was split between former owners Alstom and Schneider Electric. At the end of 2015, the works were acquired by General Electric consolidating Stafford as the Centre of Excellence for HVDC, AC Substations and Converter Transformers. Each transformer weighs several hundred tons and a road train is used for transport. In the 1968 Hixon rail crash, one such road train was struck by an express train on a level crossing.

British Reinforced Concrete Engineering (BRC) moved from Manchester, and opened a large factory in Stafford in 1926. In the late 1970s, BRC employed around 750 people in Stafford, however the business declined, and the factory closed in 1990.

Perkins Engines has a factory for diesel engines in Littleworth. Stafford is also a dormitory town for commuting to Stoke-on-Trent and Birmingham.

Universal Grinding Wheel Ltd was founded in the town in 1913. Its Doxey Road site was enlarged over the years to cover . By the 1970s the company had become Europe’s largest manufacturer of grinding wheels. The company was taken over a number of times, eventually becoming part of French multi-national St Gobain. The business relocated to new premises on an industrial park in the north of the town and the Doxey Road factory was demolished in 2019.

=== Other manufacturing ===
Adhesives manufacturer Bostik, which took over Evode Ltd has a factory on Common Road. 

=== Services ===
The public sector provides much local employment, with Staffordshire County Council, Stafford Borough Council and Staffordshire Police all headquartered in the town. Stafford Prison, County Hospital and Beacon Barracks are other sources of public-sector employment.

The town was home to the computer science and IT campus of Staffordshire University, along with Beaconside campus, which housed the Faculty of Computing Engineering and Technology and part of the Business School. These have all been transferred to Stoke-on-Trent. The only block of Stafford University left in use is the School of Health in Blackheath Lane, which teaches medical nursing. The main Stoke campus lies about to the north.

The Guildhall Shopping Centre in the centre of town offered over 40 retail outlets, it has since closed. The three superstores around the main town centre were joined by two others in 2018.

== Transport ==
=== Railways ===

Stafford railway station was once a major railway hub, but the suspension of passenger services on the Stafford to Uttoxeter line in 1939 and Beeching&#x27;s closure of the Stafford to Shrewsbury Line in 1964 eliminated the station&#x27;s east-west traffic. The years up to 2008 saw cross-country trains (operated by Virgin CrossCountry) stopping at Stafford less frequently. Since Arriva CrossCountry took over the franchise and adopted a new timetable in 2008, this has reversed and services between Manchester Piccadilly and Birmingham New Street almost always stop at Stafford, giving a service typically every 30 mins on weekdays. Beyond Birmingham, the services continue alternately to Bristol Temple Meads and Bournemouth.

Avanti West Coast services to London Euston and Liverpool Lime Street operate hourly in each direction seven days a week. In December 2008, London Midland introduced a service stopping at Stafford on the Crewe to London Euston route and a Birmingham New Street–Liverpool Lime Street service that departs from Stafford normally every 30 mins on weekdays. These are now operated by West Midlands Trains. At least one train a day in each direction between Birmingham New Street and Crewe is operated by Transport for Wales, usually the first and last of the day.

=== Roads ===
Junctions 13 (Stafford South &amp; Central) and 14 (Stafford North) of the M6 motorway provide access to the town, so that Birmingham and Manchester are easily reached.

Select Bus Services operate a number of local routes to the county town&#x27;s suburbs, while Arriva Midlands runs one to Telford. National Express West Midlands had operated service 54 between Wolverhampton and Stafford until April 2020, when it was cut short and later withdrawn. Select Bus offer a replacement 877/878 to Wolverhampton calling at rural villages Bradley, Wheaton Aston, Brewood and Coven. Services to Stone and Stoke-on-Trent are handled by First Potteries (service 101).

== Politics and public services ==
=== Local government ===

Staffordshire County Council headquarters are in central Stafford. Most staff in the town work in the Staffordshire Place development, which opened in 2011. The shift of administrative staff to Staffordshire Place meant conversion of most offices into private homes, but the County Council still meets at County Buildings in Martin St.

For much of the 20th century the local municipal council was based at the Borough Hall in Eastgate Street. Following local government reorganisation in 1974, a modern Civic Centre was built for the enlarged Stafford Borough Council in Riverside and completed in 1978.

=== National representation===
Stafford has its own parliamentary constituency, represented since 2024 by Leigh Ingham of the Labour Party.

=== Emergency services ===

County Hospital provides a range of non-specialist medical and surgical services. Its accident and emergency unit is the only such facility in the town. In March 2009, the hospital was involved in a scandal after the release of a Healthcare Commission report that detailed severe failings. St George&#x27;s Hospital, part of the South Staffordshire and Shropshire Health Care Trust, is a combination of the Kingsmead (previously an elderly care facility) and St George&#x27;s psychiatric hospital. It provides mental health services, including a psychiatric intensive care unit, secure units, an eating disorder unit, an EMI unit for the elderly and mentally frail, drug and alcohol addiction services, and open wards. There is an outpatient facility, where the town&#x27;s Alcoholics Anonymous also meets. Rowley Hall Hospital in Rowley Park is private and run by Ramsay Healthcare, but offers some NHS treatment. The town receives primary health care from the South Staffordshire Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG).

Policing is provided by Staffordshire Police, headquartered in Weston Road. Its former headquarters in Cannock Road is giving way to a housing estate. There is a town-centre police station in Eastgate St. Statutory emergency fire and rescue service is provided by the Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service, which has stations in Beaconside and Rising Brook.

=== Justice ===

== MOD Stafford ==
MOD Stafford is located on Beaconside. Originally RAF Stafford, the base was a non-flying Royal Air Force station. It was redesignated MOD Stafford in March 2006, an event marked by a fly-past and a flag-lowering ceremony. For many years, the site employed civilians and military personnel, but it was handed over by the Royal Air Force under the current policy of defence strategy and streamlining. A small Tactical Supply Wing (TSW) still operates from the base, which now houses two Royal Signals units and an RAF Regiment contingent alongside Tactical Supply Wing.

South Staffordshire College has a base in the village of Rodbaston on the edge of Stafford. It is largely an agricultural college.

Staffordshire University had a large campus in the east of the town which focused heavily on computing, engineering and media technologies (film, music and computer games). It also ran teacher-training courses. The university had two halls of residence opposite the campus, the smaller Yarlet with 51 rooms and the larger Stafford Court with 554 Rooms. Stafford Court was divided into 13 &quot;houses&quot; named after local villages. This part of the campus closed in 2016, with the majority of facilities relocating to its new campus in Stoke-on-Trent. The University retains a significant presence at its Blackheath Lane campus to cater for Health related courses, such as Nursing and Paramedics.

In addition to short-range indoor shooting facilities, the club has a number of outdoor ranges, including Kingsbury, Sennybridge and Thorpe, for larger-calibre long-range shooting.

Stafford Cricket and Hockey Club, an ECB Clubmark Accredited Club founded in 1864, is almost certainly the town&#x27;s oldest sports club. It appears to have played originally at the Lammascotes, before being offered a field at the Hough (Lichfield Road/GEC site) in 1899, which belonged to the grammar school. In 1984 the club made a move to Riverway in 1984, as the Hough came under the ownership of GEC. It currently owns at Riverway and hosts numerous sports: two cricket pitches in summer and football, mini-football, rugby and hockey facilities in winter. In 1999 it won a £200,000 lottery grant towards a new pavilion completed in 2000, with six changing rooms and a function room. The cricket section welcomes players of all abilities.

<text>In mathematics, conformal geometry is the study of the set of angle-preserving (conformal) transformations on a space.

In a real two dimensional space, conformal geometry is precisely the geometry of Riemann surfaces. In space higher than two dimensions, conformal geometry may refer either to the study of conformal transformations of what are called &quot;flat spaces&quot; (such as Euclidean spaces or spheres), or to the study of conformal manifolds which are Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifolds with a class of metrics that are defined up to scale. Study of the flat structures is sometimes termed Möbius geometry, and is a type of Klein geometry.

==Conformal manifolds==
A conformal manifold is a Riemannian manifold (or pseudo-Riemannian manifold) equipped with an equivalence class of metric tensors, in which two metrics &quot;g&quot; and &quot;h&quot; are equivalent if and only if

:formula_1

where &quot;λ&quot; is a real-valued smooth function defined on the manifold and is called the conformal factor. An equivalence class of such metrics is known as a conformal metric or conformal class. Thus, a conformal metric may be regarded as a metric that is only defined &quot;up to scale&quot;. Often conformal metrics are treated by selecting a metric in the conformal class, and applying only &quot;conformally invariant&quot; constructions to the chosen metric.

A conformal metric is conformally flat if there is a metric representing it that is flat, in the usual sense that the Riemann curvature tensor vanishes. It may only be possible to find a metric in the conformal class that is flat in an open neighborhood of each point. When it is necessary to distinguish these cases, the latter is called &quot;locally conformally flat&quot;, although often in the literature no distinction is maintained. The &quot;n&quot;-sphere is a locally conformally flat manifold that is not globally conformally flat in this sense, whereas a Euclidean space, a torus, or any conformal manifold that is covered by an open subset of Euclidean space is (globally) conformally flat in this sense. A locally conformally flat manifold is locally conformal to a Möbius geometry, meaning that there exists an angle preserving local diffeomorphism from the manifold into a Möbius geometry. In two dimensions, every conformal metric is locally conformally flat. In dimension a conformal metric is locally conformally flat if and only if its Weyl tensor vanishes; in dimension , if and only if the Cotton tensor vanishes.

Conformal geometry has a number of features which distinguish it from (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry. The first is that although in (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry one has a well-defined metric at each point, in conformal geometry one only has a class of metrics. Thus the length of a tangent vector cannot be defined, but the angle between two vectors still can. Another feature is that there is no Levi-Civita connection because if &quot;g&quot; and &quot;λ&quot;2&quot;g&quot; are two representatives of the conformal structure, then the Christoffel symbols of &quot;g&quot; and &quot;λ&quot;2&quot;g&quot; would not agree. Those associated with &quot;λ&quot;2&quot;g&quot; would involve derivatives of the function λ whereas those associated with &quot;g&quot; would not.

Despite these differences, conformal geometry is still tractable. The Levi-Civita connection and curvature tensor, although only being defined once a particular representative of the conformal structure has been singled out, do satisfy certain transformation laws involving the &quot;λ&quot; and its derivatives when a different representative is chosen. In particular, (in dimension higher than 3) the Weyl tensor turns out not to depend on &quot;λ&quot;, and so it is a conformal invariant. Moreover, even though there is no Levi-Civita connection on a conformal manifold, one can instead work with a conformal connection, which can be handled either as a type of Cartan connection modelled on the associated Möbius geometry, or as a Weyl connection. This allows one to define conformal curvature and other invariants of the conformal structure.

==Möbius geometry==

Möbius geometry is the study of &quot;Euclidean space with a point added at infinity&quot;, or a &quot;Minkowski (or pseudo-Euclidean) space with a null cone added at infinity&quot;. That is, the setting is a compactification of a familiar space; the geometry is concerned with the implications of preserving angles.

At an abstract level, the Euclidean and pseudo-Euclidean spaces can be handled in much the same way, except in the case of dimension two. The compactified two-dimensional Minkowski plane exhibits extensive conformal symmetry. Formally, its group of conformal transformations is infinite-dimensional. By contrast, the group of conformal transformations of the compactified Euclidean plane is only 6-dimensional.

===Two dimensions===

====Minkowski plane====
The conformal group for the Minkowski quadratic form in the plane is the abelian Lie group

:formula_2

with Lie algebra consisting of all real diagonal matrices.

Consider now the Minkowski plane, formula_3 equipped with the metric
: formula_4

A 1-parameter group of conformal transformations gives rise to a vector field &quot;X&quot; with the property that the Lie derivative of &quot;g&quot; along &quot;X&quot; is proportional to &quot;g&quot;. Symbolically,
:   for some &quot;λ&quot;.

In particular, using the above description of the Lie algebra , this implies that
# L&quot;X&quot;  
# L&quot;X&quot;  
for some real-valued functions &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; depending, respectively, on &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.

Conversely, given any such pair of real-valued functions, there exists a vector field &quot;X&quot; satisfying 1. and 2. Hence the Lie algebra of infinitesimal symmetries of the conformal structure, the Witt algebra, is infinite-dimensional.

The conformal compactification of the Minkowski plane is a Cartesian product of two circles . On the universal cover, there is no obstruction to integrating the infinitesimal symmetries, and so the group of conformal transformations is the infinite-dimensional Lie group
:formula_5
where Diff(&quot;S&quot;1) is the diffeomorphism group of the circle.

The conformal group and its Lie algebra are of current interest in two-dimensional conformal field theory.

====Euclidean space====
The group of conformal symmetries of the quadratic form

:formula_6

is the group , the multiplicative group of the complex numbers. Its Lie algebra is .

Consider the (Euclidean) complex plane equipped with the metric

:formula_7

The infinitesimal conformal symmetries satisfy
#formula_8
#formula_9
where &quot;f&quot; satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equation, and so is holomorphic over its domain. (See Witt algebra.)

The conformal isometries of a domain therefore consist of holomorphic self-maps. In particular, on the conformal compactification – the Riemann sphere – the conformal transformations are given by the Möbius transformations

:formula_10

where is nonzero.

===Higher dimensions===
In two dimensions, the group of conformal automorphisms of a space can be quite large (as in the case of Lorentzian signature) or variable (as with the case of Euclidean signature). The comparative lack of rigidity of the two-dimensional case with that of higher dimensions owes to the analytical fact that the asymptotic developments of the infinitesimal automorphisms of the structure are relatively unconstrained. In Lorentzian signature, the freedom is in a pair of real valued functions. In Euclidean, the freedom is in a single holomorphic function.

In the case of higher dimensions, the asymptotic developments of infinitesimal symmetries are at most quadratic polynomials. In particular, they form a finite-dimensional Lie algebra. The pointwise infinitesimal conformal symmetries of a manifold can be integrated precisely when the manifold is a certain model &quot;conformally flat&quot; space (up to taking universal covers and discrete group quotients).

The general theory of conformal geometry is similar, although with some differences, in the cases of Euclidean and pseudo-Euclidean signature. In either case, there are a number of ways of introducing the model space of conformally flat geometry. Unless otherwise clear from the context, this article treats the case of Euclidean conformal geometry with the understanding that it also applies, &quot;mutatis mutandis&quot;, to the pseudo-Euclidean situation.

====The inversive model====
The inversive model of conformal geometry consists of the group of local transformations on the Euclidean space E&quot;n&quot; generated by inversion in spheres. By Liouville&#x27;s theorem, any angle-preserving local (conformal) transformation is of this form. From this perspective, the transformation properties of flat conformal space are those of inversive geometry.

====The projective model====
The projective model identifies the conformal sphere with a certain quadric in a projective space. Let &quot;q&quot; denote the Lorentzian quadratic form on R&quot;n&quot;+2 defined by

:formula_11

In the projective space P(R&quot;n&quot;+2), let &quot;S&quot; be the locus of . Then &quot;S&quot; is the projective (or Möbius) model of conformal geometry. A conformal transformation on &quot;S&quot; is a projective linear transformation of P(R&quot;n&quot;+2) that leaves the quadric invariant.

In a related construction, the quadric &quot;S&quot; is thought of as the celestial sphere at infinity of the null cone in the Minkowski space , which is equipped with the quadratic form &quot;q&quot; as above. The null cone is defined by

:formula_12

This is the affine cone over the projective quadric &quot;S&quot;. Let &quot;N&quot;+ be the future part of the null cone (with the origin deleted). Then the tautological projection restricts to a projection . This gives &quot;N&quot;+ the structure of a line bundle over &quot;S&quot;. Conformal transformations on &quot;S&quot; are induced by the orthochronous Lorentz transformations of , since these are homogeneous linear transformations preserving the future null cone.

====The Euclidean sphere====
Intuitively, the conformally flat geometry of a sphere is less rigid than the Riemannian geometry of a sphere. Conformal symmetries of a sphere are generated by the inversion in all of its hyperspheres. On the other hand, Riemannian isometries of a sphere are generated by inversions in &quot;geodesic&quot; hyperspheres (see the Cartan–Dieudonné theorem.) The Euclidean sphere can be mapped to the conformal sphere in a canonical manner, but not vice versa.

The Euclidean unit sphere is the locus in R&quot;n&quot;+1

:formula_13

This can be mapped to the Minkowski space by letting

:formula_14

It is readily seen that the image of the sphere under this transformation is null in the Minkowski space, and so it lies on the cone &quot;N&quot;+. Consequently, it determines a cross-section of the line bundle .

Nevertheless, there was an arbitrary choice. If &quot;κ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is any positive function of , then the assignment

:formula_15

also gives a mapping into &quot;N&quot;+. The function &quot;κ&quot; is an arbitrary choice of &quot;conformal scale&quot;.

====Representative metrics====
A representative Riemannian metric on the sphere is a metric which is proportional to the standard sphere metric. This gives a realization of the sphere as a conformal manifold. The standard sphere metric is the restriction of the Euclidean metric on R&quot;n&quot;+1

:formula_16

to the sphere

:formula_13

A conformal representative of &quot;g&quot; is a metric of the form &quot;λ&quot;2&quot;g&quot;, where &quot;λ&quot; is a positive function on the sphere. The conformal class of &quot;g&quot;, denoted [&quot;g&quot;], is the collection of all such representatives:

:formula_18

An embedding of the Euclidean sphere into &quot;N&quot;+, as in the previous section, determines a conformal scale on &quot;S&quot;. Conversely, any conformal scale on &quot;S&quot; is given by such an embedding. Thus the line bundle is identified with the bundle of conformal scales on &quot;S&quot;: to give a section of this bundle is tantamount to specifying a metric in the conformal class [&quot;g&quot;].

====Ambient metric model====

Another way to realize the representative metrics is through a special coordinate system on . Suppose that the Euclidean &quot;n&quot;-sphere &quot;S&quot; carries a stereographic coordinate system. This consists of the following map of :

:formula_19

In terms of these stereographic coordinates, it is possible to give a coordinate system on the null cone &quot;N&quot;+ in Minkowski space. Using the embedding given above, the representative metric section of the null cone is

:formula_20

Introduce a new variable &quot;t&quot; corresponding to dilations up &quot;N&quot;+, so that the null cone is coordinatized by

:formula_21

Finally, let &quot;ρ&quot; be the following defining function of &quot;N&quot;+:

:formula_22

In the &quot;t&quot;, &quot;ρ&quot;, &quot;y&quot; coordinates on , the Minkowski metric takes the form:

:formula_23

where &quot;g&quot;&quot;ij&quot; is the metric on the sphere.

In these terms, a section of the bundle &quot;N&quot;+ consists of a specification of the value of the variable as a function of the &quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot; along the null cone . This yields the following representative of the conformal metric on &quot;S&quot;:

:formula_24

====The Kleinian model====
Consider first the case of the flat conformal geometry in Euclidean signature. The &quot;n&quot;-dimensional model is the celestial sphere of the -dimensional Lorentzian space R&quot;n&quot;+1,1. Here the model is a Klein geometry: a homogeneous space &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; where acting on the -dimensional Lorentzian space R&quot;n&quot;+1,1 and &quot;H&quot; is the isotropy group of a fixed null ray in the light cone. Thus the conformally flat models are the spaces of inversive geometry. For pseudo-Euclidean of metric signature , the model flat geometry is defined analogously as the homogeneous space , where &quot;H&quot; is again taken as the stabilizer of a null line. Note that both the Euclidean and pseudo-Euclidean model spaces are compact.

====The conformal Lie algebras====
To describe the groups and algebras involved in the flat model space, fix the following form on :

:formula_25
where &quot;J&quot; is a quadratic form of signature . Then consists of matrices stabilizing (the superscript &quot;t&quot; means transpose). The Lie algebra admits a Cartan decomposition

:formula_26

where

:formula_27

:formula_28

Alternatively, this decomposition agrees with a natural Lie algebra structure defined on .

The stabilizer of the null ray pointing up the last coordinate vector is given by the Borel subalgebra

:h = g0 ⊕ g1.

<doc id="295909" wikidata="Q1156955" url="?curid=295909" title="Zero tolerance">
<text>A zero-tolerance policy is one which imposes a punishment for every infraction of a stated rule. Zero-tolerance policies forbid people in positions of authority from exercising discretion or changing punishments to fit the circumstances subjectively; they are required to impose a predetermined punishment regardless of individual culpability, extenuating circumstances, or history. This predetermined punishment, whether mild or severe, is always meted out.

Zero-tolerance policies are studied in criminology and are common in both formal and informal policing systems around the world. The policies also appear in informal situations where there may be sexual harassment or Internet misuse in educational and workplace environments. In 2014, the mass incarceration in the United States based upon low-level offenses has resulted in an outcry on the use of zero tolerance in schools and communities.

Little evidence supports the claimed effectiveness of zero-tolerance policies. One underlying problem is that there are a great many reasons why people hesitate to intervene, or to report behavior they find to be unacceptable or unlawful. Zero-tolerance policies address, at best, only a few of these reasons.

==Etymology==
According to the &quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot;, the first recorded use of the term &quot;zero tolerance&quot; was in 1972 and was originally used in US politics.

However, the term appears as early as 1939 in reference to plant diseases (&quot;While a zero tolerance may seem a severe penalty ...&quot;), in 1942 in reference to optical equipment (&quot;They cut and polish glass precisely to &#x27;zero tolerance,&#x27; ...&quot;), and in 1945 in reference to poultry diseases (&quot;Your safety is in buying chicks hatched from breeders showing zero tolerance.&quot;). It also appeared in the mid-1960s, in reference to an absolute ban on the pesticide heptachlor by the US Food and Drug Administration. For example, an article that appeared in the June 1963 issue of &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; stated &quot;Heptachlor, though, is even more toxic and has been given a &#x27;zero tolerance&#x27; by the FDA; that is, not even the slightest trace of heptachlor is permitted on food.&quot;

==History==
The idea behind zero-tolerance policies can be traced back to the Safe and Clean Neighborhoods Act, which was approved in New Jersey in 1973 and had the same underlying assumptions. The ideas behind the 1973 New Jersey policy were later popularized in 1982, when a US cultural magazine, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, published an article by James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling about the broken windows theory of crime. Their name for the idea comes from the following example:
According to scholars, zero tolerance is the concept of giving &quot;carte blanche&quot; to the police for the inflexible repression of minor offenses, homeless people, and the disorders associated with them. A well-known criticism to this approach is that it redefines social problems in terms of security, it considers the poor as criminals, and it reduces crimes to only &quot;street crimes,&quot; those committed by lower social classes and excludes white-collar crimes.

On the historical examples of the application of &quot;zero tolerance&quot; kind of policies, nearly all the scientific studies conclude that it failed to play the leading role in the reduction of crimes that is claimed by its advocates. On the other hand, large majorities of people who are living in communities in which zero-tolerance policing has been followed believe that it has actually played a key, leading role in reducing crime in their communities. It has been alleged that in New York City, the decline of the crime rate had started well before Rudy Giuliani came to power in 1993. None of the decreasing processes had any particular inflection under him, and during the same period, the decrease in crime was the same in the other major US cities, even those with an opposite security policy. However, the experience of the vast majority of New Yorkers led them to precisely the opposite conclusion and allowed a Republican to win and retain the Mayor&#x27;s office for the first time in decades, in large part because of the perception that zero-tolerance policing was playing key to the city&#x27;s improving crime situation. On the other hand, some argue that in 1984-1987, the city had already experienced a policy similar to Giuliani&#x27;s but instead faced an increase in the crime rate.

Two American specialists, Edward Maguire, a professor at American University, and John Eck from the University of Cincinnati, rigorously evaluated all the scientific work designed to test the effectiveness of the police in the fight against crime. They concluded that &quot;neither the number of policemen engaged in the battle, or internal changes and organizational culture of law enforcement agencies (such as the introduction of community policing) have by themselves any impact on the evolution of offenses.&quot; They argue that the crime decrease was caused by not the work of the police and the judiciary but economic and demographic factors: mainly an unprecedented economic growth with jobs for millions of young people and a shift from the use of crack towards other drugs.

An alternative argument comes from Kelling and William Bratton, Giuliani&#x27;s original police chief, who argue that broken windows policing methods contributed to the decrease in crime but they were not a form of zero tolerance:
Sheldon Wein has set out a list of six characteristics of a zero-tolerance policy:
#Full enforcement (all those for whom there is adequate evidence that they have violated the rule are to be identified)
#Lack of prosecutorial discretion (for every plausibly accused person, it is determined whether the person has in fact violated the policy)
#Strict constructivist interpretation (no room for narrow interpretation of the rule)
#Strict liability (no excuses or justifications)
#Mandatory punishment (not under a mandatory minimum penalty)
#Harsh punishment (mandatory minimum penalty is considered relatively harsh given the nature of the crime).

Wein sees those points as representing &quot;focal meaning&quot; of the concept. Not all must met literally, but any policy that clearly meets all six of those conditions would definitely be seen as a case of a zero-tolerance policy.

==Applications==
===Bullying in the workplace===

Various institutions have undertaken zero-tolerance policies such as in the military, in the workplace, and in schools in an effort to propagate the persecution of behavior deemed socially disordered or unacceptable. Proponents hope that such policies will underscore the commitment of administrators to prevent such behavior. Others raise a concern about that use of zero-tolerance policies, a concern that derives from an analysis of errors of omission and errors of commission.

The reasoning is that failure to proscribe unacceptable behavior may lead to errors of omission, and too little will be done. However, zero tolerance may be seen as a kind of ruthless management, which may lead to a perception of &quot;too much being done.&quot; If people fear that their co-workers or fellow students may be fired, terminated, or expelled, they may not come forward at all when they see behavior deemed unacceptable. (That is a classic example of Type I and type II errors.) Thus, a too stringent policy may actually reduce reports of illegal behavior.

===Narcotics===

In the United States, zero tolerance, an approach against drugs, was originally designed as a part of the War on Drugs under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush – ostensibly to curb the transfer of drugs at the borders. Law enforcement was to target the drug users, rather than the transporters or suppliers, under the assumption that harsh sentences and strict enforcement of personal use would reduce demand and strike at root cause of the drug problem. The policy did not require additional laws; existing law was instead enacted with less leniency. Similar concepts in other countries, such as Sweden, Italy, Japan, Singapore China, India, and Russia have since been labeled zero-tolerance.

A consistence of zero tolerance is the absolute dichotomy between the legality of any use and no use and the equating all illicit drugs and any form of use as undesirable and harmful to society. That contrasts the views of those who stress the disparity in harmfulness among drugs and would like to distinguish between occasional drug use and problem drug use. Although some harm reductionists also see drug use as generally undesirable, they hold that the resources would do more good if they were allocated toward helping problem drug users, instead of combating all drug users. For example, research from Switzerland indicates that emphasis on problem drug users &quot;seems to have contributed to the image of heroin as unattractive for young people.&quot;

More generally, zero-tolerance advocates hold the aim of ridding society of all illicit drug use and that criminal justice has an important role in that endeavor. The Swedish Parliament, for example, set the vision &quot;a drug-free society&quot; as the official goal for the country&#x27;s drug policy in 1978. The visions were to prompt new practices inspired by Nils Bejerot that were later called &quot;zero tolerance&quot;. In 1980, the Swedish Minister of Justice dropped its practice of giving waivers for possession of drugs for personal use after years of its lowering of thresholds. The same year, police began to prioritize drug users and street-level drug crimes over drug distributors. In 1988, all non-medicinally prescribed usage became illegal, and in 1993, the enforcement of personal use was eased by permitting the police to take blood or urine samples from suspects. The unrelenting approach towards drug users, together with generous treatment opportunities, has received the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime&#x27;s approval and is cited by the United Nations as one of the main reasons for Sweden&#x27;s relatively-low drug prevalence rates. However, that interpretation of the statistics and the more general success of Sweden&#x27;s drug policies are disputed.

===Driving===
The term is used in the context of drunk driving to refer to a lower illegal blood alcohol content for drivers under the age of 21. The legal limit in almost all US states is 0.08%. Utah is the exception, at 0.05%. For drivers under 21, the prohibited level in 16 states is 0.01% or 0.02%, which is also true in Puerto Rico, a US territory, despite its drinking age of 18.

Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, and Sweden have zero-tolerance laws for drugs and driving in Europe, as opposed to the other main legal approach in which laws forbidding impaired driving are enacted instead. Legislation varies in different countries that practice zero tolerance on drug use for drivers. Only a limited set of (common) drugs is included in the zero-tolerance legislation in Germany and Belgium. However, in Finland and Sweden, all controlled substances fall into the scope of zero tolerance unless they are covered by a prescription.

In Argentina, the Cordoba State Highway Patrol enforces a zero-tolerance policy.

In Asia, Japan also practices zero tolerance. People receive a fine and can be fired even the next morning if there are still traces of alcohol. Foreigners may even be deported.

===In schools===
Zero-tolerance policies have been adopted in schools and other education venues around the world. The policies are usually promoted as preventing drug abuse, violence, and gang activity in schools. Common zero-tolerance policies concern possession or use of recreational drugs or weapons. Students and sometimes staff, parents, and other visitors who possess a banned item or perform any prohibited action for any reason are automatically punished. School administrators are barred from using their judgment, reducing severe punishments to be proportional to minor offenses, or considering extenuating circumstances. For example, the policies treat possession of a knife identically, regardless of whether the knife is a blunt table knife being used to eat a meal, a craft knife used in an art class, or a switchblade with no reasonable practical or educational value. Such policies are thus sometimes derided as &quot;zero intelligence policies.&quot;

There is no credible evidence that zero tolerance reduces violence or drug abuse by students.

The unintended negative consequences are clearly documented and sometimes severe: school suspension and expulsion result in a number of negative outcomes for both schools and students. Although the policies are facially neutral, minority children are the most likely to suffer the negative consequences of zero tolerance.

The policies have also resulted in embarrassing publicity for schools. Also, they have been struck down by the courts and by Departments of Education and weakened by legislatures.

==Criticism==
Some critics have argued that zero-tolerance policing violates the Law Enforcement Code of Conduct passed by the International Association of Chiefs of Police. The code requires that police behave in a courteous and fair manner, treat all citizens in a respectable and decent manner, and never use unnecessary force. Criminologist Matthew Barnett Robinson criticized the practice:
Critics say that zero-tolerance policing fails because it destroys several important requisites for successful community policing: police accountability, openness to the public, and community cooperation (Cox and Wade 1998: 106).

Zero tolerance violates principles of health and human services and standards for the education and healthy growth of children, families and communities. Even traditional community service providers in the 1970s aimed for &quot;services for all&quot; (such as zero reject), instead of 100% societal exclusion (zero tolerance). Public administration and disability has supported principles that include education, employment, housing, transportation, recreation, and political participation in the community, which zero-tolerance groups claim are not a right in the US.

Opponents of zero tolerance believe that such a policy neglects investigation on a case-by-case basis and may lead to unreasonably harsh penalties for crimes that may not warrant such penalties in reality. Another criticism of zero-tolerance policies is that it gives officers and the legal system little discretion in dealing with offenders. Zero-tolerance policies may prohibit their enforcers from making the punishment fit the crime.

Fixed sentencing guidelines may incite offenders to commit more serious crimes because they know their punishment will be the same no matter the degree of their actions. That phenomenon of human nature is described in an adage that dates back to at least the 17th century, &quot;might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb&quot;. Until 1820, the English law prescribed hanging for stealing anything worth more than one shilling, whether it was a low-value lamb or a whole flock of sheep.

In the kids for cash scandal, Judge Mark Ciavarella, who promoted a platform of zero tolerance, received kickbacks for constructing a private prison that housed juvenile offenders and then proceeded to fill the prison by sentencing children to extended stays in juvenile detention for offenses as minimal as mocking a principal on Myspace, scuffles in hallways, trespassing in a vacant building, and shoplifting DVDs from Walmart. Critics of zero-tolerance policies argue that harsh punishments for minor offences are normalized. The documentary &quot;Kids for Cash&quot; interviews experts on adolescent behaviour who argue that the zero-tolerance model has become a dominant approach to policing juvenile offences after the Columbine shooting.

Recently, argumentation theorists (especially Sheldon Wein) have suggested that, frequently, when people advocate adopting a zero-tolerance policy, they commit what he has called the &quot;zero-tolerance fallacy&quot;. Subsequently, Wein has proposed standards which arguments for zero-tolerance policies must meet in order to avoid such fallacious inferences.

<doc id="295910" wikidata="Q7888060" url="?curid=295910" title="United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1967">
<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1967 with the song &quot;Puppet on a String&quot;, written by Bill Martin and Phil Coulter, and performed by Sandie Shaw. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final titled &quot;A Song for Europe 1967&quot;, after having previously selected the performer internally. The entry eventually won the Eurovision Song Contest.

==Before Eurovision==
===&quot;A Song for Europe 1967&quot;===
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) held a national pre-selection to choose the song that would go to the Eurovision Song Contest 1967. It was held on 25 February 1967 and presented by Rolf Harris. Harris&#x27;s weekly show had been the showcase for the five songs in the competition, which had been performed in successive weeks prior to the final.

The internal BBC selection of Sandie Shaw as the singer was something of a departure; in recognition of changing trends in the contest, she was arguably the first real &quot;pop&quot; star to be chosen as the British representative. Shaw and her manager Eve Taylor were permitted to select one of the finalists, submitting &quot;Had a Dream Last Night&quot;, written by her regular songwriter and producer Chris Andrews, who had previously had a song in the , &quot;One Day&quot;, performed by Kathy Kirby. Shaw had recorded a version of that track herself. Viewers voted on postcards via mail to decide the winner and the chosen song was &quot;Puppet on a String&quot;.

Shaw released all five songs from the contest, with the winner featuring the runner up on the B-side of a single that reached No.1 in the single chart for three weeks and selling in excess of 4,000,000 copies worldwide. Some estimates make this the biggest selling single globally by a British female artist. In Germany it sold in excess of 1,000,000 copies and was the biggest selling single of the year. Shaw also released an extended play maxi single featuring four of the five finalists, excluding the winner. This EP titled &quot;Tell The Boys&quot;, reached No.4 in the EP chart top 10. Shaw later recorded all five songs in Spanish, Italian, French and German. Eventually, all the various recordings of all five songs became available on various CD compilations.

== At Eurovision ==
After placing second five times, the United Kingdom finally won Eurovision ten years after its first entry in 1957. Harris himself would be the BBC&#x27;s commentator for the final in Vienna.

=== Voting ===
Every participating broadcaster assembled a jury panel of ten people. Every jury member could give one point to his or her favourite song.

<text>Carl Andreas Hilty (28 February 1833 – 12 October 1909) was a Swiss lawyer, professor of constitutional law, politician, philosopher, lay theologian and writer. 

== Life ==

=== Family background, education and early career ===

Hilty was born in the small town of Werdenberg in the canton of St. Gallen in northeastern Switzerland. His father was the physician Johann Ulrich Hilty, who practised medicine in Chur, the capital of the eastern canton of the Grisons. His family had been based in Werdenberg for centuries and in 1835 he bought the crumbling Werdenberg Castle at an auction. Carl Hilty&#x27;s mother Elisabeth (née Kilias) hailed from Chur and was the daughter of a former regimental doctor of the French Army. She died already in 1847.

Carl Hilty grew up in Chur, where he first attended the public primary school and then the canton school of the Swiss Reformed Church.

From 1851 until 1853 Hilty studied jurisprudence in Germany at the University of Göttingen. In 1854 he acquired his doctorate of both laws at Heidelberg University. He subsequently spent some time in London and Paris in order to improve his language skills. 

From 1855 onwards he was the director of a law firm in Chur for almost two decades. As a non-citizen of the Grisons he soon emerged as a prominent proponent of direct democracy. 

In 1857, after an engagement period of just a few months, Hilty married Johanna Gaertner, who hailed from a family of legal scholars in Prussia. Her father Gustav, who already died in 1842, was a professor of law at the University of Bonn. Her mother Marie Simon, who was born in Breslau as the daughter of a judge and one-time chairman of the Prussian examination board of jurists, had written and published a political novel about the German revolutions of 1848–1849. Like her brother Heinrich Simon, who had been a prominent member of the Frankfurt Parliament, she apparently had to escape anti-democratic and anti-liberal repressions in the reactionary era that followed the subdued revolutions and joined him in his Swiss exile. Johanna&#x27;s god-father was the nationalist and pro-democracy writer Ernst Moritz Arndt, who had been a member of the Frankfurt Parliament as well. 

Hilty&#x27;s sister Anna was married to the jurist and brigadier Hand Hold, one of the leading Grisonian liberals during the second half of the 19th century.

=== Public career in the Army, Academia, and Parliament ===
In 1862, Hilty joined the legal staff of the Swiss Armed Forces in addition to his work in his law firm.

In 1872, he also became a member of the Great City Council of Chur.

In 1874, he became a professor of constitutional law at the University of Bern.

Hilty was a spokesman for women&#x27;s rights to vote and to be elected, several decades before the subject became mainstream. Hilty argued that Switzerland, as a nation-state comprising several nationalities and languages, had a unique mission of demonstrating that a nation-state could transcend tribal tendencies.

In 1890, he became a member of the National Council.

=== «Happiness» and «Political Yearbooks» ===
From 1886, he edited &quot;Politisches Jahrbuch der schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft&quot; (The Journal of Swiss Jurisprudence)

Hilty&#x27;s philosophical concern was practical in nature. He wrote about happiness, the meaning of life and work, developing good habits, time management, and winning the battles of life. He became famous from his writings about happiness, which first appeared in three volumes in 1891, 1895 and 1899. These essays were eventually collected into a single volume entitled: &quot;Happiness: Essays on the Meaning of Life&quot;. In this work, Hilty combines ancient stoic thought with Christian beliefs. The work was translated into English by Prof. Francis Greenwood Peabody, Professor of Christian Morals at Harvard University, and first appeared in the United States in 1903. 

Hilty supported the Salvation Army, which opened their services in Zurich. At first he made jokes about their noisy appearance, but only a few years later, he recognized them as one of the few groups who were able to put the words of Jesus in practice. Hilty was in his time one of the few intellectuals who still believed in the Gospel, while many other intellectuals dedicated themselves to the so-called &quot;monastic&quot; philosophy following the new sciences after Darwin. He believed in a new reformation beyond the dogmas of churches and politics, after the time of materialism.

He famously said: &quot;Peace is only a hair&#x27;s breadth away from war.&quot; Although a Christian, he was not a pacifist, and expected the coming world war.

=== Final years ===
His wife Johanna died in 1897. Hilty died in Clarens in 1909.

== Legacy ==
Hilty&#x27;s work influenced the thinking of William James.

<doc id="295915" wikidata="Q5073444" url="?curid=295915" title="Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code">
<text>Title 11 of the United States Code sets forth the statutes governing the various types of relief for bankruptcy in the United States. Chapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code provides an individual with the opportunity to propose a plan of reorganization to reorganize their financial affairs while under the bankruptcy court&#x27;s protection. The purpose of chapter 13 is to enable an individual with a regular source of income to propose a chapter 13 plan that provides for their various classes of creditors. Under chapter 13, the Bankruptcy Court has the power to approve a chapter 13 plan without the approval of creditors as long as it meets the statutory requirements under chapter 13. Chapter 13 plans are usually three to five years in length and may not exceed five years. Chapter 13 is in contrast to the purpose of Chapter 7, which does not provide for a plan of reorganization, but provides for the discharge of certain debt and the liquidation of non-exempt property. A Chapter 13 plan may be looked at as a form of debt consolidation, but a Chapter 13 allows a person to achieve much more than simply consolidating his or her unsecured debt such as credit cards and personal loans. A chapter 13 plan may provide for the four general categories of debt: priority claims, secured claims, priority unsecured claims, and general unsecured claims. Chapter 13 plans are often used to cure arrearages on a mortgage, avoid &quot;underwater&quot; junior mortgages or other liens, pay back taxes over time, or partially repay general unsecured debt. In recent years, some bankruptcy courts have allowed Chapter 13 to be used as a platform to expedite a mortgage modification application.

==Choice of chapter==
An individual who is badly in debt can typically file for bankruptcy either under Chapter 7 (liquidation, or straight bankruptcy) or Chapter 13 (reorganization). In some cases, options may also include Chapter 12 (family farmer reorganization) and Chapter 11 (reorganization of a company, or an individual debtor whose debts exceed the limits for a Chapter 13 filing). As a Chapter 11 bankruptcy is considerably more complex and expensive than a Chapter 13 case, few debtors will choose Chapter 11 if a Chapter 13 bankruptcy is an option.

Debtors may also be forced into bankruptcy by creditors in the case of an involuntary bankruptcy, but only under Chapters 7 or 11. However, in most instances, the debtor may choose under which chapter to file. In the case of an involuntary bankruptcy, the debtor may also choose to convert from the forced Chapter 7 or 11 proceeding into a proceeding under another chapter.

The debtor&#x27;s financial characteristics and the type of relief sought play a tremendous role in the choice of chapters. In some cases, the debtor simply cannot file under Chapter 13, as he or she lacks the disposable income necessary to fund a viable Chapter 13 plan (see below). Furthermore, Section 109(e) of Title 11, United States Code sets forth debt limits for individuals to be eligible to file under Chapter 13: unsecured debts of less than $419,275, and secured debts of less than $1,257,850.

Under Chapter 13, the debtor proposes a plan to pay his or her creditors over a 3-to-5 year period. This written plan details all of the transactions (and their durations) that will occur, and repayment according to the plan must begin within 30 to 45 days after the case has started. During this period, his or her creditors cannot attempt to collect on the individual&#x27;s previously incurred debt except through the bankruptcy court. In general, the individual gets to keep their property, and his or her creditors end up with less money than they would have had the amount given to the debtor continued to collect interest, allowing the debtor to find a way to pay the amount owed without losing their assets.

===Disadvantages===
The disadvantage of filing for personal bankruptcy is that, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a record of this stays on the individual&#x27;s credit report for up to 7 years (up to 10 years for Chapter 7); still, it is possible to obtain new debt or credit (cards, auto, or consumer loans) after only 12–24 months, and a new FHA mortgage loan just 25 months after discharge, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans after 36 months. However, during the pendency of a Chapter 13 case, the debtor is not permitted to obtain additional credit without the permission of the bankruptcy court. Moreover, creditors may not even be willing to risk lending money to such an individual, regardless of their legal ability to make a request. However, this disadvantage is not unique to Chapter 13; it may also apply to individuals currently in a Chapter 11 or Chapter 12 case or those who are in (or have recently been in) a Chapter 7 case.

===Advantages===
The advantages of Chapter 13 over Chapter 7 include the ability to stop foreclosures although a foreclosure would be reinstated upon completion of the bankruptcy; achieve a &quot;super discharge&quot; of debts not dischargeable under Chapter 7; &quot;value collateral&quot;; bifurcate the security interest of creditors in certain property that creditors are either charging too much interest for, or are over-secured, or both, and leading to a &quot;cram down&quot; modification of the debt; and prevent collection activities against non-filing co-signers (&quot;co-debtors&quot;) during the life of the case.

==Chapter 13 plan==
A chapter 13 plan is a document filed with or shortly after a debtor&#x27;s Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition.

The plan details the treatment of debts, liens, and the secured status of assets and liabilities owned or owed by the debtor in regard to his bankruptcy petition. In order for a plan to take effect, it must meet a number of requirements. These are specified in § 1325 and include:
* providing that unsecured creditors will receive at least as much through the chapter 13 plan as they would in a chapter 7 liquidation
* either not be objected to, repay all creditors in full, or commit all of the debtor&#x27;s disposable income to the Chapter 13 plan for at least three years (or five years for a debtor who makes an above median income)

<doc id="295917" wikidata="Q2746792" url="?curid=295917" title="Noncommutative geometry">
<text>Noncommutative geometry (NCG) is a branch of mathematics concerned with a geometric approach to noncommutative algebras, and with the construction of &quot;spaces&quot; that are locally presented by noncommutative algebras of functions, possibly in some generalized sense. A noncommutative algebra is an associative algebra in which the multiplication is not commutative, that is, for which formula_1 does not always equal formula_2; or more generally an algebraic structure in which one of the principal binary operations is not commutative; one also allows additional structures, e.g. topology or norm, to be possibly carried by the noncommutative algebra of functions.

An approach giving deep insight about noncommutative spaces is through operator algebras, that is, algebras of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space. Perhaps one of the typical examples of a noncommutative space is the &quot;noncommutative torus&quot;, which played a key role in the early development of this field in 1980s and lead to noncommutative versions of vector bundles, connections, curvature, etc.

==Motivation==

The main motivation is to extend the commutative duality between spaces and functions to the noncommutative setting. In mathematics, &quot;spaces&quot;, which are geometric in nature, can be related to numerical functions on them. In general, such functions will form a commutative ring. For instance, one may take the ring &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) of continuous complex-valued functions on a topological space &quot;X&quot;. In many cases (&quot;e.g.&quot;, if &quot;X&quot; is a compact Hausdorff space), we can recover &quot;X&quot; from &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;), and therefore it makes some sense to say that &quot;X&quot; has &quot;commutative topology&quot;.

More specifically, in topology, compact Hausdorff topological spaces can be reconstructed from the Banach algebra of functions on the space (Gelfand–Naimark). In commutative algebraic geometry, algebraic schemes are locally prime spectra of commutative unital rings (A. Grothendieck), and every quasi-separated scheme formula_3 can be reconstructed up to isomorphism of schemes from the category of quasicoherent sheaves of formula_4-modules (P. Gabriel–A. Rosenberg). For Grothendieck topologies, the cohomological properties of a site are invariants of the corresponding category of sheaves of sets viewed abstractly as a topos (A. Grothendieck). In all these cases, a space is reconstructed from the algebra of functions or its categorified version—some category of sheaves on that space.

Functions on a topological space can be multiplied and added pointwise hence they form a commutative algebra; in fact these operations are local in the topology of the base space, hence the functions form a sheaf of commutative rings over the base space.

The dream of noncommutative geometry is to generalize this duality to the duality between noncommutative algebras, or sheaves of noncommutative algebras, or sheaf-like noncommutative algebraic or operator-algebraic structures, and geometric entities of certain kinds, and give an interaction between the algebraic and geometric description of those via this duality.

Regarding that the commutative rings correspond to usual affine schemes, and commutative C*-algebras to usual topological spaces, the extension to noncommutative rings and algebras requires non-trivial generalization of topological spaces as &quot;non-commutative spaces&quot;. For this reason there is some talk about non-commutative topology, though the term also has other meanings.

===Applications in mathematical physics===

There is an influence of physics on noncommutative geometry, on the other hand there is no application of noncommutative geometry in physics.

===Motivation from ergodic theory===
Some of the theory developed by Alain Connes to handle noncommutative geometry at a technical level has roots in older attempts, in particular in ergodic theory. The proposal of George Mackey to create a &quot;virtual subgroup&quot; theory, with respect to which ergodic group actions would become homogeneous spaces of an extended kind, has by now been subsumed.

==Noncommutative C*-algebras, von Neumann algebras==
The (formal) duals of non-commutative C*-algebras are often now called non-commutative spaces. This is by analogy with the Gelfand representation, which shows that commutative C*-algebras are dual to locally compact Hausdorff spaces. In general, one can associate to any C*-algebra &quot;S&quot; a topological space &quot;Ŝ&quot;; see spectrum of a C*-algebra.

For the duality between localizable measure spaces and commutative von Neumann algebras, noncommutative von Neumann algebras are called &quot;non-commutative measure spaces&quot;.

==Noncommutative differentiable manifolds==

A smooth Riemannian manifold &quot;M&quot; is a topological space with a lot of extra structure. From its algebra of continuous functions &quot;C&quot;(&quot;M&quot;), we only recover &quot;M&quot; topologically. The algebraic invariant that recovers the Riemannian structure is a spectral triple. It is constructed from a smooth vector bundle &quot;E&quot; over &quot;M&quot;, e.g. the exterior algebra bundle. The Hilbert space &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;M&quot;, &quot;E&quot;) of square integrable sections of &quot;E&quot; carries a representation of &quot;C&quot;(&quot;M)&quot; by multiplication operators, and we consider an unbounded operator &quot;D&quot; in &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;M&quot;, &quot;E&quot;) with compact resolvent (e.g. the signature operator), such that the commutators [&quot;D&quot;, &quot;f&quot;] are bounded whenever &quot;f&quot; is smooth. A deep theorem states that &quot;M&quot; as a Riemannian manifold can be recovered from this data.

This suggests that one might define a noncommutative Riemannian manifold as a spectral triple (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;D&quot;), consisting of a representation of a C*-algebra &quot;A&quot; on a Hilbert space &quot;H&quot;, together with an unbounded operator &quot;D&quot; on &quot;H&quot;, with compact resolvent, such that [&quot;D&quot;, &quot;a&quot;] is bounded for all &quot;a&quot; in some dense subalgebra of &quot;A&quot;. Research in spectral triples is very active, and many examples of noncommutative manifolds have been constructed.

==Noncommutative affine and projective schemes==
In analogy to the duality between affine schemes and commutative rings, we define a category of noncommutative affine schemes as the dual of the category of associative unital rings. There are certain analogues of Zariski topology in that context so that one can glue such affine schemes to more general objects.

There are also generalizations of the Cone and of the Proj of a commutative graded ring, mimicking a theorem of Serre on Proj. Namely the category of quasicoherent sheaves of O-modules on a Proj of a commutative graded algebra is equivalent to the category of graded modules over the ring localized on Serre&#x27;s subcategory of graded modules of finite length; there is also analogous theorem for coherent sheaves when the algebra is Noetherian. This theorem is extended as a definition of noncommutative projective geometry by Michael Artin and J. J. Zhang, who add also some general ring-theoretic conditions (e.g. Artin–Schelter regularity).

Many properties of projective schemes extend to this context. For example, there exists an analog of the celebrated Serre duality for noncommutative projective schemes of Artin and Zhang.

A. L. Rosenberg has created a rather general relative concept of noncommutative quasicompact scheme (over a base category), abstracting Grothendieck&#x27;s study of morphisms of schemes and covers in terms of categories of quasicoherent sheaves and flat localization functors. There is also another interesting approach via localization theory, due to Fred Van Oystaeyen, Luc Willaert and Alain Verschoren, where the main concept is that of a schematic algebra.

==Invariants for noncommutative spaces==

Some of the motivating questions of the theory are concerned with extending known topological invariants to formal duals of noncommutative (operator) algebras and other replacements and candidates for noncommutative spaces. One of the main starting points of Alain Connes&#x27; direction in noncommutative geometry is his discovery of a new homology theory associated to noncommutative associative algebras and noncommutative operator algebras, namely the cyclic homology and its relations to the algebraic K-theory (primarily via Connes–Chern character map).

The theory of characteristic classes of smooth manifolds has been extended to spectral triples, employing the tools of operator K-theory and cyclic cohomology. Several generalizations of now-classical index theorems allow for effective extraction of numerical invariants from spectral triples. The fundamental characteristic class in cyclic cohomology, the JLO cocycle, generalizes the classical Chern character.

==Examples of noncommutative spaces==
* In the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics, the symplectic phase space of classical mechanics is deformed into a non-commutative phase space generated by the position and momentum operators.
* The noncommutative torus, deformation of the function algebra of the ordinary torus, can be given the structure of a spectral triple. This class of examples has been studied intensively and still functions as a test case for more complicated situations.
* Snyder space
* Noncommutative algebras arising from foliations.
* Examples related to dynamical systems arising from number theory, such as the Gauss shift on continued fractions, give rise to noncommutative algebras that appear to have interesting noncommutative geometries.

== Connection ==

===In the sense of Connes ===

A Connes connection is a noncommutative generalization of a connection in differential geometry. It was introduced by Alain Connes, and was later generalized by Joachim Cuntz and Daniel Quillen.

==== Definition ====
Given a right &quot;A&quot;-module &quot;E&quot;, a Connes connection on &quot;E&quot; is a linear map
:formula_5
that satisfies the Leibniz rule formula_6.

<doc id="295926" wikidata="Q328755" url="?curid=295926" title="Hugh, Count of Vermandois">
<text>Hugh (1057 – October 18, 1101), called the Great (, ) was the first count of Vermandois from the House of Capet. He is known primarily for being one of the leaders of the First Crusade. His nickname &quot;Magnus&quot; (greater or elder) is probably a bad translation into medieval Latin of an Old French nickname, &quot;le Maisné&quot;, meaning &quot;the younger&quot;, referring to Hugh as younger brother of King Philip I of France.

==Early years==
Hugh was a younger son of King Henry I of France and Anne of Kiev and younger brother of Philip I. He became the first Capetian count of Vermandois after his mentally deficient brother-in-law, Odo, was disinherited. In 1085, Hugh helped William the Conqueror repel a Danish invasion of England.

==First Crusade==
In early 1096, Hugh and Philip began discussing the First Crusade after news of the Council of Clermont reached them in Paris. Although Philip could not participate, as he had been excommunicated, Hugh was said to have been influenced to join the Crusade after an eclipse of the moon on 11 February 1096. In late August 1096, Hugh and his Crusader army left France and travelled via the Alps and Rome to Bari, where he would cross the Adriatic Sea into territory of the Byzantine Empire, unlike most crusaders who travelled over land. 

His armada was possibly commanded by Arnout II, Count of Aarschot. According to Anna Comnena&#x27;s chronicle the &quot;Alexiad,&quot; Hugh sent a message (that she called absurd) to her father, Byzantine emperor Alexius I Comnenus, demanding a proper welcome:
In response to this message the emperor sent instructions to his nephew John Komnenos, the &quot;doux&quot; (governor) of Dyrrhachium, and Nicholas Maurokatakalon, commander of the Byzantine fleet, to look out for Hugh and to inform him immediately when he arrived. 

Meanwhile Hugh had reached the coast of Longobardi and dispatched twenty-four envoys to the &quot;Doux&quot; of Dyrrhachium with the following message: &quot;Be it known to you, &quot;Doux&quot;, that our Lord Hugh is almost here. He brings with him from Rome the golden standard of St Peter. Understand, moreover, that he is supreme commander of the Frankish army. See to it then that he is accorded a reception worthy of his rank and yourself prepare to meet him.&quot; Whilst sailing the Adriatic Sea from Bari towards Illyricum, Hugh&#x27;s fleet was overtaken by a heavy storm and most ships were lost. His own ship was thrown upon the shore near Epirus. When Hugh was found and brought to Dyrrhachium John Komnenos treated him to a banquet and he was allowed to rest. By order of the emperor Hugh was closely escorted by Manuel Boutoumites. Eventually Hugh was given an audience by the emperor, who persuaded him to become his liegeman. 

The German historian Hans Eberhard Mayer argued that Alexius was fortunate that the first contingent of the crusader army to arrive in Constantinople, led by Hugh, was very small and easy to control. Alexius &#x27;discreetly but unmistakably&#x27; restricted Hugh&#x27;s freedom of movement &#x27;until he was ready to swear that all territories which had belonged to Byzantium before the Turkish invasions would be restored. Moreover any conquests made to the east [...] would be held as fiefs.&#x27; 

Anna Comnena recorded a conversation between Hugh and Godfrey of Bouillon, wherein Hugh tried to persuade Godfrey to pledge allegiance to Alexius. Godfrey, however, refused, saying: &quot;you left your own country as a ruler [...] with all that wealth and a strong army; now from the heights you&#x27;ve brought yourself to the level of a slave. And then, as if you had won some great success, have you come here to tell me to do the same?&quot; Hugh replied: &quot;we ought to have stayed in our own countries and kept our hands off other people&#x27;s [...] but since we&#x27;ve come thus far and need the emperor&#x27;s protection, no good will come of it unless we obey his orders.&quot; 

After the Crusaders had successfully made their way across Seljuk territory and, in 1098, captured the city after siege of Antioch, Hugh was sent back to Constantinople to appeal for reinforcements from Alexius. The emperor was uninterested, however, and Hugh, instead of returning to Antioch to help plan the siege of Jerusalem, went back to France. There he was scorned for not having fulfilled his vow as a Crusader to complete a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and Pope Paschal II threatened to excommunicate him. He joined the subsequent Crusade of 1101, but was wounded in battle with the Turks led by Kilij Arslan at the second battle of Heraclea in September, and died of his wounds in October in Tarsus.

==Family==
Hugh married Adelaide of Vermandois, the daughter of Herbert IV, Count of Vermandois and Adele of Valois. The couple had the following nine children. 
*Matilda, who married Ralph I of Beaugency; 
*Elizabeth, Countess of Leicester (died 1138), married, firstly,  Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester and secondly, William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey
*Beatrice ( 1144), who married Hugh IV of Gournay
*Ralph I, Count of Vermandois (died 1152), married, firstly, Eleanor of Champagne and secondly, Petronille of Aquitaine
*Constance, who married Godfrey de la Ferté-Gaucher
*Agnes ( 1125), who married Boniface del Vasto
*Henry, Lord of Chaumont en Vexin (died 1130)
*Simon (died 1148)
*William (died 1096).

<doc id="295929" wikidata="Q57360" url="?curid=295929" title="Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani">
<text>Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa bin Hamad bin Abdullah bin Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani (; born 1 January 1952) is a member of the ruling Al Thani Qatari royal family. He was the ruling Emir of Qatar from 1995 until 2013 when he abdicated the throne, handing power to his fourth son Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani who was born to his second spouse, Moza bint Nassir. The Qatari government refers to him as the Father Emir.

Hamad seized power from his father, Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani, in a bloodless palace &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in 1995. During his 18-year rule, Qatar&#x27;s natural gas production reached 77 million tonnes, making Qatar the richest country in the world per capita with the average income in the country US$86,440 a year per person. During his reign, several sports and diplomatic events took place in Qatar, including the 2006 Asian Games, 2012 UN Climate Change Conference, Doha Agreement, Fatah–Hamas Doha Agreement, and it was decided that the 2022 FIFA World Cup would be held in the country. He established the Qatar Investment Authority. By 2013, it had invested over $100 billion around the world, most prominently in The Shard, Barclays Bank, Heathrow Airport, Harrods, Paris Saint-Germain F.C., Volkswagen, Siemens, and Royal Dutch Shell.

Hamad ruled a sovereign regime in Qatar without any support from opposition political parties. During Hamad&#x27;s rule, Qatar hosted two U.S. military bases. It also maintained relations with Iran. The Sheikh founded news media group Al Jazeera. He also played a part in negotiations between the U.S. and the Taliban. In June 2013, Hamad, in a brief televised address, announced that he would hand power to his fourth son, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.

==Early years and education==
Hamad was born in 1952. His mother died soon after his birth and he was raised by his uncle.

He graduated from the British Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst in 1971, and was then commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in Qatar&#x27;s armed forces. A few months later he returned to Qatar and was made commander of a mobile brigade, which later became a force called &quot;Hamad Brigade&quot;. In 1972, Hamad had the rank of general, and became army chief of staff. Next he was appointed commander-in-chief of Qatar&#x27;s armed forces with the rank of major general. In 1977 he was named minister of defense.

Hamad was appointed Heir Apparent of Qatar in 1977 and held the post until 1995. In the early 1980s, he led the Supreme Planning Council, which sets Qatar&#x27;s basic economic and social policies. Starting in 1992, Hamad&#x27;s father began gradually handing over responsibility for the day-to-day running of the country, including the development of Qatar&#x27;s oil and natural gas resources, rendering him the effective ruler of the country. However, his father ultimately retained control over state finances. On 27 June 1995, he won the throne from his father in a palace coup, Hamad became Emir of Qatar and was crowned on 20 June 2000.

== Reign as Emir (1995–2013) ==
With the support of his family, Hamad staged a bloodless coup d&#x27;état in 1995 when his father Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani was on vacation in Geneva, Switzerland, at which point he officially became the Emir of Qatar. The deposition came after a falling out between Hamad and his father, who had tried regaining some of the authority that he had bestowed upon Hamad in early 1995. Thereafter, his father lived in exile in France and Abu Dhabi until he returned to Qatar in 2001.

Hamad then engaged an American law firm to freeze his father&#x27;s bank accounts abroad in order to deter a possible countercoup. However, a counter-coup was attempted against Hamad in February 1996 under the leadership of former Economy Minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani. The coup failed, and several of Qatar&#x27;s traditional Arab allies were implicated in the plot, namely Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt.

In a break with the traditional role, his second wife Sheikha Moza bint Nasser Al-Missned has been a visible advocate for education and children&#x27;s causes. In 1995, Sheikh Hamad and his wife Sheikha Moza bint Nasser founded the Qatar Foundation.

A sportsman and an accomplished diver, Hamad has played an active role in promoting and developing athletics in Qatar. His activism has enhanced the country&#x27;s involvement and performance in a number of international competitions, including: winning an Olympic medal in track and field; hosting a wide variety of international sporting events such as the 15th Asian Games, GCC, Asian and World Youth soccer championships; and initiating the Qatar Open Tennis Championship which has grown to become one of two premier tennis competitions in the Middle East.

Under his rule the Qatari government helped to fund the Al Jazeera news network by an emiri decree. In an analysis of Al Jazeera, Hugh Miles said that diplomats from other countries know that the Emir was the real power behind Al Jazeera but he also quotes a network spokesman denying &#x27;countless times&#x27; this accusation, adding that many independent news sources also have subsidies from their respective governments without this implying editorial dabbling and explaining that trying to coerce the kind of journalists Al Jazeera has would be like trying to &#x27;herd cats&#x27;. Sheik Hamad is a distant cousin of the network chairman, Hamad bin Thamer Al Thani, who was previously Minister of Information in the Emir Al Thani government. Following the initial US$137 million grant from Emir Al Thani, Al Jazeera had aimed to become self-sufficient through advertising by 2001, but when this failed to occur, the Emir agreed to several consecutive loans on a year-by-year basis (US$30 million in 2004, according to Arnaud de Borchgrave). At a 3 October 2001 press conference, Colin Powell tried to persuade Sheik Hamad to shut down Al Jazeera while the New York-based organization Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting commented that in those efforts, &quot;Powell and other U.S. officials were reportedly upset by the channel re-airing old interviews with bin Laden and the inclusion of guests that are too critical of the United States on its programs.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported in 2005 that Sheik Hamad was under pressure to privatize the network.

In 2010, Qatar was awarded the right to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The country would become the first in the Middle East to host the world&#x27;s biggest sporting event, beating stiff competition from the United States and Australia.

=== Autocracy ===
Hamad ruled an autocratic regime in Qatar. There was no organized political opposition in Qatar. National news outlets exercised self-censorship.

=== Oil and gas wealth ===

Hamad was able to focus on turning Qatar from a small desert backwater into a major world power by continuing to exploit the country&#x27;s vast oil fields and discovering and tapping the world&#x27;s third largest gas reserves. By 2010 liquefied natural gas production had reached 77 million tons, making Qatar the richest country in the world. With fewer than two million inhabitants, the average income in the country shot to a staggering $86,440 per year per person. Qatar expert Olivier Da Lage said: &quot;When he came to power in 1995, Sheikh Hamad had a goal to place Qatar on the world map by exploiting the gas resources which his father did not develop for fear it would change the emirate&#x27;s society. Eighteen years on, he has finished the job – Qatar has acquired the financial clout to command respect from neighboring countries and Western governments alike&quot;.In 2005, under the direction of Hamad and the former prime minister of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, the Qatar Investment Authority was established, a sovereign wealth fund to manage the country&#x27;s oil and natural gas surpluses. The Qatar Investment Authority and its subsidiaries have acquired many businesses abroad, including London&#x27;s iconic department store Harrods from entrepreneur Mohammed Al-Fayed, Paris-based department store Printemps, French football club Paris Saint-Germain F.C., a former 10% stake in Porsche, a 75% stake in film studio Miramax Films which they acquired from Disney, a 2% stake in media conglomerate and Universal Music Group parent company Vivendi, a US$100 million investment in Chernin Group – whose founder Peter Chernin was COO of News Corp and President of Fox, a 1% stake in luxury goods manufacturer Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy, a 6% stake in Credit Suisse, a 12.6% stake in Barclays and several other major companies. They also backed Glencore&#x27;s $31 billion takeover bid for Xstrata. Qatar is the largest property owner in London with their holdings including the United Kingdom&#x27;s tallest building The Shard, the London Olympic Village and the InterContinental London Park Lane hotel. They also own several hotels in Cannes including the Majestic Hotel, Grand Hyatt Cannes Hôtel Martinez and the Carlton Hotel, Cannes. QIA was considered to have one of the leading bids in the sales of both Anschutz Entertainment Group and Hulu. As of May 2013, it was reported the Investment Authority was in talks to purchase Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman.

Media sources claimed that Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani made a bid for Manchester United on 11 February 2011. Qatari Holdings offered £1.65 billion to Malcolm Glazer, the American owner of the club. This follows a series of endeavors by the Emir and other Qataris into the World Football community, following Qatar&#x27;s successful bid for the 2022 World Cup, and the Qatar Foundation&#x27;s recent £125m shirt deal with FC Barcelona. In mid-June 2011, rumours resurfaced that Qatari Holdings were preparing a £2 Billion takeover bid and that the funding, that the club had been using for transfers since the start of June, was actually supplied by the Qataris and not the Glazer Family. In 2012 it was rumoured that Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani was in bid for Rangers F.C. On 30 March 2012 Sheik Al Thani offered to buy KF Tirana, although the details have yet to be published.

=== Culture and education ===
In the arts, Hamad established the Qatar Museums Authority in 2005 which built the I. M. Pei designed Museum of Islamic Art Doha. Since its opening, Qatar has become the world&#x27;s biggest contemporary art buyer, famously purchasing Cézanne&#x27;s &quot;The Card Players &quot;in 2012 for over US$250 million. The art acquisition efforts were often represented by Sheikh Saud bin Mohammed Al Thani, president of Qatar&#x27;s National Council for Culture, Arts and the Heritage.

The Museum Authority sponsored Takashi Murakami&#x27;s EGO exhibit in Doha which ran from 9 February to 24 June 2012, Damien Hirst&#x27;s retrospective at Tate Modern in Spring and Summer 2012 and Hirst&#x27;s exhibition Relics, from October 2013 to January 2014. In July 2013, in conjunction with Miuccia Prada and the Prada Foundation, QMA launched CURATE, a global search for curatorial talent. Additionally, the Doha Film Institute was established in 2009 which in partnership with the Tribeca Film Festival (founded by Robert De Niro), created the Doha Tribeca Film Festival that ran from 2009 – 2012. The Doha Film Institute is producing Salma Hayek&#x27;s upcoming animated adaptation of Khalil Gibran&#x27;s classic novel &quot;The Prophet&quot;, with &quot;Lion King&quot; director Roger Allers coordinating the process. DFI is also credited as a production company on several other films, including &quot;Just Like a Woman&quot; starring Sienna Miller, &quot;The Reluctant Fundamentalist&quot;, directed by Mira Nair, which opened the 69th Venice International Film Festival, and Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Cruel Summer&quot; – a short film which was shot in Doha and premiered during the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. In February 2013, they announced a $100 million feature film fund with Participant Media, a production company founded by billionaire Jeffrey Skoll, who was the first employee and also first president of internet auction firm eBay.

Under the patronage of Hamad and his wife Sheikha Moza Bint Nasser Al-Missned, various academic institutions have opened campuses in Doha, including Carnegie Mellon University, Georgetown University, Northwestern University, Texas A&amp;M University and Weill Cornell Medical College.

==Retirement and later life==

On 25 June 2013, Hamad handed over power to his son Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in a televised speech. In regards to the shift in power, Hamad said: &quot;The time has come to open a new page in the journey of our nation that would have a new generation carry the responsibilities&quot;.

Since his retirement, he is now popularly referred to as the Father Emir. His fourth son Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, from his second wife, Moza bint Nasser, is now the eighth and current Emir of Qatar.

Hamad is believed to have suffered from poor health for several years. In December 2015, he was flown to Zurich, Switzerland, for treatment after breaking his leg while on holiday in Morocco&#x27;s Atlas mountains.

Hamad underwent his first kidney transplant in 1997 and at least one more at a later date. The former emir is currently on dialysis.

==Foreign relations==
The Emir made a $100 million donation for the relief of New Orleans following the 2005 Hurricane Katrina. He was a key person in the cease fire during the 2006 Lebanon War and contributed significantly in the relief of damaged areas.

In 2012, the Emir proposed deploying Arab troops to reduce killings in the Syrian civil war. He provided two military bases for foreign troops, Al Udeid Air Base and Camp As Sayliyah.

Despite the prevalence of anti-Israel sentiment within the Arab world, he had previously maintained friendly relations with Israel. He met Foreign Minister of Israel Tzipi Livni (25 September 2007) in New York City. This marked the first real attempt by any leader in the Persian Gulf to pursue dialogue with Israel. However, Qatar severed diplomatic ties with Israel in 2009 in response to Israel&#x27;s actions during the Gaza War. The emir has also expressed his objection to Israeli settlement policy, especially the Judaization of Jerusalem.

===Palestine and Syria===
In October 2012, the Emir made a landmark visit to Gaza by being the first head of state to go there since the 2006 election of Hamas and the imposition of a blockade by Israel. He took a flight to Egypt before being driven into Gaza. While there, the emir was thought to be launching a $254 million reconstruction project in the territory, and giving an address to the Palestinian people. Palestine&#x27;s interior ministry was said to have a &quot;well-prepared plan&quot; to provide security for the emir during his stay. Incidents nevertheless continued.

In October 2012, Hamad made a historic visit to Gaza and pledged US$400 million in humanitarian aid to Hamas, to build infrastructure projects and hospitals. Despite Qatar&#x27;s ties to Hamas, they maintain diplomatic and business relations with Israel.

In December 2012, &quot;The New York Times&quot; accused the Qatari government of funding the Al-Nusra Front, a U.S. government designated terrorist organization. Others have noted the Emir&#x27;s visit to Gaza and meeting with Hamas, which houses a militant wing, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades. However, Qatar denies these allegations, stating that its policy is to help facilitate constructive engagement between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority.

In 2004, 2010, 2014, and 2017, the Qatari government introduced new anti-terror laws to combat terrorism, terrorism financing and related crimes. In 2019 the Qatari government introduced a new anti-money laundering and counter terror financing laws.

In August 2020, the US State Department sent the Coordinator for Counterterrorism Nathan Sales to Doha to thank Qatar for their efforts against terrorism and to discuss Qatar&#x27;s role in combating the financing of terrorism, its new Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism legislation and its participation in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.

==Investments==
In 2013, Hamad established the Qatar Investment Authority, which has invested over $100 billion around the world, most prominently in The Shard, Barclays Bank, Heathrow Airport, Harrods, Paris Saint-Germain F.C., Siemens and Royal Dutch Shell. It also holds about 17% stake in the Volkswagen Group, Porsche, Hochtief, as well as investments in Sainsbury&#x27;s.

Hamad is listed as owner of Afrodille S.A., which had a bank account in Luxembourg and shares in two South African companies. Al Thani also held a majority of the shares in Rienne S.A. and Yalis S.A., which held a term deposit with the Bank of China in Luxembourg. A relative owned 25% of these: Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani, Qatar&#x27;s former prime minister and foreign minister.
==Marriages and children==

<text>The Battle of Damme was fought on 30 and 31 May 1213 during the 1213–1214 Anglo-French War. An English fleet led by William Longespée, Earl of Salisbury accidentally encountered a large French fleet under the command of Savari de Mauléon in the vicinity of the port of Damme, in Flanders. The French crews were mostly ashore, pillaging the countryside, and the English captured 300 French ships at anchor, and looted and fired a further hundred beached ships. The main French army, commanded by King Philip II of France, was nearby besieging Ghent and it promptly marched on Damme. It arrived in time to relieve the town&#x27;s French garrison and drive off the English landing parties. Philip had the remainder of the French fleet burned to avoid capture. The success of the English raid yielded immense booty and ended the immediate threat of a French invasion of England. It is often considered the first great naval victory in English history.

==Background==
When King John of England () came to the throne he attempted to expand his territory, launching a campaign in Normandy in 1200. He was defeated by King Philip II of France () and had lost most of his overseas possessions by 1204. Subsequently, John repeatedly attempted to form alliances against Philip, with a view to recovering Normandy. In 1208 John&#x27;s nephew, Otto, became Holy Roman Emperor. Prior to his accession Otto had promised to help John recover his lost possessions. By 1212 both John and Otto were engaged in power struggles against Pope Innocent III. In John&#x27;s case his refusal to accept Innocent&#x27;s candidate for Archbishop of Canterbury had led to Innocent placing an interdict on England, prohibiting clergy from conducting religious services (with limited exceptions), in 1208 and excommunicating John personally in 1209. Philip decided to take advantage of this situation, first in Germany, where he aided a German noble rebellion. John immediately threw England&#x27;s weight behind Otto, and Philip saw an opportunity to launch an invasion of England. To secure the co-operation of all of his vassals in his plans for the invasion, Philip denounced John as an enemy of the Church, thereby justifying his attack as motivated by religious scruples. He summoned an assembly of French barons at Soissons, which was well attended with the exception of Ferdinand, Count of Flanders, who refused to attend. Philip was encouraged in all of this by the papal legate, Pandulf Verraccio.

Verraccio, however, was also holding secret discussions with John, who agreed to accept the legate&#x27;s decision in ecclesiastical disputes. In return, the Pope offered John the kingdom of England and the lordship of Ireland as papal fiefs, which John would rule as the Pope&#x27;s vassal, and for which John would do homage to the Pope. Once the treaty confirming this had been ratified in May 1213 Verraccio announced to Philip that he would have to abandon his expedition against John, since to attack a faithful vassal of the Holy See would constitute a mortal sin. He suggested that as Ferdinand had denied Philip&#x27;s right to declare war on England while John was still excommunicated, his disobedience needed to be punished. Philip accepted the advice, and marched with his army into the territory of Flanders. It is possible that Philip saw this as a preliminary to an invasion of England. John declared support for Ferdinand, starting the Anglo-French War of 1213–1214.

==Prelude==
At the time, galleys were used as purpose-built warships. They had long been used by the Mediterranean powers and had been adapted by the northern countries for use in the English Channel. Galleys could penetrate shallow harbours and were highly manoeuvrable, making them effective for raiding and ship-to-ship combat in meeting engagements. Operating the galleys was a specialist activity and called for highly trained crews. Both the English and the French relied on requisitioning cogs, the merchant vessels of the time, to supplement their navies. Cogs had a deep draught, a round hull and were propelled by a single large sail set on a mast amidships. Cogs were used as transports and could be converted into warships by the addition of wooden castlesraised fighting platformsat the bow and stern and the erection of crow&#x27;s nest fighting platforms at the masthead. Cogs typically had a displacement of . Their high freeboard made them superior to the oared vessels in close combat, particularly when they were fitted with the castles, from which missiles could be fired or stones dropped on to enemy craft alongside.

Contemporary chronicler William the Breton, the royal chaplain, who was in the French camp at the time, reported the French fleet as numbering some 1,700 ships. This number is considered improbably high by modern historians, who simply describe both fleets as &quot;large&quot;. F. W. Brooks describes the figure of 1,700 ships for the French as &quot;hopelessly exaggerated&quot; and suggests that the actual size was less than 500, but of unknown breakdown between fighting ships and transports. Better figures are available for the English. In 1206 fifty galleys were recorded in royal service, operating in four squadrons. In 1211 there is a record of a fleet of over fifty ships, including twenty galleys. Building and maintaining fleets of this size was extremely expensive. In 1212 the fleet was costing over £3,500 per year; perhaps a quarter of the total royal revenue. For the 1213 campaign John attempted to requisition every English merchant ship capable of carrying six or more horses. 19th century historian Smedley estimates the English fleet at 500 ships; 20th century historian Brooks that it was &quot;much inferior in point of numbers to the French fleet&quot;.

==Battle==
The French fleet, originally assembled to carry troops to invade England, instead operated in a supporting role. It assembled at Boulogne, where Savari de Mauléon, a French minor noble who had served John for the previous eight years, was appointed its commander. Heavily laden with supplies, largely wine and bacon, the army&#x27;s pay chests, and the personal goods of the French barons, it proceeded to Gravelines and then to the port of Damme, &quot;among the most important commercial ports of Europe&quot;. Damme is located on the estuary of the Zwyn, now largely silted up. At the time it was in the County of Flanders (now in Belgium) and was the port of the city of Bruges. Meanwhile, the army marched via Cassel, Ypres, and Bruges before laying siege to Ghent. In England John had assembled his own fleet, which he sent to Flanders, under the command of William Longespée, Earl of Salisbury, to support his ally, Ferdinand, Count of Flanders, on 28 May 1213.

The English ships were carrying 700 English and Flemish men-at-arms and their attendants, and a large force of mercenaries. They entered the estuary of the Zwyn on 30 May, where they unexpectedly found the French armada. Most of the ships were pulled up on the beach. The French army was besieging Ghent, and many of the crews were pillaging the surrounding area. The English were surprised to discover the French fleet, at first believing them to be their Flemish allies. After scouting the roadstead to confirm the nationality and size of the fleet and discovering that the French ships were almost unmanned they attacked. They seized the 300 ships which were anchored and killed their crews. A further 100 ships were looted and then burnt on the beach after their crews had fled. The next day they attacked the rest of the ships and attempted an assault on Damme, which was repulsed. English and French chroniclers of the time all agree that the French lost approximately 400 ships.

The Flemish forces which had accompanied the English now disembarked and reconnoitered Damme. Finding it strongly garrisoned they bypassed it and advanced on Bruges. When Philip heard the news of the disaster behind him he broke off the siege of Ghent and marched for Damme. Part of his army encountered the Flemish army near Bruges and drove them off. His army reached Damme on 2 June, in time to relieve the French garrison. There, Philip found that groups of English ships were looting and capturing or firing his remaining ships almost at will. He was furious at the performance of the fleet. He suspected the loyalty of the crews, who were almost all from Poitiers or Normandy, until recently English possessions; and the loyalty of their commander, who until recently had led troops for the English. He had the surviving ships burned to prevent them from falling into English hands, and ordered the town of Damme to be burned as well. Determined to make the Flemish pay for his retreat, Phillip ordered that all towns be razed in every district he passed through, and that the peasantry be either killed or taken prisoner and sold as slaves. He extracted 30,000 marks from the Flemish cities he had captured as a ransom for the release of the hostages he had taken.

==Aftermath==
The English fleet returned to England with the seized ships and a large booty; a contemporary writer claimed &quot;never had so much treasure come into England since the days of King Arthur&quot;. The success at Damme dashed any French hopes of invading England that year and severely strained their resources, but did little to affect their army or its operations. Nevertheless, John began preparing for an invasion of France and a reconquest of his lost provinces. The English barons were initially unenthusiastic about the expedition, which delayed his departure, so it was not until February 1214 that he landed in France. John was to advance from the Loire, while his ally Otto made a simultaneous attack from Flanders, together with Ferdinand. John retook the county of Anjou, but was forced back after losing the Siege of Roche-au-Moine to Philip&#x27;s son, Louis, on 2 July. Shortly after, Philip decisively defeated Otto and Ferdinand&#x27;s army, which had assembled in the Low Countries, at the Battle of Bouvines. This ended John&#x27;s hopes of regaining his continental lands.

De Mauléon returned to English service and in 1216 was appointed by John to the council of regency which governed England in the name of the new nine-year-old king, Henry III.

<doc id="295964" wikidata="Q1570201" url="?curid=295964" title="Jacquetta Hawkes">
<text>Jacquetta Hawkes (5 August 1910 – 18 March 1996) was an English archaeologist and writer. She was the first woman to study the Archaeology &amp; Anthropology degree course at the University of Cambridge. A specialist in prehistoric archaeology, she excavated Neanderthal remains at the Palaeolithic site of Mount Carmel with Yusra and Dorothy Garrod. She was a representative for the UK at UNESCO, and was curator of the &quot;People of Britain&quot; pavilion at the Festival of Britain.

Widely recognised for her book &quot;A Land&quot; (1951), she wrote widely on archaeology, fusing a literary style of writing with a deep knowledge of landscape and past human lives, as well as using film and radio to enable archaeology to reach new audiences. In 1953 she married J. B. Priestley, with whom she authored several works. She was co-founder of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and an active campaigner in the Homosexual Law Reform Society. In 1967 she published &quot;Dawn of the Gods&quot;, a &quot;feminine&quot; interpretation of the Minoan civilisation. In 1971, the Council for British Archaeology rewarded her advocacy for the discipline with the role of vice-president.

== Early life and education ==
Born Jessie Jacquetta Hopkins, on 5 August 1910 in Cambridge, she was the youngest child of Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins (1861–1947), biochemist and Nobel Prize winner, and his wife Jessie Ann (1869–1956), daughter of Edward William Stevens, ship&#x27;s fitter, of Ramsgate. She had one brother and one sister. Her father was a cousin of the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. Her parents met at Guy&#x27;s Hospital, where they both worked. Interested in archaeology from a young age, she made her first investigations aged nine when she found out her home was on the site of an early medieval cemetery, sneaking out of the house at night to dig in the garden.

From 1921 to 1928 she attended Perse School for Girls, going on in 1929 to study the new degree of Archaeology &amp; Anthropology at the University of Cambridge, where she was the first woman to do so. In her second year at university she took part in the excavation of a Roman site near Colchester, and there met her future first husband, the archaeologist Christopher Hawkes (1905–1992). She graduated with a first-class honours degree from Newnham College.

== Early career ==
After her graduation, in 1932, she travelled to Palestine and joined the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem, in order to excavate on Mount Carmel, alongside Yusra and Dorothy Garrod. There she supervised the excavation of a Neanderthal skeleton. On her return from Palestine, she married Christopher Hawkes on 7 October 1933 at Trinity College, Cambridge, when she was aged 22.

In 1934 she had published her first article &quot;Aspects of the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods in western Europe&quot; in &quot;Antiquity&quot;. The same year, she visited a seven-year-old David Attenborough&#x27;s &quot;museum&quot; of fossils and geology, donating specimens to it. In 1935 she led a BBC Radio programme &quot;Ancient Britain Out of Doors&quot;, introducing key ideas about archaeology then discussing them with colleagues Stuart Piggott and Nowell Myres. In 1937 her only child, Nicholas, was born.

In 1938 Hawkes&#x27; first book, &quot;The Archaeology of Jersey&quot;, was published – it was the second work in a series on the archaeology of the Channel Islands that had been begun by Tom Kendrick. As a result of the academic success of the monograph, she was elected as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In 1939 she travelled to Ireland to supervise the excavation of Harristown Passage Tomb, near Waterford. The excavation was funded by the Office of Public Works Employment Relief Scheme.

== World War II ==
Hawkes and her son moved to Dorset early in the war, when Britain was facing the threat of invasion. In her memoir &quot;A Quest of Love&quot;, Hawkes described how, while in Dorset, her &quot;violent emotional involvement with a woman&quot; was &quot;a sudden undamning of feelings of an intensity that I did not know I possessed&quot;. Her biographer, Christine Finn, characterised this affair as leaving Hawkes &quot;emotionally confused&quot;. The writer Robert Macfarlane described Hawkes as &quot;bisexual through much of the 1930s&quot;.

During the latter half of the Blitz Hawkes returned to London and began work in the civil service. To begin with she was involved with moving items from the British Museum to Aldwych tube station for safe-keeping. She began work in 1941 as Assistant Principal of the Post-War Reconstruction Secretariat. Her next post, begun in 1943 and one she held until 1949, was in the Ministry of Education, where she became Secretary of the UK National Committee for UNESCO. In her work in the Ministry of Education she was editor-in-chief of the film unit, where she commissioned and produced &quot;The Beginning of History&quot; – an early attempt to present prehistory on film.

Whilst working for the government she continued to publish, including &quot;Prehistoric Britain&quot; (1944, co-authored with her then husband, Christopher Hawkes), and &quot;Early Britain&quot; (1945). &quot;Prehistoric Britain&quot; was used by many students in the 1940s and 1950s and underwent several editions and reprints.

During the war she met the poet Walter J. Turner, with whom she had an extra-marital affair. Turner died of a brain haemorrhage in 1946 and Hawkes was grief-stricken. Inspired by Turner&#x27;s writing and their love, she published her only poetry collection &quot;Symbols and Speculations&quot; in 1948. It recalled, through poetry, both mystical and physical experiences in her archaeological career.

During her time as Secretary, a major task was the preparations for UNESCO&#x27;s first conference, which was held in Mexico City in 1947. One of the UK representatives was her future husband, J. B. Priestley, although Hawkes initially opposed his inclusion. However, at the conference Hawkes and Priestley fell in love. Priestley famously described Hawkes&#x27; demeanour as &quot;Ice without! Fire within!&quot;

== Festival of Britain ==

In 1949 Hawkes left the civil service, in order to work full-time as a writer. She was interested in communicating archaeology and art in new ways to new audiences, including through writing creatively and through film. In 1950 the British Film Institute made her a governor. Writing with empathy, in what became termed the &#x27;archaeological imagination&#x27;, was central to her practice. One of her first creative projects was as archaeological advisor to the Festival of Britain in 1951, where she produced the &#x27;People of Britain&#x27; pavilion. The pavilion&#x27;s architect was H. T. Cadbury Brown and it was designed by James Gardner. The vision of the pavilion created by Hawkes showed archaeological sites as if they were being discovered for the first time, proceeding chronologically from a prehistoric burial, to a Bronze Age gold necklace, to a Roman mosaic floor. After the Roman section, visitors met a recreation of the Sutton Hoo ship burial.

== &quot;A Land&quot; (1951) ==
Published one month after the opening of the Festival of Britain, and perhaps Hawkes&#x27; most widely recognised work, &quot;A Land&quot; (1951) characterised the archaeology of Britain, and thus the story of Britishness, as one of repeated waves of migration. The book was illustrated by Henry Moore. Reviewed on its publication in &quot;The Journal of Geology&quot; as &quot;literary expression... rather than scientific description&quot;, even Hawkes was aware that it was a difficult book to classify. Nevertheless, a review by Harold Nicolson helped to boost its popularity where he described &quot;the weird beauty in this prophetic book... it is written with a passion of love and hate&quot;. Described by geographer Hayden Lorimer, in 2012, as &quot;an unconventional geological history&quot;, it was a bestseller in the UK and was described in the same year, by Robert Macfarlane, as &quot;one of the defining British non-fiction books of the postwar decade&quot;.

In 1952 Hawkes was awarded an OBE.

== Marriage to J. B. Priestley ==

Jacquetta and Christopher Hawkes divorced in 1953; she married Priestley the same year. They lived on the Isle of Wight, before moving to Alveston, Warwickshire, in 1960. During their marriage, they collaborated on a number of experimental literary works, including the play &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Mouth,&quot; and an epistolary work entitled &quot;Journey Down a Rainbow&quot;, based on imagined letters. Priestley&#x27;s letters in the work were set in a &quot;brash new America in Texas&quot;, whilst Hawkes&#x27; were written from the perspectives of indigenous societies in New Mexico.

== Research in the 1950s ==
The script for the 1953 film &quot;Figures in a Landscape&quot;, a documentary about the work of Barbara Hepworth, was written by Hawkes. In 1956 she began excavations on the Mottistone Estate, whose land adjoined her and Priestley&#x27;s home of Brook Hill House. The subject of Hawkes&#x27; investigation was The Longstone; her research, which was published in &quot;Antiquity,&quot; demonstrated that it was the remains of the entrance to a Neolithic long barrow.

== Activism ==
=== Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ===
Politically engaged, in late 1957 and early 1958 she and Priestley were part of a group of co-founders of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). CND officially launched at Central Hall, Westminster, on 17 February 1958. Its institutional origins have been described as an &quot;elite pressure group&quot;, established as a &quot;gathering&quot; between peers, such as Bertrand Russell, George Kennan, Denis Healey and other public figures, who all knew each other. Hawkes organised an influential meeting early on at Sandown Pavilion, which promoted CND on the Isle of Wight. A member of the executive committee, Hawkes was active at the first Aldermaston March held on 4–7 April 1958. In 1959 she led a march of over 15,000 people to Downing Street where she presented a &quot;Ban the Bomb&quot; charter. Despite this Hawkes characterised the work of CND as a &quot;moral crusade&quot; rather than a political one. She also founded the Women&#x27;s Committee of CND.

=== Homosexual Law Reform Society ===
Hawkes was active in campaigning for the decriminalisation of gay sex through the Homosexual Law Reform Society (HLRS), of which she was a founding member. Its establishment was announced by a letter in &quot;The Times&quot;. Committee meetings were held at her and Priestley&#x27;s flat – B4 Albany – which led to its use as the name for the Albany Trust. The trust was founded in 1958 to support the charitable work of the HLRS and Hawkes was a trustee along with Anthony Edward Dyson, Kenneth Walker, Andrew Hallidie Smith and Ambrose Appelbe. The group, all &quot;ostensibly heterosexual&quot; according to David Minto, aimed to challenge societal attitudes to homosexuality through &quot;objectivity&quot;.

=== Campaign for the Preservation of Rural England ===
After Hawkes and Priestley moved to Alveston, Warwickshire, in the early 1960s, she became President of the Warwickshire branch of the Campaign for the Preservation of Rural England and a trustee of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.

==Archaeological work in the 1960s==
Her archaeological research continued, co-editing with Leonard Woolley UNESCO&#x27;s book on prehistory entitled &quot;History of Mankind,&quot; which was published in 1963. Hawkes was responsible for writing the sections on the palaeolithic and neolithic, whereas Woolley&#x27;s approach renounced the global and he wrote on the Bronze Age in the area that was then termed &quot;the fertile crescent&quot;. Reviewed by Dutch archaeologist Sigfried J. De Laet, Hawkes&#x27; writing style was praised as was her emphasis on a &quot;global&quot; prehistory; however some of the factual information she included was accused of being out of date.

In 1968 she published &quot;Dawn of the Gods&quot;, which examined Minoan civilisation, and argued that it was a &quot;feminine&quot; society. Hawkes was one of the archaeologists who first proposed that women were the rulers of the ancient Minoans; the idea had been discussed previously by historians of culture and religion, such as Joseph Campbell, and it had also been discussed as part of feminist discourse. She used evidence from art to argue that the society was matriarchal: &quot;the absence of these manifestations of the all-powerful male ruler that are so widespread at this time and in this stage of cultural development as to be almost universal, is one of the reasons for supposing that the occupants of Minoan thrones may have been queens&quot;. Reviewed by Frank Stubbings, he praised the book, describing how &quot;the writer remembers always that these were real human beings&quot;; however, he also had several caveats – some on questions of dating, but most of all on account of the poetic language used by Hawkes. Archaeologist Nicoletta Momigliano has placed Hawkes&#x27; &quot;Dawn of the Gods&quot; as part of a canon of 1960s &quot;pacifist and hippie interpretations&quot; that were influenced by Jungian psychology.

Also in 1968, Hawkes published a paper in &quot;Antiquity&quot; entitled &quot;The Proper Study of Mankind&quot;. In it, she argued against an over-emphasis on science in archaeological discourse. The paper was widely debated, with archaeologist D. P. Agrawal suggesting in 1970 that her article was the &quot;protests of a passing generation&quot; and that it contributed to polemicisation of the field. In 1973, James Feibleman challenged her interpretation of archaeological science as reductionist.

== Later life ==
In 1971, Hawkes was elected vice-president of the Council for British Archaeology in recognition of her life&#x27;s work. In 1980 she published &quot;A Quest of Love&quot;, a creative memoir of her romantic and sexual life, where she imagined herself as different women across time, from a Palaeolithic shaman called Jakka to a Victorian governess. It was described by the &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Katha Pollitt as &quot;antifeminist&quot;, a &quot;humourless rambling document&quot; and a &quot;masochistic fantasia of the unconscious&quot;. John Sutherland in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; praised the &quot;candour&quot; of the final section, which discussed her marriages, but was negative overall. However, in a 2018 reappraisal of the work, literary theorist Ina Habermann described it as a &quot;visionary autobiography&quot; and an &quot;overlooked exercise in &quot;écriture feminine&quot;&quot;.

In 1982 she published a biography of Mortimer Wheeler. Reviewed by F. H. Thompson in &quot;Antiquity&quot;, the biography was criticised for its over-emphasis on, and criticism of, Wheeler&#x27;s sex life.

Priestley died in 1984. After his death Hawkes moved to Chipping Camden and continued her interests in archaeology and science, particularly ornithology. Her last publication, &quot;The Shell Guide to British Archaeology&quot;, was co-written with archaeologist Paul Bahn and published in 1986. Noted for her striking looks, she was the subject of the work of several photographers during her lifetime, including Lord Snowdon, Bern Schwartz, Mark Gerson, J. S. Lewinski and Tara Heinemann.

== Death and legacy ==

Hawkes died in Cheltenham on 18 March 1996. Cremated, her ashes are interred with Priestley&#x27;s at an unknown location in the churchyard of the Church of St Michael and All Angels, Hubberholme in North Yorkshire. However, their presence there is commemorated with a plaque on the church.

Whilst Hawkes&#x27; views and writing may have been too &quot;poetic&quot; for the archaeological establishment, particularly in the context of processual archaeology&#x27;s popularity in the later mid-twentieth century, in the twenty-first century her writing found new audiences, with a re-issue of &quot;A Land&quot; in 2012 with a new foreword by nature writer and academic Robert Macfarlane. Hawkes&#x27; artistic, poetic and humanitarian approach to archaeology has been termed &quot;creative archaeology&quot; by biographer Christine Finn.

<text>The Norwegian Institute of Technology (Norwegian: &quot;Norges tekniske høgskole&quot;, NTH) was a science institute in Trondheim, Norway. It was established in 1910, and existed as an independent technical university for 58 years, after which it was merged into the University of Trondheim as an independent college.

In 1996 NTH ceased to exist as an organizational superstructure when the university was restructured and rebranded. The former NTH departments are now basic building blocks of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

NTH was primarily a polytechnic institute, educating master level engineers as well as architects. In 1992 NTH had 7627 master and doctoral students and 1591 employees; it graduated 1262 chartered engineers (master level), 52 chartered architects, and 92 Dr.Ing. (PhD). The operating budget was equivalent to US$100M, and the total premises amounted to around 260,000 m2 (64 acres).

Since the merger, it forms a part of the university campus commonly known as Gløshaugen, from the geographical area in which it is situated.

==History==

The decision to establish a Norwegian national college of technology was made by the Norwegian parliament, the Storting, in 1900, after years of heated debate on where the institution should be located; many representatives felt that the capital Kristiania (now Oslo) was self-evident as the place for this nationally important seat of learning. However, eventually &quot;Den Tekniske Høgskole&quot; was located in the geographically central city of Trondheim, based on an emerging policy of decentralisation as well as the city&#x27;s existing and highly esteemed technical college, &quot;Trondhjems Tekniske Læreanstalt&quot;.

Hovedbygningen, the building of Norges tekniske høgskole was designed by architect Bredo Greve. It was built of granite block construction in the National Romantic style of architecture.

Five academical departments were originally present in the parliament&#x27;s resolution of 31 May 1900:
* Architecture and city planning
* Civil engineering
* Mechanical engineering (a. General and b. Naval, i.e. ship and ship engine construction)
* Electrical engineering
* Chemistry (a. General and b. Electro-chemistry)

<doc id="295971" wikidata="Q541128" url="?curid=295971" title="Wolframite">
<text>Wolframite is an iron, manganese, and tungstate mineral with a chemical formula of that is the intermediate mineral between ferberite ( rich) and hübnerite ( rich). Along with scheelite, the wolframite series are the most important tungsten ore minerals. Wolframite is found in quartz veins and pegmatites associated with granitic intrusives. Associated minerals include cassiterite, scheelite, bismuth, quartz, pyrite, galena, sphalerite, and arsenopyrite.

This mineral was historically found in Europe in Bohemia, Saxony, and in the UK in Devon and Cornwall. China reportedly has the world&#x27;s largest supply of tungsten ore with about 60%. Other producers are Spain, Canada, Portugal, Russia, Australia, Thailand, South Korea, Rwanda, Bolivia, the United States, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

== Properties ==
The wolframite series is mainly formed through magmatic-hydrothermal processes associated with felsic magmas, namely skarns, or through metamorphic processes. In the more common granitic deposits, wolframite minerals can be found in both greisen and veins as its formation is tied to these two structures.

=== Crystal structure ===

The wolframite series consists of two endmembers, ferberite (Fe2+ end member), hübnerite (Mn2+ end member), with Wolframite, (Fe,Mn)WO4 itself being a solid solution between the two endmembers. These two end members can be present in any proportion within wolframite, from 100% ferberite to 100% hübnerite. Wolframite Contains the following percentages of its components, 60.63% W+6, 9.21% Fe+2, 9.06% Mn+2, 21.10% O−2. Wolframite ore exhibits massive form with a dark grey to reddish black coloration. Wolframite in its pure crystal form exhibits a monoclinic crystal system with a perfect cleavage of {010} and an iron black color. Wolframite in its crystalline form also displays lamellar and prismatic habit.

==Name==
The name &quot;wolframite&quot; is derived from German &quot;&quot;wolf rahm&quot;, the name given to tungsten by Johan Gottschalk Wallerius in 1747. This, in turn, derives from &quot;Lupi spuma&quot;&quot;, the name Georg Agricola used for the element in 1546, which translates into English as &quot;wolf&#x27;s froth&quot; or &quot;wolf&#x27;s cream&quot;. The etymology is not entirely certain but seems to be a reference to the large amounts of tin consumed by the mineral during its extraction, the phenomenon being likened to a wolf eating a sheep. Wolfram is the basis for the chemical symbol &quot;W&quot; for tungsten as a chemical element.

==World mine production and reserves==
As of 2022, estimated world mine production was 84,000 metric tons of tungsten. The foremost producer of tungsten is China, with an estimated 71,000 metric tons produced; as such world tungsten supply is dominated by China and Chinese exports. The next highest producers are Vietnam, Russia, Bolivia, and Rwanda with an estimated 4,800, 2,300, 1,400, and 1,100 respectively.

As of 2022, the estimate world reserves of tungsten is 3,800,000 metric tons. Again China contains the greatest reserve at 1,800,000 metric tons of tungsten. The following countries have the next highest reserves: Russia, Vietnam, Spain, and Austria, with an estimated reserve of 400,000, 100,000, 56,000, and 10,000 respectively.

==Use==

Wolframite is highly valued as the main source of the metal tungsten, a strong and very dense material with a high melting temperature used for electric filaments and armor-piercing ammunition, as well as hard tungsten carbide machine tools. During World War II, wolframite mines were a strategic asset, due to its use in munitions and tools.

Tungsten salts were used in the 19th century to dye cotton and to make stage costumes which were fire retardant. Additionally in the 19th century tungsten sulfides were sparingly used as lubrication for machining. Wolframite is also used to make tungstic acid which is used in the textile industry.

A major modern day use of tungsten is as a catalyst for various chemical reactions. One such catalytic use of tungsten is as a hydrocracking catalyst which is used to improve the yield of organic components such as gasoline in hydrocarbon refinement as well as reducing harmful pollution and by products. Another catalytic use of tungsten is as a De-NOX catalyst which is used in the treatment of nitrogen oxide emissions to convert harmful nitrogen oxides into inert N2 gas.

Another modern day use of tungsten is as a lubricant. Tungsten disulfide (WS2) is a lubricant with a dynamic coefficient of friction of ~0.03. Tungsten disulfide can be used at temperatures of 583 °C and 1316 °C in air and vacuum respectively. These characteristics allow this lubricant to operate in extreme conditions.

Wolframite was considered to be a conflict mineral due to the unethical mining practices observed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, during the Congo Wars.

<doc id="295972" wikidata="Q7785228" url="?curid=295972" title="Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould">
<text>Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould is a 1993 Canadian biographical anthology film about the pianist Glenn Gould, played by Colm Feore. It was directed by François Girard, with a screenplay by Girard and Don McKellar.

The film is presented as a series of 31 short films rather than as one narrative. Segments include documentaries, consisting of interviews with individuals who knew the real Gould, and reenactments of episodes in Gould&#x27;s life. &quot;Gould Meets McLaren&quot; employs animated spheres from Norman McLaren&#x27;s filmography. The film received positive reviews and won four Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture.

==Plot==
With memories revolving around the family&#x27;s cottage near Lake Simcoe, Glenn Gould recalls how in his childhood, he had ostensibly made the decision to become a concert pianist at age five. In fact, he believes his mother had already chosen that career for him. He recalls being able to read music before he could read books, and learned the music of Johann Sebastian Bach from his mother. Gould later imagines interviewing himself, in which he confronts himself about why he chose to quit giving concerts at the age of 32, preferring to communicate to his audience through media instead. Gould reminds himself that the musician is inescapably an autocrat, no matter how benign.

In crafting radio documentaries, Gould works on a piece called &quot;The Idea of North&quot;, which touches on the effects the environment has on the solitude and isolation of the people of Northern Canada. In a media interview, Gould reveals that &quot;The Idea of North&quot; is one of only five of his documentaries about isolation, and that he intends to make a comedy next because he is tired of serious expression. Interviewers also push him to explain how he could achieve his level of musical perfection without interest in being overly technical in his piano playing. They ask why he insists on being interviewed only over the telephone. Others question if Gould&#x27;s supposed obsession in technology is merely a smokescreen to keep his distance from real people.

As the markets plummet, Gould picks up word from the bodyguard of the visiting Sheik Yamani to invest in an obscure company called Sotex Resources, which is set to benefit from an exploration contract. Gould becomes the only client to profit in the wake of financial meltdown. However, Margaret Pacsu, a friend, notices Gould&#x27;s bathroom is stocked heavily with various pills, including Valium, Trifluoperazine and Librax. Gould laughs off the idea that he is taking all of the pills simultaneously, and Pacsu does not notice any effects on his personality. As his birthday approaches, Gould becomes concerned that no one will attend his funeral, despite being aware of strong record sales in Central Europe and Japan. Gould dies at age 50 of a stroke. His cousin, Jessie Greig, says Gould was wrong and his funeral was heavily attended. He had noted that Voyager I and Voyager II, space probes launched for possible contact with extraterrestrial intelligence, contain Bach&#x27;s music as played by Gould.

===Development===

Rhombus Media was established in 1979 with the goal to make a film about pianist Glenn Gould, who was still alive at the time. Producer Niv Fichman explained, &quot;He was our greatest hero. So we thought we would have to make a few short films before we approached Gould to make one about him&quot;. After Gould died in 1982, director François Girard mentioned the idea of making a biopic of the pianist in 1990, reviving Fichman&#x27;s plans.
Wishing to have an English Canadian screenwriter, Fichman and Girard proposed the idea to Don McKellar, who had a musical education. McKellar was initially opposed to the idea of adapting Gould&#x27;s life into a film, calling it &quot;an undramatic life&quot;. However, Girard&#x27;s concept of 32 &quot;short films&quot; intrigued him. McKellar claimed to write the humorous aspects of the screenplay, while Girard was responsible for the trivia. Girard opted to model the screenplay after Bach&#x27;s &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;, which Gould had performed.

Girard found writing challenging, saying, &quot;As Gould was such a complex character, the biggest problem was to find a way to look at his work and deal with his visions. The film is built of fragments, each one trying to capture an aspect of Gould. There is no way of putting Gould in one box. The film gives the viewer 32 impressions of him. I didn&#x27;t want to reduce him to one dimension.&quot; The fact that the concept allowed for 32 segments led to the combination of documentary, fictional and &quot;abstract&quot; scenes, with Girard saying &quot;I allowed myself to play the game to its limits&quot;. The budget was $1.8 million.

Actor Colm Feore watched available video and listened to sound recordings of Gould in order to develop his performance. He also read through 6,000 of Gould&#x27;s letters.

===Filming===

Girard took the first shots in Hamburg in August 1992, while Gould&#x27;s genuine Steinway grand piano was moved to a church in Toronto for principal photography. Most filming took place in Toronto and Montreal. Feore and the filmmakers also shot scenes in Lake Saint Pierre in December 1992, for the scenes set in Northern Canada.

The animation in the &quot;Gould Meets McLaren&quot; segment is clipped from Norman McLaren&#x27;s film &quot;Spheres&quot;, published in 1969. Violinist Yehudi Menuhin was among those interviewed for the film.

===Music===
The soundtrack consists almost entirely of piano recordings by Gould. It includes pieces famously linked with him, such as &quot;&quot;, and the &quot;Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;. It also features the prelude to Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; in the &quot;Lake Simcoe&quot; segment.

Sony Classical released a soundtrack album on CD in 1994. This was part of a strategy to obtain video rights for certain films, with the CD release timed to match the U.S. cinematic release in April.

==Release==
&quot;Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould&quot; debuted at the Venice Film Festival in September 1993, where it received positive reviews. It also played at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 1993. In 1994, it was one of 26 films featured in the Miami International Film Festival.

Rhombus Media and Max Films was the Canadian distributor, and after the Toronto festival, made plans for an initial release in Montreal and Toronto. In the U.S., it was distributed by The Samuel Goldwyn Company, and opened in New York City on 14 April 1994.

The Canadian Film Institute restored the film, and in co-operation with TIFF, it was played at Library and Archives Canada in January 2009. A DVD was released in Region 1 in 2012.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Roger Ebert awarded the film four stars, praising it for parting with the customary biopic format and challenging viewers to imagine themselves as Gould. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; assessed it as smart and highly interesting. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; critic Desson Howe described the segments as exciting and revealing. In &quot;Variety&quot;, Leonard Klady cited it as a rare film for achieving a picture of both an artist and the artist&#x27;s work. For &quot;Newsweek&quot;, David Ansen called it an &quot;elegant, coolly funny movie&quot;. &quot;The New Republic&quot; critic Stanley Kauffmann said it offered &quot;teasing yet satisfactory glimpses- vivid, funny, cranky, passionate, eremitic, humane&quot;.

In 2012, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;&#x27;s Richard Brody wrote the film used unique methods to find Gould&#x27;s brilliance. In his &quot;2015 Movie Guide&quot;, Leonard Maltin gave it two and a half stars, criticizing it as &quot;too fragmented&quot;. The film has a 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 25 reviews.

===Accolades===
==Legacy==
Girard and McKellar employed a few crew members from &quot;Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould&quot; for their next film, &quot;The Red Violin&quot; (1998). Cinematographer Alain Dostie, editor Gaétan Huot and Feore were among those who reunited for the project.

The TV series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; gave homage to the film with the title of the episode &quot;22 Short Films About Springfield&quot;, which aired on 14 April 1996. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; asserted many viewers in 1996 would have understood the title, noting the series &quot;Animaniacs&quot; also produced a 1996 short entitled &quot;Ten Short Films About Wakko Warner&quot;.

<doc id="295973" wikidata="Q502530" url="?curid=295973" title="Stage Fright (1950 film)">
<text>Stage Fright is a 1950 British thriller film noir directed and produced by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Jane Wyman, Marlene Dietrich, Michael Wilding and Richard Todd. The cast also features Alastair Sim, Sybil Thorndike, Kay Walsh, Hitchcock&#x27;s daughter Pat Hitchcock in her film debut, and Joyce Grenfell in a vignette.

The story was adapted for the screen by Whitfield Cook and Alma Reville (the director&#x27;s wife), with additional dialogue by James Bridie, based on the 1947 novel &quot;Man Running&quot; by Selwyn Jepson.

==Plot==
Eve Gill is an aspiring actress at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. She is interrupted in rehearsal by her friend and crush, Jonathan Cooper, the secret lover of flamboyant stage actress and singer Charlotte Inwood. Via a flashback, he says Charlotte visited him after killing her husband; she was wearing a bloodstained dress. Jonathan claims he went back to her house for another dress but was seen by Nellie Goode, Charlotte&#x27;s Cockney maid and dresser. He escaped the police and needs help.

Eve takes him to her father&#x27;s house on the coast to hide. Commodore Gill notices that the blood on Charlotte&#x27;s dress has been smeared on deliberately; he and Eve think that Charlotte framed Jonathan. Jonathan angrily destroys the dress and, thus, the most useful piece of evidence.

Eve starts to investigate. She hears Charlotte&#x27;s dresser Nellie Goode boasting about her newfound notoriety in a bar. While she is there, Eve meets Detective Inspector Wilfred O. Smith, and they become friendly. Eve then poses as a reporter; she bribes Nellie to tell Charlotte she is ill and introduce her cousin &quot;Doris Tinsdale&quot; as a replacement. Using her acting skills, Eve becomes &quot;Doris&quot; and starts working for Charlotte. Eve discovers Charlotte is having an affair with her manager Freddie Williams.

Eve and &quot;Ordinary&quot; Smith become more friendly. When Smith visits Charlotte, Eve has to disguise the fact that she is also &quot;Doris&quot;, the maid. Smith makes a courtship visit to Eve and her mother at home, where the Commodore drops subtle hints that Jonathan has left the seaside house.

Despite her widowed status, Charlotte continues to perform her West End musical show. Jonathan comes to her dressing room, asking her to accompany him abroad. She casually tells him no, but he says he still has the bloodstained dress. The police search for Jonathan and Eve again helps him escape. He hides at the Gills&#x27; London residence. He is grateful to Eve, but she is starting to fall in love with Detective Smith.

Smith and Eve kiss in a taxi on the way to the RADA garden party, where Nellie Goode confronts Eve, demanding more blackmail money. Eve does not have enough, so Eve&#x27;s father comes to give Nellie more cash. Freddie Williams spots Eve (thinking she is &quot;Doris&quot;) and orders her to help Charlotte, who is to sing onstage in a tent. During the performance, Commodore Gill gets a small boy to carry a doll wearing a bloodstained dress onto the stage as Charlotte sings &quot;La Vie en rose&quot;. Disturbed, Charlotte collapses, and &quot;Doris&quot; has to help.

Seeing this, Smith confronts Eve and the Commodore, but Eve proclaims her true affection for Smith as well as Jonathan&#x27;s innocence. They persuade Smith to set Charlotte up. Once the theatre has closed, they use a hidden microphone, and &quot;Doris&quot; tells Charlotte she has the bloodstained dress. Smith and his men listen using the theatre loudspeakers. Charlotte admits planning her husband&#x27;s death but says that Jonathan actually committed the murder. Charlotte offers Eve £10,000 to keep quiet.

Eve sees that Jonathan has been brought to the theatre by the police, but he escapes. Charlotte realises her conversation with Eve was broadcast to the detectives and that she will be charged as an accessory to murder. Detective Smith tells the Commodore that Jonathan really did kill Mr. Inwood and that Jonathan had killed before, though he got off on a plea of self-defense.

Hiding below the stage, Jonathan confesses to Eve that Charlotte goaded him into killing her husband. His flashback story was all lies, and he was the one who smeared more blood onto the dress. He alludes to killing Eve to justify a plea for insanity in court. Eve pretends to help Jonathan escape but locks him onto the stage and alerts the police about his presence. As Jonathan is pursued from all directions and cornered, he is killed by the stage&#x27;s falling safety curtain.

==Cast==
==Production==
Though Hitchcock had lived and worked in Hollywood since 1939, this mystery thriller, which is mixed with humour, was made in London locations. The only members of the cast who are not British are the two top-billed stars: Wyman and Dietrich.
Dietrich&#x27;s costumes were designed by Christian Dior, and the production featured a Cole Porter song, &quot;The Laziest Gal in Town&quot;, performed by Dietrich in a sultry fashion. Dietrich also begins a performance of Edith Piaf&#x27;s &quot;La Vie en rose&quot; twice, the first being heard before a scene change and later her character is unable to finish it after being startled by a Boy Scout bringing a blood-stained doll to her. Dietrich was allowed an unprecedented control of her shots by Hitchcock during the filming. When asked during the filming about working with the famously controlling, and technically adept Dietrich, Hitchcock replied, &quot;Everything is fine. Miss Dietrich has arranged the whole thing. She has told them exactly where to place the lights and how to photograph her.&quot; He later said of Dietrich, &quot;Marlene was a professional star. She was also a professional cameraman, art director, editor, costume designer, hairdresser, makeup woman, composer, producer and director.&quot;

&quot;Stage Fright&quot; garnered some adverse publicity upon its initial release due to the &quot;lying flashback&quot; seen near the beginning of the film. However, some film critics, including those of &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot;, see the flashback as simply being an illustration of one person&#x27;s version of the events: the events as recounted by the character whose voice-over we hear, which was presumably Hitchcock&#x27;s intention. Hitchcock realized that the scene might be misinterpreted after seeing the film edited together, but it was too late to change; he would later maintain that it was one of his greatest mistakes. Alternatively, modern filmmaker and Hitchcock devotee Richard Franklin described it as &quot;almost cutting edge mystery filmmaking&quot;.

The film has a few extra-long takes, reminiscent of those that Hitchcock used in &quot;Rope&quot; (1948) and &quot;Under Capricorn&quot; (1949), both films produced by Hitchcock for Transatlantic Pictures in partnership with Sidney Bernstein and released by Warner Brothers. &quot;Stage Fright&quot; was originally intended to be a Transatlantic release, but became a Warners release instead.

According to the biography of Dietrich by her daughter Maria Riva, Dietrich was not particularly fond of Jane Wyman, perhaps because they were such opposites.

Howard Maxford, author of &quot;The A–Z of Hitchcock: The Ultimate Reference Guide&quot;, notes that some aspects of the Edith Thompson and Frederick Bywaters case have similarities to the plot of &quot;Stage Fright&quot;.

==Differences between the film and the novel==

Although &quot;Stage Fright&quot; is based on Selwyn Jepson&#x27;s short story &quot;Man Running&quot; (also known as &quot;Outrun the Constable&quot;), it differs in some ways. In the original story, Freddie Williams is the actual murderer.

==Hitchcock&#x27;s cameo==
Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s cameo is a signature occurrence in most of his films. In &quot;Stage Fright&quot;, he can be seen 39 minutes into the film as a man on the street turning to look at Eve as she rehearses her scripted introduction speech to Mrs. Inwood.

In the 4 June 1950 issue of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Hitchcock stated:
:&quot;In &quot;Stage Fright&quot;, I have been told that my performance is quite juicy. I have been told this with a certain air of tolerance, implying that I have now achieved the maximum limits of directorial ham in the movie sandwich. It isn&#x27;t true. There may have been a &#x27;MacGuffin&#x27; in my film appearance, but not a ham.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical reaction===
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Hitchcock &quot;and his writers have contrived to give a fine cast of actors some slick and entertaining things to do. But we must quietly advise you that these things, while amusing separately, build up very little sustained excitement or suspense. They are simply a wild accumulation of clever or colorful episodes, tending for the most part to the comic, without any real anxiety.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; agreed, writing that &quot;the picture doesn&#x27;t lack for comic touches, but none of its episodes ties in very closely with the succeeding one, and the result is disappointing.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; printed a more positive review, reporting that Hitchcock &quot;has a choice cast to put through its paces, and there&#x27;s not a bad performance anywhere. The dialog has purpose, either for a chuckle or a thrill, and the pace is good despite the 110 minutes of footage.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called it &quot;a rambling murder thriller that wavers constantly between comedy that is delightfully funny and melodrama that is rarely more than moderately exciting. The overall result is a spotty entertainment that is too dragged out to keep one&#x27;s interest constantly alive.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that there were &quot;so many beguiling people and moments&quot; in the film &quot;that it&#x27;s curious the picture as a whole isn&#x27;t better.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Stage Fright&quot; is not without effective moments, reminding us how Hitchcock once excelled in the simple melodrama with ordinary, naturalistic backgrounds; but too much of it has the heavy, corpulent quality that made &quot;Rope&quot; and in particular &quot;Under Capricorn&quot; so lifeless and unreal.&quot; Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; described &quot;Stage Fright&quot; as &quot;abominable&quot;. It was selected as one of the Top 10 Films of 1950 chosen annually by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures.

Contemporary reviews of the film have been mostly positive. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Stage Fright&quot; has an approval rating of 91% based on 21 reviews, with an average score of 7.10/10.

The film has been shown on the Turner Classic Movies show &quot;Noir Alley&quot; with Eddie Muller.

===Box office===
Trade papers called the film a &quot;notable box office attraction&quot; in British cinemas in 1950. According to Warner Bros&#x27; accounts, the film earned $1,012,000 domestically and $896,000 internationally.

<text>In legal theory, a default rule is a rule of law that can be overridden by a contract, trust, will, or other legally effective agreement. Contract law, for example, can be divided into two kinds of rules: &quot;default rules&quot; and &quot;mandatory rules.&quot; Whereas the &quot;default rules&quot; can be modified by agreement of the parties, &quot;mandatory rules&quot; will be enforced, even if the parties to a contract attempt to override or modify them. One of the most important debates in contract theory concerns the proper role or purpose of default rules.

The idea of a default rule in contract law is sometimes connected to the notion of a complete contract. In contract theory, a complete contract fully specifies the rights and duties of the parties to the contract for all possible future states of the world. An incomplete contract, therefore, contains gaps. Most contract theorists find that default rules fill in the gaps in what would otherwise be incomplete contracts. This is often stated pragmatically as whether a court will imply terms so as to save a contract from uncertainty.

<text>Irene Cara Escalera (March 18, 1959 – November 25, 2022) was an American singer and actress who rose to prominence for her role as Coco Hernandez in the 1980 musical film &quot;Fame&quot;, and for recording the film&#x27;s title song &quot;Fame&quot;, which reached No. 1 in several countries. In 1983, Cara co-wrote and sang the song &quot;Flashdance... What a Feeling&quot; (from the film &quot;Flashdance&quot;), for which she shared an Academy Award for Best Original Song and won a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 1984.

Before her success with &quot;Fame&quot;, Cara portrayed the title character Sparkle Williams in the original 1976 musical drama film &quot;Sparkle&quot;. Cara died as a result of hypertensive heart disease after hypercholesterolemia at age 63.

== Early life ==
Irene Cara Escalera was born and raised in the Bronx, New York City, the youngest of five children. Her father, Gaspar Cara, a steel factory worker and retired saxophonist, was Puerto Rican, and her mother, Louise Escalera, a movie theater usher, was Cuban. Cara had two sisters and two brothers. She began taking dance lessons when she was five. Her performing career started with her singing and dancing professionally on Spanish-language television. She made early TV appearances on &quot;The Original Amateur Hour&quot; (singing in Spanish) and Johnny Carson&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. In 1971, she was a regular on PBS&#x27;s educational program &quot;The Electric Company&quot; as a member of the Short Circus, the show&#x27;s band, appearing as a member during the show’s first season. As a child, Cara recorded a Spanish-language record for the Latin market and an English-language Christmas album. She also appeared in a major concert tribute to Duke Ellington, which featured Stevie Wonder, Sammy Davis Jr., and Roberta Flack. Cara attended the Professional Children&#x27;s School in Manhattan. In 1985, Cara told &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t mean to sound immodest, but I&#x27;d never had any doubt that I&#x27;d be successful, nor any fear of success; I was raised as a little goddess who was told she would be a star.&quot;

== Career ==
Cara appeared in Broadway and off-Broadway shows, starting with &quot;Maggie Flynn&quot; opposite Shirley Jones and Jack Cassidy. Shortly thereafter, she was one of five finalists for the &quot;Little Miss America&quot; pageant. She also appeared in &quot;Via Galactica&quot; with Raúl Juliá, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;&quot;  and &quot;The Me Nobody Knows&quot; (which won an Obie Award). Cara was the original Daisy Allen on the 1970s daytime serial &quot;Love of Life&quot;. She later took on the role of Angela in the romance/thriller &quot;Aaron Loves Angela&quot;, followed by her portrayal of the title character in &quot;Sparkle&quot;.

Television brought Cara international acclaim for serious dramatic roles in &quot;&quot; and &quot;Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones&quot;. &quot;John Willis&#x27; Screen World&quot;, Vol. 28, named her one of twelve &quot;Promising New Actors of 1976&quot;; that same year, a readers&#x27; poll in &quot;Right On!&quot; magazine named her Top Actress.

The 1980 hit film &quot;Fame&quot;, directed by Alan Parker, catapulted Cara to stardom. She originally was cast as a dancer, but when producers David Da Silva and Alan Marshall and screenwriter Christopher Gore heard her voice, they re-wrote the role of Coco Hernandez for her to play. In this part, she sang both the title song &quot;Fame&quot; and the single &quot;Out Here on My Own&quot;, which were both nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. These songs helped make the film&#x27;s soundtrack a chart-topping, multi-platinum album, and it was the first time that two songs from the same film and sung by the same artist were nominated in the same category. Cara had the opportunity to be one of the few singers to perform more than one song at the Oscar ceremony; &quot;Fame,&quot; written by Michael Gore and Dean Pitchford, won the award for best original song that year, and the film won the Academy Award for Best Original Score. Cara earned Grammy Award nominations in 1980 for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, as well as a Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture Actress in a Musical. &quot;Billboard&quot; named her Top New Single Artist, and &quot;Cashbox&quot; magazine awarded her both Most Promising Female Vocalist and Top Female Vocalist. Asked by &quot;Fame&quot; TV series producers to reprise her role as Coco Hernandez, she declined, wanting to focus her attention on her recording career; Erica Gimpel assumed the role.

In 1980, she briefly played the role of Dorothy in &quot;The Wiz&quot; on tour, in a role that Stephanie Mills had portrayed in the original Broadway production. Coincidentally, Cara and Mills had shared the stage together as children in the original 1968 Broadway musical &quot;Maggie Flynn&quot;, starring Shirley Jones and Jack Cassidy, in which both young girls played American Civil War orphans.
Cara was set to star in the sitcom &quot;Irene&quot; in 1981. The cast had veteran performers Kaye Ballard and Teddy Wilson as well as newcomers Julia Duffy and Keenen Ivory Wayans. However, the pilot was not picked up by the network for the fall season. In 1983, Cara appeared as herself in the film &quot;D.C. Cab&quot;. One of the characters, Tyrone, played by Charlie Barnett, is an obsessed Cara fan who decorated his Checker Cab as a shrine to her. &quot;The Dream (Hold On to Your Dream)&quot;, her contribution to the film&#x27;s soundtrack, played over the closing credits of the film, and was a minor hit, peaking at No. 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in February 1984.

In 1982, Cara earned the Image Award for Best Actress when she co-starred with Diahann Carroll and Rosalind Cash in the NBC Movie of the Week &quot;Sister, Sister&quot;. Cara portrayed Myrlie Evers-Williams in &quot;For Us the Living: The Medgar Evers Story&quot;, the PBS TV movie about civil rights leader Medgar Evers, and she earned an NAACP Image Award Best Actress nomination. She also appeared in 1982&#x27;s &quot;Killing &#x27;em Softly&quot;. Cara continued to perform in live theater. 

In 1983, Cara reached the peak of her music career with the title song for the movie &quot;Flashdance&quot;: &quot;Flashdance... What a Feeling&quot;, which she co-wrote with Giorgio Moroder and Keith Forsey. Cara wrote the lyrics to the song with Keith Forsey while riding in a car in New York heading to the studio to record it; Moroder composed the music. Cara admitted later that she was initially reluctant to work with Giorgio Moroder because she had no wish to invite comparisons with Donna Summer, another artist who worked with Moroder. The song became a hit in several countries, attracting several awards for Cara. She shared the 1983 Academy Award for Best Original Song with Moroder and Forsey, becoming the first black woman to win an Oscar in a non-acting category and the youngest to receive an Oscar for songwriting. She won the 1984 Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, 1984 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, and American Music Awards for Best R&amp;B Female Artist and Best Pop Single of the Year.

In 1984, she was in the comedic thriller &quot;City Heat&quot;, co-starring with Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds and singing the standards &quot;Embraceable You&quot; and &quot;Get Happy&quot;. She also co-wrote the theme song &quot;City Heat&quot;, sung by the jazz vocalist Joe Williams. In May 1984, she scored her final Top 40 hit with &quot;Breakdance&quot; going to No. 8. &quot;You Were Made for Me&quot; reached No. 78 that summer, but she did not appear on the Hot 100 again. In 1985, Cara co-starred with Tatum O&#x27;Neal in &quot;Certain Fury&quot;. In 1986, Cara appeared in the film &quot;Busted Up&quot;. She also provided the voice of Snow White in the unofficial sequel to Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, Filmation&#x27;s &quot;Happily Ever After&quot;, in 1993. The same year, she appeared as Mary Magdalene in a tour of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; with Ted Neeley, Carl Anderson, and Dennis DeYoung.

Cara released three studio albums: &quot;Anyone Can See&quot; in 1982, &quot;What a Feelin&#x27;&quot; in 1983, and &quot;Carasmatic&quot; in 1987, the most successful of these being &quot;What a Feelin&quot;&#x27;. In 1985, she collaborated with the Hispanic charity supergroup Hermanos in the song &quot;Cantaré, cantarás&quot;, in which she sang a solo segment with the Spanish opera singer Plácido Domingo. Cara toured Europe and Asia throughout the 1990s, achieving several modest dance hits on European charts, but no U.S. chart hits. She released a compilation of Eurodance singles in the mid-to-late 1990s titled &quot;Precarious 90&#x27;s&quot;. Cara also worked as a backup vocalist for Vicki Sue Robinson, Lou Reed, George Duke, Oleta Adams, and Evelyn &quot;Champagne&quot; King.

In 1993, a California jury awarded her $1.5 million from a 1985 lawsuit she filed against record executive Al Coury and Network Records, accusing them of withholding royalties from the &quot;Flashdance&quot; soundtrack and her first two solo records. Cara stated that, as a result, she was labeled as being difficult to work with and that the music industry &quot;virtually blacklisted&quot; her.

In 2005, Cara won the third round of the NBC television series &quot;Hit Me, Baby, One More Time&quot;, performing &quot;Flashdance... What a Feeling&quot; and covered Anastacia&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;m Outta Love&quot; with her all-female band Hot Caramel. At the 2006 AFL Grand Final in Melbourne, Cara performed a rendition of &quot;Flashdance&quot; as an opener to the pre-match entertainment.

In 2005, Cara contributed a dance single, titled &quot;Forever My Love&quot;, to the compilation album titled &quot;Gay Happening Vol. 12&quot;.

Cara was in Hot Caramel, a band which she formed in 1999. Their album, called &quot;Irene Cara Presents Hot Caramel&quot;, was released in 2011. Cara appeared in season 2 of CMT&#x27;s reality show &quot;Gone Country&quot;.

== Personal life and death ==
Cara married stuntman and film director Conrad Palmisano in Los Angeles on April 13, 1986. The couple had no children and divorced in 1991. 

Cara died from arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease after hypercholesterolemia at her home on November 25, 2022, at 63 years of age; she also had diabetes. At the time of her death, Cara was a resident of Florida, living in Largo and maintaining a secondary address in New Port Richey, where her company, Caramel Productions, was located.

<doc id="295977" wikidata="Q315353" url="?curid=295977" title="John Taverner">
<text>John Taverner ( – 18 October 1545) was an English composer and organist, regarded as one of the most important English composers of his era. He is best-known for &quot;Missa Gloria tibi Trinitas&quot; and &quot;The Western Wynde Mass&quot;, and &quot;Missa Corona Spinea&quot; is also often viewed as a masterwork.

== Career ==
Nothing is known of Taverner&#x27;s activities before 1524. He appears to have come from the East Midlands, possibly being born in Tattershall, Lincolnshire, but there is no indication of his parentage. According to one of his own letters, he was related to the Yerburghs, a well-to-do Lincolnshire family. The earliest information is that in 1524, Taverner travelled from Tattershall to the Church of St Botolph in nearby Boston, as a guest singer. Two years later, in 1526, Taverner became the first Organist and Master of the Choristers at Christ Church, Oxford, appointed by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. The college had been founded in 1525, by Cardinal Wolsey, and was then known as Cardinal College. Immediately before this, Taverner had been a clerk fellow at the Collegiate Church of Tattershall. In 1528, he was reprimanded for his (probably minor) involvement with Lutherans, but escaped punishment for being &quot;but a musitian&quot;. Wolsey fell from favour in 1529, and in 1530, Taverner left the college. He married a widow, one Rose Parrowe, probably in 1536, and she outlived him until 1553. During the last five months of the composer&#x27;s life, he was an alderman in the town council of Boston. For about three years, previously, he was the treasurer of the Corpus Christi Gild, there in Boston.

As far as can be told, Taverner had no further musical appointments, nor can any of his known works be dated to after that time, so he may have ceased composition. It is often said that after leaving Oxford, Taverner worked as an agent of Thomas Cromwell assisting in the Dissolution of the Monasteries, although the veracity of this is now thought to be highly questionable. He is known to have settled eventually in Boston, Lincolnshire, where he was a small landowner and reasonably well-off. He is buried with his wife under the belltower at Boston Parish Church. (In the few existing copies of his signature, the composer actually spelled his last name &quot;Tavernor.&quot;) The 20th-century composer, Sir John Tavener claimed (even in his early teens), to be his direct descendant.

== Works ==

Most of Taverner&#x27;s music is vocal, and includes masses, Magnificats and motets. The bulk of his output is thought to date from the 1520s. His best-known motet is &quot;Dum Transisset Sabbatum.&quot;

One of his best-known masses is based on a popular song called &quot;The Western Wynde&quot; (John Sheppard and Christopher Tye later also wrote masses based on this same song). Taverner&#x27;s &quot;Western Wynde&quot; mass is unusual for the period because the theme tune appears in each of the four parts, excepting the alto, at different times. Perhaps his most celebrated work is his &quot;Missa Gloria tibi Trinitas&quot;, which Taverner probably composed during his years at Christ Church, Oxford. Commonly his masses are designed so that each of the four sections (Gloria, Credo, Sanctus-Benedictus and Agnus Dei) are about the same length, often achieved by putting the same number of repetitions of the thematic material in each. For example, in the &quot;Western Wynde&quot; mass, the theme is repeated nine times in each section. As the sections have texts of very different lengths, he uses extended melismata in the movements with fewer words.

Several of his other masses use the widespread &quot;cantus firmus&quot; technique, where a plainchant melody with long note values is placed in an interior part, often the tenor. Examples of cantus firmus masses include &quot;Corona Spinea&quot; and &quot;Gloria Tibi Trinitas&quot;. Another technique of composition is seen in his mass &quot;Mater Christi&quot;, which is based upon material taken from his motet of that name, and hence known as a &quot;derived&quot; or &quot;parody&quot; mass.

The &quot;Missa Gloria tibi Trinitas&quot; gave origin to the style of instrumental work known as an &quot;In nomine.&quot; Although this mass is in six parts, some more virtuosic sections are in reduced numbers of parts, presumably intended for soloists, a compositional technique used in several of his masses. The section at the words &quot;in nomine ...&quot; in the Benedictus is in four parts, with the plainchant in the alto. This section of the mass became popular as an instrumental work for viol consort. Other composers came to write instrumental works modelled on this, and the name &quot;In nomine&quot; was given to works of this type.

The life of Taverner was the subject of &quot;Taverner&quot;, an opera by Peter Maxwell Davies.

<doc id="295981" wikidata="Q944595" url="?curid=295981" title="DOCSIS">
<text>Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) is an international telecommunications standard that permits the addition of high-bandwidth data transfer to an existing cable television (CATV) system. It is used by many cable television operators to provide cable Internet access over their existing hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) infrastructure.

DOCSIS was originally developed by CableLabs and contributing companies, including Arris, BigBand Networks, Broadcom, Cisco, Comcast, Conexant, Correlant, Cox, General Instrument, Harmonic, Intel, Motorola, Netgear, Terayon, Time Warner Cable, and Texas Instruments.

==Versions==
: Released in March 1997, DOCSIS 1.0 included functional elements from preceding proprietary cable modems.
: Released in April 1999, DOCSIS 1.1 standardized quality of service (QoS) mechanisms that were outlined in DOCSIS 1.0.
; (abbreviated D2)
: Released in December 2001, DOCSIS 2.0 enhanced upstream data rates in response to increased demand for symmetric services such as IP telephony.
; (abbreviated D3)
: Released in August 2006, DOCSIS 3.0 significantly increased data rates (both upstream and downstream) and introduced support for Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).
: First released in October 2013, and subsequently updated several times, the DOCSIS 3.1 suite of specifications support capacities of up to 10 Gbit/s downstream and 1 Gbit/s upstream using 4096 QAM. The new specifications eliminated 6 MHz and 8 MHz wide channel spacing and instead use narrower (25 kHz or 50 kHz wide) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers; these can be bonded inside a block spectrum that could end up being about 200 MHz wide. DOCSIS 3.1 technology also includes power-management features that will enable the cable industry to reduce its energy usage, and the DOCSIS-PIE algorithm to reduce bufferbloat. In the United States, broadband provider Comcast announced in February 2016 that several cities within its footprint will have DOCSIS 3.1 availability before the end of the year. At the end of 2016, Mediacom announced it would become the first major U.S. cable company to fully transition to the DOCSIS 3.1 platform.
: Improves DOCSIS 3.1 to use the full spectrum of the cable plant (0 MHz to ~1.8 GHz) at the same time in both upstream and downstream directions. This technology enables multi-gigabit symmetrical services while retaining backward compatibility with DOCSIS 3.1. CableLabs released the full specification in October 2017. Previously branded as DOCSIS 3.1 Full Duplex, these technologies have been rebranded as part of DOCSIS 4.0.
: There is currently no official version of DOCSIS declared as DOCSIS 5.0 by CableLabs. There is speculation proposing targets of 25 Gbit/s downstream and at least 5 Gbit/s upstream at 3 GHz, and a reference implementation that was demonstrated in 2024.

===Comparison===
Several DOCSIS versions can co exist by using frequency division multiplexing and separating new DOCSIS versions from old ones according to their operation frequencies.

==European alternative==
As frequency allocation bandwidth plans differ between United States and European CATV systems, DOCSIS standards earlier than 3.1 have been modified for use in Europe. These modifications were published under the name EuroDOCSIS. The differences between the bandwidths exist because European cable TV conforms to PAL/DVB-C standards of 8 MHz RF channel bandwidth and North American cable TV conforms to NTSC/ATSC standards which specify 6 MHz per channel. The wider channel bandwidth in EuroDOCSIS architectures permits more bandwidth to be allocated to the downstream data path (toward the user). EuroDOCSIS certification testing is executed by Belgian company Excentis (formerly known as tComLabs), while DOCSIS certification testing is executed by CableLabs. Typically, customer premises equipment receives &quot;certification&quot;, while CMTS equipment receives &quot;qualification&quot;.

==International standards==
The ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) has approved the various versions of DOCSIS as international standards. DOCSIS 1.0 was ratified as ITU-T Recommendation J.112 Annex B (1998), but it was superseded by DOCSIS 1.1 which was ratified as ITU-T Recommendation J.112 Annex B (2001). Subsequently, DOCSIS 2.0 was ratified as ITU-T Recommendation J.122. Most recently, DOCSIS 3.0 was ratified as ITU-T Recommendation J.222 (J.222.0, J.222.1, J.222.2, J.222.3).

Note: While ITU-T Recommendation J.112 Annex B corresponds to DOCSIS/EuroDOCSIS 1.1, Annex A describes an earlier European cable modem system (&quot;DVB EuroModem&quot;) based on ATM transmission standards. Annex C describes a variant of DOCSIS 1.1 that is designed to operate in Japanese cable systems. The ITU-T Recommendation J.122 main body corresponds to DOCSIS 2.0, J.122 Annex F corresponds to EuroDOCSIS 2.0, and J.122 Annex J describes the Japanese variant of DOCSIS 2.0 (analogous to Annex C of J.112).

==Features==
DOCSIS provides a variety of options available at Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layers 1 and 2—the physical and data link layers.

===Physical layer===
* Channel width:
** Downstream: All versions of DOCSIS earlier than 3.1 use either 6 MHz channels (e.g. North America) or 8 MHz channels (&quot;EuroDOCSIS&quot;). DOCSIS 3.1 uses channel bandwidths of up to 192 MHz in the downstream.
** Upstream: DOCSIS 1.0/1.1 specifies channel widths between 200 kHz and 3.2 MHz. DOCSIS 2.0 &amp; 3.0 specify 6.4 MHz, but can use the earlier, narrower channel widths for backward compatibility. DOCSIS 3.1 uses channel bandwidths of up to 96 MHz in the upstream.
* Modulation:
** Downstream: All versions of DOCSIS prior to 3.1 specify that 64-level or 256-level QAM (64-QAM or 256-QAM) be used for modulation of downstream data, using the ITU-T J.83-Annex B standard for 6 MHz channel operation, and the DVB-C modulation standard for 8 MHz (EuroDOCSIS) operation. DOCSIS 3.1 adds 16-QAM, 128-QAM, 512-QAM, 1024-QAM, 2048-QAM and 4096-QAM, with optional support of 8192-QAM/16384-QAM.
** Upstream: Upstream data uses QPSK or 16-level QAM (16-QAM) for DOCSIS 1.x, while QPSK, 8-QAM, 16-QAM, 32-QAM, and 64-QAM are used for DOCSIS 2.0 and 3.0. DOCSIS 2.0 and 3.0 also support 128-QAM with trellis coded modulation in S-CDMA mode (with an effective spectral efficiency equivalent to that of 64-QAM). DOCSIS 3.1 supports data modulations from QPSK up to 1024-QAM, with optional support for 2048-QAM and 4096-QAM.

=== Data link layer ===
* DOCSIS employs a mixture of deterministic access methods for upstream transmissions, specifically time-division multiple access (TDMA) for DOCSIS 1.0/1.1 and both TDMA and S-CDMA for DOCSIS 2.0 and 3.0, with a limited use of contention for bandwidth reservation requests. In TDMA, a cable modem requests a time to transmit and the CMTS grants it an available time slot.
* For DOCSIS 1.1 and above, the data layer also includes extensive quality-of-service (QoS) features that help to efficiently support applications that have specific traffic requirements such as low latency, e.g. voice over IP.
* DOCSIS 3.0 features channel bonding, which enables multiple downstream and upstream channels to be used together at the same time by a single subscriber.

=== Throughput ===
Bandwidth is shared among users of an HFC, within service groups which are groups of customers that share RF channels.

The first three versions of the DOCSIS standard support a downstream throughput with 256-QAM of up to 42.88 Mbit/s per 6 MHz channel (approximately 38 Mbit/s after overhead), or 55.62 Mbit/s per 8 MHz channel for EuroDOCSIS (approximately 50 Mbit/s after overhead). The upstream throughput possible is 30.72 Mbit/s per 6.4 MHz channel (approximately 27 Mbit/s after overhead), or 10.24 Mbit/s per 3.2 MHz channel (approximately 9 Mbit/s after overhead).

DOCSIS 3.1 supports a downstream throughput with 4096-QAM and 25 kHz subcarrier spacing of up to 1.89 Gbit/s per 192 MHz OFDM channel. The upstream throughput possible is 0.94 Gbit/s per 96 MHz OFDMA channel.

=== Network layer ===
* DOCSIS modems are managed via an Internet Protocol (IP) address.
* The &#x27;DOCSIS 2.0 + IPv6&#x27; specification allowed support for IPv6 on DOCSIS 2.0 modems via a firmware upgrade.
* DOCSIS 3.0 added management over IPv6.

== Throughput ==
Tables assume 256-QAM modulation for downstream and 64-QAM for upstream on DOCSIS 3.0, and 4096-QAM modulation for OFDM/OFDMA (first downstream/upstream methods) on DOCSIS 3.1, although real-world data rates may be lower due to variable modulation depending on SNR. Higher data rates are possible but require higher order QAM schemes which require higher downstream modulation error ratio (MER). DOCSIS 3.1 was designed to support up to 8192-QAM/16,384-QAM, but only support of up through 4096-QAM is mandatory to meet the minimum DOCSIS 3.1 standards.

For DOCSIS 3.0, the theoretical maximum throughput for the number of bonded channels are listed in the table below.

Note that the number of channels a cable system can support is dependent on how the cable system is set up. For example, the amount of available bandwidth in each direction, the width of the channels selected in the upstream direction, and hardware constraints limit the maximum amount of channels in each direction.

Note that the maximum downstream bandwidth on all versions of DOCSIS depends on the version of DOCSIS used and the number of upstream channels used if DOCSIS 3.0 is used, but the upstream channel widths are independent of whether DOCSIS or EuroDOCSIS is used.

=== Upstream ===
Traditional DOCSIS upstream in North America uses the 5–42 MHz frequency range. The 5–65 MHz range is used by EuroDOCSIS. This is known as a &quot;low-split&quot; or &quot;sub-split&quot; design, capable of a total shared capacity of ~108 Mbit/s upstream (assuming 4 SC-QAM upstream channels) for the service group.

In recent years, cable operators have begun to increase the amount of bandwidth dedicated to the upstream. The two most popular options for this include a &quot;mid-split&quot; or &quot;high-split&quot;.

A mid-split increases the upstream frequency range to 5–85 MHz, supporting a total shared upstream capacity of ~450 Mbit/s (assuming 4 SC-QAM + OFDMA channels) for the service group.

A high-split increases the upstream frequency range to 5–204 MHz, supporting a total shared upstream capacity of ~1.5 Gbit/s (assuming 4 SC-QAM + OFDMA channels) for the service group.

DOCSIS 4.0 in both full-duplex (FDX) and extended spectrum DOCSIS (ESD) configurations will support upstream speeds surpassing 5 Gbit/s.

== Equipment ==

A DOCSIS architecture includes two primary components: a cable modem located at the customer premises, and a cable modem termination system (CMTS) located at the CATV headend.

The customer PC and associated peripherals are termed customer-premises equipment (CPE). The CPE are connected to the cable modem, which is in turn connected through the HFC network to the CMTS. The CMTS then routes traffic between the HFC and the Internet. Using provisioning systems and through the CMTS, the cable operator exercises control over the cable modem&#x27;s configuration.

DOCSIS 2.0 was also used over microwave frequencies (10 GHz) in Ireland by Digiweb, using dedicated wireless links rather than HFC network. At each subscriber premises the ordinary CM is connected to an antenna box which converts to/from microwave frequencies and transmits/receives on 10 GHz. Each customer has a dedicated link but the transmitter mast must be in line of sight (most sites are hilltop).

== Security ==
DOCSIS includes media access control (MAC) layer security services in its Baseline Privacy Interface specifications. DOCSIS 1.0 used the initial Baseline Privacy Interface (BPI) specification. BPI was later improved with the release of the Baseline Privacy Interface Plus (BPI+) specification used by DOCSIS 1.1 and 2.0. Most recently, a number of enhancements to the Baseline Privacy Interface were added as part of DOCSIS 3.0, and the specification was renamed &quot;Security&quot; (SEC).

The intent of the BPI/SEC specifications is to describe MAC layer security services for DOCSIS CMTS to cable modem communications. BPI/SEC security goals are twofold:
* Provide cable modem users with data privacy across the cable network
* Provide cable service operators with service protection (i.e. prevent unauthorized modems and users from gaining access to the network&#x27;s RF MAC services)

BPI/SEC is intended to prevent cable users from listening to each other. It does this by encrypting data flows between the CMTS and the cable modem. BPI and BPI+ use 56-bit Data Encryption Standard (DES) encryption, while SEC adds support for 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The AES key, however, is protected only by a 1024-bit RSA key.

BPI/SEC is intended to allow cable service operators to refuse service to uncertified cable modems and unauthorized users. BPI+ strengthened service protection by adding digital certificate based authentication to its key exchange protocol, using a public key infrastructure (PKI), based on digital certificate authorities (CAs) of the certification testers, currently Excentis (formerly known as tComLabs) for EuroDOCSIS and CableLabs for DOCSIS. Typically, the cable service operator manually adds the cable modem&#x27;s MAC address to a customer&#x27;s account with the cable service operator; and the network allows access only to a cable modem that can attest to that MAC address using a valid certificate issued via the PKI. The earlier BPI specification (ANSI/SCTE ) had limited service protection because the underlying key management protocol did not authenticate the user&#x27;s cable modem.

Security in the DOCSIS network is vastly improved when only business critical communications are permitted, and end user communication to the network infrastructure is denied. Successful attacks often occur when the CMTS is configured for backward compatibility with early pre-standard DOCSIS 1.1 modems. These modems were &quot;software upgradeable in the field&quot;, but did not include valid DOCSIS or EuroDOCSIS root certificates.

<doc id="295985" wikidata="Q129050" url="?curid=295985" title="The Shangri-Las">
<text>The Shangri-Las were an American girl group of the 1960s, consisting of Mary Weiss, her sister Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Weiss and twin sisters Marguerite &quot;Marge&quot; Ganser and Mary Ann Ganser. Between 1964 and 1966 several hit pop songs of theirs documented teen tragedies and melodramas. They continue to be known for their hits &quot;Remember (Walking in the Sand)&quot;, &quot;Give Him a Great Big Kiss&quot;, and in particular, &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; which went to number 1 in the United States in late 1964. Following the death of Mary Weiss in 2024, her sister Betty is the only living member of the group.

==Early career==
The group was formed at Andrew Jackson High School in Cambria Heights, a neighborhood in Queens, New York City, in 1963. The group consisted of two pairs of sisters: Mary Weiss (lead singer) and Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Weiss, and identical twins Marguerite &quot;Marge&quot;/&quot;Margie&quot; Ganser and Mary Ann Ganser.

They began playing school shows, talent shows, and teen hops; Artie Ripp heard about them and arranged the group&#x27;s first record deal with Kama Sutra. Their first recording in December 1963 was &quot;Simon Says&quot;, later issued on the Smash label, on which Betty Weiss sang lead. They also recorded &quot;Wishing Well&quot; / &quot;Hate to Say I Told You So&quot;, which became their first release in early 1964 when leased to the small Spokane, Washington label.

Initially, the girls performed without a name for their group; however when they signed their first deal, they began to call themselves the Shangri-Las, after a restaurant in Queens. Some discographies list the Beatle-ettes and the Bon Bons, who both issued singles in 1964, as early versions of the Shangri-Las; however, they are different groups.

Mary Weiss was the main lead singer; Betty, however, took lead on &quot;Maybe&quot; (the LP version), &quot;Shout&quot;, &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, &quot;Wishing Well&quot;, and a number of B-sides and album tracks. Mary Ann Ganser took lead on most of &quot;I&#x27;m Blue&quot;, which is a cover of the Ikettes&#x27; biggest hit at the time, and was included on their 1965 album &quot;Shangri-Las-65!&quot; 

==Success at Red Bird Records==
In April 1964, while the girls were minors, their parents signed the quartet with Red Bird Records; Mary was 15, Betty was 17, and the Ganser twins were 16. Having been hired by record producer George &quot;Shadow&quot; Morton, they had their first success with the summer hit &quot;Remember (Walking in the Sand)&quot; (US #5, UK #14). Billy Joel, a then-unknown working as a session musician, played on the demo of &quot;Remember (Walkin&#x27; in the Sand)&quot;. The demo was nearly seven minutes long, too long for Top 40 radio. Morton had hired the group to perform on the demo, but Red Bird released a re-recorded version. Morton faded the new version out around 2:16.

The recordings for Morton featured lavish production with heavy orchestration and sound effects, and their next and biggest hit, &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; (U.S. #1, UK #11), climaxes with roaring motorcycles and breaking glass. UK re-issues peaked at #3 in 1972 and #7 in 1976. The song epitomized the &quot;death disc&quot;; songs with lyrics focusing on suicide, murders and fatal crashes, which were popular from the late 1950s until the mid-1960s. Jeff Barry described their songs as &quot;audio operas&quot; which &quot;makes you use your imagination.&quot;

After the sudden success of &quot;Remember (Walking in the Sand)&quot;, The Shangri Las were called upon to make personal appearances, which required them to leave high school. Mary, however, stayed on for classes at a high school for young professionals in Manhattan.

By the end of 1964, the group was an established act. They performed with the Beatles, a Fall 1964 tour with the Rolling Stones, and R&amp;B artists such as the Drifters and James Brown (who according to Mary Weiss was surprised to discover the girls were white). &quot;Cashbox&quot; magazine listed them as best new R&amp;B group of 1964. The group was also a fixture on the Murray the K shows at the Brooklyn Fox from 1964 to 1966. They also promoted Revlon cosmetics.

The Shangri-Las appeared as a quartet to promote &quot;Remember&quot;, starting with their stint on the 1964 Labor Day Murray the K show. In October 1964, Betty Weiss dropped out temporarily, leaving the group as a trio. She is still featured on the recording for &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot;, which was recorded prior to the release of &quot;Remember&quot;. The trio that remained went on to tour the US and also appeared on many TV shows, including &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, &quot;Shindig!&quot;, &quot;Hollywood a Go Go&quot;, and &quot;The Lloyd Thaxton Show&quot;. During October 1964, Mary and the Gansers did a short TV and Radio tour of the UK (their only UK appearances). Betty then rejoined the group in mid-1965 (her first return appearance with the Shangri-las was listed as a June 1965 &quot;Go Go&quot; episode hosted by Cousin Brucie in New York City), and the group appeared as a quartet once again until the start of 1966, when they permanently became a trio (Mary Ann and Marge left at different times, replacing each other until the demise of the group).

The group alternated between touring with their own band and local bands. Among the latter were the Sonics, as well as the Iguanas featuring a young Iggy Pop on drums and vocals. They also appeared as headliners on package tours such as Dick Clark&#x27;s Caravan of Stars, with R&amp;B acts like the Orlons and Joe Tex. Later in their career, the Shangri-Las performed several college dates with bands like the Young Rascals, the Animals, and Vanilla Fudge.

The Shangri-Las continued to chart with fairly successful U.S. hit records, specializing in adolescent themes such as alienation, loneliness, abandonment, and premature death. Singles included &quot;Give Him a Great Big Kiss&quot;, &quot;Out in the Streets&quot;, &quot;Give Us Your Blessings&quot;, the top ten hit &quot;I Can Never Go Home Anymore&quot;, &quot;Long Live Our Love&quot; (a rare example of a song dedicated to the men at the time fighting overseas in Vietnam), &quot;He Cried&quot; and the spoken-word &quot;Past, Present, and Future&quot;, featuring a musical backdrop inspired by Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot;. Noteworthy B-sides included &quot;Heaven Only Knows&quot;, &quot;The Train from Kansas City&quot;, &quot;Dressed in Black&quot; (featured in the Amy Winehouse biopic &quot;Back to Black&quot;) and &quot;Paradise&quot; (written by Harry Nilsson).

Popular songs include &quot;I Can Never Go Home Anymore&quot;, the story of a girl who leaves home for a boy; her pride keeps her from returning to her mother who &quot;grew so lonely in the end/the angels picked her for their friend&quot;. Lines from &quot;Give Him a Great Big Kiss&quot; include &quot;When I say I&#x27;m in love, you best believe I&#x27;m in love, L-U-V&quot;, and &quot;&quot;Well I hear he&#x27;s bad.&quot; &quot;Hmm, he&#x27;s good-bad, but he&#x27;s not evil.&quot;&quot; &quot;Past, Present, and Future&quot; has been said to be about rape, something Weiss disagrees with. She has said it is about &quot;teenage angst,&quot; heartbreak, and &quot;being hurt and angsty and not wanting anyone near you.&quot;

The Shangri-Las&#x27; &quot;tough girl&quot; persona set them apart from other girl groups. From a blue collar area of Queens, they were less demure than their contemporaries. Rumors about supposed escapades have since become legend; for example, the story that Mary Weiss attracted the attention of the FBI for transporting a firearm across state lines. In her defense, she said someone tried to break into her hotel room one night and for protection she bought a pistol. Whatever truth the stories may have, they were believed by fans in the 1960s, and they helped cement the group&#x27;s bad-girl reputation. According to Weiss, that persona helped fend off advances from musicians on tours.

==Disintegration and retirement==
The group appeared on several TV shows and continued to tour the US, but in 1966, two of three releases on Red Bird Records failed to crack the U.S. top 50, though the group remained popular in England and Japan. Mary Ann Ganser left, but returned early in 1967 when Marge – the most outspoken member, sometimes considered the leader – left. Red Bird Records had folded. The group recorded more tracks with Shadow Morton producing (some of which remain unreleased) and signed with Mercury Records. However, Morton had begun working with Janis Ian and Vanilla Fudge, and Mercury had little enthusiasm for the group. During their Mercury stint, the Shangri-Las had no further hits; in 1968, they disbanded, amid litigation.

All the Shangri-Las withdrew from the spotlight. Morton said, &quot;The Shangri-Las vacated, they vanished&quot;. Reportedly they were angry that they had received few royalties despite the millions of records they had sold.

Mary Weiss moved to New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village and then to San Francisco. Returning to Manhattan a few years later and prevented from recording because of lawsuits, she worked as a secretary while taking college classes. She then went into the architectural industry, working in the accounting department of a New York architectural firm. Weiss moved up to be the chief purchasing agent and later ran a commercial furniture dealership. In the late 1980s she managed a furniture store and was an interior designer. By 2001, she was a furniture consultant to New York businesses. 
She married in 1974, but the marriage ended in 1988; she married again several years later, and her second husband managed her music career until their divorce. In March 2007, Norton Records released a solo album by Mary Weiss (backed by garage rockers the Reigning Sound) titled &quot;Dangerous Game&quot;. She performed in the United States, Spain, and France. Mary Weiss died in Palm Springs, California on January 19, 2024, at age 75 of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and is survived by her third husband.

Mary Ann Ganser began to have problems with drug and alcohol addiction in 1968. She died in Queens on March 16, 1970, aged 22, of a drug overdose. (This may have been a heroin overdose as mentioned in a contemporary newspaper report and on her death certificate, or a barbiturate overdose as related later by her mother to a journalist.) Her death has been incorrectly reported as having been caused by encephalitis, or by a seizure disorder.

Marge Ganser reportedly returned to school in the late 1960s. By the early 1970s, she married (changing her name to Marguerite Ganser Dorste), worked for NYNEX in Valley Stream, New York, and died of breast cancer on July 28, 1996, at age 48.

Betty Weiss had a daughter in 1964, necessitating her absence from the group during this period. She was the only member of the group to have a child (who was raised with the help of Betty&#x27;s brother George Weiss, who died in 1998). Betty Weiss also married and held several jobs and now lives and works on Long Island.

The group declined offers to perform throughout the 1970s, although they did have a few live performances. Following the successful re-issue of &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; in the UK in 1976, which renewed interest in the group, Mary and Betty Weiss and Marge Ganser reunited. Contacting Seymour Stein of Sire Records, they spent summer 1977 in New York with producer Andy Paley. Paley said the sessions went well, but they weren&#x27;t satisfied with all the material, and declined to release the record. The tapes are now owned by the Warner Music Group. They did, however, give a live performance at CBGB; Paley put together a band, including Lenny Kaye, and after two hours of rehearsal, the Shangri-Las returned to the stage for the first time in a decade. Although the Sire sessions came to naught, the group toyed with signing to another label; however, they were put off by the insistence of record executives that they be a disco vocal group, the musical trend of the day. Mary said she envisioned the Shangri-Las like punk singer Patti Smith. Eventually, the Shangri-Las split up again.

Since the 1980s, a trio has been performing under the name the Shangri-Las, although unconnected with the original group. The copycat act was put together by Dick Fox, who claimed to have bought the rights to the name, and resulted in legal action from both sides, largely due to a video tape of the new Shangri-Las claiming in public to be the original group. The original group performed for the last time at a reunion show hosted by Cousin Brucie (Bruce Morrow) in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on June 3, 1989.

==Influence==
The streetwise image of the Shangri-Las – initially a promotional device for &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; – contrasted with other &quot;girl groups&quot; of the 1960s, and they were cited as an influence by 1970s punk rock-era acts such as the New York Dolls, Ramones and Blondie; the latter covered &quot;Out in the Streets&quot; twice. British punk band The Damned released their debut single, &quot;New Rose&quot;, in 1976. It was the first ever single released by a British punk band and the intro to the song featured a deadpan quote by singer Dave Vanian of the line &quot;Is she really going out with him?&quot; from &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot;.

Johnny Thunders covered &quot;Great Big Kiss&quot; on his 1978 solo album &quot;So Alone&quot;.

Aerosmith released a rock style version of &quot;Remember (Walking in the Sand)&quot; featuring uncredited backing vocals by Mary Weiss on their 1979 album, &quot;Night in the Ruts&quot;. The song was released as a single and charted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 67. It was also featured on their 1980 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album.

The Shangri-las were referenced by Paul McCartney in a &quot;McCartney II&quot; sessions track, &quot;Mr H Atom&quot;/&quot;You Know I&#x27;ll Get You Baby&quot;, recorded in 1979, but not released until 2011.

Scottish alternative rock band the Jesus and Mary Chain cited the Shangri-Las as an early influence. In 1985, the band&#x27;s guitarist William Reid stated: &quot;We all love the Shangri-Las, and one day we&#x27;re going to make Shangri-Las records.&quot;

The Shangri-Las are referenced in John Mellencamp&#x27;s 1985 single &quot;R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.&quot; from his third album &quot;Scarecrow&quot;.

Singer-songwriter Jim Steinman spoke on the influence The Shangri-Las had on him creating the all girl group Pandora&#x27;s Box during his video promotion for the 1989 album &quot;Original Sin&quot;.

In 1992, The Beach Boys recorded a cover of &quot;Remember (Walking in the Sand)&quot; on their poorly received album, &quot;Summer in Paradise&quot;.
In &quot;Revolution in the Head&quot;, music critic Ian MacDonald suggests the bridge of the Beatles&#x27; 1995 single &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; borrows from the verse of &quot;Remember (Walking in the Sand)&quot;; the lyric &quot;Whatever happened to/ the boy that I once knew&quot; becoming &quot;Whatever happened to/ the life that we once knew&quot;.

The Sonic Youth song &quot;Little Trouble Girl&quot; from their 1995 album &quot;Washing Machine&quot; was influenced by the Shangri-Las, and according to Kim Gordon &quot;was my ultimate homage to the Shangri-Las half singing, half speaking style.&quot; Gordon also noted in her 2015 memoir &quot;Girl in a Band&quot; that &quot;I was always a big fan of early songs by the Shangri-Las, with their whispered, almost spoken-word approach leading up to a violent climax, such as in &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; or &quot;I Can Never Go Home Anymore.&quot;

Kathleen Hanna of the electropunk group Le Tigre has mentioned that the &quot;one girl calling another&quot; motif and the opening sound of seagulls on the 1999 track &quot;What&#x27;s Yr Take on Cassavetes?&quot; were inspired by the Shangri-Las.

British singer Amy Winehouse cited the Shangri-Las as an influence for her second album &quot;Back to Black&quot; (2006) and occasionally integrated the hook lyrics from &quot;Remember (Walking in the Sand)&quot; into the bridge of her song &quot;Back to Black&quot; during live performances. Winehouse called &quot;I Can Never Go Home Anymore&quot; the &quot;saddest song in the world.&quot;

In the 2015 documentary &quot;Wider Horizons&quot;, David Gilmour, guitarist for Pink Floyd, cited the Shangri-Las as an influence, saying their music &quot;painted aural pictures&quot;.

While recording her 2017 album &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, American singer Lana Del Rey was heavily influenced by the Shangri-Las.

<text>The Dixie Cups (formerly known as The Meltones) are an American pop music girl group established in the 1960s. They are best known for a string of hits including their singles &quot;Chapel of Love&quot;, &quot;People Say&quot;, and &quot;Iko Iko&quot;.

==Career==
The group hit the top of the charts in 1964 with &quot;Chapel of Love,&quot; a song that Phil Spector, Jeff Barry, and Ellie Greenwich had originally written for The Ronettes. The trio consisted of sisters Barbara Ann and Rosa Lee Hawkins, plus their cousin Joan Marie Johnson, from New Orleans. They first sang together in grade school. Originally, they were to be called Little Miss and the Muffets, but were named the Dixie Cups just prior to their first release.

In 1963, the trio decided to pursue a professional career in music and began singing locally as the Meltones. Within a year Joe Jones, a successful singer in his own right with the Top Five 1960 single &quot;You Talk Too Much&quot;, became their manager. After working with them for five months, Jones took them to New York City, where record producers/songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller signed them to their new Red Bird Records label.

The Dixie Cups debut single was the release, &quot;Chapel of Love,&quot; which became their biggest hit, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Chart in June 1964. &quot;Chapel of Love&quot; sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. In 1987, the song &quot;Chapel of Love&quot; appeared on the &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; soundtrack and in the 1991 film &quot;Father of the Bride&quot;. The hit single by The Dixie Cups was ranked No. 279 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The group also had several other hits, including &quot;People Say&quot; (No. 12, 1964), &quot;You Should Have Seen the Way He Looked at Me&quot; (No. 39, 1964), &quot;Little Bell&quot; (No. 51, 1965), and &quot;Iko Iko&quot; (No. 20, 1965).
&quot;Iko Iko&quot;, a New Orleans traditional song, was recorded in 1964; however, it was released as a single early in 1965. Barbara Hawkins had heard her grandmother sing the song, first recorded in 1953 as &quot;Jock-a-Mo&quot; by James &quot;Sugar Boy&quot; Crawford. Barbara Hawkins stated that &quot;We were just clowning around with it during a session using drumsticks on ashtrays. We didn&#x27;t realize that Jerry and Mike had the tapes running&quot;. Leiber and Stoller overdubbed a bassline and percussion, and released it. It was The Dixie Cups&#x27; fifth and final hit.

In 1965, the Dixie Cups moved to the ABC-Paramount record label before a recording hiatus in 1966 temporarily halted their careers. In 1974, the Hawkins sisters moved from New York to New Orleans, where they both began successful modelling careers. Barbara Ann and Rosa Lee also worked as makeup artists. Joan Johnson retired from the group, unable to manage the stress of traveling. The Dixie Cups continued to tour as a trio with another New Orleans singer, Beverly Brown, replacing Joan Johnson who became a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness and left her music career. Brown, who had recorded two solo discs in the early 1960s, stayed as the third member until the early 1980s when she became ill and was replaced by Dale Mickle. The Dixie Cups continue to perform and make personal appearances. The current lineup consists of the Hawkins sisters (until Rosa Lee&#x27;s death in 2022) along with Athelgra Neville, sister of the singing Neville Brothers.

On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina swept through Louisiana, flooding much of New Orleans and displacing Barbara and Rosa Hawkins, who subsequently relocated to Florida. Joan Johnson relocated to Texas. Two years later, in April 2007, the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame honored The Dixie Cups as inductees for their contributions to Louisiana music.

Joan Marie Johnson died in New Orleans of congestive heart failure on October 3, 2016, at the age of 72. Rosa Lee Hawkins died from surgical complications on January 11, 2022, at the age of 76.

<doc id="295992" wikidata="Q6017766" url="?curid=295992" title="Indeterminacy debate in legal theory">
<text>The indeterminacy debate in legal theory can be summed up as follows: Can the law constrain the results reached by adjudicators in legal disputes? Some members of the critical legal studies movement — primarily legal academics in the United States — argued that the answer to this question is &quot;no.&quot; Another way to state this position is to suggest that disputes cannot be resolved with clear answers, and thus there is at least some amount of uncertainty in legal reasoning and its application to disputes. A given body of legal doctrine is said to be &quot;indeterminate&quot; by demonstrating that every legal rule in that body of legal doctrine is opposed by a counterrule that can be used in a process of legal reasoning.

The &quot;indeterminacy thesis&quot; emerged as a left reply to Ronald Dworkin&#x27;s &quot;right answer&quot; thesis. In its strongest form it is an extreme version of legal realism. It argues that nothing is law until it has been promulgated by an official - either a judge or the legislature. For example, a statute that says &quot;No person may smoke in a hospital&quot; does not mean that &quot;John Doe may not smoke in a hospital&quot;; the second statement is the law only if a legitimate authority declares so.

This is because one cannot describe a legal statement as right or wrong without making a normative value judgment about what the law should be.

In the 1990s the indeterminacy thesis came under heavy attack by liberal and conservative defenders of the rule of law, and the debate, though its mantle is in the process of being taken up by a new generation of scholars, has left the intellectual spotlight for the time being.

The thesis can be criticised because the concept of legal mistake is recognised in a determinative theory of law. While such a mistake necessarily involves a normative judgment, it is not truly subjective. A positivist Hartian theory contends that this judgment is conventionally objective, because the rule of recognition fails to recognise the mistake as legally valid. According to a liberal theory such as Dworkin&#x27;s, the normativity of the judgment is one of reason rather than of value.

<doc id="295993" wikidata="Q1140539" url="?curid=295993" title="Critical legal studies">
<text>Critical legal studies (CLS) is a school of critical theory that developed in the United States during the 1970s. CLS adherents claim that laws are devised to maintain the status quo of society and thereby codify its biases against marginalized groups.

Despite wide variation in the opinions of critical legal scholars around the world, there is general consensus regarding the key goals of critical legal studies:
* to demonstrate the ambiguity and possible preferential outcomes of supposedly impartial and rigid legal doctrines;
* to publicize historical, social, economic and psychological results of legal decisions;
* to demystify legal analysis and legal culture in order to impose transparency on legal processes so that they earn the general support of socially responsible citizens.
The abbreviations &quot;CLS&quot; and &quot;Crit&quot; are sometimes used to refer to the movement and its adherents.

==Influence==
Considered &quot;the first movement in legal theory and legal scholarship in the United States to have espoused a committed Left political stance and perspective,&quot; critical legal studies was committed to shaping society based on a vision of human personality devoid of the hidden interests and class domination that CLS scholars argued are at the root of liberal legal institutions in the West. According to CLS scholars Duncan Kennedy and Karl Klare, critical legal studies was &quot;concerned with the relationship of legal scholarship and practice to the struggle to create a more humane, egalitarian, and democratic society.&quot;

During its period of peak influence, the critical legal studies movement caused considerable controversy within the legal academy. Members such as Roberto Mangabeira Unger have sought to rebuild these institutions as &quot;fragmentary and imperfect expressions of an imaginative scheme of human coexistence rather than just as provisional truce lines in a brutal and amoral conflict.&quot; Such members were seen as the most powerful voices and the only way forward for the movement. Unger and other members of the movement continue to try to develop it in new directions, e.g., to make legal analysis the basis of developing institutional alternatives.

==History==
Although the intellectual origins of the critical legal studies (CLS) can be generally traced to American legal realism, as a distinct scholarly movement CLS fully emerged only in the late 1970s. Many first-wave American CLS scholars entered legal education, having been profoundly influenced by the experiences of the civil rights movement, women&#x27;s rights movement, and the anti-war movement of the 1960s and 1970s. What started off as a critical stance towards American domestic politics eventually translated into a critical stance towards the dominant legal ideology of modern Western society. Drawing on both domestic theory and the work of European social theorists, the &quot;crits&quot; sought to demystify what they saw as the numerous myths at the heart of mainstream legal thought and practice. The &quot;crits&quot; include Duncan Kennedy, Roberto Unger, Morton Horwitz, Mark Kelman, and Catharine MacKinnon.

The British critical legal studies movement started roughly at a similar time as its American counterpart. However, it centered around a number of conferences held annually, particularly the Critical Legal Conference and the National Critical Lawyers Group. There remain a number of fault lines in the community; between theory and practice, between those who look to Marxism and those who worked on Deconstruction, between those who look to explicitly political engagements and those who work in aesthetics and ethics.
In France, where the legal tradition had been closely guarded by law faculties and watched over by Napoleonic institutions such as the Court of Cassation, the Conseil d&#x27;Etat, and the Ecole Nationale de la Magistrature, famed sociologist Pierre Bourdieu caused an uproar when he released his &quot;La Force de la loi, élements pour une sociologie du champ juridique&quot; in 1986 - translated as &quot;The Force of Law: Toward a Sociology of the Juridical Field&quot;, in the Hastings Law Journal (1987). It heralded the beginning of continental Critical Legal Studies.

==Relation to American legal realism==

Critical legal studies had its intellectual origins in the American legal realist movement in the 1930s. Prior to the 1930s, American jurisprudence had been dominated by a formalist account of how courts decide cases, an account which held that judges decide cases on the basis of distinctly legal rules and reasons that justify a unique result. The legal realists argued that statutory and case law is indeterminate, and that appellate courts decide cases not based upon law, but upon what they deem fair in light of the facts of a case. Considered &quot;the most important jurisprudential movement of the 20th century&quot;, American legal realism sent a shock through American legal scholarship by undermining the formalist tenets that were long considered a bedrock of jurisprudence.

The influence of legal realism unsettled American jurisprudence for decades. Alan Hunt writes that the period &quot;between the realism of the 1930s and the emergence of critical legal studies in the late 1970s has been a series of unsuccessful attempts to recover from the shock of realism some basis for a legal theory which articulates an image of the objectivity of the legal process, even though the explanation offered by post-realism had to be more complex than that provided by a doctrine of rule-following.&quot;

==As a literature and a network==

The critical legal studies movement emerged in the mid-1970s as a network of leftist law professors in the United States who developed the realist indeterminacy thesis in the service of leftist ideals. According to Roberto Unger, the movement &quot;continued as an organized force only until the late 1980s. Its life as a movement lasted for barely more than a decade.&quot;

Duncan Kennedy, a Harvard law professor who along with Unger, was one of the key figures in the movement, has said that, in the early days of critical legal studies, &quot;just about everyone in the network was a white male with some interest in 60s style radical politics or radical sentiment of one kind or another. Some came from Marxist backgrounds — some came from democratic reform.&quot; Kennedy has emphasized the twofold nature of critical legal studies, as both a network of leftist scholar/activists and a scholarly literature:

[C]ritical legal studies has two aspects. It’s a scholarly literature and it has also been a network of people who were thinking of themselves as activists in law school politics. Initially, the scholarly literature was produced by the same people who were doing law school activism. Critical legal studies is not a theory. It’s basically this literature produced by this network of people. I think you can identify some themes of the literature, themes that have changed over time.

Scholars affiliated with critical legal studies often identified with the movement in several ways: by including in their articles an opening footnote mentioning the Conference on Critical Legal Studies and providing the organization&#x27;s contact information, by attending conferences of the CCLS, and by citing the work of fellow critical legal studies scholars. A 1984 bibliography of CLS works, compiled by Duncan Kennedy and Karl Klare and published in the Yale Law Journal, included dozens of authors and hundreds of works.

A 2011 collection of four volumes edited by Costas Douzinas and Colin Perrin, with the assistance of J-M Barreto, compiles the work of the British Critical Legal Studies, including their philosophical mentors. It showcases scholarship elaborated since its origins in the late 1980s in areas such as legal philosophy, literature, psychoanalysis, aesthetics, feminism, gender, sexuality, post-colonialism, race, ethics, politics and human rights.

Prominent participants in the CLS movement include Derrick Bell, Drucilla Cornell, Mary Joe Frug, Mark Kelman, Alan Hunt, Catharine MacKinnon, Paul O&#x27;Connell, Peter Fitzpatrick, Morton Horwitz, Jack Balkin, Costas Douzinas, Karl Klare, Peter Gabel, Roberto Unger, Renata Salecl, Mark Tushnet, Louis Michael Seidman, John Strawson and Martha Fineman.

==Intellectual and political context==

Roberto Unger, a key member of critical legal studies whose influence had continued to be far-reaching in the decades following the movement&#x27;s decline, has written that the founders of critical legal studies &quot;never meant it to become an ongoing school of thought or genre of writing. They wanted to intervene in a particular circumstance ...&quot;

That circumstance was the dominant practice of legal analysis which Unger calls the &quot;method of reasoned elaboration&quot;. A close descendant of nineteenth-century doctrinal formalism, which sought through legal analysis to identify the &quot;inbuilt legal content of a ... free society&quot;, the method of reasoned elaboration treated law materials as containing an &quot;ideal element&quot;, an inherent legal substance underlying the contradictions and ambiguities in the law&#x27;s text. Under the practice of reasoned elaboration, this inherent legal substance forms a prescriptive system that judges gradually uncover by reasoning through the policies and principles of law without questioning the &quot;basic institutional arrangements of the market economy, of democratic politics, and of civil society outside the market and the state&quot;.

Reasoned elaboration was a pernicious influence for several reasons, Unger and others argued: it de-emphasized the contingent nature of law as a product of deals and compromise, instead treating it as containing a coherent prescriptive system that needed simply to be uncovered by legal interpretation; it obscured how judges usurp authority by denying their own role in making law; and finally, reasoned elaboration inhibited the use of law as a mechanism of social change.

In addition to the context of legal interpretation, critical legal studies also emerged in response to its political context, namely a setting in which the social-democratic settlement that was finalized after World War II had become canonical, and active dispute over the organization of society severely declined, effectively enshrining a reigning consensus about social organization that Unger describes as including a &quot;combination of neoliberal orthodoxy, state capitalism, and compensatory redistribution by tax and transfer.&quot; Critical legal scholars challenged that consensus and sought to use legal theory as a means to explore alternative forms of social and political organization.

In accordance with the Critical rationalism the German jurist Reinhold Zippelius uses Popper&#x27;s method of &quot;trial and error&quot; in his &#x27;Legal Philosophy&#x27;.

==Themes==

Although the CLS (like most schools and movements) has not produced a single, monolithic body of thought, several common themes can be generally traced in its adherents&#x27; works. These include:
* A first theme is that contrary to the common perception, legal materials (such as statutes and case law) do not completely determine the outcome of legal disputes, or, to put it differently, the law may well impose many significant constraints on the adjudicators in the form of substantive rules, but, in the final analysis, this may often not be enough to bind them to come to a particular decision in a given particular case. Quite predictably, once made, this claim has triggered many lively debates among jurists and legal philosophers, some of which continue to this day (see further indeterminacy debate in legal theory).
* Secondly, there is the idea that all &quot;law is politics&quot;. This means that legal decisions are a form of political decision, but not that it is impossible to tell judicial and legislative acts apart. Rather, CLS have argued that while the form may differ, both are based around the construction and maintenance of a form of social space. The argument takes aim at the positivist idea that law and politics can be entirely separated from one another. A more nuanced view has emerged more recently. This rejects the reductivism of &#x27;all law is politics&#x27; and instead asserts that the two disciplines are mutually intertwined. There is no &#x27;pure&#x27; law or politics, but rather the two forms work together and constantly shift between the two linguistic registers.
* A third strand of the traditional CLS school is that far more often than is usually suspected the law tends to serve the interests of the wealthy and the powerful by protecting them against the demands of the poor and the subaltern (women, ethnic minorities, the working class, indigenous peoples, the disabled, homosexuals, etc.) for greater justice. This claim is often coupled with the legal realist argument that what the law says it does and what it actually tends to do are two different things. Many laws claim to have the aim of protecting the interests of the poor and the subaltern. In reality, they often serve the interests of the power elites. This, however, does not have to be the case, claim the CLS scholars. There is nothing intrinsic to the idea of law that should make it into a vehicle of social injustice. It is just that the scale of the reform that needs to be undertaken to realize this objective is significantly greater than the mainstream legal discourse is ready to acknowledge.
* Furthermore, CLS at times claims that legal materials are inherently contradictory, i.e. the structure of the positive legal order is based on a series of binary oppositions such as, for instance, the opposition between individualism and altruism or formal realizability (i.e. preference for strict rules) and equitable flexibility (i.e. preference for broad standards).
* Finally, CLS questions law&#x27;s central assumptions, one of which is the Kantian notion of the autonomous individual. The law often treats individual petitioners as having full agency vis-à-vis their opponents. They are able to make decisions based on reason that is detached from political, social, or economic constraints. CLS holds that individuals are tied to their communities, socio-economic class, gender, race, and other conditions of life such that they cease to be autonomous actors in the Kantian mode. Rather, their circumstances determine and therefore limit the choices presented to them. People are not &quot;free&quot;; they are instead determined in large part by social and political structures that surround them.

Increasingly, however, the traditional themes are being superseded by broader and more radical critical insights. Interventions in intellectual property law, human rights, jurisprudence, criminal law, property law, international law, etc., have proved crucial to the development of those discourses. Equally, CLS has introduced new frameworks to the legal field, such as postmodernism, queer theory, literary approaches to law, psychoanalysis, law and aesthetics, and post-colonialism.

==Continued influence==

Critical legal studies continues as a diverse collection of schools of thought and social movements. The CLS community is an extremely broad group with clusters of critical theorists at law schools and socio-legal studies departments such as Harvard Law School, Georgetown University Law Center, Northeastern University, University at Buffalo, Chicago-Kent College of Law, Birkbeck, University of London, University of New South Wales, University of Melbourne, University of Kent, Carleton University, Keele University, the University of Glasgow, the University of East London among others.

In the American legal academy its influence and prominence seems to have waned in recent years. However, offshoots of CLS, including critical race theory continue to grow in popularity. Associated schools of thought, such as fem-crit, contemporary feminist theory and ecofeminism and critical race theory now play a major role in contemporary legal scholarship. An impressive stream of CLS-style writings has also emerged in the last two decades in the areas of international and comparative law.

In addition, CLS has had a practical effect on legal education, as it was the inspiration and focus of Georgetown University Law Center&#x27;s alternative first year curriculum, (Termed &quot;Curriculum B&quot;, known as &quot;Section 3&quot; within the school). In the UK both Kent and Birkbeck have sought to draw critical legal insights into the legal curriculum, including a critical legal theory based LLM at Birkbeck&#x27;s School of Law. Various research centers and institutions offer CLS-based taught and research courses in a variety of legal fields including human rights, jurisprudence, constitutional theory and criminal justice.

In New Zealand, the University of Otago Legal Issues Centre was established at the university&#x27;s law faculty in 2007.

&quot;Law and Critique&quot; is one of the few UK journals that specifically identifies itself with critical legal theory. In America, &quot;The Crit&quot; and &quot;&quot; are the only journals that continue to explicitly position themselves as platforms for critical legal studies. However, other journals such as &quot;Law, Culture and the Humanities&quot;, the &quot;Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review&quot;, &quot;The National Lawyers Guild Review&quot;, &quot;Social and Legal Studies&quot;, and &quot;The Australian Feminist Law Journal&quot; all published avowedly critical legal research.

==Criticism==
The stance &quot;law is politics&quot; of Critical legal studies has been criticized for rejecting the distinction between political argument and legal argument. Critical legal studies has been criticized as attacking the rule of law and separation of powers. The indeterminacy thesis stance by Critical legal studies has been criticized to not distinguish between the strong and weak indeterminacy thesis. The strong indeterminacy thesis has been argued by some to be incorrect due to the existence of easy legal cases where some outcomes cannot be legally correct. Constitutionalism argues that the authority of government is limited by constitutional law&quot;, in contrast to Critical legal studies, which disputes the constraints by constitution.

<text>The Squadron Supreme is a superhero team appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, of which there are several notable alternate versions. The original team was created by Roy Thomas and John Buscema, derived from the previously created supervillain team Squadron Sinister.

The core members of the Squadron Supreme are Hyperion, Nighthawk, Doctor Spectrum, Power Princess, and the Whizzer, pastiches of prominent members of rival publisher DC Comics&#x27; superhero team the Justice League. Many other characters were later added to the roster, not all of which were based on DC heroes.

==Publication history==
The Squadron Supreme has its roots in the Squadron Sinister, which first appeared in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #69 as a pastiche of the Justice League. Roy Thomas later introduced a heroic version of the Squadron Sinister named the Squadron Supreme, which first appeared in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #85–86 (Feb.–March 1971), and which was co-created with John Buscema. The team then had guest appearances on several more occasions, and in 1985 was featured in a self-titled twelve-issue limited series by Mark Gruenwald, followed in 1989 by a graphic novel sequel by Gruenwald, Ryan and inker Al Williamson, &quot;Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe&quot;, in which the Nth Man serves as the main antagonist.

In 2003, a reimagined Squadron Supreme appeared in an ongoing series entitled &quot;Supreme Power&quot;, published under the mature-audience MAX imprint. This version was created by writer J. Michael Straczynski and artist Gary Frank.

Yet another Squadron Supreme was introduced in 2015, written by James Robinson and drawn by Leonard Kirk. Unlike the previous teams, which had appeared in alternate realities, this team was based in Marvel&#x27;s main &quot;Earth-616&quot; reality, although the team members were from a variety of alternate universes that had been destroyed in the aftermath of the 2015 &quot;Secret Wars&quot; event.

Another version of the Squadron Supreme, set in the Marvel Universe, was introduced by Jason Aaron in &quot;The Avengers&quot; vol. 8. The Squadron, created by Mephisto and led by Phil Coulson, acts as the US government&#x27;s sanctioned superhero team in place of the Avengers. This version of the team is the focus of the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; storyline, where reality is overwritten so that the Avengers were never formed and the Squadron Supreme are Earth&#x27;s premier superhero team instead.

==Fictional history==
===Earth-712 version===
The Squadron Supreme are first encountered by four members of the Avengers – the Vision, Quicksilver, the Scarlet Witch and Goliath – who have arrived in the Earth-712 universe by mistake. The Avengers are initially confused, since several members of the Squadron Supreme have identical names and powers to the Squadron Sinister, a group of previously encountered villains. After a brief battle, the Avengers assist the Squadron Supreme against the global threat posed by the mutant Brain-Child, before returning to their own universe. The Squadron Supreme have another series of skirmishes with the Avengers engineered by the group the Serpent Cartel, but eventually they join forces and prevent the use of the Serpent Crown.

The team features briefly in the title &quot;Thor&quot;, when the evil version of Hyperion attacks the Earth-712 version and then the Earth-616 Thor. The Squadron appear in the title &quot;The Defenders&quot; as mind-controlled pawns of the entities the Over-Mind and Null the Living Darkness, but are freed and aid the Defenders in defeating the villains. Earth-712, however, is left in a post-apocalyptic state.

The Squadron Supreme were next featured in a self-titled 12-issue limited series (Sept. 1985–Aug. 1986) by writer Mark Gruenwald, which picks up from where Earth-712 was last seen in &quot;The Defenders&quot; #114. The Squadron, led by Hyperion, believe they have the knowledge and power to recreate the world and create a utopia. Nighthawk protests, believing that the Squadron should serve and not rule. The issue is put to a vote, with the so-called &quot;Utopia Program&quot; favored by the majority of the Squadron; Nighthawk, unable to agree with the decision in clear conscience, resigns from the team. The Squadron assume overall control of the government of the United States and remake the nation into a virtual utopia. The team implement a series of sweeping changes, including revealing their secret identities; instituting a program of behavior modification in prisons where inmates are forced to submit to a process that mentally inhibits their criminal instincts; enforcing a strict gun control policy; and developing medical technology to cryogenically preserve the dead, while opposed by the future dictator (and usurper) of mankind Victorex Prime (formerly the Scarlet Centurion), serving as the main antagonist.

Despite the economic and technological advances, there are setbacks: the Golden Archer abuses the behavior modification technology by forcing fellow member Lady Lark to love him, resulting in his eventual removal from the team; the Amphibian becomes increasingly disgusted with the Squadron&#x27;s methods and abandons the surface world altogether; Nuke inadvertently kills his parents via unnoticed and uncontrollable release of radiation and dies while battling Doctor Spectrum during a rampage; and Tom Thumb discovers he has cancer but chooses not to inform his teammates, eventually succumbing to the disease.

At one point, the team is attacked by the Institute of Evil on the behalf of Victorex Prime. The Squadron ultimately defeats the Institute and uses the behavior modification technology to reform them, adding the former supervillains as members. Three of them die or are incapacitated.

In the meantime, Nighthawk forms a new team he calls the America Redeemers, recruiting former villains and several previously unknown superhumans. The later infiltrate the Squadron and kidnap the surviving Institute members to reverse the behavior modification on them. Despite mixed feelings on the parts of several of the Institute members, they too join the Redeemers. Former Squadron member the Golden Archer (now known as the Black Archer) also joins.

Eventually, the Redeemers confront the Squadron Supreme. A brutal battle ensues in which several members of both teams are killed, including Nighthawk. A horrified Hyperion realizes that Nighthawk was right: the Squadron, despite having good intentions, had inadvertently created a totalitarian state with themselves as its dictators. The Squadron surrenders, disbands and returns control of the United States to the government.

In a graphic novel sequel by Gruenwald, Ryan and inker Al Williamson, &quot;Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe&quot;, remnants of the team and their former enemies (including Victorex Prime) reunite to battle the Nth Man. Although they succeed, several members of the Squadron are killed, with the remainder (Hyperion, Doctor Spectrum, the Whizzer, Power Princess, Lady Lark (now known as Skylark), Arcanna, Haywire, and the Shape) marooned in the mainstream Marvel universe.

The Squadron encounter the hero Quasar, and relocate to the government facility Project Pegasus. After another encounter with the Overmind and a visit to the laboratory world of the Stranger, the Squadron attempt unsuccessfully to return to their own universe and members Hyperion, Doctor Spectrum and the Whizzer battle the entity the Deathurge.

The entire Squadron Supreme appear in an &quot;Avengers&quot; storyline with the Avengers that finally returns them to their home universe. The one-shot issue &quot;Squadron Supreme: New World Order&quot; reveals that Earth-712 is now dominated by corporations using the Squadron&#x27;s own utopia technologies.

The Squadron come into conflict with a new government when an interdimensional team called the Exiles, traveling from the Earth-616 universe, reveal that the government had rigged the election through worldwide vote fraud. The Squadron and the Exiles depose the new government and attempt to allow society to progress without superhuman involvement.

===Earth-31916 version===
====&quot;Supreme Power&quot;====
The series &quot;Supreme Power&quot; features the rebooted version of the superhero team Squadron Supreme and is set on Earth-31916.

Alien Hyperion arrives on Earth as an infant, and is taken into custody by the US government and raised in a controlled environment. Army Corporal Joseph Ledger is given a strange crystal removed from Hyperion&#x27;s spaceship by the government that bonds to him, causing him to fall into a coma for years.

Discovering Hyperion has superhuman abilities, the government uses him as a secret weapon, and is eventually outed by the media. The government then announces and introduces Hyperion as a state-sponsored hero, which encourages other beings to appear, such as the Blur, who can move at superspeed. Ledger awakens and, harnessing the energy powers of the crystal, becomes Doctor Spectrum. Hyperion and Spectrum are initially hostile to one another and they battle, with Hyperion accessing lost memories when coming in contact with Spectrum&#x27;s crystal. The Amphibian is seen on dry land for the first time, and Princess Zarda heals Hyperion after his battle. Nighthawk solicits the aid of Hyperion and the Blur to deal with a superpowered serial killer, who Hyperion now knows is actually the product of experimentation with his DNA.

Although successful, Hyperion is outraged by the government exploitation and leaves, warning that he has no wish to be contacted by humankind again. The government gathers the remaining superhumans into a team to capture Hyperion.

The story continues in the limited series &quot;Supreme Power: Hyperion&quot; with new Squadron members Emil Burbank, Arcanna, the Shape and Nuke tracking Hyperion to what they believe is an alternate reality. In this world, Hyperion and a version of the Squadron rule the world, with only Nighthawk and a small group of superhumans opposing their rule. Although the heroes locate the true Hyperion and convince him to return to their world, Burbank discovers that it was, in fact, not an alternate reality but their world two years from the present time.

====Second &quot;Squadron Supreme&quot; title====
The second volume of the series &quot;Squadron Supreme&quot; brings together all the superhumans (except a reluctant Nighthawk), who are split into two teams – one for international/public missions and another for covert operations. The President of the United States calls the group the Squadron Supreme. The Squadron meets with mixed success: an attempt to kill an African dictator is botched, and the target is murdered by local superhumans who state the group is not welcome in Africa, and a mission to Iran has member Inertia encouraging a victim to fight back and kill. 

China recruits Redstone, the superpowered serial killer created from Hyperion&#x27;s DNA, in a bid to protect itself. The final issue is a battle to the death against Redstone (with the Blur recruiting Nighthawk to assist) who threatens to detonate a nuclear weapon. The outcome is not revealed, as the series concluded with issue #7.

====&quot;Ultimate Power&quot;====
An unrelated nine-issue series, &quot;Ultimate Power&quot;, written by J. Michael Straczynski; Brian Michael Bendis and Jeph Loeb with art by Greg Land, features the Squadron in a crossover into the Ultimate Universe. Courtesy of a deception engineered by Nick Fury and the Ultimate villain Doctor Doom, the Squadron travel to the Ultimate Universe, thinking that the Ultimate Reed Richards is responsible for releasing an organism that has destroyed much of the United States.

A series of misunderstandings ensues, and after a series of battles between the Squadron, the Ultimate Fantastic Four, the Ultimates and the Earth-712 Squadron Supreme (whose world was also affected by the organism), the third culprit is revealed as Burbank, who was asked by the government to develop a weapon to kill Hyperion. Nick Fury is detained in custody in the Earth-31916 universe, while Squadron member Power Princess remains in the Ultimate Universe to ensure that Doom (who escaped custody by using a Doombot) is captured.

====&quot;Squadron Supreme: Hyperion vs. Nighthawk&quot;====
An unrelated four-issue limited series, &quot;Squadron Supreme: Hyperion vs. Nighthawk&quot;, written by Marc Guggenheim and with art by Paul Gulacy, relates how Hyperion and Nighthawk, after an initial skirmish, join forces to try and alleviate the Darfur conflict in war-torn Sudan. Hyperion discovers Nighthawk has a prototype weapon built from stolen plans of Emil Burbank&#x27;s journal that cannot actually injure him, but can convince him that he is being injured.

====Third &quot;Squadron Supreme&quot; title====
A third volume of the title &quot;Squadron Supreme&quot;, written by Howard Chaykin and with art by Greg Land (and other artists), is published, with the 12-issue series being set five years after the battle with Redstone. Most of the Squadron have disappeared, with Ultimate Nick Fury, Burbank and Arcanna now a team of intelligence officers working for the government and investigating a group of returning astronauts that exhibit strange abilities. The astronauts infect many people they come into contact with, also giving them superhuman abilities.

Fury eventually leads a new version of the Squadron that features characters who are pastiches of long-time Marvel characters. The group eventually come into conflict with many of the original members of the Squadron who have been gathered by Hyperion. The heroes unite to stop a group of superhuman terrorists from the Middle East, but then, via a government device, apparently all lose their abilities. Arcanna secretly reveals to Fury that she, and likely many others, still possesses superhuman abilities. Fury later returns to the Ultimate Universe.

====Later appearances====
Later, the members of the Squadron Supreme are apparently killed by Namor the Sub-Mariner and the Cabal after the villains raid the Squadron&#x27;s universe. Versions resembling these characters later appear on the Battleworld created by Doctor Doom during the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; event, only to be killed again at the hands of the Squadron Sinister. Nighthawk is left as the group&#x27;s only survivor.

===Earth-616 version===
This team, set in Marvel&#x27;s mainstream reality, features characters from numerous alternate universes, such as the Nighthawk from &quot;Supreme Power&quot;, a Hyperion from a reality that had been destroyed upon colliding with another universe, Doctor Spectrum from the world of the Great Society (which was destroyed by Namor the Sub-Mariner to prevent it from colliding with the mainstream universe), the Blur from the New Universe, and Warrior Woman from a &quot;Secret Wars&quot; tie-in (posing as the Earth-712 Squadron Supreme&#x27;s Power Princess).

The Squadron Supreme&#x27;s first action was to get revenge on Namor for what happened to the worlds of some of its members. They attacked Atlantis where Hyperion beheaded Namor and Zarda killed Attuma. The fight ended with Hyperion lifting Atlantis above the ocean and throwing it onto the ground hard enough to kill the remaining Atlanteans present. The actions caused by the Squadron Supreme led the Avengers Unity Division to apprehend them before anyone else ends up killed by their hand. The Squadron Supreme were saved by Thundra and later teleported to Weirdworld, where they encounter Doctor Druid, who plans to mind-control Weirdworld&#x27;s inhabitants. The Squadron Supreme shatter the crystal that Druid was using to enhance his mind control powers and return home. Power Princess remains on Weirdworld and reveals herself as Warrior Woman. Thundra sides with the Squadron Supreme, although she is unsure if she should help the Squadron Supreme protect the world or help protect the world from the Squadron Supreme.

Through Modred the Mystic&#x27;s magical modifications to Reed Richard&#x27;s time machine, Hyperion and Doctor Spectrum are accidentally transformed into ephemeral &quot;ghosts&quot; caught in the past; specifically during the Squadron&#x27;s attack on Atlantis and just before Hyperion kills Namor. They decide to change the past by dragging this past Namor back to the present, thereby resurrecting him. Although this action is easy for Hyperion, who has had second thoughts about the cutthroat methods the Squadron Supreme has been using, it is more difficult for Doctor Spectrum, as Namor destroyed her Earth. At the end of the story arc, Hyperion leads the action to disband the Squadron, and the team goes their separate ways.

===Squadron Supreme of America===
When the Avengers become a global peacekeeping force, Thunderbolt Ross meets with Phil Coulson to discuss the matter. Phil reveals that he has established the Squadron Supreme of America as the newest United States superhero team. The team consists of Hyperion, Power Princess, Nighthawk, the Blur, and Doctor Spectrum as their leader.

With Doctor Spectrum as their leader, the Squadron Supreme of America were first used to fight Namor and his Defenders of the Deep when they attacked a Roxxon oil rig that is off the coast of Alaska.

Then the Squadron Supreme visited another oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico, where Doctor Spectrum used his powers to melt areas of the oil rig to secure it from an attack by Namor. The Squadron Supreme then made short work of Namor and the Defenders of the Deep.

During the &quot;War of the Realms&quot; storyline, the Squadron Supreme of America were summoned to Washington D.C. by Phil Coulson, who brought them up to speed on Malekith&#x27;s invasion. They are shown fighting Rock Trolls and Frost Giants. Their origin is fully shown where its members are revealed to be simulacrums created by Mephisto and programmed by the Power Elite so that Phil Coulson can have them be a United States-sponsored superhero team. After the Squadron Supreme caused the Frost Giants to retreat, Phil Coulson sends them to Ohio which has become a battleground.

The Squadron Supreme are summoned to confront Black Panther when he infiltrates the Pentagon and confronts Phil Coulson. Hyperion states that the Squadron Supreme are the United States&#x27; sanctioned superhero team in light of the Avengers becoming an anti-American team. As Nighthawk states to Blur that the Black Panther will not run as he is under arrest, the Black Panther states to them that he does not know how they got their powers and that they are not the Squadron Supreme, as he even asked if they trust Phil Coulson. Before they can grab him, the Black Panther contacts Broo to teleport him away. As he disappears, the Black Panther states that Phil Coulson will not answer their questions and that the Avengers are not their enemies unless they force them to be.

During the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; storyline, reality has been somehow changed so that the Squadron Supreme of America are the America&#x27;s premier superhero team and that the Avengers never existed. The Squadron Supreme are seen fighting the Masters of Doom consisting of Doctor Juggernaut, Black Skull, Silver Witch and All-Gog after their escape from the Negative Zone. The Squadron Supreme manages to repel the Masters of Doom with the fight being witnessed by President Phil Coulson. The Skrullian Skymaster was shown to be a member of this reality&#x27;s Squadron Supreme before he was killed by Rogue to avenge Mystique&#x27;s death. Nighthawk and Blur had a Secret Squadron team that consisted of Tom Thumb (who is an amalgam of both versions), Amphibian, Blue Eagle, Golden Archer, and Arcanna Jones. This group fought the Siege Society in London where Amphibian was beheaded by Baron Helmut Zemo, Golden Archer was killed by Hawkeye and Fire-Ant, Tom Thumb was subdued by Hawkeye, Arcanna Jones was killed by Silver Witch, and Golden Eagle was slain offscreen by Black Widow and Hawkeye who escape with Fire Ant using his special wings. Following the fight, Nighthawk, Blur, and Tom Thumb mourn their comrades at their funeral. The Squadron Supreme of America discuss their encounters with various heroes and concerns about their world being wrong. Putting aside their differences and without telling President Coulson, they gather clues and rule out suspects before eventually arriving in Wakanda, where they confront the Avengers. The Avengers battle and eventually defeat the Squadron Supreme of America. After Captain America, Star Brand, and Echo use the Pandemonium Cube to restore the original reality, the Squadron Supreme of America find their memories transferred to their counterparts in the Avengers&#x27; reality and struggle to find their place in an unfamiliar world.

Doctor Spectrum led Power Princess and Blur on a mission to arrest Red Widow. In a turn of events, Power Princess killed Doctor Spectrum and took his Power Prism as it is shown that Red Widow is working on brainwashing Hyperion.

<text>Daniel Louis Aiello Jr. () (June 20, 1933 – December 12, 2019) was an American actor. He appeared in numerous motion pictures, including &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974), &quot;The Front&quot; (1976), &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; (1984), &quot;Hide in Plain Sight&quot; (1984), &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot; (1985), &quot;Moonstruck&quot; (1987), &quot;Harlem Nights&quot; (1989), &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; (1989), &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; (1990), &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot; (1991), &quot;Ruby&quot; (1992), &quot;Léon: The Professional&quot; (1994), &quot;2 Days in the Valley&quot; (1996), &quot;Dinner Rush&quot; (2000), and &quot;Lucky Number Slevin&quot; (2006). He played Don Domenico Clericuzio in the miniseries &quot;The Last Don&quot; (1997).

Aiello was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Salvatore &quot;Sal&quot; Frangione in the Spike Lee film &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; (1989).

== Early life ==
Aiello, the fifth of six children, was born on West 68th Street, Manhattan, the son of parents Frances Pietrocova, a seamstress from Naples, Italy, and Daniel Louis Aiello, a laborer who deserted the family after his wife lost her eyesight and became legally blind. For many years, Aiello publicly condemned his father, but the two reconciled in 1993, although Aiello harbored a resentment of his father&#x27;s conduct. He was of Italian descent. He moved to the South Bronx when he was seven, and later attended James Monroe High School.

At the age of 16, Aiello lied about his age to enlist in the United States Army. After serving for three years, he returned to New York City and did various jobs in order to support himself and, later, his family.

In the 1960s, Aiello served as president of New York Local 1202 of the Amalgamated Transit Union, representing Greyhound Bus workers. In 1967, he presided over an unsanctioned wildcat strike when the company changed bus driver schedules. The strike was called without authorization by the parent union and he was suspended for that action. He called off the strike after one day.

He was also a bouncer at the legendary New York City comedy club, The Improv. In the mid-1980s, he was a nightly regular at Café Central, a bistro frequented by celebrities on 79th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, in Manhattan, and at an eatery named Columbus restaurant on 66th Street and Columbus Avenue.

== Career ==
===Film and television===
Aiello broke into films in the early 1970s. One of his earliest roles came as a ballplayer in the baseball drama, &quot;Bang the Drum Slowly&quot; (1973), with Robert De Niro. Aiello had a walk-on role as small-time hood Tony Rosato in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974), ad-libbing the line &quot;Michael Corleone says hello!&quot; during a hit on rival gangster Frank Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo).

Aiello had a co-lead role with Jan-Michael Vincent in &quot;Defiance&quot; (1980), about some Manhattan residents who fight back against the thugs terrorizing the neighborhood. He received considerable acclaim for playing a racist New York City cop in &quot;Fort Apache, The Bronx&quot; (1981) with Paul Newman. In 1981, Aiello won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in Children&#x27;s Programming for his appearance in an &quot;ABC Afterschool Special&quot; called &quot;A Family of Strangers&quot;.

He was paired with De Niro again for the Sergio Leone gangster epic, &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; (1984), as a police chief whose name was also &quot;Aiello.&quot; His many film appearances included two for director Woody Allen, who cast him in &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot; (1985), and &quot;Radio Days&quot; (1987). He played a main role in the 1985-86 television series &quot;Lady Blue&quot;.

Aiello played the pizzeria owner Sal in Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; (1989). At the time of the film&#x27;s release, in an interview with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, he called the role his &quot;first focal part&quot;. He further identified the film as a very collaborative effort, during which Spike Lee at one point told him, &quot;Whatever you wanna do, you do.&quot; Aiello went on to write a crucial scene he shared with John Turturro ten minutes prior to its production. The role earned him nominations for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, while the film critics&#x27; associations of Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles each named him best supporting actor.

Aiello also portrayed more sympathetic characters. He gained recognition as the befuddled fiancé of Cher opposite her Oscar-winning performance in the romantic comedy &quot;Moonstruck&quot; (1987), and made a comic appearance in drag for the Robert Altman fashion-industry film &quot;Prêt-à-Porter&quot; (1994). He also had sympathetic roles in the horror thriller &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; (1990) and the comedy-drama &quot;29th Street&quot; (1991).

Aiello played nightclub owner and Lee Harvey Oswald assassin Jack Ruby in the biopic &quot;Ruby&quot; (1992), the lead role in Paul Mazursky&#x27;s film business satire &quot;The Pickle&quot; (1993), the titular character in the Academy Award-winning short film &quot;Lieberman in Love&quot; (1995), and a political big shot with mob ties in &quot;City Hall&quot; (1996), starring Al Pacino. He later starred in the independent feature film &quot;Dolly Baby&quot; (2012), written and directed by Kevin Jordan; Aiello also starred in Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Brooklyn Lobster&quot;, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2005.

=== Music ===
Aiello&#x27;s singing was on display in films such as &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot; (1991), &quot;Once Around&quot; (1991), and &quot;Remedy&quot; (2005) that starred his son Ricky Aiello and Jonathan Doscher. He released several albums featuring a big-band including &quot;I Just Wanted to Hear The Words&quot; (2004), &quot;Live from Atlantic City&quot; (2008), and &quot;My Christmas Song for You&quot; (2010). Aiello and EMI songwriter Hasan Johnson released an album of standards fused with rap entitled &quot;Bridges&quot; in 2011.

He played the father for the video of Madonna&#x27;s song, &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; (1986), and recorded his own answer song, &quot;Papa Wants the Best for You&quot;, written by Artie Schroeck.

=== Theater ===
Aiello appeared on the Broadway stage many times throughout the 1970s and 1980s. He appeared in three plays by Louis La Russo II: &quot;Lamppost Reunion&quot; (his Broadway debut - 1975), &quot;Wheelbarrow Closers&quot; (1976), and &quot;Knockout&quot; (1979). In 1977, he originated the role of Fran Geminiani in the long-running play &quot;Gemini&quot;.

In 1981, Aiello starred in Woody Allen&#x27;s play &quot;The Floating Light Bulb&quot; alongside Beatrice Arthur. The play, set in 1945, is a semi-autobiographical tale of a lower middle class family living in Brooklyn, New York City. Frank Rich, critic from &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the play a mild review, writing &quot;there are a few laughs, a few well-wrought characters, and, in Act II, a beautifully written scene that leads to a moving final curtain&quot;. Rich also compared the play to the work of Tennessee Williams.

In the mid-1980s, Aiello starred in a replacement cast version of &quot;Hurlyburly&quot; (1984) alongside Christine Baranski, Frank Langella, Ron Silver, and Candice Bergen. He also starred in &quot;The House of Blue Leaves&quot; (1986) alongside John Mahoney (who earned a Tony Award for his performance), Ben Stiller, Stockard Channing, and Julie Hagerty.

In 2002, Aiello starred in Elaine May&#x27;s comedic play, &quot;Adult Entertainment&quot; alongside May&#x27;s daughter, Jeannie Berlin. The play was directed by Stanley Donen and opened off-broadway at the Variety Arts Theatre. Critic Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, described the play as an &quot;often very funny, but overstretched comedy sketch&quot;.

In July 2011, Aiello appeared Off-Broadway in the two-act drama &quot;The Shoemaker&quot;, written by Susan Charlotte and directed by Antony Marsellis. The play is a stage version of his 2006 movie &quot;A Broken Sole&quot;, which began life in 2001 as a one-act play.

== Personal life ==
Aiello lived in Ramsey, New Jersey, for many years with his wife, Sandy Cohen, whom Aiello married in 1955. He later moved to Saddle River, New Jersey.

In 2014, Aiello published his autobiography, &quot;I Only Know Who I Am When I Am Somebody Else: My Life on the Street, on the Stage, and in the Movies&quot; via Simon &amp; Schuster. He was the father of stuntman and actor Danny Aiello III, who died in 2010 of pancreatic cancer. Another son Rick, who was also an actor, died in 2021 of the same disease. His surviving children are Jaime, and Stacey Aiello. His nephew is Michael Kay, broadcaster for the New York Yankees.

===Death===
Aiello died on December 12, 2019, at age 86, at a hospital in New Jersey, following a brief illness.

Many in the entertainment industry voiced their sadness either on Twitter or released statements, such as his &quot;Moonstruck&quot; co-star Cher, and Robert De Niro, who starred alongside Aiello in four films: &quot;Bang the Drum Slowly&quot; (1973), &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974), &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; (1984), and &quot;Mistress&quot; (1992). De Niro wrote, &quot;I am very saddened to hear of Danny&#x27;s passing. I have known him for almost 50 years. See you in Heaven, Danny.&quot;

<doc id="295998" wikidata="Q211749" url="?curid=295998" title="Désirée Clary">
<text>Bernardine Eugénie Désirée Clary (; 8 November 1777 – 17 December 1860) was Queen of Sweden and Norway from 5 February 1818 to 8 March 1844 as the wife of King Charles XIV John. Charles John was a French general and founder of the House of Bernadotte. Désirée Clary, the mother of Oscar I, was the one-time fiancée of Napoleon Bonaparte. Her name was officially changed in Sweden to Desideria although she did not use that name.

==Background and education==
Désirée Clary was born in Marseille, France, the daughter of François Clary (Marseille, St. Ferreol, 24 February 1725 – Marseille, 20 January 1794), a wealthy silk manufacturer and merchant, by his second wife (m. 26 June 1759) Françoise Rose Somis (Marseille, St. Ferreol, 30 August 1737 – Paris, 28 January 1815). &quot;Eugénie&quot; was normally used as her name of address. Her father had been previously married, at Marseille on 13 April 1751, to Gabrielle Fléchon (1732 – 3 May 1758). 

Clary had a sister and brother to whom she remained very close all her life. Her sister, Julie Clary, married Joseph Bonaparte; she later became Queen of Naples and Spain. Her brother, Nicolas Joseph Clary, was created Count Clary. He married Anne Jeanne Rouyer, by whom he had a daughter named Zénaïde Françoise Clary (Paris, 25 November 1812 – Paris, 27 April 1884). Zénaïde would marry Napoléon Alexandre Berthier (the son of Marshal Louis Alexandre Berthier) and have several children, among them the first wife of Joachim, 4th Prince Murat.
As a child, Clary received the convent schooling usually given to daughters of the upper classes in pre-revolutionary France. However, when she was barely 11 years old, the French Revolution (starting in 1789) took place, during which convents were closed. Clary returned to live with her parents, where she was perforce home-schooled thereafter. Later, her education was described as shallow. It has been observed by several historians that Clary was devoted to her birth-family her entire life.

==Meeting the Bonapartes==
In 1794, Clary&#x27;s father died. Shortly after, it was discovered that in the years before the revolution, he had made an appeal to be ennobled, a request that had been denied. Because of this, Désirée Clary&#x27;s brother Etienne, now the head of the family and her guardian, was arrested. Désirée Clary went to talk on his behalf and seek his release from the holding. In the process, she met Joseph Bonaparte, inviting him back to their home. Joseph was soon engaged to her elder sister Julie, while Napoleon was engaged to Désirée Clary on 21 April 1795. In 1795–1797, Clary lived with her mother in Genoa in Italy, where her brother-in-law Joseph had a diplomatic mission; they were also joined by the Bonaparte family. In 1795, Napoleon became involved with Joséphine de Beauharnais and broke the engagement to Clary on 6 September. He married Joséphine in 1796.

In 1797, Clary went to live in Rome with her sister Julie and her brother-in-law Joseph, who was French ambassador to the Papal States. Her relationship with Julie remained close. She was briefly engaged to Mathurin-Léonard Duphot, a French general. The engagement has been assumed to be Napoleon&#x27;s idea to compensate her with a marriage, while Duphot was attracted to her dowry and position as sister-in-law of Napoleon. She agreed to the engagement though Duphot had a long-term relationship and a son with another woman. On 30 December 1797, on the eve of their marriage, Duphot was killed in an anti-French riot outside of their residence Palazzo Corsini in Rome. In later years, Clary vehemently denied that her engagement to Duphot had ever existed.

==Madame Bernadotte==

After her return to France, Clary lived with Julie and Joseph in Paris. In Paris, she lived in the circle of the Bonaparte family, who sided with her against Josephine after Napoleon had broken off their engagement. She herself did not like Josephine either, as she has been quoted calling her an aged courtesan with a deservedly bad reputation, but she is not believed to have shown any hostility toward Josephine as did the members of the Bonaparte family. She received a proposal from General Junot, but turned it down because it was given through Marmont. Clary eventually met her future spouse, Jean Baptiste Jules Bernadotte, another French general and politician. They were married in a secular ceremony at Sceaux on 17 August 1798. In the marriage contract, Clary was given economic independence. On 4 July 1799, she gave birth to their only child, a son, Oscar. 

During the coup of 1799, when Napoleon took power, she was exposed to manipulation from both the Bonaparte family, who wanted Bernadotte to support Napoleon, and the Bernadotte faction, who wanted him to take action for himself. Both sides tried to use her to influence Bernadotte and extract information from him about his attitudes. Aware of this, he did not tell her of his plans, but he was later to say that it was because of family influence that he had been passive during the coup. During the coup, the couple were forced to take refuge in the country villa of General Sarrazin at Villeneuve St. Georges: she apparently dressed as a man during the escape. She kept in contact with Julie all the time, and Napoleon accepted Bernadotte apparently because of her.

In 1800, Désirée Bernadotte was present at a failed assassination attempt on Napoleon, when a bomb exploded between the carriage of Napoleon and the carriage where she and Caroline Bonaparte were sitting. She was not interested in politics, but her good connections made her a puppet in the hands of her husband and Napoleon, who both used her to influence each other and to pass messages. In 1801, her husband had her interfere in favor of General Ernouf through Joseph. In 1802, a conspiracy against Napoleon was discovered. Napoleon suspected Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, and interrogated his wife, who naively told him that her spouse had not been involved, though he had met Moreau in their home and mumbled his name as well as the word conspiracy in his sleep. After this, Napoleon appointed her husband governor of Louisiana. The couple was ready to sail, when the appointment was retracted.

On 19 May 1804, her spouse was made Marshal of France, which gave her the equivalent position. However, she was described as indifferent to social position, like her sister Julie. Napoleon gave her an allowance, and a house in Rue d&#x27;Anjou Saint-Honoré, where she resided for the rest of her life when in Paris. At the Coronation of Napoleon on 2 December 1804, she followed Josephine, whose train was carried by her sisters-in-law, carrying the handkerchief and veil of Josephine on a pillow.

Her spouse was a leading general in the French army under Napoleon, and normally absent from Paris. He liked her to be a member of high society, and had her take lessons in dance and etiquette from an instructor Montel. Bernadotte had a good relationship with the Bonaparte Imperial family. Upon the request of her spouse, she did not have to be a lady-in-waiting, and did not participate in court life. She lived in the circle of the Bonaparte and Clary family and also participated in high society, where she enjoyed music, theater and dance, while she spent her summers at spas or her country villas at La Grange and Auteuil. It is believed that she may have had a romantic relationship with the Corsican Ange Chiappe, who often acted as her escort. She is described as pretty and pleasing and a skillful dancer, but fairly anonymous. She lived mostly separated from her spouse in Paris during his absence. She informed him about political events in Paris by correspondence.

During her husband&#x27;s time as governor of the Hanseatic cities and governor of Hanover, Désirée visited him in Hamburg with her son a couple of times but she never stayed long; each time she soon returned to Paris. She was not happy living anywhere but Paris. In 1806, she was forced to accompany Empress Josephine to Mainz. When her spouse was made Prince of Pontecorvo in 1806, she worriedly asked if she would be forced to leave Paris, but was happy when she was assured that she would not. In 1807, she visited him in Spandau and in Marienburg in East Prussia, where she nursed him during his illness.

In August 1810, Bernadotte was elected heir to the throne of Sweden and she heiress, now in that position being given the official name of &quot;Desideria&quot;. She initially thought this was to be similar to the position of Prince of Pontecorvo, and did not expect to have to visit Sweden more than she had been forced to visit Pontecorvo: &quot;I thought, that it was as it had been with Ponte Corvo, a place from where we would have a title.&quot; She was later to admit, that she had never cared about any other country than France and knew nothing of foreign countries nor did she care about them, and that she was in despair when she was told that this time, she would be expected to leave Paris. Desideria delayed her departure and did not leave with her spouse. She was delighted with the position she had received at the French court after her elevation to crown princess (she had been invited to court events every week), and she was frightened by the stories of her reluctant French servants, who tried to discourage her from leaving by saying that Sweden was a country close to the North Pole filled with Polar bears. Finally, she left Paris and traveled by Hamburg and Kronborg in Denmark over the Öresund to Helsingborg in Sweden.

==Crown Princess==

On 22 December 1810, Desideria arrived with her son Oscar in Helsingborg in Sweden, and the 6 January 1811, she was introduced to the Swedish royal court at the Royal Palace in Stockholm. She had been met in Helsingborg by her appointed Mistress of the Robes Countess Caroline Lewenhaupt and the maid of honor Mariana Koskull. The Swedish climate was reportedly a shock for her: she arrived during the winter, and she hated the snow so much that she cried. Her spouse had converted upon his election as heir to the Swedish throne, and upon their arrival, her son was also to do so, as was required, and was taken from her to be brought up a Lutheran. There was, in accordance with the &quot;Tolerance Act&quot;, no demand that she should convert, and a Catholic chapel was arranged for her use. Desideria was not religious, but the Catholic masses served to remind her of France, and she celebrated the birth of Napoleon II by a Te Deum in her chapel.

Desideria was unable to adapt to the demands of formal court etiquette or participate in the representational duties which were required of her in her position of Crown Princess. Her French entourage, especially Elise la Flotte, made her unpopular during her stay in Sweden by encouraging her to complain about everything. She did not have a good relationship with Queen Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte, though the Dowager Queen Sophia Magdalena was reportedly kind to her. In her famous diaries, Queen Charlotte described her as good hearted, generous and pleasant when she chose to be and not one to plot, but also an immature &quot;spoiled child&quot;, who hated all demands and was unable to handle any form of representation, and as &quot;a French woman in every inch&quot; who disliked and complained about everything which was not French, and &quot;consequently, she is not liked.&quot;
Queen Charlotte, who wanted to remain the center of attention at her own court, was not pleased with Desideria and also influenced King Charles against her.

Desideria left Sweden in the summer of 1811 under the name of &quot;Countess of Gotland&quot;, officially because of her health, and returned to Paris, leaving her husband and her son behind. She herself said that the Swedish nobility had treated her as if they were made of ice: &quot;Do not talk with me of Stockholm, I get a cold as soon as I hear the word.&quot; In Sweden, her husband took a mistress, the noblewoman Mariana Koskull.

Under the same alias, Desideria officially resided incognito in Paris, thereby avoiding politics. However, her house at rue d&#x27;Anjou was watched by the secret police, and her letters were read by them. She had no court, just her lady&#x27;s companion Elise la Flotte to assist her as hostess at her receptions, and she mostly associated with a circle of close friends and family. Her receptions were frequented by Talleyrand and Fouché, who upon the mission of Napoleon tried to influence her consort through her. In 1812, she acted as mediator when Napoleon negotiated with her consort through the Duke de Bassano. Her consort liked her to be placed in Paris, where she could calm Napoleon&#x27;s rage over the politics of Sweden and keep him informed about the events in the center of European politics, but as their correspondence has been lost, it is not known how political it was. During the meeting between her husband and Tsar Alexander I of Russia in Åbo in 1812, the Tsar suggested that Charles John divorce her and marry one of his sisters, but the King turned down the proposal.

Before his attack on Russia, Napoleon asked Desideria to leave France. She made herself ready to leave, but managed to avoid it. As she officially lived incognito, she could avoid politics when Sweden and France declared war in 1813. During the summer of 1813, she retired to the country estate of Julie, Mortefontaine, with Catharina of Württemberg to avoid attention before she returned to Paris New Year&#x27;s Eve of 1814. The 31 March 1814, upon the arrival of the allied armies in Paris after the defeat of Napoleon, her house was a refuge for her sister Julie. She met up with her spouse, who was among the allied generals to arrive in Paris. She did not return with him to Sweden when he left, however, which attracted attention. When asked why by the Swedish Count Jacob De la Gardie at Mortefontaine, she answered that she was afraid that she would be divorced if she did.

On 14 May 1814, she was introduced to Louis XVIII of France, whose court she often visited the following years and whom she is said to have liked quite well. After the Hundred Days in 1815, the members of the Bonaparte family were exiled from France. This included her sister Julie, and when Louis XVIII expressed a wish to do her a favor, she regularly asked him to make an exception for Julie and allow her to live in Paris. In 1816, she made plans to return to Sweden, but she wished to bring her sister, Julie, along with her. Her husband thought this unwise. Julie was the wife of a Bonaparte and her presence might be taken as a sign that he sided with the deposed Napoleon. In the end, this came to nothing. At this point, she often spent time with Germaine de Staël and Juliette Récamier. In 1817, Desideria&#x27;s husband placed a Count de Montrichard in her household as his spy to report if she did anything which could affect him.

==Queen consort==

In 1818, her husband became King of Sweden, which made Desideria queen. However, she remained in France, officially for health reasons, which caused speculations in the press in Paris and by her visitors. After she became queen, the queen dowager wrote to her and suggested that she should have Swedish ladies-in-waiting, but she replied that it was unnecessary for her to have a court since she still resided incognito. She officially kept herself incognito and did not host any court, but she kept in contact with the Swedish embassy, regularly visited the court of Louis XVIII, and often saw Swedes at her receptions, which she hosted on Thursdays and Sundays, unofficially in her role as queen, though she still used the title of countess.

During this period, she fell in love with the French prime minister, the Duc de Richelieu, which attracted attention. According to one version, she fell in love with him after Louis XVIII had assigned him to deny her regular appeal for her sister Julie in the most charming way possible. True or not, she did fall in love with him, but the affection was not returned by Richelieu, who referred to her as his &quot;crazy Queen&quot;. According to Laure Junot, she did not dare to speak to him or approach him, but she followed him wherever he went, tried to make contact with him, followed him on his trip to Spa, and had flowers placed in his room. She followed him around until his death in 1822. Another version of her behavior toward him was, that her consort had given her the task to make contact with Richelieu for political reasons, but that his attitude had made her too embarrassed to do so.

During the summer of 1822, her son Oscar made a trip in Europe to inspect prospective brides, and it was decided they should meet. As France was deemed unsuitable, they met in Aachen and a second time in Switzerland. In 1823, Desideria returned to Sweden together with her son&#x27;s bride, Josephine of Leuchtenberg. It was intended to be a visit, but she was to remain in Sweden for the rest of her life. She and Josephine arrived in Stockholm 13 June 1823. Three days later, the royal court and the government were presented to her, and on 19 June, she participated in the official welcoming of Josephine and witnessed the wedding. A well-known story is that after her return to Sweden there was a warm and dry period, so the peasants turning up to see her were coaxed into greeting her with &quot;Vi vill ha regn!&quot; (&quot;We want rain!&quot;), which in the Scanian dialect sounds very similar to the French &quot;Vive la Reine!&quot; (&quot;Long live the Queen!&quot;).

On 21 August 1829, she was crowned Queen of Sweden in Storkyrkan in Stockholm. Her coronation had been suggested upon her return, but her husband had postponed it because he feared there could be religious difficulties. There was actually a suggestion that she should convert to the Lutheran faith before her coronation, but in the end, the question was not considered important enough to press, and she was crowned all the same. She was crowned at her own request after having pressed Charles John with a wish that she should be crowned as &quot;otherwise she would be no proper Queen&quot;. A reason for her insistence is believed to have been that she regarded it as protection against divorce. She was, however, never crowned in Norway because of her status as a Catholic, despite requesting to be crowned there as well. She was the first commoner to become a queen of Sweden since Karin Månsdotter in 1568.

The relationship between her and her husband King Charles XIV John was somewhat distant, but friendly. Charles John treated her with some irritability, while she behaved very freely and informally toward him. The court was astonished by her informal behavior. She could enter his bedroom and stay there until late at night even though he hinted to her that he wished to be alone with his favorite Count Magnus Brahe. Every morning, she visited her husband in her nightgown, which was seen as shocking, because her husband usually conferred with members of the council of state in his bedchamber at that time. Because of their difference in habits, they seldom saw each other even though they lived together. Because she was always late at dinner, for example, he stopped having his meals with her, and as he also preferred to have his meals alone, it was not uncommon for the nobles of the court to sit alone at the dinner table, without the royal couple present.

There is nothing to indicate that Queen Desideria ever had any political influence, and she was praised for her lack of interference in politics. Whenever Charles John became agitated, she was known to be able to calm him with the one firm word &quot;Bernadotte!&quot; One such anecdote was when Charles John, known for his hot temperament, raged about how he would punish some political advisories in various ways. For every punishment he stated, she is said to have struck her fan in the table and said to the surrounding courtiers &quot;He could not hurt a cat!&quot;, upon which the court started to laugh. She was also to have said &quot;Oh, I like to hear you say that, you who do not even have the heart to wring the neck of a cat!&quot;
Queen Desideria enjoyed social life, but only if it was informal, and her strong dislike of court etiquette, and refusal to submit to it, made it hard for her to accustom to her position as queen and make herself respected by the nobility, who privately ridiculed her difficulty to adjust to etiquette, and she was also regarded with some snobbery because of her past as a merchant&#x27;s daughter and a republican.

Consequently, it was difficult for her to discipline her aristocratic ladies-in-waiting, whom Charles John appointed without consulting her, and who preferred to sort out conflicts regarding etiquette among themselves instead of asking her to mediate, which on at least one occasion led to a scene which caused Charles John to reprimand her: &quot;Try to make your ladies not to announce their actions and conflicts to the public as it happened the day you departed from Stockholm&quot;, after an incident when two ladies-in-waiting had &quot;screamed like rower madams&quot; about precedence in the seats of the queen&#x27;s carriage during a journey. 
These difficulties were somewhat subdued during the tenure of her niece Marcelle Tascher de la Pagerie, who made a social success, and her first years as queen are described as a time of balls and parties, more than had been seen at the Swedish court since the days of King Gustav III. After the departure of Tascher to France, however, Désirée&#x27;s difficulties with court life became more marked. She gradually reduced her participation in social life because she could find not pleasure in it when it must be conducted in accordance with etiquette. 
Her dislike of formal court etiquette remained her foremost complaint about her life in Sweden in her letters to her sister Julie: 
:&quot;How boring courts can be, when you are not born within them. [...] The ladies who attend me are not very funny and I am forced to restrict myself physically and morally [...] I can never adjust myself to the strict etiquette, which must always be observed at court [...] When you live surrounded by a court and are forced to express your feelings in the form of polite phrases, which are demanded at court, the difficulties are so great that you would rather not.&quot; 
Consequently, with time she participated less and less in court life, and it was said that she &quot;spent her most time in her own apartment, where her thoughts with regret trailed back to the time when she, surrounded by affectionate friends, lived in France free from the prison of etiquette.&quot; By the early 1830s, she had grown tired of her royal status and wished to return to Paris, but her husband refused to allow it. 
This is not to say that Désirée did not befriend some of her courtiers, particularly Countess Clara Bonde, who was her favorite from her arrival in 1823 to her death. After the departure of her niece to France, she often socialized with the rich merchant Carl Abraham Arfwedson, who had once been a guest in her childhood home. Among her other more known ladies-in-waiting were the Norwegians Kathinka Falbe and Jana Falbe. Because of Desideria&#x27;s eccentric habits, they were known as &quot;Strapatsfröknarna&quot; (approximately &quot;Mesdemoiselles Calamity&quot;). During her stays at Rosersberg Palace and in spite of her fear of the dark, she took walks in the park at night, and instructed one lady-in-waiting to walk in front of her dressed in white to keep bats away from her. 

Desideria was interested in fashion, devoted a lot of interest and pride in her hair and wore low cut dresses until an advanced age. She enjoyed dancing: her standard question at court presentations was if the debutantes liked to dance, and she herself danced well also during her old age. Her conversations were mainly about her old life in France. She never learned to speak the Swedish language, and there are many anecdotes of her attempts to speak the language. Her lack of etiquette became more accepted over the years, as she became known as an eccentric in other aspects.

Like her daughter-in-law, Desideria was a Catholic, but in contrast to Josephine, who was a devout and practicing Catholic, she never was. Her devout Catholic daughter-in-law insisted that she attend mass and confession. She did attend masses to please Josephine, but stated that she had no sins to confess. When the priest started to preach and reprimand her, she silenced him and stated that such talk irritated her nerves.

Her favorite summer residence was Rosersberg Palace, where she kept chickens for pets, but as Rosersberg was remote, she more commonly stayed at Haga Palace. She also often visited Swedish spas, such as Ramlösa. 

Desideria visited Norway for the first time in 1825. In Norway, she is mostly known as the patroness of Maria Schandorff&#x27;s &quot;Eugenia stiftelse&quot; (Eugenia Foundation) for poor girls in Oslo, named for the queen, which she often visited from 1828 until 1847.

==Queen Mother==

In 1844, Charles XIV John died and Desideria became the queen mother. Her son, the new King Oscar I, allowed her to keep living in the queen&#x27;s quarters in the Royal Palace as well as her entire court staff out of consideration, so that she would not have to change her habits. When her daughter-in-law Queen Josephine tried to convince her to reduce her court of her own free will, saying that she no longer needed such a big court as a queen mother, she answered &quot;It is true that I no longer need them all, but all of them still need me.&quot; She was a considerate and well-liked employer among her staff. 

Desideria did engage in charity but it was discreet, and it has been said: &quot;Her charity was considerable but took place in silence&quot;. One example was that she supported poor upper-class women by giving them sewing work. She also acted as official protector of charitable institutions, such as the Women&#x27;s Society Girl School. The same year she became a widow, she was described by the French diplomat Bacourt: &quot;Royalty has not altered her — unfortunately, for the reputation of the Crown. She has always been and will always remain an ordinary merchant woman, surprised over her position, and surprising to find upon a throne.&quot; He also added that she was a goodhearted woman.

After her return to Sweden in 1823, Desideria had kept her house at Rue d&#x27;Anjou in Paris awaiting her return. It was managed by her sister Catherine Honorine Villeneuve and her old French staff, while her business in France was managed by her nephew, Imperial Count Clary. In May 1853, after Napoleon III had made himself French emperor, she made preparations to return to Paris. Everything was ready, and she was escorted to her ship in Karlskrona by her grandson Prince Oscar, Duke of Östergötland. Her fear of sea travels, however, made it impossible for her to leave.

During her last years, she was worried about her house in Paris because of the plans of the city architect Haussmann, but Napoleon III made an exception for her and allowed for her house to stand, which it did until one year after her death. Desideria had a fairly harmonious relationship with her daughter-in-law, and felt sympathy for her grandson&#x27;s bride, Princess Louise of the Netherlands.

During her later years as queen, and particularly as a queen mother, she became known for her eccentricity. She is known to have kept reversed hours and, consequently, for often being late and keeping guests waiting, something which agitated her spouse. Normally, she retired at four in the morning, and awoke at two o&#x27;clock in the afternoon. Before she went to bed, she took a &quot;walk by carriage&quot;. During these trips, she often paid unannounced visits, which were normally inconvenient because of the time. When the weather was bad, her carriage drove round the courtyard of the royal palace instead. It was normal for her to arrive for a visit to an opera when the show had ended. She went to bed in the morning, got up in the evening, ate breakfast at night and wandered around the corridors of the sleeping palace with a light. An anecdote illustrates this: in 1843, a palace guard saw the Queen fully dressed on a palace balcony in the middle of the night. When he came home to his wife, he told her that she was lazy in comparison to the Queen, who had gotten up hours before sunrise. He thought the Queen Mother was up earlier than anyone else in town, but in fact, she had not yet gone to bed.

Desideria sometimes would take in children from the streets to the palace and give them sweets; she was not able to engage in any real conversation, but she would say &quot;Kom, kom!&quot; (Swedish for &quot;Come come!&quot;)

There are stories about people having been awakened by her carriage when she drove through the streets at night. The carriage sometimes stopped; she would sleep for a while, and then she would wake and the carriage would continue on its way. Her habit of circling the courtyard in her coach she called &quot;Kring kring&quot; (Swedish for &quot;around and around&quot;), one of the few Swedish words she learned.

On 17 December 1860, Queen Desideria entered her box at the Royal Swedish Opera just &quot;after&quot; the performance had ended and upon returning to Stockholm Palace, she collapsed before reaching her apartment, dying at 83 years of age in the reign of her grandson King Charles XV (her son King Oscar I having predeceased her). Following a Catholic ceremony on 10 January 1861, Queen Desideria was interred the next day alongside her husband, in Riddarholmen Church.

<doc id="296000" wikidata="Q162252" url="?curid=296000" title="Without loss of generality">
<text>Without loss of generality (often abbreviated to WOLOG, WLOG or w.l.o.g.; less commonly stated as without any loss of generality or with no loss of generality) is a frequently used expression in mathematics. The term is used to indicate the assumption that what follows is chosen arbitrarily, narrowing the premise to a particular case, but does not affect the validity of the proof in general. The other cases are sufficiently similar to the one presented that proving them follows by essentially the same logic. As a result, once a proof is given for the particular case, it is trivial to adapt it to prove the conclusion in all other cases.

In many scenarios, the use of &quot;without loss of generality&quot; is made possible by the presence of symmetry. For example, if some property &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) of real numbers is known to be symmetric in &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, namely that &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) is equivalent to &quot;P&quot;(&quot;y&quot;,&quot;x&quot;), then in proving that &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) holds for every &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, one may assume &quot;without loss of generality&quot; that &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot;. There is no loss of generality in this assumption, since once the case &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; ⇒ &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) has been proved, the other case follows by interchanging &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;&amp;hairsp;: &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; ⇒ &quot;P&quot;(&quot;y&quot;,&quot;x&quot;), and by symmetry of &quot;P&quot;, this implies &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;), thereby showing that &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) holds for all cases.

On the other hand, if neither such a symmetry nor another form of equivalence can be established, then the use of &quot;without loss of generality&quot; is incorrect and can amount to an instance of proof by example – a logical fallacy of proving a claim by proving a non-representative example.

== Example ==

Consider the following theorem (which is a case of the pigeonhole principle):

A proof: 
The above argument works because the exact same reasoning could be applied if the alternative assumption, namely, that the first object is blue, were made, or, similarly, that the words &#x27;red&#x27; and &#x27;blue&#x27; can be freely exchanged in the wording of the proof. As a result, the use of &quot;without loss of generality&quot; is valid in this case.

<doc id="296001" wikidata="Q1077476" url="?curid=296001" title="Justice as Fairness">
<text>&quot;Justice as Fairness: Political not Metaphysical&quot; is an essay by John Rawls, published in 1985. In it he describes his conception of justice. It comprises two main principles of liberty and equality; the second is subdivided into &quot;fair equality of opportunity&quot; and the &quot;difference principle&quot;.

Rawls arranges the principles in &quot;lexical priority,&quot; prioritizing in the order of the &quot;liberty principle&quot;, &quot;fair equality of opportunity&quot; and the &quot;difference principle&quot;. This order determines the priorities of the principles if they conflict in practice. The principles are, however, intended as a single, comprehensive conception of justice—&quot;Justice as Fairness&quot;—and not to function individually. These principles are always applied so as to ensure that the &quot;least advantaged&quot; are benefitted and not hurt or forgotten.

Rawls originally presented the theory in his 1971 book &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;, subsequently expanding upon several of its themes in his later book titled &quot;Political Liberalism&quot;.

==First principle: the liberty principle==
The first and most important principle is that everyone has the same rights and fundamental freedoms. Rawls argued that &quot;certain rights and freedoms are more important or fundamental &quot;than others.&quot; For example, Samuel Freeman argues, Rawls believes that &quot;personal property&quot;—personal belongings, a home—constitutes a basic liberty, but an absolute right to unlimited private property does not. As a fundamental freedom, these rights are inviolable. The government must not alter, violate or remove such rights from individuals. Thomas Mertens says Rawls believes that the principles of society are chosen by representative citizens on &quot;fair&quot; terms.

Rawls articulates the liberty principle as the most extensive basic liberty compatible with similar liberty for others in &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;; he later amended this in &quot;Political Liberalism&quot;, stating instead that &quot;each person has an equal claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic rights and liberties&quot;.

==Second principle: the equality principle==
The principle is part of justice that established distributive justice. Rawls awards the fair equality of opportunity principle lexical priority over the difference principle: Society cannot adjust inequality to maximize the proportion of those who are most vulnerable without providing positions and the opportunities that are necessary for the worse-off to achieve them.

===Fair equality of opportunity===
This principle maintains that &quot;offices and positions&quot; have to be open to all, regardless of their social background, caste or gender. This principle is stronger than &quot;formal equality of opportunity.&quot; Rawls argues that human potential should not only be a &quot;right,&quot; but also an &quot;effective&quot; equal opportunity.

===Difference principle===
The difference principle regulates inequalities: it permits only inequalities that work to the advantage of the worst-off. This is often misinterpreted as trickle-down economics; Rawls&#x27; argument is more accurately expressed as a system where wealth &quot;diffuses up&quot;. By guaranteeing the worst-off in society a fair deal, Rawls compensates for naturally occurring inequalities (talents that one is born with, such as a capacity for sport).

Rawls justifies the difference principle on the basis that, since fair equality of opportunity has lexical priority, the just choice from Pareto optimal scenarios which could occur would be that benefiting the worst-off rather than the best-off.

==Original position==

A key component of Rawls&#x27; argument is his claim that his principles of justice would be chosen by parties in the original position. This is a thought experiment in which the parties select principles that will determine the basic structure of the society they will live in. This choice is made from behind a veil of ignorance, which would deprive participants of information about their particular characteristics: his or her ethnicity, social status, gender and, crucially, their conception of the good. This forces participants to select principles impartially and rationally.

<text>Darrell Edward Issa ( ; born November 1, 1953) is an American businessman and politician serving as the U.S. representative for California&#x27;s 48th congressional district. He represented the 50th congressional district from 2021 to 2023. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served in the United States House of Representatives from 2001 to 2019, representing two districts primarily covering North County in the San Diego area, first the 48th district for one term and then the 49th district for eight terms. From January 2011 to January 2015, he chaired the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

Issa was CEO of Directed Electronics, which he co-founded in 1982. It is one of the largest makers of automobile aftermarket security and convenience products in the United States. With a net worth of approximately $460 million, Issa is the wealthiest serving member of Congress as of 2023.

On January 10, 2018, Issa announced that he would not seek reelection to the House. Democrat Mike Levin was elected on November 6, 2018, to become the district&#x27;s next representative. On September 19, 2018, President Donald Trump nominated Issa to be director of the United States Trade and Development Agency.

On September 26, 2019, Issa announced that he was running for California&#x27;s 50th congressional district in the 2020 election. He placed second in the March top-two primary, advancing to face Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar in the November general election. Issa defeated Campa-Najjar.

==Early life, education, and military service==
The second of six children, Issa was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Martha (née Bielfelt) and William Issa, who sold trucks and ground valves. His father was the son of Lebanese Christian immigrants, and a member of the Maronite Catholic faith. His mother is of German and Bohemian (Czech) descent and a Latter-day Saint.

During his childhood, the large family moved to a three-bedroom house in the predominantly Jewish suburb of Cleveland Heights. Many of Issa&#x27;s friends were Jewish, and he reportedly worked for a rabbi at one point. He became very familiar with Jewish culture.

In 1970, on his 17th birthday, Issa dropped out of high school and enlisted in the Army. He became an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) technician assigned to the 145th Ordnance Detachment. Trained to defuse bombs, Issa has said that his unit provided security for President Richard Nixon, sweeping stadiums for bombs before games in the 1971 World Series. A May 1998 investigation by Lance Williams of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; found that Nixon had not attended any 1971 World Series games, but that Issa&#x27;s unit did perform security sweeps during the series. First Lady Pat Nixon was present at Game 2 of the series, where she threw the first pitch. After the series, Issa was transferred to a supply depot, a result of receiving poor ratings.

Issa received a hardship discharge from the Army in 1972 after his father suffered a heart attack. After that, he earned a General Educational Development (GED) certificate.

Twice that year, Issa was arrested. In the first incident, a grand jury indicted him for theft of a Maserati, in a complicated scheme with his brother William, but prosecutors dropped the charge. In the second incident, he was stopped for driving the wrong way on a one-way street, and a police officer noticed a firearm in his car&#x27;s glove compartment; Issa was charged with carrying a concealed weapon. He pleaded guilty to possession of an unregistered firearm and was sentenced to six months&#x27; probation and a small fine. Issa has said he believes the record has since been expunged.

Issa majored in business administration at Siena Heights University, a small Roman Catholic college in Adrian, Michigan, completing his degree at the Stark campus of Kent State University. While at Kent State, he enrolled in the Reserve Officer Training Corps; at graduation he was commissioned as a second lieutenant.

Issa served in the Army Reserve from 1976 to 1980, and was promoted to captain. From September 9 to 26, 1980, Issa served on active duty while training with the 1/77th Armor Battalion as an Assistant S-1. His evaluation report, by then-Lt. Col. Wesley Clark, read, &quot;This officer&#x27;s performance far exceeded that of any other reserve officer who has worked in the battalion&quot; and &quot;Promote ahead of contemporaries. Unlimited potential.&quot;

Shortly before his discharge from the Army in 1980, Issa was again indicted for grand theft auto. The prosecution dropped the case in August 1980. In 1981, Issa was in a car crash. The other motorist sued him for $20,000; they eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.

==Business career==
===Quantum/Steal Stopper===
After leaving the military, Issa and his second wife, Kathy Stanton, returned to the Cleveland area. According to Issa, he and his wife pooled their savings, sold their cars (a 1976 Mercedes and a 1967 VW Beetle) and a BMW motorcycle, and borrowed $50,000 from family members to invest in Quantum Enterprises, an electronics manufacturer run by a friend from Cleveland Heights. It assembled bug zappers, CB radio parts, and other consumer products for other companies. One of those clients, car alarm manufacturer Steal Stopper, became the path to Issa&#x27;s fortune. It was struggling badly, and he took control of it by foreclosing a $60,000 loan he had made to it when its founder, Joey Adkins, missed a payment. Adkins remained as an employee.

Issa soon turned Steal Stopper around, to the point that it was supplying Ford with thousands of car alarms and negotiating a similar deal with Toyota. Early in the morning of September 7, 1982, Quantum and Steal Stopper&#x27;s offices and factory in the Cleveland suburb of Maple Heights caught fire. The fire took three hours to put out. The buildings and almost all the inventory within were destroyed. An investigation of the fire noted &quot;suspicious burn patterns&quot; with fires starting in two places aided by an accelerant such as gasoline.

Adkins said Issa had appeared to prepare for a fire by increasing the fire insurance policy by 462% three weeks earlier, and by removing computer equipment containing accounting and customer information. St. Paul Insurance, suspicious of arson and insurance fraud, initially paid only $25,000, according to Issa.

===Directed Electronics===

Steal Stopper soon returned a profit again. As car theft rose in the U.S. during the 1980s, so did the demand for security devices. Rolls-Royce, BMW, and General Motors joined Ford and Toyota as customers of Steal Stopper. In 1985, Issa sold the company to a California-based maker of home alarms, and moved to the San Diego suburb of Vista, to work for the company.

Shortly afterward, Issa left to start Directed Electronics, Inc. (DEI). He has continued to live in Vista. Issa used his knowledge of the weaknesses in automotive security to develop effective theft deterrents. Using sensors that, when armed, would detect motion and pressure on the car&#x27;s body, his device made loud noise to draw attention to a would-be car thief, such as the car&#x27;s horn honking or a speaker playing a recording with Issa&#x27;s voice saying: &quot;Protected by Viper. Stand back&quot; and &quot;Please step away from the car&quot;, warnings for DEI&#x27;s signature product, the Viper car alarm. Sales grew from $1 million in the company&#x27;s first year to $14 million by 1989.

===Greene Properties===

Issa is partner in 17 limited partnerships and limited liability companies (LLCs) that own commercial properties across North San Diego County. He is CEO of Greene Properties, Inc., a privately held real estate investment company with commercial real estate holdings in San Diego North County. Headquartered in Vista, it manages three commercial office buildings in Carlsbad with a total of 26,354 square feet. Employees include his wife and son William &quot;Will&quot; Issa as assistant property manager. The office is in the same building as Issa&#x27;s former congressional office, near their house of the last 20 years.

==Early political career==

===Activism===
Active in consumer-electronics trade organizations, Issa became more directly involved in politics. He went to Washington, D.C., to lobby Congress and later became one of California&#x27;s biggest individual campaign contributors to Republican candidates. In 1996, he chaired the successful campaign to pass California Proposition 209, a ballot initiative that prohibited Californian public institutions from considering race, sex, or ethnicity in public employment, public contracting, or public education. He was instrumental in persuading the national Republican Party to hold its 1996 convention in San Diego.

===1998 U.S. Senate election===

Issa&#x27;s first campaign for elected office was in 1998, when he sought the Republican nomination for United States Senate to face incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer. He spent $10 million of his own money in the primary, running against California State Treasurer Matt Fong, Congressman Frank Riggs, and three others. Fong&#x27;s campaign raised $3 million from contributions and complained that Issa&#x27;s wealth made for an uneven playing field (Issa received only $400,000 in contributions from others). An Issa spokesman countered that the money was needed to compensate for Fong&#x27;s statewide name recognition. Issa lost to Fong, 45% to 40%; Riggs got 10% of the vote. A San Francisco exit poll suggested large numbers of Asian Americans, who typically vote in the Democratic primary, had crossed party lines to strategically vote for Fong.

===Elections===
====2000====

Nine-term incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Ron Packard decided not to run for reelection in 2000, in California&#x27;s 48th congressional district. Issa ran for the seat, capitalizing on his name recognition from the 1998 Senate race. The district was primarily based in northern San Diego County, but had small portions in Riverside and Orange counties. Issa finished first in the all-party primary with 35% of the vote, winning a plurality in all three counties; Republican state senator Bill Morrow was second, with 24% of the votes. Issa won the November general election, defeating Democratic nominee Peter Kouvelis 61%–28%.

====2002====

After redistricting, Issa&#x27;s district was renumbered the 49th and lost its share of Orange County. Like its predecessor, the district was still overwhelmingly Republican; it had a Cook Partisan Voting Index (PVI) of R+10. No Democrat filed against Issa that year. He was reelected, defeating Libertarian nominee Karl Dietrich, 77%–22%.

====2004====

A write-in candidate from the 2002 election, Mike Byron, became the Democratic challenger in 2004. Issa was reelected to a third term, defeating Byron 63%–35%.

====2006====

Issa was reelected to a fourth term, defeating Democratic nominee Jeeni Criscenzo, 63%–33%. He was one of four Middle Eastern American members in that Congress. He has said that he identified primarily as Lebanese, not as pan-Arab.

====2008====

Issa was reelected to a fifth term, defeating Democratic nominee Robert Hamilton, 58%–37%. The 21-point margin of victory was the second smallest in Issa&#x27;s career. He carried San Diego with 60% of the vote and Riverside with 57% of the vote.

====2010====

Issa was reelected to a sixth term, defeating Democratic nominee Howard Katz, 63%–31%.

====2012====

After the 2010 census, Issa&#x27;s district was renumbered the 49th and made significantly more compact. It lost its share of Riverside County, along with most of its share of San Diego County. It gained a small portion of southern Orange County, including San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano, Dana Point, and part of Laguna Niguel. The district was more competitive on paper than its predecessor. The old 49th had a PVI of R+10, while the new 49th has a PVI of R+4.

Issa was reelected to a seventh term, defeating Democratic nominee Jerry Tetalman, 58%–42%. The 16-point margin of victory was the smallest in Issa&#x27;s political career. Issa carried the San Diego portion of his district with 55% of the vote and the Orange County part with 66%.

====2014====

The June open primary was contested by Issa and two Democrats: Dave Peiser and Noboru Isaga. The top two vote-getters, Issa (62%) and Peiser (28%), advanced to the general election. Issa was elected to an eighth term, 60% to 40%.

====2016====

In the June open primary, Issa received 51% of the vote to 46% for Democrat Doug Applegate, a retired Marine colonel. Issa and Applegate advanced to the general election in November. In October, Applegate and Issa were ranked by the Cook Political Report as equally likely to win.

Issa sent out a campaign mailer that featured a photograph of President Barack Obama signing a law. The mailer said that Issa was &quot;very pleased&quot; that Obama signed the Sexual Assault Survivors&#x27; Rights Act, which Issa had co-sponsored.

Unusually, President Obama responded to this late campaign mailer by saying that Issa&#x27;s &quot;primary contribution to the U.S. Congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumped up investigations that have led nowhere.&quot; Obama said that, because of fading support for Donald Trump, Issa was promoting his cooperation with the president although he had previously accused Obama of corruption.

Issa said, &quot;I&#x27;ve worked with the administration on good legislation where it was possible, called out wrongdoing wherever I saw it and will continue to do so.&quot;

On November 23, 2016, Issa held a 3,234-vote lead with approximately 6,000 ballots still uncounted. He declared victory, but Applegate had not conceded. The Associated Press finally declared Issa the winner on November 28, citing a small but convincing lead with only a few votes left to count.

====2018====

Multiple Democrats, including Applegate and environmental attorney Mike Levin, launched campaigns for California&#x27;s 49th district seat. Given the close margin in 2016, the election was expected to be highly competitive. For months, Issa&#x27;s Vista office was the site of weekly protests. Hundreds of people gathered to protest against Trump and his agenda and actions. At a May rally, 800 people showed up to protest the House vote to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). On January 10, 2018, Issa announced that he would not run for reelection. Democrat Mike Levin won the seat.

====2020====

On September 26, 2019, Issa announced that he was running for California&#x27;s 50th congressional district in the 2020 election. The incumbent at that time was fellow Republican Duncan D. Hunter, who was then under indictment. In December 2019, Hunter pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and resigned from Congress effective January 13, 2020, leaving the seat vacant.

In redistricting, the 50th district had absorbed much of Issa&#x27;s former base in the more Republican inland portion of San Diego County. Issa placed second in the March 3, 2020, blanket primary and beat Democratic challenger Ammar Campa-Najjar by nearly 30,000 votes in the general election. Issa said he could switch districts because he owns his mother&#x27;s home in Bonsall. He has long lived in Vista, where he has raised his family.

===Tenure===
====Oversight committee====
After the 2010 elections, Issa became chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. He was a vocal advocate for investigations into the Obama administration, including the Troubled Assets Relief Program, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, corruption in Afghanistan, WikiLeaks, and the Food and Drug Administration, among other topics. In 2010 he told the press that he wanted the committee to hold investigative hearings &quot;seven hearings a week, times 40 weeks.&quot;

In February 2011, the Watchdog Institute, a nonprofit investigative reporting center based at San Diego State University, published an investigation alleging that as leader of the committee, Issa built a team that included staff members with close connections to industries that could benefit from his investigations.

On February 16, 2012, the committee held a hearing on the Department of Health and Human Services&#x27;s regulation requiring insurance plans to cover birth control, which Issa believed to be a violation of the religious freedom of people who oppose the use of birth control. Democratic members submitted attorney and activist Sandra Fluke as a witness for promoting women&#x27;s health, but Issa did not permit her to testify, saying her name was submitted too late, a claim Democrats challenged.

====Legislation====
In 2013 Issa introduced the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2013 (H.R. 2061; 113th Congress). H.R. 2061 aimed to make information on federal expenditures more easily available, accessible, and transparent. President Obama signed the bill into law on May 9, 2014.

Issa introduced the FOIA Oversight and Implementation Act of 2014 (H.R. 1211; 113th Congress) on March 15, 2013, a bill to amend the Freedom of Information Act in order to make it easier and faster to request and receive information. The bill would have required the Office of Management and Budget to create a single FOIA website for people to use to make FOIA requests and check on the status of their request. It would also have created a Chief FOIA Officers Council charged with reviewing compliance and recommending improvements, and required the federal agency to release the information it disclosed to the person who requested it publicly afterward.

Issa argued in favor of the bill because it &quot;shifts the burden of proof from the public requestor seeking information about a government agency...to the government being open and transparent unless it has a good reason to withhold.&quot; The bill passed the House unanimously on February 25, 2014, but a nearly identical Senate bill failed when it was tabled by House Speaker John Boehner.

Issa introduced the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (H.R. 1232; 113th Congress) on March 18, 2013, to make changes and reforms to the framework that manages how the federal government buys new technology. One of the requirements would be that the government develop a streamlined plan for its acquisitions. The bill would increase the power of federal agencies&#x27; chief information officers (CIO) so that they could be more effective.

Each agency would also be reduced to having only one CIO, who would be responsible for the success and failure of the agency&#x27;s IT projects. The bill would also require the federal government to make use of private sector best practices. The bill was intended to reduce IT procurement-related waste. It passed the House in a voice vote on February 25, 2014. In December 2014 it passed as a section of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. Issa also introduced and co-sponsored The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (Pub.L. 113–283, S. 2521; commonly referred to as FISMA Reform), which Obama signed into law on December 18, 2014.

On May 7, 2014, Issa introduced a simple resolution in the House (which passed 231 - 187): Recommending that the House of Representatives find Lois G. Lerner, former Director, Exempt Organizations, Internal Revenue Service, in contempt of Congress for refusal to comply with a subpoena duly issued by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The resolution holds Lois Lerner, one of the central Internal Revenue Service officials involved in the 2013 IRS scandal, in contempt of Congress for her refusal to testify about the scandal before Issa&#x27;s committee in response to a subpoena.

In July 2017, Issa introduced the CLASSICS Act to Congress in a bipartisan effort to empower artists by collecting royalties for the preceding three-year period and also by ensuring their creative rights remain in force for pre-1972 recordings just as newer artists are guaranteed by current legislation. Issa has been a consistent cosponsor of the Fair Play Fair Pay Act as well; granting radio performance rights for musicians and record producers.

===Bombing plot===
In 2001, Issa&#x27;s San Clemente district office was targeted in an aborted bombing plot. Jewish Defense League leader Irving Rubin was arrested along with Earl Krugel in connection with the plot, which reportedly had focused on other targets before shifting to Issa&#x27;s office. Issa speculated that the cause of the incident may have been a column written by political commentator Debbie Schlussel in which she charged that Issa sympathized with Hezbollah despite its being listed by the U.S. government as a terrorist organization, charges he denied.

===Ethics complaints and 2010 award===
In September 2011, a liberal advocacy and lobbying group, American Family Voices, filed a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics against Issa, alleging he had repeatedly used his position of authority on the Oversight Committee to improperly intervene in dealings with Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and DEI Holdings, all of which Issa is associated with in some way. Issa&#x27;s office rejected the allegations.

The year before, the Project on Government Oversight, a government watchdog group, gave Issa its Good Government Award for his contributions to government oversight and transparency. These included publicizing documents produced by the New York Federal Reserve Bank in response to a congressional subpoena, publicly exposing the NYFR&#x27;s secret &quot;back-door bailout&quot; of AIG&#x27;s counterparties, and cofounding a Transparency Caucus dedicated to &quot;promoting a more open and accountable government through education, legislation, and oversight.&quot; In 2012 Issa featured in TechCrunch&#x27;s list of &quot;The 20 Most Innovative People in Democracy.&quot;

In late February 2021, Issa and a dozen other Republican House members skipped votes and enlisted others to vote for them, citing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, while actually attending the Conservative Political Action Conference, which was held at the same time as their slated absences. In response, the Campaign for Accountability, an ethics watchdog group, filed a complaint with the House Committee on Ethics and requested an investigation into Issa and the other lawmakers.

===Committee assignments===
For the 118th Congress:
* Committee on Foreign Affairs
** Subcommittee on Europe
** Subcommittee on Oversight and Accountability

==Political positions==
Issa voted with the majority of House Republicans 95% of the time during the 111th Congress.

===Abortion===

As of 2020, Issa has a A+ rating from the Susan B. Anthony List for his abortion-related voting record. He supported the overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, calling the day the decision was made a &quot;great day for the cause and principle of life&quot;.

===9/11 first responders===
In April 2008, the &quot;Daily News&quot; reported that Issa questioned federal expenditures pertaining to disability-compensation claims from 9/11 first responders. He was criticized for making comments that the federal government &quot;&#x27;just threw&#x27; buckets of cash at New York for an attack &#x27;that had no dirty bomb in it, it had no chemical munitions in it&#x27;&quot; and asking &quot;why the firefighters who went there and everybody in the city of New York needs to come to the federal government for the dollars versus this being primarily a state consideration.&quot; In September 2009, Issa&#x27;s office released a statement indicating that his comments had been misrepresented and that the questions he asked concerned the then still unpassed bill H.R. 3543, which, according to the statement, &quot;would give U.S. taxpayer dollars to those who did not suffer physical injury and did not work at or around Ground Zero.&quot;

===2003 California gubernatorial recall election===
Issa came to national prominence in 2003 when he contributed more than $1.6 million to help fund a signature-gathering drive for the petition to recall California Governor Gray Davis. At the time he made the contribution, it was widely believed that Issa intended to run to replace Davis. But after fellow Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger entered the race two days before the filing deadline, Issa announced that he would not run. He later said his mission had been accomplished with Davis&#x27;s recall and that he wanted to continue to represent his district in Congress and work toward Middle East peace. At one point in the campaign he suggested people should vote against recalling Davis unless one of the two leading Republican contenders dropped out, concerned that Schwarzenegger and fellow Republican Tom McClintock would split votes, resulting in Democratic lieutenant governor Cruz Bustamante&#x27;s election. Issa endorsed Schwarzenegger, who won the governorship when Davis was recalled.

===Civil rights===
Issa voted against an amendment, which ultimately failed narrowly, that stated that religious corporations, associations and institutions that receive federal contracts cannot be discriminated against on the basis of religion. Democrats warn that such a provision could potentially allow discrimination against the LGBT community in the name of religious freedom.

===Donald Trump===

Issa attracted attention for his close relationship with and strong support for Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election. He endorsed Trump in March 2016. When the Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording surfaced, Issa condemned Trump&#x27;s remarks but did not rescind his endorsement.

In early February 2017, Issa expressed his support for a special prosecutor to look into Trump&#x27;s ties to Russia. On February 27, he walked back his previous comments. Issa supported Trump&#x27;s dismissal of FBI Director James Comey, saying &quot;Comey had lost my confidence long ago.&quot;

Issa said he believed Russia meddled with the 2016 election. He supported Trump&#x27;s firing of Comey (who was leading the investigation into the meddling) and that said the U.S. should focus on other issues. As of May 2017, Issa had voted in line with Trump&#x27;s positions 100% of the time; by October 2018, that number had fallen to 93.3%.

On January 7, 2021, after Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol building, Issa voted to reject the certification of Pennsylvania&#x27;s electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election. He voted against impeaching Trump on an articles of impeachment for &quot;incitement of insurrection&quot; in the aftermath of the attack on the Capitol. In May 2021, Issa voted against the creation of an independent commission to investigate the January 6 attack.

===Drug policy===

As of 2022, marijuana legalization advocacy group NORML gave Issa an F rating for his cannabis-related voting record.

===Environment===

Before the 2010 election, Issa pledged that, if elected, he would probe &quot;Climategate&quot;, which refers to the hacked Climatic Research Unit emails that climate change denialists falsely asserted showed scientific misconduct and fraud by climate scientists. He called Obama&#x27;s unwillingness to investigate Climategate &quot;unconscionable&quot; and an abdication of responsibility.

===Foreign and defense policy===
In 2001, Issa voted for the authorization of the PATRIOT Act and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. He voted to reauthorize the Patriot Act in 2005 after successfully amending it to require judicial notification, reporting requirements and facts justifying the use of roving surveillance at new facilities or places.

Issa is one of several Lebanese-Americans in Congress. He had a significant role in U.S. peace initiatives in the Middle East. He traveled to Lebanon and Syria in an effort to negotiate the end of the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. In 2003, he appeared at a Washington rally by Iranian groups protesting against the Islamist government in Iran.

In March 2015, Issa supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, saying, &quot;We must make it clear that we will support our allies and punish our enemies through steadfast resolve and decisive action.&quot;

In June 2021, Issa was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (AUMF) against Iraq.

===Health care===
Issa favors repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), and voted in support of the budget resolution to repeal it in January 2017.

On May 4, 2017, Issa voted to repeal Obamacare and pass the American Health Care Act.

The organization San Diego Indivisible protested outside Issa&#x27;s office weekly. After Issa voted for the AHCA, about 800 people from the organization protested, on the grounds that a significant portion of his voters rely on the ACA. The group was also unhappy about a photo in which Issa stood &quot;front and center&quot; in tribute to Republicans&#x27; success in passing the AHCA.

Instead of coming back to California to meet the protesters, Issa flew to an event in Florida to raise money, though he said he would meet with them later.

The next Friday, over 100 people protested his desire to defund Planned Parenthood.

An organization called Save My Care spent $500,000 to release a series of attack ads against 24 House members who voted for the AHCA, including one about Issa.

=== Israel ===
In 2023, he voted for a resolution stating support for Israel against the war launched by Hamas.

===LGBT rights===
On July 19, 2022, Issa and 46 other Republican Representatives voted for the Respect for Marriage Act, which would codify the right to same-sex marriage in federal law.

=== Science ===
Issa supports embryonic stem cell research and has voted to allow it.

He co-sponsored both the 2008 and 2009 versions of the Fair Copyright in Research Works Act and sponsored the Research Works Act () introduced in 2011, all of which aim at a reversal of the NIH&#x27;s Public Access Policy, which mandates open access to NIH-funded research.

=== Tax reform ===

Issa voted against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He was one of two California Republicans to vote against the bill, alongside Dana Rohrabacher. Issa expressed concern that &quot;many&quot; of his constituents would face increased taxes under the proposal and that &quot;Californians have entrusted me to fight for them. I will not make the incredible tax burden they already endure even worse.&quot;

=== Technology ===
Issa opposed the Stop Online Piracy Act because of the amount of discretion it would give the Department of Justice.

=== Veterans ===

The PACT ACT which expanded VA benefits to veterans exposed to toxic chemicals during their military service, received a &quot;nay&quot; from Issa. Regarding cannabis, despite lobbying from VSOs such as the DAV, Issa also voted against the 2022 MORE Act.

==Personal life==

In the 1970s, Issa married his high school sweetheart, Marcia Enyart. They eventually divorced. After he left the military, Issa married Kathy Stanton. The two met while neighbors, when Stanton locked her keys inside her apartment and Issa climbed up the balcony to get into her apartment. They were married in 1980 and had one son. In July 2018, he filed for divorce from Kathy, and their divorce became final in March 2021.

<text>Telephone number mapping is a system of unifying the international telephone number system of the public switched telephone network with the Internet addressing and identification name spaces. Internationally, telephone numbers are systematically organized by the E.164 standard, while the Internet uses the Domain Name System (DNS) for linking domain names to IP addresses and other resource information. Telephone number mapping systems provide facilities to determine applicable Internet communications servers responsible for servicing a given telephone number using DNS queries.

The most prominent facility for telephone number mapping is the [[E.164]] number to URI mapping (ENUM) standard. It uses special DNS record types to translate a telephone number into a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) or IP address that can be used in Internet communications.

==Rationale==
Being able to dial telephone numbers the way customers have come to expect is considered crucial for the convergence of classic telephone service (PSTN) and Internet telephony (Voice over IP, VoIP), and for the development of new IP multimedia services. The problem of a single universal personal identifier for multiple communication services can be solved with different approaches. One simple approach is the Electronic Number Mapping System (ENUM), developed by the IETF, using existing E.164 telephone numbers, protocols and infrastructure to indirectly access different services available under a single personal identifier. ENUM also permits connecting the IP world to the telephone system in a seamless manner.

==System details==
For an ENUM subscriber to be able to activate and use the ENUM service, it needs to obtain three elements from a Registrar:

*A personal Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to be used on the IP part of the network, as explained below.
*One E.164 regular personal telephone number associated with the personal URI, to be used on the PSTN part of the network.
*Authority to write their call forwarding/termination preferences in the NAPTR record accessible via the personal URI.

This works as follows: (1) the Registrar provides the Subscriber (or Registrant) with a domain name, the URI, that will be used for accessing a DNS server to fetch a NAPTR record, (2) a personal E.164 telephone number (the ENUM number). The URI domain name of (1) is biunivocally associated (one-to-one mapped) to the subscriber E.164 ENUM number of (2). Finally (3) the NAPTR record corresponding to the subscriber URI contains the subscriber call forwarding/termination preferences.

Therefore, if a calling party being at the PSTN network dials a called party ENUM number by touch typing the E.164 called party number, the number will be translated at the ENUM gateway into the corresponding URI. This URI will be used for looking-up and fetching the NAPTR record obtaining the called party wishes about how the call should be forwarded or terminated (either on IP or on PSTN terminations) – the so-called access information – which the registrant (the called party) has specified by writing his/her choice at the NAPTR record (&quot;Naming Authority Pointer Resource Records&quot; as defined in ), such as e-mail addresses, a fax number, a personal website, a VoIP number, mobile telephone numbers, voice mail systems, IP-telephony addresses, web pages, GPS coordinates, call diversions or instant messaging. Alternatively, when the calling party is at the IP side, the User Agent (UA) piece of software of the dialler will allow to dial a E.164 number, but the dialler UA will convert it into a URI, to be used for looking-up at the ENUM gateway DNS and fetch the NAPTR record obtaining the called party wishes about how the call should be forwarded or terminated (again, either on IP or on PSTN terminations).

Calling by using a new personal E.164 number (the ENUM number) to look-up at a database is therefore an &quot;indirect calling support service&quot;.

The ITU ENUM allocates a specific zone, namely &quot;e164.arpa&quot; for use with ENUM E.164 numbers on the IP side of the network. defines how any E.164 number, such as +1 555 42 42 can be transformed into a URI, by reversing the numbers, separating them with dots and adding the e164.arpa suffix thus: 2.4.2.4.5.5.5.1.e164.arpa

The URI can then be used for obtaining the Internet Protocol addresses for services such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) VoIP telephony. In the DNS, NAPTR records are used for setting the subscriber call forwarding/termination preferences. Therefore, the whole system can &#x27;translate&#x27; E.164 addresses to SIP addresses. An example NAPTR record is:

This example specifies that if you want to use the &quot;E2U+sip&quot; service, you should use sip:phoneme@example.net as the address. The regular expression can be used by a telephone company to easily assign addresses to all of its clients. For example, if your number is +15554242, your SIP address is sip:4242@555telco.example.net; if your number is +15551234, your SIP address is sip:1234@555telco.example.net.

The following Figure illustrates how ENUM works by giving an example: Subscriber A sets out to call Subscriber B. 
* The user agent of an ENUM-enabled subscriber terminal device, or a PBX, or a gateway, translates the request for the number +34 98 765 4321 in accordance with the rule described in RFC 6116 into the ENUM domain 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.4.3.e164.arpa.
* A request is sent to the DNS for the NAPTR record of the domain name 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.4.3.e164.arpa.
* The query returns a result set of NAPTR records, as per . In the example above, the response is an address that can be reached in the Internet using the VoIP protocol SIP per .
* The terminal application now sets up a communication link, and the call is routed via the Internet.

The ENUM user does not notice anything of this reversal and the DNS database look-up, as this is done automatically behind the scenes using a user agent software in his PC or terminal, or at the PABX or Gateway. For instance, when the user types the telephone number in his web browser ENUM enabled agent and indicates what item of information he is looking for (email address, telephone number, web address, etc.) in the PC or terminal the number is converted to a domain name. This is sent to ENUM servers on the Internet, which send back the NAPTR records associated with the name. The access information and any priority indicated for them are stored in these. The user gets the requested address back on his PC or terminal. ENUM therefore in fact functions as a mechanism for translating a telephone number into a domain name with the requested address or number associated with it, but without the user viewing how this is done, just as he is currently unaware that he is using the DNS when he makes a connection with the Internet or what is going on at the telephone switch when he makes a call.

==Uses==

===Call forwarding===
One way of doing call forwarding with ENUM is illustrated in the next figure. The caller uses the telephone to dial the number of another subscriber, which leads to an ENUM lookup (such as is provided by SIP Broker). The DNS responds to the caller by returning a list with NAPTR records for VoIP communication, telephone numbers and email addresses. Next, an attempt will be made, using the VoIP record from this list, to establish a connection with the subscriber. If the subscriber is not online, the next record selected will be that for a connection to a PSTN or mobile telephone. If this attempt fails too, a voice message will be sent to the subscriber via a listed email address.

Subdomains of e164.arpa are delegated on a country-code basis by the ITU. Each delegation is normally made to a regulatory body designated by the national government for the country code concerned. What happens at a country level is a National Matter. In general the conventional DNS registry-registrar model is used. The national ENUM registry manages and operates the DNS infrastructure and related systems for &quot;country-code&quot;.e164.arpa. It takes registration requests from registrars who are agents of the end users, the registrants. Registrars are typically VoIP providers and telcos who bundle an ENUM registration as part of a VoIP service package. People using an ENUM-enabled VoIP service can dial the registrant&#x27;s existing number and be connected to the registrant&#x27;s VoIP telephone over the Internet instead of using the PSTN. When they call someone who does not use ENUM, calls complete over the Public Switched Telephone Network or PSTN in the usual manner. Support for codice_1 varies widely between countries; many do not support it at all.

Alternative ENUM-like registries have also emerged. These services verify PSTN numbers and can be used in addition to or as an alternative to e164.arpa. However, if the registry in which a callee&#x27;s number is not known by the caller, the choice between registries can create confusion and complexity. Multiple DNS lookups may be needed and it is far from simple to know which E.164 numbers are registered in which of these alternate ENUM-like trees. It is also possible that if an E.164 number is registered in several of these trees, there can be inconsistencies in the information that is returned. Furthermore, the subscriber &quot;owning&quot; a particular E.164 number may not be aware that their number has been entered into one or more of these alternate ENUM-like trees or what information these alternate trees are returning for their E.164 number.

===Called party facility===
ENUM can also be viewed as a called party facility. Basically, it is an indirect dialling service designed to work seamlessly on PSTN and VoIP that builds on the great value of the E.164 numbers: billions of people knowing how to dial using numbers.

If the called person has opted to use ENUM she/he will have published the ENUM number and have entered (via ENUM NAPTR) his/her wishes for how the call should be terminated. This might be a single VoIP identifier, but most likely it will be a list of how the call should be forwarded to various fixed-line, cellphones, secretarial or voice mail services, either at the IP or at the PSTN side of the network. It is the called party choice to opt-in ENUM and also to decide to let the calling party know her/his wishes.

Today when a user places a regular phone call, he has to begin deciding how to establish the call with the other party: via VoIP, Fixed-line PSTN, cellphone, entering a URI or dialling a number. With ENUM indirect dialling it is the called party wishes that matter and solve that decision. Another benefit of indirect dialling is to free the user to change his phone telco, webpage, IMS, email or whatever telecom service he uses without having to tell all his contacts about that.

A presence enhanced ENUM facility having various profiles could automatically change the called party wishes as a function of where he/she is available. This could be a mechanism to automatically switch between cellphone and VoIP to the most convenient (or the less costing) termination.

==ENUM varieties==
One potential source of confusion, when talking about ENUM, is the variety of ENUM implementations in place today. Quite often, people speaking of ENUM are really referring to only one of the following: 
* &quot;Public ENUM&quot;: The original vision of ENUM as a global, public directory-like database, with subscriber opt-in capabilities and delegation at the country code level in the e164.arpa domain. This is also referred to as &quot;user ENUM&quot;.
* &quot;Open Enum&quot;: An effort of mobile carriers and other parties involved in mobile numbering plans to generate complete, public database of all international numbering plan, available via public dns.
* &quot;Private ENUM&quot;: A carrier, VoIP operator or ISP may use ENUM techniques within its own networks, in the same way DNS is used internally to networks.
* &quot;Carrier ENUM&quot;: Groups of carriers or communication service providers agree to share subscriber information via ENUM in private peering relationships. The carriers themselves control subscriber information, not the individuals. Carrier ENUM is also referred to as &quot;infrastructure ENUM&quot;, and is being the subject of new IETF recommendations to support VoIP peering...

==Parties having a direct interest in ENUM==
Various parties are involved with ENUM. These include:

;The registrant or subscriber
:The registrant is the person or subscriber that makes his access information available to others through ENUM. The registrant or subscriber is thus the person whose information has been included in ENUM and must not be confused with the person who uses the Internet to find an address through ENUM.

;The registrar
:The registrar is the party who manages the registrant’s access information and ensures that it is publicly available on the Internet.

;The registry
:The registry is the manager of a national ENUM zone. The registry forms, as it were, the top of the national ENUM hierarchy and ensures that reference is made to the registrars’ servers on which the access information is located.
:Because of the hierarchical structure of the DNS, there can only be one registry for every national ENUM zone. To prevent abuse of this position, requirements are strict with respect to the impartiality of the registry and the costs and quality of the service. In addition every registrant must receive equal and open access.

;The government or the regulator
:Usually a governmental entity or a regulatory authority has control over the National zone of ENUM and will play a role in the appointment of the registry.

;The number holder operator
:Telephony services or telecommunication services operators have been assigned blocks of numbers by the regulator. They subsequently enable their users to use individual telephone numbers from those number blocks. Examples are the numbers for fixed telephony and mobile telephony. The number holder operator will be interconnected to other operators and will receive from them calls to his assigned range of numbers, for the calls to be terminated.
:In ENUM the number holder operator will typically be the gateway operator or, alternatively, will have an arrangement with a gateway operator, to whom he will transit the calls.
:But ENUM is a personal number, meant to be valid for the registrant life. Consequently in ENUM once the operator number holder assigns a number to a registrant, the number belongs to that registrant during his/her entire life.
:Hence, if the registrant wishes to change his initial number holder operator (that might also coincide being his gateway operator) there have to be provisions for the ENUM number to be ported from the initial operator to other number holder operators.
