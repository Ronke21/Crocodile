<text>Niall Garve O&#x27;Donnell (; – 1626) was an Irish nobleman and soldier who claimed the lordship of Tyrconnell, alternately a rebel against and ally of English rule in Ireland. He is best known for siding with the English against his kinsman Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell during the Nine Years&#x27; War.

Although Niall&#x27;s paternal grandfather was O&#x27;Donnell clan chief and Lord of Tyrconnell, his own father was passed over in favour of his half-uncle Hugh McManus O&#x27;Donnell. After a violent succession conflict, Hugh McManus&#x27;s son Hugh Roe—Niall&#x27;s younger cousin by two years—succeeded to the lordship in 1592. A long lasting bitterness ensued between the two cousins.

Niall initially fought for Hugh Roe and the Irish confederacy, but in 1600 he entered secret negotiations with leading royal soldier Henry Docwra. The English government hoped to harness Niall&#x27;s feud against Hugh Roe and promised him the lordship of Tyrconnell for his military assistance. Niall defected in October bringing many followers with him.

Niall&#x27;s skills in guerrilla warfare emboldened the English troops and allowed Docwra to significantly weaken Irish forces in Ulster. However, Niall&#x27;s request that the English government not interfere with his promised lordship was incompatible with the Crown&#x27;s plan for Ireland. After the war ended, Niall was not granted the lands or titles he was promised. In early 1608 Niall instigated fellow spurned loyalist Cahir O&#x27;Doherty to launch a rebellion in Derry, but he was quickly implicated and put on trial. Faced with a sympathetic jury that would almost certainly acquit, the government sent Niall to the Tower of London in 1609, where he remained until his death seventeen years later.

The O&#x27;Donel baronets of Newport House, County Mayo, were descended from Niall&#x27;s grandson Rory.

==Family background==







Niall Garve O&#x27;Donnell was born into the O&#x27;Donnell clan, the ruling Gaelic Irish noble family of Tyrconnell. He was the fourth or eldest son of Conn O&#x27;Donnell, the head of the O&#x27;Donnells&#x27; Clann-Dalaigh branch, and Rose O&#x27;Neill, daughter of the late O&#x27;Neill clan chief Shane O&#x27;Neill. Niall&#x27;s sobriquet &quot;Garve&quot; meant &quot;rough&quot;.

Niall had eight brothers, including Hugh Boye, Conn Oge, Donal Calvagh Oge, Cathbharr and Manus. He also had sisters named Róise, Elizabeth, Siobhan and Máire. As a child, Niall was fostered to the MacLeans of Scotland&#x27;s Western Isles.

Niall&#x27;s paternal grandfather was Calvagh O&#x27;Donnell, who was Lord of Tyrconnell and Chief of the Name &quot;O&#x27;Donnell&quot;. However, at the time of Calvagh&#x27;s death in 1566, Calvagh&#x27;s son Conn was a prisoner in the hands of Shane O’Neill. Thus the lordship passed instead to Calvagh&#x27;s half-brother Hugh McManus O&#x27;Donnell. Conn and his descendants, particularly Niall, looked to the Dublin-based English government as a means of restoring their branch of the family to power. This branch established themselves in Lifford, between the River Finn and Lough Swilly. They were constantly at odds with the ruling O&#x27;Donnells.

== Succession dispute ==
In 1587, Hugh McManus&#x27;s son and tanist Hugh Roe (also Niall&#x27;s younger first cousin once-removed) was kidnapped on the orders of the Lord Deputy and imprisoned in Dublin Castle. Hugh McManus had become senile in his old age, and a violent succession dispute broke out amongst the greater O&#x27;Donnell family over who would succeed him. Three of Niall&#x27;s brothers died during the conflict; in fact, six of his brothers would die in violent circumstances. Calvagh Oge died in 1588, and Manus died in 1589.

Hugh McManus&#x27;s Scottish wife Iníon Dubh effectively took over leadership of Tyrconnell and devoted herself to defending Hugh Roe&#x27;s claim to the chieftaincy. She used her Scottish redshanks to destroy rival claimants, including Calvagh&#x27;s son Hugh MacEdegany in May 1588, and Hugh Roe&#x27;s older half-brother Donal on 14 September 1590. Another elder cousin Hugh Dubh was also a competing claimant. After Hugh MacEdegany&#x27;s death, Niall took over as the head of the MacCalvagh faction. Niall had a significant following within Tyrconnell, but it appears that he was not powerful enough to seriously provoke an assault from Iníon Dubh.

English forces took advantage of the clan&#x27;s internal conflict and began pillaging and raiding across Tyrconnell. At one point Hugh McManus was kidnapped by Captain John Connill, but he was rescued by Niall.

Niall&#x27;s closest ally was his neighbour Turlough Luineach O&#x27;Neill, who had succeeded Niall&#x27;s maternal grandfather Shane as O&#x27;Neill clan chief. At the time Turlough was defending his lands from rival clansman Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone, who had formed an alliance with the ruling O&#x27;Donnell branch. On 1 May 1589, Niall fought alongside Turlough and defeated Tyrone in battle.

In 1591, Inion Dubh temporarily bought off Niall with a political marriage to her daughter—his first cousin once-removed—Nuala. This marriage was the family&#x27;s attempt to temper Niall&#x27;s hostility.

== Succession of Hugh Roe ==
Hugh Roe eventually escaped prison and returned to Tyrconnell in early 1592; Tyrone had bribed officials in Dublin to secure his release. Hugh McManus abdicated in favour of Hugh Roe in April 1592. Niall was incensed at his cousin&#x27;s elevation to the chieftainship. Hugh Roe was inaugurated as clan chief on 3 May 1592, but Niall was conspicuously absent from the inauguration ceremony. Instead, he was in Dublin attempting to secure support from the government.&quot;&quot; His pleas were dismissed.&quot;&quot;Soon after Hugh Roe&#x27;s succession, Hugh Roe and Tyrone attacked Turlough. By May 1593 Turlough was eventually forced into a surrender. As Turlough was a major ally to Niall, this greatly weakened Niall&#x27;s power in Ulster. In July 1592, Hugh Roe submitted to Lord Deputy FitzWilliam at Dundalk. They came to an agreement where FitzWilliam would conditionally overlook Hugh Roe&#x27;s anti-royalist activities—one condition being that Niall be treated fairly.

To destroy his rivals, Hugh Roe surprised Hugh Dubh&#x27;s garrison in Belleek castle, beheading the ward of Belleek and bringing Hugh Dubh to submission. Shortly afterwards, Niall submitted to Hugh Roe through intimidation. Though Niall attended Hugh Roe&#x27;s first hosting, he did so ‘&quot;not through love, but wholly through fear.&quot;

According to historian Terry Clavin, Hugh Roe was anxious to mend the divisions within the O&#x27;Donnell clan in order to make the Irish confederacy stronger. Clavin characterises Hugh Roe as trying to reconcile with Niall rather than suppress him.

== Irish confederacy ==
Niall fought for the Irish confederacy at the beginning of the Nine Years&#x27; War. On Hugh Roe&#x27;s orders, he commanded 60 horsemen, 60 swordsmen and 100 gallowglass to the Battle of Belleek in October 1593. It was one of the first major battles of the war but was secretly planned to result in an Irish failure. This would divert English attention away from Ireland and make the Irish confederacy seem weaker than it actually was. As part of the plan, Hugh Roe was ordered by Tyrone not to send reinforcements. Historian James O&#x27;Neill has theorised that Hugh Roe intentionally dispatched Niall to Belleek with the hope that he would die in the slaughter, thus easily eliminating a potential enemy.

Niall&#x27;s continuing belligerence led him to be detained in February 1594. He was only released when Hugh Roe received one of Niall&#x27;s brothers as a pledge of good behaviour. In late 1597, Niall told two of Hugh Roe&#x27;s enemies, imprisoned in Donegal, that he would join the English if their forces were sent there.&quot;&quot;

In 1597 and 1598, Niall was sent by Hugh Roe on military expeditions into Connacht. Hugh Roe left Niall in charge of the siege of Collooney castle in July 1599.&quot;&quot; However, Niall was alienated when Hugh Roe deprived him of his castle of Lifford, which he had inherited from his father Conn.

== Defection ==

=== Arrival of Docwra ===
In May 1600, English-born soldier Sir Henry Docwra established an English garrison in Derry. Docwra had a policy of fostering divisions in the leading Irish clans in order to win Gaelic support for the Crown. Niall&#x27;s grievances were well-known and Docwra had special instructions to win him over. He believed that Niall&#x27;s resentment against Hugh Roe was a political asset which the English should exploit to its fullest extent. Shortly after Docwra&#x27;s arrival at Derry, he opened up secret communications with Niall. By August, Niall had sent through his list of demands, the principal of which was to rule Tyrconnell in the same manner as his grandfather Calvagh. Docwra promised that, if Niall would do service against Hugh Roe, he would obtain for him a grant of the whole of Tyrconnell. Niall accepted the offer, and the bargain was ratified by the Lord Deputy and council.

In September 1600, Hugh Roe left Ulster for a raid in Clare, leaving Niall in charge of besieging Docwra at Derry. Niall and his followers murdered Niall&#x27;s uncle Neachtan O’Donnell in a drunken rage. Neachtan was &quot;a man of great authority with [Hugh Roe] and all his country&quot;. Fearing the return and revenge of Hugh Roe, Niall quickly defected to the English on October 3.

Additionally, Hugh Roe&#x27;s supporters had become aware of Niall&#x27;s disloyalty and he was rushed into leaving for Derry before he was ready. Niall brought over 200 men with him to Docwra, but would have brought more if not for the shortness of time. His brothers Hugh Boy, Conn Oge and Donal also defected with him.

Niall was one of many other disgruntled Gaelic Irish noblemen who would defect on Docwra&#x27;s promises, including Arthur O&#x27;Neill and Cahir O&#x27;Doherty.

=== Battle of Lifford ===

Accompanied by English forces, Niall marched to Lifford, which had been left in the control of Hugh Roe&#x27;s tanist and younger brother Rory. The loyalists successfully stormed and took control of Lifford on 9 October. Hugh Roe was shocked at Niall&#x27;s betrayal and rushed back to Ulster to besiege the loyalist forces. Despite attempts from Rory and Hugh Roe to retake Lifford, they were unsuccessful.

From Lifford, Niall and his brothers, Hugh, Donnell, and Con, made several raids into Tyrone, and captured Newtown from the O&#x27;Neills. Men, women and children were killed, and 500 cows were pillaged and taken back to Lifford.

This climaxed in the Battle of Lifford on 24 October. During the battle, Niall fatally wounded Rory&#x27;s younger brother Manus. Rory and Niall engaged in single combat, though both men were lucky to leave the battle alive. Docwra was pleased that the feud between Niall and Hugh Roe had been exacerbated, as it pushed Niall further into opposition with the confederacy. By December 1600, Hugh Roe had put a price of £300 on Niall&#x27;s head.

Apparently Niall later made efforts to return to the Irish confederacy, but this was obviously difficult due to his murder of Manus.

=== Military skill ===
Niall Garve O&#x27;Donnell was unrivalled in his use of Ireland&#x27;s terrain as part of guerilla warfare. This skill was a key factor that increased the prowess of English troops in north-west Ulster. His team of spies and his skill in navigating Irish terrain were valuable tools to the English. He also provided intel on Hugh Roe&#x27;s tactics. With Niall as an ally, the English could mobilise across Tyrconnell.

By Docwra&#x27;s admission, Niall&#x27;s service was crucial. After the war, he wrote &quot;I must confess a truth, all by the help and advice of Neal Garbh and his followers, and the other Irish that came in with Sir Arthur O&#x27;Neale, without whose intelligence and guidance little or nothing could have been done of ourselves&quot;.

=== Quarrels with the English ===
In December 1600, Niall travelled to Dublin to meet Lord Deputy Mountjoy. On 18 March 1601, Niall was granted a custodium of Tyrconnell (excepting Ballyshannon and the fishery of the Erne). This recognised him as the O&#x27;Donnell clan chief. But to Niall&#x27;s dismay, fellow loyalist Cahir O&#x27;Doherty was established by Docwra in the lordship of Inishowen, a part of Tyrconnell. Mountjoy was willing to establish Niall in the lordship of Tyrconnell, but wouldn&#x27;t permit him to enforce his supremacy over O&#x27;Doherty. Niall was unwilling to give away any of Tyrconnell, and regarded Mountjoy&#x27;s decision as an infringement of his rights. Niall&#x27;s goal was to rule Tyrconnell in its entirety, in the style of a traditional Gaelic chief. In contrast, the English wanted Tyrconnell to be subsumed under the Kingdom of Ireland, and for Niall to remain under the authority of the Crown. To placate Niall, Docwra gave him control of MacSweeney&#x27;s country. This was the beginning of a growing resentment between Niall and English authorities. When he returned to Derry in April, his relationship with Docwra was beginning to worsen.

=== Further conflict ===
In April 1601, Hugh Roe unexpectedly marched on Niall, forcing him to temporarily retreat to Derry. On 26 May 1601, upon hearing that Tyrone was near Lifford, Niall put together a small group of both Irish and English and attacked Tyrone&#x27;s larger army. Niall&#x27;s forces killed 100 of Tyrone&#x27;s men, and chased Tyrone for miles.

=== Siege of Donegal ===
In August 1601, Niall led an Anglo-Irish force that captured Donegal. In particular Niall was able to capture Donegal&#x27;s Franciscan priory Donegal Abbey, which housed a confederate munition store consisting of &quot;a great chamber full of calivers and muskets, a loft full of pikes, and three of powder, containing by estimation two hundred barrels&quot;.

Niall&#x27;s hold over Donegal virtually stopped Hugh Roe from entering Tyrconnell, and a subsequent month-long siege ensued. It came to a head on 26 September (or 19 September) when a gunpowder explosion in the store caused a raging fire in Donegal Abbey. Hugh Roe hurriedly ordered his men to attack, leading to a chaotic engagement amidst the burning abbey. It seemed that Niall would be defeated, but the loyalist forces held out until reinforcements from Docwra arrived, forcing Hugh Roe to retreat. During the battle, 300 of Niall&#x27;s followers were killed, including his brother Conn Oge, who was buried under fallen stones. It is possible Niall&#x27;s losses came more from the raging fire rather than enemy attacks.

Around this time, Docwra received &quot;many informations against&quot; Niall, but confessed that Niall that &quot;behaued himselfe deservinglie,&quot; and &quot;had many of his men slaine at the siege of Kinsale, and amongst the rest a brother of his owne&quot;.

Niall was so unsettled by the siege that, with Docwra&#x27;s permission, he began negotiating with Hugh Roe. He requested &quot;that in recompense of this service he should be made tánaiste of Tír Chonaill and have the present lordship of all the country between Bearnas Mór and Inishowen and where Niall Garbh’s wife being sister to [Hugh Roe]… that upon this agreement … she was still reserved for Niall to have again&quot;. However, Niall&#x27;s conditions (which included &quot;that [Hugh Roe] and [Niall] should be bound and sworn never to come in sight of one another&quot;) were so numerous that Hugh Roe discarded the negotiations.

=== Siege of Kinsale ===
Niall&#x27;s assistance to the English was a major reason for the weakening of Hugh Roe&#x27;s forces. By the time Irish forces were marching to Kinsale, Niall and Docwra had essentially conquered Tyrconnell and left Hugh Roe with no home to return to. England&#x27;s victory at the Siege of Kinsale crushed the Irish confederacy. After the departure of Hugh Roe from Ireland in 1602, Rory was left as acting chief. Rory and his ally Brian O&#x27;Rourke lost Ballyshannon to Niall in spring 1602.

== Post-war ==
By 1602, Niall was in control of Tyrconnell and was effectively the O&#x27;Donnell clan chief. In March, he was knighted by Mountjoy. However, that year the rift between Niall and Docwra increased as they argued over pay and the division of plundered goods. By end of the year, Niall refused to help or even meet Docwra. In response, Docwra wrote to Dublin accusing Niall of plotting with Tyrone and Hugh Roe against the crown. Given the animosity between Niall and the confederacy leaders, this was clearly a ploy by Docwra. It is possible that Docwra, not well-regarded as a military strategist, was jealous of the plaudits Niall received for his military assistance. Additionally if Niall was disgraced, his land rights would be retracted by the Crown; this would allow Docwra to obtain a grant to parts of Tyrconnell.

On 25 March 1602, Niall and an English force defended Ballyshannon castle against Rory. With Niall&#x27;s strong hold over Tyrconnell, Donough McSweeney Banagh submitted to him and the English. In January 1603, Rory submitted to the English. Niall was alarmed and correctly assumed that the English would pit Rory against him in a power struggle for Tyrconnell. Niall responded by seizing Rory&#x27;s cattle, and he may have even tried to murder Rory.
News of Niall&#x27;s insubordination reached Mountjoy, who summoned him to Dublin with the apparent intention of granting him a patent of Tyrconnell. Niall disobeyed the summons as he had received news of Hugh Roe&#x27;s death in Spain, which had occurred on 30 August 1602. In April 1603, Niall tried to seize the chieftainship and was &quot;inaugurated&quot; as O&#x27;Donnell clan chief in Kilmacrennan with the customary ceremonies. However, he did not have the full required support of the derbfine (electoral kinship group). His chieftainship was repudiated by Hugh Roe&#x27;s surviving family, especially Rory.

In 1603, Caffar Óg O’Donnell and Mulmurry McSweeney Doe went to Tyrconnell, &quot;with their people and cattle, to wage war with Niall Garbh and the English&quot;. Shortly afterwards Caffar Óg was captured by Niall.

Mountjoy initially treated Niall with good faith but was now weary of his insubordinate behaviour; he ordered Niall&#x27;s arrest. Docwra arrested Niall, but allowed him to go to Dublin to plead his cause with Mountjoy in person. Niall subsequently escaped but was pursued by Rory and Docwra. In their bid to recapture the fugitive, they captured all of Niall&#x27;s cattle and starved or killed many of his followers. Niall ultimately gave himself up and was allowed to proceed to London &quot;to solicit pardon for his offences, and to obtain the reward for his service and aid to the crown of England.&quot; Docwra advised that Niall should be imprisoned or executed, but Niall still had several supporters at court.

At the same time Rory also went to London, where the English Privy Council endeavoured to solve the O&#x27;Donnell family quarrel. The council raised Rory to the peerage as 1st Earl of Tyrconnell—effectively the lordship. To Niall, they granted 12,900 acres of land extending from Laght in the parish of Donaghmore to Sheskin-loobanagh in the parish of Croaghonagh. This was the land Niall&#x27;s family had already owned prior to the outbreak of war. This decision failed to satisfy either Niall or Rory.

Niall shortly afterwards complained that he was debarred from the full enjoyment of the lands assigned to him. He smugly refused to formally take out the patent for the lands granted to him (though he retained the land in practice). For the next few years, Niall continued his vendetta with Tyrone and Rory, and engaged with them in land disputes.

== Later life ==
In 1605 Lord Deputy Arthur Chichester tried without success to reconcile their differences. In 1607 Chichester promised Niall lordship of Inishowen.&quot;&quot;

In March 1607, Niall served against Cathbhar Oge O&#x27;Donnell, and was reputed to have &quot;got a blow in the service which he will hardly recover of long time, if he escape with his life&quot;.&quot;&quot;

In September 1607, due to increasing hostility towards former confederacy members, Rory and Tyrone left Ireland for continental Europe. This restored Niall&#x27;s hopes that he could claim the lordship of Tyrconnell.&quot;&quot; However, his claims were ignored, and he is said to have refused the title of Baron of Lifford. By 1608 he was heavily in debt.

=== O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s rebellion ===
In early 1608, it appears Niall encouraged Cahir O&#x27;Doherty to instigate a rebellion against the Crown. O&#x27;Doherty was a Gaelic Irish nobleman who had similarly defected to Docwra&#x27;s forces in 1600. However, he had become angered at his poor treatment by Sir George Paulet, Docwra&#x27;s successor as governor of Derry.

O&#x27;Doherty burnt Derry on 19 April 1608, but Niall stayed aloof from the rebellion. He clearly hoped to be awarded O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s lands of Inishowen in the event of a failed rebellion, as promised by Chichester. Niall rejected meetings with the English, starting bargaining with them over the price of his assistance, and demanded for him to be finally recognised as the rightful Lord of Tyrconnell. When English forces arrived in late May 1608, Niall pledged his assistance in catching O&#x27;Doherty. It appears however that he maintained correspondence with O&#x27;Doherty and warned him of his enemies&#x27; movements. The English quickly grew suspicious.

Niall was charged by his mother-in-law Iníon Dubh with having instigated O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s rebellion. Niall protested his loyalty, but after some delay, and under protection from Treasurer Thomas Ridgeway, Niall and his two brothers (Hugh and Donal) surrendered on 14 June. They were committed, on a charge of corresponding clandestinely with O&#x27;Doherty, &quot;to the custody of the captain of the Tramontane&quot; to be conveyed immediately to Dublin. Niall was charged on six counts of treason and imprisoned in Dublin Castle. Subsequently, many of O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s supporters (including his wife) implicated Niall in the rebellion.

=== Trial ===
The Attorney-General for Ireland, Sir John Davies, found little difficulty in accumulating proof of Niall&#x27;s correspondence with O&#x27;Doherty, but the question arose whether his guilt had not been condoned by his protection. He was not brought to trial until June 1609. During this interval, Niall and his brothers made numerous unsuccessful attempts to escape their confinement.&quot;&quot;

On 1 July Niall was examined before the council and committed to the castle. On Friday, midsummer-eve, he was put on his trial in the king&#x27;s bench. Despite considerable pressure from the government to convict Niall, the Donegal jury feared retribution from Niall&#x27;s supporters and threats of excommunication from the catholic clergy. After three days, Davies realised that the jury would acquit Niall.&quot;&quot; &quot;Pretending that he had more evidence to give for the king, but that he found the jury so weak with long fasting that they were not able to attend the service,&quot; Davies discharged them before they gave their verdict. According to Clavin, these proceedings were &quot;brazenly illegal&quot;.

Davies suggested trial by a Middlesex jury, as in the case of Sir Brian O&#x27;Rourke. Chichester would have liberated the brothers from prison on giving security.

=== Death ===
In October 1609,&quot;&quot; Niall and his son Naghtan were committed to the Tower of London. This is where Niall remained until his death in 1626, aged 57.

== Personality ==
Of the commanders working for the Crown, Niall was one of the most zealous and aggressive in attacking Irish civilians during his raids. He is described by Lughaidh Ó Cléirigh, Hugh Roe&#x27;s biographer, as &quot;a violent man, hasty, austere, since he was spiteful, vindictive, with the venom of a serpent, with the impetuosity of a lion. He was a hero in valour, and brave.&quot; Docwra wrote that Niall was &quot;proud, valiant, miserable, tyrannous, unnecessarily covetous, without any knowledge of God, or almost any civility&quot;. Historian Paul Walsh points out that Docwra would have described any Irishman of his time in this manner, and that because of Niall&#x27;s betrayal of both Gaelic Ireland and the Crown, both Irish and English contemporary sources would be somewhat biased again him.

Philip O&#x27;Sullivan Beare called Niall &quot;a man of great spirit and daring, skilled in military matters&quot;. He references that, despite working for the Protestant Crown, Niall &quot;always retained the Catholic faith and kept aloof from heretical rites.&quot; Indeed, a condition of Niall assisting Docwra was a guarantee of liberty of conscience for himself and his followers.

According to Clavin, Niall &quot;displayed a childlike cunning, even naivety&quot; in his dealings with the English. He was &quot;first and foremost a warrior... unsuited to the role of a landlord&quot;. Robert Dunlop described him as &quot;certainly a most unfortunate and badly used man&quot;.

A bardic poet wrote a poem on Niall&#x27;s ambition to become Lord of Tyrconnell:
== Family ==
Niall Garve married his first cousin once-removed Nuala O&#x27;Donnell, sister of Hugh Roe and Rory. When Nuala heard of her husband&#x27;s defection, she ended their marriage and deserted him. Niall had at least two children: Naghtan and Manus. Historians John O&#x27;Donovan and Eunan O&#x27;Donnell claim that they were Nuala&#x27;s children. Nuala had a daughter named Grania, though it is unclear whether or not Niall was her father. According to historian George Hill, Naghtan had two younger brothers.

A report by Docwra describes Hugh Roe murdering Niall and Nuala&#x27;s child in a furious reaction to his betrayal in 1600:

Docwra&#x27;s biographer John McGurk acknowledges that there is an uncertainty as to the report&#x27;s truthfulness. McGurk points out that Docwra&#x27;s &quot;blunt&quot; personality would indicate that he reported current affairs accurately, though it is unclear where Docwra received this intelligence. If this report is true, it does not explain why Nuala maintained her loyalty to Hugh Roe and Rory. McGurk also acknowledges that infanticide was a feature of warfare in the early modern period. Historian Hiram Morgan notes that since this is a contemporary account, it should not be dismissed out of hand. Regardless, such a child would have been born around 1596.

Following Hugh Roe&#x27;s death in 1602, Nuala joined the household of his successor Rory. When Rory fled to Rome in 1607, Nuala accompanied him, taking her little daughter Grania with her. In 1617, Grania came to England to petition for some provision being made for herself out of her father&#x27;s estate.

In 1602, Niall contemplated a marriage with the widow of Sir Arthur O&#x27;Neill, Turlough Luineach O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s son. It is unknown whether he married her, but according to Paul Walsh, it is unlikely that Niall remained without a partner until his arrest in 1608.

Naghtan was described as &quot;a boy of an active spirit, and yet much inclined to his book&quot;. He studied at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, at the charge of the Earl of Devonshire. In &quot;Alumni Oxonienses&quot; he is given the name Hector. He was then sent to Trinity College Dublin, whence he was transferred to Dublin Castle. He was committed to the Tower of London with his father in October 1609, and died in 1640 during his imprisonment. Historian Eunan O&#x27;Donnell gives Naghtan&#x27;s lifespan as 1591–1624.

Manus was Niall&#x27;s eldest surviving son. He served as a colonel under Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill in the Irish Confederate Wars. He died at the Battle of Benburb on 5 June 1646. The O&#x27;Donel baronets of Newport House in County Mayo are descended from Manus&#x27;s son Rory.

== Legacy ==
According to historian David Finnegan, Irish nationalist historians represent Niall as having betrayed Gaelic Ireland. He has been compared to Dermot MacMurrough, the medieval King of Leinster who incited the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland.

<doc id="297703" wikidata="Q295400" url="?curid=297703" title="Karol Szymanowski">
<text>Karol Maciej Szymanowski (; 3 October 188229 March 1937) was a Polish composer and pianist. He was a member of the modernist Young Poland movement that flourished in the late 19th and early 20th century.

Szymanowski&#x27;s early works show the influence of the late Romantic German school as well as the early works of Alexander Scriabin, as exemplified by his Étude Op. 4 No. 3 and his first two symphonies. Later, he developed an impressionistic and partially atonal style, represented by such works as the Third Symphony and his Violin Concerto No. 1. His third period was influenced by the folk music of the Polish Górale people, including the ballet &quot;Harnasie&quot;, the Fourth Symphony, and his sets of Mazurkas for piano. &quot;King Roger,&quot; composed between 1918 and 1924, remains Szymanowski&#x27;s most popular opera. His other significant works include &quot;Hagith&quot;, Symphony No. 2, &quot;The Love Songs of Hafiz&quot;, and &quot;Stabat Mater&quot;.

Szymanowski was awarded the highest national honors, including the Officer&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta, the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland and other distinctions, both Polish and foreign.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Karol Szymanowski was born into the Korwin-Szymanowski family who were members of wealthy Polish nobility from the Mazovia region, the capital of which is Warsaw. After the fall of Kościuszko Uprising (1794), his great-great grandfather Dominik was exiled from Poland to Dnieper Ukraine. Karol&#x27;s grandfather Feliks later settled in the village of Tymoszówka, which was then in the Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire and is now Tymoshivka in Cherkasy Oblast of Ukraine. His mother came from a Baltic German family that originated in Courland. He studied music privately with his father before enrolling at the Gustav Neuhaus Elisavetgrad School of Music in 1892. From 1901 until 1905, he attended the State Conservatory in Warsaw, of which he was later director from 1926 until retiring in 1930. During that time, he met a number of prominent Polish artists such as Arthur Rubinstein, Grzegorz Fitelberg, Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz and Stefan Żeromski. Since musical opportunities in Congress Poland were quite limited, he traveled throughout Europe and North Africa.

===Career===

In Berlin, Szymanowski founded the Young Polish Composers’ Publishing Company (1905–12), whose primary aim was to publish new works by his countrymen. During his stay in Vienna (1911-1914), he wrote the opera &quot;Hagith&quot; and two song cycles, &quot;The Love Songs of Hafiz&quot;, which represent a transition between his first and second stylistic periods. Being lame in one knee made Szymanowski unsuitable for military service in World War I, and between 1914 and 1917, he composed many works and devoted himself to studying Islamic culture, ancient Greek drama, and philosophy. His works from this period, such as &quot;Mity&quot; (1914; “Myths”), &quot;Metopy&quot; (1915; &quot;Métopes&quot;), and &quot;Maski&quot; (1916; “Masques”), are characterized by great originality and diversity of style. The dynamic extremes in Szymanowski&#x27;s music lessened, and the composer started to employ coloristic orchestration and use polytonal and atonal material while preserving the expressive melodic style of his previous works.

In 1918, Szymanowski completed the manuscript of a two-volume novel, &quot;Efebos&quot;, which took homosexuality as its subject. (&quot;Efebos&quot; or ephebos is the Greek term for a male adolescent.) His travels, especially those to the Mediterranean area, provided him with new experience, both personal and artistic. Arthur Rubinstein found Szymanowski different when they met in Paris in 1921: &quot;Karol had changed; I had already begun to be aware of it before the war when a wealthy friend and admirer of his invited him twice to visit Sicily. After his return, he raved about Sicily, especially Taormina. &#x27;There,&#x27; he said, &#x27;I saw a few young men bathing who could be models for Antinous. I couldn&#x27;t take my eyes off them.&#x27; Now he was a confirmed homosexual. He told me all this with burning eyes.&quot;

Of his works created or first imagined, such as &quot;Król Roger&quot; (King Roger), during 1917-21, both musical and literary, one critic has written: &quot;we have a body of work representing a dazzling personal synthesis of cultural references, crossing the boundaries of nation, race and gender to form an affirmative belief in an international society of the future based on the artistic freedom granted by Eros.&quot; Szymanowski settled in Warsaw in 1919.

===Later life and death===

In 1926, Szymanowski accepted the position of Director of the Warsaw Conservatory, though he had little administrative experience. He became seriously ill in 1928 and temporarily lost his post. He was diagnosed with an acute form of tuberculosis, and in 1929 traveled to Davos, Switzerland, for medical treatment. Szymanowski resumed his position at the Conservatory in 1930, but the school was closed two years later by a ministerial decision. He moved to Villa Atma in Zakopane where he composed fervently. In Zakopane, Szymanowski developed a keen interest in the Polish folk idiom and undertook to create a Polish national style, an endeavour not attempted since the times of Chopin. He immersed himself in the culture of the Polish Highlanders (Gorals) and embraced their tonal language, syncopated rhythms, and winding melodies in his music. In 1936, Szymanowski received more treatment at a sanatorium in Grasse, but it was no longer effective. He died at a sanatorium in Lausanne on 29 March 1937. His body was brought back to Poland by his sister Stanisława and laid to rest at Skałka in Kraków, the &quot;national Panthéon&quot; for the most distinguished Poles.

Szymanowski&#x27;s long correspondence with the pianist Jan Smeterlin, a significant champion of his piano works, was published in 1969.

==Influences==
Szymanowski was influenced by the music of Richard Wagner, Richard Strauss, Max Reger, Alexander Scriabin and the impressionism of Claude Debussy, and Maurice Ravel. He was also significantly influenced by his countryman Frédéric Chopin and by Polish folk music. Like Chopin, he wrote a number of mazurkas for piano. He was specifically influenced by the folk music of the Polish Highlanders, which he discovered in Zakopane in the southern Tatra highlands. He wrote in his article &quot;About Goral Music&quot;: &quot;My discovery of the essential beauty of Goral music, dance and architecture is a very personal one; much of this beauty I have absorbed into my innermost soul&quot;. According to Jim Samson, it is &quot;played on two fiddles and a string bass&quot; and &quot;has uniquely &#x27;exotic&#x27; characteristics, highly dissonant and with fascinating heterophonic effects&quot;.

Aleksander Laskowski has said of Szymanowski&#x27;s music and its changing style: &quot;He invented a musical language [...] His works were true and ingenious creations. And his oeuvre shows an incredible development from the Straussian and Wagnerian, through an interesting and very romantic Oriental period, and finishing with a national period influenced by his time in the Tatras.&quot;

==Works==
Among Szymanowski&#x27;s better-known orchestral works are four symphonies (including No. 3, &quot;Song of the Night&quot;, with choir and vocal soloists, and No. 4, &quot;Symphonie Concertante&quot;, with piano concertante) and two violin concertos. His stage works include the ballets &quot;Harnasie&quot; and &quot;Mandragora&quot; and the operas &quot;Hagith&quot; and &quot;King Roger&quot;. He wrote much piano music, including the four &quot;Études&quot;, Op. 4 (of which No. 3 was once his most popular piece), many mazurkas and &quot;Métopes&quot;. Other works include the &quot;Three Myths&quot; for violin and piano, &quot;Nocturne and Tarantella&quot;, two string quartets, a sonata for violin and piano, a number of orchestral songs (some to texts by Hafiz and James Joyce) and his &quot;Stabat Mater&quot;.

According to Samson, &quot;Szymanowski adopted no thorough-going alternatives to tonal organization [...] the harmonic tensions and relaxations and the melodic phraseology have clear origins in tonal procedure, but [...] an underpinning tonal framework has been almost or completely dissolved away.&quot;

==Recognition==
Szymanowski&#x27;s music has received international recognition. In the 1920s and the 1930s, his music proved immensely popular. His works were performed throughout the world by soloists such as Arthur Rubinstein, Harry Neuhaus, Robert Casadesus, Paweł Kochański, Bronisław Huberman, Joseph Szigeti, and Jacques Thibaud, and by orchestras led by conductors including Emil Młynarski, Albert Coates, Pierre Monteux, Philippe Gaubert, Leopold Stokowski, and Willem Mengelberg. European and American performances of his &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; were world-scale events, progressing successfully in Naples, Paris, Liège, New York, Chicago and Worcester. A performance of &quot;King Roger&quot; in Prague on 21 October 1932 directed by Josef Munclingr closely reflected Szymanowski&#x27;s own idea of the piece, and was a huge success, as was the stage production of &quot;Harnasie&quot;. A Polish recording of his Symphony No. 4 in 1932 was followed by a series of performances abroad, mostly with Szymanowski at the piano and conducted by Grzegorz Fitelberg. In 1933, the symphony was performed in London, Bologna, Cleveland; Moscow, Zagreb, Bucharest; in 1934 in Paris, Sofia, London; in 1935 in Stockholm, Oslo, Bergen, Berlin, Rome, Liège and Maastricht; and in 1937 in The Hague.

==Recordings==
In 1994, Charles Dutoit recorded both of Szymanowski&#x27;s violin concertos with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. English conductor Sir Simon Rattle has called Szymanowski &quot;one of the greatest composers of this [20th] century” and produced a series of recordings with the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. In 2004, Scottish violinist Nicola Benedetti won the BBC Young Musician of the Year with a performance of Szymanowski’s Violin Concerto No. 1. In 2008, &quot;King Roger&quot; was performed at Edinburgh International Festival under the baton of Valery Gergiev and the Mariinsky opera company. In 2012, Gergiev led the London Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s performance of all four of Szymanowski&#x27;s symphonies at the Edinburgh International Festival. In 2015, &quot;King Roger&quot; was staged in London&#x27;s Royal Opera House, produced by Kasper Holten. In the past two decades, Szymanowski&#x27;s music has enjoyed a revival and been performed around the world. It has been recorded by conductors and musicians such as Pierre Boulez, Edward Gardner, Vladimir Jurowski, Mark Elder and Krystian Zimerman.

==Remembrance==

Szymanowski received numerous awards, including the Officer Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta; the Officer of the Order of the Crown of Italy; the Commander of the Order of the Crown of Italy; the Knight of Legion d&#x27;Honneur; an honorary plaque at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia; the Commander Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta; and the Academic Golden Laurel of the Polish Academy of Literature, Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland. He was also a Doctor Honoris Causa of the Jagiellonian University, Kraków and an honorary member of the Czech Academy of Learning, the Latvian Conservatory of Music in Riga, the St Cecilia Royal Academy in Rome, the Royal Academy of Music in Belgrade, and the International Society for Contemporary Music.

On 16 November 2006, the Polish Parliament passed a resolution to name 2007 &quot;The Year of Karol Szymanowski&quot; to honour the 125th anniversary of his birth and the 70th anniversary of his death. On 3 October 2007, the National Bank of Poland issued special commemorative coins depicting Szymanowski in the following denominations: zl 200, zl 10 zloty and zl 2. The Karol Szymanowski Academy of Music in Katowice and the Kraków Philharmonic are both named for him. On 11 November 2018, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the regaining of Polish independence, President Andrzej Duda posthumously awarded Szymanowski and 24 other distinguished Poles Poland&#x27;s highest decoration, the Order of the White Eagle. Szymanowski inspired the character of composer Edgar Szyller in Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz&#x27;s novel &quot;Fame and Glory&quot; (Polish: &quot;Sława i chwała&quot;).

On 3 October 2023, Szymanowski was celebrated with a Google Doodle for his 141st birthday.

<doc id="297713" wikidata="Q6753207" url="?curid=297713" title="Manus O'Donnell">
<text>Manus O&#x27;Donnell (Irish: &quot;Maghnas Ó Domhnaill&quot; or &quot;Manus Ó Domhnaill&quot;; 1490 – 9 February 1563) was a Gaelic Irish lord and King of Tyrconnell. After his father Hugh Dubh&#x27;s death in 1537, Manus succeeded as Tyrconnell&#x27;s ruler. In 1555 he was imprisoned and deposed by his son Calvagh, who effectively took over the kingdom&#x27;s leadership. Manus died during his imprisonment in Lifford.

==Early life==
Manus O&#x27;Donnell was born in 1490 into the O&#x27;Donnell clan, a Gaelic Irish noble family which ruled Tyrconnell, a kingdom geographically associated with present-day County Donegal. Manus&#x27;s father, Hugh Dubh (pronounced in Ulster Irish as &#x27;Hugh Doo&#x27;), had been &quot;Rí&quot; (king) of the O&#x27;Donnells during one of the bitterest and most protracted of the feuds between his clan and the O&#x27;Neills, which in 1491 led to a war lasting more than ten years. Hugh Dubh left Manus to rule Tyrconnell, though still a boy, when he went on a pilgrimage to Rome in about 1511. On his return from Rome (via England, where he was knighted by King Henry VIII) in broken health after two years&#x27; absence, Manus, who had proved himself a capable leader in defending his country against the O&#x27;Neills, retained the chief authority. According to the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;, Manus was inaugurated by &quot;the successors of St. Columbkille, with the permission and by the advice of the nobles of Tirconnell, both lay and ecclesiastical.&quot; When Sir Hugh Dubh O&#x27;Donnell, as he was now, appealed for aid against his son to the Maguires, Manus made an alliance with the O&#x27;Neills, by whose assistance he established his hold over Tyrconnell. But in 1522 the two great northern clans were again at war.

Conn Bacagh O&#x27;Neill, &quot;An Ó Néill&quot; (who was created The 1st Earl of Tyrone in 1542), was determined to bring the O&#x27;Donnells under his rule. Supported by Munster and Connacht, and assisted also by English contingents and by the MacDonnells of Antrim, O&#x27;Neill took the castle of Ballyshannon, and after devastating a large part of Tyrconnell he encamped at Knockavoe, near Strabane. Here he was surprised at night by Sir Hugh Dubh and Manus O&#x27;Donnell, and routed with the loss of 900 men and an immense quantity of booty in the Battle of Knockavoe. Although this was one of the bloodiest ever battles between the O&#x27;Neills and the O&#x27;Donnells, it did not end the war; and in 1531 O&#x27;Donnell applied to the Lordship of Ireland for protection, giving assurances of allegiance to King Henry VIII.

==Geraldine League==
In February 1537, The 10th Earl of Kildare (previously known as Lord Offaly, and better known to history as &#x27;Silken Thomas&#x27;) and his five uncles were executed at Tyburn for their rebellion in Leinster. Following their executions, the English Crown made every effort to capture Gerald, 11th Earl of Kildare, the new head of the FitzGerald dynasty and the new claimant to the Earldom of Kildare, a boy of twelve who was in the secret custody of his aunt, Lady Eleanor McCarthy.

Lady Eleanor, in order to secure a powerful protector for the boy, accepted an offer of marriage from Manus O&#x27;Donnell, who on the death of Sir Hugh Dubh in July 1537 was inaugurated as &quot;The O&#x27;Donnell&quot;. Conn O&#x27;Neill (later Earl of Tyrone) was a relative of the young Lord Kildare, and this event accordingly led to the formation of the short-lived Geraldine League, a federation including the O&#x27;Neills, the O&#x27;Donnells, the O&#x27;Briens of Thomond, and other powerful clans; the primary object of which was to restore young Lord Kildare to his lands, titles and properties, but which afterwards aimed at the complete overthrow of English rule in Ireland.

==Chief of the O&#x27;Donnells==
In August 1539, O&#x27;Donnell and Conn O&#x27;Neill were heavily defeated by the Lord Deputy at Lake Bellahoe, in County Monaghan, which crippled their power for many years. In the west Manus made unceasing efforts to assert the supremacy of the O&#x27;Donnells in north Connacht, where he compelled O&#x27;Conor Sligo to acknowledge his over-lordship in 1539. In 1542 he went to England and presented himself, together with Conn O&#x27;Neill and other Irish chiefs, became a Protestant, and recognised Henry VIII, who promised to make him Earl of Tyrconnell, though he refused O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s request to be made Earl of Sligo. The assimilation process was known as &quot;surrender and regrant&quot;.

By the early 1500s, O’Donnell was a significant patron of the arts in Ulster, and he took a particular interest in the trade and customs of the Continent. Rather than dressing in the ancient Gaelic styles, he adopted the fashion of contemporary Spanish noblemen. His dress was described in 1542 as “furnisht of other apparrail better than any Irishman, for at such time as he mette with me he was in a coat of crimoisin velvet with aiglettes of gold, twenty or thirty pair, over that a great doble cloke of right crimoisin satin, garded with black velvet, a bonnet with a feather set full of aiglettes of gold: that methough it strange to see him in so honorable an apparrail, and all the rest of his nacion that I have seen as yet, so vile”.

In his later years, Manus was troubled by quarrels between his sons Hugh and Calvagh; in 1555 he was imprisoned by Calvagh, who deposed him from all authority in Tyrconnell. Manus died in Lifford on 9 February 1563. Manus O&#x27;Donnell, though a fierce warrior, was hospitable and generous to the poor and the Church. He is described by the Four Masters as &quot;a learned man, skilled in many arts, gifted with a profound intellect, and the knowledge of every science.&quot; At his castle of Portnatrynod near Strabane, he supervised, if he did not actually dictate, the writing of the &quot;Life of Saint Columbkille&quot; in Irish, which is preserved in the Bodleian Library (Rawlinson B 514) at Oxford. He was also a poet and many of his poems, written in Irish, survive.

==Family==
Manus was married several times. His first wife, Joan O&#x27;Reilly, was the mother of Calvagh, and two daughters, both of whom married O&#x27;Neills; the younger, Margaret, was the wife of the famous rebel Shane O&#x27;Neill. His second wife, Hugh&#x27;s mother, by whom he was an ancestor of the Earls of Tyrconnell (see below), was Judith, sister of Conn Bacach O&#x27;Neill, 1st earl of Tyrone, and aunt of Shane.

<text>Sir William Dugdale (12 September 1605 – 10 February 1686) was an English antiquary and herald. As a scholar he was influential in the development of medieval history as an academic subject.

==Life==

Dugdale was born at Shustoke, near Coleshill in Warwickshire, where his father, John Dugdale, was steward to the local landowner. As he was born, a swarm of bees flew into the garden, which some considered &quot;a happy presage on the life of the babe&quot;.

He was educated at King Henry VIII School, Coventry. In 1623, he married Margaret Huntbach (1607–81), with whom he had nineteen children. In 1625, the year after his father&#x27;s death, he purchased the manor of Blyth, near Shustoke. During an enclosure dispute with a neighbour a few years later he met the Leicestershire antiquary William Burton, who acted as arbitrator. He became involved in transcribing documents and collecting church notes and met other Midlands antiquaries such as Sir Simon Archer (1581–1662) and Sir Thomas Habington. He began working with Archer on the history of Warwickshire and their research led them to the archives of public records in London. There he met Sir Christopher Hatton, Sir Henry Spelman, Sir Simonds d&#x27;Ewes and Sir Edward Dering. Hatton provided him with hospitality in Holborn and became his principal patron.

In 1638, through the influence of his friends Dugdale was created a pursuivant of arms extraordinary by the name of Blanche Lyon, and, in 1639, he was promoted to the office of Rouge Croix Pursuivant of Arms in Ordinary. The accommodation in the College of Arms and the income from his post enabled him to pursue his research in London. 

According to his later account, in 1641 Sir Christopher Hatton, foreseeing the English Civil War and dreading the ruin and spoliation of the Church, commissioned him to make exact drafts of all the monuments in Westminster Abbey and the principal churches in England.
In June 1642, he was summoned with the other heralds to attend the king at York. When the war broke out Charles deputed him to summon the castles of Banbury and Warwick to surrender. 

He witnessed the Battle of Edgehill, and later returned with a surveyor to make a survey of the battlefield. He arrived in Oxford with the king in November 1642 and he was admitted MA of the University. He worked as a bureaucrat in the royalist capital, especially after December 1643 when Hatton was appointed Comptroller of the Household. In 1644 the king appointed him Chester Herald of Arms in Ordinary.

During his leisure at Oxford he collected material at the Bodleian Library and college libraries for his books. It was during these years that he met Elias Ashmole, who later became his son-in-law. Following the surrender of Oxford in 1646 Dugdale returned to Blyth Hall and compounded for his estates under the terms of the Oxford articles. Hatton, who had opposed the surrender, went into exile in France, where Dugdale visited him in 1648. 

He recommenced his antiquarian researches, collaborating with Roger Dodsworth on the &quot;Monasticon Anglicanum&quot;, the first volume of which was published in 1655. In the following year he published his own &quot;Antiquities of Warwickshire&quot;, which was soon recognised as a model county history. In this work he was one of the first to consider the significance of stone tools, stating these were &quot;weapons used by the Britons before the art of making arms of brass or iron was known&quot;.

At the Restoration Dugdale obtained the office of Norroy King of Arms through the influence of the Earl of Clarendon. In the office of Norroy he undertook heraldic visitations of the counties north of the Trent. 

In 1677 he was knighted and promoted to the office of Garter Principal King of Arms, which he held until his death. In his last years he wrote an account of his life at the request of Anthony Wood. He died &quot;in his chair&quot; at Blyth Hall in Warwickshire in 1686, aged 80. His house is still occupied by his descendants.

<doc id="297723" wikidata="Q465072" url="?curid=297723" title="Mata Amritanandamayi">
<text>Sri Mātā Amritānandamayī Devi (born Sudhamani Idamannel; 27 September 1953), often known as Amma (&quot;Mother&quot;), is an Indian Hindu spiritual leader, guru and humanitarian, who is revered as &#x27;the hugging saint&#x27; by her followers. She is the chancellor of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, a multi-campus research university.

In 2018, she was felicitated by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for making the largest contribution to the Government of India&#x27;s Clean India Campaign Swachh Bharat Mission. She was the first recipient of Vishwaratna Puraskar (Gem of the World Award) by Indian Parliament.

==Life==
Mātā Amritānandamayī Devi is an Indian guru from Parayakadavu (now partially known as Amritapuri), Alappad Panchayat in Karunagappally, Kollam District, in the state of Kerala. Born to a family of backward-caste Malayali fishermen on 27 September 1953, she was the third child of Sugunanandan and Damayanti. Her mother Damayanti died on 19 September 2022. She has six siblings.

As part of her chores, Amṛtānandamayī gathered food scraps from neighbours for her family&#x27;s cows and goats, through which she was confronted with the intense poverty and suffering of others. She would bring these people food and clothing from her own home. Her family, which was not wealthy, scolded and punished her. Amṛtānandamayī began to spontaneously embrace people to comfort them in their sorrow. Despite the reaction of her parents, Amṛtānandamayī continued. Regarding her desire to embrace others, Amṛtānandamayī commented, &quot;I don&#x27;t see if it is a man or a woman. I don&#x27;t see anyone different from my own self. A continuous stream of love flows from me to all of creation. This is my inborn nature. The duty of a doctor is to treat patients. In the same way, my duty is to console those who are suffering.&quot;

Amṛtānandamayī rejected numerous attempts by her parents to arrange for her marriage. In 1981, after spiritual seekers had begun residing at her parents&#x27; property in Parayakadavu in the hopes of becoming Amṛtānandamayī&#x27;s disciples, the Mātā Amṛtānandamayī Math (MAM), a worldwide foundation, was founded. Amṛtānandamayī continues to serve as chairperson of the Math. Today the Mata Amritanandmayi Math is engaged in many spiritual and charitable activities.

In 1987, at the request of devotees, Amṛtānandamayī began to conduct programmes in countries throughout the world. She continues to do so annually.

==Darshan==
Amṛtānandamayī&#x27;s form of giving darshana is hugging people. As to how this began, Amṛtānandamayī said, &quot;People used to come and tell [me] their troubles. They would cry and I would wipe their tears. When they fell weeping into my lap, I used to hug them. Then the next person too wanted it... And so the habit picked up.&quot; Amṛtānandamayī has embraced more than 33 million people throughout the world for over 30 years.

When asked, in 2002, to what extent she thought her embraces helped the ills of the world, Amṛtānandamayī replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t say I can do it 100 percent. Attempting to change the world [completely] is like trying to straighten the curly tail of a dog. But society takes birth from people. So by affecting individuals, you can make changes in the society and, through it, in the world. You cannot change it, but you can make changes. The fight in individual minds is responsible for the wars. So if you can touch people, you can touch the world.&quot;

Amṛtānandamayī&#x27;s darshan has been the centrepiece of her life, as she has received people nearly every day since the late 1970s. Given the size of the crowds coming to seek Amṛtānandamayī&#x27;s blessings, there have been times when she has given darshana for more than 20 continuous hours. At the time of Covid-19 she stopped giving darshana and hugging people.

==Teachings and public image==

In the book &quot;The Timeless Path&quot;, Swami Ramakrishnananda Puri, one of Amṛtānandamayī&#x27;s senior disciples, wrote: &quot;The [spiritual] path inculcated by Amma is the same as the one presented in the Vedas and recapitulated in subsequent traditional scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita.&quot; Amṛtānandamayī herself says, &quot;&quot;karma&quot; [action], &quot;jñana&quot; [knowledge] and &quot;bhakti&quot; [devotion] are all essential. If the two wings of a bird are devotion and action, knowledge is its tail. Only with the help of all three can the bird soar into the heights.&quot; She accepts the various spiritual practices and prayers of all religions as but different methods toward the same goal of purifying the mind. Along these lines, she stresses the importance of meditation, performing actions as karma yoga, selfless service, and cultivating divine qualities such as compassion, patience, forgiveness, self-control, etc. Amṛtānandamayī has said that these practices refine the mind, preparing it to assimilate the ultimate truth: that one is not the physical body and mind, but the eternal, blissful consciousness that serves as the non-dual substratum of the universe. This understanding itself Amṛtānandamayī referred to as &quot;jivanmukti&quot; [liberation while alive]. Amṛtānandamayī said, &quot;&quot;Jivanmukti&quot; is not something to be attained after death, nor is it to be experienced or bestowed upon you in another world. It is a state of perfect awareness and equanimity, which can be experienced here and now in this world, while living in the body. Having come to experience the highest truth of oneness with the Self, such blessed souls do not have to be born again. They merge with the infinite.&quot;

Amritanandamayi is known for frequently referring to herself in the third person as &quot;Amma&quot;, which is a common spiritual practice in Hinduism.

==Social issues==
In her public talks and in articles, Amritanandamayi has taken up several social issues, including the importance of selfless service, the need for inter-religious harmony, for environmental protection and of desegregating science and spirituality. She also regularly speaks on the importance of women&#x27;s empowerment and gender equality as well as that of humankind cultivating what she refers to as &quot;viśva-mātrutvam&quot; — an attitude of motherliness towards all beings in creation, specifically through expressing compassion, patience and selflessness. She has also spoken out against human trafficking and forced prostitution, speaking at the Vatican and signing the Universal Declaration Against Slavery in an event organized by Pope Francis at the Vatican in 2014.
And in 2018, under the patronage of Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, she participated in a similar event aimed at protecting children from abuse and predation via the Internet. In July 2015, Amritanandamayi delivered the keynote address at a United Nations Academic Impact conference on technology and sustainable development, co-hosted by Amrita University. There, she requested the scientific community to infuse its research with awareness and compassion, stressing the importance of keeping the aim of uplifting the poor and suffering in mind when undertaking technological research. She has spoken several times at the United Nations and twice at the Parliament of the World&#x27;s Religions.

==Bhajans==

Amṛtānandamayī has recorded more than 1,000 bhajans, or devotional songs, in 35 languages. She has also composed dozens of bhajans and set them to traditional ragas. Regarding devotional singing as a spiritual practice, Amṛtānandamayī says, &quot;If the bhajan is sung with one-pointedness, it is beneficial for the singer, the listeners, and Nature as well. Later when the listeners reflect on the songs, they will try to live in accordance with the lessons enunciated therein.&quot; Amṛtānandamayī has said that in today&#x27;s world, it is often difficult for people to attain deeply focused concentration in meditation. A person can be aided in reaching this level of concentration with bhajans.

==Humanitarian work==
Amritanandamayi is founder and chairman of the Mata Amritanandamayi Math and the founder of Embracing the World. Embracing the World is a global network of local and regional charitable organizations and projects that has grown out of the Mata Amritanandamayi Math&#x27;s India-based charitable projects. The organizations&#x27; focus is on providing the poor with the five basic needs of food, shelter, healthcare, education and livelihood. The organizations also conduct work in the fields of disaster relief and environmental protection as well as on conducting research and developing new technologies to help the poor and needy.

===Food===
In India, the Mata Amṛtānandamayī Math provides 10 million free meals to poor people annually via its various centres. Likewise, Embracing the World feed more than 150,000 annually in North America through 49 centres that conduct a program called Mother&#x27;s Kitchen, started in 1987. Other feed-the-hungry programs exist in Mexico, Costa Rica, France, Spain, Kenya, Brazil, Slovenia and Australia. The Math is deploying filtration systems with the goal of providing clean drinking water in 5,000 village centres throughout India, which would provide water purification to 10 million villagers.

===Shelter===
Since 1998, the Mata Amritanandamayi Math has constructed over 47,000 houses for the homeless in 75 locations throughout India. It runs an orphanage for 500 children in Kerala, and Embracing the World manages a children&#x27;s home in Nairobi.

===Healthcare===
The Mata Amritanandamayi Math manages the 1,100-bed super-speciality hospital Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences in Kochi, which it launched in 1998, as well as several other free healthcare clinics, medicine dispensaries, hospices in India. It is also in the process of constructing a 2,000-bed hospital in Delhi NCR. In total, the math has provided totally free medical care and surgeries to more than four million people since 1998. This includes super-specialty surgeries including heart surgeries, brain surgeries and kidney transplants. Aside from free treatment, Amrita Institute provides care on a sliding scale, allowing people to pay what they can afford. This is often a minimal percent of the total medical cost.

On 24 August 2022, another hospital named Amrita Hospital was inaugurated by the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi in Faridabad, Haryana. This hospital is reportedly the largest private hospital ever built in India, with a built up area of 3.6 million square feet and a capacity of 2600 beds.

===Livelihood===
In 1998, the Math started a program titled Amrita Nidhi that provides lifetime pensions to destitute widows and to people who are physically and mentally challenged. As of 2019, a total of 100,000 people were enrolled. It also started AmritaSREE (Self-Reliance, Empowerment &amp; Employment) in 2006. This program has helped more than 200,000 women form self-help groups throughout India.

===Education===
Amṛtānandamayī is founder and chancellor of Amrita University, an eight-campus, multi-disciplinary research university that in 2020 was ranked as the fourth-best university in India by NIRF, is accredited with an &#x27;A&#x27; grade by NAAC, and was selected as an &quot;Institute of Eminence&quot; by the Indian Government in 2019. Under her guidance, the university puts a strong focus on research-and-development to uplift the sick and poor. The Mata Amṛtānandamayī Math also runs a scholarship program that currently provides 50,000 scholarships for economically challenged children throughout India, and Embracing the World provides scholarships outside of India in times of need, such as in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.

===Disaster relief===
Within India, the Mata Amṛtānandamayī Math has been involved in relief-and-rehabilitation efforts following natural disasters since 2001, and Embracing the World has come to aid in the wake of several disasters outside of India as well. Embracing the World has provided a total of $75 million in disaster-relief work since 2004. The disasters after which the Mata Amṛtānandamayī Math and Embracing the World have conducted relief-and-rehabilitation work include: the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Hurricane Katrina (2005), the 2008 Bihar flood, the 2005 Gujarat flood, the Maharashtra floods of 2005, Cyclone Aila of 2009, the 2010 Haiti Earthquake, the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the 2013 North India floods, Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, the 2014 India–Pakistan floods, the May 2015 Nepal earthquake, the 2015 South Indian floods, the Puttingal temple fire of 2016, Hurricane Maria of 2017, Cyclone Ockhi of 2017, the 2018 Kerala floods, and the 2019 Kerala floods. In 2019, the Math gave Rs. 500,000 to each of the families of the 40 CRPF soldiers who were killed in the 2019 Pulwama attack.

===Environmental protection===
On 11 September 2015, Amṛtānandamayī donated US$15 million to the Government of India&#x27;s Namami Gange &quot;Clean the Ganges&quot; program for the specific purpose of constructing toilets for poor families living along the Ganges River. On 27 September 2015, Amṛtānandamayī pledged that her NGO would dedicate the value of another US$15 million to toilet construction and other sanitation efforts specifically in the Indian state of Kerala. Amritanandamayi&#x27;s organization has been cleaning the Pampa River and Sabarimala Kerala Temple pilgrimage site annually since 2012.

==Controversies==

===Book by Sreeni Pattathanam===
Sreeni Pattathanam, the Kerala-based head of the Indian Rationalist Association, wrote &quot;Matha Amritanandamayi: Sacred Stories and Realities&quot;, a controversial critique first published in 1985. The author said all the &quot;miracles&quot; of Amṛtānandamayī were falsified. It was further written that there had been many suspicious deaths in and around her ashram that required police investigation.

On 9 August 2002, a &quot;Deshabhimani&quot;, a left-leaning Malayalam daily, published a similar account, demanding investigation into the same deaths Pattathanam found suspicious. On 24 September 2002, &quot;Deshabhimani&quot; officially apologised for the report, publishing an article titled &quot;Report that Suspicious Deaths at Amritanandamayi Math Are Growing Was Incorrect&quot;. The article stated: &quot;We now state with conviction that there was nothing suspicious about deaths that happened in the Math. Some of the deaths mentioned in the article did not even take place at the Math.&quot; The article went on to explain that relatives of the deceased had personally contacted Deshabhimani in order to correct the misinformation conveyed in the original article. In several cases, the editors noted the relatives had contacted Deshabhimani to explain they were at the bedsides of elderly kin who had died of natural causes, with no suspicious aspects regarding the passings.

In 2004, the Kerala State Government sanctioned criminal prosecution of Patthathanam, the owner of the publishing company, and the printer of the book on grounds that religious sentiments had been offended and for the libelous statements in the book. The order followed directions from the Kerala High Court to the Home Department for considering an application by T. K. Ajan, a resident of the Mata Amṛtānandamayī Math. CPI leader Thengamam Balakrishnan protested the move against Pattathanam. The contents of this book in English: 

===Source of foreign aid===

In June 2007, Shantanu Guha Ray wrote in &quot;Tehelka&quot; weekly that Amṛtānandamayī Math, Ravi Shankar, Baba Ramdev, and other NGOs and religious organisations had large annual turnover of INR crores. In June 2007, novelist Paul Zacharia wrote on Tehelka that Amṛtānandamayī is free from the typical scrutiny on money that has foreign connections. In May 2008, the president of Kerala Yukthivadi Sangham, U. Kalanathan, urged the state government to conduct an enquiry into Amṛtānandamayī&#x27;s assets. He said the sources of her income and its utilisation should be investigated.

===Allegations by Gail Tredwell===
In 2013, Gail Tredwell, a former disciple of Amṛtānandamayī, self-published a memoir of her 1980–99 tenure in Amṛtānandamayī&#x27;s ashram. She made some allegations in this memoir as well as media interviews which preceded and followed the release of the book. The allegations, including the claim that Tredwell was physically assaulted by Amṛtānandamayī, have not been substantiated. Both Amṛtānandamayī and representatives of her ashram denied the allegations, saying that they were untrue and were aimed at exacting revenge for unfulfilled desires. In an interview in April 2014, Amṛtānandamayī spoke in depth about the incident, saying, &quot;Even now, Amma is only filled with love for that daughter. I am praying that virtue and goodness come. Time will shine forth the truth.&quot;

==Attacks==
In August 2005, Amṛtānandamayī was attacked by a man named Pavithran. He was sitting with other followers praying and singing in front of Amṛtānandamayī. He rushed to Amṛtānandamayī with a knife, but was overpowered by a group of disciples. Amṛtānandamayī&#x27;s disciple Swami Amritaswarupananda Puri said Pavithran was of &quot;unstable mind&quot;. Pavithran was bruised and taken to a hospital. Amritanandamayi, who forgave Pavithran, said, &quot;All those who are born will die one day. I am going ahead keeping this reality in mind. I will carry on. I will continue to give darshan to the devotees coming here to meet me.&quot;

On 1 August 2012, Satnam Singh Mann, a 23-year-old law student from Bihar, charged Amṛtānandamayī at her ashram in Kollam. According to police, he was screaming and reciting words in Arabic. He was overpowered by the crowd, who handed him over to the police. He was later taken to the government mental hospital in Peroorkada, Thiruvananthapuram, where he died three days later.

<doc id="297724" wikidata="Q164359" url="?curid=297724" title="Experience">
<text>Experience refers to conscious events in general, more specifically to perceptions, or to the practical knowledge and familiarity that is produced by these processes. Understood as a conscious event in the widest sense, experience involves a subject to which various items are presented. In this sense, seeing a yellow bird on a branch presents the subject with the objects &quot;bird&quot; and &quot;branch&quot;, the relation between them and the property &quot;yellow&quot;. Unreal items may be included as well, which happens when experiencing hallucinations or dreams. When understood in a more restricted sense, only sensory consciousness counts as experience. In this sense, experience is usually identified with perception and contrasted with other types of conscious events, like thinking or imagining. In a slightly different sense, experience refers not to the conscious events themselves but to the practical knowledge and familiarity they produce. Hence, it is important that direct perceptual contact with the external world is the source of knowledge. So an experienced hiker is someone who has actually lived through many hikes, not someone who merely read many books about hiking. This is associated both with recurrent past acquaintance and the abilities learned through them.

Many scholarly debates on the nature of experience focus on experience as a conscious event, either in the wide or the more restricted sense. One important topic in this field is the question of whether all experiences are intentional, i.e. are directed at objects different from themselves. Another debate focuses on the question of whether there are non-conceptual experiences and, if so, what role they could play in justifying beliefs. Some theorists claim that experiences are &quot;transparent&quot;, meaning that what an experience feels like only depends on the contents presented in this experience. Other theorists reject this claim by pointing out that what matters is not just what is presented but also how it is presented.

A great variety of types of experiences is discussed in the academic literature. Perceptual experiences, for example, represent the external world through stimuli registered and transmitted by the senses. The experience of episodic memory, on the other hand, involves reliving a past event one experienced before. In imaginative experience, objects are presented without aiming to show how things actually are. The experience of thinking involves mental representations and the processing of information, in which ideas or propositions are entertained, judged or connected. Pleasure refers to experience that feels good. It is closely related to emotional experience, which has additionally evaluative, physiological and behavioral components. Moods are similar to emotions, with one key difference being that they lack a specific object found in emotions. Conscious desires involve the experience of wanting something. They play a central role in the experience of agency, in which intentions are formed, courses of action are planned, and decisions are taken and realized. Non-ordinary experience refers to rare experiences that significantly differ from the experience in the ordinary waking state, like religious experiences, out-of-body experiences or near-death experiences.

Experience is discussed in various disciplines. Phenomenology is the science of the structure and contents of experience. It uses different methods, like epoché or eidetic variation. Sensory experience is of special interest to epistemology. An important traditional discussion in this field concerns whether all knowledge is based on sensory experience, as empiricists claim, or not, as rationalists contend. This is closely related to the role of experience in science, in which experience is said to act as a neutral arbiter between competing theories. In metaphysics, experience is involved in the mind–body problem and the hard problem of consciousness, both of which try to explain the relation between matter and experience. In psychology, some theorists hold that all concepts are learned from experience while others argue that some concepts are innate.

== Definition ==
According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, the definition of the term &quot;experience&quot; can be stated as &quot;a direct observation of or participation in events as a basis of knowledge.&quot; The term &quot;experience&quot; is associated with a variety of closely related meanings, which is why various different definitions of it are found in the academic literature. Experience is often understood as a conscious event. This is sometimes restricted to certain types of consciousness, like perception or sensation, through which the subject attains knowledge of the world. But in a wider sense, experience includes other types of conscious events besides perception and sensation. This is the case, for example, for the experience of thinking or the experience of dreaming. In a different sense, &quot;experience&quot; refers not to conscious events themselves but to the knowledge and practical familiarity they bring with them. According to this meaning, a person with job experience or an experienced hiker is someone who has a good practical familiarity in the respective field. In this sense, experience refers not to a conscious process but to the result of this process.

The word &quot;experience&quot; shares a common Latin root with the word &quot;experimentation&quot;.

=== As conscious event ===
Experience is often understood as a conscious event in the widest sense. This includes various types of experiences, such as perception, bodily awareness, memory, imagination, emotion, desire, action and thought. It usually refers to the experience a particular individual has, but it can also take the meaning of the experience had by a group of individuals, for example, of a nation, of a social class or during a particular historical epoch. Phenomenology is the discipline that studies the subjective structures of experience, i.e. what it is like from the first-person perspective to experience different conscious events.

When someone has an experience, they are presented with various items. These items may belong to diverse ontological categories corresponding e.g. to objects, properties, relations or events. Seeing a yellow bird on a branch, for example, presents the subject with the objects &quot;bird&quot; and &quot;branch&quot;, the relation between them and the property &quot;yellow&quot;. These items can include both familiar and unfamiliar items, which means that it is possible to experience something without fully understanding it. When understood in its widest sense, the items present in experience can include unreal items. This is the case, for example, when experiencing illusions, hallucinations or dreams. In this sense, one can have the experience of a yellow bird on a branch even though there is no yellow bird on the branch. Experiences may include only real items, only unreal items, or a mix between the two. Phenomenologists have made various suggestions about what the basic features of experience are. The suggested features include spatial-temporal awareness, the difference in attention between foreground and background, the subject&#x27;s awareness of itself, the sense of agency and purpose, bodily awareness and awareness of other people.

When understood in a more restricted sense, only sensory consciousness counts as experience. In this sense, it is possible to experience something without understanding what it is. This would be the case, for example, if someone experienced a robbery without being aware of what exactly was happening. In this case, the sensations caused by the robbery constitute the experience of the robbery. This characterization excludes more abstract types of consciousness from experience. In this sense, it is sometimes held that experience and thought are two separate aspects of mental life. A similar distinction is sometimes drawn between experience and theory. But these views are not generally accepted. Critics often point out that experience involves various cognitive components that cannot be reduced to sensory consciousness. Another approach is to distinguish between internal and external experience. So while sensory perception belongs to external experience, there may also be other types of experience, like remembering or imagining, which belong to internal experience.

=== As knowledge and practical familiarity ===
In another sense, experience refers not to the conscious events themselves but to the knowledge they produce. For this sense, it is important that the knowledge comes about through direct perceptual contact with the external world. That the knowledge is direct means that it was obtained through immediate observation, i.e. without involving any inference. One may obtain all kinds of knowledge indirectly, for example, by reading books or watching movies about the topic. This type of knowledge does not constitute experience of the topic since the direct contact in question concerns only the books and movies but not the topic itself. The objects of this knowledge are often understood as public objects, which are open to observation by most regular people.

The meaning of the term &quot;experience&quot; in everyday language usually sees the knowledge in question not merely as theoretical know-that or descriptive knowledge. Instead, it includes some form of practical know-how, i.e. familiarity with a certain practical matter. This familiarity rests on recurrent past acquaintance or performances. It often involves having learned something by heart and being able to skillfully practice it rather than having a mere theoretical understanding. But the knowledge and skills obtained directly this way are normally limited to generalized rules-of-thumb. As such, they lack behind the scientific certainty that comes about through a methodological analysis by scientists that condenses the corresponding insights into laws of nature.

== Debates about the nature of experience ==
=== Intentionality ===
Most experiences, especially the ones of the perceptual kind, aim at representing reality. This is usually expressed by stating that they have intentionality or are about their intentional object. If they are successful or veridical, they represent the world as it actually is. But they may also fail, in which case they give a false representation. It is traditionally held that all experience is intentional. This thesis is known as &quot;intentionalism&quot;. In this context, it is often claimed that all mental states, not just experiences, are intentional. But special prominence is usually given to experiences in these debates since they seem to constitute the most fundamental form of intentionality. It is commonly accepted that all experiences have phenomenal features, i.e. that there is something it is like to live through them. Opponents of intentionalism claim that not all experiences have intentional features, i.e. that phenomenal features and intentional features can come apart. Some alleged counterexamples to intentionalism involve pure sensory experiences, like pain, of which it is claimed that they lack representational components. Defenders of intentionalism have often responded by claiming that these states have intentional aspects after all, for example, that pain represents bodily damage. Mystical states of experience constitute another putative counterexample. In this context, it is claimed that it is possible to have experiences of &quot;pure consciousness&quot; in which awareness still exists but lacks any object. But evaluating this claim is difficult since such experiences are seen as extremely rare and therefore difficult to investigate.

=== Conceptuality and myth of the given ===
Another debate concerns the question of whether all experiences have conceptual contents. Concepts are general notions that constitute the fundamental building blocks of thought. Conceptual contents are usually contrasted with sensory contents, like seeing colors or hearing noises. This discussion is especially relevant for perceptual experience, of which some empiricists claim that it is made up only of sense data without any conceptual contents.

The view that such a type of experience exists and plays an important role in epistemological issues has been termed the &quot;myth of the given&quot; by its opponents. The &quot;given&quot; refers to the immediate, uninterpreted sensory contents of such experiences. Underlying this discussion is the distinction between a &quot;bare&quot; or &quot;immediate&quot; experience in contrast to a more developed experience. The idea behind this distinction is that some aspects of experience are directly given to the subject without any interpretation. These basic aspects are then interpreted in various ways, leading to a more reflective and conceptually rich experience showing various new relations between the basic elements. This distinction could explain, for example, how various faulty perceptions, like perceptual illusions, arise: they are due to false interpretations, inferences or constructions by the subject but are not found on the most basic level. In this sense, it is often remarked that experience is a product both of the world and of the subject. The distinction between immediate and interpreted aspects of experience has proven contentious in philosophy, with some critics claiming that there is no immediate given within experience, i.e. that everything is interpreted in some way. One problem with this criticism is that it is difficult to see how any interpretation could get started if there was nothing there to be interpreted to begin with.

Among those who accept that there is some form of immediate experience, there are different theories concerning its nature. Sense datum theorists, for example, hold that immediate experience only consists of basic sensations, like colors, shapes or noises. This immediate given is by itself a chaotic undifferentiated mass that is then ordered through various mental processes, like association, memory and language, into the normal everyday objects we perceive, like trees, cars or spoons. Direct realists, on the other hand, hold that these material everyday objects themselves are the immediate given. Some philosophers have tried to approach these disagreements by formulating general characteristics possessed by the contents of immediate experience or &quot;the given&quot;. It is often held that they are private, sensory, simple and incorrigible. Privacy refers to the idea that the experience belongs to the subject experiencing it and is not directly accessible to other subjects. This access is at best indirect, for example, when the experiencer tells others about their experience. Simplicity means, in this context, that what is given constitutes basic building blocks free from any additional interpretations or inferences. The idea that the given is incorrigible has been important in many traditional disputes in epistemology. It is the idea that we cannot be wrong about certain aspects of our experience. On this view, the subject may be wrong about inferences drawn from the experience about external reality, for example, that there is a green tree outside the window. But it cannot be wrong about certain more fundamental aspects of how things seem to us, for example, that the subject is presented with a green shape. Critics of this view have argued that we may be wrong even about how things seem to us, e.g. that a possibly wrong conceptualization may already happen on the most basic level.

=== Transparency ===
There is disagreement among theorists of experience concerning whether the subjective character of an experience is entirely determined by its contents. This claim has been called the &quot;transparency of experience&quot;. It states that what it is like to undergo an experience only depends on the items presented in it. This would mean that two experiences are exactly alike if they have the same contents. Various philosophers have rejected this thesis, often with the argument that what matters is not just &quot;what&quot; is presented but also &quot;how&quot; it is presented. For example, the property of roundness can be presented visually, when looking at a sphere, or haptically, when touching the sphere. Defenders of the transparency-thesis have pointed out that the difference between the experiences in such examples can be explained on the level of content: one experience presents the property of visual-roundness while the other presents felt-roundness. Other counterexamples include blurry vision, where the blurriness is seen as a flawed representation without presenting the seen object itself as blurry. It has been argued that only the universals present in the experience determine the subjective character of the experience. On this view, two experiences involving different particulars that instantiate exactly the same universals would be subjectively identical.

== Types of experience ==
=== Perception ===
Perceptual experience refers to &quot;an immediate consciousness of the existence of things outside us&quot;. This representation of the external world happens through stimuli registered and transmitted by the senses. Perceptual experience occurs in different modalities corresponding to the different senses, e.g. as visual perception, auditory perception or haptic perception. It is usually held that the objects perceived this way are &quot;ordinary material objects&quot;, like stones, flowers, cats or airplanes that are presented as public objects existing independent of the mind perceiving them. This stands in contrast, for example, to how objects are presented in imaginative experience. Another feature commonly ascribed to perceptual experience is that it seems to put us into &quot;direct touch&quot; with the object it presents. So the perceiver is normally not aware of the cognitive processes starting with the stimulation of the sense organs, continuing in the transmission of this information to the brain and ending in the information processing happening there. While perception is usually a reliable source of information for the practical matters of our everyday affairs, it can also include &quot;false information&quot; in the form of illusion and hallucination. In some cases, the unreliability of a perception is already indicated within the experience itself, for example, when the perceiver fails to identify an object due to blurry vision. But such indications are not found in all misleading experiences, which may appear just as reliable as their accurate counterparts.

This is the source of the so-called &quot;problem of perception&quot;. It consists in the fact that the features ascribed to perception so far seem to be incompatible with each other, making the so-characterized perception impossible: in the case of misleading perceptions, the perceiver may be presented with objects that do not exist, which would be impossible if they were in direct touch with the presented objects. Different solutions to this problem have been suggested. Sense datum theories, for example, hold that we perceive sense data, like patches of color in visual perception, which do exist even in illusions. They thereby deny that ordinary material things are the objects of perception. Disjunctivists, on the other hand, try to solve the problem by denying that veridical perceptions and illusions belong to the same kind of experience. Other approaches include adverbialism and intentionalism. The problem with these different approaches is that neither of them is fully satisfying since each one seems to contradict some kind of introspective evidence concerning the fundamental features of perceptual experience.

=== Episodic memory and imagination ===
The experience of episodic memory consists in a form of reliving a past event one experienced before. This is different from semantic memory, in which one has access to the knowledge of various facts concerning the event in question without any experiential component associated with this knowledge. In episodic memory, on the other hand, the past event is consciously re-experienced. In this sense, it is a form of mental time travel that is not present in non-episodic memory. But this re-experiencing is not an exact copy of the original experience since the experienced event is presented as something in the past seen from one&#x27;s current perspective, which is associated with some kind of feeling of pastness or familiarity not present in the original experience. In this context, it is often held that episodic memory provides two types of information: first-order information about the past event and second-order information about the role of this event in the subject&#x27;s current memory. Episodic memory is different from merely imagining the experience of a past event. An important aspect of this difference is that it is part of the nature of episodic memory to try to represent how the original experience was, even if it sometimes fails to do so. Other suggested differences include the degree of vividness and the causal connection between the original experience and the episodic memory.

Imaginative experience involves a special form of representation in which objects are presented without aiming to show how things actually are. Like memory and unlike perception, the associated mental images are normally not caused by the stimulation of sensory organs. It is often held that both imagination and memory depend on previous perceptual acquaintance with the experienced contents. But unlike memory, more freedom is involved in most forms of imagination since the subject can freely vary, change and recombine various of the experienced contents while memory aims to preserve their original order. Different theorists focus on different elements when trying to conceptualize the nature of imagination. The impoverishment view holds that imagination is distinguished from perception and memory by being less vivid and clear. The will-dependence view, on the other hand, centers on the power of the will to actively shape the contents of imagination whereas the nonexistence view focuses on the impression of unreality or distance from reality belonging to imaginative experience. Despite its freedom and its lack of relation to actuality, imaginative experience can serve certain epistemological functions by representing what is possible or conceivable. This is the case, for example, when imaginatively speculating about an event that has happened or might happen. Imagination can happen in various different forms. One difference concerns whether the imagined scenario is deliberately controlled or arises spontaneously by itself. Another concerns whether the subject imagines itself as experiencing the imagined event from the inside, as being one of the protagonists within this event, or from the outside. Different imaginative experiences tend to have different degrees to which the imagined scenario is just a reconstruction of something experienced previously or a creative rearrangement. Accounts of imaginative experience usually focus on the visual domain, but there are also other, less prominent forms, like auditory imagination or olfactory imagination.

=== Thinking ===
The term &quot;thinking&quot; is used to refer to a wide variety of cognitive experiences. They involve mental representations and the processing of information. This way, ideas or propositions are entertained, judged or connected. It is similar to memory and imagination in that the experience of thinking can arise internally without any stimulation of the sensory organs, in contrast to perception. But thinking is still further removed from sensory contents than memory and imagination since its contents belong to a more abstract level. It is closely related to the phenomenon of speech, with some theorists claiming that all thinking is a form of inner speech expressed in language. But this claim is controversial since there seem to be thoughts that are not linguistically fully articulated. But the more moderate claim is often accepted that thinking is associated with dispositions to perform speech acts. On this view, making a judgment in thought may happen non-linguistically but is associated with a disposition to linguistically affirm the judged proposition. Various theories of the nature of the experience of thinking have been proposed. According to Platonism, it is a spiritual activity in which Platonic forms and their interrelations are discerned and inspected. Conceptualists, on the other hand, hold that thinking involves entertaining concepts. On this view, judgments arise if two or more concepts are connected to each other and can further lead to inferences if these judgments are connected to other judgments.

Various types of thinking are discussed in the academic literature. They are sometimes divided into four categories: concept formation, problem solving, judgment and decision making, and reasoning. In concept formation, the features common to the examples of a certain type are learned. This usually corresponds to understanding the meaning of the word associated with this type. In the case of problem solving, thinking has as its goal to overcome certain obstacles by discovering a solution to a problem. This happens either by following an algorithm, which guarantees success if followed correctly, or by using heuristics, which are more informal methods that tend to bring the thinker closer to a solution. Judgment and decision making involve choosing the best course of action among various alternatives. In reasoning, the thinker starts from a certain set of premises and tries to draw conclusions from them. A simpler categorization divides thinking into only two categories: theoretical contemplation and practical deliberation.

=== Pleasure, emotion and mood ===
Pleasure refers to experience that feels good. It involves the enjoyment of something, like eating a cake or having sex. When understood in the widest sense, this includes not just sensory pleasures but any form of pleasant experience, such as engaging in an intellectually satisfying activity or the joy of playing a game. Pleasure comes in degrees and exists in a dimension that includes negative degrees as well. These negative degrees are usually referred to as pain and suffering and stand in contrast to pleasure as forms of feeling bad. Discussions of this dimension often focus on its positive side but many of the theories and insights apply equally to its negative side. There is disagreement among philosophers and psychologists concerning what the nature of pleasure is. Some understand pleasure as a simple sensation. On this view, a pleasure experience is an experience that has a pleasure-sensation among its contents. This account is rejected by attitude theories, which hold that pleasure consists not in a content but in a certain attitude towards a content. According to this perspective, the pleasure of eating a cake consists not in a taste sensation together with a pleasure sensation, as sensation-theorists claim. Instead, it consists in having a certain attitude, like desire, towards the taste sensation. A third type of theory defines pleasure in terms of its representational properties. On this view, an experience is pleasurable if it presents its objects as being good for the experiencer.

Emotional experiences come in many forms, like fear, anger, excitement, surprise, grief or disgust. They usually include either &quot;pleasurable or unpleasurable aspects&quot;. But they normally involve various other components as well, which are not present in every experience of pleasure or pain. It is often held that they also comprise &quot;evaluative components&quot;, which ascribe a positive or negative value to their object, &quot;physiological components&quot;, which involve bodily changes, and &quot;behavioral components&quot; in the form of a reaction to the presented object. For example, suddenly encountering a grizzly bear while hiking may evoke an emotional experience of fear in the hiker, which is experienced as unpleasant, which represents the bear as dangerous, which leads to an increase in the heart rate and which may provoke a fleeing reaction. These and other types of components are often used to categorize emotions into different types. But there is disagreement concerning which of them is the essential component determining the relevant category. The dominant approaches categorize according to how the emotion feels, how it evaluates its object or what behavior it motivates. 

While the experience of positive emotions is, to some extent, its own justification, and it is by these experiences or the desire for them that individuals tend to be motivated, the experience of negative emotions is sometimes claimed to cause personal growth; and, hence, to be either necessary for, or at least beneficial in, creating more productive and resilient people—though the necessity of resilience in the first place, or of negative experiences &quot;in re&quot; growth, has been questioned by others.

Moods are closely related to emotions, but not identical to them. Like emotions, they can usually be categorized as either positive or negative depending on how it feels to have them. One core difference is that emotional experiences usually have a very specific object, like the fear of a bear. Mood experiences, on the other hand, often either have no object or their object is rather diffuse, like when a person is anxious that &quot;something bad&quot; might happen without being able to clearly articulate the source of their anxiety. Other differences include that emotions tend to be caused by specific events, whereas moods often lack a clearly identifiable cause, and that emotions are usually intensive, whereas moods tend to last longer. Examples of moods include anxiety, depression, euphoria, irritability, melancholy and giddiness.

=== Desire and agency ===
Desires comprise a wide class of mental states. They include unconscious desires, but only their conscious forms are directly relevant to experience. Conscious desires involve the experience of wanting or wishing something. This is often understood in a very wide sense, in which phenomena like love, intention, and thirst are seen as forms of desire. They are usually understood as attitudes toward conceivable states of affairs. They represent their objects as being valuable in some sense and aim to realize them by changing the world correspondingly. This can either happen in a positive or a negative sense. In the positive sense, the object is experienced as good and the aim is to create or maintain it. In the negative sense, the object is experienced as bad and the aim is to destroy it or to hinder it from coming into existence. In intrinsic desires, the object is desired for its own sake, whereas in extrinsic desires, the object is desired because of the positive consequences associated with it. Desires come in different degrees of intensity and their satisfaction is usually experienced as pleasurable.

Agency refers to the capacity to act and the manifestation of this capacity. Its experience involves various different aspects, including the formation of intentions, when planning possible courses of action, the decision between different alternatives, and the effort when trying to realize the intended course of action. It is often held that desires provide the motivational force behind agency. But not all experiences of desire are accompanied by the experience of agency. This is the case, for example, when a desire is fulfilled without the agent trying to do so or when no possible course of action is available to the agent to fulfill the desire.

In a more restricted sense, the term &quot;sense of agency&quot; refers to the impression of being in control and being the owner of one&#x27;s action. It is often held that two components are the central sources of the sense of agency. On the one hand, the agent constantly makes predictions about how their intentions will influence their bodily movement and compares these predictions to the sensory feedback. On this view, a positive match generates a sense of agency while a negative match disrupts the sense of agency. On the other hand, when looking backward, the agent interprets their intention as the cause of the action. In the successful case, the intention precedes the action and the action is consistent with the intention.

=== Non-ordinary experience ===
The terms &quot;non-ordinary experience&quot;, &quot;anomalous experience&quot; or &quot;altered state of consciousness&quot; are used to describe a wide variety of rare experiences that significantly differ from the experience in the ordinary waking state. Examples of non-ordinary experiences are religious experiences, which are closely related to spiritual or mystical experiences, out-of-body experiences, near-death experiences, psychotic episodes, and psychedelic experiences.

Religious experiences are non-ordinary experiences that carry religious significance for the experiencer. They often involve some kind of encounter with a divine person, for example, in the form of seeing God or hearing God&#x27;s command. But they can also involve having an intensive feeling one believes to be caused by God or recognizing the divine in nature or in oneself. Some religious experiences are said to be ineffable, meaning that they are so far away from the ordinary that they cannot be described in words. Out-of-body experiences involve the impression of being detached from one&#x27;s material body and perceiving the external world from this different perspective. In them, it often seems to the person that they are floating above their own body while seeing it from the outside. They can have various different causes, including traumatic brain injuries, psychedelic drugs, or sleep paralysis. They can also take the form of near-death experiences, which are usually provoked by life-threatening situations and include contents such as flying through a tunnel towards a light, talking to deceased relatives, or a life review, in which a person sees their whole life flash before their eyes.

It is uncontroversial that these experiences occur sometimes for some people. In one study, for example, about 10% report having had at least one out-of-body experience in their life. But it is highly controversial how reliable these experiences are at accurately representing aspects of reality not accessible to ordinary experience. This is due to the fact that various wide-reaching claims are made based on non-ordinary experiences. Many of these claims cannot be verified by regular perception and frequently seem to contradict it or each other. Based on religious experience, for example, it has been claimed that a divine creator distinct from nature exists or that the divine exists in nature. Out-of-body experiences and near-death experiences, on the other hand, are often used to argue for a mind–body dualism by holding that the soul can exist without the body and continues to exist after the death of the body. Defenders of such claims often contend that we have no decisive reason to deny the reliability of such experiences, for example, because they are in important ways similar to regular sensory experience or because there is an additional cognitive faculty that provides us access to knowledge beyond the regular senses.

=== Others ===
A great variety of experiences is discussed in the academic literature besides the types mentioned so far. The term &quot;flow&quot;, for example, refers to experiences in which the agent is fully immersed in a certain activity. This type of experience has various characteristic features, including a clear sense of the activity&#x27;s goal, immediate feedback on how one is doing and a good balance between one&#x27;s skills and the difficulty of the task. A diverse group of activities can lead to flow experiences, like art, sports and computer games. Flow is of particular interest to positive psychology because its experience is pleasurable.

Aesthetic experience is a central concept in the psychology of art and experimental aesthetics. It refers to the experience of aesthetic objects, in particular, concerning beauty and art. There is no general agreement on the fundamental features common to all aesthetic experiences. Some accounts focus on features like a fascination with an aesthetic object, a feeling of unity and intensity, whereas others emphasize a certain psychological distance from the aesthetic object in the sense that the aesthetic experience is disconnected from practical concerns.

Transformative experiences are experiences involving a radical transformation that leaves the experiencer a different person from who they were before. Examples of transformative experiences include having a child, fighting in a war, or undergoing a religious conversion. They involve fundamental changes both in one&#x27;s beliefs and in one&#x27;s core preferences. It has been argued that transformative experiences constitute counterexamples to rational choice theory because the person deciding for or against undergoing a transformative experience cannot know what it will be like until afterward. It also may be because it is not clear whether the decision should be grounded in the preferences before or after the transformation.

== In various disciplines ==
=== Phenomenology ===
Phenomenology is the science of the structure and contents of experience. It studies phenomena, i.e. the appearances of things from the first-person perspective. A great variety of experiences is investigated this way, including perception, memory, imagination, thought, desire, emotion and agency. According to traditional phenomenology, one important structure found in all the different types of experience is intentionality, meaning that all experience is &quot;experience of something&quot;. In this sense, experience is always directed at certain objects by means of its representational contents. Experiences are in an important sense different from the objects of experience since experiences are not just presented but one lives through them. Phenomenology is also concerned with the study of the conditions of possibility of phenomena that may shape experience differently for different people. These conditions include embodiment, culture, language and social background.

There are various different forms of phenomenology, which employ different methods. Central to traditional phenomenology associated with Edmund Husserl is the so-called epoché, also referred to as bracketing. In it, the researcher suspends their judgment about the external existence of the experienced objects in order to focus exclusively on the structure of the experience itself, i.e. on how these objects are presented. An important method for studying the contents of experience is called eidetic variation. It aims at discerning their essence by imagining the object in question, varying its features and assessing whether the object can survive this imaginary change. Only features that cannot be changed this way belong to the object&#x27;s essence. Hermeneutic phenomenology, by contrast, gives more importance to our pre-existing familiarity with experience. It tries to comprehend how this pre-understanding brings with it various forms of interpretation that shape experience and may introduce distortions into it. Neurophenomenology, on the other hand, aims at bridging the gap between the first-person perspective of traditional phenomenology and the third-person approach favored by the natural sciences. This happens by looking for connections between subjective experience and objective brain processes, for example, with the help of brain scans.

=== Epistemology ===
Experience, when understood in terms of sensation, is of special interest to epistemology. Knowledge based on this form of experience is termed &quot;empirical knowledge&quot; or &quot;knowledge a posteriori&quot;. Empiricism is the thesis that all knowledge is empirical knowledge, i.e. that there is no knowledge that does not ultimately rest on sensory experience. Traditionally, this view is opposed by rationalists, who accept that sensory experience can ground knowledge but also allow other sources of knowledge. For example, some rationalists claim that humans either have innate or intuitive knowledge of mathematics that does not rest on generalizations based on sensory experiences.

Another problem is to understand how it is possible for sensory experiences to justify beliefs. According to one view, sensory experiences are themselves belief-like in the sense that they involve the affirmation of propositional contents. On this view, seeing white snow involves, among other things, the affirmation of the proposition &quot;snow is white&quot;. Given this assumption, experiences can justify beliefs in the same way as beliefs can justify other beliefs: because their propositional contents stand in the appropriate logical and explanatory relations to each other. But this assumption has many opponents who argue that sensations are non-conceptual and therefore non-propositional. On such a view, the affirmation that snow is white is already something added to the sensory experience, which in itself may not amount to much more than the presentation of a patch of whiteness. One problem for this non-conceptualist approach to perceptual experience is that it faces difficulties in explaining how sensory experiences can justify beliefs, as they apparently do. One way to avoid this problem is to deny this appearance by holding that they do not justify beliefs but only cause beliefs. On the coherence theory of justification, these beliefs may still be justified, not because of the experiences responsible for them, but because of the way they cohere with the rest of the person&#x27;s beliefs.

Because of its relation to justification and knowledge, experience plays a central role for empirical rationality. Whether it is rational for someone to believe a certain claim depends, among other things, on the experiences this person has made. For example, a teacher may be justified in believing that a certain student will pass an exam based on the teacher&#x27;s experience with the student in the classroom. But the same belief would not be justified for a stranger lacking these experiences. Rationality is relative to experience in this sense. This implies that it may be rational for one person to accept a certain claim while another person may rationally reject the same claim.

=== Science ===
Closely related to the role of experience in epistemology is its role in science. It is often argued that observational experience is central to scientific experiments. The evidence obtained in this manner is then used to confirm or disconfirm scientific theories. In this way, experience acts as a neutral arbiter between competing theories. For example, astronomical observations made by Galileo Galilei concerning the orbits of planets were used as evidence in the Copernican Revolution, in which the traditional geocentric model was rejected in favor of the heliocentric model. One problem for this view is that it is essential for scientific evidence to be public and uncontroversial. The reason for this is that different scientists should be able to share the same evidence in order to come to an agreement about which hypothesis is correct. But experience is usually understood as a private mental state, not as a publicly observable phenomenon, thereby putting its role as scientific evidence into question.

=== Metaphysics ===
A central problem in metaphysics is the mind–body problem. It involves the question of how to conceive the relation between body and mind. Understood in its widest sense, it concerns not only experience but any form of mind, including unconscious mental states. But it has been argued that experience has special relevance here since experience is often seen as the paradigmatic form of mind. The idea that there is a &quot;problem&quot; to begin with is often traced back to how different matter and experience seem to be. Physical properties, like size, shape and weight, are public and are ascribed to objects. Experiences, on the other hand, are private and are ascribed to subjects. Another important distinctive feature is that experiences are intentional, i.e. that they are directed at objects different from themselves. But despite these differences, body and mind seem to causally interact with each other, referred to as psycho-physical causation. This concerns both the way how physical events, like a rock falling on someone&#x27;s foot, cause experiences, like a sharp pain, and how experiences, like the intention to make the pain stop, cause physical events, like pulling the foot from under the rock.

Various solutions to the mind–body problem have been presented. Dualism is a traditionally important approach. It states that bodies and minds belong to distinct ontological categories and exist independently of each other. A central problem for dualists is to give a plausible explanation of how their interaction is possible or of why they seem to be interacting. Monists, on the other hand, deny this type of ontological bifurcation. Instead, they argue that, on the most fundamental level, only one type of entity exists. According to materialism, everything is ultimately material. On this view, minds either do not exist or exist as material aspects of bodies. According to idealism, everything is ultimately mental. On this view, material objects only exist in the form of ideas and depend thereby on experience and other mental states. Monists are faced with the problem of explaining how two types of entities that seem to be so different can belong to the same ontological category.

The hard problem of consciousness is a closely related issue. It is concerned with explaining why some physical events, like brain processes, are accompanied by conscious experience, i.e. that undergoing them feels a certain way to the subject. This is especially relevant from the perspective of the natural sciences since it seems to be possible, at least in principle, to explain human behavior and cognition without reference to experience. Such an explanation can happen in relation to the processing of information in the form of electrical signals. In this sense, the hard problem of consciousness points to an explanatory gap between the physical world and conscious experience. There is significant overlap between the solutions proposed to the mind–body problem and the solutions proposed to the hard problem of consciousness.

=== Psychology ===
Another disagreement between empiricists and rationalists besides their epistemological dispute concerns the role of experience in the formation of concepts. Concepts are general notions that constitute the fundamental building blocks of thought. Some empiricists hold that all concepts are learned from experience. This is sometimes explained by claiming that concepts just constitute generalizations, abstractions or copies of the original contents of experience. Logical empiricists, for example, have used this idea in an effort to reduce the content of all empirical propositions to protocol sentences recording nothing but the scientists&#x27; immediate experiences. This idea is convincing for some concepts, like the concept of &quot;red&quot; or of &quot;dog&quot;, which seem to be acquired through experience with their instances. But it is controversial whether this is true for all concepts. Immanuel Kant, for example, defends a rationalist position by holding that experience requires certain concepts so basic that it would not be possible without them. These concepts, the so-called categories, cannot be acquired through experience since they are the &quot;conditions of the possibility of experience&quot;, according to Kant.

<text>Marc Rich (born Marcell David Reich; December 18, 1934 – June 26, 2013) was an international commodities trader, financier, and businessman. He founded the commodities company Glencore, and was later indicted in the United States on federal charges of tax evasion, wire fraud, racketeering, and making oil deals with Iran during the Iran hostage crisis. He fled to Switzerland at the time of the indictment and never returned to the United States. He received a widely criticized presidential pardon from President Bill Clinton, on his last day in office; Rich&#x27;s ex-wife Denise had made large donations to the Democratic Party.

==Early life==
Rich was born in 1934 to a Jewish family in Antwerp, Belgium. In 1941 his parents emigrated with their son to the United States to escape the Nazis. They traveled via Vichy France, Spain, Portugal, and the liner &quot;Serpa Pinto&quot;.

His father opened a jewelry store in Kansas City, Missouri, then moved the family to Queens, New York City in 1950, where he started a company that imported Bengali jute to make burlap bags, and later started a business trading agricultural products and helped found the American Bolivian Bank (Banco Boliviano Americano S.A). Rich attended high school at the Rhodes Preparatory School in Manhattan. He later attended New York University, but dropped out after one semester to work for Philipp Brothers (now known as &quot;Phibro LLC&quot;) in 1954 where he worked with Pincus Green.

== Business career ==
At Philipp Brothers, he eventually became a dealer in metals, learning about the international raw materials markets and commercial trading with poor, third world nations. He helped run the company&#x27;s operations in Cuba, Bolivia, and Spain. In 1974, he and co-worker Pincus Green set up their own company in Switzerland, Marc Rich + Co. AG, which would later become Glencore Xstrata Plc. Nicknamed &quot;the King of Oil&quot; by his business partners, Rich was said to have expanded the spot market for crude oil in the early 1970s, drawing business away from the larger established oil companies that had relied on traditional long-term contracts for future purchases. As Andrew Hill of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; put it, &quot;Rich&#x27;s key insight was that oil – and other raw materials – could be traded with less capital, and fewer assets, than the big oil producers thought, if backed by bank finance. It was this leveraged business model that became the template for modern traders, including Trafigura, Vitol, and Glencore&quot;.

His tutelage under Philipp Brothers afforded Rich the opportunity to develop relationships with various dictatorial régimes and embargoed nations. Rich would later tell biographer Daniel Ammann that he had made his &quot;most important and most profitable&quot; business deals by violating international trade embargoes and doing business with the apartheid regime of South Africa. He also counted Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba, Marxist Angola, the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s Libya, Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s Romania, and Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s Chile among the clients he served. According to Ammann, &quot;he had no regrets whatsoever... He used to say &#x27;I deliver a service. People want to sell oil to me and other people wanted to buy oil from me. I am a businessman, not a politician.&#x27;&quot;

Later, following the overthrow of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, during the Iranian Revolution in 1979, Rich used his special relationship with Ayatollah Khomeini, the leader of the revolution, to buy oil from Iran despite the American embargo. According to Forbes Magazine, Asadollah Asgaroladi was also the secret business partner of Rich in helping bypass U.S. sanctions against Iran after the Iranian revolution. Iran would become Rich&#x27;s most important supplier of crude oil for more than 15 years. Rich sold Iranian oil to Israel through a secret pipeline. Due to his good relationship with Iran and Ayatollah Khomeini, Rich helped give Mossad&#x27;s agents contacts in Iran.

His real estate company, Marc Rich Real Estate GmbH, was involved in large developer projects (e.g., in Prague, Czech Republic). Rich and Marvin Davis bought 20th Century Fox in 1981. Due to the indictment filed against Rich for violating U.S. trade sanctions against his deals with Iran while Rich was living in Switzerland, his assets including his holding in 20th Century Fox were frozen. Davis was permitted by authorities to purchase Rich&#x27;s holding and subsequently sold this to Rupert Murdoch for $232 million during March 1984.

Rich had ties to many mafia associates in the Soviet Union and, subsequently, the former Soviet Union, such as the Georgian-Israeli Grigori Loutchansky who owns the Austrian-based oil exporting company Nordex and who was involved in the Iridium satellite constellation, and especially in the Russian Mafia, such as Marat Balagula, who was convicted of gasoline price fixing.

&quot;Business Insider&quot; reported Rich had an estimated net worth of US$2.5 billion.

==U.S. indictment and pardon==

In 1983, Rich and partner Pincus Green were indicted on 65 criminal counts, including income tax evasion, wire fraud, racketeering, and trading with Iran during the oil embargo (at a time when Iranian revolutionaries were still holding American citizens hostage). The charges would have led to a sentence of more than 300 years in prison had Rich been convicted on all counts. The indictment was filed by then-U.S. Federal Prosecutor (and future mayor of New York City) Rudolph Giuliani. At the time, it was the biggest tax evasion case in U.S. history.

Learning of the plans for the indictment, Rich fled to Switzerland and, always insisting that he was not guilty, never returned to the U.S. to answer the charges. Rich&#x27;s companies eventually pleaded guilty to 35 counts of tax evasion and paid $90 million in fines, although Rich himself remained on the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s Ten Most-Wanted Fugitives List for many years, narrowly evading capture in Britain, Germany, Finland, and Jamaica. Fearing arrest, he did not even return to the United States to attend his daughter&#x27;s funeral in 1996.

On January 20, 2001, hours before leaving office, U.S. President Bill Clinton granted Rich a controversial presidential pardon. Leonard Garment, Richard Nixon&#x27;s acting Special Counsel who had replaced John Dean during Watergate, had both Rich and Rich&#x27;s business partner Pincus Green as a client since spring 1985 with Scooter Libby representing them as their attorney for the pardon until spring 2000 when Jack Quinn became their attorney. Several of Clinton&#x27;s strongest supporters distanced themselves from the decision. Former President Jimmy Carter, a fellow Democrat, said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think there is any doubt that some of the factors in his pardon were attributable to his large gifts. In my opinion, that was disgraceful.&quot; Clinton himself later expressed regret for issuing the pardon, saying that &quot;it wasn&#x27;t worth the damage to my reputation.&quot;

Clinton&#x27;s critics alleged that Rich&#x27;s pardon had been bought, as Denise Rich had given more than $1 million to Clinton&#x27;s political party (the Democratic Party), including more than $100,000 to the Senate campaign of the president&#x27;s wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and $450,000 to the Clinton Library foundation during Clinton&#x27;s time in office.

Clinton also cited clemency pleas he had received from Israeli government officials, including then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Rich had made substantial donations to Israeli charitable foundations over the years, and many senior Israeli officials, such as Shimon Peres and Ehud Olmert, argued on his behalf behind the scenes. Many leading figures of the Jewish world such as Abraham Foxman, the head of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), whose organization had received over $250,000 from Rich over the years also wrote to President Clinton for Rich&#x27;s pardon. Among other leading Jewish leaders writing to Clinton were Shlomo Ben-Ami, Israel&#x27;s former foreign minister; Michael Steinhardt, a philanthropist and CEO of Steinhardt Associates; and Rabbi Irving Greenberg, chairman of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, which oversees the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Although none of the figures other than Foxman were investigated for their support of Rich&#x27;s pardon, Clinton later claimed on more than one occasion that pressure from Jewish communities and the Israeli government contributed to his decision to pardon Rich. He stated in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;Israeli officials of both major political parties and leaders of Jewish communities in America and Europe urged the pardon of Mr. Rich.&quot; He made similar comments off camera to CNBC&#x27;s Geraldo Rivera that &quot;Israel did influence me profoundly&quot;.

Speculation about another rationale for Rich&#x27;s pardon involved his alleged involvement with the Israeli intelligence community. Rich reluctantly acknowledged in interviews with his biographer, Daniel Ammann, that he had assisted the Mossad, Israel&#x27;s intelligence service, a claim that Ammann said was confirmed by a former Israeli intelligence officer. According to Ammann, Rich had helped finance the Mossad&#x27;s operations and had supplied Israel with strategic amounts of Iranian oil through a secret oil pipeline. Avner Azulay, a former high-ranking Mossad agent and executive director of two of Rich&#x27;s philanthropic foundations in Israel since 1993, who played a central role in coordinating the pardon effort, was the one who persuaded Rich&#x27;s ex-wife (divorced in 1996) Denise to personally ask President Clinton to review Rich&#x27;s pardon request. Azulay was also the one who asked Ehud Barak, whom he knew through his prior work at Mossad, to appeal to President Clinton on behalf of Rich for clemency. Barak subsequently raised the issue with Clinton on several occasions. A former Mossad chief, Shabtai Shavit, had also urged Clinton to pardon Rich, who he said had routinely allowed intelligence agents to use his offices around the world.

Federal Prosecutor Mary Jo White was appointed by Attorney General John Ashcroft to investigate Clinton&#x27;s last-minute pardon of Rich. She stepped down before the investigation was finished and was replaced by James Comey, who was critical of Clinton&#x27;s pardons and of then-Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder&#x27;s pardon recommendation. Rich&#x27;s lawyer, Jack Quinn, had previously been Clinton&#x27;s White House Counsel and chief of staff to Clinton&#x27;s vice president, Al Gore, and had had a close relationship with Holder. According to Quinn, Holder had advised that standard procedures be bypassed and the pardon petition be submitted directly to the White House. Congressional investigations were also launched. Clinton&#x27;s top advisors, Chief of Staff John Podesta, White House Counsel Beth Nolan, and advisor Bruce Lindsey, testified that nearly all of the White House staff advising the president on the pardon request had urged Clinton to not grant Rich a pardon. Federal investigators ultimately found no evidence of criminal activity.

As a condition of the pardon, it was made clear that Rich would drop all procedural defenses against any civil actions brought against him by the United States upon his return there. That condition was consistent with the position that his alleged wrongdoing warranted only civil penalties, not criminal punishment. Rich never returned to the United States.

In a February 18, 2001, op-ed essay in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Clinton (by then out of office) explained why he had pardoned Rich, noting that U.S. tax professors Bernard Wolfman of the Harvard Law School and Martin Ginsburg of Georgetown University Law Center had concluded that no crime had been committed, and that Rich&#x27;s companies&#x27; tax-reporting position had been reasonable. In the same essay, Clinton listed Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby as one of three &quot;distinguished Republican lawyers&quot; who supported a pardon for Rich. (Libby himself later received a presidential commutation from President George W. Bush, and later a presidential pardon from President Donald Trump for his involvement in the Plame affair.) During Congressional hearings after Rich&#x27;s pardon, Libby, who had represented Rich from 1985 until the spring of 2000, denied that Rich had violated the tax laws but criticized him for trading with Iran at a time when that country was holding U.S. hostages.

A &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial called the Marc Rich pardon &quot;a shocking abuse of presidential power.&quot;

On November 1, 2016, the FBI released documents related to the pardon, stating it was an FOIA release.

==Paradise Papers==
On November 5, 2017, the Paradise Papers, a set of confidential electronic documents relating to offshore investment, revealed that the Appleby law firm had worked for Rich and Glencore on major projects in the past, even after his indictment in 1983.

==Legacy==
Glencore International AG was a corporate successor to &quot;Marc Rich + Co AG.&quot; At the end of 1993, Rich lost control of the company when a disastrous attempt to corner the world zinc market led to a number of the Rich Boys insisting he give up his majority stake. After a management buyout, Marc Rich + Co was renamed Glencore on 1 September 1994. Ivan Glasenberg was appointed chief executive in 2002. Glencore merged in 2013 with Xstrata (formerly Südelektra Holding AG) to become Glencore Xstrata, headquartered in Baar, Switzerland. Until the 2011 Glencore IPO, and the Glencore/Xstrata merger of 2013, Glencore was run as a private partnership. Following the merger, Glencore&#x27;s website says that the company was founded in 1974 as Marc Rich + Co AG, and also refers to the management buyout from Marc Rich in 1993.

In 2001, the Zug based Crown Resources AG, which is associated with Alfa Group, merged with the Zug-based Marc Rich &amp; Co. Investment AG (MRI), which is the Swiss-based commodities trading arm of the Marc Rich Holding company, to create a commodities trading house.

Trafigura Beheer BV, based in Netherlands, is another corporate successor, though not ever owned or directly managed by Rich. It was created in March 1993, the name acquired from an existing company registered in Amsterdam. Its founding partners, alongside Claude Dauphin, were former Marc Rich top brass. Trafigura AG is now the main office, and is located in Geneva, Switzerland.

==Citizenship==
Although Rich believed that he had relinquished his United States citizenship when he became a citizen of Spain, an appeals court ruled in 1991 that, for purposes of U.S. law, Rich remained a citizen and therefore was still subject to U.S. income taxes. He also held Belgian, Bolivian, Israeli, and Spanish passports.

== Philanthropy ==
Rich was a strong supporter of Israel throughout his life, having donated around $150 million to institutions such as the Israel Museum, Tel Aviv Museum, research centers, theaters, as well as numerous other documented causes over the years.

In 1985, Rich helped with the compensation to the families of the Israeli victims of the Ras Burqa massacre in the Sinai. He has contributed tens of millions of dollars for the absorption of Jewish immigrants from Ethiopia and Russia, he has contributed to Project Discovery, he has founded the museum wing for Israeli and international art in the name of his daughter Gabriela, who had died, he has contributed to the establishment of the new building of the Tel Aviv Cinematheque called &quot;Marc Rich Israeli Cinema Center&quot;, and the establishment of the main library at IDC Herzliya University, which bears his name. Rich was also an advocate for coexistence between Israelis and the Palestinians by establishing health and education programs in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as by fulfilling his commitment to making President&#x27;s Conference contributions each year. Rich has also contributed to the Center for Sloan-Catherine, The Medical Research Center at Yale University, The Rabin Medical Center, and the center of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute.
Rich created the Rich Foundation, one of the largest funds operating in Israel, which is managed by Avner Azulay (who wrote to Clinton for his pardon), which has invested more than $135 million in the last two decades. The fund was established by Avner Azulay, with help from Rich&#x27;s ex-wife Denise and his business partners, Elka Acle and Pincus Green. The fund has contributed over the years for culture, education, and various Israeli health program which honor Humanities and Social Sciences at Tel Aviv University, Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, the Cinematheque in Tel Aviv Cameri theaters, the city of Beersheba, IDC Herzliya, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Beit Berl, Tel Aviv Museum and the Israel Museum. Rich also helped with the construction of the Bioengineering building at Bar Ilan University.

==Awards==
In May 2007, Rich received an honorary doctorate from Bar Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel, in recognition of his contribution to Israel and to the university&#x27;s research programs. He received the same honor from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel, on 18 November 2007. The Chaim Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer in suburban Tel Aviv, Israel, honored Rich with the Sheba Humanitarian Award 2008. Former recipients of this award include actor Michael Douglas, actress Elizabeth Taylor, and former U.S. President Gerald R. Ford.

==Personal life and death==
Rich married Denise Eisenberg, a songwriter and heir to a New England shoe manufacturing fortune, in 1966. They had three children, one of whom, Gabrielle Rich Aouad, died at age 27 of leukemia in 1996. Another daughter, Ilona Rich, is married to Kenny Schachter, and lost her oldest son, Kai, to suicide in 2019. Rich and Denise divorced in 1996; she continued to use the name Denise Rich. Six months later, he married Gisela Rossi, although that marriage also ended in divorce, in 2005.

After spending several years in Zug, Switzerland, Rich moved to Meggen, a city in the Canton of Lucerne, Switzerland, residing in a house called &quot;La villa rose&quot; (the pink villa) on the shores of Swiss Lake Lucerne, where he zealously guarded his privacy. Rich owned property in the ski resort of St. Moritz, Switzerland, and in Marbella, Spain. He was an art collector, and friends said that he lived surrounded by Renoirs, Monets, and Picassos.

Rich died of a stroke on June 26, 2013, at a Lucerne hospital. He was 78 and is survived by two daughters, Ilona Schachter-Rich and Danielle Kilstock-Rich. He was buried in Israel.

<text>Rev. Daniel Ziegler (June 11, 1804 Reading, Pennsylvania – May 23, 1876 York, Pennsylvania) was a minister in Kreutz Creek and York, Pennsylvania, and also an avid entomologist. He was a friend of Dr. Frederick Ernst Melsheimer (1782–1873), who like his father the Rev. Frederick Valentine Melsheimer (1749–1814), was also a keen entomologist. Their collections ended up in Harvard University&#x27;s Museum of Comparative Zoology, and comprised 14,774 specimens from 5,302 different species.

Ziegler studied at the University of Pennsylvania and, later, theology at the German Reformed Seminary in York. He was the minister for 37 years of Kraeutz-Creek Church near York as well as up to eight other churches. With his wife, Eve Eyster, he had 10 children, including son Dr. H. A. Ziegler.

It was during his time as minister at Kraeutz-Creek that he began studying entomology. He often accompanied his father on insect-collecting excursions, using the beat net method of collecting, uncommon in America at the time.

Rev. Ziegler&#x27;s only entomological paper, a description of 36 new species of Coleoptera, was published for the assistance of Dr. Melsheimer, whose home was close to one of Rev. Ziegler&#x27;s churches.

<text>Sir Christopher Hatton (12 December 1540 – 20 November 1591) was an English politician, Lord Chancellor of England and a favourite of Elizabeth I of England. He was one of the judges who found Mary, Queen of Scots guilty of treason.

==Early years==
Sir Christopher was the second son of William Hatton (died 28 August 1546) of Holdenby, Northamptonshire, and his second wife, Alice Saunders, daughter of Lawrence Saunders (died 1544) of Harrington, Northamptonshire. His wife, Alice Brokesby was the daughter of Robert Brokesby (died 28 March 1531) of Shoby, Leicestershire, and of Alice Shirley.

On his father&#x27;s side, the Hatton pedigree is said to be &quot;traced beyond records&quot;. In the reign of Henry VII, Henry Hatton of Quisty Birches in Cheshire married Elizabeth, sole heiress of William Holdenby of Holdenby, Northamptonshire. Their son, John Hatton, settled at Holdenby and had three sons, of whom Christopher Hatton&#x27;s father, William, was the eldest. He is said to have had two brothers, Thomas and William, and a sister Dorothy (died 1569), who married first John Newport (died 1566) of Hunningham, Warwickshire, then William Underhill (died 1570) of Idlicote, Warwickshire, whose son, also William Underhill (died 1597), sold New Place to William Shakespeare.

In 1567, Hatton&#x27;s brother Thomas married John Newport&#x27;s sister, Ursula Newport. However Hatton&#x27;s two brothers appear to have died relatively young and without issue. It was his sister Dorothy&#x27;s son Sir William Newport who eventually became Hatton&#x27;s heir, changing his name to Hatton.

Hatton&#x27;s education is said to have been supervised by his maternal uncle, William Saunders (died c. 1583). Otherwise nothing is known of his life until he entered St Mary Hall, Oxford as a gentleman commoner at the age of 15 or 16. He left Oxford without a degree and enrolled in the Inner Temple on 26 May 1560. It is not known whether he was called to the bar.

==Career==

In 1561 Hatton played the part of Master of the Game at a masque at the Inner Temple, and on a similar occasion attracted the attention of Queen Elizabeth. Handsome and skilled, Hatton&#x27;s dancing quickly won him the Queen&#x27;s favour and the nickname &quot;The Dancing Chancellor&quot;. He came to court, according to Naunton, &quot;by the galliard, for he came thither as a private gentleman of the Inns of Court in a masque, and for his activity and person, which was tall and proportionable, taken into the Queen&#x27;s favour.&quot;

In 1564, he became one of the Queen&#x27;s gentlemen pensioners and a gentleman of the privy chamber, and in July 1572 captain of the yeomen of the guard. On 11 November 1577, he became vice-chamberlain of the royal household and was sworn into the Privy Council. That same month he was knighted. In June 1578, the Queen formally granted him the Bishop of Ely&#x27;s house in Ely Place, Holborn, despite vigorous protests from the Bishop. These appointments, with the valuable grants the Queen showered on him in these early years, prompted rumours that he was her lover, a charge specifically made in 1584 by Mary, Queen of Scots.

There were certainly close personal relations between them. In correspondence the Queen called him her &quot;Lyddes&quot;. He is said to have referred to himself in at least one letter as her &quot;sheep&quot;. Yet Hatton &quot;was probably innocent in the matter.&quot;

Hatton represented Higham Ferrers in Parliament in 1571 and from May 1572 was a member for Northamptonshire. He was active in Parliament in prosecutions of John Stubbs and William Parry. In 1576, he was granted land in Wellingborough by the Queen.

In 1581, he was one of those appointed to arrange a marriage between the Queen and Francois, Duke of Alençon, although he urged the Queen against it.

According to one account, Hatton once assured Mary, Queen of Scots he would fetch her to London if Queen Elizabeth died. Whatever the truth of this, Hatton&#x27;s loyalty to his sovereign seems to have remained unquestioned. On one occasion, in December 1584, he led 400 kneeling members of the House of Commons in a prayer for the Queen&#x27;s safety.

Hatton was a member of the law court that tried Anthony Babington in 1586 and one of the commissioners who found Mary, Queen of Scots, guilty of treason the following year. He vigorously denounced her in Parliament and advised William Davison to forward the warrant for her execution to Fotheringhay.

Hatton sent a ring with a letter to Sir Thomas Smith, to be presented to Queen Elizabeth. It was to be worn at the breast, and Hatton claimed for it &quot;the virtue to expel infectious airs, and is, as it (the letter) telleth me, to be worn between the sweet duggs, the chaste nest of pure constancy.&quot; Sir Robert Cecil reported in August 1591 that the queen, who was at Portsmouth, wore a jewel in the form of bagpipes on her ruff that Hatton had sent her. The device alluded to shepherds and her nickname for him, &quot;her mutton&quot;.

In 1587 Hatton became Lord Chancellor. Though he had no great knowledge of the law, he appears to have acted with sense and judgement. He was said to have been a Roman Catholic in all but name, but treated religious questions in a moderate and tolerant way.

Hatton was chancellor of the University of Oxford. He is reported to have been parsimonious, but he patronized men of letters and Edmund Spenser was among his friends. He wrote the fourth act of a tragedy, &quot;Tancred and Gismund&quot;. His death occasioned several panegyrics in prose and verse.

==Wealth==
Hatton became wealthy through his progressing career and the Queen&#x27;s fondness for him, and in 1583 he embarked on building at Holdenby, Northamptonshire, what was to be the largest privately owned Elizabethan house in England. It had 123 huge glass windows at a time when glass was very expensive – window numbers became a way to show wealth. It had two great courts and was as large as Hampton Court palace. It was three storeys high and had two large state rooms, one for himself and another for the Queen, should she ever stay, which she never did.

Lord Burghley, visiting the house in his old age, was impressed with the grand staircase from the hall to the state rooms and proclaimed the house so faultless he forgot the &quot;infirmity of his legs&quot; whilst he walked around. No expense was spared. Hatton even paid to move a village because it spoiled the view from one of his windows. However, the cost of the house drained his purse, so that Hatton was short of money for the rest of his life. No stranger to the financial strain of building, Burghley wrote to Hatton: &quot;God send us both long to enjoy her, for whom we both meant to exceed our purses in these.&quot;

To maintain his dwindling wealth, Hatton began investing in some voyages of Francis Drake, including Drake&#x27;s acts of piracy in Spanish America. During Drake&#x27;s subsequent circumnavigation of the globe, when he reached the Straits of Magellan, he renamed his ship &quot;The Golden Hind&quot; in honour of Hatton&#x27;s coat of arms, which contained a golden hind, and of all the Spanish gold on board. Hatton made a profit of £2300 from this expedition.

==Death==

Despite his successes Hatton died with large debts, a few years after his Holdenby mansion was completed in 1583. Hatton claimed to refuse to sleep there until Queen Elizabeth I would do so. The remains of the original Holdenby House are a room incorporated into a replacement building in the 1870s; part of the pillared doorway with two arches inscribed with the date 1583 in the gardens; and drawings and plans. He had begun to build his other country house, Kirby Hall, in 1570. It was based on French architectural designs and expanded in Classical style over the decades.

Hatton&#x27;s health declined in 1591. The Queen visited him on 11 November. Nine days later he died at Ely Place and was given a state funeral at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 16 December. A grand monument to him stood at the high altar of Old St Paul&#x27;s, &quot;towering above it – an outrage to the susceptibilities of the devout but an object of marvel to London sightseers – until the Great Fire of 1666 dethroned and destroyed it.&quot; Hatton is listed on a modern monument in the crypt as one of the important graves lost.

Although he seems to have had an illegitimate daughter, Hatton never married, and his large and valuable estates descended to his nephew, Sir William Newport (1560–1597), son of his sister Ursula Hatton, who took the surname Hatton. When the latter died without male issue in 1597, the estates passed to Sir Christopher Hatton&#x27;s first cousin once removed and namesake godson, another Sir Christopher Hatton (died 1619), whose son and successor, Christopher became Baron Hatton of Kirby and his son Christopher became Viscount Hatton. This line still continues with the Finch-Hattons.

==Commemorations==
Hatton Garden, heart of the UK&#x27;s trade in cut diamonds, stands on the site of Hatton&#x27;s London home and grounds. Sir Christopher Hatton Academy was founded in 1983 in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire.

== In popular culture ==
In the 2007 film &quot;,&quot; Sir Christopher Hatton is portrayed by Laurence Fox.

<text>John Stubbs (or Stubbe) (c. 1544 – after 25 September 1589) was an English Puritan, pamphleteer, political commentator and sketch artist during the Elizabethan era, whose right hand was cut off on 3 November 1579 following a conviction for &quot;seditious writing&quot;. He died in France in 1589 while on military service, and was buried in Le Havre.

==Early life==
John Stubbs was born in Buxton, Norfolk, and was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge. After reading law at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, he lived at Thelveton, Norfolk. He was a committed Puritan, and he opposed the negotiations for marriage between Queen Elizabeth I and Francis, Duke of Anjou, a Roman Catholic who was the brother of the King of France. Proving that opposition was present towards Elizabeth 1.

==Publication of &quot;French Marriage&quot; pamphlet==
In 1579 he put his opinions into a pamphlet entitled &quot;The Discovery of a Gaping Gulf whereunto England is like to be swallowed by another French Marriage, if the Lord forbid not the banns, by letting her Majesty see the sin and punishment thereof&quot;. Copies of the text were later publicly burned in the kitchen stove of Stationer&#x27;s Hall. The pamphlet argued that at forty-six years old Elizabeth was too old to have children and therefore had no need for marriage. He argued that English values, customs, language and morality would be undermined by so close a relationship with the French monarchy.

Stubbs argued that his objective was to protect the freedom of thought and free speech that he said was associated with Protestantism. The proposed marriage could lead to a restoration of Catholic orthodoxy with its diminution of liberty.

Stubbs undiplomatically described the proposed wedding as a &quot;contrary coupling,&quot; &quot;an immoral union, an uneven yoking of the clean ox to the unclean ass, a thing forbidden in the law&quot; as laid down by St. Paul, a &quot;more foul and more gross&quot; union that would draw the wrath of God on England and leave the English &quot;pressed down with the heavy loins of a worse people and beaten as with scorpions by a more vile nation.&quot;

==Trial, punishment, and further writing==
Elizabeth&#x27;s court were displeased by the publication. Circulation of this pamphlet was prohibited, and Stubbs, his printer, and publisher William Page were tried at Westminster, found guilty of &quot;seditious writing&quot;, and sentenced to have their right hands cut off by means of a cleaver driven through the wrist by a mallet. Initially Queen Elizabeth had favored the death penalty but was persuaded by adviser John Jovey to opt for the lesser sentence. The printer was subsequently pardoned by Elizabeth, but in the case of Stubbs and his publisher the sentence was carried out, and Stubbs&#x27; right hand was cut off on 3 November 1579. At the time Stubbs protested his loyalty to the Crown, and immediately before the public dismemberment delivered a shocking pun: &quot;Pray for me now my calamity is at hand.&quot; His right hand having been cut off, he removed his hat with his left hand and cried &quot;God Save the Queen!&quot; before fainting.

Stubbs was subsequently imprisoned for eighteen months. On being released in 1581 he continued to write, publishing, among other pamphlets, a reply to Cardinal Allen&#x27;s &quot;Defence of the English Catholics&quot;. Despite his punishment, he remained a loyal subject of Queen Elizabeth and later served in the House of Commons as MP for Great Yarmouth in the English Parliament of 1589.
He died and was buried with military honours on the shore at Le Havre, France, where he seems to have gone to volunteer for military service (despite the disability caused by his punishment) under Henry of Navarre. His will, dated 25 September 1589, was probated on 27 June 1590.

==Marriage and issue==
John Stubbs married Anne de Vere (d. 1617), widow of Christopher Shernborne (d. 7 July 1575), and daughter of Aubrey de Vere, second son of John de Vere, 15th Earl of Oxford. By her marriage to Christopher Shernborne, Anne had a son, Francis Shernborne, esquire, who was the last of the male line to bear the surname. Francis Shernborne married Martha Colt, said to have been the daughter of Sir George Colt of Cavendish, Suffolk, by whom he had a daughter and heir, Mary Colt, who married Sir Augustine Sotherton of Taverham, near Norwich.

Stubbs was brother-in-law of the noted Puritan divine Thomas Cartwright, who married his sister Alice. Anne Stubbs, John&#x27;s wife, was a Brownist.

==Modern research on Stubbs==
Linda Gregerson of the University of Michigan a book, &quot;Commonwealth of the Word: Nation and Reformation in Early Modern England&quot;, that closely examines Stubbs&#x27; life and the contradictions of his loyalty to the Crown in light of his punishment, as well as the role of nationalism, patriotism and religion in shaping his beliefs.

<text>Southern Dobruja or South Dobruja ( or simply , ; or , ), also the Quadrilateral (), is an area of north-eastern Bulgaria comprising Dobrich and Silistra provinces, part of the historical region of Dobruja. It has an area of 7,412 square km and a population of 358,000.

It is historically noteworthy as a point of contention in Bulgarian-Romanian relations. Part of Bulgaria between 1878 and 1913, the region was annexed by Romania in the Treaty of Bucharest (1913), targeted by Bulgaria during World War I (1914–18), and subsequently remained Romanian until 1940, when Bulgaria regained control in the Treaty of Craiova, which went along with a compulsory population exchange. Southern Dobruja has been part of Bulgaria since 1940.

==History==
At the beginning of the modern era, Southern Dobruja had a mixed population of Bulgarians and Turks with several smaller minorities, including Gagauz, Crimean Tatars and Romanians. In 1910, of the 282,007 inhabitants of Southern Dobruja, 134,355 (47.6%) were Bulgarians, 106,568 (37.8%) Turks, 12,192 (4.3%) Roma, 11,718 (4.1%) Tatars, and 6,484 (2.4%) Romanians.

Southern Dobruja was part of the autonomous Bulgarian principality from 1878 and part of the independent Bulgarian state from 1908 until Bulgaria&#x27;s defeat in the Second Balkan War, when the region was ceded to Romania under the Treaty of Bucharest (1913). 

In 1914, Romania demanded all landowners prove their property and surrender to the Romanian state one third of the land they claimed or pay an equivalent of its value. This was similar to the agrarian reforms in Romania which occurred the previous century, in which the landlords had to give up two-thirds of their land, which was then handed over to the peasants. In Southern Dobruja, many of the peasants who received the land were settlers, including tens of thousands of Aromanians from Macedonia, as well as Megleno-Romanians from the same place and Romanians from Wallachia, which led to claims that the reforms had a nationalist purpose.

On 7 September 1940, Southern Dobruja was restored to Bulgaria under the Treaty of Craiova. The treaty was followed by a mandatory population exchange: about 110,000 Romanians (almost 95% of whom settled there after 1913), Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians were forced to leave Southern Dobruja, whereas 77,000 Bulgarians had to leave Northern Dobruja. Only a few hundred Romanians and Aromanians are now left in the region.

==Demographic history==
:1According to the 1926–1938 Romanian administrative division (counties of Durostor and Caliacra), which included a part of today&#x27;s Romania (chiefly the communes of Ostrov and Lipnița, now part of Constanța County) and excluded a part of today&#x27;s Bulgaria (parts of General Toshevo and Krushari municipalities)
:2Including persons counted as Vlachs in Bulgarian Census
:3Only includes persons who answered the optional question on ethnic identity. The total population was 309,151.

==Administrative divisions==

Between 1913 and 1940, during the Romanian rule, the region covered two counties: Durostor and Caliacra. Nowadays, the territory of Southern Dobruja forms the provinces of Silistra and Dobrich.

<doc id="297734" wikidata="Q594056" url="?curid=297734" title="Nationalist Party (Malta)">
<text>The Nationalist Party (, PN) is one of the two major contemporary political parties in Malta, along with the Labour Party.

It is a Christian democratic, and conservative political party, and it has been also described as centrist or centre-right on the political spectrum. It is supportive of Malta&#x27;s membership in the European Union. It is currently in opposition to the Labour Party. Since independence in 1964, the Nationalist Party has won six out of the thirteen general elections, in 1966, 1987, 1992, 1998 and 2003. In 2008 it won with a paper-thin majority of around 1500 votes.

== History ==
===Foundation and early years (1880–1918)===

The Nationalist Party&#x27;s roots lie in the important language question of the late 19th century, when the colonial government in Malta tried to give the English language the importance Italian had held in schools, administration, and law courts. Fortunato Mizzi, who was a lawyer at the time, strongly opposed these reforms, and in 1880, he set up the &quot;Partito Anti-Riformista&quot; (Anti-Reform Party). He and his followers also wanted a better constitution for the island, as the one imposed at the time had been granted by governor Richard More O&#x27;Ferrall in 1849, and gave the Maltese little power. This was because the governor was to appoint more members to the council of government than there were to be elected by the voters.

Against the Anti-Reform Party stood the Reform Party, founded by Sigismondo Savona in 1879. The Reform Party was in favour of the language reforms being imposed.

In 1886, Fortunato Mizzi, together with Gerald Strickland (another anti-reformist at the time), went to London to demand a new constitution for the islands, which would give them representative government. This constitution was granted in 1887 (known as the Knutsford Constitution), and added more elected members to the council of government than official (appointed) members.

During the next few years, the party was divided between abstentionists and anti-abstentionists. The abstentionists would immediately resign their post in the Council of Government immediately upon election as a protest against the token representation of the electorate on the council; the anti-abstentionists favoured co-operation with the colonial authorities in order to work for a better constitution.

This practice of abstentionism led to the 1887 constitution being withdrawn, and in 1903, a new one was given instead, similar to that of 1887.

===Interwar period (1918–39)===
Following the First World War a broader and more moderate coalition, the Maltese Political Union (UPM), was formed but a more radical and pro-Italian group, the Democratic Nationalist Party (PDN), split from the main party. The two groups contested the first legislative elections of 1921 but in separate constituencies so as not to damage each other&#x27;s chances. However, after elections the UPM, which emerged as the largest Party in the Legislative Assembly, chose Labour as its coalition partner.

The parties again contested the 1924 elections separately although this time they did form a coalition, eventually merging in 1926 under the old name of Nationalist Party. It lost its first elections as a re-unified Party in 1927 to the &quot;Compact&quot;, an electoral alliance between the Constitutional Party and Labour.

A constitutional crisis, resulting from a dispute between the Church and the Constitutional Party, meant that elections were suspended in 1930. They were held again in 1932 when the Nationalists emerged victorious (21 seats out of 32). However, the Nationalists did not last long in government. The colonial authorities, concerned at the rise of fascist Italy in the Mediterranean and Africa, suspended the government and the constitution on the pretext that government&#x27;s measures to strengthen instruction of Italian in schools violated the Constitution.

The party openly sided with General Franco&#x27;s Nationalist army in the Spanish Civil War. This is still seen by the historical iconography that stayed on the party, including the proto-Fascist imagery of the party logo is a shield set against a black background (black being the heraldic colour chosen by Mussolini, as evidenced by his &quot;Blackshirts&quot;), the PN&#x27;s official anthem, which is still sung during mass meetings, being similar to the official anthem of Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist party, &quot;La Giovinezza&quot;, and also the name of the party itself, which in itself includes the term &quot;nazionale&quot; for the first time, which was inspired by Italian nationalism.

===The Second World War and postwar period (1939–64)===
The Nationalists received what could have been their coup de grâce during the War. Their association with Italy, the wartime enemy, antagonised them with the electorate, and their leader Enrico Mizzi (son of Fortunato) was first interned and then exiled to Uganda during the War along with other supporters of the Party. The Party did not even contest the 1945 elections for the Council of Government which for the first time raised the Labour Party from third-party status to that of a major party at the expense of the Constitutionals.

Notwithstanding, the Nationalist Party survived and in its first major electoral test, the legislative elections of 1947, it managed to stay ahead of various splinters that had formed from people who did not want to be associated with the main party. In the following 1950 elections, a very damaging split occurred in the ranks of the governing Labour Party resulting in two parties: the Malta Labour Party (MLP) and the Malta Workers&#x27; Party (MWP). This helped the Nationalists become the largest party in the Legislative Assembly and form a minority government which, though short-lived, re-established the Nationalist Party as a major political party. Enrico Mizzi was sworn in as Prime Minister, but died after three months in December.

Two subsequent elections were held in 1951 and 1953 where the Nationalists formed short-lived coalitions with the Malta Workers Party (which, over the years, eventually disintegrated). The Party lost the 1955 elections to Labour and the following years it led the campaign against the Labour Government&#x27;s proposal for integration with Britain. Integration failed largely because Britain lost interest after the Suez fiasco and the constitution was again revoked in 1958 following massive disturbances over redundancies at the Malta Drydocks.

===Post-independence (1964–2013)===
A new constitution was enacted in 1961. The Nationalists, led by George Borg Olivier won the 1962 elections, fought largely over the issue of independence and having as a backdrop a second politico-religious crisis this time between the Church and the Labour Party. Independence was achieved in 1964 and the Party was returned to office in elections in 1966. It lost the 1971 elections by a narrow margin and lost again in 1976.

In the elections of 1981 the party, led by Eddie Fenech Adami achieved an absolute majority of votes for the first time since 1933 but it did not gain a parliamentary majority and so remained in the opposition. A crisis followed with the party MPs refusing to take their seats. Amendments to the constitution in 1987 meant that the party was voted into office that same year after 16 years in opposition.

In 1990 the government formally applied to join the European Community. A wide-ranging programme of liberalisation and public investments meant the return to office with a larger majority in 1992. However, the party was defeated in the 1996 elections. The stint in opposition would last only 22 months as the government soon lost its one-seat majority. The party won the 1998 elections convincingly, a feat that was repeated in 2003 following the conclusions of accession negotiations with the European Union in 2002.

The Nationalist Party proposed Malta&#x27;s accession to the European Union, a question which was put forward in the 2003 Maltese European Union membership referendum. Those in favour were 53% of eligible voters, a result that prompted the 2003 snap election in order to confirm the mandate. Malta joined the European Union in 2004.

The Nationalist Party won narrowly the general election of 2008. It lost the 2013 election and is currently in opposition.

===Opposition period (since 2013)===

After the most recent Nationalist government, led by Lawrence Gonzi, lost its majority in parliament in the final year of the legislature, the same government fell when the budget vote (also a vote of confidence) was defeated, thus meaning it was the first Nationalist government since Independence to fall from power.

After approximately 23 years in government (With Labour&#x27;s short 2-year stint between 1996 and 1998 being in between two stints of PN governance) the Nationalist Party took a major defeat in the Maltese general elections of 2013, losing several districts and resulting in a nine-seat deficit in parliament between it as the opposition and the elected Government. the win is considered to have been the biggest victory any party has had since Malta&#x27;s Independence with the opposing Labour party taking 55% of the votes with a difference of 35,000 votes between the two parties.

The Nationalist Party again suffered a loss in the European Parliament election of 2014 against the governing Labour Party by over 34,000 votes, but managed to elect its third MEP for the first time since Malta&#x27;s entrance in the EU, namely Roberta Metsola, David Casa and Therese Comodini Cachia.

In the 2015 local council elections, the Nationalist Party increased its vote percentage from 41% in 2012 to 45%.

In the lead-up to the 2017 general election the Nationalist Party negotiated for a coalition with two never-elected third parties in Malta, all under the campaign Forza Nazzjonali: the newly formed centre-left Democratic Party (PD) and the green Democratic Alternative (AD). Under an agreement reached with PD leader and former Labour and Nationalist MP Marlene Farrugia, PD candidates contested the 2017 general election under the Nationalist banner with the added notation &quot;tal-orange&quot; (referring to the PD&#x27;s party colour) and any elected PD members would participate in a future Nationalist-led government. Negotiations with the AD were unsuccessful due to the AD wanting all three parties to run candidates under a new name, Qawsalla (&quot;Rainbow&quot;), with unified policy platforms rather than simply as Nationalists with an added notation.

The Party formed a coalition list called Forza Nazzjonali together with the Democratic Party. Nevertheless, this was not successful and the party, under Forza Nazzjonali, was defeated again in the 2017 snap election.

After the election, Simon Busuttil resigned from the position of leader of the party alongside the deputy leaders of his administration. A new election for the leadership role was decided in which for the first time, paid PN supporters can vote as well as the executive. The four candidates in the first round were Adrian Delia, Chris Said, Alex Perici Calascione and Frank Portelli. Alex Perici Calascione and Frank Portelli were the two candidates who did not pass through the first phase. In the second round Adrian Delia emerged as the winner of the leadership election, in which he gained 7,734 votes (52.7% of the vote), to Said&#x27;s 6,932 votes.

In Adrian Delia&#x27;s first European election as party leader in 2019 the party took an even bigger defeat than before, with a 43,000-vote difference separating the two parties. this would lead to the party losing another seat while the Labour party gained another seat.

Former Speaker of the House of Representatives of Malta Louis Galea has suggested that the party rebrand, possibly under the new name People&#x27;s National Party (), in order to avoid association with other contemporary &quot;nationalist&quot; parties in Europe, which tend to be positioned on the far-right.

Roberta Metsola, a member of PN, was elected President of the European Parliament in January 2022 following the unexpected death of David Sassoli.

The Party would soon suffer its own internal crisis when Adrian Delia was voted out from his role as the leader of the party after the newsportal LovinMalta alleged that well informed sources told them that WhatsApp messages were sent between him and the alleged mastermind of Daphne Caruana Galizia&#x27;s murder Yorgen Fenech. This fact would soon be picked up by other MPs from the same party who would use it as a casus beli to vote Delia out of power. This would culminate with Bernard Grech emerging as a challenger to Adrian Delia, who would in turn be election as the new leader of the PN. However, it would soon emerge that the WhatsApp leaks were very much greatly exaggerated by another MP Jason Azzopardi, who after Delia challenged Azzopardi to publish the hundreds of messages that he claimed to have with Fenech, would backtrack on his claim of Delia being in Fenech&#x27;s pockets and signed a joint declaration in which they both reconciled. in addition, LovinMalta would soon be taken to court on libel by Adrian Delia over the article, in which LovinMalta would then issue another article claiming that they did not verify the allegation made by the third party with Delia but verified that the allegation had been made. They also expressed regret that the article may have been misunderstood as an allegation of wrongdoing on the part of Delia. As a result, Delia withdrew the libel case against them.

In the 2022 general election, the party was again rocked by the fact that 4 major PN politicians would not run, in addition one of these politicians Mario Galea would speak up against the part be saying that other politicians close to the PN leadership &#x27;made my life hell&#x27; and “I was made a disposable commodity... People close to the leadership also called out my mental health,” Because of these many revelations regarding internal party politics, the PN suffered its third consecutive defeat in the 2022 general election. in addition, this defeat was the biggest percentage of vote difference between the two parties since the 1951 general election.

== Ideology ==
Malta&#x27;s Nationalist Party emerged from the Anti-Reform Party founded by Fortunato Mizzi in 1883, opposing taxation policies decreed by the British authorities and measures to anglicise the educational and judiciary during the &quot;Language Question&quot; period.

The party supported human rights, so long as they were in line with Roman Catholicism. In 2011 it was noted that its party platform was &quot;far to the right of most other Christian Democratic parties, the Bavarian Christian Social Union in Germany included&quot;. In the following years, the party moved towards more centrist positions and became more progressive. The Nationalist Party opposed the introduction of divorce in Malta in 2011. However, since then, it has changed to a position of support for it and for other liberal ideas.

The Nationalist Party was the first party to have an openly gay MP, Karl Gouder, and Trans Candidate Alex Mangion. The majority of its parliamentary group voted in favour of gay marriage in 2017. The party calls itself a mosaic of people and ideologies. The party recruited a non-binary member, Mark Josef Rapa, for their pro-LGBT group, FOIPN. 

A clause in the party statute dating back to 1991 bans active or former Freemasons from taking active roles, including casting a democratic vote, within the parameters controlled by the party itself.

<doc id="297740" wikidata="Q1234966" url="?curid=297740" title="William Allen (cardinal)">
<text>William Allen (153216 October 1594), also known as Guilielmus Alanus or Gulielmus Alanus, was an English Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. He was an ordained priest, but was never a bishop. His main role was setting up colleges to train English missionary priests with the mission of returning secretly to England to keep Roman Catholicism alive there. Allen assisted in the planning of the Spanish Armada&#x27;s attempted invasion of England in 1588. It failed badly, but if it had succeeded he would probably have been made Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Chancellor. The Douai-Rheims Bible, a complete translation into English from Latin, was printed under Allen&#x27;s orders. His activities were part of the Counter Reformation, but they led to an intense response in England and in Ireland. He advised and recommended Pope Pius V to pronounce Elizabeth I deposed. After the Pope declared her excommunicated and deposed, Elizabeth intensified the persecution of her Roman Catholic religious opponents.

==Early life==
William Allen was born in 1532, at Rossall Hall in Rossall, Lancashire, England. He was the third son of John Allen by his marriage to Jane Lister. In 1547, at the age of fifteen, he entered Oriel College, Oxford, graduated Bachelor of Arts in 1550, and was elected a Fellow of his College. In 1554, he was promoted by seniority to Master of Arts, and two years later, in 1556, was made Principal and Proctor of Saint Mary&#x27;s Hall.

Allen seems also to have been a canon at York Minster in or about 1558, indicating that he had most likely received tonsure, the initial step towards ordination that conferred clerical status. Upon the accession of Elizabeth I, he refused to take the Oath of Supremacy, but was allowed to remain at the University of Oxford until 1561.

His public opposition to the newly Protestantized Church of England forced him to leave the country, and in 1561, after resigning his benefices, he left England to seek refuge at Louvain and its University, where he joined many other academics from Oxford and Cambridge who had refused to take the Oath of Supremacy. There, he continued his theological studies and began to write apologetic, polemic, and controversialist treatises. In the following year, because of ill health, he was advised to return to his native Lancashire. He devoted himself to the re-conversion of his native land to the old faith. In particular, he worked to dissuade the Roman Catholic faithful from attending Anglican worship, an outward compromise of their faith and conscience that many made, to avoid ruin from fines, confiscations, and other disabilities.

During this period as a clandestine missionary in England, Allen formed the conviction that the people were not set against Rome by choice, but by force and by circumstances; and the majority were only too ready, in response to his sermons and ministrations, to return to Roman Catholicism. He was convinced that the Protestant hold over the Kingdom, favoured by the policies of Elizabeth, could only be temporary. When his presence was discovered by the Queen&#x27;s agents, he fled from Lancashire and withdrew to Oxford, where he had many acquaintances.

After writing a treatise in defence of the power of the priest to remit sins, Allen was obliged to move to Norfolk, under the protection of the family of the Duke of Norfolk, but already in 1565 had once again to leave for the Continent. He was never to return. Travelling to the Low Countries, he was ordained as a priest shortly afterwards at Malines in Flanders and began to lecture in theology at the Benedictine College there.

==College at Douai==
William Allen was always convinced that the Protestant wave over the country, due to the action of Elizabeth, could only be temporary and that the whole future depended on there being a supply of trained clergy and controversialists ready to come into the country whenever Catholicism should be restored. In 1567, Allen went to Rome for the first time and conceived his plans for establishing a College where students from England and Wales could live together and finish their theological education. The idea subsequently developed into the establishment of a missionary college, or seminary, to supply England with priests as long as the schism with the See of Rome persisted. With the help of friends, and notably of the Benedictine abbots of the neighbouring monasteries, a beginning was made in a rented house at Douai on Michaelmas Day, 29 September 1568, which marked the inauguration of the English College, Douai.

Allen was to be joined by many English exiles, including Edmund Campion. Douai was thought suitable for Allen&#x27;s new College because of the recent foundation there of the University of Douai by Pope Paul IV, under the patronage of King Philip II of Spain, to whose dominions Douai then belonged, and because the foundation had the active encouragement of Jean Vendeville, a law professor at the university, who had accompanied Allen on his journey back from Rome. On 31 January 1570, through the influence of Vendeville, Allen was given the post of Professor of Sacred Scripture.

Allen&#x27;s College became central to the &quot;English mission&quot; for the re-conversion of England. Amongst the &quot;seminary priests&quot;, as they were called, over 160 former students from Douai are known to have been put to death under the Penal Laws; more were imprisoned. Students celebrated the news of each martyrdom, and, by special dispensation, said a solemn Mass of thanksgiving.

==Rome and Rheims==
The number of students at the new college rose rapidly to one hundred and twenty, and the Pope summoned Allen to Rome to establish a similar college there. In 1575 Allen made a second journey to Rome, where by order of Pope Gregory XIII he assisted in the establishment of the English College at Rome. To that end, the ancient English Hospice in Rome was taken over and converted into a seminary for the sending of missionaries to England, and Jesuits were placed in the College to assist Maurice Clenock DD, Rector of the College.

The Pope appointed Allen to be a Canon in Courtray (now in West Flanders, Belgium, and known as Kortrijk), and he returned to Douai in July 1576, but there he had to face a new difficulty. Besides the plots to assassinate him by agents of the Queen of England, the rebels against the rule of the Spanish Crown, encouraged by Elizabeth and her emissaries, now present in Douai, expelled the students of the University from Douai in March 1578. Allen then re-established the College at Rheims, a city then under the patronage and protection of the House of Guise. The collegians took refuge at the University of Rheims, where they were well received, and continued their work as before, and Allen was soon afterwards elected a canon in the Chapter of Rheims Cathedral. Thomas Stapleton, Richard Bristow, Gregory Martin, and Morgan Phillips were amongst Allen&#x27;s companions.

From the College press came a constant stream of polemic, controversialist, and other Roman Catholic literature, which for obvious reasons could not be printed in England. Allen took a prominent part in this. One of the chief works undertaken in the early years of the College was the preparation under Allen&#x27;s direction of the well-known Douai Bible, a translation from Latin into English. The New Testament was published in 1582 when the College was at Rheims; but the Old Testament, although completed at the same time, was delayed, due to a lack of funds. It was eventually printed and published at Douai, in 1609, two years before the Authorized King James Version prepared on James&#x27;s orders by the Church of England.

==Political activism==
In 1577 Allen began a correspondence with the Jesuit priest Robert Parsons. Allen was again summoned to Rome in 1579 and was charged with suppressing an insurrection within the English College, caused by contrasts between students from Wales and the rest of the students from England. It was during this visit that he was appointed as one of the Commissioners charged with submitting proposals for the revision of the Latin Vulgate Bible. Brought into personal contact with Parsons, Allen was captivated by his personality and charisma, and Parsons became a trusted friend. Under Allen&#x27;s orders, the English College at Rome was placed under the control of the Society of Jesus, as part of a plan to send Jesuit missionaries to England by 1580. Under Allen&#x27;s instructions, the first Jesuits to be sent, Parsons and Edmund Campion, were to work closely in England with other Roman Catholic priests. The mission met with little success, as Campion was put to death only after a year&#x27;s work, and Parsons again had to flee to mainland Europe.

Allen himself saw his work as &quot;scholastical attempts&quot; to end the English schism from Rome. His efforts to secure this were completely unsuccessful, and arguably made matters worse for supporters of the Church of Rome in England, Wales, and Ireland. Pope Pius V, in his papal bull &quot;Regnans in Excelsis&quot; (1570), sentenced Elizabeth to both excommunication and &quot;deposition&quot; from the throne, and, upon the pain of excommunication, &quot;released and forbade&quot; her subjects from their allegiance to the Queen.

Returning to Rheims, Allen allowed himself to be drawn into the political intrigues of Parsons for the furtherance of Philip&#x27;s interests in England and Ireland. Parsons had already resolved to remove Allen from the seminary at Rheims, and to that end, as far back as 6 April 1581, had recommended Allen to Philip II of Spain, with a view to the King&#x27;s securing Allen&#x27;s appointment as a cardinal. On 18 September 1581, Pope Gregory XIII named Allen &quot;Prefect of the English Mission&quot;.

Allen and Parsons went to Rome again in 1585, and there Allen remained for the rest of his life. In 1587, whilst he was the subject of the intrigue by Philip&#x27;s agents, he wrote, helped by Parsons, a book in defence of Sir William Stanley, an English officer who had surrendered the town of Deventer in Overijssel, part of the territory of the modern Kingdom of the Netherlands, to King Philip&#x27;s armies. Allen wrote that all Englishmen were obliged, under the pain of eternal damnation, to follow that example, as Elizabeth was &quot;no lawful queen&quot; in the eyes of God.

Allen helped in the planning of the attempted Spanish invasion of England, and would probably have been made Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Chancellor if it had been successful. Allen was the head of the Roman Catholic Church in England under the Pope, and in this position, just after the death of Mary, Queen of Scots, he wrote to Philip II on 19 March 1587 to encourage him to undertake an invasion of England, stating that the Roman Catholics in England (and in Ireland) were clamouring for the King of Spain to come and punish &quot;this woman, hated by God and man&quot;. He was made a Cardinal by Pope Sixtus V on 7 August 1587.

==Spanish Armada==
William Allen was then once more in Rome, having been summoned by the pope after a dangerous illness two years before. He never left the city of Rome again, but he kept in constant correspondence and communication with his countrymen back in England. It had been due to his influence that the Society of Jesus, to which he was greatly attached, undertook to join in the work of the English mission; and now Allen and Parsons became joint leaders of the &quot;Spanish Party&quot; amongst the Roman Catholics in England and in Ireland.

On the advice and recommendation of King Philip, Allen was created a Cardinal in 1587, and he was prepared to return to England immediately, should the invasion prove successful. However, both Allen and Parsons erred in estimating how much support they would find. The vast majority of the remaining Roman Catholic faithful in the Kingdom of England remained loyal to their own Queen against Spain and King Philip, and to them, the defeat of the Spanish Armada, in 1588, was an event that gave cause to rejoice.

Allen outlived the defeat of the Armada by some six years. To the end of his life, he reportedly remained fully convinced that the people of England and their Sovereign would soon become Roman Catholics once again. Upon his elevation, Allen wrote to the English College at Rheims that he owed his Cardinal&#x27;s hat (also) to Parsons. One of his first acts was to order the publication, under his own name and authority, of two works for the purpose of inciting Roman Catholics in England to rise up against Elizabeth: &quot;The Declaration of the Sentence of Sixtus V&quot;, a broadside, and a book, &quot;An Admonition to the nobility and people of England&quot; (Antwerp, 1588). After the failure of the Armada, Philip, to rid himself of the financial burden of supporting Allen as Cardinal, nominated him to the Archbishopric of Malines. This, however, never received the Pope&#x27;s confirmation.

==Last years==
Pope Gregory XIV granted and bestowed on Allen the title of Prefect of the Vatican Library. In 1589, he assisted in the establishment of the English College at Valladolid in Spain. He took part in four Conclaves of the Church, although his influence diminished after the failure of the Armada. Before his death in Rome, he appeared to have changed his mind about the wisdom of Jesuit politics in Rome and in England. Certainly, his political activities could give grounds and cause for Elizabeth&#x27;s government to regard the English seminaries on the Continent as hotbeds of treason.

Allen continued to reside at the English College, Rome, until his death. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, as a Cardinal he had lived in poverty and died in debt at Rome on 16 October 1594. He was buried in the Chapel of the Holy Trinity adjoining the College.

==Legacy==
William Allen&#x27;s foundations at Douai survive today in two seminaries, one being the Venerable English College, Rome founded in 1579 by Allen and Pope Gregory XIII, which still bears the coat of arms of Allen as the college crest; the other being Allen Hall, Chelsea, in London, successor in spirit to Saint Edmund&#x27;s College, Ware. Until 2011, when it closed, there also existed Saint Cuthbert&#x27;s College, Ushaw, or Ushaw College, near Durham, in the north of England, where the College&#x27;s coat-of-arms, granted by the Earl Marshal, who was also the Duke of Norfolk, incorporated the three hares or coneys from Allen&#x27;s ancestral arms. The English College at Valladolid continues to prepare and educate Englishmen and Welshmen for the priesthood. Cardinal Allen Catholic High School in Fleetwood, Lancashire, near Allen&#x27;s place of birth, is named in his honour. Until it closed about 1980, there was another secondary school named after Allen in Enfield, Middlesex, and a grammar school for boys in West Derby, Liverpool, carried his name until 1983 when it was renamed Cardinal Heenan Catholic High School.

<doc id="297743" wikidata="Q3123151" url="?curid=297743" title="Shrinking generator">
<text>In cryptography, the shrinking generator is a form of pseudorandom number generator intended to be used in a stream cipher. It was published in Crypto 1993 by Don Coppersmith, Hugo Krawczyk and Yishay Mansour.

The shrinking generator uses two linear-feedback shift registers. One, called the sequence, generates output bits, while the other, called the sequence, controls their output. Both and are clocked; if the bit is 1, then the bit is output; if the bit is 0, the bit is discarded, nothing is output, and the registers are clocked again. This has the disadvantage that the generator&#x27;s output rate varies irregularly, and in a way that hints at the state of S; this problem can be overcome by buffering the output. The random sequence generated by LFSR can not guarantee the unpredictability in secure system and various methods have been proposed to improve its randomness 

Despite this simplicity, there are currently no known attacks better than exhaustive search when the feedback polynomials are secret. If the feedback polynomials are known, however, the best known attack requires less than • bits of output.

A variant is the self-shrinking generator.

==An implementation in Python==
This example uses two Galois LFRSs to produce the output pseudorandom bitstream. The Python code can be used to encrypt and decrypt a file or any bytestream.

<doc id="297755" wikidata="Q220797" url="?curid=297755" title="Impermanence">
<text>Impermanence, also known as the philosophical problem of change, is a philosophical concept addressed in a variety of religions and philosophies. In Eastern philosophy it is notable for its role in the Buddhist three marks of existence. It is also an important element of Hinduism. In Western philosophy it is most famously known through its first appearance in Greek philosophy in the writings of Heraclitus and in his doctrine of &quot;panta rhei&quot; (everything flows). In Western philosophy the concept is also referred to as &quot;&quot;becoming&quot;.

==Indian religions==
The Pali word for impermanence, &quot;anicca&quot;, is a compound word consisting of &quot;a&quot; meaning non-, and &quot;nicca&quot; meaning &quot;constant, continuous, permanent&quot;. While &#x27;nicca&#x27; is the concept of continuity and permanence, &#x27;anicca&#x27; refers to its exact opposite; the absence of permanence and continuity. The term is synonymous with the Sanskrit term &quot;anitya&quot; (a + nitya). The concept of impermanence is prominent in Buddhism, and it is also found in various schools of Hinduism and Jainism. The term also appears in the Rigveda.

===Buddhism===
Impermanence, called anicca (Pāli) or anitya (Sanskrit), appears extensively in the Pali Canon as one of the essential doctrines of Buddhism. The doctrine asserts that all of conditioned existence, without exception, is &quot;transient, evanescent, inconstant&quot;. All temporal things, whether material or mental, are compounded objects in a continuous change of condition, subject to decline and destruction. All physical and mental events are not metaphysically real. They are not constant or permanent; they come into being and dissolve.

===Hinduism===
The term anitya (अनित्य), in the sense of impermanence of objects and life, appears in verse 1.2.10 of the &quot;Katha Upanishad&quot;, one of the Principal Upanishads of Hinduism. It asserts that material world is impermanent, but impermanent nature of things is an opportunity to obtain what is permanent (&quot;nitya&quot;) as the Hindu scripture presents its doctrine about Atman (Self). The term Anitya also appears in the Bhagavad Gita in a similar context.

In Chapter 2 of the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna elucidates a profound spiritual truth to Arjuna, emphasizing the distinction between the eternal nature of the atman (soul) and the transient, perishable nature of the material world. Krishna conveys that while the body is subject to decay and death, the soul remains undying and unchanging. This teaching serves as a foundational philosophy in Hinduism, encouraging detachment from material concerns and an understanding of the true, eternal self. This insight is pivotal for Arjuna, as it reorients his perspective from the battlefield&#x27;s immediate concerns to the broader, spiritual dimensions of existence, urging him to perform his duty without attachment to the outcomes.

Buddhism and Hinduism share the doctrine of &quot;Anicca&quot; or &quot;Anitya&quot;, that is &quot;nothing lasts, everything is in constant state of change&quot;; however, they disagree on the &quot;Anatta&quot; doctrine, that is whether Self exists or not. Even in the details of their respective impermanence theories, state Frank Hoffman and Deegalle Mahinda, Buddhist and Hindu traditions differ. Change associated with &quot;Anicca&quot; and associated attachments produces sorrow or &quot;Dukkha&quot; asserts Buddhism and therefore need to be discarded for liberation (&quot;nibbana&quot;), while Hinduism asserts that not all change and attachments lead to &quot;Dukkha&quot; and some change – mental or physical or self-knowledge – leads to happiness and therefore need to be sought for liberation (&quot;moksha&quot;). The &quot;Nicca&quot; (permanent) in Buddhism is anatta (non-soul), the &quot;Nitya&quot; in Hinduism is atman (Self).

==Western philosophy==
Impermanence first appears in Greek philosophy in the writings of Heraclitus and his doctrine of &quot;panta rhei&quot; (everything flows). Heraclitus was famous for his insistence on ever-present change as being the fundamental essence of the universe, as stated in the famous saying, &quot;No man ever steps in the same river twice&quot;. This is commonly considered to be a key contribution in the development of the philosophical concept of becoming, as contrasted with &quot;being&quot;, and has sometimes been seen in a dialectical relationship with Parmenides&#x27; statement that &quot;whatever is, is, and what is not cannot be&quot;, the latter being understood as a key contribution in the development of the philosophical concept of being. For this reason, Parmenides and Heraclitus are commonly considered to be two of the founders of ontology. Scholars have generally believed that either Parmenides was responding to Heraclitus, or Heraclitus to Parmenides, though opinion on who was responding to whom has varied over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries. Heraclitus&#x27; position was complemented by his stark commitment to a unity of opposites in the world, stating that &quot;the path up and down are one and the same&quot;. Through these doctrines Heraclitus characterized all existing entities by pairs of contrary properties, whereby no entity may ever occupy a single state at a single time. This, along with his cryptic utterance that &quot;all entities come to be in accordance with this &quot;Logos&quot;&quot; (literally, &quot;word&quot;, &quot;reason&quot;, or &quot;account&quot;) has been the subject of numerous interpretations.

Impermanence was widely but not universally accepted among subsequent Greek philosophers. Democritus&#x27; theory of atoms entailed that assemblages of atoms were impermanent. Pyrrho declared that everything was &quot;astathmēta&quot; (unstable), and &quot;anepikrita&quot; (unfixed). Plutarch commented on impermanence saying &quot;And if the nature which is measured is subject to the same conditions as the time which measures it, this nature itself has no permanence, nor &quot;being,&quot; but is becoming and perishing according to its relation to time. The Stoic philosopher, Marcus Aurelius&#x27; &quot;Meditations&quot; contains many comments about impermanence, such as “Bear in mind that everything that exists is already fraying at the edges, and in transition, subject to fragmentation and to rot.” (10.18)

Plato rejected impermanence, arguing against Heraclitus:How can that be a real thing which is never in the same state? ... for at the moment that the observer approaches, then they become other ... so that you cannot get any further in knowing their nature or state ... but if that which knows and that which is known exist ever ... then I do not think they can resemble a process or flux ...

Several famous Roman Latin sayings are about impermanence, including &quot;Omnia mutantur&quot;, &quot;Sic transit gloria mundi&quot;, and &quot;Tempora mutantur&quot;.

==In arts and culture==
* Akio Jissoji&#x27;s Buddhist auteur film &quot;Mujo&quot; (also known as &quot;This Transient Life&quot;) owes its title to the doctrine of Impermanence.
* &quot;Impermanence&quot; is the title of a novella written by Daniel Frisano.
* &quot;Impermanence&quot; is the title of the 7th track on &quot;For Those That Wish to Exist&quot; by Architects.

<text>The River Effra is a former stream or small river in south London, England, now culverted for most of its course. Once a tributary of the River Thames, flows from the Effra were incorporated in the Victorian era into a combined sewer draining much of the historic area of Peckham and Brixton.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the name &quot;Effra&quot; has been much disputed. There is no evidence that it was applied to the stream before the late 18th century, and early 19th century gazetteers gave it no name. A map of 1744 refers to it as the &quot;Shore&quot;, and it was also referred to as &quot;Brixton Creek&quot; and &quot;the Wash&quot;. Unlikely suggestions for the name&#x27;s origin include Ruskin&#x27;s, that it was &quot;shortened from [the Latin word] Effrena&quot;, that it was from a Celtic root &quot;yfrid&quot;, or that it derived from Anglo-Saxon &quot;efer&quot;, &quot;bank&quot;, perhaps via &quot;heah efre&quot; (&quot;high bank&quot;) recorded in a charter of 693 for a spot on the bank of the Thames.

A more recent suggestion is that the name is a corruption of the place-name &quot;Heathrow&quot;, the name of a manor which once covered some 70 acres south of present day Coldharbour Lane and east of present day Effra Road. By the 1790s the land making up the Manor of Heathrow was known as Effra Farm. There is evidence that the name was first applied to the stream at Brixton, perhaps taken from the name of the farm, and was only later extended to the rest of its course. A 2016 book by the Lambeth borough archivist supports this view, suggesting that other etymologies are a product of 19th century antiquarianism.

==History==
===Before the 19th century===

The drainage basin of the stream covered around 20 square kilometres (8 sq miles) of present-day inner south London. Historically the Effra was fed partly by a line of springs that emerged at between 80 and 100 metres above sea level along the 5 km ridge of the Great North Wood, where a layer of gravels overlies the impermeable London Clay. There were also springs at a lower level in Dulwich; the various tributaries met near Brixton before flowing to the Thames.

The lowest part of the river was diverted as early as the 13th century, after the monks of Bermondsey Priory made an agreement with neighbouring landowners to end flooding problems. Before that time the river&#x27;s course ran either into Walworth Marsh, which after draining became Walworth Common, or into the Earl&#x27;s Sluice to reach the Thames. The lower, northern part of the river appeared in Ogilby&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot; of 1675 as the &quot;New River&quot;.

The upper, southern parts of the river became increasingly suburbanised as the 19th century went on. The art critic John Ruskin, who grew up at Herne Hill close to one of the Effra&#x27;s tributaries, described &quot;the good I got out of the tadpole-haunted ditch in Croxted Lane&quot;, and made an early sketch of a bridge over it.

Until about 1850 Brixton Road, where it ran along the course of the stream, was known as the &quot;Washway&quot;, and the stream itself was often called the &quot;Wash&quot;. By that time the Effra was heavily polluted with domestic waste, due to increasing development along its course, and by 1821 it was classed as an open sewer downstream of North Brixton. It still often flooded in heavy rain, and residents of Brixton Road and South Lambeth repeatedly complained of their houses being inundated. In 1847 the commissioners of the Surrey and East Kent Sewers, under the direction of surveyor Joseph Gwilt, carried out works &quot;arching over&quot; (culverting) the Effra as far upstream as Herne Hill.

===Post-industrial revolution===
When the London sewerage system was constructed during the mid-19th century, its designer Sir Joseph Bazalgette incorporated flows from the River Effra into the southern division of the system. The Effra Branch Sewer, about 3 miles in length and costing some £19,400 to construct, received much of the Effra&#x27;s surface water and ran from the Norwood area into the Southern High Level Sewer at Croxted Lane. The Southern High Level itself ran from Herne Hill eastwards under Peckham and New Cross to Deptford. Here it joined the Southern Low Level Sewer, which picked up remaining effluent from the old course at Vauxhall and passed under Kennington and Burgess Park to Deptford; the two branches merging to form the Southern Outfall Sewer that runs underneath Greenwich and Woolwich to Crossness.

As the area was increasingly urbanised, the remaining parts of the Effra&#x27;s upper course were incorporated into the surface water drainage system, although some parts remained open and marked on Ordnance Survey maps until the later 19th century. The main course of the Effra remained as a sewer and culverts beneath Brixton Road, south London, and seen through a drainage grate in the crypts under St. Luke&#x27;s Church, West Norwood, south London.

==Course==

The river was fed by several tributaries which met above Brixton. The main branch of the Effra rises near Harold Road in Upper Norwood Recreation Ground, and flows through West Norwood. Where Norwood High Street merges at the fountain with the A215 to form Norwood Road, it was joined by a small tributary from Knights Hill ward.

A second branch rose south of Gipsy Hill and ran into West Dulwich via Croxted Road, after flowing from near the Westow House inn, Westow Hill. Beyond the Paxton pub opposite the end of Gipsy Hill its culvert captures water from Hamilton Road, forms the back garden line of Croxted Road and joins the other tributary at the South Circular Road, where it now forms the sewers of Croxted Road, Dulwich Road, Dalberg Road, Effra Road, Electric Lane, and Brixton Road. 
East along the watershed, springs rose in Dulwich Wood, flowing through Belair Park and beneath North Dulwich to Herne Hill. Still further to the east a tributary called the Ambrook rose from springs in Sydenham Hill Wood and Peckarmans Wood, flowing to Herne Hill through present-day Dulwich Park, where its heavily landscaped channel is visible. The longest and easternmost tributary ran from Eliot Bank and Horniman Park in Forest Hill down to Herne Hill.
Rocque&#x27;s map of 1746 called these confluences around Herne Hill railway station &quot;Island Green&quot;. Most of these tributaries are no longer visible above ground: an exception is the Ambrook, which still flows seasonally in Sydenham Hill Wood.

The Effra flowed generally NNW until it reached its lower course, north of Brixton. At this point it turned northeast and then east, running through the grounds of Bermondsey Priory. It fed Lambeth and possibly Walworth Marshes, and may have joined the Earl&#x27;s Sluice, which entered the Thames at Deptford Wharf. After diversion in the 13th century, it ran directly west from Kennington to join the Thames at Vauxhall.

==Folklore==

A local story tells of a coffin found floating down the Thames in Victorian times, which was traced back to West Norwood Cemetery. Cemetery staff were puzzled to find that the plot the coffin had come from was undisturbed. Further investigation revealed that the ground beneath the grave had subsided, and the entire coffin had fallen into the underground Effra river, floating downstream to Vauxhall and entering the Thames. The song “Down in the Effra” by British folk band &quot;The Effras&quot; was written about this account.

==Flooding==

Although little more than a stream in the south, until 1935 the culverted watercourse flooded during heavy rains every decade or so; an inscription on a white stone tablet high up the side of a building in Elder Road, West Norwood reads: &quot;FLOOD LEVEL 17th July 1890&quot;.

After a three-hour-long storm on Sunday 14 June 1914 the sewer overflowed again and flooded houses along its path from Elder Road to Chestnut Road, and locals were forced to evacuate their homes for several days. Further floods in the 1920s prompted works to enlarge the sewer. This was sufficient until a small part of the local area was flooded again during a powerful downpour on 20 July 2007.

==The Unearthing the Effra Campaign==
In 1992 a project by the London arts group Platform sparked a local campaign to dig up the river. The Unearthing the Effra project was based around a mock Effra Redevelopment Agency, which included a public office. The project gained publicity in local newspapers and radio stations before the journalists noticed that the group had scattered, the whole thing being a stunt carried out in the name of art.

<text>Pigeons have featured in numerous experiments in comparative psychology, including experiments concerned with animal cognition, and as a result there is considerable knowledge of pigeon intelligence.

Available data show, for example, that:

*Pigeons have the capacity to share attention between different dimensions of a stimulus, but (like humans and other animals) their performance with multiple dimensions is worse than with a single stimulus dimension.
*Pigeons can be taught relatively complex actions and response sequences, and can learn to make responses in different sequences.
*Pigeons readily learn to respond in the presence of one simple stimulus and withhold responding in the presence of a different stimulus, or to make different responses in the presence of different stimuli.
*Pigeons can discriminate between other individual pigeons, and can use the behaviour of another individual as a cue to tell them what response to make.
*Pigeons readily learn to make discriminative responses to different categories of stimuli, defined either by arbitrary rules (e.g. green triangles) or by human concepts (e.g. pictures of human beings).
*Pigeons do less well with categories defined by abstract logical relationships, e.g. &quot;symmetrical&quot; or &quot;same&quot;, though some experimenters have successfully trained pigeons to discriminate such categories.
*Pigeons seem to require more information than humans for constructing a three-dimensional image from a plane representation.
*Pigeons seem to have difficulty in dealing with problems involving classes of classes. Thus they do not do very well with the isolation of a relationship among variables, as against a representation of a set of exemplars.
*Pigeons can remember large numbers of individual images for a long time, e.g. hundreds of images for periods of several years.

All these are capacities that are likely to be found in most mammal and bird species. In addition pigeons have unusual, perhaps unique, abilities to learn routes back to their home from long distances. This homing behaviour is different from that of birds that learn migration routes, which usually occurs over a fixed route at fixed times of the year, whereas homing is more flexible; however similar mechanisms may be involved.

Pigeons showed mirror-related behaviours during the mirror test.

==Discrimination abilities of pigeons==
In an article from 1995, Watanabe, Sakamoto, and Wakita described an experiment which showed that pigeons can be trained to discriminate between paintings by Picasso and by Monet. The birds were first trained on a limited set of paintings. The experiment has shown that a pigeon was able to obtain food by repeated pecking when shown a painting from Picasso; when it was a Monet, pecking had no effect. After a while, the pigeons would only peck when shown Picasso paintings. They were then able to generalize and correctly discriminate between paintings of the two painters not previously shown, and even between cubist and impressionist paintings (cubism and impressionism being the two stylistic schools Picasso and Monet belong to). When the Monet paintings were shown upside down, the pigeons were not able to properly categorize anymore. Showing the cubist works upside down did not have such an effect.

In 1995, the authors won the Ig Nobel Prize in psychology for this work.

In a later paper, Watanabe showed that if pigeons and human college students undergo the same training, their performance in distinguishing between Van Gogh and Chagall paintings is comparable.

Similar experiments had previously shown that pigeons could be trained to distinguish between photographs of human beings and photographs of other objects, such as trees.

In all these cases, discrimination is quite easy for humans, even though the classes are so complex that no simple distinguishing algorithm or rule can be specified. It has therefore been argued that pigeons are able to form &quot;concepts&quot; or &quot;categories&quot; similar to humans, but that interpretation is controversial. Nevertheless, the experiments remain important and often cited examples in cognitive science.

Levenson et al. demonstrated in a 2015 paper that rock dove pigeons (&quot;Columba livia&quot;), which share many visual system properties with humans, can serve as promising surrogate observers of medical images, a capability not previously documented. The birds were tested on their ability to distinguish benign from malignant human breast histopathology images and could even apply what they had learned to previously unseen images. However, when faced with a more challenging task, they reverted to image memorisation and thus showed little generalisation to novel examples.

<text>Richard Julius Herrnstein (May 20, 1930 – September 13, 1994) was an American psychologist at Harvard University. He was an active researcher in animal learning in the Skinnerian tradition. Herrnstein was the Edgar Pierce Professor of Psychology until his death, and previously chaired the Harvard Department of Psychology for five years. With political scientist Charles Murray, he co-wrote &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;, a controversial 1994 book on human intelligence. He was one of the founders of the Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior.

==Early life and education==
Richard Herrnstein was born on May 20, 1930, in New York City, to a family of Hungarian Jewish immigrants; the son of Flora Irene (née Friedman) and Rezso Herrnstein, a housepainter. He was educated at the High School of Music &amp; Art and the City College of New York, receiving a B.A. from the latter in 1952. In 1955, Herrnstein obtained his Ph.D. at Harvard University, with a thesis titled &quot;Behavioral Consequences of the Removal of a Discriminative Stimulus Associated with Variable-Interval Reinforcement&quot;. Before joining the Harvard faculty, he worked for three years in the United States Army.

==Research and work==
His major research finding as an experimental psychologist is the matching law, the tendency of animals to allocate their choices in direct proportion to the rewards they provide. To illustrate the phenomenon, if there are two sources of reward, one of which is twice as rich as the other, Herrnstein found that animals often chose at twice the frequency the alternative that was seemingly twice as valuable. That is known as matching, both in quantitative analysis of behavior and mathematical psychology. He also developed melioration theory with William Vaughan Jr.

Herrnstein was considered a &quot;star pupil&quot; of B. F. Skinner while working for his PhD at Harvard. He worked with Skinner in the Harvard pigeon lab that he ran until his death. His research greatly contributed to the field of behavior analysis. In 1965, and with Edwin Boring, Herrnstein wrote &quot;A Source Book in the History of Psychology&quot;.

Herrnstein was the Edgar Pierce Professor of Psychology at Harvard University. He was the chairman of the Harvard Department of Psychology from 1967 to 1971. He also acted as the editor of the &quot;Psychological Bulletin&quot; from 1975 to 1981. In 1977, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Herrnstein&#x27;s research focused first on natural concepts and human intelligence in the 1970s, and became prominent with the publication of his and Charles Murray&#x27;s controversial book, &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;.

== Matching law ==

Perhaps his most notable accomplishment was the formulation of the matching law: choices are distributed according to rates of reinforcement for making the choices. An instance for two choices can be stated mathematically as

:formula_1,

where &quot;R&quot;1 and &quot;R&quot;2 are rates of response for two alternative responses, and &quot;r&quot;1 and &quot;r&quot;2 are rates of reinforcement for the same two responses. Behavior conforming to this law is matching, and explanations of matching and of departures from matching are a large and important part of the literature on behavioral choice.

==Personal life==
Herrnstein married his first wife, Barbara Brodo, in May 1951. The couple had a daughter together, Julia, before their divorce in February 1961. Through his second marriage to Susan Chalk Gouinlock, in November 1961, he fathered two sons named Max and James. Herrnstein died of lung cancer shortly before the book &quot;Bell Curve&quot; was released.

<text>Christopher Hatton, 1st Baron Hatton KB PC FRS (28 June 1605 – 4 July 1670) was first cousin twice removed to the Elizabethan politician, Sir Christopher Hatton and a prominent Royalist during the reign of King Charles I of England.

==Life==
He was the son of Sir Christopher Hatton of Barking, Essex and Alice Fanshawe, daughter of Thomas Fanshawe; and was educated at Jesus College, Cambridge. He trained for the law at Gray&#x27;s Inn. He was a noted antiquarian and compiled, together with William Dugdale and others, the &quot;Book of Seals&quot;, a volume of 529 medieval charters, of which 240 are reproduced in facsimiles drawn by a highly talented draftsman. The volume was published in 1950, edited by Lewis C. Loyd and Doris Mary Stenton.

Hatton entered Parliament as MP for Peterborough in 1625, though legally too young to sit, and Clitheroe in that of 1626. On reaching the age of 21 in 1626, he was created a Knight of the Bath, as had been his father before him. He was elected a member of the Long Parliament in 1640 for both Higham Ferrers and Castle Rising, choosing to sit for the former where he was High Steward; he was one of the few candidates supported by Queen Henrietta Maria to secure election.

During the Civil War, Hatton was a partisan of Charles I. In 1643 he was created Baron Hatton of Kirby; and, acting as comptroller of the royal household, he represented the king during the negotiations at Uxbridge in 1645. Later he lived for some years in France, and after the Restoration was made a privy counsellor and governor of Guernsey. 

From about 1648, he employed George Jeffreys as his steward caring for Kirby, Northamptonshire. Many of Jeffreys&#x27;s letters are preserved in the Hatton-Finch correspondence; they cover a period of nearly forty years.

In 1663 he became a founding Fellow of the Royal Society.

He died at Kirby, Northamptonshire on 4 July 1670, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

==Family==
He married at Hackney, Middlesex, on 8 May 1630, Elizabeth (died 1672), eldest daughter and coheiress of Sir Charles Montagu, of Boughton, Northamptonshire. She died when lightning struck a powder magazine at Castle Cornet, Guernsey. 
They had two sons: Christopher Hatton, 1st Viscount Hatton and Charles Hatton, who married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Scroggs as her second husband – and three daughters.

<text>Christopher Hatton, 1st Viscount Hatton (1632–1706) was an English aristocrat and diplomat.

==Career==
He succeeded his father, Christopher Hatton, 1st Baron Hatton, as 2nd Baron Hatton and also as governor of Guernsey in 1670.

He and his family were living in the governor&#x27;s official residence, Castle Cornet, in 1672 when its keep and some living quarters were destroyed by an explosion; his mother and wife were killed. Hatton and his three young daughters were rescued by black servant James Chappell.

He continue to employ his father&#x27;s steward and composer George Jeffreys to care for his family&#x27;s Kirby Hall estate. Many of Jeffreys&#x27;s letters are preserved in the Hatton-Finch correspondence; they cover a period of nearly forty years.

In 1682, he was created Viscount Hatton, of Gretton, Northamptonshire.

==Family==
Christopher&#x27;s younger brother was the botanist Charles Hatton.

He first married on 12 February 1667 to Cecily (d. 1672), daughter of John Tufton, 2nd Earl of Thanet and Lady Margaret Sackville, daughter and heiress of 3rd Earl of Dorset and Lady Anne Clifford. They had the following issue:

* Anne Hatton (d. 1743), m. in 1685 to Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham, later 7th Earl of Winchilsea. Had many issues include Edward Finch-Hatton.
In 1676 he married secondly Frances (d. 1684), daughter of Sir Henry Yelverton, 2nd Baronet. They had several children, but only one daughter survived infancy.

In 1684 he had William Mason create monuments to his two wives and deceased children at Gretton. In 1706 he was buried in the same church.

In August 1685 he married as his third wife Elizabeth (d. 1733), the daughter and heiress of Sir William Haslewood of Maidwell, Northamptonshire. Elizabeth was a first cousin of Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea (wife of Heneage Finch, 5th Earl of Winchilsea). They had several children, including two sons:

* William, 2nd Viscount Hatton (1690–1760)
* Henry Charles, 3rd Viscount Hatton (c. 1700–1762)

Elizabeth died in Kensington on 15th January 1733.

==Succession==
Both his sons inherited the title Viscount Hatton in turn: William on his father&#x27;s death in 1706, and Henry Charles for two years (1760–1762). As neither married, the title became extinct on the death of Henry Charles.

The family line continues with the Finch-Hattons, Earls of Winchilsea and Nottingham, whose ancestor, Daniel Finch, 7th Earl of Winchilsea and 2nd Earl of Nottingham, married Anne Hatton, daughter of the 1st Viscount Hatton.

<text>Donald Redfield Griffin (August 3, 1915 – November 7, 2003) was an American professor of zoology at various universities who conducted seminal research in animal behavior, animal navigation, acoustic orientation and sensory biophysics. In 1938, while an undergraduate at Harvard University, he began studying the navigational method of bats, which he identified as animal echolocation in 1944. In &quot;The Question of Animal Awareness&quot; (1976), he argued that animals are conscious like humans. Griffin was the originator of the concept of mentophobia: the denial of the consciousness of other animals by scientists.

== Biography ==
Griffin was born on August 3, 1915, in Southampton, New York, and attended Harvard University, where he was awarded bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees. After serving on the faculty of Cornell University he became a professor at his alma mater and later worked at Rockefeller University.

While at Harvard in the late 1930s, Griffin worked with Robert Galambos on studies of animal echolocation. Griffin conducted preliminary tests during the summer of 1939 when he was a research fellow at the Edmund Niles Huyck Preserve and Biological Research Station in Rensselaerville, New York. He set up a minimal bat flight facility in a room measuring in a barn and then measured the ability of bats to avoid obstacles by having them fly through a barrier of metal wires suspended from a ceiling.
The remaining work was done at Harvard&#x27;s Physical Laboratories. Using sound capture technology that had been developed by physicist G. W. Pierce, Galambos and Pierce were able to determine that bats generate and hear sounds an octave higher than can be heard by humans and other animals. Experiments they conducted used methods developed by Hallowell Davis to monitor the brains of bats and their hearing responses as they navigated their way past wires suspended from a laboratory ceiling. They showed how bats used echolocation to accurately avoid obstacles, which they were unable to do if their mouths or ears were kept shut. Griffin coined the term &quot;echolocation&quot; in 1944 to describe the phenomenon, which many physiologists of the day could not believe was possible. During World War II, Griffin worked for National Defense Research Committee, where he supported the approval of the bat bomb.

At a time when animal thinking was a topic deemed unfit for serious research, Griffin became a pioneer in the field of cognitive ethology, starting research in 1978 that studied how animals think. His observations of the sophisticated abilities of animals to gather food and interact with their environment and each other led him to conclude that animals were conscious, thinking beings, not the mere automatons that had been postulated. In its obituary, &quot;The New York Times&quot; credited Griffin as &quot;the only reason that animal thinking was given consideration at all&quot;. While critics argue that cognitive ethology is anthropomorphic and subjective, those in the field have studied the ways that animals form concepts and mental states based on their interactions with their environment, showing how animals base their actions and anticipate the responses of other sentient beings. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1952. In 1958 he was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1971.

He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences.

Griffin was the Director of the Institute for Research in Animal Behavior, in the 1960s, which was formed as a collaboration between Rockefeller University and the New York Zoological Society (now Wildlife Conservation Society). In 1965 following on from research on bats conducted at the New York Zoological Society&#x27;s field station in Trinidad and Tobago, he married Jocelyn Crane.

A resident of Lexington, Massachusetts, since his 1986 departure from Rockefeller University, Griffin died at his home there at age 88 on November 7, 2003. He was survived by two daughters and a son from his first marriage.

<doc id="297803" wikidata="Q1277557" url="?curid=297803" title="Democratic Federal Yugoslavia">
<text>Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, also known as Democratic Federative Yugoslavia (DF Yugoslavia or DFY), was a provisional state established during World War II on 29 November 1943 through the Second Session of the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ). The National Committee for the Liberation of Yugoslavia (NKOJ) was its original executive body. Throughout its existence it was governed by Marshal Josip Broz Tito as prime minister.

It was recognized by the Allies at the Tehran Conference, along with the AVNOJ as its deliberative body. The Yugoslav government-in-exile of King Peter II in London, partly due to pressure from the United Kingdom, recognized the AVNOJ government with the Treaty of Vis, signed on 16 June 1944 between the prime minister of the government-in-exile, Ivan Šubašić, and Tito. With the Treaty of Vis, the government-in-exile and the NKOJ agreed to merge into a provisional government as soon as possible. The form of the new government was agreed upon in a second Tito–Šubašić agreement signed on 1 November 1944 in the recently liberated Yugoslav capital of Belgrade. DF Yugoslavia became one of the founding members of the United Nations upon the signing of the United Nations Charter in October 1945.

The state was formed to unite the Yugoslav resistance movement to the occupation of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers. The agreement left the issue of whether the state would be a monarchy or a republic intentionally undecided until after the war had ended so the position of head of state was vacant. After the merger of the governments, the state was reformed as a one-party Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia with Josip Broz Tito as Prime Minister and Ivan Šubašić as minister of foreign affairs.

==History==
The Second Session of the AVNOJ, held in Jajce in November 1943, opened with a declaration that read in part:
#That the Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia be constituted as the supreme legislative and executive representative body of Yugoslavia as the supreme representative of the sovereignty of the peoples and of the State of Yugoslavia as a whole, and that a National Committee of Liberation of Yugoslavia be established as an organ with all of the features of a national government, through which the Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia will realize its executive function.
#That the traitorous &quot;government&quot; in exile be deprived of all rights as the legal government of Yugoslavia, particularly of the right to represent the peoples of Yugoslavia anywhere or before anyone.
#That all international treaties and obligations concluded abroad in the name of Yugoslavia by the &quot;government&quot; in exile be reviewed with a view to their invalidation or renewal or approval, and that all international treaties and obligations which the so-called &quot;government&quot; in exile may eventually conclude abroad in the future receive no recognition.
#That Yugoslavia be established on a democratic federal principle as a state of equal peoples.
The AVNOJ then issued six decrees and the Presidium of the AVNOJ, which continued its functions when it was not in session, followed with four decisions. Together these comprised the constitution of the new state taking shape in Yugoslavia. On 30 November the Presidium gave Tito the rank of Marshal of Yugoslavia and appointed him president of the government (or acting prime minister) and Minister of National Defence. Three vice presidents and thirteen other ministers were appointed to the NKOJ.

The name &quot;Democratic Federative Yugoslavia&quot; was officially adopted on 17 February 1944. On the same day they adopted the five-torch emblem of Yugoslavia.

After the deposition of King Peter II, the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia was proclaimed on 29 November 1945.

== Government ==

Its legislature, after November 1944, was the Provisional Assembly. The Tito-Šubašić agreement of 1944 declared that the state was a pluralist democracy that guaranteed: democratic liberties; personal freedom; freedom of speech, assembly, and religion; and a free press. However, by January 1945 Tito had shifted the emphasis of his government away from emphasis on pluralist democracy, claiming that though he accepted democracy, he claimed there was no &quot;need&quot; for multiple parties, as he claimed that multiple parties were unnecessarily divisive in the midst of Yugoslavia&#x27;s war effort and that the People&#x27;s Front represented all the Yugoslav people. The People&#x27;s Front coalition, headed by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and its general secretary Marshal Josip Broz Tito, was a major movement within the government. Other political movements that joined the government included the &quot;Napred&quot; movement represented by Milivoje Marković.

Democratic Federal Yugoslavia was ruled by Temporary Government consisting mostly of Unitary National Liberation Front members and small number of other political parties from former Kingdom of Yugoslavia. President of the Government was Josip Broz Tito. Communists held 22 minister positions, including Finances, Internal Affairs, Justice, Transport and others. Ivan Šubašić, from Croatian Peasant Party and former ban of Croatian Banovina, was minister of Foreign Affairs, while Milan Grol, from Democratic Party, was Deputy Prime Minister. Many non-communist government members resigned due to disagreement with the new policy.

== Administrative divisions ==
Democratic Federal Yugoslavia consisted of six federal states and two autonomous units:

* Federated State of Serbia
** Autonomous Province of Vojvodina
** Kosovo and Metohija Autonomous Region
* Federated State of Croatia
* Federated State of Bosnia and Herzegovina
* Federated State of Slovenia
* Federated State of Montenegro
* Democratic Federal Macedonia

Although it is the northernmost settlement in the council area of North Ayrshire it is contiguous with Wemyss Bay, which is in Inverclyde, and has a PA zone postcode unlike the rest of Ayrshire which is in the KA zone. The dividing line is the Kelly Burn, which flows into the Firth of Clyde just south of the Rothesay ferry terminal. Despite their proximity, the two villages have historically been divided, Skelmorlie in Ayrshire and Wemyss Bay in Renfrewshire.

Skelmorlie itself is divided into two sections, Lower and Upper Skelmorlie. There is one primary school in the village, with secondary age pupils going to Largs Academy in North Ayrshire. In common with this part of the Clyde foreshore, the rich red sandstone is a prominent feature of the landscape and housing in Skelmorlie.

==Early Skelmorlie==
The village is nestled on a plateau and is situated 30–60 m above sea level. It overlooks the Firth of Clyde, with views across to the beginning of the Scottish Highlands. The outstanding panoramic view from the area stretches from Arran and the &quot;sleeping warrior&quot; in the south-west to the mountains either side of Loch Long to the North.

It is known that &quot;a significant population&quot; lived around the area behind the present-day Manor Park Hotel in the 9th to 11th century, and evidence supports the theory that an early Celtic church existed there before the arrival of the Cluniac Monks (who formed Paisley Abbey in 1163) and the foundation of the Roman Church.

The land on which the modern day village now stands was passed from King Malcolm III to the Cunninghames, and was subsequently acquired by Sir Alexander de Montgomerie of Ardrossan on 25 March 1453, when his sister Anne married Sir Robert Cunninghame of Kilmaurs.

The Montgomeries were Normans, descended from William the Conqueror&#x27;s great grandmother. There were thirteen Montgomeries of Skelmorlie, the line being founded in 1461 by George Montgomerie, 2nd son of the first Lord Montgomerie.

The earliest known record of a &quot;building&quot; in the village is a building in the shape of a simple keep, which was built around 1502
on the site of what is now Skelmorlie Castle. This keep was in the corner of the castle nearest Stirrats Farm.

There were six baronets (a holder of a hereditary title awarded by the British Crown titled Sir, but never entitled to sit in the House of Lords), starting with Sir Robert Montgomerie in 1628 (knighted by King James VI and who attended his own funeral and wept with the mourners in 1651) and ending with Sir Hugh Montgomerie, who was very active in the political affairs of Glasgow, being both Provost and MP for Glasgow; he was also a commissioner of the Treaty of the Union.

Sir Hugh&#x27;s nephew Robert had an elder daughter called Lilias, whose marriage united the estate to the senior branch of the Family of Eglinton. The Cunninghames held the northern part of Skelmorlie for a while before passing it to the Montgomeries, the split being the burn at the Meigle. The southern half was further split in two - nearest the south was Blackhouse (on or near to the site of the Manor Park Hotel) and nearest the north was Thirdpart, Barr, Moat and Auchengarth.

The area of Knock entered into the possession of John, 1st Montgomerie of Blackhouse, when his son Patrick married a Frazer of Knock. A feu charter in favour of &quot;Patrick Montgomerie of Blackhous&quot; can still be seen in the Manor Park Hotel.

Patrick was succeeded by Hugh Montgomerie and then by John Montgomerie. John was a Lieutenant Colonel in the Covenanters 
who was killed fighting Cromwell at Dunbar, his heir, also Patrick sold the estate to the Bannatynes of Kelly in 1633 and was the last of the Montgomeries of Blackhouse. The estate stayed part of the Kelly estate until the 1800s

When Kelly Castle was burnt in 1740, the Bannatynes moved into Blackhouse which they had owned for a century. They sold it in 1780 and bought it back in 1795 after Kelly was sold.

The 18th Century saw the end of feudal society (where peasants worked the land and contributed work to their land&#x27;lords&#x27;) and the growth of industry. Communities were beginning to form at Finnock (Inverkip), Kellybridge and Skelmorlie (Meigle). Simultaneously, some of this population was moving and accumulating in Largs.

Most significantly, the 18th century saw the rise in the importance of the River Clyde and the increase in trade that it brought.

The original road from Greenock went up Station Hill, up Skelmorlie Castle Road, down past the Castle, veered left (never reaching where the main road is now) then back up through Meigle to Largs. It was close to this road on the high ground that all the habitation existed.

The area between the Kelly Burn and the track from Innes Park Road to Skelmorlie Community Centre was renamed Oakfield.

==History==

Skelmorlie&#x27;s history is recorded as far back as the fifteenth century. Skelmorlie Castle, south of the village, is a tower house built on the site of an older structure in 1502. Much altered and added to since, it is an ancient seat of the Clan Montgomery (a notable burial tomb of the family can be seen at Skelmorlie Aisle in Largs). During the nineteenth century the village was once home to many Glasgow tea barons. On the cliff above the shore a large hydropathic institution once stood, with access from the main road via a lift whose shaft was hewn out of the rock face. The building later operated as a hotel, but was demolished in the 1990s.

To the south of Skelmorlie is the serpent mound, a prehistoric, perhaps druidic, site apparently carved either deliberately for religious uses or by nature then reused due to its natural shape.

On Saturday 18 April 1925, an embankment on the reservoir which belonged to the Eglinton Estate and provided the main water supply for the whole village gave way, releasing millions of gallons of water down through the village. After 10 minutes many homes, streets and gardens were shattered and five people, four of them children, lay dead.

The composer and arranger Brian Fahey and his wife Audrey lived in Skelmorlie from 1972 until her death in 2006. Nowadays Skelmorlie has a population of 1880 residents.

==Skelmorlie Measured Mile==

Before the introduction of GPS systems, measured nautical miles were used to measure the speed of new ships under sea trials before being handed over by the shipyard to the owner. In the early part of the 20th century, the Royal Navy used a measured nautical mile in the Firth of Clyde off Skelmorlie, known as the &#x27;Skelmorlie Mile&#x27;, as the range for speed trials of new warships. The mile was also used for merchant shipping trials well into the 1980s.

In simple terms, a nautical measured mile is a nautical mile which is marked by two pairs of posts on or near the shore. The ship, already at top speed and on the requisite bearing, sails from one pair of posts to the next. A stopwatch is started when the first two posts are aligned and then stopped when the next two posts are aligned. Each post has a &#x27;V&#x27; or inverted V-shaped marker on it which forms an &#x27;X&#x27; with its partner post when they are exactly aligned. To accurately measure performance, ships had to make several runs in both directions to compensate for variations in wind and tide.

The &#x27;Skelmorlie Mile&#x27; is a Category B Listed Structure. It was established in 1866 by the Clyde shipbuilding firm of Robert Napier &amp; Sons. It was surveyed by two different land surveyors, namely Kyle &amp; Frew and Smith &amp; Wharrie, and was checked by Admiralty staff.

It consists of two pairs of tall, white painted poles, each pair set from each other. The poles are set on concrete bases, with iron stays, and have sight markers at the upper level. The northern pair of posts can be found by the bus shelter at the foot of the Hydro Steps, near the turning point on Shore Road. One of these is on the shore and can be accessed by walking a couple of hundred metres south and entering the beach by the steps at the small pumping station. The other northern post is mounted halfway up a cliff behind the bus shelter and has fallen into severe disrepair, the top half having snapped and fallen to the side. The southern pair of posts are at the south end of Skelmorlie, immediately south of Skelmorlie Castle. One of these is on the rocky shore, near the A78 road, the other is in a field between the A78 and Meigle.

<doc id="297809" wikidata="Q83286" url="?curid=297809" title="Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia">
<text>The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (commonly abbreviated as SFRY or SFR Yugoslavia), known from 1945 to 1963 as the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia, commonly referred to as Socialist Yugoslavia or simply Yugoslavia, was a country in Central and Southeast Europe. It was established in 1945, following World War II, and lasted until 1992, breaking up as a consequence of the Yugoslav Wars. Spanning an area of in the Balkans, Yugoslavia was bordered by the Adriatic Sea and Italy to the west, Austria and Hungary to the north, Bulgaria and Romania to the east, and Albania and Greece to the south. It was a one-party socialist state and federation governed by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, and had six constituent republics: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. Within Serbia was the Yugoslav capital city of Belgrade as well as two autonomous Yugoslav provinces: Kosovo and Vojvodina.

The country emerged as Democratic Federal Yugoslavia on 29 November 1943, during the second session of the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia midst World War II in Yugoslavia. Recognised by the Allies of World War II at the Tehran Conference as the legal successor state to Kingdom of Yugoslavia, it was a provisionally governed state formed to unite the Yugoslav resistance movement to the occupation of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers. Following the country&#x27;s liberation, King Peter II was deposed, the monarchical rule was ended, and on 29 November 1945, the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia was proclaimed. Led by Josip Broz Tito, the new communist government sided with the Eastern Bloc at the beginning of the Cold War but pursued a policy of neutrality following the 1948 Tito–Stalin split; it became a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement, and transitioned from a command economy to market-based socialism. The country was renamed Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1963.

After Tito died on 4 May 1980, the Yugoslav economy began to collapse, which increased unemployment and inflation. The economic crisis led to rising ethnic nationalism and political dissidence in the late 1980s and early 1990s. With the fall of communism in Eastern Europe, efforts to transition into a confederation failed; the two wealthiest republics, Croatia and Slovenia, seceded and gained some international recognition in 1991. The federation dissolved along the borders of federated republics, hastened by the start of the Yugoslav Wars, and formally broke up on 27 April 1992. Two republics, Serbia and Montenegro, remained within a reconstituted state known as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, or FR Yugoslavia, but this state was not recognized internationally as the sole successor state to SFR Yugoslavia. &quot;Former Yugoslavia&quot; is now commonly used retrospectively.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Yugoslavia&quot;, an anglicised transcription of , is a compound word made up of (&#x27;yug&#x27;; with the &#x27;j&#x27; pronounced like an English &#x27;y&#x27;) and . The Slavic word means &#x27;south&#x27;, while (&quot;Slavia&quot;) denotes a &#x27;land of the Slavs&#x27;. Thus, a translation of would be &#x27;South-Slavia&#x27; or &#x27;Land of the South Slavs&#x27;. The federation&#x27;s official name varied considerably between 1945 and 1992. Yugoslavia was formed in 1918 under the name Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. In January 1929, King Alexander I assumed dictatorship of the kingdom and renamed it the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, for the first time making &quot;Yugoslavia&quot;—which had been used colloquially for decades (even before the country was formed)—the state&#x27;s official name. After the Axis occupied the kingdom during World War II, the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ) announced in 1943 the formation of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia (DF Yugoslavia or DFY) in the country&#x27;s substantial resistance-controlled areas. The name deliberately left the republic-or-kingdom question open. In 1945, King Peter II was officially deposed, with the state reorganized as a republic, and accordingly renamed the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia (FPR Yugoslavia or FPRY), with the constitution coming into force in 1946. In 1963, amid pervasive liberal constitutional reforms, the name &quot;Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&quot; was introduced. The state is most commonly called by that name, which it held for the longest period. Of the three main Yugoslav languages, the Serbo-Croatian and Macedonian names for the state were identical, while Slovene slightly differed in capitalization and the spelling of the adjective &quot;Socialist&quot;. The names are as follows:

*Serbo-Croatian and Macedonian
**Latin: 
**Cyrillic: 
**
*Slovene
**
Due to the name&#x27;s length, abbreviations were often used for the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, though it was most commonly known simply as &quot;Yugoslavia&quot;. The most common abbreviation is SFRY, though &quot;SFR Yugoslavia&quot; was also used in an official capacity, particularly by the media.

== History ==
=== World War II ===
On 6 April 1941, Yugoslavia was invaded by the Axis powers led by Nazi Germany; by 17 April 1941, the country was fully occupied and was soon carved up by the Axis. Yugoslav resistance was soon established in two forms, the Royal Yugoslav Army in the Homeland and the Communist Yugoslav Partisans. The Partisan supreme commander was Josip Broz Tito. Under his command, the movement soon began establishing &quot;liberated territories&quot; that attracted the occupying forces&#x27; attention. Unlike the various nationalist militias operating in occupied Yugoslavia, the Partisans were a pan-Yugoslav movement promoting the &quot;brotherhood and unity&quot; of Yugoslav nations and representing the Yugoslav political spectrum&#x27;s republican, left-wing, and socialist elements. The coalition of political parties, factions, and prominent individuals behind the movement was the People&#x27;s Liberation Front (&quot;Jedinstveni narodnooslobodilački front&quot;, JNOF), led by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ).

The Front formed a representative political body, the Anti-Fascist Council for the People&#x27;s Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ, &quot;Antifašističko Veće Narodnog Oslobođenja Jugoslavije&quot;). The AVNOJ met for the first time in Partisan-liberated Bihać on 26 November 1942 (First Session of the AVNOJ) and claimed the status of Yugoslavia&#x27;s deliberative assembly (parliament).

In 1943, the Yugoslav Partisans began attracting serious attention from the Germans. In two major operations, &quot;Fall Weiss&quot; (January to April 1943) and &quot;Fall Schwartz&quot; (15 May to 16 June 1943), the Axis attempted to stamp out the Yugoslav resistance once and for all. In the Battle of the Neretva and the Battle of the Sutjeska, the 20,000-strong Partisan Main Operational Group engaged a force of around 150,000 combined Axis troops. In both battles, despite heavy casualties, the Group evaded the trap and retreated to safety. The Partisans emerged stronger than before, occupying a more significant portion of Yugoslavia. The events greatly increased the Partisans&#x27; standing and granted them a favourable reputation among the Yugoslav populace, leading to increased recruitment. On 8 September 1943, Fascist Italy capitulated to the Allies, leaving their occupation zone in Yugoslavia open to the Partisans. Tito took advantage of this by briefly liberating the Dalmatian shore and its cities. This secured Italian weaponry and supplies for the Partisans, volunteers from the cities previously annexed by Italy, and Italian recruits crossing over to the Allies (the Garibaldi Division). After this favourable chain of events, the AVNOJ decided to meet for the second time, in Partisan-liberated Jajce. The Second Session of the AVNOJ lasted from 21 to 29 November 1943 (right before and during the Tehran Conference) and came to a number of conclusions. The most significant of these was the establishment of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, a state that would be a federation of six equal South Slavic republics (as opposed to the allegedly Serb predominance in pre-war Yugoslavia). The council decided on a &quot;neutral&quot; name and deliberately left the question of &quot;monarchy vs. republic&quot; open, ruling that Peter II would be allowed to return from exile in London only upon a favourable result of a pan-Yugoslav referendum on the question. Among other decisions, the AVNOJ formed a provisional executive body, the National Committee for the Liberation of Yugoslavia (NKOJ, &quot;Nacionalni komitet oslobođenja Jugoslavije&quot;), appointing Tito as prime minister. Having achieved success in the 1943 engagements, Tito was also granted the rank of Marshal of Yugoslavia. Favourable news also came from the Tehran Conference when the Allies concluded that the Partisans would be recognized as the Allied Yugoslav resistance movement and granted supplies and wartime support against the Axis occupation.

As the war turned decisively against the Axis in 1944, the Partisans continued to hold significant chunks of Yugoslav territory. With the Allies in Italy, the Yugoslav islands of the Adriatic Sea were a haven for the resistance. On 17 June 1944, the Partisan base on the island of Vis housed a conference between Prime Minister Tito of the NKOJ (representing the AVNOJ) and Prime Minister Ivan Šubašić of the royalist Yugoslav government-in-exile in London. The conclusions, known as the Tito-Šubašić Agreement, granted the King&#x27;s recognition to the AVNOJ and the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia (DFY) and provided for the establishment of a joint Yugoslav coalition government headed by Tito with Šubašić as the foreign minister, with the AVNOJ confirmed as the provisional Yugoslav parliament. Peter II&#x27;s government-in-exile in London, partly due to pressure from the United Kingdom, recognized the state in the agreement, signed by Šubašić and Tito on 17 June 1944. The DFY&#x27;s legislature, after November 1944, was the Provisional Assembly. The Tito-Šubašić agreement of 1944 declared that the state was a pluralist democracy that guaranteed democratic liberties; personal freedom; freedom of speech, assembly, and religion; and a free press. But by January 1945, Tito had shifted his government&#x27;s emphasis away from pluralist democracy, claiming that though he accepted democracy, multiple parties were unnecessarily divisive amid Yugoslavia&#x27;s war effort, and that the People&#x27;s Front represented all the Yugoslav people. The People&#x27;s Front coalition, headed by the KPJ and its general secretary Tito, was a major movement within the government. Other political movements that joined the government included the &quot;Napred&quot; movement represented by Milivoje Marković. Belgrade, Yugoslavia&#x27;s capital, was liberated with the Soviet Red Army&#x27;s help in October 1944, and the formation of a new Yugoslav government was postponed until 2 November 1944, when the Belgrade Agreement was signed. The agreements also provided for postwar elections to determine the state&#x27;s future system of government and economy.

By 1945, the Partisans were clearing out Axis forces and liberating the remaining parts of occupied territory. On 20 March, the Partisans launched their General Offensive in a drive to completely oust the Germans and the remaining collaborating forces. By the end of April, the remaining northern parts of Yugoslavia were liberated, and Yugoslav troops occupied chunks of southern German (Austrian) territory and Italian territory around Trieste. Yugoslavia was now once more a fully intact state, with its borders closely resembling their pre-1941 form, and was envisioned by the Partisans as a &quot;Democratic Federation&quot;, including six federated states: the Federated State of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FS Bosnia and Herzegovina), Federated State of Croatia (FS Croatia), Federated State of Macedonia (FS Macedonia), Federated State of Montenegro (FS Montenegro), Federated State of Serbia (FS Serbia), and Federated State of Slovenia (FS Slovenia). But the nature of its government remained unclear, and Tito was reluctant to include the exiled King Peter II in post-war Yugoslavia, as Winston Churchill demanded. In February 1945, Tito acknowledged the existence of a Regency Council representing the King, but the council&#x27;s first and only act was to proclaim a new government under Tito&#x27;s premiership. The nature of the state was still unclear immediately after the war, and on 26 June 1945, the government signed the United Nations Charter using only &quot;Yugoslavia&quot; as an official name, with no reference to either a kingdom or a republic. Acting as head of state on 7 March, the King appointed to his Regency Council constitutional lawyers Srđan Budisavljević, Ante Mandić, and Dušan Sernec. In doing so, he empowered his council to form a common temporary government with NKOJ and accept Tito&#x27;s nomination as prime minister of the first normal government. The Regency Council thus accepted Tito&#x27;s nomination on 29 November 1945 when FPRY was declared. By this unconditional transfer of power, King Peter II abdicated to Tito. This date, when the second Yugoslavia was born under international law, was thereafter marked as Yugoslavia&#x27;s national holiday &quot;Day of the Republic&quot;, but after the Communists&#x27; switch to authoritarianism, this holiday officially marked the 1943 Session of AVNOJ that coincidentally fell on the same date.

In the first months after the end of the war, the Partisans were very ruthless about executing those of collaboration along with anyone perceived to be their enemy. An American OSS officer reported from Dubrovnik: &quot;The inhabitants were living in a state of mortal terror...The Partisan attitude was that anybody who had stayed in town during the occupation and didn&#x27;t work in the Partisan underground was ipso facto a collaborator. The dreaded secret police was going to work and people were being taken from their homes to the old castle and shot everyday&quot;. One witness reported in the early summer of 1945: &quot;In Crnogrob there are mass graves. Trucks are bringing men with bound hands and feet every evening from the prison in Škofja Loka and no ever returns. Every evening one hears shots from Crnogrob&quot;. In July 1945, Tito ordered a stop to summary executions, but it was not until the fall of 1945 that the mass executions finally stopped. In Kosovo, there was an uprising that was only put down in the summer of 1945 as many Albanians did not want to rejoin Yugoslavia, and much preferred to join Albania. In attempt to settle the long-standing &quot;Macedonian question&quot;, Tito declared the Macedonians to be one of the official nationalities of Yugoslavia and created a republic for Macedonia. It was declared that Macedonians did not speak Bulgarian, but rather their own language, leading to the publication of several books meant to promote standard Macedonian.

=== Postwar period ===
The first Yugoslav post-World War II elections were set for 11 November 1945. By that time, the coalition of parties backing the Partisans, the People&#x27;s Liberation Front (&quot;Jedinstveni narodnooslobodilački front&quot;, JNOF), had been renamed the People&#x27;s Front (&quot;Narodni front&quot;, NOF). The People&#x27;s Front was primarily led by the KPJ and represented by Tito. The reputation of both benefited greatly from their wartime exploits and decisive success, and they enjoyed genuine support among the populace. But the old pre-war political parties were also reestablished. As early as January 1945, while the enemy was still occupying the northwest, Tito commented:

While the elections themselves were fairly conducted by a secret ballot, the campaign that preceded them was highly irregular. Opposition newspapers were banned on more than one occasion, and in Serbia, opposition leaders such as Milan Grol received threats via the press. The opposition withdrew from the election in protest of the hostile atmosphere, which caused the three royalist representatives, Grol, Šubašić, and Juraj Šutej, to secede from the provisional government. Indeed, voting was on a single list of People&#x27;s Front candidates with provision for opposition votes to be cast in separate voting boxes, a procedure that made electors identifiable by OZNA agents. The election results of 11 November 1945 were decisively in favour of the People&#x27;s Front, which received an average of 85% of the vote in each federated state. On 29 November, the second anniversary of the Second Session of the AVNOJ, the Constituent Assembly of Yugoslavia formally abolished the monarchy and declared the state a republic. The country&#x27;s official name became the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia (FPR Yugoslavia, FPRY), and the six federated states became &quot;People&#x27;s Republics&quot;. Yugoslavia became a one-party state and was considered in its earliest years a model of Communist orthodoxy. The principle concern of the new regime was rebuilding a country devastated by the war under the slogan &quot;No rest while we&#x27;re rebuilding!&quot; During the war, over a million people had been killed in Yugoslavia while 3.5 million people were homeless in 1945 and 289, 000 businesses had been completely wrecked. One-third of Yugoslav industries had been destroyed in the war and every single mine in the country had been wrecked. In 1944–1945, the Wehrmacht staged its standard &quot;scorched earth&quot; policy while retreating, and systematically destroyed bridges, railroads, telephone lines, electrical plants, roads, factories and mines, leaving Yugoslavia in ruins. The new regime mobilised thousands of people, especially young people, into work brigades that saw to rebuild the country. Between 1945 and 1953, Yugoslavia received a sum equal to $553.8 million US dollars to help rebuild from various sources, the largest of which was the United Nations for reconstruction as Yugoslavia received a sum equal to $419 million US dollars from the United Nations.

In 1947, Tito launched an ambitious Five-Year Plan, closely modelled after the First Five-Year Plan in the Soviet Union, that placed the first emphasis on investing in shipyards, machine manufacturing, and the electrical industry along with reopening the iron and coal mines with the aim of making Yugoslavia into a major producer of steel. A major weakness for the old Kingdom of Yugoslavia was a lack of an arms industry, and Tito intended for Communist Yugoslavia to be self-sufficient in arms, leading for dozens upon of arms factories being opened in Bosnia and Serbia in the late 1940s-early 1950s. By the mid-1950s, Tito had nearly achieved his aim of military autarky with virtually all the weapons being used by the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army being manufactured in Yugoslavia and the country later became a major exporter of arms to the Third World. Between 1947 and 1949, a third of the national income was invested in heavy industry and the number of Yugoslav workers increased fourfold to two million. Between 1953 and 1960, Yugoslavia&#x27;s industrial production increased by 13.83% annually, which gave Yugoslavia a higher rate of industrialization than Japan during the same decade, albeit Yugoslavia was starting from a much lower basis than Japan. Between 1947-1957, the population of Belgrade and Sarajevo increased by 18%, the population of Skopje by 36% and Zenica, which had been chosen as a new industrial by 53%.

The post-war era saw the flight or expulsions of the Italian and German minorities. Before the war, Yugoslavia had a population of half-million &quot;volksdeutsche&quot; (ethnic Germans), of whom the majority fled to the &quot;Reich&quot; in 1944–1945. The &quot;volksdeutsche&quot; were favored during the occupation, and many had served in the SS Prinz Eugen division that had been used to hunt down partisans, making the &quot;volksdeutsche&quot; minority the object of much hatred and distrust from the new regime. Of the remaining 200, 000 &quot;volksdeutsche&quot; living in Yugoslavia in 1945, the entire community had all of its assets confiscated by the new regime (including those &quot;volksdeutsch&quot; who joined the Partisans) and the &quot;volksdeutsche&quot; were placed into camps prior to their expulsion. in Dalmatia and Istria, there were massacres known as the &quot;foibe&quot; massacres of Italians who were suspected of supporting the Fascist regime, and the remaining Italians all either fled or were expelled.

Women had played a prominent role in the Partisans with about 100, 000 women having served in the Partisans between 1941 and 1945 as messengers, saboteurs, commissars, nurses, doctors, and soldiers. The female veterans insisted that they would expect equality in new Yugoslavia. In 1945, women were given the right to vote and hold office. The new regime favored giving Partisan veterans positions in the civil service, through this often caused problems. About two-thirds of the Communist party members in 1945 came from working class or peasant families, and many were barely literate. In October 1945, the Ministry of Forestry issued a memo saying that food and cigarettes were not to be tossed out of windows; spitting in the hallways was not acceptable and there was a &quot;purpose and a proper way to use toilets&quot;. The memory of the Second World War was ubiquitous in post-war Yugoslavia with most of the holidays such as Fighters&#x27; Day on 4 July and Army Day on 22 December having something to do with the war, and most of the local holidays likewise had something to do with the war. Over 200 feature films were released in post-war Yugoslavia about the Partisans, several of which became massive hits such as &quot;Walter Defends Sarajevo&quot; and &quot;Battle on the Neretva&quot;. The Communist regime constructed a legend under which depicted almost all of the Yugoslav peoples rallyng under the leadership of Tito in the People&#x27;s Liberation War as the war was called in Yugoslavia to resist the occupation. At least for a time, this legend served as an unifying factor. 

The Yugoslav government allied with the Soviet Union under Stalin and early in the Cold War shot down two American airplanes flying in Yugoslav airspace, on 9 and 19 August 1946. These were the first aerial shootdowns of western aircraft during the Cold War and caused deep distrust of Tito in the United States and even calls for military intervention against Yugoslavia. The new Yugoslavia also closely followed the Stalinist Soviet model of economic development in this period, some aspects of which achieved considerable success. In particular, the public works of the period organized by the government rebuilt and even improved Yugoslav infrastructure (in particular the road system) with little cost to the state. Tensions with the West were high as Yugoslavia joined the Cominform, and the early phase of the Cold War began with Yugoslavia pursuing an aggressive foreign policy. Having liberated most of the Julian March and Carinthia, and with historic claims to both those regions, the Yugoslav government began diplomatic maneuvering to include them in Yugoslavia. The West opposed both these demands. The greatest point of contention was the port city of Trieste. The city and its hinterland were liberated mostly by the Partisans in 1945, but pressure from the western Allies forced them to withdraw to the so-called &quot;Morgan Line&quot;. The Free Territory of Trieste was established and separated into Zones A and B, administered by the western Allies and Yugoslavia, respectively. Yugoslavia was initially backed by Stalin, but by 1947 he had begun to cool toward its ambitions. The crisis eventually dissolved as the Tito–Stalin split started, with Zone A granted to Italy and Zone B to Yugoslavia.

Meanwhile, civil war raged in Greece – Yugoslavia&#x27;s southern neighbour – between Communists and the right-wing government, and the Yugoslav government was determined to bring about a Communist victory. Yugoslavia dispatched significant assistance—arms and ammunition, supplies, and military experts on partisan warfare (such as General Vladimir Dapčević)—and even allowed the Greek Communist forces to use Yugoslav territory as a safe haven. Although the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, and (Yugoslav-dominated) Albania had also granted military support, Yugoslav assistance was far more substantial. But this Yugoslav foreign adventure also came to an end with the Tito–Stalin split, as the Greek Communists, expecting Tito&#x27;s overthrow, refused any assistance from his government. Without it, they were greatly disadvantaged, and were defeated in 1949. As Yugoslavia was the country&#x27;s only Communist neighbour in the immediate postwar period, the People&#x27;s Republic of Albania was effectively a Yugoslav satellite. Neighboring Bulgaria was under increasing Yugoslav influence as well, and talks began to negotiate the political unification of Albania and Bulgaria with Yugoslavia. The major point of contention was that Yugoslavia wanted to absorb the two and transform them into additional federated republics. Albania was in no position to object, but the Bulgarian view was that a new Balkan Federation would see Bulgaria and Yugoslavia as a whole uniting on equal terms. As these negotiations began, Yugoslav representatives Edvard Kardelj and Milovan Đilas were summoned to Moscow alongside a Bulgarian delegation, where Stalin and Vyacheslav Molotov attempted to browbeat them into accepting Soviet control over the merger between the countries, and generally tried to force them into subordination. The Soviets did not express a specific view on Yugoslav-Bulgarian unification but wanted to ensure Moscow approved every decision by both parties. The Bulgarians did not object, but the Yugoslav delegation withdrew from the Moscow meeting. Recognizing the level of Bulgarian subordination to Moscow, Yugoslavia withdrew from the unification talks and shelved plans for the annexation of Albania in anticipation of a confrontation with the Soviet Union.

From the beginning, the foreign policy of the Yugoslav government under Tito assigned high importance to developing strong diplomatic relations with other nations, including those outside the Balkans and Europe. Yugoslavia quickly established formal relations with India, Burma, and Indonesia following their independence from the British and Dutch colonial empires. Official relations between Yugoslavia and the Republic of China were established with the Soviet Union&#x27;s permission. Simultaneously, Yugoslavia maintained close contacts with the Chinese Communist Party and supported its cause in the Chinese Civil War.

=== Informbiro period ===
The Tito–Stalin, or Yugoslav–Soviet split, took place in the spring and early summer of 1948. Its title pertains to Tito, at the time the Yugoslav Prime Minister (President of the Federal Assembly), and Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin. In the West, Tito was thought of as a loyal Communist leader, second only to Stalin in the Eastern Bloc. However, having largely liberated itself with only limited Red Army support, Yugoslavia steered an independent course and was constantly experiencing tensions with the Soviet Union. Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav government considered themselves allies of Moscow, while Moscow considered Yugoslavia a satellite and often treated it as such. Previous tensions erupted over a number of issues, but after the Moscow meeting, an open confrontation was beginning. Next came an exchange of letters directly between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), and the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ). In the first CPSU letter of 27 March 1948, the Soviets accused the Yugoslavs of denigrating Soviet socialism via statements such as &quot;socialism in the Soviet Union has ceased to be revolutionary&quot;. It also claimed that the KPJ was not &quot;democratic enough&quot;, and that it was not acting as a vanguard that would lead the country to socialism. The Soviets said that they &quot;could not consider such a Communist party organization to be Marxist-Leninist, Bolshevik&quot;. The letter also named a number of high-ranking officials as &quot;dubious Marxists&quot; (Milovan Đilas, Aleksandar Ranković, Boris Kidrič, and Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo) inviting Tito to purge them, and thus cause a rift in his own party. Communist officials Andrija Hebrang and Sreten Žujović supported the Soviet view. Tito, however, saw through it, refused to compromise his own party, and soon responded with his own letter. The KPJ response on 13 April 1948 was a strong denial of the Soviet accusations, both defending the revolutionary nature of the party and re-asserting its high opinion of the Soviet Union. However, the KPJ noted also that &quot;no matter how much each of us loves the land of socialism, the Soviet Union, he can in no case love his own country less&quot;. In a speech, the Yugoslav Prime Minister stated:
The 31-page-long Soviet answer of 4 May 1948 admonished the KPJ for failing to admit and correct its mistakes, and went on to accuse it of being too proud of their successes against the Germans, maintaining that the Red Army had &quot;saved them from destruction&quot; (an implausible statement, as Tito&#x27;s partisans had successfully campaigned against Axis forces for four years before the appearance of the Red Army there). This time, the Soviets named Tito and Edvard Kardelj as the principal &quot;heretics&quot;, while defending Hebrang and Žujović. The letter suggested that the Yugoslavs bring their &quot;case&quot; before the Cominform. The KPJ responded by expelling Hebrang and Žujović from the party, and by answering the Soviets on 17 May 1948 with a letter which sharply criticized Soviet attempts to devalue the successes of the Yugoslav resistance movement. On 19 May 1948, a correspondence by Mikhail Suslov informed Tito that the Cominform (&quot;Informbiro&quot; in Serbo-Croatian), would be holding a session on 28 June 1948 in Bucharest almost completely dedicated to the &quot;Yugoslav issue&quot;. The Cominform was an association of Communist parties that was the primary Soviet tool for controlling the political developments in the Eastern Bloc. The date of the meeting, 28 June, was carefully chosen by the Soviets as the triple anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo Field (1389), the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo (1914), and the adoption of the Vidovdan Constitution (1921). Tito, personally invited, refused to attend under a dubious excuse of illness. When an official invitation arrived on 19 June 1948, Tito again refused. On the first day of the meeting, 28 June, the Cominform adopted the prepared text of a resolution, known in Yugoslavia as the &quot;Resolution of the Informbiro&quot; (&quot;Rezolucija Informbiroa&quot;). In it, the other Cominform (Informbiro) members expelled Yugoslavia, citing &quot;nationalist elements&quot; that had &quot;managed in the course of the past five or six months to reach a dominant position in the leadership&quot; of the KPJ. The resolution warned Yugoslavia that it was on the path back to bourgeois capitalism due to its nationalist, independence-minded positions, and accused the party itself of &quot;Trotskyism&quot;. This was followed by the severing of relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, beginning the period of Soviet–Yugoslav conflict between 1948 and 1955 known as the Informbiro Period.

After the break with the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia found itself economically and politically isolated as the country&#x27;s Eastern Bloc-oriented economy began to falter. At the same time, Stalinist Yugoslavs, known in Yugoslavia as &quot;cominformists&quot;, began fomenting civil and military unrest. A number of cominformist rebellions and military insurrections took place, along with acts of sabotage. However, the Yugoslav security service (UDBA) led by Aleksandar Ranković, was quick and efficient in cracking down on insurgent activity. Much of the Yugoslav Communist Party membership was loyal to the Soviet Union and between 1948 and 1955 over 55, 600 party members were expelled as &quot;Cominformists&quot;. The two most prominent pro-Soviet members to be expelled were the Croat Andrija Hebrang and the Serb Sreten Žujoviĉ. Invasion appeared imminent, as Soviet military units massed along the border with the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic, while the Hungarian People&#x27;s Army was quickly increased in size from 2 to 15 divisions. The UDBA began arresting alleged Cominformists even under suspicion of being pro-Soviet. However, from the start of the crisis, Tito began making overtures to the United States and the West. Consequently, Stalin&#x27;s plans were thwarted as Yugoslavia began shifting its alignment. About approximately 16, 000 people were convicted of being &quot;Cominformists&quot; and/or of being &quot;suspicious&quot; and sent to the concentration camp on the island of Goli Otok to be &quot;reeducated&quot;. Most of those convicted of being &quot;Cominformists&quot; and sent to Goli Otok were party members who fought with the Partisans during the Second World War, and were for this reason treated in an especially harsh manner for siding with Stalin against Tito. However, Tito&#x27;s defiant stance against the Soviet Union won him much popular respect that lasted for decades with a librarian from Zagreb saying in the early 1970s: &quot;I don&#x27;t like him, but I guess we all respect him for having stood up to the Russians and having kept us out of their clutches&quot;.

The West welcomed the Yugoslav-Soviet rift and, in 1949 commenced a flow of economic aid, assisted in averting famine in 1950, and covered much of Yugoslavia&#x27;s trade deficit for the next decade. The United States began shipping weapons to Yugoslavia in 1951. Tito, however, was wary of becoming too dependent on the West as well, and military security arrangements concluded in 1953 as Yugoslavia refused to join NATO and began developing a significant military industry of its own. With the American response in the Korean War serving as an example of the West&#x27;s commitment, Stalin began backing down from war with Yugoslavia. The Truman administration misunderstood the Tito-Stalin split as a sign that Yugoslavia would ally with the West, and it took some time for those in positions in power in Washington to understand that Tito wanted Yugoslavia to be neutral in the Cold War.

=== Reform ===


Yugoslavia began a number of fundamental reforms in the early 1950s, bringing about change in three major directions: rapid liberalization and decentralization of the country&#x27;s political system, the institution of a new, unique economic system, and a diplomatic policy of non-alignment. Edvard Kardelj, the chief ideologue of the Communist regime, in a 1949 article &quot;On People&#x27;s Democracy&quot;, harshly criticised the Stalinist regimes in the Soviet Union for becoming a bureaucratic dictatorship that had merged party and state into one, and had elevated itself over Soviet society. Taking a phrase from Frederich Engels, Kardeji called for a &quot;withering state&quot;, arguing that ordinary people should placed in charge of their workplaces to create the sort of society that Karl Marx and Engels had envisioned in the 19th century. In 1950, Kardeji along with Milovan Djilas, Moša Pijade, Boris Kidrič and Vladimir Bakarić drafted the &quot;Basic Law on the Mangement of State Economic Enterprises&quot; that called for councils elected by the workers to manage businesses along with a decentralisation of state management of the economy. Yugoslavia refused to take part in the Communist Warsaw Pact and instead took a neutral stance in the Cold War, becoming a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement along with countries like India, Egypt and Indonesia, and pursuing centre-left influences that promoted a non-confrontational policy towards the United States. The country distanced itself from the Soviets in 1948 and started to build its own way to socialism under the strong political leadership of Tito, sometimes informally called &quot;Titoism&quot;. Tito reveled in the role of a world leader, and between 1944 and 1980 made 169 official visits to 92 nations, and in the process he met 175 heads of state along with 110 prime ministers. These frequent visits abroad served an important propaganda function, namely to show that Tito as one of the leaders of the non-aligned movement was an important world leader because Yugoslavia was an important nation.

The economic reforms began with the introduction of workers&#x27; self-management in June 1950. In this system, profits were shared among the workers themselves as workers&#x27; councils controlled production and the profits. An industrial sector began to emerge thanks to the government&#x27;s implementation of industrial and infrastructure development programs. Exports of industrial products, led by heavy machinery, transportation machines (especially in the shipbuilding industry), and military technology and equipment rose by a yearly increase of 11%. All in all, the annual growth of the gross domestic product (GDP) through to the early 1980s averaged 6.1%. Political liberalization began with the reduction of the massive state (and party) bureaucratic apparatus, a process described as the &quot;whittling down of the state&quot; by Boris Kidrič, President of the Yugoslav Economic Council (economics minister). On 2 November 1952, the Sixth Congress of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia introduced the &quot;Basic Law&quot;, which emphasized the &quot;personal freedom and rights of man&quot; and the freedom of &quot;free associations of working people&quot;. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ) changed its name at this time to the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (LCY/SKJ), becoming a federation of six republican Communist parties. The result was a regime that was somewhat more humane than other Communist states. However, the LCY retained absolute power; as in all Communist regimes, the legislature did little more than rubber-stamp decisions already made by the LCY&#x27;s Politburo. The UDBA, while operating with considerably more restraint than its counterparts in the rest of Eastern Europe, was nonetheless a feared tool of government control. UDBA was particularly notorious for assassinating suspected &quot;enemies of the state&quot; who lived in exile overseas. The media remained under restrictions that were somewhat onerous by Western standards, but still had somewhat more latitude than their counterparts in other Communist countries. Nationalist groups were a particular target of the authorities, with numerous arrests and prison sentences handed down over the years for separatist activities. Dissent from a radical faction within the party led by Milovan Đilas, advocating the near-complete annihilation of the state apparatus, was at this time put down by Tito&#x27;s intervention.

The post-war period saw a rapid urbanization with some 5.5 million people leaving the countryside for the cities between 1945 and 1970. By 1969, the population of Belgrade passed the one million mark for the first time; that year, it was estimated that two of three Belgradians had been born in the countryside. In the late 1950s, the car manufacturer Zastava in Kragujevac began the production under license from Fiat of a small car, known officially as the Fiat 600 and unofficially as the &quot;fiċo&quot; that become ubiquitous in Yugoslavia for decades afterward. By 1968, about 8% of the Yugoslav population owned a car, and the majority were the &quot;fiċo&quot;, which became a symbol of Yugoslavia itself. In 1947, it was estimated that that one radio set was shared by an average of 70 people; by 1965, the typical radio set was shared by an average of 7 people. Increased literacy led to a massive demand for books with an average of 13, 000 books being published annually in the 1960s. In 1945, one out of ever two Yugoslavs were illiterate; by 1961 the illiteracy rate had fallen to 20% of the population. By 1953, 71% of all Yugoslav children finished elementary school and by 1981 97% of all Yugoslav children finished school. In 1945, Yugoslavia had three universities and two institutions of higher learning. By 1965, Yugoslavia had 158 universities and colleges. With the exceptions of the Soviet Union, Sweden, and the Netherlands, no European country had quite as many university students. By 1960, about 500, 000 Yugoslavs were attending university and by 1970 the number had reached 650, 000. The composition of the Communist Party/League of Communists changed during the post-war decades. Of the 12, 000 people who were party members in 1941, only 3, 000 survived World War Two with the rest all being killed. After 1945, the party took in a massive number of new members, the majority of whom came from either a peasant or working-class background. In 1945, every second party member had a peasant background, every third member had a working-class background and every tenth member had a white collar background. By 1966, the membership of the League of Communists was mostly made up of people from a middle-class background with 39% of all league members having a white collar job while league members with a peasant background made up 7% of the membership. By the early 1960s, the so-called &quot;socialist bourgeoise&quot; had emerged as the dominant class both politically and economically. The typical &quot;socialist bourgeoise&quot; was someone with a university education who held a management job; or worked as an engineer or some other technical skilled trade; or was a member of the new capitalist class, usually a restaurant owner or someone who became rich as a result of the tourism trade. By the mid-1960s, the League of Communists had by large and ceased to be an ideological party committed to Marxism, and instead become just a vehicle for social advancement of ambitious careerists. League members were more interested in obtaining status symbols such as luxury cars, large houses, expensive clothing and the &quot;vikendica&quot; (weekend cottage) than in creating a Marxist society. One League member told a Western journalist in 1965: &quot;We go to Trieste about twice a year to buy clothing and cosmetics. Italian clothing is really not much than ours, but we want something others don&#x27;t have, even if it costs us a lot of money&quot;. In 1962, a group of dissenting Marxist intellectuals founded the journal &quot;Praxis&quot;, which was discreetly critical of the regime. The major theme of the Praxis group was &quot;alienation&quot; and &quot;humanity&quot; with the argument that people were becoming more &quot;alienated&quot; from society and the solution was they proposed was freedom of speech, multiparty democracy, and more decentralization of the federation.

Increased prosperity led to higher television ownership. In 1960, there were 30, 000 television sets in operation in all of Yugoslavia. By 1964, there were 440, 000 television sets in operation in Yugoslavia. The greater number of people who owned televisions led to the end of the traditional evening get-together known as the &quot;sijelo&quot; that once formed the focus of social life in Yugoslavia as people were too busy watching television in the evening. Censorship was less extreme than elsewhere in Eastern Europe in the 1960s, not the less because the authorities could only prosecute a journalist after an article had been published, not just for writing an article as was the case in the rest of Eastern Europe. Likewise, censorship was generally only enforced by the republics rather than by the federal government, so it was quite common for an article to be banned in one republic while being allowed in other republics. Starting in the early 1960s, Yugoslavs were permitted to travel to Western Europe without visas, and by the early 1960s, an average of 300, 000 Yugoslavs visited Western Europe as tourists. During the same period, it became common for Yugoslavs to go to Western Europe, especially West Germany, to work abroad as &quot;guest workers&quot;. By 1971, about 775, 000 people (about 3.8% of the total Yugoslav population) were living abroad as &quot;guest workers&quot;. The remittances sent home by the &quot;guest workers&quot; led to a significant rise in the standard of living, and by the 1960s it became common for those whose family members were working abroad to own a car and electrical appliances such as a refrigerator. The socialist regime championed women&#x27;s rights and allowed equal legal rights to both legitimate and illegitimate children. Abortion and birth control were both legal in Yugoslavia, which led to a rapid decline in population growth in 1960s-1970s. Between 1948 and 1981, the population growth rate fell from 14.7% in 1947 to 7.4% in 1981. In particular, the Communist regime attacked what it considered to be sexist traditions in the Muslim communities, banning polygamy, women being veiled and the &quot;sale&quot; of girls who were married off to the man best able to afford the bride-price. An young Bosnian Muslim women stated: &quot;Things used to be very different. Girls were not free...Today a girl can chose whom she wants to be with and where she wants to go...When I cut off my braids and got a permanent wave there was a lot of disapproval and gossip. I was one of the first girls in the village to stop wearing &quot;dimija&quot; [harem pants] and put on a dress...And today almost every girl has modern cloths in addition to her &quot;dimija&quot;&quot;. The Partisan movement in the World War Two was very puritanical, which was carried on into the late 1940s and 1950s, but starting in the 1960s the regime embraced the values of the &quot;permissive society&quot; and the &quot;sexual revolution&quot;. In the 1960s, pornographic magazines were permitted and the Yugoslav newspapers devoted much coverage to gossip about the sex lives of celebrities, through not senior members of the League of Communists. Likewise, the regime sought to encourage women to work and by 1964 about 29% of all Yugoslav women were working. The female labor participation varied sharply from region to region. In Slovenia, 42% of all women were working in 1964 while in Kosovo region only 18% of women worked in 1964. Western music was allowed in Yugoslavia, and music by groups popular in the West such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones was frequently played on Yugoslav radio. Officially, Yugoslavia was neutral in the Cold War, but in a cultural sense, Yugoslavia belonged to the West as Western films, TV shows and music were all very popular in the 1960s. Because of the low value of the dinar, Western films were often shot in Yugoslavia in the 1960s. In the arts, a genre known as the &quot;black wave&quot; emerged in the 1960s that saw novels, plays and films that depicted modern Yugoslavia as corrupt and dehumanizing. Several &quot;black wave&quot; works such as the novel &quot;Dad su cvetale tikve&quot; (&quot;When Pumpkins Blossomed&quot;) by Dragolav Milailović about his imprisonment at the Goli Otok camp in the early 1950s were banned, but others such as the novel &quot;Memoari Pere Bogaljia&quot; (&quot;Memoirs of Pera the Cripple&quot;) by Slobadan Selenić which depicted the League of Communist members as vulgar, corrupt and self-serving were awarded first prize at the Belgrade literary festival.

In the early 1960s concern over problems such as the building of economically irrational &quot;political&quot; factories and inflation led a group within the Communist leadership to advocate greater decentralization. These liberals were opposed by a group around Aleksandar Ranković. Ranković as secret police chief was known as an advocate of an repressive line, especially against the Albanians of Kosovo, and tended to favor Serbs over the other peoples. In 1966 the liberals (the most important being Edvard Kardelj, Vladimir Bakarić of Croatia and Petar Stambolić of Serbia) gained the support of Tito. At a party meeting in Brijuni, Ranković faced a fully prepared dossier of accusations and a denunciation from Tito that he had formed a clique with the intention of taking power. That year (1966), more than 3,700 Yugoslavs fled to Trieste with the intention to seek political asylum in North America, United Kingdom or Australia. Ranković was forced to resign all party posts and some of his supporters were expelled from the party. Throughout the 1950s and &#x27;60s, the economic development and liberalization continued at a rapid pace. The introduction of further reforms introduced a variant of market socialism, which now entailed a policy of open borders. In 1965, most of the state controls on production, pricing and wages were ended and allowed small businesses to open, albeit with the proviso that no small enterprise could employ more than five people at a time. Many of the older Communist leaders were uncomfortable with the &quot;socialist market economy&quot; that was being created, and were forced by Tito to take early retirement. With heavy federal investment, tourism in SR Croatia was revived, expanded, and transformed into a major source of income. In particular, the 745-mile coastline of Dalmatia and Istria with its bright, sunny weather, beaches and more 1, 000 islands, and Italianate architecture became extremely popular with tourists in the 1960s. In 1965, three million foreign tourists visited Dalmatia and by 1970 4.75 million foreign tourists came to visit Dalmatia. Some of the other tourists came from Czechoslovakia and Hungary, but the majority came from Western Europe, especially from Italy, Austria and West Germany as the low value of the dinar made vacationing in Yugoslavia extremely cheap. By 1969, the federal government made $275 million US dollars from tourism, which comprised some 10% of all revenue. Dalmatia and Istria, which had once been poor regions, were almost overnight transformed into wealthy areas as about 30% of all people in Istria and Dalmatia were employed in the tourism industry by the end of the 1960s.

With these successful measures, the Yugoslav economy achieved relative self-sufficiency and traded extensively with both the West and the East. By the early 1960s, foreign observers noted that the country was &quot;booming&quot;, and that all the while the Yugoslav citizens enjoyed far greater liberties than the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc states. Literacy was increased dramatically and reached 91%, medical care was free on all levels, and life expectancy was 72 years. The German historian Marie-Janine Calic noted that the 1960s are remembered as the time of the &quot;economic miracle&quot; when living standards were rising for most Yugoslavs and the prosperity had &quot;a politically pacifying and socially integrating effect&quot;. Some of the republics become more wealthier than others. In 1965, Slovenia had an index value of 177.3% of Yugoslavia&#x27;s per capital income, followed by Croatia at 120.7%, and Serbia at 94.9% while Bosnia-Herzegovina had 69.1% and the poorest region being Kosovo at 38.6%. At least part of the reason for the regional differences was Tito&#x27;s policy until 1965 of keeping the prices of raw materials and agricultural goods artificially low, which hurt the poorer republics in the south as most people there were employed in either agriculture or mining while Slovenia and Croatia were more industrialised. To address the regional disparity, Tito created a regional development fund in 1965 intended to help the poorer republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Macedonia along with the Kosovo region of Serbia &quot;catch up&quot; with the richer republics to the north.

In 1965, the Bosnian Muslims were upgraded to a sixth nationality, defined somewhat paradoxically as an ethnic rather than a religious group, and the 1971 census for the first time included the category &quot;Muslim an ethnic sense&quot;. The recognition of Bosnian Muslims as an ethnicity allowed for greater Muslim involvement in the politics of Bosnia with the numbers of Muslims on the Bosnian Central Committee raising from 19% of the membership in 1965 to 33% in 1974. However, the recognition of Bosnian Muslims as an official nationality led to sharp disputes about whatever Bosnia-Herzegovina was the republic of the Muslims or if the Muslims were one of the three nations of Bosnia alongside the Serbs and the Croats. The Croats and the Serbs tended to favor the &quot;three nations&quot; theory of Bosnia while the Muslims argued that the Serbs and the Croats already had their own republics and Bosnia was the special homeland of the Serbo-Croatian speaking Muslims. On 2 June 1968, student demonstrations led to wider mass youth protests in capital cities across Yugoslavia. They were gradually stopped a week later by Tito on 9 June during his televised speech. The student demonstrations of 1968 were an important turning point in Yugoslav history as for the first street protests had forced a change in policy, and in the coming decades, successive leaders within the League of Communists were to mobilize street protests as a way of forcing change. In August 1968, Tito was opposed to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. The invasion of Czechoslovakia badly frightened Tito, whom believed that Yugoslavia would also soon be invaded by the Soviet Union. In 1968–1969, Tito embarked upon major military reforms with the aim of preparing for the expected Soviet invasion. Tito decided that the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army would stage a fighting retreat into the interior of the country and then revert over to guerrilla warfare, a doctrine Tito called &quot;all-people&#x27;s defense&quot;. As part of the planned guerrilla war, Tito sought to enroll as much of the population into the military as possible. The defense forces in 1969 were reorganized with 250, 000 professional soldiers of the People&#x27;s Army along with 250, 000 reservists forming the core of the military and the territorial defense forces of the six republics, which collectively made up another 900, 000 men to serve as a nucleus of a guerilla force. In the process, much of the population was armed and Tito in effect by creating the territorial defense forces on the republic level gave each republic its own army, which was later to play a major role in the break-up of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. In October–November 1968, a series of riots erupted in Yugoslav Macedonia and the Kosovo region by Albanians who demanded that the regions where Albanians were a majority be turned into a new republic. Some of the more radical Albanians called for the session of Kosovo and the Albanian regions of Macedonia to join Albania to form a greater Albania. Tito rejected the demand for a 7th republic with an Albanian majority, but did grant demands for greater Albanian participation in public life. In 1969, the University of Pristina was opened, becoming the first Albanian language university in Yugoslavia. Likewise, Tito allowed for a greater number of Albanians to be recruited into the League of Communists and into the government, which in turn caused complaints from the Serbs that the Albanians were dominating the political life of Kosovo at their expense.

In 1971 the leadership of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, notably Miko Tripalo and Savka Dabčević-Kučar, allied with nationalist non-party groups, began a movement to increase the powers of the individual federated republics. The movement was referred to as MASPOK, a portmanteau of meaning &quot;mass movement&quot;, and led to the Croatian Spring. Tito responded to the incident by purging the League of Communists of Croatia, while Yugoslav authorities arrested large numbers of the Croatian protesters. To avert ethnically driven protests in the future, Tito began to initiate some of the reforms demanded by the protesters. At this time, Ustaše-sympathizers outside Yugoslavia tried through terrorism and guerrilla actions to create a separatist momentum, but they were unsuccessful, sometimes even gaining the animosity of fellow Roman Catholic Croatian Yugoslavs. From 1971 on, the republics had control over their economic plans. This led to a wave of investment, which in turn was accompanied by a growing level of debt and a growing trend of imports not covered by exports. After the &quot;Croatian Spring&quot;, Tito turned towards a more repressive leadership style, bringing in a new law in 1973 that restricted media freedom. By 1975, Yugoslavia had 4, 000 political prisoners, a figure that was only exceeded in Europe by Albania and the Soviet Union. The journal &quot;Praxis&quot;, which was the main organ of criticism of the regime was shut down while a number of the &quot;Black Wave&quot; films were banned. The 1973-1974 oil shock badly hurt the Yugoslav economy as Yugoslavia had no oil of its own while the global recession sharply decreased the demand for raw materials and manufactured goods from Yugoslavia. To compensate, Yugoslavia went on a spree of borrowing money, creating an illusion of prosperity as the 1970s saw the greatest period of construction as thousands of new hotels, sports arenas, libraries, and streets were built that decade. The average annual economic rate after the 1973-1974 oil shock crisis was 8%, but the growth was largely fueled with money borrowed from the West. 

Many of the demands made in the Croatian Spring movement in 1971, such as giving more autonomy to the individual republics, became reality with the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution. While the constitution gave the republics more autonomy, it also awarded a similar status to two autonomous provinces within Serbia: Kosovo, a largely ethnic Albanian populated region, and Vojvodina, a region with Serb majority but large numbers of ethnic minorities, such as Hungarians. These reforms satisfied most of the republics, especially Croatia and the Albanians of Kosovo and the minorities of Vojvodina. But the 1974 constitution deeply aggravated Serbian Communist officials and Serbs themselves who distrusted the motives of the proponents of the reforms. Many Serbs saw the reforms as concessions to Croatian and Albanian nationalists, as no similar autonomous provinces were made to represent the large numbers of Serbs of Croatia or Bosnia and Herzegovina. Serb nationalists were frustrated over Tito&#x27;s support for the recognition of Montenegrins and Macedonians as independent nationalities, as Serbian nationalists had claimed that there was no ethnic or cultural difference separating these two nations from the Serbs that could verify that such nationalities truly existed. Tito maintained a busy, active travelling schedule despite his advancing age. His 85th birthday in May 1977 was marked by huge celebrations. That year, he visited Libya, the Soviet Union, North Korea and finally China, where the post-Mao leadership finally made peace with him after more than 20 years of denouncing the SFRY as &quot;revisionists in the pay of capitalism&quot;. This was followed by a tour of France, Portugal, and Algeria after which the president&#x27;s doctors advised him to rest. In August 1978, Chinese leader Hua Guofeng visited Belgrade, reciprocating Tito&#x27;s China trip the year before. This event was sharply criticized in the Soviet press, especially as Tito used it as an excuse to indirectly attack Moscow&#x27;s ally Cuba for &quot;promoting divisiveness in the Non-Aligned Movement&quot;. When China launched a military campaign against Vietnam the following February, Yugoslavia openly took Beijing&#x27;s side in the dispute. The effect was a rather adverse decline in Soviet Union-Yugoslavia relations. During this time, Yugoslavia&#x27;s first nuclear reactor was under construction in Krško, built by US-based Westinghouse. The project ultimately took until 1980 to complete because of disputes with the United States about certain guarantees that Belgrade had to sign off on before it could receive nuclear materials (which included the promise that they would not be sold to third parties or used for anything but peaceful purposes).

In 1979, seven selection criteria comprising Ohrid, Dubrovnik, Split, Plitvice Lakes National Park, Kotor, Stari Ras and Sopoćani were designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, making it the first inscription of cultural and natural landmarks in Yugoslavia.

=== Post-Tito period ===
Tito died on 4 May 1980 due to complications after surgery. While it had been known for some time that the 87-year-old president&#x27;s health had been failing, his death nonetheless came as a shock to the country. This was because Tito was looked upon as the country&#x27;s hero in World War II and had been the country&#x27;s dominant figure and identity for over three decades. His loss marked a significant alteration, and it was reported that many Yugoslavs openly mourned his death. In the Split soccer stadium, Serbs and Croats visited the coffin among other spontaneous outpourings of grief, and a funeral was organized by the League of Communists with hundreds of world leaders in attendance (See Tito&#x27;s state funeral). After Tito&#x27;s death in 1980, a new collective presidency of the Communist leadership from each republic was adopted. At the time of Tito&#x27;s death the Federal government was headed by Veselin Đuranović (who had held the post since 1977). He had come into conflict with the leaders of the republics, arguing that Yugoslavia needed to economize due to the growing problem of foreign debt. Đuranović argued that a devaluation was needed which Tito refused to countenance for reasons of national prestige.&lt;/ref&gt; Post-Tito Yugoslavia faced significant fiscal debt in the 1980s, but its good relations with the United States led to an American-led group of organizations called the &quot;Friends of Yugoslavia&quot; to endorse and achieve significant debt relief for Yugoslavia in 1983 and 1984, though economic problems would continue until the state&#x27;s dissolution in the 1990s. Yugoslavia was the host nation of the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. For Yugoslavia, the games demonstrated Tito&#x27;s continued vision of Brotherhood and Unity, as the multiple nationalities of Yugoslavia remained united in one team, and Yugoslavia became the second Communist state to hold the Olympic Games (the Soviet Union held them in 1980). However, Yugoslavia&#x27;s games had Western countries participating, while the Soviet Union&#x27;s Olympics were boycotted by some. In the late 1980s, the Yugoslav government began to deviate from communism as it attempted to transform to a market economy under the leadership of Prime Minister Ante Marković, who advocated shock therapy tactics to privatize sections of the Yugoslav economy. Marković was popular, as he was seen as the most capable politician to be able to transform the country to a liberalized democratic federation, though he later lost his popularity, mainly due to rising unemployment. His work was left incomplete as Yugoslavia broke apart in the 1990s.

=== Dissolution and war ===

Tensions between the republics and nations of Yugoslavia intensified from the 1970s to the 1980s. The causes for the collapse of the country have been associated with nationalism, ethnic conflict, economic difficulty, frustration with government bureaucracy, the influence of important figures in the country, and international politics. Ideology, and particularly nationalism, has been seen by many as the primary source of the break up of Yugoslavia. Since the 1970s, Yugoslavia&#x27;s Communist regime became severely splintered into a liberal-decentralist nationalist faction led by Croatia and Slovenia that supported a decentralized federation with greater local autonomy, versus a conservative-centralist nationalist faction led by Serbia that supported a centralized federation to secure the interests of Serbia and Serbs across Yugoslavia – as they were the largest ethnic group in the country as a whole. From 1967 to 1972 in Croatia and 1968 and 1981 protests in Kosovo, nationalist doctrines and actions caused ethnic tensions that destabilized the country. The suppression of nationalists by the state is believed to have had the effect of identifying nationalism as the primary alternative to communism itself and made it a strong underground movement.

In the early 1980s, protests became more open, leading to more political trials. In 1981, a group of Croat nationalists led by a former general, Franjo Tuđman, were convicted of separatism. Tuđman was convicted and sentenced to two years in prison for essentially telling a journalist in 1977 that the estimated death toll at the Jasenovac death camp had been exaggerated as a part to &quot;defame&quot; the Croat nation. In Sarajevo, a group of Muslim intellectuals led by Alija Izetbegović, were convicted in 1983 of promoting Islamism and given short prison sentences. In 1984, the police stormed a gathering of the Flying University (a series of lectures by prominent dissidents) in Belgrade to stop a lecture by Milovan Djilas. The trial of Djilas and the five others generated much sympathy for the defendants who argued for their right to free speech. The liberal Serbian intelligentsia rallied in favor of the defendants and later in 1984 the Committee for the Defense of Freedom of Thought and Expression was established which called for multi-party democracy, the end of censorship, and an independent judiciary. Alongside these manifestations of dissent was an increased nationalist tendency in the republics. In 1982, the journalist-novelist Vuk Drašković, published his historical novel, &quot;Nož&quot; (&quot;The Knife&quot;), which was banned for its depiction of Bosnian Muslims as the vicious killers of Serbs. in World War Two. Dobrica Ćosić, one of Serbia&#x27;s most popular writers, published several historical novels in the early 1980s, which depicted the Serbs as victims of the other peoples of Yugoslavia, which were reflections of a more nationalistic tendency in the Serb intelligentsia. In 1984, a prominent Bosnian Serb sociologist Vojislav Šešelj based in Sarajevo was convicted for his pamphlet &quot;Odgovori na anketu-intervju: Šta da se radi? &quot; (&quot;What is to be done?&quot;) were he called for reducing the number of republics from six to four, and in particular stated that Bosnia-Herzegovina had no right to exist as a republic.

Between 1976 and 1981, Yugoslavia took on foreign debts worth $21 billion US dollars. The early 1980s were a time of high interest rates, which made servicing these debts especially onerous for Yugoslavia. By 1984, the number of unemployed people reached one million with the burden falling especially hard on young people. The unemployment rate for people under the age of 24 in 1984 of 60% as many firms refused to hire anyone in order to protect the older workers. Starting in 1983, strikes began common all across Yugoslavia with the common compliant being that wages had failed to keep up with inflation. Yugoslavia was forced to turn to the IMF for a bail-out. In turn, the IMF charged that Yugoslavia was too decentralized and wanted the federal government to take over many of the economic powers that devolved down to the republics in the 1960s-1970s in order to better repay its debts. In particular, almost all of the powers of taxation rested with the republics along much of the power to regulate foreign trade and the power to impose internal tariffs on goods from other republics, a situation that the IMF considered to be unacceptable. The wealthier republics such as Slovenia and Croatia resisted the efforts of the federal government to take on more economic powers, arguing that the wealth of their republics belonged to them. All of the republics were supposed to turn over 10% of their annual income to a common development fund that was used for all of Yugoslavia; both Croatia and Slovenia stopped contributing to the fund under their grounds that the their wealth belonged to their republics, an action that sparked much anger in the poorer republics such as Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Macedonia. The Slovenes and Croats argued that too many infrastructure projects in the poorer republics were marred by mismanagement and corruption, and they did not wish to see their wealth &quot;squandered&quot; on the corruption of others. By contrast, people in the poorer republics, above all in Serbia, charged that the Slovenes and Croats were being selfish and greedy in refusing to extend a helping hand to the other republics. Adding to the mood of crisis was the revelations of widespread corruption, which discredited the League of Communists as not only incompetent, but also greedy and venal. The most infamous scandal was the 1987 collapse of the food company Agrokomerc based in Velika Kladŝa in Bosnia, which involved fraud running to the sum of hundreds of millions. The company&#x27;s director Fikret Abdić had engaged in a classic Ponzi scheme of raising capital by issuing promissory notes without coverage and found himself issuing more and more notes to pay off his earlier creditors. A number of leading politicians not only in Bosnia, but in the other republics were implicated in the Agrokomerc scandal as it emerged Abdić had many friends in high places.The economic crisis caused a mood of widespread fear and uncertainty. In a poll in 1985 revealed that 31% of Yugoslavs felt &quot;anxious&quot; and &quot;worried&quot; about their future; another 19% believed that the economic situation would only get worse; and 10% supported the idea of a &quot;strong man&quot; leader who would use &quot;strong hand&quot; methods to resolve the economic crisis. The metaphors used by people to describe the economic crisis suggested a mood of hopelessness and despair with people seeing themselves as the victims of forces beyond their own control such as &quot;the hell of inflation&quot;, the &quot;cancerous tumor&quot; of unemployment, and a &quot;biblical flood&quot; of misery and suffering about to overwhelm Yugoslavia. Much of the music sung by rock and punk bands in Yugoslavia with names such as Electric Orgasm, Videosex, The Lunatics, and 4R (an abbreviation for the Fourth Reich) featured nihilistic lyrics full of rage and despair with the common theme being that there was no hope for a better future for Yugoslavia, which in turn reflected the widespread mood of hopelessness amongst the youth people.

A major factor in Yugoslav life was the return to religiosity in a country that had very secular for decades. In a 1967 poll, a third of Yugoslavs had identified as religious and in a 1987 poll over half of Yugoslavs identified as religious. In Croatia, there was a notable increase in the number of people attending Catholic masses all through the 1970s and even more so in the 1980s alongside a tendency to identify Catholicism with Croat nationalism. In 1981, a group of Catholic Bosnian Croat children claimed to have seen a vision of the Virgin Mary in the Bosnian town of Medjugorje, a claim which was widely accepted despite being denounced by the Catholic bishop of Mostar as a fraud that served &quot;a spectacle for tourists&quot;. In the 1980s, Medjugorje became a popular Catholic pilgrimage center, attracting thousands of pilgrims every year, who made often made a point of claiming parts of or sometimes all of Bosnia-Herzegovina for Croatia. In Serbia, the Orthodox Church likewise became a major player in public life with a significant increase in the number of people attending church services in the 1980s. A major new theological faculty being founded in Belgrade in 1984 to handle the increased number of young men studying to be priest. In 1985 construction started on the huge cathedral of Saint Sava in Belgrade that was intended to serve as a symbol of the dominant role in Serbian life sought by the Orthodox Church as the cathedral of Saint Sava was meant to dominate the Belgrade skyline. Increasing, the Orthodox Church came to once again identify itself with Serbian nationalism in much the same way that the Catholic church was identified with Croat nationalism. Likewise, after decades of being secular, Islam started to play a more prominent role in the lives of Bosnian Muslims. In the years after World War Two, there hardly any mosques built in Bosnia, but between 1969 and 1980 there were 800 new mosques built in Bosnia. The governments of Saudi Arabia, Libya, and Iran had thousands of copies of the Koran translated into Serbo-Croatian to be handed out for free in Yugoslavia, funded the training of &quot;Ulama&quot; (Islamic clergy) at madrassas; and financed much of the building of new mosques. However, the type of Islam practiced by the &quot;ulama&quot; trained in the Middle East was a harsh, puritanical and strict version of Islam that was contrary to the easy-going, tolerant ethos of many Bosnian Muslims. In 1990, 69% of Bosnian Muslims stated that they did not attend regularly services at their mosque. The return to religiosity in the 1980s was largely a reaction to the economic crisis, which caused many people much stress, and discredited Communism as a system of belief.

In 1981, Vladimir Dedijer published a biography of Tito, &quot;Novi prilozi za biografiju Josipa Broza Tita&quot; which was somewhat critical as Dedijer portrayed Tito as a vain, narcissistic leader who lived in ostentatious luxury, and whose leadership style was more like that of a king than of a Communist leader. Dedijer&#x27;s book, while being overall positive in its assessment of Tito, caused a sensation as being the first book in Yugoslavia that ever said anything negative about Tito, which marked the beginning of the end of the Tito cult. An especially striking historical revisionist work was Veselin Đuretić&#x27;s 1985 book, &quot;Saveznici i Jugoslovenska ratna drama&quot; (&quot;The Allies and the Yugoslav War Drama&quot;), which for the first time ever presented the Chetniks in a favorable light, and portrayed the Partisans in a negative light. The standard line in Yugoslav histography up until 1985 was that the Partisans were the heroes of the war who liberated Yugoslavia from Nazi Germany while the Chetniks were collaborators and war criminals, which Đuretić reversed in his book by claiming that the Americans and the British had &quot;betrayed&quot; the Chetniks in 1943 by switching their support for the Partisans who did not represent Serbia&#x27;s interests. Đuretić even tried to rehabilitate the Nazi collaborator General Milan Nedić as a great Serbian patriot. &quot;Saveznici i Jugoslovenska ratna drama&quot; was promptly banned shortly being published in November 1985 and Đuretić expelled from the League of Communists, but his book was notable for being the first nationalistic history book published in Yugoslavia, and caused much controversy. A veritable sub-genre of literature and films had emerged in the 1980s concerned the Goli Otok camp, which in turn was used to present Tito as a tyrant who had imprisoned his fellow Communists in a barbaric concentration camp merely for the suspicion of being loyal to the Soviet Union. Some of the best known examples were the 1982 novel &quot;Tren 2&quot; by Antoniji Isaković and the 1985 film &quot;When Father was away on business&quot; by Emir Kusturica.

In the late 1980s, the Belgrade elite was faced with a strong opposition force of massive protests by Kosovo Serbs and Montenegrins as well as public demands for political reforms by the critical intelligentsia of Serbia and Slovenia. In economics, since the late 1970s a widening gap of economic resources between the developed and underdeveloped regions of Yugoslavia severely deteriorated the federation&#x27;s unity. The most developed republics, Croatia and Slovenia, rejected attempts to limit their autonomy as provided in the 1974 Constitution. Public opinion in Slovenia in 1987 saw better economic opportunity in independence from Yugoslavia than within it. There were also places that saw no economic benefit from being in Yugoslavia; for example, the autonomous province of Kosovo was poorly developed, and per capita GDP fell from 47 percent of the Yugoslav average in the immediate post-war period to 27 percent by the 1980s.

However, economic issues have not been demonstrated to be the sole determining factor in the break up, as Yugoslavia in this period was the most prosperous Communist state in Eastern Europe, and the country in fact disintegrated during a period of economic recovery after the implementation of the economic reforms of Ante Marković&#x27;s government. Furthermore, during the break up of Yugoslavia, the leaders of Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, all declined an unofficial offer by the European Community to provide substantial economic support to them in exchange for a political compromise. However, the issue of economic inequality between the republics, autonomous provinces, and nations of Yugoslavia resulted in tensions with claims of disadvantage and accusations of privileges against others by these groups. Political protests in Serbia and Slovenia, which later developed into ethnic-driven conflict, began in the late 1980s as protests against the alleged injustice and bureaucratization of the political elite. Members of the political elite managed to redirect these protests against &quot;others&quot;. Serb demonstrators were worried about the disintegration of the country and alleged that &quot;the others&quot; (Croats, Slovenes, and international institutions) were deemed responsible. The Slovene intellectual elite argued that &quot;the others&quot; (Serbs) were responsible for &quot;Greater Serbian expansionist designs&quot;, for economic exploitation of Slovenia, and for the suppression of Slovene national identity. These redirection actions of the popular protests allowed the authorities of Serbia and Slovenia to survive at the cost of undermining the unity of Yugoslavia. Other republics such as Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina and Croatia refused to follow these tactics taken by Serbia and Slovenia, later resulting in the defeat of the respective League of Communists of each republic to nationalist political forces. From the point of view of international politics, it has been argued that the end of the Cold War contributed to the break up of Yugoslavia because Yugoslavia lost its strategic international political importance as an intermediary between the Eastern and Western blocs. As a consequence, Yugoslavia lost the economic and political support provided by the West, and increased pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reform its institutions made it impossible for the Yugoslav reformist elite to respond to rising social disorder.

The collapse of communism throughout Eastern Europe in 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 undermined the country&#x27;s ideological basis and encouraged anti-communist and nationalist forces in the Western-oriented republics of Croatia and Slovenia to increase their demands. A major negative factor that held together Yugoslavia was the fear of the Soviet Union would take advantage of a civil war. With Soviet influence on the wane in Eastern Europe, the fear of the Soviet Union ceased to be a factor in Yugoslav politics by the late 1980s. Nationalist sentiment among ethnic Serbs rose dramatically following the ratification of the 1974 Constitution, which reduced the powers of SR Serbia over its autonomous provinces of SAP Kosovo and SAP Vojvodina. In Serbia, this caused increasing xenophobia against Albanians. In Kosovo (administered mostly by ethnic Albanian Communists), the Serbian minority increasingly put forth complaints of mistreatment and abuse by the Albanian majority. Feelings were further inflamed in 1986, when the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) published the SANU Memorandum. In it, Serbian writers and historians voiced &quot;various currents of Serb nationalist resentment.&quot; The SKJ was at the time united in condemning the memorandum, and continued to follow its anti-nationalist policy. In 1987, Serbian Communist official Slobodan Milošević was sent to bring calm to an ethnically driven protest by Serbs against the Albanian administration of SAP Kosovo. Milošević had been, up to this point, a hard-line Communist who had decried all forms of nationalism as treachery, such as condemning the SANU Memorandum as &quot;nothing else but the darkest nationalism&quot;. However, Kosovo&#x27;s autonomy had always been an unpopular policy in Serbia, and he took advantage of the situation and made a departure from traditional Communist neutrality on the issue of Kosovo. Milošević assured Serbs that their mistreatment by ethnic Albanians would be stopped. He then began a campaign against the ruling Communist elite of SR Serbia, demanding reductions in the autonomy of Kosovo and Vojvodina. These actions made him popular amongst Serbs and aided his rise to power in Serbia. Milošević and his allies took on an aggressive nationalist agenda of reviving SR Serbia within Yugoslavia, promising reforms and protection of all Serbs. Milošević proceeded to take control of the governments of Vojvodina, Kosovo, and the neighboring Socialist Republic of Montenegro in what was dubbed the &quot;Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution&quot; by the Serbian media. Both the SAPs possessed a vote on the Yugoslav Presidency in accordance to the 1974 constitution, and together with Montenegro and his own Serbia, Milošević now directly controlled four out of eight votes in the collective head-of-state by January 1990. This only caused further resentment among the governments of Croatia and Slovenia, along with the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo (SR Bosnia and Herzegovina and SR Macedonia remained relatively neutral).

Fed up by Milošević&#x27;s manipulation of the assembly, first the delegations of the League of Communists of Slovenia led by Milan Kučan, and later the League of Communists of Croatia, led by Ivica Račan, walked out during the extraordinary 14th Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (January 1990), effectively dissolving the all-Yugoslav party. Along with external pressure, this caused the adoption of multi-party systems in all of the republics at the start of 1990. When the individual republics organized their multi-party elections in 1990, the ex-Communists mostly failed to win re-election. In Croatia and Slovenia, nationalist parties won their respective elections. On 8 April 1990 the first multiparty elections in Slovenia (and Yugoslavia) since the Second World War were held. Demos coalition won the elections and formed a government which started to implement electoral reform programs. In Croatia, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) won the election promising to &quot;defend Croatia from Milošević&quot; which caused alarm among Croatia&#x27;s large Serbian minority. Franjo Tudjman had in close contact with right-wing Croat émigré groups in the United States and Canada since 1987, who donated very generously to his 1990 campaign in return for him adopting their ideology as his own. Croatian Serbs, for their part, were wary of HDZ leader Franjo Tuđman&#x27;s nationalist government and in 1990, Serb nationalists in the southern Croatian town of Knin organized and formed a separatist entity known as the SAO Krajina, which demanded to remain in union with the rest of the Serb populations if Croatia decided to secede. The government of Serbia endorsed the Croatian Serbs&#x27; rebellion, claiming that for Serbs, rule under Tuđman&#x27;s government would be equivalent to the World War II fascist Independent State of Croatia (NDH) which committed genocide against Serbs during World War II. Milošević used this to rally Serbs against the Croatian government and Serbian newspapers joined in the warmongering. Serbia had by now printed $1.8 billion worth of new money without any backing of the Yugoslav central bank.

A sign of social decay in late 1980s-early 1990s Yugoslavia was the rise of a violent football hooligan subculture known as &quot;dizelaši&quot; (after the Diesel clothing brand) who militantly supported their favorite football clubs, and often rioted when their club played against a club from another republic. One journalist wrote about the &quot;dizelaši&quot;: &quot;The guys who belong to this, let&#x27;s say &#x27;movement&#x27; wear streetwear from the clothing brands Diesel and Nike, usually track pants. They are bald and look like bodybuilders. And it is very popular to run around packing heat [carry a gun]...The women fulfill the other half of the heterosexual code: sexiness, short skirts, bare midriff&quot;. The &quot;dizelaši&quot; were very nationalistic and waved about posters of their favorite saints and politicians at football games and depending upon what republic they were from sang Chetnik songs or gave the Ustasha fascist salute. When not engaging in drug-fueled and alcohol-fueled mayhem at football games, the &quot;dizelaši&quot; worked as enforcers for organized crime groups. The most infamous of the &quot;dizelaši&quot; was the gangster Zeljko Raznatovic, better known as Arkan, who served as the president of the fan club for Red Star Belgrade football team. On 13 May 1990, there was especially violent rioting at a football game played between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade teams as rival &quot;dizelaši&quot; fought each other. The German historian Marie-Jannine Calic noted that most of the volunteers for the various paramilitary groups on all sides who committed the worse atrocities in the early 1990s came from the &quot;dizelaši&quot; sub-culture.

Alongside the aggression displayed by football hooligans was a veritable war of words between Croat and Serb historians over the precise number of people who had killed at the Jasenovac death camp between 1941 and 1945 with Croat historians pushing for lower figures while Serb historians pushed for higher figures. The future president of Croatia, Franjo Tudjman, in a 1989 essay entitled &quot;Fallacies of Historical Realities&quot; greatly downplayed the number of people killed at Jasenovac; claimed that overall only 60, 000 people had been killed by the Ustaše; and further maintained that most of the guards at Jasenovac were Jews, writing &quot;A Jew is a Jew...egoism, cleverness, unreliability, greed, treachery and acting as an informant&quot; were what he considered to be typical Jewish traits. In a 1990 essay, Tudjan stated &quot;the NDH was also the expression of the historical drive of the Croat people for an independent state&quot;, a statement which seemed to imply that the genocide committed by the Ustasha was less important compared to creating a Croat state. On the other side, the Serb historian Vasilije Krestić wrote in his essay &quot;On the Genesis of Genocide of Serbs in the NDH&quot; that genocidal thinking was an integral aspect of Croat national character while another Serb historian Radomir Bulatović claimed in a 1990 essay that 1.1 million people had been killed at Jasenovac. Calic wrote that both the Serb and Croat historians were wrong as the generally accepted figure is that 83, 000 people were killed at Jasenovac and another 120, 000 people were killed elsewhere by the Ustaše. These disputes were the subject of immense media coverage as Yugoslavs became obsessed with their history, especially the history of the Second World War, in the late 1980s-early 1990s. Calic wrote that the main theme of the politics of &quot;victimology&quot; as each ethnic group sought to portray itself as exclusively victims. In Croatia, to counter the memory of Jasenovac-which for Serbs had become an iconic symbol of Serb victimization at the hands of the Ustaše-the Croats came to focus upon the Bleiburg massacre of 1945 as a symbol of not only Croat victimization at the hands of the Communists, but specifically of Serb Communists. The Bleiburg massacre was very misleadingly presented as an act of genocide against Croats, which ignored the fact that many of the executioners were Croat Communists serving in the Partisans and those executed were killed for their politics rather than their ethnicity and religion. Calic argued against the popular image in the West of peoples of Yugoslavia of being locked into savage ancient hatreds with the implication that the break-up of Yugoslavia and the resulting wars were merely &quot;normal&quot; behavior for these people, but rather argued that politicians, journalists, writers, and historians had quite consciously chose to present a version of history that presented one&#x27;s own ethnic group as uniquely pure and moral alongside a narrative of endless victimization at the hands of the other ethnic groups. In Serbia, Milošević played up the theme of Serbs as a &quot;heavenly people&quot; who had been persecuted by the Albanians and Bosnian Muslims during the Ottoman era, followed up by the Croats in the Second World War, as a source of political legitimacy as he portrayed himself as the defender of the Serbs. In Croatia, Tudjman presented a similar theme as he presented the story of Croatia as one of endless victimization at the hands of the Serbs. In Bosnia, Alija Izebegoviċ, who had emerged as the most important Bosnian Muslim politician by 1990 likewise presented the story of Bosnian Muslims as one of victimization at the hands of the Croats and Serbs.

In the Slovenian independence referendum, held on 23 December 1990, a vast majority of residents voted for independence. 88.5% of all electors (94.8% of those participating) voted for independence – which was declared on 25 June 1991. Both Slovenia and Croatia declared their independence on 25 June 1991. On the morning of 26 June, units of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army&#x27;s 13th Corps left their barracks in Rijeka, Croatia, to move towards Slovenia&#x27;s borders with Italy. The move immediately led to a strong reaction from local Slovenians, who organized spontaneous barricades and demonstrations against the YPA&#x27;s actions. There was, as yet, no fighting, and both sides appeared to have an unofficial policy of not being the first to open fire. By this time, the Slovenian government had already put into action its plan to seize control of both the international Ljubljana Airport and the Slovenia&#x27;s border posts on borders with Italy, Austria and Hungary. The personnel manning the border posts were, in most cases, already Slovenians, so the Slovenian take-over mostly simply amounted to changing of uniforms and insignia, without any fighting. By taking control of the borders, the Slovenians were able to establish defensive positions against an expected YPA attack. This meant that the YPA would have to fire the first shot. It was fired on 27 June at 14:30 in Divača by an officer of YPA. The conflict spread into the Ten-Day War, with many soldiers wounded and killed, in which the YPA was ineffective. Many unmotivated soldiers of Slovenian, Croatian, Bosnian or Macedonian nationality deserted or quietly rebelled against some (Serbian) officers who wanted to intensify the conflict. It also marked the end of the YPA, which was until then composed by members of all Yugoslav nations. After that, the YPA consisted mainly of men of Serbian nationality.

On 7 July 1991, whilst supportive of their respective rights to national self-determination, the European Community pressured Slovenia and Croatia to place a three-month moratorium on their independence with the Brijuni Agreement (recognized by representatives of all republics). During these three months, the Yugoslav Army completed its pull-out from Slovenia. Negotiations to restore the Yugoslav federation with diplomat Lord Peter Carington and members of the European Community were all but ended. Carington&#x27;s plan realized that Yugoslavia was in a state of dissolution and decided that each republic must accept the inevitable independence of the others, along with a promise to Serbian President Milošević that the European Community would ensure that Serbs outside of Serbia would be protected. Milošević refused to agree to the plan, as he claimed that the European Community had no right to dissolve Yugoslavia and that the plan was not in the interests of Serbs as it would divide the Serb people into four republics (Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, and Croatia). Carington responded by putting the issue to a vote in which all the other republics, including Montenegro under Momir Bulatović, initially agreed to the plan that would dissolve Yugoslavia. However, after intense pressure from Serbia on Montenegro&#x27;s president, Montenegro changed its position to oppose the dissolution of Yugoslavia. 
With the Plitvice Lakes incident of late March/early April 1991, the Croatian War of Independence broke out between the Croatian government and the rebel ethnic Serbs of the SAO Krajina (heavily backed by the by-now Serb-controlled Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army). On 1 April 1991, the SAO Krajina declared that it would secede from Croatia. Immediately after Croatia&#x27;s declaration of independence, Croatian Serbs also formed the SAO Western Slavonia and the SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia. These three regions would combine into the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) on 19 December 1991. The influence of xenophobia and ethnic hatred in the collapse of Yugoslavia became clear during the war in Croatia. Propaganda by Croatian and Serbian sides spread fear, claiming that the other side would engage in oppression against them and would exaggerate death tolls to increase support from their populations. In the beginning months of the war, the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army and navy deliberately shelled civilian areas of Split and Dubrovnik, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as nearby Croat villages. Yugoslav media claimed that the actions were done due to what they claimed was a presence of fascist Ustaše forces and international terrorists in the city. UN investigations found that no such forces were in Dubrovnik at the time. Croatian military presence increased later on. Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Đukanović, at the time an ally of Milošević, appealed to Montenegrin nationalism, promising that the capture of Dubrovnik would allow the expansion of Montenegro into the city which he claimed was historically part of Montenegro, and denounced the present borders of Montenegro as being &quot;drawn by the old and poorly educated Bolshevik cartographers&quot;.

At the same time, the Serbian government contradicted its Montenegrin allies through claims by the Serbian Prime Minister Dragutin Zelenović, who contended that Dubrovnik was historically Serbian, not Montenegrin. The international media gave immense attention to the bombardment of Dubrovnik and claimed this was evidence of Milošević pursuing the creation of a Greater Serbia as Yugoslavia collapsed, presumably with the aid of the subordinate Montenegrin leadership of Bulatović and Serb nationalists in Montenegro to foster Montenegrin support for the retaking of Dubrovnik. In Vukovar, ethnic tensions between Croats and Serbs exploded into violence when the Yugoslav army entered the town in November 1991. The Yugoslav army and Serbian paramilitaries devastated the town in urban warfare and the destruction of Croatian property. Serb paramilitaries committed atrocities against Croats, killing over 200, and displacing others to add to those who fled the town in the Vukovar massacre. With Bosnia&#x27;s demographic structure comprising a mixed population of Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats, the ownership of large areas of Bosnia was in dispute. From 1991 to 1992, the situation in the multi-ethnic Bosnia and Herzegovina grew tense. Its parliament was fragmented on ethnic lines into a plurality Bosniak faction and minority Serb and Croat factions. In 1991, the controversial nationalist leader Radovan Karadžić of the largest Serb faction in the parliament, the Serb Democratic Party, gave a grave and direct warning to the Bosnian parliament should it decide to separate, saying: 

In the meantime, behind the scenes, negotiations began between Milošević and Tuđman to divide Bosnia and Herzegovina into Serb and Croat administered territories to attempt to avert war between Bosnian Croats and Serbs. Bosnian Serbs held the November 1991 referendum which resulted in an overwhelming vote in favor of staying in a common state with Serbia and Montenegro. In public, pro-state media in Serbia claimed to Bosnians that Bosnia and Herzegovina could be included a new voluntary union within a new Yugoslavia based on democratic government, but this was not taken seriously by Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s government. On 9 January 1992, the Bosnian Serb assembly proclaimed a separate Republic of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the soon-to-be Republika Srpska), and proceeded to form Serbian autonomous regions (SARs) throughout the state. The Serbian referendum on remaining in Yugoslavia and the creation of Serbian autonomous regions (SARs) were proclaimed unconstitutional by the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The independence referendum sponsored by the Bosnian government was held on 29 February and 1 March 1992. That referendum was in turn declared contrary to the Bosnian and federal constitution by the Federal Constitution Court and the newly established Bosnian Serb government; it was also largely boycotted by the Bosnian Serbs. According to the official results, the turnout was 63.4%, and 99.7% of the voters voted for independence. It was unclear what the two-thirds majority requirement actually meant and whether it was satisfied. Following the separation of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 27 April 1992, the SFR Yugoslavia had, de facto, dissolved into five successor states: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Slovenia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (later renamed &quot;Serbia and Montenegro&quot;). The Badinter Commission later (1991–1993) noted that Yugoslavia disintegrated into several independent states, so it is not possible to talk about the secession of Slovenia and Croatia from Yugoslavia.

=== Post-1992 UN membership ===

In September 1992, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (consisting of Serbia and Montenegro) failed to achieve &quot;de jure&quot; recognition as the continuation of the Socialist Federal Republic in the United Nations. It was separately recognised as a successor alongside Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia. Before 2000, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia declined to re-apply for membership in the United Nations and the United Nations Secretariat allowed the mission from the SFRY to continue to operate and accredited representatives of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to the SFRY mission, continuing work in various United Nations organs. It was only after the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević, that the government of FR Yugoslavia applied for UN membership in 2000.

== Governance ==
=== Constitution ===

The Yugoslav Constitution was adopted in 1946 and amended in 1953, 1963, and 1974. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia won the first elections, and remained in power throughout the state&#x27;s existence. It was composed of individual Communist parties from each constituent republic. The party would reform its political positions through party congresses in which delegates from each republic were represented and voted on changes to party policy, the last of which was held in 1990. Yugoslavia&#x27;s parliament was known as the Federal Assembly which was housed in the building which currently houses Serbia&#x27;s parliament. The Federal Assembly was composed entirely of Communist members. The primary political leader of the state was Josip Broz Tito, but there were several other important politicians, particularly after Tito&#x27;s death.

In 1974, Tito was elected President-for-life of Yugoslavia. After Tito&#x27;s death in 1980, the single position of president was divided into a collective Presidency, where representatives of each republic would essentially form a committee where the concerns of each republic would be addressed and from it, collective federal policy goals and objectives would be implemented. The head of the collective presidency was rotated between representatives of the republics. The collective presidency was considered the head of state of Yugoslavia. The collective presidency was ended in 1991, as Yugoslavia fell apart. In 1974, major reforms to Yugoslavia&#x27;s constitution occurred. Among the changes was the controversial internal division of Serbia, which created two autonomous provinces within it, Vojvodina and Kosovo. Each of these autonomous provinces had voting power equal to that of the republics, and were represented in the Serbian assembly.

=== Women&#x27;s rights policy ===
The 1946 Yugoslav Constitution aimed to unify family law throughout Yugoslavia and to overcome discriminatory provisions, particularly concerning economic rights, inheritance, child custody and the birth of &#x27;illegitimate&#x27; children. Article 24 of the Constitution affirmed the equality of women in society, stating that: &quot;Women have equal rights with men in all areas of state, economic and socio-political life.&quot;

At the end of the 1940s, the Women&#x27;s Antifascist Front of Yugoslavia (AFŽ), an organization founded during the Resistance to involve women in politics, was tasked with implementing a socialist policy for the emancipation of women, targeting in particular the most backward rural areas. AFŽ activists were immediately confronted with the gap between officially proclaimed rights and women&#x27;s daily lives. The reports drawn up by local AFŽ sections in the late 1940s and 1950s testify to the extent of patriarchal domination, physical exploitation and poor access to education faced by the majority of women, particularly in the countryside.

AFŽ also led a campaign against the full veil, which covered the whole body and face, until it was banned in the 1950s.

By the 1970s, thirty years after women&#x27;s rights were enshrined in the Yugoslav Constitution, the country had undergone a rapid process of modernisation and urbanisation. Women&#x27;s literacy and access to the labour market had reached unprecedented levels, and inequalities in women&#x27;s rights had been considerably reduced compared to the inter-war period. Yet full equality was far from being achieved.

=== Federal units ===

Internally, the Yugoslav federation was divided into six constituent states. Their formation was initiated during the war years, and finalized in 1944–1946. They were initially designated as &quot;federated states&quot;, but after the adoption of the first federal Constitution, on 31 January 1946, they were officially named &quot;people&#x27;s republics&quot; (1946–1963), and later &quot;socialist republics&quot; (from 1963 forward). They were constitutionally defined as mutually equal in rights and duties within the federation. Initially, there were initiatives to create several autonomous units within some federal units, but that was enforced only in Serbia, where two autonomous units (Vojvodina and Kosovo) were created (1945).

In alphabetical order, the republics and provinces were:

===Foreign policy===
Under Tito, Yugoslavia adopted a policy of nonalignment in the Cold War. It developed close relations with developing countries by having a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement, as well as maintaining cordial relations with the United States and Western European countries. Stalin considered Tito a traitor and openly offered condemnation towards him. Yugoslavia provided major assistance to anti-colonialist movements in the Third World. The Yugoslav delegation was the first to bring the demands of the Algerian National Liberation Front to the United Nations. In January 1958, the French Navy boarded the &quot;Slovenija&quot; cargo ship off Oran, whose holds were filled with weapons for the insurgents. Diplomat Danilo Milic explained that &quot;Tito and the leading nucleus of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia really saw in the Third World&#x27;s liberation struggles a replica of their own struggle against the fascist occupants. They vibrated to the rhythm of the advances or setbacks of the FLN or Vietcong.&quot; Thousands of Yugoslav military advisors travelled to Guinea after its decolonisation and as the French government tried to destabilise the country. Tito also covertly helped left-wing nationalist movements to destabilize the Portuguese colonial empire. Tito saw the murder of Patrice Lumumba by Belgian-backed Katangan separatists in 1961 as the &quot;greatest crime in contemporary history&quot;. Yugoslavia&#x27;s military academies trained left-wing activists from both Swapo (modern Namibia) and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania as part of Tito&#x27;s efforts to destabilize South Africa under apartheid. In 1980, the intelligence services of South Africa and Argentina plotted to return the favor by covertly bringing 1,500 anti-communist urban guerrillas to Yugoslavia. The operation was aimed at overthrowing Tito and was planned during the Olympic Games period so that the Soviets would be too busy to react. The operation was finally abandoned due to Tito&#x27;s death and the Yugoslav armed forces raising their alert level.

After World War II, Yugoslavia became a leader in international tourism among socialist states, motivated by both ideological and financial purposes. In the 1960s, many foreigners were able to get a visa on arrival and, later onward, were issued a tourist card for short stays. Numerous reciprocal agreements for abolishing visas were implemented with other countries (mainly Western European), through the decade. For the International Year of Tourism in 1967 Yugoslavia suspended visa requirements for all countries it had diplomatic relations with. In the same year, Tito became active in promoting a peaceful resolution of the Arab–Israeli conflict. His plan called for Arab countries to recognize the State of Israel in exchange for Israel returning territories it had gained. The Arab countries rejected his land for peace concept. However, that same year, Yugoslavia no longer recognized Israel.

In 1968, following the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, Tito added an additional defense line to Yugoslavia&#x27;s borders with the Warsaw Pact countries. Later in 1968, Tito then offered Czechoslovak leader Alexander Dubček that he would fly to Prague on three hours notice if Dubček needed help in facing down the Soviet Union which was occupying Czechoslovakia at the time.

Yugoslavia had mixed relations towards Enver Hoxha&#x27;s Albania. Initially Yugoslav-Albanian relations were forthcoming, as Albania adopted a common market with Yugoslavia and required the teaching of Serbo-Croatian to students in high schools. At this time, the concept of creating a Balkan Federation was being discussed between Yugoslavia, Albania and Bulgaria. Albania at this time was heavily dependent on economic support of Yugoslavia to fund its initially weak infrastructure. Trouble between Yugoslavia and Albania began when Albanians began to complain that Yugoslavia was paying too little for Albania&#x27;s natural resources. Afterward, relations between Yugoslavia and Albania worsened. From 1948 onward, the Soviet Union backed Albania in opposition to Yugoslavia. On the issue of Albanian-populated Kosovo, Yugoslavia and Albania both attempted to neutralize the threat of nationalist conflict, Hoxha opposed Albanian nationalism, as he officially believed in the world communist ideal of international brotherhood of all people, though on a few occasions in the 1980s he made inflammatory speeches in support of Albanians in Kosovo against the Yugoslav government, when public sentiment in Albania was firmly in support of Kosovo&#x27;s Albanians.

=== Military ===
The armed forces of SFR Yugoslavia consisted of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (&quot;Jugoslovenska narodna armija&quot;, JNA), Territorial Defense (TO), Civil Defense (CZ) and &quot;Milicija&quot; (police) in wartime. Socialist Yugoslavia maintained a strong military force. The JNA was the main organization of the military forces, and was composed of the ground army, navy and aviation. Militarily, Yugoslavia had a policy of self-sufficiency. Due to its policy of neutrality and non-alignment, efforts were made to develop the country&#x27;s military industry to provide the military with all its needs, and even for export. Most of its military equipment and pieces were domestically produced, while some was imported both from the East and the West. The regular army mostly originated from the Yugoslav Partisans of World War II.

Yugoslavia had a thriving arms industry and exported to nations, primarily those who were non-aligned as well as others like Iraq, and Ethiopia. Yugoslav companies like Zastava Arms produced Soviet-designed weaponry under license as well as creating weaponry from scratch, ranging from police pistols to airplanes. SOKO was an example of a successful military aircraft design by Yugoslavia before the Yugoslav wars. Beside the federal army, each of the republics had their own respective Territorial Defense Forces. They were a national guard of sorts, established in the frame of a new military doctrine called &quot;General Popular Defense&quot; as an answer to the brutal end of the Prague Spring by the Warsaw Pact in Czechoslovakia in 1968. It was organized on republic, autonomous province, municipality and local community levels. Given that its role was mainly defense, it had no formal officer training regime, no offensive capabilities and little military training. As Yugoslavia splintered, the army factionalized along ethnic lines, and by 1991–92 Serbs made up almost the entire army as the separating states formed their own.

== Economy ==

Despite their common origins, the socialist economy of Yugoslavia was much different from the economy of the Soviet Union and the economies of the Eastern Bloc, especially after the Yugoslav–Soviet break-up of 1948. Though they were state-owned enterprises, Yugoslav companies were nominally collectively managed by the employees themselves through workers&#x27; self-management, albeit with state oversight dictating wage bills and the hiring and firing of managers. The occupation and liberation struggle in World War II left Yugoslavia&#x27;s infrastructure devastated. Even the most developed parts of the country were largely rural, and the little industry the country had was largely damaged or destroyed. Unemployment was a chronic problem for Yugoslavia: the unemployment rates were amongst the highest in Europe during its existence and they did not reach critical levels before the 1980s only due to the safety valve provided by sending one million guest workers yearly to advanced industrialized countries in Western Europe. The departure of Yugoslavs seeking work began in the 1950s, when individuals began slipping across the border illegally. In the mid-1960s, Yugoslavia lifted emigration restrictions and the number of emigrants increased rapidly, especially to West Germany. By the early 1970s, 20% of the country&#x27;s labor force or 1.1 million workers were employed abroad. This was also a source of capital and foreign currency for Yugoslavia.

Due to Yugoslavia&#x27;s neutrality and its leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement, Yugoslav companies exported to both Western and Eastern markets. Yugoslav companies carried out construction of numerous major infrastructural and industrial projects in Africa, Europe and Asia. In the 1970s, the economy was reorganized according to Edvard Kardelj&#x27;s theory of associated labor, in which the right to decision-making and a share in profits of worker-run cooperatives is based on the investment of labour. All companies were transformed into &quot;organizations of associated labor&quot;. The smallest, &quot;basic organizations of associated labor&quot;, roughly corresponded to a small company or a department in a large company. These were organized into &quot;enterprises&quot; which in turn associated into &quot;composite organizations of associated labor&quot;, which could be large companies or even whole-industry branches in a certain area. Most executive decision-making was based in enterprises, so that these continued to compete to an extent, even when they were part of a same composite organization.

In practice, the appointment of managers and the strategic policies of composite organizations were, depending on their size and importance, often subject to political and personal influence-peddling. In order to give all employees, the same access to decision-making, the &quot;basic organisations of associated labor&quot; were also applied to public services, including health and education. The basic organizations were usually made up of no more than a few dozen people and had their own workers&#x27; councils, whose assent was needed for strategic decisions and appointment of managers in enterprises or public institutions.

The results of these reforms however were not satisfactory. There have been rampant wage-price inflations, substantial rundown of capital plant and consumer shortages, while the income gap between the poorer Southern and the relatively affluent Northern regions of the country remained. The self-management system stimulated the inflationary economy that was needed to support it. Large state-owned enterprises operated as monopolists with unrestricted access to capital that was shared according to political criteria. The oil crisis of 1973 magnified the economic problems, which the government tried to solve with extensive foreign borrowing. Although such actions resulted in a reasonable rate of growth for a few years (GNP grew at 5.1% yearly), such growth was unsustainable since the rate of foreign borrowing grew at an annual rate of 20%.

After the relatively prosperous 1970s, living conditions deteriorated in Yugoslavia in the 1980s, and were reflected in soaring unemployment rates and inflation. In the late 1980s, the unemployment rate in Yugoslavia was over 17%, with another 20% underemployed; with 60% of the unemployed under the age of 25. Real net personal income declined by 19.5%. The nominal GDP per capita of Yugoslavia at current prices in US dollars was at $3,549 in 1990. The central government tried to reform the self-management system and create an open market economy with considerable state ownership of major industrial factories, but strikes in major plants and hyperinflation held back progress.

The Yugoslav wars and consequent loss of market, as well as mismanagement and/or non-transparent privatization, brought further economic trouble for all the former republics of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.

The Yugoslav currency was the Yugoslav dinar.

Various economic indicators around 1990 were:

== Transportation ==
=== Air transport ===

In the interwar period, air transport in Yugoslavia was organised by the privately owned Aeroput company, but its post-war operations were suspended due to nationalization and near-total fleet destruction during the war. The first plan for the post-war public air transport reconstruction was introduced by the Commission for the Economic Reconstruction on 28 December 1944. The plan envisaged a national network which would include Belgrade, Zagreb, Ljubljana, Sarajevo, Titograd, Skopje, Novi Sad, Kraljevo, Niš, Borovo, Rijeka, Zadar, Split, Dubrovnik, Banja Luka, Mostar, Maribor and Trieste.

Initial charter public flights were organised by military planes, while the first regular international line after the war was introduced on 6 October 1945 between Belgrade and Prague. The initial public fleet consisted of four old German planes (Junkers Ju 52) and four Tukans purchased in France in 1945–46. In August 1945 Yugoslavia received 11 Soviet Lisunov Li-2 planes, but their usage was quickly discontinued in international transport, and partially discontinued in domestic transport, due to concerns over inadequate safety. Yugoslavia therefore initiated purchase of 10 American excess and therefore cheap C-47 planes in 1946. However, as Yugoslavia at the time was still a close Soviet ally, the US rejected the proposal pushing Yugoslavia to purchase three Douglas DC-3s in Belgium which would be the basic type of planes in Yugoslav public fleet all up until 1960s. The Yugoslav national public air transport company JAT Airways was established in April 1947.

While being a Communist country, after the Tito–Stalin split Yugoslavia initiated a period of military neutrality and non-alignment. Its airlines were supplied by both the East and the West. JAT Yugoslav Airlines became the flag carrier by absorbing the previous company Aeroput. During its existence it grew to become one of the leading airlines in Europe both by fleet and destinations. Its fleet included most of the Western-built aircraft, and destinations included five continents. By the 1970s more airlines were created, namely Aviogenex, Adria Airways and Pan Adria Airways, mostly focused in the growing tourist industry. The capital Belgrade Airport became the regional hub offering flights, either by the national airline JAT, or by other airlines, to all important destinations worldwide. Aside from Belgrade, most international flights would include a stop in Zagreb Airport, the second national airport in terms of passenger and cargo capacity; the two became the sole international hubs. All secondary airports such as the ones in Sarajevo, Skopje, Split or Ljubljana were directly linked to international flights through either Belgrade or Zagreb, while a number of tourism-oriented destinations were developed, such as Dubrovnik, Rijeka, Ohrid, Tivat and others.

=== Railways ===

The railway system in Yugoslavia was operated by the Yugoslav Railways. Much of the infrastructure was inherited from the pre-WWII period, and the SFRY period was marked by the extension and electrification of the rails. Electric and diesel locomotives were introduced in number from the 1960s onwards. Much of the early rolling stock were European produced, while with time were being replaced with domestically built locomotives, mostly from Rade Končar and carriages, mostly from GOŠA. The main two projects during SFRY period were electrification of the Zagreb–Belgrade railway, and the building of the highly challenging Belgrade–Bar railway. Yugoslav railways operated a number of international services, such as the Orient Express.

=== Roads ===
The core of the road network in Yugoslavia was the Brotherhood and Unity Highway which was a highway that stretched over , from the Austrian border at Rateče near Kranjska Gora in the northwest via Ljubljana, Zagreb, Belgrade and Skopje to Gevgelija on the Greek border in the southeast. It was the main modern highway in the country, connecting four constituent republics. It was the pioneer highway in Central-Eastern Europe, and the main link between Central and Western Europe with South-Eastern Europe and Middle East. Construction began on the initiative of President Tito. The first section between Zagreb and Belgrade was built with the effort of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army and volunteer Youth Work Actions and was opened in 1950. The section between Ljubljana and Zagreb was built by 54,000 volunteers in less than eight months in 1958.

=== Maritime and river transportation ===
With its extensive coast in the Adriatic Sea, Yugoslavia included several large ports such as Split, Rijeka, Zadar or Pula. Ferries providing passenger service were established linking Yugoslav ports with several ports in Italy and Greece. Regarding rivers, the Danube was navigable throughout its entire course in Yugoslavia, linking the ports of Belgrade, Novi Sad, and Vukovar with Central Europe and the Black sea. Long stretches of rivers Sava, Drava and Tisza were also navigable.

=== Urban ===
Accompanying the high urban growth, urban transportation in Yugoslavia was significantly developed in all republic capitals and major cities. Urban bus networks existed in all cities, while many also included trolleybuses and trams. Despite having been planned for decades, Belgrade Metro never materialised, and Belgrade became the only major capital in Europe not to have metro. Instead, Belgrade city authorities opted for the development of urban rail transport, Beovoz, and an extensive tram, bus and trolley network.
Besides capital Belgrade, other cities developed tram networks as well. The urban rail transport infrastructure in Yugoslavia consisted of:
*Bosnia and Herzegovina:
**Trams in Sarajevo
*Croatia:
**Zagreb tram system
**Osijek tram system
**Dubrovnik tram system up to 1970
**Rijeka tram system up to 1952
*Serbia:
**Belgrade tram system
**Niš tram system up to 1958
**Novi Sad tram system up to 1958
**Subotica tram system up to 1974
*Slovenia:
**Ljubljana tram system up to 1958
**Piran tram system up to 1953

In the Kingdom of Italy, there were also the Opatija tram and trams in Pula in Istria province, after 1947 (&quot;de facto&quot; 1945) ceded to Yugoslavia.

== Communications ==
=== Radio and television ===

One of the founding members of the European Broadcasting Union, Yugoslav Radio Television, known as JRT, was the national public broadcasting system in Yugoslavia. It consisted of eight subnational radio and television broadcast centers with each one headquartered in one of the six constituent republics and two autonomous provinces. Each television center created its own programming independently, and some of them operated several channels. This subnational broadcasting centers became public broadcasters of the newly independent states, with altered names, after the break-up of Yugoslavia. Zagreb Radio started broadcasting on 15 May 1926, and was the first public broadcasting facility in Southeast Europe. On the 30th anniversary of the establishment of Zagreb Radio station, on 15 May 1956, the first television programme was broadcast. This was the first TV station in Yugoslavia and would later become a color station in 1972. RT Belgrade and RT Ljubljana started broadcasting its television programmes two years later, in 1958.

== Geography ==
Like the Kingdom of Yugoslavia that preceded it, the SFRY bordered Italy and Austria to the northwest, Hungary to the northeast, Romania and Bulgaria to the east, Greece to the south, Albania to the southwest, and the Adriatic Sea to the west. During the socialist period it was common for history and geography teachers to teach their students that Yugoslavia was surrounded with &quot;&quot;, a Serbo-Croatian word meaning &quot;worries&quot; that was also an acronym of the initials of all the countries Yugoslavia bordered with, transformed into a mnemonic principle used for both easy learning and ironic reminder of the difficult relations Yugoslav people had with its neighbors in the past. The most significant change to the borders of the SFRY occurred in 1954, when the adjacent Free Territory of Trieste was dissolved by the Treaty of Osimo. The Yugoslav Zone B that was under military occupation by the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army since 1945, which covered , became part of the SFRY. In 1991, the SFRY&#x27;s territory disintegrated as the independent states of Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina separated from it, though the Yugoslav military controlled parts of Croatia and Bosnia prior to the state&#x27;s dissolution. By 1992, only the republics of Serbia and Montenegro remained committed to a union, and formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in that year.

== Demographics ==

=== Ethnic groups ===
The SFRY recognised &quot;nations&quot; &quot;(narodi)&quot; and &quot;nationalities&quot; &quot;(narodnosti)&quot; separately; the former included the constituent South Slavic peoples (Croats, Macedonians, Montenegrins, Muslims (from 1971), Serbs and Slovenes), while the latter included other Slavic and non-Slavic ethnic groups. In total, about 26 known sizeable ethnic groups were known to live in Yugoslavia. There was also a Yugoslav ethnic designation, for the people who wanted to identify with the entire country, including people who were born to parents in mixed marriages.

=== Languages ===
The population of Yugoslavia spoke mainly three languages: Serbo-Croatian, Slovene and Macedonian. Serbo-Croatian was spoken by the populations in the federated republics of SR Serbia, SR Croatia, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina and SR Montenegro – a total of 17 million people by the late 1980s. Slovene was spoken by approximately 2 million inhabitants of SR Slovenia, while Macedonian was spoken by 1.8 million inhabitants of SR Macedonia. National minorities used their own languages as well, with 506,000 speaking Hungarian (primarily in SAP Vojvodina), and 2,000,000 persons speaking Albanian in SR Serbia (primarily in SAP Kosovo), SR Macedonia and SR Montenegro. Turkish, Romanian (primarily in SAP Vojvodina), and Italian (primarily in Istria and parts of Dalmatia) were also spoken to a lesser extent. The Yugoslav Albanians, almost exclusively Ghegs, chose to use the unified standard language of Albania predominantly based on Tosk Albanian (a different dialect), for political reasons. The three main languages all belong to the South Slavic language group and are thus similar, allowing most people from different areas to understand each other. Intellectuals were mostly acquainted with all three languages, while people of more modest means from SR Slovenia and SR Macedonia were provided an opportunity to learn Serbo-Croatian during the compulsory service in the federal military. Serbo-Croatian itself is made-up of three dialects, Shtokavian, Kajkavian, and Chakavian, with Shtokavian used as the standard official dialect of the language. Official Serbo-Croatian (Shtokavian), was divided into two similar variants, the Croatian (Western) variant and Serbian (Eastern) variant, with minor differences telling the two apart. Two alphabets used in Yugoslavia were: the Latin alphabet and the Cyrillic script. Both alphabets were modified for use by Serbo-Croatian in the 19th century, thus the Serbo-Croatian Latin alphabet is more closely known as Gaj&#x27;s Latin alphabet, while Cyrillic is referred to as the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet. Serbo-Croatian uses both alphabets, Slovene uses only the Latin alphabet, and Macedonian uses only the Cyrillic alphabet. Bosnian and Croatian variants of the language used exclusively Latin, while the Serbian variant used both Latin and Cyrillic.

=== Emigration ===
The small or negative population growth in the former Yugoslavia reflected a high level of emigration. Even before the breakup of the country, during the 1960s and 1970s, Yugoslavia was one of the most important &quot;sending societies&quot; of international migration. An important receiving society was Switzerland, target of an estimated total of 500,000 migrants, who now account for more than 6% of total Swiss population. By the early 1970s, more than one million Yugoslav citizens lived abroad, two-thirds of which were in West Germany, where they were known as &quot;Gastarbeiters&quot;. Significant numbers emigrated to Austria, Australia, Sweden and to the United States and Canada as well.

Emigration of Yugoslav workers was legalised in 1963, as Yugoslavia experienced an economic recession, a high rate of unemployment and a growing debt in hard currency through the two years prior, although another factor for the decision were the already widespread illegal crossings of Yugoslavs looking for work abroad as &#x27;tourists&#x27; throughout the second half of 1950s. Yugoslav leadership would remain dedicated to strengthening and protecting rights of its workers abroad, through embassies, consulates, trade unionists and &#x27;social workers&#x27; who among regular workers were responsible for offering them legal and social support.

== Education ==
Period of the existence of the SFR Yugoslavia was marked by significant development in the field of education. The immediate period after the World War II was marked by the organization of widespread literacy (&quot;analfabetism&quot;) courses which resulted in decrease in the number of illiterate citizens (particularly women who constituted 70% of students) from 4,408,471 (44.6% of population above 10 years in 1931) to 3,162,941 (25.4% of population above 10 years in 1948), 3,066,165 (21% in 1961), 2,549.571 (15.1% in 1971), and 1,780.902 (9,5% in 1981) and with continuous increasing average age among illiterate population. In 1946 there were 10,666 elementary schools with 1.441.679 students and 23.270 teachers while the number of elementary school students peaked in 1975/76 academic year with 2,856,453 students. The country introduced universal eight year elementary public education in 1958. Between 1946 and 1987 the number of high schools in Yugoslavia rose from 959 to 1248 with 6.6% of population with high school diploma in 1953 and 25.5% in 1981. Only 0.6% of population held higher education degree in 1953 with number rising to 1.3% in 1961, 2.8% in 1971 and 5.6% in 1981. While economy and job market of the interwar kingdom was unable to absorb significantly smaller numbers of qualified workers, post-war Yugoslav economy was despite improvements continually faced with a lack of qualified workforce.

=== Universities ===

The University of Zagreb (founded 1669), University of Belgrade (founded 1808) and the University of Ljubljana (founded 1919) already existed before the creation of Socialist Yugoslavia. Between 1945 and 1992 numerous universities were established throughout the country:
*University of Sarajevo (1949)
*University of Skopje (1949)
*University of Novi Sad (1960)
*University of Niš (1965)
*University of Pristina (1970)
*University of Arts in Belgrade (1973)
*University of Rijeka (1973)
*University of Split (1974)
*University of Titograd (1974)
*University of Banja Luka (1975)
*University of Maribor (1975)
*University of Osijek (1975)
*University of Kragujevac (1976)
*University of Tuzla (1976)
*University of Mostar (1977)
*University of Bitola (1979)

== Arts ==
Prior to the collapse of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Yugoslavia had a modern multicultural society. Characteristic attention was based on the concept of brotherhood and unity and the memory of the Communist Yugoslav Partisans&#x27; victory against fascists and nationalists as the rebirth of the Yugoslav people, although all forms of art flourished freely unlike in other socialist countries. In the SFRY the history of Yugoslavia during World War II was omnipresent, and was portrayed as a struggle not only between Yugoslavia and the Axis Powers, but as a struggle between good and evil within Yugoslavia with the multiethnic Yugoslav Partisans were represented as the &quot;good&quot; Yugoslavs fighting against manipulated &quot;evil&quot; Yugoslavs – the Croatian Ustaše and Serbian Chetniks. The SFRY was presented to its people as the leader of the non-aligned movement and that the SFRY was dedicated to creating a just, harmonious, Marxist world.
Artists from different ethnicities in the country were popular amongst other ethnicities, and the film industry in Yugoslavia avoided nationalist overtones until the 1990s. Unlike in other socialist societies, Yugoslavia was considered tolerant to a popular and classical art as long as it was not overly critical of the ruling regime, which made Yugoslavia appear to be a free country despite its one-party regime structure.

=== Literature ===

Significant number of Yugoslav writers supported Yugoslav Partisans efforts during the World War II with some of the most prominent of them being Vladimir Nazor, Oton Župančič, Matej Bor, Kočo Racin, Kajuh, Ivan Goran Kovačić, Skender Kulenović and Branko Ćopić. Socialist realism was a dominant style in the first couple of years after the war yet much more pluralistic attitude developed later. Throughout the period Yugoslav literature was approached as an umbrella term for various local literatures with their own characteristics and inner diversity. The most important international breakthrough for the Yugoslav literature was 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature laureate award to Ivo Andrić. Other prominent Yugoslav writers of the era were Miroslav Krleža, Meša Selimović, Mak Dizdar and others.

=== Graphic arts ===
Notable painters included: Đorđe Andrejević Kun, Petar Lubarda, Mersad Berber, Milić od Mačve and others. Prominent sculptor was Antun Augustinčić who made a monument standing in front of the United Nations Headquarters in New York City.

=== Film ===
Yugoslav cinema featured notable actors such as Danilo Stojković, Mustafa Nadarević, Bata Živojinović, Dragan Nikolić, Ljubiša Samardžić, Boris Dvornik, Milena Dravić, Bekim Fehmiu, Rade Šerbedžija, among many others. Film directors included: Emir Kusturica, Dušan Makavejev, Duša Počkaj, Goran Marković, Lordan Zafranović, Goran Paskaljević, Živojin Pavlović and Hajrudin Krvavac. Many Yugoslav films featured eminent foreign actors such as Orson Welles, Sergei Bondarchuk, Franco Nero and Yul Brynner in the Academy Award nominated &quot;The Battle of Neretva&quot;, and Richard Burton in &quot;Sutjeska&quot;. Also, many foreign films were shot on locations in Yugoslavia including domestic crews, such as &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, &quot;Force 10 from Navarone&quot;, &quot;Armour of God&quot;, as well as &quot;Escape from Sobibor&quot;.

=== Music ===
==== Traditional music ====
Prominent traditional music artists were the Tanec ensemble, the Romani music performer Esma Redžepova and others. A very popular genre in Yugoslavia, also exported to other neighboring countries, and also popular among the Yugoslav emigration worldwide, was the Narodna muzika. The Slovenian most popular folk music was played by Avsenik brothers (Ansambel bratov Avsenik) and Lojze Slak.The folk music emerged in force during the 1970s and 1980s, and by the 1980s and 1990s the so-called novokomponovana muzika style appeared and gave place to controversial turbo-folk style. Lepa Brena in the 1980s become the most popular singer of the Yugoslavia, and a top-selling female recording artist with more than 40 million records sold. Folk performers enjoyed great popularity and became constant presence in the tabloids and media. Yugoslav music scene in its diverse genres became known internationally, from traditional folklore music being appreciated worldwide, through rock-pop music being appreciated in Eastern, and lesser extent, Western Europe, to turbo-folk music being widely exported to neighboring countries.

==== Classical music ====
The pianist Ivo Pogorelić and the violinist Stefan Milenković were internationally acclaimed classical music performers, while Jakov Gotovac was a prominent composer and a conductor.

==== Popular music ====
Yugoslavia had a moderately high degree of artistic and musical freedom, owing in part to the Tito–Stalin split, which saw the country pursue positive relations with many countries outside the Eastern Bloc. Popular music in Yugoslavia had a diverse array of stylistic influences from throughout the world. Western-influenced popular music was socially accepted, more so than in Eastern Bloc countries, and was well-covered in the media, which included numerous concerts, music magazines, radio and TV shows. Aspiring artists could travel to the capitalist countries of Western Europe, and bring back musical instruments and equipment.

Prior to World War II, Yugoslavia was among the least developed countries in Europe. Apart from a small urban elite, much of the population was illiterate, lacked access to musical training, instruments, and radios. The country also suffered from among the highest degree of losses in Europe from World War II. During the 1940s, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia actively promoted socialist realism through agitprop, including music. Many party leaders disparaged Western-style popular music such as jazz, with such music often being stigmatized or censored. However, due to their geography, the Socialist Republics of Slovenia and Croatia had high exposure to popular music from neighboring Austria and Italy during this time. In lieu of it, music imported from the Soviet Union was commonplace, but Communist Party officials were wary of that too, and many felt belittled by Soviet officials.

In 1948, Yugoslavia was expelled from Cominform. Upon this expulsion, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia no longer felt the need to engage in Stalinist-styled cultural policies which suppressed non-propagandist popular music. However, throughout the 1950s, some Party officials remained antagonistic towards music from Western countries. As the country sought to foster more relationships outside of the Eastern Bloc, Yugoslavia opened up more and more through the late 1950s. During the 1950s, Yugoslavia welcomed and hosted many famous international stars.

Yugoslavia&#x27;s economy grew rapidly during the 1950s, enabling more resources to be allocated to consumer goods, including music. The number of radios in the country increased dramatically, as did the production of records. While still tolerant of foreign music, the country&#x27;s political leaders also sought to develop popular music which they felt embodied Yugoslavia&#x27;s own national identity, and many continued to perceive American cultural influence as politically propagandistic. In the 1950s, domestic popular music festivals and artists&#x27; associations were being established and promoted. Many popular Yugoslav artists emerged during this time, including notable names such as Đorđe Marjanović, Gabi Novak, Majda Sepe, Zdenka Vučković, and Vice Vukov. During this time, the country had a heightened cultural exchange with Mexico, which led to the emergence of a local genre of music which fused traditional Mexican elements, known as Yu-Mex. The ascendance of Yugoslav popular music became embraced by the state, which would actively promote it abroad. Yugoslavia entered into the Eurovision Song Contest in 1961, becoming the only self-proclaimed socialist, Eastern European, and predominantly Slavic country to do so. Yugoslavia won the 1989 Eurovision Song Contest following the performance of the song &quot;Rock Me&quot; by the Croatian pop band Riva, marking the country&#x27;s only first place in the competition prior to its breakup.

=====Rock music=====

The Yugoslav rock scene, which emerged in the late 1950s, generally followed Western European and American trends with influences from local traditional music and poetic tradition. During the 1960s, rock music saw little criticism coming from communist authorities, and much more from conservative cultural circles. By the end of the decade, Yugoslav rock scene was well-covered in the media, with a number of festivals, music magazines, and radio and TV shows dedicated to the new music. During the 1970s, rock music was accepted by the Yugoslav public as the music of the Yugoslav youth and an artistic form, with a number of bands enjoying large mainstream popularity and attention of the media. In the 1970s, first voices critical of the Yugoslav social reality emerged on the Yugoslav rock scene; the critical voices escalated after Tito&#x27;s death in 1980, with growing liberalization and new tendencies in arts and culture. Working with relative creative liberty, both mainstream and underground rock acts, although generally not questioning the socialist system, the rule of the League of Communists or the authority of president Tito, recorded songs that depicted negative aspects of Yugoslav socialism.

The 1960s bands like Bijele Strijele, Iskre, Roboti, Siluete, Crveni Koralji, Elipse, Zlatni Dečaci, Crni Biseri, Sanjalice, Kameleoni, Mi, Bele Vrane, Grupa 220 and Žeteoci initially performed mostly covers of international beat, rhythm &amp; blues and soul hits, introducing their own songs into their repertoire in the second half of the decade, achieving large popularity among the country&#x27;s youth. At the end of the decade, progressive, psychedelic and jazz rock was introduced to the scene through the works of bands like Indexi and Korni Grupa. Progressive and jazz rock would dominate the Yugoslav rock scene throughout the 1970s, with bands like Indexi, Korni Grupa, YU Grupa, Smak, Time, Pop Mašina, Drugi Način, Teška Industrija, Leb i Sol, September, Tako and Igra Staklenih Perli enjoying large popularity. Some of the progressive and jazz rock bands incorporated elements of Balkan traditional music into their work; Bijelo Dugme, formed in 1974, led by guitarist Goran Bregović and fronted by singer Željko Bebek, gained massive popularity with their folk-influenced progressive and hard rock sound. During the decade, the scene also saw the appearance of prominent singer-songwriters like Drago Mlinarec, Jadranka Stojaković, Đorđe Balašević, Andrej Šifrer and Miladin Šobić, popular solo singers, like Josipa Lisac, Zdravko Čolić and Slađana Milošević, vibrant acoustic rock scene, with acts like Vlada i Bajka, S Vremena Na Vreme and Suncokret, and avant-garde rock acts like Buldožer and Laboratorija Zvuka. The second half of the decade brought the appearance of popular hard rock and heavy metal acts Atomsko Sklonište, Generacija 5, Divlje Jagode, Vatreni Poljubac and Riblja Čorba, the latter achieving huge popularity owing to provocative social- and political-related lyrics of their frontman Bora Đorđević.

The late 1970s brought the emergence of the closely associated Yugoslav punk rock and new wave scenes. The scenes reached their peak in the early 1980s, with acts like Paraf, Azra, Pankrti, Prljavo Kazalište, Film, Pekinška Patka, Haustor, Lačni Franz, Idoli, Električni Orgazam, Šarlo Akrobata, U Škripcu, Piloti and others recording songs which were critical of the Yugoslav social reality, experimenting and conjoining with other art forms, with some veteran acts, like Bijelo Dugme, Buldožer and Parni Valjak, joining in on the new, exuberant scene. By 1983, the scene saw its decline, with some artists, like Prljavo Kazalište, Film, Električni Orgazam and Piloti, turning towards more commercial rock and pop rock sound, while others continued with artistic and experimental approach in newly-formed bands like Disciplina Kičme and Ekatarina Velika.

By the mid-1980s, the Yugoslav rock scene was noted as one of the richest and most vibrant rock scene in Europe. Yugoslavia was one of seven non-English-speaking countries that took part in the Live Aid initiative, contributing with the all-star charity single &quot;Za milion godina&quot; and the corresponding concert held on the Red Star Stadium. During the 1980s, Yugoslav scene spawned its own authentic movements, like Neue Slowenische Kunst, in which pivotal role was played by the provocative industrial band Laibach, New Primitives, with the bands Zabranjeno Pušenje and Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors, and New Partisans, with the bands Bijelo Dugme, Plavi Orkestar and Merlin. During the decade, large album sales and sold-out concerts in sport arenas were enjoyed by mainstream rock and pop rock acts like Bijelo Dugme, Riblja Čorba, Parni Valjak, Plavi Orkestar, Bajaga i Instruktori, Galija, Aerodrom, Oliver Mandić, Zana, Poslednja Igra Leptira, Xenia, Bebi Dol, Valentino, Đavoli and Crvena Jabuka, synth-pop bands like Laki Pingvini, Denis &amp; Denis and Videosex, art pop bands like Boa and Dorian Gray, and funk rock acts like Oktobar 1864 and Dino Dvornik. Large popularity was also enjoyed by hard rock and glam metal acts like Divlje Jagode, Kerber, Osmi Putnik and Viktorija, punk rock bands like KUD Idijoti, Partibrejkers and Psihomodo Pop, but also by alternative and avant-garde acts like Laibach, Ekatarina Velika and Rambo Amadeus. During the decade, a strong underground scene also developed, with acts like Mizar and Satan Panonski developing a strong cult following.

=== Architectural heritage ===
Although Yugoslav cities and towns architecturally resembled and followed the styles of Central and Southeastern Europe, what became most characteristic of the SFRY period was the creation of a modernist or brutalist style architecture buildings and neighborhoods. Yugoslav cities expanded greatly during this period and the government often opted for the creation of modernist planned neighborhoods to accommodate the growing working middle-class. Such typical examples are the Novi Beograd and Novi Zagreb neighborhoods in two major cities.

== Sports ==
FPR/SFR Yugoslavia developed a strong athletic sports community, notably in team sports such as association football, basketball, handball, water polo, and volleyball.

=== Football ===

The country&#x27;s biggest footballing achievement came on the club level with Red Star Belgrade winning the 1990–91 European Cup, beating Olympique de Marseille in the final played on 29 May 1991. Later that year, they became world club champions by beating Colo-Colo 3–0 in the Intercontinental Cup.

Previously, Red Star had reached the 1978–79 UEFA Cup two-legged final, while their Belgrade cross-town rivals Partizan had been the 1965–66 European Cup finalists. Dinamo Zagreb won the 1966–67 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Furthermore, Čelik Zenica (twice), Red Star Belgrade, Vojvodina, Partizan, Iskra Bugojno, and Borac Banja Luka won the Mitropa Cup; while Velež Mostar, Rijeka, Dinamo Zagreb, and Radnički Niš, each won the Balkans Cup.

On the national team level, FPR/SFR Yugoslavia qualified for seven FIFA World Cups, the best result coming in 1962 in Chile with a 4th-place finish (equalizing the Kingdom of Yugoslavia achievement from 1930). The country also played in four European Championships. The best results came in 1960 and 1968 when the team lost in the finals—in 1960 to Soviet Union and in 1968 to Italy. Yugoslavia was also the first non-Western European country to host a European Championship, UEFA Euro 1976.

Additionally, the Yugoslav Olympic team won gold at the 1960 Olympics in Rome, having previously won silver at the three preceding Olympic Games —1948 in London, 1952 in Helsinki, and 1956 in Melbourne. The team additionally won bronze in 1984 in Los Angeles.

In the youth category, Yugoslavia under-20 team qualified for just two FIFA World Youth Championships, but won in 1987 in Chile while the Yugoslav under-21 team qualified for four UEFA European Under-21 Football Championships winning the inaugural edition in 1978 and coming runners-up in 1990.

On the individual player front, Yugoslavia produced some notable performers on the world stage; such as Rajko Mitić, Stjepan Bobek, Bernard Vukas, Vladimir Beara, Dragoslav Šekularac, Milan Galić, Josip Skoblar, Ivan Ćurković, Velibor Vasović, Dragan Džajić, Safet Sušić, Dragan Stojković, Dejan Savićević, Darko Pančev, Robert Prosinečki, and others.

=== Basketball ===
Unlike football which inherited a lot of its infrastructure and know-how from the pre-World War II Kingdom of Yugoslavia, basketball had very little prior heritage. The sport was thus nurtured and developed from scratch within the Communist Yugoslavia through individual enthusiasts such as Nebojša Popović, Bora Stanković, Radomir Šaper, Aca Nikolić, and Ranko Žeravica. Though a member of FIBA since 1936, the national team did not qualify for a major competition until after World War II. In 1948, the country&#x27;s umbrella basketball association, Yugoslav Basketball Federation (KSJ), was established.

Following its major competition debut at EuroBasket 1947, Yugoslav national team did not take long to become a contender on world stage with the first medal, a silver, coming at EuroBasket 1961. The country&#x27;s most notable results were winning three FIBA World Championships (in 1970, 1978, and 1990), a gold medal at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, in addition to five European Championships (three of them consecutively 1973, 1975, and 1977, followed by two more consecutive ones in 1989 and 1991). As a result of the 1970 FIBA World Championship win, basketball experienced a significant surge of popularity throughout the country, leading to the authorities initiating construction of a number of indoor sporting facilities. Some of the arenas built during this period include: Zagreb&#x27;s Dom Sportova (1972), Belgrade&#x27;s Hala Pionir (1973), Baldekin Sports Hall in Šibenik (1973), Dvorana Mladosti in Rijeka (1973), Hala Pinki in the Belgrade municipality of Zemun (1974), Čair Sports Center in Niš (1974), Kragujevac&#x27;s Hala Jezero (1978), Morača Sports Center in Titograd (1978), and the Gripe Sports Centre in Split (1979).

Simultaneously, on the club level, a multi-tier league system was established in 1945 with the First Federal League at the top of the pyramid. Initially played outdoors—on concrete and clay surfaces—and contested from early spring until mid autumn within the same calendar year due to weather constraints, league games began to be played indoors from October 1967 despite the country still lacking appropriate infrastructure. Initially played in makeshift fair halls and industrial warehouses, club basketball in Yugoslavia experienced a significant organizational upgrade following the 1970 FIBA World Championship win with the country&#x27;s Communist authorities authorizing construction of dozens of indoor sporting arenas around the country so that many clubs found permanent homes. Yugoslav clubs won the European Champion&#x27;s Cup, the continent&#x27;s premiere basketball club competition, on seven occasions—KK Bosna in 1979, KK Cibona in 1985 and 1986, Jugoplastika Split in 1989, 1990, and 1991, and KK Partizan in 1992.

Notable players included Radivoj Korać, Ivo Daneu, Krešimir Ćosić, Zoran Slavnić, Dražen Dalipagić, Dragan Kićanović, Mirza Delibašić, Dražen Petrović, Vlade Divac, Dino Rađa, Toni Kukoč, and Žarko Paspalj.

=== Water polo ===
Water polo is another sport with a strong heritage in the era that predates the creation of Communist Yugoslavia. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, the Yugoslav national team had always been a contender, but never quite managed to make the final step. It was in the 1968 Olympics that the generation led by Mirko Sandić and Ozren Bonačić finally got the gold, beating Soviet Union after extra time. The country won two more Olympic golds – in 1984 and 1988. It also won two World Championship titles – in 1986 and 1991, the latter coming without Croatian players who by that time had already left the national team. The team won only one European Championship title, in 1991. The 1980s and early 1990s were the golden age for Yugoslav water polo during which players such as Igor Milanović, Perica Bukić, Veselin Đuho, Deni Lušić, Dubravko Šimenc, Milorad Krivokapić, Aleksandar Šoštar and others established themselves as among the best in the world.

=== Handball ===
Yugoslavia won two Olympic gold medals – 1972 in Munich (handball returned as an Olympic sport following a 36-year absence) and 1984 in Los Angeles. The country also won the World Championships title in 1986. SFR Yugoslavia never got to compete at the European Championship because the competition got established in 1994. Veselin Vujović was voted World Player of the Year in 1988 (first time the vote was held) by IHF. Other notable players over the years included Abaz Arslanagić, Zoran &quot;Tuta&quot; Živković, Branislav Pokrajac, Zlatan Arnautović, Mirko Bašić, Jovica Elezović, Mile Isaković, etc. On the women&#x27;s side, the game also yielded some notable results – the women&#x27;s team won Olympic gold in 1984 while it also won World Championship in 1973. Just like Veselin Vujović in 1988 on the men&#x27;s side, Svetlana Kitić was voted the World Player of the Year for the same year. There was great enthusiasm in Yugoslavia when Sarajevo was selected as the site of the 1984 Winter Olympic Games.

=== Individual sports ===
FPR/SFR Yugoslavia also managed to produce a multitude of successful athletes in individual disciplines. Tennis had always been a popular and well-followed sport in the country. Still, due to lack of financial means for tennis infrastructure and support of individual athletes, the participation rates among the Yugoslav youngsters for tennis were always low compared to other sports. All this meant that talented players determined to make it to pro level mostly had to rely on their own families rather than the country&#x27;s tennis federation. Yugoslav players still managed to produce some notable results, mostly in the women&#x27;s game. In 1977, the country got its first Grand Slam champion when clay court specialist Mima Jaušovec won at Roland Garros, beating Florența Mihai; Jaušovec reached two more French Open finals (in 1978 and 1983), but lost both of them.

It was with the rise of teenage phenom Monica Seles during the early 1990s that the country became a powerhouse in female tennis: she won five Grand slam events under the flag of SFR Yugoslavia – two French Opens, two Australian Opens, and one US Open. She went on to win three more Grand Slam titles under the flag of FR Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) as well as yet one more Grand Slam after immigration to the United States. In men&#x27;s tennis, Yugoslavia never produced a Grand Slam champion, though it had two finalists. In 1970, Željko Franulović reached the French Open final, losing to Jan Kodeš. Three years later, in 1973, Nikola Pilić also reached the French Open final, but lost it to Ilie Năstase.

Skiers have been very successful in World Cup competitions and the Olympics (Bojan Križaj, Jure Franko, Boris Strel, Mateja Svet). Winter-spots had a special boost during the 1984 Winter Olympics held in Sarajevo. Gymnast Miroslav Cerar won a number of accolades, including two Olympic gold medals during the early 1960s. During the 1970s a pair of Yugoslav boxers, heavyweight Mate Parlov and welterweight Marijan Beneš, won multiple championships. During the late 1970s and into the 1980s, their results were matched by heavyweight Slobodan Kačar. For many years, Yugoslavia was considered the second strongest &quot;chess&quot; nation in the world after the Soviet Union. Arguably the biggest name in Yugoslav chess was Svetozar Gligorić, who played in three Candidates Tournaments between 1953 and 1968 and in 1958 won the Golden Badge as the best athlete in Yugoslavia.

== National anthem ==
The national anthem of Yugoslavia was the Pan-Slavic anthem &quot;Hej, Sloveni&quot; (). First aired and sung on World War II-era sessions of AVNOJ, it first served as a &quot;de facto&quot; state anthem of Yugoslavia during its provisional establishment in 1943. It was always intended to serve as a temporary anthem until a more Yugoslav-themed replacement was found, which never happened; as a result, it was constitutionally recognized in 1988 (and as temporary in 1977), after 43 years of continued &quot;de facto&quot; &#x27;temporary&#x27; usage and only years prior to the breakup. The Yugoslav anthem was inherited by its successor state union of Serbia and Montenegro and likewise was never replaced during its existence despite similar expectations.

== Legacy ==


The present-day states which succeeded Yugoslavia are still today sometimes collectively referred to as the former Yugoslavia (or shortened as Ex-Yu or similar). These countries are, listed chronologically:

* Croatia (since 25 June 1991)
* Slovenia (since 25 June 1991)
* North Macedonia (since 25 September 1991; formerly Macedonia)
* Bosnia and Herzegovina (since 3 March 1992)
* Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro; 1992–2006)
** Montenegro (since 3 June 2006)
** Serbia (since 5 June 2006)
*** Kosovo (since 17 February 2008; independence disputed)

In 2001, former constituent republics reached the partially implemented Agreement on Succession Issues of the Former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that became effective on 2 June 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;NN 2/2004 (17.3.2004.)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the successor states are or were candidates for European Union membership, with Slovenia and Croatia being the two who have already joined the union. Slovenia joined in 2004, and Croatia followed in 2013. North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia are official candidates. Bosnia and Herzegovina has submitted an application and Kosovo has not submitted an application but is recognized as a potential candidate for a possible future enlargement of the European Union. All states of the former Yugoslavia, with the exception of Kosovo, have subscribed to the Stabilisation and Association Process with the EU. European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo is a deployment of EU police and civilian resources to Kosovo in an attempt to restore rule of law and combat the widespread organized crime.

The successor states of Yugoslavia continue to have a population growth rate that is close to zero or negative. This is mostly due to emigration, which intensified during and after the Yugoslav Wars, during the 1990s to 2000s, but also due to low birth rates. More than 2.5 million refugees were created by the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, which led to a massive surge in North American immigration. Close to 120,000 refugees from the former Yugoslavia were registered in the United States from 1991 to 2002, and 67,000 migrants from the former Yugoslavia were registered in Canada between 1991 and 2001.

Net population growth over the two decades between 1991 and 2011 was thus practically zero (below 0.1% p.a. on average). Broken down by territory:

Remembrance of the time of the joint state and its perceived positive attributes, such as the social stability, the possibility to travel freely, the level of education and the welfare system, is typically referred to as Yugo-nostalgia. People who identify with the former Yugoslav state may self-identify as Yugoslavs. The social, linguistic, economic and cultural ties between former Yugoslav countries are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Yugosphere&quot;.

<doc id="297810" wikidata="Q113786" url="?curid=297810" title="Karl H. Pribram">
<text>Karl H. Pribram (; ; February 25, 1919 – January 19, 2015) was a visionary neurosurgeon, neuroscientist and theoretical philosopher described by his peers as the “Einstein of Brain Science” and the “Magellan of the Mind” for his groundbreaking research into the function and roles of the limbic system, frontal lobes, and temporal lobes as they relate to decision making, memory, and emotional processing.

Pribram is internationally known for his pioneering research on the structure and function of the brain, his development of the Holonomic Brain Model of cognitive function (with quantum physicist David Bohm), and his multiple contributions to neurological research focused on the structure and function of the brain, especially centered around memory, perception, emotion, motivation, consciousness.

== Holonomic model ==

Karl Pribram&#x27;s holonomic brain theory states that brain processes are distributed in the form of interference wave patterns and interact on a quantum level. Pribram based his initial theory on insight&#x27;s by Dennis Gabor, Nobel Prize winner and inventor of holography. Pribram&#x27;s theory postulates that certain brain processes, such as memory, do not take place solely through the axons, synapses, or reflex-type actions but rather through a concerted, ever-changing action that operates similarly to quantum field theory. This quantum theory of consciousness was expanded upon by Pribram&#x27;s interactions with theorectical physicist David Bohm who coined the concept of the implicate order.

Karl Pribram first explored the metaphor of information storage in the brain as a hologram in his &quot;Languages of the Brain: Experimental Paradoxes and Principles in Neuropsychology&quot; (1971). In a review of &quot;Languages&quot;, in Behavioral Science Journal, R.P McDermott and Laurence Mucciolo stated &quot;The book&#x27;s contribution to neuropsychology will be hailed, developed and disputed for years to come.&quot;

Pribram&#x27;s holonomic model of brain processing is further described in &quot;Brain and Perception: Holonomy and Structure in Figural Processing&quot; (1991), which contains the extension of his work with David Bohm. It states that, in addition to the circuitry accomplished by the large fiber tracts in the brain, processing also occurs in the dendritic field, as well as in the dynamic electrical fields that surround these dendrites. In addition, the processing occurring around these neural dendrites may influence processes occurring nearby neurons whose dendrites are entangled, but are not in direct contact (known as ephaptic signaling). In this way, processing in the brain can occur in a non-localized manner.

== Teaching Career and Research ==
In the 1940s, Pribram became one of the first 300 board-certified neurosurgeons in the world after receiving his MD from University of Chicago. Throughout his life, Pribram would engage in pioneering work on the definition of the limbic system, the relationship of the frontal cortex to the limbic system, the sensory-specific association cortex of the parietal and temporal lobes, and the classical motor cortex of the human brain.

Pribram&#x27;s interest in research led him to work with Karl Lashley at the Yerkes Primate Center, known as the “most important institute for neuropsychological research on animals in the 1940s.” Shortly after the end of WWII, Pribram succeeded Lashley as director of Yerkes and “added neurosurgical sophistication” that allowed the field of animal neuropsychology to expand and flourish during his time as director. These early years would prove to be influential in his development of theories about the structure of the brain and related mental processes. Two of the earliest discoveries Pribram made while at Yerkes were of the relationship between the frontal cortex and the limbic forebrain, and the relationship between the posterior cortex and sensory specific sectors.

In 1948, Pribram was invited to join the Department of Physiology at Yale University, where he would continue his research and teach neurophysiology and physiological psychology for the next decade. While at Yale, Pribram established and directed the Psychophysiology Laboratory at the Institute for Living in Hartford, which “became a mecca for students intensely interested in the relationship between brain and behavior.” As Director of the Psychophysiology Laboratory, Pribram would conduct some of the earliest research on brain circuitry. It was during this time that Mortimer Mishkin was a graduate student under Pribram. During this time, Pribram established relationships with psychologists at Harvard University and “learned a great deal from S.S. Stevens, Gary Boring, and Georg von Bekesy.” Additionally, Pribram noted that his interactions with B.F. Skinner at Harvard would influence his research into cognitive neuropsychology.

After his tenure at Yale, Pribram moved to the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University, where he continued to teach neurophysiology and physiological psychology for the next 30 years. During this time, Pribram pioneered the field of neuropsychology (a term that he coined), leading groundbreaking research into the interrelations of the brain, behavior, and the mind. While at Stanford, as Professor Emeritus of Neuroscience in the Departments of Psychology and Psychiatry, Pribram was honored with a Lifetime Research Career Award from the National Institutes of Health . 

In 1975, a Stanford secretary, Barbara Honegger, filed a complaint alleging that Pribram had &quot;denied [her] a job rank she was entitled to&quot; while further alleging that Pribram had &quot;struck her in the head.&quot; Pribram was placed on temporary probation by Stanford, while Honegger received a parting out-of-court settlement from the school.

Patrick Bateson, English biologist, spent two years working with Pribram at Yale under a Harkness Fellowship. Bateson used this time to explore the neural basis of animal behaviors, specifically communication and learning.

Upon becoming emeritus at Stanford University, Pribram accepted the position of the James P. and Anna King Distinguished Professor at Radford University and, in 1989, was appointed Eminent Scholar of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Radford built the Center for Brain Research and Informational Sciences (B.R.A.I.N.S.) for Pribram to direct with the support of Alastair Harris, chair of the psychology department. After 60 years of leading research and development in the field of brain research, Pribram was appointed Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience at Georgetown University in 1998. Simultaneously, he was appointed Distinguished Professor in the Engineering and Computer Science Department at George Mason University.

== Influence on Other Researchers ==
Over fifty doctoral and fifty postdoctoral fellows were trained in the neuropsychological laboratories at Yale and Stanford under Pribram’s direction. At Stanford, Leslie Ungerleider (noted experimental psychologist and neuroscientist) was among those who made major contributions. 

During Pribram&#x27;s tenure at Yale, while directing the Psychophysiology Laboratory at the Institute for Living, many young researchers where able to explore the importance of utilizing psychology combined with neurophysiology, including Lawrence Weiskrantz (Harvard) and Mortimer Mishkin (McGill).

== Accolades ==
Karl Pribram was the recipient of more than seventy major international awards and honors.

Pribram was presented the inaugural Dagmar and Vaclav Havel Award (The VIZE 97 Prize) in 1999 for uniting the sciences and the humanities. The award was created to honor significant individuals whose work transcends the conventional framework of scientific understanding. Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic and award namesake, declared, “[Pribram] is an example to people of different fields and orientations, such as neurologists, psychologists, mathematicians, scientists and philosophers. It is a wonder to see people from all over the world united by one purpose when so often the world is divided by distrust and small disparities.”

Pribram was granted honorary doctorates in psychology and neuroscience from the University of Montreal and University of Bremen; as well as an Outstanding Contributions Award from the American Board of Medical Psychotherapists.

== Additional contributions ==
In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Pribram&#x27;s neurobehavioral experiments established the composition of the limbic system and the executive functions of the prefrontal cortex. Pribram also discovered the sensory specific systems of the association cortex, and showed that these systems operate to organize the choices we make among sensory stimuli, not the sensing of the stimuli themselves.

In 1958, Pribram coined the term &quot;the Four F&#x27;s&quot; for &quot;Feeding, Fighting, Fleeing and Sex&quot; in relation to the functions of the frontolimbic forebrain, specifically the amygdala. This term has been adopted by evolutionary psychologists to describe our most &quot;primal drives.&quot;

== In Popular Culture ==

=== The Aquarian Conspiracy ===
Marilyn Ferguson summarized and interpreted Karl Pribram&#x27;s holonomic model of brain processing in her popular book, &quot;The Aquarian Conspiracy&quot; (1980). In the book she also describes how Pribram&#x27;s son, John Pribram, Ph.D, introduced him to the work of David Bohm, leading to the further development of Pribram&#x27;s holonomic brain theory. Additionally, Ferguson produced the Brain/Mind Bulletin, a science newsletter dedicated to sharing cutting-edge research from prominent scientists and theorists including Pribram, Bohm, and Prigogine.

=== SyberVision ===
Steve DeVore, the founder of SyberVision, worked as a research assistant to Pribram at Stanford, where he would investigate the function of mirror neurons. Together they published &quot;The Neuropsychology of Achievement&quot; which proposed the concept of creating an &quot;image of achievement&quot; to attain one&#x27;s goals.

=== Feldenkrais Foundation ===
While at Stanford, Pribram was introduced to Dr. Moshé Feldenkrais, the founder of the Feldenkrais Method. Pribram would later visit Feldenkrais&#x27; training program in California where they engaged in a series of conversations focused on the holographic and dynamic qualities of brain functioning.

==Selected Works==
&quot;The Form Within: My Point of View&quot; (2013) is perhaps Pribram’s most widely recognized publication. In &quot;The Form Within,&quot; Pribram describes 200 years of brain research coupled with insights from his 70 years of active participation in the field. Pribram also describes his relationships and interactions with colleagues and luminaries including David Bohm, Francis Crick, John Eccles, Dennis Gabor, Aleksandr Romanovitch Luria, Ilya Prigogine, B. F. Skinner, Eugene Sokolov, and others.

&quot;Plans and the Structure of Behavior&quot; (1960), co-written with George Armitage Miller and Eugene Galanter, is widely credited as a seminal work in the development of the field of cognitive psychology.

In his lifetime, Karl Pribram published over 700 scientific publications including books and monographs, as well as data and theory papers. A complete bibliography of Pribram&#x27;s publications can be found on his website.

<doc id="297811" wikidata="Q518131" url="?curid=297811" title="Jensen's inequality">
<text>In mathematics, Jensen&#x27;s inequality, named after the Danish mathematician Johan Jensen, relates the value of a convex function of an integral to the integral of the convex function. It was proved by Jensen in 1906, building on an earlier proof of the same inequality for doubly-differentiable functions by Otto Hölder in 1889. Given its generality, the inequality appears in many forms depending on the context, some of which are presented below. In its simplest form the inequality states that the convex transformation of a mean is less than or equal to the mean applied after convex transformation (or equivalently, the opposite inequality for concave transformations).

Jensen&#x27;s inequality generalizes the statement that the secant line of a convex function lies &quot;above&quot; the graph of the function, which is Jensen&#x27;s inequality for two points: the secant line consists of weighted means of the convex function (for &quot;t&quot; ∈ [0,1]),

:formula_1

while the graph of the function is the convex function of the weighted means,

:formula_2

Thus, Jensen&#x27;s inequality in this case is
:formula_3

In the context of probability theory, it is generally stated in the following form: if &quot;X&quot; is a random variable and is a convex function, then

:formula_4

The difference between the two sides of the inequality, formula_5, is called the Jensen gap.

==Statements==
The classical form of Jensen&#x27;s inequality involves several numbers and weights. The inequality can be stated quite generally using either the language of measure theory or (equivalently) probability. In the probabilistic setting, the inequality can be further generalized to its &quot;full strength&quot;.

===Finite form===
For a real convex function formula_6, numbers formula_7 in its domain, and positive weights formula_8, Jensen&#x27;s inequality can be stated as:

and the inequality is reversed if formula_6 is concave, which is

Equality holds if and only if formula_10 or formula_6 is linear on a domain containing formula_12.

As a particular case, if the weights formula_8 are all equal, then () and () become


For instance, the function is &quot;concave&quot;, so substituting formula_14 in the previous formula () establishes the (logarithm of the) familiar arithmetic-mean/geometric-mean inequality:

formula_15
formula_16
formula_17

A common application has as a function of another variable (or set of variables) , that is, formula_18. All of this carries directly over to the general continuous case: the weights are replaced by a non-negative integrable function , such as a probability distribution, and the summations are replaced by integrals.

===Measure-theoretic form===
Let formula_19 be a probability space. Let formula_20 be a formula_21-measurable function and formula_22 be convex. Then:
formula_23 

In real analysis, we may require an estimate on

:formula_24

where formula_25, and formula_26 is a non-negative Lebesgue-integrable function. In this case, the Lebesgue measure of formula_27 need not be unity. However, by integration by substitution, the interval can be rescaled so that it has measure unity. Then Jensen&#x27;s inequality can be applied to get

:formula_28

===Probabilistic form===
The same result can be equivalently stated in a probability theory setting, by a simple change of notation. Let formula_29 be a probability space, &quot;X&quot; an integrable real-valued random variable and formula_6 a convex function. Then:

:formula_31

In this probability setting, the measure is intended as a probability formula_32, the integral with respect to as an expected value formula_33, and the function formula_34 as a random variable &quot;X&quot;.

Note that the equality holds if and only if formula_6 is a linear function on some convex set formula_36 such that formula_37 (which follows by inspecting the measure-theoretical proof below).

===General inequality in a probabilistic setting===
More generally, let &quot;T&quot; be a real topological vector space, and &quot;X&quot; a &quot;T&quot;-valued integrable random variable. In this general setting, &quot;integrable&quot; means that there exists an element formula_38 in &quot;T&quot;, such that for any element &quot;z&quot; in the dual space of &quot;T&quot;: formula_39, and formula_40. Then, for any measurable convex function and any sub-σ-algebra formula_41 of formula_42:

:formula_43

Here formula_44 stands for the expectation conditioned to the σ-algebra formula_41. This general statement reduces to the previous ones when the topological vector space is the real axis, and formula_41 is the trivial -algebra (where is the empty set, and is the sample space).

=== A sharpened and generalized form ===
Let &quot;X&quot; be a one-dimensional random variable with mean formula_21 and variance formula_48. Let formula_49 be a twice differentiable function, and define the function

:formula_50

Then

:formula_51

In particular, when formula_49 is convex, then formula_53, and the standard form of Jensen&#x27;s inequality immediately follows for the case where formula_49 is additionally assumed to be twice differentiable.

==Proofs==

=== Intuitive graphical proof ===


Jensen&#x27;s inequality can be proved in several ways, and three different proofs corresponding to the different statements above will be offered. Before embarking on these mathematical derivations, however, it is worth analyzing an intuitive graphical argument based on the probabilistic case where is a real number (see figure). Assuming a hypothetical distribution of values, one can immediately identify the position of formula_38 and its image formula_56 in the graph. Noticing that for convex mappings of some values the corresponding distribution of values is increasingly &quot;stretched up&quot; for increasing values of , it is easy to see that the distribution of is broader in the interval corresponding to and narrower in for any ; in particular, this is also true for formula_57. Consequently, in this picture the expectation of will always shift upwards with respect to the position of formula_56. A similar reasoning holds if the distribution of covers a decreasing portion of the convex function, or both a decreasing and an increasing portion of it. This &quot;proves&quot; the inequality, i.e. 

:formula_59

with equality when is not strictly convex, e.g. when it is a straight line, or when follows a degenerate distribution (i.e. is a constant).

The proofs below formalize this intuitive notion.

===Proof 1 (finite form)===
If and are two arbitrary nonnegative real numbers such that then convexity of implies

:formula_60

This can be generalized: if are nonnegative real numbers such that , then

:formula_61

for any . 

The &quot;finite form&quot; of the Jensen&#x27;s inequality can be proved by induction: by convexity hypotheses, the statement is true for &quot;n&quot; = 2. Suppose the statement is true for some &quot;n&quot;, so

:formula_62

for any such that .

One needs to prove it for . At least one of the is strictly smaller than formula_63, say ; therefore by convexity inequality:

:formula_64

Since ,

: formula_65,

applying the inductive hypothesis gives

: formula_66

therefore 

: formula_67

We deduce the inequality is true for , by induction it follows that the result is also true for all integer greater than 2. 

In order to obtain the general inequality from this finite form, one needs to use a density argument. The finite form can be rewritten as:

:formula_68

where &quot;μ&quot;&quot;n&quot; is a measure given by an arbitrary convex combination of Dirac deltas:

:formula_69

Since convex functions are continuous, and since convex combinations of Dirac deltas are weakly dense in the set of probability measures (as could be easily verified), the general statement is obtained simply by a limiting procedure.

===Proof 2 (measure-theoretic form)===
Let formula_70 be a real-valued formula_21-integrable function on a probability space formula_72, and let formula_6 be a convex function on the real numbers. Since formula_6 is convex, at each real number formula_75 we have a nonempty set of subderivatives, which may be thought of as lines touching the graph of formula_6 at formula_75, but which are below the graph of formula_6 at all points (support lines of the graph).

Now, if we define
:formula_79
because of the existence of subderivatives for convex functions, we may choose formula_80 and formula_81 such that
:formula_82
for all real formula_75 and
:formula_84
But then we have that
:formula_85
for almost all formula_86. Since we have a probability measure, the integral is monotone with formula_87 so that

:formula_88

as desired.

===Proof 3 (general inequality in a probabilistic setting)===
Let &quot;X&quot; be an integrable random variable that takes values in a real topological vector space &quot;T&quot;. Since formula_89 is convex, for any formula_90, the quantity

:formula_91

is decreasing as approaches 0+. In particular, the &quot;subdifferential&quot; of formula_6 evaluated at in the direction is well-defined by

:formula_93

It is easily seen that the subdifferential is linear in (that is false and the assertion requires Hahn-Banach theorem to be proved) and, since the infimum taken in the right-hand side of the previous formula is smaller than the value of the same term for , one gets

:formula_94

In particular, for an arbitrary sub--algebra formula_95 we can evaluate the last inequality when formula_96 to obtain

:formula_97

Now, if we take the expectation conditioned to formula_95 on both sides of the previous expression, we get the result since:

:formula_99

by the linearity of the subdifferential in the &quot;y&quot; variable, and the following well-known property of the conditional expectation:

:formula_100

==Applications and special cases==

===Form involving a probability density function===
Suppose is a measurable subset of the real line and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a non-negative function such that

:formula_101

In probabilistic language, &quot;f&quot; is a probability density function.

Then Jensen&#x27;s inequality becomes the following statement about convex integrals:

If &quot;g&quot; is any real-valued measurable function and formula_102 is convex over the range of &quot;g&quot;, then

:formula_103

If &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;, then this form of the inequality reduces to a commonly used special case:

:formula_104

This is applied in Variational Bayesian methods.

===Example: even moments of a random variable===

If &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x2n&quot;, and &quot;X&quot; is a random variable, then &quot;g&quot; is convex as
:formula_105
and so 
:formula_106

In particular, if some even moment &quot;2n&quot; of &quot;X&quot; is finite, &quot;X&quot; has a finite mean. An extension of this argument shows &quot;X&quot; has finite moments of every order formula_107 dividing &quot;n&quot;.

===Alternative finite form===
Let and take to be the counting measure on , then the general form reduces to a statement about sums:

:formula_108

provided that and

:formula_109

There is also an infinite discrete form.

===Statistical physics===
Jensen&#x27;s inequality is of particular importance in statistical physics when the convex function is an exponential, giving:

:formula_110

where the expected values are with respect to some probability distribution in the random variable .

Proof: Let formula_111 in formula_31

===Information theory===
If is the true probability density for , and is another density, then applying Jensen&#x27;s inequality for the random variable and the convex function gives

:formula_113

Therefore:

:formula_114

a result called Gibbs&#x27; inequality.

It shows that the average message length is minimised when codes are assigned on the basis of the true probabilities &quot;p&quot; rather than any other distribution &quot;q&quot;. The quantity that is non-negative is called the Kullback–Leibler divergence of &quot;q&quot; from &quot;p&quot;, where formula_115.

Since is a strictly convex function for , it follows that equality holds when equals almost everywhere.

===Rao–Blackwell theorem===
If &quot;L&quot; is a convex function and formula_41 a sub-sigma-algebra, then, from the conditional version of Jensen&#x27;s inequality, we get

:formula_117

So if δ(&quot;X&quot;) is some estimator of an unobserved parameter θ given a vector of observables &quot;X&quot;; and if &quot;T&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is a sufficient statistic for θ; then an improved estimator, in the sense of having a smaller expected loss &quot;L&quot;, can be obtained by calculating

:formula_118

the expected value of δ with respect to θ, taken over all possible vectors of observations &quot;X&quot; compatible with the same value of &quot;T&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) as that observed. Further, because T is a sufficient statistic, formula_119 does not depend on θ, hence, becomes a statistic.

This result is known as the Rao–Blackwell theorem.

===Risk aversion===

The relation between risk aversion and declining marginal utility for scalar outcomes can be stated formally with Jensen&#x27;s inequality: risk aversion can be stated as preferring a certain outcome formula_120 to a fair gamble with potentially larger but uncertain outcome of formula_121:

formula_122.

But this is simply Jensen&#x27;s inequality for a &quot;concave&quot; formula_121: a utility function that exhibits declining marginal utility.

==Generalizations==
Beyond its classical formulation for real numbers and convex functions, Jensen’s inequality has been extended to the realm of operator theory. In this non‐commutative setting the inequality is expressed in terms of operator convex functions—that is, functions defined on an interval I that satisfy
:formula_124
for every pair of self‐adjoint operators x and y (with spectra in I) and every scalar formula_125. Hansen and Pedersen established a definitive version of this inequality by considering genuine non‐commutative convex combinations. In particular, if one has an n‑tuple of bounded self‐adjoint operators formula_126 with spectra in I and an n‑tuple of operators formula_127 satisfying
:formula_128
then the following operator Jensen inequality holds:
:formula_129
This result shows that the convex transformation “respects” non-commutative convex combinations, thereby extending the classical inequality to operators without the need for additional restrictions on the interval of definition.
A closely related extension is given by the Jensen trace inequality. For a continuous convex function f defined on I, if one considers self‐adjoint matrices formula_126 (with spectra in I) and matrices formula_127 satisfying formula_132, then one has
:formula_133
This inequality naturally extends to C*-algebras equipped with a finite trace and is particularly useful in applications ranging from quantum statistical mechanics to information theory.
Furthermore, contractive versions of these operator inequalities are available when one only assumes formula_134, provided that additional conditions such as formula_135 (when 0 ∈ I) are imposed. Extensions to continuous fields of operators and to settings involving conditional expectations on C-algebras further illustrate the broad applicability of these generalizations.

<text>Stuart Hameroff (born July 16, 1947) is an American anesthesiologist and professor at the University of Arizona known for his studies of consciousness and his controversial contention that consciousness originates from quantum states in neural microtubules. He is the lead organizer of the Science of Consciousness conference.

==Career==
Hameroff received his BS degree from the University of Pittsburgh and his MD degree from Hahnemann University Hospital, where he studied before it became part of the Drexel University College of Medicine. He took an internship at the Tucson Medical Center in 1973. From 1975 onwards, he has spent the whole of his career at the University of Arizona, becoming professor in the Department of Anesthesiology and Psychology and director for the Center for Consciousness Studies, both in 1999, and finally Emeritus professor for Anesthesiology and Psychology in 2003.

==Theory==
At the very beginning of Hameroff&#x27;s career, while he was at Hahnemann, cancer-related research work piqued his interest in the part played by microtubules in cell division, and led him to speculate that they were controlled by some form of computing. It also suggested to him that part of the solution of the problem of consciousness might lie in understanding the operations of microtubules in brain cells, operations at the molecular and supramolecular level.

Hameroff&#x27;s first book &quot;Ultimate Computing&quot; (1987) argues that microtubes allow for computation sufficient to explain consciousness. The main substance of this book dealt with the scope for information processing in biological tissue and especially in microtubules and other parts of the cytoskeleton. Hameroff argued that these subneuronal cytoskeleton components could be the basic units of processing rather than the neurons themselves. The book was primarily concerned with information processing, with consciousness a secondary consideration.
Separately from Hameroff, the English mathematical physicist Roger Penrose had published his first book on consciousness, &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Mind&quot;, in 1989. On the basis of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems, he argued that the brain could perform functions that no computer or system of algorithms could. From this it could follow that consciousness itself might be fundamentally non-algorithmic and therefore impossible to model as a classical Turing machine type of computer. This conflicts with the idea that consciousness is explainable mechanistically, the prevailing view among neuroscientists and artificial intelligence researchers.

Penrose saw the principles of quantum theory as providing an alternative process through which consciousness could arise. He further argued that this non-algorithmic process required a new form of the quantum wave reduction, later given the name objective reduction (OR), which could link the brain to the fundamental spacetime geometry.

Hameroff was inspired by Penrose&#x27;s book to contact Penrose regarding his own theories about the mechanism of anesthesia, and how it specifically targets consciousness via action on neural microtubules. The two met in 1992, and Hameroff suggested that the microtubules were a good candidate site for a quantum mechanism in the brain. Penrose was interested in the mathematical features of the microtubule lattice, and over the next two years the two collaborated in formulating the orchestrated objective reduction (Orch-OR) model of consciousness. Following this collaboration, Penrose published his second consciousness book, &quot;Shadows of the Mind&quot; (1994).

Over the years since 1994, Hameroff has been active in promoting the Orch-OR model of consciousness through his web site and lectures.

==Criticism==
Hameroff and Penrose&#x27;s model has been met with skepticism from many disciplines. Rick Grush and Patricia Churchland, argued that &quot;physiological evidence indicates that consciousness does not directly depend on microtubule properties in any case&quot;.

In 2000, physicist Max Tegmark calculated that quantum states in microtubules would survive for only 10−13 seconds, too brief to be of any significance for neural processes. Hameroff and the physicists Scott Hagan and Jack Tuszynski replied to Tegmark arguing that microtubules could be shielded against the environment of the brain and that Tegmark had used his own criteria for the reduction of the wavefunction, and did not use Penrose&#x27;s OR, which is the basic assumption behind the whole theory. Christof Koch and Klaus Hepp also agreed that quantum coherence does not play, or does not need to play any major role in neurophysiology. Koch and Hepp concluded that &quot;[t]he empirical demonstration of slowly decoherent and controllable quantum bits in neurons connected by electrical or chemical synapses, or the discovery of an efficient quantum algorithm for computations performed by the brain, would do much to bring these speculations from the &#x27;far-out&#x27; to the mere &#x27;very unlikely&#x27;.&quot; In 2022, a group of Italian physicists conducted several experiments that failed to provide evidence in support of a gravity-related quantum collapse model of consciousness, weakening the possibility of a quantum explanation for consciousness.

==Toward a science of consciousness==

Hameroff was the lead organizer of the first Tucson Toward a Science of Consciousness meeting in 1994 that brought together approximately 300 people interested in consciousness studies (e.g., David Chalmers, Christof Koch, Bernard Baars, Roger Penrose, Benjamin Libet). Hameroff remains co-organizer of this influential annual conference (now simply Science of Consciousness). The first conference is widely regarded as a landmark event within the field of consciousness studies, and by bringing researchers from various disciplines together led to various useful synergies, resulting indirectly, for instance, in the formation of the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness, and more directly in the creation of the Center for Consciousness Studies at the University of Arizona, of which Hameroff is now the director. The Center for Consciousness Studies hosts meetings on the study of consciousness every two years, as well as sponsoring seminars on consciousness theory. The conference was described by the &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; as &quot;the Stuart Show&quot;, and that its &quot;anything goes&quot; atmosphere is damaging the credibility of the field.

In 2006, Hameroff participated in the first Beyond Belief conference, where his theories were criticized by Lawrence Krauss, among others.

==Film==
Hameroff appeared as himself in the documentary film &quot;What tнe ♯$*! Do ωΣ (k)πow!?&quot; (2004). He serves as producer, writer and scientific advisor to an independent feature film called Mindville. Mindville is a feature-length motion picture that combines live action with animation and effects to present a journey into the mysteries of human consciousness.

Hameroff has been interviewed in season 2, episode 1 of &quot;Through the Wormhole&quot;.

<doc id="297821" wikidata="Q2158828" url="?curid=297821" title="Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester">
<text>Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester (19 November 1563 – 13 July 1626), was an English courtier, soldier, and landowner. He was chamberlain to Anne of Denmark.

==Family background==
Robert Sidney was the second son of Sir Henry Sidney, was a statesman of Elizabethan and Jacobean England. He was also a patron of the arts and a poet. His mother, Mary Sidney née Dudley, was a lady-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth I and a sister of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, an advisor and favourite of the Queen.

==Career==
Sidney was educated at Shrewsbury and Christ Church, Oxford, afterwards travelling on the Continent for some years between 1578 and 1583. In 1585 he was elected member of parliament for Glamorganshire; and in the same year he went with his elder brother, Sir Philip Sidney to the Netherlands, where he served in the war against Spain under Robert Dudley. He was present at the Battle of Zutphen where Sir Philip Sidney was mortally wounded, and remained with his brother.

After visiting Scotland on a diplomatic mission in 1588, and France on a similar errand in 1593, he returned to the Netherlands in 1606, where he rendered distinguished service in the war for the next two years. He had been appointed governor of the cautionary town of Flushing in 1588, and he spent much time there. In 1595 he sent his business manager Rowland Whyte to court to lobby for resources for Flushing, and to send him information about events at court including the latest political gossip. Whyte&#x27;s letters provide a major resource for historians of the period. Whyte himself regularly complains about the indecipherable handwriting of his employer&#x27;s replies.

In 1603, on the accession of James I, he returned to England. Sidney bought new clothes to meet the king at Lord Harington&#x27;s house at Burley. James raised him at once to the peerage as Baron Sidney of Penshurst, and he was appointed chamberlain and surveyor to the queen consort, Anne of Denmark. Sidney was involved in the English administration of her jointure lands and her revenues. He dealt with correspondence from county agents, like Thomas Coningsby, and worked on a plan to enlarge the park of Nonsuch Palace to make it a better residence for the queen.

Identified as an influential courtier, the French ambassador the Marquis de Rosny gave him a chain of perfumed gold beads and diamomds with a minature of Henry IV of France. In January 1605, Sidney was involved the production of &quot;The Masque of Blackness&quot;. Jewels used in the costumes valued at £10,000 were borrowed from goldsmiths including John Spilman, and Sidney became liable for £40 for two lost diamonds. He was created Viscount Lisle. In August 1605 he decided to visit Vlissingen, but a storm forced his ship to land in Spanish territory at Gravelines. A suspicion arose at the English court that he had intended to go there, perhaps to betray the English-held fortress. Sidney managed to clear himself.

He wrote to William Trumbull in September 1614 with news of the queen&#x27;s illness, she was &quot;much troubled with paines in her legs and feet&quot;. In August 1615 he went with Anne of Denmark to Bath, and was joined by his daughter Catherine and her husband Lewis Mansel who travelled from Margam. Catherine came for medical advice in Bath.

In May 1618 he wrote to Sir Thomas Lake, the king&#x27;s secretary with news of the queen declaration about efforts to reduce household expenses. She had told him that &quot;while she lives she will obey the king in all things ... She therefore desires his majesty to take what order it shall please him, which shall please her also, for being wholly ignorant in household business, she will not any meddle with them&quot;.

In July 1618 he became Earl of Leicester. The title had become extinct in 1588 on the death of his uncle Robert Dudley, part of whose property he had inherited. Sidney wrote to his wife that their promotion was due to Anne of Denmark.

He was ill in September 1618 and was attended at Hampton Court by Henry Atkins and Théodore de Mayerne at the request of Anne of Denmark.

==Marriage and progeny==

Sidney married twice: 

Firstly to Barbara Gamage, a noted heiress and beauty, the daughter of John Gamage, of Coity Castle, a Glamorgan gentleman. By his first wife, he had eleven children.
*Mary Sidney, (c. 1587—c.1653) (Lady Mary Wroth), who married Sir Robert Wroth of Loughton Hall, was like her father a poet; Ben Jonson dedicated &quot;The Alchemist&quot; to her in 1612.
*Catherine Sidney, (c. 1589-1616) who married Sir Lewis Mansel. 
*Sir William Sidney (1590—1612), his eldest son who predeceased his father and died unmarried.
*Henry Sidney (1591)
*Elizabeth Sidney (1592—1605)
*Philippa Sidney, (1594—1620) who performed in masques at Whitehall Palace, married Sir John Hobart, 2nd Baronet, third son of Sir Henry Hobart, 1st Baronet, Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and ancestor of the Earls of Buckinghamshire.
*Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester, (1595—1677) second son and heir.
*Bridget Sidney (1597—1599)
*Alice Sidney (1598—1599)
*Barbara Sidney, (1599—1643) who married first Thomas Smythe and second to Thomas Culpeper
*Vere Sidney (1602—1606)

Secondly to Sarah Blount, daughter of William Blount, and widow of Sir Thomas Smythe, by whom he had no children.

==Music and poetry==
Leicester was a man of taste and a patron of literature, whose cultured mode of life at his country seat, Penshurst Place, was celebrated in verse by Ben Jonson. Robert Sidney was a patron of musicians, as is proved by his being the dedicatee of Robert Jones&#x27;s &quot;First Booke of Songes and Ayres&quot; (1600) and &quot;A Musicall Banquet&quot; (1610) compiled by Robert Dowland, son of the composer John Dowland. Sidney had agreed to be godfather to John Dowland&#x27;s son, and &quot;A Musicall Banquet&quot; opens with a Galliard by John Dowland entitled &quot;Syr Robert Sidney his Galliard&quot;.

Though the brother of one of the most famous poets in the English language, it was not suspected that Robert Sidney had himself been a poet until the 1960s, when his working notebook emerged (in a 19th-century binding) through the dispersal of the Library of Warwick Castle. Subsequent research showed it had been acquired in 1848 after passing through a number of sales beginning with the dispersal of the library at Penshurst in the early 19th century. Sold again at Sotheby&#x27;s and acquired by the British Library in 1975 (catalogued as Add MS 58435), the autograph is, as its first editor P. J. Croft pointed out, &quot;the largest body of verse to have survived from the Elizabethan period in a text entirely set down by the poet himself&quot;.

==Armorials==

<doc id="297823" wikidata="Q4121000" url="?curid=297823" title="Anthony St Leger (Lord Deputy of Ireland)">
<text>Sir Anthony St Leger, KG (or Sellenger; 1496 – 16 March 1559), of Ulcombe and Leeds Castle in Kent, was an English politician and Lord Deputy of Ireland during the Tudor period.

==Origins==
Anthony St Leger was the eldest son of Ralph II St Leger of Ulcombe in Kent, by his wife Isabel (or Elizabeth) Haute. She was the daughter of Richard Haute (d. 8 April 1487, son of William Haute) by his wife Elizabeth Tyrrell, widow of Sir Robert Darcy ( - 2 November 1469) of Maldon, Essex, and daughter of Sir Thomas Tyrrell (d. 28 March 1477) of Heron in the parish of East Horndon, Essex (son of John Tyrrell).ii

==Career==
He was educated abroad and at the University of Cambridge. He quickly gained the favour of King Henry VIII (1509–1547), and in 1537 was appointed president of a commission of enquiry into the condition of Ireland. In the course of this work, he obtained much useful knowledge of the country. In 1539, he was knighted and appointed Sheriff of Kent.

===Lord Deputy of Ireland===
On 7 July 1540, Sir Anthony was appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland and tasked with the repression of disorder. He moved against the MacMorrough-Kavanagh clan, who had long claimed the title of King of Leinster, permitting them to retain their lands only by accepting feudal tenure on the English model. By a similar policy, he exacted obedience from the O&#x27;Mores, O&#x27;Tooles and O&#x27;Conors in Leix and Offaly. Having conciliated the O&#x27;Briens in the west and the Earl of Desmond in the south, he obtained the passage of an act in the Irish Parliament in Dublin, which conferred the title of King of Ireland on King Henry VIII and his heirs. Conn O&#x27;Neill, who had remained sullenly hostile, was forced to submit. The policy was adopted and became known as &quot;Surrender and regrant&quot;.

St Leger&#x27;s policy was generally one of moderation and conciliation, more so than Henry VIII wished. He recommended the head of the House of O&#x27;Brien, when he gave token of a submissive disposition, for the title of Earl of Thomond. O&#x27;Neill was created Earl of Tyrone. At St Leger&#x27;s urging, the King in 1541 created six new Irish peerages. St Leger argued that the loyalty of the Anglo-Irish nobility could be better achieved &quot;by small gifts and honest persuasion than by rigor&quot;, which seems to be an implicit criticism of the savage manner in which the Rebellion of Silken Thomas had been suppressed. St Leger&#x27;s policy of conciliation seems to have been successful: in particular, the Plunkett family, who received the title of Baron Louth, became steadfast loyalists to the English Crown, as did the Fitzpatrick family, who received the title of Baron Upper Ossory. Barnaby Fitzpatrick, 2nd Baron Upper Ossory grew up at Henry VIII&#x27;s court, and he was a beloved childhood friend of Henry&#x27;s son, Edward VI.

An administrative council was instituted in the province of Munster, and in 1544, a levy of Irish soldiers was raised for service in Henry VIII&#x27;s wars. St Leger&#x27;s personal influence was proved by an outbreak of disturbance when he visited England in 1544, and the prompt restoration of order upon his return some months later. St Leger retained his office under King Edward VI (1547–1553), and again effectively quelled attempts at rebellion by the O&#x27;Conors and O&#x27;Byrnes. From 1548 to 1550, Sir Anthony was in England and returned to Ireland charged with the duty of introducing the reformed liturgy to that island. His conciliatory methods led to his recall in the summer of 1551. After the accession of Queen Mary (1553–1558), he was again appointed Lord Deputy in October 1553, but a charge of keeping false accounts caused him to be recalled for the third time in 1556. He died while the accusation was still under investigation, by which time, in 1559, he had been elected Member of Parliament for Kent.

==Knight of the Garter==

In 1544, he was nominated by King Henry VIII as a Knight of the Garter. His Garter stall plate survives, affixed to his former stall in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle. It is inscribed above with the motto: &quot;SOMIENE DE MOY DIEN&quot; (apparently garbled French, possibly for &quot;souviens de mon dieu&quot;, &quot;I remember my God&quot;?) and at the base in semi-illiterate French (i.e. with basic errors in gender):

The heraldry shows an escutcheon circumscribed by the Garter displaying the arms quarterly 1 &amp; 4: &quot;Azure fretty argent&quot; (St Ledger); 2 &amp; 3: &quot;Argent, three barnacles gules tied sable&quot; (Donet of Sileham, Rainham, Kent). Sir Anthony&#x27;s great-grandfather Sir John St Leger (d.1442) of Ulcombe, married Margery Donet (or Donnet), daughter and heiress of James Donet (d.1409) of Sileham. His crest is shown as: &quot;A griffin statant&quot; (Crest of St Leger family, Viscount Doneraile: &quot;A griffin passant or&quot; (Debrett&#x27;s Peerage, 1968, p. 365)) and his supporters: &quot;Two griffins wings elevated&quot; (supporters of St Leger family, Viscount Doneraile: &quot;Two griffins or wings elevated azure fretty argent&quot; (Debrett&#x27;s Peerage, 1968, p. 365)).

==Character==
St Leger seems to have been a quarrelsome and unpopular man; certainly, he was on very bad terms with other leading figures in the Dublin administration, particularly John Alan, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and George Browne, Archbishop of Dublin. Following complaints by St Leger, Alan was removed from office and although he was later reinstated, the two men found it impossible to work together. Archbishop Browne accused St. Leger of treasonable words, giving Alan as his source, but the charge came to nothing when Alan, surprisingly, refused to confirm the report. When St Leger gave high military command to James Butler, 9th Earl of Ormond, he was accused by allies of Alan&#x27;s of deliberately doing this to endanger Ormond&#x27;s life. Ormond&#x27;s mysterious death from poisoning in London in 1546, with 16 of his household, when he went to dinner in the Ely Palace was, at the least, extremely convenient for St Leger, although there is no real evidence that he was responsible for it. Suspicion lingered because there was no proper investigation of the death, despite Ormond&#x27;s wealth and social standing.

==Landholdings==

As well as having inherited the paternal estate of Ulcombe, the St Leger family&#x27;s seat from the 11th century, in 1552, he was granted possession of Leeds Castle in Kent, of which his grandfather Ralph I St Leger (d.1470) had been a constable.

==Marriage and progeny==
St Leger married Agnes Warham, daughter of Sir Hugh Warham of Croydon by Marion, daughter of Geoffrey Colle, and niece of William Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury.

By Agnes, he had at least five sons and two daughters, including:
*William St Leger, who predeceased his father, albeit having left a son Sir Warham St Leger (d. 1600), whose own son was William St Leger (d. 1642), President of Munster.
*Warham St Leger

<doc id="297825" wikidata="Q940404" url="?curid=297825" title="Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria">
<text>Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria (, ) (died 31 May 1076) was the last of the Anglo-Saxon earls and the only English aristocrat to be executed during the reign of William I.

==Early life==
Waltheof was the second son of Siward, Earl of Northumbria. His mother was Aelfflaed, daughter of Ealdred, Earl of Bernicia, son of Uhtred, Earl of Northumbria. In 1054, Waltheof&#x27;s brother, Osbeorn, who was much older than he, was killed in battle, making Waltheof his father&#x27;s heir. Siward himself died in 1055, and Waltheof being far too young to succeed as Earl of Northumbria, King Edward appointed Tostig Godwinson to the earldom.

Waltheof was said to be devout and charitable and was probably educated for a monastic life. Around 1065, however, he became an earl, governing Northamptonshire and Huntingdonshire. Following the Battle of Hastings he submitted to William and was allowed to keep his pre-Conquest title and possessions. He remained at William&#x27;s court until 1068.

==First revolt==
When Sweyn II invaded Northern England in 1069, Waltheof and Edgar Aetheling joined the Danes and took part in the attack on York. He would again make a fresh submission to William after the departure of the invaders in 1070. He was restored to his earldom, and went on to marry William&#x27;s niece, Judith of Lens. In 1071, he was appointed Earl of Northampton.

The Domesday Book of 1086 mentions Waltheof (&quot;Walleff&quot;): &quot;&#x27;In Hallam [&quot;Halun&quot;], one manor with its sixteen hamlets, there are twenty-nine &quot;carucates&quot; [~14 km²] to be taxed. There Earl Waltheof had an &quot;Aula&quot; [hall or court]. There may have been about twenty ploughs. This land Roger de Busli holds of the Countess Judith&quot; (Hallam, or Hallamshire, is now part of the city of Sheffield).

In 1072, William expelled Gospatric from the earldom of Northumbria. Gospatric was Waltheof&#x27;s cousin and had taken part in the attack on York with him, but like Waltheof, had been pardoned by William. Gospatric fled into exile and William appointed Waltheof as the new earl. Construction of Durham Castle began under Waltheof in 1072 after receiving orders to commence this project from William. The castle would be significantly expanded by Bishop Walcher and his successors in later years.

Waltheof had many enemies in the north. Amongst them was the family of Thurbrand the Hold; Thurbrand had killed Waltheof&#x27;s great-grandfather, Uhtred the Bold, starting a long-running blood-feud that had resulted in the deaths of many members of both families. In 1074, Waltheof made a decisive move by sending his retainers to ambush his rivals, succeeding in killing the two eldest of four brothers.

==Second revolt and execution==
In 1075 Waltheof was said to have joined the Revolt of the Earls against William. His motives for taking part in the revolt are unclear, as is the depth of his involvement. Some sources say that he told his wife - the Countess Judith - about the plot and that she then informed Archbishop Lanfranc who then told his uncle William, who was at the time in Normandy. Other sources say that it was Waltheof who told the bishop of the plot. On William&#x27;s return from Normandy, Waltheof was arrested, brought twice before the king&#x27;s court and sentenced to death.

He spent almost a year in confinement before being beheaded on 31 May 1076 at St. Giles&#x27;s Hill, near Winchester. He was said to have spent the months of his captivity in prayer and fasting. Many people believed in his innocence and were surprised when the execution was carried out. His body was initially thrown into a ditch, but was later retrieved and buried in the chapter house of Crowland Abbey in Lincolnshire. Despite confessing to his part in the rebellion, one contributing factor in his execution for treason was that his wife, and William&#x27;s niece, Judith, did not like him or trust his loyalty to William.

An otherwise unknown Norse poet, Þorkell Skallason, composed a memorial poem—&quot;Valþjófsflokkr&quot;—for Waltheof, his lord. Two stanzas of this poem are preserved in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, &quot;Hulda-Hrokkinskinna&quot; and, partially, &quot;Fagrskinna&quot;. The first of the two stanzas says that Waltheof made a hundred retainers of William burn in hot fire - &quot;a scorching evening for the men&quot; - and wolves ate the corpses of the Normans. The second says that William betrayed Waltheof and had him killed.

==Cult of martyrdom==

In 1092, after a fire in the chapter house, the abbot had Waltheof&#x27;s body moved to a prominent place in the abbey church. When the coffin was opened, it is reported that the corpse was found to be intact with the severed head re-joined to the trunk. This was regarded as a miracle, and the abbey, which had a financial interest in the matter began to publicise it. As a result, pilgrims began to visit Waltheof&#x27;s tomb. He was commemorated on 31 August.

After a few years, healing miracles were reputed to occur in the vicinity of Waltheof&#x27;s tomb, often involving the restoration of the pilgrim&#x27;s lost sight. They are described in the &quot;Miracula Sancti Waldevi&quot;. Waltheof&#x27;s life thus became the subject of popular media, heroic but inaccurate accounts being preserved in the &quot;Vita et Passio Waldevi comitis&quot;, a Middle English &quot;Waltheof saga&quot;, since lost, and the Anglo-Norman &quot;Roman de Waldef&quot;.

==Family and children==
In 1070 Waltheof married Countess Judith de Lens, daughter of Lambert II, Count of Lens and Adelaide of Normandy, Countess of Aumale. Countess Judith was the niece of William the Conqueror. Waltheof and Judith had three children: 
* Maud de Lens aka Matilda (1074–1130), the eldest, took the earldom of Huntingdon to her second husband, David I of Scotland.
* Judith (1075–1137) 
* Adelese (Alice of Northumbria) (c. 1075/76–1126), married the Anglo-Norman noble Raoul III of Tosny.

One of Waltheof&#x27;s grandsons was Saint Waltheof (died 1159), abbot of Melrose.

==In popular culture==
* Waltheof was portrayed by actor Marcus Gilbert in the TV drama &quot;Blood Royal: William the Conqueror&quot; (1990).
* Waltheof is the subject of Juliet Dymoke&#x27;s 1970 historical novel &quot;Of the Ring of Earls&quot;
* Waltheof is a major character in Elizabeth Chadwick&#x27;s 2002 historical novel &quot;The Winter Mantle&quot;
* Waltheof is a character in Parke Godwin&#x27;s 1991 historical novel &quot;Sherwood&quot;

<text>Thomas or John Carte (1686–1754) was an English historian with Jacobite sympathies, who served as a Church of England clergyman.
== Life ==

Carte was born in 1686 near Clifton upon Dunsmore (itself near Rugby), the eldest son of the antiquarian Samuel Carte. He matriculated at University College, Oxford in 1698, and took his degree from Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1702, and an MA from King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1706.

Carte first became known for the controversy that opposed him to Henry Chandler, father of Samuel Chandler, regarding the role played by King Charles I in the Irish Rebellion of 1641. This controversy started with a sermon Carte preached at the Abbey Church in Bath in 1714, where he was a reader. In this sermon Carte defended King Charles I against the accusation that he was in league with Phelim O&#x27;Neill who pretended to act on a (probably false) royal commission issued.

His attachment to the Stuarts also caused him to remain a non-juror. He was ordained around 1714, and in that year refused to take the Oath of Allegiance. On the discovery of the plot of Francis Atterbury, whose secretary he was, he was accused of high treason in 1722 and was forced to flee to France adopting the name of Philips.

There he collected materials for illustrating a London edition of the &quot;Historium sui temporis&quot; of Jacques Auguste de Thou planned by Samuel Buckley. These materials were purchased and published by Richard Mead. Carte was pardoned and recalled to England in 1728 through the influence of Queen Caroline. Carte held the rectory in Yattendon, Berkshire, during the later part of his life.

Richard Mead made it possible for Carte and Samuel Buckley to publish the London edition of de Thou&#x27;s Latin History in 1733.

He started work on the &quot;Life of James Duke of Ormond&quot;. He obtained an important collection of letters from Charles Butler, 1st Earl of Arran. He published the letters in 1735 as volume 3 so that references could be made to them with correct page numbers. He then published volumes 1 and 2 in 1736.

He then started work on a &quot;General History of England&quot; as an improvement on Paul de Rapin&#x27;s &quot;Histoire d&#x27;Angleterre&quot;. Carte published volume 1 in 1747, volume 2 in 1750 and volume 3 in 1752. Volume 4 was published in 1755 after his death. He lost the trust of many of his patrons by including an anecdote about a miraculous healing of King&#x27;s Evil by royal touch, given by the &quot;Old Pretender&quot; in the first volume.

He died on 2 April 1754. He was buried in the church at Yattendon.

<text>Captain Philip Gidley King (23 April 1758 – 3 September 1808) was a Royal Navy officer and colonial administrator who served as the governor of New South Wales from 1800 to 1806. When the First Fleet arrived in January 1788, King was detailed to colonise Norfolk Island for defence and foraging purposes. As Governor of New South Wales, he helped develop livestock farming, whaling and mining, built many schools and launched the colony&#x27;s first newspaper. But conflicts with the military wore down his spirit, and they were able to force his resignation. King Street in the Sydney CBD is named in his honour.

==Early years and establishment of Norfolk Island settlement==
Philip Gidley King was born at Launceston, England on 23 April 1758, the son of draper Philip King, and grandson of Exeter attorney-at-law John Gidley. He joined the Royal Navy at the age of 12 as captain&#x27;s servant, and was commissioned as a lieutenant in 1778. King served under Arthur Phillip who chose him as second lieutenant on HMS &quot;Sirius&quot; for the expedition to establish a convict settlement in New South Wales. On arrival, in January 1788, King was selected to lead a small party of convicts and guards to set up a settlement at Norfolk Island, leaving Sydney on 14 February 1788 on board HMS &quot;Sirius.&quot;

On 6 March 1788, King and his party landed with difficulty, owing to the lack of a suitable harbour, and set about building huts, clearing the land, planting crops, and resisting the ravages of grubs, salt air and hurricanes. More convicts were sent, and these proved occasionally troublesome. Early in 1789 he prevented a mutiny when some of the convicts planned to take him and other officers prisoner, and escape on the next boat to arrive. Whilst commandant on Norfolk Island, King formed a relationship with the female convict Ann Inett—their first son, born on 8 January 1789, was named Norfolk. (He went on to become the first Australian-born officer in the Royal Navy and the captain of the schooner &quot;Ballahoo&quot;.) Another son was born in 1790 and named Sydney.

Following the wreck of &quot;Sirius&quot; at Norfolk Island in March 1790, King left and returned to England to report on the difficulties of the settlements at New South Wales. Ann Inett was left in Sydney with the boys; she later married another man in 1792, and went on to lead a comfortable and respected life in the colony. King, who had probably arranged the marriage, also arranged for their two sons to be educated in England, where they became officers in the navy. Whilst in England King married Anna Josepha Coombe (his first cousin) on 11 March 1791 and returned shortly after on HMS &quot;Gorgon&quot; to take up his post as Lieutenant-Governor of Norfolk Island, at an annual salary of £250. King&#x27;s first legitimate offspring, Phillip Parker King, was born there in December 1791, and four daughters followed.

On his return to Norfolk Island, King found the population of nearly one thousand torn apart by discontent after the strict regime of Major Robert Ross. However, he set about enthusiastically to improve conditions. He encouraged settlers, drawn from ex-convicts and ex-marines, and he listened to their views on wages and prices. By 1794 the island was self-sufficient in grain, and surplus swine were being sent to Sydney. The number of people living off the government store was high, and few settlers wanted to leave. In February 1794 King was faced with unfounded allegations by members of the New South Wales Corps on the island that he was punishing them too severely and ex-convicts too lightly when disputes arose. As their conduct became mutinous, he sent twenty of them to Sydney for trial by court-martial. There Lieutenant-Governor Francis Grose censured King&#x27;s actions and issued orders which gave the military illegal authority over the civilian population. Grose later apologised, but conflict with the military continued to plague King.

==Governor of New South Wales==
Suffering from gout, King returned to England in October 1796, and after regaining his health, and resuming his naval career, he was appointed to replace Captain John Hunter as the third Governor of New South Wales. King became governor on 28 September 1800. He set about changing the system of administration, and appointed Major Joseph Foveaux as Lieutenant-Governor of Norfolk Island. His first task was to attack the misconduct of officers of the New South Wales Corps in their illicit trading in liquor, notably rum. He tried to discourage the importation of liquor, and began to construct a brewery. However, he found the refusal of convicts to work in their own time for other forms of payment, and the continued illicit local distillation, increasingly difficult to control. He continued to face military arrogance and disobedience from the New South Wales Corps. He failed to receive support in England when he sent an accused officer John Macarthur back to face a court-martial.

King had some successes. His regulations for prices, wages, hours of work, financial deals and the employment of convicts brought some relief to smallholders, and reduced the numbers &#x27;on the stores&#x27;. He encouraged construction of barracks, wharves, bridges, houses, etc. Government flocks and herds greatly increased, and he encouraged experiments with vines, tobacco, cotton, hemp and indigo. Whaling and sealing became important sources of oil and skins, and coal mining began. He took an interest in education, establishing schools to teach convict boys to become skilled tradesmen. He encouraged smallpox vaccinations, was sympathetic to missionaries, strove to keep peace with the indigenous inhabitants, ordered the printing of Australia&#x27;s first book, &quot;New South Wales General Standing Orders&quot;, and encouraged the first newspaper, the &quot;Sydney Gazette&quot;. Exploration led to the survey of Bass Strait and Western Port, and the discovery of Port Phillip, and settlements were established at Hobart and Port Dalrymple in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land.

While still aware that Sydney was a convict colony and always alert to the ebb and flow of the rebellious Irish political prisoners he established his own body guard. He gave opportunities to emancipists, considering that ex-convicts should not remain in disgrace forever. He appointed emancipists to positions of responsibility, regulated the position of assigned servants, and laid the foundation of the &#x27;ticket of leave&#x27; system for deserving prisoners. For a period he allowed toleration of Catholics, permitting Fr James Dixon to say mass for Irish convicts. Although he directly profited from a number of commercial deals, cattle sales, and land grants, he was modest in his dealings compared with most of his subordinates. Most famously he quelled the Castle Hill Rebellion in March 1804. The increased animosity between King and the New South Wales Corps led to his resignation and replacement by William Bligh in 1806, and he returned to England. Here his health failed and he died on 3 September 1808.

Although he worked hard for the good of New South Wales and left it very much better than he found it, the abuse from the officers harmed his reputation, and illness and the hard conditions of his service eventually wore him down. Of all the members of the First Fleet, Philip Gidley King perhaps made the greatest contribution to the early years of the colony.

==Artist==
King is also remembered for his art works, several of which survive. An engraving by William Blake, entitled &quot;A Native Family of New South Wales&quot;, and published in John Hunter&#x27;s &quot;Historical Journal of the Transactions at Port Jackson and Norfolk Island&quot; (1793) was made from one of his watercolors. The original sketch is among the Banks Papers held by the Mitchell Library, Sydney, along with several others, unsigned but clearly by the same artist.

==Recognition==
King Street is a street in Sydney’s central business district. It starts at King Street Wharf on Darling Harbour in the west and goes to Queens Square in the East.

King Street was named after Governor Phillip Gidley King.

The top end of King Street has been home to the legal profession since Governor Macquaie established the Supreme Court next to St James’ Church. King Street was also closely positioned to newspaper buildings and to pubs, clubs and theatres.
According to “Australian Bird Names: A Complete Guide” by Jeannie Gray &amp; Ian Fraser, the name King’s Parrot was proposed by George Caley to honour Governor Philip Gidley King (Governor of New South Wales from 1800-1806).

<doc id="297834" wikidata="Q5105167" url="?curid=297834" title="Chorley FM">
<text>Chorley FM was a radio station based in Chorley, Lancashire, England. The station was created by volunteers back in 2001 to broadcast a special two week licence in conjunction with the Midsummer Festival which was located on Botany Bay near the M61.

==History==
The name &quot;Chorley FM&quot; is commonly associated with a fictional radio station featured in the comedy programmes &quot;That Peter Kay Thing&quot;, &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot; and &quot;Max and Paddy&#x27;s Road to Nowhere&quot;. The fictional station uses a logo based on Century FM in the 1990s.

The real-life station Chorley FM, based at Steeley Lane in Chorley, operated for short periods of time each year from 2000 under a temporary licence (RSL).

On 9 September 2005, Chorley FM Limited was awarded a five-year licence to broadcast round the clock to the local community, and was extended for a further five years in 2011. It also broadcast worldwide via the Internet.

The station&#x27;s target objective was to broadcast to the local population and provide an opportunity to get involved and gain valuable experience in radio and the media.

Shortly after being granted its licence, Chorley FM created a competition in association with the Chorley Citizen newspaper, asking members of the community to design a logo for the station to use throughout its life, which was won by then 15-year-old, Rhys Griffiths. The logo, however, was changed to the current station logo during a full station re-branding exercise completed in February 2008 and then another re-brand in January 2012.

The station launched its full live output on 24 November 2006 on the frequency 102.8 FM, as well as streaming online via the station website.

In February 2008 Chorley FM saw a re-launch and implemented a new daytime music policy consisting of modern chart music, R&amp;B, commercial dance, Indie rock and a few 80s, 90s chart classics. As of May 2011, the music policy relaxed, playing a wider variety of music. From 6pm, more specialist shows are common-place, comprising many forms of Dance music not covered by other radio stations including underground House, Old Skool / Retro House, Garage, Techno, Scouse House, Drum &amp; Bass and Hardstyle. Other shows include the Flat Iron Show (featuring local unsigned bands), a Rock music show, Folk and Irish Music show, Camp classics &amp; 80&#x27;s Anthems and a sports show.

Chorley FM identified two objective target audiences. 15 to 25 year olds and the local LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender) community. In late 2007, Chorley FM won the &#x27;Community Service Award&#x27; at the National LGBT Health Summit and drew particular mention to the &#x27;Breakout&#x27; Show targeted at the LGBT community of Chorley. More LGBT Programmes were included in the schedule, such as &#x27;Camp Classics &amp; 80&#x27;s Anthems&#x27; which played mainly 80s music from the LGBT scene.

In late 2008 Chorley FM worked in Conjunction with Search for a Star (Launched as a joint project with the Daily Star), a talent contest in partnership with Bobby Ball and Casey-Lee Jolleys. The show, hosted by Chorley FM&#x27;s Nathan Hill and Steven Normyle with celebrity judges that included Bobby Ball, Casey-Lee Jolleys, X-Factor&#x27;s Rowetta and Garry Bushell. Live theatre style shows took place weekly on the Blackpool North Pier.

2009 saw the station continue to grow with some media attention; including a number of inclusions in reports on Granada Reports and a behind-the-scenes look into volunteering as a young person at Chorley FM as part of the national BBC Blast project.

In 2011 the station was awarded a five-year renewal of its community radio licence.

In 2014 Ofcom told the station that it was not meeting its key commitments. Ofcom&#x27;s interpretation of the commitments was that the station should exclusively serve the two target groups. The station announced dialogue with Ofcom regarding a change to the original commitments, on the basis that it was always intended to include specific content for the target groups within a diverse schedule rather than all output be exclusively for them.

From March 2015 the station began broadcasting commentary from Chorley F.C. games, linking in with internet-based &quot;Magpies Live&quot;, to further their involvement in the local community. This was welcomed by the local community and the town, and will continue to give coverage to the &quot;Magpies&quot; throughout the 2015/16 season, and beyond, in the Vanarama National League North.

Also in 2015 Ofcom approved changes to the key commitments broadening the target audience to include the whole population of Chorley. New shows and community features including Business Lunch were rolled out.

==Closure==
The station&#x27;s broadcasting equipment was made out of bounds and broadcasting ceased unexpectedly after a statement was released by the managing director on 1 August. On 14 August 2019, Chorley FM officially surrendered its community radio licence to Ofcom, ending the station&#x27;s ability to come back on air. This followed a police investigation into allegations of sexual assault at the station that had not been investigated by the Managing Director at the time. Mr Stuart Clutton was contacted for comment on the matter by the local press but issued a no comment response. The complaint made by a former director of the station also included several complaints of sexual harassment.

The former Chorley FM transmitter location and 102.8 FM frequency were brought back into use in May 2021, to relocate the Chorley relay of Capital Manchester and Lancashire, which was previously broadcast at 96.3 FM from Whitehouse Farm.

==New Station for Chorley==
On 1 September 2023 a new radio station launched on DAB+ with programming aimed at Chorley as Central Radio North West - across Chorley and Leyland and Chorley areas of Lancashire, featuring local news, talk, and music.

<doc id="297839" wikidata="Q185918" url="?curid=297839" title="Time dilation">
<text>Time dilation is the difference in elapsed time as measured by two clocks, either because of a relative velocity between them (special relativity), or a difference in gravitational potential between their locations (general relativity). When unspecified, &quot;time dilation&quot; usually refers to the effect due to velocity.

After compensating for varying signal delays resulting from the changing distance between an observer and a moving clock (i.e. Doppler effect), the observer will measure the moving clock as ticking more slowly than a clock at rest in the observer&#x27;s own reference frame. There is a difference between observed and measured relativistic time dilation - the observer does not visually perceive time dilation in the same way that they measure it. In addition, a clock that is close to a massive body (and which therefore is at lower gravitational potential) will record less elapsed time than a clock situated farther from the same massive body (and which is at a higher gravitational potential). 

These predictions of the theory of relativity have been repeatedly confirmed by experiment, and they are of practical concern, for instance in the operation of satellite navigation systems such as GPS and Galileo.

==History==
Time dilation by the Lorentz factor was predicted by several authors at the turn of the 20th century. Joseph Larmor (1897) wrote that, at least for those orbiting a nucleus, individual electrons describe corresponding parts of their orbits in times shorter for the [rest] system in the ratio: formula_1. Emil Cohn (1904) specifically related this formula to the rate of clocks. In the context of special relativity it was shown by Albert Einstein (1905) that this effect concerns the nature of time itself, and he was also the first to point out its reciprocity or symmetry. Subsequently, Hermann Minkowski (1907) introduced the concept of proper time which further clarified the meaning of time dilation.
==Time dilation caused by a relative velocity==
Special relativity indicates that, for an observer in an inertial frame of reference, a clock that is moving relative to the observer will be measured to tick more slowly than a clock at rest in the observer&#x27;s frame of reference. This is sometimes called special relativistic time dilation. The faster the relative velocity, the greater the time dilation between them, with time slowing to a stop as one clock approaches the speed of light (299,792,458 m/s).

In theory, time dilation would make it possible for passengers in a fast-moving vehicle to advance into the future in a short period of their own time. With sufficiently high speeds, the effect would be dramatic. For example, one year of travel might correspond to ten years on Earth. Indeed, a constant 1 g acceleration would permit humans to travel through the entire known Universe in one human lifetime.

With current technology severely limiting the velocity of space travel, the differences experienced in practice are minuscule. After 6 months on the International Space Station (ISS), orbiting Earth at a speed of about 7,700 m/s, an astronaut would have aged about 0.005 seconds less than he would have on Earth. The cosmonauts Sergei Krikalev and Sergey Avdeev both experienced time dilation of about 20 milliseconds compared to time that passed on Earth.
===Simple inference===

Time dilation can be inferred from the observed constancy of the speed of light in all reference frames dictated by the second postulate of special relativity. This constancy of the speed of light means that, counter to intuition, the speeds of material objects and light are not additive. It is not possible to make the speed of light appear greater by moving towards or away from the light source.

Consider then, a simple vertical clock consisting of two mirrors and , between which a light pulse is bouncing. The separation of the mirrors is and the clock ticks once each time the light pulse hits mirror .

In the frame in which the clock is at rest (see left part of the diagram), the light pulse traces out a path of length and the time period between the ticks of the clock formula_2 is equal to divided by the speed of light : 
:formula_3

From the frame of reference of a moving observer traveling at the speed relative to the resting frame of the clock (right part of diagram), the light pulse is seen as tracing out a longer, angled path . Keeping the speed of light constant for all inertial observers requires a lengthening (that is dilation) of the time period between the ticks of this clock formula_4 from the moving observer&#x27;s perspective. That is to say, as measured in a frame moving relative to the local clock, this clock will be running (that is ticking) more slowly, since tick rate equals one over the time period between ticks 1/formula_4. 

Straightforward application of the Pythagorean theorem leads to the well-known prediction of special relativity:

The total time for the light pulse to trace its path is given by:
:formula_6
The length of the half path can be calculated as a function of known quantities as:
:formula_7
Elimination of the variables and from these three equations results in:
} = {\gamma}{\Delta t} &lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding =10
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}
which expresses the fact that the moving observer&#x27;s period of the clock formula_4 is longer than the period formula_2 in the frame of the clock itself. The Lorentz factor gamma () is defined as
:formula_10
Because all clocks that have a common period in the resting frame should have a common period when observed from the moving frame, all other clocksmechanical, electronic, optical (such as an identical horizontal version of the clock in the example)should exhibit the same velocity-dependent time dilation.

===Reciprocity===

Given a certain frame of reference, and the &quot;stationary&quot; observer described earlier, if a second observer accompanied the &quot;moving&quot; clock, each of the observers would measure the other&#x27;s clock as ticking at a &quot;slower&quot; rate than their own local clock, due to them both measure the other to be the one that is in motion relative to their own stationary frame of reference.

Common sense would dictate that, if the passage of time has slowed for a moving object, said object would observe the external world&#x27;s time to be correspondingly sped up. Counterintuitively, special relativity predicts the opposite. When two observers are in motion relative to each other, each will measure the other&#x27;s clock slowing down, in concordance with them being in motion relative to the observer&#x27;s frame of reference.
While this seems self-contradictory, a similar oddity occurs in everyday life. If two persons A and B observe each other from a distance, B will appear small to A, but at the same time, A will appear small to B. Being familiar with the effects of perspective, there is no contradiction or paradox in this situation.

The reciprocity of the phenomenon also leads to the so-called twin paradox where the aging of twins, one staying on Earth and the other embarking on space travel, is compared, and where the reciprocity suggests that both persons should have the same age when they reunite. On the contrary, at the end of the round-trip, the traveling twin will be younger than the sibling on Earth. The dilemma posed by the paradox can be explained by the fact that situation is not symmetric. The twin staying on Earth is in a single inertial frame, and the traveling twin is in two different inertial frames: one on the way out and another on the way back. See also .

===Experimental testing===
====Moving particles====

*A comparison of muon lifetimes at different speeds is possible. In the laboratory, slow muons are produced; and in the atmosphere, very fast-moving muons are introduced by cosmic rays. Taking the muon lifetime at rest as the laboratory value of 2.197 μs, the lifetime of a cosmic-ray-produced muon traveling at 98% of the speed of light is about five times longer, in agreement with observations. An example is Rossi and Hall (1941), who compared the population of cosmic-ray-produced muons at the top of a mountain to that observed at sea level.
*The lifetime of particles produced in particle accelerators are longer due to time dilation. In such experiments, the &quot;clock&quot; is the time taken by processes leading to muon decay, and these processes take place in the moving muon at its own &quot;clock rate&quot;, which is much slower than the laboratory clock. This is routinely taken into account in particle physics, and many dedicated measurements have been performed. For instance, in the muon storage ring at CERN the lifetime of muons circulating with γ = 29.327 was found to be dilated to 64.378 μs, confirming time dilation to an accuracy of 0.9 ± 0.4 parts per thousand.

====Doppler effect====

* The stated purpose by Ives and Stilwell (1938, 1941) of these experiments was to verify the time dilation effect, predicted by Larmor–Lorentz ether theory, due to motion through the ether using Einstein&#x27;s suggestion that Doppler effect in canal rays would provide a suitable experiment. These experiments measured the Doppler shift of the radiation emitted from cathode rays, when viewed from directly in front and from directly behind. The high and low frequencies detected were not the classically predicted values:formula_11The high and low frequencies of the radiation from the moving sources were measured as:formula_12as deduced by Einstein (1905) from the Lorentz transformation, when the source is running slow by the Lorentz factor.
* Hasselkamp, Mondry, and Scharmann (1979) measured the Doppler shift from a source moving at right angles to the line of sight. The most general relationship between frequencies of the radiation from the moving sources is given by:formula_13as deduced by Einstein (1905). For () this reduces to . This lower frequency from the moving source can be attributed to the time dilation effect and is often called the transverse Doppler effect and was predicted by relativity.
* In 2010 time dilation was observed at speeds of less than 10 metres per second using optical atomic clocks connected by 75 metres of optical fiber.

===Proper time and Minkowski diagram===
In the Minkowski diagram from the first image on the right, clock C resting in inertial frame S′ meets clock A at &quot;d&quot; and clock B at &quot;f&quot; (both resting in S). All three clocks simultaneously start to tick in S. The worldline of A is the ct-axis, the worldline of B intersecting &quot;f&quot; is parallel to the ct-axis, and the worldline of C is the ct′-axis. All events simultaneous with &quot;d&quot; in S are on the x-axis, in S′ on the x′-axis.

The proper time between two events is indicated by a clock present at both events. It is invariant, i.e., in all inertial frames it is agreed that this time is indicated by that clock. Interval &quot;df&quot; is, therefore, the proper time of clock C, and is shorter with respect to the coordinate times &quot;ef=dg&quot; of clocks B and A in S. Conversely, also proper time &quot;ef&quot; of B is shorter with respect to time &quot;if&quot; in S′, because event &quot;e&quot; was measured in S′ already at time &quot;i&quot; due to relativity of simultaneity, long before C started to tick.

From that it can be seen, that the proper time between two events indicated by an unaccelerated clock present at both events, compared with the synchronized coordinate time measured in all other inertial frames, is always the &quot;minimal&quot; time interval between those events. However, the interval between two events can also correspond to the proper time of accelerated clocks present at both events. Under all possible proper times between two events, the proper time of the unaccelerated clock is &quot;maximal&quot;, which is the solution to the twin paradox.

===Derivation and formulation===
In addition to the light clock used above, the formula for time dilation can be more generally derived from the temporal part of the Lorentz transformation. Let there be two events at which the moving clock indicates formula_14 and formula_15, thus:
:formula_16

Since the clock remains at rest in its inertial frame, it follows formula_17, thus the interval formula_18 is given by:
:formula_19
where Δ&quot;t&quot; is the time interval between &quot;two co-local events&quot; (i.e. happening at the same place) for an observer in some inertial frame (e.g. ticks on their clock), known as the &quot;proper time&quot;, Δt′ is the time interval between those same events, as measured by another observer, inertially moving with velocity &quot;v&quot; with respect to the former observer, &quot;v&quot; is the relative velocity between the observer and the moving clock, &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light, and the Lorentz factor (conventionally denoted by the Greek letter gamma or γ) is:
:formula_20

Thus the duration of the clock cycle of a moving clock is found to be increased: it is measured to be &quot;running slow&quot;. The range of such variances in ordinary life, where even considering space travel, are not great enough to produce easily detectable time dilation effects and such vanishingly small effects can be safely ignored for most purposes. As an approximate threshold, time dilation may become important when an object approaches speeds on the order of 30,000 km/s (1/10 the speed of light).

===Hyperbolic motion===

In special relativity, time dilation is most simply described in circumstances where relative velocity is unchanging. Nevertheless, the Lorentz equations allow one to calculate proper time and movement in space for the simple case of a spaceship which is applied with a force per unit mass, relative to some reference object in uniform (i.e. constant velocity) motion, equal to &quot;g&quot; throughout the period of measurement.

Let &quot;t&quot; be the time in an inertial frame subsequently called the rest frame. Let &quot;x&quot; be a spatial coordinate, and let the direction of the constant acceleration as well as the spaceship&#x27;s velocity (relative to the rest frame) be parallel to the &quot;x&quot;-axis. Assuming the spaceship&#x27;s position at time being and the velocity being &quot;v&quot;0 and defining the following abbreviation:
:formula_21
the following formulas hold:

Position:
:formula_22

Velocity:
:formula_23

Proper time as function of coordinate time:
:formula_24

In the case where &quot;v&quot;(0) = &quot;v&quot;0 = 0 and &quot;τ&quot;(0) = &quot;τ&quot;0 = 0 the integral can be expressed as a logarithmic function or, equivalently, as an inverse hyperbolic function:
:formula_25

As functions of the proper time formula_26 of the ship, the following formulae hold:

Position:
:formula_27

Velocity:
:formula_28

Coordinate time as function of proper time:
:formula_29

===Clock hypothesis===
The clock hypothesis is the assumption that the rate at which a clock is affected by time dilation does not depend on its acceleration but only on its instantaneous velocity. This is equivalent to stating that a clock moving along a path formula_30 measures the proper time, defined by:
:formula_31

The clock hypothesis was implicitly (but not explicitly) included in Einstein&#x27;s original 1905 formulation of special relativity. Since then, it has become a standard assumption and is usually included in the axioms of special relativity, especially in light of experimental verification up to very high accelerations in particle accelerators.
==Time dilation caused by gravity or acceleration==

Gravitational time dilation is experienced by an observer that, at a certain altitude within a gravitational potential well, finds that their local clocks measure less elapsed time than identical clocks situated at higher altitude (and which are therefore at higher gravitational potential).

Gravitational time dilation is at play e.g. for ISS astronauts. While the astronauts&#x27; relative velocity slows down their time, the reduced gravitational influence at their location speeds it up, although to a lesser degree. Also, a climber&#x27;s time is theoretically passing slightly faster at the top of a mountain compared to people at sea level. It has also been calculated that due to time dilation, the core of the Earth is 2.5 years younger than the crust. &quot;A clock used to time a full rotation of the Earth will measure the day to be approximately an extra 10 ns/day longer for every km of altitude above the reference geoid.&quot; Travel to regions of space where extreme gravitational time dilation is taking place, such as near (but not beyond the event horizon of) a black hole, could yield time-shifting results analogous to those of near-lightspeed space travel.

Contrarily to velocity time dilation, in which both observers measure the other as aging slower (a reciprocal effect), gravitational time dilation is not reciprocal. This means that with gravitational time dilation both observers agree that the clock nearer the center of the gravitational field is slower in rate, and they agree on the ratio of the difference.

===Experimental testing===

* In 1959, Robert Pound and Glen Rebka measured the very slight gravitational redshift in the frequency of light emitted at a lower height, where Earth&#x27;s gravitational field is relatively more intense. The results were within 10% of the predictions of general relativity. In 1964, Pound and J. L. Snider measured a result within 1% of the value predicted by gravitational time dilation. (See Pound–Rebka experiment)
* In 2010, gravitational time dilation was measured at the Earth&#x27;s surface with a height difference of only one meter, using optical atomic clocks.

==Combined effect of velocity and gravitational time dilation==
High-accuracy timekeeping, low-Earth-orbit satellite tracking, and pulsar timing are applications that require the consideration of the combined effects of mass and motion in producing time dilation. Practical examples include the International Atomic Time standard and its relationship with the Barycentric Coordinate Time standard used for interplanetary objects.

Relativistic time dilation effects for the solar system and the Earth can be modeled very precisely by the Schwarzschild solution to the Einstein field equations. In the Schwarzschild metric, the interval formula_32 is given by:
:formula_33
where:
*formula_32 is a small increment of proper time formula_35 (an interval that could be recorded on an atomic clock),
*formula_36 is a small increment in the coordinate formula_37 (coordinate time),
*formula_38 are small increments in the three coordinates formula_39 of the clock&#x27;s position,
*formula_40 represents the sum of the Newtonian gravitational potentials due to the masses in the neighborhood, based on their distances formula_41 from the clock. This sum includes any tidal potentials.
The coordinate velocity of the clock is given by:
:formula_42

The coordinate time formula_37 is the time that would be read on a hypothetical &quot;coordinate clock&quot; situated infinitely far from all gravitational masses (formula_44), and stationary in the system of coordinates (). The exact relation between the rate of proper time and the rate of coordinate time for a clock with a radial component of velocity is:
:formula_45
where:
*formula_46 is the radial velocity,
*formula_47 is the escape speed,
*formula_48, formula_49 and formula_50 are velocities as a percentage of speed of light &quot;c&quot;,
*formula_51 is the Newtonian potential; hence formula_52 equals half the square of the escape speed.
The above equation is exact under the assumptions of the Schwarzschild solution. It reduces to velocity time dilation equation in the presence of motion and absence of gravity, i.e. formula_53. It reduces to gravitational time dilation equation in the absence of motion and presence of gravity, i.e. formula_54.

===Experimental testing===
* Hafele and Keating, in 1971, flew caesium atomic clocks east and west around the Earth in commercial airliners, to compare the elapsed time against that of a clock that remained at the U.S. Naval Observatory. Two opposite effects came into play. The clocks were expected to age more quickly (show a larger elapsed time) than the reference clock since they were in a higher (weaker) gravitational potential for most of the trip (c.f. Pound–Rebka experiment). But also, contrastingly, the moving clocks were expected to age more slowly because of the speed of their travel. From the actual flight paths of each trip, the theory predicted that the flying clocks, compared with reference clocks at the U.S. Naval Observatory, should have lost 40±23 nanoseconds during the eastward trip and should have gained 275±21 nanoseconds during the westward trip. Relative to the atomic time scale of the U.S. Naval Observatory, the flying clocks lost 59±10 nanoseconds during the eastward trip and gained 273±7 nanoseconds during the westward trip (where the error bars represent standard deviation). In 2005, the National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom reported their limited replication of this experiment. The NPL experiment differed from the original in that the caesium clocks were sent on a shorter trip (London–Washington, D.C. return), but the clocks were more accurate. The reported results are within 4% of the predictions of relativity, within the uncertainty of the measurements.
* The Global Positioning System can be considered a continuously operating experiment in both special and general relativity. The in-orbit clocks are corrected for both special and general relativistic time dilation effects as described above, so that (as observed from the Earth&#x27;s surface) they run at the same rate as clocks on the surface of the Earth.

==In popular culture==

Velocity and gravitational time dilation have been the subject of science fiction works in a variety of media. Some examples in film are the movies &quot;Interstellar&quot; and &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;. In &quot;Interstellar&quot;, a key plot point involves a planet, which is close to a rotating black hole and on the surface of which one hour is equivalent to seven years on Earth due to time dilation. Physicist Kip Thorne collaborated in making the film and explained its scientific concepts in the book &quot;The Science of Interstellar&quot;.

The Queen song &#x27;39 was written by astrophysicist as well as musician Brian May, and is centred around the time dilation effect on spacefarers searching for a new home for mankind, as we gradually ruin planet Earth. They return successful, only to find that all and everything they knew has long since passed away.

Time dilation was used in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes &quot;World Enough and Time&quot; and &quot;The Doctor Falls&quot;, which take place on a spaceship in the vicinity of a black hole. Due to the immense gravitational pull of the black hole and the ship&#x27;s length (400 miles), time moves faster at one end than the other. When The Doctor&#x27;s companion, Bill, gets taken away to the other end of the ship, she waits years for him to rescue her; in his time, only minutes pass. Furthermore, the dilation allows the Cybermen to evolve at a &quot;faster&quot; rate than previously seen in the show.
&quot;Tau Zero&quot;, a novel by Poul Anderson, is an early example of the concept in science fiction literature. In the novel, a spacecraft uses a Bussard ramjet to accelerate to high enough speeds that the crew spends five years on board, but thirty-three years pass on the Earth before they arrive at their destination. The velocity time dilation is explained by Anderson in terms of the tau factor which decreases closer and closer to zero as the ship approaches the speed of light—hence the title of the novel. Due to an accident, the crew is unable to stop accelerating the spacecraft, causing such extreme time dilation that the crew experiences the Big Crunch at the end of the universe. Other examples in literature, such as &quot;Rocannon&#x27;s World&quot;, &quot;Hyperion&quot; and &quot;The Forever War&quot;, similarly make use of relativistic time dilation as a scientifically plausible literary device to have certain characters age slower than the rest of the universe.

<text>The City of Botany Bay was a local government area in the Eastern Suburbs region of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. The area encompassed the suburbs to the north of Botany Bay, such as Botany. First proclaimed in 1888 as the &quot;Borough of Botany&quot;, the council became the &quot;Municipality of Botany&quot; from 1906 to 1996, when it was proclaimed a city as the &quot;City of Botany Bay&quot;.

The administrative centre was located at Mascot, which is south of the Sydney central business district. The city was amalgamated with the neighbouring City of Rockdale on 9 September 2016 to form Bayside Council. The last mayor of the City of Botany Bay prior to amalgamation was Cr. Ben Keneally, a member of the Labor Party and the husband of Kristina Keneally, a former Premier of New South Wales.

== Suburbs in the local government area ==
Suburbs in the City of Botany Bay were:
* Banksmeadow
* Botany
* Botany Bay
* Daceyville
* Eastgardens
* Eastlakes
* Hillsdale
* Mascot (minor part located within Marrickville Council)
* Pagewood (parts are located in City of Randwick council)
* Rosebery (parts are located in City of Sydney council)

==History==

First proclaimed in 1888 as the &quot;Borough of Botany&quot;, the first council, divided into three wards (Booralee Ward, Cook Ward, Banks Ward), was elected on 9 June 1888. On 15 July 1899, the Botany Town Hall, designed by Byera Hadley, was opened by the governor, Lord Beauchamp. The town hall remained the seat and primary meeting-place of the council until amalgamation in 2016.

The council became the &quot;Municipality of Botany&quot; from 1906 to 11 May 1996, when it was proclaimed a city as the &quot;City of Botany Bay&quot; by the Governor of New South Wales, Gordon Samuels at Sir Joseph Banks Park in Botany. The council wards were abolished from 31 January 1908. Under the Local Government (Areas) Act 1948, the Municipality of Mascot (formerly North Botany), which was located immediately to the North, was amalgamated into Botany.

===ICAC Operation Ricco===
In February 2016, the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) commenced a public inquiry (known as Operation Ricco) into allegations that the former chief financial officer employed by the council and other council employees, dishonestly exercised official functions to obtain financial benefits for themselves and others by causing fraudulent payments of more than 4.2 million to be made by the council through false invoicing to either themselves, or various entities. It was also alleged that the former chief financial officer and the council employees dishonestly exercised official functions to obtain financial benefits for themselves and others by using council resources. The inquiry heard that certain senior staff were &quot;totally unqualified&quot; for their positions, and that a culture of &quot;extremely poor corporate governance&quot; allowed official corruption to occur.

It was also revealed that the council&#x27;s General Manager until 2011, Peter Fitzgerald, had used thousands of dollars in &quot;discretionary&quot; council funds for personal items, private travel for himself and family, in addition to receiving annual cheques for $20,000 from the council for travelling expenses. Fitzgerald admitted that he had not seen a single statement for any of his council accounts until shortly before his retirement in 2011, and was not aware if he had exceeded those &quot;discretionary&quot; limits.

In July 2017, ICAC released its report and found that former chief financial officer, Gary Goodman, and eleven other council employees had acted corruptly, after raising more than $5 million in fake invoices and charging more than $600,000 in personal expenditure on council credit cards, and recommended prosecutions against all. However, despite the specific findings against individuals, the final report noted in particular that &quot;The scale, breadth and duration of corruption at the Council cannot be attributed to a few rogue individuals alone. Overwhelming failures in the Council’s procedures and governance framework created significant opportunities for corruption, and Mr Goodman and others took full advantage.&quot;

With the merger of Botany Bay into Bayside Council in September 2016, the legacy of &quot;significant breakdowns in administrative, financial and governance internal controls identified in the former council&quot; had ramifications for the auditing and accounting processes in the new Council with the Council stating that it was unable &quot;to ensure completeness of [their] financial statements as a whole&quot;, and the first mayor of Bayside Council, Bill Saravinovski, in particular noted that, &quot;the misappropriations and costs of remediation result in a net fund deficit of $17 million, placing Bayside Council at a significant disadvantage&quot;.

===Creation of Bayside Council===
A 2015 review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal recommended that the City of Botany Bay merge with the City of Rockdale to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately .

There was significant community opposition to the merger from within both communities. In Botany Bay, residents were given the chance to have their say in a community poll which was held on 27 February 2016. Ultimately 97.8 per cent of Botany Bay residents voted &#x27;no&#x27; when asked the question &#x27;Do you agree that the City of Botany Bay should merge with Rockdale City Council?&#x27;. Botany Bay attempted to seek a compromise by proposing to merge with the City of Randwick and parts of the City of Sydney.

With the proclamation of the majority of council amalgamations on 12 May 2016, Botany Bay Council appealed the decision in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, thereby delaying the proposed amalgamation until a decision was made by the Court. The Supreme Court rejected the appeal in early September 2016, and the Minister for Local Government, Paul Toole, moved quickly to proclaim the formation of Bayside Council on 9 September 2016, with the former administrator of Central Darling Shire, Greg Wright, appointed as the Administrator.

== Demographics ==
As of the 2011 census, there were 39,356 people in the Botany Bay local government area, of these 49.5% were male and 50.5% were female. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.6% of the population. The median age of people in the City of Botany Bay was 37 years. Children aged 0 – 14 years made up 18.2% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 14.4% of the population. Of people in the area aged 15 years and over, 47.6% were married and 11.4% were either divorced or separated.

Population growth in the City of Botany Bay between the 2001 census and the 2006 census was 5.18%; and in the subsequent five years to the 2011 census, population growth was 5.19%. When compared with total population growth of Australia for the same periods, being 5.78% and 8.32% respectively, population growth in Botany Bay local government area was lower than the national average.

== Council ==
===Final composition and election method===

Botany Bay City Council was composed of seven councillors, including the mayor, for a fixed four-year term of office. The mayor was directly elected for a four-year term from 1995 to 2016 while the six other Councillors were elected proportionally as six separate wards, each electing one councillor. From 1948 to 1995 the council consisted of 15 councillors/aldermen, with three elected in each of five wards. From 1995 to 2008, the councillors were elected at-large and from 2008 to 2012 the councillors were elected to three wards (A, B, C), with two councillors elected in each. The most recent election was held on 8 September 2012. In Wards One and Five, only one candidate nominated for election. There being no additional candidates, the election for these Wards was uncontested. The final makeup of the council at the last election for the term 2012–2016, including the mayor, was as follows:

==Town Clerks/General Managers==
The Local Government Act, 1993 removed the requirement that the administrative head of a council be a &quot;Town or Shire Clerk&quot; and specified that the head was to be known as the &quot;General Manager&quot;.
