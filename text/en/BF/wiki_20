<text>The A40 is a trunk road which runs between London and Goodwick (Fishguard), Wales, and officially called The London to Fishguard Trunk Road (A40) in all legal documents and Acts. Much of its length within England has been superseded by motorways, such as the M40, and has lost its trunk road status, though it retains it west of Gloucester, including its length within Wales. It is approximately long. The eastern section from Denham, Buckinghamshire to Wheatley, Oxfordshire is better served by the M40 and its former function of linking London with Cheltenham and Gloucester has been taken by the M4, A419 and A417 via Swindon.

==History==
The A40 1923 route was from the City of London to Fishguard. The road still begins and ends in the same places, but a number of changes have been made to its route.

The first change dates from 1935, between Ross-on-Wye and Abergavenny. The original route of the A40 was via Skenfrith, avoiding Monmouth; this road was renumbered the B4521. The A40 was rerouted via Raglan; between Ross and Raglan it replaced part of the A48, between Raglan and Llanvihangel-nigh-Usk it replaced the B4234, and between Llanvihangel and Abergavenny it replaced part of the A471.

Subsequently, the A40 was rerouted within west London. Western Avenue dates from the 1930s, but was originally opened as the A403. After the Second World War, the A40 was rerouted along part of the A219 (west of Notting Hill) and Western Avenue. The old route (via Acton, Ealing, Southall, Hayes, Hillingdon and Uxbridge) was renumbered the A4020.

Initially, the A40 went through the centre of Oxford, via Headington, Magdalen Bridge, the High Street, Carfax and Botley, and over the Swinford Toll Bridge to Eynsham. It was rerouted in the 1930s to follow the first section of the Oxford Ring Road to the north of the city, and then followed a direct line to bypass Eynsham. The old route became part of the A420 to Botley, and the section between Botley and Eynsham was renumbered the A4141, renumbered again in the 1960s to the B4044.

==Route==
===Central London – Denham===

In central London it is High Holborn and then Oxford Street. At Marble Arch it joins the A5 Edgware Road as far as the Marylebone Flyover to become Westway (classified A40(M) as an elevated motorway) then meets Western Avenue. For the greater part, this section is six lanes, otherwise four lanes. With two exceptions, Western Avenue forms a grade-separated motorway standard dual-carriageway between Paddington and the M40 motorway. The two at-grade intersections are Gypsy Corner and Savoy Circus; both of which are traffic light controlled. At Denham Roundabout, the six lane Western Avenue flows into the M40.

=== Denham – Oxford ===
The A40 branches off the Denham roundabout to run as a dual carriageway. After the junction with the A413, the A40 follows the same route as the M40 as a single carriageway, passing through Beaconsfield and High Wycombe. Beyond Stokenchurch the road is much quieter; when meeting the B4009 and A329 those roads have priority. Approaching Oxford, the A40 becomes a busy dual carriageway, carrying traffic from the M40 to Oxford and beyond. The road forms the northern section of the Oxford Ring Road, crossing the A44 and the A34. In Oxford, it passes the Thornhill Park and Ride, where the OxfordTube, The Airline to Heathrow &amp; Gatwick, &amp; Oxford Park and Ride buses stop.

===Oxford – Cheltenham (M5)===
The A40 passes under the A34, reverting to single carriageway for until the dual carriageway just east of Witney with a grade-separated junction. The dual carriageway finishes at a roundabout. For the rest of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire until Cheltenham, other than for a few short stretches, the road is single carriageway. A height of above sea level is located west of the A429 junction. Before Andoversford the A436 breaks off to the west to try to take traffic away from descending into the centre of Cheltenham itself. The road travels through Cheltenham town centre along at least two parallel routes (neither is part of a one-way system: Sandford Road and Montpellier Terrace make up one part, Thirlestaine Road and Suffolk Road the other). Becoming a dual carriageway, it passes GCHQ in Cheltenham and the three-level stacked roundabout junction with the M5 motorway. In February 2015, the Witney Oxford Transport Group proposed the reopening of Yarnton railway station as an alternative to improvements to the A40 road proposed by Oxfordshire County Council.

===Cheltenham (M5) – Abergavenny===
The A40 is the Gloucester bypass, most of which is dual carriageway. The junction with the A48 to Chepstow is at Highnam. For the remainder of Gloucestershire, and a part of Herefordshire, the road is single carriageway until Ross-on-Wye. There it connects with the M50 motorway, and forms part of the high quality dual carriageway between South Wales and the English Midlands. From Ross-on-Wye to Monmouth the road follows the Wye Valley, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, crossing the Wales–England border a mile east of Monmouth. Just west of Monmouth are twin tunnels; these are the only tunnels on the A40. Near Raglan, the A40 has a grade separated junction with the A449. The A40 continues as a dual carriageway to Abergavenny.

====Abergavenny – M50 junctions====

===Abergavenny – Carmarthen===
At Abergavenny is the A40 junction with the Heads of the Valleys road, (A465) and the A4042. Now the A465 becomes the primary route between the Midlands to the South Wales Valleys and Swansea; there is a dual-carriageway route to Carmarthen via the A465, M4 and A48.

The A40 becomes single carriageway and continues through Abergavenny, following the north side of the Usk valley through the eastern part of the Brecon Beacons National Park until Brecon. At Bwlch between Abergavenny and Brecon, the A40 is above sea level. The A40 is dualled for over as it approaches a junction east of Brecon with the A470 north, which is the main north–south road through mid-Wales. Continuing as a dual carriageway, the A40 and A470 concurrent bypass Brecon to the south, crossing the River Usk here. At the western end of the bypass is a further junction with the A470 south. Beyond this point the A40 continues as a single carriageway, now south of the River Usk, and roughly follows the northern edge of the Brecon Beacons National Park. A height of above sea level is located less than east of Trecastle. In Llandovery the road crosses the Heart of Wales railway and the River Tywi; the road, railway and river then run parallel until Llandeilo, where the National Park ends and the railway turns south. The A40 continues west along the Tywi valley to Carmarthen where as a dual carriageway it forms the eastern bypass, meeting the terminus of the A48 at Pensarn. Here the A40 returns to being a primary route westwards.

===Carmarthen – Fishguard===
At Carmarthen the A40 crosses the River Tywi twice with two 90-degree junctions and continues on of dual carriageway as far as St. Clears, where the dual carriageway ends at the junction with the A477 trunk road. Now the A40 is a mixture of 2 or 3 lane single-carriageway to Haverfordwest and Fishguard. This section of road is controlled by the Welsh Government (formerly &#x27;Welsh Assembly Government&#x27;), which describes it as &quot;one of the lowest standard sections of the Trans European Road Network in the United Kingdom&quot;.

St Clears to Haverfordwest dualling
There were plans in 2002 for a major improvement of the 23-mile stretch between St Clears and Haverfordwest which included upgrading to a dual carriageway; described as an extension of the national motorway network to the West Wales coast by virtue of the route from the M4 motorway being entirely dual carriageway. The £60 million scheme was subject to a European Environmental Assessment. Within a couple of years, the project appeared to be dying a very quiet death, causing local newspapers to report it being an election stunt for the two marginal constituencies that would best benefit from the improvements. The following Welsh elections saw both constituencies change the party of majority. The political party at the centre of the row instead directed the project deferment to damning environmental statements by Friends of the Earth Cymru. The scheme was officially scrapped in 2008 after a Welsh Assembly committee decided to abandon the proposals. Instead, it recommended upgrades to the existing route including bypasses around Robeston Wathen and Llanddewi Velfrey using a three-lane option. This was welcomed by the Friends of the Earth, saying &quot;The dual carriageway on the A40 would increase traffic levels, increase the emission of greenhouse gases, it would be harmful for the environment, it would be hugely expensive. That money would be better spent on improving public transport, on health, on education, there&#x27;s no need for it. We think the assembly committee has come to the right decision&quot;.

Whitland Bypass
The last improvement to the A40 on this section prior to the Welsh Assembly Government having the devolved responsibility for this road was a £8 million bypass around Whitland. Constructed in 1994, the road started east of Black Bridge on the original A40, then running north of the town before to a new roundabout just west of Llain Cottage. The Secretary of State for Wales was asked a written question by Rhodri Morgan about adding a second carriageway to the Whitland bypass scheme, to which John Redwood replied &quot;There are no proposals to add a second carriageway to the Whitland bypass. The design capacity of a single carriageway two-lane highway is more than adequate to cater with the anticipated traffic flows for the foreseeable future.&quot;

Llanddewi Velfrey Bypass
A new bypass has been granted approval by the Welsh Assembly Government at Llanddewi Velfrey in Pembrokeshire. The scheme would improve the A40 between Llanddewi Velfrey and Penblewin, to the west of St Clears and meet the aim of the targeted investment in infrastructure along the east–west road corridor in south Wales. From the east, it is proposed that a roundabout would be created just north of Glenfield Farm, where the straight section from St Clears ends at Bethel Chapel, and then take a new route north-west of the town of Llanddewi Velfrey, south-west over Pentroydin Fawr and Penttroydin Fech farms with cattle underpasses, a new underpass beneath the existing Llanddewi Velfrey to Llanfallteg road, before going over the original A40 at Ffynnon Wood. To the west of Ffynnon Wood, the road would then cross back over the original A40 to the east of Henllan Lodge in a way to maintain the tree lined avenue to Henllan, then run parallel to the A40 on the north side of the existing A40 to a new roundabout at Penblewin and the junction with the A478.

This was originally known as the Blue and Purple routes during the Consultation in 2006 for which 75% preferred the blue route, and only 20% preferred the red route. 54% felt the section from Ffynnon Wood and Penblewin Roundabout needed improvement, with both orange and purple routes preferred by 42% of the respondents. Welsh Water/Dwr Cymru expressed concerns with the red route affecting water mains and sewers, and Henllanfallteg Community Council felt the red route would not improve the quality of life in Llanddewi Velfrey. Pembrokeshire County Council expressed concerns that the route planned was a single carriageway, and that within seven years, a dual carriageway would be required.

Robeston Wathen Bypass
A new bypass has been constructed between Penblewin and Slebech Park making the road straighter and with a &#x27;2+1&#x27; road layout to help improve overtaking opportunities.

Starting to the west of Toch Lane (approx. east of Slebech), the route travels eastwards for , passing south of Robeston Wathen, and ending east of the village, just west of Flimstone Lane.

Construction started on the route in February 2009, with the works completed and the new road opening 1 March 2011. The road was built by Costain. The scheme was nearly £14 million over the initial budget of £27.6 million, eventually costing £41.4 million. The Welsh Assembly Government explains this increase as being the result of inflation and land costs, saying the original budget did not include either, as well as additional statutory procedures, additional works following some design standards, and the increase in VAT.

The Kell
The Kell is located on a section of the A40 that forms a north–south corridor between Fishguard, to the north and Haverfordwest, to the south, close to Treffgarne and Spittal. The improvement saw about of new trunk road commencing at a point on the trunk road approximately 622 metres south of the centreline of the junction of the A40 trunk road with the C3059 road to Spittal and extending in a generally northerly direction to a point approximately 112 metres south of the junction of the trunk road with the C3059 road to Spittal. This resulted in the road being rerouted through pasture to the east of the original road, taking a right hand bend about south of The Old Mill, taking a 5.5% gradient, and rejoining the original road north of The Kell. The original road has subsequently been converted to an access road for The Old Mill, Beavers Lodge and The Kell, accessing the new road at The Old Mill.

Fishguard Bypass
The Fishguard Bypass was planned to provide a more direct route with greater capacity to the Port of Fishguard at Goodwick avoiding the town centre of Fishguard. It was constructed during the late 1990s and opened in 2000. It takes the form of a three-lane carriageway on an approx. 10% gradient around the western edge of Fishguard. It runs from its highest point at Rafael roundabout 1 km south of Fishguard town in a generally northerly direction to its lowest point at Windy Hall roundabout where it rejoins the old A40 route at Gasworks Hill. The bypass is concurrent with a section of the A487 trunk road with the A40 dominant.

<text>Real Valladolid Club de Fútbol, S.A.D., or simply Real Valladolid (), is a Spanish professional football club based in Valladolid, Castile and León that competes in La Liga.

The club colours are violet and white, used on the kit in stripes from its foundation on 20 June 1928. The team plays its home games at the Estadio José Zorrilla, which seats 27,846 spectators. Valladolid&#x27;s honours include a single trophy of great relevance, the defunct Copa de la Liga 1983–84. It has been runner-up in the Copa del Rey on two occasions (1949–50 and 1988–89), and has participated in two editions of the UEFA Cup (1984–85 and 1997–98) and also one edition of the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup (1989–90). The team subsidiary, the Real Valladolid Promesas, currently play in the Segunda Federación.

Since its La Liga debut in the 1948–49 season (in which it became the first club from the region to play in La Liga – five others have since done so), Valladolid is the most successful football club in Castile and León by honours and history, with a total of 47 seasons in the First Division, 36 in the Second and 10 in the Third. Historically, Valladolid is the 13th-best team in Spain by overall league points. Two of its players have won the Pichichi Trophy: Manuel Badenes and Jorge da Silva; and ten were internationals with the Spain national football team. In the 21st century, the club&#x27;s domestic performance follows a yo-yo club pattern, with multiple promotions to (and relegations from) the first division.

On 3 September 2018, it was announced that Brazilian former international footballer Ronaldo Nazario had become the majority shareholder after purchasing a 51% controlling stake in the club. , Ronaldo is owner of 82% of the club shares.

== History ==

=== 20th-century history (1928–2001) ===

Real Valladolid was founded from the merger of Real Unión Deportiva de Valladolid and Club Deportivo Español, the club played its first game on 22 September 1928. It was a 2–1 win over Alavés. Valladolid first reached the top level in the 1947–48 season, as champions of the Segunda División. The club became the first Castile and León club to play in the Spanish top flight. The following year, the team pushed on from this success and reached the finals of the Copa del Rey in Chamartín Stadium against Athletic Bilbao, losing 4–1.

The next ten years were spent in the first division, and relegation was short-lived as Valladolid gained promotion again in 1958–59 with a 5–0 win over Terrassa under manager José Luis Saso, a legendary figure in club history. He had originally been a goalkeeper for the club and went on to perform many roles, including serving as president of the club.

Valladolid swung between the first and second divisions in subsequent years, falling as low as to the third division in 1970–71. Next year the club was promoted to second division and in 1980 promoted to first division, where Valladolid played until 1992 when the club was relegated to the second division again. Promoted in 1992–93, the club was again sent down after the 2003–04 season. In 1984, Valladolid also won the Copa de la Liga (a competition only played in the early 1980s) over Atlético Madrid.
On 14 April 1996, Valladolid played its 1,000th game in La Liga.

The side&#x27;s highest position during this 11-year stint was seventh in 1996–97, being coached in the previous seasons by former Real Madrid Castilla coach Rafael Benítez, as various players from that team would also later appear for Valladolid.

=== Carlos Suárez era (2001–2018) ===

In the 2006–07 season, after signing Basque José Luis Mendilibar as head coach, Valladolid had one of its best years in its history while playing in the second level. The club took the league lead in the 15th matchday and went on to finish with a competition all-time high 88 points, winning the championship by a total margin of eight points, and holding an advantage of 26 points over the non-promotion zone (fourth and below), both being all-time records in the league. Valladolid also achieved the honour of going unbeaten in 29-straight matches, from 10 October 2006 to 6 May 2007, being mathematically promoted after a 2–0 away win against Tenerife on 22 April 2007 (the 34th matchday of the season), the earliest any club has achieved promotion in Spanish history.

Also remarkable was the side&#x27;s role in the season&#x27;s Copa del Rey, reaching the quarter-finals after defeating two top division teams, Gimnàstic de Tarragona (4–1 aggregate) and the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League contender Villarreal (3–1), while playing the entire competition with reserve players.

Two relatively successful seasons in the top division followed, finishing in 15th place while avoiding relegation after a 1–1 draw on the last matchday of both seasons (against Recreativo de Huelva in 2007–08 and Real Betis in the following campaign).

After a slow start to 2009–10 (three wins in the first 20 matches), Mendilibar was sacked on 1 February 2010 following a draw at home against Almería. The week following his sacking, Valladolid dropped into the relegation zone (something that never happened during Mendilibar&#x27;s 138-match stint), with former player Onésimo Sánchez taking charge.

After only one win in 10 matches, Sánchez was fired. Former Spain national team manager Javier Clemente was named Sánchez&#x27;s replacement in a desperate move to avoid relegation with only eight matches remaining. After a brief breather (16th position), Valladolid again returned to the bottom three, then faced a must-win last game at the Camp Nou against a Barcelona squad needing a win to secure the Liga championship. Level in the standings with Racing de Santander, Málaga and Tenerife for the two final safe positions, Valladolid lost 0–4 and consequently was relegated, ending a three-year stay in the top flight.

The 2011–12 season saw Valladolid return to La Liga under the management of Miroslav Đukić, promoted through the play-offs after finishing third in the division.

Valladolid were relegated back to the Segunda División on the last matchday of the 2013–14 season.

In the 2017–18 season, Valladolid was promoted back to first division after four years via play-off defeating Sporting de Gijón and Numancia.

=== Ronaldo Nazario, new owner (2018–present) ===
In the summer of 2018, a series of purchase offers were presented by several foreign entrepreneurs. This process concluded with the acquisition led by the former Brazilian player Ronaldo Nazário, who was officially introduced as the majority shareholder and president of the board of directors on 3 September 2018. The presentation took place in the reception hall of the Valladolid City Hall. It is worth noting that the former president, , continued in the role of CEO until he resigned in August 2019.

When Ronaldo was introduced, the team had already completed the first three rounds of the 2018–19 La Liga season. Despite failing to score any goals, they managed to secure two draws out of three matches, largely due to their strong defensive performance. Their standing improved to 6th place by the 10th round, but a lack of goals combined with a deteriorating defense resulted in a series of unfavorable outcomes. Throughout April, they found themselves periodically in positions that could lead to relegation. However, the team&#x27;s performance notably picked up in the final rounds of the season, ensuring their safety in the league mathematically one match prior to the end of the championship. As part of changes, Calero, who had performed well, was transferred to Espanyol for a fee of 8 million euros plus additional variables.

Sergio González Soriano continued as the coach for the 2019–20 season. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a pause in the season on 13 March when the team was in 15th place, four points above the relegation zone. The league resumed from mid-June to mid-July, with the team securing safety in the second-to-last round and finishing 13th, their best position in 18 seasons. Throughout the season, Valladolid avoided relegation positions, relying on effective but not flashy play. The standout was Salisu, a Ghanaian defender from the youth team, who excelled in defense. He was sold to Southampton FC for 12 million euros in the summer, a record sale for Valladolid. In January, Ronaldo signed high-profile player Ben Arfa, who played sparingly and left at the season&#x27;s end.

On 23 May 2020, a preliminary agreement was announced with the Club Baloncesto Ciudad de Valladolid for collaboration between the two entities. The merger would result in the basketball club becoming a section within Real Valladolid. Among the changes would be alterations to the club&#x27;s colors and the basketball team&#x27;s name. On 10 July 2020, members of Atlético Tordesillas agreed to have the team become a subsidiary of Real Valladolid for one season, extendable over time. Atlético Tordesillas would retain its legal identity and board of directors. The agreement would bring young players from the Valladolid academy, a full coaching staff funded by Valladolid, training for lower division coaches at Tordesillas, supply of sports equipment, and the presence of Valladolid&#x27;s groundkeepers to maintain the Tordesillas team&#x27;s fields.

On 3 August 2020, a 3-year collaboration agreement was signed with Club Baloncesto Ciudad de Valladolid. The basketball team&#x27;s name changed to Real Valladolid Baloncesto, adopting white and purple colors. David Espinar, the basketball team&#x27;s director, joined the board of directors. This partnership aimed to attract resources, strengthen fan connections, and enhance public relations. On 21 August 2020, the agreement with Atlético Tordesillas was confirmed, making it the club&#x27;s second subsidiary team..

The 2020–21 season began in September instead of August due to the COVID-19-induced pause. The RFEF established rules for the 2020–21 league that required teams in La Liga and Segunda División to find alternative stadiums for home matches in case COVID-19 complications prevented matches from being played at their regular venues. The preferred option was the Estadio Nueva Balastera in Palencia, provided it met the minimum requirements set by the LFP. The alternative, however, needed to be located outside the club&#x27;s Autonomous Community. Therefore, stadiums in Madrid were the most likely candidates, and even the possibility of a mutual agreement to share the alternative stadium with another team was considered. Furthermore, during this season, five substitutions in three intervals per match would continue to be allowed. A protocol was designed to address issues like playing surfaces, schedules, first-team player numbers, and what would happen if matches couldn&#x27;t be played or if positive COVID-19 cases were detected among teams, coaches, and players. The protocol also covered the promotion playoffs to La Liga.

On 18 September 2020, alternative venues for home matches were announced. The primary option was either the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu (depending on the progress of ongoing renovations) or the Estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano in Madrid. The secondary choices were the Estadio Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán in Seville and the Estadio de Balaídos in Vigo. Additionally, Valladolid was a highly sought-after host city, being selected as the primary alternative venue by Real Madrid CF and Real Celta de Vigo to play their matches at the Estadio José Zorrilla. Atlético de Madrid, however, opted for another venue. Valladolid was also considered for the list of alternatives, with convenient flight connections in mind, with cities like Valencia and Málaga.

Despite the disappointing results, Real Valladolid had a slim chance of avoiding relegation until the very last matchday. They needed to beat the league champions, Atlético de Madrid, and hope their rivals didn&#x27;t win their matches. Unfortunately, this scenario didn&#x27;t play out, resulting in relegation as the second-to-last team. The club faced criticism from fans for not taking adequate measures to prevent relegation. Despite various challenges including injuries and COVID-19 absences, coach Sergio González Soriano remained in charge throughout the season, ultimately leading the team back to the lower division.

The following season, 2021–22, marked Real Valladolid&#x27;s 36th season in the second tier. The main goal was to rekindle the fans&#x27; enthusiasm after one of the worst seasons in the club&#x27;s history. On 22 June 2021, the subsidiary agreement with Atlético Tordesillas was terminated due to Real Valladolid&#x27;s relegation. Despite this, the collaboration between the two clubs continued. After a somewhat inconsistent start, the team began 2022 with a strong defense, surpassing the team&#x27;s previous unbeaten record. It is important to note that the earlier record was set in La Liga by César Sánchez, who went 555 minutes without conceding a goal. This achievement spanned from the 85th minute (goal by Julen Guerrero) of matchday 33 in the 1997–98 season to the 10th minute (goal by Predrag Mijatović) of matchday 2 in the 1998–99 season. Ultimately, the record was extended to 646 minutes by Jordi Masip between the 29th-minute goal by Borja Bastón on matchday 20 and the 45th-minute goal by Bernardo Espinosa on matchday 27. The team eventually secured direct promotion by defeating S.D. Huesca 3–0 in the final matchday, even though it relied on results from U.D. Almería and S.D. Eibar. These results materialized with Almería drawing at Butarque and Eibar surprisingly losing to A.D. Alcorcón, who had been relegated for several rounds. Despite this, Alcorcón finished as the bottom team in the second division. Valladolid concluded the season as runners-up, being the top goal-scorers with 71 goals, largely thanks to the 20 goals contributed by Israeli player Shon Weissman. Furthermore, they set a record by spending the fewest matchdays in direct promotion positions before securing promotion, achieving this in only 5 matchdays in total.

The 2022–23 season of La Liga began with Pacheta as the coach, following their promotion, and notable signings like the return of academy graduate Sergio Asenjo and Valladolid native Sergio Escudero. The season was marked by inconsistent performance, swinging between periods of positive and negative results, often conceding goals in the closing minutes of matches. The team managed to stay above the relegation zone until the break for the Qatar World Cup.

During the winter transfer window, new players were brought in to elevate the team&#x27;s performance, but injuries hindered the contribution of some players. Paulo Pezzolano replaced Pacheta as the coach after the team conceded six goals in a single match. Despite Pezzolano&#x27;s efforts, the team&#x27;s irregular form persisted. In the final matchday, playing at home against Getafe, Valladolid was relegated, marking their fifth relegation in two decades, making them the most relegated team in the 21st century.

The day after relegation, President Ronaldo confirmed Pezzolano as the coach for the 2023–24 season. Just days before the new season&#x27;s start, Fran Sánchez was dismissed, and Domingo Catoira took over as the sporting director. The fans&#x27; dissatisfaction with these changes, along with concerns about the team&#x27;s direction and squad changes, were evident during the Trofeo Ciudad de Valladolid, with strong protests against the club&#x27;s leadership, including chants calling for Ronaldo&#x27;s departure.

==Stadium==
Real Valladolid play at the 26,421-capacity Estadio Nuevo José Zorrilla, finished in 1982 to replace the previous stadium of the same name which had stood since 1940(increased its capacity from 27,846). Both grounds are named after José Zorrilla y Moral, a 19th-century poet from the city. After opening for the club on 20 February 1982, it hosted the Copa del Rey Final on 13 April of that year, and then three Group D matches at the 1982 FIFA World Cup. The venue is owned by the Ayuntamiento de Valladolid.

In 2010, it was announced that there were plans to expand the stadium to 40,000 spectators. This project was known as Valladolid Arena , but was contingent on Spain winning the right to host the 2018 FIFA World cup.

== Kit ==
Since it was started in 1928, Real Valladolid has always had a home uniform of purple and white stripes. This uniform was picked to make sure it wasn&#x27;t too similar to other early clubs,  and they still use the same basic design with very few changes. Purple and white have become the team&#x27;s colors, and they&#x27;re a big part of the club&#x27;s story.

During the 2012–13 season, Real Valladolid showed their support for Madrid&#x27;s bid to host the 2020 Olympics by wearing a special shirt for their match against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. The shirt featured black and purple stripes with eye-catching orange numbers on the back.

On September 24, 2023, Real Valladolid had to play their match at the Carlos Tartiere Stadium against Real Oviedo wearing a fourth kit. This is because the Technical Committee of Referees (CTA) considered that the three kits of the pucelano team have violet as the predominant color and considered that they are similar to the first kit of the Asturian team, despite having played other seasons with the first kit, replacing the white shorts with violet ones. The Promesas wore their previously mentioned kit without issue during their Segunda Federación match against Real Oviedo Vetusta last week. This kit consisted of a yellow shirt and socks, along with violet shorts carried over from their second kit.

<text>ISAAC (indirection, shift, accumulate, add, and count) is a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator and a stream cipher designed by Robert J. Jenkins Jr. in 1993. The reference implementation source code was dedicated to the public domain.

&quot;I developed (...) tests to break a generator, and I developed the generator to pass the tests. The generator is ISAAC.&quot;

== Operation ==

The ISAAC algorithm has similarities with RC4. It uses an array of 256 four-octet integers as the internal state, writing the results to another 256 four-octet integer array, from which they are read one at a time until empty, at which point they are recomputed. The computation consists of altering &quot;i&quot;-element with (&quot;i&quot;⊕128)-element, two elements of the state array found by indirection, an accumulator, and a counter, for all values of &quot;i&quot; from 0 to 255. Since it only takes about 19 32-bit operations for each 32-bit output word, it is very fast on 32-bit computers.

== Cryptanalysis ==

Cryptanalysis has been undertaken by Marina Pudovkina (2001). Her attack can recover the initial state with a complexity that is approximated to be less than the time needed for searching through the square root of all possible initial states. In practice this means that the attack needs formula_1 instead of formula_2. This result has had no practical impact on the security of ISAAC.

In 2006 Jean-Philippe Aumasson discovered several sets of weak states. The fourth presented (and smallest) set of weak states leads to a highly biased output for the first round of ISAAC and allows the derivation of the internal state, similar to a weakness in RC4. It is not clear if an attacker can tell from just the output whether the generator is in one of these weak states or not. He also shows that a previous attack is flawed, since the Paul-Preneel attack is based on an erroneous algorithm rather than the real ISAAC.
An improved version of ISAAC is proposed, called ISAAC+.

== Usage outside cryptography ==

Many implementations of ISAAC are so fast that they can compete with other high speed PRNGs, even with those designed primarily for speed not for security. Only a few other generators of such high quality and speed exist in usage.
ISAAC is used in the Unix tool shred to securely overwrite data.,

Also, ISAAC algorithm is implemented in Java Apache Commons Math library., and in NetHack for its RNG.

<text>Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (; ; 17 July 1714 – 27 May 1762) was a German philosopher. He was a brother to theologian Siegmund Jakob Baumgarten (1706–1757).

==Biography==
Baumgarten was born in Berlin as the fifth of seven sons of the pietist pastor of the garrison, Jacob Baumgarten, and his wife Rosina Elisabeth. Both his parents died early, and he was taught by Martin Georg Christgau where he learned Hebrew and became interested in Latin poetry.

In 1733, during his formal studies at the University of Halle, he attended lectures on the philosophy of Christian Wolff by at the University of Jena.

==Philosophical work==
While the meanings of words often change as a result of cultural developments, Baumgarten&#x27;s reappraisal of aesthetics is often seen as a key moment in the development of aesthetic philosophy. Previously the word &quot;aesthetics&quot; had merely meant &quot;sensibility&quot; or &quot;responsiveness to stimulation of the senses&quot; in its use by ancient writers. With the development of art as a commercial enterprise linked to the rise of a &quot;nouveau riche&quot; class across Europe, the purchasing of art inevitably led to the question, &quot;what is good art?&quot;. Baumgarten developed aesthetics to mean the study of good and bad &quot;taste&quot;, thus good and bad art, linking good taste with beauty.

By trying to develop an idea of good and bad taste, he also in turn generated philosophical debate around this new meaning of aesthetics. Without it, there would be no basis for aesthetic debate as there would be no objective criterion, basis for comparison, or reason from which one could develop an objective argument.

===Views on aesthetics===

Baumgarten appropriated the word &quot;aesthetics&quot;, which had always meant &quot;sensation&quot;, to mean taste or &quot;sense&quot; of beauty. In so doing, he gave the word a different significance, thereby inventing its modern usage. The word had been used differently since the time of the ancient Greeks to mean the ability to receive stimulation from one or more of the five bodily senses. In his &quot;Metaphysic&quot;, § 607, Baumgarten defined taste, in its wider meaning, as the ability to judge according to the senses, instead of according to the intellect. Such a judgment of taste he saw as based on feelings of pleasure or displeasure. A science of aesthetics would be, for Baumgarten, a deduction of the rules or principles of artistic or natural beauty from individual &quot;taste&quot;. Baumgarten may have been motivated to respond to Pierre Bonhours&#x27; (b.1666) opinion, published in a pamphlet in the late 17th century, that Germans were incapable of appreciating art and beauty.

==Reception==
In 1781, Immanuel Kant declared that Baumgarten&#x27;s aesthetics could never contain objective rules, laws, or principles of natural or artistic beauty.
Nine years later, in his &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot;, Kant conformed to Baumgarten&#x27;s new usage and employed the word &quot;aesthetic&quot; to mean the judgment of taste or the estimation of the beautiful. For Kant, an aesthetic judgment is subjective in that it relates to the internal feeling of pleasure or displeasure and not to any qualities in an external object.

In 1897, Leo Tolstoy, in his &quot;What is Art?&quot;, criticized Baumgarten&#x27;s book on aesthetics. Tolstoy opposed &quot;Baumgarten&#x27;s trinity – Good, Truth and Beauty….&quot; Tolstoy asserted that &quot;these words not only have no definite meaning, but they hinder us from giving any definite meaning to existing art….&quot; Baumgarten, he said, claimed that there are three ways to know perfection: &quot;Beauty is the perfect (the absolute) perceived by the senses. Truth is the perfect perceived by reason. The good is the perfect attained by the moral will.&quot; Tolstoy, however, contradicted Baumgarten&#x27;s theory and claimed that good, truth, and beauty have nothing in common and may even oppose each other. 


Whatever the limitations of Baumgarten&#x27;s theory of aesthetics, Frederick Copleston credits him with playing a formative role in German aesthetics, extending Christian Wolff&#x27;s philosophy to topics that Wolff did not consider, and demonstrating the existence of a legitimate topic for philosophical analysis that could not be reduced to abstract logical analysis.

==Metaphysics==
For many years, Kant used Baumgarten&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysica&quot; as a handbook or manual for his lectures on that topic. Georg Friedrich Meier translated the &quot;Metaphysics&quot; from Latin to German, an endeavour which – according to Meier – Baumgarten himself had planned, but could not find the time to execute.

<text>The Eight Consciousnesses (Skt. &quot;aṣṭa vijñānakāyāḥ&quot;) is a classification developed in the tradition of the Yogācāra school of Mahayana Buddhism. They enumerate the five sense consciousnesses, supplemented by the mental consciousness (&quot;manovijñāna&quot;), the defiled mental consciousness (&quot;kliṣṭamanovijñāna&quot;), and finally the fundamental store-house consciousness (&quot;ālāyavijñāna&quot;), which is the basis of the other seven. This eighth consciousness is said to store the impressions (&quot;vāsanāḥ&quot;) of previous experiences, which form the seeds (&quot;bīja&quot;) of future karma in this life and in the next after rebirth.

==Eightfold network of primary consciousnesses==
All surviving schools of Buddhist thought accept – &quot;in common&quot; – the existence of the first six primary consciousnesses (Sanskrit: &#x27;, ). The internally coherent school associated with Maitreya, Asaṅga, and Vasubandhu, however, uniquely – or &quot;uncommonly&quot; – also posits the existence of two additional primary consciousnesses, &quot;kliṣṭamanovijñāna&quot; and &#x27;, in order to explain the workings of &quot;karma&quot;. The first six of these primary consciousnesses comprise the five sensory faculties together with mental consciousness, which is counted as the sixth. The &quot; kliṣṭamanovijñāna &quot; is described as an afflicted consciousness, which exhibits an ongoing subtle clinging to self that provides the basis for the ego and disturbing emotions. Based on the Kangyur, the Kagyu scholar 3rd Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje additionally points out that it must also have an immediate aspect, with the power to give rise to the six primary consciousnesses.
 According to Gareth Sparham, The &#x27; doctrine arose on the Indian subcontinent about one thousand years before Tsong kha pa. It gained its place in a distinctly system over a period of some three hundred years stretching from 100 to 400 , culminating in the &#x27;, a short text by Asaṅga (circa 350), setting out a systematic presentation of the &#x27; doctrine developed over the previous centuries. It is the doctrine found in this text in particular that Tsong kha pa, in his &quot;Ocean of Eloquence&quot;, treats as having been revealed in toto by the Buddha and transmitted to suffering humanity through the founding saints (Tib. &quot;shing rta srol byed&quot;): Maitreya[-nātha], Asaṅga, and Vasubandhu.While some noteworthy modern scholars of the Gelug tradition (which was founded by Tsongkhapa&#x27;s reforms to Atisha&#x27;s Kadam school) assert that the &#x27; is posited only in the Yogācāra philosophical tenet system, all non-Gelug schools of Tibetan buddhism maintain that the &#x27; is accepted by the various Madhyamaka schools, as well. The eightfold network of primary consciousnesses – &#x27; in Sanskrit (from compounding &#x27;, &quot;eight&quot;, with &#x27;, the plural of &quot;vijñāna&quot; &quot;consciousnesses&quot;), or  –  is roughly sketched out in the following table.

==Origins and development==

===Early Buddhist texts===
The first five sense-consciousnesses along with the sixth consciousness are identified in the Suttapiṭaka, especially in the Sabbasutta, Saṃyuttanikāya 35.23:
The early Buddhist texts speak of anusayā (Sanskrit: anuśayāḥ), the “underlying tendencies” or “latent dispositions” which keep beings caught in the circle of samsara. These potential tendencies are generally seen as unconscious processes which &quot;lie beneath&quot; our everyday consciousness, and according to Waldron &quot;they represent the potential, the tendency, for cognitive and emotional afflictions (Pali: &quot;kilesā&quot;, Sanskrit: &quot;kleśāḥ&quot;) to arise&quot;.

====Sautrāntika and Theravāda theories====
The Sautrāntika school of Buddhism, which relied closely on the sutras, developed a theory of seeds (&quot;bīja&quot;, 種子) in the mindstream (&quot;cittasaṃtāna&quot;, 心相續, lit. &quot;mind-character-continuity&quot;) to explain how karma and the latent dispositions continued throughout life and rebirth. This theory later developed into the alayavijñana view.

The Theravāda theory of the bhavaṅga may also be a forerunner of the ālāyavijñana theory. Vasubandhu cites the bhavaṅgavijñāna of the Sinhalese school (&quot;Tāmraparṇīyanikāya&quot;) as a forerunner of the ālāyavijñāna. The Theravadin theory is also mentioned by Xuánzàng.

===Yogācāra===

The texts of the Yogācāra school gives a detailed explanation of the workings of the mind and the way it constructs the reality we experience. It is &quot;meant to be an explanation of experience, rather than a system of ontology&quot;. The theory of the ālāyavijñana and the other consciousnesses developed out of a need to work out various issues in Buddhist Abhidharma thought. According to Lambert Schmithausen, the first mention of the concept occurs in the Yogācārabhumiśāstra, which posits a basal consciousness that contains seeds for future cognitive processes. It is also described in the Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra and in the Mahāyānasaṃgraha of Asaṅga.

Vasubandhu is considered to be the systematizer of Yogācāra thought. Vasubandhu used the concept of the six consciousnesses, on which he elaborated in the &quot;Triṃśikaikākārikā&quot; (Treatise in Thirty Stanzas).

==Vijñānāni==
According to the traditional interpretation, Vasubandhu states that there are eight consciousnesses (&quot;vijñānāni&quot;, singular: &quot;vijñāna&quot;):
* Five sense-consciousnesses,
* Mind (perception),
* Manas (self-consciousness),
* Storehouse-consciousness.
According to Kalupahana, this classification of eight consciousnesses is based on a misunderstanding of Vasubandhu&#x27;s Triṃśikaikākārikā by later adherents.

===Ālayavijñāna===
The ālayavijñāna (Japanese: 阿頼耶識 arayashiki), or the &quot;All-encompassing foundation consciousness&quot;, forms the &quot;base-consciousness&quot; (&quot;mūlavijñāna&quot;) or &quot;causal consciousness&quot;. According to the traditional interpretation, the other seven consciousnesses are &quot;evolving&quot; or &quot;transforming&quot; consciousnesses originating in this base-consciousness. 
The store-house consciousness accumulates all potential energy as seeds (&quot;bīja&quot;) for the mental (&quot;nāma&quot;) and physical (&quot;rūpa&quot;) manifestation of one&#x27;s existence (nāmarūpa). It is the storehouse-consciousness which induces rebirth, causing the origination of a new existence.

====Role====
The ālayavijñāna is also described in the Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra as the &quot;mind which has all the seeds&quot; (&quot;sarvabījakam cittam&quot;) which enters the womb and develops based on two forms of appropriation or attachment (&quot;upādāna&quot;); to the material sense faculties, and to predispositions (&quot;vāsanāḥ&quot;) towards conceptual proliferations (&quot;prapañca&quot;). The Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra also defines it in varying ways:

&quot;This consciousness is also called the appropriating consciousness (&quot;adana-vijñana&quot;) because the body is grasped and appropriated by it.&quot;

&quot;It is also called the &quot;alaya-vijñana&quot; because it dwells in and attaches to this body in a common destiny (&quot;ekayogakṣema-arthena&quot;).&quot;

&quot;It is also called mind (&quot;citta&quot;) because it is heaped up and accumulated by [the six cognitive objects, i.e.:] visual forms, sounds, smells, flavors, tangibles and dharmas.&quot;

In a seemingly innovative move, the Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra states that the alayavijñana is always active subliminally and occurs simultaneously with, &quot;supported by and depending upon&quot; the six sense consciousnesses.

According to Asanga&#x27;s Mahāyānasaṃgraha, the alayavijñana is taught by other Buddhist schools by different names. He states that the alaya is what the Mahasamghikas call the “root-consciousness” (&quot;mulavijñana&quot;), what the Mahīśāsakas call “the aggregate which lasts as long as samsara” (&quot;asaṃsārikaskandha&quot;) and what the Sthaviras call the bhavaṅga.

====Rebirth and purification====
The store-house consciousness receives impressions from all functions of the other consciousnesses, and retains them as potential energy, &quot;bīja&quot; or &quot;seeds&quot;, for their further manifestations and activities. Since it serves as the container for all experiential impressions it is also called the &quot;seed consciousness&quot; (種子識) or container consciousness.

According to Yogācāra teachings, the seeds stored in the store consciousness of sentient beings are not pure.

The store consciousness, while being originally immaculate in itself, contains a &quot;mysterious mixture of purity and defilement, good and evil&quot;. Because of this mixture the transformation of consciousness from defilement to purity can take place and awakening is possible.

Through the process of purification the dharma practitioner can become an Arhat, when the four defilements of the mental functions of the manas-consciousness are purified. 

====Tathagata-garbha thought====
According to the Laṅkāvatārasūtra and the schools of Chan and Zen Buddhism, the ālāyavijñāna is identical with the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot;, and is fundamentally pure.

The equation of ālāyavijñāna and tathāgatagarbha was contested. It was seen as &quot;something akin to the Hindu notions of &quot;ātman&quot; (permanent, invariant self) and &quot;&quot; (primordial substrative nature from which all mental, emotional and physical things evolve).&quot; According to Lusthaus, the critique led by the end of the eighth century to the rise of the logico-epistemic tradition of Yogācāra and a hybrid school combining &quot;Tathāgatagarbha&quot; thought with basic Yogācāra doctrines:

===Transformations of consciousness===
The traditional interpretation of the eight consciousnesses may be discarded on the ground of a reinterpretation of Vasubandhu&#x27;s works. According to Kalupahana, instead of positing such an consciousnesses, the Triṃśikaikākārikā describes the &quot;transformations&quot; of this consciousness:
These transformations are threefold:
The first transformation results in the &quot;ālāya&quot;:
The ālāyavijñāna therefore is not an eighth consciousness, but the resultant of the transformation of consciousness:
The second transformation is &quot;manana&quot;, self-consciousness or &quot;Self-view, self-confusion, self-esteem and self-love&quot;. According to the Lankavatara and later interpreters it is the seventh consciousness. It is &quot;thinking&quot; about the various perceptions occurring in the stream of consciousness&quot;. The alaya is defiled by this self-interest;
The third transformation is &quot;viṣayavijñapti&quot;, the &quot;&quot;concept&quot; of the object&quot;. In this transformation the &quot;concept&quot; of objects is created. By creating these concepts human beings become &quot;susceptible to grasping after the object&quot;:
A similar perspective is give by Walpola Rahula. According to Walpola Rahula, all the elements of the Yogācāra storehouse-consciousness are already found in the Pāli Canon. He writes that the three layers of the mind (&quot;citta&quot;, &quot;manas&quot;, and &quot;vijñāna&quot;) as presented by Asaṅga are also mentioned in the Pāli Canon:
==Understanding in Buddhism==

===China===
==== Fǎxiàng and Huayan ====
According to Thomas McEvilley, although Vasubandhu had postulated numerous ālāya-vijñāna-s, a separate one for each individual person in the parakalpita, this multiplicity was later eliminated in the Fǎxiàng and Huayan metaphysics. These schools inculcated instead the doctrine of a single universal and eternal ālaya-vijñāna. This exalted enstatement of the ālāyavijñāna is described in the Fǎxiàng as &quot;primordial unity&quot;.

Thomas McEvilley further argues that the presentation of the three natures by Vasubandhu is consistent with the Neo-platonist views of Plotinus and his universal &#x27;One&#x27;, &#x27;Mind&#x27;, and &#x27;Soul&#x27;.

====Chán====
A core teaching of Chan/Zen Buddhism describes the transformation of the Eight Consciousnesses into the Four Wisdoms. In this teaching, Buddhist practice is to turn the light of awareness around, from misconceptions regarding the nature of reality as being external, to kenshō, &quot;directly see one&#x27;s own nature&quot;.. Thus the Eighth Consciousness is transformed into the Great Perfect Mirror Wisdom, the Seventh Consciousness into the Equality (Universal Nature) Wisdom, the Sixth Consciousness into the Profound Observing Wisdom, and First to Fifth Consciousnesses into the All Performing (Perfection of Action) Wisdom.

The Interpenetration (通達) and Essence-Function (體用) of Wonhyo (元曉) is described in the Treatise on Awakening Mahāyāna Faith (大乘起信論, &quot;Mahāyānaśraddhotpādaśāstra,&quot; AMF in the excerpt below):

<doc id="295574" wikidata="Q1028859" url="?curid=295574" title="Judge Dread">
<text>Alexander Minto Hughes (2 May 1945 – 13 March 1998), better known as Judge Dread, was an English reggae and ska musician. He was the first white recording artist to have a reggae hit in Jamaica, and the BBC has banned more of his songs from radio and television than those of any other recording artist, because of his frequent use of sexual innuendo and double entendres. Following his death, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reported, &quot;He sold several million albums throughout his 25-plus year career and was second only to Bob Marley in U.K. reggae sales during the 1970s&quot;.

==Early life==
Hughes was born on 2 May 1945. He was introduced to Jamaican music when he lodged as a teenager in a West Indian household in Brixton, South West London. Hughes, a heavy-set man, met Jamaican artists Derrick Morgan and Prince Buster through his job as a bouncer at London nightclubs such as the Ram Jam in Brixton; and through another job as a bodyguard. After working as a professional wrestler (under the name &quot;The Masked Executioner&quot;) and as a debt collector for Trojan Records, he worked as a DJ on local radio. In the 1960s he was also sometimes employed to provide security to The Rolling Stones.

==Music career==
When Prince Buster had a big underground hit in 1969 with &quot;Big 5&quot;, Hughes capitalized on it with the recording of his own &quot;Big Six&quot;, based on Verne &amp; Son&#x27;s &quot;Little Boy Blue&quot;, which was picked up by Trojan boss Lee Gopthal, and released on Trojan&#x27;s &#x27;Big Shot&#x27; record label under the stage name Judge Dread, the name taken from another of Prince Buster&#x27;s songs. According to UK newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot;, this came about after he played the track to Trojan Records&#x27; production team in 1972: one of the team, Joe Sinclair, later recalled: &quot;When Dread brought in his demo, we didn&#x27;t exactly think it was a national hit but we reckoned we could pick up something around the region of 70,000 sales with the help of a change of title. You see, the Judge called it &#x27;Little Boy Blue&#x27;, whereas I thought &#x27;Big Six&#x27; would create interest by making the association with Prince Buster&#x27;s &#x27;Big Five&#x27; more obvious. It sold 300,000 copies and spent 27 weeks in the British charts. In 1973, it even made No 1 in Africa.&quot; &quot;Big Six&quot; reached No. 11 in the UK Singles Chart in 1972, selling over 300,000 copies and spending six months on the chart, despite getting no radio airplay due to its lyrics. Further hit singles followed with &quot;Big Seven&quot; (co-written by Rupie Edwards) and &quot;Big Eight&quot; – both following the pattern of lewd versions of nursery rhymes over a reggae backing – as well as &quot;Y Viva Suspenders&quot; and &quot;Up with the Cock&quot;.

He was the first white recording artist to have a reggae hit in Jamaica, leading him to travel to Jamaica to perform live, where many were surprised that he was white. Dread had 11 UK chart hits in the 1970s, which was more than any other reggae artist (including Bob Marley). The &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; credited Judge Dread for having the highest number (eleven) of banned songs of all time. Several of his songs mentioned Snodland, the small town in Kent where Judge Dread lived, including &quot;The Belle of Snodland Town&quot;. There is a road in the town of Snodland named after him, Alex Hughes Close.

Judge Dread was also a songwriter, coming to the attention of Elvis Presley, who had planned to record &quot;A Child&#x27;s Prayer&quot; as a Christmas gift to his daughter Lisa Marie in 1977, but died before the scheduled recording date. Dread helped organise a benefit concert featuring The Wailers and Desmond Dekker and released a benefit single titled &quot;Molly&quot;. Despite its lack of innuendo in the lyrics, the track was still banned from radio airplay, and failed to chart. Recordings Dread issued under the pseudonyms JD Alex and Jason Sinclair were banned by the BBC.

==Death==
Judge Dread died from a heart attack as he walked off stage after performing at The Penny Theatre in Canterbury on 13 March 1998. According to &quot;The Times&quot; his last reported words were: &quot;Let&#x27;s hear it for the band!&quot; When he collapsed, the audience at first thought that this was part of the act. An off-duty paramedic in the crowd realised that it was not and attempted resuscitation; shortly afterwards Dread was taken to the Kent and Canterbury Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

==Legacy==
Writing in &quot;The Independent&quot; following Dread&#x27;s death, Pierre Perrone noted: &quot;His stage act, mixing vaudeville, music hall, single entendres, and damn-right cheek was undoubtedly a major influence on Ian Dury (check out &quot;Razzle in My Pocket&quot;, the B side of &quot;Sex and Drugs and Rock and Roll&quot;) and Buster Bloodvessel, who used to end Bad Manners&#x27; shows by baring his huge buttocks; a very Judge Dread move indeed&quot;.

<text>The Taklamakan Desert ( ) is a desert in northwest China&#x27;s Xinjiang region. Located inside the Tarim Basin in Southern Xinjiang, it is bounded by the Kunlun Mountains to the south, the Pamir Mountains to the west, the Tian Shan range to the north, and the Gobi Desert to the east.

==Etymology==

While most researchers agree on being the Persian word for &quot;place&quot;, etymology of &quot;Takla&quot; is less clear. The word may be a Uyghur borrowing of the Persian , &quot;to leave alone/out/behind, relinquish, abandon&quot; + &quot;makan&quot;. Another plausible explanation suggests it is derived from Turki &quot;taqlar makan&quot;, describing &quot;the place of ruins&quot;. Chinese scholars Wang Guowei and Huang Wenbi linked the name to the Tocharians, a historical people of the Tarim Basin, making the meaning of &quot;Taklamakan&quot; similar to &quot;Tocharistan&quot;. According to Uyghur researcher Turdi Mettursun Kara, the name Taklamakan comes from the expression Terk-i Mekan. The name is first mentioned as Terk-i Makan (ترك مكان / trk mkan) in the book called Tevarih-i Muskiyun, which was written in 1867 in the Hotan Prefecture of Xinjiang.

In folk etymology, it is said to mean &quot;Place of No Return&quot; or &quot;get in and you&#x27;ll never get out&quot;.

==Geography==
The Taklamakan Desert has an area of , making it slightly smaller than Germany. The desert is part of the Tarim Basin, which is long and wide. It is crossed at its northern and at its southern edge by two branches of the Silk Road, by which travellers sought to avoid the arid wasteland.
It is the world&#x27;s second-largest shifting sand desert, with about 85% made up of shifting sand dunes, ranking 16th in size in a ranking of the world&#x27;s largest deserts.
Dunes range in height from up to as much as . The few breaks in this sea of sand are small patches of alluvial clay. Generally, the steeper sides of the dunes face away from the prevailing winds.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China has constructed two cross-desert highways. The Tarim Desert Highway links the cities of Hotan (on the southern edge) and Luntai (on the northern edge) and the Bayingol to Ruoqiang road crosses the desert to the east.

As a shifting sand desert, sand dunes constantly shift under the influence of the wind. As a result, moving sands dunes erode grasslands and residential areas.

In 1978, the Chinese government launched the Green Great Wall project, aiming to create a forest chain extending from Xinjiang to Heilongjiang in northern China, to prevent desertification. It is one of the largest afforestation projects in the world. In 2024, the 3,046-kilometer green barrier around the Taklimakan Desert was completed, creating a full encirclement of the desert with vegetation.

The Golmud-Korla Railway crosses the Taklamakan as well.

Named areas in the desert include Ha-la-ma, A-lang-ha and Mai-k&#x27;o-tsa-k&#x27;o. The Mazartag mountains are located in the western part of the desert.

==Climate==

Because it lies in the rain shadow of the Himalayas, Taklamakan has a cold desert climate. Given its relative proximity with the cold to frigid air masses in Siberia, extreme temperatures are recorded in wintertime, sometimes well below , while in summer they can rise up to . During the 2008 Chinese winter storms episode, the Taklamakan was reported to be covered, for the first time in its recorded history, entirely with a thin layer of snow reaching , with a temperature of in some observatories.

Its extreme inland position, virtually in the very heartland of Asia and thousands of kilometres from any open body of water, accounts for the somewhat wide diurnal temperature variation.

==Oasis==

The Taklamakan Desert has very little water making it hazardous to cross. Merchant caravans on the Silk Road would stop for relief at the thriving oasis towns. It was in close proximity to many of the ancient civilizations—to the Northwest is the Amu Darya basin, to the southwest the Afghanistan mountain passes lead to Iran and India, to the east is China, and even to the north ancient towns such as Almaty can be found.

The key oasis towns, watered by rainfall from the mountains, were Kashgar, Miran, Niya, Yarkand, and Khotan (Hetian) to the south, Kuqa and Turpan in the north, and Loulan and Dunhuang in the east. Now, many, such as Miran and Gaochang, are ruined cities in sparsely inhabited areas in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

The archaeological treasures found in its sand-buried ruins point to Tocharian, early Hellenistic, Indian, and Buddhist influences. Its treasures and dangers have been vividly described by Aurel Stein, Sven Hedin, Albert von Le Coq, and Paul Pelliot.
Mummies, some 4000 years old, have been found in the region.

Later, the Taklamakan was inhabited by Turkic peoples. Starting with the Han dynasty, the Chinese sporadically extended their control to the oasis cities of the Taklamakan Desert to control the important silk route trade across Central Asia. Periods of Chinese rule were interspersed with rule by Turkic, Mongol and Tibetan peoples. The present population consists largely of Turkic Uyghur people and ethnic Han people.

==Scientific exploration==
This desert was explored by several scholars, including Xuanzang, a 7th-century Buddhist monk, and, in the 20th century, the archaeologist Aurel Stein.

Atmospheric studies have shown that dust originating from the Taklamakan is blown over the Pacific, where it contributes to cloud formation over the Western United States. Further, the traveling dust redistributes minerals from the Taklamakan to the western U.S. via rainfall. Studies have shown that a specific class of mineral found in the dust, known as K-feldspar, triggers ice formation particularly well. K-feldspar is particularly susceptible to corrosion by acidic atmospheric pollution, such as nitrates and phosphates; exposure to these constituents reduces the ability of the dust to trigger water droplet formation.

In May 2023, China announced that it would drill a hole to around depth to investigate the layers of crust in that area. It will not be as deep as the Kola Superdeep Borehole (.

==Transportation==

The Taklamakan Desert is surrounded by the Taklimakan Desert railway loop. The Southern Xinjiang Railway branches from the Lanxin Railway near Turpan, follows the north side of the basin to Kashgar, and curves southeast to Khotan, while Hotan–Ruoqiang railway loops around the south and west side of the Traim. In total, the Taklimakan Desert railway loop contains four different railway lines, including the sections of the Golmud–Korla railway, Hotan–Ruoqiang railway, Kashgar–Hotan railway, and Southern Xinjiang railway. Roads and highways are also available in the desert. 

==In popular culture==

The desert is the main setting for Chinese film series &quot;Painted Skin&quot; and &quot;Painted Skin: The Resurrection&quot;. The Chinese TV series &quot;Candle in the Tomb&quot; is mostly spent in this desert as they are searching for the ancient city of Jinjue (see Niya (Tarim Basin)).

The issue No. 39 &#x27;Soft Places&#x27; of Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot; takes place in the desert, when Marco Polo gets lost in the desert.

A portion of the Korean quasi-historical TV drama series &quot;Queen Seondeok&quot; takes place in the Taklamakan Desert. Sohwa escapes from Silla with baby Deokman and raises her in the desert. As a teenager, Deokman returns to Silla and uses the knowledge and experience gained from life among international traders in the Taklamakan trading centers to gain the throne of Silla.

The desert is showcased in the Japanese animation &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam 00&quot;, set in the year 2307. On the series, the Taklamakan Desert is the setting of a large-scale military joint operation performed by all the world&#x27;s blocks of power, and interdicted by the paramilitary organization Celestial Being.

<text>European route E40 is the longest European route, more than long, connecting Calais in France via Belgium, Germany, Poland, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan, with Ridder in Kazakhstan near the border with Russia and China.

A different route, connecting Calais and Ridder, is about shorter, mostly using the E30 via Berlin-Moscow-Omsk. The E40 differs from that route in order to provide additional direct east–west access to Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan, with a combined population base approaching 50 million people as of 2021.

Since 2014, parts of the road in eastern Ukraine have been under the control of the separatist Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic and Lugansk People&#x27;s Republic. During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia took direct control of the areas in Donbas.

==History==
Thoughts for creating the E17 started in the 1950s. Building of the motorway began in 1966 at Kortrijk. Belgian minister Omer Vanaudenhove had helped in funding the project by founding an intermunicipal association. The final large tracts of the road were finished in 1973. Until 1985, the road was named the European route E3.

<doc id="295594" wikidata="Q1211977" url="?curid=295594" title="Dinosaurs (TV series)">
<text>Dinosaurs is an American family sitcom television series that aired on ABC from April 26, 1991 to July 20, 1994. The show, about a family of anthropomorphic dinosaurs, was produced by Michael Jacobs Productions and Jim Henson Television in association with Walt Disney Television and distributed by Buena Vista International, Inc. The characters were designed by Henson team member Kirk Thatcher.

==Origins and development==
News stories written at the time of the show&#x27;s premiere highlighted &quot;Dinosaurs&quot;&#x27; connection to Jim Henson, who had died the year before. Henson conceived the show in 1988, according to an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, adding he wanted it to be a sitcom, but about a family of dinosaurs. Until the success of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, according to Alex Rockwell, a vice president of the Henson organization, &quot;people thought it was a crazy idea.&quot;

In the late 1980s, Henson worked with William Stout, a fantasy artist, illustrator and designer, on a feature film starring animatronic dinosaurs with the working title of &quot;The Natural History Project&quot;; a 1993 article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said that Henson continued to work on a dinosaur project (presumably the &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; concept) until the &quot;last months of his life.&quot;

The television division of The Walt Disney Company began working on the series in 1990 for CBS before the series landed on ABC, which Disney eventually acquired.

Rafael Montemayor Aguiton of &quot;Vulture&quot; wrote that upon premiere the show &quot;was a hit&quot;, and Michael Jacobs stated that this was why the network did not interfere much in the production.

Aguiton wrote that ratings suffered from the show being moved to different time slots on the network. The animatronics made the show relatively expensive, with Stuart Pankin recalling that &quot;I heard it was the most expensive half-hour TV show, at least at that point&quot; and that this contributed to the cancellation.

==Plot==
&quot;Dinosaurs&quot; is initially set in 60,000,000 BC in Pangaea. The show centers on the Sinclair family: Earl Sneed Sinclair (father), Fran Sinclair (née Phillips – mother), their three children (son, Robbie; daughter, Charlene; and infant, Baby Sinclair) and Fran&#x27;s mother, Ethyl.

Earl&#x27;s job is to push over trees for the Wesayso Corporation with his friend and coworker Roy Hess, where they work under the supervision of their boss, Bradley P. Richfield.

==Characters==
The focus of the show&#x27;s plot is the Sinclair family: Earl, Fran, Robbie, Charlene, Baby, and Ethyl. The family name is a reference to the Sinclair Oil Corporation, which had prominently featured a dinosaur as its logo and mascot for decades, under the belief that petroleum deposits were formed during the age of the dinosaurs. Other character and family names throughout the series often referred to rival petroleum companies or petroleum products. For example: Phillips, Hess, B.P., Richfield, and Ethyl, among others.

===Unisaurs===
Outside of the recurring characters, there are a group of dinosaur characters called Unisaurs. They are customizable dinosaur characters similar to the Whatnots from &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; and the Anything Muppets from &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Some of the Unisaurs are Full-Bodied while the others are hand-puppets. They come in different types.

The following are the Full-Bodied Unisaurs:

==Episodes==

==Topical issues==
Although Dinosaurs is targeted at a family audience, the show touched upon multiple topical issues, which include environmentalism, endangered species, women&#x27;s rights, sexual harassment, LGBT rights, objectification of women, censorship, civil rights, body image, steroid use, allusions to masturbation (in the form of Robbie doing the solo mating dance), drug abuse, racism (in the form of a dispute between the two-legged dinosaurs and the four-legged dinosaurs), peer pressure, rights of indigenous peoples (in the form of the dinosaurs interacting with cavepeople), corporate crime, government interference in parenting, and pacifism.

In the episode &quot;I Never Ate for My Father,&quot; in lieu of carnivorism, Robbie chooses to eat vegetables, which the show uses as a metaphor for homosexuality, communism, drug abuse and counter culture.

The 2-part episode &quot;Nuts to War&quot; was a satire of American involvement in the Gulf War, with two-legged dinosaurs going to war with four-legged dinosaurs over pistachios instead of oil.

In the final season, &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Sold&quot; (a take-off of &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;) references religion when the Sinclair family becomes eager to learn the meaning of their existence. The Elders dictate a new system of beliefs, and the entire cast (with the exception of Robbie) abandons science to blindly follow the newly popular &quot;Potato-ism&quot;.

Another religious-themed episode was &quot;The Last Temptation of Ethyl&quot;, in which Ethyl willingly allows a televangelist to exploit her near-death experience to extort money from followers. She backs out after having a second such experience, where instead of heaven, she experiences a &quot;place not so nice&quot;: an existence surrounded by nothing but multiple Earl Sneed Sinclairs.

Several jokes in the series were at the expense of television shows in general. Earl often wants to watch TV rather than do something more practical, and several jokes accuse television of &quot;dumbing down&quot; the population and making it lazy.

Captain Action Figure shows up in children&#x27;s programming that Fran mistakes for a commercial. Whenever Captain Action Figure mentions a product, the screen flashes &quot;Tell Mommy I WANT THAT!&quot;. Before the appearance of Georgie, &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; used a puppet reminiscent of Barney the Dinosaur named &quot;Blarney&quot; in two episodes. During his appearances, members of the Sinclair family commented on his annoying characteristics and failure to teach anything to children.

The characters will sometimes break the fourth wall as well, especially Baby. An example of such is seen in the episode &quot;Nature Calls&quot; (Season 3, Episode 1) when Fran and Earl spell out words in front of Baby during an argument, who, after looking at the camera and saying &quot;This could get ugly&quot;, proceeds to spell out &quot;They think I can&#x27;t spell&quot; with his alphabet blocks.

===Series finale===
The final episode of &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; produced and aired on ABC was intended as the series finale and depicts the irresponsible actions of the dinosaurs toward their environment, and the ensuing Ice Age which leads to their demise. 

Stuart Pankin, the voice of Earl, stated that the ending &quot;was a simplistic and heartfelt social comment, yet it was very powerful&quot; with &quot;subtlety&quot; being a defining aspect.

The television series creators decided to make this finale as a way of ending the series as they knew the show could be canceled when they created season 4. Michael Jacobs stated that &quot;We certainly wanted to make the episode to be educational to the audience&quot;, and as people knew dinosaurs were no longer alive, &quot;The show would end by completing the metaphor and showing that extinction.&quot; Ted Harbert, president of ABC, expressed discomfort at the ending in a telephone call, but allowed it to go forward.

Jacobs stated that correspondence from parents revealed that &quot;They understood the creativity in the final episode, and they were sad at the predicament we presented in the story.&quot; Pankin stated that &quot;Everybody was at first shocked, but I think it was more of a reaction to the show ending.&quot; Pankin stated that he did not remember a significant number of audience members being angry about the ending. In 2018, Jacobs stated that the episode would have trended on social media had it been released that year.

Noel Murray of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; stated that the episode &quot;delivered as blunt an environmental message as any major network TV broadcast since &quot;The Lorax&quot;.&quot; Brian Galindo of &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; described it as being shocking for children.

==International screening==
In the United Kingdom, the show was screened on ITV in 1992 and in reruns from 1995 to 2002 on Disney Channel. In Canada, the show started airing reruns in 1992 on The Family Channel and aired them until the late 1990s; the show also aired on CHRO-TV in the early-to-mid 1990s. In Australia, the show started airing on the Seven Network from February 1992 through to 1995. In Ireland, in the mid-1990s, it was shown on a Sunday evening on RTÉ Two (known as network 2 back then). In 1994, it was shown in Italy on Rai 1. The show has also aired on TV3, then moved in 2003 to TV2 in New Zealand, KBC in Kenya and M-Net in South Africa. In Brazil the show started airing on Rede Globo from 1992 to 1999, on SBT from 2003 to 2005, on Band from 2007 to 2011, and on Canal Viva in 2014. In Mexico the show was aired on Canal 5.

==Home media==
The first three volumes were released on VHS on December 6, 1991. On May 2, 2006, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released &quot;Dinosaurs: The Complete First and Second Seasons&quot; as a four-disc DVD box set. The DVD set includes &quot;exclusive bonus features including a never-before-seen look at the making of &quot;Dinosaurs&quot;. The complete third and fourth seasons, also a four-disc DVD set, were released on May 1, 2007, with special features, including the episodes not aired on U.S. television. Both sets are currently available only in Region 1.

On September 29, 2017, Hulu acquired the streaming rights to &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; along with fellow Disney–ABC television properties &quot;Home Improvement&quot; and &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, in addition to fellow TGIF programs &quot;Family Matters&quot;, &quot;Full House&quot;, &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot;, &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; and &quot;Step by Step&quot;.

&quot;Dinosaurs&quot; was made available for streaming on Disney+ on January 29, 2021, for the United States.

==Reception==
As of September 2022, the series as a whole has received an approval rating of 91% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Its first season received an approval rating of 83%, its consensus reads, &quot;Dinosaurs&quot;, marries astonishingly expressive puppetry with genuinely funny satire of social norms, making for a forward-thinking prehistoric sitcom.&quot; While its fourth season received more critical praise, with a 100% approval rating.

<doc id="295597" wikidata="Q315711" url="?curid=295597" title="Stewart Copeland">
<text>Stewart Armstrong Copeland (born July 16, 1952) is an American musician and composer. He is best known for his work as the drummer of the British rock band the Police from 1977 to 1986, and again from 2007 to 2008. Before playing with the Police, he played drums with English rock band Curved Air from 1975 to 1976.

As a composer, Copeland&#x27;s work includes the scores of the films &quot;Wall Street&quot;, &quot;Men at Work&quot;, &quot;Good Burger&quot;, and &quot;We Are Your Friends&quot;; the theme music for television shows &quot;The Equalizer&quot;, &quot;The Amanda Show&quot;, and &quot;Dead Like Me&quot;; and the scores for video games in the &quot;Spyro&quot; series and &quot;Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare&quot;. He has also written pieces for ballet, opera, and orchestra.

According to MusicRadar, Copeland&#x27;s &quot;distinctive drum sound and uniqueness of style has made him one of the most popular drummers to ever get behind a drumset&quot;. He was ranked the 10th best drummer of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2016. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Police in 2003, the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 2005, and the &quot;Classic Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 2013.

==Early life==
Copeland was born in Alexandria, Virginia, on July 16, 1952, the youngest of four children of Scottish archaeologist Lorraine Copeland (née Adie; 1921–2013) and American Miles Copeland Jr. (1916–1991). His mother was born in Edinburgh, while his father was from Alabama. His father was, according to his own 1989 biography and files released by the CIA in 2008, a key intelligence operative in Britain during the Second World War and a founding member of the Central Intelligence Agency. Stewart&#x27;s mother was also an espionage veteran, serving in the British Special Operations Executive.

Miles Copeland was assigned CIA duties in Middle East and the family moved to Cairo a few months after Stewart&#x27;s birth. When Stewart was five years old the family moved to Beirut, where he attended the American Community School. He started taking drumming lessons at age 12 and was playing drums for school dances within a year. He later moved to England, attending the American School in London and Millfield boarding school in Somerset from 1967 to 1969. He went to college in California, enrolling at Alliant International University and the University of California, Berkeley. His eldest brother, Miles Copeland III (born 1944), founded I.R.S. Records and became the Police&#x27;s manager. He has also overseen Copeland&#x27;s interests in other music projects. His other brother, Ian Copeland (1949–2006), was a pioneering booking agent who represented the Police and many others.

==Career==
===Curved Air (1975–1976)===
Returning to England, Copeland worked as road manager for the progressive rock band Curved Air&#x27;s 1974 reunion tour, and then as drummer for the band during 1975 and 1976. The band kicked off with a European tour, which started poorly. Band leader Darryl Way, a notorious perfectionist, grew impatient with the struggling of his bandmates, especially novice drummer Copeland. Then, for reasons no one could pinpoint, the musicians suddenly &quot;clicked&quot; with each other and the band caught fire, quickly becoming a popular and acclaimed live act.

Eventually, Way left the band and after months of gradually losing steam, Curved Air broke up so quietly that, by singer Sonja Kristina&#x27;s recollections, most of the music press wrote off the band&#x27;s absence as a &quot;sabbatical&quot;. Copeland formed the Police and Kristina and Way both pursued solo careers. Kristina and Copeland maintained the close personal relationship they&#x27;d formed while bandmates and were married in 1982.

===The Police (1977–1986)===
In early 1977, Copeland founded the Police with lead singer-bass guitarist Sting and guitarist Henry Padovani (who was soon replaced by Andy Summers), and they became one of the top bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Copeland was the youngest member of the band. The Police&#x27;s early track list (before their album debut) was largely Copeland compositions, including the band&#x27;s first single &quot;Fall Out&quot; (Illegal Records, 1977) and the B-side &quot;Nothing Achieving&quot;. Though Copeland&#x27;s songwriting contribution was reduced to a couple of songs per album as Sting started writing more material, he continued to co-arrange all the Police&#x27;s songs together with his two bandmates. Amongst Copeland&#x27;s most notable songs are &quot;On Any Other Day&quot; (where he also sang lead vocals), &quot;Does Everyone Stare&quot; (later to be used as the title of his documentary on the band &quot;Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out&quot;), &quot;Contact&quot;, &quot;Bombs Away&quot;, &quot;Darkness&quot; and &quot;Miss Gradenko&quot;. Copeland also co-wrote a number of songs with Sting, including &quot;Peanuts&quot;, &quot;Landlord&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Alright for You&quot; and &quot;Re-Humanize Yourself&quot;.

Copeland also recorded under the pseudonym Klark Kent, releasing several UK singles in 1978 with one (&quot;Don&#x27;t Care&quot;) entering the UK Singles Chart that year, along with an eponymous 10-inch album on green vinyl released in 1980. Recording at Nigel Gray&#x27;s Surrey Sound Studios, Copeland played all the instruments and sang the lead vocals himself. Kent&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Care&quot;, which peaked at No. 48 UK in August 1978, actually predates the first chart single by the Police by several months (&quot;Can&#x27;t Stand Losing You&quot;, issued in October 1978) as &quot;Don&#x27;t Care&quot; was released in early June 1978.

In 1982, Copeland was involved in the production of a WOMAD benefit album called &quot;Music and Rhythm&quot;. Copeland&#x27;s score for &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; secured him a Golden Globe nomination in 1983. The film, directed and produced by Francis Ford Coppola from the S. E. Hinton novel, also had a song released to radio on A&amp;M Records &quot;Don&#x27;t Box Me In&quot; (UK Singles Chart n. 91)—a collaboration between Copeland and singer-songwriter Stan Ridgway, leader of the band Wall of Voodoo—that received significant airplay upon release of the film that year.

&quot;The Rhythmatist&quot; record of 1985 was the result of a pilgrimage to Africa and its people, and it features local drums and percussion, with more drums, percussion, other musical instruments and occasional lead vocals added by Copeland. The album was the official soundtrack to the movie of the same name, which was co-written by Stewart. Copeland is seen in the film playing the drums in a cage with lions surrounding him.
The Police attempted a reunion in 1986, but the project fell apart.

===Solo projects and movie soundtracks (1987–1998)===
After the Police disbanded, Copeland established a career composing soundtracks for movies (&quot;Airborne&quot;, &quot;Talk Radio&quot;, &quot;Wall Street&quot;, &quot;Riff Raff&quot;, &quot;Raining Stones&quot;, &quot;Surviving the Game&quot;, &quot;See No Evil, Hear No Evil&quot;, &quot;Highlander II: The Quickening&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s Having a Baby&quot;, &quot;The First Power&quot;, &quot;Fresh&quot;, &quot;Taking Care of Business&quot;, &quot;West Beirut&quot;, &quot;I am David&quot;, &quot;Riding the Bus with My Sister&quot;, &quot;Good Burger&quot;), television (&quot;The Equalizer&quot;, &quot;Dead Like Me&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: Droids&quot;, the pilot for &quot;Babylon 5&quot; (1993), Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;The Amanda Show&quot;, &quot;The Life and Times of Juniper Lee&quot;), operas (&quot;Holy Blood and Crescent Moon&quot;, commissioned by Cleveland Opera) and ballets (&quot;Prey&#x27; Ballet Oklahoma&quot;, &quot;Casque of Amontillado&quot;, &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;/&quot;Solcheeka&quot;, commissioned by the Seattle Symphony Orchestra, &quot;King Lear&quot;, commissioned by the San Francisco Ballet Company, &quot;Emilio&quot;). In 1996, Copeland provided the score for &quot;The Leopard Son&quot;, Discovery Channel&#x27;s first commercially released full-length feature film, made by wildlife filmmaker Hugo van Lawick.

Copeland also occasionally played drums for other artists. Peter Gabriel employed Copeland to perform on his song &quot;Red Rain&quot; from his 1986 album &quot;So&quot; because of his &quot;hi-hat mastery&quot;. He has also performed with Mike Rutherford and Tom Waits. That year he also teamed with Adam Ant to record the title track and video for the Anthony Michael Hall movie &quot;Out of Bounds&quot;. In 1989, Copeland formed Animal Logic with jazz bassist Stanley Clarke and singer-songwriter Deborah Holland. The trio had success with their first album and world tour but the follow-up recording sold poorly, and the band did not continue.

In 1993 he composed the music for Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Horse Opera&quot; and director Bob Baldwin, and in 1999, he provided the voice of an additional American soldier in the animated musical comedy war film &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot; (1999).

===&quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot; soundtracks (1998–2002, 2018)===

He was commissioned by Insomniac Games in 1998 to make the musical score for the hit PlayStation game &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot;. Copeland would play through the levels first to get a feel for each one before composing the soundtrack. He also stayed with the project to create the musical scores for the remaining Insomniac sequels &quot;Spyro 2: Ripto&#x27;s Rage!&quot; and &quot;&quot;. The franchise shifted over to Universal for the fourth title, &quot;&quot;, which would be Copeland&#x27;s last outing with the series. While the soundtracks never saw commercial release, the limited edition of the fourth game came packaged with a bonus CD, containing unused tracks. The soundtracks were very well received, and one track would later appear on the 2007 compilation album &quot;The Stewart Copeland Anthology&quot;. Copeland composed a new title theme for &quot;Spyro Reignited Trilogy&quot;.

This period also saw Copeland compose the soundtrack for &quot;Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare&quot;, his only video game soundtrack outside of the &quot;Spyro&quot; franchise to date. In 2000, he combined with Les Claypool of Primus (with whom he produced a track on the Primus album &quot;Antipop&quot;) and Trey Anastasio of Phish to create the band Oysterhead. That same year, he was approached by director Adam Collis to assemble the score for the film &quot;Sunset Strip&quot;.

===Collaborations (2002–2006)===

In 2002, Copeland was hired by Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger of the Doors to play with them for a new album and tour, but the tour was cut short.

In 2005, Copeland released &quot;Orchestralli&quot;, a live recording of chamber ensemble music which he had composed during a short tour of Italy in 2002. Also in 2005, Copeland started Gizmodrome, a new project with avant-garde guitarist David Fiuczynski, multi-instrumentalist Vittorio Cosma, singer Raiz and bassist Max Gazzè. The band made their U.S debut on September 16, 2006, at the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Drum Festival. In January 2006, Copeland premiered his film about the Police called &quot;Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out&quot; at the Sundance Film Festival. In February and March, he appeared as one of the judges on the BBC television show &quot;Just the Two of Us&quot; (a role he later reprised for a second series in January 2007).

=== The Police reunion (2007–2008) ===
At the 2007 Grammy Awards, Copeland, Andy Summers and Sting performed the song &quot;Roxanne&quot; together again as the Police. This marked the band&#x27;s first public performance since 1986 (they had previously reunited only for an improvised set at Sting&#x27;s wedding party in 1992 and for their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003). One day later, the band announced that in celebration of the Police&#x27;s 30th anniversary, they would be embarking on what turned out to be a one-off reunion tour on May 28, 2007. During the tour, Copeland also released his compilation album &quot;The Stewart Copeland Anthology&quot;, which was composed of his independent work.

In 2007, the French government appointed Copeland (along with Police bandmates Summers and Sting) a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.

The group performed 151 dates across five continents, concluding with a final show in August 2008 at Madison Square Garden, New York.

=== Projects (Since 2008) ===
In 2008, RIM commissioned Copeland to write a &quot;soundtrack&quot; for the BlackBerry Bold smart phone. He created a highly percussive theme of one minute&#x27;s length from which he evolved six ringtones and a softer &#x27;alarm tone&#x27; that are preloaded on the device.

In March 2008, he premiered his orchestral composition &quot;Celeste&quot; at &quot;An Evening with Stewart Copeland&quot;, part of the Savannah Music Festival. The performance featured classical violinist Daniel Hope. His appearance at Savannah included a screening of &quot;Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out&quot; and a question and answer session. Also in 2008, he was commissioned by the Dallas Symphony Orchestra to create a percussion piece involving primarily Indonesian instruments. &quot;Gamelan D&#x27;Drum&quot; was first performed in Dallas on February 5, 2012, and had its European Premiere at the Royal Academy of Music in London in July 2012.

On August 21, 2009, at SummerFest 2009, Copeland unveiled the composition &quot;Retail Therapy&quot;, which was commissioned by the Music Society. He performed three more original works: &quot;Kaya&quot;, &quot;Celeste&quot;, and &quot;Gene Pool&quot;, the last accompanied by San Diego–based percussion ensemble red fish blue fish. He attended a composer&#x27;s roundtable and a question and answer discussion in conjunction with the festival. Copeland wrote the score for a theatrical presentation of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, which premiered on September 17, 2009, at the O2 Arena in London. He provided English-language narration of the production, which is performed in Latin and Aramaic. His memoir &quot;Strange Things Happen: A Life with The Police, Polo, and Pygmies&quot; was released by HarperCollins in September 2009. The book chronicles events in his life from childhood through his work with the Police and to the present. In October 2009, he was a guest on &quot;Private Passions&quot;, the biographical music discussion program on BBC Radio 3.

On May 24, 2011, he started a YouTube channel devoted to his videos and project updates. On this channel, he uploads performances with various musicians, including Primus, Andy Summers, Jeff Lynne, Snoop Dogg, and others in his home studio, which he refers to as the Sacred Grove. On August 24, 2011, he was a featured soloist on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, as part of their second &quot;Drum Solo Week&quot;.

On January 10, 2012, he appeared on an episode of the A&amp;E reality series &quot;Storage Wars&quot; to appraise a drum set for Barry Weiss, buying a Turkish cymbal from the set for $40. In July he reunited with former Animal Logic bandmate Stanley Clarke for a European tour.

In May 2013, he and the Long Beach Opera premiered &quot;The Tale Tell Heart&quot;, an opera based on the short story by Edgar Allan Poe.

On November 26, 2013, he appeared in the first episode of &quot;The Tim Ferriss Experiment&quot;.

In 2017, he formed the supergroup Gizmodrome with Adrian Belew, Vittorio Cosma, and Mark King and released an album of the same name. That album peaked at No. 14 on the UK Independent Albums chart.

Ricky Kej and Copeland previously worked together on a song in 2016. During a pause in concerts and overall activity due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Kej reached out to Copeland. The duo eventually collaborated on a studio album entitled Divine Tides. This album was released in 2021 alongside eight music videos shot in locations ranging from the Himalayas in India, to forests in Spain. In April 2022, the album scored Copeland his sixth Grammy Award, and Ricky Kej his second Grammy Awards, in the category of Best New Age Album.
On September 5, 2021, the opera &quot;Electric Saint&quot; about the life of Nikola Tesla by Copeland with libretto by Jonathan Moore premiered at the National Theater of Weimar.

In 2022, he was appointed a Visiting Scholar at McGill University in the laboratory of Dr. Daniel J. Levitin, during which time they co-wrote the chapter &quot;What Can the Performing Arts Learn
from Empirical Time Research? Timing, Tempo and Rhythm: Evidence from the Laboratory and the Concert Stage&quot; for the Oxford University Press book &quot;Performing Time: Synchrony and Temporal Flow in Music and Dance.&quot;

On February 6, 2023, the album &quot;Divine Tides&quot; brought Copeland his seventh Grammy Award and Ricky Kej his third Grammy Award in the 65th Annual Grammy Awards in the category of Best Immersive Audio Album.

==Personal life==
In 1974, Copeland became romantically involved with Curved Air vocalist Sonja Kristina, and they were married from 1982 to 1991. He adopted her son from a previous relationship, and they had two sons of their own. In 1981, he fathered a son with Marina, the daughter of Irish author Desmond Guinness and Mariga Guinness. He currently lives in Los Angeles with his second wife, with whom he has three children.

Copeland&#x27;s hobbies include rollerskating, cycling along the beach in Santa Monica, filmmaking, and playing polo. He is also active on his YouTube channel, where he uploads videos of himself and other musicians during jam sessions in his studio, the Sacred Grove.

==Drumming style==
Copeland grew up listening to a combination of Lebanese music, rock and roll, jazz, and reggae, but he selected from these styles what he needed rather than imitating them. In the 1980s, when many musicians were looking for bigger sound from bigger drums, he added Octobans. Invented by Tama Drums in 1978, Octobans consisted of eight six-inch drums in the shape of narrow tubes. He used another innovation, a splash cymbal based on a toy that he owned and that he helped Paiste design. He relied heavily on his 13&quot; hi-hats.

Despite being left-handed, Copeland plays a right-handed drum kit, placing the hi-hats on his left and ride cymbal and floor toms on his right. He uses a wide dynamic range and demonstrates a proficiency of jazz-style articulation in his snare drum playing, interspersing strong back-beats with soft rim comping. During his years with the Police, he became known for engaging only the hi-hat with the bass drum to keep the beat.

In an interview with &quot;Far Out&quot;, Copeland cited Mitch Mitchell of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, John Bonham, Buddy Rich, Ringo Starr and Ginger Baker as his all time favorite drummers.

==Equipment==
Copeland&#x27;s equipment includes Tama drums, Paiste cymbals, Remo drum heads, and Vater signature drum sticks.

<text>Samuel Shafiishuna Daniel Nujoma ( ; 12May 19298February 2025) was a Namibian revolutionary, anti-apartheid activist and politician who served three terms as the first president of Namibia, from 1990 to 2005. Nujoma was a founding member and the first president of the South West Africa People&#x27;s Organisation (SWAPO) in 1960. 

Nujoma became involved in anti-colonial politics during the 1950s. In 1959, he co-founded and served as the first president of the Ovamboland People&#x27;s Organization (OPO), a nationalist organization advocating an independent Namibia. In December 1958 he was an organizer of the Old Location resistance and was arrested and deported to Ovamboland. In 1960, he escaped and went into exile in Tanzania where he was welcomed by Julius Nyerere.

Nujoma played an important role as leader of the national liberation movement in campaigning for Namibia&#x27;s political independence from South African rule. The OPO was renamed SWAPO in 1960. Nujoma established the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) in 1962 and launched a guerrilla war against the apartheid government of South Africa in August 1966 at Omugulugwombashe after the United Nations withdrew the mandate for South Africa to govern the territory. Nujoma led SWAPO during the lengthy Namibian War of Independence, which lasted from 1966 to 1989. 

Namibia achieved independence from South Africa in 1990 and held its first democratic elections the same year. SWAPO won a majority and Nujoma was sworn in as the country&#x27;s first president on 21 March 1990. He was re-elected for two more terms in 1994 and 1999. Nujoma retired as SWAPO party president on 30 November 2007.

Nujoma published his autobiography &quot;Where Others Wavered&quot; in 2001. He received multiple honours and awards for his leadership, including the Lenin Peace Prize and the Indira Gandhi Peace Prize. The Parliament of Namibia conferred on him the titles &quot;Founding President of the Republic of Namibia&quot; and &quot;Father of the Namibian Nation&quot;. In 2007, SWAPO named him &quot;Leader of the Namibian Revolution&quot;.

==Early life==
Samuel Shafiishuna Daniel Nujoma was born at Etunda, a village in Ongandjera, near Okahao, Ovamboland, South West Africa, on 12 May 1929. Nujoma was born to Helvi Mpingana Kondombolo (1898–2008) and Daniel Uutoni Nujoma (1893–1968). His mother Helvi was a Uukwambi princess by descent, and this fact would later reinforce Nujoma&#x27;s charismatic influence during his political career. He was the eldest of his parents&#x27; eleven children.

Nujoma spent much of his early childhood looking after his siblings and tending to the family&#x27;s cattle and traditional farming activities. His educational opportunities were limited. He started attending a Finnish missionary school at Okahao when he was ten and completed Standard Six, which was as high as possible for blacks during the time. In 1946, at age 17, he moved to Walvis Bay to live with his aunt, where he began his first employment at a general store for a monthly salary of 10 shillings. He later worked at a whaling station. While there he was exposed to world politics by meeting soldiers from Argentina, Norway, and other parts of Europe who had come during World War II.

In 1949, Nujoma moved to Windhoek, where he started work as a cleaner for South African Railways (SAR) while attending adult night school at St Barnabas Anglican Church School in the Windhoek Old Location, mainly to improve his English. He further studied for his Junior Certificate through correspondence at the Trans‐Africa Correspondence College in South Africa.

==Political career==
During World War I, South Africa had defeated the German colonial forces in South West Africa and established martial law in the colony after making a peace treaty in July 1915. After the war, the League of Nations officially assigned the former German colony to the United Kingdom as a mandate under the administration of South Africa. When the National Party won the 1948 election in South Africa, it passed laws establishing racial segregation known as apartheid. It applied these laws to South West Africa as well, which it governed as the &quot;de facto&quot; fifth province of South Africa.

Nujoma became involved in politics in the early 1950s through trade unions. Nujoma&#x27;s political outlook was shaped by his work experiences, his awareness of the contract labour system, and his increasing knowledge of the independence campaigns across Africa. As a result of this activity, he was dismissed from SAR in 1957. In 1957, a group of Namibians working in Cape Town led by Andimba Toivo ya Toivo formed the Ovamboland People&#x27;s Congress (OPC). OPC was opposed to South African policies in South West Africa including the inhumane contract labour system under which people were forced to work for meager wages. Nujoma had become friends with Toivo and in 1959, he joined with OPC cofounder Jacob Kuhangua to start the Windhoek branch of the organisation, which had by then been renamed the Ovamboland People&#x27;s Organization (OPO). At its first congress, Nujoma was elected president. During the next year, he travelled to Namibia in secret, mobilizing and setting up branch structures of OPO. In September 1959, the South West African National Union (SWANU) was formed as an umbrella body for anti-colonial resistance groups. Nujoma joined its executive committee representing OPO.
After the Old Location Massacre in December 1959, Nujoma was arrested and charged for organizing the resistance and faced threats of deportation to the north of the country. He was released after one week in custody. By the directive of OPO leadership and in collaboration with Chief Hosea Kutako, it was decided that Nujoma join the other Namibians in exile who were lobbying the United Nations on behalf of the anti-colonial cause for Namibia. In 1960, Nujoma petitioned the UN through letters and eventually went into exile in February of that year. He left Namibia on 29 February, crossing into Bechuanaland and from there travelling to Bulawayo in Southern Rhodesia by train. He flew from Bulawayo to Salisbury (now Harare) and on to Ndola in Northern Rhodesia. With the assistance of members of the Northern Rhodesian United National Independence Party (UNIP) he crossed into the Belgian Congo&#x27;s Katanga Province. There Nujoma met Moise Tshombe from the Conakat Party of Congolese. Crossing back over the border to Ndola he boarded a flight to Mbeya. In Mbeya, he was treated for malaria and escaped from the hospital after being threatened with arrest by the colonial authorities. From Mbeya, Nujoma travelled with the assistance of officials of the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) via Njombe, Iringa and Dodoma to Dar-Es-Salaam. With the assistance of Julius Nyerere, then president of TANU, he received a passport. While in Tanganyika, he received permission to address the UN Committee on South West Africa in New York. In April 1960, Nujoma travelled from Tanganyika to Khartoum, Sudan, and from there to Accra, Ghana, where he attended the All-African Peoples&#x27; Conference organized by Kwame Nkrumah against the French atom bomb test in the Sahara Desert. Nujoma met with other African nationalist leaders such as Patrice Lumumba, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Joseph Kasa-Vubu, and Frantz Fanon at the conference. His early encounters with other African nationalist leaders left a lasting impression and informed his Pan-African outlook. Kwame Nkrumah assisted Nujoma to travel to the United States and later to Liberia, where a case on South West Africa was being presented to the International Court of Justice.

After breaking away from SWANU, OPO reconstituted itself as the South West Africa People&#x27;s Organisation (SWAPO) in New York on 19 April 1960, and Nujoma was elected president &quot;in absentia&quot;. He arrived in New York in June 1960 where he petitioned before the Sub-Committee of the United Nations General Assembly Fourth Committee. Nujoma demanded that South West Africa be given its independence by 1963 at the latest. He then returned to Tanganyika in 1961, from where he and a small group of activists developed SWAPO into an international force. He received support from other African nationalists and received strong backing from Julius Nyerere. Nujoma established SWAPO&#x27;s provisional headquarters in Dar es Salaam and arranged scholarships and military training for Namibians who had started to join him there.

In 1962, SWAPO founded its armed wing, the South West African Liberation Army (SWALA), later renamed the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN). Nujoma himself procured the first weapons from Algeria via Egypt, Sudan, Tanzania, and Zambia, from where they were taken to Omugulugwombashe in Ovamboland. On 21 March 1966, in a bid to test South Africa&#x27;s claims at the International Court of Justice at the Hague that Namibians in exile were free to return and its assertion that they were in self-imposed exile, Nujoma, accompanied by Hifikepunye Pohamba, chartered a plane to Windhoek. On arrival at the airport, they were arrested and deported to Zambia the next day. On 26 August 1966, the first armed clash between SWALA and the South African security forces took place when paratroopers and police attacked SWALA combatants who had set up a camp at Omugulugwombashe. The attack marked the beginning of the Namibian War of Independence, which would last more than 25 years. In 1969, Nujoma was re-affirmed as SWAPO President at the Tanga Consultative Conference in Tanzania.

Nujoma continued his diplomatic rounds as SWAPO set up offices across Africa, Europe, and the Americas. He represented SWAPO at the founding of the Non-Aligned Movement on 1 September 1961 in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, as well as at the founding of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on 25 May 1963. In 1965, the OAU recognized SWAPO as the only lawful representative of the Namibian people.

 In 1974, the Portuguese Empire collapsed and Namibia&#x27;s border with Angola became much more susceptible to guerrilla infiltration. Nujoma recognized that this paved the way for major changes in the way the war was being fought and over the next two years SWAPO&#x27;s military campaign shifted its base from Zambia to Angola. The opening of the border enabled thousands of SWAPO supporters to stream out of Namibia to join the movement in exile. Nujoma&#x27;s son Utoni Nujoma and his two brothers were among those who arrived in Angola. At the 1977 World Conference Against Apartheid in Lisbon, Nujoma underlined the necessity to destroy the colonial system and institutions of the apartheid regime in Namibia to build those that would serve the interest of people irrespective of race, religion, or . He also warned of the danger of the installation of neocolonialist marionettes who would superficially change the visible colonial regime while the position of the majority of people would stay the same. Nujoma led the SWAPO negotiations team between the Western Contact Group (WCG), which consisted of West Germany, Britain, France, the US and Canada, and South Africa on the one hand, and the Frontline States and Nigeria on the other, about proposals that would eventually become United Nations Security Council Resolution 435, passed in September 1978. While the agreement on Resolution 435, which embodied the plan for free and fair elections in Namibia, was undoubtedly a diplomatic coup, its implementation became bogged down for another ten years. South African delaying tactics and the decision by U.S. President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s administration to link a Cuban withdrawal from Angola to Namibian independence frustrated hopes of an immediate settlement. On 19 March 1989, the signing of the cease-fire agreement with South Africa took place, which resulted in the implementation of Security Council Resolution 435.

After 29 years in exile, Nujoma returned to Namibia in September 1989 to lead SWAPO to victory in the UN-supervised elections that paved the way for independence. Nujoma returned a day before the UN deadline for the Namibia people to register to vote for an election that would draft a constitution when it received its independence from South Africa. The Constituent Assembly, elected in November 1989, chose him as Namibia&#x27;s first president. Nujoma was sworn in on 21 March 1990, in the presence of Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, Secretary-General of the UN, Frederik de Klerk, president of South Africa, and Nelson Mandela, just released from prison.

==President of SWAPO==
In 1959, Nujoma co-founded the Ovamboland People&#x27;s Organization (OPO) and became its first president. The next year in 1960 he became the first president of the South West Africa People&#x27;s Organisation (SWAPO). At the time South Africa administered the land under a policy of apartheid, in which the best resources were reserved for those classified white, while other Namibians were treated as inferior. After years of asking the United Nations to ensure the occupying power in South Africa released control of South West Africa, he authorized armed resistance in 1966. This began the Namibian War of Independence, which lasted 24 years. During the struggle, Nujoma took the combat name &quot;Shafiishuna&quot;, meaning &quot;lightning&quot;, as the name was in his family on his father&#x27;s side. During the liberation struggle, Nujoma was also the commander-in-chief of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) and the chairman of the Swapo Military Council, which was the biggest decision-making body of PLAN.

Nujoma&#x27;s role in PLAN has been questioned following allegations of torture and imprisonment of fighters in the Lubango dungeons in Angola. About 1,000 SWAPO members were incarcerated for over nine years in these prisons. Details of what occurred were published in a left-wing journal, &quot;Searchlight South Africa&quot;, with an interview with two of those who had been kept in pits in poor conditions. It was alleged that Namibian churches participated in a cover-up of the events by the current Namibian government.

After serving 47 years as leader of SWAPO, he was succeeded by Hifikepunye Pohamba in 2007. There was speculation that he would be re-elected as SWAPO leader in 2007 and that he was planning to run for president again in 2009. In early October 2007, however, Nujoma said that he had no intention of seeking re-election as SWAPO President and would stand aside in favour of Pohamba. Pohamba was accordingly elected unopposed as SWAPO president on 29 November 2007 at a party congress. Nujoma said that he was &quot;passing the torch and mantle of leadership to comrade Pohamba&quot;. The congress also decided to give Nujoma the title of &quot;Leader of the Namibian Revolution&quot;, in addition to his existing title, &quot;Founding Father of the Namibian Nation&quot;. Choosing to leave active politics, Nujoma was not re-elected to the SWAPO Central Committee nor the Politburo, but the congress permitted him to attend meetings of the Central Committee and Politburo &quot;at his discretion&quot;. The possibility of his receiving the title of National Chairman of SWAPO was also left open.

==President of Namibia==
As head of SWAPO, Nujoma was unanimously declared president upon the victory of SWAPO in a United Nations-supervised election in 1989 and was sworn in by UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar on 21 March 1990.

At independence, Namibia was gravely divided as a result of a century of colonialism, dispossession, and racial discrimination, compounded by armed struggle and propaganda. For instance, SWAPO had been so demonized by the colonial media and by official pronouncements that most white people, as well as many members of other groups, regarded the movement with the deepest fear, loathing and suspicion. One of Nujoma&#x27;s earliest achievements was to proclaim the policy of &quot;national reconciliation&quot;, which aimed to improve and harmonise relations amongst Namibia&#x27;s various racial and ethnic groups. Under his presidency, Namibia made steady if unspectacular economic progress, maintained a democratic system with respect for human rights (in the exception of LGBT rights), observed the rule of law, and worked steadily to eradicate the heritage of apartheid in the interests of developing a non-racial society.

In 1992, Norway decided to stop drought relief to Namibia in response to the purchase of an expensive new presidential jet and two new VIP helicopters. The planes were bought a few weeks after Nujoma had appealed to the international community for drought aid.

In 1990, Nujoma initiated a plan for land reform, in which land would be redistributed from whites to blacks. Some 12% of the total commercial farmland in the country was taken away from white farmers and given to black citizens by 2007. However, according to a 1998 statement made by the Cabinet of Namibia &quot;the agricultural base is too weak to offer a sustainable basis for prosperity&quot; and 38% of Namibia&#x27;s rural population continues to live beneath the poverty line as of 2010.
Nujoma was re-elected as president of Namibia in the December 1994 election with 76.3% of the vote. The constitution of Namibia was changed to allow Nujoma to run for a third five-year term in 1999; this was justified because he had not been directly elected for his first term, and the change applied only to Nujoma. He won the 1999 election with 76.8% of the vote. The constitution did not allow Nujoma to run in November 2004 for a fourth term, and there was not much enthusiasm even within SWAPO to change it again. Hifikepunye Pohamba, described as Nujoma&#x27;s &quot;hand-picked successor&quot;, was elected as the candidate for the presidential election during the SWAPO congress held on 30 May 2004, defeating two other candidates, Nahas Angula and Hidipo Hamutenya. The latter had been dismissed from his post of foreign affairs minister by Nujoma barely two days before the congress. Pohamba was elected with a large majority in the November 2004 election and was sworn in as the second president of Namibia on 21 March 2005.
In 1998, Nujoma came to the defence of the Democratic Republic of Congo President Laurent Kabila when his rule came under threat from rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda during the Second Congo War. Namibia became involved in the war on behalf of its commitment to the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Namibian, Angolan and Zimbabwean troops helped Kabila fend off the attacks – a move that Nujoma saw as defending the DRC&#x27;s sovereignty against outside interference. Nujoma also allowed the Angolan military to use Namibian territory to launch attacks on UNITA during the Angolan Civil War, which resulted in UNITA launching cross-border attacks that resulted in civilian deaths. He also oversaw the suppression of the Caprivi conflict in August 1999, during which a state of emergency was declared.
Nujoma was the international patron and a strong supporter of the Cheetah Conservation Fund, based in Namibia. He was also a supporter of women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s rights, having called for fathers to pay for the maintenance of children born out of wedlock. He also opposed the practice of expelling widows from the family home following the deaths of their husbands.

In 2000, alongside President of Finland Tarja Halonen, he co-chaired the United Nations&#x27; Millennium Summit that led to the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

In 2001, Nujoma announced purges against gays and lesbians in Namibia, saying &quot;the police must arrest, imprison and deport homosexuals and lesbians found in Namibia&quot;. He also described homosexuality as a &quot;foreign and corrupt ideology&quot;. 

While attending a United Nations conference in Geneva in 2000, Nujoma called AIDS a man-made biological weapon. At one point during his presidency, he banned foreign television programmes from being broadcast in Namibia, accusing them of corrupting the country&#x27;s youth. In 2001, he banned government agencies from purchasing &quot;The Namibian&quot; newspaper and placing advertisements in it, accusing the paper of having an &quot;anti-government stance&quot;.

Nujoma played a crucial role in addressing the country’s HIV/AIDS crisis, despite negative homophobic and stigmatizing comments, by advocating for awareness and policy development. He publicly recognized the epidemic as a major health challenge. Under his leadership, Namibia introduced its first National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS, which outlined prevention, treatment, and care initiatives. His administration collaborated with global organizations such as WHO and UNAIDS to secure funding and expand support for HIV programs and also promoted the gradual expansion of antiretroviral therapy to improve treatment access. 

==Post-presidency==

Despite stepping down from a formal role, Nujoma remained active in the political sphere and regularly campaigned for SWAPO at various rallies and functions across the country. In 2009, Nujoma earned a master&#x27;s degree in geology from the University of Namibia.

The director of the National Society for Human Rights (NSHR) in Namibia claimed in 2007 that Nujoma had connections to the CIA. The organization asked the International Criminal Court to investigate Nujoma and what they say is his role in disappearances during the independence struggle and his presidency. To date, these claims have not been substantiated.

Despite his commitment and actions during his presidency to foster racial reconciliation and harmony between Namibia&#x27;s various ethnic groups, Nujoma made controversial and violent remarks after his presidency. In June 2009, he called on the SWAPO party youth to take up arms and, as he put it, &quot;drive the colonists out of the country&quot;. In 2009, he attacked the German-speaking Evangelical Lutheran Church in Namibia (DELK), accusing it of having &quot;collaborated with the enemy before independence and possibly still being an enemy&quot;. He also said: &quot;We tolerate them. But if they don&#x27;t behave, we will attack them. And when they call their white friends from Germany, we will shoot them in the head&quot;. In September 2009, during a speech in northern Namibia defending Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe, Nujoma repeatedly verbally attacked Americans, Britons, and Germans and urged his supporters: &quot;As soon as you see an Englishman, hit him with a hammer in the head&quot;. He further added, as he had done previously in June 2009: &quot;...that Germans who are unwilling to cooperate should be shot in the head&quot;.

After leaving the presidency, Nujoma resided in his private farm near Otavi and at a SWAPO-owned property outside Windhoek. He was granted an official residence by the government in 2015.

==Personal life==
Nujoma married Kovambo Theopoldine Katjimune on 6 May 1956. The couple had three sons and one daughter: Utoni Daniel (born 1952), John Ndeshipanda (1955–1993), Sakaria &quot;Zacky&quot; Nujoma (born 1957), and Nelago Nujoma (born 1959), who died at 18 months while Nujoma was in exile. Two decades elapsed before his wife joined him abroad. Nujoma&#x27;s first-born son, Utoni, is a high-ranking politician and member of SWAPO who has served in both the Cabinet and the National Assembly. His youngest son, Sakaria, was named in association with the Panama Papers in 2016. The ‘Panama Papers’ revealed details about the Mafia’s business connection between Vito Palazzolo and the youngest son of President Nujoma.

Nujoma&#x27;s father, Daniel Uutoni Nujoma, whose sole &quot;crime&quot; was being Nujoma&#x27;s father, was arrested at Okahao and sent to Pretoria prison in 1966. There he developed tuberculosis from which he died in 1968. Nujoma&#x27;s mother, Kuku Helvi Mpingana Kondombolo, died in November 2008; she was reportedly more than 100 years old.

Nujoma&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Where Others Wavered&quot;, was published in 2001.

==Illness, death and funeral==
Nujoma made his last public appearance at the funeral of president Hage Geingob in February 2024. In July 2024, Nujoma was hospitalized in Windhoek after feeling ill. He had been hospitalised the previous month due to an illness and had to miss a public engagement. 

On 8 February 2025, Nujoma died at a hospital in Windhoek, where he had been confined for the previous three weeks due to an illness. He was 95. The Namibian government announced a period of national mourning over his death beginning on 9 February and ordered Nujoma&#x27;s remains to be transported to the Omusati, Oshana, Erongo, Kavango East, Zambezi, Otjozondjupa, Khomas and ǁKaras Regions. A memorial service was held at Independence Stadium on 28 February 2025, which was followed by Nujoma&#x27;s burial on 1 March 2025 at Heroes&#x27; Acre.

The African National Congress in South Africa set its party flags at half-mast in mourning for Nujoma, while Cuba declared three days of national mourning for him.

==Legacy==
An act of parliament of December 2005 conferred the title &quot;Founding Father of the Namibian Nation&quot; on former president Nujoma. His portrait has appeared on some of the country&#x27;s banknotes since 2012.

Described as both &quot;charismatic&quot; and &quot;fiery&quot;, Nujoma was a revered figure in Namibia for leading the country towards independence and steering it on a path towards to democracy and stability. In a press release issued after his death, the National Assembly said that his contributions to the nation&#x27;s legislative processes were foundational in creating a constitutional democracy based on freedom, unity and prosperity.

&quot;The Namibian&quot; – a publication that at times had a strained relationship with Nujoma – described him as &quot;the last of his generation of African liberation struggle leaders&quot;, placing him alongside such figures as Nelson Mandela, Samora Machel, Agostinho Neto, Robert Mugabe, Kenneth Kaunda, Julius Nyerere, Hastings Banda and Seretse Khama.

Another article in the same paper listed &quot;Ten reasons to be thankful to Sam Nujoma&quot;, including his tireless campaigning for independence from 1960 on; the pragmatic approach he adopted in government, which enabled the country to avoid &quot;ideological cul-de-sacs&quot;; his &quot;One Namibia, One Nation&quot; approach that rejected tribalism; his decision to step down as president after three terms; his hands-off approach to his succession within SWAPO; his rejection of luxurious living; and his willingness to get his hands dirty in manual labour and never seeing himself as above his comrades.

<text>Dynamic positioning (DP) is a computer-controlled system to automatically maintain a vessel&#x27;s position and heading by using its own propellers and thrusters. Position reference sensors, combined with wind sensors, motion sensors and gyrocompasses, provide information to the computer pertaining to the vessel&#x27;s position and the magnitude and direction of environmental forces affecting its position. Examples of vessel types that employ DP include ships and semi-submersible mobile offshore drilling units (MODU), oceanographic research vessels, cable layer ships and cruise ships.

The computer program contains a mathematical model of the vessel that includes information pertaining to the wind and current drag of the vessel and the location of the thrusters. This knowledge, combined with the sensor information, allows the computer to calculate the required steering angle and thruster output for each thruster. This allows operations at sea where mooring or anchoring is not feasible due to deep water, congestion on the sea bottom (pipelines, templates) or other problems.

Dynamic positioning may either be absolute in that the position is locked to a fixed point over the bottom, or relative to a moving object like another ship or an underwater vehicle. One may also position the ship at a favorable angle towards wind, waves and current, called weathervaning.

Dynamic positioning is used by much of the offshore oil industry, for example in the North Sea, Persian Gulf, Gulf of Mexico, West Africa, and off the coast of Brazil. There are currently more than 1800 DP ships.

==History==
Dynamic positioning began in the 1960s for offshore drilling. With drilling moving into ever deeper waters, Jack-up barges could not be used any more, and anchoring in deep water was not economical.

As part of Project Mohole, in 1961 the drillship &quot;Cuss 1&quot; was fitted with four steerable propellers. The Mohole project was attempting to drill to the Moho, which required a solution for deep water drilling. It was possible to keep the ship in position above a well off La Jolla, California, at a depth of 948 meters.

After this, off the coast of Guadalupe, Mexico, five holes were drilled, the deepest at 183 m (601 ft) below the sea floor in 3,500 m (11,700 ft) of water, while maintaining a position within a radius of 180 meters. The ship&#x27;s position was determined by radar ranging to buoys and sonar ranging from subsea beacons.

Whereas the &quot;Cuss 1&quot; was kept in position manually, later in the same year Shell launched the drilling ship &quot;Eureka&quot; that had an analogue control system interfaced with a taut wire, making it the first true DP ship.

While the first DP ships had analogue controllers and lacked redundancy, since then vast improvements have been made. Besides that, DP nowadays is not only used in the oil industry, but also on various other types of ships. In addition, DP is not limited to maintaining a fixed position any more. One of the possibilities is sailing an exact track, useful for cablelay, pipelay, survey and other tasks.

==Comparison between position-keeping options==
Other methods of position-keeping are the use of an anchor spread and the use of a jack-up barge. All have their own advantages and disadvantages.
Although all methods have their own advantages, dynamic positioning has made many operations possible that were not feasible before.

The costs are falling due to newer and cheaper technologies, and the advantages are becoming more compelling as offshore work enters ever deeper water and the environment (coral) is given more respect. With container operations, crowded ports can be made more efficient by quicker and more accurate berthing techniques. Cruise ship operations benefit from faster berthing and non-anchored &quot;moorings&quot; off beaches or inaccessible ports.

==Applications==

Important applications include:
*Servicing aids to navigation (ATON)
*Cable-laying
*Crane vessels
*Cruise ships
*Deep sea mining
*Diving support vessels
*Dredging
*Drillships
*Floating production storage and offloading units (FPSOs)
*Flotels
*Landing platform docks
*Maritime research
*Mine sweepers
*Pipe-laying ship
*Platform supply vessels
*Rock dumping
*Sea Launch
*Sea-based X-band radar
*Shuttle tankers
*Survey ships

== Scope ==
A ship can be considered to have six degrees of freedom in its motion, i.e., it can translate and rotate on three perpendicular axes.

Three of these involve translation:
*surge (longitudinal axis, forward/astern)
*sway (lateral axis, starboard/port)
*heave (vertical axis, up/down)

and the other three rotation:
*roll (rotation about longitudinal axis)
*pitch (rotation about lateral axis)
*yaw (rotation about vertical axis)

Dynamic positioning is concerned primarily with control of the ship in the horizontal plane, i.e. the translation along the two horizontal axes (surge and sway) and rotation on the vertical axis (yaw).

== Requirements ==
A ship that is to be used for DP requires:
*to maintain position and heading, first of all the position and heading need to be known.
*a control computer to calculate the required control actions to maintain position and correct for position errors.
*thrust elements to apply forces to the ship as demanded by the control system.

For most applications, the position reference systems and thrust elements must be carefully considered when designing a DP ship. In particular, for good control of position in adverse weather, the thrust capability of the ship in three axes must be adequate.

Maintaining a fixed position is particularly difficult in polar conditions because ice forces can change rapidly. Ship-borne ice detection and mitigation is not sufficiently developed to predict these forces, but may be preferable to sensors placed by helicopter.

==Positioning systems==
There are several means to determine a ship&#x27;s position at sea. Most traditional methods used for ships navigation are not accurate enough for some modern requirements. For that reason, several positioning systems have been developed during the past decades. Producers of DP systems are: Marine Technologies LLC, Kongsberg Maritime, Navis Engineering Oy, GE, SIREHNA, Wärtsilä (ex L-3), MT-div. Chouest, Rolls-Royce plc, Praxis Automation Technology, Brunvoll AS. The term digital anchor has been used to describe such dynamic positioning systems.
. The applications and availability depends on the type of work and water depth. The most common position reference systems (PRS) and position measuring systems (PME) are:
*DGPS, Differential GPS. The position obtained by GPS is not accurate enough for use by DP. The position is improved by use of a fixed ground-based reference station (differential station) that compares the GPS position to the known position of the station. The correction is sent to the DGPS receiver by long wave radio frequency. For use in DP an even higher accuracy and reliability is needed. Companies such as Veripos, Fugro or C-Nav supply differential signals via satellite, enabling the combination of several differential stations. The advantage of DGPS is that it is almost always available. Disadvantages include degradation of the signal by ionospheric or atmospheric disturbances, blockage of satellites by cranes or structures and deterioration of the signal at high altitudes. There are also systems installed on vessels that use various Augmentation systems, as well as combining GPS position with GLONASS.
*Acoustics. This system consists of one or more transponders placed on the seabed and a transducer placed in the ship&#x27;s hull. The transducer sends an acoustic signal (by means of piezoelectric elements) to the transponder, which is triggered to reply. As the velocity of sound through water is known (preferably a soundprofile is taken regularly), the distance is known. Because there are many elements on the transducer, the direction of the signal from the transponder can be determined. Now the position of the ship relative to the transponder can be calculated. Disadvantages are the vulnerability to noise by thrusters or other acoustic systems. The use is limited in shallow waters because of ray bending that occurs when sound travels through water horizontally. Three types of HPR systems are commonly used:
**Ultra- or super- short base line, USBL or SSBL. This works as described above. Because the angle to the transponder is measured, a correction needs to be made for the ship&#x27;s roll and pitch. These are determined by Motion Reference Units. Because of the nature of angle measurement, the accuracy deteriorates with increasing water depth.
**Long base line, LBL. This consists of an array of at least three transponders. The initial position of the transponders is determined by USBL and/ or by measuring the baselines between the transponders. Once that is done, only the ranges to the transponders need to be measured to determine a relative position. The position should theoretically be located at the intersection of imaginary spheres, one around each transponder, with a radius equal to the time between transmission and reception multiplied by the speed of sound through water. Because angle measurement is not necessary, the accuracy in large water depths is better than USBL.
**Short baseline, SBL. This works with an array of transducers in the ship&#x27;s hull. These determine their position to a transponder, so a solution is found in the same way as with LBL. As the array is located on the ship, it needs to be corrected for roll and pitch.
*Riser Angle Monitoring. On drillships, riser angle monitoring can be fed into the DP system. It may be an electrical inclinometer or based on USBL, where a riser angle monitoring transponder is fitted to the riser and a remote inclinometer unit is installed on the Blow Out Preventer (BOP) and interrogated through the ship&#x27;s HPR.
*Light taut wire, LTW or LWTW. The oldest position reference system used for DP is still very accurate in relatively shallow water. A clumpweight is lowered to the seabed. By measuring the amount of wire paid out and the angle of the wire by a gimbal head, the relative position can be calculated. Care should be taken not to let the wire angle become too large to avoid dragging. For deeper water the system is less favourable, as current will curve the wire. There are however systems that counteract this with a gimbal head on the clumpweight. Horizontal LTW&#x27;s are also used when operating close to a structure. Objects falling on the wire are a risk here.
*Fanbeam and CyScan. These are laser based position reference systems. They are very straightforward system, as only a prism cluster or tape target needs to be installed on a nearby structure or ship. Risks are the system locking on other reflecting objects and blocking of the signal. However, the Cyscan Absolute Signature which was released in 2017 was launched to address this issue. It is able to engage in an active lock with the Absolute Signature prism which reduces the chance of a wrong target being tracked. Range depends on the weather, but is typically more than 500 meters. New advancement from Guidance Marine led to the development of the SceneScan sensor which is a target-less laser PRS leveraging on the SLAM algorithm.
*Artemis. A radar-based system. A unit is placed on a fixed station (FPSO) and the unit on board the mobile station locks on to it to report the range and bearing. The operationalrange is in excess of 4 kilometers. Advantage is the reliable, all-weather performance. Disadvantage is that the unit is rather heavy and costly. Current version is the Artemis Mk6.
*DARPS, Differential, Absolute and Relative Positioning System. Commonly used on shuttle tankers while loading from a FPSO. Both will have a GPS receiver. As the errors are the same for the both of them, the signal does not need to be corrected. The position from the FPSO is transmitted to the shuttle tanker, so a range and bearing can be calculated and fed into the DP system.
*RADius and RadaScan. These are radar based systems; while the RADius has no moving parts, the RadaScan has a rotating antenna under the dome. Guidance Marine has improved the miniRadaScan with the RadaScan View which has an added advantage of radar back-scatter. This enhanced the DPO&#x27;s situational awareness. These systems usually have responders which are active targets that send the signal back to the sensor to report the range and bearing. The range is typically up to 600 meters.
*Inertial navigation is used in combination with any of the above reference systems, but typically with gnss (Global Navigation Satellite System) and Hydroacoustics (USBL, LBL, or SBL).

===Heading systems===
*Gyrocompasses are normally used to determine heading.

More advanced methods are:
*Ring-Laser gyroscopes
*Fibre optic gyroscopes
*Seapath, a combination of GPS and inertial sensors.

===Other sensors===
Besides position and heading, other variables are fed into the DP system through sensors:
*Motion reference units, vertical reference units or vertical reference sensors, VRUs or MRUs or VRSs, determine the ship&#x27;s roll, pitch and heave.
*Wind sensors are fed into the DP system feedforward, so the system can anticipate wind gusts before the ship is blown off position.
*Draught sensors, since a change of draught influences the effect of wind and current on the hull.
*Other sensors depend on the kind of ship. A pipelay ship may measure the force needed to pull on the pipe, large crane vessels will have sensors to determine the cranes position, as this changes the wind model, enabling the calculation of a more accurate model (see Control systems).
*Some external forces are not directly measured. In these cases, the offset force is deduced over a period of time, allowing an average value of compensating thrust to be applied. All forces not attributable to direct measurement are labeled &quot;current&quot;, as this is what they are assumed to be, but in reality this is a combination of current, waves, swell, and any errors in the system. As is traditional in the maritime industry, DP &quot;current&quot; is always recorded in the direction that it is flowing towards.

==Control systems==

In the beginning PID controllers were used and today are still used in the simpler DP systems. But modern controllers use a mathematical model of the ship that is based on a hydrodynamic and aerodynamic description concerning some of the ship&#x27;s characteristics such as mass and drag. Of course, this model is not entirely correct. The ship&#x27;s position and heading are fed into the system and compared with the prediction made by the model. This difference is used to update the model by using Kalman filtering technique. For this reason, the model also has input from the wind sensors and feedback from the thrusters. This method even allows not having input from any PRS for some time, depending on the quality of the model and the weather. This process is known as dead reckoning.

The accuracy and precision of the different PRSs is not the same. While a DGPS has a high accuracy and precision, a USBL can have a much lower precision. For this reason, the PRS&#x27;s are weighted. Based on variance a PRS receives a weight between 0 and 1.

==Power and propulsion systems==

To maintain position azimuth thrusters (electric, L-drive or Z-drive) bow thrusters, stern thrusters, water jets, rudders and propellers are used. DP ships are usually at least partially diesel-electric, as this allows a more flexible set-up and is better able to handle the large changes in power demand, typical for DP operations. These fluctuations may be suitable for hybrid operation. An LNG-powered platform supply vessel started operation in 2016 with a 653 kWh/1600 kW battery acting as spinning reserve during DP2, saving 15-30% fuel. The 154-meter North Sea Giant has combined 3 powerpacks, switchboards and 2 MWh batteries to operate in DP3 using only one engine, keeping the engine load between 60% and 80%.

The set-up depends on the DP class of the ship. A Class 1 can be relatively simple, whereas the system of a Class 3 ship is quite complex. On Class 2 and 3 ships, all computers and reference systems should be powered through a UPS.

==International Maritime Organization class requirements==
Based on IMO (International Maritime Organization) publication 645 the Classification Societies have issued rules for Dynamic Positioned Ships described as Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3.

*Equipment Class 1 has no redundancy.Loss of position may occur in the event of a single fault.
*Equipment Class 2 has redundancy so that no single fault in an active system will cause the system to fail.Loss of position should not occur from a single fault of an active component or system such as generators, thruster, switchboards, remote controlled valves etc., but may occur after failure of a static component such as cables, pipes, manual valves etc.
*Equipment Class 3 which also has to withstand fire or flood in any one compartment without the system failing.Loss of position should not occur from any single failure including a completely burnt fire subdivision or flooded watertight compartment.

Classification Societies have their own Class notations:
DNV rules 2011 Pt6 Ch7 introduced &quot;DPS&quot; series of classification to compete with ABS &quot;DPS&quot; series.

==Norwegian Maritime Authority Guidelines==
Where IMO leaves the decision of which class applies to what kind of operation to the operator of the DP ship and its client, the Norwegian Maritime Authority (NMA) has specified what Class should be used in regard to the risk of an operation. In the NMA Guidelines and Notes No. 28, enclosure A four classes are defined:

*Class 0 Operations where loss of position keeping capability is not considered to endanger human lives, or cause damage.
*Class 1 Operations where loss of position keeping capability may cause damage or pollution of small consequence.
*Class 2 Operations where loss of position keeping capability may cause personnel injury, pollution, or damage with large economic consequences.
*Class 3 Operations where loss of position keeping capability may cause fatal accidents, or severe pollution or damage with major economic consequences.

Based on this the type of ship is specified for each operation:
*Class 1 DP units with equipment class 1 should be used during operations where loss of position is not considered to endanger human lives, cause significant damage or cause more than minimal pollution.
*Class 2 DP units with equipment class 2 should be used during operations where loss of position could cause personnel injury, pollution or damage with great economic consequences.
*Class 3 DP units with equipment class 3 should be used during operations where loss of position could cause fatal accidents, severe pollution or damage with major economic consequences.

==Failure ==
Loss of position, also known as runoff, can be a threat to safe operations and the environment, including possible loss of life, injury, damage to property or the environment, and loss of reputation and time. Incident records indicate that even vessels with redundant dynamic positioning systems are subject to occasional loss of position, which can be due to human error, procedural failure, dynamic positioning system failures, or bad design. 
Dynamic positioning failure results in an inability to maintain position or heading control, and can be a drift off caused by insufficient thrust, or a drive off caused by inappropriate thrust.

*Risk of runoff
*Consequences – for drilling, diving and other operations. Injury to divers is possible, Damage to diving equipment including cutting of diver&#x27;s umbilical has occurred.
*Mitigation – dealing with a runoff; training and competence; emergency drills.

===Dynamic positioning alarm and runout response for bell divers===
*Code amber /Yellow alert – Divers return to the bell immediately, stow umbilicals, and stand by for further developments and instructions.
*Code red – Divers return to the bell without delaying to retrieve tools and prepare for immediate ascent. The bell can not be recovered until the umbilicals have been safely stowed.
The basic response with a closed bell is similar to wet bell, but after stowing umbilicals, the hatch will be sealed so that internal pressure can be retained. The bell will be recovered as rapidly as possible in a red alert, and may be recovered if there is doubt that a yellow alert will be downgraded.

===Redundancy===
Redundancy is the ability to withstand, while on DP mode, the loss of equipment which is online, without losing position or heading. A single failure can be, amongst others:
*Thruster failure
*Generator (power supply) failure
*Power bus failure (when generators are combined on one power bus)
*Control computer failure
*Position reference system failure
*Reference system failure

For certain operations redundancy is not required. For instance, if a survey ship loses its DP capability, there is normally no risk of damage or injuries. These operations will normally be done in Class 1.

For other operations, such as diving and heavy lifting, there is a risk of damage or injuries. Depending on the risk, the operation is done in Class 2 or 3. This means at least three Position reference systems should be selected. This allows the principle of voting logic, so the failing PRS can be found. For this reason, there are also three DP control computers, three gyrocompasses, three MRU&#x27;s and three wind sensors on Class 3 ships. If a single fault occurs that jeopardizes the redundancy, i.e., failing of a thruster, generator or a PRS, and this cannot be resolved immediately, the operation should be abandoned as quickly as possible.

To have sufficient redundancy, enough generators and thrusters should be on-line so the failure of one does not result in a loss of position. This is left to the judgment of the DP operator. For Class 2 and Class 3 a Consequence Analysis should be incorporated in the system to assist the DPO in this process.

The redundancy of a DP ship should be judged by a failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) study and proved by FMEA trials. Besides that, annual trials are done and normally DP function tests are completed prior to each project.

==DP operator==
The DP operator (DPO) judges whether there is enough redundancy available at any given moment of the operation. IMO issued MSC/Circ.738 (Guidelines for dynamic positioning system (DP) operator training) on 24-06-1996. This refers to IMCA (International Marine Contractors Association) M 117 as acceptable standard.

To qualify as a DP operator the following path should be followed:
#a DP Induction course + On-line Examination
#a minimum of 60 days seagoing DP familiarisation
#a DP Advanced course + On-line Examination
#a minimum of 60 days watchkeeping on a DP ship
#a statement of suitability by the master of a DP ship

When the watchkeeping is done on a Class 1 DP ship, a limited certificate will be issued; otherwise a full certificate will be issued.

The DP training and certification scheme is operated by The Nautical Institute (NI). The NI issue logbooks to trainees, they accredit training centres and control the issuance of certification.

With ever more DP ships and with increasing manpower demands, the position of DPO is gaining increasing prominence. This shifting landscape led to the creation of The International Dynamic Positioning Operators Association (IDPOA) in 2009. www.dpoperators.org

IDPOA membership is made up of certified DPO&#x27;s who qualify for fellowship (fDPO), while Members (mDPO) are those with DP experience or who may already be working within the DP certification scheme.

==International Marine Contractors Association==
The International Marine Contractors Association was formed in April 1995 from the amalgamation of the Dynamic Positioning Vessel Owners Association, founded in 1990, and the International Association of Offshore Diving Contractors, founded in 1972.

While it started with the collection and analysis of DP Incidents, since then it has produced publications on different subjects to improve standards for DP systems. It also works with IMO and other regulatory bodies.

== Marine Technology Society Dynamic Positioning Committee ==
The Marine Technology Society Dynamic Positioning (DP) Committee&#x27;s mission is to facilitate incident free DP operations through sharing of knowledge. This committee of dedicated volunteers delivers value to the DP community of vessel owners, operators, Marine Class Societies, engineers and regulators through an annual DP Conference, topical workshops and an extensive set of Guidance Documents covering DP Design Philosophy, DP Operations and Professional Development of DP Personnel. In addition, a growing set of unique documents called TECHOP&#x27;s address specific topics of significant interest and impact. Conference papers are available for download by the public, providing the most comprehensive single source of DP industry technical papers available anywhere.

The DP Guidance documents published by the MTS DP Committee are designed to disseminate the knowledge, methods and unique tools to aid the DP community in achieving incident free DP operations. The documents are free to download from the Committee&#x27;s website http://dynamic-positioning.com

<text>Murderecords is an independent record label that releases the music of the Canadian rock band Sloan. Originally formed in 1992 to produce just the records of that band, it later released work of other bands including Eric&#x27;s Trip, The Hardship Post, Al Tuck, Stinkin&#x27; Rich, Hip Club Groove, The Inbreds, Thrush Hermit, and The Super Friendz, and was Canada&#x27;s best-known indie label in the 1990s. Later, the roster was stripped bare, and released Sloan albums exclusively for nearly a decade. In 2008, however, albums by Will Currie and the Country French and Pony Da Look were released by the label.

<doc id="295610" wikidata="Q11729628" url="?curid=295610" title="Bluestocking">
<text>Bluestocking (also spaced blue-stocking or blue stockings) is a derogatory term for an educated, intellectual woman, originally a member of the 18th-century Blue Stockings Society from England led by the hostess and critic Elizabeth Montagu (1718–1800), the “Queen of the Blues”, including Elizabeth Vesey (1715–1791), Hester Chapone (1727–1801) and the classicist Elizabeth Carter (1717–1806). In the following generation came Hester Lynch Piozzi (1741–1821), Hannah More (1745–1833) and Frances Burney (1752–1840). The term now more broadly applies to women who show interest in literary or intellectual matters.

Until the late 18th century, the term had referred to learned people of both sexes. It was later applied primarily to intellectual women and the French equivalent &quot;bas bleu&quot; had a similar connotation. The term later developed negative implications and is now often used in a derogatory manner. The reference to blue stockings may arise from the time when woollen worsted stockings were informal dress, in contrast to formal, fashionable black silk stockings. The most frequent such reference is to a man, Benjamin Stillingfleet, who reportedly lacked the formal black stockings, yet participated in the Blue Stockings Society. As Frances Burney, a Bluestocking, recounts the events, she reveals that Stillingfleet was invited to a literary meeting by Elizabeth Vesey but was told off because of his informal attire. Her response was “don’t mind dress! Come in your blue stockings!”.

==History==
The Blue Stockings Society was a literary society led by Elizabeth Montagu and others in the 1750s in England. Elizabeth Montagu was a social anomaly in the period because she took possession of her husband’s property when he died, allowing her to have more power in her world. This society was founded by women, and included many prominent members of English society, both male and female, including Harriet Bowdler, Edmund Burke, Sarah Fielding, Samuel Johnson, and Frances Pulteney. &quot;M.P.&quot;, an 1811 comic opera by Thomas Moore and Charles Edward Horn, was subtitled &quot;The Blue Stocking&quot;. It contained a character, Lady Bab Blue, who was a parody of bluestockings.

A reference to bluestockings has been attributed to John Amos Comenius in his 1638 book, where he mentioned ancient traditions of women being excluded from higher education, citing the Bible and Euripides. That second reference, though, comes from Keatinge&#x27;s 1896 translation and is not present in Comenius&#x27;s Latin text. The name may have been applied in the 15th century to the blue stockings worn by the members of the &quot;Compagnie della Calza&quot; in Venice, which then was adopted in Paris and London; in the 17th century to the Covenanters in Scotland, who wore unbleached woollen stockings, in contrast to the bleached or dyed stockings of the more affluent. In 1870 Henry D. Wheatley noted that Elizabeth Montagu’s coterie were named “blue stockings” after the blue worsted stockings worn by the naturalist Benjamin Stillingfleet.

William Hazlitt said, “The bluestocking is the most odious character in society...she sinks wherever she is placed, like the yolk of an egg, to the bottom, and carries the filth with her”.

==Recent use==

In Japan, a literary magazine &quot;Seitō&quot; (Bluestocking) was launched in 1911 under the leadership of Raichō Hiratsuka. It ran until 1916, providing a creative outlet and political platform for Japanese feminists even as it faced public outcry and state censorship.

The Toledo Blue Stockings was a major league baseball team in Toledo, Ohio, from 1883 to 1885. Historically, the team is best known for being the only major league team with black players (Moses Fleetwood Walker and his brother, Weldy) until Jackie Robinson&#x27;s appearance with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947.

Bluestockings is the name of a volunteer-run and collectively owned radical bookstore, fair-trade café, and activist center located on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York City, which opened in 1999.

&quot;The Bluestocking&quot; is the yearbook of Mary Baldwin College, a traditionally all-women’s school in Staunton, Virginia.

&quot;Blue Stocking&quot; was an “unabashedly feminist&quot; (its tagline) newspaper published in Portland, Oregon, from 1993 to 1996.

<text>Valldemossa () is a village and municipality on the island of Mallorca, part of the Spanish autonomous community of the Balearic Islands. It is famous for one landmark: the Royal Charterhouse of Valldemossa, built at the beginning of the 14th century, when the mystic and philosopher Ramon Llull lived in this area of Mallorca.
Since the 19th century Valldemossa has been promoted internationally as a place of outstanding beauty, largely as a result of the affection of distinguished traveller and cultural writer, the Austrian Archduke Ludwig Salvator. Valldemossa is the birthplace of Catalina Thomas, Mallorca&#x27;s patron saint.

==History==
In the year 1399, the king of Aragon, Martin the Humane, donated his summer residence, the Royal Palace of Valdemossa, to the Carthusian Order. This order had been founded by Bruno of Cologne in 1084 and its monasteries were known as charterhouses according to its motherhouse, Chatreuse, which is why the building is called today the Valldemossa Charterhouse. The charterhouse was populated by twelve monks, a prior and several lay brothers who performed menial work around the charterhouse. Catalina Thomas, the patron saint of Mallorca, was born here in 1533. The town was pillaged by Muslim raiders in the year 1552. 

In the 1830s the Spanish government confiscated monasteries and the historic estate was sold to private owners, who have since hosted some prominent guests. These have included the Polish composer Frédéric Chopin and his lover the pioneering French writer Amantine-Lucile-Aurore Dupin, better known by her pseudonym George Sand, who wrote a notable account of &quot;A Winter in Majorca,&quot; describing their 1838–39 visit and praising the island&#x27;s natural beauty, but criticizing what she perceived as the prejudice and vices of the natives.

Later the Nicaraguan poet Rubén Darío was guest of the Sureda y Montaner families who own the Chartreuse estate. To fight his own nightmares Rubén Dario would sleep in monk habits; however, his drinking habits caused a rift with his private hosts and thus his departure from the former monastery and from Majorca.

Also Jorge Luis Borges lived in the town with his parents and his sister Norah, after the First World War let them free from their refuge in Geneva. Borges passionate friendship with the young artist Jacobo Sureda Montaner, son of the painter Pilar Montaner, was decisive for Borges writing mainly in Spanish.

Until the elections of 2007 the town&#x27;s mayor was the only one in the democratic Kingdom of Spain to remain in office from the times of the Francoist dictatorship, which legally disappeared as the current Spanish Constitution of 1978 was passed.

==Chopin and Sand in Valldemossa==

In October 1836, Chopin met a French writer George Sand (Aurore Dudevant) at Liszt&#x27;s house. In the summer of 1838, Sand and Chopin became lovers. They spent the following winter from 8 November 1838 to 11 February 1839 together with Sand’s two children in Mallorca. At first, they stayed in Palma de Mallorca and then at the Charterhouse in Valldemossa.

After a month, Chopin was writing about Valldemossa, complaining about the weather and local cuisine. The Mediterranean climate was to agree with the composer; however, that year’s winter was particularly rainy and Chopin caught a cold. On top of that, the piano that was imported from Europe especially for him, was lost during the transport. After the piano was found, it was waiting for weeks at the Palma port for the duty to be paid. During this time, Chopin was forced to play on a poor Majorcan piano. Despite the difficulties, he worked on his next pieces. It was in Mallorca where the collection of 24 preludes was completed (including prelude in D-flat major nicknamed &quot;Raindrop&quot;).

After the departure of Chopin and Sand there was little left behind of their stay, due to the locals burning most of the furniture from the rooms the lovers had lived in out of concerns about tuberculosis. Museums dedicated to the famous couple are located in the monastery cells 2 and 4. Memorabilia collected there include letters and manuscripts, portraits and sketches, as well as the Majorcan piano on which Chopin had been composing since January 1836. There are also a Chopin&#x27;s death mask and a lock of his hair, preserved in a George Sand&#x27;s book. The museum is private and was founded in 1929 by Anne-Marie Boutroux de Ferrà and her husband Bartomeu Ferrà i Juan.

The Chopin Festival organised by Festivals Chopin de Valldemossa has been held since 1930 in August at the Carthusian monastery.

In cell 4, visitors can see the Pleyel piano ordered by the composer in Paris, which arrived in Valldemossa three weeks before his departure. When Chopin and Sand were leaving, they did not want to pay a high duty for the second time and left the piano to the director of the bank where Sand had opened an account. The piano was passed on in the banker’s family from one generation to another. Its current owners are the heirs of the bank director, the Quetglas brothers, who administer Chopin’s and Sand’s cell. The instrument is the greatest pride of their Chopin museum.

==Tourism==
Valldemossa is a popular tourist destination in the Balearic Islands of Spain. One of the main attractions is the 13th century monastery, where the musician Frederic Chopin spent a winter (1838–39). The monastery was originally built as a royal palace; however, in 1399 it was converted into a monastery.

Actor Michael Douglas and actress Catherine Zeta-Jones have a coastal estate near Valldemossa. 

===Events and festivals===
Festivals that take place in Valldemossa include:
*Festes de la Beata: takes place during July 28, celebrates the Patron Saint of Valldemossa. Many parades take place on the streets during this festival.
*Festival of Saint Bartomeu: on 24 August, also celebrates the Patron Saint. There are performances in the Cloisters of the Monastery.

<doc id="295619" wikidata="Q1007098" url="?curid=295619" title="Kangerlussuaq">
<text>Kangerlussuaq (; ; ) is a settlement in western Greenland in the Qeqqata municipality located at the head of the fjord of the same name. It was Greenland&#x27;s main air transport hub and the site of Greenland&#x27;s largest commercial airport until the new airport opened at Nuuk on 28 November 2024. The airport dates from American settlement during and after World War II, when the site was known as Bluie West-8 and then Sondrestrom Air Base.

The Kangerlussuaq area is also home to Greenland&#x27;s most diverse terrestrial fauna, including muskoxen, caribou, and gyrfalcons. The settlement&#x27;s economy and population of 508 is almost entirely reliant on the airport and tourist industry. It is the only town in Greenland which is not located on the proper ocean, being situated at the end of a 160 km long fjord, although it still has a coastline on the ocean.

== Geography ==

Kangerlussuaq occupies an alluvial flatland on the far end of the 190 km long Kangerlussuaq Fjord, straddling both sides of the Qinnguata Kuussua river estuary. On the East of Kangerlussuaq is a confluence of the two major regional rivers, the Qinnguata Kuussua and Akuliarusiarsuup Kuua. The valley of the latter forms large quicksand plains. Both rivers originate from the Russell Glacier. The edge of the glacier is easily accessible and is a major tourist attraction from the town, as is the edge of the ice sheet in the Isunngua highlands to its northeast.

Highlands such as Tarajornitsut bound Kangerlussuaq from the north and south. To the southeast behind lake Tasersuatsiaq, which provides fresh water to the town, is the vast highland of Ammalortup Nunaa, the original region artificially populated with 27 muskoxen.

The town is situated about north of the Arctic Circle, and is the starting point for the Arctic Circle Trail.

==History==
Kangerlussuaq was founded at the east end of Kangerlussuaq fjord as Bluie West-8 on 7 October 1941, under the supervision of Colonel Bernt Balchen of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Following the fall of Denmark to Germany in World War II, US forces assumed security for Greenland, building several bases including Bluie West-1 to the south in Narsarsuaq and Bluie West-8 at the Kangerlussuaq fjord.

The base briefly came under Danish control in 1950, but following mounting concerns about the Cold War threat, a new agreement saw the United States reopen Bluie West-8 under the name of Sondrestrom Air Base on 27 April 1951.

It served as one of the Distant Early Warning Line bases and a supply station for similar early warning facilities. Following the fall of the Soviet Union, the usefulness of the base was greatly diminished and the last U.S. Air Force personnel left the base on 30 September 1992. The base subsequently came under Greenlandic Home Rule and was renamed using the Kalaallisut dialect of the West Greenland Inuit.

This site and Bluie West-1 in Narsarsuaq remain Greenland&#x27;s best-equipped airports. Almost all of the permanent structures in the town were built during the American occupation of the site.

==Climate==
The climate in Kangerlussuaq is subarctic (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;), bordering on tundra climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;) and unusually for somewhere this far north (in the Arctic Circle), a cold-semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;), with the area receiving very little rainfall.

In July 2012 a gust of warm air resulted in glacier meltwater which wiped out a key crossing of the Watson River.

== Population ==
The population of Kangerlussuaq dropped significantly after the liquidation of the Sondrestrom Air Base. Since then it has increased by more than 80%, although it has begun dropping again in recent years.

== Transport ==
=== Air ===
Until November 2024, Kangerlussuaq Airport was the only civilian airport in Greenland large enough to support large long-range airplanes such as Boeing 747s, so it long served as Greenland&#x27;s most important transport hub. Hotel Kangerlussuaq operates at the airport.

=== Sea ===
Kangerlussuaq Fjord is navigable in its entire length. There is a seaport at Kangerlussuaq, west of Kangerlussuaq Airport. It is fairly shallow and suitable for small ships only, mainly used by supply ships of the Royal Arctic Line, and unusable in winter. Cruise ships, such as Norway&#x27;s Hurtigruten, navigate the fjord, anchoring outside the port. They go to Kangerlussuaq mainly to exchange passengers by air, because the travel time to and from Greenland is too long for many passengers.

Plans were approved in 2018 to build a new deep port, around west of the present one, together with a road to it.

=== Road ===
Kangerlussuaq has the largest road network outside any settlement in Greenland (not counting streets inside the settlement).

A gravel road through Isunngua connects Kangerlussuaq with the ice sheet, initially serving as venue for car endurance experiments. Since then it has been mainly used for tourist purposes.

There are plans to construct a road to Sisimiut () as of 2017. The cost estimates have been between 250 and 500 million Danish kroner (DKK), depending on road quality, and therefore the plans are delayed. The drive time would be much longer than the fly time, and there are also considerations to move the main hub of Air Greenland to Nuuk Airport, closing Kangerlussuaq airport.

A road to Sisimiut with a low quality, aimed to off-road vehicles was built 2020-2021, at a cost of 25 million DKK. There are hopes that the road will be rebuilt to a proper paved road in future.

==Scientific research==
From 1982 to 2018, an ionospheric and atmospheric research facility known as the Sondrestrom Upper Atmospheric Research Facility was situated at about west of Kangerlussuaq. It was commonly known around the town as Kellyville. It was operated by SRI International for the U.S. National Science Foundation and the Danish Meteorological Institute. The facility was host to more than 20 instruments, the majority of which provide unique and complementary information about the arctic upper atmosphere. The centerpiece instrument of the facility was an L band incoherent scatter (IS) radar with a fully steerable antenna. It was transported from Alaska to Kangerlussuaq in 1983.

<text>The Cullinan Diamond is the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever found, weighing , discovered at the Premier No.2 mine in Cullinan, South Africa, on 26 January 1905. It was named after Thomas Cullinan, the owner of the mine. In April 1905, it was put on sale in London, but despite considerable interest, it was still unsold after two years. In 1907, the Transvaal Colony government bought the Cullinan and Prime Minister Louis Botha presented it to Edward VII. It was then cut by Joseph Asscher &amp; Co. in Amsterdam. 

Cullinan produced stones of various cuts and sizes, the largest of which is named Cullinan I, and named the Great Star of Africa by Edward VII, and at it is the largest clear cut diamond in the world. The stone is mounted in the head of the Sovereign&#x27;s Sceptre with Cross. The second-largest is Cullinan II or the Second Star of Africa, weighing , mounted in the Imperial State Crown. Both are part of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom. Seven other major diamonds, weighing a total of , were privately owned by Elizabeth II, who inherited them from her grandmother, Queen Mary, in 1953. The Queen also owned minor brilliants and a set of unpolished fragments.

== Discovery and early history ==

The Cullinan is estimated to have formed in Earth&#x27;s mantle transition zone at a depth of 410–660 km (255–410 miles) and reached the surface 1.18 billion years ago. It was found below the surface at Premier Mine in Cullinan, Transvaal Colony, by Frederick Wells, surface manager at the mine, on 26 January 1905. It was approximately long, wide, deep, and weighed . Newspapers called it the &quot;Cullinan Diamond&quot;, a reference to Sir Thomas Cullinan, who opened the mine in 1902. It was three times the size of the Excelsior Diamond, found in 1893 at Jagersfontein Mine, weighing . Four of its eight surfaces were smooth, indicating that it once had been part of a much larger stone broken up by natural forces. It had a blue-white hue and contained a small pocket of air, which at certain angles produced a rainbow, or Newton&#x27;s rings.

Shortly after its discovery, Cullinan went on public display at the Standard Bank in Johannesburg, where it was seen by an estimated 8,000–9,000 visitors. In April 1905, the rough gem was deposited with Premier Mining Co.&#x27;s London sales agent, S. Neumann &amp; Co. Due to its immense value, detectives were assigned to a steamboat that was rumoured to be carrying the stone, and a parcel was ceremoniously locked in the captain&#x27;s safe and guarded on the entire journey. It was a diversionary tactic – the stone on that ship was fake, meant to attract those who would be interested in stealing it. Cullinan was sent to the United Kingdom in a plain box via registered post. On arriving in London, it was conveyed to Buckingham Palace for inspection by King Edward VII. Although it drew considerable interest from potential buyers, Cullinan went unsold for two years.

===Presentation to Edward VII===
Transvaal Prime Minister Louis Botha suggested buying the diamond for Edward VII as &quot;a token of the loyalty and attachment of the people of the Transvaal to His Majesty&#x27;s throne and person&quot;. In August 1907, a vote was held in the Legislative Council on the Cullinan&#x27;s fate, and a motion authorising the purchase was carried by 42 votes in favour to 19 against. Initially, Henry Campbell-Bannerman, then British Prime Minister, advised the king to decline the offer, but he later decided to let Edward VII choose whether or not to accept the gift. Eventually, he was persuaded by Winston Churchill, then Colonial Under-Secretary. For his trouble, Churchill was sent a replica, which he enjoyed showing off to guests on a silver plate. The Transvaal Colony government bought the diamond on 17 October 1907 for £150,000, which adjusted for pound-sterling inflation is equivalent to £ in . Due to a 60% tax on mining profits, the Treasury received some of its money back from the Premier Diamond Mining Company.

The diamond was presented to the king at Sandringham House by Agent-General of the colony, Sir Richard Solomon, on 9 November 1907 – his 66th birthday – in the presence of a large party of guests, including the Queen of Sweden, the Queen of Spain, the Duke of Westminster and Lord Revelstoke. The king asked his colonial secretary, Lord Elgin, to announce that he accepted the gift &quot;for myself and my successors&quot; and that he would ensure &quot;this great and unique diamond be kept and preserved among the historic jewels which form the heirlooms of the Crown&quot;. King Edward gave the larger diamond the name &quot;Great Star of Africa&quot;, while the smaller diamond was named the &quot;Smaller Star of Africa&quot;.

===Cutting process===

The king chose Joseph Asscher &amp; Co. of Amsterdam to cleave and polish the rough stone into brilliant gems of various cuts and sizes. Abraham Asscher collected it from the Colonial Office in London on 23 January 1908. He returned to the Netherlands by train and ferry with the diamond in his coat pocket. Meanwhile, to much fanfare, a Royal Navy ship carried an empty box across the North Sea, again throwing off potential thieves. Even the captain was unaware that his &quot;precious&quot; cargo was a decoy.

On 10 February 1908, the rough stone was split in half by Joseph Asscher at his diamond-cutting factory in Amsterdam. At the time, technology had not yet evolved to guarantee the quality of modern standards, and cutting the diamond was difficult and risky. After weeks of planning, an incision deep was made to enable Asscher to cleave the diamond in one blow. Making the incision alone took four days, and a steel knife broke on the first attempt, but a second knife was fitted into the groove and split the stone cleanly in two along one of four possible cleavage planes. In all, splitting and cutting the diamond took eight months, with three people working 14 hours per day to complete the task.

&quot;The tale is told of Joseph Asscher, the greatest cleaver of the day,&quot; wrote Matthew Hart in his book &quot;Diamond: A Journey to the Heart of an Obsession&quot; (2002), &quot;that when he prepared to cleave the largest diamond ever known … he had a doctor and nurse standing by and when he finally struck the diamond … he fainted dead away&quot;. Lord Ian Balfour, in his book &quot;Famous Diamonds&quot; (2009), dispels the fainting story, suggesting it was more likely Joseph would have celebrated, opening a bottle of champagne. When Joseph&#x27;s nephew Louis heard the story, he exclaimed &quot;No Asscher would ever faint over any operation on any diamond&quot;.

==Diamonds cut from the Cullinan==
Cullinan produced 9 major stones of in total, plus 96 minor brilliants and some unpolished fragments weighing . All but the two largest stones – Cullinans I and II – remained in Amsterdam by arrangement as the fee for Asscher&#x27;s services, until the South African government bought them (except Cullinan VI, which Edward VII had purchased and given to his wife Queen Alexandra in 1907), and the High Commissioner for Southern Africa presented them to Queen Mary on 28 June 1910. Mary also inherited Cullinan VI from Alexandra, and she left all her Cullinan diamonds to her granddaughter Elizabeth II in 1953. Cullinans I and II are part of the Crown Jewels, which belong to the monarch in right of the Crown.

Asscher sold the minor stones to the South African government, which distributed them to Queen Mary; Louis Botha, the then prime minister of South Africa; the diamond merchants Arthur and Alexander Levy, who supervised the cutting of Cullinan; and Jacob Romijn (later Romyn), who co-founded the first trade union in the diamond industry. Some were set by Mary into a long platinum chain, which Elizabeth never wore in public, saying that &quot;it gets in the soup&quot;. In the 1960s, two minor Cullinan diamonds owned by Louis Botha&#x27;s heirs were analysed at the De Beers laboratory in Johannesburg and found to be completely free of nitrogen or any other impurities. Cullinans I and II were examined in the 1980s by gemologists at the Tower of London and both graded as colourless type IIa.

===Cullinan I===

Cullinan I, or the Great Star of Africa, is a pendeloque cut brilliant weighing and has 74 facets. It is set at the top of the Sovereign&#x27;s Sceptre with Cross, made in 1661, which had to be redesigned in 1910 to accommodate it. Cullinan I was surpassed as the world&#x27;s largest cut diamond by the brown Golden Jubilee Diamond in 1992, but remains the largest colourless cut diamond in the world. In terms of clarity, it has a few tiny cleavages and a small patch of graining. The diamond is fitted with loops and can be taken out of its setting to be worn as a pendant suspended from Cullinan II to make a brooch. Queen Mary, wife of George V, often wore it like this. In 1908, the stone was valued at US$2.5 million (equivalent to US$ million in )– two and a half times the rough Cullinan&#x27;s estimated value.

===Cullinan II===
Cullinan II, or the Second Star of Africa, is a cushion-cut brilliant with 66 facets weighing set in the front of the Imperial State Crown, below the Black Prince&#x27;s Ruby (a large red spinel). It measures . The diamond has a number of tiny flaws, scratches on the table facet, and a small chip at the girdle. Like Cullinan I, it is held in place by a yellow gold enclosure, which is screwed onto the crown.

===Cullinan III===
Cullinan III, or the Lesser Star of Africa, is pear-cut and weighs . In 1911 Queen Mary, wife and queen consort of George V, had it set in the top cross pattée of a crown that she personally bought for her coronation. In 1912 the Delhi Durbar Tiara, worn the previous year by Mary instead of a crown at the Delhi Durbar, where her husband wore the Imperial Crown of India, was also adapted to take Cullinans III and IV. Elizabeth II frequently wore Cullinan III in combination with Cullinan IV as a brooch. In total, the brooch is long and wide. Cullinan III has also been used as a pendant on the Coronation Necklace, where it occasionally replaced the Lahore Diamond.

===Cullinan IV===

Cullinan IV, also referred to as a Lesser Star of Africa, is square-cut and weighs . In 1911 it was first set in the base of Queen Mary&#x27;s Crown. In 1914 both III and IV were replaced with crystal replicas, until 2023, when the diamonds were re-set in the crown for use by Queen Camilla. On 25 March 1958, while she and Prince Philip were on a state visit to the Netherlands, Queen Elizabeth II revealed that Cullinan III and IV are known in her family as &quot;Granny&#x27;s Chips&quot;. They visited the Asscher Diamond Company, where Cullinan had been cut 50 years earlier. It was the first time the Queen had worn the brooch publicly. During her visit, she unpinned the brooch and offered it for examination to Louis Asscher, nephew of Joseph Asscher, who split the rough diamond. Aged 84, he was deeply moved that the Queen had brought the diamonds with her, knowing how much it would mean to him seeing them again after so many years.

===Cullinan V===
Cullinan V is an heart-shaped diamond set in the centre of a platinum brooch that formed a part of the stomacher made for Queen Mary to wear at the Delhi Durbar in 1911. The brooch was designed to show off Cullinan V and is pavé-set with a border of smaller diamonds. It can be suspended from the VIII brooch and can be used to suspend the VII pendant. It was often worn like this by Mary. In May 2023, the brooch was placed on the front of cross Queen Mary&#x27;s Crown for the Coronation of Queen Camilla instead of the traditional and controversial Koh-i-Noor.

===Cullinan VI===
Cullinan VI is marquise-cut and weighs . It hangs from the brooch containing Cullinan VIII and forming part of the stomacher of the Delhi Durbar parure. Cullinan VI along with VIII can also be fitted together to make yet another brooch, surrounded by some 96 smaller diamonds. The design was created around the same time that the Cullinan V heart-shaped brooch was designed, both having a similar shape.

===Cullinan VII===
Cullinan VII is also marquise-cut and weighs . It was originally given by Edward VII to his wife and consort Queen Alexandra. After his death she gave the jewel to Queen Mary, who had it set as a pendant hanging from the diamond-and-emerald Delhi Durbar necklace, part of the parure.

===Cullinan VIII===
Cullinan VIII is an oblong-cut diamond weighing . It is set in the centre of a brooch forming part of the stomacher of the Delhi Durbar parure. Together with Cullinan VI it forms a brooch.

===Cullinan IX===
Cullinan IX is smallest of the principal diamonds to be obtained from the rough Cullinan. It is a pendeloque or stepped pear-cut stone, weighs , and is set in a platinum ring known as the Cullinan IX Ring.

<text>Gerald Dallas Royston Marshall (16 November 1941 – 21 April 2005) was a British racing driver. He was commonly referred to by the nickname &quot;Big Gerry&quot;. According to a 2002 edition of Motor Sport Magazine poll, he was one of the best drivers of all time. According to the 28 August 2019 edition of Motorsport News, he is the United Kingdom&#x27;s number one British motorsport hero. He was awarded the BARC Gold Medal in 2002, the first saloon car driver to be presented with the honour and was a life member of the prestigious BRDC. He took 625 overall and class wins and countless championship wins throughout his motor racing career.

He was also well known in motoring circles for his successful car dealership, Marshall Wingfield, originally located on the Finchley Road, London, before moving to Brook Street in Tring and through his adult life lived in Harrow, Chiswell Green, Bricket Wood, Hemel Hempstead, Northchurch, Aston Clinton and Pitstone.

His ashes are buried at St. Leonards Church in Southoe, where his grandparents are also buried - he was relocated locally during the Second World War.

== Career ==
His professional driving career spans five decades, in 2000 chalking up his 600th win in a race at Snetterton Motor Racing Circuit, Norfolk in an Aston Martin DB4. His first Sprint victory was in 1963 driving a Mini, with his first race win following in 1964 (again in a Mini) and his last (and 625th) on 11 September 2004.

He is probably best remembered for his flamboyant and crowd-pleasing style during the 1970s driving for Dealer Team Vauxhall in the racing Firenzas &quot;Old Nail&quot; and &quot;Baby Bertha&quot;, and also the V8 Holden-Repco Ventora, &quot;Big Bertha&quot;. He also won the 1971 Escort Mexico championship, beating future Formula 1 World Champion Jody Scheckter and finished 2nd in the 1974 Avon Tour of Britain driving for the same team as the equally respected rally driver Roger Clark.

Marshall&#x27;s style has been described as &quot;sideways, on-the-edge cornering that was to distinguish his driving in any car, large or small, front or rear drive.&quot; This outward appearance belied an extraordinary cool-headed ability and intelligence behind the wheel.

His first biography, published in 1978, is titled &quot;Only Here For The Beer&quot; and a tribute edition was re-issued shortly after his death and his new biography (published by Haynes and written by Jeremy Walton and Gregor Marshall) was released in April 2010.

He died of a heart related illness whilst testing the ex-Richard Petty&#x27;s IROC Chevrolet Camaro at Silverstone. His son, Gregor, is also a race driver and he also has two daughters.

Some of Marshall&#x27;s career highlights:

In 1963, Marshall started his first footsteps into motor journalism, something he was to enjoy for many years and he brought a smile to the face of many a reader with his &quot;Marshall Art&quot; and &quot;From the Hot Seat&quot; columns that he regularly used to write. You could often find club event reports in Autosport with glowing tributes to a Gerry Marshall and then notice at the end of the report that it was written by a certain GDRM, G.Marshall or G.Maynard (his first wife&#x27;s maiden name).

Marshall&#x27;s first official race was at Brands Hatch in March 1964 and in qualifying he was quickest in his class, but the weather (for once) and lady luck conspired against him and the race was snowed off. Therefore, Marshall&#x27;s first proper race was at Snetterton on the Easter Monday of 1964. Beginning what would quickly become a habit, he won the 1000cc class and continued winning that season. Although he rolled the car at Mallory Park in practice he was able to keep racing until money and impending engagement (to Carol) forced the sale of the Mini and absence from the tracks for a few months.

Driving Newtune&#x27;s 1275s in the Snetterton 500 km with David Warnsborough the pair won the 1300 cc class in the European Saloon Car Championship race.

Whilst working in London for Robbie Gordon and James Boothby he was offered a drive in June 1965 in a TVR Grantura. Marshall handled this with his usual verve and impressed Martin Lilley of Barnet Motor Company enough for him to offer a drive in a Lotus Elan and Marshall also went to work for the Barnet Motor Company, becoming sales manager and a director of TVR.

This change for Marshall proved to be a good one and as the sales manager he got to buy and sell many sports, GT and competition cars. Towards the end of 1965 and at the beginning of 1966 Marshall had a string of wins at Brands Hatch and also drove the company&#x27;s TVR Griffith. It was reported at the time &quot;This was a converted road car and only had a mildly-tweaked V8 motor, but it still went like stink!&quot;. With this car Marshall enhanced his blossoming reputation and photographers rushed out of their usual hiding spots whenever he was on track and got dramatic pictures of Marshall driving the TVR in his now customary sideways fashion. &quot;It was the only way to drive the car&quot; said Marshall, &quot;although the Elan had to be driven neatly&quot;.

Also in 1966 Marshall raced Roy Ensor&#x27;s 1275 Mini-Cooper S and a near-standard TVR 1800S Mk 3 in marque events, with some success. In the Brands Hatch six-hour race the car was very well placed when a wheel fell off with only a few minutes to go. Marshall and co-driver, his great friend Tony Lanfranchi, had got the car extremely well-placed whilst it was wet at the beginning of the race and it was only towards the end of the race when the track started to dry that several more potent cars managed to pass them.

&quot;The meeting Gerry Marshall will want to forget&quot; was the headline Auto News gave for a Brands Hatch sprint in the July. On a wet track Marshall had aquaplaned off the circuit at Paddock Hill Bend and pretty much wrote off the Barnet Motor Company&#x27;s Elan, which had only been raced a handful of times. A week later, with a couple of broken ribs strapped up, Marshall raced a TVR at Silverstone in the Six-Hour Relay Race and there he lost a wheel twice.

In 1966 Marshall won numerous club races and gained publicity for the Barnet Motor Company. With Martin Lilley now being in charge of TVR Engineering (him and his father had rescued TVR from bankruptcy) Marshall&#x27;s racing plans for 1967 seemed to naturally revolve around TVR; the TVR Griffith was ideal, especially with the planned 400 bhp 5.3 litre Ford V8, there was the possibility of the 1-litre TVR Tina (named after Marshall&#x27;s eldest daughter and one of the two prototypes is owned by the Marshall family) and also the TVR 1800S. In addition Marshall had the use of a Lotus Elan and there was a plan to go into partnership with Ken Ayres in a hot Mini 850.

Marshall also wanted to prove his &quot;sideways&quot; critics wrong by racing a single-seater and in one of the Motor Racing Stables Lotus cars at Brands Hatch he had already lapped as fast as the senior instructors.

As reported in &quot;Sporting Motorist&quot; &quot;Gerry Marshall really gets to grips with his motor cars and flings them about with such gay abandon that people expect him to fly off the road – he has been named the Jochen Rindt of club racing, also the Mr. Dunlop Benefit (by commentator Barry Simons) but he rarely does and more often than not wins&quot;.

The 1970s really were Marshall&#x27;s most prolific decade of motor racing. Club motor racing in Britain then was on the BBC every week (on Grandstand). It has always been widely reported that Marshall was not shy and retiring and this made him ideal for interviews, quotes, guest speaking at club and charity events and columns (he wrote in Car and Car Conversions, Motor and Autosport). He even had several films made, including Barry Hinchcliff&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s Only One Gerry&quot;, and the publications of &quot;Only Here for the Beer&quot; and &quot;Competition Driving&quot;.

Not only was there the numerous race and championship wins for Marshall in the DTV Vauxhalls but there was also his own forays into racing cars of his own, sponsoring others (including F1 World Champion Denis Hulme, Tony Lanfranchi and offering Colin Chapman and Graham Hill a drive in Marshall&#x27;s Lotus XI) and his business, Marshall Wingfield, in partnership with John Wingfield.

Marshall also won the final car meeting to be held at Crystal Palace in 1972. Run by AMOC, the final race was a Historic Sports Car race. Marshall won in a Lister Jaguar, WTM446.

Marshall raced Lotus Elans, the special Costin Amigo, Ford Escorts (winning the inaugural Mexico Championship from Jody Scheckter in 1971 and also finishing runner up to Roger Clark in the 1974 Avon Tour of Britain), Lola T70, Holden Torana at Bathurst, Hillman Avenger, Clan Crusader, Austin Marina, Birdcage Maserati, Mk2 Jaguar, Sunbeam Tiger Le Mans, Porsche 924, an Alfa Romeo, Chevrolet Camaro and BMWs.

Marshall competed in hundreds of events, ranging from the one-make Ford Escort Mexico Championship, competed in many rallies (including second to Roger Clark in a Ford Escort in the &#x27;74 Avon Tour of Britain).

When in 1977 DTV and Vauxhall decided to go rallying everyone thought Marshall would be okay and there were rumours flying around of offers and deals involving Ford and Leyland products. The truth for &#x27;78 was somewhat different and he managed to scrape a deal together to race Colin Vandervell&#x27;s &#x27;77 spec Ford Capri for the national Tricentrol championship and a Triumph Dolomite Sprint for the two production car championships, the Derwent TV/Shellsport and the Britax championships, with both cars being sponsored by Triplex, who were Colin&#x27;s sponsor but due to work commitments he wouldn&#x27;t be competing in &#x27;78. Marshall asked if Triplex would be prepared to throw in a few extra bob for the Dolomite. The Dolomite was prepared by Roger Dowson and Alistair Barrie under the Downie racing banner and the Capri was prepared by John Westwood.
The Dolomite turned out to be the far more successful of the two cars with 21class wins and three second places from 25 starts, with Marshall winning both the Derwent TV/Shellsport and the Britax championships in the Dolomite. The Capri driving was not the success that Marshall had hope, with the Tricentrol Championship costing more than anticipated and the only result of note was the start of the season, in the wet at the International Trophy at Silverstone, when he finished first in class and second overall. There were other flashes of brilliance but bad luck always seemed to prevail, like when leading at Donington when the gearlever broke off.

The start of the 1979 season looked promising, with Marshall forming GMR (Gerry Marshall Racing) in partnership with Roger Dowson to run two Triumph Dolomites in the Group 1 RAC Tricentrol Championship (with Rex Greenslade in the second car) and one car in both the Production Saloon car championships (which had both been one the season before). Both cars had continued sponsorship from Triplex and new deals with Esso, Motor and significant backing from BL Motorsport. Also, the engines were being prepared by Don Moore, who also built the engine for Marshall&#x27;s Lister Jaguar for the Lloyds &amp; Scottish series.

1979 was also the first season Marshall really started preparing cars for other people with GMR.
Things started well and even though being in a lower class he managed to battle for outright wins. There was also the accolade of John Webb and the BARC organising the Gerry Marshall Benefit Races at Brands Hatch and sharing the Dolomite with Roger Clark at the TT event at Silverstone and all seemed to be going well with Marshall really being at the height of his career when disaster struck at the Grand Prix support race in July 1979 which was supposed to be the highlight of the year, with good rides in the Dolomite and Lister Jaguar.

&quot;As the Capris stormed off on their second lap, one of the nastiest accidents in recent saloon racing befell Gerry Marshall. Almost flat out down the straight from Stowe to Club, Marshall was fractionally ahead of Walkinshaw&#x27;s Mazda and keen to stop him moving up to challenge class leader Greenslade. A few feet before the 100yds marker board, the two cars touched and Marshall was launched into a series of rolls, the severely damaged Sprint landing in the catch fencing at Club&quot; Autosport, 19 July 1979.

Marshall would have been travelling over 100 mph and was extremely lucky to survive. During the accident, the sheer force made his helmet come off (still intact and fastened) and the mountings of his seat had broken, which meant he was thrown around the inside of the car, unprotected. He was knocked unconscious, had severe lacerations to his face and head (needing over 100 stitches), had three fractures to his skull, cracked ribs, damaged jaw, teeth, kidneys and damage to his back and spine (these plagued him through the rest of his life). As bad as this was, the doctors told him if his helmet had not come off he would probably have broken his neck.

He was out of hospital in ten days and back behind the wheel of a Dolomite and his Lister in the August Bank Holiday races at Brands Hatch and before the season was out he was back to winning ways, looking forward to the eighties and the possibility of more to come with his relationship with British Leyland.

For the 1980s Marshall decided to retire from full-time Group One racing as he wasn&#x27;t happy with the current regulations and there was a disagreement with British Leyland. He therefore decided to concentrate on his racing team and Productions Saloons and also re-kindled his love affair for Historic racing.

He won various Production Saloon Championships (Wilcomatic, Monroe Shock Absorbers, etc.) and drove an even more diverse range of cars than ever before (also winning the Lloyds and Scottish Championship.

More racing (and winning) followed in the 1990s, notably in the TVR Tuscans (narrowly missing the title in 1991 due to political moves) and also the famous Marsh Plant Aston Martins. Gerry also found time to squeeze himself into the Multisport Van Dieman and Caterham Vauxhall for various one-off drives and a return to Production Saloons in Sierra and Sierra Sapphire Cosworths.

There were more historic outings in Jaguar E-Types, Austin-Healey 3000, Austin-Healey 100S, Chevrolet Corvettes, Ford Anglia, Lotus Cortinas, Ford Mustangs and who will forget his drive in the rain at the 1999 Goodwood Revival St Marys Trophy race, narrowly beating another saloon car legend John Rhodes. This drive also netted Marshall the coveted driver of the day award.

In 2000, on 6 August he scored his 600th win at Snetterton in the Marsh Plant Aston Martin DB4 and also made a return to racing a Vauxhall Firenza, driving one of the original 1974 Thruxton racecar Droop Snoots. There was also a reunion with Baby Bertha at the 2001 Goodwood Festival of Speed (as well as 2002/3 and several other demonstration runs).

Marshall continued to race with forays into Europe, as well as various British event. There were also outings at the Goodwood Revival in Mk1 Jaguars, Chevrolet Corvettes and Austin-Healey 100s, plus an Alvis Grey Lady and Ferrari 330LM that he shared with Ivan Dutton and Peter Hardman at the 2004 Revival, with his last race at Silverstone in November 2004.

<text>Lil Green (probably born Lillie May Johnson; December 22, 1901 (some sources give 1905, 1910 or 1919) – April 14, 1954) was an American classic female blues singer and songwriter. She was among the leading female rhythm and blues singers of the 1940s, with a sensual soprano voice. Gospel singer R.H. Harris lauded her voice, and her interpretation of religious songs.
==Life and career==
Originally named Lillian Green or Lillie May Johnson, she was born in Mississippi. After the early deaths of her parents, she began performing in her teens and, having honed her craft in the church performing gospel, she sang in Mississippi jukes, before heading to Chicago, Illinois, in 1929, where she would make all of her recordings.

Green was noted for superb timing and a distinctively sinuous voice. In the 1930s, she and Big Bill Broonzy had a nightclub act together. In 1940, she recorded her first session for the Bluebird budget subsidiary label of RCA Victor. Her two biggest hits were her own composition &quot;Romance in the Dark&quot; (1940), which was later covered by many artists, such as Dinah Washington and Nina Simone (in 1967) (Billie Holiday recorded a different song with the same title), and Green&#x27;s 1941 version of Kansas Joe McCoy&#x27;s minor-key blues- and jazz-influenced song &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Do Right?&quot;, which was recorded by Peggy Lee in 1942 and by many others since. As well as performing in Chicago nightclubs, Green toured with Tiny Bradshaw and other bands but never broke away from the black theatre circuit.

By 1949, Green had changed direction with the foresight to become a jazz vocalist, and tried to emulate the jazz style of Billie Holiday. She signed with Atlantic Records in 1951, but at this point was already in poor health. She died of pneumonia in Chicago in April 1954 and was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery, in Gary, Indiana.

<text>In mathematics, a locally constant function is a function from a topological space into a set with the property that around every point of its domain, there exists some neighborhood of that point on which it restricts to a constant function.

== Definition ==

Let formula_1 be a function from a topological space formula_2 into a set formula_3 
If formula_4 then formula_5 is said to be locally constant at formula_6 if there exists a neighborhood formula_7 of formula_6 such that formula_5 is constant on formula_10 which by definition means that formula_11 for all formula_12 
The function formula_1 is called locally constant if it is locally constant at every point formula_4 in its domain.

== Examples ==

Every constant function is locally constant. The converse will hold if its domain is a connected space.

Every locally constant function from the real numbers formula_15 to formula_15 is constant, by the connectedness of formula_17 But the function formula_18 from the rationals formula_19 to formula_20 defined by formula_21 and formula_22 is locally constant (this uses the fact that formula_23 is irrational and that therefore the two sets formula_24 and formula_25 are both open in formula_19).

If formula_27 is locally constant, then it is constant on any connected component of formula_28 The converse is true for locally connected spaces, which are spaces whose connected components are open subsets.

Further examples include the following:
* Given a covering map formula_29 then to each point formula_4 we can assign the cardinality of the fiber formula_31 over formula_6; this assignment is locally constant.
* A map from a topological space formula_33 to a discrete space formula_34 is continuous if and only if it is locally constant.

== Connection with sheaf theory ==

There are of locally constant functions on formula_35 To be more definite, the locally constant integer-valued functions on formula_2 form a sheaf in the sense that for each open set formula_37 of formula_2 we can form the functions of this kind; and then verify that the sheaf hold for this construction, giving us a sheaf of abelian groups (even commutative rings). This sheaf could be written formula_39; described by means of we have stalk formula_40 a copy of formula_41 at formula_42 for each formula_43 This can be referred to a , meaning exactly taking their values in the (same) group. The typical sheaf of course is not constant in this way; but the construction is useful in linking up sheaf cohomology with homology theory, and in logical applications of sheaves. The idea of local coefficient system is that we can have a theory of sheaves that look like such &#x27;harmless&#x27; sheaves (near any formula_6), but from a global point of view exhibit some &#x27;twisting&#x27;.

<doc id="295633" wikidata="Q237527" url="?curid=295633" title="Big Mama Thornton">
<text>Willie Mae &quot;Big Mama&quot; Thornton (December 11, 1926 – July 25, 1984), was an American singer and songwriter of blues and R&amp;B.

The &quot;Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock and Soul&quot; described Thornton, saying: &quot;Her booming voice, sometimes 200-pound frame, and exuberant stage manner had audiences stomping their feet and shouting encouragement in R&amp;B theaters from coast to coast from the early 1950s on&quot;.

Thornton was the first to record Leiber and Stoller&#x27;s &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, in 1952, which was written for her. It became Thornton&#x27;s biggest hit, selling over 500,000 copies and staying seven weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart in 1953. According to New York University music professor Maureen Mahon, &quot;the song is seen as an important beginning of rock-and-roll, especially in its use of the guitar as the key instrument&quot;.

Thornton&#x27;s other recordings include her song &quot;Ball and Chain&quot;, made famous in the late 1960s by Janis Joplin. Though later recordings of her songs by other artists sold millions of copies, she was denied royalties by not holding the publishing copyrights to her creativity. Thornton died of a heart attack and liver disorders, penniless in a boarding-house in Los Angeles, California, and was buried in a shared pauper&#x27;s grave. In 2024, Thornton was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the musical influence category.

==Life and career==
===Early life and self-taught musicianship===
Thornton was born on December 11, 1926, the sixth of George and Mattie (née Haynes) Thornton&#x27;s seven children. While Thornton&#x27;s birth certificate states that she was born in Ariton, Alabama, in an interview with Arhoolie Records producer Chris Strachwitz, she claimed Montgomery, Alabama, as her birthplace, perhaps because Montgomery was better known than Ariton. She was introduced to music in a Baptist church, where her father was a minister and her mother a singer. Thornton said &quot;I used to go to church a lot, but I didn’t do too much singing in church&quot;. Thornton&#x27;s mother fell gravely ill from tuberculosis. Only 13, Thornton cared for her mother until her death in the Montgomery Tuberculosis Sanatorium in 1939. At the time Thornton was still in the third grade. After losing her mother, she was unable to continue to attend school. Thornton left school and got a job washing and cleaning spittoons in a local tavern.

Thornton&#x27;s talent was self taught. She said &quot;My singing comes from my experience... My own experience. I never had no one teach me nothin&#x27;. I never went to school for music or nothin&#x27;. I taught myself to sing and to blow harmonica and even to play drums by watchin’ other people! I can&#x27;t read music, but I know what I&#x27;m singing! I don&#x27;t sing like nobody but myself&quot;. When Thornton was 8 years old, she taught herself to play the harmonica by watching her older brother, Calliope &quot;Harp&quot; Thornton. Observing the rhythm-and-blues singers Bessie Smith and Memphis Minnie, whom she deeply admired, helped develop her singing talent. &quot;I just started hearing the blues of Bessie Smith, well I was a kid myself, you know. I was a young type of youngster always running around the house humming the blues and my daddy wanted to get me with the razor strop, but I hit the door&quot;. Thornton explained her early love of the blues, saying &quot;My father was a minister. He&#x27;s a Baptist preacher, and my mother she was very religious. And me, I don&#x27;t know what I am, I&#x27;m -- well, [I] was just born with the blues... I really got the blues, you know, in &#x27;39 when I lost my mother, and then I said, &#x27;Well, I don&#x27;t know what to do&#x27;. I said, &#x27;Well, I think I want to sing the blues&#x27;. So I said, well, [at] that time, I was listening to Big Maceo, his &quot;Worried Life Blues&quot; and I said &#x27;I think I want to sing that&#x27;, and I did. That was a beautiful number. Yeah.&quot;

===1940s: career beginnings===
Thornton&#x27;s talent was discovered in 1940 when she was fourteen years old. Diamond Teeth Mary, the half-sister of one of her early idols Bessie Smith, encouraged her to enter a talent contest after having heard Thornton singing while working a side-job on a garbage truck. Thornton described the audition during a 1970 Studs Terkel radio interview, saying &quot;Show came through in the first of the &#x27;40s and called it &#x27;Sammy Green&#x27;s Hot Harlem Revue&#x27; as I mentioned earlier. They didn&#x27;t have a singer, and so I asked him, I said, &#x27;Give me an audition, let me sing&#x27;. I said, &#x27;I&#x27;ve been singing all the little talent shows around here&#x27;. He said, &#x27;Oh, little &#x27;ole girl, you can&#x27;t sing&#x27;. I said, &#x27;Will you give me a try?&#x27; He said, &#x27;Yeah, well, when the show start, say we gonna give a little audition for singers, &#x27;cause I&#x27;m looking for a singer&#x27;. And so he give auditions. So I was there, he wrote my name down, and several people they sung, and then he said, &#x27;Well, I, I want to see what you can do&#x27;. So I got up there, I had an old pair of jeans, one leg rolled up, I got up and I started singing one of Louis Jordan&#x27;s song called &quot;G.I. Jive&quot;, and I sung that song, and I sang this blues by Big Maceo, &quot;Worried Life Blues&quot; and he hired me. Out of 25 people, I was the 26th but then he hired me&quot;.

14-year-old Thornton left home, traveling with the show between different cities in Alabama and Georgia. Thornton described the revue as &quot;a stage show, like, playing in theaters... dancers, chorus girls, comedians, singers&quot;. Originally hired as a dancer, singer and comedienne, Thornton quickly became known as the &quot;New Bessie Smith&quot; for her vocal talent. Thornton left Green&#x27;s show in 1948 over a money dispute, saying &quot;I traveled with them for quite a few years, and I went to Houston, Texas in ’48. We played there and then we left. As a matter of fact, I quit the show in ’48... They owed me a little, quite a bit of money and they wouldn’t pay it, and I just got tired&quot;.

===1950s: recording career and &quot;Hound Dog&quot;===
Thornton moved to Houston and started singing at the Eldorado Ballroom for fifty dollars a night. In 1950, Thornton recorded her first record, &quot;All Right Baby&quot; and &quot;Bad Luck Got My Man&quot;, released on Houston&#x27;s E&amp;W Recording Studio record label and credited to the &quot;Harlem All Stars&quot;. Thornton was credited as songwriter on both songs. Thornton moved to the Bronze Peacock Dinner Club which was owned by impresario and record producer Don Robey. In 1950 she signed a five-year recording contract with Robey&#x27;s Peacock Records. Her first Peacock record &quot;No Jody For Me / Let Your Tears Fall Baby&quot; was a local hit in the Houston area, but did not catch on nationally. Thornton needed additional income to live, so she started shining shoes to get by. In 1952, Don Robey struck a deal with impresario Johnny Otis, allowing Peacock Records artists who had not broken through to national success to travel with Otis&#x27; California Rhythm and Blues Caravan to gain experience and exposure. The deal included recording the artists in Los Angeles and giving the recordings to Robey for distribution. Thornton was one of the artists Otis selected.

During the revue&#x27;s appearance at Harlem&#x27;s Apollo Theatre in December 1952, Thornton did not have a hit single of her own to sing. She sang a version of the Billy Ward and his Dominoes hit &quot;Have Mercy Baby&quot;. The audience went wild for Thornton and would not stop until the stage manager brought the curtain down in order to move the show on. Thornton said &quot;...that&#x27;s where they made their mistake. They put me on first. I wasn&#x27;t out there to put no one off stage. I was out there to get known and I did!... They had to put the curtain down. That&#x27;s when they put my name in lights. Mr. Frank Shiffman, the manager came back stage hollerin&#x27; to Johnny Otis... &#x27;You said you had a star and you got a star. You got to put her on to close the show!&quot; The next night, the Apollo marquee read &quot;Big Mama Thornton&quot;.

While working with Otis, Thornton recorded &quot;Hound Dog&quot; in 1952, the first record produced by its writers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. The pair were present at the recording, with Leiber demonstrating the song in the vocal style they had envisioned; Stoller said &quot;We wanted her to growl it.&quot; Thornton said &quot;Don&#x27;t tell me how to sing no song&quot;, but relented. Otis played drums, after the original drummer was unable to play an adequate part. Thornton&#x27;s song is credited as helping to usher in the dawn of rock and roll. Thornton realized her record was being broadcast while traveling to a Dayton, Ohio performance. &quot;I was going to the theater and I just turned the radio on in the car and the man said, &#x27;Here&#x27;s a record that&#x27;s going nationwide: &quot;Hound Dog&quot; by Willie Mae Thornton&#x27;. I said, That&#x27;s me! I hadn&#x27;t heard the record in so long. So when we get to the theater they was blasting it. You could hear it from the theater, from the loudspeaker. They were just playing &quot;Hound Dog&quot; all over the theater. So I goes up in the operating room, I say, &#x27;Do you mind playing that again?&#x27;... &#x27;Cause I hadn&#x27;t heard the record in so long I forgot the words myself. So I stood there while he was playing it, listening to it. So that evening I sang it on the show, and everybody went for it&quot;.

&quot;Hound Dog&quot; was Thornton&#x27;s only hit record, selling over 500,000 copies, spending 14 weeks in the R&amp;B charts, including seven weeks at number one. Although the record made Thornton a star, she reportedly saw little of the profits. Thornton never received full credit for recording the original version of the song. She claimed she received just one royalty check for $500 from her version that spent seven weeks as number one on the 1953 &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; quoted her as having said, &quot;Didn’t get no money from them at all. Everybody livin’ in a house but me. I&#x27;m just livin&quot;. Thornton&#x27;s success with &quot;Hound Dog&quot; was overshadowed three years later when Elvis Presley recorded a hit version of the song. Presley, who did have knowledge of Thornton&#x27;s recording of the song, later heard a sanitized version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; performed by Freddie Bell and the Bellboys, while attending their show at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. Bell had removed Thornton&#x27;s growling declaration of leaving a cheating partner. Bell changed the song, the new lyrics were sung to a literal dog. Presley&#x27;s version sold ten million copies, so today few people know that &quot;Hound Dog&quot; began as Thornton&#x27;s &quot;anthem of black Women&#x27;s power&quot;. Contrary to popular belief, Presley did not steal Thornton&#x27;s version of &quot;Hound Dog,&quot; with the song&#x27;s co-writer Mike Stoller, who later co-wrote Presley songs such as &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; and &quot;King Creole&quot;, noting in 2022 that Presley had used the modified Freddie Bell and the Bellboys version.

Thornton continued with Johnny Otis&#x27;s band between 1951 and 1954. The 30 recordings she made for the Peacock label during that time are considered &quot;remarkable for the vocal presence and total cohesiveness&quot;. Thornton performed in R&amp;B package tours with Junior Parker and Esther Phillips and continued to record for Peacock until 1957. Thornton did not have another hit record.

===Johnny Ace&#x27;s death===
While performing Christmas Day 1954 at the City Auditorium in Houston, Texas, Thornton tried to intervene as fellow Duke and Peacock record performer Johnny Ace was playing with a new .22 cal. revolver in the backstage dressing room during that evening&#x27;s show. In an official deposition taken at 12:40 am the next morning, Thornton said &quot;I looked over at Johnny and noticed he had a pistol in his hand. It was a pistol that he bought somewhere in Florida. It was a .22 cal. revolver. Johnny was pointing this pistol at Mary Carter and Joe Hamilton. He was kind of waving it around. I asked Johnny to let me see the gun. He gave it to me and when I turned the chamber a .22 cal. bullet fell out in my hand. Johnny told me to put it back in where it wouldn’t fall out. I put it back and gave it to him. I told him not to snap it at nobody&quot;. Ace did not heed Thornton&#x27;s advice. &quot;After he got the pistol back, Johnny pointed the pistol at Mary Carter and pulled the trigger. It snapped... I told Johnny again not to snap the pistol at anybody. Johnny then put the pistol to Olivia’s head and pulled the trigger. It snapped. Johnny said &#x27;I’ll show you that it won&#x27;t shoot&#x27;. He held the pistol up and looked at it first and then put it to his head. I started toward the door and I heard the pistol go off. I turned around and saw Johnny falling to the floor. I saw that he was shot and I run on stage and told the people in the band about it. I stayed there until the officers arrived&quot;.

===1960s: &quot;Ball and Chain&quot; and continued success===
As her career began to fade in the late 1950s and early 1960s, she left Houston and relocated to the San Francisco Bay area, playing clubs in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Her performances were infrequent so she could not retain a steady group of musicians to back her. Chris Strachwitz said when Thornton was booked to perform in a good venue like the Fillmore, her manager at the time, Jim Moore, would hire &quot;lounge musicians. He called them &#x27;jazz musicians&#x27; or whatever... they had no clue what the blues was all about. They were mediocre at the best&quot;. While living in the Bay Area, Thorton recorded for a succession of labels, including Bay-Tone, Irma, Kent, Sotoplay and the Berkeley-based Arhoolie Records.

In 1961 Thornton wrote another signature song, &quot;Ball And Chain&quot;. The song relates the feelings of a woman who has been mistreated by her partner. Thornton assigned the song&#x27;s copyright to Bay-Tone Records, a small, independent San Francisco record company in 1961. Bay-Tone released three of Thornton&#x27;s singles, including &quot;You Did Me Wrong / Big Mama&#x27;s Blues&quot;. However the label chose not to release her &quot;Ball And Chain&quot; recording and instead held on to the copyright. This caused Thornton to once again miss out on the publishing royalties when her song was recorded by another artist and became a hit. During her later efforts to secure the royalties from the song, Thornton described how she had written the song 9 years before she recorded it, saying &quot;I was singing that way before I recorded it&quot;.

After hearing Thornton perform the song at the Both/And Club on Divisadero Street in San Francisco, Big Brother and the Holding Company&#x27;s vocalist Janis Joplin and guitarist James Gurley approached her and asked permission to cover &quot;Ball And Chain&quot;. Thornton agreed. Gurley slowed the blues song, using a minor key. The band performed their version of &quot;Ball And Chain&quot; at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. The crowd was stunned. Band guitarist Sam Andrew joked &quot;This was no ‘wear flowers in your hair’ song&quot;. Subsequently, the band released their version of the song on their album &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot; in August 1968. The album remained at the top spot of the Billboard Hot 200 charts for two months. Joplin&#x27;s interpretation of the song renewed interest in Thornton, boosting her career. In a 1972 interview, Thornton acknowledged receiving royalty payments after having given Joplin permission to record her song, saying &quot;I gave her the right and the permission to make &#x27;Ball &#x27;n&#x27; Chain&#x27; . . . It&#x27;s all right, it made me money. At least I got paid for it, and I&#x27;m still drawing royalties&quot;. With the success of Big Brother&#x27;s &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot; album, Arhoolie Records released Thornton&#x27;s recording of &quot;Ball And Chain&quot; as a way to capitalize on the success of Joplin&#x27;s cover.

In 1965, Thornton toured Europe with the American Folk Blues Festival where she was &quot;celebrated by adoring fans&quot;. Reviews of the tour said &quot;Thornton dazzles European audiences who are experiencing her live for the first time&quot;. Her success was notable &quot;because very few female blues singers at that time had ever enjoyed success across the Atlantic&quot;. While in London on October 20, she recorded her first album for Arhoolie, &quot;Big Mama Thornton – In Europe&quot;. It featured backing by blues veterans Buddy Guy (guitar), Fred Below (drums), Eddie Boyd (keyboards), Jimmy Lee Robinson (bass), and Walter &quot;Shakey&quot; Horton (harmonica), except for two songs (and a third as a bonus track on the 2005 CD reissue) on which Fred McDowell provided acoustic slide guitar. Music producer Chris Strachwitz said &quot;Willie Mae ‘Big Mama’ Thornton is in my opinion the greatest female blues singer of this and any other decade&quot; in the album&#x27;s liner notes. In 1966, Thornton recorded her second album for Arhoolie, &quot;Big Mama Thornton with the Muddy Waters Blues Band – 1966&quot;, with Muddy Waters (guitar), Sammy Lawhorn (guitar), James Cotton (harmonica), Otis Spann (piano), Luther Johnson (bass guitar), and Francis Clay (drums). Thornton performed at the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1966 and 1968. Her last album for Arhoolie, &quot;Ball n&#x27; Chain&quot;, was released in 1968. It was made up of tracks from her two previous albums, plus her composition &quot;Ball And Chain&quot; and the standard &quot;Wade in the Water&quot;. A small combo, including her frequent guitarist Edward &quot;Bee&quot; Houston, provided backup for the two songs.

By 1969, Thornton had signed with Mercury Records, which released her most successful album, &quot;Stronger Than Dirt&quot;, which reached number 198 in the Billboard Top 200 record chart. Next, Thornton signed a contract with Pentagram Records and finally fulfilled one of her biggest dreams. A blues woman and the daughter of a preacher, Thornton loved the blues and what she called the &quot;good singing&quot; of gospel artists like the Dixie Hummingbirds and Mahalia Jackson. She had always wanted to record a gospel record, and did so with the album &quot;Saved&quot; (PE 10005). The album includes the gospel classics &quot;Oh, Happy Day&quot;, &quot;Down By The Riverside&quot;, &quot;Glory, Glory Hallelujah&quot;, &quot;He&#x27;s Got the Whole World in His Hands&quot;, &quot;Lord Save Me&quot;, &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot;, &quot;One More River&quot;, and &quot;Go Down Moses&quot;. By then, the American blues revival had come to an end. While the original blues acts like Thornton mostly played smaller venues, younger people played their versions of blues in massive arenas for big money. Since the blues had seeped into other genres of music, the blues musician no longer needed impoverishment or geography for substantiation; the style was enough.

===1970s and 1980s: later career===
While at home the offers became fewer and smaller, things changed for good in 1972, when Thornton was asked to rejoin the American Folk Blues Festival tour. She thought of Europe as a good place for herself, and, with the lack of engagements in the United States, she agreed happily. The tour, beginning on March 2, took Thornton to Germany, France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Sweden, where it ended on March 27 in Stockholm. With her on the bill were Eddie Boyd, Big Joe Williams, Robert Pete Williams, T- Bone Walker, Paul Lenart, Hartley Severns, Edward Taylor and Vinton Johnson. As in 1965, they garnered recognition and respect from other musicians who wanted to see them. 

In the 1970s, the damage from years of heavy drinking began to visibly affect Thornton&#x27;s health. She was in a serious auto accident but recovered to perform at the 1973 Newport Jazz Festival with Muddy Waters, B. B. King, and Eddie &quot;Cleanhead&quot; Vinson. &quot;The Blues — A Real Summit Meeting&quot;, a recording of this performance was released by Buddha Records. Thornton&#x27;s last albums were &quot;Jail&quot; and &quot;Sassy Mama&quot; for Vanguard Records in 1975. &quot;Jail&quot; captured her performances during mid-1970s concerts at two prisons in the northwestern United States. Other songs from this recording session were released in 2000 on &quot;Big Mama Swings&quot; (the third disc in &quot;The Complete Vanguard Recordings&quot; set). She was backed by a blues ensemble that featured sustained jams by George &quot;Harmonica&quot; Smith and included the guitarists Doug MacLeod, Bee Houston and Steve Wachsman, the drummer Todd Nelson, saxophonist Bill Potter, bassist Bruce Sieverson, and pianist J. D. Nicholson. She toured extensively through the United States and Canada, played at the Juneteenth Blues Fest in Houston, sharing the bill with John Lee Hooker.

She performed at the San Francisco Blues Festival in 1979 and the Newport Jazz Festival in 1980. Thornton also performed in the &quot;Blues Is a Woman&quot; concert that year, alongside Sippie Wallace, sporting a man&#x27;s three-piece suit, straw hat, and gold watch. She sat at center stage and played pieces she wanted to play, which were not on the program. Thornton took part in the Tribal Stomp at Monterey Fairgrounds, the Third Annual Sacramento Blues Festival, and the Los Angeles Bicentennial Blues with B. B. King and Muddy Waters. She was a guest on an ABC-TV special hosted by actor Hal Holbrook and was joined by Aretha Franklin and toured through the club scene. She was also part of the award-winning PBS television special &quot;Three Generations&quot; of the blues with Sippie Wallace and Jeannie Cheatham.

===Death and burial===
Thornton was found dead at age 57 by medical personnel in a Los Angeles boarding house on July 25, 1984. She died of heart and liver disorders due to her longstanding alcohol abuse. She had lost in a short time as a result of illness, her weight dropping from . Thornton was buried in Inglewood Park Cemetery in Los Angeles County, California. Her pauper&#x27;s grave features a small granite marker with two additional names, indicating her body was buried along with two strangers.

Summing up her life, Thornton said &quot;I’ve been happy. There have been dull moments, but you have to take as worse as you going to get it or else you are never going to see it. And I’ve been happy and I’d like to stay that way&quot;.

==Style==
Thornton&#x27;s performances were characterized by her deep, powerful voice and strong sense of self. She was given her nickname, &quot;Big Mama,&quot; by Frank Schiffman, the manager of Harlem&#x27;s Apollo Theater, because of her strong voice, size, and personality. Thornton stated that she was louder than any microphone and did not want a microphone to ever be as loud as she was. Alice Echols, the author of a biography of Janis Joplin, said that Thornton could sing in a &quot;pretty voice&quot; but did not want to.

Her style was heavily influenced by gospel music that she listened to growing up in the home of a preacher, though her genre could be described as blues. Thornton was quoted in a 1980 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;when I was comin&#x27; up, listening to Bessie Smith and all, they sung from their heart and soul and expressed themselves. That&#x27;s why when I do a song by Jimmy Reed or somebody, I have my own way of singing it. Because I don&#x27;t want to be Jimmy Reed, I want to be me. I like to put myself into whatever I&#x27;m doin&#x27; so I can feel it&quot;.

Scholars such as Maureen Mahon have praised Thornton for subverting traditional roles of Black or African-American women. She added a black woman&#x27;s voice to a field that was dominated by white males, and her strong personality transgressed stereotypes of what a Black or African-American woman should be. This transgression was an integral part of her performance and stage persona.

Scholar Tyina Steptoe has written that Thornton&#x27;s gender nonconformity helped to establish rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll as a rebellious form of music. She says that Thornton should be understood as queer. Music historian Evelyn McDonnell remarked &quot;If you go back and look at Bessie Smith, Big Mama Thornton — they were not publicly identifying themselves as queer, necessarily, but clearly signaling in their lyrics and dressing in suits&quot;.

==Legacy==
During her career, Thornton was nominated for Blues Music Awards six times.

In addition to &quot;Ball &#x27;n&#x27; Chain&quot; and &quot;They Call Me Big Mama,&quot; Thornton wrote 20 blues songs. Her &quot;Ball &#x27;n&#x27; Chain&quot; is included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame list of the &quot;500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;. It was not until Janis Joplin covered Thornton&#x27;s &quot;Ball &#x27;n&#x27; Chain&quot; that it became a hit. Though Thornton did not receive financial compensation for her song, Joplin arranged for Thornton to open shows for her. Joplin found her singing voice through Thornton, who praised Joplin&#x27;s version of &quot;Ball &#x27;n&#x27; Chain&quot;, saying, &quot;That girl feels like I do&quot;.

Thornton subsequently received greater recognition for her popular songs, but she is still under appreciated for her influence on the blues, rock and roll and soul music. Thornton&#x27;s music was also influential in shaping American popular music. The lack of appreciation she received for &quot;Hound Dog&quot; and &quot;Ball &#x27;n&#x27; Chain&quot; as they became popular hits is representative of the lack of recognition she received during her career as a whole. Many critics argue that Thornton&#x27;s lack of recognition in the music industry is a reflection of an era of racial segregation in the United States, both physically and in the music industry. Scholars suggest that Thornton&#x27;s lack of access to broader audiences (both white and black), may have been a barrier to her commercial success as both a vocalist and a composer.

In 2004, the nonprofit Willie Mae Rock Camp for Girls, named for Thornton, was founded to offer a musical education to girls from ages eight to 18. The first biography of Thornton, &quot;Big Mama Thornton: The Life and Music&quot;, by Michael Spörke, was published in 2014.

In 2022, Thornton was featured as a character in &quot;Elvis&quot;, a biopic about Elvis Presley. In the movie, Thornton (played by Shonka Dukureh in her only film role, as she died shortly after the film&#x27;s release) is shown as the original singer of the song &quot;Hound Dog&quot; and appears in the movie singing the song. Presley (played by Austin Butler) hears Thornton sing &quot;Hound Dog&quot; at a concert and decides to record a cover of the song. Dukureh&#x27;s performance of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; was included in full on the movie soundtrack. The movie and soundtrack were both critical and commercial hits, giving greater public attention to Thornton.

In 2024, Thornton was selected for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the musical influence category.

<text>Orokolo is a Trans–New Guinea language of the Eleman branch spoken in Ihu Rural LLG, Gulf Province, Papua New Guinea by about 50,000 people (2010). Alternate names are Bailala, Haira, Kaipi, Kairu-Kaura, Muro, Muru, Vailala, and West Elema. It is spoken in various villages, including Vailala (). It is notable for having a very small consonant inventory.

== Literature ==
This first New Testament (&quot;Pupu Oharo Āre&quot;) was translated by the Rev. S. H. Dewdney, a Congregational missionary with the London Missionary Society, and Lavako Maika, an evangelist. It was published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1963. Genesis, called &quot;Genese&quot;, was published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in Australia in 1970. Ruth, called &quot;Rute&quot;, was published by the Bible Society in Australia, in 1972.

== Phonology ==
Orokolo has six consonant phonemes.

/m l/ are nasal [m n] word-initially and oral [β l] intervocalically. The alveolar plosive /t/ is about 10 times rarer than it is in the related language Toaripi. Most instances of historical /t/ shifted to /k/ in Orokolo, as shown by the cognates below. The exception to this is when */t/ followed /i/ and preceded /a/, in which case it was retained in Orokolo and the Sepoe dialect of Toaripi, but shifted to /s/ in Toaripi proper.

However, since original /k/ still appears in this position (e.g. /heaikapo/ &quot;long&quot;), /t/ and /k/ are distinct phonemes and not allophones. The other major sound change which characterises Orokolo is the shift of */f/ and */s/ to /h/, reducing the fricative inventory to one member; compare for instance Orokolo /hapa/ &quot;open&quot; and /ahe/ &quot;sugarcane&quot; with Toaripi /fapai/, /ase/.

Orokolo also has six vowels, giving it an unusually low consonant-vowel ratio of 1.

/o/ and /ɔ/ are not distinguished orthographically, both being written o.

<doc id="295640" wikidata="Q34018" url="?curid=295640" title="Trans–New Guinea languages">
<text>Trans–New Guinea (TNG) is an extensive family of Papuan languages spoken on the island of New Guinea and neighboring islands, a region corresponding to the country Papua New Guinea as well as parts of Indonesia.

Trans–New Guinea is perhaps the third-largest language family in the world by number of languages. The core of the family is considered to be established, but its boundaries and overall membership are uncertain. The languages are spoken by around 3 million people. There have been several main proposals as to its internal classification.

==History of the proposal==
Although Papuan languages for the most part are poorly documented, several of the branches of Trans–New Guinea have been recognized for some time. The Eleman languages were first proposed by S. Ray in 1907, parts of Marind were recognized by Ray and JHP Murray in 1918, and the Rai Coast languages in 1919, again by Ray.

The precursor of the Trans–New Guinea family was Stephen Wurm&#x27;s 1960 proposal of an East New Guinea Highlands family. Although broken up by Malcolm Ross in 2005, it united different branches of what became TNG for the first time, linking Engan, Chimbu–Wahgi, Goroka, and Kainantu. (Duna and Kalam were added in 1971.) Then in 1970, Clemens Voorhoeve and Kenneth McElhanon noted 91 lexical resemblances between the Central and South New Guinea (CSNG) and Finisterre–Huon families, which they had respectively established a few years earlier. Although they did not work out regular sound correspondences, and so could not distinguish between cognates due to genealogical relationship, cognates due to borrowing, and chance resemblances, their research was taken seriously. They chose the name &quot;Trans–New Guinea&quot; because this new family was the first to span New Guinea, from the Bomberai Peninsula of western West Irian to the Huon Peninsula of eastern PNG. They also noted possible cognates in other families Wurm would later add to TNG: Wurm&#x27;s East New Guinea Highlands, Binandere in the &#x27;Bird&#x27;s Tail&#x27; of PNG, and two families that John Z&#x27;graggen would later (1971, 1975) unite in his 100-language Madang–Adelbert Range family.

In 1975, Wurm accepted Voorhoeve and McElhanon&#x27;s suspicions about further connections, as well as Z&#x27;graggen&#x27;s work, and postulated additional links to, among others, the languages of the island of Timor to the west of New Guinea, Angan, Goilalan, Koiarian, Dagan, Eleman, Wissel Lakes, the erstwhile Dani-Kwerba family, and the erstwhile Trans-Fly–Bulaka River family (which he had established in 1970), expanding TNG into an enormous language phylum that covered most of the island of New Guinea, as well as Timor and neighboring islands, and included over 500 languages spoken by some 2,300,000 people. However, part of the evidence for this was typological, and Wurm stated that he did not expect it to stand up well to scrutiny. Although he based the phylum on characteristic personal pronouns, several of the branches had no pronouns in common with the rest of the family, or even had pronouns related to non-TNG families, but were included because they were grammatically similar to TNG. Other families that had typical TNG pronouns were excluded because they did not resemble other TNG families in their grammatical structure.

Because grammatical typology is readily borrowed—many of the Austronesian languages in New Guinea have grammatical structures similar to their Papuan neighbors, for example, and conversely many Papuan languages resemble typical Austronesian languages typologically—other linguists were skeptical. William A. Foley rejected Wurm&#x27;s and even some of Voorhoeve&#x27;s results, and he broke much of TNG into its constituent parts: several dozen small but clearly valid families, plus a number of apparent isolates.

In 2005, Malcolm Ross published a draft proposal re-evaluating Trans–New Guinea, and found what he believed to be overwhelming evidence for a reduced version of the phylum, based solely on lexical resemblances, which retained as much as 85% of Wurm&#x27;s hypothesis, though some of it tentatively.

The strongest lexical evidence for any language family is shared morphological paradigms, especially highly irregular or suppletive paradigms with bound morphology, because these are extremely resistant to borrowing. For example, the fact that German words &quot;gut&quot; &quot;good&quot; and &quot;besser&quot; &quot;better&quot; resemble their English counterparts would be stronger evidence that German is related to English than the mere lexical correspondence between German &quot;rot&quot; and English &quot;red&quot; for the color. However, because of the great morphological complexity of many Papuan languages, and the poor state of documentation of nearly all, in New Guinea this approach is essentially restricted to comparing pronouns. Ross reconstructed pronouns sets for Foley&#x27;s basic families and compared these reconstructions, rather than using a direct mass comparison of all Papuan languages; attempted to then reconstruct the ancestral pronouns of the proto-Trans–New Guinea language, such as &quot;*ni&quot; &quot;we&quot;, &quot;*ŋgi&quot; &quot;you&quot;, &quot;*i&quot; &quot;they&quot;; and then compared poorly supported branches directly to this reconstruction. Families required two apparent cognates to be included. However, if any language in a family was a match, the family was considered a match, greatly increasing the likelihood of coincidental resemblances, and because the plural forms are related to the singular forms, a match of 1sg and 1pl, although satisfying Ross&#x27;s requirement of two matches, is not actually two independent matches, again increasing the likelihood of spurious matches. In addition, Ross counted forms like *a as a match to 2sg *ga, so that all counted as matches to *ga. And although and occur in Papuan pronouns at twice the level expected by their occurrence in pronouns elsewhere in the world, they do not correlate with each other as they would if they reflected a language family. That is, it is argued that Ross&#x27;s pronouns do not support the validity of Trans–New Guinea, and do not reveal which families might belong to it.

Ross also included in his proposal several better-attested families for non-pronominal evidence, despite a lack of pronouns common to other branches of TNG, and he suggested that there may be other families that would have been included if they had been better attested. Several additional families are only tentatively linked to TNG. Because the boundaries of Ross&#x27;s proposal are based primarily on a single parameter, the pronouns, all internal structure remains tentative.

==The languages==

Most TNG languages are spoken by only a few thousand people, with only seven (Melpa, Kuman, Enga, Huli, Western Dani, Makasae, and Ekari) being spoken by more than 100,000. The most populous language outside of mainland New Guinea is Makasae of East Timor, with 100,000 speakers throughout the eastern part of the country. Enga is the most populous Trans-New Guinea language spoken in New Guinea, with more than 200,000 speakers. Golin, Sinasina, Mid Grand Valley Dani, Kamano, and Bunaq have between 50,000 and 100,000 speakers (Galela of Halmahera, usually not classified as Trans-New Guinea, also has between 50,000 and 100,000 speakers.) All other Trans–New Guinea languages have fewer than 50,000 speakers.

The greatest linguistic diversity in Ross&#x27;s Trans–New Guinea proposal, and therefore perhaps the location of the proto-Trans–New Guinea homeland, is in the interior highlands of Papua New Guinea, in the central-to-eastern New Guinea cordillera where Wurm first posited his East New Guinea Highlands family. Indonesian Papua and the Papuan Peninsula of Papua New Guinea (the &quot;bird&#x27;s tail&quot;) have fewer and more widely extended branches of TNG, and were therefore likely settled by TNG speakers after the proto-language broke up.

Ross speculates that the TNG family may have spread with the high population densities that resulted from the domestication of taro, settling quickly in the highland valleys along the length of the cordillera but spreading much more slowly into the malarial lowlands, and not at all into areas such as the Sepik River valley where the people already had yam agriculture, which thus supported high population densities. Ross suggests that TNG may have arrived at its western limit, the islands near Timor, perhaps four to 4.5 thousand years ago, before the expansion of Austronesian into this area. 
Roger Blench associates the spread of Trans–New Guinea languages with the domestication of the banana.

==Classification==
===Wurm, Voorhoeve &amp; McElhanon (1975)===
Wurm et al. identify the subdivisions in their Papuan classification as &quot;families&quot; (on the order of relatedness of the Germanic languages), &quot;stocks&quot; (on the order of the Indo-European languages), and &quot;phyla&quot; (on the order of the Nostratic hypothesis). Trans-New Guinea is a phylum in this terminology. A language that is not related to any other at a &quot;family&quot; level or below is called an isolate in this scheme.

===Foley (2003)===
As of 2003, William A. Foley accepted the core of TNG: &quot;The fact, for example, that a great swath of languages in New Guinea from the Huon Peninsula to the highlands of Irian Jaya mark the object of a transitive verb with a set of verbal prefixes, a first person singular in /n/ and second person singular in a velar stop, is overwhelming evidence that these languages are all genetically related; the likelihood of such a system being borrowed vanishingly small.&quot; He considered the relationship between the Finisterre–Huon, Eastern Highlands (Kainantu–Gorokan), and Irian Highlands (Dani – Paniai Lakes) families (and presumably some other smaller ones) to be established, and he said that it is &quot;highly likely&quot; that the Madang family belongs as well. He considered it possible, but not yet demonstrated, that the Enga, Chimbu, Binandere, Angan, Ok, Awyu, Asmat (perhaps closest to Ok and Awyu), Mek, Sentani, and the seven small language families of the tail of Papua New Guinea (Koiarian, Goilalan, etc., which he maintains have not been shown to be closely related to each other) may belong to TNG as well.

===Ross (2005)===
Ross does not use specialized terms for different levels of classification as Donald Laycock and Stephen Wurm did. In the list given here, the uncontroversial families that are accepted by Foley and other Papuanists and that are the building blocks of Ross&#x27;s TNG are printed in boldface. Language isolates are printed in &quot;italics&quot;.

Ross removed about 100 languages from Wurm&#x27;s proposal, and only tentatively retained a few dozen more, but in one instance he added a language, the isolate Porome.

Ross did not have sufficient evidence to classify all Papuan groups. In addition, the classification is based on a single feature – shared pronouns, especially 1sg and 2sg – and thus is subject to false positives as well as to missing branches that have undergone significant sound changes, since he does not have the data to establish regular sound correspondences.

;Unclassified Wurmian languages
Although Ross based his classification on pronoun systems, many languages in New Guinea are too poorly documented for even this to work. Thus there are several isolates that were placed in TNG by Wurm but that cannot be addressed by Ross&#x27;s classification. A few of them (Komyandaret, Samarokena, and maybe Kenati) have since been assigned to existing branches (or ex-branches) of TNG, whereas others (Massep, Momuna) continue to defy classification.

* &quot;Kenati&quot; (→ Kainantu?)
* &quot;Komyandaret&quot; (→ Greater Awyu)
* &quot;Massep&quot; isolate
* &quot;Molof&quot; isolate
* Momuna family (2)
* &quot;Samarokena&quot; (→ Kwerba)
* &quot;Tofamna&quot; isolate
* &quot;Usku&quot; isolate

;Reclassified Wurmian languages
Ross removed 95 languages from TNG. These are small families with no pronouns in common with TNG languages, but that are typologically similar, perhaps due to long periods of contact with TNG languages.

* Border and Morwap (Elseng), as an independent Border family (15 languages)
* &quot;Isirawa (Saberi),&quot; as a language isolate (though classified as Kwerba by Clouse, Donohue &amp; Ma 2002)

===&quot;Glottolog&quot; 5.0 (2024)===
&quot;Glottolog&quot;, of which Hammarström is one of the editors, accepts 10 groups as part of a &quot;Nuclear Trans–New Guinea&quot; family, based on Foley (2000), Pawley (2005) and Edgar Suter (1997).

*Madang (108 languages)
*Finisterre-Huon (61)
*Asmat-Awyu-Ok (49)
*Kainantu-Goroka (28)
*Chimbu-Wahgi (17)
*Enga-Kewa-Huli (14)

*Paniai Lakes (5)

===Dryer (2022)===

Matthew Dryer used lexicostatistics to evaluate Pawley and Hammarström (2018), based on 40-word Swadesh list data from the ASJP database. Dryer concludes that the following language families are likely to be Trans–New Guinea. They are listed in order of highest to lowest score, i.e. starting with the most likely.

Dryer does not consider that evidence based solely on pronouns and the word for &#x27;louse&#x27; is sufficient to conclude that a family is a member of Trans-New Guinea. This is because they are more likely to be an areal form (&quot;Wanderwort&quot;) in the case of the word for &#x27;louse&#x27; or to be highly conservative in the case of pronouns. Dryer states that similarities solely in pronouns mean that the families are related but that the relationship is so distant as to be &quot;undetectable&quot;.

Dryer notes that this is a preliminary quantitative analysis and only gives a rough prediction of the families that may or may not belong within Trans–New Guinea, and that the lexical similarities it is based on may be due to loanwords, areal forms (&quot;Wanderwörter&quot;) and so forth.


*Madang
*Chimbu–Wahgi
*Awyu–Ok
*Enga–Kewa–Huli
*Kiwaian
*Finisterre–Huon
*Dagan
*Yareban
*&quot;Wiru&quot;
*Bayono–Awbono
*Paniai Lakes
*Turama–Kikorian
*Kainantu–Goroka

*Dani
*Angan
*Somahai
*East Strickland
*Koiarian
*&quot;Fuyug&quot;
*&quot;Fasu&quot;
*Gogodala–Suki
*&quot;Damal&quot;
*Manubaran
*Anim
*Greater Binanderean
(Pawley and Hammarström (2018) do not classify Bayono–Awbono and Damal as Trans–New Guinea.)

Dryer lists the following families as &quot;borderline&quot;. They have a somewhat higher basic lexical similarity with Trans–New Guinea than with non-Trans–New Guinea families:

*Bosavi
*Goilalan
*South Bird&#x27;s Head
*Timor–Alor–Pantar
*&quot;Fasu&quot;
*&quot;Bogaya&quot;
*Teberan

(Pawley and Hammarström (2018) do not classify South Bird&#x27;s Head, Timor–Alor–Pantar or Teberan as Trans–New Guinea.)

Dryer lists the following families as less likely to be Trans–New Guinea. They have few basic vocabulary items in common with Trans–New Guinea:

*Mailuan
*&quot;Duna&quot;
*Asmat–Kamrau Bay
*Kwalean
*Kolopom
*West Bomberai
*Mek
*Elevala
*&quot;Moraori&quot;
*Kayagaric
*&quot;Mulaha&quot;
===Usher &amp; Suter (2024)===
Timothy Usher and Edgar Suter, in consultation with Papuan language researchers such as William Croft, Matthew Dryer, John Lynch, Andrew Pawley, and Malcolm Ross, have reconstructed low-level constituents of Trans–New Guinea to verify, through the establishment of regular sound changes, which purported members truly belong to it, and to determine their subclassification. In many cases Usher has created new names for the member families to reflect their geographic location. Much of Usher&#x27;s classification is accepted by &quot;Glottolog&quot;, though under different names. As of 2024, his classification is as follows, including correspondences to the names in earlier classifications. He expects to expand the membership of the family as reconstruction proceeds.
*Berau Gulf
**&quot;Mor&quot;
**North Berau Gulf (= South Bird&#x27;s Head)
***Yabin
***South Bird&#x27;s Head (= nuclear South Bird&#x27;s Head plus Inanwatan)
**West Bomberai (incl. Timor–Alor–Pantar)
*Sumuri
*West Papuan Highlands (= Irian Highlands)
**Amung–Dem
***Amung (Uhunduni)
***Dem
**Balim Valley (= Dani)
**Paniai Lakes
*Asmat – Muli Strait
**Asmat – Kamrau Bay (= Asmat–Kamoro)
**Muli Strait (= Mombum)
*Cook River – Kolopom
**Cook River (= Kayagar)
**Kolopom (incl. Moraori)
*Oksap (Oksapmin)
*Central West New Guinea
**Digul River – Ok
***Digul River (= Greater Awyu, incl. Bayono-Awbono)
***Kamula – Elevala River (= Awin–Pa plus Kamula)
***Ok
**Momuna–Mek
***Mek
***Momuna
*Papuan Plateau (= Bosavi, incl. Dibiyaso)
*Duna–Bogaia
*Abom
*Fly River (Anim)
**Inland Gulf
**Lake Murray (= Boazi)
**Lower Fly River (= Tirio)
**Marind–Yakhai (= Marind)
*Eastern Highlands – Kratke Range
**Eastern Highlands (= Kainantu–Goroka)
**Kratke Range (= Angan)
*Finisterre–Huon
*Papuan Peninsula (Southeast Papuan)
**Meneao Range (= Dagan)
**Owen Stanley Range
***Koiari – Managalas Plateau (= Koiarian)
***Humene–Uare (= Kwalean)
***Mount Brown (= Manubaran)
***Cloudy Bay – Musa River
****&quot;Bauwaki&quot;
****Cloudy Bay (= Mailuan)
****Musa River (= Yareban)
These branches may cluster together (the southwestern branches, for example, may group together), but the details are as yet unclear.

The families from the Ross and Glottolog classifications that are not included are Kaure, Pauwasi, Engan, Chimbu–Wahgi, Madang, Eleman, Kiwaian, Binanderean, Goilalan, and the several Papuan Gulf families. Usher only includes families that have a regular reflex of the 2sg pronoun, so there may be additional TNG families that have changed their pronouns.

==Lexical semantics==
A number of colexification patterns (called &#x27;semantic conflations&#x27; by Donald Laycock), particularly in the nominal domain, are commonly found among Trans–New Guinea languages:
*[man, husband]
*[woman, wife]
*[bird, bat]
*[hair, fur, feather, leaf]
*[tree, firewood, fire]
*[water, river]
*[bark, skin of animal, peel or skin of fruit]
*[bark, skin, body]
*[egg, fruit, seed; some other round objects, e.g. kidney, eye, heart]
*[hand, foreleg of quadruped, wing]
*[heart, seat of emotions]
*[blood, red]
*[garden, work], [to make gardens, to work]
*[joint, elbow, knee]
*[milk, sap, semen, white of egg, bone marrow]
*[nose, face]
*[teeth, internal mouth]
*[leg, foot, hindleg]
*[finger, toe]
*[father, owner; mother, owner]

<text>Firaxis Games, Inc. is an American video game developer based in Sparks, Maryland. The company was founded in May 1996 by Sid Meier, Jeff Briggs, and Brian Reynolds following their departure from MicroProse, Meier&#x27;s earlier venture. They were acquired by Take-Two Interactive in August 2005, and subsequently became part of the publisher&#x27;s 2K label. Firaxis Games is best known for developing the &quot;Civilization&quot; and &quot;XCOM&quot; series, as well as many other games bearing Meier&#x27;s name.

== History ==

Firaxis Software was founded on May 1, 1996, by Sid Meier, Brian Reynolds and Jeff Briggs, three video game designers formerly employed by MicroProse, a video game venture founded by Meier and partner Bill Stealey in 1982. The name &quot;Firaxis&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;fiery&quot; and &quot;axis&quot;, was derived from the name of a piece of music created by Briggs. Briggs explained that they decided to stay in the Baltimore area, rather than moving to Silicon Valley, because it was &quot;just a great place to be&quot;. 

Unlike MicroProse, Firaxis Software aimed at being a &quot;design house&quot;, leaving manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of their games to outside contractors. As such, the company talked to six potential video game publishers for their games, and finally signed an agreement with Electronic Arts, through which their games would be distributed under Electronic Arts&#x27; Origin Systems label. 

The studio&#x27;s opening was announced on June 24, 1996. Firaxis Software was originally located in a 2,500-square-foot office on Gilroy Road in Hunt Valley, Maryland, temporarily sharing office space. To accommodate their growth, in February 1997, they announced that they were moving their corporate headquarters to a 7,200-square-foot office suite in Executive Plaza III, an office building at 11350 McCormick Road and part of the Hunt Valley Business Community. The deal, assisted by broker William W. Whitty Jr. of MacKenzie/O&#x27;Conor, Piper &amp; Flynn Commercial Real Estate Services, was expected to be completed by March that year. The company had 13 employees at the time.

Firaxis Software announced their first title, &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Gettysburg!&quot;, in June 1997. Interimly, on July 24, 1997, the company was legally renamed Firaxis Games. Electronic Arts announced they had acquired a minority interest in Firaxis Games, at undisclosed terms, in August 1997. By September 1997, Firaxis Games signed life insurances for its three founders. &quot;Gettysburg!&quot; was released in October 1997 to critical and commercial success, scoring near-perfect reviews from critics, and selling 200,000 copies by August 1999. Starting with &quot;Gettysburg!&quot;, Firaxis Games prefixed all games designed by Meier with &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s&quot;, a trend the three founders carried over from MicroProse, as they believed that Meier&#x27;s name added more recognizability to their games. For his works on many MicroProse games, as well as &quot;Gettysburg!&quot; and Firaxis Games&#x27; second title, &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Alpha Centauri&quot;, Meier became the second-ever person in the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27;s Hall of Fame, following Shigeru Miyamoto. Co-founder Reynolds left Firaxis Games to pursue his personal interests in February 2000. To compensate his departure, the company started hiring various industry veterans by March 2000. For his executive engagement at Firaxis Games, co-founder and chief executive officer Briggs was named &quot;CEO of the Year&quot; by &quot;Smart CEO Magazine&quot; in October 2004. Briggs later left the company in November 2006, and was succeeded by Steve Martin. Also for his executive work at Firaxis Games, Martin was awarded the &quot;Maryland International Business Leadership Award&quot; by the World Trade Center Institute in March 2011.

In November 2004, Infogrames, at the time owner of the &quot;Civilization&quot; franchise and parent to the series&#x27; publisher, sold all intellectual property (IP) to an undisclosed buyer for . The buyer was announced to be Take-Two Interactive on January 26, 2005. The publisher announced that the franchise would be managed by their 2K label, which was founded the day before, and that Firaxis Games would stay in charge of the series&#x27; development. In March 2005, NDL announced a partnership with Firaxis Games, wherein their Gamebryo engine would be used for the development of &quot;Civilization IV&quot;, which was to be released later that year. On November 7, 2005, Take-Two Interactive announced that they had acquired Firaxis Games. Through the deal, Firaxis Games became part of 2K, although its present management and development plans would stay intact. Meier and Briggs both expressed that the acquisition saw a great opportunity for Firaxis Games in terms of creative development and marketing capabilities, and were fortunate to have re-gained full control over the &quot;Civilization&quot; franchise. In April 2007, Soren Johnson, lead designer on &quot;Civilization IV&quot;, left the company to move to Maxis and work on &quot;Spore&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Civilization V&quot; lead designer Jon Shafer departed following the game&#x27;s release, in December 2010.

In August 2014, Firaxis Games announced Firaxicon, a convention dedicated to Firaxis games. The event was held from September 27 to 28, 2014, at a hotel in Hunt Valley, and included meet and greets with the company&#x27;s staff, a presentation titled &quot;An Evening with Sid Meier&quot;, and early playtests of &quot;&quot;. A tour of Firaxis Games&#x27; offices was also held at the event. The event was renewed for a second edition in July 2015, and held on October 3, 2015, at the Baltimore Convention Center. Events were similar to that of the 2014 event, with &quot;XCOM 2&quot; and &quot;&quot; up for early testing.

By December 2015, Firaxis Games expanded their Sparks headquarters, which they moved to in 2009, to , and employed 40 new staff, totaling to 180 employees present at the company. In June 2016, at the Games for Change festival, Firaxis Games announced that they had partnered with GlassLab to develop &quot;CivilizationEDU&quot;, an educational derivative of &quot;Civilization V&quot; optimized for classrooms. On July 23, 2018, David Ismailer of 2K confirmed that Firaxis Games was working on a new IP. 

On February 17, 2023, it was announced that Midnight Suns creative director Jake Solomon and longtime Firaxis boss Steve Martin were exiting the company. COO Heather Hazen was promoted to replace Martin. On May 30, 30 employees were laid off from Firaxis as part of cost-saving measures implemented by parent company Take-Two Interactive.

<text>Eric Randolph Barnes (born June 16, 1966) is an American former shot putter who held the outdoor world record for the event from 1990 to 2021. He won silver at the 1988 Olympics and gold at the 1996 Olympics. Only three throwers have been within of his outdoor world record since it was set.

==Biography==
Barnes was born in Charleston, West Virginia, grew up in nearby St. Albans, and began putting the shot in high school. In 1985, he put an impressive with the prep shot of . After graduating from St. Albans High School in 1985, he attended Texas A&amp;M University where he broke school records (set by Randy Matson) with a put of with the full size shot. While at A&amp;M, Randy worked with hall of famer conditioning coach Istvan Javorek and throws coach Robert Parker.

He went to the 1988 Seoul Olympics where he put and earned a silver medal at only 22. He came second to Ulf Timmermann of East Germany, who put at the height of East German doping dominance. On January 20, 1989, he set a new indoor world record at the Sunkist Invitational in Los Angeles with a put of , which was better than his outdoor personal best at the time.

On May 20, 1990, he broke Ulf Timmermann&#x27;s outdoor record with a put of . Six days later Timmermann almost matched his world record, throwing at the Bruce Jenner Invitational in San Jose. Barnes was banned from competing for 27 months after testing positive for the anabolic steroid methyltestosterone at a competition in Malmö, Sweden, on August 7 that same year. He sued to have the suspension overturned but lost. Due to the suspension, he was unable to compete in the 1992 Olympics.

At the 1996 Olympic Games, Barnes won the gold medal that eluded him 8 years earlier with a come-from-behind put on his final attempt. In 1998, he tested positive for androstenedione, an over-the-counter supplement (famously used by baseball player Mark McGwire) that is banned in track and field. Although Barnes claimed he did not know androsten was banned, he was suspended from competition for life.

Barnes later became a long driving competitor, competing to hit a golf ball as far as possible; he qualified for the 2005 World Long Drive Championship.

<text>The following lists events that happened during [[1961]] in [[Afghanistan]].

==Incumbents==
* Monarch - Mohammed Zahir Shah
* Prime Minister - Mohammed Daoud Khan

==April 1961==
Prime Minister Sardar Mohammad Daud Khan visits the Soviet Union at the personal invitation of Nikita Khrushchev. They issue a statement of full mutual understanding and identity of long-range views.

==June 1961==
Mohammad Daud announces that his government seeks $700 million in aid from the United States and the U.S.S.R. to implement the second five-year plan, which aims at an increase of 8% to 10% annually in the national income over the plan period. Industrial production is to rise 375% and investment 500%.

==Late August 1961==
Due to the controversy over Pakhtunistan (or Pathanistan; the Afghan demand for self-determination for about 7,000,000 members of border tribes), the Pakistan government closes Afghan consulates and trade missions in its territory. Afghanistan thereupon sets September 6, 1961, as a deadline for Pakistan to rescind the order. Pakistan does not.

==September 1961==
On September 3, 1961, Afghanistan seals its side of the border and on September 6, 1961, breaks relations. The consequences are far-reaching, as Afghanistan then demands that all trade, including U.S. economic aid, be channeled through Soviet access routes. Sixty percent of the Afghan population is Pakhtun (Pathan) and Afghanistan has steadfastly refused to accept the old Afghan-British Durand line of 1893 as a suitable permanent boundary between the Pathans of Afghanistan and of Pakistan, while Pakistan refused to draw a new frontier. Throughout 1961 the two nations exchanged charges, Afghanistan saying that Pakistan brutally suppressed tribal leaders and bombed them with U.S.-made aircraft, while Pakistan alleged that Afghan armed forces, using Soviet equipment, constantly violated the border. The Afghan representative to the United Nations, A.R. Pazhwak, strongly defended the concept of Pathan self-determination.

Afghanistan completes its first five-year plan, with some sectors described as over-fulfilled. Daud attends the Belgrade conference of non-aligned nations, visiting Britain and West Germany first.

<doc id="295664" wikidata="Q4352362" url="?curid=295664" title="A. P. Herbert">
<text>Sir Alan Patrick Herbert (known as A. P. Herbert; 24 September 1890 – 11 November 1971), was an English humorist, novelist, playwright, law reformist, and, from 1935 to 1950, an independent Member of Parliament for Oxford University. 

Born in Ashtead, Surrey, he attended Winchester College and New College, Oxford, receiving a starred first in jurisprudence in 1914. He joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as a seaman in the First World War, becoming an officer in the Royal Naval Division. He fought in Gallipoli and on the Western Front, as a battalion adjutant in 1917, before injury removed him from the front line. After the war he published &quot;The Secret Battle&quot; and in 1924 joined the staff of &quot;Punch&quot;. As an MP he campaigned for private-member rights, piloted the Matrimonial Causes Act 1937 through Parliament, opposed Entertainments Duty and campaigned against the Oxford Group. He joined the River Emergency Service in 1938, captaining a boat on the River Thames in the Second World War as a petty officer in the Royal Naval Auxiliary Patrol. In 1943, he joined a parliamentary commission on the future of the Dominion of Newfoundland.

==Early life and education==
Herbert was born at Ashtead Lodge, Ashtead, Surrey, on 24 September 1890. His father, Patrick Herbert Coghlan Herbert (1849–1915), was a civil servant (assistant secretary of the Judicial and Public Department) in the India Office, of Irish origin, and his mother, Beatrice Eugenie (née Selwyn), was the daughter of Sir Charles Jasper Selwyn, a Lord Justice of Appeal. His two younger brothers both died in battle: Owen William Eugene, Second lieutenant, Royal Field Artillery, killed at Mons in 1914, and Sidney Jasper, Captain R.N., killed 1941 aboard HMS &quot;Hood&quot;. His mother died of tuberculosis when he was eight, shortly before he left for The Grange in Folkestone, a preparatory school.

Herbert then attended Winchester College, winning the King&#x27;s Medal for English Verse and the King&#x27;s Medal for English Speech, presented by Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. He took an active part in the college debating and Shakespeare societies. As a Winchester student, Herbert sent verses to the offices of &quot;Punch&quot; and received notes of encouragement and suggestions from the editor, Owen Seaman. Herbert was also Captain of Houses, one of the college&#x27;s three football divisions.

Herbert went to New College, Oxford as an exhibitioner. He made his first public speech at the Kensington branch of the Tariff Reform League, speaking &quot;extempore&quot; on home rule. His first contribution to &quot;Punch&quot; was printed on 24 August 1910: a set of verses entitled &quot;Stones of Venus&quot;. He went up to Oxford in October and made his first speech at the Oxford Union in November. His work began appearing not only in &quot;Punch&quot;, but in &quot;The Observer&quot;, the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;.

Herbert received a &quot;not very good Second&quot; in Honour Moderations, and apparently disenchanted with Classics, changed his degree to Law. He went into lodgings with Walter Monckton and others and was good friends with the notables Duff Cooper, Harold Macmillan and Philip Guedalla. Herbert finished at Oxford in 1914 with &quot;a very good First&quot; in Jurisprudence. He then decided to join his friend Jack Parr as a volunteer at Oxford House in Bethnal Green for a year. He spent the time &quot;doing what I could:&quot; washing dishes, sweeping floors, running errands and collecting money.

==First World War service, 1914–1918==
On 5 September 1914, Herbert enlisted at Lambeth Pier as an ordinary seaman in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, which later became one of the constituent bodies of the Royal Naval Division. In early October, news reached him that his brother, Owen Herbert, had been posted &quot;missing, believed killed&quot; in the retreat from Mons. Herbert reached the rank of acting leading seaman before being commissioned as a sub-lieutenant in early 1915, when he was posted to Hawke Battalion of the Royal Naval Division (later to come under army command as part of the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division).

&quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; companies of the Hawke Battalion left for Gallipoli in early 1915, briefly stopping in Malta before arriving at the Moudros on 17 May, and finally reaching Gallipoli on 27 May. Herbert took command of No. 11 Platoon, &quot;C&quot; Company, composed mostly of Tynesiders and also two men from a remote Durham mining town. A week after his arrival, the battalion suffered heavy casualties at the Third Battle of Krithia. In July 1915, Herbert went down with illness and had to spend time recovering in a military hospital. When he was passed &quot;fit for light duty&quot;, he was seconded to the Naval Intelligence Division at Whitehall. It was then that he decided to rent No. 12 Hammersmith Terrace as a dwelling.
In summer 1916, when he was passed fit for duty, Herbert returned to Hawke Battalion at their base camp in Abbeville, where he was made assistant adjutant. The battalion moved to the front line at Souchez in July 1916, and in mid-November it took part in an attack on Beaucourt-sur-l&#x27;Ancre during the Battle of the Ancre, which saw almost the entire battalion wiped out. Herbert was one of only two officers to come out unscathed from the attack. When the battalion returned to the front line at Pozières in February 1917, Herbert was made the battalion&#x27;s adjutant, but he was later injured from shrapnel during an attack on Gavrelle, west of Arras.

On medical leave back in England after the injury, Herbert began writing his first book, &quot;The Secret Battle&quot;, which he finished &quot;in a few weeks&quot;. He was elected a member of the Savage Club and raised by &quot;Punch&quot; to the &quot;exclusive group of its contributors who were allowed to attach their initials to their work.&quot; On 2 October 1918, Herbert sailed from Liverpool in a convoy for Alexandria, as assistant to the Commodore. After arriving at Port Said, he was given a free pass to Cairo and allowed to make a number of unaccompanied incursions inland. He was able to visit several places on the North African coast, and from Tunis took a train to Constantine, Algeria and then to Algiers. On 11 November, he went by train from Oran to Tlemcen. Exactly at 11 am, he heard that the Armistice had been signed. As he wrote, &quot;I must have been the only Englishman for at least 80 miles.&quot;

Herbert was granted shore leave at Gibraltar and took the chance to travel to Seville, then to Córdoba. He arrived in Madrid on 22 November and dined with the Embassy&#x27;s naval attaché, Captain John Harvey, as well as Filson Young and others, before making the return journey to Gibraltar.

==Interwar career, 1918–1935==
&quot;The Secret Battle&quot; was recommended to Methuen Publishing by E. V. Lucas and announced in their spring list in 1919. It was &quot;read all night&quot; by Prime Minister Lloyd George, who brought it to the attention of Churchill, then Secretary of State for War. Montgomery saw it as &quot;the best story of front line war&quot; and Herbert himself believed that court-martial arrangements were subsequently &quot;altered in some way&quot; as a result of the book. However, the book had no great commercial success, which his biographer Reginald Pound puts down to the fact that &quot;Readers, it seems, were tired of war as a dramatic theme.&quot;

Herbert was called to the Bar by Inner Temple in 1919 and entered the chambers of Leslie Scott. He was joined by two Oxford friends, Walter Monckton and Henry Strauss, who were called on the same day. Although he spent time at Inner Temple, he never practised law and did not enter a legal career. He later said he was &quot;forever sorry&quot; not to be &quot;of the proud and faithful brotherhood who serve the laws of England.&quot;

Unable to sustain himself on &quot;Punch&quot;″s &quot;eccentric rates of payment&quot;, Herbert wrote his second book, &quot;The House by the River&quot;, in two months. It was published in 1920. He handed his literary business to A. P. Watt, who sold the American rights to &quot;The House by the River&quot; and published a collection of his prose submissions to &quot;Punch&quot; under the title &quot;Light Articles Only&quot;.

In January 1924, Owen Seaman, the editor of &quot;Punch&quot;, invited Herbert to join its staff. Herbert accepted and his accession meant he would receive a salary of £50 a week. In 1925, Herbert attended the Third Imperial Press Conference on behalf of &quot;Punch&quot;, where he made his first speech in front of a large audience in Melbourne, where it was described as &quot;delectably witty&quot; by Sir Harry Brittain.

In 1926, Herbert was invited by Nigel Playfair to write &quot;an entertainment&quot; for the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. The result was &quot;Riverside Nights&quot;, performed at the Lyric in April 1926. His next play, &quot;The White Witch&quot;, was performed at Haymarket Theatre in September 1926.

==Early parliamentary career, 1935–1939==
Herbert first encountered Parliament in 1934, when he brought the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons to court for selling liquor without a licence. Hewart, LCJ ruled that the court would not hear the complaint because the matter fell within parliamentary privilege. Since the decision was never challenged in a higher court, it led to a unique situation of uncertainty as to &quot;the extent to which statute law applies to either House of Parliament.&quot; The following year Herbert published &quot;Uncommon Law&quot;, and Hewart contributed a generous introduction.

Herbert first had the idea of standing for Parliament a few weeks before the 1935 general election, when he ran into Frederick Lindemann, who had just been rejected as Conservative candidate for Oxford University. Herbert decided to stand as an Independent, aided by Frank Pakenham as his election agent. Herbert wrote an &quot;unconventional&quot; 5,000-word election address, which included the statement, &quot;Agriculture: I know nothing about agriculture.&quot;

Herbert was elected as an Independent supporter of the National Government. Defying the advice of more experienced members, including Austen Chamberlain, he made his maiden speech on 4 December 1935, the second day of the opening session of the new Parliament. He protested to Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin on a motion that would give precedence to government bills over private member&#x27;s bills. He went into the &quot;No&quot; lobby alongside the members of the Independent Labour Party and fellow University member Eleanor Rathbone, but the motion was passed by 232 to 5. Churchill praised Herbert for his &quot;composure and aplomb&quot; and famously said: &quot;Call that a maiden speech? It was a brazen hussy of a speech. Never did such a painted lady of a speech parade itself before a modest Parliament.&quot; During the speech, Herbert promised to introduce his Matrimonial Causes Bill into law by the end of the Parliament.

Herbert&#x27;s novel &quot;Holy Deadlock&quot; (1934) deals at length with the inconsistencies of English divorce law. Malavika Rajkotia writes that &quot;This novel sparked off the first divorce law reform movement in England, which led to the passing of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1937&quot;. In 1936, Herbert failed to be drawn in the private members&#x27; ballot but managed to get the Conservative Rupert De la Bère to sponsor the bill. On 20 November, Herbert made a speech in its favour and it passed its second reading by 78 votes to 12. It was given a third reading in the House of Lords on 19 July 1937 and passed by 79 votes to 28. It was passed, somewhat strengthened by the House of Lords, in 1938 as the Matrimonial Causes Act 1937. It allowed divorce to be given without requiring proof of adultery, but fake adulteries and bizarre rules about collusion persisted until the Divorce Reform Act 1969 came into force in 1971.

During the prewar period, Herbert drafted a number of bills that were printed on the Order Paper, including a Betting and Bookmakers Bill, a Public Refreshment Bill and a Spring (Arrangements) Bill, which was written in verse. Herbert made numerous attacks on the Entertainments Duty, which had been introduced as a &quot;temporary, war-time tax&quot; in 1916. In his campaign against the duty, Herbert worked closely with William Mabane, and they made some headway when in 1939 the Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon reduced the duty. Herbert also spoke out against the proposed Population (Statistics) Bill in 1937 by making a speech that was received with &quot;loud laughter&quot; in the Commons chamber, making it, according to &quot;Punch&quot;, &quot;an astonishing occasion&quot;. Herbert and others brought in several amendments to the bill before it reached the statute book in 1938.

Herbert was also a fervent opponent of the Oxford Group and its leader, Frank Buchman. In particular, he opposed the use of &quot;Oxford&quot; in its name and its supposed association with the University of Oxford. He was supported by the university in his endeavours, particularly by the Oxford Union, which unanimously passed a resolution in support of him. Support for Herbert was also expressed by H. A. L. Fisher, the Warden of New College, Oxford, and Douglas Veale, the Registrar of the University of Oxford.

==Second World War service, 1939–1945==
On 3 November 1938, Herbert enrolled himself and his boat, the &quot;Water Gipsy&quot;, in the River Emergency Service, which was under the control of the Port of London Authority. Over the summer of 1939, he had taken part in exercises involving simulated air raids and casualty retrieval. In early September 1939, the River Emergency Service reported to its war stations. Herbert&#x27;s own crew consisted of Darcy Braddell, vice-president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Victor Pasmore, Magnus Pyke and John Pudney. At the sounding of the first air-raid siren in London in 1939, the &quot;Water Gipsy&quot; was anchored off the Speaker&#x27;s Steps by Westminster Bridge. A number of MPs left the Commons following the sirens and cheered the &quot;Water Gipsy&quot; as the only naval vessel in sight before they saluted it.

During the Second World War, Herbert was the only non-commissioned officer in the House of Commons, and he wore his uniform on any and every occasion during the war. He turned down efforts to persuade him to apply for a commission, although he once appeared before a selection board against his will. He also turned down the offer of a role in Churchill&#x27;s war cabinet when asked by saying, &quot;No, thank you, sir. I&#x27;m quite happy where I am.&quot;

Herbert was sent to Newfoundland and Labrador in 1943 with Derrick Gunston and Charles Ammon as members of a parliamentary commission to investigate the future of the dominion. Of the alternatives, he supported independence, rather than Confederation with Canada.

==Later parliamentary career, 1945–1950==
After his re-election in the 1945 general election on 5 July, Herbert noted of the new Parliament that &quot;the surge of Socialism into the House of Commons was something to see.&quot; The Labour Party, under Clement Attlee, had won 393 seats and the Conservatives had won only 197. Herbert said of the newly elected Labour MPs, &quot;Arrogance, I am sorry to say, remained. There was such a concerto of nastiness and hate and imbecile yelling, that I thanked God, many times, that I was an Independent and could be silent without disloyalty&quot;. Herbert campaigned to ensure that the newly elected MPs realised the significance of private members&#x27; time. He prepared a number of private member&#x27;s bills, including ones covering betting reform, legal aid for the poor, a fairer voting system, and the abolition of decree nisi. However, he was unsuccessful in his first attempt to guarantee private members&#x27; time, which was restored later in the Parliament.

In autumn 1945, George Orwell had the essay &quot;Notes on Nationalism&quot; published in the magazine &quot;Polemic&quot; and named Herbert as one of the followers of &quot;neo-Toryism&quot;, who were marked by a &quot;desire not to recognise that British power and influence have declined.&quot; Herbert&#x27;s biographer, Reginald Pound, noted, &quot;APH would have rejected the Tory affiliation, though his inclinations were with the Right.&quot;

From July 1945 to 1946, Herbert worked on the libretto for Charles B. Cochran&#x27;s new musical, &quot;Big Ben&quot;. It opened at the Adelphi Theatre on 17 July 1946 and was watched on its opening night by Churchill, Montgomery, Attlee and Herbert, but Cochran himself was too ill to attend. During its first three months, it took an average of £4,000 a week at the box office, but the running costs were also high and so there was no fortune in it for Cochran or for Herbert. Its run was over at the end of 1946, after 172 performances. Cochran commissioned Herbert to write another musical, &quot;Bless the Bride&quot;, which opened at the Adelphi on 26 April 1947. It ran for two-and-a-quarter years, was the source of &quot;an accretion of cash&quot; for Herbert, and was Cochran&#x27;s most successful musical. It includes the hit song &#x27;Ma Belle Marguerite&#x27;.

Herbert sat on the Supreme Court Committee on Practice and Procedures, chaired by Raymond Evershed, investigating the cost of litigation. He also chaired the Literary Sub-Committee of the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, which judged the literary compositions of 29 nations in their own languages. He accepted an invitation to serve on the Council of the Festival of Britain to be held in 1951. At the time, he was already a member of the Thames Conservancy Board, a trustee of the National Maritime Museum, president of the Inland Waterways Association and a vice president of the Pedestrians&#x27; Association for Road Safety. In addition he authored a critical study of royal commissions for the Institute of Economic Affairs, which was dismissed for its &quot;light touch&quot;. Herbert commented: &quot;Had it included graphs and tables and been written in a heavy style it would have been accepted as a major contribution to the practice of sound administration.&quot;

Herbert was re-elected in the 1945 general election and continued as an MP until University seats were abolished in 1950 under the Representation of the People Act 1948. Herbert&#x27;s last speech, on 23 November 1949, was strongly in favour of the Festival of Britain. He was knighted in 1945 in Winston Churchill&#x27;s Resignation Honours. &quot;The Times&quot; noted &quot;his individual niche in the parliamentary temple as the doughty vindicator of the private member&#x27;s rights, including not least the right to legislate.&quot;

In 1951, Herbert published a memoir of his service in the House of Commons: &quot;Independent Member&quot; (Garden City, New York: Doubleday &amp; Co., Inc., 1951). Ten years later he was the subject of a &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; TV programme in 1961, when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.

==Personal life==

Herbert first met his future wife, Gwendolyn Harriet Quilter, daughter of Harry Quilter, in the summer of 1914. They became engaged in December 1914 and were married in the first week of 1915 by Frederic Iremonger, Vicar of St James the Great in Bethnal Green. Herbert wore his formal dress uniform as an Acting Leading Seaman for the wedding. They spent their honeymoon in a room in Fulham Road. 

Gwendolyn lived to the age of 97, dying in 1986. Lady Herbert was elected in 1966 as the first President of Hammersmith Chess Club and was a well-known face on the chess circuit. They had four children: Crystal, Lavender, Jocelyn and John.

===The Thames===
Herbert loved the River Thames. He lived beside it at Hammersmith, West London. He was a member of the Thames Conservancy Board and a Freeman of the Company of Watermen and Lightermen. 

In 1966, he wrote a book, &quot;The Thames&quot; (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson), in which he explored the &quot;machinery&quot; of the river in all its aspects.

==Death==
In the last days of 1970, Herbert was taken to Middlesex Hospital in Fitzrovia, after a seizure that affected his left side and arm. Within six weeks, he was home again, but over many months his physical powers waned. In August 1971, he wrote his last letter to &quot;The Times&quot;, an appeal for parliamentary good manners in refraining from &quot;witty derision of the literary exertions of Mr Harold Wilson&quot; and of the &quot;marine activities&quot; of Edward Heath. By then, he was describing himself as &quot;a recumbent nuisance&quot;.

A. P. Herbert died on 11 November 1971. Obituaries were published in &quot;The Times&quot; and in &quot;Punch&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; accompanied its obituary notice with a leading article, saying he had done &quot;more than any man of his day to add to the gaiety of the nation.&quot;

A memorial service on 6 December in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields which was &quot;crowded to overflowing&quot;. On 7 December, the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; of the US House of Representatives appeared with four pages of tributes to Herbert by congressmen from Ohio, Missouri, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Robert H. Land, chief of the Reference Department of the Library of Congress, later said that there was &quot;[no] record or recollection of a similar tribute to another English writer in the proceedings of Congress.&quot;

==References by other authors==
In a 1957 article entitled &quot;Over Seventy&quot;, lamenting the decline of the humorist, P. G. Wodehouse wrote: &quot;I want to see an A. P. Herbert on every street corner, an Alex Atkinson in every local.&quot;

The title of Alexandra Fuller&#x27;s 2001 memoir &quot;Don&#x27;t Let&#x27;s Go to the Dogs Tonight: An African Childhood&quot; is taken from a Herbert quote, &quot;Don&#x27;t let&#x27;s go to the dogs tonight, for Mother will be there.&quot;

==&quot;Misleading cases&quot;==
Starting in 1910, he contributed regularly to &quot;Punch&quot;. One series of his that it took was &quot;Misleading Cases in the Common Law&quot; – the work for which he is best remembered. These were satirical pieces in the form of &quot;law reports&quot; or &quot;legal judgments&quot; on various aspects of the English legal and judicial system. Many featured the exploits of Albert Haddock, a tireless and veteran litigant. One of the best-known and most colourful is &quot;Board of Inland Revenue v Haddock,&quot; also known as &quot;The Negotiable Cow&quot;. Even the title is a humorous allusion to the entirely serious &quot;Smith&#x27;s Leading Cases&quot;. Herbert often referred to himself as &quot;A. P. Haddock&quot; in skits in &quot;Punch&quot; magazine, whether or not these had a courtroom setting.

Thanks to their realism, Herbert&#x27;s satires were on several occasions mistakenly reported by newspapers, both in Britain and elsewhere, as factual. One of the &quot;cases&quot;, supposedly establishing a novel crime of &quot;doing what you like&quot;, was sharply criticised by an American law review article, whose author failed to note its entire absurdity. As such, Herbert&#x27;s contributions are examples of the literary technique known as false document. Whereas in these fictitious law reports, the fictitious judges and lawyers regularly cited various real and venerable authorities, such as Henry de Bracton, they were prone also to citing texts of Herbert&#x27;s own imagining, such as &quot;Wedderburn on Water Courses&quot; and &quot;A. Capone&#x27;s Handbook for Bootleggers&quot;.

More importantly, the cases were Herbert&#x27;s vehicles for law-reform work. Beneath their satire, they often made cogent legal or political points that tied into his personal crusades against obsolescent legislation. Although fictional, they are consequently sometimes quoted in judicial decisions, and are also the subject of academic research.

Over his lifetime Herbert published five collections, entitled &quot;Misleading Cases in the Common Law&quot;, &quot;More Misleading Cases&quot;, &quot;Still More Misleading Cases&quot;, &quot;Codd&#x27;s Last Case&quot; and &quot;Bardot M.P.?&quot;. Stray cases also appear in his collections of miscellaneous humorous essays, such as &quot;General Cargo&quot;. Virtually all the cases were assembled into two omnibus volumes, &quot;Uncommon Law&quot; in 1935 and &quot;More Uncommon Law&quot; in 1982. A shorter selection, &quot;Wigs at Work&quot;, appeared in 1966.

The BBC successfully adapted these for television, as three series of &quot;A P Herbert&#x27;s Misleading Cases&quot; (1967, 1968 and 1971), with Roy Dotrice as Haddock and Alastair Sim as the judge, Mr Justice Swallow.

==Novels and other writings==
Herbert wrote eight novels, including &quot;The Water Gipsies&quot; (1930) and &quot;Number Nine&quot; (1951), about a post-war civil service, a weekend selection and 15 plays, including the light operas &quot;Tantivy Towers&quot; (1931) and &quot;Big Ben&quot; (1946), and the comedy &quot;Bless the Bride&quot; (1947), which ran for two-and-a-quarter years in London.

Herbert published three comic epistolary novels featuring a slangy flapper named Topsy: &quot;The Trials of Topsy&quot; (1928) &quot;Topsy, MP&quot; (1929), and &quot;Topsy Turvy&quot; (1947). They originated as letters published in &quot;Punch&quot;, and were published together in 1949 as &quot;The Topsy Omnibus,&quot; and later in a bowdlerized edition, &quot;The Voluble Topsy, 1928-1947&quot; (2023).

In addition to his fiction, Herbert wrote &quot;What a Word!&quot; in 1935, continuing his campaign in &quot;Punch&quot; for better use of English, including a section on &quot;Plain English&quot;, more than a decade ahead of Sir Ernest Gowers&#x27;s more celebrated work. Characteristically, Herbert uses humour to make his serious points about good writing. He authored the lyrics of the patriotic song &quot;Song of Liberty&quot;, set in 1940 to the music of Edward Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Pomp and Circumstance March No. 4&quot;. In 1944, a set of posters by Eric Kennington, a personal friend, called &quot;Seeing It Through&quot;, were accompanied by Herbert poems. They describe the work of certain professionals in London in the war. After the war he wrote a booklet, &quot;The War Story of Southend Pier&quot;, detailing when the pier was taken over by the Royal Navy in World War II.

In 1967, Herbert published &quot;Sundials Old and New; or, Fun with the Sun&quot;; a book describing in detail his long fascination with and experiments in sundial technology. In the book, he describes all manner of sundials, and recounts many of his experiments in designing and building different models, including a few that could be used to tell your position on the earth as well as the local time.

In 1970 Herbert published &quot;A.P.H., His Life and Times&quot;, dedicated to &quot;My dear wife, for our 56th anniversary&quot;.

<doc id="295665" wikidata="Q3697172" url="?curid=295665" title="Crime in Estonia">
<text>Estonia is a relatively safe country, and the risk of being a victim of crime in Estonia is small by international standards. As in other post-Soviet states, crime has increased in the 1990s, but then it has gradually decreased in the 21st century.

==Crime by type==
===Murder===
In 2020, Estonia had a murder rate of 2.8 per 100,000 population. This was the third highest rate among European Union countries, behind Latvia (4.9) and Lithuania (3.5); nevertheless lower than the global average of 6.1 victims per 100,000 people (in 2017). In 2022 there were a total of 18 murders which was the lowest number since regaining independence.

The murder rate was considerably higher in the 1990s and the 2000s. An average of 9.4 people per 100,000 per year were killed in Estonia between 1999 and 2001.

===Organised crime===
Organized crime is characterized by a loose alliance of mobster groups, principally of Russian origins, with a wide range of different rackets: prostitution, motor vehicle theft, drug trafficking, and previously also &quot;providing&quot; workers to building contracts in Finland, where the criminal organizations were confiscating a share of workers&#x27; wages.

====Common Fund====
The Common Fund () is a traditional umbrella organisation of criminal groups, a trade union of sorts which settles conflicts and establishes the boundaries of the spheres of interest of the various groups. In 2003, the Common Fund had been dominated for about 15 years by Nikolai Tarankov of Russian heritage and KGB training. However, Tarankov was killed by his godson in 2016. The Common Fund pays for lawyers of caught members, purchases and delivers packages to imprisoned members and covers other expenses. Such &quot;insurance&quot; increases the loyalty of the members.

In 2005, the Estonian Central Criminal Police noticed a decline in revenues of the Common Fund, leading to capture of several high-ranking members. The decline has been attributed to changes in Estonian society, particularly those experienced in the lead-up to accession to European Union.

The police have been successful in disrupting the operations of the Obshchak by arresting their high-ranking members since at least the 2010s. One of the kingpins, Assar Paulus, was convicted in 2016 for founding a criminal organization and funding drug trafficking. The mafia got its income through illegal debt collection using methods like extortion, tax fraud, drug trafficking and violent crimes. In general, violent crime and protection rackets have become a thing of the past in the organization: it is no longer necessary for ordinary businesspeople to pay protection money to the mafia. Instead, the mafia is more involved in drug trade and white-collar crime such as tax fraud. Also, many former mafia &quot;businesspeople&quot; have moved to legitimate businesses.

===Fraud===
Aarni Neuvonen is the largest ever perpetrator of employment fraud in Estonia. He is known for having collected money with promise of overseas jobs from thousands of people and disappearing after having caused over (estimated) 10 million of EEK of damages in 1993. Avo Viiol was convicted for embezzlement in 2003. The neologism &quot;viioldama&quot;, has become a slang verb meaning &quot;to embezzle&quot;.

===Drugs===
The illegal drug trade&#x27;s turnover in Estonia according to 2008 estimates might be several billion EEK. According to the opinion of senior superintendent of narcotic crimes department at North Police Prefecture only 1% of the whole amount of drugs on the market is confiscated in Estonia. In 2011, the EUROPOL Trafficking Unit designated the Baltic states and Kaliningrad as a transit hub for drug trafficking in and out of Russia.

===Corruption===
In 2008, Transparency International has measured the Corruption Perception Index for Estonia to be at 6.6 (CI 6.2–6.9), ranking it 27th in a list of 180 countries. In comparison, neighbouring Sweden was ranked 1st–3rd with a CPI at 9.3 (CI 9.2–9.4), Finland 5th–6th with a CPI at 9.0 (CI 8.4–9.4), Russia 147th–150th with a CPI at 2.1 (CI 1.9–2.5), and Latvia 52nd with a CPI at 5.0 (CI 4.8–5.2). Higher index means perception of more transparency and less corruption. As of 2014 the Corruption Perception Index for Estonia is 6.9, placing it at the 26th position (in the context of EU above France and below Austria).
In 2022 Estonia ranked 14th.

A total of 326 corruption-related offenses were identified and registered in 2008, considerably below the number registered in 2006, when 511 instances of corruption were found, but 17% higher than in 2007, and slightly higher than in 2003. These accounted for just 0.6% of all criminal offenses.

Foreign investors do not consider corruption as a main problem of doing business in Estonia. In general, the public sector is transparent and has good compliance with anti-corruption initiatives and demonstrates adherence to ethical principles on the cultural level.

In February 2012, the government passed an anti-corruption act in order to further improve transparency in the public sector, such as asset disclosure by government officials. Public trust in the electoral system is high. However, the government still faces challenges in combating corruption. Local-level government corruption still remains a problem, and public awareness of corruption-prevention needs to be raised.

===Human trafficking===
According to Interpol in 2002, since the fall of the Soviet Union the largest group of prostitutes working in Finland has consisted of trafficked women from Estonia and Russia.

The 2012, the &quot;Trafficking in Persons Report&quot; issued by the US Trafficking state department repeats the claims of previous years that Estonia is &quot;source, transit, and destination&quot; for adult human trafficking, and that Estonia fails to comply with their minimum standards for eliminating trafficking. It now adds that the government &quot;is making significant efforts to do so&quot;. Trafficking is now treated as a serious matter by the Estonian government, which enacted a law in 2012 criminalizing trafficking in persons with penalties of up to 15 years imprisonment. The Estonian government identified 56 victims in 2011; 39 women, 17 men, and no children; 37 were sex trafficking victims, 19 were labor trafficking.

The report also states that the Estonian government funds ($US42k) an active anti-trafficking hotline, and that it has increased funding ($US158k) for anti-trafficking victim care and that it maintains a &quot;strong and supportive&quot; relationship with organisations active in anti-trafficking. To this end the government has published a victim identification guide in Estonian and Russian, for use by law enforcement officials. The government has distributed anti-trafficking material at tourism and job fairs. Consular officials have visited schools to discuss dangers of trafficking. The government has also co-ordinated efforts in trafficking-reduction/elimination with other countries and has taken various other anti-trafficking measures.

==Crime dynamics==
Estonia is one of the safest and stablest countries in Europe, but between the 1990s and the 2000s, organized crime prevailed and it was characterized by a loose alliance of mobster groups, principally of Russian origins, with a wide range of different rackets: prostitution, motor vehicle theft, drug trafficking, and previously also &quot;providing&quot; workers to building contracts in Finland, where the criminal organizations were confiscating a share of workers&#x27; wages. Although small size, the Estonian mafia was hierarchical and well-organized, which has enabled its survival to this day, albeit to a much more modest form. Also, the murder rate was considerably higher than ever during the same period in Estonia; for example, an average of 9.4 people per 100,000 per year were killed in Estonia between 1999 and 2001. According to statistics published in Britain in 2008 relating to the period 1991–2001, the number of crimes increased by 84% from 1991 to 2001. The number of discovered drug-related crimes increased by 21 between 1997 and 2001. Overall, crime has fallen precipitously between 1995 and 2010, by close to 70%.

==Crime by Estonian residents overseas==
===Jewellery robberies===
In December 2006, it was estimated that residents of Estonia were responsible for 140 robberies of jewellery and watch stores in Finland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden during the three years prior. The value of the lost property is estimated to be 25 million euros. In 2012, &quot;Le gang des Estoniens&quot; was tried in France for robbing several jeweller&#x27;s shops in Paris.

<text>Ulf Béla Timmermann (, ; born 1 November 1962 in East Berlin) is a German former shot putter who broke the world record several times during the 1980s, and is the first and one of only four people to ever throw over 23 metres (along with Randy Barnes, Joe Kovacs and Ryan Crouser).

Timmermann was born in Berlin to an athletic family and took up shot put at 13. He broke his first world record in 1985 with a throw of 22.62 meters. On 22 May 1988 he became the first person to throw over 23 meters with a throw of 23.06 meters at Chania, Greece.

He won gold for East Germany at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, ahead of Randy Barnes of the U.S. The fourth place throw at this competition would have won every previous Olympics in the shot put. At the 1992 Olympics, he represented Germany, but finished a disappointing fifth. He left competition afterwards.

Timmermann is the farthest thrower of all time in the shot put using the glide technique. He also passed 22 metres in 16 different competitions. His coach was Werner Goldmann who is currently coaching shot put and discus throw in Berlin.

<doc id="295668" wikidata="Q3318184" url="?curid=295668" title="Content moderation">
<text>On websites that allow users to create content, content moderation is the process of detecting contributions that are irrelevant, obscene, illegal, harmful, or insulting, in contrast to useful or informative contributions, frequently for censorship or suppression of opposing viewpoints. The purpose of content moderation is to remove or apply a warning label to problematic content or allow users to block and filter content themselves. 

Various types of Internet sites permit user-generated content such as posts, comments, videos including Internet forums, blogs, and news sites powered by scripts such as phpBB, a wiki, PHP-Nuke, etc. Depending on the site&#x27;s content and intended audience, the site&#x27;s administrators will decide what kinds of user comments are appropriate, then delegate the responsibility of sifting through comments to lesser moderators. Most often, they will attempt to eliminate trolling, spamming, or flaming, although this varies widely from site to site.

Major platforms use a combination of algorithmic tools, user reporting and human review. Social media sites may also employ content moderators to manually flag or remove content flagged for hate speech or other objectionable content. Other content issues include revenge porn, graphic content, child abuse material and propaganda. Some websites must also make their content hospitable to advertisements.

In the United States, content moderation is governed by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and has seen several cases concerning the issue make it to the United States Supreme Court, such as the current Moody v. NetChoice, LLC.

==Supervisor moderation==
Also known as unilateral moderation, this kind of moderation system is often seen on Internet forums. A group of people are chosen by the site&#x27;s administrators (usually on a long-term basis) to act as delegates, enforcing the community rules on their behalf. These moderators are given special privileges to delete or edit others&#x27; contributions and/or exclude people based on their e-mail address or IP address, and generally attempt to remove negative contributions throughout the community.

== Commercial content moderation ==
Commercial Content Moderation is a term coined by Sarah T. Roberts to describe the practice of &quot;monitoring and vetting user-generated content (UGC) for social media platforms of all types, in order to ensure that the content complies with legal and regulatory exigencies, site/community guidelines, user agreements, and that it falls within norms of taste and acceptability for that site and its cultural context.&quot;

=== Industrial composition ===
The content moderation industry is estimated to be worth US$9 billion. While no official numbers are provided, there are an estimates 10,000 content moderators for TikTok; 15,000 for Facebook and 1,500 for Twitter as of 2022.

The global value chain of content moderation typically includes social media platforms, large MNE firms and the content moderation suppliers. The social media platforms (e.g Facebook, Google) are largely based in the United States, Europe and China. The MNEs (e.g Accenture, Foiwe) are usually headquartered in the global north or India while suppliers of content moderation are largely located in global southern countries like India and the Philippines.

While at one time this work may have been done by volunteers within the online community, for commercial websites this is largely achieved through outsourcing the task to specialized companies, often in low-wage areas such as India and the Philippines. Outsourcing of content moderation jobs grew as a result of the social media boom. With the overwhelming growth of users and UGC, companies needed many more employees to moderate the content. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, tech companies began to outsource jobs to foreign countries that had an educated workforce but were willing to work for cheap.

=== Working conditions ===
Employees work by viewing, assessing and deleting disturbing content. Wired reported in 2014, they may suffer psychological damage In 2017, the Guardian reported secondary trauma may arise, with symptoms similar to PTSD. Some large companies such as Facebook offer psychological support and increasingly rely on the use of artificial intelligence to sort out the most graphic and inappropriate content, but critics claim that it is insufficient. In 2019, NPR called it a job hazard. Non-disclosure agreements are the norm when content moderators are hired. This makes moderators more hesitant to speak up about working conditions or organize.

Psychological hazards including stress and post-traumatic stress disorder, combined with the precarity of algorithmic management and low wages make content moderation extremely challenging. The number of tasks completed, for example labeling content as copyright violation, deleting a post containing hate-speech or reviewing graphic content are quantified for performance and quality assurance.

In February 2019, an investigative report by &quot;The Verge&quot; described poor working conditions at Cognizant&#x27;s office in Phoenix, Arizona. Cognizant employees tasked with content moderation for Facebook developed mental health issues, including post-traumatic stress disorder, as a result of exposure to graphic violence, hate speech, and conspiracy theories in the videos they were instructed to evaluate. Moderators at the Phoenix office reported drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and sexual intercourse in the workplace, and feared retaliation from terminated workers who threatened to harm them. In response, a Cognizant representative stated the company would examine the issues in the report.

&quot;The Verge&quot; published a follow-up investigation of Cognizant&#x27;s Tampa, Florida, office in June 2019. Employees in the Tampa location described working conditions that were worse than the conditions in the Phoenix office.

Moderators were required to sign non-disclosure agreements with Cognizant to obtain the job, although three former workers broke the agreements to provide information to &quot;The Verge&quot;. In the Tampa office, workers reported inadequate mental health resources. As a result of exposure to videos depicting graphic violence, animal abuse, and child sexual abuse, some employees developed psychological trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder. In response to negative coverage related to its content moderation contracts, a Facebook director indicated that Facebook is in the process of developing a &quot;global resiliency team&quot; that would assist its contractors.

===Facebook===

Facebook had increased the number of content moderators from 4,500 to 7,500 in 2017 due to legal requirements and other controversies. In Germany, Facebook was responsible for removing hate speech within 24 hours of when it was posted. In late 2018, Facebook created an oversight board or an internal &quot;Supreme Court&quot; to decide what content remains and what content is removed.

According to Frances Haugen, the number of Facebook employees responsible for content moderation was much smaller as of 2021.

===Twitter===
Social media site Twitter has a suspension policy. Between August 2015 and December 2017, it suspended over 1.2 million accounts for terrorist content to reduce the number of followers and amount of content associated with the Islamic State. Following the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk in October 2022, content rules have been weakened across the platform in an attempt to prioritize free speech. However, the effects of this campaign have been called into question.

==Distributed moderation==

===User moderation===
User moderation allows any user to moderate any other user&#x27;s contributions. Billions of people are currently making decisions on what to share, forward or give visibility to on a daily basis. On a large site with a sufficiently large active population, this usually works well, since relatively small numbers of troublemakers are screened out by the votes of the rest of the community.

User moderation can also be characterized by reactive moderation. This type of moderation depends on users of a platform or site to report content that is inappropriate and breaches community standards. In this process, when users are faced with an image or video they deem unfit, they can click the report button. The complaint is filed and queued for moderators to look at.

== Unionization ==
150 content moderators, who contracted for Meta, ByteDance and OpenAI gathered in Nairobi, Kenya to launch the first African Content Moderators Union on 1 May 2023. This union was launched 4 years after Daniel Motaung was fired and retaliated against for organizing a union at Sama, which contracts for Facebook.

<text>Urban ecology is the scientific study of the relation of living organisms with each other and their surroundings in an urban environment. An urban environment refers to environments dominated by high-density residential and commercial buildings, paved surfaces, and other urban-related factors that create a unique landscape. The goal of urban ecology is to achieve a balance between human culture and the natural environment.

Urban ecology is a recent field of study compared to ecology. Currently, most of the information in this field is based on the easier to study species of mammals and birds [source needed]. To close the gap in knowledge, attention should be paid to all species in the urban space like insects and fish. This study should also expand to suburban spaces with its unique mix of development and surrounding nature. The methods and studies of urban ecology is a subset of ecology. The study of urban ecology carries increasing importance because more than 50% of the world&#x27;s population today lives in urban areas. It is also estimated that within the next 40 years, two-thirds of the world&#x27;s population will be living in expanding urban centers. The ecological processes in the urban environment are comparable to those outside the urban context. However, the types of urban habitats and the species that inhabit them are poorly documented which is why more research should be done in urban ecology.

== History ==

Historically, ecology has focused on natural environments, but by the 1970s many ecologists began to turn their interest towards ecological interactions taking place in and caused by urban environments. In the nineteenth century, naturalists such as Malthus, De Candolle, Lyell, and Darwin found that competition for resources was crucial in controlling population growth and is a driver of extinction. This concept was the basis of evolutionary ecology. Jean-Marie Pelt&#x27;s 1977 book &quot;The Re-Naturalized Human&quot;, Brian Davis&#x27; 1978 publication &quot;Urbanization and the diversity of insects&quot;, and Sukopp et al.&#x27;s 1979 article &quot;The soil, flora and vegetation of Berlin&#x27;s wastelands&quot; are some of the first publications to recognize the importance of urban ecology as a separate and distinct form of ecology the same way one might see landscape ecology as different from population ecology. Forman and Godron&#x27;s 1986 book &quot;Landscape Ecology&quot; first distinguished urban settings and landscapes from other landscapes by dividing all landscapes into five broad types. These types were divided by the intensity of human influence ranging from pristine natural environments to urban centers.

Early ecologists defined ecology as the study of organisms and their environment. As time progressed urban ecology was recognized as a diverse and complex concept which differs in application between North America and Europe. The European concept of urban ecology examines the biota of urban areas, the North American concept has traditionally examined the social sciences of the urban landscape, as well as the ecosystem fluxes and processes, and the Latin American concept examines the effect of human activity on the biodiversity and fluxes of urban ecosystems. A renaissance in the development of urban ecology occurred in the 1990s that was initiated by the US National Science in funding two urban long-term ecological research centers and this promoted the study of urban ecology.

The field of urban ecology is rapidly expanding, with an increasing number of dedicated research centers emerging. Among the pioneers are the Urban Ecology Research Laboratory (UERL) at the University of Washington, established in 2001, and the Urban Ecology Laboratory (LEU) at the Costa Rican Distance University, founded in 2008. The UERL in Washington specializes in analyzing urban landscape patterns, ecosystem functions, modeling land cover changes, and developing scenarios for urban adaptation within the state. In contrast, Costa Rica&#x27;s LEU holds distinction as the world&#x27;s first research center exclusively devoted to studying tropical urban ecosystems. Research conducted there spans various facets of urban ecology, including biodiversity, the impacts of climate change on cities and their surrounding areas (particularly tropical highlands), and the intricate interactions between human activities and urban environments.

== Methods ==

Since urban ecology is a subfield of ecology, many of the techniques are similar to that of ecology. Ecological study techniques have been developed over centuries, but many of the techniques use for urban ecology are more recently developed. Methods used for studying urban ecology involve chemical and biochemical techniques, temperature recording, heat mapping remote sensing, and long-term ecological research sites.

=== Chemical and biochemical techniques ===

Chemical techniques may be used to determine pollutant concentrations and their effects. Tests can be as simple as dipping a manufactured test strip, as in the case of pH testing, or be more complex, as in the case of examining the spatial and temporal variation of heavy metal contamination due to industrial runoff. In that particular study, livers of birds from many regions of the North Sea were ground up and mercury was extracted. Additionally, mercury bound in feathers was extracted from both live birds and from museum specimens to test for mercury levels across many decades. Through these two different measurements, researchers were able to make a complex picture of the spread of mercury due to industrial runoff both spatially and temporally.

Other chemical techniques include tests for nitrates, phosphates, sulfates, etc. which are commonly associated with urban pollutants such as fertilizer and industrial byproducts. These biochemical fluxes are studied in the atmosphere (e.g. greenhouse gases), aquatic ecosystems and soil nematodes. Broad reaching effects of these biochemical fluxes can be seen in various aspects of both the urban and surrounding rural ecosystems.

===Temperature data and heat mapping===

Temperature data can be used for various kinds of studies. An important aspect of temperature data is the ability to correlate temperature with various factors that may be affecting or occurring in the environment. Oftentimes, temperature data is collected long-term by the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), and made available to the scientific community through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Data can be overlaid with maps of terrain, urban features, and other spatial areas to create heat maps. These heat maps can be used to view trends and distribution over time and space.

=== Remote sensing ===
Remote sensing is the technique in which data is collected from distant locations through the use of satellite imaging, radar, and aerial photographs. In urban ecology, remote sensing is used to collect data about terrain, weather patterns, light, and vegetation. One application of remote sensing for urban ecology is to detect the productivity of an area by measuring the photosynthetic wavelengths of emitted light. Satellite images can also be used to detect differences in temperature and landscape diversity to detect the effects of urbanization.

=== LTERs and long-term data sets ===

Long-term ecological research (LTER) sites are research sites funded by the government that have collected reliable long-term data over an extended period of time in order to identify long-term climatic or ecological trends. These sites provide long-term temporal and spatial data such as average temperature, rainfall and other ecological processes. The main purpose of LTERs for urban ecologists is the collection of vast amounts of data over long periods of time. These long-term data sets can then be analyzed to find trends relating to the effects of the urban environment on various ecological processes, such as species diversity and abundance over time. Another example is the examination of temperature trends that are accompanied with the growth of urban centers. There are currently two active urban LTERs: Central Arizona-Phoenix (CAP), first launched in 1997 and housed at Arizona State University and Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Area (MSP). The Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) was originally funded in 1998 as an urban LTER but as is no longer funded by the National Science Foundation as of 2021.

== Urban effects on the environment ==

Humans are the driving force behind urban ecology and influence the environment in a variety of ways - urbanization being a key example. Urbanization is tied to social, economic and environmental processes. There are six core aspects: air pollution, ecosystems, land use, biogeochemical cycles, water pollution, solid waste management, and the climate. Urbanization was driven by migration into cities and the rapid environmental implications that came with it; increased carbon emissions, energy consumption, impaired ecology; all primarily negative. Despite the impacts, the perception of urbanization at present is shifting from challenges to solutions. Cities are home to an abundant amount of financially well-off, knowledgeable and innovative initiators who are increasing the involvement of science in urban policy processes and concepts. The intersection of the multiple processes/integrated systems approach which can easily emerge within a city, includes five characteristics that can emphasize this fundamental shift at a low cost. These solutions are integrated, comprehensive, multifunctional approaches that speak to the social, economic, and cultural contexts of cities. They take into account the chemical, biophysical, and ecological aspects that define urban systems, including lifestyle choices that are interlinked with the culture of a city. However, despite adapting the opportunities that a city can participate in, the results of the concepts that researchers have developed remains uncertain.

=== Modification of land and waterways ===

Humans place high demand on land not only to build urban centers, but also to build surrounding suburban areas for housing. Land is also allocated for agriculture to sustain the growing population of the city. Expanding cities and suburban areas necessitate corresponding deforestation to meet the land-use and resource requirements of urbanization. Key examples of this are Deforestation in the United States and Europe.

Along with manipulation of land to suit human needs, natural water resources such as rivers and streams are also modified in urban establishments. Modification can come in the form of dams, artificial canals, and even the reversal of rivers. Reversing the flow of the Chicago River is a major example of urban environmental modification. Urban areas in natural desert settings often bring in water from far areas to maintain the human population and will likely have effects on the local desert climate. Modification of aquatic systems in urban areas also results in decreased stream diversity and increased pollution.

=== Trade, shipping, and spread of invasive species ===

Both local shipping and long-distance trade are required to meet the resource demands important in maintaining urban areas. Carbon dioxide emissions from the transport of goods also contribute to accumulating greenhouse gasses and nutrient deposits in the soil and air of urban environments. In addition, shipping facilitates the unintentional spread of living organisms, and introduces them to environments that they would not naturally inhabit. Introduced or alien species are populations of organisms living in a range in which they did not naturally evolve due to intentional or inadvertent human activity. Increased transportation between urban centers furthers the incidental movement of animal and plant species. Alien species often have no natural predators and pose a substantial threat to the dynamics of existing ecological populations in the environment into which they are introduced. Invasive species are successful when they are able to have proliferate reproduction due to short life cycles, contain or adapt to have traits that suit the environment and appear in high densities. Such invasive species are numerous and include house sparrows, ring-necked pheasants, European starlings, brown rats, Asian carp, American bullfrogs, emerald ash borer, kudzu vines, and zebra mussels among numerous others, most notably domesticated animals. Brown rats are a highly invasive species in urban environments, and are commonly seen in the streets and subways of New York City, where they pose multiple negative effects to infrastructure, native species and human health. Brown rats carry several types of parasites and pathogens that can possibly infect humans and other animals. In New York City a genetic study exploring genome wide variation concluded that multiple rats were originally from Great Britain. In Australia, it has been found that removing Lantana (&quot;L. camara,&quot; an alien species) from urban green spaces can have negative impacts on bird diversity locally, as it provides refugia for species like the superb fairy (Malurus cyaneus) and silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), in the absence of native plant equivalents. Although, there seems to be a density threshold in which too much Lantana (thus homogeneity in vegetation cover) can lead to a decrease in bird species richness or abundance.

=== Effects of urban animals on humans ===

==== Positive effects ====
Some urban animals can have a positive impact on the lives of humans. Studies show that the presence of domestic animals can reduce stress, anxiety and loneliness. Additionally some urban animals act as predators to animals like insects, etc., that can be harmful to humans Also urban species can serve many more purposes including agriculture, transport, and protection.

==== Negative effects ====
Some urban species have a negative impact on humans. For example, pests&#x27; urine fecal matter, and skin fragments can spread germs if ingested by humans. Diseases caused by pests or insects can be fatal. They include: salmonella, meningitis, Weil&#x27;s disease, Lyme disease, etc. Some people are allergic to certain insects like bees, wasps and therefore being exposed to them will cause serious allergic responses (rashes for example).

According to Seth Magle, attacks from wildlife in an urban setting, while rare are detrimental to societal views on wildlife. Due to media coverage of these rare attacks, urban populations assume these interactions as more common than they really are which further affects the tolerance of urban wildlife.

=== Human effects on biogeochemical pathways ===

Urbanization results in a large demand for chemical use by industry, construction, agriculture, and energy providing services. Such demands have a substantial impact on biogeochemical cycles, resulting in phenomena such as acid rain, eutrophication, and global warming. Furthermore, natural biogeochemical cycles in the urban environment can be impeded due to impermeable surfaces that prevent nutrients from returning to the soil, water, and atmosphere.
Demand for fertilizers to meet agricultural needs exerted by expanding urban centers can alter chemical composition of soil. Such effects often result in abnormally high concentrations of compounds including sulfur, phosphorus, nitrogen, and heavy metals. In addition, nitrogen and phosphorus used in fertilizers have caused severe problems in the form of agricultural runoff, which alters the concentration of these compounds in local rivers and streams, often resulting in adverse effects on native species. A well-known effect of agricultural runoff is the phenomenon of eutrophication. When the fertilizer chemicals from agricultural runoff reach the ocean, an algal bloom results, then rapidly dies off. The dead algae biomass is decomposed by bacteria that also consume large quantities of oxygen, which they obtain from the water, creating a &quot;dead zone&quot; without oxygen for fish or other organisms. A classic example is the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico due to agricultural runoff into the Mississippi River.

Just as pollutants and alterations in the biogeochemical cycle alter river and ocean ecosystems, they exert likewise effects in the air. Some stems from the accumulation of chemicals and pollution and often manifests in urban settings, which has a great impact on local plants and animals. Because urban centers are often considered point sources for pollution, local plants have adapted to withstand such conditions.

== Urban effects on climate ==

Urban environments and outlying areas have been found to exhibit unique local temperatures, precipitation, and other characteristic activity due to a variety of factors such as pollution and altered geochemical cycles. Some examples of the urban effects on climate are urban heat island, oasis effect, greenhouse gases, and acid rain. This further stirs the debate as to whether urban areas should be considered a unique biome. Despite common trends among all urban centers, the surrounding local environment heavily influences much of the climate. One such example of regional differences can be seen through the urban heat island and oasis effect.

=== Urban heat island effect ===

The urban heat island is a phenomenon in which central regions of urban centers exhibit higher mean temperatures than surrounding urban areas. Much of this effect can be attributed to low city albedo, the reflecting power of a surface, and the increased surface area of buildings to absorb solar radiation. Concrete, cement, and metal surfaces in urban areas tend to absorb heat energy rather than reflect it, contributing to higher urban temperatures. Brazel et al. found that the urban heat island effect demonstrates a positive correlation with population density in the city of Baltimore. The heat island effect has corresponding ecological consequences on resident species. However, this effect has only been seen in temperate climates.

=== Greenhouse gases ===


Emissions of greenhouse gases allow humans to inhabit the earth because they capture heat from the sun to make the climate adequate. In 1896, Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius established that fossil fuels caused carbon dioxide emissions (the most abundant and harmful greenhouse gas) . In the 20th century, American climate scientist James E. Hansen concluded that Greenhouse effect is changing the climate for the worse.

Carbon dioxide is the most abundant greenhouse gas and accounts for 3/4 of emissions. It is emitted by burning coal, oil, gas, wood, and other organic material. Another greenhouse gas is methane. it can come from landfill, natural gases, and or petroleum industries. Nitrous oxide accounts for about 6% of the emissions, and can come from fertilizers, manure, burning of agricultural residues, and or fuel. Finally, fluorinated gases account for 2% of greenhouse gas emissions and can come from refrigerants, solvents, etc. The excessive emission of greenhouse gases is responsible for much of the harm that can be observed today including global warming, respiratory diseases due to pollution, extinction or migration of certain species, etc. These issues can be reduced if not resolved by eliminating the use of fossil fuels in favor of renewable energy sources.

=== Acid rain and pollution ===

Processes related to urban areas result in the emission of numerous pollutants, which change corresponding nutrient cycles of carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, and other elements. Ecosystems in and around the urban center are especially influenced by these point sources of pollution. High sulfur dioxide concentrations resulting from the industrial demands of urbanization cause rainwater to become more acidic. Such an effect has been found to have a significant influence on locally affected populations, especially in aquatic environments. Wastes from urban centers, especially large urban centers in developed nations, can drive biogeochemical cycles on a global scale.

===Urban environment as an anthropogenic biome ===

The urban environment has been classified as an anthropogenic biome, which is characterized by the predominance of certain species and climate trends such as urban heat island across many urban areas. Examples of species characteristic of many urban environments include, cats, dogs, mosquitoes, rats, flies, and pigeons, which are all generalists. Many of these are dependent on human activity and have adapted accordingly to the niche created by urban centers. However, the large number of wild species being discovered in urban areas around the world suggest that a bewildering diversity of life is able to call urban areas their home. The relationship between urbanisation and wildlife diversity may not be as straightforward as previously imagined. This change in imagination has been possible due to coverage of a much larger number of cities in varied parts of the world that now show that past trends and assumptions were largely due to a bias in coverage of cities in temperate, developed countries.

== Biodiversity and urbanization ==

Research in countries of temperate areas indicates that, on a small scale, urbanization often increases the biodiversity of non-native species while reducing that of native species. This normally results in an overall reduction in species richness and increase in total biomass and species abundance. Urbanization reduces diversity on a large scale in cities of developed countries, but in tropical and subtropical cities, despite the high human densities, can retain very high diversity if small patches of habitats are retained across the city. Even domestic urban and suburban properties near high density city centres can support well over a thousand macro-organism species, many of which are often native. These urban landscapes can also support many complex ecosystem interactions. However, urbanization disrupts many other species interactions that would occur in undeveloped natural habitat.

Urban stream syndrome is a consistently observed trait of urbanization characterized by high nutrient and contaminant concentration, altered stream morphology, increased dominance of dominant species, and decreased biodiversity The two primary causes of urban stream syndrome are storm water runoff and wastewater treatment plant effluent.

=== Changes in diversity ===

Diversity is normally reduced at intermediate-low levels of urbanization but is always reduced at high levels of urbanization. These effects have been observed in vertebrates and invertebrates while plant species tend to increase with intermediate-low levels of urbanization but these general trends do not apply to all organisms within those groups. For example, McKinney&#x27;s (2006) review did not include the effects of urbanization on fishes and of the 58 studies on invertebrates, 52 included insects while only 10 included spiders. There is also a geographical bias as most of the studies either took place in North America or Europe.

The effects of urbanization also depend on the type and range of resources used by the organism. Generalist species, those that use a wide range of resources and can thrive under a large range of living conditions, are likely to survive in uniform environments. Specialist species, those that use a narrow range of resources and can only cope with a narrow range of living conditions, are unlikely to cope with uniform environments. There will likely be a variable effect on these two groups of organisms as urbanization alters habitat uniformity. Endangered plant species have been reported to occur throughout a wide range of urban ecosystems, many of them being novel ecosystems.

A study of 463 bird species reported that urban species share dietary traits. Specifically, urban species were larger, consumed more vertebrates and carrion, and fed more frequently on the ground or aerially, and also had broader diets than non‐urban species.

=== Cause of diversity change ===

The urban environment can decrease diversity through habitat removal and species homogenization—the increasing similarity between two previously distinct biological communities. Habitat degradation and habitat fragmentation reduces the amount of suitable habitat by urban development and separates suitable patches by inhospitable terrain such as roads, neighborhoods, and open parks. Although this replacement of suitable habitat with unsuitable habitat will result in extinctions of native species, some shelter may be artificially created and promote the survival of non-native species (e.g. house sparrow and house mice nests). Urbanization promotes species homogenization through the extinction of native endemic species and the introduction of non-native species that already have a widespread abundance. Changes to the habitat may promote both the extinction of native endemic species and the introduction of non-native species. The effects of habitat change will likely be similar in all urban environments as urban environments are all built to cater to the needs of humans.

Wildlife in cities are more susceptible to suffering ill effects from exposure to toxicants (such as heavy metals and pesticides). In China, fish that were exposed to industrial wastewater had poorer body condition; being exposed to toxicants can increase susceptibility to infection. Humans have the potential to induce patchy food distribution, which can promote animal aggregation by attracting a high number of animals to common food sources; “this aggregation may increase the spread of parasites transmitted through close contact; parasite deposition on soil, water, or artificial feeders; and stress through inter‐ and intraspecific competition.” The results of a study performed by Maureen Murray (et al.), in which a phylogenetic meta-analysis of 516 comparisons of overall wildlife condition reported in 106 studies was performed, confirmed these results; “our meta‐analysis suggests an overall negative relationship between urbanization and wildlife health, mainly driven by considerably higher toxicant loads and greater parasite abundance, greater parasite diversity, and/or greater likelihood of infection by parasites transmitted through close contact.”

The urban environment can also increase diversity in a number of ways. Many foreign organisms are introduced and dispersed naturally or artificially in urban areas. Artificial introductions may be intentional, where organisms have some form of human use, or accidental, where organisms attach themselves to transportation vehicles. Humans provide food sources (e.g. birdfeeder seeds, trash, garden compost) and reduce the numbers of large natural predators in urban environments, allowing large populations to be supported where food and predation would normally limit the population size. There are a variety of different habitats available within the urban environment as a result of differences in land use allowing for more species to be supported than by more uniform habitats.

== Ways to improve urban ecology: civil engineering and sustainability ==

Cities should be planned and constructed in such a way that minimizes the urban effects on the surrounding environment (urban heat island, precipitation, etc.) as well as optimizing ecological activity. For example, increasing the albedo, or reflective power, of surfaces in urban areas, can minimize urban heat island, resulting in a lower magnitude of the urban heat island effect in urban areas. By minimizing these abnormal temperature trends and others, ecological activity would likely be improved in the urban setting.

=== Need for remediation ===
Urbanization has indeed had a profound effect on the environment, on both local and global scales. Difficulties in actively constructing habitat corridors and returning biogeochemical cycles to normal raise the question as to whether such goals are feasible. However, some groups are working to return areas of land affected by the urban landscape to a more natural state. This includes using landscape architecture to model natural systems and restore rivers to pre-urban states.

It is becoming increasingly critical that conservation action be enacted within urban landscapes. Space in cities is limited; urban infill threatens the existence of green spaces. Green spaces that are in close proximity to cities are also vulnerable to urban sprawl. It is common that urban development comes at the cost of valuable land that could host wildlife species. Natural and financial resources are limited; a larger focus must be placed on conservation opportunities that factor in feasibility and maximization of expected benefits. Since the securing of land as a protected area is a luxury that cannot be extensively implemented, alternative approaches must be explored in order to prevent mass extinction of species. Borgström et al. 2006 hold that urban ecosystems are especially prone to &quot;scale mismatch&quot; whereby the right course of action is heavily dependent on species size. For some species conservation can be achieved in a single isolated garden because their small size permits a large population, e.g. soil microorganisms. Meanwhile, that is the wrong scale for species that are more mobile and/or larger, e.g. pollinators and seed dispersers, which will require larger and/or connected spaces.

The need to pursue conservation outcomes in urban environments is most pronounced for species whose global distribution is contained within a human-modified landscape. The fact is that many threatened wildlife species are prevalent among land types that were not originally intended for conservation. Of Australia&#x27;s 39 urban-restricted threatened species, 11 species occur at roadsides, 10 species occur in private lands, 5 species occur in military lands, 4 species in schools, 4 species in golf courses, 4 species at utility easements (such as railways), 3 species at airports and 1 species at hospitals. The spiked rice flower species Pimelea spicata persists mainly at a golf course, while the guinea-flower hibbertia puberula glabrescens is known mainly from the grounds of an airport. Unconventional landscapes as such are the ones that must be prioritized. The goal in the management of these areas is to bring about a “win-win” situation where conservation efforts are practiced while not compromising the original use of the space. While being near to large human populations can pose risks to endangered species inhabiting urban environments, such closeness can prove to be an advantage as long as the human community is conscious and engaged in local conservation efforts.

=== Species reintroduction ===
Reintroduction of species to urban settings can help improve the local biodiversity previously lost; however the following guidelines should be followed in order to avoid undesired effects.

# No predators capable of killing children will be reintroduced to urban areas.
# There will be no introduction of species that significantly threaten human health, pets, crops or property.
# Reintroduction will not be done when it implies significant suffering to the organisms being reintroduced, for example stress from capture or captivity.
# Organisms that carry pathogens will not be reintroduced.
# Organisms whose genes threaten the genetic pool of other organisms in the urban area will not be reintroduced.
# Organisms will only be reintroduced when scientific data support a reasonable chance of long-term survival (if funds are insufficient for the long-term effort, reintroduction will not be attempted).
# Reintroduced organisms will receive food supplementation and veterinary assistance as needed.
# Reintroduction will be done in both experimental and control areas to produce reliable assessments (monitoring must continue afterwards to trigger interventions if necessary).
# Reintroduction must be done in several places and repeated over several years to buffer for stochastic events.
# People in the areas affected must participate in the decision process, and will receive education to make reintroduction sustainable (but final decisions must be based on objective information gathered according to scientific standards).

=== Sustainability ===
With the ever-increasing demands for resources necessitated by urbanization, recent campaigns to move toward sustainable energy and resource consumption, such as LEED certification of buildings, Energy Star certified appliances, and zero emission vehicles, have gained momentum. Sustainability reflects techniques and consumption ensuring reasonably low resource use as a component of urban ecology. Techniques such as carbon recapture may also be used to sequester carbon compounds produced in urban centers rather continually emitting more of the greenhouse gas. The use of other types of renewable energy like bioenergy, solar energy, geothermal energy, and wind energy would also help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

====Green Infrastructure Implementation====

Urban areas can be converted to areas that are more conducive to hosting wildlife through the application of green infrastructure. Although the opportunities of green infrastructure (GI) to benefit human populations have been recognized, there are also opportunities to conserve wildlife diversity. Green infrastructure has the potential to support wildlife robustness by providing a more suitable habitat than conventional, “grey” infrastructure as well as aid in stormwater management and air purification. GI can be defined as features that were engineered with natural elements or natural features. This natural constitution helps prevent wildlife exposure to man-made toxicants. Although research on the benefits of GI on biodiversity has increased exponentially in the last decade, these effects have rarely been quantified. In a study performed by Alessandro Filazzola (et al.), 1,883 published manuscripts were examined and meta-analyzed in reference to 33 relevant studies in order to determine the effect of GI on wildlife. Although there was variability in the findings, it was determined that the implementation of GI improved biodiversity compared to conventional infrastructure. In some cases, GI even preserved comparable measures of biodiversity to natural components.

=== Urban green space ===
A barrier associated with finding the right amount of urban green space is the variety of space needed by different species to complete their life cycles. This is also compounded with the man-made barriers neighboring green spaces that can restrict movement of certain species from other urban green spaces located nearby. 

Increasing Wildlife Habitat Connectivity

The implementation of wildlife corridors throughout urban areas (and in between wildlife areas) would promote wildlife habitat connectivity. Habitat connectivity is critical for ecosystem health and wildlife conservation yet is being compromised by increasing urbanization. Urban development has caused green spaces to become increasingly fragmented and has caused adverse effects in genetic variation within species, population abundance and species richness. Urban green spaces that are linked by ecosystem corridors have higher ecosystem health and resilience to global environmental change. Employment of corridors can form an ecosystem network that facilitates movement and dispersal. However, planning these networks requires a comprehensive spatial plan.

One approach is to target “shrinking” cities (such as Detroit, Michigan, USA) that have an abundance of vacant lots and land that could be repurposed into greenways to provide ecosystem services (although even cities with growing populations typically have vacant land as well). However, even cities with high vacancy rates sometimes can present social and environmental challenges. For instance, vacant land that stands on polluted soils may contain heavy metals or construction debris; this must be addressed before the repurposing. Once land has been repurposed for ecosystem services, avenues must be pursued that could allow this land to contribute to structural or functional connectivity.

Structural connectivity refers to parts of the landscape that are physically connected. Functional connectivity refers to species-specific tendencies that indicate interaction with other parts of the landscape. Throughout the City of Detroit, spatial patterns were detected that could promote structural connectivity. The research performed by Zhang “integrates landscape ecology and graph theory, spatial modeling, and landscape design to develop a methodology for planning multifunctional green infrastructure that fosters social-ecological sustainability and resilience”. Using a functional connectivity index, there was found to be a high correlation between these results (structural and functional connectivity), suggesting that the two metrics could be indicators of each other and could guide green space planning.

Although urban wildlife corridors could serve as a potential mitigation tool, it is important that they are constructed so as to facilitate wildlife movement without restriction. As humans may be perceived as a threat, the success of the corridors is dependent on human population density proximity to roads. In a study performed by Tempe Adams (et al.), remote-sensor camera traps and data from GPS collars were utilized to assess whether or not the African elephant would use narrow urban wildlife corridors. The study was performed in three different urban-dominated land use types (in Botswana, South Africa) over a span of two years.

The results of the study indicated that elephants tended to move through unprotected areas more quickly, spending less time in those areas. Using vehicular traffic as a measure of human activity, the study indicated that elephant presence was higher during times when human activity was at a minimum. It was determined that “formal protection and designation of urban corridors by the relevant governing bodies would facilitate coexistence between people and wildlife at small spatial scales.” However, the only way this co-existence could be feasible is by creating structural connectivity (and thus promoting functional connectivity) by implementing proper wildlife corridors that facilitate easy movement between habitat patches. The usage of green infrastructure that is connected to natural habitats has been shown to reap greater biodiversity benefits than GI implemented in areas far from natural habitats. GI close to natural areas may also increase functional connectivity in natural environments.

Roadkill Mitigation

In the United States, roadkill takes the lives of hundreds of thousands to hundreds of millions of mammals, birds and amphibians each year. Roadkill mortality has detrimental effects on the persistence probability, abundance and genetic diversity of wildlife populations (more so than reduced movement through habitat patches). Roadkill also has an effect on driver safety. If green areas cannot be reserved, the presence of wildlife habitats in close proximity to urban roads must be addressed. The optimal situation would be to avoid constructing roads next to these natural habitats, but other preventative measures can be pursued to reduce animal mortality. One way these effects could be mitigated is through implementation of wildlife fencing in prioritized areas. Many countries utilize underpasses and overpasses combined with wildlife fencing to reduce roadkill mortality in an attempt to restore habitat connectivity. It is unrealistic to try to fence entire road networks because of financial constraints. Therefore, areas in which the highest rates of mortality occur should be focused on.

=== Indigenous knowledge ===
Urban sprawl is one of many ways that Indigenous people&#x27;s land is taken and developed in cities of the global north, thus the intimate knowledge of the native area (ecology) is often lost due to the effects of colonization or because the land has been majorly altered. Urban development occurs around areas where Indigenous Peoples lived as these areas are easy for transport and the natural environmental is fruitful. When developing areas of urban land, consideration should go towards the intimate levels of knowledge held by Indigenous Peoples and the biocultural and linguistic diversity of the place. Urban ecology follows western science frameworks and compartmentalizes nature. Urban ecology has the opportunity to be viewed in an interconnected and holistic way, through &quot;Two-Eyed Seeing&quot; and be inclusive of the Traditional Ecological Knowledge held by the local Indigenous Peoples of the area.

Urban restoration ecology would be enriched by partnerships with the local Indigenous Peoples, if done in a respectful way that addresses the currently inequitable relationship. Non-indigenous people can support their local Indigenous communities by learning about the history of the land and ecosystems that is being restored or studied. Ecological restoration built with strong Indigenous partnerships benefits the Indigenous culture and identity, as well as all urban dwellers.

== Summary ==

Urbanization results in a series of both local and far-reaching effects on biodiversity, biogeochemical cycles, hydrology, and climate, among other stresses. Many of these effects are not fully understood, as urban ecology has only recently emerged as a scientific discipline and more research remains to be done. Research on cities outside the US and Europe remains limited. Observations on the impact of urbanization on biodiversity and species interactions are consistent across many studies but definitive mechanisms have yet to be established. Urban ecology constitutes an important and highly relevant subfield of ecology, and further study must be pursued to more fully understand the effects of human urban areas on the environment.

<doc id="295677" wikidata="Q1988011" url="?curid=295677" title="X-inefficiency">
<text>X-inefficiency is a concept used in economics to describe instances where firms go through internal inefficiency resulting in higher production costs than required for a given output. This inefficiency can result from various factors, such as outdated technology, inefficient production processes, poor management, and lack of competition, and it results in lower profits for the inefficient firm(s) and higher prices for consumers. The concept of X-inefficiency was introduced by Harvey Leibenstein.
in 1966, Harvard University Professor Harvey Leibenstein first introduced the concept of X-inefficiency in his paper &quot;Allocative Efficiency vs. X- Efficiency&quot;, which was published in &quot;American Economic Review&quot;. X-Inefficiency refers to a firm&#x27;s inability to fully utilize its resources, resulting in an output level that falls short of the maximum potential achievable given the resources and environment which is referred to as the efficiency frontier.

More so, X-inefficiency focuses on the importance of competition and innovation in promoting efficiency and reducing costs for firms, followed by higher profits and better output and prices for consumers.

X-inefficiency pin out irrational actions performed by firms in the market.

== Overview ==
The difference between the actual and minimum cost of production for a given output produces X-inefficiency.

Companies will incur X-Inefficiency as a result of lack of motivation to control its costs, which brings the average cost of production exceeds costs actually required for production. For example, the company have a potential potential cost curve. However, due to the lack incentive to motivate on control costs, the company&#x27;s actual cost curve is at a higher position compared to the potential cost curve.

The phenomenon of X-inefficiency is in relation to the allocation of effort, especially the managerial effort.

Mainstream economic theory tends to assume that the management of firms act to maximize profit by minimizing the inputs used to produce a given level of output.

Competition energizes firms to seek productive efficiency gains and produce at lowest unit costs or risk losing sales to more efficient rivals. With market forms other than perfect competition, such as monopoly, productive inefficiency can persist, because the lack of competition makes it possible to use inefficient production techniques and still stay in business. In addition to monopoly, sociologists have identified a number of ways in which markets may be organizationally embedded, and thus may depart in behavior from economic theory.

Organizational slack occurs when firms opt to employ more resources than are needed to produce a given level of output. Unused capacity results in X-inefficiency. Organizational slack can be explained by the principal-agent problem. In companies ownership and management are separate. Shareholders (the principal) elect directors (the agent) to act on their behalf and maximize shareholder value. Managers may take decisions that maximize their own and not shareholder objectives e.g. hiring extra staff to reduce manager workloads. This increases unit costs.

X-inefficiency only looks at the outputs that are produced with given inputs. It doesn&#x27;t take account of whether the inputs are the best ones to be using, or whether the outputs are the best ones to be producing. For example, a firm that employs brain surgeons to dig ditches might still be X-efficient, even though reallocating the brain surgeons to curing the sick would be more efficient for society overall. In this sense, X-inefficiency focuses on productive efficiency and minimising costs rather than allocative efficiency and maximising welfare. For more extensive discussions, see Sickles and Zelenyuk (2019, p. 1-8, 469) and references therein.

== Arguments about X-inefficiency ==
Based on the assumption that the non-trade output of the firm is zero, Leibenstein argues that the X-inefficiency results from the lack of motivation of the resource owners to produce less than the maximum technical output of the trade goods. Leibenstein also argued that sometimes firms are not maximising their profits because there may be a certain level of efficiency, considering the human element which introduced by Leibenstein

== Causes to X-inefficiency ==
Monopoly Effect - A monopoly is a price maker in that its choice of output level affects the price paid by consumers. Consequently, a monopoly tends to price at a point where price is greater than long-run average costs. X-inefficiency, however tends to increase average costs causing further divergence from the economically efficient outcome. The sources of X-inefficiency have been ascribed to things such as over investment and empire building by managers, lack of motivation stemming from a lack of competition, and pressure by labor unions to pay above-market wages.

Suggested by Bergsman, The sum of X-inefficiency and monopoly returns is much larger than costs of mis-allocation.

In reality, industries with strong monopoly capacity will be more restricted by legal regulations. These regulations can impose competitive pressure on companies and prevent the industry turning into a true monopoly. Meanwhile, these artificial pressure of regulations can induce competitive pressure to companies, thus improving X-inefficiency.

When a particular market lacks competition, companies that are monopoly would have incentive to increase their prices to in order to make super-profits. In addition, the low pressure from having no competition would lead to difficulty controlling costs resulting in potential inefficiencies. 

Government Effect - A state owned firm may not be operating to make profit, therefore it would have no incentive to cut costs.

Principal Agent Effect- Shareholders typically have a primary goal of maximizing profits and reducing costs, managers and employees may opt to have different priorities for example they may seek to keep costs low up to a point of maintaining job security, but allow costs to increase if it means improving the quality of their work experience.

Motivation Effect- Workers and managers may be demotivated to work diligently. This arises from various factors such as strained industrial relations, As a result employees may purposefully take extended breaks and not exert their best effort in order to increase profitability.

== Measurements of X-inefficiency ==

Cost Efficiency Analysis - To analyze the efficiency of firms or organizations in a particular industry or sector, a technique called cost frontier analysis is utilized. This involves approximating the minimum cost required to produce a specific level of output, which serves as the cost frontier. Companies that incur costs exceeding the frontier are deemed inefficient. Statistical methods are utilized in cost frontier analysis to estimate the frontier and gauge the extent of inefficiency within the firms. 

Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) - is a technique that does not rely on assumptions or preset parameters, and is used to assess the relative effectiveness of companies or groups. It evaluates how well firms use various inputs and outputs, and determines the highest level of efficiency attainable with the available resources. Ineffective firms are those that do not achieve this maximum level of efficiency. 

Stochastic frontier analysis: - is a method that requires the estimation of a production function that focuses the unpredictable fluctuations in both inputs and outputs. The resulting result is then utilized to determined the efficiency of individual firms. When using this approach, any company that operates below the estimated level of efficiency is considered inefficient. 

== Solutions of X-inefficiency ==
Government Regulation - Rules and regulations set by the government on firms can enhance market efficiency. Studies by Sappington and Stiglitz (1987) show that regulations can address market failures such as information asymmetry, externalities and natural monopolies thus reducing x-inefficiency. Removing Barriers to entry for new companies can force existing companies to operate more efficiently to stay competitive. 

Antitrust Laws - The main goal of antitrust laws is to foster competitions and hinder the establishment of monopolies. In their paper, Hovenkamp et al. (2011), examine the function of antitrust laws in advancing economic effectiveness through the deterrence of anti-competitive actions, including but not limited to, price-fixing, bid-rigging, and exclusive dealing. 

Some solutions to X-inefficiency include increasing competition in the market, implementing better management practices, and improving employee motivation and training. Implementing better management practices aid in the reducing x-inefficiency. For example lean management method concentrate on minimizing waste and increasing efficiency. Technology plays an important role in streamlining processes and lowering labor expense. 

Another Approach of minimizing x-inefficiency involves Management input. Enhancing employee motivation and training - to help employees acquire the expertise and knowledge for optimal performance, can lower wastage, improve efficiency and productivity. Companies could offer rewards and incentives to employees that bring new innovative manufacturing process aimed at boosting efficiency and reducing waste. 

== Conclusion ==
In conclusion, X-inefficiency refers to the inefficiencies within a company that result in higher production costs than necessary for a given output. These inefficiencies can stem from a variety of factors, including outdated technology, inefficient production processes, poor management, and a lack of competition. X-inefficiency underscores the importance of competition and innovation in fostering efficiency, which can reduce costs for companies, resulting in increased profits and better output and prices for consumers. However, X-inefficiency only focuses on productive efficiency and minimizing costs, not on allocative efficiency and maximizing welfare. Industries with strong monopolistic power, government-owned firms, and principal-agent problems are particularly prone to X-inefficiency. By addressing these underlying causes, firms can enhance efficiency and lower costs, which can benefit both the firm and the broader economy.

<text>Molybdenum disulfide (or moly) is an inorganic compound composed of molybdenum and sulfur. Its chemical formula is .

The compound is classified as a transition metal dichalcogenide. It is a silvery black solid that occurs as the mineral molybdenite, the principal ore for molybdenum. is relatively unreactive. It is unaffected by dilute acids and oxygen. In appearance and feel, molybdenum disulfide is similar to graphite. It is widely used as a dry lubricant because of its low friction and robustness. Bulk is a diamagnetic, indirect bandgap semiconductor similar to silicon, with a bandgap of 1.23 eV.

== Production ==
 is naturally found as either molybdenite, a crystalline mineral, or jordisite, a rare low temperature form of molybdenite. Molybdenite ore is processed by flotation to give relatively pure . The main contaminant is carbon. also arises by thermal treatment of virtually all molybdenum compounds with hydrogen sulfide or elemental sulfur and can be produced by metathesis reactions from molybdenum pentachloride.

== Structure and physical properties ==
=== Crystalline phases ===
All forms of have a layered structure, in which a plane of molybdenum atoms is sandwiched by planes of sulfide ions. These three strata form a monolayer of . Bulk consists of stacked monolayers, which are held together by weak van der Waals interactions.

Crystalline exists in one of two phases, 2H- and 3R-, where the &quot;H&quot; and the &quot;R&quot; indicate hexagonal and rhombohedral symmetry, respectively. In both of these structures, each molybdenum atom exists at the center of a trigonal prismatic coordination sphere and is covalently bonded to six sulfide ions. Each sulfur atom has pyramidal coordination and is bonded to three molybdenum atoms. Both the 2H- and 3R-phases are semiconducting.

A third, metastable crystalline phase known as 1T- was discovered by intercalating 2H- with alkali metals. This phase has trigonal symmetry and is metallic. The 1T-phase can be stabilized through doping with electron donors such as rhenium, or converted back to the 2H-phase by microwave radiation. The 2H/1T-phase transition can be controlled via the incorporation of sulfur (S) vacancies.

===Allotropes===
Nanotube-like and buckyball-like molecules composed of are known.

===Exfoliated flakes===
While bulk in the 2H-phase is known to be an indirect-band gap semiconductor, monolayer has a direct band gap. The layer-dependent optoelectronic properties of have promoted much research in 2-dimensional -based devices. 2D can be produced by exfoliating bulk crystals to produce single-layer to few-layer flakes either through a dry, micromechanical process or through solution processing.

Micromechanical exfoliation, also pragmatically called &quot;Scotch-tape exfoliation&quot;, involves using an adhesive material to repeatedly peel apart a layered crystal by overcoming the van der Waals forces. The crystal flakes can then be transferred from the adhesive film to a substrate. This facile method was first used by Konstantin Novoselov and Andre Geim to obtain graphene from graphite crystals. However, it can not be employed for a uniform 1-D layers because of weaker adhesion of to the substrate (either silicon, glass or quartz); the aforementioned scheme is good for graphene only. While Scotch tape is generally used as the adhesive tape, PDMS stamps can also satisfactorily cleave if it is important to avoid contaminating the flakes with residual adhesive.

Liquid-phase exfoliation can also be used to produce monolayer to multi-layer in solution. A few methods include lithium intercalation to delaminate the layers and sonication in a high-surface tension solvent.

=== Mechanical properties ===
 excels as a lubricating material (see below) due to its layered structure and low coefficient of friction. Interlayer sliding dissipates energy when a shear stress is applied to the material. Extensive work has been performed to characterize the coefficient of friction and shear strength of in various atmospheres. The shear strength of increases as the coefficient of friction increases. This property is called superlubricity. At ambient conditions, the coefficient of friction for was determined to be 0.150, with a corresponding estimated shear strength of 56.0 MPa. Direct methods of measuring the shear strength indicate that the value is closer to 25.3 MPa.

The wear resistance of in lubricating applications can be increased by doping with Cr. Microindentation experiments on nanopillars of Cr-doped found that the yield strength increased from an average of 821 MPa for pure (at 0% Cr) to 1017 MPa at 50% Cr. The increase in yield strength is accompanied by a change in the failure mode of the material. While the pure nanopillar fails through a plastic bending mechanism, brittle fracture modes become apparent as the material is loaded with increasing amounts of dopant.

The widely used method of micromechanical exfoliation has been carefully studied in to understand the mechanism of delamination in few-layer to multi-layer flakes. The exact mechanism of cleavage was found to be layer dependent. Flakes thinner than 5 layers undergo homogenous bending and rippling, while flakes around 10 layers thick delaminated through interlayer sliding. Flakes with more than 20 layers exhibited a kinking mechanism during micromechanical cleavage. The cleavage of these flakes was also determined to be reversible due to the nature of van der Waals bonding.

In recent years, has been utilized in flexible electronic applications, promoting more investigation into the elastic properties of this material. Nanoscopic bending tests using AFM cantilever tips were performed on micromechanically exfoliated flakes that were deposited on a holey substrate. The Young&#x27;s modulus of monolayer flakes was 270 GPa, while the thicker flakes were stiffer, with a Young&#x27;s modulus of 330 GPa. Molecular dynamic simulations found the in-plane Young&#x27;s modulus of to be 229 GPa, which matches the experimental results within error.

Bertolazzi and coworkers also characterized the failure modes of the suspended monolayer flakes. The strain at failure ranges from 6 to 11%. The average yield strength of monolayer is 23 GPa, which is close to the theoretical fracture strength for defect-free .

The band structure of is sensitive to strain.

== Chemical reactions ==
Molybdenum disulfide is stable in air and attacked only by aggressive reagents. It reacts with oxygen upon heating forming molybdenum trioxide:

Chlorine attacks molybdenum disulfide at elevated temperatures to form molybdenum pentachloride:

===Intercalation reactions===
Molybdenum disulfide is a host for formation of intercalation compounds. This behavior is relevant to its use as a cathode material in batteries. One example is a lithiated material, . With butyl lithium, the product is .

== Applications ==
=== Lubricant ===

Due to weak van der Waals interactions between the sheets of sulfide atoms, has a low coefficient of friction. in particle sizes in the range of 1–100 μm is a common dry lubricant. Few alternatives exist that confer high lubricity and stability at up to 350 °C in oxidizing environments. Sliding friction tests of using a pin on disc tester at low loads (0.1–2 N) give friction coefficient values of &lt;0.1.

 is often a component of blends and composites that require low friction. For example, it is added to graphite to improve sticking. A variety of oils and greases are used, because they retain their lubricity even in cases of almost complete oil loss, thus finding a use in critical applications such as aircraft engines. When added to plastics, forms a composite with improved strength as well as reduced friction. Polymers that may be filled with include nylon (trade name Nylatron), Teflon and Vespel. Self-lubricating composite coatings for high-temperature applications consist of molybdenum disulfide and titanium nitride, using chemical vapor deposition.

Examples of applications of -based lubricants include two-stroke engines (such as motorcycle engines), bicycle coaster brakes, automotive CV and universal joints, ski waxes and bullets.

Other layered inorganic materials that exhibit lubricating properties (collectively known as solid lubricants (or dry lubricants)) includes graphite, which requires volatile additives and hexagonal boron nitride.

=== Catalysis ===

 is employed as a cocatalyst for desulfurization in petrochemistry, for example, hydrodesulfurization. The effectiveness of the catalysts is enhanced by doping with small amounts of cobalt or nickel. The intimate mixture of these sulfides is supported on alumina. Such catalysts are generated in situ by treating molybdate/cobalt or nickel-impregnated alumina with or an equivalent reagent. Catalysis does not occur at the regular sheet-like regions of the crystallites, but instead at the edge of these planes.

 finds use as a hydrogenation catalyst for organic synthesis. As it is derived from a common transition metal, rather than a group 10 metal, is chosen when price or resistance to sulfur poisoning are of primary concern. is effective for the hydrogenation of nitro compounds to amines and can be used to produce secondary amines via reductive amination. The catalyst can also effect hydrogenolysis of organosulfur compounds, aldehydes, ketones, phenols and carboxylic acids to their respective alkanes. However, it suffers from low activity, often requiring hydrogen pressures above 96 MPa and temperatures above 185 °C.

== Research ==
 plays an important role in condensed matter physics research.

===Hydrogen evolution===
 and related molybdenum sulfides are efficient catalysts for hydrogen evolution, including the electrolysis of water; thus, are possibly useful to produce hydrogen for use in fuel cells.

=== Oxygen reduction and evolution ===
@Fe-&quot;N&quot;-C core/shell nanosphere with atomic Fe-doped surface and interface (/Fe-&quot;N&quot;-C) can be used as a used an electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER) bifunctionally because of reduced energy barrier due to Fe-N4 dopants and unique nature of /Fe-&quot;N&quot;-C interface. 

===Microelectronics===
As in graphene, the layered structures of and other transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit electronic and optical properties that can differ from those in bulk. Bulk has an indirect band gap of 1.2 eV, while monolayers have a direct 1.8 eV electronic bandgap, supporting switchable transistors and photodetectors.

 nanoflakes can be used for solution-processed fabrication of layered memristive and memcapacitive devices through engineering a / heterostructure sandwiched between silver electrodes. -based memristors are mechanically flexible, optically transparent and can be produced at low cost.

The sensitivity of a graphene field-effect transistor (FET) biosensor is fundamentally restricted by the zero band gap of graphene, which results in increased leakage and reduced sensitivity. In digital electronics, transistors control current flow throughout an integrated circuit and allow for amplification and switching. In biosensing, the physical gate is removed and the binding between embedded receptor molecules and the charged target biomolecules to which they are exposed modulates the current.

 has been investigated as a component of flexible circuits.

In 2017, a 115-transistor, 1-bit microprocessor implementation was fabricated using two-dimensional .

 has been used to create 2D 2-terminal memristors and 3-terminal memtransistors.

=== Valleytronics ===
Due to the lack of spatial inversion symmetry, odd-layer MoS2 is a promising material for valleytronics because both the CBM and VBM have two energy-degenerate valleys at the corners of the first Brillouin zone, providing an exciting opportunity to store the information of 0s and 1s at different discrete values of the crystal momentum. The Berry curvature is even under spatial inversion (P) and odd under time reversal (T), the valley Hall effect cannot survive when both P and T symmetries are present. To excite valley Hall effect in specific valleys, circularly polarized lights were used for breaking the T symmetry in atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides. In monolayer , the T and mirror symmetries lock the spin and valley indices of the sub-bands split by the spin-orbit couplings, both of which are flipped under T; the spin conservation suppresses the inter-valley scattering. Therefore, monolayer MoS2 have been deemed an ideal platform for realizing intrinsic valley Hall effect without extrinsic symmetry breaking.

=== Photonics and photovoltaics ===
 also possesses mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and can emit light, opening possible applications such as photodetectors. has been investigated as a component of photoelectrochemical (e.g. for photocatalytic hydrogen production) applications and for microelectronics applications.

===Superconductivity of monolayers===
Under an electric field monolayers have been found to superconduct at temperatures below 9.4 K.

<text>George Thomas Saimes (September 1, 1941 – March 8, 2013) was an American professional football player who was a defensive back for the Buffalo Bills of the American Football League (AFL). He played college football as a fullback for the Michigan State Spartans. He won AFL championships with the Bills in 1964 and 1965.

Saimes was born and died in Canton, Ohio. In 1964, he had a career-high six interceptions and earned the first of his five American Football League All-Star Game appearances. He made &quot;The Sporting News&quot; All-AFL Team in 1964, 1965 and 1967. Former Pro Football writer and president of the Pro Football Writers Association, Larry Felser, calls Saimes &quot;the finest open-field tackler in the league.&quot;

He achieved All-American Football League honors five times, and is a member of the American Football League All-Time Team, the Buffalo Bills&#x27; Wall of Fame, and the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame.

Saimes went on to be a professional football scout with the Blesto V Combine, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Washington Redskins, and the Houston Texans. Saimes died in Canton of leukemia on March 8, 2013.

<doc id="295688" wikidata="Q5353703" url="?curid=295688" title="Elbert Dubenion">
<text>Elbert Dubenion (February 16, 1933 – December 26, 2019) was an American football flanker who spent his entire nine-season professional career with the Buffalo Bills of the American Football League (AFL). He played college football for the Bluffton Beavers. 

Dubenion, the longest-tenured member of the team&#x27;s inaugural roster despite being 27 years old at the start of his professional career, is considered one of the best players in the team&#x27;s history and was an archetype of the AFL&#x27;s emphasis on speed and the long bomb, both of which were two of Dubenion&#x27;s greatest strengths and earned him the nickname &quot;Golden Wheels&quot;.

==Career==
Dubenion was drafted in the fourteenth round of the 1959 NFL draft by the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League. His relatively old age (26 at the time) and hailing from a smaller college meant that he was never considered a serious prospect, and the Browns released him prior to the start of the season.

Dubenion was among many AFL players from smaller and less renowned colleges that the league was signing in search of talent that the NFL had overlooked, and the Buffalo Bills signed him as a free agent. During his rookie season, one of his quarterbacks, Johnny Green, gave Dubenion a backhanded compliment regarding his speed and alleged inability to catch a football, noting that he had &quot;golden wheels.&quot; The nickname &quot;Golden Wheels&quot; stuck for the remainder of his career.

In his rookie season, Dubenion had seven touchdowns and 752 receiving yards on 42 receptions, averaging 17.9 yards per reception. He rushed 16 times for 94 yards and a touchdown, averaging 5.9 yards per rush. In 1961, facing tighter and deeper coverages, he upped his production as a runner, rushing for 173 yards and a touchdown on just 17 carries, averaging 10.2 yards per rush. He had 461 receiving yards and six touchdowns on 31 receptions, averaging 14.9 yards per reception.

In 1964, Dubenion had one of the most sensational seasons of any receiver in pro football history, scoring 10 touchdowns among his 42 receptions for 1,139 yards, while collecting 27.1 yards per reception; he also saw a steep drop in his use in the rushing game, carrying the ball only once for 20 yards. In nine seasons, he totalled 294 receptions for 5,294 yards and 35 TDs for a career average of 18.0 yards per reception, and rushed for 326 yards and three touchdowns on 46 carries, a career average of 7.1 yards per rush. When Wray Carlton was released by the Bills on September 2, 1968, it made Dubenion the last player from the Bills&#x27; original roster in 1960 to still be with the club.

Dubenion ranks seventh all-time in the AFL in receptions and reception yardage. He holds the record for the longest reception in AFL playoff history, a 93-yard touchdown reception from quarterback Daryle Lamonica against the Boston Patriots in the 1963 Eastern Division playoff.

According to Sports Reference, a player must have at least 8 career playoff receptions to qualify for the all-time NFL leaderboard for career yards per reception in the playoffs. Dubenion has exactly 8 receptions for 250 yards in the playoffs for an average of 31.3 yards per reception, more than any other player in the history of the NFL; the closest player to him is Jim Doran, who averaged 27.4 yards per reception, 3.9 fewer than Dubenion.

Dubenion was a 1993 inductee of the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame, and his number 44 is officially in &quot;reduced circulation&quot; on the Bills, meaning although it is not officially retired, the team usually does not allow players who are expected to make the team&#x27;s regular season roster to wear it. (This has not always been successful; Joe Andreessen unexpectedly made the Bills roster wearing the number 44 and currently wears the number as of 2024.)

==Death==
Dubenion died December 26, 2019, from complications related to Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<text>The  (), formerly known as the or as the &quot;Collège impérial&quot; founded in 1530 by François I, is a higher education and research establishment () in France. It is located in Paris near La Sorbonne. The has been considered to be France&#x27;s most prestigious research establishment. It is an associate member of PSL University.
Research and teaching are closely linked at the , whose ambition is to teach &quot;the knowledge that is being built up in all fields of literature, science and the arts&quot;. 

==Overview==
As of 2021, 21 Nobel Prize winners and 9 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with the Collège. It does not grant degrees. Each professor is required to give lectures where attendance is free and open to anyone. Professors, about 50 in number, are chosen by the professors themselves, from a variety of disciplines, in both science and the humanities. The motto of the Collège is &quot;Docet Omnia&quot;, Latin for &quot;It teaches everything&quot;; its goal is to &quot;teach science in the making&quot; and can be best summed up by Maurice Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s phrase: &quot;Not acquired truths, but the idea of freely-executed research&quot; which is inscribed in golden letters above the main hall. 
The Collège has research laboratories and one of the best research libraries of Europe, with sections focusing on history with rare books, humanities, social sciences and also chemistry and physics. 

As of June 2009, over 650 audio podcasts of lectures are available on iTunes. Some are also available in English and Chinese. Similarly, the &#x27;s website hosts several videos of classes.
The classes are followed by various students, from senior researchers to PhD or master&#x27;s students, or even undergraduates. Moreover, the &quot;leçons inaugurales&quot; (first lessons) are important events in Paris intellectual and social life and attract a very large public of curious Parisians.

== History ==
The Collège was established by King Francis I of France, modeled after the Collegium Trilingue in Louvain, at the urging of Guillaume Budé. Of humanist inspiration, the school was established as an alternative to the Sorbonne to promote such disciplines as Hebrew, Ancient Greek (the first teacher being the celebrated scholar Janus Lascaris) and Mathematics. Initially called , and later &quot;Collège des trois langues&quot; (Latin, ancient Greek and Hebrew), &quot;Collège national&quot;, and &quot;Collège impérial&quot;, it was named in 1870. In 2010, it became a founding associate of PSL Research University (a community of Parisian universities).

<text>Hal Barwood (born April 16, 1940) is an American screenwriter, film producer, film director, game designer, game producer, and novelist.

==Early life==
Barwood was born in Hanover, New Hampshire, where his father ran the local movie theater. Early on he was thrilled by &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot;, and later in school Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;. Both films possessed unique authorial personality and were important inspirations pointing him toward a filmmaking career. He studied art at Brown University and The Rhode Island School of Design; and later attended the University of Southern California&#x27;s School of Cinema-Television, where he met and became friends with Matthew Robbins, along with other film students such as Walter Murch, Robert Dalva, George Lucas and others who came to be known by some as The Dirty Dozen, and who went on to considerable success in the film industry.

==Career==
===Film work===
====1970s====
In 1965, as a student, Barwood wrote, directed, and produced the short animated film, &quot;A Child&#x27;s Introduction to the Cosmos&quot;, and in 1970, &quot;The Great Walled City of Xan&quot;. His first theatrical film work was briefly as an effects animator on George Lucas&#x27; debut feature film, the social science fiction film &quot;THX 1138&quot; starring Donald Pleasence and Robert Duvall. &quot;THX 1138&quot; was released in 1971, but it received mixed reviews from critics and became a box office bomb, although after Lucas&#x27; &quot;Star Wars&quot;, released in 1977, it became a cult classic.

Barwood&#x27;s career path opened up when he and Matthew Robbins were hired to write the screenplay for Steven Spielberg&#x27;s first theatrical feature film, the crime drama film &quot;The Sugarland Express&quot; starring Goldie Hawn, based on a real life incident about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby. &quot;The Sugarland Express&quot; was released in 1974 but fared poorly at the box office (as it received a limited release), although it won the award for Best Screenplay at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival. He and Robbins later wrote John Badham&#x27;s comedic sports film &quot;The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings&quot;, which was released in 1976 and received mixed to good reviews and a nomination for the American Film Institute&#x27;s 2008 AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 in the sports film category.

After &quot;Express&quot;, Robbins and Barwood wrote Joseph Sargent&#x27;s biographical war film &quot;MacArthur&quot;, starring Gregory Peck and based on the life of the General of the Army Douglas MacArthur. The film was released in 1977 with mixed reviews. The screenwriting pair&#x27;s next work with Spielberg was on his script of the science fiction film &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; after David Giler&#x27;s rewrite didn&#x27;t convince Spielberg. Barwood&#x27;s and Robbins&#x27; major contribution to the script was to suggest a kidnapped child as the story&#x27;s plot device. The two, under the orders of Spielberg, performed a convincing rewrite which impressed Spielberg. However, despite their contribution, neither Barwood nor Robbins were publicly credited for their work in the film, although they got a percentage and cameoed in the film itself as two World War II pilots. &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; was released in 1977 and became a critical and financial success, eventually grossing over $337 million worldwide. The next year, 1978, Robbins and Barwood wrote the adventure comedy film &quot;Corvette Summer&quot;, starring Mark Hamill. The film was released that year and received good reviews. In the 1970s, he also co-wrote an unproduced screenplay with Robbins called &quot;Home Free&quot;, for which Ralph McQuarrie was contracted to do a series of conceptual paintings.

====1980s====
After &quot;Close Encounters&quot;, Barwood and Robbins collaborated again for the fantasy film &quot;Dragonslayer&quot;, starring Peter MacNicol, which Barwood co-wrote and produced. &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; was released in 1981 and received good reviews and despite its mediocre box office performance, it has since become a cult classic.

Later, in 1984, Barwood made his theatrical feature film directorial debut with the science fiction-horror film &quot;Warning Sign&quot;, starring Sam Waterston. The film was released in 1985 and received negative reviews although its box office performance was not so bad.

===Video game work===
While working on &quot;Dragonslayer&quot;, Barwood realized that he wanted to make video games in order to pursue his second childhood passion. Prior to becoming a professional video game designer, Barwood had previously created two video games for the Apple II (which he wrote and designed), entitled &quot;Binary Gauge&quot; and &quot;Space Snatchers&quot;. The first was self-published while the other was never published. Both of these titles are still available for PC play from his website, finitearts.com.

====Work at LucasArts (1990–2003)====
He was hired as a script writer, producer and director for LucasArts. Following the success of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure&quot;, LucasArts initially wanted him to make a video game adaptation of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Monkey King&quot;, an unproduced script written by Chris Columbus during the early development of the third film, but Barwood considered the idea &quot;substandard&quot;, so he convinced the staff to make an original story. Along with Noah Falstein, Barwood and the LucasArts staff ended up creating the 1992 adventure game &quot;Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis&quot;, which was a success. In the game, Indiana Jones and his sidekick Sophia Hapgood travel around the world in order to find the legendary lost city of Atlantis before the Nazis can find it.

Due to the successful reception of &quot;Fate of Atlantis&quot;, Barwood helped Joe Pinney, Bill Stoneham, and Aric Wilmunder conceive a sequel to &quot;Fate&quot; entitled &quot;Indiana Jones and the Iron Phoenix&quot;, in which after World War II, Indiana Jones would need to defeat Neo-Nazis in order to prevent Adolf Hitler&#x27;s resurrection in Bolivia with the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone. However, the title was cancelled after LucasArts became aware that with how the story dealt with Neo-Nazism would affect the game&#x27;s sales in Germany, which was an important overseas market for adventure games at that time. Still wanting to do one more Indiana Jones graphic adventure, Wilmunder wanted to do one entitled &quot;Indiana Jones and the Spear of Destiny&quot;, but it was also scrapped. Despite this, both the &quot;Iron Phoenix&quot; and the &quot;Spear of Destiny&quot; stories were later adapted into four-part comic books by Dark Horse Comics.

In 1995, Barwood worked on &quot;Big Sky Trooper&quot; and directed the live-action sequences of &quot;Star Wars: Rebel Assault II: The Hidden Empire&quot;, both released that same year and receiving mixed reviews. He later went to work in desktops games, &quot;Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Yoda Stories&quot;, released in 1996 and 1997 respectively. Both, casual games before there was such a category, were successful. After &quot;Yoda Stories&quot;, Barwood returned to make another &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; game. His original idea was to use the Roswell UFO incident as the story&#x27;s plot device, but George Lucas prevented him from doing this, so he opted to make a new story. The game became &quot;Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine&quot;, in which Indiana Jones, along with Sophia Hapgood, want to find the Infernal Machine, a mythological Babylonian power source, before the Soviets could do it. &quot;Infernal Machine&quot;, as being the series&#x27; first 3D installment video game, was released in 1999 and became a success like &quot;Fate of Atlantis&quot;. That same year, in August, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; magazine designated Barwood as one of the top 25 game designers in the United States.

Following the release of &quot;Infernal Machine&quot;, Barwood designed and presided over the development of &quot;RTX Red Rock&quot; and helped revise the story of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Emperor&#x27;s Tomb&quot;, another &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; video game; it involves Indiana Jones searching the tomb of the Chinese emperor Qin Shi Huang before the Nazis and a Chinese Triad can find it. Both &quot;Red Rock&quot; and &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Tomb&quot; were released in 2003, the former with negative reviews and the latter to critical acclaim. After the release of &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Tomb&quot;, Barwood retired from making video games for LucasArts, although eight years later, he briefly returned in 2011 to work in cooperation with Zynga in the Facebook online video game &quot;Indiana Jones Adventure World&quot;, which was discontinued in 2012.

====Finite Arts, Freelancing, and later games (2003–2011)====
Following his departure from LucasArts in 2003, Barwood repurposed his former movie company, Finite Arts, to service his freelance projects. Among these were the PC games &quot;Phlinx to go&quot; and &quot;Zengems&quot;, released in 2005 and 2007. Both were well received.

In 2008–2009, Barwood served as the lead designer and writer on &quot;Mata Hari&quot;, a World War I spy action adventure game developed by German studio Cranberry Production. It received positive reviews. Also, in 2009, Barwood wrote parts of &quot;Mobster 2: Vendetta&quot;, the second installment of the &quot;Mobsters&quot; video game franchise which was released that same year.

=== Future projects ===
On April 3, 2017, during an interview with Arcade Attack, Barwood stated that although he liked very much working on &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; video games, he had no desire to make any new titles. However, he stated that he had finished his fourth novel and is currently writing his fifth novel, entitled &quot;Happenstance&quot;.

==Personal life==
Barwood lives and works in Portland, Oregon. He was married to his childhood sweetheart, Barbara Ward, a teacher and literacy program director, until she died in 2023.

<text>A back-to-the-land movement is any of various agrarian movements across different historical periods. The common thread is a call for people to take up smallholding and to grow food from the land with an emphasis on a greater degree of self-sufficiency, autonomy, and local community than found in a prevailing industrial or postindustrial way of life. There have been a variety of motives behind such movements, such as social reform, land reform, and civilian war efforts. Groups involved have included political reformers, counterculture hippies, and religious separatists.

The concept was popularized in the United States at the beginning of the 20th century by activist Bolton Hall, who set up vacant lot farming in New York City and wrote many books on the subject; and by his follower Ralph Borsodi, who is known for his practical experiments in self-sufficient living during the 1920s and 1930s. The practice, however, was strong in Europe even before that time.

During World War II, when Great Britain faced a blockade by German U-boats, a &quot;Dig for Victory&quot; campaign urged civilians to fight food shortages by growing vegetables on any available patch of land. In the USA between the mid-1960s and mid-1970s there was a revived back-to-the-land movement, with substantial numbers of people migrating from cities to rural areas.

The back-to-the-land movement has ideological links to distributism, a 1920s and 1930s attempt to find a &quot;Third Way&quot; between capitalism and socialism.

== Throughout history ==
The American social commentator and poet Gary Snyder has related that there have been back-to-the-land population movements throughout the centuries, and throughout the world, largely due to the occurrence of severe urban problems where people felt a need to live a better life and/or often simply to survive.

The historian and philosopher of urbanism Jane Jacobs remarked in an interview with Stewart Brand that with the Fall of Rome city dwellers re-inhabited the rural areas of the region.

From another point of departure, Yi-Fu Tuan takes a view that such trends have often been privileged and motivated by sentiment. &quot;Awareness of the past is an important element in the love of place,&quot; he writes, in his 1974 book &quot;Topophilia&quot;. Tuan writes that an appreciation of nature springs from wealth, privilege, and the antithetical values of cities. He argues that literature about land (and, subsequently, about going back to the land) is largely sentimental; &quot;little,&quot; he writes, &quot;is known about the farmer&#x27;s attitudes to nature...&quot; Tuan finds historical instances of the desire of the civilized to escape civilization in the Hellenistic, Roman, Augustan, and Romantic eras, and, from one of the earliest recorded myths, the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;.

==North America ==
Regarding North America, many individuals and households have moved from urban or suburban circumstances to rural ones at different times; for instance, the economic theorist and land-based American experimenter Ralph Borsodi (author of &quot;Flight from the City&quot;) is said to have influenced thousands of urban-living people to try a modern homesteading life during the Great Depression. The New Deal town of Arthurdale, West Virginia, was built in 1933 using the back-to-the-land ideas current at the time.

After World War II, there was again a fair degree of interest in moving to rural land. In 1947, Betty MacDonald published what became a popular book, &quot;The Egg and I&quot;, telling her story of marrying and then moving to a small farm on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state. This story was the basis of a successful comedy film starring Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray.

The Canadian writer Farley Mowat says that many returned veterans after World War II sought a meaningful life far from the ignobility of modern warfare, regarding his own experience as typical of the pattern. In Canada, those who sought a life completely outside the cities, suburbs, and towns frequently moved into semi-wilderness environs.

However, the later phenomenon of the 1960s and 1970s was especially significant because the rural relocation trend was sizable enough to be identified in the American demographic statistics.

The roots of this movement can perhaps be traced to some of Bradford Angier&#x27;s books, such as &quot;At Home in the Woods&quot; (1951) and &quot;We Like it Wild&quot; (1963), Louise Dickinson Rich&#x27;s &quot;We Took to the Woods&quot; (1942) and subsequent books, or perhaps even more compellingly to the 1954 publication of Helen and Scott Nearing&#x27;s book, &quot;Living the Good Life&quot;. This book chronicles the Nearings&#x27; move to an older house in a rural area of Vermont and their self-sufficient and simple lifestyle. In their initial move, the Nearings were driven by the circumstances of the Great Depression and influenced by earlier writers, particularly Henry David Thoreau. Their book was published six years after &quot;A Sand County Almanac&quot;, by the ecologist and environmental activist Aldo Leopold, was published in 1948. Influences aside, the Nearings had planned and worked hard, developing their homestead and life according to a twelve-point plan they had drafted.

The narrative of Phil Cousineau&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Ecological Design: Inventing the Future&quot; asserts that in the decades after World War II, &quot;The world was forced to confront the dark shadow of science and industry... There was a clarion call for a return to a life of human scale.&quot; By the late 1960s, many people had recognized that, leaving their city or suburban lives, they completely lacked any familiarity with such basics of life as food sources (for instance, what a potato plant looks like, or the act of milking a cow)—and they felt out of touch with nature, in general. While the back-to-the-land movement was not strictly part of the counterculture of the 1960s, the two movements had some overlap in participation.

Many people were attracted to getting more in touch with the basics mentioned. Still, the movement could also have been fueled by the negatives of modern life: rampant consumerism, the failings of government and society, including the Vietnam War, and a perceived general urban deterioration, including growing public concern about air and water pollution. Events such as the Watergate scandal and the 1973 energy crisis contributed to these views. Some people rejected the struggle and boredom of &quot;moving up the company ladder.&quot; Paralleling the desire for reconnection with nature was a desire to reconnect with physical work. Farmer and author Gene Logsdon expressed the aim aptly as: &quot;the kind of independence that defines success in terms of how much food, clothing, shelter, and contentment I could produce for myself rather than how much I could &quot;buy&quot;.&quot;

There was also a segment within the movement who were familiar with rural life and farming, had skills, and wanted land of their own on which they could demonstrate that organic farming could be made practical and economically successful.

Besides the Nearings and other authors writing later along similar lines, another influence from the world of American publishing was the &quot;Whole Earth Catalogs&quot;. Stewart Brand and a circle of friends and family began the effort in 1968 because Brand believed that there was a groundswell of biologists, designers, engineers, sociologists, organic farmers, and social experimenters who wished to transform civilization along lines that might be called &quot;sustainable&quot;. Brand and cohorts created a catalog of &quot;tools&quot;—defined broadly to include useful books, design aids, maps, gardening implements, carpentry and masonry tools, metalworking equipment, and more.

Another important publication was &quot;The Mother Earth News&quot;, a periodical (originally on newsprint) that was founded a couple years after the &quot;Catalog&quot;. Ultimately gaining a large circulation, the magazine was focused on how-to articles, personal stories of successful and budding homesteaders, interviews with key thinkers, and the like. The magazine stated its philosophy was based on returning to people a greater measure of control of their own lives.

Many of the North American back-to-the-landers of the 1960s and 1970s used the &quot;Mother Earth News,&quot; the &quot;Whole Earth Catalogs,&quot; and derivative publications. But as time went on, the movement drew more people into it, more or less independently of impetus from the publishing world.

<text>Johann Nepomuk Hummel (14 November 177817 October 1837) was an Austrian composer and virtuoso pianist. His music reflects the transition from the Classical to the Romantic musical era. He was a pupil of Mozart, Salieri and Haydn. Hummel significantly influenced later piano music of the 19th century, particularly in the works of Chopin, Liszt and Mendelssohn.

== Life ==
===Early life===

Hummel was born in Pressburg, Kingdom of Hungary (now Bratislava, Slovakia). Unusually for that period, he was an only child. He was named after the Czech patron saint John of Nepomuk. His father, Johannes Hummel, was the director of the Imperial School of Military Music in Vienna; his mother, Margarethe Sommer Hummel, was the widow of the wigmaker Josef Ludwig. The couple married just four months beforehand.

Hummel was a child prodigy. At the age of eight, he was offered music lessons by the classical composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who was impressed with his ability. Hummel was taught and housed by Mozart for two years free of charge and made his first concert appearance at the age of nine at one of Mozart&#x27;s concerts.

Hummel&#x27;s father then took him on a European tour, arriving in London in 1790, where he received lessons from Muzio Clementi. He played to much acclaim at the Hanover Square Rooms, performing a Mozart piano concerto and a sonata of his own. In 1791, at the same venue, the thirteen-year-old Hummel premiered a piano trio by Haydn.

He returned to Vienna in 1793, giving concerts along his route. Upon his return, he was taught by Johann Georg Albrechtsberger, Joseph Haydn, and Antonio Salieri. At about this time, young Ludwig van Beethoven arrived in Vienna and also took lessons from Haydn and Albrechtsberger. The two men became friends, and Hummel took part in several performances of Beethoven&#x27;s orchestral work &quot;Wellingtons Sieg&quot;.

On the 16th of May 1813, he married the opera singer Elisabeth Röckel. The following year, at her request, was spent touring Russia and the rest of Europe. The couple had two sons. The younger, Carl (1821–1907), became a well-known landscape painter. The older, , worked as pianist, conductor and composer; he moved to the U.S. and died in Troy, New York.

Hummel visited Beethoven in Vienna on several occasions with his wife Elisabeth and pupil Ferdinand Hiller. Hummel would later perform at Beethoven&#x27;s memorial concert.

Hummel had also made friends with Franz Schubert, who dedicated his last three piano sonatas to Hummel. However, both men had died by the time of the sonatas&#x27; first publication, and the publishers changed the dedication to Robert Schumann.

===Career===

In 1804, Hummel became &quot;Konzertmeister&quot; to Nikolaus II, Prince Esterházy&#x27;s estate at Eisenstadt. Although he had taken over many of the duties of &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; because Haydn&#x27;s health did not permit him to perform them himself, he continued to be known simply as the &quot;Konzertmeister&quot; out of respect to Haydn, receiving the title of &quot;Kapellmeister&quot;, or music director, to the Eisenstadt court only after the older composer died in May 1809. He remained in the service of Prince Esterházy for seven years altogether before being dismissed in May 1811 for neglecting his duties.

Hummel later held the positions of &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; in Stuttgart from 1816 to 1818 and in Weimar from 1819 to 1837, where he formed a friendship with Goethe. Hummel brought one of the first musicians&#x27; pension schemes into existence, giving benefit concert tours to help raise funds. In his fight against unethical music publishers, Hummel was also a key figure in establishing the principles of intellectual property and copyright law.

In 1825, the Parisian music-publishing firm of Aristide Farrenc announced that it had acquired the French publishing rights for all future works by Hummel. In 1830, Hummel gave three concerts in Paris; at one of them, a rondo by Hummel was performed by Aristide Farrenc&#x27;s wife, the composer Louise Farrenc, who also &quot;sought Hummel&#x27;s comments on her keyboard technique.&quot;

In 1832, at the age of 54 and in failing health, Hummel began to devote less energy to his duties as music director at Weimar. In addition, after Goethe&#x27;s death in March 1832 he had less contact with local theatrical circles and as a result was in partial retirement from 1832 until his death in 1837.

=== Last years and legacy ===

At the end of his life, Hummel saw the rise of a new school of young composers and virtuosi, and found his own music slowly going out of fashion. His disciplined and clean Clementi-style technique, and his balanced classicism, opposed him to the rising school of tempestuous bravura displayed by the likes of Liszt. Composing less and less, but still highly respected and admired, Hummel died peacefully in Weimar in 1837. Like Haydn, Mozart and some other notable composers of the time, Hummel was a freemason. Hummel bequeathed a considerable portion of his famous garden behind his Weimar residence to his masonic lodge. His grave is in the Historical Cemetery, Weimar.

Although Hummel died famous, with a lasting posthumous reputation apparently secure, he and his music were quickly forgotten at the onrush of the Romantic period, perhaps because his classical ideas were seen as old-fashioned. Later, during the classical revival of the early 20th century, Hummel was passed over. Like Franz Joseph Haydn, whose musical revival had to wait until the second half of the 20th century, Hummel was overshadowed by Mozart and especially Beethoven. Due to an increasing number of recordings and live performances, his music has become reestablished in the classical repertoire.

Notable students include Ferdinand Hiller and Alexander Müller.

== Music ==
Hummel&#x27;s music took a different direction from that of Beethoven. Looking forward, Hummel stepped into modernity through pieces like his Piano Sonata in F-sharp minor, Op. 81, cherished by Robert Schumann, and his Fantasy, Op. 18, which would have a major influence for Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Wanderer Fantasy&quot;, for piano. These pieces are examples where Hummel may be seen to both challenge the classical harmonic structures and stretch the sonata form.

His main is for the piano, on which instrument he was one of the great virtuosi of his day. He wrote eight piano concertos, a double concerto for violin and piano, ten piano sonatas, eight piano trios, a piano quartet, two piano septets, a piano quintet and four hand piano music.

Aside from the piano, Hummel wrote a wind octet, a cello sonata, a mandolin concerto, a mandolin sonata, a Trumpet Concerto in E major written for the keyed trumpet (usually heard now in E-flat major – better suited to modern trumpets), a &quot;Grand Bassoon Concerto&quot; in F, a quartet for clarinet, violin, viola, and cello, 22 operas and Singspiels, masses and more. He also wrote a variation on a theme supplied by Anton Diabelli for part 2 of &quot;Vaterländischer Künstlerverein&quot;.

Hummel was also very interested in the guitar and talented with the instrument. He was prolific in his writing for it, beginning with opus 7 and finishing with opus 93. Other guitar works include Opp. 43, 53, 62, 63, 66, 71 and 91, which are written for a mixture of instruments.

Hummel&#x27;s output is marked by the conspicuous lack of a symphony. Of his eight piano concertos the first two are early compositions (S. 4/WoO 24 and S. 5) and the later six were numbered and published with opus numbers (Opp. 36, 85, 89, 110, 113, and posth.)

== Influence ==

While in Germany, Hummel published &quot;A Complete Theoretical and Practical Course of Instruction on the Art of Playing the Piano Forte&quot; (&quot;Anweisung zum Pianofortespiel&quot;, 1828), which sold thousands of copies within days of its publication and brought about a new style of fingering and of playing ornaments.

Later 19th-century pianistic technique was influenced by Hummel, through his instruction of Carl Czerny who later taught Franz Liszt. Czerny had transferred to Hummel after studying three years with Beethoven. Liszt knew and admired Hummel and often performed his works, a particular favourite being the Septet Op. 74.

Hummel&#x27;s influence can also be seen in the early works of Felix Mendelssohn, Frédéric Chopin and Robert Schumann, and the shadow of Hummel&#x27;s Piano Concerto in B minor as well as his Piano Concerto in A minor can be particularly perceived in Chopin&#x27;s concertos. This is unsurprising, considering that Chopin must have heard Hummel on one of the latter&#x27;s concert tours to Poland and Russia, and that Chopin kept Hummel&#x27;s piano concertos in his active repertoire. Harold C. Schonberg, in &quot;The Great Pianists&quot;, writes &quot;...the openings of the Hummel A minor and Chopin E minor concertos are too close to be coincidental&quot;. In relation to Chopin&#x27;s Preludes, Op. 28, Schonberg says: &quot;It also is hard to escape the notion that Chopin was very familiar with Hummel&#x27;s now-forgotten Op. 67, composed in 1815 – a set of twenty-four preludes in all major and minor keys, starting with C major&quot;.

Schumann studied Hummel&#x27;s &quot;Anweisung zum Pianofortespiel&quot;, and considered becoming his pupil. Liszt&#x27;s father Adam refused to pay the high tuition fee Hummel was used to charging (thus Liszt ended up studying with Czerny). Czerny, Friedrich Silcher, Ferdinand Hiller, Sigismond Thalberg, and Adolf von Henselt were among Hummel&#x27;s most prominent students. He also briefly gave some lessons to Felix Mendelssohn.

According to Schubert&#x27;s friend Albert Stadler, Schubert&#x27;s Trout Quintet was modelled on an earlier Hummel work, the quintet version of his Septet in D minor for Flute, Oboe, Horn, Viola, Cello, Bass and Piano, Op. 74. It may also have been influenced by Hummel&#x27;s Quintet in E-flat, Op. 87 .

<text>Joseph Clifford Montana Jr. (born June 11, 1956) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 16 seasons, primarily with the San Francisco 49ers. Nicknamed &quot;Joe Cool&quot; and &quot;the Comeback Kid&quot;, Montana is widely regarded as one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time. After winning a national championship with the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, Montana began his NFL career in 1979 at San Francisco, where he played for the next 14 seasons. With the 49ers, Montana started and won four Super Bowls and was the first player to be named the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player (MVP) three times. He also holds Super Bowl career records for most passes without an interception (122 in four games) and the all-time highest passer rating of 127.8. In 1993, Montana was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs, where he played for his last two seasons and led the franchise to its first AFC Championship Game. Montana was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2000.

In 1986, Montana won the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award. In 1989 and again in 1990, Montana was named the NFL Most Valuable Player. Montana was elected to eight Pro Bowls as well as being voted first-team All-Pro in 1987, 1989, and 1990. Montana had the highest passer rating in the National Football Conference (NFC) five times (1981, 1984, 1985, 1987, and 1989), and in both 1987 and 1989, Montana had the highest passer rating in the NFL.

Among his career highlights, &quot;the Catch&quot; (the game-winning touchdown pass to Dwight Clark vs. Dallas in the 1981 NFC Championship Game) and a Super Bowl-winning 92-yard drive against the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl XXIII are staples of NFL highlight films.

The 49ers retired Montana&#x27;s No. 16 jersey number after the conclusion of his playing career. In 1994, Montana earned a spot on the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team; he is also a member of the NFL 1980s All-Decade Team. In 1999, editors at &quot;The Sporting News&quot; ranked Montana third on their list of &quot;Football&#x27;s 100 Greatest Players&quot;. Also in 1999, ESPN named Montana the 25th greatest athlete of the 20th century. In 2006, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; rated him the number-one clutch quarterback of all time.

==Early life==
Montana was born in New Eagle, Pennsylvania, a borough of Washington County located in the western portion of the state. He grew up in the city of Monongahela, a coal mining town south of Pittsburgh.

Montana&#x27;s family were Italian-American, the name Montana being an Americanized form of the surname Montani, which comes from Camonica Valley in northern Italy.
Montana expressed an early interest in sports, and his father first taught him the game of football. Montana started to play youth football when he was eight years old, aided in part by his father. Montana Sr. listed his son as a nine-year-old so that Montana could meet the league&#x27;s minimum age requirement.

During his formative years, Montana took an interest in baseball and basketball, in addition to football, with basketball being his favorite sport. Montana Sr. started a local basketball team that his son played on. The team practiced and played at the local armory and played their games in various regional tournaments.

Montana received his primary education at Waverly Elementary and his secondary education at Finleyville Junior High (now known as Finleyville Middle School) and Ringgold High School. While at Ringgold, Montana played football, baseball, and basketball. Montana showed potential as a basketball player and helped Ringgold win the 1973 WPIAL Class AAA boys&#x27; basketball championship while being named an all-state player. He was so good that during his senior year, North Carolina State offered Montana a basketball scholarship. Although Montana turned down the scholarship, he seriously considered NCSU because of a promise that he could play both basketball and football for the university.

Montana spent his first two years on the high school football team as a backup. As a junior, Montana earned the job as the Ringgold Rams&#x27; starting quarterback. Montana held the role for the final two years of his high school career; after his senior year, &quot;Parade&quot; named him to their All-American team.

During his junior year, in a game against Monessen High School, Montana completed 12 passes in 22 attempts, threw for 223 yards, and scored three passing touchdowns and one rushing touchdown. His performance garnered attention from college recruiters, particularly those from Notre Dame.

Notre Dame eventually offered Montana a scholarship, and he accepted it. One contributing factor in Montana&#x27;s choice of colleges was that Terry Hanratty, his boyhood idol, attended Notre Dame.

In 2006, 32 years after Montana graduated, Ringgold High School renamed their football stadium &quot;Joe Montana Stadium&quot;.

==College career==

===1974===
When Montana arrived at Notre Dame in the fall of 1974, the football program was coached by Ara Parseghian. During Parseghian&#x27;s tenure, Notre Dame won the NCAA national championship in 1966 and 1973. Parseghian&#x27;s success as a coach helped him recruit highly talented players. Though Montana was a top prospect, under Notre Dame policy in 1974 freshmen were not permitted to practice with or play on the varsity team, and consequently Montana appeared only in a few freshman team games. Montana&#x27;s first significant contributions to the Notre Dame football team came during his sophomore year.

On December 15, 1974, Parseghian resigned due to health problems. The university hired Dan Devine to replace Parseghian. Despite his limited playing time the previous year, Montana performed well during the 1975 spring practice. Devine was so impressed that he later told his wife: &quot;I&#x27;m gonna start Joe Montana in the final spring game.&quot; When she replied, &quot;Who&#x27;s Joe Montana?&quot;, Devine said: &quot;He&#x27;s the guy who&#x27;s going to feed our family for the next few years.&quot;

===1975===
Devine did not feel Montana was ready to be the full-time starter in 1975; however, Montana played a key role in Notre Dame&#x27;s victory over North Carolina. During the game, played in Chapel Hill, Montana came in with 5:11 left to play. At the time, North Carolina led by a score of 14–6. Montana spent one minute and two seconds of game time on the field. In that time, he had 129 passing yards and Notre Dame won the game, 21–14.

Against Air Force, Notre Dame&#x27;s next opponent, Montana again entered the game in the fourth quarter. Although Air Force led 30–10, Notre Dame won the game, 31–30. After the win against North Carolina, Devine said that Moose Krause, the Notre Dame athletic director, said that the game was the &quot;greatest comeback I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. After the game against Air Force, Krause was quoted as saying: &quot;This one&#x27;s better than last week.&quot; In those two games, Montana demonstrated his ability to perform well in high-pressure circumstances. That characteristic would prove valuable, and Montana relied on it throughout his football career.

===1976===
Before the start of the 1976 season, Montana separated his shoulder and was unable to compete that year. He applied for and was granted a medical redshirt waiver, earning him one more year of eligibility than other members of his scholarship class.

===1977===
When the 1977 season began, Montana was the third quarterback listed on the team&#x27;s depth chart, behind Rusty Lisch and Gary Forystek. Notre Dame won their season opener and then lost to Ole Miss by a score of 20–13. Montana did not appear in either of those games. In their third game of the season, Notre Dame played Purdue. Lisch started and was then replaced by Forystek. On one play, Forystek suffered a broken vertebra, a broken clavicle, and a severe concussion. It was the last play of Forystek&#x27;s sports career.

Devine re-inserted Lisch into the game before Montana finally had the opportunity to play. Montana entered with approximately 11 minutes remaining and Purdue leading 24–14; he threw for 154 yards and one touchdown, and Notre Dame won the game, 31–24.

After the game, Devine made Montana the first quarterback on the depth chart and the team won their remaining nine games. In their final game of the season, Notre Dame defeated top-ranked Texas by a score of 38–10 in the Cotton Bowl. Notre Dame&#x27;s record of eleven wins and one loss earned them the AP/Coaches national title, the only title the school won while Devine was head coach.

===1978===
As a fifth-year senior in 1978, Montana helped Notre Dame to a come-from-behind win against the Pitt Panthers and nearly repeated the feat against USC, Notre Dame&#x27;s primary rival. The Fighting Irish were trailing 24–6 in the second half when Montana led a fourth-quarter rally to put Notre Dame ahead 25–24 with 45 seconds remaining, only to see the Trojans win on a last-second field goal.

On January 1, 1979, Notre Dame returned to the Cotton Bowl, this time against Houston. Montana&#x27;s performance in what came to be known as the &quot;Chicken Soup Game&quot; is one of the most celebrated of his entire football career. In frigid, blustery conditions in the second quarter, Montana had to fight off hypothermia as his body temperature dropped to . When the second half began with Houston up 20–12, Montana stayed in the locker room, where Notre Dame medical staff gave him warmed intravenous fluids, covered him in blankets, and fed him chicken soup. Montana returned to the field late in the third quarter with Houston leading 34–12. Montana led the Irish to three touchdowns in the last eight minutes of the game, the final one coming as time expired, and Notre Dame won the game 35–34. To commemorate the game, Notre Dame produced a promotional film titled &quot;Seven and a Half Minutes to Destiny&quot;, which Coach Devine later referred to as a &quot;Joe Montana film&quot;.

===Graduation and the NFL draft===
Montana graduated from Notre Dame with a degree in business administration and marketing. Although the NFL Combine was not formed until 1982, NFL scouts still evaluated potential draftees through the use of combines in 1979. Candidates were rated in a number of categories on a scale of one to nine, with one being the worst mark and nine being the best mark. The categories they used were contingent on the position that the athlete played.

Despite his performance on the field, Montana was not rated highly by most scouts. At one combine, Montana rated out as six-and-a-half overall with a six in arm strength, used to judge how hard and how far a prospect could throw the ball. By comparison, Jack Thompson of Washington State rated an eight, the highest grade among eligible quarterbacks.

In the 1979 NFL draft, the San Francisco 49ers selected Montana at the end of the third round with the 82nd overall pick. Montana was the fourth quarterback taken, behind Thompson, Phil Simms, and Steve Fuller, all selected in the first round.

==Professional career==

===San Francisco 49ers===

==== 1979–1980 ====
Although Montana appeared in all 16 regular season games during the 1979 season, he only threw 23 passes. He spent most of the season as the backup on the San Francisco depth chart behind starter Steve DeBerg. Montana became the starting quarterback midway through the 1980 season.

On December 7, 1980, San Francisco hosted the winless New Orleans Saints. The Saints took a 35–7 lead at halftime. At the start of the fourth quarter, New Orleans still led by a score of 35–21, but San Francisco tied the game by the end of regulation play. In overtime, Ray Wersching kicked a field goal to win the game for San Francisco, 38–35. This marked the first fourth quarter comeback victory in Montana&#x27;s NFL career. During his sixteen seasons in the NFL, this happened a total of 31 times with Montana at quarterback, 26 of those coming as a 49er.

Though San Francisco finished 1980 with a record of 6–10, Montana passed for 1,795 yards and 15 touchdown passes against nine interceptions. He also completed 64.5 percent of his passes, which led the league.

==== 1981–1983 ====
Montana began the 1981 season as San Francisco&#x27;s starting quarterback. The season ended up as one of the franchise&#x27;s most successful to that point. Backed in part by Montana&#x27;s strong performance, the team finished the regular season with a 13–3 record. Montana helped San Francisco win two of those games with fourth-quarter comebacks. The season was a precursor to one of Montana&#x27;s most memorable moments as a professional.
On January 10, 1982, San Francisco faced the Dallas Cowboys as three-point home underdogs at Candlestick Park in the NFC Championship Game. Dallas led 27–21 when San Francisco took possession with 4:54 left in regulation. The drive began on San Francisco&#x27;s 11-yard line. Behind six successful Montana completions and four running plays, San Francisco moved the ball to the Dallas 13-yard line. After one unsuccessful pass and then a seven-yard gain, San Francisco faced third down from the Dallas 6-yard line. Montana took the snap and ran to his right. He then made an off-balance pass toward the back of the end zone, and San Francisco wide receiver Dwight Clark made a leaping catch for the game-tying touchdown. With just 51 seconds left on the game clock, Wersching kicked the extra point and San Francisco won the game 28–27. The reception by Clark was coined simply &quot;The Catch&quot;, and it put San Francisco into Super Bowl XVI.

San Francisco faced the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl XVI. Montana completed 14 of 22 passes for 157 yards with one touchdown passing and one rushing touchdown. San Francisco won the game 26–21, and in recognition of his performance, Montana won the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award, which he accomplished two more times before he retired. The Super Bowl win also made Montana one of only two quarterbacks – along with his idol Joe Namath – to win a college national championship and a Super Bowl. Montana, at 25 years, 227 days, was one day older than Namath was at the time of his first Super Bowl, making him the second-youngest quarterback to start a Super Bowl up to that time.

Montana had a prolific season in 1982. However, the regular season was shortened to nine games when members of the Player&#x27;s Association went on strike. Although San Francisco failed to make the playoffs, Montana threw for 2,613 yards and 17 touchdowns during the year. He also set what was then an NFL record with five consecutive 300-yard passing games. Because the 49ers missed the playoffs, the team seriously considered trading him to the Baltimore Colts for the rights to the first overall pick in the 1983 NFL draft (and thus, the right to draft Stanford quarterback John Elway), but the 49ers reconsidered and ultimately traded their first round pick to the San Diego Chargers (used on Billy Ray Smith Jr.) weeks before the draft.

In 1983, Montana threw for 3,910 yards and 26 touchdowns in 16 regular season games. The team ended the regular season with a 10–6 record and finished first in the NFC West. In the divisional playoff game, they faced the Detroit Lions. Yet again, Montana demonstrated his ability to perform well in high-pressure situations. Despite being out-played in terms of total yardage, the 49ers trailed by just six points as the game neared its conclusion. With 1:23 remaining in regulation, the 49ers offense had the ball at the Lions 14-yard line and Montana completed a touchdown pass to wide receiver Freddie Solomon, giving San Francisco the lead on the ensuing extra-point.

The victory placed the 49ers in the NFC Championship game against the Washington Redskins. As he had done before, Montana asserted himself late in the game. The Redskins led 21–0 at the start of the fourth quarter, but Montana helped lead the 49ers back. Aided by three fourth-quarter Montana touchdown passes, the 49ers tied the game at 21. However, Redskins placekicker Mark Moseley kicked a 25-yard field goal in the waning moments of the game. Despite Montana&#x27;s efforts, the team lost, 24–21.

====1984====
Though the Miami Dolphins finished the 1972 NFL season with no losses, the regular season at the time comprised only 14 games. Thus, when the 49ers finished the 1984 NFL season with a 15–1 record, they became the first team to win 15 games in a single regular season.

Montana again had an excellent season and earned his second consecutive trip to the Pro Bowl. In their first two playoff games, the 49ers defeated the New York Giants and the Chicago Bears by a combined score of 44–10. In Super Bowl XIX, the 49ers faced the Miami Dolphins and their quarterback, Dan Marino.

In the game, Montana threw for three touchdowns and completed 24 of 35 passes. He established the Super Bowl record for most yards passing in a single game (331) and supplemented his passing with 59 yards rushing. The 49ers defeated the Dolphins 38–16 and Montana earned his second Super Bowl MVP award. After the game, 49ers head coach Bill Walsh said: &quot;Joe Montana is the greatest quarterback today, maybe the greatest quarterback of all time.&quot;

==== 1985–1987 ====
Aided in part by Montana&#x27;s performance at quarterback, the 49ers advanced to the NFL Playoffs again in 1985; however, they lost in the NFC Wild card game to the New York Giants.

In the 1986 season, Montana suffered a severe back injury during week one of the season. The injury was to a spinal disc in Montana&#x27;s lower back and required immediate surgery. The injury was so severe that Montana&#x27;s doctors suggested that Montana retire. On September 15, 1986, the 49ers placed Montana on the injured reserve list; however, he returned to the team on November 6 of that year. In his first game back from injury Montana passed for 270 yards and three touchdown passes in a 43–17 49ers victory against the St. Louis Cardinals. Montana appeared in just eight games that season, and threw more interceptions than touchdown passes for the only time in his career. The 49ers finished the season with a record of 10–5–1. Montana was co-recipient (with Minnesota Vikings quarterback Tommy Kramer) of the 1986 NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award.

In 1987, Montana had 31 touchdown passes, a career-high, in just 13 games. Montana crossed the picket line during the NFLPA strike and threw five touchdowns against replacement players. In 1987, he also set the NFL record for most consecutive pass attempts without an incomplete pass (22), passed for 3,054 yards, and had a passer rating of 102.1. Though the 49ers finished with the best record in the NFL, they lost in the Divisional Round of the playoffs to the Minnesota Vikings.

Prior to the 1987 season, Bill Walsh completed a trade for Steve Young, then a quarterback with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Young went on to appear in eight regular season games for the team and finished the year with a passer rating of 120.8.

==== 1988 ====
Young&#x27;s performance in 1987 was strong enough that by the time the 1988 season began, a controversy was in place as to who should get more playing time as quarterback. Young appeared in 11 games that year and rumors surfaced claiming that Montana might be traded.

Despite the competition for playing time, Montana received most of the playing time during the 1988 season. After a home loss to the Los Angeles Raiders that left the 49ers with a 6–5 record, the 49ers were in danger of missing the playoffs. Montana regained the starting position and led the 49ers to a 10–6 record and the NFC West division title.

The 49ers earned a trip to Super Bowl XXIII when they defeated the Minnesota Vikings and the Chicago Bears in the playoffs. In the NFC Divisional Playoffs, the 49ers faced Minnesota, who had eliminated them from the playoffs the year before. Montana threw three first-half touchdowns as the 49ers won, 34–9. The victory over the Bears in the NFC Championship game is of particular note. Played at Soldier Field in Chicago, with temperatures of 17 °F (-8 °C) and a strong wind, Montana threw for 288 yards and 3 touchdowns. His first touchdown pass came on a 3rd-down play late in the first quarter in which Montana threw a perfect sideline pass to Jerry Rice and Rice outran two Bears defenders for a 61-yard score. The 49ers won 28–3 to advance to Super Bowl XXIII.

In January 1989, the 49ers again faced the Cincinnati Bengals in the Super Bowl. Of his third trip to the Super Bowl, Montana told the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;: &quot;This trip to the Super Bowl is more gratifying than the others because the road has been harder.&quot; Then, in Super Bowl XXIII, Montana had one of the best performances of his career. He completed 23 of 36 passes for a then-Super Bowl record 357 yards and two touchdowns. Despite his great performance, the 49ers found themselves trailing the Bengals 16–13 with only 3:20 left in the game and the ball on their own 8-yard line. But Montana calmly drove them down the field, completing 8 of 9 passes for 92 yards and throwing the game-winning touchdown pass to John Taylor with only 34 seconds left.

==== 1989 ====

1989 proved to be successful for Montana and the 49ers. The team finished the regular season with an NFL-best 14–2 record, and their two losses were by a total of only five points. Montana threw for 3,521 yards and 26 touchdowns with only 8 interceptions, giving him what was then the highest single-season passer rating in NFL history, a mark subsequently broken by Young in 1994, and later broken again by Peyton Manning of the Indianapolis Colts in 2004 and Aaron Rodgers in 2011 with the Packers. He also rushed for 227 yards and three touchdowns on the ground and earned the NFL Most Valuable Player Award. In a memorable comeback win in Week 4 against the Philadelphia Eagles, Montana threw four touchdown passes in the 4th quarter. He finished with 428 yards passing and five touchdown passes in the victory. The 49ers were successful in the playoffs, easily beating the Minnesota Vikings 41–13 in the divisional round and the Los Angeles Rams 30–3 in the NFC Championship game. Montana threw for a total of 503 yards and 6 touchdowns in those 2 games without a single interception. Then in Super Bowl XXIV, Montana became the first player ever to win Super Bowl MVP honors for a third time, throwing for 297 yards and a then-Super Bowl record five touchdowns while also rushing for 15 yards as the 49ers defeated the Denver Broncos 55–10, the highest single-team and most lopsided score in Super Bowl history. His postseason passer rating of 146.4 was at the time the highest ever in a single postseason. This record was later broken by Josh Allen during his 2021-2022 season with the Bills.

====1990====
In 1990, Montana once again led the 49ers to the best regular season record (14–2) in the NFL. He was named by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; as Sportsman of the Year. A highlight from the season was a rematch with the Atlanta Falcons. Intent on blitzing Montana most of the game, Atlanta&#x27;s defense allowed Montana to throw for a career-best 476 yards (49ers single-game record) and six touchdown passes, five of them to Jerry Rice. He would end up throwing for 3,944 yards and 26 touchdowns, albeit while also throwing a career-high 16 interceptions. Three of those interceptions came in a November 25 home loss to the Los Angeles Rams, which ended the 49ers&#x27; 18-game winning streak (dating back to a home loss to the Green Bay Packers in November 1989).
The 49ers run game struggled in 1990: the team averaged 3.8 yards a carry, only good enough for 19th in the league. No 49er exceeded 500 yards rushing for the entire year. Fullback Tom Rathman scored the most touchdowns (7) on the ground while gaining 318 yards. Roger Craig (439 yards, 1 TD) was slowed by a knee injury suffered in week 5 against the Houston Oilers. Rookie running back Dexter Carter (460 yards, 1 TD) did not help much. Carter&#x27;s only touchdown came on December 17 at the Rams; his 74-yard touchdown run that clinched home-field advantage for the 49ers constituted roughly one-sixth of his productivity in terms of yardage on the ground, and he lost four fumbles at home the following Sunday in a 13–10 loss to the New Orleans Saints.

The 49ers looked forward to becoming the first NFL team to win three consecutive Super Bowls, and they defeated Washington in the Divisional Round to advance to the NFC Championship Game to face the New York Giants. The 49ers defense was able to hold backup quarterback Jeff Hostetler and the Giants without a touchdown, but the tide of the game changed when Montana was sacked by Leonard Marshall while rolling out of the quarterback pocket; he was injured and left the game, which the Giants won, 15–13, on the last of five Giants field goals, which was set up by a fumble from 49ers running back Roger Craig.

==== 1991–1992 ====

Montana missed the entire 1991 season and most of the 1992 season with an elbow injury sustained during the 1991 pre-season. In the final game of the 1992 regular season; a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; matchup against the Detroit Lions, Montana stepped in and played the entire second half. Despite missing nearly two full seasons, Montana proved to be very effective, sealing the victory with &quot;insurance points&quot;. By this time, however, Steve Young had established himself as a starter, and took over for the playoffs. Though it was not known at the time, Montana would not see another snap in a 49er uniform. He suited up for the final time as a 49er in the team&#x27;s NFC Championship showdown with the Dallas Cowboys, though as third-string QB behind Young and Steve Bono.

====Quarterback controversy and departure====
With Montana healthy and ready to play, a quarterback controversy soon emerged. Steve Young had proven his effectiveness in the two years he played while Montana was injured, and many fans and players alike felt that they had made the transition to Steve Young. Furthermore, Young did not want to play if he was used only as a backup. Nevertheless, there was also a strong sentiment that Montana was the &quot;face of the franchise&quot; and it would be right for him to remain so. A rift in the locker room developed, and Montana ultimately requested a trade. Young eventually led the team to another Super Bowl victory, which helped him emerge from Montana&#x27;s shadow.

===Kansas City Chiefs (1993–1994)===
Montana was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs on April 20, 1993, and signed a $10 million contract over three years. His trade was the catalyst for the subsequent Chiefs&#x27; free-agent signing of star Los Angeles Raiders running back Marcus Allen on June 9. The arrival of Montana and Allen, both former Super Bowl MVPs, generated much media attention and excitement in Kansas City. Chiefs general manager Carl Peterson had spent the 1993 off-season bringing in players to run a West Coast offense under the direction of new offensive coordinator Paul Hackett, who at one time served as 49ers quarterbacks coach to Montana, and who would report to incumbent head coach Marty Schottenheimer.

The Chiefs mailed three jerseys to Montana. One was number 3, his number from Notre Dame, which the Chiefs had retired in honor of Hall of Fame kicker Jan Stenerud, who offered to let him wear it. Another was number 19, which he wore in youth football and also briefly in training camp of the 1979 season with San Francisco, and the third was number 16, which Hall of Fame quarterback Len Dawson offered to let Montana wear since the organization had retired it. Montana declined Dawson&#x27;s and Stenerud&#x27;s offers and wore 19 instead. During the Chiefs&#x27; first offseason practice, the defensive players all remained behind after their session concluded to watch the offensive team practice &quot;because they wanted to see Joe Montana play. That&#x27;s what those guys thought of the trade. It gave everybody hope we could win a championship. That&#x27;s why it was such a special time.&quot;

Montana was injured for part of the 1993 season, but was still selected to his final Pro Bowl, as the Chiefs won their division for the first time in 22 years. Montana led the Chiefs in two come-from-behind wins in the 1993 playoffs. In their wild-card win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, he threw a 7-yard fourth-down touchdown pass to send the game into overtime. Then against the Houston Oilers, he led the team to 28 second-half points, including three touchdown passes to earn the 29th fourth-quarter comeback win of his career. In the AFC Championship Game, Kansas City lost to the Buffalo Bills 30–13, with Montana suffering a concussion during the third play of the third quarter and yielding to Dave Krieg. Including their two playoff victories that year (the Chiefs only had one prior playoff win since Super Bowl IV in 1970), the 1993 Chiefs won 13 games, which tied the franchise record for wins in a season.

Montana returned healthy to the Chiefs in 1994, starting all but two games. His highlights included a classic duel with John Elway and the Denver Broncos (which Montana and the Chiefs won, 31–28) on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, and a memorable game in week 2 when Montana played against his old team, the San Francisco 49ers and Steve Young. In a much-anticipated match-up, Montana and the Chiefs prevailed and defeated the 49ers, 24–17. Montana led his team to a 9–7 record, sufficient for another postseason appearance, where they lost in the wild-card playoff round to the Miami Dolphins and Dan Marino, 27–17.

Montana has fondly remembered the Chiefs&#x27; home of Arrowhead Stadium with its &quot;unbelievable roar&quot; from field level, saying, &quot;The thing about Kansas City, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether they&#x27;re winning or losing, that fan base is ridiculous. Over the years, I don&#x27;t think that stadium&#x27;s ever been empty. Those people there support that team and that organization like none you&#x27;ve seen. And it is so loud. Even after 50 years, they&#x27;re still in there screaming every week. That fan base is probably one of the best in the NFL, one of the hardest places to play for sure&quot;. Head coach Marty Schottenheimer pulled Montana aside before his first game at Arrowhead and told him to prepare for a volume he had never previously experienced. Montana recalled, &quot;Come on, Marty, I&#x27;ve played in four Super Bowls. I&#x27;ve played all over the place. And Marty said, &#x27;Just wait.&#x27; The thing that gets you is the whole stadium, when they sing the national anthem, is when they say, &#x27;And the home of the... Chiefs!&#x27; Still makes your hair stand up on your arms.&quot;

===Retirement===

On April 18, 1995, Montana announced his retirement at Justin Herman Plaza in San Francisco. The event was broadcast live on local television, and included speeches from John Madden, Eddie DeBartolo Jr., and others. Highlights from Montana&#x27;s stay with San Francisco and interviews with former 49ers teammates were also shown. Bill Walsh, who had served as head coach for three of Montana&#x27;s four Super Bowl victories, was the emcee for the event.

==NFL records and accomplishments==
Noted for his ability to remain calm under pressure, Montana helped his teams to 32 fourth-quarter come-from-behind victories. With 58 seconds left in the 1981 NFC Championship Game against the Dallas Cowboys, he completed a game-winning touchdown pass so memorable that it would become known simply as &quot;The Catch&quot;. In Super Bowl XXIII against the Cincinnati Bengals, Montana threw another remarkable game-winning touchdown pass at the end of a 92-yard drive with only 36 seconds left on the game clock.

During his career with the 49ers, Montana completed 2,929 of 4,600 passes for 35,142 yards with 244 touchdowns and 123 interceptions. He had thirty-five 300-yard passing games including seven in which he threw for over 400 yards. His career totals: 3,409 completions on 5,391 attempts, 273 touchdowns, 139 interceptions, and 40,551 yards passing. He also rushed for 1,676 yards and 20 touchdowns. When Montana retired, his career passer rating was 92.3, second only to his 49er successor Steve Young (96.8). He has since been surpassed by five other players, which ranks his passer rating at 7th all-time. Montana also had won 100 games faster than any other quarterback until surpassed by Tom Brady in 2008. His record as a starter was 117–47. His number 16 was retired by the 49ers on December 15, 1997, during halftime of the team&#x27;s game against the Denver Broncos on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. Montana also held the record for most passing yards on a Monday night game with 458 against the Los Angeles Rams in 1989.

Montana is second in postseason records for most games with a passer rating over 100.0 (12), career postseason touchdown passes (45), passing yards (5,772), and games with 300+ passing yards (six, tied with Kurt Warner). He also tied Terry Bradshaw&#x27;s record for consecutive playoff games with at least two touchdown passes (seven), though this record has since been broken by Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco and Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Undefeated in four Super Bowl appearances, Montana completed 83 of 122 passes for 1,142 yards, 11 touchdowns, and no interceptions, earning him a Super Bowl record passer rating of 127.8. The first player ever to win three Super Bowl MVP awards, Montana also holds the Super Bowl record for most pass attempts (122) without throwing an interception.

He was selected to the Pro Bowl eight times and selected All-Pro six times. He is also the only player to have two touchdown passes of 95+ yards.

Montana was listed at #4 on the NFL Network&#x27;s &quot;The Top 100: NFL&#x27;s Greatest Players&quot; (the highest ranking quarterback on the list), with teammate Jerry Rice at #1.

==Nicknames==
Montana earned the nickname &quot;Joe Cool&quot; for his ability to stay calm at key moments, and &quot;Comeback Kid&quot; for his history of rallying his teams from late-game deficits. His teammates in San Francisco called him &quot;Bird Legs&quot; due to his very thin legs and small calves. He was called &quot;Golden Joe&quot; because he played in California (the Golden State) and because he also appeared on a poster superimposed in front of the Golden Gate Bridge with the words &quot;The Golden Great&quot;. Two more names were provided by a &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; nickname contest early in his NFL career: the winner was &quot;Big Sky&quot;, but another contestant suggested that since &quot;Joe Montana&quot; already sounded like a nickname, Montana needed a real name and christened him &quot;David W. Gibson&quot;. Montana liked the Gibson name so much that he had it stenciled above his locker.

Montana appears as the character &quot;Joe Clifford&quot; (pseudonym derived from his first and middle names) in the NFL Network&#x27;s &quot;Joe&#x27;s Diner&quot; television spots.

==Personal life==
Montana has been married three times. In 1974, he wed his hometown sweetheart Kim Moses during his second semester at Notre Dame and they divorced three years later. In 1981, he married Cass Castillo; they divorced in 1984. He met Jennifer Wallace, an actress and model, while the two worked on a Schick commercial and the couple married in 1985. They have four children, two daughters and two sons. His son Nate was an undrafted free agent out of West Virginia Wesleyan. His other son, Nick, played at Tulane University.

In 2008, Montana sued his first wife and a Dallas auction house for &quot;violating his &#x27;copyright and privacy rights&#x27;&quot; after she &quot;sold a bunch of letters and memorabilia from [Montana&#x27;s] college days at Notre Dame&quot;.

Montana resides in San Francisco. He owns horses and produces wine under the label Montagia.

Montana frequently works with the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

<text>Ilulissat, also Jacobshavn or Jakobshav, is the municipal seat and largest town of the Avannaata municipality in western Greenland, located approximately north of the Arctic Circle. With a population of 4,670 as of 2020, it is the third-largest city in Greenland, after Nuuk and Sisimiut. 
The city is home to almost as many sled-dogs as people.

In direct translation, Ilulissat is the Kalaallisut word for &quot;Icebergs&quot; (). The nearby Ilulissat Icefjord is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and has made Ilulissat the most popular tourist destination in Greenland. Tourism is now the town&#x27;s principal industry.
The city neighbours the Ilulissat Icefjord, where there are enormous icebergs from the most productive glacier in the northern hemisphere.

==History==

The town was established as a trading post by Jacob Severin&#x27;s company in 1741 and was named in his honor after the Battle of Jacobshavn.

The Zion Church (&quot;Zions Kirke&quot;) was built in the late 18th century, and was the largest man-made structure in Greenland at the time. The final resident of nearby Sermermiut moved to Ilulissat in 1850.

===Ilulissat Declaration===

The town was the site of the Arctic Ocean Conference in May 2008. The joint meeting between Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the United States was held to discuss key issues relating to territorial claims in the Arctic (particularly Hans Island - eventually settled in 2022 -, and Arktika 2007) and Arctic shrinkage produced by climate change.

The Ilulissat Declaration arose from the conference. It stated that the law of the sea provided for important rights and obligations concerning the delineation of the outer limits of the continental shelf, the protection of the marine environment (including ice-covered areas), freedom of navigation, marine scientific research, and other uses of the sea. It also said that it remained committed to this legal framework and to the orderly settlement of any possible overlapping claims.

With this existing legal framework providing a solid foundation for responsible management, there was no need to develop a new comprehensive international legal regime to govern the Arctic Ocean. The states involved would continue the developments within the Arctic Ocean and continue to implement appropriate measures to further said developments.

===Hotel Ilulissat fire===
On 7 March 2021 at 20.12 (local time), a major fire broke out in Hotel Ilulissat, which at the time was still under construction. The fire and smoke was seen throughout the city. Police asked everyone in the area to stay home and keep their windows closed, until the fire fighters ended the fire. The police in Nuuk are to start an investigation.
Not long after the fire fighters arrived, a gas cylinder exploded. The explosion was heard throughout the city.

==Geography and environment==
The Ilulissat Icefjord () southeast of Ilulissat was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004.

Ilulissat has a tundra climate (ET) with long, cold winters and short, cool summers. Ilulissat is one of the driest settlements in Greenland, receiving only of precipitation. Ilulissat is also one of the sunniest settlements in Greenland, especially during summer. Interestingly, March is the coldest month in Ilulissat despite similar locations experiencing February as the coldest month of the year. March also holds the all-time record low temperature of .

<doc id="295706" wikidata="Q535887" url="?curid=295706" title="Tom McClintock">
<text>Thomas Miller McClintock II ( ; born July 10, 1956) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for since 2009 (known as the 4th congressional district until 2023). His district stretches from the Sacramento suburbs to the outer suburbs of Fresno; it includes Yosemite National Park. A member of the Republican Party, McClintock served as a California state assemblyman from 1982 to 1992 and from 1996 to 2000, when he became a California state senator, a position he held until 2008. He unsuccessfully ran for governor of California in the 2003 recall election and for lieutenant governor of California in the 2006 election.

==Early life, education and early political career==
McClintock was born in White Plains, New York, and graduated in 1978 from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with a degree in political science. At 23, he was elected chair of the Ventura County Republican Party, and served until 1981. He was chief of staff to State Senator Ed Davis from 1980 to 1982. From 1992 to 1994, he served as director of the Center for the California Taxpayer. He was director of the Claremont Institute&#x27;s Golden State Center for Policy Studies from 1995 to 1996.

==California politics==

===California Assembly (1982–1992, 1996–2000)===
In 1982, at age 26, McClintock ran for California&#x27;s 36th State Assembly district, then based in Thousand Oaks, after redistricting. He defeated Democrat Harriet Kosmo Henson 56%–44%. He was reelected in 1984, defeating Tom Jolicoeur 72%–28%. In 1986, he was reelected to a third term, defeating Frank Nekimken 73%–25%. In 1988, he was reelected to a fourth term, defeating George Webb II 70%–29%. In 1990, he was reelected to a fifth term, defeating Ginny Connell 59%–36%.

After running for Congress in 1992 and for controller in 1994, McClintock ran for the Assembly again in 1996. He ran for California&#x27;s 38th State Assembly district and defeated Democrat Jon Lauritzen 56%–40% to win his sixth Assembly term. In 1998, McClintock was reelected to a seventh term unopposed.

McClintock authored California&#x27;s lethal injection use for California&#x27;s death penalty law. He also opposed tax increases and supported spending cuts. He was a strong proponent of abolishing the car tax.

===California Senate (2000–2008)===
In 2000, McClintock retired from the California Assembly to run for California&#x27;s 19th State Senate district. He ranked first in the March 7 open primary with 52% of the vote. In November, he defeated Democrat Daniel Gonzalez, 58%–42%. He was reelected in 2004, defeating Paul Joseph Graber, 61%–39%.

In 2008, McClintock voted against Proposition 2, which prohibits confining calves, pigs and hens in small cages in which they cannot extend their limbs. &quot;Farm animals are food, not friends&quot;, he said in response to backlash to his vote. He also cited concern about increased grocery bills. In 2000, he was instrumental in proposing a two-thirds reduction in the vehicle license fee, or car tax. In 2003, he opposed then-Governor Gray Davis&#x27;s attempt to rescind a rollback of a vehicle license fee. McClintock has also opposed deficit reduction efforts that would have increased taxes. He supported the Bureaucracy Reduction and Closure Commission and performance-based budgeting.

===Other elections===

====1994 controller election====

McClintock ran for California State Controller after incumbent Gray Davis retired. He won the Republican primary, defeating John Morris, 61%–39%. In the general election, he lost to Kathleen Connell, former Special Assistant to Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and Director of the L.A. Housing Authority, 48%–46%, with three other candidates receiving the other 6% of the vote.

====2002 controller election====

McClintock ran for controller again in 2002, facing Democratic nominee Steve Westly, an eBay executive. Westly outspent him 5-to-1. McClintock&#x27;s campaigns focused on increasing accountability for the state budget. The ads featured the character &quot;Angus McClintock&quot;, a fictional cousin and fellow Scottish American extolling McClintock&#x27;s thriftiness and accountability in low-budget 15-second ads. He lost by a margin of just 0.2%, or 16,811 votes, to Westly, who won with 45.3% of the vote. Three other candidates received 9.5% of the vote.

====2003 gubernatorial recall election====

In 2003, McClintock ran in the recall election against Davis. Republican and film actor Arnold Schwarzenegger won the election with 49% of the vote. Democratic Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante finished second with 31%. McClintock finished third with 14%. Together, Republicans Schwarzenegger and McClintock were supported by 5,363,778 Californians, or 62.1% of the vote. 132 other candidates received the remaining 6.4%.

McClintock performed the best in Stanislaus County, where he received 24% of the vote. He also cracked 20% or higher in several other counties: Mariposa (23%), Tuolumne (22%), Tehama (21%), Calaveras (20%), Madera (20%), Modoc (20%), Shasta (20%), San Joaquin (20%), and Ventura (20%).

====2006 lieutenant gubernatorial election====

McClintock ran for lieutenant governor in 2006. He defeated Tony Farmer in the Republican primary, 94–6%. In the general election, he lost to Democratic State Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, 49%–45%.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
====1992====
After redistricting, McClintock retired from the Assembly to challenge Democratic U.S. Representative Anthony C. Beilenson in California&#x27;s 24th congressional district. He won the nine-candidate Republican primary with a plurality of 34% of the vote, beating second-place finisher Sang Korman by 11 points. Beilenson defeated McClintock, 56–39%.

====2008====

On March 4, 2008, McClintock announced his candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives in California&#x27;s 4th congressional district, about 300 miles north of the district McClintock represented in the state Senate. The district&#x27;s nine-term incumbent, John Doolittle, was retiring. McClintock was unable to vote for himself in either the primary or the general election. Although for most of the year he lived in Elk Grove, a suburb of Sacramento within the 3rd district at the time, his legal residence was in Thousand Oaks, within the borders of his state senate district. The California Constitution requires state senators to maintain their legal residence in the district they represent.

Upon McClintock&#x27;s entry into the race, fellow Republicans Rico Oller and Eric Egland withdrew from the primary and endorsed him. He was also endorsed by the Republican Liberty Caucus, the Club for Growth, and U.S. Representative Ron Paul. McClintock faced former U.S. Representative Doug Ose, a moderate who represented the neighboring 3rd District from 1999 to 2005. Like McClintock, Ose lived outside the district and was painted as a carpetbagger and a liberal who had voted to raise taxes and who voted for earmarks. McClintock defeated Ose, 54–39%.

The Democratic nominee was retired Air Force Lt. Col. Charles D. (Charlie) Brown, who had run an unexpectedly strong race against Doolittle in 2006. In March 2008, Ose&#x27;s campaign commercials criticized McClintock for receiving over $300,000 in per diem living expenses during his time in the state senate even though he lived in Elk Grove for most of the year. McClintock maintained that the payments were justified because his legal residence was in Thousand Oaks, in his district. He said, &quot;Every legislator&#x27;s [Sacramento area] residence is close to the Capitol. My residential costs up here are much greater than the average legislator because my family is here.&quot; Ose&#x27;s campaign commercials argued McClintock did not own or rent a home in the 19th district, but claimed his mother&#x27;s home in Thousand Oaks as his state senate district residence. These attacks prompted a response from McClintock&#x27;s wife, Lori, who said McClintock stayed with his mother in order to care for her after she fell ill and after the death of her husband. McClintock ran ads attacking Brown&#x27;s participation at a 2005 protest by Code Pink, a prominent antiwar group, and argued Brown supported gay marriage but not the troops in Iraq. He also portrayed Brown as a clone of Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

By November 23, McClintock led Brown by 1,566 votes (0.4% of the vote), 184,190 to 182,624. Subsequent returns expanded the margin slightly with the last returns coming in from El Dorado County shortly after Thanksgiving. On December 1, McClintock declared victory and Brown conceded on December 3. McClintock defeated Brown by a margin of 0.5%, or 1,800 votes. He prevailed by a 3,500-vote margin in Placer County, the district&#x27;s largest county. Brown won three of the district&#x27;s nine counties: Sierra (49.8%), Plumas (47.9%), and Nevada (42.3%). McClintock won mainly on the coattails from John McCain, who carried the 4th with 54% of the vote, his fifth-best total in the state.

====2010====

McClintock defeated Michael Babich in the Republican primary, Babich 78–22%. On November 2, he was reelected, defeating businessman Clint Curtis 61–31% and winning every county in the district.

====2012====

For his first two terms, McClintock represented a district covering the northeast corner of California, from the eastern suburbs of Sacramento to the Oregon border.

Redistricting after the 2010 census pushed the 4th well to the south. Only three counties remained from the old 4th: Nevada, Placer, and El Dorado. The redrawn district cut out the 4th&#x27;s share of Sacramento County, including the part of Elk Grove that includes McClintock&#x27;s home. Elk Grove is now entirely within the borders of the neighboring 7th District, represented by Democrat Ami Bera, making McClintock one of only a few members of Congress who live outside the district they represent. House members are constitutionally required only to live in the state they represent, but longstanding convention holds that they live in or reasonably close to their districts. McClintock said in 2016 that he intended to move his residence inside the redrawn 4th as soon as home prices rebounded enough for him to sell his Elk Grove home.

In 2012, California instituted its &quot;top two&quot; primary, in which candidates of all parties run against one another and the top two finishers, regardless of party, advance to the general election. McClintock and Democrat Jack Uppal were the only candidates in the &quot;top two&quot; primary, so the general election was a rematch. The reconfigured 4th was as strongly Republican as its predecessor, and McClintock was reelected to a third term, defeating Uppal 61%–39% in the general election. McClintock won all but two of the district&#x27;s ten counties: Alpine (41%) and Nevada (37%).

====2014====

McClintock was reelected, finishing first in California&#x27;s &quot;top two&quot; primary and defeating moderate Republican challenger National Guard Major Art Moore in the general election, 60%–40%.

====2016====

McClintock again finished first in the primary and defeated Democrat Robert W. Derlet, a physician, environmentalist and retired UC Davis professor, in the general election, 63%–37%.

====2018====

McClintock defeated Democratic challenger Jessica Morse in the general election, receiving 184,401 votes to her 156,253 (54.1% to 45.9%).

===Tenure===
During the 112th Congress McClintock was one of 40 members of the Republican Study Committee who frequently voted against Republican Party leadership and vocally expressed displeasure with House bills. In 2011, he voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 due to a provision that would allow the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial. McClintock&#x27;s chief of staff, Igor Birman, was a candidate for Congress in California&#x27;s 7th congressional district in 2014.

In 2009, McClintock signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any global warming legislation that would raise taxes.

McClintock voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He voted against the first version of the bill, displeased with the removal of deductions related to medical expenses, student loan interest, and casualty loss. Those three items were addressed in the final version of the bill. McClintock said the bill would &quot;restore American workers to an internationally competitive position.&quot; He expressed concern about the bill&#x27;s impact on the budget deficit and anticipated that it would be addressed &quot;by spending reforms this coming year.&quot;

In 2017, McClintock called for special prosecutor Robert Mueller to investigate President Donald Trump. McClintock felt that Trump&#x27;s firing of James Comey justified a special prosecutor.

After Trump pulled 1,000 U.S. troops from Kurdish-held territory on the Syrian border south of Turkey in 2019, a bipartisan resolution passed the House, 354–60, that condemned him for abandoning those U.S. allies that would allow the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) to reestablish and regroup its forces, and allow the Turks to attack the Kurds. McClintock was one of the two members of California&#x27;s congressional delegation to vote against it.

In 2020, McClintock was the sole House Republican to cosponsor the Ending Qualified Immunity Act, which was proposed in response to the murder of George Floyd and resultant widespread protests. The act was introduced by Justin Amash and Ayanna Pressley and cosponsored by 62 House Democrats in addition to McClintock. Because Amash was a registered Libertarian as of the act&#x27;s introduction in June 2020, McClintock&#x27;s support technically made the act the first tripartisan piece of federal legislation in modern U.S. history.

In the 118th Congress, McClintock voted against multiple motions to discipline certain Democrats in office, such as the first censure of Adam Schiff, the censure of Rashida Tlaib, and the impeachment of Alejandro Mayorkas. In each, he lambasted their actions but believed the motions were an erosion of the standards to which such motions should be held. Despite making a speech supporting holding Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for the federal prosecution of Donald Trump, he would vote against holding him in contempt for refusing to release the audio files of the Hur interviews in the Joe Biden classified documents incident.

As of October 2021, McClintock had voted in line with Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 5% of the time.

===Legislation===
McClintock supported the Water Rights Protection Act, a bill that would prevent federal agencies from requiring certain entities to relinquish their water rights to the United States in order to use public lands. The bill was a reaction to the United States Forest Service&#x27;s decision to pursue a &quot;new regulation to demand that water rights be transferred to the federal government as a condition for obtaining permits needed to operate 121 ski resorts that cross over federal lands.&quot; McClintock supported the bill, saying that the Forest Service&#x27;s regulation &quot;illustrates an increasingly hostile attitude by this agency toward those who make productive use of our vast national forests, in this case by enhancing and attracting the tourism upon which our mountain communities depend.&quot;

===Committee assignments===
For the 118th Congress:
* Committee on Natural Resources
** Subcommittee on Federal Lands
** Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife and Fisheries
* Committee on the Budget
* Committee on the Judiciary
** Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement (Chair)
** Subcommittee on the Constitution and Limited Government

===Caucus memberships===
* Congressional Arts Caucus
* Republican Study Committee
* Tea Party Caucus
* American Sikh Congressional Caucus
*Congressional Constitution Caucus
*Congressional Western Caucus
*United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus
*House Freedom Caucus (Formerly)

==Political positions==
===2020 presidential election===
In December 2020, McClintock joined 125 other Republican members of Congress in signing an amicus brief in support of a lawsuit by the attorney general of the state of Texas that sought to overturn the certified results of the 2020 presidential election in four other U.S. states. The lawsuit was called a &quot;seditious abuse of the judicial process&quot; by the attorney general of Pennsylvania, and &quot;simply madness&quot; by 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of &quot;election subversion.&quot;

McClintock later became one of seven Republicans who did not support their colleagues&#x27; efforts to challenge the results of the election on January 6, 2021. These seven signed a letter that, while giving credence to election fraud allegations Trump made, said Congress did not have the authority to influence the election&#x27;s outcome.

McClintock voted against impeaching Trump over his role in inciting the 2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol.

===Animal rights===
McClintock has said that &quot;farm animals are food, not friends.&quot;

===Cannabis===
In 2015, McClintock introduced an amendment to limit the enforcement of federal law in states that have legalized cannabis. Known as the McClintock–Polis amendment, it failed by a 206–222 vote. It was reintroduced in 2019 as the Blumenauer–McClintock–Norton amendment and passed 267–165.

In 2016, McClintock endorsed California&#x27;s Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act. He stated: &quot;Our current laws have failed us, and have created a violent and criminal black market that actively and aggressively markets to young people. Legalization takes the criminal profit out of the equation, and allows us to regulate marijuana the same way we currently regulate alcohol.&quot;

In 2020, McClintock was one of five House Republicans to vote for the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act to legalize cannabis at the federal level. In 2021, he was one of four original cosponsors of a Republican-led legalization bill named the States Reform Act.

===COVID-19===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, McClintock expressed the view that wearing face masks should not be mandatory, and while wearing a mask during congressional sessions, said, &quot;this mask is useless&quot;. During the second impeachment of Donald Trump, McClintock wore a mask that read &quot;This mask is as useless as our governor&quot;, referring to Governor Gavin Newsom.

===Defense===
In September 2021, McClintock was among 75 House Republicans to vote against the National Defense Authorization Act of 2022, which contains a provision that would require women to be drafted.

===Environment===
Despite overwhelming scientific consensus, McClintock questions the role that human activity plays in climate change, arguing that the &quot;climate has been changing for four and a half billion years.&quot;

===Foreign policy===
In 2019, McClintock was one of 60 representatives to vote against condemning Trump&#x27;s withdrawal from Syria.

In 2020, McClintock voted against the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021, which would prevent the president from withdrawing soldiers from Afghanistan without congressional approval.

In June 2021, McClintock was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the AUMF against Iraq.

In July 2021, McClintock was one of five House Republicans to vote against a bill that allocates $2.1 billion for Afghan visas and Capitol Hill security.

In 2023, McClintock was among 47 Republicans to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.

===Human and civil rights===

McClintock opposes same-sex marriage. In 2008, he said, &quot;calling a homosexual partnership a marriage doesn&#x27;t make it one.&quot;

In June 2021, McClintock was one of 14 House Republicans to vote against legislation to establish June 19, or Juneteenth, as a federal holiday.

===Immigration===
McClintock voted against the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2019 which would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to eliminate the per-country numerical limitation for employment-based immigrants, to increase the per-country numerical limitation for family-sponsored immigrants, and for other purposes.

McClintock voted against the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 which authorizes DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.

McClintock voted against Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158) which effectively prohibits ICE from cooperating with Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of unaccompanied alien children (UACs).

===Voting rights===
McClintock opposes mail-in voting, saying in 2020 that it was a &quot;corrupted process&quot; that allows ballots to be sent to voters who have died or moved away.

==Personal life==
McClintock was married to Lori McClintock until her death in December 2021, from dehydration due to gastroenteritis caused, according to a coroner&#x27;s report, by &quot;adverse effects of white mulberry leaf ingestion&quot;. McClintock is a Baptist. , he lives in Elk Grove, California.

<text>Sermermiut was an Inuit settlement in the Disko Bay, Greenland. The location is now part of the Ilulissat Icefjord World Heritage Site.

==History==
The pre-colonial history of Sermermiut was pieced together by a series of archaeological excavations during the twentieth century. The area became an area of archaeological interest at the start of the century, although the results were not well documented. A 1953 dig identified that Sermermiut had been used by Saqqaq, Early Dorset and Thule cultures. Another dig in 1983 dated the start of the Early Dorset settlement at around 600–200 BCE.

Sermermiut was abandoned in 1850 when the last resident moved to nearby Jacobshavn (Ilulissat).

<doc id="295710" wikidata="Q1411245" url="?curid=295710" title="Transact-SQL">
<text>Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft&#x27;s and Sybase&#x27;s proprietary extension to the SQL (Structured Query Language) used to interact with relational databases. T-SQL expands on the SQL standard to include procedural programming, local variables, various support functions for string processing, date processing, mathematics, etc. and changes to the DELETE and UPDATE statements.

Transact-SQL is central to using Microsoft SQL Server. All applications that communicate with an instance of SQL Server do so by sending Transact-SQL statements to the server, regardless of the user interface of the application.

Stored procedures in SQL Server are executable server-side routines. The advantage of stored procedures is the ability to pass parameters.

==Variables==
Transact-SQL provides the following statements to declare and set local variables: codice_1, codice_2 and codice_3.

DECLARE @var1 NVARCHAR(30);
SET @var1 = &#x27;Some Name&#x27;;
SELECT @var1 = Name
 FROM Sales.Store
 WHERE CustomerID = 100;
==Flow control==
Keywords for flow control in Transact-SQL include codice_4 and codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, codice_9 and codice_10, codice_11, codice_12, and codice_13.

codice_9 and codice_10 allow conditional execution. This batch statement will print &quot;It is the weekend&quot; if the current date is a weekend day, or &quot;It is a weekday&quot; if the current date is a weekday. (Note: This code assumes that Sunday is configured as the first day of the week in the codice_16 setting.)
IF DATEPART(dw, GETDATE()) = 7 OR DATEPART(dw, GETDATE()) = 1
 PRINT &#x27;It is the weekend.&#x27;;
ELSE
 PRINT &#x27;It is a weekday.&#x27;;
codice_4 and codice_5 mark a block of statements. If more than one statement is to be controlled by the conditional in the example above, we can use codice_4 and codice_5 like this:
IF DATEPART(dw, GETDATE()) = 7 OR DATEPART(dw, GETDATE()) = 1
BEGIN
 PRINT &#x27;It is the weekend.&#x27;;
 PRINT &#x27;Get some rest on the weekend!&#x27;;
END;
ELSE
BEGIN
 PRINT &#x27;It is a weekday.&#x27;;
 PRINT &#x27;Get to work on a weekday!&#x27;;
END;
codice_12 will wait for a given amount of time, or until a particular time of day. The statement can be used for delays or to block execution until the set time.

codice_11 is used to immediately return from a stored procedure or function.

codice_6 ends the enclosing codice_13 loop, while codice_7 causes the next iteration of the loop to execute. An example of a codice_13 loop is given below.
DECLARE @i INT;
SET @i = 0;

WHILE @i &lt; 5
BEGIN
 PRINT &#x27;Hello world.&#x27;;
 SET @i = @i + 1;
END;
==Changes to DELETE and UPDATE statements==
In Transact-SQL, both the codice_27 and codice_28 statements are enhanced to enable data from another table to be used in the operation, without needing a subquery:
* codice_27 accepts joined tables in the codice_30 clause, similarly to codice_3. When this is done, the name or alias of which table in the join is to be deleted from is placed between codice_27 and codice_30.
* codice_28 allows a codice_30 clause to be added. The table to be updated can be either joined in the codice_30 clause and referenced by alias, or referenced only at the start of the statement as per standard SQL.

This example deletes all who have been flagged in the table with the &#x27;idle&#x27; flag.

DELETE u
FROM users AS u INNER JOIN user_flags AS f ON u.id = f.id
WHERE f.name = &#x27;idle&#x27;;
==BULK INSERT==
codice_37 is a Transact-SQL statement that implements a bulk data-loading process, inserting multiple rows into a table, reading data from an external sequential file. Use of codice_38 results in better performance than processes that issue individual codice_39 statements for each row to be added. Additional details are available in MSDN.

==TRY CATCH==
Beginning with SQL Server 2005, Microsoft introduced additional codice_40 logic to support exception type behaviour. This behaviour enables developers to simplify their code and leave out codice_41 checking after each SQL execution statement.
-- begin transaction
BEGIN TRAN;

BEGIN TRY
 -- execute each statement
 INSERT INTO MYTABLE(NAME) VALUES (&#x27;ABC&#x27;);
 INSERT INTO MYTABLE(NAME) VALUES (&#x27;123&#x27;);

 -- commit the transaction
 COMMIT TRAN;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
 -- roll back the transaction because of error
 ROLLBACK TRAN;
END CATCH;

<doc id="295711" wikidata="Q818405" url="?curid=295711" title="Linseed oil">
<text>Linseed oil, also known as flaxseed oil or flax oil (in its edible form), is a colorless to yellowish oil obtained from the dried, ripened seeds of the flax plant (&quot;Linum usitatissimum&quot;). The oil is obtained by pressing, sometimes followed by solvent extraction. 

Owing to its polymer-forming properties, linseed oil is often blended with combinations of other oils, resins or solvents as an impregnator, drying oil finish or varnish in wood finishing, as a pigment binder in oil paints, as a plasticizer and hardener in putty, and in the manufacture of linoleum. Linseed oil use has declined over the past several decades with increased availability of synthetic alkyd resins—which function similarly but resist yellowing.

==Structure and composition==
Linseed oil is a triglyceride, like other fats. Linseed oil is distinctive for its unusually large amount of α-linolenic acid, which oxidises in air. The fatty acids in a typical linseed oil are of the following types:
*The triply unsaturated α-linolenic acid (51.9–55.2%),
*The saturated acids palmitic acid (about 7%) and stearic acid (3.4–4.6%),
*The monounsaturated oleic acid (18.5–22.6%),
*The doubly unsaturated linoleic acid (14.2–17%).

==Drying properties==

Having a high content of di- and tri-unsaturated esters, linseed oil is susceptible to polymerization reactions upon exposure to oxygen in air. This polymerization, which is called autoxidation, results in the rigidification of the material. To prevent premature drying, linseed oil-based products (oil paints, putty) are stored in airtight containers.

Rags soaked with linseed oil pose fire hazard because they provide a large surface area for rapid oxidation. The oxidation of linseed oil is exothermic, which may lead to spontaneous combustion. In 1991, One Meridian Plaza, in Philadelphia, was severely damaged in a fire, in which three firefighters perished, thought to be caused by rags soaked with linseed oil.

==Applications==
Most applications of linseed oil exploit its drying properties, i.e., the initial material is liquid or at least pliable and the aged material is rigid but not brittle. The water-repelling (hydrophobic) nature of the resulting hydrocarbon-based material is advantageous.

===Paint binder===
Linseed oil is the carrier used in oil paint. It can also be used as a painting medium, making oil paints more fluid, transparent and glossy. It is available in varieties such as cold-pressed, alkali-refined, sun-bleached, sun-thickened, and polymerised (stand oil). The introduction of linseed oil was a significant advance in the technology of oil painting.

===Putty===
Traditional glazing putty, consisting of a paste of chalk powder and linseed oil, is a sealant for glass windows that hardens within a few weeks of application and can then be painted over. The durability of putty is owed to the drying properties of linseed oil.

===Wood finish===

When used as a wood finish, linseed oil dries slowly and shrinks little upon hardening. A linseed oil finish is easily scratched and liquid water penetrates a linseed oil finish in mere minutes, and water vapour bypasses it almost completely. Garden furniture treated with linseed oil may develop mildew. Oiled wood may be yellowish and is likely to darken with age. Even though the oil feels dry to the touch, studies show linseed oil does not fully cure. 

Linseed oil is a common finish for wooden items, though very fine finish may require months to obtain. Studies show the fatty-acid structure of linseed oil has problems cross-linking and oxidizing, frequently turning black.

===Gilding===
Boiled linseed oil is used as sizing in traditional oil gilding to adhere sheets of gold leaf to a substrate (parchment, canvas, Armenian bole, etc.). It has a much longer working time than water-based size and gives a firm smooth surface that is adhesive enough in the first 12–24 hours after application to cause the gold to attach firmly to the intended surface.

===Linoleum===
Linseed oil is used to bind wood dust, cork particles, and related materials in the manufacture of the floor covering linoleum. After its invention in 1860 by Frederick Walton, linoleum, or &quot;lino&quot; for short, was a common form of domestic and industrial floor covering from the 1870s until the 1970s, when it was largely replaced by PVC (&quot;vinyl&quot;) floor coverings. However, since the 1990s, linoleum is returning to favor, being considered more environmentally sound than PVC. Linoleum has given its name to the printmaking technique linocut, in which a relief design is cut into the smooth surface and then inked and used to print an image. The results are similar to those obtained by woodcut printing.

===Nutritional supplement and food===
Raw cold-pressed linseed oil – commonly known as flax seed oil in nutritional contexts – is easily oxidized, and rapidly becomes rancid, with an unpleasant odour, unless refrigerated. Linseed oil is not generally recommended for use in cooking. In one study, the content of &quot;alpha&quot;-linolenic acid (ALA) in whole flaxseeds did not decrease after heating the seeds to temperatures of up to 178 °C (352.4 °F) for one and a half hours.

Linseed oil is an edible oil in demand as a dietary supplement, as a source of α-linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid. In parts of Europe, it is traditionally eaten with potatoes and quark.

Food-grade flaxseed oil is cold-pressed, obtained without solvent extraction, in the absence of oxygen, and marketed as edible flaxseed oil. Fresh, refrigerated and unprocessed, linseed oil is used as a nutritional supplement and is a traditional European ethnic food, highly regarded for its nutty flavor. Regular flaxseed oil contains between 57% and 71% polyunsaturated fats (alpha-linolenic acid, linoleic acid). Plant breeders have developed flaxseed with both higher ALA (70%) and very low ALA content (&lt; 3%). The USFDA granted generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status for high alpha linolenic flaxseed oil.

==Modified linseed oils==

===Stand oil===
Stand oil is generated by heating linseed oil near 300 °C for a few days in the complete absence of air. Under these conditions, the polyunsaturated fatty esters convert to conjugated dienes, which then undergo Diels-Alder reactions, leading to crosslinking. The product, which is highly viscous, gives highly uniform coatings that &quot;dry&quot; to more elastic coatings than linseed oil itself. Soybean oil can be treated similarly, but converts more slowly. On the other hand, tung oil converts very quickly, being complete in minutes at 260 °C. Coatings prepared from stand oils are less prone to yellowing than are coatings derived from the parent oils.

===Boiled linseed oil===
Boiled linseed oil is a combination of raw linseed oil, stand oil (see above), and metallic oil drying agents (catalysts to accelerate drying). In the Medieval era, linseed oil was boiled with lead oxide (litharge) to give a product called boiled linseed oil. The lead oxide forms lead &quot;soaps&quot; (lead oxide is alkaline) that promote hardening (polymerisation) of linseed oil by reaction with atmospheric oxygen. Heating shortens its drying time.

=== Raw linseed oil ===
Raw linseed oil is the base oil, unprocessed and without driers or thinners. It is mostly used as a feedstock for making a boiled oil. It does not cure sufficiently well or quickly to be regarded as a drying oil. Raw linseed is sometimes used for oiling cricket bats to increase surface friction for better ball control. It was also used to treat leather flat belt drives to reduce slipping.

<doc id="295712" wikidata="Q1198969" url="?curid=295712" title="Young Zaphod Plays It Safe">
<text>&quot;Young Zaphod Plays It Safe&quot; is a short story by Douglas Adams set in his &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; universe. It is included with several collections but has never been released as a standalone work. It first appeared in &quot;The Utterly Utterly Merry Comic Relief Christmas Book&quot; (1986) which Adams also co-edited. A slightly revised version appeared in the 1996 anthology &quot;The Wizards of Odd&quot;, edited by Peter Haining. The story then appeared (though not always the revised version) in some omnibus editions of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, as well as the Adams retrospective &quot;The Salmon of Doubt&quot;, and the 2013 anthology &quot;The Time Traveler&#x27;s Almanac&quot;.

==Plot==
The story is a prequel to the events in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; and has the young Zaphod Beeblebrox working as a salvage ship operator. He guides some bureaucrats to a crashed and sunken spaceship on an unnamed planet that may be leaking some dangerous materials, radioactive, toxic and otherwise hazardous by-products which were destined to be thrown into a black hole. The bureaucrats swear that it is &quot;perfectly safe.&quot; When asked why they want to see it if that is true, they claim that they &quot;like looking at things that are perfectly safe.&quot; The ship crashed and sank because its captain had become obsessed with catching and eating lobsters from the planet&#x27;s oceans. Only one crew member is found alive, having taken shelter in a life-support tank.

Throughout the story, it is emphasised that there is something particularly dangerous on board that ought to have been utterly destroyed, but is feared to have escaped.

Ultimately, it is revealed that the dangerous cargo was actually a trio of identical &quot;Designer People&quot;. Their personalities seem totally benign, which is what makes them so dangerous. The ship is filled with substances so hazardous that they are safe because no real person willing to use them would be allowed anywhere near them. However, the Designer People, products of a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation project, have custom-made personalities that cannot naturally exist. There is &quot;nothing they will not do if allowed, and there is nothing they will not be allowed to do.&quot; Since no one will recognise that they are capable of causing mass destruction, no one will stop them from doing the unspeakable.

The story culminates with the revelation that one of the Designer People has escaped and is traveling to Galactic Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha, which is where the Earth was located in the original &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. The bureaucrats issue orders for that sector to be made &quot;perfectly safe.&quot;

Since this story takes place before Zaphod decides to block off sections of his own brains and run for President of the Galaxy, readers are able to glimpse what his original personality was like. His general speech patterns and goof-off personality are the same, but he seems to have moral views and is more likely to go off on life-threatening and exciting quests for the greater good.

== Notes ==
Though it is not stated specifically in the original 1986 version, Adams implies that this unspeakably dangerous creation is then-President Ronald Reagan, a reflection of his critical views of Reagan&#x27;s policies which also surface in &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot;. The version of the story first seen in &quot;The Wizards of Odd&quot; makes this explicit.

<text>Fabian Gotthard von Steinheil (, tr. ; 3 October 1762 – 7 March 1831) was a Baltic German who served as a Russian military officer and the Governor-General of Finland between 1810 and 1824.

Steinheil was born in Hapsal, Estonia. His father&#x27;s family was from region of Upper Rhine in Germany (where they had been burghers and officials of their hometowns); and his mother was from a cadet branch of the ancient Baltic House of Tiesenhausen, daughter of nobleman Frommhold Fabian Tiesenhausen, lord of Orina in Estonia. Stenheil&#x27;s uncle and father had received a baronial title from the imperial authorities.

Fabian von Steinheil became a lieutenant in the Imperial Russian Army in 1782. He took part in the war in Finland in 1788 and in 1791-92 he worked with construction of fortifications in Old Finland, after which he served in military cartography.

He became a Major General in 1798 and took part in the campaigns in Prussia in 1806-1807 and Poland in 1805-1807. He became a Lieutenant General in 1807 and commanded the Russian troops on Åland in 1809 during the Finnish War.

In 1810 he was appointed as the Governor-General of Finland, to succeed Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly. He was well regarded by the Finnish population and was made a count in 1812. In 1812 he was defeated at Mesoten, but then fought under the prolific General Wittgenstein at Polotsk. In 1813 he took part in the war against Napoleon as the commander of an army in Courland and Livonia, and was succeeded as Governor-General by the influential Count Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt. However, due to Armfelt&#x27;s fragile health, Steinheil soon returned to the post of Governor-General which he held to 1823, being then succeeded by Count Arseniy Zakrevskiy.

He remained in Finland and died in Helsingfors in 1831.
