<text>Francis Thomas Avallone (born September 18, 1940), better known as Frankie Avalon, is an American singer, actor and former teen idol. He had 31 charting U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; singles from 1958 to late 1962, including number one hits, &quot;Venus&quot; and &quot;Why&quot; in 1959.

Avalon started appearing in films in the 1960s; he is well-known for having appeared in the Beach party films of this decade and for a supporting role in the 1978 musical film &quot;Grease&quot;, in which he sings the song &quot;Beauty School Dropout&quot;.

==Early life and education ==
Avalon was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Italian-American parents Mary and Nicholas Avallone. His mother was originally from Sicily. His father was a butcher who was born in Philadelphia, whose father Francesco was from Salerno, in Campania, Italy, and whose mother was from Sicily.

==Career==
===1950s===
In December 1952, Avalon made his American network television debut playing the trumpet in the Honeymooners &quot;Christmas Party&quot; sketch on &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;. Two singles showcasing Avalon&#x27;s trumpet playing were issued on RCA Victor&#x27;s X sublabel in 1954. His trumpet playing was also featured on some of his LP songs as well. As a teenager, he played with Bobby Rydell in Rocco and the Saints.

In 1959, &quot;Venus&quot;, which was a number one single for five consecutive weeks, and &quot;Why&quot; went to number one on the Billboard Hot 100. &quot;Why&quot; was the last number one hit of the 1950s.

Avalon had 31 charted U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; singles from 1958 to late 1962, including &quot;Just Ask Your Heart&quot; (U.S. No. 7), &quot;I&#x27;ll Wait for You&quot; (U.S. No. 5), &quot;Bobby Sox to Stockings&quot; (U.S. No. 8), and &quot;A Boy Without a Girl&quot; (U.S. No. 10). He was less popular in the U.K., but did still manage four chart hits with &quot;Why&quot;, &quot;Ginger Bread&quot;, &quot;Venus&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Throw Away All Those Teardrops&quot;. Most of his hits were written and/or produced by Bob Marcucci, head of Chancellor Records. Avalon concentrated on his acting career which detracted from his recording career, and &quot;Why&quot; of 1959 would be Avalon&#x27;s final top 10 hit.

Avalon&#x27;s first film was a short appearance in &quot;Jamboree&quot; (1957), playing a trumpet and singing &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot;.

In the late 1950s, teen idols were often given roles in films, supporting older male stars in order to attract a younger audience, such as Ricky Nelson in &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; (1959). Alan Ladd&#x27;s daughter was a Frankie Avalon fan, who recommended that he co-star with her father in the Western &quot;Guns of the Timberland&quot; (1960). Avalon sings two songs, &quot;The Faithful Kind&quot; and &quot;Gee Whiz Whillikins Golly Gee&quot;; both were released as singles.

Ladd announced he would reteam Avalon and his daughter in &quot;Six Steps to Freedom&quot; but the film was never made.

===1960s===

Rushes for &quot;Timberland&quot; were seen by John Wayne, who was looking for a young actor to play the (fictitious) role of &quot;Smitty&quot; in his passion project, &quot;The Alamo&quot; (1960). Avalon was cast in his second dramatic part. After making the film Wayne told the press: &quot;We&#x27;re not cutting one bit of any scene in which Frankie appears. I believe he is the finest young talent I&#x27;ve seen in a long time.&quot; &quot;Mr Wayne said I was natural as far as acting goes,&quot; said Avalon. He added: &quot;My ambition when I was ten years old was to have my own band like Harry James. I never expected anything like this... I&#x27;d like to be identified as a singer, dancer, and actor. I don&#x27;t want to be just one thing.&quot;

&quot;I like to appeal to teenagers and adults,&quot; he said in 1960. &quot;Everybody&quot;.

Avalon was now in demand as an actor. He provided the singing voice for the lead character in the English-language version of a Japanese musical anime, &quot;Alakazam the Great&quot; (1960), which was done at the behest of the US distributor, American International Pictures. It was the first in what would be a long association with that company.

For Irwin Allen, Avalon had a small role and sang the title song in the science fiction adventure film, &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; (1961), a solid commercial hit. He had a supporting role in a comedy, &quot;Sail a Crooked Ship&quot; (1961).

Avalon was teamed with Ray Milland in the science fiction film, &quot;Panic in Year Zero!&quot; (1962), written by Lou Rusoff. Samuel Z. Arkoff of American International Pictures (AIP) said Avalon and Milland were teamed together because &quot;they both have particular types of followers and the combination adds up to an attraction&quot;.

For AIP, Avalon made a war film with Tab Hunter, &quot;Operation Bikini&quot; (1963), singing a few songs in flashback. At MGM, he played the lead in an adventure film set in Africa, &quot;Drums of Africa&quot; (1963).

Of more significance for Avalon&#x27;s career was a project originally written by Rusoff, &quot;Beach Party&quot; (1963). This cheerful pop rock-and-roll musical comedy starred Annette Funicello and was directed by William Asher. Arkoff said AIP originally wanted Fabian Forte to co-star with Funicello, but when he proved unavailable, they went with Avalon; it was a big hit and led to several sequels. &quot;Filmink&quot; wrote &quot;Avalon’s warm persona and slightly cartoonish vibe were ideal for the beach party movies, with their in-jokes, double-takes, songs and silliness.&quot;

Avalon received an offer to appear in a swashbuckler set in 10th century Spain about Fernán González of Castile, &quot;The Castilian&quot; (1963). This was followed by the &quot;Beach Party&quot; sequel, &quot;Muscle Beach Party&quot; (1963), which proved to be popular. Even more so was the third in the film series &quot;Bikini Beach&quot; (1964), where Avalon had a dual role. In August 1964, Avalon announced he had signed to make ten films in five years for AIP.

&quot;Pajama Party&quot; (1964) was the unofficial fourth film in the series; it was a science fiction spoof in which Avalon ceded the leading man duties to Tommy Kirk, retaining a cameo. He was back as the leading man in &quot;Beach Blanket Bingo&quot; (1965). He later recalled: &quot;That&#x27;s the picture of mine that I think people remember best, and it was just a lot of kids having a lot of fun ... a picture about young romance and about the opposition of adults and old people ... also fun because we got to learn how to fake skydive out of an airplane.&quot;

Avalon also appeared in nearly two dozen TV episodes, including ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Bing Crosby Show&quot; and &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;, appearing often as himself. Later, he became a national television spokesperson for Sonic Drive-In. In 1965, he appeared in the &quot;Combat!&quot; TV series episode &quot;Brother, Brother&quot; as a childhood friend of Pfc. Kirby, played by Jack Hogan. Avalon and Tuesday Weld supported Bob Hope in the comedy film, &quot;I&#x27;ll Take Sweden&quot; (1965) for Edward Small. 

According to &quot;Filmink&quot; AIP gave &quot;Avalon three terrific non-beach chances in 1965 – the studio really looked after him with a series of roles that were utterly perfect for the singer.&quot; These were &quot;Ski Party&quot;, &quot;Sergeant Deadhead&quot;, and &quot;Dr Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine&quot;. &quot;Ski Party&quot; teamed him with Dwayne Hickman and was copy of &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; (1959). &quot;Sergeant Deadhead&quot; (1965) was a military comedy with Avalon in another dual role. He had a cameo on &quot;How to Stuff a Wild Bikini&quot; (1965). The box office performance of these last few films was disappointing, especially &quot;Sergeant Deadhead&quot;, for which sequels had been planned. More popular was AIP&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine&quot; (1965), a comedy with Vincent Price and Hickman. This was liked well enough to justify a sequel, although Avalon did not appear; Fabian Forte took over the Avalon role. In January 1966, Avalon said he no longer wanted to make beach films. &quot;Even a seagull leaves the beach from time to time, and I&#x27;m getting a little sick of sand.&quot;

AIP tried to find a new starring formula for Avalon, casting him as a stock car driver in &quot;Fireball 500&quot; (1966), alongside Fabian and Funicello, for director William Asher. It was a medium financial success and led to other AIP stock car films, though none had Avalon starring in them. For Harry Alan Towers and AIP he played the lead role in &quot;The Million Eyes of Sumuru&quot; (1967), and also had a solid role in &quot;Skidoo&quot; (1968), a comedy from Otto Preminger. In England, he was in AIP&#x27;s &quot;The Haunted House of Horror&quot; (1968). &quot;Filmink&quot; argued &quot;Skidoo&quot; &quot;essentially killed Avalon&#x27;s career as a movie star.&quot;

===1970s===
In the early 1970s Avalon unsuccessfully tried to see finance for a biopic on Willie Pep. He appeared in less movies. &quot;Filmink&quot; argued &quot;his great strength as a performer (his individuality), was limiting for him as a movie star.&quot;

In 1976, Avalon updated his song &quot;Venus&quot; with a new disco treatment. Materializing as a character called Teen Angel, his performance of &quot;Beauty School Dropout&quot; in the hit 1978 film of the musical &quot;Grease&quot; introduced Avalon to a new generation of viewers. Frankie Valli, who had turned the role down in favor of singing the theme song, noted that both he and Avalon earned substantial profits and a boost in their careers from their work on the film.

In early 1979, Avalon portrayed Sergei in the episode &quot;Dewey and Harold and Sarah and Maggie&quot; of the NBC television series &quot;$weepstake$&quot;.

===1980s===
The 1980 film &quot;The Idolmaker&quot;, written by Ed Di Lorenzo and directed by Taylor Hackford, was a thinly-disguised biography of Avalon (&quot;Tommy Dee&quot; in the film) as well as 1950s teenage star Fabian Forte (called &quot;Caesare&quot; in the film), along with songwriter/producer Bob Marcucci (called &quot;Vinnie Vacarri&quot;). In the film, Dee clashes with the record producer and younger singer Caesare, who he feels threatens his career. Eventually, Dee and Caesare quit the label, but their record careers collapse just as the British Invasion begins. The real Fabian threatened a lawsuit, despite the filmmakers&#x27; insistence that the film presented only fictional characters (though Marcucci was a paid consultant). Avalon denied most of the film&#x27;s events.

In 1980, Avalon appeared in the film &quot;Blood Song&quot; as Paul Foley, a serial killer. The movie was shot in October-November 1980 in North Bend/Coos Bay, Oregon. It was released in October 1982.

Avalon also appeared in the &quot;Happy Days&quot; episode &quot;Poobah Doo Dah&quot; playing himself where he sings his hits &quot;Venus&quot; and &quot;Why&quot;.

Avalon had the idea of returning to beach party films with Funicello. He hired several screenwriters and shopped the screenplay around town, eventually managing to set up the project at Paramount Pictures. &quot;Back to the Beach&quot; (1987) was a moderate success.

In 1989, Avalon and Funicello appeared as themselves in cameo roles, out jogging the streets in &quot;Troop Beverly Hills&quot;. Not long afterward Funicello retired, having been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.

Avalon then turned to marketing and created Frankie Avalon Products, a line of health and cosmetic aids. He promoted his products on the Home Shopping Network.

===1990s===
Avalon made a cameo appearance as himself with Robert De Niro in the 1995 film, &quot;Casino&quot;.

===2000s===

Avalon has starred in stage productions of &quot;Grease&quot; in the role of Teen Angel and in &quot;Tony n&#x27; Tina&#x27;s Wedding&quot; as a caricature of himself. In 2001, he appeared as himself in the Sabrina The Teenage Witch episode &#x27;Beach Blanket Bizarro.&#x27;

Additionally, in 2007, he performed &quot;Beauty School Dropout&quot; with the four remaining female contenders (Kathleen Monteleone, Allie Schulz, Ashley Spencer, and winner Laura Osnes) for the role of Sandy on the NBC television reality show &quot;.&quot;

On April 8, 2009, Avalon performed on &quot;American Idol&quot;.

As part of a long-running concert tour, Avalon has toured with fellow Philadelphian early 1960s teen idols Fabian and Bobby Rydell under the banner &quot;Dick Fox&#x27;s Golden Boys&quot;.

===2010s===
A cookbook with over 80 recipes from St. Martin&#x27;s Press, &quot;Frankie Avalon&#x27;s Italian Family Cookbook&quot;, was published in 2015.

===2020s===
On October 18, 2021, Avalon performed on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Avalon married Kathryn &quot;Kay&quot; Diebel on January 19, 1963. She was a beauty pageant winner he met while playing cards at a friend&#x27;s house. 

The Avalons have eight children. His son Frankie Jr. is a former actor who appeared in the original &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;.

==Legacy and popular culture references==

Avalon was mentioned in the System of a Down song &quot;Old School Hollywood&quot;. The song supposedly is about Daron Malakian&#x27;s experience in a celebrity baseball game, where he and Avalon were both ignored.

Avalon is also mentioned in &quot;It Takes Two&quot;, a song from the hit musical &quot;Hairspray&quot;, sung by the character Link Larkin, and in a song by the Wu-Tang Clan called &quot;The City&quot; which refers to his experiences of being a big part of the beach party film genre (&quot;Ride the wave like Frankie Avalon&quot;).

One of numerous obscure cultural references present in Midway&#x27;s video game &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; was a lo-res image of Frankie Avalon&#x27;s face that would dart up in the lower right-hand corner of the screen when Goro killed his opponent by knocking him into the spike pit on the Bridge level.

His song &quot;Venus&quot; was featured in Cranium Command (1989–2005), an attraction at Epcot&#x27;s Wonders of Life Pavilion (now closed) at Walt Disney World. In the attraction, a 12-year-old boy named Bobby (Scott Curtis), tries to survive the pressures of life and falls in love with a beautiful girl named Annie (Natalie Gregory) at school.

Avalon and his song &quot;Venus&quot; are mentioned in Wendy Wasserstein&#x27;s 2005 play &quot;Third&quot;. The main character, English professor Laurie Jameson, watches a PBS reunion show featuring Avalon singing the song, and sings a line of it to her daughter. In stage productions of the show, part of the song is played and a portion of the supposed PBS special is screened as part of the scenery.

Avalon is also referenced in the 1994 film, &quot;The Stöned Age&quot;, in which he makes an ending scene cameo appearance.

His song &quot;Venus&quot; additionally appeared in season 4 of the TV series &quot;Dexter&quot; in which John Lithgow&#x27;s character, Arthur Mitchell, plays it to remember his deceased sister. Also, &quot;Venus&quot; is sampled in Nick Bertke&#x27;s, single, &quot;J&#x27;Adore Juin&quot;, a mashup of sounds from the movie The Apartment.
&quot;Venus&quot; also appeared in the 2016 film &quot;10 Cloverfield Lane&quot; starring John Goodman.

Avalon is also mentioned in The Vaccines&#x27; song &quot;Teenage Icon&quot;.

<doc id="305502" wikidata="Q10233" url="?curid=305502" title="VVS Laxman">
<text>Vangipurapu Venkata Sai Laxman (; born 1 November 1974) is an Indian former international cricketer and a former cricket commentator and pundit. A right-handed batsman known for his elegant stroke play, Laxman played as a middle-order batsman in Test cricket. Laxman is currently the Head of Cricket at the National Cricket Academy (NCA), and the head coach of the India Under-19 and India A teams. Laxman was a member of the Indian team that was one of the joint-winners of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy, the title being shared with Sri Lanka.

Laxman is one of the few players to have played 100 Test matches, without ever appearing in a Cricket World Cup. Despite being a relatively slow runner between the wickets, Laxman compensated with his stroke play and fast scoring. In 2002, he was named one of &quot;Wisden&quot;&#x27;s five Cricketers of the Year. He was considered to be a part of the original &quot;Fab Four&quot;

In domestic cricket, Laxman represented Hyderabad. He also played for Lancashire in county cricket. He was also the captain of the Deccan Chargers team in the Indian Premier League during its inaugural season. Later, he played for the Kochi Tuskers team. He was the mentor of the Sunrisers Hyderabad until 2021. He is popularly called the &#x27;God of 4th Innings&#x27; for his exploits in Tests.

In 2011, Laxman was awarded the Padma Shri award, India&#x27;s fourth highest civilian award. In 2012, he retired from international cricket.

==Personal life==
Laxman was born in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh (present-day Telangana). Laxman&#x27;s parents are physicians Shantaram and Satyabhama of Vijayawada. Laxman is the great-grandnephew of India&#x27;s second President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.

Laxman studied at the Little Flower High School, Hyderabad. Though he joined a medical school for his undergraduate studies, Laxman chose cricket as a career.

He married G. R. Shailaja, a Computer Applications graduate from Guntur, on 16 February 2004. They have two children.

==Playing style and position==
Laxman is known for his fluid style, technical soundness and aggressiveness. Sambit Bal of ESPN Crincinfo writes: &quot;At his sublime best, VVS Laxman is a sight for the gods. Wristy, willowy and sinuous, he can match – sometimes even better – Tendulkar for strokeplay... [He] has the rare gift of being able to hit the same ball to either side.&quot; He was equally skilled against both pace and spin, with great timing and outstanding ability to place the ball splitting the tightest field positions. Laxman was particularly skillful in using his wrists (reminiscent of his role model and fellow Hyderabadi, Mohammed Azharuddin) that allowed him to place the same ball to different areas of the field.

Standing tall and still at the crease, Laxman had a keen awareness of the off-stump and a polished ability to dispatch the bad ball. He plays with a high elbow and a steady stance and a textbook technique with natural elegance and flair. At the start of his career, Laxman was rated by Geoffrey Boycott as one of India&#x27;s best players of the hard (new) ball. However, Indian selectors played around with his batting positions, whenever India felt a lacuna regarding any batting number. He was forced to play in almost every position, including opening. Laxman found his home in the middle order, where he played most of his best innings, batting at numbers 3, 5 and 6. In a 2001 test against Australia and promoted to no. 3 in the second innings from his first innings position of 6, he scored 281 to take India to a huge lead after following on. Though Laxman was ideally suited for No. 3, Rahul Dravid was always preferred over him to bat at one-down, while Sachin Tendulkar was established at No. 4. As a result, Laxman played around 63 percent of his Test innings at No. 5 or 6. This meant that Laxman often found himself batting with tail-end batsmen, and is reflected in his final statistics, which show that he has a relatively high proportion of not out innings (34 of 225, or 15 per cent — for comparison, Tendulkar finished not out in around 10 per cent of his Test innings, and Dravid in 11 per cent). Nevertheless, Laxman batted particularly well with non-specialist lower-order batsmen, and was able, with their support, to save and win numerous matches for India (for example, the Mohali 2010 Test against Australia).

==Youth career==
Laxman made his Under-19 debut for India against Australia in February 1994. Batting at six, he made 88 in his debut innings against a bowling attack that consisted of Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie, both of whom were making their debuts too. In the second game of the series, Laxman scored an unbeaten 151 in the first innings and 77 in the second innings to help his team register a 226-run victory. He continued his good form as he scored 36 and 84 in the third game to end up as the leading run-scorer of the series. The Test series was followed by a 3-match ODI series, where he managed scores of 24, 22 and 77. Later in August that year, the India Under-19 team toured England for 2 ODIs and 3 Test matches. Laxman disappointed in the ODIs with scores of 20 and 5. However, in the first Test he struck 119 in the first innings, but did not get to bat in the second innings as India cruised to a 9-wicket win. He made only 28 in the second match and 4 in the third.

==Domestic career==
Laxman made his first-class debut for Hyderabad against Punjab in the quarter-final match of 1992–93 Ranji Trophy season. He scored a duck in the first innings and 17 in the second. He played only one match for Hyderabad in the next season, before getting dropped. However, he was named in the South Zone squad for the 1994–95 Duleep Trophy in the back of his impressive outings for India Under-19s, but he failed to score big in the tournament. In the following Ranji Trophy season, Laxman notched up 532 runs from five matches at an average of 76 scoring two centuries. In the semi-final of the Duleep Trophy of 1995–96 season against West Zone, Laxman scored 47 in the first innings and a spectacular 121 in the second innings, sharing a 199-run partnership with skipper Rahul Dravid. He had another brilliant Ranji season the next year, as he piled 775 runs in just 11 innings at an average of 86 with 3 centuries and a best of 203* that came against Karnataka in the semi-final, which Hyderabad eventually lost. He was picked to play for Rest of India against Karnataka in the Irani Cup and also in the Board President&#x27;s XI squad against the touring Australian team. He played only three matches in 1996–97 Ranji season, where he scored three half-centuries, before getting picked for the Indian Test team against South Africa.

After the tests he joined Lancashire as their overseas player in place of Brad Hodge. He played in five games of the county championship and showed glimpses of his sublime batting. In their final County Championship game of 2007, against Surrey at the Oval, Laxman scored a century in the second innings in which Lancashire were chasing 489 to win. They just missed out by 25 runs and subsequently lost the Championship to Sussex. His performance for Lancashire was good with 380 runs scored in 5 matches at an average of 54.28 with 2 centuries and 2 half-centuries

Laxman was supposed to replace Adam Voges for Nottinghamshire, but this move was vetoed by the BCCI due to the fact that there were players from the rival Indian Cricket League playing for Nottinghamshire.

===Indian Premier League===
Laxman was originally named as the Icon Player for his home franchise Deccan Chargers before the first season of the IPL. But he gave up the Icon Player status in a bid to allow his team spend a bigger purse at the auction. The Deccan Chargers bought him at the auction for $375,000 and named him the captain for the first season. However, Laxman dropped himself from the team halfway through the season, after the team had a horrendous run in the tournament. Adam Gilchrist took over as captain and led the side in the next two seasons as well; Laxman did score 155 runs from the 6 games that he played at an average of 31 and strike rate of 118. He batted at 3 in the first few games before opening the innings with Gilchrist in some matches where he found more success. His only half-century of the tournament (52 off 44) came against Royal Challengers Bangalore. He did score a couple more fluent innings that season including an unbeaten 37 from 26 balls against Mumbai Indians and 48 from 34 balls against Kings XI Punjab. However, he struggled with the bat in the next two seasons and sat out the tournament after playing only 5–6 matches.

At the mega-auction in 2011, Laxman was bought by the newly formed franchise of Kochi Tuskers Kerala for $400,000. This time, though, he was injured after the first three games and missed the rest of the season. In the first match against Royal Challengers, he opened the innings with Brendon McCullum and scored an attractive 36 from 29 deliveries. But, the Kochi franchise was terminated later that year and all the players of the team were put in the auction in 2012. However, Laxman, who had a base price of $400,000, found no buyers and he couldn&#x27;t participate in the 2012 edition of the tournament. Then in IPL 2013, he was appointed as a mentor for Sunrisers Hyderabad Team.

==International career==
===Early years (1996–2000)===
Laxman made his Test debut in 1996 against South Africa at Ahmedabad, scoring a fifty in the second innings of the match. In the second game at Kolkata, he scored 14 and 1. He played just one Test in the South African tour the following month and was unable to cement his place in a star-studded Indian middle order. Instead, he was asked to open the innings, starting in West Indies in 1997. At Kingston, he scored 64 in his first innings as opener. However, he averaged only 28 in that series playing as an opener. But intermittently continued in this role for nearly three years, but without any consistent success. In 1998 at Calcutta, he scored 95 against Australia opening the innings with Navjot Sidhu who scored 97. India went on to win the match by an innings and 219 runs. Though he was selected in the Test squad that toured New Zealand in 1998, he did not get to play a single game as Ajay Jadeja was preferred over Laxman to open the innings with Sidhu. Laxman scored a duck on his ODI debut against Zimbabwe in the Pepsi Tri-Series in 1998. He had a horrible run in the ODIs in 1998 which resulted in him getting dropped from the ODI team for more than a year. Against Pakistan in 1999, he scored just 66 runs from two Tests, averaging a modest 16. In the first match of the Asian Test Championship later that year, Laxman scored 67 against Pakistan, but failed to score consistently, before getting dropped from the Test team as well.

Laxman returned to playing first-class cricket in 1999 to regain his place in the national team. In the 1999–2000 season of Ranji Trophy, he broke the record for most runs in a Ranji season when he made 1415 runs, at an average of 108, in just 9 matches notching up eight hundreds – a record that still remains intact. His performance was rewarded when, in January 2000, he was recalled in the Indian squad for the Australian tour. He scored 167 in the third and final Test match at Sydney when the rest of the batsmen struggled to cope with Glenn McGrath&#x27;s destructive bowling, a rare high point for India in an otherwise disastrous tour. Despite this success against an attack containing both McGrath and Shane Warne, Laxman apparently decided that he would return to domestic cricket, rather than continue playing as opener, a role which he believed did not suit him. As a result, Laxman was out of the Test team for nearly a year. He was recalled in late 2000, and also found a spot in the side for the home series against Australia in 2001.

===Golden series (2001 against Australia)===
Laxman&#x27;s career changed dramatically in the 2001 home series against Australia. In the first Test at Mumbai, Laxman made 20 and 12, as the entire Indian batting line-up, with the exception of Sachin Tendulkar, capitulated, leading to a 10-wicket defeat. This was Australia&#x27;s 16th consecutive Test win and extended their own world record.

In the next Test at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, however, Laxman produced a match-winning and series-defining performance. After scoring 59 in the first innings, Laxman shot to fame with an extraordinary knock of 281 in the second innings (following on) when under tremendous pressure and with Australia looking set for a crushing 17th win in a row. He broke Sunil Gavaskar&#x27;s long standing Indian Test record score of 236*. This remained the highest ever by an Indian until it was eclipsed by Virender Sehwag&#x27;s triple ton against Pakistan in Multan in March 2004. The innings also contributed to a record partnership of 376 with Rahul Dravid who made 180 and together they survived the whole 4th day. Laxman&#x27;s performance was of enormous consequence: India had been on the brink of an innings defeat but went on to win the Test and the series, denying Steve Waugh&#x27;s conquest of the &quot;final frontier&quot;. This was only the third time in the history of cricket that a team had managed to win a Test after being forced to follow on. It has become one of the most celebrated tales of Indian cricket, and the innings is ranked the sixth best Test innings ever by Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack. At the time, the pitch was taking significant turn, and to negate Laxman&#x27;s free scoring, Australian leg spinner Shane Warne pitched his deliveries into the footmarks outside leg stump. However, such was Laxman&#x27;s play that he consistently drove the ball through long on for boundaries against the spin, something that is considered to be technically dangerous. When Warne attempted to stop Laxman from scoring by defensively stationing most of the fielders on the leg side (leg theory) and bowling outside leg stump, Laxman proceeded to skip down the pitch and drive Warne inside-out through the vacant off side, hitting through the line of a substantially turning ball. Warne later admitted that he was clueless as to how to stop Laxman.

Laxman went on to score 65 and 66 in the third and the final Test match at Chennai, which India won by 2 wickets and won the series 2–1. Laxman had great amount of success batting at No.3 in the ODI series that followed the Tests, as he scored 45, 51, 83, 11 and 101 in the five games, thus cementing his spot in the ODI line-up as well. In the Coca-Cola Tri-Series later that year in Sri Lanka, Laxman scored 212 runs in 7 matches with two fifties and a decent average of 36.

===Permanent member (2002–2004)===
Laxman then cemented his place both in the Test and one day teams for a few years. After bad performances in the Test series against Zimbabwe, he did well in the first two ODIs scoring 75 and 52, but couldn&#x27;t convert the starts into big knocks in the next three matches. Laxman managed to score a fighting 89 in the second Test at Port Elizabeth, when the rest of the team struggled to survive against Shaun Pollock&#x27;s deadly bowling, helping his team put up 201 on the board and avoid an embarrassing follow-on. Against the touring England in late 2001, he scored 75, sharing a 100-plus run partnership with Tendulkar to take his team out of trouble. He had a great tour of West Indies, as he scored 474 runs in 8 innings at an average of 79. He had scores of 69, 69*, 74, 1, 43, 130, 65* and 23 in that series. He performed reasonably well during West Indies tour of India as well, particularly in the third match at Kolkata, where he scored 48 and 154*. He followed it up with brilliant showing in the 7-match ODI series as well with scores of 47, 99, 66 and 71 in the first five games. But his form dropped during India&#x27;s tour of New Zealand in 2002–03. In the first Test at Wellington, he got a pair and in the second match he could score only 23 and 4. However, he had a brilliant 2-match Test series against the same team in India as he scored a half-century along with 44 in the first Test and 104* and 67* in the second match. He won the Man of the Series award for his impressive batting performances in the two Test match series. In October 2003, he scored 102 in the first ODI against Australia at Gwalior, sharing a 190-run second wicket partnership with Tendulkar. However he failed to deliver on a consistent basis in ODIs. He continued to perform well against Australia, especially during India&#x27;s tour of Australia in 2003–04, in which he hit three ODI and two Test centuries. He was involved in two century partnerships, one with Tendulkar and the other with Dravid, in the Brisbane ODI against Australia where he remained unbeaten on 102. His 106* against the same opponents at Sydney saw him put up a fourth-wicket partnership of 213 runs with Yuvraj Singh, who scored his career-best 139. In the next ODI against Zimbabwe, Laxman scored a 138-ball 131, once again setting up 2 hundred-run stands. He scored 148 in the famous Adelaide Test, sharing a triple century partnership with Rahul Dravid, which India won by 4 wickets. This was their first Test victory in Australia in two decades. His innings of 178 at Sydney also came in a triple century partnership, on this occasion with Sachin Tendulkar. India went on to post 705/7 in their first innings which is their highest total in Test cricket. Laxman scored a total of 494 runs from the 4 Tests at a staggering average of 82. During this series, Ian Chappell described Laxman as &quot;Very Very Special&quot; Laxman. His 107 (104) against Pakistan in the fifth and the final ODI at Lahore, helped India win by 40 runs and clinch the series 3–2.

===Decline of form (2004–2005)===
However, Laxman&#x27;s form was on the decline since the series against Australia. Beginning with the series in Pakistan in 2004, Laxman had only Test centuries to his credit, with one coming against a weak Zimbabwe side. He averaged just 31 in the Test series in Pakistan in 3 matches. His only half-century (71) came in a high-scoring game at Rawalpindi where India made a mammoth 600 to win the game by an innings and 131 runs. He struggled to score in the ODI series in England which put question marks over his future in the shorter format. He struggled against his favourite opponents Australia in the home series in October–November 2004, although his 69 in the low-scoring final Test at Mumbai was instrumental for India to record a consolation victory. He had a mixed Test series against Pakistan in 2005. He scored 58 in the first Test, 0 and 24 in the second and 79* and 5 in the third. He batted well in the Sri Lanka Test series scoring a fifty at Delhi and a crucial century (104) in the last match at Ahmedabad. Laxman was dropped after scoring a duck in the first Test against England at Nagpur in March 2006. He regained his place for the tour of the West Indies in place of the injured Tendulkar, and made a hundred in the third Test. He also scored a resilient 63 in the second innings to deny West Indies the victory in the same match. In ODIs, Laxman was left out persistently since Greg Chappell took over as coach in mid-2005, mainly on account of his slow ground fielding and running between the wickets; Laxman is a highly regarded close-catching fielder in stationary positions but in ODIs, these positions are generally disused except for the opening phases of the match, and players otherwise have to patrol substantial spaces and retrieve balls. Another reason was a perception that his batting is too one paced for ODI cricket and that he lacks the ability to score at a high rate as required when the batting team has the momentum, or in the closing stages of the innings. This was despite his superb form in Australia and Pakistan in early 2004, when he made four centuries in 14 games, including three in a week in the VB Series in Australia.

===Return to form===
In December 2005, Laxman helped India to victory against Sri Lanka with a fine century. In June 2006, Laxman again rescued India from a difficult position against the West Indies with a gritty century. In November 2006, he was selected in the test squad for India&#x27;s tour of South Africa. In the first test in Johannesburg Laxman scored 73 in the second innings to help India claim a historic 123 run win. In the 2007 tour of England Laxman produced three good innings, two of which were half-centuries and a vital 39 that helped India draw the first test at Lords. He passed the 5000 run landmark in the first day of the final test.

In India&#x27;s home series against Pakistan in 2007, V.V.S. Laxman once again showed his importance to the team with a disciplined batting performance in the 1st Test at Delhi, as he scored 72* in dire circumstances. He then followed that innings of 72 in the first test with 112 in the second test. This ensured his place on the tour of Australia which would be his third to that country.

===Late career===
Laxman&#x27;s good form continued in the 2007–08 Test series against Australia with him scoring 109 against Australia on the second day of the controversial Sydney Test to put India back into the contest. It was his 12th hundred in Test matches, and his fifth against Australia. It was also his third consecutive century at SCG, giving him an average well above 90 at the venue. He followed this up with a gritty knock of 79 in Perth, assisted by Mahendra Singh Dhoni and RP Singh, which set India up to record a historic and unexpected victory at a ground on which previously no Asian team had won. He hit 51 in the first innings of the final Test at Adelaide. He finished as the second highest run-getter for India in that series, only behind Sachin Tendulkar.

He, like all other Indian batsmen, struggled in Sri Lanka against the spin duo of Muttiah Muralitharan and Ajantha Mendis later in July–August that year. India lost the first Test by an innings and 239 runs at Colombo, where Laxman&#x27;s first innings score of 50 was the only half-century scored by an Indian batsman in either innings. Laxman scored another fifty in that series, in the third Test, an unbeaten 61 as India went on to lose the game by 8 wickets and the series 2–1. Laxman was dismissed by Mendis on all five occasions in that series. He also crossed the 6000-run milestone during the series.

Against Australia, in the Border–Gavaskar Trophy later that year, Laxman was in top form as he scored 381 runs from 4 Tests with a double-hundred and two fifties. During the third Test at the Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi, Laxman scored an unbeaten 200 in the first innings with characteristic use of his wrists and flicks through the leg side. In the same innings, Gautam Gambhir scored 206, Laxman and Gambhir becoming the first pair of batsmen to score double-centuries in the same innings for India, and the first to do so against Australia. This was his second double-century in Test cricket with the previous one coming against the same opponents. He made an unbeaten 59 in the second innings and was named Man of the Match. The match was also the last game of India&#x27;s spin wizard Anil Kumble who was also the captain of the team. In the final Test at Nagpur, Laxman scored another half-century in the first innings of the match.
In 2009, Laxman continued to be in brilliant form. He had scored 76 and 124* in the 2nd Test at Napier in New Zealand. The century helped India salvage a draw and avoid an innings defeat. In the next match at Wellington he hit a well-composed 61 in the second innings. Against Sri Lanka later that year in a home series, Laxman hit three fifties in four innings as India went on to win the series comfortably. His unbeaten 51 in the second innings combining with a hundred from Tendulkar helped India draw the first Test at Ahmedabad. Laxman scored two fifties in the next two games as India went on to win both matches by an innings.

He injured himself during the first match of the two-match Test series in Bangladesh in January 2010 after scoring another unbeaten half-century. The injury forced him to sit out for three weeks and he returned to action only during the final Test against South Africa held in Kolkata. He scored 143* in a record stand for the seventh wicket with MS Dhoni. The test was eventually won by India by an innings and 57 runs in the last 10 minutes of the fifth day&#x27;s play, despite centuries in both innings from South African batsman Hashim Amla. This victory also helped India draw the Test series and remain the world Number 1 team. He also passed 7000 Test runs during the innings.

Laxman helped India to level the series with Sri Lanka in August 2010 when he hit 103 not out in the run-chase, resulting in a five-wicket win in the Third Test, after scoring 69 in the first innings. He was awarded the Man of the Match for this brilliant effort. He scored a total of 279 runs in that series at an average of 70.

In October, he once again turned around another match that appeared headed for a comfortable Australian victory, in the first Test in Mohali. Laxman was suffering with a back problem and needed Suresh Raina as his runner, and the Indians had collapsed to 124/8 in pursuit of 216. He and paceman Ishant Sharma put on 81 to take the score to 205 before Sharma fell. Last man Pragyan Ojha then managed to survive till the end as the hosts completed a thrilling one-wicket win. Laxman ended on 73 not out. He was ruled out of the remaining matches of the series due to his injury. In November, he helped India recover from 15/5 in the second innings of the first Test against New Zealand at Ahmedabad and the match was drawn. In the second match of the series at his home ground Hyderabad, he scored 74 and the match ended in another draw.

After failing in the first Test of the South African tour, Laxman once again helped India to a historic win at Durban. India struggled to cope with Dale Steyn in the first innings before getting bundled out for 205. Laxman&#x27;s 38 was the highest score in that innings. In the second innings, India were struggling at 94/5 and he put on crucial partnerships with Dhoni and Zaheer Khan to help his team to 228, giving South Africa a target of 303. South Africa were bundled out for 215 giving India an 87-run win that helped level the series 1–1. He was awarded the Man of the Match for his match-winning innings of 96.

In three test matches, Laxman scored three consecutive fifties including two scores in eighties against the West Indies during India&#x27;s tour of West Indies in June 2011.

===Retirement===
During India&#x27;s Tour to England, Laxman scored just two half-centuries in eight innings as India went down 0–4 to England. This was India&#x27;s first Test series loss since its 2007–08 tour of Australia. Laxman got out with the pull shot frequently in this series, which otherwise he is good at.
As part of West Indies tour to India in September 2011, Laxman scored a magnificent 176 not out in the second test, and India went to win the match by an innings and 13 runs. Laxman was adjudged Man of the Match. India went on to win the series 1–0.

Laxman failed to live to his expectations during India&#x27;s tour of Australia in November 2011, as India went down 0–4 to Australia, with Laxman scoring only two half centuries in eight innings. For the first time in four tours to Australia, Laxman failed to register a century in the series; and also for the first time in four test matches played at Sydney Cricket Ground he failed to touch the three figure mark.

After this series, there were calls from the media and former cricketers that it was time for older players like Laxman, Dravid and Sachin to consider retirement.

On 18 August 2012, Laxman announced his retirement from international cricket. Although he was selected for the upcoming New Zealand series, he opted not to play in the series but he will play in domestic cricket for Hyderabad and the Indian Premier League . It was announced that the northern stand at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium will now be named after him.

===Record against Australia===
Laxman was particularly prolific against Australia, in both Tests and One Day Internationals. Six out of his 17 Test hundreds, and four out of his six ODI hundreds came against Australia. He has two double-centuries in Tests, both against Australia: his personal best of 281 at Kolkata in 2000–01, and 200 not out at Feroz Shah Kotla in 2008–09. The Australians admitted that they did not know where to bowl to him.

==Bowling==
A very occasional bowler at Test level, Laxman took 2 wickets in his test career. One against the West Indies, and the other against Pakistan.

==The Cricket Advisory Committee==

Laxman is one of the member of the elite three-man panel that consists of himself, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly. This three-man panel is known as the Cricket Advisory Committee of BCCI. The Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) was set up by Anurag Thakur (then Secretary) and late BCCI President Jagmohan Dalmiya. This committee was set up to advise BCCI on various issues and to help BCCI with their immense cricketing experience. The Cricket Advisory Committee took several important decisions that includes the recommendation for the selection of Anil Kumble (ex-coach) who stepped down as the coach and recommendation of selection of Ravi Shastri (ex-coach) for the post of coach of the Indian cricket team.

Laxman was also appointed as the batting consultant in Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB)&#x27;s vision 2020 project.

==International centuries==
Laxman made his Test debut against South Africa in November 1996, and took almost four years to score his first century when he scored 167 against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 2000. Laxman&#x27;s next century came against the same team in 2001, when he made 281 at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. The score is the highest individual score in a Test match between India and Australia. It was also the highest individual score by an Indian at that time. In Test matches, Laxman has scored centuries against all the Test cricket playing nations except England and Bangladesh. As of 2012, he is seventh on the list of leading Test century makers for India. Laxman has scored two double centuries and has been dismissed four times between the score of 90 and 99 in test matches.

In ODIs, Laxman has scored six centuries against three countries including four against Australia. His first ODI century was against Australia in the last match of a five match series, held at the Fatorda Stadium in Margao in 2001. His highest score of 131 came against Zimbabwe at the Adelaide Oval in 2004. Two out of his six ODI centuries were scored at home grounds and four were at away (opposition&#x27;s home) or neutral venues. He has been dismissed once between the score of 90 and 99.

<doc id="305503" wikidata="Q1123526" url="?curid=305503" title="Chamber of commerce">
<text>A chamber of commerce, or board of trade, is a form of business network. For example, a local organization of businesses whose goal is to further the interests of businesses. Business owners in towns and cities form these local societies to advocate on behalf of the business community. Local businesses are members, and they elect a board of directors or executive council to set policy for the chamber. The board or council then hires a president, CEO, or executive director, plus staffing appropriate to size, to run the organization.

A chamber of commerce may be a voluntary or a mandatory association of business firms belonging to different trades and industries. They serve as spokespeople and representatives of a business community. They differ from country to country.

==History==
The first chamber of commerce was founded in 1599 in Marseille, France, as the &quot;Chambre de Commerce&quot;. The Royal Barcelona Board of Trade was established in 1758.

The world&#x27;s oldest English-speaking chamber of commerce and oldest chamber of commerce in North America is the Halifax Chamber of Commerce, founded in 1750.

The Glasgow Chamber of Commerce was founded in 1783. However, Hull Chamber of Commerce is the United Kingdom&#x27;s oldest, followed by those of Leeds and of Belfast in present-day Northern Ireland.

As a non-governmental institution, a chamber of commerce has no direct role in the writing and passage of laws and regulations that affect businesses. It can, however, lobby in an attempt to get laws passed that are favorable to businesses.

The United States Chamber of Commerce has a long history of anti-union lobbying and union busting in the United States at the local and federal level.

==Characteristics==
Membership in an individual chamber can range from a few dozen to well over 800,000, as is the case with the Paris Île-de-France Regional Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Some chamber organizations in China report even larger membership numbers. Chambers of commerce can range in scope from individual neighborhoods within a city or town up to an international chamber of commerce.

In the United States, chambers do not operate in the same manner as the Better Business Bureau in that, while the BBB has the authority to bind its members under a formal operation doctrine (and, thus, can remove them if complaints arise regarding their services), the local chamber membership is either voluntary or required by law. Some chambers are partially funded by local government, others are non-profit, and some are a combination of the two.

Some chambers have joined state, national (such as the United States Chamber of Commerce and the British Chambers of Commerce) and even international bodies (such as Eurochambres, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), and Worldchambers).

==Chamber models==
===Community, city and regional chambers===

Chambers of commerce in the United States can be considered community, city, regional, state, or nationwide (United States Chamber of Commerce). City Chambers work on the local level to bring the business community together to develop strong local networks, which can result in a business-to-business exchange. In most cases, city Chambers work with their local government, such as their mayor, their city council, and local representatives to develop pro-business initiatives.
There are also bilateral chambers of commerce that link the business environments of two countries (e.g. Romanian-American Chamber of Commerce, Moldovan–American Chamber of Commerce).

===Community chambers===
Community chambers of commerce started in the UK and later spread to in the US, becoming city chambers of commerce as communities developed and became larger. Community chambers of commerce are smaller and most have a limit on numbers of members.

===City chambers===

City chambers of commerce have a long history in the US. The Charleston Chamber of Commerce is one of the oldest, dating back to colonial 1773. That same year, Boston&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce organized a seminal tax protest: The Boston Tea Party.

In 2005 there were 2,800 chambers of commerce in the United States and 102 chambers representing U.S. businesses overseas. According to the Association for Chamber of Commerce Executives (ACCE), there are approximately 3,000 chambers of commerce with at least one staff person and &quot;thousands more established as strictly volunteer entities&quot;.

===State chambers===
State chambers of commerce are much different from local and regional chambers of commerce, as they work on state and sometimes federal issues impacting the business community. Just as the local chamber is critical to the local business community, state chambers serve a unique function, serving as a third-party voice on important business legislation that impacts the business community and is critical in shaping legislation in their respective state. State Chambers work with their Governor, state representatives, state senators, US congressional leaders, and US Senators. In comparison with state trade associations, which serve as a voice and resource to a particular industry, state chambers are looked to as a respected voice, representing the entire business community to enhance and advocate for a better business environment.

===National and international chambers===
Addressing the national or international need for information is the key service that these chambers of commerce provide. These services are in most cases at no fee or cost to their members; some of them offer personal and/or business services at a very low fee (like memberships to other associations such as the NRA).

===Compulsory or public-law chambers===
Under the compulsory or public law model, enterprises of certain sizes, types, or sectors are obliged to become members of the chamber. This model is common in European Union countries (e.g. France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria), as well as Japan and Indonesia. The main tasks of the chambers are foreign trade promotion, vocational training, regional economic development, and general services to their members. The chambers were given responsibilities of public administration in various fields by the state which they exercise in order management. The chambers also have a consultative function; this means the chambers must be consulted whenever a new law related to industry or commerce is proposed.

In Germany, the chambers of commerce and industry (&quot;IHK - Industrie- und Handelskammer&quot;) and the chambers of skilled crafts (&quot;HwK - Handwerkskammer&quot;) are public statutory bodies with self-administration under the inspectorate of the state ministry of economy. Enterprises are members by law according to the chamber act (&quot;IHK-Gesetz&quot;) of 1956. Because of this, such chambers are much bigger than chambers under private law. IHK Munich, the biggest German chamber of commerce, has 350,000 member companies. Germany also has compulsory chambers for &quot;free occupations&quot; such as architects, dentists, engineers, lawyers, notaries, physicians, and pharmacists.

===Continental/private law chambers===
Under the private model, which exists in English-speaking countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, companies are not obligated to become chamber members. However, companies often become members to develop their business contacts and, regarding the local chambers (the most common level of organization), to demonstrate a commitment to the local economy. Though governments are not required to consult chambers on proposed laws, the chambers are often contacted given their local influence and membership numbers.

===Multilateral chambers===
A multilateral chamber is formed of companies and sometimes individuals from different countries with a common business interest towards or in a specific country. It can further be active in representing the interests of local and foreign investors in that specific country, achieved through promotion and proactivity regarding the general business environment. Multilateral chambers of commerce are independent entities strengthening business relations and interactions between all economic players, and their members may benefit from a broad range of activities that enhance the visibility and reputation of their business.

==Surveys==
In many countries, Chambers of Commerce are a source of private-sector information. The information is usually gathered by surveying Chamber members. The British Chambers of Commerce Quarterly Economic Survey is an example of a Chambers of Commerce survey that is used by official governmental departments as a guide to the performance of the economy.

<doc id="305504" wikidata="Q5642996" url="?curid=305504" title="Far from the Madding Crowd">
<text>Far from the Madding Crowd is the fourth published novel by English author Thomas Hardy; and his first major literary success. It was published on 23 November 1874. It originally appeared anonymously as a monthly serial in &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot;, where it gained a wide readership.

The novel is set in Thomas Hardy&#x27;s Wessex in rural southwest England, as had been his earlier &quot;Under the Greenwood Tree&quot;. It deals in themes of love, honour and betrayal, against a backdrop of the seemingly idyllic, but often harsh, realities of a farming community in Victorian England. It describes the life and relationships of Bathsheba Everdene with her lonely neighbour William Boldwood, the faithful shepherd Gabriel Oak, and the thriftless soldier Sergeant Troy.

On publication, critical notices were plentiful and mostly positive. Hardy revised the text extensively for the 1895 edition and made further changes for the 1901 edition.

The novel has an enduring legacy. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 48 on the BBC&#x27;s survey The Big Read, while in 2007, it was ranked 10th on &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s list of greatest love stories of all time. The novel has also been dramatised several times, notably in the Oscar-nominated 1967 film directed by John Schlesinger.

==Synopsis==
===Meeting, parting and reuniting===
Gabriel Oak is a young shepherd. With the savings of a frugal life, and a loan, he has leased and stocked a farm. He falls in love with a newcomer eight years his junior, Bathsheba Everdene, who arrives to live with her aunt. Over time, Bathsheba and Gabriel grow to like each other well enough, and Bathsheba even saves his life once. However, when he makes her an unadorned offer of marriage, she refuses; she values her independence too much and him too little. Days later, she moves to Weatherbury, a village some miles off.

When next they meet, their circumstances have changed drastically. An inexperienced new sheepdog has driven Gabriel&#x27;s flock over a cliff, ruining him. After selling off everything of value, he manages to settle all his debts but emerges penniless. He seeks employment at a hiring fair in the town of Casterbridge. When he finds none, he heads to another such fair in Shottsford, a town about ten miles from Weatherbury. On his way, he spots a fire on a farm and leads the bystanders in putting it out. When the veiled owner comes to thank him, he asks if she needs a shepherd. She uncovers her face and reveals herself to be Bathsheba. She has recently inherited her uncle&#x27;s estate and is now wealthy. Though somewhat uncomfortable, she employs him.

===Bathsheba&#x27;s valentine to Boldwood===
Meanwhile, Bathsheba gains a new admirer. William Boldwood is a prosperous farmer of about 40, whose ardour Bathsheba unwittingly awakens when she playfully sends him a valentine sealed with red wax on which she has embossed the words &quot;Marry me&quot;. Boldwood, not realising the valentine was a jest, becomes obsessed with her and soon proposes marriage assuming she wanted the same. Despite not loving him, she toys with the idea of accepting his offer; he is the most eligible bachelor in the district, wealthy and handsome. However, she avoids giving him a definite answer. When Gabriel rebukes her for her thoughtlessness regarding Boldwood, she dismisses him from his job.

When Bathsheba&#x27;s sheep begin dying from bloat, she discovers to her chagrin that Gabriel is the only man who knows how to cure them. Her pride delays the inevitable, but eventually she is forced to beg him for help. Afterward, she offers him back his job, and their friendship is restored.

===Sergeant Troy===

At this point, Sergeant Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Troy returns to his native Weatherbury and by chance encounters Bathsheba one night. Her initial dislike turns to infatuation after he excites her with a private display of swordsmanship. Gabriel observes Bathsheba&#x27;s interest in the young soldier and tries to discourage it, telling her she would be better off marrying Boldwood. Boldwood becomes aggressive towards Troy, and Bathsheba goes to Bath to prevent Troy returning to Weatherbury, as she fears what might happen if Troy encountered Boldwood. On their return, Boldwood offers his rival a large bribe to give up Bathsheba. Troy pretends to consider the offer, then scornfully announces they are already married. Boldwood withdraws, humiliated, and vows revenge.

Bathsheba discovers that her new husband is an improvident gambler with little interest in farming. She also begins to suspect he does not love her. In fact, Troy&#x27;s heart belongs to her former servant, Fanny Robin. Before meeting Bathsheba, Troy had promised to marry Fanny; on the wedding day, however, Fanny goes to the wrong church. She explains her mistake, but Troy, humiliated at being left at the altar, calls off the wedding. When they part, unbeknownst to Troy, Fanny is pregnant with his child.

===Fanny Robin===

Months later, Troy and Bathsheba encounter the frail Fanny on the road, destitute, as she painfully makes her way toward the Casterbridge workhouse. Troy sends his wife onward, then gives Fanny all the money in his pocket, telling her he will give her more in a few days. Fanny uses up the last of her strength to reach her destination. Hours later, she dies in childbirth, along with the baby. Mother and child are then placed in a coffin and sent home to Weatherbury to be buried. Gabriel, who knows of Troy&#x27;s relationship with Fanny, tries to conceal the child&#x27;s existence – but Bathsheba agrees that the coffin can be left in her house overnight, from her sense of duty towards a former servant. Her servant and confidante, Liddy, repeats the rumour that Fanny had a child; when all the servants are in bed, Bathsheba unscrews the lid and sees the two bodies inside.

Troy then comes home from Casterbridge, where he had gone to keep his appointment with Fanny. Seeing the reason for her failure to meet him a second time, he tenderly kisses the corpse and tells the anguished Bathsheba, &quot;This woman is more to me, dead as she is, than ever you were, or are, or can be&quot;. The next day he spends all his money on a marble tombstone with the inscription: &quot;Erected by Francis Troy in beloved memory of Fanny Robin ...&quot; Then, loathing himself and unable to bear Bathsheba&#x27;s company, he leaves. After a long walk, he bathes in the sea, leaving his clothes on the beach. A strong current carries him away, but he is rescued by some men in a boat. He does not return home, however.

===Troy returns===
A year later, with Troy presumed drowned, Boldwood renews his suit. Burdened with guilt over the pain she has caused him, Bathsheba reluctantly consents to marry him in six years, long enough to have Troy declared dead. Boldwood begins counting the days.

Troy tires of his hand-to-mouth existence as a travelling actor and considers reclaiming his position and wife. He returns to Weatherbury on Christmas Eve and goes to Boldwood&#x27;s house, where a party is under way. He orders Bathsheba to come with him; when she shrinks back in shock and dismay, he seizes her arm, and she screams. At this, Boldwood shoots Troy dead and tries unsuccessfully to turn the double-barrelled gun on himself. Although Boldwood is convicted of murder and sentenced to be hanged, his friends petition the Home Secretary for mercy, claiming insanity. This is granted, and Boldwood&#x27;s sentence is commuted to &quot;confinement during Her Majesty&#x27;s pleasure&quot;. Bathsheba buries her husband in the same grave as Fanny Robin and their child.

===Gabriel triumphant===
Throughout her tribulations, Bathsheba comes to rely increasingly on her oldest and, as she admits to herself, only real friend, Gabriel. When he gives notice that he is leaving her employ, she realises how important he has become to her well-being. That night, she goes alone to visit him in his cottage to find out why he is deserting her. Pressed, he reluctantly reveals that it is because people have been gossiping that he wants to marry her. She exclaims that it is &quot;... too absurd – too soon – to think of, by far!&quot; He bitterly agrees that it is absurd, but she corrects him, tearfully, saying that it is only &quot;too soon.&quot; Emboldened, Gabriel says if he only knew if she would marry him, and she replies that he will never know, because he never asks. At this, they become engaged, and later, are quietly married.

==Title==
Hardy took the title from Thomas Gray&#x27;s poem &quot;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&quot; (1751):

&quot;&quot; here means &quot;frenzied&quot;.

Lucasta Miller points out that the title is an ironic literary joke, as Gray is idealising noiseless and sequestered calm, whereas Hardy &quot;disrupts the idyll, and not just by introducing the sound and fury of an extreme plot ... he is out to subvert his readers&#x27; complacency&quot;.

==Hardy&#x27;s Wessex==

Thomas Hardy&#x27;s Wessex was first mentioned in &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot;; describing the &quot;partly real, partly dream-country&quot; that unifies his novels of southwest England. &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; offers in ample measure the details of English rural life that Hardy so relished.

He found the word in the pages of early English history as a designation for an extinct, pre-Norman Conquest kingdom, the Wessex from which Alfred the Great established England. In the first edition, the word &quot;Wessex&quot; is used only once, in chapter 50; Hardy extended the reference for the 1895 edition. Hardy himself wrote: &quot;I am reminded that it was in the chapters of &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot;… that I first ventured to adopt the word &#x27;Wessex&#x27; from the pages of early English history... – a modern Wessex of railways, the penny post, mowing and reaping machines, union workhouses, lucifer matches, labourers who could read and write, and National school children&quot;.

Puddletown&#x27;s parish church has significant architectural interest, particularly its furnishings and monuments. It has a 12th-century font and well-preserved woodwork, including 17th-century box pews. Hardy took an interest in the church, and the village provided the inspiration for the fictional settlement of Weatherbury
In &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot;, Hardy briefly mentions two characters from &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; – Farmer Everdene and Farmer Boldwood, both in happier days.

==Adaptations==
===Radio===
The novel was adapted by Graham White in 2012 into a three-part series on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Classic Serial&quot;. The production was directed by Jessica Dromgoole and featured Alex Tregear as Bathsheba, Shaun Dooley as Gabriel, Toby Jones as Boldwood and Patrick Kennedy as Troy.

===Comics===
The novel was adapted by Posy Simmonds into &quot;Tamara Drewe&quot;, weekly comic strip that ran from September 2005 to October 2006 in &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Review section. The strip, a modern reworking of the novel, was itself adapted into a film, &quot;Tamara Drewe&quot; (2010), directed by Stephen Frears.

===Stage productions===
In 1879, Hardy adapted the novel under the title &quot;The Mistress of the Farm: A Pastoral Drama&quot;. When J. Comyns Carr suggested something similar, Hardy gave him his version, which he said Carr &quot;modified… in places, to suit modern carpentry &amp;c&quot;. Hardy&#x27;s experience of adapting a novel for the theatre was soured by controversy – the managers of the St James&#x27;s Theatre, London, John Hare and William Hunter Kendal, on reading the Comyns Carr/Hardy adaptation, first accepted it and then rejected it; instead staging Arthur Wing Pinero&#x27;s play &quot;The Squire&quot;, which appeared to be heavily plagiarised from the earlier script. This enraged Comyns Carr and, to a lesser extent, Hardy. Prompted by Comyns Carr, Hardy wrote indignant letters to &quot;The Times&quot; and the &quot;Daily News&quot;. Comyns Carr/Hardy&#x27;s version was finally staged at the Royal Court Theatre in Liverpool, where it opened on 27 February 1882 as &quot;Far from The Madding Crowd,&quot; with Marion Terry as Bathsheba and Charles Kelly as Oak. The reviews were mixed, one critic calling their adaptation &quot;a miniature melodrama… well placed in the provinces&quot;, while praising &quot;The Squire&quot;&#x27;s appeal to &quot;spectators of somewhat refined taste&quot;. The production subsequently transferred to the Globe Theatre in London, opening on 29 April 1882, presenting a similar cast, but with Mrs Bernard Beere now playing Bathsheba.

Inspired by these performances, a further, clumsy cut-and-paste version, of the novel was performed in America shortly afterwards, at the Union Square Theatre, New York in April 1882. The play was panned: according to the theatre reviewer for the American journal &quot;Spirit of the Times&quot;, it was unfair &quot;to Thomas Hardy, to the public, and to Miss Morris, although she got even by spoiling the play after Mr Cazauran had spoiled the novel&quot;. This experience made Hardy wary of theatrical adaptations and the potential risk to his reputation both from authorised adaptations and from unauthorised ones.

In 1909, Harold Evans adapted the novel, with Hardy&#x27;s input, for The Hardy Players, Hardy&#x27;s own amateur theatrical society, formed in 1908 to perform a production of &quot;The Trumpet-Major&quot;. As Harold Evans&#x27; daughter Evelyn wrote: &quot;This pastoral romance presented more difficult problems of staging; sheep had to be sheared on stage in the great barn; the big shearing supper was essential; Boldwood’s Christmas party had to be staged, too, with its tragic climax, the shooting of Troy by the half-crazed Boldwood. Mr T. H. Tilley, a builder by trade, and a most gifted comedian, conquered all these staging difficulties. He constructed a model theatre (now in the possession of Mr Edward Grassby) with designs for each set, so that the Weatherbury (Puddletown) landscape could be faithfully portrayed. A painting of Waterston House formed one backcloth; meadows, fir plantations, house interiors, the others. Mr Tilley’s rich humour in the part of Joseph Poorgrass delighted Hardy and the audience. My father often chuckled over how Joseph, in his cups, declared, &#x27;I feel too good for England. I ought to have lived in Genesis by right.&#x27;” In the 1909 production, one important scene had to be omitted. Much to Hardy&#x27;s regret, the opening of Fanny Robin&#x27;s coffin by Bathsheba and her reaction to it could not be staged. At that time, having a coffin on the stage was seen as too shocking. &quot;Years later&quot;, wrote Evelyn Evans, &quot;when Hardy attended a performance of Synge’s Riders to the Sea by the Arts League of Service, and watched drowned bodies carried on to the stage, he remarked wryly that his one coffin containing Fanny Robin and her child could hardly have shocked the same audience&quot;. There was also some unexpected comedy gold in the 1909 production. Evelyn Evans describes it thus: &quot;To make this pastoral play true to life, my father engaged a professional sheep-shearer to shear sheep on stage during the important shearing scene. Everything was to be done as Hardy described it: &#x27;The lopping off the tresses about the ewe’s head, opening up the neck and collar, the running of the shears line after line round her dewlap, thence about her flank and back, and finishing over her tail – the clean, sleek creature arising from its fleece: startled and shy at the loss of its garment, which lay on the floor in one soft cloud.&#x27; The shearer, complaining of thirst, was given unlimited free beer at his task, with the result that above the actors&#x27; voices could be heard a maudlin song, as the shearer sang to the sheep he was fondly kissing and clipping with expertise, becoming, unfortunately, drunker and drunker to father&#x27;s great consternation&quot;.

The novel was adapted as a ballet in 1996 by David Bintley for the Birmingham Royal Ballet, a musical in 2000 by Gary Schocker, and an opera in 2006 by Andrew Downes.

New stage adaptations were performed in autumn 2008 by the English Touring Theatre (ETT), directed by Kate Saxon, in March 2013 by Myriad Theatre &amp; Film, and in 2019 by the New Hardy Players (re-formed at the request of Norrie Woodhall).

In 2011 Roger Holman wrote a musical adaptation of &quot;Far From the Madding Crowd&quot;.

<text>Sex Gang Children are an early gothic rock and post-punk band that formed in early 1982 in Brixton in London, England. Although the original group only released one official studio album, their singles and various other tracks have been packaged into numerous collections and they remain one of the more well-known bands of the early Batcave scene and have reformed for new albums and touring at various times since the early 1990s. 

==History==
The original lineup was Andi Sex Gang (vocals, guitar), Dave Roberts (bass), Terry McLeay (guitar) and Rob Stroud (drums). They were a dramatic band, relying on heavy bass, tribal drumming, sudden mood shifts, dramatic vocals and a cabaret sound (influencing the rise of the later dark cabaret scene). The band&#x27;s first release was a cassette-only live album, &quot;Naked&quot;, in 1982. The &quot;Beasts&quot; EP, their first vinyl release, followed the same year after they signed to the Illuminated label. The band&#x27;s only studio album from their original period together, &quot;Song and Legend&quot;, was released in 1983, reaching the top of the UK Indie Chart and spawning the single &quot;Sebastiane&quot;. Stroud departed to form Aemoti Crii, to be replaced by former Theatre of Hate drummer Nigel Preston, who played on the band&#x27;s next single, &quot;Mauritia Mayer&quot;, before himself being replaced by former Death Cult drummer Ray Mondo. Roberts left in late 1983 to form Carcrash International, and the line-up settled to Andi, McLeay, Cam Campbell (bass) and Kevin Matthews (drums), a change forced by Ray Mondo&#x27;s deportation to his native Sierra Leone.

Following McLeay&#x27;s departure in 1984, the band was renamed Andi Sex Gang &amp; the Quick Gas Gang for the 1985 &quot;Blind!&quot; album and tour (McLeay did not leave until after that album&#x27;s recording, however; guitarist Lester Jones from Crisis performed the live shows). The band split afterwards.

Renewed interest in the band in the United States led to a reformation in 1991, including Roberts, and a new album, &quot;Medea&quot;, in 1993. As a solo artist, Andi went on to make a number of well-received albums for various labels.

==Name==
Sex Gang Children were originally called Panic Button. The name &quot;Sex Gang Children&quot; was taken by Malcolm McLaren from a William Burroughs novel as a possible name for the band that became Bow Wow Wow (and is referenced in their song &quot;Mile High Club&quot;) and was one of the names that Boy George considered for his band before choosing &quot;Culture Club&quot;. SGC vocalist Andi tried to persuade George to use the name, but when Culture Club drummer Jon Moss passed on the idea, Andi decided that the name should not go to waste.

<doc id="305526" wikidata="Q144085" url="?curid=305526" title="Pimozide">
<text>Pimozide (sold under the brand name Orap) is a neuroleptic drug of the diphenylbutylpiperidine class. It was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1963. It has a high potency compared to chlorpromazine (ratio 50-70:1). On a weight basis it is even more potent than haloperidol. It also has special indication for Tourette syndrome and resistant tics.

== Medical uses ==

Pimozide is used for Tourette syndrome, and resistant tics (Europe, United States, and Canada) and in Europe for schizophrenia, chronic psychosis, delusional disorder, and paranoid personality disorder. 

== Efficacy ==

A 2013 systematic review compared pimozide with other antipsychotics for schizophrenia or related psychoses: Pimozide versus any other antipsychotic

In one case a series of 33 patients with delusional parasitosis (median age, 60 years), pimozide was prescribed for 24 patients, 18 of whom took the drug. The dose ranged from 1 to 5 mg daily. No information regarding initial dosing was specified, although the dose was continued for 6 weeks prior to tapering. Of those patients receiving pimozide, 61% (11/18) experienced improvement in or full remission of symptoms. The use of pimozide for the treatment of delusional parasitosis is based primarily on data from case series/reports that demonstrate some efficacy in the majority of patients. Currently, atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine or risperidone are used as first line treatment. However, patients who experience negative side-effects with the first line medications are typically given pimozide.

== Contraindications ==

It is contraindicated in individuals with either acquired, congenital or a family history of QT interval prolongation. Its use is advised against in individuals with people with either a personal or a family history of arrhythmias or torsades de pointes. Likewise its use is also advised against in individuals with uncorrected hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia or clinical significant cardiac disorders (e.g. a recent myocardial infarction or bradycardia. It is also contraindicated in individuals being cotreated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or in those with a known hypersensitivity to pimozide or other diphenylbutyl-piperidine derivatives. Likewise its use is contraindicated in individuals receiving treatment with CYP3A4, CYP1A2, or CYP2D6 inhibitors.

== Side effects ==

Very common (&gt;10% frequency) side effects include:

* Akinesia
* Constipation
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Hyperhidrosis
* Nocturia
* Somnolence
* Speech disorder

== Overdose ==

Pimozide overdose presents with severe extrapyramidal symptoms, hypotension, sedation, QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias including torsades de pointes. Gastric lavage, establishment of a patent airway and, if necessary, mechanically assisted respiration is the recommended treatment for pimozide overdose. Cardiac monitoring should be continued for at least 4 days due to the long half-life of pimozide.

== Pharmacology ==

Pimozide acts as an antagonist of the D2, D3, and D4 receptors and the 5-HT7 receptor. It is also a hERG blocker.

Similarly to other typical antipsychotics pimozide has a high affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor and this likely results in its sexual (due to prolactin hypersecretion) and extrapyramidal side effects as well as its therapeutic efficacy against the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.


== History ==

In 1985 pimozide was approved by the FDA for marketing as an orphan drug for the treatment of Tourette&#x27;s syndrome.

<text>The Batcave is a subterranean location appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. It is the headquarters of the superhero Batman, whose secret identity is Bruce Wayne and his partners, consisting of caves beneath his personal residence, Wayne Manor.

The Batcave appeared in the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; television series and in the films &quot;Batman&quot; (1989), &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992), &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995), &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; (1997), &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; Trilogy (2005–2012), and in the DC Extended Universe (2016–2023), as well as &quot;The Batman&quot; (2022).

==Publication history==
Originally, there was only a secret tunnel that ran underground between Wayne Manor and a dusty old barn where the Batmobile was kept. Later, in &quot;Batman&quot; #12 (August–September 1942), Bill Finger mentioned &quot;secret underground hangars&quot;. In 1943, the writers of the first Batman film serial, titled &quot;Batman&quot;, gave Batman a complete underground crime lab and introduced it in the second chapter entitled &quot;The Bat&#x27;s Cave&quot;. The entrance was via a secret passage through a grandfather clock and included bats flying around.

Bob Kane, who was on the film set, mentioned this to Bill Finger who was going to be the initial scripter on the Batman daily newspaper strip. Finger included with his script a clipping from &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; that featured a detailed cross-section of underground hangars. Kane used this clipping as a guide, adding a study, crime lab, workshop, hangar and garage. This illustration appeared in the &quot;Batman&quot; &quot;dailies&quot; on October 29, 1943, in a strip entitled &quot;The Bat Cave!&quot;

In this early version the cave itself was described as Batman&#x27;s underground study and, like the other rooms, was just a small alcove with a desk and filing cabinets. Like in the film serial, Batman&#x27;s symbol was carved into the rock behind the desk and had a candle in the middle of it. The entrance was via a bookcase which led to a secret elevator.

The Batcave made its comic book debut in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #83 in January 1944. Over the decades, the cave has expanded along with its owner&#x27;s popularity to include a vast trophy room, supercomputer, and forensics lab. There has been little consistency as to the floor plan of the Batcave or its contents. The design has varied from artist to artist and it is not unusual for the same artist to draw the cave layout differently in various issues.

==Fictional history==

The cave was discovered and used long before by Bruce Wayne&#x27;s ancestors as a storehouse as well as a means of transporting escaped slaves during the Civil War era. The 18th-century frontier hero Tomahawk once discovered a gargantuan bat belonging to Morgaine le Fey inside what can be assumed would become the Batcave. Wayne himself rediscovered the caves as a boy when he fell through a dilapidated well on his estate, but did not consider it as a potential base of operations until returning to Gotham to become Batman. In addition to a base, the Batcave serves as a place of privacy and tranquility, much like Superman&#x27;s Fortress of Solitude.

In earlier versions of the story, Bruce Wayne discovered the cave as an adult. In &quot;The Origin of the Batcave&quot; in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #205 (March 1954), Batman tells Robin he had no idea the cave existed when he purchased the house they live in. He discovered the cave by accident when, while he was testing the floor of an old barn on the rear of the property, the floor gave way. This story also established that a frontiersman named Jeremy Coe used the cave as a headquarters 300 years earlier. Bruce Wayne discovering the cave as an adult remained the case at least through &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; #2 in 1985.

Upon his initial foray into crime-fighting, Wayne used the caves as a sanctum and to store his then-minimal equipment. As time went on, Wayne found the place ideal to create a stronghold for his war against crime, and has incorporated a plethora of equipment as well as expanding the cave for specific uses.

===Access===

The cave is accessible in several ways. It can be reached through a secret door in Wayne Manor itself, which is almost always depicted as in the main study, often behind a grandfather clock which unlocks when the hands are set to the time that Bruce Wayne&#x27;s parents were murdered, 10:48 pm. In the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; TV show, the cave entrance is behind a bookcase which was opened when Bruce Wayne activated a control switch hidden in a bust of William Shakespeare. An entrance under Bruce Wayne&#x27;s chair in his office in Wayne Enterprises, as shown in &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, connects to a mile-long tunnel that Bruce travels through in a high-speed personal transportation capsule. In &quot;Batman Begins&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, the cave is accessible through a secret door disguised as part of a large display case and is unlocked by pressing a sequence of keys on the nearby grand piano.

Another secret entrance, covered by a waterfall, pond, hologram, or a camouflaged door, allows access to a service road for the Batmobile. Another alternate entrance is the dry well where Bruce originally discovered the Batcave, highlighted especially during the &quot;&quot; comic book storyline. At one point, Dick Grayson and Tim Drake use the dry well to get into the cave, which they had been locked out of by Azrael during his time as Batman, and Bruce Wayne used it to infiltrate the cave and confront the insane Valley in the final battle between the two men for the title of the Batman. Lured into the narrow tunnel, Valley was forced to remove the massive Bat-armor he had developed, thus allowing Wayne to force Valley to remit his claim to the title.

The location of the cave is known not only to Batman but to several of his allies. In addition to the so-called &quot;Batman Family&quot;, members of the Justice League and the original Outsiders are aware of the cave&#x27;s location. Essentially, anyone who is aware of Batman&#x27;s secret identity also knows the location of the Batcave, much like how people who have knowledge of Robin&#x27;s identity have knowledge of Batman&#x27;s; these, unfortunately, include such villains as Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, who makes occasional visits to the Batcave to confront his long-time nemesis, and David Cain, who infiltrated the cave during the &quot;Bruce Wayne: Fugitive&quot; comic book storyline when he framed Bruce Wayne for murder. During &quot;&quot;, Two-Face, the Joker, Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy discovered the Batcave while fleeing through the sewers to escape the attacks of the surviving mobsters, but they had lost their way and were never able to find the cave again after being defeated, with Batman reflecting that he would seal that entrance to prevent such a thing happening again. When the powerful Bedlam took over the world and transferred all adults to a duplicate Earth, Robin attempted to assess the situation from the Batcave with Superboy and Impulse, but it would appear that he avoided revealing the cave&#x27;s exact location to them, suggesting that he accessed it via an external passage or a teleporter.

Although Wayne Manor was repossessed and converted into the new Arkham Asylum following the events of &quot;Batman Eternal&quot;, Batman maintains the original cave after sealing off the entrance to Wayne Manor, musing that it is a good opportunity to keep his foes contained. After the manor was gifted back to Bruce by Geri Powers, Alfred kept the location of the Batcave a secret from Bruce who had lost his memory of being Batman in his last battle with The Joker. While the manor was being renovated and all the Arkham inmates were removed Bruce and Alfred until then remained in a Brownstone in Gotham itself. Even after Bruce loses all memory of his life as Batman, the cave was still used by other members of the Bat-Family; Alfred took the de-powered Clark Kent to the cave to explain what had happened to Bruce, and Dick Grayson and the various Robins used it as a base of operations while opposing the schemes of the ruthless &quot;Mother&quot; in &quot;Batman and Robin Eternal&quot;. When new villain Mr. Bloom launches a massive attack on Gotham, Alfred is forced to allow Bruce into the Batcave to access an apparently-disregarded program designed to upload Bruce&#x27;s memories to a series of Batman clones to maintain his legacy, Bruce overcoming the original project&#x27;s limitation of being unable to upload the memories to a fresh body by having Alfred take him to the point of brain death and then download the data onto his blank brain.

===Design===
The Batcave serves as Batman&#x27;s secret headquarters and the command center, where he monitors all crisis points in Gotham City, as well as the rest of the world.

The cave&#x27;s centerpiece is a supercomputer whose specs are on par with any of those used by leading national security agencies; it permits global surveillance and also connects to a massive information network as well as storing vast amounts of information. A series of satellite link-ups allows easy access to Batman&#x27;s information network anywhere around the globe. The systems are protected against unauthorized access, and any attempt to breach their security immediately sends an alert to Batman or Oracle. Despite the power of Batman&#x27;s computers, the Justice League Watchtower is known to have more powerful computers, and Batman does occasionally use them if he feels his computers are not up to the task; on occasion, he also consults Oracle for assistance.
Additionally, the cave features state-of-the-art facilities such as a crime lab, various specialized laboratories, mechanized workshops, personal gymnasium, parking, docking and hangar space for his vehicles as well as separate exits for each type, memorabilia of past campaigns, a vast library, a large bat colony, and a Justice League teleporter. It also has medical facilities as well as various areas used in training exercises for Batman and his allies.

The cave houses Batman&#x27;s vast array of specialized vehicles, foremost being the Batmobile in all its incarnations. Other vehicles within the complex include various motorcycles, air- and watercraft such as the Batplane, a single-occupant supersonic jet, and the Subway Rocket.

The cave is sometimes depicted as being powered by a nuclear reactor, but most often by a hydroelectric generator made possible by an underground river.

During the &quot;Cataclysm&quot; storyline, the cave was seriously damaged in an earthquake, with the Bat-family relocating most of the trophies and equipment in the cave to offsite storage to conceal Batman&#x27;s identity. During the later reconstruction, the new Wayne Manor incorporates additional safeguards against future quakes and even a potential nuclear catastrophe, outfitting the cave as a virtual bomb shelter or an enhanced panic room. The city&#x27;s earthquake redesigned the caverns of the Batcave, with eight new levels now making up Batman&#x27;s secret refuge of high-tech laboratory, library, training areas, storage areas, and vehicle accesses. It also includes an &quot;island&quot; computer platform (built on the spot where the Batmobiles&#x27; hydraulic turntable once was) with seven linked Cray T932 mainframes and a state-of-the-art hologram projector. There&#x27;s also a selection of retractable glass maps within the computer platform. Kevlar shieldings are prepared to protect the cave&#x27;s computer systems from seismic activity. With the cave&#x27;s various facilities spread amid limestone stalactites and stalagmites, Batman built retractable multi-walkway bridges, stairs, elevators, and poles to access its facilities.

There is a containment vault solely for Lex Luthor&#x27;s Kryptonite ring. However, it was later revealed that Batman built another containment facility within the cave for a variety of forms of Kryptonite.

What is allegedly the world&#x27;s last Lazarus Pit was constructed inside the cave, although this has been contradicted by events in the pages of &quot;Batgirl&quot; and the Black Adam miniseries.

===Security measures===
The Batcave is rigged with a sophisticated security system to prevent all measure of infiltration. The security measures include motion sensors, silent alarms, steel and lead mechanical doors which could lock a person in or out, and a security mode which is specifically designed to stop if not eliminate all Justice League members in the event that any of them go rogue.

After Bruce Wayne&#x27;s &#x27;death&#x27; during the &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, Two-Face managed to infiltrate the cave with the aid of a psychic analyzing a batarang to &#x27;sense&#x27; where it was forged and then hiring Warp to teleport him into it, something that Two-Face had never been able to do before as Batman used various spells and equipment to shield the cave which his allies either never knew about or had discontinued as they no longer used the cave themselves following Bruce&#x27;s death. Despite Two-Face successfully breaking into the cave, Dick Grayson, acting as the new Batman, is able to convince Dent that he is the same man and has just adopted new methods, preserving Batman&#x27;s secrets as Dent is rendered unconscious before he can find the location of the cave.

===Memorabilia===

The cave stores unique memorabilia items collected from the various cases Batman has worked on over the years. Originally, these were stored in a room designed just for them; it was explained that Batman and Robin took one memento from each case. Later, the trophies were shown to be in the large main area of the cave, residing among the rest of the Batcave&#x27;s furnishings.

The most regularly featured trophies are a full-size animatronic Tyrannosaurus Rex, a giant replica of a Lincoln penny, and an oversized Joker playing card. The &quot;T. Rex&quot; comes from an adventure on &quot;Dinosaur Island&quot; (&quot;Batman&quot; #35 1946); the penny was originally a trophy from Batman&#x27;s encounter with a penny-obsessed villain named the Penny Plunderer (&quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #30 1947), but was later retconned into being from an encounter with Two-Face. Other &quot;keepsakes&quot; in the cave come from &quot;The Thousand and One Trophies of Batman!&quot; (&quot;Detective Comics&quot; #158, 1950). These three stories were reprinted in &quot;Batman&quot; #256.

Modern retellings of the items&#x27; origins can be found in &quot;Batman Chronicles&quot; stories in issue #8 (&quot;Secrets of the Batcave: Dinosaur Island&quot;) and issue #19 (&quot;The Penny Plunderers&quot;).

A story in &quot;Batman&quot; #81 featured Two-Face tying Batman and Robin to a giant replica of his silver dollar coin. This story was the basis for an episode of &quot;&quot; wherein Batman gains the giant coin from that encounter; this has caused widespread confusion as to the actual origin of the coin trophy.

Other pieces often shown in the Batcave are Two-Face&#x27;s original coin, Deathstroke&#x27;s sword, the shroud of the vampiric Monk, and oversized ten-pins.

There is also a glass case display of Jason Todd&#x27;s Robin costume as a memorial to him, with the epitaph &quot;A Good Soldier&quot;, which remains even after Todd&#x27;s resurrection. Barbara Gordon&#x27;s Batgirl costume also remains on display. In the Dark Horse two-part crossover, Grendel/Batman II, Hunter Rose&#x27;s skull is also put on display in the memorabilia room.

After the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; comic book storyline, a letter written by a Thomas Wayne from an alternate timeline addressed to Bruce Wayne has lain in a display case, as a reminder of Thomas Wayne&#x27;s love for his son and encouraging him to move on from his tragic past. However, this letter was destroyed by the reborn Eobard Thawne as a way to hurt Bruce for Thomas&#x27;s attempt to kill him before &quot;Flashpoint&quot; ended.

===&quot;Batcave&quot; safehouses===

The Outsiders were, for a time, based out of a Batcave in Los Angeles. When Jean-Paul Valley takes over the role of Batman, Tim Drake establishes his own safe house using an abandoned barn nearby Wayne Manor and his own house. After Bane&#x27;s attack during the &quot;Knightfall&quot; story arc, Bruce Wayne swore that he&#x27;d never be caught unprepared to defend Gotham City ever again. When Dick Grayson assumed the Batman role during the &quot;Prodigal&quot; storyline, Bruce established satellite Batcaves throughout the city on areas either owned by him, his company, or unknown or abandoned by the city, in the event that he needed a place to hide or resupply, which were pivotal during the &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; storyline. One such Batcave was given to Batgirl, below a house owned by Bruce Wayne himself, during a point where her identity was compromised after she saved a man from rogue government agents, meaning that she could not walk around without a mask.

*Bat Bunker: Under the Wayne Foundation building, there is a secret bunker. As of &quot;Batman&quot; #687, Dick Grayson has taken to using this as his &quot;Batcave&quot;, stating that he wishes to embody the role of Batman in a way that is specific to him as well as getting closer to the action in the city. The bunker is as well-equipped as the original Batcave, including the Subway Rocket vehicle.

The other satellite Batcaves introduced during &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; were:

*Batcave Central: Located fifty feet below the bottom of Robinson Park Reservoir, it is accessible through a secret entrance at the foot of one of the Twelve Caesars statues at the north of the park. This safehouse was put out of commission by Poison Ivy, her &quot;Feraks&quot;, and Clayface.
*Batcave South: A boiler room of a derelict shipping yard on the docks across from Paris Island. This safehouse is accessible through a number of false manholes planted throughout Old Gotham streets.
*Batcave South-Central: Located in the Old Gotham prototype subway station, a four-block stretch of track sealed in 1896 and forgotten.
*Batcave Northwest: This safehouse is located in the subbasement of Arkham Asylum. Batman secretly stocked it with emergency rations, all-terrain vehicles, and battery-powered communication equipment.
*Batcave East: An abandoned oil refinery owned by Wayne Enterprises. It fell out of use during a gasoline crisis when the company moved all of its holdings offshore decades ago.
*Batcave Submarine: Introduced in 2002&#x27;s &quot;Fugitive&quot; story arc, this time in the form of an abandoned submarine docked on the city&#x27;s harbors, which Batman used as a full-time residence when he chose to abandon his life as Bruce Wayne when framed for the murder of Vesper Fairchild.

==Alternative versions of the Batcave==
===&quot;Batman &amp; Dracula Trilogy&quot;===
In &quot;Batman &amp; Dracula: Red Rain&quot;, Batman destroys the Batcave to eliminate Dracula&#x27;s followers; having lured them into the cave after a prolonged pursuit through the sewers, he sets off explosive charges to destroy the Batcave&#x27;s walls at the moment the sun rises, destroying the vampires trapped within it, before setting off additional charges to collapse Wayne Manor to preserve his secrets. The first sequel, &quot;Bloodstorm,&quot; shows that a cellar beneath a brownstone owned by Alfred Pennyworth serves as a lair/laboratory for Batman after he has become a vampire himself, the Dark Knight &#x27;sleeping&#x27; there in his coffin during the day. Although Wayne Manor collapses into the remains of the cave, part of the tunnel system is still intact, with Batman establishing his lair there in the story&#x27;s second sequel, &quot;Crimson Mist&quot;, after he surrenders to his new vampire instincts. Despite the collapse of the manor, the cave interior appears mostly intact, with the giant penny, the T-Rex and the Batmobile shown to be undamaged, although there is also a deep chasm within walking distance of the areas where Batman kept the aforementioned items when he was human. At the story&#x27;s conclusion, Commissioner Gordon sets off explosive charges to destroy the cave&#x27;s roof, letting the sun into the cave once again to destroy the monster that Batman has become once and for all.

===&quot;Batman: Brotherhood of the Bat&quot;===
In &quot;Batman: Brotherhood of the Bat&quot;, some years after Bruce Wayne&#x27;s death and humanity&#x27;s decimation by a virus unleashed by Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, Ra&#x27;s takes control of the Batcave and uses some of Bruce&#x27;s sketches of possible costumes to create an army of Bat-men based on Bruce&#x27;s rejected costume designs. Eventually, this &#x27;Brotherhood&#x27; is infiltrated by Tallant, the son of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul, who is able to destroy the Brotherhood from within using his father&#x27;s own costume, culminating in him defeating his grandfather in a duel in the cave.

===&quot;Flashpoint&quot; (comics)===
In the alternate reality of &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, the Batcave- here used by Thomas Wayne rather than Bruce- is far smaller and more run-down than the traditional version, containing merely a couple of tables for Thomas to work on his equipment and a medical area, with a conventional computer in the upper manor, reflecting Thomas&#x27;s more brutal and solitary M.O. as Batman as opposed to the more sophisticated training undertaken by his son.

===Legion of Super-Heroes===
In the 31st century, the Batcave has been long abandoned, although Cosmic Boy, Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad briefly infiltrate the cave while looking for evidence that Krypton existed to counter the xenophobic claims of the Justice League of Earth that Superman was a human given powers to fight against aliens.

===&quot;Detective Comics&quot; (vol. 2) #27===
In a possible future, Bruce Wayne has used a machine to download his memories and training into a series of clones of himself, each one aged to a point where they can act as Batman for around twenty-five years before they need to activate the new clone. By the time that the tenth generation clone is created, the Batcave has become a vast workshop, including a flying Batmobile, a robotic shark as a trophy, and costumes in glass cases, but the older Batman informs the new one that the contents of the cave will be burned upon his death so that the new Batman can make room for his own things while using the recorded memories to keep track of anything important from the past.

===&quot;Smallville: Season 11&quot;===
In the comic book continuation of the television series &quot;Smallville,&quot; Batman has a safe house in the form of a cargo ship, known as &quot;Leviathan&quot;, docked at a hub in Metropolis. It is registered to a shell corporation in the Caribbean, thus protecting Bruce Wayne&#x27;s secret. However, it is compromised by the Intergang, Prankster, and Mister Freeze. Lex Luthor is also aware of Leviathan&#x27;s location due to his tracking of Superman&#x27;s radiation signature with his satellites. Wayne is later shown in the Batcave itself with Alfred when the Martian Manhunter infiltrates it to talk with Batman.

===&quot;Batman Beyond&quot;===
In the comic book series &quot;Batman Beyond 2.0&quot;, Terry McGinnis no longer uses the Batcave following an argument with Bruce. He now uses Dick Grayson&#x27;s apartment as his base of operations. When Terry is seriously injured in a battle with Rewire, he wakes up in the Batcave where Bruce has treated his injuries and left information regarding Rewire himself. He arrived there due to a built in subroutine in the suit that if the user is seriously injured or falls unconscious, the suit becomes automated and returns the user to the Batcave.

After arriving in the universe controlled by the Justice Lords Terry encounters a version of himself who is a member of the Jokerz known as &quot; T &quot;. Both McGinnis&#x27;s arrive at Wayne Manor to find that it had been destroyed by the Justice Lords. A gang of Jokerz then proceed to attack them with T giving Terry enough time to make his way to the badly damaged Batcave. After exploring the cave he finds a number of damaged display cases which contain an unknown Batgirl suit, Justice Lord Batman suit and a Red Robin suit. He then discovers an armored and more powerful version of his own Batsuit which is powered by synthetic Kryptonite. After defeating the Jokerz gang he is confronted by Justice Lord Superman.

Following the defeat of Lord Superman, T and Dick Grayson of the Justice Lords universe begin repairs to the Batcave and to the suit Terry found with the intention of T taking over as the new Batman and Dick becoming his mentor. They later help send Terry back to his own universe.

==In other media==

===Film===

====Serials====
The Batcave first became part of the Batman mythos in the 1943 15-chapter movie serial &quot;Batman&quot; starring Lewis Wilson. In this version, as later in the comics, it was a small cave with a desk and rock walls lit up by candles. Behind the desk is a large black bat symbol. The cave is connected to a crime lab. Bats were depicted as flying around the cave, although only their shadows were visible. Batman uses these bats as a scare tactic to make an apprehended enemy reveal information. To prevent the enemy from escaping, an iron door covers the exit.

The Batcave was also featured and expanded on in the 1949 serial &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; starring Robert Lowery. In this serial, there are filing cabinets and the cave now has a crime lab built in. The cave also contains the first incarnation of a batphone.

In both serials, the cave is accessed by walking through a grandfather clock.

====&quot;Batman&quot; (TV series)====

The 1960s live-action Batman TV series featured the Batcave extensively, and portrayed it as a large but well-lit cavern containing an atomic power generator, a chemistry lab, punch-card computers, and other electronic crime-fighting devices, almost always prominently labeled with their function. In this incarnation, it primarily served as a crime lab and garage for the Batmobile. In this version, the Batcave is accessed from Wayne Manor via two Bat-Poles (one marked BRUCE and the other marked DICK), which are hidden behind a bookcase that can be opened by turning a switch hidden inside a bust of Shakespeare. When Bruce and Dick slide down these Bat-Poles, they are instantly outfitted in their costumes before reaching the landing pads at the bottom. The Bat-Poles can also be used to lift Bruce and Dick up from the Batcave to Wayne Manor by use of the steamjet-propelled landing pads. The Batcave is also accessible via a service elevator used by Alfred.

====Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher films====
=====&quot;Batman&quot; (1989)=====

The cave is present in Tim Burton&#x27;s 1989 &quot;Batman&quot; feature film. The cave is shown to house the Batmobile, which is parked on a turntable-like platform at the edge of a large chasm filled with pipes, looking somewhat like a sewer. The Batmoblie enters the cave from a rock cliff/door. A huge switch turns on the lights in the cave. There are also bats roaming the cave. The cave also features the Batcomputer, which is on a metal platform. There is also an office-like workstation, some unspecified machinery and a large vault for Batman&#x27;s costume.

=====&quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992)=====

The cave is once again seen in &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, and Bruce gains access to it via a tube/elevator like passage from Wayne Manor, the entrance to which is hidden in an iron maiden, and is activated by flipping a small switch hidden on a small replica of Wayne Manor in the bottom of a fish tank. Alfred also confirms, in a throwaway remark, that there is a staircase to the cave. The cave was huge and well lit and featured a forensics lab, a computer, unspecified machines, a closet for the costumes, the Batmobile, and its repair tools.

=====&quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995)=====

In this film, the Batcave is accessed through a rotating shelf which led to a staircase in Wayne Manor&#x27;s silver closet, the only room in the mansion that is kept locked. The cave can also be reached via a secret tunnel system from Bruce Wayne&#x27;s office at Wayne Enterprises, through which he rides down in a capsule. The capsule has a communication device Bruce used to communicate with Alfred. The cave features the main computer, as well as a crime lab and canal, the latter of which provides sea access. The cave also includes a lengthy tunnel used to launch the Batwing, a rotating turntable that houses the Batmobile, and a large dome-like structure where Bruce&#x27;s Batsuits and gadgets are stored.

During an invasion of Wayne Manor by Riddler and Two-Face, Riddler destroys the Batcomputer, the crime lab, every Batsuit except for a prototype with a new sonar system, and the Batmobile, although there is a lower section containing the Batboat and the Batplane that Batman and the new Robin use to confront the villains. In the deleted scenes, the Batcave has a secret section that Bruce fell as a child during the funeral of his parents. After Riddler&#x27;s attack, Bruce and Alfred come to that place where Bruce fell back to where finding the diary of his father and confronting his biggest fear; the giant bat.

=====&quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997)=====

This incarnation of the cave features a multitude of flashing lights, mostly in neon. On the whole, this Batcave is similar to that in &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, only more garish in its decoration. A capsule containing Robin&#x27;s Redbird motorcycle rises out of the floor, and a long tunnel lined with neon lights leads out of the cave. The turntable holding the batmobile returns, but in a more elaborate fashion. The cave features the area used to store Batman&#x27;s costume and a place to store Robin&#x27;s.

====&quot;The Dark Knight Trilogy&quot;====

=====&quot;Batman Begins&quot;=====
In &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, the cave is still unfurnished, and the only things inside are a small workshop and a storage space for the Batsuit and its accessories, a medical area, and the Batmobile. The entrance and exit for the Batmobile are on a cliff, behind a waterfall. Alfred reveals to Bruce that during the Civil War, the Waynes used the vast cavern system as part of the Underground Railroad: after initially abseiling down a well to get into the cave, they discover a hidden Civil War-era mechanical elevator which is still functional and leads to a hidden entrance in the mansion, which they then use as the primary means of entrance to the cave. The elevator is accessed by tapping three keys on a piano. Near the end of the film, when Bruce talks to Alfred about rebuilding the burnt-down main section of Wayne Manor, Alfred suggests they &quot;improve the foundation&quot;, which may mean improving and furnishing the cave as they rebuild the mansion.

=====&quot;The Dark Knight&quot;=====
As Wayne Manor is still under construction in &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, Batman&#x27;s base of operations has been relocated to a large bunker beneath a shipping yard. One access point shown is through a shipping container which houses a secret hydraulic lift. The &quot;Bat-bunker&quot; also contains a wire mesh cage for the Batsuit, along with the associated weapons and tools, toolbox, and spare equipment for the Batmobile. In contrast to the Batcave, the large rectangular shaped room is brightly lit by banks of overhead fluorescent lights. Storage areas for the equipment are located both under the ground and within the walls giving the room a very empty appearance with the exception of a large bank of monitors to go with a well-developed computer system. In addition, the room is equipped with furnaces which Alfred uses to burn documents after Bruce decides to turn himself in.

=====&quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;=====
The Batcave reappears in &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; in full working condition. To access the cave, a similar way to &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, tapping three keys on the piano will reveal a now modernly built elevator which takes the passenger straight to the cave. The newest addition to the cave is &quot;The Bat&quot;, a flying tank aircraft built by Wayne Enterprises&#x27; Applied Science Division and a Batcomputer as well as numerous landing pads and a locking case which contains the Batsuit. Added features included that the bridges used to gain access to different sections can be submerged as well as the platforms as a form of security measures in case anyone gains unauthorized access to the cave. While submerged the only visible object is a Batcomputer terminal which can only be accessed by either Bruce or Alfred&#x27;s fingerprints and an access code. The cave from &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; appears as well, which contains weapons, supplies, and a back-up Batsuit. After Bruce Wayne is declared legally dead, his will is amended so that John Blake inherits GPS coordinates that lead him to the Batcave.

====&quot;DC Extended Universe&quot;====

=====&quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;=====
In this version, the Batcave is not located directly underneath Wayne Manor, but was originally in the woods on the manor&#x27;s outskirts, with Bruce discovering the cave when he fell into them after running away during his parents&#x27; funeral. After Wayne Manor was destroyed in some unspecified fire, Bruce and Alfred relocated to a glass house built above the Batcave, which consists primarily of a long access passage that leads to a nearby lake and can be used for the Batmobile or (presumably) the Batplane to gain access. The elevator leading to the house also includes a chamber with an old Robin costume, apparently a memorial, while an upper level includes the Batcomputer and a workshop where Bruce and Alfred can work on Batman&#x27;s various weapons, including the synthesiser used to distort his voice in the regular suit and the armour he uses to fight Superman.

=====&quot;Justice League&quot;=====
Following Superman&#x27;s death, Bruce continues to operate out of the Batcave, which it is revealed also includes a large hangar where he has been working on a secret troop transport for the team he has been planning to create following Superman&#x27;s death. As he works on the transport, he is visited by Diana, and notes that the cave&#x27;s security cost him millions of dollars. Once the team of himself, Diana, Barry Allen, Victor Stone and Arthur Curry have come together for the first time to confront the powerful Steppenwolf, Bruce takes them to the Batcave to plan their next move, with an excited Barry Allen running all around the cave in seconds upon arrival.

====&quot;The Batman&quot; franchise====
=====&quot;The Batman&quot; (2022)=====
A new version of the Batcave appears in &quot;The Batman&quot;. The Batcave is an old Wayne Terminus railway station into his hidden headquarters, accessed through a series of secret tunnels underneath Wayne Tower.

====&quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;====
The Batcave is featured in &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;. This version of the Batcave is more larger as it contains many versions of the Batmobile, Bat-themed vehicles and Batsuits.

It is controlled by Batman&#x27;s sentient, HAL-9000-like, Batcomputer (voiced by Siri), nicknamed &#x27;Puter&#x27;, who, as Batman enters the Batcave through a secret road on Wayne Island, asks him the password, which is &quot;Iron Man sucks&quot;.

===Television===

====Early appearances====
The Bat-Cave was first seen in animation in episodes of &quot;The Batman/Superman Hour&quot;, &quot;Super Friends&quot;, and &quot;The New Adventures of Batman&quot;. In these cartoons, the Batcomputer is present as usual. The voice of the Batcomputer was portrayed by Lou Scheimer in &quot;The New Adventures of Batman&quot;.

====&quot;DC Animated Universe&quot;====
=====&quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot;=====
In the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Beware the Gray Ghost&quot;, the Batcave is revealed to be a replica of the lair used by the Gray Ghost, a film character and Bruce&#x27;s idol. Bats are seen flying freely in the cave, with large naturally elevated platforms on which Robin practices balance. Batman&#x27;s numerous crime-fighting vehicles are seen parked in an adjacent compartment to the Batcave, with an adjoining subterranean garage which stores Bruce Wayne&#x27;s car collection.

In the episode &quot;Almost Got &#x27;Im&quot;, Two-Face uses a giant penny in an attempt to either crush Batman or kill him from the impact, depending on whichever side the giant coin landed on. Batman frees himself by slicing open the ropes. While telling the story of this to other Batman villains, Two-Face commented that Batman got to keep the giant coin.

Several entrances to the cave are seen throughout the series. In early episodes, Batman is seen using an elevator that is accessed through a secret door hidden behind a bookcase. In later episodes, he is seen using the classic grandfather clock entrance from the comics. In certain episodes, the clock-entrance is opened by setting the hands of the clock the time Bruce&#x27;s parents were killed, while in &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;, &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;, and &quot;Justice League&quot;, the pendulum is pulled from behind the face of the clock to unlock the entrance.

=====&quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;=====
In the episode &quot;Mean Seasons&quot; from &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;, Batman and Batgirl fight a giant mechanical T-Rex. The comic book tie-in to the &quot;Justice League&quot; Batman – &quot;Batman Adventures&quot; #12 – features a short called &quot;The Hidden Display&quot; which tells how a young Dick Grayson persuades Batman into keeping a robot T-Rex early on his career, which eventually leads to the Trophy Room of the Cave. Either one of these tales could be how the animated Batman obtained the dinosaur. An extensive training area allows Barbara Gordon to take on robots as part of her training.

=====&quot;Batman Beyond&quot;=====
This future Batcave of &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; houses replicas of Batman&#x27;s enemies (both as wax dummies and robot combat trainers), and a display case with the many permutations of costumes of Robin, Batgirl, Nightwing, and Batman himself. Other items which have been shown to be in the Cave include the Freeze Gun and helmet of Mr. Freeze, the puppet Scarface, a &#x27;shrine&#x27; to Bruce Wayne&#x27;s childhood TV hero, the Gray Ghost, and the costumes of Harley Quinn, Penguin, Riddler, Mad Hatter, Firefly, and Catwoman. During the series, Bruce typically remained in the Batcave to coordinate Terry&#x27;s efforts over the suit&#x27;s video-link, giving him information or offering advice, although he would enter the field if the situation desperately called for it.

=====&quot;Justice League&quot;=====

In the &quot;Justice League&quot; animated series, the members of the League seek refuge in the Batcave during the Thanagarian invasion. Later, they also confront Hawkgirl in the cave, and use the Batcomputer to track her. Later, the Batcave is attacked by the Thanagarians, which the League fend off.

====&quot;The Batman&quot;====

&quot;The Batman&quot; features a much more high-tech Batcave, with large computer displays and flashing blue lights. Among these displays are the &quot;Bat-Wave&quot; warning signals, an alternate way of calling upon the Caped Crusader before the Bat-Signal went into service. As a throwback to the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; series, the cave has assorted &#x27;Bat-poles&#x27; for Batman and Robin which allow them to traverse faster. Additionally, the episode &quot;Joker&#x27;s Express&quot; reveals that the Batcave is also connected to some old mines beneath the city that were created during its past as a coal-mining town in the late 1800s.

In the episode &quot;Artifacts&quot;, archaeologists from the future unearth the Batcave. Its titanium supports are printed with binary code, as the computer information would not survive that long. The archaeologists theorize that Thomas Wayne was Batman and that Bruce Wayne was Robin. In another segment of the episode, set in 2027, Barbara Gordon (as Oracle) is shown at the Batcomputer in the Batcave. The archaeologists also uncover her wheelchair, and believe that Alfred used it.

Unlike many other incarnations of the Batcave which only have one exit/entrance, the Batmobile and other vehicles exit the cave through a variety of concealed dead-ends and disguised construction sites scattered around Gotham City. Batman also established a series of satellite Batcaves across Gotham.

====&quot;Batman: The Brave and the Bold&quot;====

The Batcave appears in &quot;&quot;. This version displays numerous trophies that reference the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; series, namely a giant clam and slot-machine-themed electric chair. Additionally, a future version appears in &quot;Last Bat on Earth!&quot;, where a group of humanoid &quot;Man-Bats&quot; live in it and are driven out by Batman and Kamandi.

In &quot;Menace of the Conqueror Caveman!&quot;, Booster Gold mentions that the Batcave is a historical attraction in the 25th century.

==== &quot;Teen Titans&quot; ====
The Batcave makes a minor appearance in the &quot;Teen Titans&quot; episode &quot;Haunted&quot;.

==== &quot;Young Justice&quot; ====
The Batcave appears in the &quot;Young Justice&quot; episode &quot;Downtime&quot;.

==== &quot;Beware the Batman &quot; ====
In this version, the entrance to the Bat Cave is hidden behind a large fireplace in Bruce Wayne&#x27;s trophy room. Batman brings unconscious guests in, such as Man-Bat and Manhunter, for questioning. In the series finale, Deathstroke infiltrates the Batcave and attempts to destroy it before Batman stops him.

====&quot;Batwoman&quot;====

In the TV series &quot;Batwoman&quot;, Bruce has a Batcave in Wayne Towers which is used by his cousin Kate, Luke Fox and later Ryan Wilder when she takes over the Batwoman position. It was later revealed that a Batmobile was stored behind a hidden wall which Ryan used during her tenure as Batwoman.

====&quot;Titans&quot;====

The Batcave appears in &quot;Titans&quot;.

==== &quot;Batwheels&quot; ====
The Batcave appears in &quot;Batwheels&quot;. It is overseen by the Batcomputer (voiced by Kimberly Brooks) and original character M.O.E. (voiced by Mick Wingert).

===Video games===
The Batcave appears as a level in &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot;.

====&quot;Injustice&quot;====
In the video game &quot;&quot;, the Batcave is a level in the game, where the fighters can use Batman&#x27;s various weapons and vehicles to damage their opponent; Green Arrow faces a villainous Wonder Woman and Black Adam in the Batcave when attempting to acquire a Kryptonite weapon to defeat the corrupted Superman of an alternate reality, and the &#x27;true&#x27; Batman faces the alternate Batman in a fight in the Batcave to convince him to go along with the plan of summoning the Superman of their world to defeat the villainous alternate Superman.

A new version of the Batcave appears as a level in &quot;Injustice 2&quot;. This version was originally the Gotham Underground Subway built by Bruce&#x27;s great-grandfather. It&#x27;s also where Bruce keeps his communications and surveillance hub, Brother Eye. It is currently unknown if Batman reclaimed the original Batcave and Wayne Manor after the fall of Superman and The Regime.

====&quot;Lego Batman&quot;====

The Batcave appears in &quot;Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes&quot;. It features three parking &#x27;areas&#x27; for land, sea and air based vehicles and their appropriate exits from the cave, the Batcomputer, used to replay past levels and &#x27;warp&#x27; to various landmarks in Gotham and other elements shown in Batman media such as a waterfall, a Lincoln Penny and an animatronic T-Rex.

====&quot;Batman: Arkham&quot;====

In the 2009 video game &quot;,&quot; Batman can access a secret auxiliary Batcave hidden within the cave system beneath Arkham Island after the Joker takes control of the asylum. This Batcave is small and fairly spartan compared to its comic counterpart, containing only two small platforms, a Batcomputer, and one of Batman&#x27;s Batwing planes. Near the end of the game this cave was partially destroyed by Poison Ivy.

Although not featured in the main story, the Batcave does appear as a downloadable challenge map in &quot;&quot;. During the main story, Batman is able to access the Batcomputer&#x27;s database via his batsuit and can upload data to Alfred who can analyze it using the Batcomputer back at the Batcave.

The Batcave is accessible in the main campaign of &quot;&quot;. From the cave the player can use the Batwing fast travel system, switch to alternate skins and enter the challenge map rooms as opposed to selecting from the main menu as in previous Arkham games. Alfred is also present in the cave, supplying Batman with gadget upgrades. The Batcave is heavily damaged by Bane during the game&#x27;s climax. It is still damaged during the DLC &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot;, set on New Year&#x27;s Eve, just after the events of the main game.

Although the Batcave is not accessible in &quot;&quot;, Alfred coordinates all activity from it. He also activates the Knightfall Protocol from within the cave using Bruce&#x27;s voice authorization password &quot;Martha&quot;. When Wayne Manor was destroyed after Bruce activates the protocol, it is unknown if the Batcave survived. Throughout the game, both Batman and Robin utilize a Bat-Bunker of sorts underneath Panessa Studios, where Robin works to cure those infected by Joker&#x27;s blood. The bunker contains holding cells for each infected patient, as well as medical equipment and a Bat-computer.

<text>The Archdiocese of Detroit () is a Latin Church ecclesiastical territory, or archdiocese, of the Catholic Church covering the south-east portion of Michigan in the United States.

The archdiocese consists counties of Lapeer, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, and Wayne. It is the metropolitan archdiocese of the Ecclesiastical Province of Detroit, which includes all the dioceses in the state of Michigan. In 2000, the archdiocese accepted pastoral responsibility for the Catholic Church in the Cayman Islands.

The Diocese of Detroit was erected on March 8, 1833, and elevated to an archdiocese on May 22, 1937. The Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament has served as the mother church of the archdiocese since 1938. The Basilica of Sainte Anne de Détroit is the second oldest continuously operating Catholic parish in the United States, dating to 1701. In the early 21st century the archdiocese faced a sexual abuse scandal, starting with four priests convicted in 2003 of sexual abuse of minors.

==History==
=== 1600 to 1700 ===
The first Catholic presence in present-day Michigan was that of the French Jesuit missionaries, Reverends Charles Raymbaut and Isaac Jogues. The two priests stopped near what is now Sault Ste. Marie in 1641 to visit the Chippewa Nation.

In 1670, Reverend Claude Dablon established the first Catholic mission in the region on Mackinac Island. Reverend Jacques Marquette moved the mission off the island in 1671 to the mainland by the Straits of Mackinac. By the late 1600s, Jesuits priests were exploring and setting up missions throughout the region.

=== 1700 to 1800 ===

In 1701, the Diocese of Quebec took jurisdiction over missionary activity in Michigan, now part of the French colony of New France. In July of that year, a group of French-Canadian settlers, led by the explorer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, arrived at the mouth of the Detroit River. They immediately started building the first Sainte-Anne-de-Détroit Church, a small wooden structure.

When the British took control of New France after the French and Indian War ended in 1763, the Diocese of Quebec retained its jurisdiction there. After the end of the American Revolution, the British transferred control of Michigan to the new United States. In 1789, Pope Pius VI erected the Diocese of Baltimore, with jurisdiction over Catholics in the entire United States.

=== 1800 to 1850 ===

The new Michigan Territory was transferred in 1808 from the Diocese of Baltimore to the Diocese of Bardstown. It was reassigned in 1821 to the Diocese of Cincinnati.

Pope Gregory XVI erected the Diocese of Detroit on March 8, 1833, taking its territory from the Diocese of Cincinnati. He named Monsignor Frederick Rese from Cincinnati as its first bishop. Ste. Anne became the cathedral for the diocese. At the time, the new diocese covered a vast area in the American Midwest and Great Plains, extending through Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Dakotas to the Missouri River. During Rese&#x27;s tenure, the diocese was in poor financial health and suffered from financial mismanagement.

By 1837, Rese was incapable of administering the diocese due to mental health problems. Gregory XVI recalled him to Rome and appointed Reverend Peter Paul Lefevere as coadjutor bishop to assume its operation.

When Lefevere arrived in Detroit, the city had only two parishes, with the rest of the diocese having only 25; the diocese was served by only 18 priests. Lefevere went to Belgium to recruit more priests. The Redemptorists became the first religious order to staff a parish in the diocese.

To improve the administration of the diocese, Lefevere established its first set of policies in 1843. That same year, the Vatican reduced the Diocese of Detroit to the State of Michigan, transferring the out-of-state territories to the newly-formed Diocese of Milwaukee. He won a dispute with some of the laity over the ownership of church property. Lefevere bought property throughout the diocese for future churches.

Lefevere and the Four Sisters of Charity established four orphanages, a medical hospital and a mental hospital. The Daughters of Charity became the first religious order of teaching sisters to come to Detroit. The Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary came to the diocese in 1845. In 1846, Lefevere established St. Thomas Seminary in Detroit, a minor seminary that closed in 1854.

=== 1850 to 1880 ===

In 1853, Pope Pius IX formed the Vicarate Apostolic of Upper Michigan, taking the Upper Peninsula of Michigan from the Diocese of Detroit. Lefevere in 1854 dedicated Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral in Detroit, which replaced Ste. Anne de Detroit. He presided over the first diocesan synod in 1859.

Lefevere died in 1869. He never became bishop of Detroit because Rese was still alive, living in a sanitarium in Europe. During Lefevere&#x27;s time as coadjutor bishop, the number of parishes in Detroit increased to 11 and 160 in the rest of the diocese, with 80 priests.

To replace Lefevere as coadjutor bishop of Detroit, Pope Pius IX in 1870 named Monsignor Caspar Borgess of Cincinnati. When Rese died the next year, Borgess automatically succeeded him as bishop of Detroit.

During his tenure as bishop, Borgess earned a reputation as a stern disciplinarian who emphasized his authority. A Catholic property owner in Kalamazoo mortgaged his farm to loan money to his pastor to pay for the construction of St. Augustine&#x27;s Church. However, since the archdiocese now owned the church, Borgess reneged on repaying the loan. When the property owner sued the diocese, Borgess threatened to excommunicate him. The property owner resigned himself to the swindle. Borgess suspended a priest who published a critical letter about the St. Augustine controversy.

In 1877, the Vatican reinstated a priest whom Borgess had transferred from a parish in Marshall to Traverse City. due to his dissatisfaction with the parish financial reports. That same year, he invited the Jesuits to establish the University of Detroit Jesuit High School in Detroit.

=== 1880 to 1900 ===
In 1882, the Vatican erected the Diocese of Grand Rapids in west central Michigan, taking its territory from the Diocese of Detroit. Borgess suspended the pastor of St. Albertus Parish in Detroit in 1885; when the congregation refused to accept their new pastor, Borgess placed the parish under interdict. These controversies and his poor relationship with his priests led Borgess to submit his resignation to the Vatican as bishop of Detroit as early as 1879. However, the Vatican would not let him resign his post until 1887.

The next bishop of Detroit was Reverend John Samuel Foley from Baltimore, named by Pope Leo XIII in 1888. During his tenure, Foley established a seminary for Polish Americans, and later healed a long and damaging schism among them. In 1889, Reverend John A. Lemke was ordained to the priesthood at St. Casimir Church in Detroit. He became the first native American of Polish descent to become a priest.

=== 1900 to 1930 ===
In 1907, St. Francis&#x27;s Home for Orphan Boys opened in Detroit, built at a cost of $250,000. Foley established the first parish for African Americans, St. Peter Claver, in Detroit, in 1911, although chapels and missions for African-American Catholics had existed since the late 1870s. The development of the automobile industry in Detroit led to a massive increase in population, and the number of Catholics in the diocese more than tripled during Foley&#x27;s tenure. Although the number of diocesan priests nearly doubled, there still insufficient to minister to the growing population. Despite his popularity and personal charm, Foley was generally regarded as an ineffective bishop with an unsuccessful administration. Foley died in 1918, after 30 years as bishop of Detroit.

The last bishop of Detroit was Bishop Michael Gallagher from Grand Rapids, appointed by Pope Benedict XV in 1918. In 1921, the archdiocese published a poster prohibiting the provision of sterilization and abortion services in its hospitals. This became the basis of the &quot;Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services,&quot; published by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops in 1971&quot;.&quot; In 1919, Gallagher opened Sacred Heart Major Seminary in a temporary structure in Detroit to alleviate the priest shortage. In 1924, after a $4 million fundraising effort, the diocese constructed a permanent facility with a capacity for 500 seminarians.

In 1926, Gallagher appointed Reverend Charles Coughlin as pastor of the Shrine of the Little Flower Parish in Royal Oak, Michigan. Coughlin soon started a radio ministry, with Gallagher&#x27;s approval. Some of the proceeds from his show went to build a church for his parish. As Coughlin started gaining a large national audience for his program, his incendiary comments against Jews and capitalists became more pronounced.

=== 1930 to 1940 ===
In 1930, the apostolic delegate for the United States, Cardinal Pietro Fumasoni Biondi, asked Gallagher to curb Coughlin, but Gallagher refused. &quot;I made no mistake and have never doubted my judgment in putting him before the microphone,&quot; Gallagher said about Coughlin in 1933.

Again in 1935, Cardinal Amleto Cigognani, the new apostolic delegate, tried to stop Coughlin, but Gallagher still protected him. It was rumored that Pope Pius XI refused to raise Detroit to an archdiocese due to his displeasure over Coughlin. In August 1936, Gallagher went to Rome on a routine visit to the Vatican. While he was en route, Coughlin denounced US President Franklin Roosevelt as a liar. Gallagher expressed his public displeasure at Coughlin&#x27;s comments, forcing him to apologize. While meeting with Pius XI, Coughlin&#x27;s activities arose for discussion. Gallagher convinced the pope not to censure Coughlin or force him to cease broadcasting. Some months later, Gallagher died in January 1937.

In May 1937, Pius XI elevated the Diocese of Detroit to the Archdiocese of Detroit, while also erecting the Diocese of Lansing in south central Michigan, taking its territory from the Diocese of Detroit. In August 1937, Pius XI appointed Bishop Edward Mooney from the Diocese of Rochester as Detroit&#x27;s first archbishop. 

In October 1937, Mooney publicly rebuked Coughlin for calling Roosevelt &quot;stupid&quot; over his nomination of Senator Hugo Black to the U.S. Supreme Court. This reprimand from Mooney led Coughlin to cancel his contract for 26 radio broadcasts, though he resumed broadcasting in 1938. (Coughlin&#x27;s anti-Semitism became more blatant with the outbreak of World War II, leading Mooney to repeatedly rebuke him and radio stations refusing to air his broadcasts. By 1940, Coughlin had virtually no access to the airwaves, though he continued to publish his views.)

In February 1938, the Vatican erected the Diocese of Saginaw, taking territory in northeastern Michigan from the Archdiocese of Detroit and the Diocese of Grand Rapids. The Vatican also transferred three more counties from the archdiocese to the Diocese of Lansing. In April 1938, the Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament in Detroit became the mother church of the new archdiocese.

In a 1939 meeting of all the archdiocesan priests, Mooney proposed the establishment of labor schools in the parishes to help &quot;Christian workers to train themselves in principle and technique to assume the leadership in the unions which their numbers justify&quot;. An avid golf player, Mooney once remarked to his priests &quot;If your score is over 100, you are neglecting your golf—if it falls below 90, you&#x27;re neglecting your parish&quot;. Every year, he would take a group of altar boys to the opening game of the Detroit Tigers major league baseball team.

=== 1940 to 1950 ===
In 1942, the US Department of Justice informed Mooney that it was planning to indict Coughlin on charges of sedition, based on his espousal of Nazi doctrines. As part of a deal to avoid Coughlin&#x27;s prosecution, Mooney ordered him to end his political activities and work solely as a parish priest. Mooney stated, &quot;My understanding with him [Coughlin] is sufficiently broad and firm to exclude effectively the recurrence of any such unpleasant situation.&quot; Pope Pius XII created Mooney as cardinal priest of the Church of Santa Susanna in Rome in 1946.

As the northern suburbs of Detroit grew after World War II ended in 1945, Mooney added parishes in Oakland County. In 1948, he appointed Reverend Frederick Delaney to begin opening additional parishes in the rural areas of the county. That same year, Pope Pius XII named Bishop John Dearden from the Diocese of Pittsburgh as coadjutor archbishop to assist Mooney.

=== 1950 to 1980 ===
After Mooney died in 1958, Dearden automatically succeeded him as archbishop of Detroit. He was active in community causes, such as supporting equal employment opportunities and encouraging his diocese to work for better racial relations in Detroit. His commitment to racial justice frequently put him at odds with priests and lay Catholics at the parish level, who organized to fight racial integration of their neighborhoods.

In 1965, Dearden helped inaugurate Project Equality, an interfaith program that asked businesses to pledge to a policy of non-discrimination in hiring and hire employees. He also announced that the archdiocese would give preferential treatment to suppliers who provided equal employment opportunities to minority groups.

When voters amended the Michigan State Constitution in 1970 to bar all taxpayer aid to private schools in 1970, Dearden ordered all of his parishes to examine their finances in light of this decision and determine if their schools would be a financial drain due to reduced enrollment. Dearden ultimately ordered the closing of 56 parish schools. That same year, the Vatican transferred two counties from the Archdiocese of Detroit to the Diocese of Lansing.

After the permanent diaconate was restored during the Second Vatican Council, Dearden in 1971 became the first American bishop or archbishop to ordain married laymen as deacons.

=== 1980 to 2000 ===

After suffering a heart attack, Dearden retired as archbishop of Detroit in 1980. To replace Dearden, Pope John Paul II named Bishop Edmund Szoka from the Diocese of Gaylord. In 1983, he dealt with Sister Agnes Mary Mansour, who was appointed as the director of the Michigan Department of Community Health. This state agency provided Medicaid funding for abortion services for women. Szoka had given Mansour permission to take the job, but insisted that she oppose publicly funded abortion services. Mansour believed that abortion was a tragic decision for the pregnant woman, but should be legal. She refused to oppose public funding of it. Szoka then appealed to Mansour&#x27;s superiors in the Sisters of Mercy to order Mansour to change her stance, but the order supported her.

In 1989, Szoka closed 30 parishes within the archdiocese and ordered 25 other parishes to improve their financial situation or face closure. The plan resulted from a five-year study that analyzed parish maintenance costs, priest availability, parish income and parish membership. Szoka resigned as archbishop of Detroit in 1990 to assume a position in the Roman Curia.

The next archbishop of Detroit was Bishop Adam Maida from the Diocese of Green Bay, appointed by John Paul II in 1990.

=== 2000 to present ===

In 2007, Maida relieved Auxiliary Bishop Emeritus Thomas Gumbleton of his pastoral duties at St. Leo Parish in Detroit. Gumbleton claimed that Maida was punishing him for his outspoken views on sexual abuse crimes by clergy. Maida said that he was following the Vatican rules on the retirement age of bishops. Maida retired in 2009. Pope Benedict XVI then named Bishop Allen Vigneron from the Diocese of Oakland as Maida&#x27;s replacement.

In 2011, Vigneron announced that Pope Benedict XVI had approved his request to name Saint Anne as patroness of the archdiocese. In 2012, Vigneron announced a new plan to consolidate parishes in order to address declining parish membership and clergy availability within the archdiocese. Under the plan, two parishes would close in 2012 and 60 others were to consolidate into 21 parishes by the end of 2013. The archdiocese asked six additional parishes to submit plans to either repay their debts or merge with other parishes. The remaining 214 parishes were asked to submit plans to share resources or merge.

In 2019, Vigneron published the pastoral note &quot;The Day of the Lord&quot;. This note ended required Sunday sports practices and games in Catholic schools so that students could spend that day focused on prayer, family and rest. Vigneron announced in June 2020 that the archdiocese was restructuring 200 parishes into 60 to 80 parish families to deal with the shortage of priests.

===Sexual abuse===
In 2002, Wayne County prosecutors indicted Reverends Harry Benjamin, Robert Burkholder, Edward Olszewski, and Jason E. Sigler on criminal sexual conduct charges. The four priests, all residing outside of Michigan, had previously been incardinated in the Archdiocese of Detroit. They were all accused of sexually molesting 11 to 13-year-old boys.

In May 2019, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel indicted two priests who had previously served in the archdiocese:

* Neil Kalina, a former priest at St. Kiernan Parish in Shelby Township, was indicted on four counts of second-degree criminal sexual conduct in 1984 with a boy between the ages of 12 and 14 and for supplying the boy with cocaine and marijuana. He had left the priesthood in 1993 after a 1985 conviction in Michigan for drug possession. Kalina was convicted and sentenced in July 2022 to up to 15 years in state prison.
* Reverend Patrick Casey was charged with raping a 24-year-old gay man in 2013. At the time of the assault, Casey was counseling the victim, who was experiencing suicidal feelings, during confession. Casey fondled the victim and then performed oral sex on him. In October 2019, Casey pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of aggravated assault and was sentenced to 45 days in jail.

In July 2019, the archdiocese removed Reverend Eduard Perrone, pastor of Assumption Grotto Parish in Detroit from public ministry after determining that allegations that he sexually abused a child decades ago were &quot;credible&quot;. Perrone denied the charges. The archdiocese took action based on accusations from a Wayne County police detective who claimed that Perrone sexually assaulted a boy 40 years earlier. However, the alleged victim later retracted his allegations. In August 2020, Perrone received a $125,000 settlement from Wayne County for a defamation lawsuit he filed against the detective That same month, 20 parishioners from Assumption Grotto sued the archdiocese. They claimed that the archdiocese framed Perrone on the sexual abuse allegations because he was a traditionalist Catholic priest who had allegedly exposed scandals in the archdiocese. Perrone was found guilty of three violations of canon law in May 2022. He was allowed to resume public ministry, but could not return to Assumption Grotto.

In July 2019, Reverend Joseph Baker was indicted on first-degree criminal sexual conduct with someone under age 13. The archdiocese had previously placed limits on his public ministry. Baker was convicted in October 2022 and was sentenced to three to 15 years in prison.

In September 2020, Reverend Gary Berthiaume was charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old at Our Lady of Sorrows Parish in Farmington during the 1970s. He was additionally charged in June 2021 with sexually assault two young teenagers at St. Joseph Catholic Church in Wyandotte during the same time period. Berthiaume pleaded guilty in November 2021 to two counts of second-degree criminal sexual conduct and no contest to one count of gross indecency in the two cases. He was sentenced to 16 to 17 months in prison.

In December 2020, several male employees of Orchard Lake Schools in Orchard Lake, Michigan, sued their employer and Vigneron. They alleged that Reverend Miroslaw Krol, the director of the Schools, had sexually abused them. Although the Schools were located in the archdiocese, they were not operated by it. However, the lawsuit stated that Vigneron, as a member of the Schools board, knew about the accusations against Krol and did nothing about them.

In March 2021, a Michigan man filed a lawsuit against Vigneron and the archdiocese. The plaintiff claimed that he was raped in 2010, when he was eight years old, by Aloysius Volskis, then a teacher at Bishop Kelly Catholic School in Lapeer, Michigan. Volskis allegedly told the boy that he had power with the devil and would kill his mother if the boy revealed anything about the assault. After a female student reported an assault by Volskis to police, he fled the country. The suit claimed that Vigneron and the archdiocese were negligent in their oversight of the school. Volkis had been assigned to Bishop Kelly after he was accused of sexual misconduct at Divine Providence Parish in Southfield, Michigan.

The archdiocese in June 2021 restrict the public ministry of Reverend Lawrence Fares, a 96-year-old retired priest. It had received credible allegations in 2019 of child sexual abuse against him, dating back to his early years as a priest.

=== LGBTQ community ===
In 1974, Brian McNaught, a reporter and columnist for the &quot;Michigan Catholic&quot; newspaper, revealed in a &quot;Detroit News&quot; article that he was gay. The &quot;Catholic&quot; then dropped his column, citing space issues in the publication. In response, McNaught filed a complaint against the &quot;Catholic&quot; with the Human Rights Commission for the City of Detroit, claiming sexual discrimination. The newspaper ultimately fired him. McNaught later founded the Detroit chapter of DignityUSA, a support organization for LGBTQ Catholics.

Vigneron in 2013 stated that he would not allow Catholics who support same-sex marriage to receive communion in the archdiocese. He said that taking communion while disagreeing with the church on this issue was &quot;double-dealing that is not unlike perjury.&quot;

In 2020, the archdiocese fired Terry Gonda, the music director at St. John Fisher Parish in Auburn Hills, for being married to another woman. In August 2020, Vigneron banned DignityUSA and Fortunate Families, a ministry for families of LGBTQ Catholics, from gathering at archdiocesan churches or having priests perform mass for them. He stated that the two groups were incompatible with the virtue of chastity.

Vigneron wrote a pastoral letter in 2024 to the leaders of Catholic schools and other institutions in the archdiocese. It stated that all their employees, students, and youth program participants must &quot;...respect their God-given biological sex.&quot; This meant that transgender individuals had to use restrooms and follow dress codes that corresponded to their so-called biological sex. Vigneron said that accommodating &quot;individuals experiencing gender confusion&quot; is dangerous. In a podcast following his letter, Vigneron called acceptance of transgender individuals by society as &quot;...a toxin that&#x27;s been deposited in our culture&quot; and compared transgenderism to a virus.

== Coat of arms ==

In June 2017, the archdiocese adopted a new coat of arms. It features the archdiocesan patroness St. Anne, three stars representing the Holy Trinity, a door representing Blessed Solanus Casey of Detroit, and waves representing the Great Lakes. It replaced a coat of arms featuring antlers and martlets that dated back to 1937.

==Churches and regions==

The Archdiocese of Detroit is divided into four administrative regions:

* Central – Detroit
* Northeast – Macomb and St. Clair Counties
* Northwest – Oakland and Lapeer Counties
* South – Monroe County, the Downriver area of Detroit, and the cities of Dearborn, Livonia, and Plymouth

Each region is divided into vicariates. In 2021, to promote a more missionary focus, the archdiocese grouped its parishes into families. Each family consists of three or more parishes that are close to each other.

The Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament has served as the mother church of the archdiocese since 1938. Earlier cathedrals were:

* Ste. Anne de Detroit, 1833 to 1848 
* Sts. Peter and Paul, 1848 to 1877 
* St. Aloysius (as pro-cathedral), 1877 to 1890 
* St. Patrick, 1890 to 1938

==Schools==

In 1964, the archdiocese operated 360 schools with an enrollment of 203,000 students. These included 110 primary schools and 55 secondary schools. The Catholic school population decreased over the decades due to the increase of charter schools, the rise in tuition at Catholic schools, the small number of African-American Catholics, the exodus of White Catholics to the suburbs, and the decreased number of teaching nuns.

As of 2024, the archdiocese was operating 24 secondary schools and 62 primary schools, serving 27,000 students.

<doc id="305538" wikidata="Q1207992" url="?curid=305538" title="GY Andromedae">
<text>GY Andromedae (GY And) is an α2 Canum Venaticorum type binary variable star in the northern constellation Andromeda. Its brightness fluctuates in visual magnitude between 6.27m and 6.41m, making it a challenge to view with the naked eye even in good seeing conditions. The magnetic activity on this star shows an unusually long period of variability, cycling about once every 23 years. Based upon parallax measurements, this star is located at a distance of about from the Earth.

This is classified as an Ap/Bp star, with a peculiar spectrum showing lines of chromium and europium that change in intensity over a period matching the variability cycle, although opposite in phase. Its most striking characteristic is the presence of the unstable element promethium in its emission spectrum. All isotopes of this element are radioactive with half lives of 17.7 years or less. The promethium in the outer envelope may be generated by the spontaneous fission of higher mass transuranic elements.

==System==
Based on radial velocity measurements taken at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory between 1927 and 1935 Canadian astronomer William Edmund Harper strongly suspected that this star was a spectroscopic binary. In 1958, American astronomer Horace W. Babcock confirmed the binary nature of the star. It has an orbital period of 273 days with a large eccentricity of 0.47. The two components are separated by an estimated distance of at least , or 0.25 Astronomical Units.

<text>Henry Massie Rector (May 1, 1816August 12, 1899) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the sixth governor of Arkansas from 1860 to 1862.

== Early life and education ==
Henry Massie Rector was born in Louisville, Kentucky, the son of Fannie Bardella (Thruston) and Elias Rector. His Rector family descended from the German-speaking families of Germanna in the Colony of Virginia, though both parents were also of English descent. He was educated by his mother and attended two years of school in Louisville. He moved to Arkansas in 1835, where he was later appointed U.S. Marshal.

== Political career ==
Rector was elected to the Arkansas Senate and served in that body from 1848 to 1850. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1854. From 1853 to 1857, he served as U.S. Surveyor-General of Arkansas for several years. From 1855 to 1859, he served in the Arkansas House of Representatives and spent one term as a justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court.

===Governor of Arkansas===

Rector was elected Governor of Arkansas in 1860. During his term Arkansas seceded from the U.S. and was admitted into the Confederate States. The constitution of Arkansas was rewritten reducing the term of office for Governor to two years. At the Arkansas secession convention in March 1861, Rector addressed the convention in an oratory urging the extension of slavery:

Rector left office in 1862 and served as a private in the state militia for the rest of the war. He participated in the 1874 Arkansas Constitutional Convention.

== Personal life ==
Rector was the first cousin of Representative Henry Conway, Governor James Conway and Governor Elias Conway. Rector was also a third cousin of General James Kemper. He was a first cousin of fellow Confederate general Alexander Steen.

His son, Elias, ran for Governor of Arkansas twice and served in the Arkansas House of Representatives for several terms, served as Speaker of the House, and married the daughter of Senator James Alcorn of Mississippi. His grandson, James, was the first Arkansan to participate in the Olympic Games.

== Death ==
Rector died in Little Rock and is buried in Mount Holly Cemetery there.

== Memorials ==
Rector Street in Little Rock is named after him. The north-bound frontage road along Interstate 30 bears his name. The northeast Arkansas town of Rector is also named after him.

<doc id="305546" wikidata="Q25039722" url="?curid=305546" title="Gold-dipped roses">
<text>Gold-dipped roses, or gold-trimmed roses, are real roses that are cut and preserved in a protective shell of gold to make them last a long time. These roses are often given as gifts on special occasions like Mother&#x27;s Day, Valentine&#x27;s Day, wedding anniversaries, birthdays, and other celebrations and events. The idea behind gold-dipped roses is to preserve the elegance and beauty of a rose forever in a metal that is just as exquisite and valuable as the rose itself, and to make a permanent and lasting expression of the emotions expressed by the giving of roses.

==History==
The concept of gold-dipped roses has been around for quite a long time. However, the techniques of making a rose have improved, paying special attention to intricate details, so that all the features of a rose are enhanced, protected, and beautified. If the process of gold-dipping, the rose and the gold used are of good quality, the gold-dipped rose can be made to last a lifetime.

==Varieties==
Other varieties of dipped roses include silver, platinum, and even tin roses. Petals, leaves, and rose orchids are also dipped in precious metals for preservation and decoration.

==Procedure==
Different companies have different techniques and procedures for making gold-dipped roses, and most of the steps involved are patented by each company and are trade secrets. Dipping or plating a rose is a time-consuming and painstaking process that involves multiple steps and weeks to prepare the finished product.

===Method===
Some companies claim that it requires 60 steps and 3 months of delicate processing to make a gold-dipped rose, while others profess that it requires 30 days to make the end product. However, the basic procedure, especially for small-scale processing, is the same; a rose, grown especially for the purpose of dipping or plating, is cut and layered with lacquer or an electrophoresing chemical and then dipped in molten gold (or another metal) to make a hard shell of metal. At the commercial level, several companies use the process of electroplating the rose with gold for a more durable and professional look. Simplified steps of the process are as below:

# A healthy and purpose-grown rose which is not yet fully bloomed is selected;
# The rose is hand-painted or sprayed with lacquer or an electrophoresing chemical so that the metal will stick to it, and left to dry, which may take 24 hours;
# The gold is melted, and the rose is dipped into it bud-first, holding the stem, for between 60 and 90 seconds, depending upon the desired thickness of the metal. If a light coating is required, it is dipped for less than 60 seconds; for a heavier coating, it is dipped for more than 90 seconds.
# An alternative method, which is especially used for commercial processing, is complete electroplating of the rose first with metals such as copper, and then a final coating of gold.
# The rose is left to dry until a hard shell is formed, which may take a couple of days, depending on factors such as wind and humidity.

The idea is to preserve the delicacy, features, and pattern of the rose so that it is evident even through the gold plating.

==Cost==
Gold-dipped roses are available for anywhere between $69 and $299, depending on the technique and vendors, the karat of the gold that is used for dipping, and the thickness of the coating. Some cheaper roses are coated with tin and then lightly sprayed with gold of a lesser quality, like 10 karat. Good quality roses are dipped in 24K gold, and hence are expensive.

<text>Elias Nelson Conway (May 17, 1812 – February 28, 1892) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the fifth governor of Arkansas from 1852 to 1860.

==Early life==
Conway was born in Greeneville, Tennessee. Born into a political family, Elias Nelson Conway was the younger brother of Henry Wharton Conway, who served as territorial delegate to several Congresses, and James Sevier Conway, who became the first governor of Arkansas when it was admitted as a state in 1836. Another brother, William Conway, served on the Arkansas Supreme Court.

When he was a boy, his family moved from Tennessee to Missouri. Conway attended Bonne Femme Academy in Boone County, Missouri. His older brother Henry died in 1827 as a result of a duel with a former friend, Robert Crittenden.

In 1833, Conway moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, where his older brothers had settled. He studied surveying. In 1835, he was appointed as the state auditor, and served until 1849.
==Political career==
In 1844, Elias Conway was offered, and declined, the Democratic nomination for governor. When offered the nomination again in 1852, he accepted. With a successful campaign, he was elected as Governor of Arkansas. He was reelected to a second term in 1856.

His administration focused on physical improvements to the state: roads and other infrastructure to encourage development. He formed the Chancery Courts and eased the state&#x27;s financial problems. When Conway left office in 1860, the state treasury held a surplus.

Conway formed the Geological Survey of Arkansas, commissioning Principal Geologist David Dale Owen, to survey the territory west of Little Rock and provide a report on the area. The &#x27;Natural Steps&#x27; were first written about and drawn by Owen, in his &quot;Second Report of a Geological Reconnaissance of the Middle and Southern Counties of Arkansas (1859).&quot;

==Personal life==
Conway was first cousin of Ambrose H. Sevier and Governor Henry M. Rector.

==Death==
After Conway retired from public life, he became somewhat of a recluse, and died in Little Rock. Conway is buried at the historic Mount Holly Cemetery in Little Rock, Arkansas.

<text>Washington, D.C., has been home to many prominent musicians and is particularly known for the musical genres of Jazz, Rhythm &amp; Blues,
bluegrass, punk rock and its locally-developed descendants hardcore and emo, and a local funk genre called go-go. The first major musical figure from District of Columbia was John Philip Sousa, a military brass band composer. Later figures include jazz musicians, such as Duke Ellington, Charlie Rouse, Buck Hill, Ron Holloway, Davey Yarborough, Michael A. Thomas, Butch Warren, and DeAndrey Howard; soul musicians, including Billy Stewart, The Unifics, The Moments, Ray, Goodman &amp; Brown, Van McCoy, The Presidents, The Choice Four, Vernon Burch, guitarist Charles Pitts (OST &quot;Shaft&quot;, 1971), and Sir Joe Quarterman &amp; Free Soul.

==Overview==
The District is home to the Washington Symphony Orchestra, the Washington National Opera, the National Symphony Orchestra (founded in 1931 by Hans Kindler), the DC Legendary Musicians Inc. a nonprofit founded by Rev. Dr. Sandra Butler Truesdale (founded in 2002) www.dclmusicians.org and the DC Youth Orchestra Program (founded in 1960). The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is a nationally important venue for a variety of musical performances, many of which are presented by Washington Performing Arts Society, an independent, non-profit organization founded by impresario Patrick Hayes. &quot;Washingtonian&quot; magazine maintains a Washington Music Hall of Fame.

The United States Marine Band, and United States Navy Band are both based in Washington, D.C. The Marine Band is the oldest musical group in the United States (formed in 1798, before the District&#x27;s founding). The U.S. Marine Band&#x27;s most famous conductor is John Philip Sousa, who composed many of the most famous American marches, as well as several musical comedies. The U.S. Navy Band&#x27;s director throughout the 1960s was LCDR Anthony A. Mitchell who composed the march &quot;Our Nation&#x27;s Capital&quot;, the official march of Washington, D.C., as well as the &quot;John F. Kennedy Cultural Center March&quot;, and the &quot;National Capitol Parks March&quot;.

==Music history==
The U.S. Marine Band was founded in 1798. Some fifty years later, in 1851, the District&#x27;s first choral society, the Washington Saengerbund, was formed. Other 19th century musicians included the minstrel singer and songwriter James Bland (&quot;Carry Me Back to Old Virginny&quot;). In 1872, the Coloured American Opera Society formed.

Washington native John Philip Sousa was conductor of the U.S. Marine Band from 1880 to 1892. He wrote 132 marches, including &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;. Sousa formed his own band after leaving the Marine Corps that performed 15,623 concerts worldwide.

Later groundbreaking musicians included James Reese Europe, ragtime musician Claude Hopkins, Lithuanian immigrant and vaudeville performer Al Jolson and Lillian Evanti, who became the first African-American opera singer to perform in a foreign country. The most widely renowned musician from 20th century District of Columbia is undoubtedly Duke Ellington, a jazz pioneer. Later District of Columbia jazz musicians included Charlie Rouse (saxophonist, with Thelonious Monk), Billy Hart (drummer), Ira Sullivan (tenor saxophonist) and Leo Parker (bop baritone saxophonist). Ahmet Ertegun, a Turkish-born jazz fan, came to District of Columbia at age twelve and later went on to found Atlantic Records. Todd Duncan was a District of Columbia-born singer who made history by being the first to play the lead of the opera &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;; he later became the first black man to play Tonio in &quot;Pagliacci&quot;. District of Columbia was also a home (and recording stop) for Jelly Roll Morton, Jimmie Rodgers and Bo Diddley. Local stars of the early part of the century include the singer Pearl Bailey.
In 1957, Elizabeth Cotten recorded for the family that employed her, which included a number of composers and musicologists. One song, &quot;Freight Train&quot;, became a folk music standard. Charlie Byrd, a District of Columbia-based jazz musician, recorded an innovative album in 1962 called &quot;Jazz Samba&quot; with Stan Getz, helping to launch the bossa nova craze. Skip Pitts played the famous riffs on Isaac Hayes&#x27;s OST &quot;Shaft&quot;, R&amp;B singer Ruth Brown, Billy Stewart, doo-wop groups The Orioles (based out of District of Columbia, though from Baltimore), The Clovers, The Rainbows, By the middle of the 1960s, District of Columbia had begun to produce some major stars, like soul singer Marvin Gaye, who had 3 No. 1 Hot 100 hits including &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; in 1968. Other soul musicians are Herb Fame (of Peaches &amp; Herb) who had the No. 1 Hot 100 hit &quot;Reunited&quot;, and Van McCoy (disco producer, No. 1 hit &quot;The Hustle&quot;). Other musicians included famous folk singer Scott McKenzie (known for big hit &quot;San Francisco&quot;), John Fahey, one of the first &quot;folk&quot; musicians to gain national appeal, Peter Tork (of The Monkees), Tim Buckley, guitarist Link Wray, country singer Patsy Cline, guitarists Gregory Gaskins played with Jersey Cities Manhattan&#x27;s and later Elvis Presley Danny Gatton, country star Roy Clark and Nils Lofgren (guitarist for Bruce Springsteen, Ringo Starr, and Neil Young). Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Casady, childhood friends from the District, moved to San Francisco, playing in Jefferson Airplane during their height of their success before forming Hot Tuna.

During this period, Washington began to develop its own music scene, with a number of styles evolving by the end of the century. Some popular singers from later decades include AC singer Roberta Flack (#1 hit &quot;Killing Me Softly with His Song&quot;), Root Boy Slim &amp; the Sex Change Band (&quot;You Broke My Mood Ring&quot;), singer-songwriter Tori Amos, Toni Braxton, Ginuwine, Mýa, Dave Grohl (of Nirvana and the Foo Fighters), Vertical Horizon (#1 Hot 100 hit &quot;Everything You Want&quot; in 2000; Matt Scannell attended Georgetown University), Starland Vocal Band (#1 Hot 100 hit &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot;), Joan Jett (rock singer with No. 1 hit &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;).

Washington is also home to the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, founded in 1974 and part of the DC public school system. Some other notable music education organizations which are located in Washington include the DC Youth Orchestra Program, founded in 1960; the Blues Alley Jazz Society, founded in 1985; Levine School of Music, founded in 1976, and the DC Legendary Musicians Inc, founded by Rev. Dr. Sandra Butler-Truesdale in 2006.

==Musical genres==

=== Choral ===

The Washington metropolitan area is considered by many to be the choral capital of the nation. Some choral groups active in the District today can trace their origins as far back as 1851, with a Choral Society being established to produce concerts and oratorios at least as early as the 1880s. In the modern era, the District features several independently-established symphonic choruses, along with a very wide variety of mid-size choirs, chamber ensembles, and specialty groups. The District has been described as &quot;the only locality in America where there is a chorus for every type of niche.&quot;

===Opera===
The first established opera company in the District of Columbia was the semi-professional Washington National Opera active from 1919 through 1936; it performed in venues ranging from local school auditoriums to DAR Constitution Hall. The present, entirely unrelated company of the same name, resident at the Kennedy Center, was known simply as the Washington Opera until 2000; a thoroughly professional organization under the direction of Plácido Domingo, it has, among other achievements, been a rare advocate for zarzuela in the United States. Among other, smaller-scale companies in the District of Columbia metropolitan area are the Washington Concert Opera, which specializes in unstaged presentations; Opera Lafayette, which specializes in French baroque opera; and Aurora Opera Theatre, formerly known as Opera Theatre of Northern Virginia.

===Blues===
Early in the 20th century, the District of Columbia was home to many bluesmen, such as Jelly Roll Morton and later rock and roll and rhythm and blues musicians such as Bo Diddley and Roy Buchanan. In the 1960s, a number of white youths formed local blues bands, including the Northside Blues Band and the Nighthawks. Starting in the early 1960s, Takoma Park native John Fahey became a nationally noted blues and folk guitarist who established the Takoma Records label, which attracted a number of other blues, folk, acoustic and fingerstyle guitarists to the District of Columbia area. Another local blues rock performer is Tom Principato.

===Bluegrass===
In the 1950s, Buzz Busby and the Bayou Boys became a noted bluegrass band that helped District of Columbia become known as the &quot;Bluegrass Capital of America&quot; in the 1950s and early 1960s. Later bluegrass bands from the District included the Country Gentlemen. Seldom Scene eventually became the District&#x27;s most prominent and longest-lasting bluegrass band. The Washington bluegrass community extends into outlying areas such as Western Maryland and the panhandle of West Virginia which are home to bluegrass musicians who commute to perform in the area. There has been substantial overlap between Washington, D.C.&#x27;s folk and bluegrass scene in the past several decades, in part due to the patronage of disc jockeys at public radio station WAMU, including Mary Cliff, longtime host of the music show &quot;Traditions&quot;.

===Folk===
Folk clubs began springing up in the District of Columbia in the late 1950s. One of the earliest folk venues was at the Hamilton Arms Coffee House, which was founded in 1939 in Georgetown at 1232 31st Street NW. By the mid-1950s, Hamilton Arms was hosting &quot;poetry readings, live music performances, art shows, movies, green tea (marijuana), and sometimes even coffee.&quot; After closing in 1957, other venues began to appear, including Coffee N&#x27; Confusion located briefly at 912 New Hampshire Avenue NW before moving to a basement location at 945 K Street NW. It has been noted that rock musician Jim Morrison, who lived in Northern Virginia up until 1961, performed his first poems at Coffee N&#x27; Confusion.

In January 1961, the Unicorn Cafe Expresso was opened at 1710 17th Street NW, featuring abstract art, coffee, poetry readings, and music. Founded by Yuri Kapralof and Roger Kaufman, the Unicorn became an important venue for up and coming folk musicians, especially after Kaufman and Kapralof sold the Unicorn to Elliott Ryan. With Hootenannys on Wednesday evening and more live performances, the Unicorn established its reputation as a music venue, where the likes of touring musicians Joan Baez, Erik Darling, and Pete LaFarge often performed along with local guitarists like John Fahey, Robbie Basho, Pat Sullivan and Max Ochs.

Another important folk venue in Georgetown in 1961 was The Shadows. A band called &quot;the Mugwumps&quot; formed, eventually splitting up. Two of the members, John Sebastian and Zal Yanovsky, became The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, and the other two, Denny Doherty and Cass Elliott, formed The Mamas &amp; the Papas. Later, in Georgetown, then-folk singer John Denver, Taffy Nivert and Bill Danoff wrote a song called &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot;, which launched Denver&#x27;s career as one of the most popular singers in the country. Other popular folk singers include Mary Chapin Carpenter; the duo Cathy Fink &amp; Marcy Marxer have been nominated for several Grammy Awards, for both folk and children&#x27;s music.

The Cellar Door at the foot of Key Bridge, was a stop for many touring folk and rock stars from the mid-1960s into the &#x27;70s.

===Jazz===

The District of Columbia has been home to many jazz pioneers, including the legendary Duke Ellington, as well as singer and pianist Shirley Horn, pianist Billy Taylor, and saxophonist Frank Wess. Ellington, Taylor, and Wess each attended Dunbar High School with its prominent music program. Ellington&#x27;s first group, The Washingtonians, featured drummer Sonny Greer. They left for Harlem in 1923. Jazz great Jelly Roll Morton came from New Orleans, but took up residency in Washington as a regular performer at a club called the Jungle Inn in 1935.

During the first half of the 20th century, in a segregated District, the U Street Corridor became the economic, cultural, entertainment and jazz hub of the District of Columbia, earning it the nickname &quot;Black Broadway&quot;. The National Trust for Historic Preservation defines walking tours that include the jazz venues where the greats such as Ella Fitzgerald performed, Duke Ellington&#x27;s childhood homes, and other music-related places in the neighborhood. Historic jazz club Bohemian Caverns launched many music careers, including that of R&amp;B singer Ruth Brown. Pianist Ramsey Lewis recorded his &quot;The in Crowd&quot; album there in 1965. The Blackbyrds, led by jazz trumpeter Donald Byrd and made up of jazz musicians from Howard University, recorded a song called &quot;Rock Creek Park&quot; for their album City Life in 1975 in honor of the well-known D.C landmark. During the second half of the 20th century until the mid-1990s, a period that saw decline on U Street, jazz became associated with longtime venues in the Georgetown area such as Blues Alley and One Step Down; closer to the heart of the District was dc space. Subsequently, jazz saw a resurgence on U Street, with venues such as Bohemian Caverns and Republic Gardens re-opening.

Local singer Eva Cassidy, a native of Bowie, Maryland, died of cancer at the age of 33 but received posthumous international fame when several of her songs received BBC Radio airplay, though she was already well known in the Washington area, after a farewell concert at The Bayou. A singer in multiple genres, Cassidy also notably performed a crossover album with District of Columbia go-go artist Chuck Brown (see below).

Multi-instrumentalist Andrew White has been performing and releasing records in DC since his debut record in 1961, The JFK Quintet, who released two monumental LPs on Riverside Records for Cannonball Adderley. Since then he has continued releasing albums, books, transcripts, and other publications for his self-produced label, Andrew&#x27;s Music.

Tenor saxophonist Ron Holloway is a Washington, D.C., native. Ron began playing saxophone at an early age one of his first music experience was with The El Corols, where he met another great DC saxophonist, Carter Jefferson. His journeyman years sitting in with local groups from every genre of contemporary music. In the mid-1970s, Holloway expanded his practice of sitting in and more and more he was heard sharing the stage with the likes of Freddie Hubbard, Sonny Rollins and Dizzy Gillespie. In February 1982 Holloway joined Gil Scott-Heron&#x27;s group. In June 1989, he left Scott-Heron to join Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s Quintet. Known for his versatility he has toured and recorded with a wide array of musical artists including Gillespie, Scott-Heron, Root Boy Slim, Little Feat, the Allman Brothers Band, Gov&#x27;t Mule, Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi. He has released five CDs under his own name.

===Progressive rock/psych===
In the late 1960 and early 70s, a variety of DC groups pushed the rock envelope, forming bands and securing record deals. The Fallen Angels were one of the first national psychedelic bands from DC, releasing two records on Roulette in the late 1960s. Lead singer, writer, and musician Jack Bryant headed up a band that played up and down the east coast, as well as an occasional west coast show. Progressive metal band Animals as Leaders is from Washington, DC.

===Soul and funk===

The District of Columbia&#x27;s Soul/Funk movement took shape during the mid-60s; about the same time Doo-Wop change to soul chorus group (The Temptations～), and &quot;James Brown&quot; became a big name. Parliament&#x27;s 1975 song &quot;Chocolate City,&quot; with vocals spoken by George Clinton, references and celebrates the District of Columbia as a majority black District. Artists such as Marvin Gaye, Black Heat, Experience Unlimited (E.U.), The Moments, The Unifics, Peaches &amp; Herb, Terry Huff &amp; Special Delivery, Act 1, The Dynamic Superiours, Sir Joe Quarterman &amp; Free Soul, Chuck Brown &amp; the Soul Searchers, Van McCoy, The Presidents, Anacostia, Vernon Burch, Ray, Goodman &amp; Brown, True Reflection, The Unifics, Peaches &amp; Herb, Act 1, The Dynamic Superiors, Skip Mahoaney &amp; the Casuals, Dyson&#x27;s Face, Bobby Thurston, Charles Pitts (OST &quot;Shaft&quot;, 1971), The Choice Four, The Fuzz, Dane Riley, and Billy Stewart were from Washington, D.C. 1980s funk bands such as Osiris, Wax, Waldo, Tyrone Brunson influenced go-go bands. Minor group Aggression released 2 singles (roots of go-go) from SRI Records. Producer Maxx Kidd founded T.T.E.D. Records.

===R&amp;B===
The soul and funk scene set the stage for District of Columbia&#x27;s considerable influence in modern R&amp;B. Besides Toni Braxton, District of Columbia is the hometown of mid-1990s crooners Ginuwine, Mýa, and Tank (raised in Clinton, MD), as well as the more current J. Holiday, Raheem DeVaughn and Reesa Renee (who are both from the neighboring Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland). Central Heat, an East Coast touring R&amp;B band based out of Northern Virginia originated in the late 1970s and features founding members Doug and Dennis Flynn, Mike Cavaliere and Bob Costlow. Central Heat remains active in the DC club scene today. Johnny Gill, II D Extreme, and Stacy Lattisaw are also from the District of Columbia. Also, independent recording artist Dane Riley, who is the cousin of the late legendary Washington, DC singer Billy Stewart.

===Go-go===
Go-go music originated in Washington, D.C. during the mid-1970s and began to take its current shape by the late &#x27;70s. Its characteristic formula combined simple funk grooves with instrumental percussion and often rapping. It is a blend of funk, R&amp;B, and latin music, with a focus on lo-fi percussion instruments and melodic jamming in place of dance tracks, although some sampling is used. As such, it is primarily a dance music with an emphasis on live audience call and response. Go-go rhythms are also incorporated into street percussion. Many &quot;District of Columbia&quot; soul &amp; funk artists contributed to the characteristic go-go sound, but the main pioneers were Chuck Brown &amp; the Soul Searchers, known for &quot;Bustin&#x27; Loose&quot;, which became a surprise national hit. Later go-go bands include Trouble Funk, Experience Unlimited (E.U., whose hit &quot;(Doin&#x27;) Da Butt&quot; was featured in Spike Lee&#x27;s 1988 &quot;School Daze&quot;), Rare Essence, Hot Cold Sweat, AM/FM, The Junkyard Band, Slug-Go and the Southeast go-go band Aggressive Funk. Bands such as Backyard, TCB, and UCB have gained recognition by being featured in music by the rapper Wale.

===Hardcore===
The District of Columbia is primarily known in the rock community for its seminal influence on the evolution of hardcore punk, known locally as harDCore, particularly through bands such as Bad Brains, Minor Threat, and The Faith, and labels like Dischord Records, but it had a vibrant musical community prior to hardcore&#x27;s arrival with bands like the Razz, Slickee Boys, Insect Surfers, Tru Fax and the Insaniacs, and The Penetrators, putting out records on local independent labels like Limp, Wasp, and Dacoit. Ian MacKaye, the frontman for Minor Threat, became an inspiration in part for the international Straight Edge movement after the song &quot;Straight Edge&quot; was released. MacKaye went on to co-found Fugazi, which attained international recognition under the Dischord record label, alongside Rites of Spring guitarist Guy Picciotto. Henry Rollins, a native of the District of Columbia hardcore scene, moved to Los Angeles in 1981 to join Black Flag.

===Emo===

In the mid-1980s, veterans of the D.C. hardcore scene created a new punk subgenre called &quot;emo&quot;, meaning &quot;emotive hardcore.&quot; This term has since evolved to become associated with a much broader group of musical styles. The most renowned District of Columbia area bands associated with the &quot;first wave&quot; of emo were Rites of Spring and Embrace.

===Punk===

In the 1980s, the District of Columbia, was rich with punk and new wave music. Bands like The Slickee Boys, Urban Verbs, Tiny Desk Unit, Mother May I, Insect Surfers, Tru Fax &amp; the Insaniacs, and Black Market Baby were popular at places like the 9:30 Club, The Psychedeli, dc space, Madam&#x27;s Organ, The Bayou (in Georgetown). See also: Bad Brains, Minor Threat, Henry Rollins. In the 1970s and 1980s, Georgetown had a diverse live music scene, and became known as a center for the early punk community. In the 1990s, U Street NW in the Shaw neighborhood became known as a new haven for post-hardcore punk, alternative rock, acid jazz and electronica, following the establishment of a variety of bars and clubs in the area, most notably The Black Cat (which was co-founded by Dave Grohl, another native of the DC punk scene). The 9:30 club subsequently moved to the area as well.

===Post-hardcore===

In the 1990s, bands taking heavy influence from the Washington, D.C., hardcore scene and the local go-go phenomenon contributed to the post-hardcore scene. Important players in this scene were The Dismemberment Plan, Fugazi, Nation of Ulysses, Trans Am, and Q and Not U. Currently, important post-punk/indie/dance-rock bands like Supersystem (formerly El Guapo), Medications, Metrorail, Maritime, Edie Sedgwick, Mass Movement of the Moth, The Fordists, and Beauty Pill hail from DC. Ian MacKaye continues his involvement in the DC music scene with his two-piece rock group The Evens. Record labels like Dischord, DeSoto Records, Exotic Fever, and Amor Y Lucha have been and remain to be a crucial means of distribution for DC bands.

===Hip hop===
The DC hip-hop scene has always taken a back seat to the other more prevalent genres in the area. Even so, influential groups have planted seeds in the District for future generations to follow. Groups like The Amphibians &amp; Freestyle Union laid the foundation for artists like Asheru, Wale and Low Budget to help put DC&#x27;s hip-hop scene on the map. Wale was the first District of Columbia artist to really break out on the national scene. He was a member of &quot;XXL&quot;&#x27;s 2009 Freshman Class and released his debut album, Attention Deficit on Interscope Records. Representing the street-oriented side of hip-hop, District of Columbia-bred rapper Garvey &quot;The Chosen One&quot; released his debut album Hard Hat Area Volume#1, on independent record label Triple Team Entertainment and distributed by DTLR. When it came time to the video&#x27;s shoot location for his single &quot;Lock It Down,&quot; released 2010, he chose local high school Calvin Coolidge High School, alma mater of the video&#x27;s director, Robert &quot;Bob Smoke&quot; Headen, did more than just provide the setting—members of the school&#x27;s band, cheerleading team, step team and dance squad are all featured in the released video as noted by the Washington Post. DMV emcee Marky has been gaining national recognition for his song &quot;Rasta Monsta,&quot; sampling Aloe Blacc&#x27;s &quot;I Need A Dollar.&quot;. Underground group Diamond District represent the vanguard as well as an underground rapper from (Fairmont Heights/P.G.County) born name Micah Paschal rap name MIKE.P also represent DC hip-hop today. 

The District of Columbia&#x27;s hip-hop scene was notably featured in the 1998 film &quot;Slam&quot;, about a would-be slam poet&#x27;s ordeal in the District of Columbia Jail. Pharaoh Jonez, an Emcee from Southeast DC is one of the most successful rapper/producers from the DMV&#x27;s underground scene. In 2010 he managed to get his music into the hands of an A&amp;R over at Slip-n-Slide Records which did nothing for his career until 2012 when he landed a spread in Kapital Magazine alongside Kendrick Lamar, Drumma Boy, and fellow DC rapper Wale, who of which Jonez has never met before. In 2013 Pharaoh Jonez signed a management contract with Lawrence Mooney, CEO of Chocolate Mint and longtime friend of &quot;Freeway&quot; Rick Ross.

Local and influential House music DJ Sam “The Man” Burns held a regular House club night on Sundays at Eighteenth Street Lounge up until his passing in 2020.

Another electronic-dance music subgenre that was born in the District of Columbia is Moombahton. The style of music was created by local D.J. Dave Nada (member of the duo Nadastrom alongside producer Matt Nordstrom) who accidentally created a new and unique EDM sound at a party in Fall 2009, by slowing down the tempo of an Electro House song and placing a reggaeton beat on top of the house track. His invention sparked an underground EDM movement not only in the District of Columbia but also worldwide, all through the early 2010s. In addition to Nadastrom, well known Moombahton producers include Munchi, Dillon Francis, and Bro Safari.

The District of Columbia is also the home to the group Thievery Corporation, who are well known in the electronic music community for their fusion of downtempo and trip hop with lounge music and Brazilian music such as bossa nova. They founded the label Eighteenth Street Lounge Music, which is also based in Washington, D.C.

===A cappella===
The District of Columbia has a very vibrant &quot;a cappella&quot; scene. Sweet Honey in the Rock, which formed in 1973 and focuses on music rooted in African American culture, has shared a Grammy Award and received multiple Grammy nominations for its children&#x27;s albums. Afro Blue, an &quot;a cappella&quot; vocal jazz ensemble based at Howard University, received significant national attention when it placed fourth on season three of the television show The Sing Off in 2011. There are several ″vocal bands″ in the area, while ensembles like The Capital Hearings bridge the lines between the choral tradition, vocal jazz, and contemporary &quot;a cappella&quot;.

===Mod and soul===
The Ambitions, led by former Checkered Cabs singer Caz Gardiner, are at the forefront of the mod/soul type bands drawing their inspiration from late 60s soul bands to 1970s British mod revivalists.

===Garage revival===
As of late, DC has been home to a growing scene of musicians who take inspiration from the primal stomp of the 1960s garage rock movement. Eschewing the more esoteric stylings of their art-school peers, bands like Soul Lip, the Hall Monitors, the breakUps, the Have Mercys, the Points, Shark Week, The Fed, and Fellowcraft mine a more primitive vein of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, finding inspiration in fuzzed-out chords and grooves.

==The Wammies==

<text>Cairns (; ) is a city in the Cairns Region, Queensland, Australia, on the tropical north east coast of Far North Queensland. In the , Cairns had a population of 153,181 people.

The city was founded in 1876 and named after Sir William Wellington Cairns, following the discovery of gold in the Hodgkinson River. During World War II, the city became a staging ground for the Allied Forces in the Battle of the Coral Sea. By the late 20th century the city had become a centre of international tourism. In the early 21st century, it has developed into a major regional city. 

The economy of Cairns is based primarily on tourism, healthcare and education, along with a major capacity in aviation, marine and defence industries.
The city has a gross regional product at about $11.4 billion as of 2023. The city is served by Cairns International Airport, the seventh busiest airport in Australia. Cairns also has a major cruise ship industry servicing both domestic and international markets, with terminals at Cairns Seaport and Cairns Wharf Complex.

Cairns is a major tourist destination, with access to two UNESCO world heritage sites; the Daintree Rainforest as part of the Wet Tropics of Queensland, and the Great Barrier Reef, one of the seven natural wonders of the world.

==History==
Prior to British settlement, the Cairns area was inhabited by the Gimuy Walubara Yidinji people, who still claim their native title rights. Yidinji (also known as Yidinj, Yidiny, and Idindji) is an Australian Aboriginal language. Its traditional language region is within the local government areas of Cairns Region and Tablelands Region, in such localities as Cairns, Gordonvale, and the Mulgrave River, and the southern part of the Atherton Tableland including Atherton and Kairi. The area in which the city is located is known in the local Yidiny language as Gimuy, and the clan who inhabited the region before colonisation are the Gimuy-walubarra clan.
From 1770 to the early 1870s the area was known to the British simply as Trinity Bay. The arrival of beche de mer fishermen from the late 1860s saw the first European presence in the area. On the site of the modern-day Cairns foreshore, there was a large native well which was used by these fishermen. A violent confrontation occurred in 1872 between local Yidinji people and Phillip Garland, a beche de mer fisherman, over the use of this well. The area from this date was subsequently called Battle Camp.

In 1876, hastened by the need to export gold mined from the Hodgkinson goldfields on the tablelands to the west, closer investigation by several official expeditions established its potential for development into a port. Brinsley G. Sheridan surveyed the area and selected a place further up Trinity Inlet known to the diggers as Smith&#x27;s Landing for a settlement which he renamed Thornton. However, after Native Police officers Alexander Douglas-Douglas and Robert Arthur Johnstone opened a new track from the goldfields to Battle Camp, this more coastal site became preferable. The area was named Cairns in late 1876 in honour of the then Governor of Queensland, William Cairns. The site was predominantly mangrove swamps and sand ridges. Labourers gradually cleared the swamps, and the sand ridges were filled with dried mud, sawdust from local sawmills, and ballast from a quarry at Edge Hill.

Throughout the late 19th century, Cairns prospered from the settlement of Chinese immigrants who helped develop the region&#x27;s agriculture. Soon after Cairns was established &quot;a few entrepreneurial Chinese men began to experiment with crops such as cotton, tobacco, coffee, rice, sugar, and bananas, while market gardeners grew much needed fruit and vegetables. This marked the beginning of the agricultural industry, which became the dominant industry.&quot; &quot;The growing agricultural industry in the Cairns region provided the impetus for Cairns Chinatown to develop as Chinese men turned to support industries such as market gardening and shop keeping. They were not only ex-miners, but a growing number of immigrants arriving directly from China to take advantage of the agricultural boom. In 1886 the Chinese population accounted for 60% of all farmers and 90% of gardeners, that is 795 cultivators and gardeners.&quot;

As agricultural changes and the White Australia policy impacted the Chinese population of Cairns, including its once thriving Chinatown declined. A Police census stated the Chinese population of Cairns was 450 in 1909, a decrease of around 1,000 since 1901. &quot;Grafton Street, Cairns was the historical site for Cairns Chinatown - the largest and longest running Chinese community outside Brisbane from the 1880s until the mid 1940s. Supporting a diverse population of Chinese settlers, entrepreneurs, women and families, ...&quot; &quot;From the early 1880s when the Lily Creek Chinese camp moved into Sachs Street, Chinatown was a busy and thriving community. According to Cathie May, the social structure of the community was divided according to place of origin with storekeepers on the eastern side of Sachs Street predominantly Sze Yap, and Chung Shan storekeepers and merchants on the western side. Nearly all Chinese immigrants to Cairns were from Guangdong Province in the Southern Delta area of China. Most came from Loong Dou, a small distinct district in Chung Shan, with a smaller group from Sze Yap or the &quot;Four Districts&quot; in Toishan. Some also came from Sam Yap or &quot;Three Districts.&quot; &quot; As the 20th century progressed the Cairns Chinatown declined. &quot;Australian Born Chinese showed little interest in maintaining the Chinese enclave. Many were westernised having at least one European parent or grandparent, or had themselves grown up assimilated into the broader Cairns community through their experiences at school. Neither cultural tastes, nor race relations, provided an incentive for Australian born Chinese to remain living in Chinatown. The barriers causing racial residential segregation were removed and many families lived outside Chinatown.&quot;

The Cairns Parish of the Roman Catholic Vicariate Apostolic of Cooktown (now the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cairns) was established in 1884.

Debris from the construction of a railway to Herberton on the Atherton Tableland, a project which started in 1886, was also used. The railway opened up land later used for agriculture on the lowlands (sugar cane, corn, rice, bananas, pineapples), and for fruit and dairy production on the Tableland. The success of local agriculture helped establish Cairns as a port, and the creation of a harbour board in 1906 supported its robust economic future.

The Wharf Estate Cairns went on sale in Brisbane via auction on 19 February 1889 by John Macnamara &amp; Co. Land Auctioneers. The land was part of the place known as the Railway Reserve. The sale was described by the Auctioneers as the &#x27;largest ever yet held in Northern Queensland&#x27;.

On 25 April 1926 (ANZAC Day), the Cairns Sailors and Soldiers War Memorial was unveiled by Alexander Frederick Draper, the mayor of the City of Cairns.

During World War II, the Allied Forces used Cairns as a staging base for operations in the Pacific, with United States Army Air Forces and Royal Australian Air Force operational bases (now the airport), as well as a major military seaplane base, Naval Base Cairns, in Trinity Inlet, and United States Navy and Royal Australian Navy bases near the current wharf. Combat missions were flown out of Cairns in support of the Battle of the Coral Sea in 1942. Edmonton and White Rock south of Cairns were major military supply areas and U.S. Paratroopers trained at Gordonvale and the Goldsborough Valley. A Special Forces training base was established at the old &quot;Fairview&quot; homestead on Munro&#x27;s Hill, Mooroobool. This base was officially known as the Z Experimental Station, but referred to informally as &quot;The House on the Hill&quot;.

After World War II, Cairns gradually developed into a centre for tourism. The opening of the Cairns International Airport in 1984 helped establish the city as a desirable destination for international tourism particularly from the emerging Japanese market.

==Geography==

Cairns is located on the east coast of Cape York Peninsula on a coastal strip between the Coral Sea and the Great Dividing Range. The northern part of the city is located on Trinity Bay and the city centre is located on Trinity Inlet. To the south of the Trinity Inlet lies the Aboriginal community of Yarrabah. Some of the city&#x27;s suburbs are located on flood plains. The Mulgrave River and Barron River flow within the greater Cairns area but not through the Cairns CBD. The city&#x27;s centre foreshore is located on a mud flat.

===Urban layout===
Cairns is a provincial city, with a linear urban layout that runs from the south at Edmonton to the north at Ellis Beach. The city is approximately from north to south; it has experienced a recent urban sprawl, with suburbs occupying land once used for sugar cane farming.

The &quot;Northern Beaches&quot; consist of a number of beach communities extending north along the coast. In general, each beach suburb is at the end of a spur road extending from the Captain Cook Highway. From south to north, these are Machans Beach, Holloways Beach, Yorkeys Knob, Trinity Park, Trinity Beach, Kewarra Beach, Clifton Beach, Palm Cove, and Ellis Beach.

The suburb of Smithfield is inland against the mountains of the Great Dividing Range, between Yorkeys Knob and Trinity Park. It serves as the main hub for the Northern Beaches, with a modern shopping arcade, called Smithfield Shopping Centre.

South of Smithfield and inland from the Northern Beaches along the edge of the Barron River flood plain are the suburbs of Caravonica, Kamerunga, Freshwater, and Stratford. This area is sometimes referred to as Freshwater Valley, though it is actually the lower part of Redlynch Valley; further up the valley are the suburbs of Redlynch, on the western side of Redlynch Valley, and Brinsmead on the eastern side. Stratford, Freshwater, and Brinsmead are separated from Cairns city by Mount Whitfield (elevation ) and Whitfield Range. Crystal Cascades and Copperlode Falls Dam are also behind this range. (Kuranda, a town on the Barron River on the western side of the Macalister Range, forms part of the Cairns economic catchment but is in the Tablelands local government area and is not part of the Cairns urban area.)

The city centre of Cairns is adjacent to the suburbs of Cairns North, and Parramatta Park, Bungalow, Portsmith, and close to Westcourt, Manunda, Manoora, Edge Hill, Whitfield, Kanimbla, City View, Mooroobool, Earlville, Woree and Bayview Heights. The small suburb of Aeroglen is pressed between Mount Whitfield and the airport, on the Captain Cook Highway between Cairns North and Stratford.

&quot;Southside Cairns&quot;, situated in a narrow area between Trinity Inlet to the east and Lamb Range to the west, includes the suburbs of White Rock, Mount Sheridan, Bentley Park and Edmonton. The townships of Goldsborough, Little Mulgrave, and Aloomba are near Gordonvale, on the Mulgrave River. This area is serviced by the Bruce Highway. Several other small towns and communities within Cairns&#x27;s jurisdiction are sparsely located along the Bruce Highway, the furthest being Bramston Beach, south of the Cairns CBD; the largest of these townships is Babinda, about from the city.

===Climate===

Cairns experiences a tropical climate, specifically a tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification. A wet season with heavy monsoonal downpours runs from November to May, with a relatively dry season from June to October, though light showers occur during this period. Cairns&#x27;s mean annual rainfall is just under , although monthly totals in the wet season from December to April can exceed , with the highest monthly rainfall being recorded in January 1981, when over of rain fell. In contrast, as little as fell in the record dry calendar year of 2002.

Cairns has hot, humid summers and very warm winters. Mean maximum temperatures vary from in July to in January. Monsoonal activity during the wet season occasionally causes major flooding of the Barron and Mulgrave Rivers, cutting off-road and rail access to the city. Cairns has 97.0 clear days, annually. Dewpoint in the wet season (summer) averages at . The average temperature of the sea ranges from in July to in January.
====Tropical cyclones====
Like most of North and Far North Queensland, Cairns is prone to tropical cyclones, usually forming between November and May.

Cyclones that have affected the Cairns region include:

* Cyclone Jasper, 2023
* Cyclone Yasi, 2011
* Cyclone Larry, 2006
* Cyclone Abigail, 2001
* Cyclone Steve, 2000
* Cyclone Rona, 1999
* Cyclone Justin, 1997

Cyclone Jasper in December 2023 caused record flooding. The Barron River exceeded the March 1977 record of , making it the worst flooding event in Cairns since records began in 1915.

==Facilities==
The City Library, operated by the Cairns Regional Council, opened in 1979 and is situated at 151 Abbott Street. A major refurbishment was undertaken in 1999 and a further minor refurbishment was implemented in 2011. Public accessible wifi is available.

==Governance==
Cairns is part of the Cairns Region local government area which is governed by a Regional Council. The Council consists of a directly elected mayor and 9 councillors, elected from 9 single-member divisions (or wards) using an optional preferential voting system. Elections are held every four years.

The Cairns Region consists of three former local government areas. The first was the original City of Cairns, consisting of the Cairns City region as listed above. The second, which was amalgamated in 1995, was the Shire of Mulgrave (comprising the other areas, namely the Northern Beaches, Redlynch Valley and Southside). The town of Gordonvale was once called Nelson. The third area is the Shire of Douglas, which amalgamated in 2008 during major statewide local government reforms and then de-amalgamated in 2014.

At the time of the 1995 amalgamation, Cairns City had a population of approximately 40,000 and Mulgrave Shire had a population of approximately 60,000. Both local government authorities had chambers in the Cairns CBD. The old Cairns City Council chambers has been converted into a new city library. In a controversial decision, new Council chambers were constructed on previously contaminated land in the mainly industrial suburb of Portsmith at 119-145 Spence Street.

Cairns has three representatives in the Queensland Parliament, from the electoral districts of Barron River, Cairns and Mulgrave. The city is represented in the Federal Parliament by representatives elected from the districts of Leichhardt and Kennedy.





==Economy==

Cairns serves as the major commercial centre for the Far North Queensland and Cape York Peninsula Regions. It is a base for the regional offices of various government departments.

===Tourism===
Tourism plays a major part in the Cairns economy. According to Tourism Australia, the Cairns region is the fourth-most-popular destination for international tourists in Australia after Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. While the city does not rank amongst Australia&#x27;s top 10 destinations for domestic tourism, it attracts a significant number of Australian holiday makers despite its distance from major capitals. There is also a growing interest in Cairns from the Chinese leisure market with regular scheduled direct flights from Chinese cities such as Shanghai and Guangzhou. During the 2013 Chinese Lunar New Year period alone, Cairns saw 20,000 Chinese holidaymakers flying in on chartered flights.

The city is near the Great Barrier Reef, the Wet Tropics of Queensland, and the Atherton Tableland. Great Barrier Reef tours that operate from Cairns are very popular and hence Cairns is also considered as the gateway to Great Barrier Reef.

The Cairns esplanade includes a swimming lagoon with adjoining barbecue areas. Cairns Esplanade Lagoon opened in March 2003. Though initially controversial, the 4800-square-metre pool has proved a very popular local attraction since its opening. In May 2003, the then Cairns Mayor Kevin Byrne declared that topless sunbathing is permitted here. 

===Commercial===
Several shopping centres of various sizes are located throughout Cairns. The largest of these are Cairns Central shopping centre, located in the central business district (CBD), and Stockland Cairns, located in the suburb of Earlville. In Westcourt, one of the city&#x27;s oldest shopping centres has been refurbished, with the city&#x27;s first DFO. To service the needs of suburbs further from the city centre, shopping complexes are also located at Mount Sheridan, Redlynch, Smithfield, and Clifton Beach.

In 2010, the Queensland Governmen opened the second stage of William McCormack Place, an A$80 million office building credited as the first 6-star green star-rated building in the city.

===Media===

&quot;The Cairns Post&quot;, published by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corp. is the main daily newspaper published in the city. Widely available are also &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot;, a daily newspaper published in Brisbane, and the national broadsheet &quot;The Australian&quot;, which both are also published by News Corp.

Cairns is served by five television stations, three commercial television stations (WIN Television, Seven Queensland and Network 10) which are regional affiliates of the three Australian commercial television networks (10, Seven and Nine), and public broadcasters the ABC and SBS services.

Of the three major commercial networks:
*Seven News produces a half-hour local news bulletin for Cairns and  Far North Queensland, airing each weeknight at 6pm. It is produced from a newsroom in the city and broadcast from studios in Maroochydore.
*WIN News airs a half-hour statewide news bulletin for Regional Queensland, airing each weeknight at 5:30pm. Select local stories from Cairns is inserted into this bulletin, although local weather remains intact at the end of the bulletin as an opt-out window. It is produced from a newsroom in the city and broadcast from studios in Wollongong. A dedicated local WIN News bulletin for Cairns was broadcast until 30th June 2021.
*Network 10 airs short regional &quot;10 News First&quot; updates throughout the day, broadcast from studios in Hobart.

Cairns radio stations include a number of public, commercial and community broadcasters. The ABC broadcasts ABC Far North, ABC Radio National, ABC NewsRadio, ABC Classic FM and the Triple J youth network. Commercial radio stations include Star 102.7, 4CA 846 AM, Hot FM (now Hit Network), Sea FM (now Triple M) and 104.3 4TAB sports radio, while the community radio stations are 4CCR-FM (Cairns FM 89.1), 101.9 Coast FM, Vision Christian Radio, Orbit FM 88.0FM &amp; 87.8FM and 4CIM 98.7FM (Bumma Bippera Media).

=== Industry and agriculture ===
The land around Cairns is still used for sugar cane farming, although this land is increasingly under pressure from new suburbs as the city grows. The Mulgrave Sugar Mill is located in Gordonvale ().

The Barron Gorge Hydroelectric Power Station is located nearby on the lower Barron River, and provides green power.

==Transport==
Cairns is an important transport hub in the Far North Queensland region. Located at the base of Cape York Peninsula, it provides important transport links between the Peninsula and Gulf of Carpentaria regions, and the areas to the south of the state. Cairns International Airport is essential to the viability of the area&#x27;s tourism industry.

===Roads===
The Bruce Highway runs for from Bald Hills on the City of Brisbane&#x27;s northern boundary, and terminates in Woree, a southern suburb in Cairns. The Captain Cook Highway (also referred as the Cook Highway) commences at Aeroglen, a northern suburb of Cairns, and runs for approximately northwest to Mossman.

A need for future upgrades to the Bruce Highway to motorway standards through the southern suburbs to Gordonvale has been identified in regional planning strategies to cope with increasing congestion from rapid population growth. This will result in overpasses at all major intersections from Woree to Gordonvale. The motorway will divert from Bentley Park to Gordonvale, bypassing Edmonton to reduce the effects of road noise on residential areas.

The Kennedy Highway commences at Smithfield on the Barron River flood plain north of Cairns, and ascends the Macalister Range to the township of Kuranda. The highway then extends to the town of Mareeba on the Atherton Tableland, and continues to communities of Cape York Peninsula.

The Gillies Highway commences at the township of Gordonvale, and ascends the Gillies Range (part of the Great Dividing Range) to the town of Atherton on the Atherton Tableland, passing through the township of Yungaburra on the way.

The controversial private road, Quaid Road, was constructed in 1989 through what is now a Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, and links Wangetti, on the coast just north of Cairns, to Southedge, just south of Mount Molloy. The road is not open to the public and is not used for general traffic.

===Bus===
A public bus transit network exists within the city, with two transit hubs located within the CBD: the Cairns Central Railway Station precinct, and the Cairns City Bus Station located within the Lake street and Shield street area, through which all bus lines operate and provide linkage to taxi, ride share and intercity rail services. The transit network includes most parts of the city, from Palm Cove in the north, Gordonvale in the south and Redlynch to the west. It is managed throughout the city by Translink: through a service contract with the Kinetic Group company, however the Go Card ticketing system has not been implemented in the region. A smaller shuttle bus service, &quot;Jon&#x27;s Kuranda Bus&quot; runs between Cairns and Kuranda alongside other private coach services. The main bus hubs in the Cairns CBD are the Cairns City bus station, opened in 2014, and at Cairns Central, the former servicing almost all bus lines in Cairns.

Cairns is served by long-distance coaches to Brisbane, and regional cities to the south. Coaches also operate west to Mount Isa via Townsville, and to Alice Springs and Darwin in the Northern Territory.

===Rail===
Cairns railway station is the terminus for Queensland&#x27;s North Coast railway line, which follows the eastern seaboard from Brisbane. Services are operated by Queensland Rail (QR) and include the high-speed Diesel Tilt Train. Freight trains also operate along the route, with a QR Freight handling facility located at Portsmith.

Pacific National Queensland (a division of Pacific National, owned by Asciano Limited) operates a rail siding at Woree. It runs private trains on the rail network owned by the Queensland State Government and managed by QR&#x27;s Network Division.

The Kuranda Scenic Railway operates from Cairns. The tourist railway ascends the Macalister Range and is not used for commuter services. It passes through the suburbs of Stratford, Freshwater (stopping at Freshwater Station) and Redlynch before reaching Kuranda.

Freight services to Forsayth were discontinued in the mid-1990s. These were mixed freight and passenger services that served the semi-remote towns west of the Great Dividing Range. There is now a weekly passenger-only service, &quot;The Savannahlander&quot;, that leaves Cairns on Wednesday mornings. The Savannahlander is run by a private company, Cairns Kuranda Steam Trains.

Cairns is served by a narrow-gauge cane railway (or cane train) network that hauls harvested sugar cane to the Mulgrave Sugar Mill located in Gordonvale. The pressure of urban sprawl on land previously cultivated by cane farmers has seen this network reduced over recent years.

===Airport===
Cairns International Airport is north of Cairns City between the CBD and the Northern Beaches. The domestic terminal at Cairns Airport underwent an extensive redevelopment which began in 2007 and was completed in 2010. In 2023, a new renovation began on the international terminal, which was expected to cost between A$40 and 50 million.

The airport has a domestic terminal, an international terminal, and a general aviation area. The airport handles international flights, and flights to major Australian cities, tourist destinations, and regional destinations throughout North Queensland. It is an important base for general aviation serving the Cape York Peninsula and Gulf of Carpentaria communities. The Cairns airport is also a base for the Royal Flying Doctor Service.

===Port===

The Cairns Seaport, located on Trinity Inlet, is operated by the Cairns Port Authority.
It serves as an important port for tourist operators providing daily reef trips. These consist of large catamarans capable of carrying over 300 passengers, as well as smaller operators that may take as few as 12 tourists. Cairns Port is also a port of call for cruise ships, such as Captain Cook Cruises, cruising the South Pacific Ocean. It also provides freight services to coastal townships on Cape York Peninsula, the Torres Strait and the Gulf of Carpentaria.

Yearly cargo through the port totals 1.13 million tonnes. Almost 90% of the trade is bulk cargoes – including petroleum, sugar, molasses, fertiliser and LP gas. A large number of fishing trawlers are also located at the port. There is also a marina that houses private yachts and boats used for tourist operations.

The Trinity Wharf has recently been the subject of a major redevelopment to improve the area for tourist and cruise ship operations. The freight wharves are located to the south of Trinity Wharf further up Trinity Inlet.

== Defence facilities ==
The Royal Australian Navy has a base in Cairns (). The base has a complement of 1000 personnel, and supports nine vessels, including:
*Three s of &quot;Ardent&quot; Division
*Two s

Four ships of the Royal Australian Navy Hydrographic Service:
*Two hydrographic ships
*Two survey ships

Previously four of the six landing craft were based in Cairns before their decommissioning.

Porton Barracks, in the outlying suburb of Edmonton, is home to the Australian Army&#x27;s 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment. Delta Company from the Townsville-based 31st/42nd Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment is also based here. Both units are components of the Australian Army Reserve.

Irukandji language (also known as Yirrgay, Yurrgay, Yirrgandji, Djabuganjdji and Yirgay) is a language of Far North Queensland, particularly the area around the Kuranda Range and Lower Barron River. The Irukandji language region includes the landscape within Cairns Regional Council.

Yumplatok (also known as Torres Strait Creole and Broken) is a contemporary Torres Strait Island language originating in the Torres Strait. The contact with missionaries and others since the 1800s has led to the development of a pidgin language, which transitioned into a creole language and now has its own distinctive sound system, grammar, vocabulary, usage and meaning. Torres Strait Creole is spoken by most Torres Strait Islanders and is a mixture of Standard Australian English and traditional languages. It is an English-based creole; however, each island has its own version of creole. Torres Strait Creole is also spoken on the Australian mainland, including Northern Peninsula Area Region and coastal communities such as Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton and Brisbane.

<text>Nokturnal Mortum are a Ukrainian black metal band from Kharkiv. They were one of the founders of the Ukrainian black metal scene and pioneers in the early National Socialist black metal (&quot;NSBM&quot;) scene.

== History ==
Nokturnal Mortum was originally formed as a death metal band called Suppuration in 1991, then turned to black metal and changed name to Darkness but &quot;had to change the name back in 1993/94 to Nocturnal Mortum because there already existed a band with that name in Western underground&quot;. They have stated this about the current name and spelling: &quot;We changed a letter so that we wouldn&#x27;t find a band with the same name again like it was the case with Darkness&quot;. Nokturnal Mortum gained recognition in the underground black metal genre with the release of their debut album &quot;Goat Horns&quot;, which had two keyboardists play on the album (often on the same song) and for mixing traditional Ukrainian folk influences with black metal.

== Accusations of Nazism ==
Initially, the band described their music as &quot;lunar black metal&quot;. On their 1996 demo &quot;Lunar Poetry&quot; the band advocated for the killing of Christians, the destruction of churches, and Slavic paganism, along with describing Jesus as a &quot;crucified hippie&quot;. Later, when releasing their EP &quot;Marble Moon&quot; and also the &quot;Nechrist&quot; and &quot;Lunar Poetry&quot; albums, they included anti-Semitic lyrics with neo-Nazi and white supremacy messages and imagery.

As the more popular non-political black metal scene (including many shops and concert events) began distancing themselves from their ideology, the band instead became prominent in the early Eastern European National Socialist black metal scene, and is today often considered as one of the groups that shaped the Slavic subcultural NSBM movement. They also began using swastikas in their logo, on albums, during shows, and praising the Third Reich and the Holocaust openly in various side-projects. Knjaz Varggoth, in one of several side projects, also voiced support for the so-called &quot;racial holy war&quot; idea. Nokturnal Mortum&#x27;s album &quot;Нехристь&quot; (&quot;Nechrist&quot;) features a song called &quot;The Call of Aryan Spirit&quot;, which includes anti-Semitic lyrics and the glorification of pogroms. The album&#x27;s original release included a swastika design consisting of four AK-47s.

In interviews, appearances, merchandise and on their website, the band showcased neo-Nazi opinions but their music style itself was described as &quot;pagan black metal&quot;. Statements and texts show neo-völkisch as well as neo-paganist ideas, and a tendency to ariosophy.

In 2008, the band&#x27;s vocalist and guitarist, Knjaz Varggoth, claimed that he had no interest in political tendencies and that he had, &quot;never viewed Nokturnal Mortum as a political band&quot;. In 2014 the group maintained that NM had severed ties with NSBM ideologies and political themes, however these statements appear to contradict some conduct in the following years, as the band has remained active in white supremacist circles and it has played live at neo-Nazi and far right shows, including Ukraine&#x27;s own Asgardsrei festival in 2016 and 2018. They have also since collaborated with the NSBM label &quot;Militant Zone&quot;.

<text>Yungaburra is a rural town and locality in the Tablelands Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , the locality of Yungaburra had a population of 1,272 people.

== Geography ==
Yungaburra is on the Atherton Tableland in Far North Queensland.

The landscape around Yungaburra has been shaped by millennia of volcanic activity. The most recent eruptions were approximately 10,000 years ago. Notable geological features nearby include:

*Seven Sisters and Mount Quincan are volcanic cones.
*Lake Eacham (Yidyam) and Lake Barrine are lakes inside volcanic craters.
*Mount Hypipamee Crater is a diatreme (crater).
*Tinaroo Dam submerged the old town of Kulara is visible, on whose cricket-pitch, when drought conditions drastically lower the water-level, locals play cricket matches.

== History ==
Prior to European settlement, the area around Yungaburra was inhabited by about sixteen different indigenous groups, among them the Ngatjan, with the custodians being Yidinji people and neighbouring Ngajanji people. The Queensland police and native troops carried out extensive massacres in the area to rid it of blacks. In one incident in 1884, at Skull Pocket just north of the town, a group of Yidinji were surrounded at night, and at dawn mowed down after they fled on hearing the first shot. The children were brained or stabbed to death by native troopers.

In the early 1880s, the area around Allumbah Pocket was used as an overnight stop for miners travelling west from the coast. In 1886 the land was surveyed, and in 1891 settlers moved in.

Allumbah State School opened on 7 June 1909. In 1911 it was renamed Yungaburra State School.

In 1910, the railway arrived and the railway station was named &quot;Yungaburra&quot; by the Queensland Railways Department. The town was then renamed Yungaburra, to avoid confusion with another town called Allumbah. The name &quot;Yungaburra&quot; comes from the local Yidiny word &quot;janggaburru,&quot; denoting the Queensland silver ash (Flindersia bourjotiana).

By 1911, indigenous numbers had fallen to 20% of the pre-settlement population due to disease, conflict with settlers and loss of habitat.

In January 1911, residents of Kulara (a small town to the north of Yungaburra) began lobbying for a school, claiming there were 42 children in the district. Kulara State School opened on 17 June 1912. It closed on 1 September 1958, when the Tinaroo Dam began to fill, inundating the town. However, being on higher ground, the school building was not flooded and became a private residence at 85 Backshall Road (now in Barrine, ).

In 2006, the Atherton Tableland region was damaged by Cyclone Larry, rated as Category 4 cyclone on the Australian scale. Of the 19 heritage listed sites in Yungaburra, only the roofs of the community hall, police station and one of the bush cottages were badly damaged, as were the front of the Yungaburra Butchery and Gem Gallery sign. The town was restored very quickly; little evidence of the cyclone is visible.

Tracks lead to Frawley&#x27;s Pool, a popular swimming hole and picnic area, then further to Yungaburra&#x27;s historical train bridge. In the opposite direction there is a track to the platypus viewing deck. Aside from this all of the tracks are relatively easy and short enough for anyone to do. The site is dedicated to Geoff Tracy, a local renowned environmentalist who died in 2004.

Yungaburra has access to the southern arm of Lake Tinaroo which is popular for fishing, canoeing, sailing, swimming, water-skiing and camping. The other main places to get to Tinaroo are Kairi and the township of Tinaroo.

Lake Barrine and Lake Eacham are crater lakes, formed from volcanoes. Lake Eacham is popular for swimming and Lake Barrine has a teahouse and gift shop as well as cruises around the lake however is unsuitable for swimming due to the cruise boats. Both lakes have walking tracks around them. Lake Barrine&#x27;s track is and Lake Eacham&#x27;s is .

<text>Richard C. Byrd ( 1805 – June 1, 1854) was an American politician who served as acting governor of Arkansas from January 10 to April 19, 1849, following the resignation of Thomas S. Drew.

==Biography==
Byrd was born 1805 in Mississippi Territory (present-day Alabama). Byrd, merchant and farmer, moved to Arkansas in 1826. He served as the second auditor of Arkansas Territory from 1829 to 1831, and in the Territorial Legislature from 1833 to 1835.

<doc id="305560" wikidata="Q722246" url="?curid=305560" title="Burton Watson">
<text>Burton Dewitt Watson (June 13, 1925April 1, 2017) was an American sinologist, translator, and writer known for his English translations of Chinese and Japanese literature. Watson&#x27;s translations received many awards, including the Gold Medal Award of the Translation Center at Columbia University in 1979, the PEN Translation Prize in 1982 for his translation with Hiroaki Sato of &quot;From the Country of Eight Islands: An Anthology of Japanese Poetry&quot;, and again in 1995 for &quot;Selected Poems of Su Tung-p&#x27;o&quot;. In 2015, at age 88, Watson was awarded the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation for his long and prolific translation career.

==Life and career==
Watson was born on June 13, 1925, in New Rochelle, New York, where his father was a hotel manager. In 1943, at age 17, Watson dropped out of high school to join the U.S. Navy. He was stationed on repair vessels in the South Pacific during the final years of World War II. His ship was in the Marshall Islands when the war ended in August 1945, and on September 20, 1945 it sailed to Japan to anchor at the Yokosuka Naval Base, where Watson had his first direct experiences with Japan and East Asia. As he recounts in &quot;Rainbow World&quot;, on his first shore leave, he and his shipmates encountered a stone in Tokyo with musical notation on it; they sang the melody, as best they could. Some months later, Watson realized that he had been in Hibiya Park and that the song was &quot;Kimigayo&quot;.

Watson left Japan in February 1946, was discharged from the Navy, and was accepted into Columbia University on the G.I. Bill, where he majored in Chinese. His main Chinese teachers were the American Sinologist L. Carrington Goodrich and the Chinese scholar Wang Chi-chen. At that time, most of the Chinese curriculum focused on learning to read Chinese characters and Chinese literature, as it was assumed that any &quot;serious students&quot; could later learn to actually speak Chinese by going to China. He also took one year of Japanese. Watson spent five years studying at Columbia, earning a B.A. in 1949 and an M.A. in 1951.

After receiving his master&#x27;s degree, Watson hoped to move to China for further study, but the Chinese Communist Partywhich had taken control of China in 1949 with their victory in the Chinese Civil Warhad closed the country to Americans. He was unable to find any positions in Taiwan or Hong Kong, and so moved to Japan using the last of his GI savings. Once there, he secured three positions in Kyoto: as an English teacher at Doshisha University, as a graduate student and research assistant to Yoshikawa Kōjirō, Professor of Chinese Language and Literature at Kyoto University, and as a tutor in English, giving private lessons. His combined salary was about $50 per month, and he lived much like other Japanese graduate students. In 1952, he was able to resign his position at Doshisha, thanks to payment from Columbia University for his work on &quot;Sources in Chinese Tradition&quot;, and later in the year, a position as a Ford Foundation Overseas Fellow. 

Watson had long been interested in translating verse. His first significant translations were of &quot;kanshi&quot; (poems in Chinese written by Japanese), made in 1954 for Donald Keene, who was compiling an anthology of Japanese literature. A few years later, Watson sent some translations of early Chinese poems from the &quot;Yutai Xinyong&quot; to Ezra Pound for comment; Pound replied but did not critique the translations. In subsequent years, Watson became friends with Gary Snyder, who lived in Kyoto in the 1950s, and through him Cid Corman and Allen Ginsberg.

In 1956, Watson received a PhD from Columbia for his dissertation &quot;Ssu-ma Ch&#x27;ien: The Historian and His Work&quot;, a study of Sima Qian. He then worked as a member of Ruth Fuller Sasaki&#x27;s team translating Buddhist texts into English under the auspices of Columbia University&#x27;s Committee on Oriental Studies, returning to Columbia in August 1961. He subsequently taught at Columbia and Stanford as a professor of Chinese. He and Donald Keene frequently participated in the seminars that William Theodore de Bary conducted at Columbia.

Watson moved to Japan in 1973. He remained there for the rest of his life. He devoted much of his time to translation, both of literary works, and of more routine texts such as advertisements and instruction manuals. He never married, but was in a long-term relationship with his partner Norio Hayashi. He stated in an interview with John Balcom that his translations of Chinese poems were greatly influenced by the translations of Pound and Arthur Waley, particularly Waley. He also took up Zen meditation and kōan study. Although he worked as a translator for the Soka Gakkai, a Japanese Buddhist organization, he was not a follower of the Nichiren school of Buddhism or a member of the Soka Gakkai. 

Despite his extensive activity in translating ancient Chinese texts, he did not visit China until he spent three weeks there in the summer of 1983, with expenses paid by the Soka Gakkai.

Watson died on April 1, 2017, aged 91, at the Hatsutomi Hospital in Kamagaya, Japan.

<text>Louis Cachet (born Kristian Vikernes; 11 February 1973), better known as Varg Vikernes (), is a Norwegian musician and author best known for his early black metal albums and later for his crimes. His first five records, released under the name Burzum from 1992 to 1996, made him one of the most influential figures in the early Norwegian black metal scene. He was convicted of murder and arson in 1994 and sentenced to 21 years in prison, being released after serving 15 years.

A native of Fana in Bergen Municipality, Vikernes began playing guitar at the age of 14 and formed his first band, Kalashnikov (later known as Uruk-Hai), by 1989. He went on to join the band Old Funeral, in which he played guitar from 1989 until his departure in 1991. He recorded multiple tracks with the band, which were featured on the &quot;Devoured Carcass&quot; EP, as well as various compilation albums released years later. In 1992, Vikernes, along with other members of the scene, was suspected of burning down four Christian churches in Norway. Vikernes denied committing the arsons, though he supported them. In 1992–1993, he also recorded bass for Mayhem&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas&quot; (1994).

In August 1993, Vikernes fatally stabbed Mayhem guitarist Euronymous during an altercation at the latter&#x27;s apartment, and was arrested shortly after. In May 1994, Vikernes was convicted of first-degree murder, church arson and possession of explosives. Vikernes has always maintained the killing was self-defense, and unsuccessfully argued for the charge to be reduced to voluntary manslaughter. He was sentenced to 21 years in prison, the maximum penalty under Norwegian law. During his incarceration, Vikernes launched the neo-Nazi organisation Norwegian Heathen Front, had two books published, and released two ambient albums as Burzum. In 2009, he was released on parole, after which he moved to France with his wife and children, where he has continued to write and make music. He was also an active video blogger on his YouTube channel ThuleanPerspective, before the channel was banned by the platform.

Described by Sam Dunn as &quot;the most notorious metal musician of all time&quot;, Vikernes remains controversial for his crimes as well as his political and religious views. He promoted views which combined Odinism and Esoteric Nazism, and openly embraced Nazism during the mid-to-late 1990s. He has since disavowed the ideology and its associated movements, although critics continue to label his views as far-right. Vikernes calls his beliefs &quot;Odalism&quot; and defends a &quot;pre-industrial European pagan society&quot; that opposes the Abrahamic religions and systems such as capitalism, communism, materialism, and socialism.

== Biography ==

=== Background and childhood ===
In the interviews printed in the 1998 book &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot;, Vikernes discusses his background and childhood. &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; also includes an interview with his mother, Helene Bore (the book and a newspaper depicted there refer to her with the given name Lene, whereas Vikernes&#x27; own website uses the name Helene). In a 2004 interview, Vikernes said his mother was &quot;working in a large oil company&quot;. His father is an electronics engineer, and his older brother is a civil engineer.

In the &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; interview, Vikernes recalls that when he was 6 years old, the family moved for about a year to Baghdad, Iraq, because Vikernes&#x27; &quot;father was working for Saddam Hussein&quot; developing a computer program. Since there were no places available in the English school in Baghdad, the young Vikernes went to an Iraqi elementary school during this time. According to his interview, Vikernes here became &quot;aware of racial matters&quot;. Corporal punishment was very common in the school, and on one occasion, Vikernes had a &quot;quarrel&quot; with a teacher and called him &quot;a monkey&quot;. But as Vikernes perceived it the teachers &quot;didn&#x27;t dare to hit me because I was white&quot;. Vikernes&#x27; mother also recalls that &quot;the other children in his class would get slapped by their teachers; he would not&quot;. She mentions that this created problems, but generally she &quot;has no good explanation&quot; of how Varg developed his views.

When asked about his father, Vikernes states that he was hysterical that his son &quot;had a swastika flag at home&quot;. Vikernes feels that his father was a hypocrite because he was worried about Vikernes &quot;being a Nazi&quot;, whereas he too was &quot;pissed about all the colored people he saw in town&quot;. About his mother, Vikernes states that she was &quot;very race conscious&quot;, in the sense that she was afraid that Vikernes &quot;was going to come home with a black girl!&quot; At the time of the 1995 &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; interview, Vikernes still had a positive relationship with his mother but &quot;very little contact&quot; with his father. He also stated that his parents are divorced; Vikernes&#x27; father is said to have &quot;left about 10 years ago&quot;, which would have been 1985, when Vikernes was 11 or 12.

The &quot;Encyclopedia of White Power&quot; and historian Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke have both alleged that Vikernes was part of the neo-Nazi skinhead culture as an adolescent. When asked in the &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; interview whether he hung out with skinheads in Bergen, Vikernes said that &quot;there were no skinheads in Bergen&quot;.

According to an interview posted on his official website, Vikernes&#x27; facial scar was caused by a skiing accident when he was 11 years old.

A fan of classical music as a child (Tchaikovsky in particular), Vikernes started listening to heavy metal at 12, citing Iron Maiden as his biggest inspiration. Later, he discovered other metal bands whose sound would be influential on his own band, such as Kreator, Sodom, Celtic Frost, Bathory, Destruction, Megadeth, Slayer, Pestilence, Deicide and Von. Although Venom are widely considered the primary influence on black metal, Vikernes has always denied to be influenced by them, as well as defining the band as &quot;a joke&quot;. He once wore a T-shirt of Venom&#x27;s &quot;Black Metal&quot; to promote the genre but stated he later regretted doing that.

From an early age, Vikernes was also deeply fascinated with the fictional realm of Middle-earth created by J. R. R. Tolkien. His stage name, Grishnakh, is taken from that of an orc in &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, while the band name Burzum, meaning &quot;darkness&quot;, was taken from the Black Speech inscribed on the One Ring in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The inscription read &quot;Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk agh &quot;burzum&quot;-ishi krimpatul&quot;, or in English, &quot;One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the &quot;darkness&quot; bind them.&quot; Additionally, before joining the Bergen death metal band Old Funeral, he was in a band called Uruk-Hai, which was named for a type of orc from Tolkien&#x27;s writing.

=== Early musical career ===

Vikernes started playing guitar at the age of 14. When he was 17, Vikernes came into contact with members of Old Funeral. He played guitar with them during 1990–1991 and performed on their &quot;Devoured Carcass&quot; EP before he began his solo musical project, Burzum, and quickly became involved with the early Norwegian black metal scene. During 1992–1993, he recorded four albums as Burzum.

Vikernes has stated that for the recording of these early albums he used an old Westone guitar, which he had bought in 1987 from an acquaintance. He used the cheapest bass guitar there was in his local shop and borrowed a drum kit from Old Funeral, the successor band Immortal, and &quot;another musician living nearby&quot;. On &quot;Hvis lyset tar oss&quot;, he also borrowed Hellhammer&#x27;s drum kit, the same one Hellhammer used to record &quot;De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas&quot; by Mayhem. He used a Peavey amplifier, but for the recording of &quot;Filosofem&quot;, he used the amplifier on his brother&#x27;s stereo and some old fuzz pedals. For vocals, he would use whatever microphone the sound tech handed him, but during the recording of &quot;Filosofem&quot;, he intentionally used the worst mic they had, a headset mic. On the track &quot;Dungeons of Darkness&quot;, he used the large gong at Grieghallen for background noise (Euronymous assisted him by beating his fists on it).

In 1992, Vikernes joined the black metal band Mayhem, a year after band member Dead committed suicide on 8 April 1991. Vikernes replaced bassist Necrobutcher, who quit the band because of Euronymous&#x27; treatment of Dead&#x27;s suicide.

Vikernes has distanced himself from his black metal past, claiming he &quot;came under the influence of an absolute degenerate loser, Øystein&quot;, and blaming his past actions and &quot;degeneracy&quot; on the negative influence of others in the scene. In a 2020 blog post, Vikernes wrote that he had many differences with others in the black metal scene from the beginning; they did not care for his political opinions or rifle collection, and he changed his beliefs to fit in.

=== Arson of churches ===

On 6 June 1992, the Fantoft Stave Church, dating from the 12th century and considered architecturally significant, was burned to the ground by arson. The cover of Burzum&#x27;s EP &quot;Aske&quot; (&quot;ashes&quot;) is a photograph of the destroyed church. By January 1993, arson attacks had occurred on at least seven other major stave churches, including one on Christmas Eve of 1992. Vikernes was found guilty of several of these cases: the arson and attempted arson of Åsane Church and Storetveit Church in Bergen, the arson of Skjold Church in Vindafjord, and the arson of Holmenkollen Chapel in Oslo. He was also charged with the arson of Fantoft Stave Church, although the jurors found him not guilty. The judges called this an error but did not overthrow the whole case.

At the time, media outlets reported that Vikernes was associated with theistic Satanism. In later interviews Vikernes, while not accepting responsibility for the arsons, said that they were not Satanic, but instead &quot;revenge&quot; for the Christian desecration of Viking graves and temples. According to Vikernes, the arsons were on the anniversary of the Lindisfarne Viking raid. Vikernes claimed that all the burnings, except for the one at Stavanger, were done by one person.

==== &quot;Bergens Tidende&quot; article ====
In January 1993, an article in one of Norway&#x27;s biggest newspapers, &quot;Bergens Tidende&quot;, brought the black metal scene into the media spotlight. Two friends of Vikernes interviewed him and brought the interview to the newspaper, hoping they would print it. In the anonymous interview, &quot;Count Grishnackh&quot; (Vikernes) claimed to have burnt the churches and killed a man in Lillehammer. &quot;BT&quot; journalist Finn Bjørn Tønder set up a meeting with Count Grishnackh with help from the friends. The journalists were summoned to an apartment and reportedly warned that they would be shot if the police were called. There, Vikernes and his companions told the journalists that they had burnt the churches, or knew who had done it, and said that the attacks would continue. They claimed to be devil worshippers and said: &quot;Our intention is to spread fear and devilry [...] that is why we are telling this to &quot;Bergens Tidende&quot;.&quot; They gave the journalists details about the arsons that hadn&#x27;t been released to the press, so &quot;BT&quot; spoke with the police before publishing it, who confirmed these details.

The article was published on 20 January as the front page of the &quot;BT&quot;. It was headlined &quot;We Lit the Fires&quot; and included a photo of Vikernes, his face mostly hidden, holding two large knives. However, by the time the article was printed, Vikernes had already been arrested. The police found him by going to an address printed on a Burzum flyer.

According to Vikernes, the anonymous interview was planned by himself and Euronymous. The goal, he says, was to scare people, promote black metal, and get more customers for Helvete. At the time, Burzum was about to release the &quot;Aske&quot; mini-album. Some of the other scene members were also arrested and questioned, but all were released for lack of evidence. Jørn Inge Tunsberg of Hades said that the interview had &quot;grave consequences&quot; for the rest of the scene and that they did not know he was going to talk to the press, as &quot;he had said nothing&quot;. He added that they became &quot;bloody angry&quot; and he, Tunsberg, was &quot;pissed off&quot;.

Norwegian magazine &quot;Rock Furore&quot; published an interview with Vikernes in February 1993. In it, he said of the prison system: &quot;It&#x27;s much too nice here. It&#x27;s not hell at all. In this country prisoners get a bed, toilet and shower. It&#x27;s completely ridiculous. I asked the police to throw me in a real dungeon, and also encouraged them to use violence&quot;. He was released in March for lack of evidence.

=== Murder of Euronymous ===
In early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes. After the &quot;Bergens Tidende&quot; episode, Euronymous decided to shut Helvete down as it began to draw the attention of the police and media.

On the night of 10 August 1993, Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death at his apartment in Oslo. The murder was initially blamed on Swedish black metallers by the media. It has been speculated that the murder was the result of a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records (Euronymous owed Vikernes a large sum of royalty payments), or an attempt at &quot;outdoing&quot; a recent stabbing in Lillehammer committed by Emperor drummer Faust. Vikernes claims that he killed Euronymous in self-defense. He says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an electroshock weapon, tie him up, and torture him to death while videotaping the event. Vikernes explains: &quot;If he was talking about it to everybody and anybody I wouldn&#x27;t have taken it seriously. But he just told a select group of friends, and one of them told me&quot;. He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned contract to ambush him.

On the night of the murder, Vikernes and Snorre &quot;Blackthorn&quot; Ruch drove from Bergen to Euronymous&#x27; apartment at Tøyengata in Oslo. Blackthorn allegedly stood in the stairwell smoking while Vikernes went to Euronymous&#x27; apartment on the fourth floor. Vikernes said he met Euronymous at the door to hand him the signed contract, but when he stepped forward and confronted Euronymous, Euronymous &quot;panicked&quot; and kicked him in the chest. Vikernes claims Euronymous ran into the kitchen to fetch a knife. The two got into a struggle and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. His body was found in the stairwell on the first floor with 23 stab wounds—two to the head, five to the neck, and 16 to the back. Vikernes claimed his final stab to the skull was so powerful the knife remained stuck in Euronymous&#x27; skull, but no physical evidence or bodily injuries supported his claim. Vikernes contended that most of Euronymous&#x27; wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle. After the murder, Vikernes and Blackthorn drove back to Bergen. On the way, they stopped at a lake where Vikernes disposed of his bloodstained clothes. This claim of self-defense is doubted by Emperor drummer Faust, but Mayhem bassist Necrobutcher believed Vikernes did kill Euronymous due to the aforementioned death threats.

Blackthorn claimed Vikernes planned to murder Euronymous and pressured him into coming along. He claimed that, in the summer of 1993, he was almost committed to a mental hospital but fled to Bergen and stayed with Vikernes. Blackthorn said of the murder, &quot;I was neither for nor against it. I didn&#x27;t give a shit about Øystein&quot;. Vikernes, however, claims that he had not planned the killing and that Blackthorn came along to show Euronymous some new guitar riffs. Vikernes called Blackthorn&#x27;s claims a &quot;defense [...] to make sure I couldn&#x27;t blame &quot;him&quot; [for the murder]&quot;.
Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993 in Bergen. The police found 150 kg of explosives and 3,000 rounds of ammunition in his home. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of White Power&quot;, Vikernes &quot;intended to blow up Blitz House, the radical leftist and anarchist enclave in Oslo&quot;, a plan that &quot;was reportedly on the verge of execution.&quot; In an article originally published in 1999, Kevin Coogan also mentioned Vikernes&#x27; alleged intent to &quot;destroy an Oslo-based punk anti-fascist squat called Blitz House&quot;, and stated &quot;Vikernes may have felt that he had no choice but to kill Euronymous before bombing Blitz House because &#x27;the Communist&#x27; would almost certainly have opposed such an act.&quot; Vikernes denied these claims in a 2009 interview, saying he was collecting explosives and ammunition &quot;in order to defend Norway if we were attacked any time.&quot;

==== Trial ====
Vikernes&#x27; trial began on 2 May 1994; he was represented by the lawyer Stein-Erik Mattsson. Many other members of the scene, including Blackthorn and Faust, were put on trial around the same time. Some of them confessed to their crimes and implicated others. According to &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot;, &quot;Vikernes is disgusted by the fact that, while he held fast to a code of silence, others confessed.&quot;

During the trial, the media made Vikernes &quot;the nation&#x27;s first real bogeyman in fifty years&quot;. At the trial it was claimed that he, Blackthorn, and another friend had planned the murder. The court alleged that this third person stayed at the apartment in Bergen as an alibi; to make it look like they never left Bergen, he was to rent films, play them in the apartment, and withdraw money from Vikernes&#x27; credit card.

On 16 May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway&#x27;s maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of three churches, the attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150 kg of explosives. Though Vikernes only confessed to the theft and storage of the explosives, two churches were set on fire the day he was sentenced, &quot;presumably as a statement of symbolic support&quot;. Blackthorn, who hadn&#x27;t taken part in the murder as he had gone down the condominium&#x27;s stairs to smoke, was sentenced to 8 years in prison for being an accomplice.

May 1994 also saw the release of Mayhem&#x27;s album &quot;De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas&quot;, which has Euronymous on electric guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar. Before the release, Euronymous&#x27; family had asked Mayhem&#x27;s drummer, Hellhammer, to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes. Hellhammer said &quot;I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was re-recording the bass parts, but I never did.&quot;

=== Imprisonment ===

Vikernes served his sentence at the prisons in Bergen, Tønsberg, Ringerike, Trondheim, and Tromsø.

According to Swedish scholar Matthias Gardell in his book &quot;Gods of the Blood&quot;, Vikernes launched the Norwegian Heathen Front (&quot;Norsk Hedensk Front&quot;) during his early years in prison. Gardell says this was a pagan neo-Nazi group that grew into the international Pan-Germanic Heathen Front (&quot;Allgermanische Heidnische Front&quot; or AHF). According to Xavier Cattarinich, Vikernes was the &quot;self-proclaimed leader&quot; of the Norwegian Heathen Front and Goodrick-Clarke mentions that Vikernes underlined &quot;his role as chieftain of his Norwegian Heathen Front&quot; with the writing of &quot;Vargsmål&quot;. The Heathen Front officially denied that Vikernes was in charge. According to the authors of &quot;Lord of Chaos&quot;, this may have been to protect him, as Norwegian prisoners were prohibited from leading political groups. In addition, the organization&#x27;s listed address was the same PO box Vikernes used in prison, which the authors state would have made it &quot;very hard for him [Vikernes] to do an effective job&quot; at leading the organization, as all letters would have been screened by the prison personnel. Vikernes said &quot;I have never formed or been a member of such organizations. The only organization I am a member of is Riksmålsforbundet&quot; (&quot;The Society for the Preservation of Traditional Standard Norwegian&quot;). However, Vikernes did come into contact with the neo-Nazi group Zorn 88, and wrote articles in its magazine &quot;Gjallarhorn&quot;. One of the group&#x27;s leading members, esotericist Jan Erik Kvamsdahl helped Vikernes publish &quot;Vargsmål&quot; and set up the Heathen Front according to the &quot;Monitor&quot; organization.

On 8 April 1997, Norwegian police arrested five neo-Nazis in Hemnes Municipality. According to police, the young men were part of a self-styled &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; and were plotting attacks on political and religious figures in Norway. They also had plans to break Vikernes out of prison. The group &quot;had all the trappings of a paramilitary unit&quot;, including guns, explosives, bulletproof vests, steel helmets and balaclavas. One of its members, Tom Eiternes, had befriended Vikernes in prison before escaping while on leave. Vikernes&#x27; mother, Lene Bore, was arrested for supplying the group with 100,000 kroner. She confessed, but claimed she did not know they were &quot;right-wing extremists&quot; and said her son was being attacked by fellow inmates. In late 1996, his jaw had reportedly been broken in a fight with another inmate. However, the prison director said her claims were unfounded, and police suspected that the money came from Vikernes himself. &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; says that Vikernes adopted a &quot;skinhead&quot; look and wore a belt buckle with SS insignia around this time. Despite her confession, Bore was not convicted, and in 1998 the case against the &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; was dropped.

During his time in prison, Vikernes recorded two albums made up wholly of ambient and neofolk music. The first, &quot;Dauði Baldrs&quot;, was recorded in 1994–1995 and released in October 1997. The second, &quot;Hliðskjálf&quot;, was recorded in 1998 and released in April 1999. Vikernes was denied access to an electric guitar, bass guitar or drums, and instead used a synthesizer. In 2000, Vikernes decided to put Burzum on hold. He believed that his philosophy was constantly misinterpreted by an ignorant fan base that was too closely related to black metal and Satanism. Later, through his website, he indicated that he hoped to continue Burzum after his release from prison, stating: &quot;I will publish a few books, possibly using a pseudonym in order to stay anonymous, and perhaps a Burzum album or two, but that&#x27;s it&quot;. In the early 2000s Vikernes regularly wrote articles in the magazine of the neopagan neo-Nazi group Vigrid.
In August 2003, Vikernes was transferred from a maximum-security prison in Bergen to the low-security prison in Tønsberg. On 15 October, the local paper, &quot;Tønsbergs Blad&quot;, published an article that criticised Vikernes. On 26 October, Vikernes went on the run after being granted a short leave. He stopped a car in Numedal. Inside it was a family of three, who said that he hijacked the car at gunpoint. About 19 hours later, police stopped the car in Romerike and arrested him. The car contained knives, a gas mask, camouflage clothing, a portable GPS navigator, maps, a compass, a laptop and a mobile phone. Police also found a handgun and a G3 automatic rifle in a cabin in Rollag Municipality, where Vikernes had hidden during his escape. They concluded that his escape &quot;was well planned and involved assistance from several people on the outside&quot;. Before the escape, Vikernes gave his mother a letter. In it, he wrote that he had received death threats and another inmate had tried to strangle him shortly after the newspaper article was published. For his actions, thirteen months were added to Vikernes&#x27; sentence and he was moved to a prison in Ringerike. In July 2004, he was moved to a maximum-security prison in Trondheim. The last three years of his sentence were spent in Tromsø Prison.

When Vikernes was convicted, it was possible to be released on parole after serving 12 years of a 21-year sentence, but in 2002, before he became eligible, the Norwegian Parliament had extended this to 14 years. In June 2006, after serving 12 years, Vikernes was denied parole by the Department of Criminal Justice for this reason. His lawyer, John Christian Elden, has complained that the policy change is a form of retroactive legislation. Article 97 of the Norwegian constitution forbids any law being given retroactive force. Vikernes was denied parole again in June 2008, although he was allowed to leave Tromsø Prison for short periods to visit his family. His full sentence would run for another seven years. In March 2009, however, his parole was announced. He had then served nearly 15 years of his 21-year sentence. On 22 May 2009, he confirmed that he had been released from prison on probation.

=== Life after prison ===
Vikernes continued with Burzum after his release. He released a further three black metal albums: &quot;Belus&quot; (2010), &quot;Fallen&quot; (2011) and &quot;Umskiptar&quot; (2012) and a compilation of re-recorded songs (&quot;From the Depths of Darkness&quot;). On 27 April 2013, Vikernes posted a song on his official YouTube channel, titled &quot;Back to the Shadows&quot;, which Vikernes has stated to be the last metal track to be released by Burzum. In May 2013, he released another ambient album, &quot;Sôl austan, Mâni vestan&quot;.

In the years following his release from prison, Vikernes became an active video blogger on his YouTube channel, ThuleanPerspective (or Thulêan Perspective). In 2013, Vikernes and his wife released a film called &quot;ForeBears&quot;, based on bear worship during the time of the Neanderthals, and inspired by the Egyptian Book of the Dead.

Vikernes was one of the recipients of far-right terrorist Anders Behring Breivik&#x27;s manifesto, which Breivik sent out before launching the 2011 Norway attacks, killing 77 people. Although Vikernes condemned Breivik&#x27;s actions, this drew the attention of the French authorities.

On 16 July 2013, Vikernes and his wife, a French national, were arrested at their home in Corrèze, France, on suspicion of planning acts of terrorism after his wife bought four rifles. Officials later stated that Vikernes&#x27; wife had a legal firearms permit to buy the rifles. The two were later released without charge after police failed to identify any terrorist plans or targets. Vikernes was instead charged by French authorities with inciting racial hatred against Jews and Muslims. This was due to posts on his blog, &quot;Thulean Perspective&quot;, which included antisemitic posts that were taken down following the charges. Vikernes claimed he had not written the posts, although the blog attributed all posts to him. On 8 July 2014, Vikernes was convicted of inciting racial hatred and sentenced to six months of probation and a fine of .

In June 2018, Vikernes made comments that he had &quot;moved on&quot; from Burzum on his YouTube channel, saying &quot;bye bye&quot; to the project.

YouTube removed Vikernes&#x27;s channel from the platform in June 2019, by which point it had 250,000 subscribers. This coincided with an announcement from YouTube that it would be more aggressive in removing &quot;videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion&quot;.

In late 2019, Vikernes announced on Twitter that he intended to release another album as Burzum. Titled &quot;Thulêan Mysteries&quot;, the album was released in March 2020. Vikernes stated at the time that this would be his last album under the Burzum name. In 2024, however, he began releasing singles in his former black metal style under the name &quot;Burzum (NEW)&quot;, intended to form an album called &quot;The Land of Thule&quot; when put together.

== Writing ==
In late 1994, while in prison, Vikernes wrote a Norwegian-language book called &quot;Vargsmål&quot; (&quot;Varg&#x27;s Speech&quot;). Vikernes has said he wrote &quot;Vargsmål&quot; to defend himself against the media. According to &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot;, &quot;Vargsmål&quot; became available on the Internet for some time in 1996 but not in a printed form. In 1997, a Norwegian publisher released a paperback edition of the book; its publication was financed by Vikernes&#x27;s mother, Helene Bore. As of 1999, &quot;Vargsmål&quot; was being sold by the Nazi organization Heathen Front via its website.

In 1998 he wrote a book called &quot;Germansk Mytologi og Verdensanskuelse&quot; (&quot;Teutonic Mythology and Worldview&quot;) that was published by Cymophane in 2000.

In 2011, Abstract Sounds Books published Vikernes&#x27;s English book entitled &quot;Sorcery and Religion in Ancient Scandinavia&quot;, about the religious practices of Scandinavian peoples, particularly during the Stone Age and Bronze Age. According to a review from the music blog &quot;Heathen Harvest&quot;, the book rejects accepted academic theories, instead focusing on Vikernes&#x27;s speculation and personalized story-telling.

By late 2003, Vikernes had begun writing articles for Burzum.org, which became the official Burzum website. He also wrote for his personal blog, Thulean Perspective, which was set up in January 2013. The website Ancestral Cult was created by him and his wife.

Vikernes has self-published a tabletop role-playing game named &quot;MYFAROG&quot; (Mythic Fantasy Role-playing Game). In 2019, he announced that the upcoming ambient album of Burzum, &quot;Thulêan Mysteries&quot;, was also intended as background music for the game. The game has been criticized for its overcomplicated rule set as well as racist references; there are multiple nonplayable enemy races collectively referred to as Koparmenn (&quot;copper men&quot;) who are described as filthy and animalistic, and presumably represent non-Europeans.

From 2017, Vikernes also wrote a series, which includes three volumes, titled &quot;Paganism Explained&quot;, with his spouse, Marie Cachet, the parts are as follows, &quot;Thrymskvida&quot;, &quot;Little Red Riding Hood &amp; Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;, &quot;The Cult of Mithra &amp; Hymiskvida&quot;, &quot;Valholl &amp; Odinn in Yggdrasill&quot;, and &quot;Ásgardr, Vanaheimr &amp; the Nine Worlds of Hel&quot;

== Views ==
In &quot;&quot;, director Sam Dunn described Vikernes as &quot;the most notorious metal musician of all time&quot; due to his crimes as well as his political and religious views. While in prison, Vikernes promoted views which combined Odinism and Esoteric Nazism. Scholar of religion Egil Asprem characterized Vikernes as &quot;an idol for skinheads with an inclination towards Paganism and for contemporary Pagans with an inclination towards National Socialism&quot;. In a 2005 statement on his website, Vikernes wrote that although he had &quot;occasionally used the term &#x27;nazism&#x27; to describe [his] ideological foundation&quot;, he no longer describes himself as such. He had used the term following his 1994 conviction until the late 1990s and in 2022 stated that he &quot;appreciated&quot; being labelled as a Nazi. Among other things, he did not wish to be associated with anti-Slavic sentiments.

Since the late 1990s, he has described his views as &quot;Odalism&quot;, which he says encompasses &quot;Paganism, traditional nationalism, racialism and environmentalism&quot;. Vikernes also advocates social conservatism, simple living and self-sufficiency (including survivalism). Vikernes has described his own ideology as fiercely anti-modern. According to Eric Brown writing for the &quot;International Business Times&quot;, Vikernes opposes anything deemed &quot;a threat to a pre-industrial European pagan society, including but not limited to Christianity, Islam, Judaism, capitalism and materialism&quot;, and he also &quot;rallies against a perceived international Jewish conspiracy to destroy the traditional European identity&quot;.

Vikernes rejects the out of Africa theory of human origins and instead claims that modern Europeans, especially Nordic peoples, are not &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; but are instead descended primarily from Neanderthals and in fact have &quot;close to no or even no non-Neanderthal admixture&quot;. This is not accepted by mainstream science.

Vikernes wrote a blog post sympathetic to some of the views of Anders Behring Breivik, but said he suspected Breivik carried out his terrorist attack as part of a Jewish conspiracy. He condemned Breivik for killing innocent Norwegians and called him a &quot;Christian loser&quot;, saying the only way to &quot;save Europe&quot; is to &quot;cast aside all Christian and other international nonsense and embrace only the European (i.e. Pagan) values and ideals&quot;. Breivik has later in fact stated
that he identifies as an Odinist, and that he wants Vikernes to be one of the leaders of a new Nazi party in Norway.

Rapper Kanye West has drawn scrutiny for his ties to Vikernes, which have included sampling Burzum&#x27;s 1996 song &quot;Rundgang um die transzendentale säule der singularität&quot; in Gucci Mane&#x27;s &quot;Pussy Print&quot;, posing in a Burzum T-shirt, and allegedly modeling his &quot;Vultures&quot; album cover after one of Burzum&#x27;s own albums. When asked about this, Vikernes expressed apathy toward West, writing &quot;I know very little about him or what he says or does, and I kind of have very little incentive to &#x27;find out&#x27;. it is better to spend time on something more fruitful.&quot; He later praised West for his support, saying, &quot;I think it shows courage to publicly wear a Burzum shirt, like he has done. You risk the wrath (including boycott) of an entire music industry, completely under the control of… &#x27;a certain group.&#x27; So kudos to him for that.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Vikernes and his French wife, Marie Cachet, have a son together who was born in 2007. The couple married the same year. His wife has been diagnosed with high-functioning autism (HFA), and Vikernes claims to have HFA as well though he has not been professionally diagnosed. In a 2008 interview, he said he and his wife were expecting a second child together (her second and his third). After his release from prison, he settled with his family on a small farm in Bø before they moved to Salon-la-Tour in France. In 2017, he said that he had six children and wanted more. In March 2021, his wife gave birth to a daughter, marking their seventh child together.

Vikernes is a teetotaler, having never consumed alcohol or other recreational drugs. He also tries to avoid pharmaceutical drugs, stating, &quot;The only drug use I condone, so to speak, is the medical use of prescription drugs, when it is absolutely necessary (and it rarely is absolutely necessary).&quot;

After his release from prison, he changed his legal name to Louis Cachet in order to avoid difficulties with the public, but still uses the Varg Vikernes name in his daily life.

Vikernes claims he is a distant relative of Norwegian Nazi collaborator Vidkun Quisling through his great-great-grandmother.

== &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; ==
The 1998 book &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; (Feral House) covers the early Norwegian black metal scene. Michael Moynihan, one of the book&#x27;s authors, was sympathetic with Vikernes and his extremist politics. Moynihan disputed that he is a Nazi or white supremacist. In the 2018 film adaptation, he was played by Emory Cohen, which Vikernes criticized for factual inaccuracies and casting a &quot;fat Jewish actor&quot; in his role.

<text>Morbid Angel is an American death metal band based in Tampa, Florida, formed in 1983 by guitarist, primary composer and sole remaining original member Trey Azagthoth, vocalist and bassist Dallas Ward, and drummer Mike Browning. Widely considered one of the most influential bands in the genre and important in the transition of death metal from its thrash metal roots, they were one of the first bands to incorporate guttural vocals, up-tempo blast beats, multiple tempo changes and a dark atmosphere. They have been described as one of &quot;the most influential and emulated bands in death metal&quot;, alongside Obituary, Death, Cynic, Autopsy and Deicide, and have been cited as an influence by many later bands. They were also the first death metal band to experience mainstream success in connection with being signed to Giant Records in 1992, heavy rotation of their music videos on MTV, and having the music video for the song &quot;God of Emptiness&quot; shown on an episode of &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;. Their first three albums – &quot;Altars of Madness&quot; (1989), &quot;Blessed Are the Sick&quot; (1991), and &quot;Covenant&quot; (1993) – are considered classics in the death metal genre.

British music magazine &quot;Terrorizer&quot; ranked &quot;Altars of Madness&quot; first in its list &quot;Top 40 greatest death metal albums&quot;. &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine also rated guitarist Trey Azagthoth as the number one &quot;death metal guitarist ever&quot;. The band&#x27;s songs are complex in arrangement, owing to the considerable technical skills of both Azagthoth as well as drummer Pete Sandoval, the latter of whom also played in the grindcore band Terrorizer. According to Nielsen SoundScan, Morbid Angel is the third best-selling death metal band in the United States (after Cannibal Corpse and Deicide up until 2003 with sales of over 445,000), with their third album &quot;Covenant&quot; being the best-selling death metal album of the Soundscan era with over 150,000 units sold.

The band&#x27;s original lyrical themes, when helmed by Vincent (and Azagthoth and Browning respectively) focused mostly on Satanism, occultism and blasphemous subject matter, but from &quot;Formulas Fatal to the Flesh&quot; (1998) onward, via Azagthoth&#x27;s influence, the lyrics moved toward the ancient Sumerian gods. Much of this is a nod to the Simon Necronomicon, which was influenced by Sumerian mythology, the author H. P. Lovecraft, and fascination with the Roman Empire, and during Steve Tucker&#x27;s tenure they take on more anti-religious and barbaric themes, namely of the strong overcoming the weak.

==History==
===Formation, demos, and &quot;Altars of Madness&quot; (1983–1990)===

Morbid Angel was formed in 1983 in Tampa, Florida by guitarist Trey Azagthoth and drummer/vocalist Mike Browning. In the early stages of their career the band developed a reputation for &quot;gruesome stage antics&quot;. They quickly became highly influential in the formation of the Florida death metal scene, inspiring other highly influential acts such as Obituary. They recorded their debut album, &quot;Abominations of Desolation&quot;, in 1986, but the band was unsatisfied with the final product and it remained unreleased until 1991, printing 10,000 copies. In 1986, David Vincent joined the band, replacing Michael Manson and Sterling von Scarborough as vocalist and bassist respectively. Fellow Terrorizer member, drummer Pete Sandoval, soon followed. 

Their first studio album, &quot;Altars of Madness&quot;, was released in 1989, and is regarded by many as one of the most important death metal albums of all time. Music journalist Jason Birchmeier writes that:Few albums struck a chord within the ears and minds of the late-&#x27;80s underground metal scene like Morbid Angel&#x27;s &quot;Altars of Madness&quot; did at the end of the decade, setting a new precedent for metal bands to reach. With the arguable exception of Chuck Schuldiner&#x27;s Death, never before had a heavy metal band carried their lightning-fast guitar riffs and equally spellbinding guitar solos into such horrific territory. Venom and Slayer redefined the extent to which a metal band could align itself with all things evil during the beginning of the decade, but Morbid Angel made these two groups sound like children&#x27;s music compared to the Florida-based group&#x27;s assaulting death metal sounds and their blasphemous lyrics.

Morbid Angel toured for nearly two years in support of &quot;Altars of Madness&quot;. The tour started in November 1989 when they opened for Napalm Death and Bolt Thrower in the UK and Europe. Most of 1990 and 1991 were spent touring North America, playing with bands such as Pantera, Obituary, Atheist, Death Angel, Forbidden, Sanctuary, Ripping Corpse, Deicide, Sacrifice and Wrath. The &quot;Altars of Madness&quot; tour ended in April 1991 with a Brazilian tour, supported by Sarcófago, Sextrash and Cambio Negro.

===Rise to success (1991–1995)===
In 1991, Morbid Angel released their second album, &quot;Blessed Are the Sick&quot;, which was met with widespread critical acclaim, and is considered by many to be a landmark release in the death metal genre. Morbid Angel toured worldwide in support of &quot;Blessed Are the Sick&quot; throughout 1991 and 1992, headlining a European tour with Sadus, Cathedral, Godflesh and Unleashed, a North American tour (also supported by Unleashed) and then a European tour with Entombed and Unleashed. They also were one of the opening acts (along with Kreator, Sepultura, Headhunter and Wolfsbane) for Motörhead on the &quot;Christmas Metal Meetings &#x27;91&quot; tour, and toured Australia for the first time.

Following the success of &quot;Altars of Madness&quot; and &quot;Blessed Are the Sick&quot;, Morbid Angel were signed by Irving Azoff to Giant Records for one album, with the option of five more. In late 1992, second guitarist Richard Brunelle was kicked out of the band due to alleged substance abuse; instead of replacing him, Morbid Angel moved on as a three-piece.

On June 22, 1993, the band released their third full-length album &quot;Covenant&quot;, which went on to sell over 150,000 copies in the United States alone. Their record label dedicated promotional resources to the album, and commissioned music videos for the songs &quot;Rapture&quot; and &quot;God of Emptiness&quot;. These music videos were put on heavy rotation by MTV, and the latter also appeared on the television show &quot;Beavis and Butt-head&quot;. The success of the album enabled the band to tour with Black Sabbath and Motörhead across the United States from February through March 1994, which David Vincent credits with helping the band significantly expand their audience. Morbid Angel also toured North America with Kreator and Paradise Lost, and Europe with Grave and Dismember.

The band released its fourth studio album, &quot;Domination&quot;, on May 9, 1995, which featured new guitarist Erik Rutan of Ripping Corpse. It proved to be a somewhat controversial album among fans, featuring a slower, more atmospheric and experimental sound than on previous albums. AllMusic describes the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;more groove-oriented&quot;. The album has gone on to sell over 100,000 copies in the United States alone. Regardless, following the release of the album, their record label dropped them from their roster.

===Steve Tucker era (1996–2003)===
In 1996, shortly after the release of their live album titled &quot;Entangled in Chaos&quot;, David Vincent departed from Morbid Angel. He was replaced by Steve Tucker in 1997. They released their fifth full-length album &quot;Formulas Fatal to the Flesh&quot; in 1998, which was considered more aggressive and complex than their previous album &quot;Domination&quot;. With Tucker, the band went on to release &quot;Gateways to Annihilation&quot; and &quot;Heretic&quot; in 2000 and 2003 respectively. Tucker briefly left Morbid Angel in 2001 and was replaced by former Hate Eternal bassist and vocalist Jared Anderson. That year, the band joined Pantera, Skrape, Slayer and Static-X on the Extreme Steel Tour of North America, which was Pantera&#x27;s last major tour.

In 2002, Anderson left the band and Tucker re-assumed his position as bassist and vocalist.

===Reunion with David Vincent (2004–2014)===

In 2004, Morbid Angel parted ways with Earache and Steve Tucker once again left the band, paving the way for former vocalist/bassist David Vincent to return. The band continued by touring and playing festivals such as Wacken Open Air in 2006.

Morbid Angel&#x27;s appearance on some of the mid-summer 2008 European festivals was announced as a &quot;short break from writing and pre-production of their new 8th studio album&quot;. In May 2008, it was announced that Destructhor from Zyklon would be the band&#x27;s new guitarist, and Destructhor would appear on the new album.

On March 18, 2010, the band announced that Tim Yeung would play drums on the upcoming album, allowing Pete Sandoval to recover from back surgery. On June 22, the band entered the studio to begin the recording of their new full-length album. On March 5, 2011, the band headlined the Scion Rock Fest in Pomona, California. This performance was their first in the US in six years, aside from a one-off show in Los Angeles in May 2009. On March 9, Morbid Angel confirmed that their new album would be called &quot;Illud Divinum Insanus&quot;. The album was released on June 7 via Season of Mist. The album incorporated electronic sounds and deviated from the usual sound of the band. In an interview in December 2013, David Vincent confirmed that Pete Sandoval is no longer a member of the band, claiming that Sandoval had &quot;found Jesus&quot;, and stating, &quot;Pete Sandoval and Morbid Angel are not compatible&quot;, laying to rest speculation that Sandoval would eventually be returning to the band.

Asked in a December 2014 interview about Morbid Angel&#x27;s plans for 2015, Vincent replied, &quot;We&#x27;re done [touring] for awhile. It&#x27;s time to write.&quot; Yeung said that the band was in talks of recording an EP.

===Reunion with Steve Tucker (2015–2022)===
On June 15, 2015, it was reported that David Vincent and Tim Yeung were no longer in Morbid Angel. Former vocalist/bassist Steve Tucker shortly rejoined the band once again. Later that day, however, Vincent denied that he had left the band. On his official Facebook page, Tucker hinted in a post on June 17 that Destructhor was no longer part of Morbid Angel either: &quot;Who will play second guitar? Time will answer that one ...&quot; On June 18, this was confirmed, as Destructhor announced his departure from the band to focus on the Norwegian death metal band Myrkskog. The next day, Vincent confirmed his departure due to creative differences. Both he and Yeung teamed up together in late 2016 to form the band I Am Morbid. On August 3, Morbid Angel was signed to UDR Music and was at work on a new studio album, which would be released in 2017, with a tour to follow. Yeung state in an interview with Metal Addicts that &quot;I’ve been waiting to break the news for a while about this. Now seems like the proper time to do so. As some of you know, there have been some lineup changes with Morbid Angel. Unfortunately, due to financial differences, I will not be continuing with them. It has been a great five years being involved with Morbid Angel. I’ve met a ton of great people all over the world, played some amazing shows, and have a ton of great memories as well as stories. I wish Trey (Azagthoth) and Morbid Angel all the best. As for myself, I’m always up for the next opportunity life throws my way.”

On January 9, 2017, Trey Azagthoth announced on his Facebook page that drummer Scott Fuller joined Morbid Angel for the recording of their new album. Additional details indicated that the album title would presumably start with the letter &quot;K&quot;, given the band&#x27;s history on naming their albums alphabetically. On January 10th, the band announced that Dan Vadim Von has joined as second guitarist. They also announced a U.S. tour with Suffocation, Revocation and Withered, which would begin in late May and continue into late June. In a March interview on &quot;The Metal Magdalene with Jet&quot; show on Metal Messiah Radio, Steve Tucker explained that the album would be a &quot;death metal album&quot;. When speaking to Orlando Weekly in May 2017, Tucker said that the tour setlist would not feature any David Vincent era material and would then perform songs featuring him instead. He also said that they would play &quot;probably one or two new songs&quot; from the new album, in which he said that it was &quot;almost done, but we don&#x27;t want to put out too much with YouTube putting it up the next day.&quot; On the opening night on May 23, they performed a new song entitled &quot;Warped&quot;. Morbid Angel canceled their European appearance twice due to passport issues from one of the members. The band&#x27;s management explained that a new passport would not be issued in time for the shows. The band expressed disappointment with the news and issued an apology. On October 5, the cover artwork for the forthcoming album titled &quot;Kingdoms Disdained&quot; was revealed, which was released on December 1 by Silver Lining Music. Later that day, the brand new song &quot;Piles of Little Arms&quot; was made available for streaming, followed by &quot;For No Master&quot; on November 29.

Morbid Angel toured the U.S. in the spring of 2018 with Misery Index and Origin, performing on separate legs. In early 2019, Morbid Angel and Cannibal Corpse toured together for the first time ever, promoted by heavy metal magazine Decibel, with Necrot and Blood Incantation as additional support. Immolation replaced Cannibal Corpse for the final week of the tour.

In a February 2019 interview with Metal Wani, Tucker stated that Morbid Angel was planning to begin working on a new album that year: &quot;I&#x27;m gonna actually start writing some new music, and I think Trey will probably start writing some new music. We&#x27;ll probably do a couple of more tours throughout the year. We have some stuff that&#x27;s being talked about now, but nothing concrete. It&#x27;s that time. It&#x27;s been a little bit over a year since the last album came out. I&#x27;ve kind of got the urge and desire myself to write some more music. So we&#x27;ll start getting into that and continue doing shows.&quot; In March 2019, Morbid Angel appeared on the Adult Swim television series &quot;FishCenter Live&quot;.

On September 27, 2019, it was made public that former Morbid Angel guitarist Richard Brunelle died on September 23 at age 55. The cause of death remains unknown.

=== United States Tour of Terror and Apollo Theatre collapse (2023–present) ===

In celebration of their 40th anniversary, Morbid Angel embarked on a five-week North American tour called the United States Tour of Terror 2023 in March–April 2023, the first to feature new drummer Charlie Koryn following the departure of Scott Fuller.

During the March 31, 2023 show in Belvidere, Illinois, the roof of the concert venue collapsed after it was struck by an EF1 tornado, resulting in the death of one concertgoer, and injuries to at least 40 others.

== Musical style ==
Morbid Angel&#x27;s style of music has undergone a number of changes throughout their musical career. The band&#x27;s sound is characterised by harsh, growled vocals, technically complex guitarwork that frequently makes use of fast tremolo-picking and palm-muted riffs. Trey Azagthoth&#x27;s guitarwork is a core part of the band&#x27;s sound, and his atonal &quot;shredding&quot; style has been likened to the guitar work in Slayer. Pete Sandoval&#x27;s work behind the drums has also been crucial to the band&#x27;s sound, and &quot;is known for his great double bass drum speed and technical proficiency&quot; and as one of the fastest drummers in metal. In addition, &quot;Sandoval is also among the first extreme metal drummers to champion the use of acoustic drum triggers.&quot; On their early albums, they pushed metal to its most extreme level, musically and lyrically. The band has evolved their anti-Christian lyrical themes from these early works. On &quot;Altars of Madness&quot;, the lyrics largely consist of simple blasphemous and overtly Satanic proclamations. However, the sophistication and depth of the lyrics has grown over time. On their 1993 album &quot;Covenant&quot;, the band articulate more broadly anti-theistic lyrics, and profess &quot;anger at a higher power&quot;. Today, &quot;the band&#x27;s lyrics are even more philosophical and thought-provoking. Current lyricist Trey Azagthoth has diagramed his personal ideology in the album &quot;Formulas Fatal to the Flesh&quot;. His stance is blasphemous and non-traditional, but hardly evil.&quot;

== Influence and legacy ==
Morbid Angel have been one of the most highly influential bands in the growth and development of death metal along with death metal band Cannibal Corpse. Former guitarist Erik Rutan went on to form the successful death metal band Hate Eternal, while the South Carolina band Nile have gone on to enjoy significant levels of success in a similar style of death metal. Their sound has also heavily influenced the growth and development of death metal and black metal in South America, as well as of the early black metal scene in Norway. Many bands have cited Morbid Angel as an influence on their own music, including Obituary, Immortal, Krisiun, Gorguts, Behemoth, Dead Congregation, Gojira, Opeth, Pyrrhon, Revocation, and many others. Bands outside the United States influenced by Morbid Angel include the Brazilian projects Abhorrence, Nephasth, Rebaelliun, and Mental Horror, and European black metal bands such as Emperor, Zyklon, and Dimmu Borgir. 

Their early release &quot;Abominations of Desolation&quot; as well as &quot;Altars of Madness&quot; are considered two of the earliest true examples of death metal, as well as two of the most boundary-pushing albums of their time in terms of extremity. Metalsucks named them one of the most important bands of the 1990s, writing that &quot;The band released three seminal albums — &quot;Blessed Are the Sick&quot;, &quot;Covenant&quot;, and &quot;Domination&quot; — between 1991 and 1995 alone (and there are definitely fans who&#x27;d say we&#x27;re being unfair to 1998&#x27;s &quot;Formulas Fatal to the Flesh&quot;). And thanks to a little show called &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, Morbid Angel became death metal&#x27;s ambassadors to the outside world, acting as the gateway drug for who even knows how many scores of kids.&quot;

Guitarist Trey Azagthoth is one of the most influential and widely revered guitarists in heavy metal. Loudwire named him one of the top 10 rock and metal &quot;riff lords&quot;, writing that &quot;Trey Azagthoth left his fingerprints all over the early death metal scene with a unique riffing style still unmatched within the genre today. ... His unconventional style sounds haphazard in its approach, awkwardly stepping over piles of rubbles left from previous riffing attacks, but with crushing effect.&quot; VH1 has described him as &quot;a unique and thrilling lead player more following in the adventurous footsteps of Eddie Van Halen than a stiff tactician. Bands like Hate Eternal and Nile have used the now common death metal language that Morbid Angel commenced. Their influence is most clearly represented by current Metal heavyweight, Gojira.&quot; &quot;SPIN&quot; wrote that &quot;he has blazed a tension-filled style all his own&quot; and that &quot;when he solos, he enters a mystical mind state he calls the &quot;Temple of Ostx&quot;. During the nineties the band were one of a number of bands involved in the scare created around death metal, and were featured in a news report about the issue due to the band&#x27;s overtly Satanic and occult lyrics and imagery.

==Discography==
The band&#x27;s albums are notable for acrostically spelling out the English alphabet (Altars of Madness&quot;, Blessed Are the Sick&quot;, &quot;Covenant&quot;, and so on), with guitarist Trey Azagthoth commenting that it was a coincidence regarding the first two albums, but that it has been done consciously since then. However, letters E and J were skipped, and were instead used in their live albums.

<text>A royalty payment is a payment made by one party to another that owns a particular asset, for the right to ongoing use of that asset. Royalties are typically agreed upon as a percentage of gross or net revenues derived from the use of an asset or a fixed price per unit sold of an item of such, but there are also other modes and metrics of compensation. A royalty interest is the right to collect a stream of future royalty payments.

A license agreement defines the terms under which a resource or property are licensed by one party to another, either without restriction or subject to a limitation on term, business or geographic territory, type of product, etc. License agreements can be regulated, particularly where a government is the resource owner, or they can be private contracts that follow a general structure. However, certain types of franchise agreements have comparable provisions.

==Non-renewable resources==
A landowner with petroleum or mineral rights to their property may license those rights to another party. In exchange for allowing the other party to extract the resources, the landowner receives either a resource rent, or a &quot;royalty payment&quot; based on the value of the resources sold. When a government owns the resource, the transaction often has to follow legal and regulatory requirements.

In the United States, fee simple ownership of mineral rights is possible and payments of royalties to private citizens occurs quite often. Local taxing authorities may impose a severance tax on the unrenewable natural resources extracted or severed from within their authority. The Federal Government receives royalties on production on federal lands, managed by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, formerly the Minerals Management Service.

An example from Canada&#x27;s northern territories is the federal Frontier Lands Petroleum Royalty Regulations. The royalty rate starts at 1% of gross revenues of the first 18 months of commercial production and increases by 1% every 18 months to a maximum of 5% until initial costs have been recovered, at which point the royalty rate is set at 5% of gross revenues or 30% of net revenues. In this manner risks and profits are shared between the government of Canada (as resource owner) and the petroleum developer. This attractive royalty rate is intended to encourage oil and gas exploration in the remote Canadian frontier lands where costs and risks are higher than other locations.

In many jurisdictions in North America, oil and gas royalty interests are considered real property under the NAICS classification code and qualify for a 1031 like-kind exchange.

Oil and gas royalties are paid as a set percentage on all revenue, less any deductions that may be taken by the well operator as specifically noted in the lease agreement. The revenue decimal, or royalty interest that a mineral owner receives, is calculated as a function of the percentage of the total drilling unit to which a specific owner holds the mineral interest, the royalty rate defined in that owner&#x27;s mineral lease, and any tract participation factors applied to the specific tracts owned.

As a standard example, for every $100 bbl of oil sold on a U.S. federal well with a 25% royalty, the U.S. government receives $25. The U.S. government does not pay and will only collect revenues. All risk and liability lie upon the operator of the well.

Royalties in the lumber industry are called &quot;stumpage&quot;.

== Wind Royalties ==
Landowners who host wind turbines are often paid wind royalties, and those nearby may be paid nuisance payments to compensate for noise and flicker effects. Wind royalties are usually paid quarterly, semi-annually, or annually, and the royalty can be a flat rate or variable payment based on production or a combination of both. 

Unlike oil and gas royalties, which typically decline over time, wind royalties often have an escalation clause, making them more valuable over time. Because there is not yet a robust body of law regarding wind royalties, the legal implications of severing wind rights are still unknown. Several states, including Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Montana, and Wyoming, have enacted anti-severance statutes, preventing the wind estate from being severed from the surface. Regardless, the ownership of wind royalties and compensation payments can be transferred from the landowner to another party. Over time, wind royalties will be fractioned similarly to oil and gas royalties.

==Patents==

An intangible asset such as a patent right gives the owner an exclusive right to prevent others from practicing the patented technology in the country issuing the patent for the term of the patent. The right may be enforced in a lawsuit for monetary damages and/or imprisonment for violation on the patent. In accordance with a patent license, royalties are paid to the patent owner in exchange for the right to practice one or more of the basic patent rights: to manufacture, to use, to sell, to offer for sale, or to import a patented product, or to perform a patented method.

Patent rights may be divided and licensed out in various ways, on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis. The license may be subject to limitations as to time or territory. A license may encompass an entire technology or it may involve a mere component or improvement on a technology. 

===United States===
In the United States, &quot;reasonable&quot; royalties may be imposed, both after-the-fact and prospectively, by a court as a remedy for patent infringement. In patent infringement lawsuits, where the court determines an injunction to be inappropriate in light of the case&#x27;s circumstances, the court may award &quot;ongoing&quot; royalties, or royalties based on the infringer&#x27;s prospective use of the patented technology, as an alternative remedy. 
In the old days, US courts often used so-called &quot;entire market rule&quot; or &quot;25% of the profits&quot; rule. However, this practice was rejected by a federal appeals court in 1971. Instead, the courts are required now to use a holistic approach according to Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. United States Plywood Corp. decision. The decision established 15 Georgia-Pacific factors, to be considered, when determining reasonable royalty as a civil remedy (monetary compensation) for patent infringement, in the following order of importance:

# The royalties received by the patentee for the licensing of the patent in suit, proving or tending to prove an established royalty. 
# The rates paid by the licensee for the use of other patents comparable to the patent in suit.
# The nature and scope of the license, as exclusive or non-exclusive; or as restricted or non-restricted in terms of territory or with respect to whom the manufactured product may be sold. 
# The licensor’s established policy and marketing program to maintain his patent monopoly by not licensing others to use the invention or by granting licenses under special conditions designed to preserve that monopoly. 
# The commercial relationship between the licensor and licensee, such as, whether they are competitors in the same territory in the same line of business; or whether they are inventor and promoter. 
# The effect of selling the patented specialty in promoting sales of other products of the licensee; the existing value of the invention to the licensor as a generator of sales of his non-patented items; and the extent of such derivative or convoyed sales. 
# The duration of the patent and the term of the license. 
# The established profitability of the product made under the patent; its commercial success; and its current popularity. 
# The utility and advantages of the patent property over the old modes or devices, if any, that had been used for working out similar results. 
# The nature of the patented invention, the character of the commercial embodiment of it as owned and produced by the licensor; and the benefits to those who have used the invention. 
# The extent to which the infringer has made use of the invention; and any evidence probative of the value of that use. 
# The portion of the profit or of the selling price that may be customary in the particular business or in comparable businesses to allow for the use of the invention or analogous inventions. 
# The portion of the realizable profit that should be credited to the invention as distinguished from non-patented elements, the manufacturing process, business risks, or significant features or improvements added by the infringer. 
# The opinion testimony of qualified experts. 
# The amount that a licensor (such as the patentee) and a licensee (such as the infringer) would have agreed upon (at the time the infringement began) if both had been reasonably and voluntarily trying to reach an agreement; that is, the amount which a prudent licensee—who desired, as a business proposition, to obtain a license to manufacture and sell a particular article embodying the patented invention—would have been willing to pay as a royalty and yet be able to make a reasonable profit and which amount would have been acceptable by a prudent patentee who was willing to grant a license.

At least one study analyzing a sample of 35 cases in which a court awarded an ongoing royalty has found that ongoing royalty awards &quot;exceed by a statistically significant amount the jury-determined reasonable royalty damages&quot;.

In 2007, patent rates within the United States were:
:* a pending patent on a strong business plan, royalties of the order of 1%
:* issued patent, 1%+ to 2%
:* the pharmaceutical with pre-clinical testing, 2–3%

In 2002, the Licensing Economics Review found in a review of 458 licence agreements over a 16-year period an average royalty rate of 7% with a range from 0% to 50%.
All of these agreements may not have been at &quot;arms length&quot;. In license negotiation, firms might derive royalties for the use of a patented technology from the retail price of the downstream licensed product.

===Muslim Countries===
In Muslim (Arab) countries, a royalty as a percentage of sales may not be appropriate, because of the prohibition of usury (see &quot;riba&quot;), and a flat fee may be preferred instead.

==Trade mark==
Trade marks are words, logos, slogans, sounds, or other distinctive expressions that distinguish the source, origin, or sponsorship of a good or service (in which they are generally known as service marks). Trade marks offer the public a means of identifying and assuring themselves of the quality of the good or service. They may bring consumers a sense of security, integrity, belonging, and a variety of intangible appeals. The value that inures to a trade mark in terms of public recognition and acceptance is known as goodwill.

A trade mark right is an exclusive right to sell or market under that mark within a geographic territory. The rights may be licensed to allow a company other than the owner to sell goods or services under the mark. A company may seek to license a trade mark it did not create to achieve instant name recognition rather than accepting the cost and risk of entering the market under its own brand that the public does not necessarily know or accept. Licensing a trade mark allows the company to take advantage of already-established goodwill and brand identification.

Like patent royalties, trade mark royalties may be assessed and divided in a variety of different ways, and are expressed as a percentage of sales volume or income, or a fixed fee per unit sold. When negotiating rates, one way companies value a trade mark is to assess the additional profit they will make from increased sales and higher prices (sometimes known as the &quot;relief from royalty&quot;) method.

Trade mark rights and royalties are often tied up in a variety of other arrangements. Trade marks are often applied to an entire brand of products and not just a single one. Because trade mark law has as a public interest goal of the protection of a consumer, in terms of getting what they are paying for, trade mark licences are only effective if the company owning the trade mark also obtains some assurance in return that the goods will meet its quality standards. When the rights of trade mark are licensed along with a know-how, supplies, pooled advertising, etc., the result is often a franchise relationship. Franchise relationships may not specifically assign royalty payments to the trade mark licence, but may involve monthly fees and percentages of sales, among other payments.

In a long-running dispute in the United States involving the valuation of the DHL trade mark of DHL Corporation, it was reported that experts employed by the IRS surveyed a wide range of businesses and found a broad range of royalties for trade mark use from a low of 0.1% to a high of 15%.

===Franchises===
While a payment to employ a trade mark licence is a royalty, it is accompanied by a &quot;guided usage manual&quot;, the use of which may be audited from time to time. However, this becomes a supervisory task when the mark is used in a franchise agreement for the sale of goods or services carrying the reputation of the mark. For a franchise, it is said, a fee is paid, even though it comprises a royalty element.

To be a franchise, the agreement must be a composite of the items:
::* the right to use a trade mark to offer, sell or distribute goods or services (the trademark element)
::* payment of a required royalty or fee (the fee element)
::* significant assistance or control with respect to the franchisee&#x27;s business (the supervisory element)

One of the above three items must not apply for the franchise agreement to be considered a trade mark agreement (and its laws and conventions). In a franchise, for which there is no convention, laws apply concerning training, brand support, operating systems/support and technical support in a written format (&quot;Disclosure&quot;)

==Copyright==
Copyright law gives the owner the right to prevent others from copying, creating derivative works, or using their works. Copyrights, like patent rights, can be divided in many different ways, by the right implicated, by specific geographic or market territories, or by more specific criteria. Each may be the subject of a separate license and royalty arrangements.

Copyright royalties are often very specific to the nature of work and field of endeavor. With respect to music, royalties for performance rights in the United States are set by the Library of Congress&#x27; Copyright Royalty Board. Performance rights to recordings of a performance are usually managed by one of several performance rights organizations. Payments from these organizations to performing artists are known as residuals and performance royalties. Royalty-free music provides more direct compensation to the artists. In 1999, recording artists formed the Recording Artists&#x27; Coalition to repeal supposedly &quot;technical revisions&quot; to American copyright statutes which would have classified all &quot;sound recordings&quot; as &quot;works for hire&quot;, effectively assigning artists&#x27; copyrights to record labels.

Book authors may sell their copyright to the publisher. Alternatively, they might receive as a royalty a certain amount per book sold. It is common in the UK for example, for authors to receive a 10% royalty on book sales.

Some photographers and musicians may choose to publish their works for a one-time payment. This is known as a royalty-free license.

==Book publishing==

All book-publishing royalties are paid by the publisher, who determines an author&#x27;s royalty rate, except in rare cases in which the author can demand high advances and royalties.

For most cases, the publishers advance an amount (part of the royalty) which can constitute the bulk of the author&#x27;s total income plus whatever little flows from the &quot;running royalty&quot; stream. Some costs may be attributed to the advance paid, which depletes further advances to be paid or from the running royalty paid. The author and the publisher can independently draw up the agreement that binds them or alongside an agent representing the author. There are many risks for the author—definition of cover price, the retail price, &quot;net price&quot;, the discounts on the sale, the bulk sales on the POD (publish on demand) platform, the term of the agreement, audit of the publishers accounts in case of impropriety, etc. which an agent can provide.

The following illustrates the income to an author on the basis chosen for royalty, particularly in POD, which minimizes losses from inventory and is based on computer technologies.

Hardback royalties on the published price of trade books usually range from 10% to 12.5%, with 15% for more important authors. On paperback it is usually 7.5% to 10%, going up to 12.5% only in exceptional cases. All the royalties displayed below are on the &quot;cover price&quot;. Paying 15% to the author can mean that the other 85% of the cost pays for editing and proof-reading, printing and binding, overheads, and the profits (if any) to the publisher.

The publishing company pays no royalty on bulk purchases of books since the buying price may be a third of the cover price sold on a singles basis.

Unlike the UK, the United States does not specify a &quot;maximum retail price&quot; for books that serves as base for calculation.

===Based on net receipts===
Methods of calculating royalties changed during the 1980s, due to the rise of retail chain booksellers, which demanded increasing discounts from publishers. As a result, rather than paying royalties based on a percentage of a book&#x27;s cover price, publishers preferred to pay royalties based on their net receipts. According to &quot;The Writers&#x27; and Artists&#x27; Yearbook&quot; of 1984, under the new arrangement, &quot;appropriate [upward] adjustments are of course made to the royalty figure and the arrangement is of no disadvantage to the author.&quot;

Despite this assurance, in 1991, Frederick Nolan, author and former publishing executive, explained that &quot;net receipts&quot; royalties are often more in the interest of publishers than authors:
It makes sense for the publisher to pay the author on the basis of what he receives, but it by no means makes it a good deal for the author. Example: 10,000 copies of a $20 book with a 10 percent cover-price royalty will earn him $20,000. The same number sold but discounted at 55 percent will net the publisher $90,000; the author&#x27;s ten percent of that figure yields him $9,000. Which is one reason why publishers prefer &quot;net receipts&quot; contracts...Among the many other advantages (to the publisher) of such contracts is the fact that they make possible what is called a &#x27;sheet deal&#x27;. In this, the (multinational) publisher of that same 10,000 copy print run, can substantially reduce his printing cost by &#x27;running on&#x27; a further 10,000 copies (that is to say, printing but not binding them), and then further profit by selling these &#x27;sheets&#x27; at cost-price or even lower if he so chooses to subsidiaries or overseas branches, then paying the author 10 percent of &#x27;net receipts&#x27; from that deal. The overseas subsidiaries bind up the sheets into book form and sell at full price for a nice profit to the Group as a whole. The only one who loses is the author.

In 2003, two American authors Ken Englade and Patricia Simpson sued HarperCollins (USA) successfully for selling their work to its foreign affiliates at improperly high discounts (&quot;Harper Collins is essentially selling books to itself, at discounted rates, upon which it then calculates the author&#x27;s royalty, and then Harper Collins shares in the extra profit when the book is resold to the consumer by the foreign affiliates, without paying the author any further royalty.&quot;)

This forced a &quot;class action&quot; readjustment for thousands of authors contracted by HarperCollins between November 1993 and June 1999.

==Music==
Unlike other forms of intellectual property, music royalties have a strong linkage to individuals – composers (score), songwriters (lyrics) and writers of musical plays – in that they can own the exclusive copyright to created music and can license it for performance independent of corporates. Recording companies and the performing artists that create a &quot;sound recording&quot; of the music enjoy a separate set of copyrights and royalties from the sale of recordings and from their digital transmission (depending on national laws).

With the advent of pop music and major innovations in technology in the communication and presentations of media, the subject of music royalties has become complex.

==Art royalties==

===Resale royalty or &quot;droit de suite&quot;===
Art Resale Royalty is a right to a royalty payment upon resales of art works, that applies in some jurisdictions. Whilst there are currently approximately 60 countries that have some sort of Resale Royalty on their statute books, evidence of resale schemes that can be said to be actually operating schemes is restricted to Europe, Australia and the American state of California. For example, in May 2011 the European commissions ec.europa webpage on Resale royalty stated that, under the heading &#x27;Indicative list of third countries (Article 7.2)&#x27; :
&#x27;A letter was sent to Member States on 1 March 2006 requesting that they provide a list of third countries which meet these requirements and that they also provide evidence of application. To date the commission has not been supplied with evidence for any third country which demonstrates that they qualify for inclusion on this list.&#x27; [The emphasis is from the European commission web page.]

Apart from placing a levy on the resale of some art-like objects, there are few common facets to the various national schemes. Most schemes prescribe a minimum amount that the artwork must receive before the artist can invoke resale rights (usually the hammer price or price). Some countries prescribe and others such as Australia, do not prescribe, the maximum royalty that can be received. Most do prescribe the calculation basis of the royalty. Some country&#x27;s make the usage of the royalty compulsory. Some country&#x27;s prescribe a sole monopoly collection service agency, while others like the UK and France, allow multiple agencies. Some schemes involve varying degrees of retrospective application and other schemes such as Australia&#x27;s are not retrospective at all.
In some cases, for example Germany, an openly tax-like use is made of the &quot;royalties&quot;; Half of the money collected is redistributed to fund public programs.

The New Zealand and Canadian governments have not proceeded with any sort of artist resale scheme. The Australian scheme does not apply to the first resale of artworks purchased prior to the schemes enactment( June 2010) and individual usage of the right (by Australian artists) is not compulsory. In Australia artists have a case by case right (under clause 22/23 of the Act) to refuse consent to the usage of the right by the appointed collection society and/or make their own collection arrangements. Details of the Australian scheme can be gotten from the website of the sole appointed Australian agency; The &quot;Copyright Agency Limited&quot;.

The UK scheme is in the context of common-law countries an oddity; No other common-law country has mandated an individual economic right where actual usage of the right is compulsory for the individual right holder. Whether the common law conception of an individual economic right as an &quot;individual right of control of usage&quot; is compatible with the Code Civil origins of &quot;droit de suite&quot; is open to question.

The UK is the largest art resale market where a form of ARR is operating, details of how the royalty is calculated as a portion of sale price in the UK can be accessed here DACS 
In the UK, the scheme was, in early 2012, extended to all artists still in copyright. In most European jurisdictions the right has the same duration as the term of copyright. In California law, heirs receive royalty for 20 years.

The royalty applies to any work of graphic or plastic art such as a ceramic, collage, drawing, engraving, glassware, lithograph, painting, photograph, picture, print, sculpture, tapestry. However, a copy of a work is not to be regarded as a work unless the copy is one of a limited number made by the artist or under the artist&#x27;s authority. In the UK the resale of a work bought directly from the artist and then resold within 3 years for a value of €10,000 or less is not affected by the royalty.

The situation as to how ARR applies in situations where an art work is physically made by a person or persons who are not the &#x27;name artist&#x27; who first exhibits and sells the work is not clear. In particular whilst ARR is inalienable it seems conceivable that in cases where the copyright on an artwork is transferred/sold, prior to the first sale of an artwork, the inalienable ARR right is also effectively sold transferred.

Whether resale royalties are of net economic benefit to artists is a highly contested area. Many economic studies have seriously questioned the assumptions underlying the argument that resale royalties have net benefits to artists. Many modelings have suggested that resale royalties could be actually harmful to living artists&#x27; economic positions.
Australia&#x27;s chief advocate for the adoption of artist resale royalties the collection society, Viscopy, commissioned in 2004 a report from Access Economics to model the likely impact of their scheme. In the resulting report, Access Economics warned that the claim of net benefit to artists was: &quot;based upon extremely unrealistic assumptions, in particular the assumption that seller and buyer behaviour would be completely unaffected by the introduction of RRR [ARR]&quot; and that, &quot;Access Economics considers that the results of this analysis are both unhelpful and potentially misleading.&quot;

==Software royalties==
There is simply too much computer software to consider the royalties applicable to each. The following is a guide to royalty rates:
*Computer Software: 10.5% (average), 6.8% (median)
*Internet: 11.7% (average), 7.5% (median)

For the development of customer-specific software one will have to consider:
* Total software development cost
* Break-even cost (if the software can be sold to many agencies)
* Ownership of code (if the client&#x27;s, he bears the development cost)
* Life of the software (usually short or requiring maintenance)
* Risk in development (high, commanding A high price)

==Other royalty arrangements==
The term &quot;royalty&quot; also covers areas outside of IP and technology licensing, such as oil, gas, and mineral royalties paid to the owner of a property by a resources development company in exchange for the right to exploit the resource. In a business project the promoter, financier, LHS enabled the transaction but are no longer actively interested may have a royalty right to a portion of the income, or profits, of the business. This sort of royalty is often expressed as a contract right to receive money based on a royalty formula, rather than an actual ownership interest in the business. In some businesses this sort of royalty is sometimes called an &quot;override&quot;.

===Alliances and partnerships===
Royalties may exist in technological alliances and partnerships. The latter is more than mere access to secret technical or a trade right to accomplish an objective. It is, in the last decade of the past century, and the first of this one of the major means of technology transfer. Its importance for the licensor and the licensee lies in its access to markets and raw materials, and labor, when the international trend is towards globalization.

There are three main groups when it comes to technological alliances. They are Joint-ventures (sometimes abbreviated JV), the Franchises and Strategic Alliances (SA).

* Joint-ventures are usually between companies long in contact with a purpose. JVs are very formal forms of association, and depending on the country where they are situated, subject to a rigid code of rules, in which the public may or may not have an opportunity to participate in capital; partly depending on the size of capital required, and partly on Governmental regulations. They usually revolve around products and normally involve an inventive step.
* Franchises revolve around &quot;services&quot; and they are closely connected with trademarks, an example of which is McDonald&#x27;s. Although franchises have no convention like trademarks or copyrights they can be mistaken as a trademark-copyright in agreements. The franchisor has close control over the franchisee, which, in legal terms cannot be tie-ins such as frachisee located in an areas owned by the franchisor.
* Strategic Alliances can involve a project (such as bridge building). a product or a service. As the name implies, is more a matter of &#x27;marriage of convenience&#x27; when two parties want to associate to take up a particular (but modest) short-term task but generally are uncomfortable with the other. But the strategic alliance could be a test of compatibility for the forming of a joint venture company and a precedent step.

Note that all of these ventures s could be in a third county. JVs and franchises are rarely found formed within a county. They largely involve third countries.

On occasion, a JV or SA may be wholly oriented to research and development, typically involving multiple organizations working on an agreed form of engagement. The Airbus is an example of such.

====Technical assistance and service in technology transfer====
Firms in developing countries often are asked by the supplier of know-how or patent licensing to consider technical service (TS) and technical assistance (TA) as elements of the technology transfer process and to pay &quot;royalty&quot; on them. TS and TA are associated with the IP (intellectual property) transferred – and, sometimes, dependent on its acquisition – but they are, by no means, IP. TA and TS may also be the sole part of the transfer or the transferor of the IP, their concurrent supplier. They are seldom met with in the developed countries, which sometimes view even know-how as similar to TS.

TS comprises services which are the specialized knowledge of firms or acquired by them for operating a special process. It is often a &quot;bundle&quot; of services which can by itself meet an objective or help in meeting it. It is delivered over time, at end of which the acquirer becomes proficient to be independent of the service. In this process, no consideration is given on whether the transfer of the proprietary element has been concluded or not.

On the other hand, technical assistance is a package of assistance given on a short timetable. It can range variously from procurement of equipment for a project, inspection services on behalf of the buyer, the training of buyer&#x27;s personnel and the supply technical or managerial staff. Again, TA is independent of IP services.

The payment for these services is a fee, not a royalty. The TS fee is dependent on how many of the specialized staff of its supplier are required and over what period of time. Sometimes, the &quot;learning&quot; capacity to whom the TS is supplied is involved. In any case, the cost per service-hour should be calculated and evaluated. Note that in selecting a TS supplier (often the IP supplier), experience and dependency are critical.

In the case of TA there is usually a plurality of firms and choice is feasible.

==Approaches to royalty rate==

===Intellectual property===

The rate of royalty applied in a given case is determined by various factors, the most notable of which are:

:* Market drivers and demand structure
:* Territorial extent of rights
:* Exclusivity of rights
:* Level of innovation and stage of development (see The Technology Life Cycle)
:* Sustainability of the technology
:* Degree and competitive availability of other technologies
:* Inherent risk
:* Strategic need
:* The portfolio of rights negotiated
:* Fundability
:* Deal-reward structure (negotiation strength)

To correctly gauge royalty rates, the following criteria must be taken into consideration:

:* The transaction is at &quot;arms-length&quot;
:* There is a willing buyer and a willing seller
:* The transaction is not under compulsion

===Rate determination and illustrative royalties===

There are three general approaches to assess the applicable royalty rate in the licensing of intellectual property. They are

# The Cost Approach
# The Comparable Market Approach
# The Income Approach

For a fair evaluation of the royalty rate, the relationship of the parties to the contract should:

:– be at &quot;arms-length&quot; (related parties such as the subsidiary and the parent company need to transact as though they were independent parties)
:– be viewed as acting free and without compulsion

====Cost approach====
The Cost Approach considers the several elements of cost that may have been entered to create the intellectual property and to seek a royalty rate that will recapture the expense of its development and obtain a return that is commensurate with its expected life. Costs considered could include R&amp;D expenditures, pilot-plant and test-marketing costs, technology upgrading expenses, patent application expenditure and the like.

The method has limited utility since the technology is not priced competitively on &quot;what the market can bear&quot; principles or in the context of the price of similar technologies. More importantly, by lacking optimization (through additional expense), it may earn benefits below its potential.

However, the method may be appropriate when a technology is licensed out during its R&amp;D phase as happens with venture capital investments or it is licensed out during one of the stages of clinical trials of a pharmaceutical.

In the former case, the venture capitalist obtains an equity position in the company (developing the technology) in exchange for financing a part of the development cost (recovering it, and obtaining an appropriate margin, when the company gets acquired or it goes public through the IPO route).

Recovery of costs, with opportunity of gain, is also feasible when development can be followed stage-wise as shown below for a pharmaceutical undergoing clinical trials (the licensee pays higher royalties for the product as it moves through the normal stages of its development):

A similar approach is used when custom software is licensed (an in-license, i.e. an incoming license). The product is accepted on a royalty schedule depending on the software meeting set stage-wise specifications with acceptable error levels in performance tests.

====Comparable market approach====
Here the cost and the risk of development are disregarded. The royalty rate is determined from comparing competing or similar technologies in an industry, modified by considerations of useful &quot;remaining life&quot; of the technology in that industry and contracting elements such as exclusivity provisions, front-end royalties, field of use restrictions, geographic limitations and the &quot;technology bundle&quot; (the mix of patents, know-how, trade-mark rights, etc.) accompanying it. Economist J. Gregory Sidak explains that comparable licenses, when selected correctly, &quot;reveal what the licensor and the licensee consider to be fair compensation for the use of the patented technology&quot; and thus &quot;will most accurately depict the price that a licensee would willingly pay for that technology.&quot; The Federal Circuit has on numerous occasions confirmed that the comparable market approach is a reliable methodology to calculate a reasonable royalty.

Although widely used, the prime difficulty with this method is obtaining access to data on comparable technologies and the terms of the agreements that incorporate them. Fortunately, there are several recognized organizations (see &quot;Royalty Rate Websites&quot; listed at the end of this article) who have comprehensive information on both royalty rates and the principal terms of the agreements of which they are a part. There are also IP-related organizations, such as the Licensing Executives Society, which enable its members to access and share privately assembled data.

The two tables shown below are drawn, selectively, from information that is available with an IP-related organization and on-line. The first depicts the range and distribution of royalty rates in agreements. The second shows the royalty rate ranges in select technology sectors (latter data sourced from: Dan McGavock of IPC Group, Chicago, USA).


Commercial sources also provide information that is invaluable for making comparisons. The following table provides typical information that is obtainable, for instance, from Royaltystat:

The comparability between transactions requires a comparison of the significant economic conditions that may affect the contracting parties:
* Similarity of geographies
* Relevant date
* Same industry
* Market size and its economic development;
* Contracting or expanding markets
* Market activity: whether wholesale, retail, other
* Relative market shares of contracting entities
* Location-specific costs of production and distribution
* Competitive environment in each geography
* Fair alternatives to contracting parties

====Income approach====
The Income approach focuses on the licensor estimating the profits generated by the licensee and obtaining an appropriate share of the generated profit. It is unrelated to costs of technology development or the costs of competing technologies.

The approach requires the licensee (or licensor): (a) to generate a cash-flow projection of incomes and expenses over the life-span of the license under an agreed scenario of incomes and costs (b) determining the Net Present Value, NPV of the profit stream, based on a selected discount factor, and c) negotiating the division of such profit between the licensor and the licensee.

The NPV of a future income is always lower than its current value because an income in the future is attended by risk. In other words, an income in the future needs to be discounted, in some manner, to obtain its present equivalent. The factor by which a future income is reduced is known as the &#x27;discount rate&#x27;. Thus, $1.00 received a year from now is worth $0.9091 at a 10% discount rate, and its discounted value will be still lower two years down the line.

The actual discount factor used depends on the risk assumed by the principal gainer in the transaction. For instance, a mature technology worked in different geographies, will carry a lower risk of non-performance (thus, a lower discount rate) than a technology being applied for the first time. A similar situation arises when there is the option of working the technology in one of two different regions; the risk elements in each region would be different.

The method is treated in greater detail, using illustrative data, in Royalty Assessment.

The licensor&#x27;s share of the income is usually set by the &quot;25% rule of thumb&quot;, which is said to be even used by tax authorities in the US and Europe for arms-length transactions. The share is on the operating profit of the licensee firm. Even where such division is held contentious, the rule can still be the starting point of negotiations.

Following are three aspects that are important for the profit:

:(a) the profit that accrues to the licensee may not arise solely through the engine of the technology. There are returns from the mix of assets it employs such as fixed and working capital and the returns from intangible assets such as distribution systems, trained workforce, etc. Allowances need to be made for them.

:(b) profits are also generated by thrusts in the general economy, gains from infrastructure, and the basket of licensed rights – patents, trademark, know-how. A lower royalty rate may apply in an advanced country where large market volumes can be commanded, or where protection to the technology is more secure than in an emerging economy (or perhaps, for other reasons, the inverse).

:(c) the royalty rate is only one aspect of the negotiation. Contractual provisions such as an exclusive license, rights to sub-license, warranties on the performance of technology etc may enhance the advantages to the licensee, which is not compensated by the 25% metric.

The basic advantage of this approach, which is perhaps the most widely applied, is that the royalty rate can be negotiated without comparative data on how other agreements have been transacted. In fact, it is almost ideal for a case where precedent does not exist.

It is, perhaps, relevant to note that the IRS also uses these three methods, in modified form, to assess the attributable income, or division of income, from a royalty-based transaction between a US company and its foreign subsidiary (since US law requires that a foreign subsidiary pay an appropriate royalty to the parent company).

===Other compensation modes===
Royalties are only one among many ways of compensating owners for use of an asset. Others include:
:*buying the asset outright, possibly with a leaseback arrangement
:*offering the licensor an equity position in the licensee company
:*staged milestone payments (as in drug development and commissioned software arrangements)
:*lump sum payment made to the licensor in one or more installments
:*cross-licensing agreements with or without cash payments, and
:*entering into a strategic alliance or Joint Venture.

In discussing the licensing of Intellectual Property, the terms &quot;valuation&quot; and &quot;evaluation&quot; need to be understood in their rigorous terms.
Evaluation is the process of assessing a license in terms of the specific metrics of a particular negotiation, which may include its circumstances, the geographical spread of licensed rights, product range, market width, licensee competitiveness, growth prospects, etc.

On the other hand, valuation is the fair market value (FMV) of the asset – trademark, patent or know-how – at which it can be sold between a willing buyer and willing seller in the context of best awareness of circumstances. The FMV of the IP, where assessable, may itself be a metric for evaluation.

If an emerging company is listed on the stock market, the market value of its intellectual property can be estimated from the data of the balance sheet using the equivalence:

Market Capitalization = Net Working capital + Net Fixed assets + Routine Intangible assets + IP

where the IP is the residual after deducting the other components from the market valuation of the stock. One of the most significant intangibles may be the work-force.

The method may be quite useful for valuing trademarks of a listed company if it is mainly or the only IP in play (franchising companies).

<doc id="305569" wikidata="Q1096967" url="?curid=305569" title="Claude McKay">
<text>Festus Claudius &quot;Claude&quot; McKay OJ (September 15, 1890 – May 22, 1948) was a Jamaican-American writer and poet. He was a central figure in the Harlem Renaissance.

Born in Jamaica, McKay first travelled to the United States to attend college, and encountered W. E. B. Du Bois&#x27;s &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot; which stimulated McKay&#x27;s interest in political involvement. He moved to New York City in 1914 and, in 1919, he wrote &quot;If We Must Die&quot;, one of his best known works, a widely reprinted sonnet responding to the wave of white-on-black race riots and lynchings following the conclusion of the First World War.

McKay also wrote five novels, &quot;Home to Harlem&quot; (1928), a best-seller that won the Harmon Gold Award for Literature, &quot;Banjo&quot; (1929), &quot;Banana Bottom&quot; (1933), &quot;Harlem Glory&quot; (written in 1938-1940, published in 1990), &quot;Amiable With Big Teeth: A Novel of the Love Affair Between the Communists and the Poor Black Sheep of Harlem&quot; (written in 1941, published in 2017), and a novella, &quot;Romance in Marseille&quot; (written in 1933, published in 2020).

Besides these novels and four published collections of poetry, McKay also authored a collection of short stories, &quot;Gingertown&quot; (1932); two autobiographical books, &quot;A Long Way from Home&quot; (1937) and &quot;My Green Hills of Jamaica&quot; (published posthumously in 1979); and &quot;Harlem: Negro Metropolis&quot; (1940), consisting of eleven essays on the contemporary social and political history of Harlem and Manhattan, concerned especially with political, social and labor organizing. His 1922 poetry collection, &quot;Harlem Shadows&quot;, was among the first books published during the Harlem Renaissance and his novel &quot;Home To Harlem&quot; was a watershed contribution to its fiction. His &quot;Selected Poems&quot; was published posthumously, in 1953. His &quot;Complete Poems&quot; (2004) includes almost ninety pages of poetry written between 1923 and the late 1940s, most of it previously unpublished, a crucial addition to his poetic oeuvre.

McKay was introduced to British Fabian socialism in his teens by his elder brother and tutor Uriah Theodore, and after moving to the United States in his early 20s encountered the American socialist left in the work of W. E. B. Du Bois and through his membership in the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) — the only American left-labor organization of the era that was totally open to Negro members (as he comments), continuing the tradition of the populist People&#x27;s Party of the previous generation. In the course of the teens he became acquainted with the writings of Marx and the programs of a variety of activists. As a co-editor of &quot;The Liberator&quot; magazine, he came into conflict with its hard-line Leninist doctrinaire editor Mike Gold, a contention which contributed to his leaving the magazine. In 1922–1923, he traveled to the Soviet Union to attend a Congress of the International, there encountering his friend &quot;Liberator&quot; publisher Max Eastman, a delegate to the Congress. In Russia, McKay was widely feted by the Communist Party. While there, he worked with a Russian writer to produce two books which were published in Russian, &quot;The Negroes of America&quot; (1923), a critical examination of American black-white racism from a Marxist class-conflict perspective, and &quot;Trial By Lynching&quot; (1925); translations of these books back into English appeared in 1979 and 1977 respectively; McKay&#x27;s original English texts are apparently lost. In the Soviet Union, McKay eventually concluded that, as he says of a character in &quot;Harlem Glory,&quot; he &quot;saw what he was shown.&quot; Realizing that he was being manipulated and used by the Party apparatus, and responding critically to the authoritarian bent of the Soviet regime, he left for Western Europe in 1923, first for Hamburg, then Paris, then the South of France, Barcelona and Morocco.

After his return to Harlem in 1934, he found himself in frequent contention with the Stalinist New York City Communist Party which sought to dominate the left politics and writing community of the decade. His prose masterpiece, &quot;A Long Way From Home&quot;, was attacked in the New York City press on doctrinaire Stalinist grounds. This conflict is reflected in &quot;Harlem: Negro Metropolis&quot; and satirized in &quot;Amiable With Big Teeth.&quot; His sonnet sequence, &quot;The Cycle,&quot; published posthumously in the &quot;Complete Poems,&quot; deals at length with McKay&#x27;s confrontation with the left political machine of the time. Increasingly ill in the mid-40s, he was rescued from extremely impoverished circumstances by a Catholic Worker friend and installed in a communal living situation; later in the decade, he converted to Catholicism and died in 1948.

== Biography ==

===Early life in Jamaica ===
Festus Claudius McKay, known as Claude McKay, was born September 15, 1890, in Nairne Castle near James Hill in upper Clarendon Parish, Jamaica. He referred to his home village as Sunny Ville, a name given to the area by locals. He was the youngest child of Thomas Francis McKay and Hannah Ann Elizabeth Edwards, well-to-do farmers who had enough property to qualify to vote. He had seven siblings. McKay&#x27;s parents were active and well-respected members of the Baptist faith. Thomas was a strict, religious man who struggled to develop close relationships with his children due to his serious nature. In contrast, Hannah had a warmth that allowed her to give love freely to all of her children. Thomas was of Ashanti descent, while Hannah traced her ancestry to Madagascar. Claude recounted that his father would often share stories of Ashanti customs with the family.

At the age of four, McKay went to school at Mt. Zion Church. Around the age of nine, he was sent to live with his oldest brother, Uriah Theodore, also known as Theo, a teacher, to be given a proper education. His brother was also an amateur journalist. Due to his brother&#x27;s influence, McKay became an avid reader of classical and British literature, as well as philosophy, science, and theology. In his free time, he would read poems, including Shakespeare. He started writing poetry of his own at the age of 10.

As a teenager in 1906, he became apprenticed to a carriage and cabinet maker known as Old Brenda, maintaining his apprenticeship for about two years. During that time, in 1907, McKay met Walter Jekyll, a philosopher and folklorist, who became a mentor and an inspiration for him, who also encouraged him to concentrate on his writing. Jekyll convinced McKay to write in his native dialect, and set some of McKay&#x27;s verses to music. Jekyll helped McKay publish his first book of poems, &quot;Songs of Jamaica&quot;, in 1912. They were the first poems published in Jamaican Patois, a dialect of mainly English words and Twi (Ghanaian language) structure. McKay&#x27;s next volume, &quot;Constab Ballads&quot; (1912), was based on his experiences of joining the constabulary for a brief period in 1911.

In the poem &quot;The Tropics in New York&quot;, McKay reminisced about the Caribbean. The poem is set in New York and was written while McKay lived there as a laborer. The fruits he sees in New York make the speaker of the poem long for Jamaica, and thus Caribbean fruits are imagined as part of the New York cityscape. The colors of the fruit remind him of the colors and diversity in his native island and &quot;hungry for old familiar ways / a wave of longing through my body wept&quot;.

===First stay in the US===
McKay left for the US in 1912 to attend Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University). He was shocked by the intense racism he encountered when he arrived in Charleston, South Carolina, where many public facilities were segregated; this inspired him to write more poetry. At Tuskegee, he disliked the &quot;semi-military, machine-like existence&quot; and quickly left to study at Kansas State Agricultural College (now Kansas State University). At Kansas State, he read W. E. B. Du Bois&#x27; &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot;, which had a major impact on him and stirred his political involvement. Despite his superior academic performance, in 1914, he decided he did not want to be an agronomist and moved to New York City, where he married his childhood sweetheart Eulalie Imelda Lewars. However, after only six months of marriage, his wife returned to Jamaica, where their daughter Ruth was born. McKay would never meet his daughter. As detailed in the Chronology of Gene Andrew Jarrett&#x27;s 2007 edition of &quot;A Long Way From Home,&quot; during this period (1914-1919) McKay first managed a Brooklyn restaurant, which failed, next worked as a waiter at a hotel in Hanover, New Hampshire, then at a Manhattan women&#x27;s club, and longest and most happily as a waiter on the Pennsylvania Railroad.

McKay published two poems in 1917 in &quot;The Seven Arts&quot; under the pseudonym Eli Edwards. In 1918 McKay met Frank Harris, then editor of &quot;Pearson&#x27;s Magazine.&quot; His avowal of writerly integrity had a lifelong effect for McKay, as he relates in his memoir, &quot;A Long Way From Home&quot;. Harris featured four poems and a short prose piece about his biography and poetics, in the September 1918 issue of the magazine, McKay&#x27;s first prominent appearance in print. In 1919, McKay met Crystal and Max Eastman, publishers of &quot;The Liberator&quot; magazine, where McKay would serve as co-executive editor until 1922. As co-editor of &quot;The Liberator&quot;, he published one of his most famous poems, &quot;If We Must Die&quot;, during the &quot;Red Summer&quot;, a period of intense racial violence against black people in Anglo-American societies.

In this period McKay joined the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). He also became involved with a group of black radicals who were unhappy both with Marcus Garvey&#x27;s nationalism and the middle-class reformist NAACP. These included other Caribbean writers such as Cyril Briggs, Richard B. Moore, and Wilfred Domingo. They fought for black self-determination within the context of socialist revolution. Together they founded a semi-secret revolutionary organization, the African Blood Brotherhood. Hubert Harrison had asked McKay to write for Garvey&#x27;s &quot;Negro World&quot;, but only a few copies of the paper have survived from this period, none of which contain any articles by McKay. In early fall 1919 McKay traveled to London, perhaps prompted by pressure from the Justice Department which was engaged in a nationwide attack on pacifists, socialists and labor organizers (the &quot;Palmer Raids&quot;) which especially targeted the IWW.

===Sojourn in the United Kingdom===
In London, McKay moved in socialist and literary circles; he frequented two clubs, a soldiers&#x27; club in Drury Lane, and the International Socialist Club in Shoreditch. A militant atheist, he also joined the Rationalist Press Association, who had published two of Walter Jekyll&#x27;s books. It was during this period that his commitment to socialism deepened and he read Marx assiduously. At the International Socialist Club, McKay met Shapurji Saklatvala, A. J. Cook, Guy Aldred, Jack Tanner, Arthur McManus, William Gallacher, Sylvia Pankhurst, and George Lansbury. McKay was soon invited to write for Pankhurst&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Workers&#x27; Dreadnought&quot;.

In April 1920, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, a socialist paper published by George Lansbury, included a racist article written by E. D. Morel. Entitled &quot;Black Scourge in Europe: Sexual Horror Let Loose by France on the Rhine&quot;, it insinuated gross hypersexuality in black people in general. Lansbury refused to print McKay&#x27;s response, so McKay did so in &quot;Workers&#x27; Dreadnought&quot;, writing:

Why this obscene maniacal outburst about the sex vitality of black men in a proletarian paper? Rape is rape; the colour of the skin doesn&#x27;t make it different. Negroes are no more over-sexed than Caucasians; mulatto children in the West Indies and America were not the result of parthenogenesis. If Negro troops had syphilis, they contracted it from the white and yellow races. As for German women, in their economic plight, they were selling themselves to anyone. I do not protest because I happen to be a Negro... I write because I feel that the ultimate result of your propaganda will be further strife and blood-spilling between whites and the many members of my race... who have been dumped down on the English docks since the ending of the European war... Bourbons of the United States will thank you, and the proletarian underworld of London will certainly gloat over the scoop of the Christian-Socialist pacifist &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.

Since January 1920, McKay had been involved with the &quot;Workers&#x27; Dreadnought&quot; and the Workers&#x27; Socialist Federation, a council communist group active in the East End with a majority of women at all levels of the organization. He became a paid journalist for the paper. He worked closely with the Finnish Bolshevik Erkki Veltheim. He attended the Communist Unity Conference that established the Communist Party of Great Britain. At this time he also had some of his poetry published in the &quot;Cambridge Magazine&quot;, edited by C. K. Ogden.

When Sylvia Pankhurst was arrested under the Defence of the Realm Act for publishing articles &quot;calculated and likely to cause sedition among His Majesty&#x27;s forces, in the Navy, and among the civilian population,&quot; McKay had his rooms searched. He is likely to have been the author of &quot;The Yellow Peril and the Dockers&quot; attributed to &quot;Leon Lopez&quot;, which was one of the articles cited by the government in its case against &quot;Workers&#x27; Dreadnought&quot;.
===Trip to Russia===

McKay was invited to Russia during the reconstruction of the country by the Communist Party led by Lenin. In November 1922, in what he referred to as his &quot;Magic Pilgrimage,&quot; he traveled to Russia to participate in the Fourth Congress of the Communist International in Petrograd and Moscow, where he encountered Max Eastman who was also a delegate. McKay financed his trip to Russia by repackaging and selling &quot;Harlem Shadows&quot;, &quot;complete with a signed photograph and an inflated price tag&quot; to members of an NAACP donor list and conserved the funds thus raised by working his way across the Atlantic from New York to Liverpool as a stoker on a freighter. He was greeted in Russia with what one historian characterized as &quot;ecstatic welcome&quot; and &quot;rock-star treatment.&quot;

===Later travels===
McKay wrote about his travels in Morocco in his 1937 autobiography &quot;A Long Way from Home.&quot; Before this journey, he went to Paris, where he contracted a severe respiratory infection and required hospitalization. After recovering he continued traveling, and for 11 years ventured around Europe and parts of Northern Africa. During this stint he published three novels, the most notable of which was &quot;Home to Harlem&quot;, in 1928. Reception to the novel varied. In &quot;The Negro Novel in America&quot;, Robert Bone wrote that it represented &quot;different ways of rebelling against Western civilization&quot;, adding that McKay was not entirely successful in articulating his protagonists. However, other people thought that the novel provided a detailed portrayal of the underside of black urban life, with its prostitutes and gamblers.

He also wrote &quot;Banana Bottom&quot; during this 11-year span. Here McKay presented a clear depiction of his principal theme, that black individuals quest for cultural identity in a white society. His final year abroad saw the creation of &quot;Gingertown&quot;, a collection of 12 short stories. Half of these tales depict his life in Harlem and the others revolve around his time in Jamaica.

===Later life===
McKay became an American citizen in 1940. In 1943 McKay started &quot;Cycle Manuscript&quot;, a collection of 54 poems, all but four of them sonnets, often with political subjects and often in tones of satiric invective. After the manuscript was rejected by Harper and Dutton, he wrote to his old friend and editor Max Eastman, asking him &quot;to look through&quot; all the poems and to make any needed revisions. Despite Eastman&#x27;s efforts, McKay&#x27;s collection was not published during his lifetime. It is included in his posthumous &quot;Complete Poems&quot;. Its editor William J. Maxwell discusses this manuscript&#x27;s history in an extended note. In the mid-40s McKay began to associate with Catholic cultural activists and studied Catholic social theory, first in New York City and then in Chicago where he moved in April 1944; he was baptized there in October 1944. Before his conversion, he had written to Max Eastman, about &quot;doing a lot of reading and research, especially on Catholic work among Negroes—Because if and when I take the step I want to be intellectually honest and sincere about it&quot;. (McKay to Eastman, June 1, 1944). Five months after his baptism, he wrote Eastman to assure him that &quot;I am not less the fighter.&quot; (McKay to Eastman, October 16, 1944, Rpt. in Passion 305). In 1946, advised to seek a better climate for his health, he moved first to Albuquerque and then to San Francisco, before returning to Chicago in 1947.

On May 22, 1948, he died from a heart attack in Chicago at the age of 57 and was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Queens, New York.

==Literary movements and traditions==
McKay flourished as a poet during the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s. During this time, his poems challenged white authority while celebrating Jamaican culture. He also wrote tales about the trials and tribulations of life as a black man in both Jamaica and America. McKay was not secretive about his hatred for racism, and felt that racist people were stupid, shortsighted, and possessed with hatred. In tales such as &quot;Home to Harlem&quot; (1928), his depictions were initially criticized as a negative portrayal of Harlem and its lower-class citizens by prominent figures such as W. E. B. DuBois, but McKay was later applauded as a literary force in the Harlem Renaissance.

Among his works that challenged racial discrimination is the poem &quot;If We Must Die&quot; (1919), a call for his people to fight with determination and courage against those who would murder them.

McKay divested himself from many aspects and growing prescriptions of modernism. By the beginning of the 20th century, the sonnet form had become an antiquated poetic style, but McKay found it an ideal medium to convey his ideas. Many modernists, however, rejected and criticized his use of the sonnet. Despite their reaction, he persevered and created a significant number of modern sonnets.

Having spent time among the artists of Paris in the 1920s, he was intimately acquainted with the dynamics between painters and models and how modernist painters presented African subjects and African culture. In her article &quot;Caribbean Models for Modernism in the Work of Claude McKay and Jean Rhys&quot;, Leah Rosenberg writes: &quot;The fascination with African art and its identification with female sexuality was characteristic of modernist and avant-garde primitivism&quot;. The inclination to stereotype and caricature the African physical form created, however inadvertently, a form of hegemony reminiscent to McKay of the colonialism he grew up within Jamaica. &quot;Sexuality and black culture,&quot; Rosenberg explains, &quot;held a privileged place in modernist and avant-garde art from Picasso to Gertrude Stein&quot;. In need of money, McKay posed nude for the Cubist painter André Lhote. Through his experience, McKay saw first-hand how the larger social hegemony between European white supremacy and people of Afro-Caribbean descent could play itself out between the artist and its subject. McKay critically recalled the experience in various ways in many of his most notable works. In doing so, he shone a critical light on a cornerstone of modernism and once again pushed back against a system in which he found himself.

==Political views and social activism==
McKay joined the Industrial Workers of the World in autumn 1919 while working in a factory—following his time working as a dining-car waiter on the railways. McKay believed that the Communists in the US had other things on their agenda, which did not include African Americans. Furthermore, he thought that they were using the Negro race to fight their battles. During his visit to the Soviet Union he addressed the Third International in a speech titled &quot;Report on the Negro Question&quot; and argued that America was not fully accepting of the Negro Communists. After this speech, he was asked by the Communist Party in Russia to explore this idea more in the form of a book. He wrote &quot;Negry v Amerike&quot; in 1923. Originally in Russian, and it was not translated into English until 1979. McKay&#x27;s political and social views were made clear through his literary works. In his 1929 work, &quot;Banjo: a Story Without a Plot,&quot; McKay included poignant commentary on the Western prioritization of business over racial justice through the character Ray.

==Personal life==

===Sexuality===
McKay was bisexual; he pursued relationships with both men and women throughout his life. He never officially &quot;came out&quot; as it was considered a societal taboo or explicitly state his sexual preference, but over the years he appears to have frequented and enjoyed the &quot;clandestine&quot; homosexual communities of New York as well as relationships of intermediate duration with several women. According to his biographer, Wayne Cooper, Frank and Francine Budgen, whom he knew during his stay in London in 1920, remembered him as &quot;open&quot; about his sexuality and as &quot;not at all effeminate.&quot; Several of his poems suggest homosexual sentiments. In others, the gender of the speaker is not identified, which leaves to interpretation the nature of the relationships presented. Some suggest that there was a sexual component to McKay&#x27;s relationship with his mentor, Walter Jekyll, who was apparently homosexual but there is no evidence one way or the other. In the early 1920s McKay was intermittently involved with the English labor advocate and IWW organizer, poet, and translator Charles Ashleigh.

McKay&#x27;s sexuality is hinted at in some of his literary work. His 1929 novel &quot;Banjo: a Story without a Plot&quot;, for instance, contains a queer-coded ending. As all the other characters of the ensemble featured in this work make plans to depart, Banjo asks Ray (the two characters most central to the story) to go off separately together. In and of itself, this may not seem to indicate a romantic nature to their future relationship, but as Ray initially considers Banjo&#x27;s proposal to go off together, he recalls how much joy he associated with the dream of &quot;loafing after their labors long enough to laugh and love and jazz and fight.&quot;

===Last years and death===
In his final years, McKay largely abandoned secular ideologies in favor of Catholicism. He worked with Harlem&#x27;s Friendship House, a branch of the Catholic interracial apostolate founded in the early 1930s in Toronto, Canada. McKay relocated to Chicago, Illinois, where he joined a Catholic organization as a teacher. McKay developed health problems by the mid-1940s, enduring several illnesses until he died of heart failure in 1948.

==Works==
In 1928, Claude McKay published his most famous novel, &quot;Home to Harlem&quot;, which won the Harmon Gold Award for Literature. The novel, which depicted street life in Harlem, would have a major impact on black intellectuals in the Caribbean, West Africa, and Europe.

&quot;Home to Harlem&quot; gained a substantial readership, especially among people who wanted to know more about the intense, sometimes shocking, details of Harlem nightlife. His novel was an attempt to capture the energetic and intense spirit of the &quot;uprooted black vagabonds.&quot; In &quot;Home to Harlem,&quot; McKay looked among the common people for a black identity.

Despite this, the book drew fire from one of McKay&#x27;s contemporaries, W. E. B. Du Bois. To Du Bois, the novel&#x27;s frank depictions of sexuality and the nightlife in Harlem only appealed to the &quot;prurient demand[s]&quot; of white readers and publishers looking for portrayals of black &quot;licentiousness.&quot; As Du Bois said, &quot;&quot;Home to Harlem&quot;... for the most part nauseates me, and after the dirtier parts of its filth I feel distinctly like taking a bath.&quot; Modern critics now dismiss this criticism from Du Bois, who was more concerned with using art as propaganda in the struggle for African-American political liberation than in the value of art to showcase the truth about the lives of black people. &quot;Home to Harlem&quot; entered the public domain in the United States in 2024.

McKay&#x27;s other novels were &quot;Banjo&quot; (1929) and &quot;Banana Bottom&quot; (1933). &quot;Banjo&quot; includes a portrayal of how the French treated people from its sub-Saharan African colonies and centers on black seamen in Marseilles. Aimé Césaire stated that in &quot;Banjo&quot;, blacks were described truthfully and without &quot;inhibition or prejudice&quot;. &quot;Banana Bottom&quot;, McKay&#x27;s third novel, depicts a black individual in search of a cultural identity in a white society. The book discusses the underlying racial and cultural tensions.

McKay also authored a collection of short stories, &quot;Gingertown&quot; (1932), two autobiographical books, &quot;A Long Way from Home&quot; (1937) and &quot;My Green Hills of Jamaica&quot; (published posthumously in 1979), and a non-fiction, socio-historical treatise entitled &quot;Harlem: Negro Metropolis&quot; (1940). His &quot;Selected Poems&quot; (1953) represents his selection and arrangement of 1947, but he was unable to find a publisher for it and it appeared posthumously six years later. According to Amardeep Singh&#x27;s website, &quot;Claude McKay&#x27;s Early Poetry,&quot; it was originally published by Bookman &amp; Associates in 1953 with an introduction by John Dewey and subsequently reprinted by Harcourt Brace with the Dewey introduction replaced by a biographical note by Max Eastman.

==Legacy==
In 1977, the government of Jamaica named Claude McKay the national poet and posthumously awarded him the Order of Jamaica for his contribution to literature.

In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Claude McKay on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans. McKay is regarded as the &quot;foremost left-wing black intellectual of his age&quot; and his work heavily influenced a generation of black authors including James Baldwin and Richard Wright.

In 2015, a passageway in Marseilles was named after McKay.

Claude McKay&#x27;s poem &quot;If We Must Die&quot; was recited in the film &quot;August 28: A Day in the Life of a People&quot;, which debuted at the opening of the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of African American History and Culture in 2016.

===Unknown manuscript===
A previously unknown manuscript of a 1941 novel by McKay was authenticated in 2012. Entitled &quot;Amiable With Big Teeth: A Novel of the Love Affair Between the Communists and the Poor Black Sheep of Harlem&quot;, the manuscript was discovered in 2009 by Columbia graduate student Jean-Christophe Cloutier in the Samuel Roth Papers, a previously untouched university archive. The novel centers on the ideas and events that animated Harlem on the cusp of World War II, such as Benito Mussolini&#x27;s invasion of Ethiopia.

Professor Cloutier (now at the University of Pennsylvania) and his advisor Professor Brent Hayes Edwards successfully authenticated the manuscript, and have received permission from the McKay estate to publish the novel, a satire set in 1936, with an introduction about how it was found and its provenance verified.

It was published in February 2017.

<text>Phelsuma is a large genus of geckos in the family Gekkonidae. Species in the genus &quot;Phelsuma&quot; are commonly referred to as day geckos.

Some day geckos are seriously endangered and some are common, but all &quot;Phelsuma&quot; species are CITES Appendix II listed. Little is known about trade in day geckos, but the IUCN considers it a threat to some species. Some species are captive-bred.

==Taxonomy==
The genus itself is thought to have originated anywhere between the Late Cretaceous to the mid-Eocene (43 to 75 mya), as that is when its lineage is known to have diverged from the one containing the Namaqua day gecko (&quot;Rhoptropella&quot;), although it is unknown how closely related both genera are. The crown group containing all recent species is thought to have originated in the early Oligocene, about 30 million years ago, with the most basal of them being the isolated Andaman day gecko (&quot;P. andamanensis&quot;), which diverged from all other species shortly after the crown group originated. Most of the other divergence among species in areas of the Western Indian Ocean such as the Seychelles is thought to have occurred in the Neogene.

==Description==
In contrast to most other gecko species, day geckos of the genus &quot;Phelsuma&quot; are active mainly during the day. Other diurnal geckos include species of the genera &quot;Lygodactylus&quot; and &quot;Gonatodes&quot;. Like most other geckos, day geckos lack eyelids, instead having rounded pupils and a clear, fixed plate covering their eyes which they clean with their tongues. Many species have bright green, red, and blue colors which make them popular terrarium or vivarium pets. These brilliant colors play a role in intraspecies recognition and also serve as camouflage.

The total length (including tail) of the different &quot;Phelsuma&quot; species varies between about , but the extinct Rodrigues giant day gecko was even larger. Day geckos have toe pads consisting of tiny lamellae which allow them to walk on plain vertical and inverted surfaces like bamboo or glass. The inner toe on each foot is vestigial. Males have well-developed femoral pores on the undersurface of their rear limbs. These pores are less developed or absent in females. Females often have well-developed endolymphatic chalk sacs on the sides of their necks. These sacs store calcium, which is needed for egg production. Those eggs can often be seen through the ventral surface of the female&#x27;s body shortly before they are laid. The hatchlings reach sexual maturity between six and 12 months old. Smaller species may live up to 10 years, whereas the larger species have been reported to live more than 20 years in captivity.

==Distribution and habitat==
Day geckos inhabit the islands of the south-west part of the Indian Ocean. The exceptions are &quot;Phelsuma andamanense&quot;, which is endemic to the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal, and &quot;Phelsuma dubia&quot;, which is also found on the East Coast of mainland Africa, although it possibly was introduced there. Most &quot;Phelsumas&quot; species are found in Mauritius and Madagascar. Some species are found on neighboring island groups, including the Mascarenes, Seychelles, and Comoros. Due to human introduction, they are also often found on some of the Hawaiian Islands, including the Big Island, Maui and Kauai, and the state of Florida, where they were introduced as a form of pest control. The different &quot;Phelsuma&quot; species can be found from sea level up to 2,300 meters. Most day geckos are arboreal. They inhabit, amongst others, coconut palms and banana trees, but can also be found near human settlements, in gardens, on fences, houses, and huts. An exception, &quot;Phelsuma barbouri&quot;, is a terrestrial species.

==Diet==
Day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates in the wild. They also eat nectar, pollen, and occasionally soft, ripe and sweet fruits such as bananas.

In captivity, such a diet is simulated. Insects which may be used include: (wingless) fruit flies, various flies, wax moths, crickets, small super worms, small butter worms and mealworms. Fruit, which is required a few times a week, may be small pieces of papaya, banana, or other sweet fruit and also commercial gecko nectars.

In 2008 a BBC film crew took footage of a day gecko successfully begging a planthopper for honeydew.

== Etymology ==
The genus &quot;Phelsuma&quot; was first described in 1825 by the British zoologist John Edward Gray, who named it after the Dutch physician Murk van Phelsum.

==Classification==

The genus consists of about 70 known species and subspecies.

Two &quot;Phelsuma&quot; species (&quot;Phelsuma gigas&quot; and &quot;Phelsuma edwardnewtoni&quot;), both of which were endemic to the Mascarene island of Rodrigues, are now considered to be extinct, probably due to the destruction of their environments by human settlers and their domestic animals. Many day gecko species are endangered today for similar reasons: an increasing percentage of their natural habitat, especially tropical forest, is being destroyed by human activity.

<text>Zhiyi (; 538–597 CE) also called Zhizhe (智者) or Chen De&#x27;an (陳德安), was the fourth patriarch of the Tiantai tradition of Buddhism in China. His standard title was Śramaṇa Zhiyi (沙門智顗), linking him to the broad tradition of Indian asceticism. Zhiyi is famous for being the first in the history of Chinese Buddhism to elaborate a complete, critical and systematic classification of the Buddhist teachings. He is also regarded as the first major figure to make a significant break from the Indian tradition, to form an indigenous Chinese system.

According to David W. Chappell, Zhiyi &quot;has been ranked with Thomas Aquinas and al-Ghazali as one of the great systematizers of religious thought and practice in world history.&quot;

==Biography==
Born with the surname Chen () in Huarong District, Jing Prefecture (now Hubei), Zhiyi left home to become a monk at eighteen, after the loss of his parents and his hometown Jiangling that fell to the Western Wei army when Zhiyi was seventeen. At 23, he received his most important influences from his first teacher, Nanyue Huisi (515–577 CE), a meditation master who would later be listed as Zhiyi&#x27;s predecessor in the Tiantai lineage. After a period of study with Huisi (560–567), he spent some time working in the southern capital of Jiankang. Then in 575 he went to Tiantai mountain for intensive study and practice with a group of disciples. Here he worked on adapting the Indian meditation principles of śamatha and vipaśyanā (translated as &quot;zhi&quot; and &quot;guan&quot;) into a complex system of self-cultivation practice that incorporated the Traditional Indian Buddhist Ayurvedic medicine, Taoism and elements of worship from Chinese folk religions that particularly included devotional rituals and confession/repentance rites forming a Buddhist medical cultural system that was based on the theory of Traditional Chinese medicine specifically designed and tailored for the Chinese culture and society. Then in 585 he returned to Jinling, where he completed his monumental commentarial works on the Lotus Sutra, the Fahua wenzhu (587 CE), and the Fahua xuanyi (593 CE).

Chappell holds that Zhiyi: &quot;...provided a religious framework which seemed suited to adapt to other cultures, to evolve new practices, and to universalize Buddhism.&quot;

==Important works==
Zhiyi&#x27;s &quot;Xiao Zhiguan&quot; (; lit &quot;&quot;Small&quot; &quot;Treatise on Concentration and Insight&quot;) was probably the first practical manual of meditation in China. With its direct influence on the Tso-chan-i was very influential in the development of Chan meditation.

Rujun Wu identifies the Mohe Zhiguan (Traditional Chinese: 摩訶止觀; Simplified Chinese: 摩诃止观; pinyin: &quot;Móhē Zhǐguān&quot;; lit &quot;Great treatise on Concentration and Insight&quot;&quot;) of Zhiyi as the seminal text of the Tiantai school. Among Zhiyi&#x27;s many important works are the &quot;Liumiao Famen&quot;, , and . Of the works attributed to him (although many may have been written by his disciples), about thirty are extant.

== Teaching ==

=== View on śamatha-vipaśyanā ===

Zhiyi&#x27;s &quot;Xiao Zhiguan&quot; offers an exposition of the practice of śamatha (calming or cessation) and vipaśyanā (wise seeing or contemplation). Zhiyi&#x27;s &quot;Xiao Zhiguan&quot; states:There are many ways to enter the true reality of nirvana, but none that is more essential or that goes beyond the twofold method of cessation-and-contemplation. The reason is that &quot;cessation&quot; is the preliminary gate for overcoming the bonds [of passionate afflictions]; &quot;contemplation&quot; is the proper requisite for severing delusions. &quot;Cessation&quot; provides good nourishment for nurturing the mind; &quot;contemplation&quot; is the sublime technique for arousing spiritual understanding. &quot;Cessation&quot; is the preeminent cause for [attaining] dhyanic concentration; &quot;contemplation&quot; is the basis [for the accumulation of] of wisdom. If one perfects the twofold aspects of concentration (samadhi) and wisdom, then one is fully endowed with the aspects of both benefiting oneself and benefiting others.Zhiyi also notes that it’s necessary to have a balance between śamatha and vipaśyanā:It should be known that these two aspects are like the two wheels of a cart, or the two wings of a bird; if one side is cultivated disproportionately, then one falls prey to mistaken excess.

=== The Four Samadhis ===

Zhiyi developed a curriculum of practice which was distilled into the &#x27;Four Samadhis&#x27; (Chinese: 四種三昧; pinyin: sizhong sanmei). These Four Samadhi were expounded in Zhiyi&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Mohe Zhiguan&quot;&#x27;. The &quot;Mohe Zhiguan&quot; is the magnum opus of Zhiyi&#x27;s maturity and is held to be a &quot;grand summary&quot; of the Buddhist Tradition according to his experience and understanding at that time. The text of the &quot;Mohe Zhiguan&quot; was refined from lectures Zhiyi gave in 594 in the capital city of Jinling and was the sum of his experience at Mount Tiantai c.585 and inquiry thus far. Parsing the title, &#x27;zhi&#x27; refers to &quot;ch’an meditation and the concentrated and quiescent state attained thereby&quot; and &#x27;guan&#x27; refers to &quot;contemplation and the wisdom attained thereby&quot;. Swanson reports that Zhiyi held that there are two modes of zhi-guan: that of sitting in meditation 坐, and that of &quot;responding to objects in accordance with conditions&quot; 歷緣對境, which is further refined as abiding in the natural state of a calm and insightful mind under any and all activities and conditions.

Swanson states that Zhiyi in the &quot;Mohe Zhiguan&quot;:

...is critical of an unbalanced emphasis on &quot;meditation alone&quot;, portraying it as a possible &quot;extreme&quot; view and practice, and offering instead the binome zhi-guan 止觀 (calming/cessation and insight/contemplation, śamatha-vipaśyanā) as a more comprehensive term for Buddhist practice.
The &quot;Samadhi of One Practice&quot; (Skt. &quot;Ekavyūha Samādhi&quot;; Ch. 一行三昧) which is also known as the &quot;samadhi of oneness&quot; or the &quot;calmness in which one realizes that all dharmas are the same&quot; (&quot;Wing-tsit Chan&quot;), is one of the &quot;Four Samadhi&quot; that both refine, mark the passage to, and qualify the state of perfect enlightenment expounded in the &quot;Mohe Zhiguan&quot;. The term &quot;Samadhi of Oneness&quot; was subsequently used by Daoxin.

The Four Samadhis are:
*&quot;Constantly Seated Samādhi&quot; (&quot;chángzuò sānmèi&quot; 常坐三昧) - 90 days of motionless sitting, leaving the seat only for reasons of natural need.
*&quot;Constantly Walking Samādhi&quot; (&quot;chángxíng sānmèi&quot; 常行三昧) - 90 days of mindful walking and meditating on Amitabha.
*&quot;Half-Walking Half-Seated Samādhi&quot; (&quot;bànxíng bànzuò sānmèi&quot; 半行半坐三昧) - Includes various practices such as chanting, contemplation of the emptiness of all dharmas and the &quot;Lotus samādhi&quot; which includes penance, prayer, worship of the Buddhas, and reciting the Lotus sutra. 
*&quot;Neither Walking nor Sitting Samādhi&quot; (&quot;fēixíng fēizuò sānmèi&quot; 非行非坐三昧) - This includes &quot;the awareness of mental factors&quot; as they arise in the mind. One is to contemplate them as &quot;not moving, not originated, not extinguished, not coming, not going&quot;.

=== The Five Periods and Eight Teachings ===
In order to provide a comprehensive framework for Buddhist doctrine, Zhiyi classified the various Buddhist sutras into the Five Periods and Eight Teachings (). These were also known as &quot;goji hakkyō&quot; in Japanese and &quot;osi palgyo&quot; (오시팔교) in Korean. According to Zhiyi, the five periods of the Buddha&#x27;s teachings were as follows:

# The Flower Garland period – taught immediately after the Buddha attained Enlightenment, lasting 3 weeks. The teachings at this time were incomprehensible to all but advanced bodhisattvas, and thus Shakyamuni Buddha started over with more basic (the Agama) teachings.
# The Agama Period – taught at Deer Park, and lasting 12 years. These consisted of the most elementary teachings of the Buddha including karma, rebirth, the Four Noble Truths, etc.
# The Correct and Equal Period – lasting 8 years. This marks the Buddha&#x27;s teachings that begin to transition from so-called &quot;Hinayana&quot; teachings to Mahayana ones.
# The Wisdom Period – lasting 22 years. The teachings here consist of the Perfection of Wisdom teachings among others. Here, the teachings were intended to demonstrate that the classifications of Hinayana and Mahayana were expedient only, and that were ultimately empty.
# The Lotus and Nirvana Period – lasting 8 years. The teachings of this final period mark the most &quot;perfect&quot; teachings, namely the Lotus Sutra and the Mahayana Nirvana Sutra, which encompass the Buddha&#x27;s original intention.

These were compared in order to the five stages of milk: fresh milk, cream, curds, butter and ghee (clarified butter).

Further. the teachings of the Buddha were organized into four types based on the capacity of listener:
* Sudden teachings
* Gradual teachings
* Indeterminate teachings
* Secret or &quot;esoteric&quot; teachings.

and four types of sources:
* Hinayana
* Mahayana
* Teachings found in both
* Teachings that transcend both (e.g. Lotus Sutra)

Together these were the Eight Teachings of the Buddha attributed to Zhiyi.

=== Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment ===
Zhiyi taught the principle of Three Thousand Realms in a Single Thought Moment (Chinese: ; Pinyin: &quot;Yīniàn Sānqiān&quot;) in his &#x27;Great Concentration and Insight&#x27;, based on the Lotus Sutra. The number &#x27;Three Thousand&#x27; is derived from the Ten Worlds, multiplied by ten [because of the Mutual Possession of the Ten Worlds], which gives 100, multiplied by ten [the Ten Factors listed in Ch. 2 of the Lotus Sutra which gives 1,000. 1,000 multiplied by 3 [the Three Realms of Existence: Self, Other, and Environment] which gives 3,000.

<text>John Wallace Walker (May 16, 1949 – February 2, 2024) was an American computer programmer, author and co-founder of the computer-aided design software company Autodesk. He was later recognized for his writing on his website Fourmilab.

== Early projects ==
Walker was born in Baltimore, Maryland on May 16, 1949. He studied electrical engineering at Case Western Reserve University. In 1974/1975, Walker wrote the ANIMAL software, which self-replicated on UNIVAC 1100 machines. It is considered one of the first computer viruses.

Walker also founded the hardware integration manufacturing company Marinchip. Among other things, Marinchip pioneered the translation of numerous computer language compilers to Intel platforms.

== Autodesk ==
In 1982, John Walker and 12 other programmers pooled US$59,000 to start Autodesk, and began working on several computer applications. The first completed was AutoCAD, a software application for computer-aided design (CAD) and drafting. AutoCAD had begun life as &quot;Interact&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;3dcadworld/ancestor&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;michaelriddle/myself&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a CAD program, written by programmer Michael Riddle&lt;ref name=&quot;digibarn/Riddle&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in a proprietary language. Walker and Riddle rewrote the program, and established a profit-sharing agreement for any product derived from InteractCAD. Walker subsequently paid Riddle US$10 million for all the rights.

The company went public in 1985. By mid-1986, the company had grown to 255 employees with annual sales of over $40 million. That year, Walker resigned as chairman and president of the company, continuing to work as a programmer. In 1989, Walker&#x27;s book, &quot;The Autodesk File&quot;, was published. It describes his experiences at Autodesk, based around internal documents (particularly email) of the company.

Walker moved to Switzerland in 1991. By 1994, when he resigned from the company, it was the sixth-largest personal computer software company in the world, primarily from the sales of AutoCAD. Walker owned more than 850,000 shares of Autodesk at the time of his departure, worth about $45.8 million at the time ($ adjusted for inflation).

== Fourmilab ==
He published on his personal domain, &quot;Fourmi Lab&quot;, designed to be a play on Fermilab and , French for “ant”, one of his early interests. On his Web site, Walker published about his personal projects, including a hardware random number generator called HotBits, along with software that he wrote and freely distributed, such as his Earth and Moon viewer. Another notable book was called The Hacker&#x27;s Diet.

==The digital imprimatur==
Among other things, he is noted for a frequently cited article entitled &quot;The Digital Imprimatur: How big brother and big media can put the Internet genie back in the bottle&quot;, an article about Internet censorship written in 2003. It was published in the magazine &quot;Knowledge, Technology &amp; Policy&quot;. In the article, Walker argues that there is increasing pressure limiting the ability for Internet users to voice their ideas, as well as predicting further Internet censorship. Walker said that the most likely candidate to usher what he calls &quot;the digital imprimatur&quot; is digital rights management, or DRM.

==Personal life and death==
Walker married Roxie Smail in 1973. They moved to Switzerland in 1991. He died of head injuries sustained after a fall on February 2, 2024, in Neuchâtel, Switzerland, at the age of 74.

== In popular culture ==

Walker&#x27;s interest in artificial life prompted him to hire Rudy Rucker, a mathematician and science fiction author, for work on cellular automata software. Rucker later drew from his experience at Autodesk in Silicon Valley for his novel &quot;The Hacker and the Ants&quot;, in which one of the characters is loosely based on John Walker.

<doc id="305582" wikidata="Q15831558" url="?curid=305582" title="Warhammer Fantasy (setting)">
<text>Warhammer Fantasy is a fictional fantasy universe created by Games Workshop and used in many of its games, including the table top wargame &quot;Warhammer&quot;, the &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay&quot; (WFRP) pen-and-paper role-playing game, and a number of video games: the MMORPG &quot;Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning&quot;, the strategy games &quot;Total War: Warhammer&quot;, &quot;Total War: Warhammer II&quot; and &quot;Total War: Warhammer III&quot; and the two first-person shooter games in the Warhammer Vermintide series, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, among many others.

Warhammer is notable for its “dark and gritty” background world, which references a range of historical cultures such as the Holy Roman Empire, Mesoamerica, ancient Egypt, or medieval France, and is populated with a variety of races such as humans, high elves, dark elves, wood elves, dwarfs, undead, orcs, lizardmen, and other creatures familiar to many fantasy/role-playing settings.

The development of the setting began with the release of a game simply called “Warhammer” in 1983.

== Background ==

The Warhammer world drew inspiration from Tolkien’s Middle-earth, but also from Robert E. Howard (&quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;) and Michael Moorcock, as well as real-world history, particularly European history. What is recognisable as the Warhammer World began with the expansion material to the first edition of the game Warhammer, but was formulated as a distinct setting with a world map in the second edition.

The Warhammer World borrowed considerably from historical events and other fantasy fiction settings. The Old World is recognisably Europe approximating to various historical periods including the Renaissance—the Empire being set over what was the Holy Roman Empire—medieval France, Roman Italy and Celtic Britain. Many events are lifted and modified directly from history, including the Black Plague and the Moorish invasion of Spain, and others from original fantasy sources. Like Middle-earth, Warhammer’s Dwarfs are declining in population, the Elves have mostly departed for homelands in the West, and a Great Necromancer is reborn after the defeats in his Southern stronghold.

== Races and nations ==

The world of Warhammer Fantasy has some of the largest distribution of races and cultures in pop fantasy.

=== Mankind ===
The world most prominent, often proves to be the most susceptible to the corrupting influence of Chaos. Most of the featured human nations are based in the Old World (analogous to real Europe): The Empire (Holy Roman Empire), Bretonnia (France and Arthurian Britain), and Kislev (Slavs of Russia, Poland, and Ukraine). Further east of them is another powerful human civilisation known as Grand Cathay (corresponding to China). There is also Nippon (Japan), and Araby (based loosely on the various Middle Eastern powers that ruled throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance, most notably the Ottoman Empire).

=== Old Ones ===
Many factions, such as the Elves, the Lizardmen, the Ogres and the Halflings, have been created by the Old Ones: star-travelling gods responsible for the creation of most of the setting’s sentient races. These Old Ones were brought low by the daemonic forces inadvertently unleashed by the collapse of their Warp Gates (one on the North Pole and one on the South Pole), leaving their creations to fend for themselves. This backstory also provides an easy explanation for the presence of a variety of familiar fantasy races. Ogres and Halflings, for example, are closely related. Both are resistant to the mutating effects of Chaos energies (fuelled by hearty appetites and efficient metabolisms), but have opposite physical templates.

=== Elves ===
The Elves were the first civilised race to walk the Warhammer world. Brought into creation by the Old Ones, the Elves showed a natural talent for magic and superlative martial skills. The once thriving civilisation of the Elves was torn asunder many thousands of years ago by a bitter civil war, resulting in the sundering of the race into three distinct kindreds: the evil, twisted Dark Elves, the proud, noble and magical High Elves who continue the ancient traditions from before the sundering, and a third group as the rustic, sylvan and mysterious Wood Elves. The High Elves inhabit the magical island of Ulthuan (analogous to Atlantis), while the Dark Elves inhabit the continent of Naggaroth (correspondent to North America in the real world), a desolate icy wilderness and the Wood Elves live in the forests of Athel Loren in the Old World.

=== Chaos ===
Many races have fallen to, or been corrupted by Chaos. The barbaric Warriors of Chaos (formerly called “Hordes of Chaos”) invade the civilised nations from the far northern Chaos Wastes. Beastmen, the human-animal hybrid products of Chaos are found in the dark forests of the entire Warhammer world.

The Chaos forces are the personified flaws of sapient beings; the inner daemons of living things come back through a magic medium as literal daemons to torment and kill. The ultimate victory of these forces is often hinted at, highlighting a strong assumption that sentient beings are fundamentally flawed and will eventually bring about their own destruction via the forces of Chaos. The possibility of the victory of Chaos is a major theme in the End Times campaign.

=== Dwarfs ===
Dwarfs are an ancient, gritty, and determined race integral in the founding of the Empire. Dwarfs are the greatest craftsmen in the Warhammer World, a skill largely matched by the Chaos Dwarfs who split from their brothers after being corrupted by Chaos.

=== Lizardmen ===
In the jungles of the Lustria continent (Central and South America) are the Lizardmen who were created by the Old Ones to aid in their great works. The Slann, who act as leaders and priests, now lead the Lizardmen blindly, via ancient prophecies containing almost incomprehensible instructions left by the Old Ones. The culture and aesthetic of the Lizardmen are heavily inspired by those of the Aztec and Mayan cultures.

=== Orcs, Goblins ===
Orcs, Goblins, and their kin (also known as Greenskins), are relatively primitive and disorganised, but their instinctive belligerence threatens the various nations. Their violent nature commonly causes wars against not only the neighbouring peoples, but also their own kind. They are found predominantly in the forests and mountains of the Old World, as well in the jungles to the south and stretched across the steppes to the East, but their kin can be found all over the world, inhabiting almost all continents and adapting to their environments. Thus there are many sub-species of Orcs and Goblins such as Black Orcs and Night Goblins. They are described in the supplemental book Orcs and Goblins, first published in 1993. The phrase “orcs &amp; goblins” also refers collectively to all of the races that are described in this book, which includes other “greenskins” as well. The book includes background information, illustrations, and game rules for these races. The Orcs and Goblins represent a generic Dark Ages warband army with little internal cohesion and discipline, and relying on the ferocious charge and individual fighting skills rather than organised generalship. In issue 203 of &quot;Dragon&quot; #203 (March 1994), Bob Bigelow liked the fact that the details were told through stories that “details animosity levels between orc and goblin and the importance of shamans.” He also noted that “The armies list is split between the different types of orcs and goblins, as well as monsters’ allies.” Bigelow concluded that the book has “excellent line drawings and action illustrations as well as [its] practical game value [...] well worth the price to anyone who wishes to campaign.”

=== Skaven ===
Living underneath much of the known world are the Skaven, diabolical ratmen living in a subterranean dog-eat-dog Machiavellian society, called the “Under-empire.” They are divided into clans such as Clan Eshin, master assassins, or Clan Skryre, master engineers. It is believed that they are so numerous that if they worked together they would be able to destroy the surface world, however their innate predilection for cowardice and betrayal makes long term cooperation unlikely.

=== Undead ===
Besides these, there are the Undead, who are a result of the black sorceries of the first necromancer, Nagash, in the long distant past. His legacy has left the Tomb Kings, who are the resurrected armies of the first human civilisation, in the hot desert lands of Nehekhara to the south of the Old World (based on Ancient Egypt), the Vampire Counts in the Old World (based upon &quot;Dracula&quot; which is set in Transylvania), the zombie pirates of Luthor Harkon’s Vampire Coast found on the eastern coast of Lustria (based on stereotypical pirates of the 18th century), and Nagash in his own city of undead. Prior to Games Workshop retconning the backstory, there was previously a unified Undead Army.

== Fiction ==

Outside of games, there have been novels, novellas and short stories by various authors set in the &quot;Warhammer&quot; world, the most famous of which are the novels featuring Gotrek and Felix by William King. The &quot;Gotrek and Felix&quot; series was taken over by Nathan Long, starting with &quot;Orcslayer&quot; in 2006.

&quot;Warhammer Fantasy&quot; author Stephen Baxter has stated that according to Marc Gascoigne the idea of Chaos in Warhammer was inspired by &quot;The Eternal Champion&quot; and its sequels, written by Michael Moorcock, who made use of ideas from &quot;Three Hearts and Three Lions&quot; by Poul Anderson. The Warhammer elves were inspired by &quot;The Broken Sword&quot; by Poul Anderson as well the Middle-earth canon of J. R. R. Tolkien.

Early in his career, Kim Newman wrote Warhammer novels under the pen name Jack Yeovil. Some elements from these books (in particular his heroine Genevieve Dieudonné) later reappeared in the award-winning Anno Dracula series.

Early novels were published as “GW Books” by Boxtree Ltd, but more recently novels have been under Games Workshop’s publishing arm, the Black Library. &quot;Warhammer Monthly&quot; was a comic book, published by Black Library, which ran for over 5 years and included strips set in the other areas of the Warhammer Universe. Generally running concurrently with &quot;Warhammer Monthly&quot; was &quot;Inferno!&quot; – also published by Black Library – a magazine which compiled short stories and occasional unconnected illustrations set in the fictional backgrounds of Games Workshop.

Games Workshop licensed out the rights for comic books. Boom! Studios have been working on a series of Warhammer and Warhammer 40,000 comics, written by Dan Abnett and Ian Edginton. The first was the Warhammer 40k strip &quot;Damnation Crusade&quot;, but this was followed by one in the fantasy universe &quot;Forge of War&quot;. When this was finished, they started a new series located in the &quot;Warhammer Fantasy&quot; universe, called &quot;Warhammer – Condemned by Fire&quot;. This series features a witch-hunter fighting the Chaos minions in the remote regions of the Empire.

== Locations ==
=== Realm of Chaos ===
The Realm of Chaos (also called the Warp, the Aethyr, the Empyrean, the Realm of Souls or the Immaterium) is an alternate dimension which is found in several of Games Workshop’s fictional universes, including Warhammer Fantasy. It is separate to the physical world of Warhammer, and draws inspiration from depictions of hell, the underworld and cosmic horror. The normal laws of physics and linear time/causality do not apply in the Realm of Chaos, and it is said that mortals who enter or even glimpse it tend to go insane.

The Realm itself is composed of raw magical energy generated by the emotions and thoughts of sapient creatures such as humans. Thus, the Realm of Chaos is the source of magic in the Warhammer World, and this is why magic is such an unwieldy, dangerous and often mutating force. The Realm is inhabited by malevolent daemonic creatures made of magic, the souls of mortal creatures, and most notably the four evil Chaos Gods. These four “Ruinous Powers” exert a corrupting influence upon mortals in the physical world. Their ultimate goal is to expand the Realm of Chaos, engulfing and destroying the physical world entirely.

=== Chaos Wastes ===
In contrast to the Realm of Chaos, the Chaos Wastes (also known as the Umbra Chaotica) are a part of the physical world. They are a vast, warped, cold and barren wasteland surrounding the northern polar region (and probably also the southern polar region) of the world. The Wastes border Grand Cathay, the Eastern Steppes, the Ogre Kingdoms, Norsca and Naggaroth. Norsca and the Eastern Steppes are sometimes considered to be part of the Wastes. At the north pole, there is a great collapsed Chaos Portal which allows travel between the physical world and the Realm of Chaos. This Portal spews dangerous, raw magical energy into the physical world, causing mutations to any person or creature in the north, and even to the land, climate and flow of time.

The Chaos Wastes are inhabited by various mutated flora and fauna, Daemons, Chaos monsters (including Beastmen), Greenskins and the barbaric human tribes of the Norse, Kurgan, Hung and Tong. These &quot;Warriors of Chaos&quot; worship the evil Chaos Gods whose influence is strong in the Wastes. In order to guard against incursions from the north, Grand Cathay has constructed a Great Bastion (similar to the real-world Great Wall of China), while the Dark Elves of Naggaroth have constructed a series of Watchtower fortresses.

=== The Old World ===
The Old World is a northerly region, roughly an analogue to Europe. It is a broadly temperate area dominated by several large human countries as well as smaller states controlled by Dwarfs and Wood Elves. There are also some areas controlled by Undead lords, or marauding Beastmen, Orcs, or Goblins.

====The Empire====
The Empire of Man, known to most as the Empire, is the largest and oldest human civilisation in the Old World. It is culturally, technologically, and geographically based on early modern Germany, with its name being an allusion to the historical Holy Roman Empire. To the east lie the World’s Edge Mountains, to the west Bretonnia, to the south the Border Princes/Badlands and to the north is Kislev and the sea. The main cities (which mostly lie in the south) are Altdorf (the current capital), Middenheim, Nuln, Talabheim and Averheim.

The Empire was originally founded thousands of years ago, when the Warrior-King Sigmar Heldenhammer (a Conan the Barbarian and Charlemagne-type figure) united several bronze-age tribes, and allied with the Dwarfs, to face the greater threats of Orcs and Goblins, Undead and Chaos. Sigmar has since become the primary god worshipped in the Empire, representing justice and strength, although there are also other important ones such as Ulric (god of wolves, winter and battle), Shallya (goddess of mercy and healing), Rhya (goddess of harvest and family) and Morr (god of death and the afterlife).

The Empire is a large, diverse country based around several large rivers: the Reik, Talabec, Stir and Aver. The various Provinces are each ruled by an Elector Count or equivalent, who elect an Emperor to rule for life. Despite this, the provinces have a great deal of autonomy to govern and defend themselves, and there has been centuries-long periods of civil war and contending-Emperors/Empresses. The centre and north of the country is dominated by huge forests, which often house bandits, Chaos cultists, Orcs/Goblins or Beastmen who prey on isolated settlements. The south of the country has a warmer climate and is dominated by grassland and extensive fields. Despite the great differences between the provinces, the people of the Empire are kept united by their “steel, gunpowder, and faith in Sigmar” as well as a common language: Reikspiel.

* Marienburg: in the west of the Empire, at the mouth of the River Reik, lies the free city-state of Marienburg, the largest and wealthiest city in the Old World. It is dominated by merchants and based on early modern Amsterdam. Marienburg is culturally linked to the Empire but politically entirely independent, having bribed a past Emperor in order to secede.
* Sylvania is a region of the Empire developed in the setting as a home to vampires, ghouls and other undead creatures, inspired by real-world Transylvania, as well as Hungary. It is a cursed land plagued by the restless dead and suffers from warpstone meteorite falls. Sylvania was once ruled openly by the &quot;Vampire Counts&quot;, the Von Carsteins, who raised undead armies to invade the rest of the country in a series of devastating wars. Today it is nominally ruled by human nobles but secretly ruled by vampire aristocrats. Treaties between the vampires and human nobles have created an uneasy peace. It is considered a backwater and generally shunned by the rest of the Empire.
* The Moot is a semi-autonomous area in the Empire, granted to the Halflings. It bears similarities to the Shire from Tolkien’s Middle-Earth.

====Bretonnia====
Bretonnia lies west of the Empire, across the Grey Mountains, and north of Estalia. Bretonnia is a temperate land with a mild climate and fertile soils, inspired by Medieval France and legends of King Arthur. In the centre of the country lie the Forest of Arden and Massif Orcal, two wild regions inhabited by Beastmen and Orcs/Goblins, respectively. Dominated by feudal dukedoms and ruled by a King, Bretonnia has a stark class divide between the wealthy knightly nobility, and the peasants who live in poverty and squalor, with very low class mobility. The nobility are supposed to follow a code of chivalry, and a small number eventually complete religious pilgrimage, becoming virtuous Grail Knights. However the majority of the upper classes are fiercely oppressive towards the peasants.

The main god of the nobility is the Lady of the Lake, although the peasant classes worship the polytheistic gods of the rest of the Old World, particularly Rhya. Bretonnia nominally includes the forest of Loren, although in reality most Bretonnians fear and avoid the Woodland Realm, and have many superstitions about it.

* Athel Loren is an enchanted forest in the southeast of Bretonnia. In a similar manner to the Chaos Wastes, the flow of time may distort and warp in the forest. Different sections may experience different times of day, or different seasons. A person may spend a day in the forest and emerge to find that only minutes have passed, or conversely that 100 years have gone by. Though nominally part of Bretonnia, the forest is actually ruled by the reclusive Wood Elves (descendants of breakaway High Elf colonists), who are in an uneasy alliance with ancient, xenophobic Forest Spirits such as Dryads and Treemen (similar to the Ents of Tolkien). At the forest’s centre lies the enormous Oak of Ages, drawing influence from various world tree myths.

====Kislev====
Kislev is a cold land, north of the Empire but south of Norsca. It is primarily based on Russia, with some references to other Eastern European countries, such as the unit called winged lancer – a reference to the Polish winged hussar. Much of Kislev is cold steppe, although there is an extensive taiga forest in the east. To the northwest, there is an ill-defined border between Kislev and Troll Country, a marshy, frigid wilderness infested with monsters. Historically, Kislev has been inhabited by a succession of human ethnic groups: first the Roppsmenn, then the Ungols and most recently the Gospodars who have united the region.

The state is ruled by Tzars (female title: Tzarina) and the current ruler is Tzarina Katarin, the “Ice Queen.” Tzars rule over Boyars (the middle nobility) and the Druzhina (the lowest nobility, mostly composed of ethnic Gospodars). There’s also the Chekist, the secret police and the analogue of the Empire’s Inquisition that’s used by the Tzars against heritics and political enemies alike. Kislev’s military is primarily composed of rotas of the Streltsi (firearm-welding infantry, hence the name) and the Winged Lancers – also known as “the Riders of the Dead,” for “they are mourned as if already deceased.”

The country’s recently established official religion is the Great Orthodoxy. The country’s most important god is Ursun, the bear-god of winter and strength, and the Kislevites seem to have a special affinity with bears. Other important gods include Dazh (god of fire, the sun, summer, family and hospitality) and Tor (god of storms). The main cities of Kislev are the eponymous Kislev, Erengrad and Praag The Cursed, which rule over the vast Oblasts surrounding them.

The country’s northern frontier position means that it often bears the brunt of devastating Chaos invasions, as Kislevite warriors spill their blood to keep the southern lands safe. Combined with poor soil and notoriously freezing winters, this has made the Kislevites a hardy, no-nonsense people. Out of necessity, Kislev has retained good relations with the Empire and Dwarfs: close allies against Chaos.

====Other====
* Estalia is the Warhammer equivalent of the Iberian Peninsula, located on a peninsula to the south-west of Bretonnia bordered by the Irrana and Abasko Mountains to the east, the Great Western Ocean to the north and west and the Southern Sea to the south. Far from hostile factions, Estalia is politically fractured, rival kingdoms (notably Bilbali and Magritta) vie against each other and neighbouring Tilea. Estalia bore the brunt of Sultan Jaffar’s invasion from Araby, which was eventually driven out by a combined force of Bretonnian Knights and Tilean Legionnaires. Estalians take great offense at being referred to as Tileans, or at being addressed in the Tilean language by accident. The peninsula is renowned for its Diestros, skilled duelists who ply their skills across the Old World. Like the Tileans, the Estalians’ revere Myrmidia as their highest goddess.
* Tilea is on a peninsula on the southern coast of the Old World, equivalent to Renaissance Italy with some Roman influences. To the north and east lies the high mountains of The Vaults, and to the south and west lies the sea. Due to this geographic protection, Tilea never had to unite, and has become dominated by rival city-states with a great wealth in trade. The most important gods in Tilea are Myrmidia, goddess of soldiers, justice, and wisdom and Mannann, god of the sea. Tilean mercenaries and traders can be found across the old world, and are famed for their skills in battle and haggling. Tilean explorers have also been at the forefront of contact with the New World and the Far East.
* Albion is an island in the great ocean northwest of the Empire, southwest of Norsca. Based on Britain and Ireland, inhabited by people similar to pre-Roman Gaelic and Celtic Briton tribes. Not much information has been published about it, although it was the setting for &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, an early-2000s event held by Games Workshop.
* The Border Prince Confederacy is a collection of petty Human kingdoms, bandits, mercenaries, pirates and other fugitives. It is analogous to the Balkans.

=== Dark Lands ===

The Dark Lands lie east of the Old World and west of the Far East, between the World’s Edge Mountains and Mountains of Mourn. It lacks any real-world equivalent, but is similar to Mordor of Tolkien’s Middle-earth, with a dry climate and many volcanoes.

In the northern Dark Lands is the empire of the &quot;Chaos Dwarfs&quot;. They are the most powerful faction in the region, and mesh industrialisation and Mesopotamian influences. Outside of this area, the Dark Lands are mostly dominated by barbaric Orcs and Goblin tribes. The River Ruin is the only major River in the Dark Lands, and it is heavily polluted by Chaos Dwarf industry.

To the southwest is the Plain of Bones where the remains of many dead dragons can be found. This area draws practitioners of necromancy and the Undead. To the southeast are the Dragon Isles which are often cited as a desirable, if dangerous, location for voyages in search of riches to aim for. On its southern coastline in the river delta region lies the frontier human settlement Pigbarter.

=== Ogre Kingdoms ===
East of the Dark Lands lie the Mountains of Mourn and Ancient Giant Lands, extremely high mountains with a cold climate, which resemble the Himalayas of the real world. This region is inhabited by fierce monsters resembling pleistocene megafauna. The brutish, semi-nomadic &quot;Ogre Kingdoms&quot; dominate here. They are primarily based on the nomadic Mongol Empire, as well as on cavemen tropes. The Ogres also have a race of slave Gnoblars (relatives of Goblins), and are said to be always hungry, valuing food as much as gold.

=== Far East ===
This area of the Warhammer World is equivalent to East/Southeast Asia. It is not greatly developed in the published games or fiction, but there are human civilizations there, specifically Ind, Grand Cathay, and Nippon (which are equivalents of India, China and Japan respectively). To the south lies the Hinterlands of Khuresh (which is inhabited by Nāgas) and Lost Isles of Ethlis, equivalent to Southeast Asia.

Grand Cathay is the largest human empire in Warhammer Fantasy, ruled by the Celestial Dragon Emperor and Moon Empress, who are immortal dragons able to shapeshift into human form. They delegate most governing of Cathay to 5 of their children, who are also immortal shapeshifting dragons and each rule a different region of the empire. Grand Cathay have long ago constructed an enormous fortification called the Great Bastion on their northern border, to guard against incursions from Hobgoblins and the forces of Chaos who dwell on the Eastern Steppes. There is some trade with the human nations of the Old World (via the “Ivory Road”) and the High Elves (via the sea), as well as coastal raids by the Dark Elves. But overall, contact between the east and west is quite limited, and Grand Cathay is fairly isolationist.

For the videogame &quot;Total War: Warhammer III&quot;, Games Workshop has worked together with British developer Creative Assembly to create background information for Grand Cathay, so that the faction may be included in the game.

===The Underground===
Various tunnels, caverns and entire cities, lie beneath the Old World, World’s Edge Mountains and the rest of the world. Most cities of the Dwarfs are underground, and many Orc/Goblin settlements are as well (the Night Goblins are especially known for being cave-dwellers and rarely come to the surface during daylight).

In ages past, the Dwarfs built the Underway, a great system of highways, mines and settlements which stretched huge distances between their great underground fortress-cities. Today, much of the underway is in ruins and highly dangerous. Many former Dwarf cities and Underway sections are now occupied by Night Goblins and Skaven (a race of evil, intelligent anthropomorphic rats, about the size of a human). The Dwarfs, Skaven and Orcs/Goblins are locked in a constant three-way war for control of the underground.The Skaven Under-Empire is a huge subterranean realm, comprising many repurposed Dwarf areas, as well as many Skaven-dug tunnels and settlements called “Under-Cities” beneath most human and Dwarf cities. Their capital and greatest city is Skavenblight, which lies in remote marshland between Estalia and Tilea. It is here that the secretive “Council of Thirteen” collectively rule the Under-Empire. The Skaven are perhaps the most numerous race in the Warhammer world, and often use mass numbers to overwhelm enemies, rising suddenly and unexpectedly from underground. They care little for casualties, and lack empathy for others even of their own kind, so their arcane war machines and mutant monsters often kill as many Skaven soldiers as enemies. Skaven worship only one god, the Great Horned Rat, with the Grey Seers (pale-furred, horned Skaven) serving as a caste of priests and spellcasters. Clan Pestilens are a breakaway sect who worship the Horned Rat in his aspect as a bringer of plagues and diseases.

===Ulthuan===
Ulthuan is a ring-shaped island continent, controlled by the High Elves. It lies in the ocean (equivalent to the Atlantic) to the west of the Old World, and east of the New World. It draws inspiration from Atlantis, Melniboné and Numenor. The Annuli Mountains run through the centre of the island. The capital and largest city of the High Elves is Lothern, located at a strait connecting the outer Ocean and Ulthuan’s Inner Sea. Politically, the island is divided up into 10 Kingdoms, although they all owe loyalty to the Phoenix King (High King) in Lothern and the Everqueen in Avelorn. Prior to the High Elves, Ulthuan was inhabited by many Dragons, and many still slumber here under the mountains.

Outside of infrequent invasions, the only threats on Ulthuan are monsters in the Annuli Mountains. As Ulthuan is a magical floating island, the Underway and Under-Empire do not extend to it.

At the centre of the Inner Sea lies the Great Vortex, a magical storm that drains excess magical energy from the world, fed by a global network of waystones maintained by the High Elves. If the Vortex were to fail, magical energy would build up and allow large scale invasions of Daemons from the Realm of Chaos.

===The New World===
====Naggaroth====
Naggaroth is the cold, bleak land analogous to North America. It is dominated by the cruel Dark Elves, who broke away from the High Elves following a destructive civil war called the Sundering. In general Naggaroth is quite wild and sparsely inhabited. In the north it has a tundra climate, while in the centre pine forests grow, inhabited by Beastmen. In the south lie steaming subtropical swamps and a land bridge to Lustria. The Dark Elves dwell primarily in large cities in the northeast: Naggarond (the capital), Ghrond, Clar Karond, Karond Kar and Har Ganeth. In the west lie the Black Spine Mountains, home to outcast Dark Elves called Shades, and the dry west coast. To the north, Naggaroth borders the Chaos Wastes and the Dark Elves have constructed a system of Watchtowers to defend against Chaos incursions.

====Lustria====
Lustria is a tropical southern continent equivalent to South America. Most of the continent is covered in extremely dangerous tropical rainforest full of poisonous and venomous creatures. The Lizardmen are the dominant power on the continent, and their ancient Temple-Cities (the greatest of which are Itza and Hexoatl) can be seen deep in the Jungle. Despite their bestial appearance, the Lizardmen are actually staunch opponents of Chaos and protectors of Order, although they are often apathetic towards the other races and hostile to those who trespass on Lustria. The wildlife of Lustria is dominated by large reptiles resembling dinosaurs and pterosaurs, and large insects which form the main food source of the Lizardmen. There is also various human, elven colonies along the coast, and undead (resulting from shipwrecked vampires) dominate The Vampire Coast in the east. In Lustria’s west there is the volcanic Spine of Sotek mountains, and to the west of that is the more arid west coast. To the east of Lustria, across the Great Ocean, lies the Southlands. To the north, across an isthmus, lies Naggaroth.

=== Nehekhara ===
Nehekhara, also called “the Land of the Dead” lies to the South of the Badlands and Old World, west of the Dark Lands. To the west lies Araby and to the south, the Southlands.

Nehekhara is inhabited by the &quot;Tomb Kings&quot;, an undead faction based heavily on Ancient Egypt and pop culture undead mummies. Nehekhara has a dry climate, with much of it being desert. The western half of the country contains the Great Mortis (formerly Great Vitae) River and the largest city, Khemri as well as other cities. The east of the country, across the Charnel Pass and World’s Edge Mountains, contains the infamous city of Lahmia.

The Tomb Kings/Nehekharans were formerly a living civilisation of humans. Their first King and uniter was Settra the Imperishable, who began the tradition of attempting to prolong life and avoid death. Thousands of years and many dynasties later, a new leader called Nagash came to power. Nagash became the first necromancer and indirectly created the first vampires in Lahmia, leading to civil war. Later, Nagash enacted a great ritual to kill everyone in Nehekhara and raise them again as undead slaves. During the ritual, Nagash was killed by the last King of Nehekhara, Alcadizzar. With the ritual gone awry, the mummified Nehekharan Kings and their skeletal soldiers awoke not to the promised afterlife, but to a nightmare of living death, and were very angry about this.

=== Norsca===
Norsca is isomorphic in position within the “Old World” to Scandinavia, and similar in shape and climate. Its human occupants, the “Norse,” were originally based upon historical Vikings, though as the setting developed the Norse departed from the historical template increasingly and are now one of the main tribes of the Warriors of Chaos.

Norsca abuts the Realm of Chaos (also called Shadowlands by Norse, Kurgans and Hung and known as Chaos Wastes) to its north. To its south beyond the Sea of Claws lies the Empire and to the east and Southeast the Eastern Steppes and Kurgan nation and the Kingdom of Kislev, respectively. Between Norsca and Kislev is a wilderness area called Troll Country.

Norsca was originally populated by both High Elves and Dwarfs. Humans came to this land long after them. Norse Dwarves still remain and often come into conflict with the Norse tribes, but Elves have left the land. There are many ancient elven ruins. One of these mysterious places is the Forest of Knives, in the middle of Norsca, where an ancient Elven temple is located.

Some novels involving mostly Norse characters and places are C. L. Werner’s Palace of the Plague Lord, Forged by Chaos and the Wulfrik, Valkia and Sigvald novels for Warhammer Heroes. &quot;The Legend of Sigmar&quot; novels also displays the Norse as the main antagonists of the first two books. Slaves to Darkness, by Gav Thorpe, also shows the Norse tribes as important supporting characters to the Imperial born Chaos Champion protagonist.

====Norse Dwarfs====
The Norse Dwarfs are the most northerly of the Dwarfs of the Old World. While related to the Dwarfs in their strongholds to the South, the separation over the years has led to some changes and the Norse Dwarfs have taken on some more wild characteristics compared to the mainstream of Dwarf society.

Norse Dwarfs are featured in the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (WFRP1) supplement and also in the (WFRP2) supplement Tome of Corruption.

* The main stronghold (capital) of Norse Dwarfs in Norsca is Kraka Drak. Other major holds included Sjoktraken port, Kraka Dorden, Kraka Onsmotek, Kraka Ravnvake.
* In the 2008 Warhammer Fantasy Battle (7th edition) book: Warriors of Chaos, features story about the destruction of Kraka Drak. This is done by High King Valmir Aesling. Valmir was a great general of the mighty Chaos Champion and Everchosen Asavar Kul, so this story probably happens during the time of “World War III” (IC circa 2300), but it is implied to have happened shortly after the defeat of Asavar Kul. Even though the story gives the idea that Kraka Drak is totally destroyed, it is still featured in many sources that are dated after the war. One possibility is that hold was retaken by the Norse Dwarfs sometime after the war (or not totally taken by the invading Chaos Horde). Or it could be a simple oversight on the part of the writers.

====The Norse====
The Norse are, like the historical Norsemen, great seaborne explorers, traders, reavers, and slavers who have built and maintain colonies in Lustria (the Warhammer world’s version of South and Mesoamerica).

Through the 1980s, the Norse troops and characters in Warhammer Fantasy were closely based on the historical Vikings. Later, the Norse were largely merged into the Chaos faction as the Warriors of Chaos (main human footsoldiers of Chaos).

=== The Southlands===
The Southlands correspond to real world sub-Saharan Africa. The Southlands lie south of the Land of the Dead and are dominated by dense swamplands and rain forest. These are inhabited by Lizardmen, savage orcs and forest goblins, and small tribes of what adventurers call the ‘Dark Men,’ who are content to live at peace with nature and seem to have the protection of the Lizardmen.

Lizardmen are the primary power in the Southlands and have five temple-cities, though one is ruined. Due to centuries of separation from their Lustrian brothers, the spawnings of saurus have become slightly rare and so skinks dominate in both civil life and warfare. Although similar in climate and culture to Lustria, the Southlands remain much less explored by human or High Elves and thus the Slann of the Southlands are said to have a much more complete set of Old One prophecies as they have not been pillaged by treasure hunters. However, the Slann practice of embalming their dead under pyramids is said to have had a major influence on the early Khemrian civilisation in the Land of the Dead, which suggests they were not always so isolated. They are reported to have come in conflict with the fabled “Lost Hold” of the Dwarfs, Karak Zorn, which is said to be located somewhere in the mountains of the Southlands.

The Southlands are believed to be the original homeland of the Dwarfs, where they began as simple cave dwellers using crude stone tools, before following the chain of mined riches up the mountain chain towards the north.

When the Skaven Clan Pestilens ravaged Lustria, they were driven out by Sotek and they migrated to the Southlands. Sotek also took action against them here by sending jungle swarms to destroy the clan.

=== Worlds Edge Mountains ===
The Worlds Edge Mountains are a significant geographic location in the fictional setting of the game of Warhammer Fantasy.

To the east of the Old World lies the ancient and impossibly high Worlds Edge Mountains. This snow-capped mountain range officially extends from the Nehekhara in the far south, up into the far north past Kislev, before branching west into Norsca. They separate the desolate Dark Lands in the east from the civilised lands of The Empire and Kislev in the west.

Though the unbroken chain of mountains reaches into the Southlands from the Worlds Edge Mountains, the peaks south of the Nehekharan deserts are technically part of the Great Mountains chain.

They are a prominent scene for many main events in the histories of the Dwarf, Orc and Goblin races.

==== Notable features ====

The High Pass is the northernmost route traversing the range, and descends into the lands of the Troll Country before its road leads eventually into the city of Praag in Kislev. A very popular invasion route for the marauder tribes of the west and the Orcish Warlord Grimgor Ironhide’s greenskins hordes.

Peak Pass is the next most northerly passage across the mountains. It is overlooked at its eastern starting point by the greenskin fortress of Gnashrak’s Lair, and at its western end by the Dwarf Stronghold of Karak Kadrin. In olden times it enabled Dwarfs to travel between the western and eastern fronts of the range. Though its importance has much declined since then and after the Dwarfs had forsaken the mines and watchposts on the eastern frontier. In the present times it must be guarded vigilantly for invading Orcs and Goblins moving from their eastern lairs use it as one of their main attack routes. The Karak Kadrin Dwarfs guard it fiercely against these intruders

The Silver Road is a central route that comes in from the easterly Wolf Lands. Its western opening bypasses The Dwarfen capital city Karaz-a-Karak, while its east is haunted by the Orc-infested ruins of the old Dwarf mine, Mount Silverspear, which is now known more commonly as Mount Grimfang, after the Orcish warlord who captured it. In olden times the pass was the scene of the bloody battles of the Silver Road Wars.

Black Fire Pass is originally named Haz-Drazh-Kadrin by the Dwarfs, which literally translates into human tongue as &quot;Passage of Black Flame&quot;. It forms a divider between the Black mountains and the World’s Edge Mountains and is the main route between the lands of the Border Princes, Karaz-a-Karak and the southern regions of The Empire, travelling along the historical Old Dwarf Road. It is essentially a deep chasm, created when volcanic eruptions tore the peaks in ages past. Orc and goblin tribes in the south use this as their principal route of invasion through the mountains. More importantly, &quot;The Battle of Black Fire Pass&quot; was played out here, which an alliance of tribes of men of the time before the Empire, and the Dwarfs, engaged a massive invading greenskin army in the pass. The ensuing victory was the beginning of the founding of the nation of men under Sigmar.

Mad Dog Pass, alternately known as Varag Kadrin, was in the days of the Dwarf’s greatest power, the chief thoroughfare to the isolated mines of the Dark Lands and the eastern front of the ranges. It is now only occasionally used, and studded with Night Goblin fortresses and their tunnels riddle its steep sides.

Black Water is an immense mountain lake high in the western highlands, and its Black Falls empty down into the Skull River. The lake is actually a vast crater, and was filled up with melted ice water from the surrounding snowy mountains. In ancient times a meteor fell from the heavens and punched this massive crater into the rock. Valuable metals and ores can be found all around the lake. Many Dwarf strongholds were founded around Black Water to mine and refine these meteoric ores, and to take advantage of the raging torrents gushing down the mountainside from the Black Falls, powering waterwheels and machinery. Its black depths are home to ancient and dark monsters. &quot;The Battle of Black Falls&quot; also took place here, when Dwarf and Goblin armies met on the shores of Black Water. The High King Alrik and the Goblin Warlord Gorkil Eyegouger were both slain while fighting along the edge of the Black Falls.

==== Volcanoes ====

The South World’s Edge Mountains are more volcanically active than the northern regions. The largest volcanoes are named Fire Mountain, Red Cloud Mountain and Thunder Mountain. They continually bring up new minerals from the planet’s interior, and thus attract many miners, although their settlements are frequently destroyed by eruptions and earthquakes.

==== Major locations ====
The Worlds Edge Mountains are a barren wilderness. The Dwarf Strongholds are the only enclaves of civilisation in the region. The Greenskins also have many crude settlements in the mountains, as do the Skaven. The fallen Holds are also home to these two races.

Karaz-a-Karak means &quot;Pinnacle of the Mountains&quot; and is also known to men as &quot;The Everpeak&quot;. This Dwarfen Hold is the largest and most powerful, and is also their capital city. Its lord is the High King of all the Dwarfs. Currently ruled over by High King Thorgrim Grudgebearer. The temples of the venerable Ancestor Gods are here, and is also home to the Great Book of Grudges, a vast account of all wrongdoings and breaches of faith against the Dwarfen race.

Karak Ungor, now known as Red Eye Mountain. It is now overrun by the Red Eye Tribe of the Night Goblins, and was the first Dwarfen Hold to fall. It sits in the north, overlooking western Kislev.

Karak Kadrin, has a reputation as being home to fierce Dwarf clans. Known commonly as Slayer Keep. Home to the Shrine of Grimnir, and where the Dwarf Slayer Cult makes pilgrimages to. Its King is bound by two incompatible Oaths. That of &quot;A King to his People&quot;, and that of his family’s hereditary &quot;Slayer Oath&quot;, neither of which he can successfully fulfil without failing in the other.

Cripple Peak is the mountain spire in the south overlooking the Sour Sea. It is riddled with the tainted rock known as Warpstone, which is highly prized by the Skaven and Necromancers. It is the home of the Supreme Lord of the Undead, Nagash. A massive army of skeletal warriors patrols the ramparts of the fortified mountain while their master regains his power after the last time he was defeated. Nagash ordered the mountain to be mined for all of its Warpstone for his use in Necromancy, by his legions of undead and local human tribes which pledged allegiance to him out of terror. The lower regions are known as the Cursed Pit.

====Dragons====
The Worlds Edge Mountains are also home to many great Dragons. Throughout history there have been many dragon nests discovered by miners, and their hoards are of great proportions. Most of the time these dragons are in a deep slumber. Notable dragons include Skaladrak Incarnadine, Mordrak, Fyrskar and Graug the Terrible.

<text>Massachusetts is a U.S. state in New England. The music of Massachusetts has developed actively since it was first colonized by Britain. The city of Boston is an especially large part of the state&#x27;s present music scene, which includes several genres of rock, as well as classical, folk, and hip hop music.

== Indigenous music ==
== Concert music ==
Perhaps the most influential early composer of the United States was Lowell Mason. A native of Boston, Mason campaigned against the use of shape-note notation, and for the education in standard notation. He worked with local institutions to release collections of hymns and maintain his stature. Opposed to the shape-note tradition, Mason pushed American music towards a European model.

The Bay Psalm Book (&quot;The Whole Booke of Psalmes Faithfully Translated into English Metre&quot;) was published in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1640; it was the first book of any kind printed in the English colonies of North America. It became the standard used by New England churches for many years, though it contained no music itself, merely providing psalms and pointing readers to other prominent publications. The Bay Psalm Book was faithful to its source, but did not produce beautiful singing. In 1651, then, a third edition was created, and became known as the New England Psalm Book; this became the standard for many years. By this point, the evolution from the Ainsworth Psalter to the New England Psalm Book had steadily dwindled the number of tunes in use.

Massachusetts was later home to a number of the most prominent members of the First New England School of itinerant singing masters, including Daniel Read (later of New Haven, Connecticut) and Supply Belcher (later of Farmington, Maine).
Massachusetts is home to several formal ensembles: Boston Symphony Orchestra, Boston Pops Orchestra, Boston Lyric Opera, and Tanglewood Festival Chorus. Formal institutions for the perpetuation of formal music exist in the state as well: Boston Conservatory, Longy School of Music, New England Conservatory, and Berklee College of Music.

Choral music has been a major part of concert life with two of the oldest choral organizations in the United States based in Massachusetts: Stoughton Musical Society, founded in 1786, and Handel and Haydn Society, founded in 1815.

== Sea shanties ==

As Massachusetts has long maintained a great maritime tradition from the early colonial fishermen to its importance in the whaling industry in the nineteenth century, songs of the sea have been prominent in the state&#x27;s musical heritage. Traditional English sea shanties were brought to New England and preserved by colonial American seamen. A New England version of the sea shanty &quot;Spanish Ladies&quot; changes &#x27;England&#x27; to &#x27;New England&#x27; or, in some versions, &#x27;Boston&#x27; or &#x27;New Bedford&#x27;, and &#x27;British sailors&#x27; to &#x27;Yankee Whalermen&#x27;.

== Folk music ==
Folklorists who have collected traditional music of Massachusetts include Eloise Hubbard Linscott, whose field recordings from 1938 and 1941 are in the Library of Congress American Folklife Center.

A number of musicians with ties to the American folk music revival have Massachusetts connections. While a teenager living in Belmont, Joan Baez gave her first concert at the Club 47 in Cambridge. James Taylor was born in Boston, but later moved to North Carolina before once again relocating to Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. He now lives in the town of Lenox. Paul Clayton from New Bedford, best known for his song &quot;Gotta Travel On&quot;, was a minor figure in the folk revival. Both Bill Staines, who grew up in Lexington, and Bonnie Raitt, who attended college in Cambridge, were influenced by the folk revival through the concerts at Club 47.

The diverse contemporary Massachusetts folk music scene includes musicians such as David Coffin, who specializes in early music and sea music; Lui Collins, a folk singer-songwriter; Vance Gilbert, a folk singer with a background in jazz; and Aoife Clancy, formerly of Cherish the Ladies, who sings traditional Irish and contemporary folk songs. It also includes Ellis Paul, a singer-songwriter who came onto the Boston music scene in the late 1980s after arriving at Boston College on a track scholarship. Since then he has been the recipient of 14 Boston Music Awards.

According to the New England Folk Network Web site, Massachusetts hosts more than a dozen annual folk music festivals. Of these, the Lowell Folk Festival claims to be the biggest free folk festival in the United States, while the New England Folk Festival, which began in 1944, may be the longest-running festival in the state. Festivals may include folk music from a wide diversity of cultures. For example, the 2007 New England Folk Festival included Bulgarian, Japanese, and Swedish music, and the 2007 Working Waterfront Festival included Portuguese fado music and Mexican norteño.

== Jazz ==

Jazz musicians born in Massachusetts include pianist and composer Irene Higginbotham, multi-instrumentalist Jaki Byard, multi-instrumentalist Bill Dixon, saxophonist and clarinetist Harry Carney, bassist Teddy Kotick, pianist Barbara Carroll, pianist Ralph Burns, keyboardist Chick Corea, trumpeter Max Kaminsky, tenor saxophonist Paul Gonsalves, alto saxophonists Johnny Hodges and Phil Woods, singer Nnenna Freelon, multi-instrumentalist Teddy Charles, drummer and vibraphonist Johnny Rae, pianist Ran Blake, soprano saxophonist and composer Jane Ira Bloom, drummer Terri Lyne Carrington, and saxophonist Carol Sudhalter.

Pat Metheny, though originally from the midwest, has spent most of his career based in Massachusetts.

== R&amp;B ==
Doo-wop group The G-Clefs were from Roxbury. The Tune Weavers formed in Woburn.

Jonzun Crew was an electro and early funk–hip hop group that was active in the 1980s in Boston.

The R&amp;B group New Edition is from the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston. Masspike Miles is also from Roxbury.

== Hip-hop ==
Massachusetts has produced a number of notable hip-hop artists since the birth of hip-hop, including:
*Bell Biv DeVoe
*Cousin Stizz
*Ed O.G.
*Gang Starr
*Joyner Lucas
*New Edition
*Statik Selektah

== Rock ==

The Remains and The Rockin&#x27; Ramrods formed in Boston. The Barbarians formed in Cape Cod and The Shames formed in Ipswich.
The Modern Lovers, featuring Jonathan Richman, David Robinson (later of The Cars), and (for a short time) Jerry Harrison of Talking Heads, came out of Boston, as did more mainstream acts like Aerosmith, The Cars, and Boston. The J. Geils Band formed at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, before adding Peter Wolf and Stephen Jo Bladd from Boston band The Hallucinations to the lineup.

Paul Pena was born in Hyannis and attended Clark University in Worcester. He played gigs at the Holden experiment with Bonnie Raitt and other Worcester folkies. He went on to play with T. Bone Walker and wrote the 1970s Steve Miller Band hit &quot;Jet Airliner&quot;.

The Real Kids formed in 1972. From the North Shore were the Nervous Eaters who formed in 1977. They were managed by The Rathskeller in Kenmore Square and released two 45s on the club&#x27;s RAT label.

=== Alternative rock ===
The earliest alternative rock bands in Massachusetts hailed from Boston and included Salem 66, The Neighborhoods, The Neats, Uzi, Volcano Suns, Human Sexual Response, La Peste, and Mission of Burma. Later bands from eastern Massachusetts included Pixies, Morphine, Galaxie 500, Swirlies, and the Pernice Brothers. Farther west, in Amherst, the dissolution of the legendary hardcore punk band Deep Wound spurred the foundation of future legends Sebadoh and Dinosaur Jr. from its ashes. Amherst and neighboring Northampton also spawned the Scud Mountain Boys, Buffalo Tom, and Lo Fine.

<doc id="305596" wikidata="Q951384" url="?curid=305596" title="Total Annihilation">
<text>Total Annihilation is a science fiction real-time strategy video game released in September 1997 for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS by Cavedog Entertainment and distributed internationally by GT Interactive. Two expansion packs were released in 1998, &quot;The Core Contingency&quot; on April 29 and &quot;Battle Tactics&quot; on July 20, while a medieval-themed spin-off called &quot;Total Annihilation: Kingdoms&quot; was released on June 25, 1999.

Rights to the game passed to Infogrames (later Atari) following the 1999 acquisition and closure of Cavedog Entertainment&#x27;s parent company, Humongous Entertainment. In July 2013, Wargaming bought the &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; franchise from Atari&#x27;s bankruptcy proceedings.

&quot;Total Annihilation&quot; has been re-released on Steam and GOG, but is no longer actively supported. The creators of XTA, a mod for &quot;Total Annihilation&quot;, independently developed the open-source 3D graphics Spring game engine. The &quot;Total Annihilation 3D&quot; project began in 2006. Former lead designer Chris Taylor went on to found Gas Powered Games which created &quot;Supreme Commander&quot; in 2007, considered the &quot;spiritual successor&quot; of &quot;Total Annihilation&quot;.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Total Annihilation&quot; is set in the far future in the midst of a galactic war, with battles taking place on the surface of planets and moons. The efforts of the player are centered on constructing a defensive base and an offensive force, and conquering opponents. The player is also concerned with gathering resources, reconnaissance and stealth, and evaluation of units and terrain. Battles take place against AI in a story-driven campaign, with the option of playing against other players in a skirmish mode.

When starting a new game, the player normally begins with a lone Commander. The Commander is a powerful and irreplaceable unit that has a number of unique abilities such as a destructor weapon that vaporizes anything it hits, the ability to use cloaking and become invisible, and the ability to travel through bodies of water. Construction is governed by the possession of the game&#x27;s two unlimited resources, Metal and Energy, and can be undertaken by factories or mobile construction units. Every unit belongs to a level of technology (tech level); the higher the level, the more advanced the unit and the more resources and thus time required to construct it. A feature of the game is the ability to easily &quot;queue&quot; the many commands for a unit or group of units, with types of commands including patrolling a route, constructing a defensive group of structures and attacking enemy units. Once given its commands, the unit will go about them automatically thus minimizing the need for the player&#x27;s attention to small, repetitive tasks. The victory conditions of a multiplayer game generally involve the elimination of all enemy units, but the aim of single player campaign missions can be more specialized.

===Resources===
Resources in &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; are handled in a manner different from other real-time strategy games of the day: they are &quot;streaming&quot;, meaning that they are accumulated at a constant rate rather than in small batches; and they are limitless. In addition, all units and structures have a fixed cost, but they build at varying rates depending on the unit constructing them. A Commander, for example, will build a structure three times faster than a construction vehicle, but at a higher cost in energy. If the rate at which resources are used exceeds the rate at which resources are acquired, then the player&#x27;s reserves will begin to be depleted. If a player&#x27;s reserves are entirely depleted, the player&#x27;s production across the board will slow to a rate proportional to the amount by which outflow exceeds income, this is known as &quot;nanostalling&quot;. In addition, if the player runs out of energy, power-dependent structures such as radar towers, metal extractors, and laser towers will cease to function. This adds an element of economic complexity unparalleled in most RTS games of the time period. When a unit or structure is destroyed, it leaves behind wreckage that may be reclaimed for a lump sum of metal. Many terrain structures may also be reclaimed for their metal. Some maps also have plants or other organic structures that can be reclaimed for energy.

===Combat===
The player can command a variety of units including infantry bots, vehicles, ships, hovercraft, aircraft, powerful stationary long range weapons, and even a giant mecha known as the Core Krogoth. Units vary in size, speed and the ability to give and take damage, depending on their tech level. The strongest units take longer to build as well as cost more resources. Each unit has strengths and weaknesses, optimal styles of use, and corresponding units against which it is vulnerable or well-suited. Effective play is usually characterized by consideration of these attributes, as well as efficient resource management, strong defenses, and knowledge of the opponent&#x27;s strategies. The game&#x27;s interface consists of construction and command buttons (depending on the unit selected), unit status information, resource information on the production of Energy and Metal, and a minimap which gives an overview of the game&#x27;s battlespacethe visibility of which may be hindered by fog of war, necessitating the use of radar or scout units. There are a few highly advanced units which are invaluable combat-wise, such as nuclear missile launchers which have enormous range and very high damage, as well as long-range artillery that have enough range to attack any point on smaller maps. There are two story-related factions, Arm and Core, which have comparable sets of units (one side a little bit faster, other one a little bit tougher etc.), but are aesthetically different. Generally, the Arm have faster, sleeker units while the Core units are built to take slightly more punishment. This is shown exceptionally well by the Arm being able to build an extremely fast Kbot known as the Zipper, while the Core can build an armored Kbot known simply as The Can. When playing amongst experienced players, subtle differences between the two factions put Core players at a disadvantage. The most noticeable differences are as follows: The level 1 Arm fighter aircraft is 1.7× more maneuverable than its Core counterpart, the Arm commander walks 1.12× faster than the Core commander, amphibious Arm Kbots float above water, making them faster and more useful than their submerging Core counterparts, Arm players can build Farks, fast assistant repair Kbots which can be crowded around labs and structures to dramatically reduce build times, and level 1 Arm tanks are equipped with superior weapons. Core has some distinct advantage as well, such as superior naval units, level 1 bombers that drop more bombs, and less conspicuous nuclear facilities. These advantages, however, are overshadowed by the Arm advantages in most situations.

&quot;Total Annihilation&quot; was one of the first RTS games to feature radar that showed enemy units within its radius on the minimap. This added an additional element of electronic warfare to the game: players could construct radar jammers that prevented units in a small radius around them from appearing on radar. Mobile radar jammers could be used to create surprise attacks, necessitating the deployment of scout units on a regular basis to reveal said units visually. In addition, radar jammers could disguise the presence of visually cloaked units, such as the commander or land mines. Radar fields rendered cloaked units detectable; a radar jammer could make said units undetectable until the radar jammer was destroyed. &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; was also one of the first RTS games to point the way towards battlefields with hundreds and thousands of units. Previous games could field a hundred units or so. &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; initially permitted 250 units per side which was later patched to 500. A third party patch allowed up to 5,000 units per side.

===Physics===
The game features a physics engine which governs projectiles, explosions and wreckage. The terrain is displayed as a 2D raster image but contains height values that allow it to act as a 3D surface. Hills obstruct artillery fire, and, depending on the &quot;line-of-sight&quot; setting, height enhances units&#x27; visual and firing ranges. If terrain is steep and jagged, units tilt and turn to meet the face of the ground, slowing down or speeding up in accordance with gravity. Structures can be built on steep terrain to protect them from artillery fire and to create choke points. The wind, tides, and gravity on different maps also vary; some maps have strong wind gusts and are more suited for gathering energy via windmills. Plant life is often flammable and can be set on fire by shooting it.

===Maps===
The game features a number of terrain and tile sets. These represent several different planets that the war between the Arm and Core is being waged on, and contain various unique characteristics. The Core&#x27;s home world, Core Prime, consists of inorganic metal structures and inky black seas. Since everything is made of metal, the player has unlimited access to this resource and can afford to build armies and bases more rapidly than on most other worlds. Other maps include the Arm&#x27;s home planet, a grassy green area of forests, hills, and blue water, a barren desert world with rocks and mesas, a Martian landscape, a sandy planet with beaches and blue oceans, a volcanic world with lava instead of water, an ice planet, and more.

Many maps contain lakes or oceans; these are impassable by most land units and will require ships or aircraft to reach different landmasses. Certain land units can travel underwater, but in doing so may be attacked by enemy ships and not be able to fight back. Other maps contain lava or acid which is completely impassable except by aircraft.

==Plot==
The game&#x27;s start-up credits give a summary of the game&#x27;s narrative:

&quot;What began as a conflict over the transfer of consciousness from flesh to machines escalated into a war which has decimated a million worlds. The &quot;Core&quot; and the &quot;Arm&quot; have all but exhausted the resources of a galaxy in their struggle for domination. Both sides now crippled beyond repair, the remnants of their armies continue to battle on ravaged planets, their hatred fueled by over four thousand years of total war. This is a fight to the death. For each side, the only acceptable outcome is the complete elimination of the other.&quot;
In the far future the galaxy is ruled by a benevolent central government of humans and artificially intelligent machines called the Core. The Core&#x27;s technological and economic triumphs have allowed humanity to colonize most of the Milky Way and enjoy a golden age of peace and prosperity. However, the peace is shattered by a technological breakthrough dubbed &quot;patterning&quot;, which allows the consciousness of a living human being to be reliably transferred into a machine, thereby granting a theoretically indefinite lifespan safe from disease, ageing, and pain.

Following a mandate imposed by the Core requiring all humans undergo patterning as a public health measure, a rebellion ensued among those who refused to abandon their natural bodies to join the Core&#x27;s transition to an entirely machine society. Fleeing the developed Core worlds, the rebels established themselves in the remote rimward regions of the galaxy, coming to be known as the Arm. As hostilities escalated, the Core began duplicating their greatest military minds to mass-produce sentient war machines, and the Arm countered this buildup with a campaign of cloning bioengineered pilots for theirs; a war that would last four thousand years began.

The game&#x27;s two campaigns focus on their respective sides&#x27; last remaining military leaders, their Commanders. Each Commander pilots a towering, bipedal battlemech bearing an arsenal of weapons, a powerful antimatter reactor, and enough advanced nanotechnology to enable a single Commander to fabricate an entire planetary invasion force on-site. The story of either the Core or the Arm campaign starts with an effort to defend the faction&#x27;s homeworld from a decisive sneak-attack and initiate a turning point in the overall war. The player then fights a series of battles on a number of planets and moons, linked through a series of faster-than-light Galactic Gates. These Gates are complex to engineer and require extravagant energy resources to operate, so FTL invasions typically consist of a sole Commander who proceeds alone or with only minimal escort, and bootstraps a military-industrial infrastructure on the far end. However, the element of surprise gained by the rapidity of these invasions has been sufficient to turn the tide of the war.

As the player progresses, more units become available for construction, either through the course of the story or upon completion of a mission centered on the unit in question. Mission objectives include protecting a vital structure or area, eliminating all enemy units, capturing a pivotal enemy unit, or seizing a Galactic Gate. The worlds upon which the player wages warfare force the player to adapt to different strategies; for example, deployment on a world whose surface is entirely composed of archipelagos necessitates the construction of an effective navy. Some have salient meteorological conditions, such as low variable elevation and high wind speeds, making wind power extremely economical; while others lack an atmosphere, rendering certain forms of aeronautics unusable; dangerous electromagnetic storms or meteor showers occur on others. Once highly urbanised planets lack major crustal metal deposits, these having been long-ago mined out, and instead mass must be actively reclaimed from the ruins of destroyed cities. Both campaigns include 25 missions, the final mission ending the war with a final strike on the enemy&#x27;s homeworld either the Arm&#x27;s bucolic Empyrrean or the Core&#x27;s artificial Jupiter Brain world of Core Prime.

==Expansions==
===Downloadable content===
Starting in 1997 Cavedog began offering additional free downloadable content for &quot;Total Annihilation&quot;, adding new units, maps, and scenarios over time.

===&quot;The Core Contingency&quot;===
Cavedog released &quot;The Core Contingency&quot; a year after the release of &quot;Total Annihilation&quot;. It features 25 new missions as well as 75 new units. It continues the story after the ending of the Arm campaign. The expansion also comes with the &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; editor, which allows users to create maps and missions.

===&quot;Battle Tactics&quot;===
A month after &quot;The Core Contingency&quot;, &quot;Battle Tactics&quot; was released, which includes four new units, 100 additional missions as well an experimental approach to &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; gameplay, with less emphasis on base construction.

===Engine remakes===
&quot;Spring Engine&quot; is an open source General Public License engine made for real time strategy games and features games based on &quot;Total Annihilation&quot;. The engine is multi-platform and features lua scripting to make almost every aspect of the engine customizable. It features online, lan and offline playing.

&quot;Total Annihilation 3D&quot; is a fan-made 3D real-time strategy game engine created with the purpose of directly moving &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; over to a three dimensional plane. The engine has a Microsoft Windows and Linux version, and is programmed in OpenGL and C++. While the engines focus is to recreate the engine and gameplay of &quot;Total Annihilation&quot;, the engine supports a range of mods. TA3D uses &quot;Total Annihilation&quot;&#x27;s Original 3D game assets. TA3D is created under the General Public License (GPL).

&quot;Robot War Engine&quot; is an open-source real-time strategy game engine that is &quot;highly compatible with TA data files&quot;. It is intended to replicate what &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; does with the original game data, but without some of the limits that &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; has. As of 2019, RWE had progressed through several stages.

==Soundtrack==
The game has an original orchestral soundtrack composed by Jeremy Soule and performed by the 95-piece Northwest Sinfonia orchestra. The music changes according to events: during a battle, louder and more frantic music plays. During post-battle damage repair or idle construction, a more ambient and mysterious track is played. The game disc includes the original soundtrack in CD-audio format, which can be played on standard CD players. An ordinary music CD can be inserted once the game is under way and can replace the original game music with its own tracks. It is even possible to program such custom CD tracks to the various battlefield situations (conflict, construction, defeat, etc.) like the default set.

==Reception==
===Sales===
&quot;Total Annihilation&quot; received a global marketing effort at launch, and was concurrently released in 14 countries with English, French and German localizations. In the United States, it debuted at #19 on PC Data&#x27;s computer game sales chart for September 1997. It rose to 15th place the following month, at an average retail price of $48, but was absent from PC Data&#x27;s top 20 by November. Shipments to retailers worldwide had reached 250,000 units by the end of October, and an analyst for Merrill Lynch noted that the game was performing well by the start of December, which she felt was a positive sign for GT Interactive&#x27;s financial recovery at the time. &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; ultimately sold-through 83,900 copies in the United States by the end of 1997, according to PC Data. &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; reported that this performance set it behind rival &quot;Age of Empires&quot; over the same period, but ahead of Activision&#x27;s &quot;Dark Reign: The Future of War&quot;.

Geoff Keighley later wrote, &quot;Cavedog will not release specific sales figures for the game [... but] best estimates from insiders place the sales at well in excess of half a million copies&quot;. It sold over 1.5 million copies by 2002.

===Critical reviews===
The game was highly praised by critics, and won numerous awards, including GameSpot&#x27;s Game of the Year Award for 1997. It won GameSpy&#x27;s Top Ten Real-Time Strategy Games of All Time in 2004, leaving &quot;StarCraft&quot; in second place. It was also named in GameSpot&#x27;s 50-game &quot;The Greatest Games of All Time&quot; list in 2010. The editors stated &quot;It&#x27;s not as famous as &quot;Warcraft&quot; or &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;, but &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; is arguably better than any other real-time strategy game to date.&quot; Overall, &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; received aggregated scores of 86 out of 100 from Metacritic and 89% from GameRankings.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;&quot;Total Annihilation&quot; will certainly reign as king of the realtime strategies, at least for now. It&#x27;s expandable, and if the marketing hype proves true, new abilities for the units should get added in by both expansion packs and downloadable patches. So if you&#x27;re looking for something that doesn&#x27;t mimic &quot;C&amp;C&quot; to a fault but gives you a lot of realtime challenge and variation, this is the place to go.&quot; &quot;GamePro&quot; said it &quot;stands out by providing a deep challenge and excellent replay value.&quot; Like &quot;Next Generation&quot;, they expressed excitement over the promised updates, also praising the line-of-sight features and soundtrack, though they found the unit A.I. demands close supervision from the player.

&quot;Total Annihilation&quot; was a finalist for &quot;PC Strategy Game of the Year&quot; during the AIAS&#x27; inaugural Interactive Achievement Awards, which ultimately went to &quot;StarCraft&quot; and &quot;Age of Empires&quot; (in a tie). &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; was a runner-up for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 1997 &quot;Strategy Game of the Year&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;&quot;.

In 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; as number 49 on their &quot;Top 50 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that, &quot;Unique innovations such as the field commander, unit waypoints, and true line of sight based on elevation enabled a new level of depth in an overcrowded genre, and made &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; a standout in the great glut of realtime strategies.&quot;

===Awards===
&quot;Total Annihilation&quot; has won several awards, including:
* The number one Real-Time Strategy Game of all time, GameSpy 2004
* 1997 Game of the Year, GameSpot
* Best Strategy Game of 1997, GameSpot
* Best Multiplayer Game 1997, GameSpot

<text>Cavedog Entertainment was a PC game developer and publisher based in Bothell, Washington. Founded in 1995 as a division of edutainment game developer Humongous Entertainment, Cavedog was known for the 1997 release of &quot;Total Annihilation&quot;—which won several accolades, such as multiple &quot;Game of the Year&quot; honors—considered one of the &quot;greatest games of all time&quot; in 2004 by &quot;GameSpot&quot;.

== History ==

=== Early days ===
Cavedog Entertainment was a label created in 1995 by Humongous Entertainment, a developer of children&#x27;s video games founded by Ron Gilbert and Shelley Day, to pursue the creation of mainstream games. Humongous Entertainment was originally independent, but was purchased in 1996 by GT Interactive.

In the same year Squaresoft closed its office in Redmond, many of their former developers were hired for Cavedog, notably game music composer Jeremy Soule and graphics designer Clayton Kauzlaric, who created the logo for Cavedog. After two years of development on Cavedog&#x27;s first product, &quot;Total Annihilation&quot;, it was presented at the 1997 E3 in Atlanta, and published on September 30, 1997.

=== After &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; ===
&quot;Total Annihilation&#x27;s&quot; creator, Chris Taylor, left the company shortly before the release of the &quot;Core Contingency&quot; expansion pack to found his own development house, Gas Powered Games. Cavedog released one more expansion pack, &quot;Battle Tactics&quot;, as well as many freely downloadable enhancements and patches, and built strong community support with their own online service, Boneyards (now shut down), that matched opponents and provided a continuing game campaign.

In 1999, Cavedog released &quot;Total Annihilation: Kingdoms,&quot; largely reusing the &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; game engine, but replacing the science-fiction theme with a fantasy one. &quot;Kingdoms&quot; did not resonate as well with critics or fans of the original title. One expansion pack was released, &quot;The Iron Plague&quot;.

=== Closure ===
The closure of Cavedog came as the game industry began to experience a downturn in sales, to which parent company GT Interactive was affected. Besides the &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; franchise, Cavedog had three other ambitious games in development, but only &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; and the related &quot;Kingdoms&quot; made it to store shelves, and their sales were much smaller than their user base.

The unfinished projects were: &quot;&quot;, a first-person shooter; &quot;Elysium&quot;, a fantasy adventure title; and &quot;Good &amp; Evil&quot;, an adventure title from Ron Gilbert. With GT Interactive spiraling into debt and no ship dates in sight, all three were discontinued by the fall of 1999.

GT Interactive was purchased by Infogrames and the Cavedog label was discarded by Humongous Entertainment in 2000, which renewed its focus on children&#x27;s games. Cavedog declared bankruptcy in 2000. Humongous Entertainment was shut down in 2005 by Infogrames (now called Atari). Cavedog&#x27;s developers have played significant roles at Gas Powered Games and Beep Industries.

<text>Trinity Anglican School (TAS) is an independent, Anglican, co-educational, P-12 school, located in the Cairns suburb of White Rock, in Far North Queensland, Australia. It is administered by Independent Schools Queensland, with an enrolment of 1,062 students and a teaching staff of 88, as of 2023. The school serves students from Prep to Year 12, over three campuses set over two grounds. TAS White Rock caters for students from Kindergarten through to Year 12, and TAS Kewarra Beach serves students from Kindergarten to Year 6.

== History ==
The school opened on 25 January 1983.

In 2015, TAS White Rock opened the Science Technology Engineering Mathematics (STEM) building (S-Block) designed by Charles Wright Architects, for students in Years 7 to 12. The White Rock campus&#x27; also have the first Olympic-sized swimming pool in Cairns, completed in 2000. TAS White Rock is currently undergoing a comprehensive renovation programme of the older classrooms to bring it into line with that of the recent Science Block.

== Houses ==
Trinity Anglican School, in a tradition common to many schools in Britain and Commonwealth countries, has a house system that groups students across age- and academic-levels for certain co-curricular activities. Cultural, academic, and sporting activities are, in-part, channeled and encouraged through house involvement, and achievement rewarded by group recognition. The four houses of TAS and their corresponding colours are, Leichhardt – yellow / gold; Mulligan – red; Kennedy – green; and Dalrymple – blue. They are named after four prominent explorers.

== Alumni ==
Catriona Gray, the winner of Miss Universe 2018, was a student at Trinity Anglican School.

<text>Logitech International S.A. ( ) is a Swiss multinational manufacturer of computer peripherals and software. Headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, the company has offices throughout Europe, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas, and is one of the world&#x27;s leading manufacturers of input and interface devices for personal computers (PCs) and other digital products. It is a component of the flagship Swiss Market Index, and listed on the Nasdaq.

The company develops and markets personal peripherals for PC navigation, video communication and collaboration, music and smart homes. This includes products like keyboards, mice, tablet accessories, headphones and headsets, webcams, Bluetooth speakers, universal remotes and more. Its name is derived from &quot;logiciel&quot; (the French word for software) and &#x27;tech&#x27;.

== History ==

Logitech was founded in Apples, Vaud, Switzerland, in 1981, by Daniel &quot;Bobo&quot; Borel, Pierluigi Zappacosta, and former Olivetti engineer Giacomo Marini. Swiss-born Borel and Italian-born Zappacosta had met in California while taking electrical engineering classes in the late 1970s at Stanford University, under professors such as Ethernet inventor Robert Metcalfe. Returning to Europe, they began working on new ideas near Romanel-sur-Morges, Switzerland, and they brought in the Italian engineer Marini to round out the new company. Borel served as chairman of the board, focused on sales and manufacturing, and he was chief executive officer (CEO) for most of the 1990s. Zappacosta served as president and a period as CEO, and he oversaw research. He left Logitech in 1997 to lead Digital Persona, a biometrics company.

The company founders first concentrated on creating word processing software for a large Swiss company, but the company canceled the project. Next, they turned to the computer mouse as an essential component of the graphical user interface used by a workstation requested by the Japanese company Ricoh. Logitech&#x27;s first mouse, the P4 model, was produced in 1982 in Switzerland, based on an opto-mechanical design by Swiss inventor Jean-Daniel Nicoud working at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne).

One of Logitech&#x27;s offices was at 165 University Avenue, Palo Alto, California, US, home to a number of noted technology startups in the birthplace of Silicon Valley. In 1984, Logitech won a contract to supply Hewlett-Packard with computer mice in the role of original equipment manufacturer (OEM). The mice that Logitech supplied to HP were made in a new factory in Fremont, California, and they were branded HP: they did not display the Logitech name. In the early-to-mid-1980s, Logitech stopped making mice in Switzerland, instead opening factories in Cork, Ireland, and Hsinchu, Taiwan, in addition to the Fremont location.

Logitech created the first wireless mouse in 1984, using infrared (IR) light to connect to the Metaphor Computer Systems workstation developed by David Liddle and Donald Massaro, former Xerox PARC engineers. The Metaphor&#x27;s keyboard was also IR wireless. The consumer IR connection scheme required a clear line of sight for data transfer, and did not work well on a cluttered desk. The wireless mouse did not gain widespread adoption until 1991 when Logitech introduced the first mouse based on a radio frequency connection, not limited to line-of-sight. 

In 1985, Swiss inventor René Sommer developed microprocessor circuitry for the wired mouse, making it more responsive to human movement. Logitech incorporated a Sommer-style CMOS microprocessor in their first retail mouse product, the rectangular three-button serial C7 product released in 1985, selling for $99 (). The next wired mouse model, the S9 released in 1989, was curved to fit the human hand, and it carried the Logitech logo for the first time.

In 1988, Logitech incorporated as Logitech International SA with an initial public offering (IPO) on the Zürich stock exchange. In 1989, Logitech produced its first trackball product, the TrackMan. Also in 1989, the company was nominated for &quot;PC Mag&quot; Technical Excellence Award for the patented development tool Multiscope Debugger. The application was written for OS/2, followed by versions for the DOS and Windows 3.0 operating systems. Logitech won the award in January 1990.

Logitech re-organized their manufacturing in 1994, shutting down Fremont operations and opening a major facility in Suzhou, China. The Cork, Ireland, location downsized to become an R&amp;D center, and the Hsinchu, Taiwan, factory was kept only for test runs and prototypes. Logitech bought the Connectix webcam division in 1998 for $25 million, then released QuickCam, the first webcam with an integrated microphone. By the year 2000, Logitech was the leader in global sales of webcams, with about four million units sold.
In 2001, Logitech acquired Labtec for $150 million in order to expand its range of computer peripherals.

In 2007, Logitech licensed Hillcrest Labs&#x27; Freespace motion control technology to produce the MX Air Mouse, which allows a user to use natural gestures to control a PC.

In August 2010, Logitech acquired Ultimate Ears, supplier of custom in-ear monitors for professional musicians and Bluetooth speakers for the consumer market.

In December 2008, Logitech announced that it had produced its one-billionth computer mouse since beginning production in 1985.

In December 2009, Logitech acquired video conferencing equipment maker Lifesize Communications.

In July 2011, Logitech acquired the mobile visual communications provider Mirial.

In January 2013, Bracken Darrell became Logitech&#x27;s chief executive officer; then-CEO Guerrino De Luca continued as Logitech&#x27;s chairman of the board.

In January 2016, Logitech spun off the video conferencing equipment maker Lifesize.

In April 2016, Logitech agreed to pay a $7.5 million penalty following allegations that the company and certain former executives improperly inflated its financial results for the 2011 fiscal year to meet earnings guidance, along with other accounting violations. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission stated that these accounting irregularities misrepresented the Swiss company&#x27;s financial position, depriving investors of an accurate assessment of its performance.

On 12 April 2016, Logitech announced that they had agreed to acquire Jaybird, a leader in wireless audio wearables for sports and active lifestyles, for , with an additional earnout of up to based on achievement of growth targets.

On 15 September 2016, Logitech announced that they had purchased the Saitek brand and assets from Mad Catz for .

On 25 March 2017, Logitech signed a multi-year sponsorship deal with McLaren as the Official Technology Peripherals Partner. The deal would later be extended to McLaren&#x27;s eSports endeavours under the Logitech G brand in 2020. 

On 11 August 2017, Logitech acquired Astro Gaming, makers of professional gaming equipment (mainly headsets), for .

On 25 May 2018, Logitech acquired Beyond Entertainment, an esports live broadcasting and digital media company, for an undisclosed amount.

On 30 July 2018, Logitech announced that they had purchased Blue Microphones for .

On 26 September 2019, Logitech acquired Streamlabs, producer of software and tools for live-streaming, for approximately $89 million. 

On 29 July 2021, Logitech, in collaboration with choreographer JaQuel Knight, introduced its #Creators4BIPOC initiative under the Logitech For Creators brand. It allows social media creators, particularly BIPOC influencers, to copyright and monetize their online creations by making it possible for choreographers who amplify attention to hits by major artists in the entertainment business to secure copyright of their choreography using Labanotation and earn royalties from it.

In June 2023, Bracken Darrell (former CEO) left Logitech and board member Guy Gecht took over as interim CEO. 

On 18 July 2023, Logitech announced the acquisition of streaming controller maker Loupedeck for an undisclosed sum.

On 30 October 2023, Logitech announced that Hanneke Faber would be taking over as the new CEO beginning December 1, 2023. Faber was previously group President at Unilever.

== Production ==
The first Logitech mice, starting from the P4, were made in Le Lieu, in the Swiss Canton of Vaud by Dubois Dépraz SA.

Production facilities were then established in the United States, Taiwan, Hungary and Ireland before being moved to Suzhou, China. , the manufacturing operations in China produce approximately half of Logitech&#x27;s products. The remaining production is outsourced to contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers in Asia.

<text>33 (thirty-three) is the natural number following 32 and preceding 34.

==In mathematics==
33 is the 21st composite number, and 8th distinct semiprime (third of the form formula_1 where formula_2 is a higher prime). It is one of two numbers to have an aliquot sum of 15 = 3 × 5 — the other being the square of 4 — and part of the aliquot sequence of 9 = 32 in the aliquot tree (33, 15, 9, 4, 3, 2, 1). 

It is the largest positive integer that cannot be expressed as a sum of different triangular numbers, and it is the largest of twelve integers that are not the sum of five non-zero squares; on the other hand, the 33rd triangular number 561 is the first Carmichael number. 33 is also the first non-trivial dodecagonal number (like 369, and 561) and the first non-unitary centered dodecahedral number.

It is also the sum of the first four positive factorials, and the sum of the sum of the divisors of the first six positive integers; respectively:
formula_3

It is the first member of the first cluster of three semiprimes 33, 34, 35; the next such cluster is 85, 86, 87. It is also the smallest integer such that it and the next two integers all have the same number of divisors (four).

33 is the number of unlabeled planar simple graphs with five nodes.

There are only five regular polygons that are used to tile the plane uniformly (the triangle, square, hexagon, octagon, and dodecagon); the total number of sides in these is: 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 33.

33 is equal to the sum of the squares of the digits of its own square in nonary (14409), hexadecimal (44116) and unotrigesimal (14431). For numbers greater than 1, this is a rare property to have in more than one base. It is also a palindrome in both decimal and binary (100001).

33 was the second to last number less than 100 whose representation as a sum of three cubes was found (in 2019):
formula_4

33 is the sum of the only three locations formula_5 in the set of integers formula_6 where the ratio of primes to composite numbers is one-to-one (up to formula_5) — at, 9, 11, and 13; the latter two represent the fifth and sixth prime numbers, with formula_8 the fourth composite. On the other hand, the ratio of prime numbers to non-primes at 33 in the sequence of natural numbers formula_9 is formula_10, where there are (inclusively) 11 prime numbers and 22 non-primes (i.e., when including 1).

Where 33 is the seventh number divisible by the number of prime numbers below it (eleven), the product formula_11 is the seventh numerator of harmonic number formula_12, where specifically, the previous such numerators are 49 and 137, which are respectively the thirty-third composite and prime numbers.

33 is the fifth ceiling of imaginary parts of zeros of the Riemann zeta function, that is also its nearest integer, from an approximate value of formula_13

Written in base-ten, the decimal expansion in the approximation for pi, formula_14, has 0 as its 33rd digit, the first such single-digit string.

A positive definite quadratic integer matrix represents all odd numbers when it contains &quot;at least&quot; the set of seven integers: formula_15

== In religion and mythology ==
* Islamic prayer beads are generally arranged in sets of 33, corresponding to the widespread use of this number in dhikr rituals. Such beads may number 33 in total or three distinct sets of 33 for a total of 99, corresponding to the names of God.
* 33 is a master number in New Age numerology, along with 11 and 22.

<text>78 (seventy-eight) is the natural number following 77 and preceding 79.

==In mathematics==

78 is:

*the 5th discrete tri-prime; or also termed Sphenic number, and the 4th of the form (2.3.r).
*an abundant number with an aliquot sum of 90; within an aliquot sequence of nine composite numbers (78, 90,144,259,45,33,15,9,4,3,1,0) to the Prime in the 3-aliquot tree.
*a semiperfect number, as a multiple of a perfect number.
*the 12th triangular number.
*a palindromic number in bases 5 (3035), 7 (1417), 12 (6612), 25 (3325), and 38 (2238).
*a Harshad number in bases 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13 and 14.
*an Erdős–Woods number, since it is possible to find sequences of 78 consecutive integers such that each inner member shares a factor with either the first or the last member.
*the dimension of the exceptional Lie group E6 and several related objects.
*the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of four distinct nonzero squares in more than one way: formula_1, formula_2 or formula_3 (see image).

77 and 78 form a Ruth–Aaron pair.
