<text>The Virginia Pep Band was a student-run musical ensemble at the University of Virginia (UVA). In the tradition of scatter or scramble bands, like those at Stanford, Rice and the Ivy League, the Pep Band preferred irreverent humor and individuality to marching in uniform formations. Founded in 1974, this group of students served as UVa&#x27;s band supporting athletics in an official capacity until 2003. After being banned from official athletic events in 2003, the group continued to perform at sporting events such as swimming, field hockey, and ice hockey. The ensemble has also performed at Charlottesville community events including the Charlottesville 10-miler, the Alzheimer&#x27;s Walk, and the United Way Day of Caring.

==History==

The earliest appearance of the organization which became the Virginia Pep Band was in 1909, when the &quot;East Lawn Chowder Society&quot; appeared in the University of Virginia yearbook, &quot;Corks and Curls&quot;. The East Lawn Chowder Society was a secret society that engaged in general tomfoolery, often involving their rivals, the West Lawn Chowder Society. Later, the East Lawn Society formed a band, which evolved over time into the most recently recognized format. The style and appearance of the organization has changed over time; at some point it even performed a traditional marching band style as the University of Virginia Marching Band (this is why both &quot;award-winning&quot; and &quot;marching&quot; appear in the band&#x27;s name). In the fall of 1974, under the leadership of Stephen F. Mershon, Hugh Riley, and Franklin Seney, the band adopted the Ivy League scramble band style, beginning the modern era of the band. In the early scramble-band seasons, the band did, in fact, march for the opening and closing numbers in more-or-less straight lines. Marching was later abandoned entirely. The one thing common to all of the current group&#x27;s predecessors was student governance—complete control by its members rather than University faculty. 

===The &quot;Revolution of &#x27;93&quot;===

In 1993, UVa&#x27;s then–athletic director, Jim Copeland, announced that the Pep Band would be run by a professional band director. In response, the band went on strike, and its leaders argued they were standing up for student self-governance. Called the &quot;Revolution of &#x27;93&quot; by Pep Band members, the clash with the athletic department garnered national attention. Columns and letters in news sources such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;USA Today&quot; addressed the conflict.

During the strike, the athletic department replaced the Pep Band with a faculty-run group called the &quot;UVa Sports Band,&quot; a 24-member band which included several hired musicians. The Sports Band proved unpopular with fans, and was introduced at Scott Stadium only once (when it was resoundingly booed). During this game, Pep Band members protested on &quot;The Hill&quot;. The athletic department reinstated the Pep Band to athletic events in time for the last home game of the season against Virginia Tech.

===The Expulsion of 2003===
The band&#x27;s performance at the 2002 Continental Tire Bowl prompted West Virginia Governor Bob Wise to demand an apology from the band and the school for its portrayal of West Virginia residents. The show&#x27;s script was the result of student writing followed by Athletics Department censorship and approval, and is available online. The Pep Band was permanently banned from ever playing at the bowl again. This prompted emails and phone calls to the UVa Athletics Department, some suggesting the elimination of the Pep Band and the creation of a university marching band.

In the spring of 2003, after the last issue of the Cavalier Daily was published for the year, the Athletics Department banned the Pep Band from performing at official UVa athletic events. Athletics Department officials locked the Pep Band&#x27;s storage closet without warning, effectively confiscating the band&#x27;s instruments, both University owned and private. The formation of a new marching band, the Cavalier Marching Band, to debut for the 2004 football season was announced, although the 2003 season was left with no official band. The new band would be run by a professional band director and staff, as opposed to the Pep Band, whose director and managing board were elected from among its student members. 

The University of Virginia student council passed a resolution in February 2004 asking for the cooperative &quot;coexistence of two bands,&quot; both the faculty and the student-run organizations. Specifically, they asked for the Pep Band&#x27;s return to athletic events, especially those where the marching band would not perform, but the Athletics Department made no official response to the resolution, leading Pep Band advocates to decry what they saw as an outright dismissal of student governance. The Athletics Department cited several reasons for the change, including fan disinterest in, or fan outrage at, their performances, which were intended to be provocative. Pep Band Director Adam Lorentson said at the time that &quot;cost is the key reason the University does not have a traditional marching band.&quot;

Advocates for the Virginia Pep Band, including some in the Cavalier Daily editorial section, claimed that there was strong student support for the organization and that the administration of the University of Virginia and its Athletics Department were exerting more control over something that was historically student-run. They saw the elimination of a &quot;student-run&quot; band as a departure from what they considered to be the Jeffersonian ideals of self-government and freedom of speech that the University of Virginia inherited from its founder. They point out that all the scripts for their performances had been approved by the UVa Athletics Department and, in the case of the Tire Bowl, by the bowl officials themselves. Some columnists downplayed the offensiveness of the band&#x27;s performances; one Washington Post columnist wrote that the Pep Band was &quot;banned not for the crime of political incorrectness, but for the potential to possibly, just maybe, somehow, somewhere, some day commit it.&quot;

Despite the ban, the Pep Band remained active from 2003 to 2011, performing its traditional roles in Charlottesville events and supporting University of Virginia student athletes outside the jurisdiction of the athletic department, such as at club sporting events. For some years on football game day, the Pep Band performed regularly for the UVa Alumni Association at Alumni Hall, as well as performing what they call a &quot;pre-game scramble&quot; for tailgating fans outside Scott Stadium. They also performed for the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League and the Washington Nationals of Major League Baseball.

==Current status==
The Virginia Pep Band ceased being an official student group at UVa in 2011. The band was incorporated as Virginia Pep Band inc. in 2011, which consists of a board of alumni charged with maintaining the band&#x27;s property and legacy.

<text>In astronomy, a correlation function describes the distribution of galaxies in the universe. By default, &quot;correlation function&quot; refers to the two-point autocorrelation function. The two-point autocorrelation function is a function of one variable (distance); it describes the excess probability of finding two galaxies separated by this distance (excess over and above the probability that would arise if the galaxies were simply scattered independently and with uniform probability). It can be thought of as a &quot;clumpiness&quot; factor - the higher the value for some distance scale, the more &quot;clumpy&quot; the universe is at that distance scale.

The following definition (from Peebles 1980) is often cited: 

: &quot;Given a random galaxy in a location, the correlation function describes the probability that another galaxy will be found within a given distance.&quot;

However, it can only be correct in the statistical sense that it is averaged over a large number of galaxies chosen as the first, &quot;random&quot; galaxy. If just one &quot;random&quot; galaxy is chosen, then the definition is no longer correct, firstly because it is meaningless to talk of just one &quot;random&quot; galaxy, and secondly because the function will vary wildly depending on which galaxy is chosen, in contradiction with its definition as a function.

Assuming the universe is isotropic (which observations suggest), the correlation function is a function of a scalar distance. The two-point correlation function can then be written as
formula_1
where formula_2 is a unitless measure of overdensity, defined at every point. Letting formula_3, it can also be expressed as the integral
formula_4

The spatial correlation function formula_5 is related to the Fourier space power spectrum of the galaxy distribution, formula_6, as
formula_7

The &quot;n&quot;-point autocorrelation functions for &quot;n&quot; greater than 2 or cross-correlation functions for particular object types are defined similarly to the two-point autocorrelation function.

The correlation function is important for theoretical models of physical cosmology because it provides a means of testing models which assume different things about the contents of the universe.

<doc id="294873" wikidata="Q965920" url="?curid=294873" title="Scott Shriner">
<text>Scott Gardner Shriner (born July 11, 1965) is an American musician best known as a member of the rock band Weezer, with whom he has recorded twelve studio albums. Joining the band in 2001, Shriner is the band&#x27;s longest serving bass guitarist.

Prior to his musical career, Shriner was a member of the U.S. Marine Corps. At the age of twenty-five, he moved to Los Angeles, California to pursue a career in music, attending the Musicians Institute. Shriner subsequently performed with multiple independent acts, and toured as a member of Vanilla Ice&#x27;s backing band, in support of the rapper&#x27;s nu metal album &quot;Hard to Swallow.&quot;

In 2001, Shriner joined Weezer on a provisional basis, following the sudden departure of bass guitarist Mikey Welsh, who had left the band for personal reasons. Upon becoming Welsh&#x27;s full-time replacement, Shriner made his recording debut on the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Maladroit&quot; (2002).

During the band&#x27;s tour in support of its fifth studio album, &quot;Make Believe&quot; (2005), Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo would at times relinquish his role as lead vocalist to allow Shriner, and his bandmates, Brian Bell and Patrick Wilson, to sing lead vocals on specific songs. This increased vocal responsibility carried over to the band&#x27;s 2008 self-titled release (aka the &quot;Red Album&quot;), where Shriner co-wrote &quot;Cold Dark World&quot; and performed lead vocals on &quot;Cold Dark World&quot; and &quot;King&quot;.

Shriner also performed in his bandmate Patrick Wilson&#x27;s side-project The Special Goodness for some time.

==Early life==
Shriner was born in Toledo, Ohio. He took up bass in high school. After being discharged from the U.S. Marine Corps, he found his high school bass teacher Mark Kieswetter, with whom he studied until moving to Los Angeles in 1989. While in Toledo, Shriner and his best friend Rob Weaver started a band called the Seventh Wave with former Newles members Bob Schramm and Bill Whitman. Shriner went on to play with several Toledo bands, namely the Movers, the Fever, the Theresa Harris Band, and Loved by Millions. He then finished his Toledo music experience with Tim Gahagen, Matt Donahue and Brad Coffin in a band called the Great Barbeque Gods.

Shriner also worked at the bittersweet farms non profit organization in the early 90s. Shriner moved to Los Angeles, California at the age of 25 to attend Musicians Institute and went on to play in several bands including Broken, Bomber, Black Elvis, Mystery Train, Electric Love Hogs, Crown and, most notably, Vanilla Ice&#x27;s backing band, in support of the rapper&#x27;s nu metal album &quot;Hard to Swallow&quot;.

==Weezer==
In the summer of 2001, Shriner joined Weezer on a provisional basis. Following the departure of their second bassist, Mikey Welsh (who left the band due to personal problems), Shriner was made their full-time bassist. In his first show with Weezer, the 2001 KROQ-FM Inland Invasion, he was attacked by a man later found out to be a friend of his, yet continued to play on as security guards pried the man off his back.

According to Shriner, Rivers Cuomo had initially stated that Shriner was &quot;never&quot; going to be a member of the band, as he was just filling in until Welsh returned. It was only during the photo shoot for the &quot;Maladroit&quot; album artwork that Shriner realized that he was officially a member of Weezer, having previously only been told to show up for gigs and recording. Shriner became Weezer&#x27;s third bassist, and the longest-running bassist in Weezer history; he has appeared on twelve of Weezer&#x27;s fifteen studio albums.

On Weezer&#x27;s third self-titled album, he co-wrote and sang lead vocals on &quot;Cold Dark World,&quot; sang lead vocals on &quot;King&quot; (a deluxe edition track), and sang most of the lead vocals for the band&#x27;s covers of &quot;The Weight&quot; by the Band and &quot;Oddfellows Local 151&quot; by R.E.M.
In 2005, he sang lead vocals on Weezer songs &quot;In the Garage,&quot; &quot;Dope Nose,&quot; and &quot;Fall Together.&quot; In 2008, during the band&#x27;s Hootenanny Tour, he sang lead vocals on a cover of &quot;Creep&quot; by Radiohead. On the band&#x27;s 2008 Troublemaker Tour, he sang &quot;Perfect Situation&quot; and &quot;My Name is Jonas&quot;, which he sings in a three-way lead vocal second, with Patrick Wilson and Rivers Cuomo singing lead vocals first and last respectively. He also played on the band&#x27;s EP &quot;The Lion and the Witch&quot; and numerous B-sides and demos which can be found on the internet. He has also played shows with Patrick Wilson&#x27;s band The Special Goodness.

On April 11, 2018, several days prior to the Cars&#x27; performance at their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction on April 14, Shriner announced that he would perform with the band. Shriner had previously worked with the Cars leader Ric Ocasek when Ocasek produced the 2014 Weezer album &quot;Everything Will Be Alright in the End&quot;.

In 2020, Shriner voiced himself in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Hateful Eight-Year-Olds&quot;, along with the rest of Weezer.

==Equipment==
Shriner&#x27;s primary bass guitars are his 1960 and 1962 Fender Precision Bass guitars, and an Electrical Guitar Company Custom Bass; he can also be seen playing Lakland and Warwick Thumb, and more recently, a Rickenbacker bass. His rig setup consists of an early 70&#x27;s Ampeg SVT Head and Mesa Boogie 8x10 and 4x12 cabinets. For distortion, Scott uses an Electro-Harmonix bass big muff pi. Scott also uses Shure in-ear monitors.

==Personal life==
On November 9, 2005, Shriner married Jillian Lauren, author and former member of the harem of Prince Jefri Bolkiah of Brunei, in Hawaii. The couple have two adopted children. They have two dogs, Peanut and Calvin, both of whom appeared in a PETA video encouraging people to adopt from shelters.

He guest-starred with the band the Scrantones at the 2007 &quot;The Office&quot; convention. During this performance, the band played Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Creep&quot; with &quot;The Office&quot;&#x27;s Craig Robinson on vocals.

In June 2009, Scott guest-starred with E.J. Wells in a music video of Wells&#x27; &quot;There&#x27;s Something In The Graveyard,&quot; which is the first music video ever filmed in the historic Virginia City Cemetery, in Virginia City, Nevada.

He is a fan of Elvis Costello, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and Black Sabbath.

<text>Matthew Kelly Sharp (born September 22, 1969) is an American singer-songwriter and musician. Until 1998, he was the bassist for the rock band Weezer, which he co-founded in 1992. He appears on their first two albums, the &quot;Blue Album&quot; (1994) and &quot;Pinkerton&quot; (1996). In 1994, Sharp founded Rentals, who have released five albums. Sharp has also released an EP and an album as a solo artist.

==Early life==
Matt Sharp was born in Bangkok, Thailand, to American parents on September 22, 1969. The family moved to Arlington, Virginia, when he was one year old. At the age of nine, he made his first musical purchase, a 45 rpm single of the song &quot;Le Freak&quot; by Chic. 
At sixteen, he moved to San Diego.

In 1989, Sharp started fronting a goth band, the Clique, which lasted less than a year. A few months after the Clique disbanded, Sharp befriended the drummer Patrick Wilson, with whom he created the band 60 Wrong Sausages. The guitarist Jason Cropper soon joined. Around this time, Wilson was also in another band, Fuzz, with the guitarist and vocalist Rivers Cuomo. For a brief period, Cuomo, Wilson and Sharp shared an apartment. During this time, Sharp worked as a telemarketer.

== Career ==

=== 1991–1999: Weezer and the Rentals ===
In mid-1991, Sharp moved north to Berkeley, California, to pursue what the Weezer collaborator Karl Koch described as &quot;some sorta symphonic keyboard sequencing music&quot;. In January 1992, Wilson showed Sharp material he and Cuomo had been working on. Impressed, Sharp returned to Los Angeles to join the band. Sharp became the group&#x27;s bassist and de facto manager.

Cuomo, Wilson, Sharp and Cropper formed Weezer in 1992. Their first show was on March 19, 1992, closing for Keanu Reeves&#x27; band Dogstar. Cuomo gave Sharp one year to get the band a record deal before Cuomo accepted a scholarship at the University of California, Berkeley. In November, Weezer recorded a demo, &quot;The Kitchen Tape&quot;, including a version of the future Weezer single &quot;Say It Ain&#x27;t So&quot;. The demo was heard by Todd Sullivan, an A&amp;R man at Geffen Records, who signed Weezer in June 1993.

Weezer released their self-titled debut album in May 1994. It was certified platinum in January 1995. In early 1994, Sharp founded the Rentals. They released their debut album, &quot;Return of the Rentals,&quot; the following year, which featured the radio hit &quot;Friends of P&quot;. Weezer&#x27;s second album, &quot;Pinkerton&quot;, was released in September 1996. With a darker, more abrasive sound, &quot;Pinkerton&quot; was a commercial and critical failure, but attained critical acclaim later. Following the mixed response to &quot;Pinkerton&quot;, Weezer went on a five-year hiatus. 

In 1998, Sharp left Weezer due to differences with the band members. In 2016, he said of his departure: &quot;I don&#x27;t really know how to speak on this because I don&#x27;t know what should be kept private and what should be shared. I certainly have my view of it, as I&#x27;m sure everybody else has their sort of foggy things. When you have a group that doesn&#x27;t communicate, you&#x27;re going to have a whole lot of different stories.&quot;

In 1999, the Rentals released their second album, &quot;Seven More Minutes&quot;. Among its contributors were Damon Albarn (of Blur and Gorillaz), Donna Matthews (of Elastica), Miki Berenyi (of Lush), and Tim Wheeler (of Ash). Maya Rudolph (later of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;) was a member of the touring band during this time. The track &quot;My Head is in the Sun&quot; was co-written with Cuomo. The album sold considerably less than &quot;Return of the Rentals&quot;, and the Rentals went on hiatus in late 1999.

=== 2000–2003: Solo records and Weezer lawsuit ===
Sharp moved to the town of Leiper&#x27;s Fork, Tennessee, and began recording. In an interview with MTV News, Sharp said he was trying to cut ties to the music world. Sharp went on an acoustic tour in 2002 with former Cake guitarist Greg Brown. In 2003, after a four-year hiatus, Sharp returned with an EP, &quot;Puckett&#x27;s Versus the Country Boy&quot;.

On April 19, 2002, Sharp filed a five-count federal lawsuit against Weezer. He alleged he was owed royalties for co-writing Weezer&#x27;s first hit, &quot;Undone – The Sweater Song&quot;, and that he owned a 25% interest in the first nine tracks of &quot;Pinkerton&quot;, which had been credited solely to Cuomo despite all four band members working on the album. Sharp also said he had handled most of Weezer&#x27;s business affairs during their early success, including the hiring of accountants and attorneys and securing their record deal. The lawsuit also stated that Cuomo was going to ask Sharp to appear in the music video for their 2001 song &quot;Island in the Sun&quot;. Finally, Sharp additionally charged his former bandmates Patrick Wilson and Brian Bell with breach of fiduciary duty, legal malpractice, dissolution of partnership, and declaratory relief. The lawsuit was settled out of court.

=== 2003–present: Reunion with Cuomo, re-formation of the Rentals ===
In 2003, Sharp released a solo EP, followed by a self-titled solo album in 2004. He continued to tour in 2004–2005 with the band Goldenboy. On February 12, 2004, Cuomo sat in during a solo performance by Sharp at California State University, Fullerton. They played four songs together: the Sharp/Cuomo collaborations &quot;Mrs. Young&quot; and &quot;Time Song&quot;, and the Weezer songs &quot;Say It Ain&#x27;t So&quot; and &quot;Undone&quot;. Sharp announced at the show that he and Cuomo had reunited and would be working on a record together. Later in 2004, Sharp announced on his website that although he and Cuomo had come up with &quot;15 or 16 new song ideas&quot;, their &quot;special brand of dysfunctionality&quot; might keep them from finishing the project.
In March 2004, Sharp recorded synthesizer on &quot;So Jealous&quot; by Canadian indie pop band Tegan and Sara. After a slow period in 2005, Sharp contemplated what to do next, considering either a new solo album or starting a new collaborative partnership. The possibility of him rejoining Weezer was also an option; although this did not happen, in a 2006 interview, Sharp credited these conversations with Cuomo as giving him the idea to return to writing pop music, which eventually led him to re-form the Rentals. These ideas particularly strengthened after meeting Sara Radle. In 2005, six years after 1999&#x27;s &quot;Seven More Minutes&quot;, the Rentals re-formed; the new lineup included original backup vocalist Rachel Haden, Sara Radle, Ben Pringle of Nerf Herder, Lauren Chipman, and Dan Joeright. Sharp and the Rentals toured North America in the summers of 2006 and 2007.

The Rentals released &quot;The Last Little Life EP&quot; on August 14, 2007. Between Rentals tours, Sharp returned to work in early 2007 with Tegan and Sara on their next album, &quot;The Con&quot;, later appearing at their concerts in 2008 to play bass in a cover of Weezer&#x27;s &quot;Tired of Sex&quot;.

After the three releases in the &quot;Songs About Time&quot; series in April, July, and October 2009, Sharp and the Rentals went on hiatus. In October 2010, Sharp sold most of his equipment from his Weezer and Rentals days on eBay. His Orange Matamp Lead 200 was purchased by Greg Veerman, bassist of Canadian rock band San Sebastian. In November 2010, Cuomo mentioned in an interview with &quot;Spin&quot; that &quot;the idea came up&quot; of having Sharp rejoin the band for their &quot;Memories Tour&quot;, in which they play &quot;The Blue Album&quot; and &quot;Pinkerton&quot;. Cuomo said: &quot;I think we left that idea behind pretty early on. I don&#x27;t remember. I wasn&#x27;t involved in the discussion so I don&#x27;t know what the issues were.&quot;

In 2011, Sharp provided guest vocals on the song &quot;FAQ&quot; by Berri Txarrak, a Basque band whose live album &quot;Zertarako Amestu&quot; (2007) had significant influence on &quot;Songs About Time&quot;.

<text>Elephant is the fourth studio album by the American rock duo The White Stripes, released on April 1, 2003, by V2, XL, and Third Man. The album was produced by the band&#x27;s guitarist and lead vocalist Jack White, and continues their &quot;back-to-basics&quot; approach as seen in their previous album, &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; (2001). It was mostly recorded at Maida Vale and Toe Rag Studios across two weeks in April 2002, and was produced without the use of computers, instead utilizing a duct-taped 8 track tape machine and various gear no more recent than 1963. 

&quot;Elephant&quot; peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and topped the UK Albums Chart. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) have certified the album 2× Platinum and 3× Platinum respectively, and over 4 million copies have been sold worldwide. The album spawned the hit singles &quot;The Hardest Button to Button&quot; and &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;, the latter of which became a sports anthem and has continued to experience commercial success. &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Know What to Do with Myself&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s No Home for You Here&quot; were also released as singles.

&quot;Elephant&quot; received widespread acclaim from music critics, and became a defining event of the 2000s garage rock revival. The band earned several accolades for the album, including a nomination for Album of the Year and winning Best Alternative Music Album and Best Rock Song (&quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;) at the 2004 Grammy Awards. It has since been regarded as one of the greatest albums of the 21st century and was ranked number 449 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2020 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Recording==

The White Stripes recorded &quot;Elephant&quot; over two weeks in April through May 2002 in London&#x27;s modest Toe Rag Studios except for the songs &quot;Well It&#x27;s True That We Love One Another&quot; and &quot;Hypnotize&quot;, which were recorded at Toe Rag in November 5, 2001, and &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Know What to Do with Myself&quot;, which was recorded at the BBC&#x27;s Maida Vale Studios on November 13, 2001. On certain releases, &quot;Hypnotize&quot; was mistakenly marked as recorded in April 2002. Most of these recording dates were corrected on the 20th anniversary release.

Jack produced the album with antiquated equipment, including an eight-track tape machine and pre-1960s recording gear. As stated in the liner notes, he did not use computers during &quot;Elephant&quot; writing, recording, or production, and none of the recording equipment was more recent than 1963.

For the track &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;, to replicate a bass-like sound, White connected a semi-acoustic guitar to a DigiTech Whammy pedal (a pitch shift effect), lowering the pitch by an octave. &quot;There&#x27;s No Home for You Here&quot; was made with the idea &quot;to see how far we could go with an eight track recorder, and I think how far we went is too far.&quot; 

Meg White is featured for the first time on leading vocals in the track &quot;In the Cold, Cold Night&quot;, having only performed background vocals for &quot;De Stijl&quot; and &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; previously. Including the song &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Know What to Do with Myself&quot; (a Dusty Springfield/Burt Bacharach cover) in their repertoire was Meg&#x27;s idea, and the band had begun to perform the song live, later recording it for the album.

==Composition==
&quot;Elephant&quot; has been described musically as garage rock revival, blues rock, and punk blues. In this album, the White Stripes expanded their style with a bass line alongside lead and rhythm guitar. Jack played guitar or keyboard to fill out the sound. Like other White Stripes records, the cover art and liner notes are exclusively in red, white, and black. An article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the band attempted to achieve the idea of &quot;Back to Basics&quot; and encourage other rockers to try the same; this was a concept seen on their previous album, &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; (2001). The album&#x27;s lyrical themes revolve around the idea of the &quot;death of the sweetheart&quot; in American culture. 

&quot;You&#x27;ve Got Her in Your Pocket&quot; was written after the release of the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album (1999). Jack had planned on eventually giving it to a local band to cover, but felt it was too personal to give away and recorded it for the album. &quot;Girl, You Have No Faith in Medicine&quot; was originally written for &quot;White Blood Cells&quot;, but it was removed on Meg&#x27;s request, who found the lyrics to be problematic. After a line was omitted, the song was rerecorded for &quot;Elephant&quot;. &quot;Little Acorns&quot; was written after the band had found unused tapes of journalist Mort Crim in a recording studio. Crim said in an interview that &quot;My first thought was, well they&#x27;re just gonna use the words and he&#x27;s gonna build a song around the words, but then the producer said, &#x27;no, no, no, we want to use your voice. We want to actually build a song around your commentary.&#x27;&quot; The resulting song is about preservering through life&#x27;s hardships, and draws comparisons to a &quot;squirrel storing nuts in the winter&quot;. 

==Artwork==
In an interview with &quot;Q Magazine&quot; in 2007, Jack said, &quot;If you study the picture carefully, Meg and I are elephant ears in a head-on elephant. But it&#x27;s a side view of an elephant, too, with the tusks leading off either side.&quot; He went on to say, &quot;I wanted people to be staring at this album cover and then maybe two years later, having stared at it for the 500th time, to say, &#x27;Hey, it&#x27;s an elephant!&#x27;&quot; 

The cryptic symbolism of the album art includes a skull sitting on the floor in the background, as well as peanuts and peanut shells in the foreground, and on the circus travel trunk appears the mark &quot;III,&quot; Jack&#x27;s signature. Jack is displaying a mano cornuta and looking at a light bulb intensely, while Meg is barefoot and appears to be crying, with a rope tied around her ankle and leading out of frame. Both have small white ribbons tied to their fingers. On the reverse side of the U.S. edition, all of the number &quot;3&quot;s are in red (disregarding the authorization notes at the bottom).

The album has been released with at least six different versions of the front cover—different covers for the CD and LP editions in the US, the UK and elsewhere. On the US CD edition, Meg is sitting on the left of a circus travel trunk and Jack is sitting on the right holding a cricket bat over the ground, while on the UK CD edition, the cricket bat touches the ground and the image is mirrored so that their positions on the trunk are reversed. The UK vinyl album cover is the same as the US CD, but differs in that the color hues are much darker. The Record Store Day 2013 vinyl and August 2013 180-gram black vinyl reissues have Meg wearing a black dress instead of the usual white dress; the only other release with Meg wearing the black dress was on the V2 advanced copy back in 2003. The advanced copy was on red and white vinyl, while the RSD copy has red, black and white colored vinyl in 2013. A 20th anniversary limited edition has Jack wearing all white similar to the limited 2003 Australian pressing.

The cover of &quot;Elephant&quot; has become iconic, and appeared on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 Best Album Covers of All Time&quot;.

== Release ==
&quot;Elephant&quot; was released on April 1, 2003, through V2, XL, and Third Man records; it was their second album to be released by V2 records. In 2013, Third Man Records released a limited edition vinyl reissue of &quot;Elephant&quot;, in celebration of the album&#x27;s 10-year anniversary, which were pressed at United Record Pressing in Nashville, TN. In January 2023, a mono remix of the album, titled &quot;Elephant XX&quot;, was announced and later released exclusively through Third Man Records. In March of that same year, an &quot;Elephant&quot; deluxe edition was released, which includes live recordings from a performance in Chicago&#x27;s Aragon Ballroom.

==Reception and legacy==

=== Reviews ===
Upon its release, &quot;Elephant&quot; received widespread acclaim from music critics. Review aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalized score of 92 out of 100 based on 28 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. As of 2023, &quot;Elephant&quot; is the White Stripes&#x27; highest-rated album on the site. It was nominated for Best Album at the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2003, and won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 2004. &quot;Elephant&quot; has been hailed by critics as one of the defining events of the 2000s garage rock revival. Many reviewers believed that it outdid the energy of their earlier albums, and considered it equal to or better than &quot;White Blood Cells&quot;. 

&quot;AllMusic&quot; critic Heather Phares said the album &quot;overflows with quality&quot;. Alexis Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the album their &quot;apotheosis&quot; and wrote that &quot;the White Stripes&#x27; music seems almost elemental, their power undeniable: it is clear why they are the only band to have transcended the indie ghetto.&quot; Lorraine Ali of &quot;Newsweek&quot; criticized the &quot;gimmicks&quot; that surrounded the White Stripes&#x27; music, but concluded that &quot;&quot;Elephant&quot; still sounds great.&quot; John Mulvey of &quot;NME&quot; stated that &quot;The eloquence, barbarism, tenderness and sweat-drenched vitality of &quot;Elephant&quot; make it the most realised White Stripes album yet.&quot; Tim Alves of &quot;PopMatters&quot; said the album cemented &quot;their evolution from Blind Willie McTell cover band with a pop sensibility to full-fledged, honest-to-goodness rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll gods.&quot; David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called &quot;Elephant&quot; &quot;a work of pulverizing perfection,&quot; and believed it exceeded &quot;the plantation holler of 2000&#x27;s &quot;De Stijl&quot; and 2001&#x27;s &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; with blues that both pop and bleed&quot;. &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine remarked that &quot;&quot;Elephant&quot; is where the tabloid phenomenon of summer 2001 prove they are no flash in the pan by making a truly phenomenal record.&quot; Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the continuation of their &quot;Back to Basics&quot; style, but felt that &quot;the quest—for something that might as well be called heart—is still ahead of them.&quot; 

&quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; was the standout song of the album, acclaimed for its &quot;ubiquitous&quot; riff and drumbeat and becoming a stadium chant. &quot;The Hardest Button to Button&quot; earned praise from publications such as &quot;Far Out&quot; and &quot;Rough Trade&quot;, and spawned an acclaimed music video directed by Michel Gondry. &quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot; was described by Kitty Empire of &quot;The Observer&quot; as &quot;astonishing&quot; and David Malitz of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it their &quot;definitive statement&quot;; it was voted the best Jack White song by readers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; &quot;by a landslide&quot; even though it was never released as a single. The tracks &quot;Black Math&quot; and &quot;Girl, You Have No Faith in Medicine&quot; were called &quot;sonic ferocities&quot; by Ron Hart of &quot;Spin&quot;. Meg&#x27;s vocals on &quot;In the Cold, Cold Night&quot; were deemed &quot;sweet and tender&quot; and &quot;magnetic&quot; by Hart and Tom Breihan of &quot;Stereogum&quot;, respectively.

In March 2003, a month before its release, &quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;Elephant&quot; at 74 on their list of the &quot;100 Best Albums of All Time&quot;, and in 2013, the same publication ranked it at 116 on their list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in 2013. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it one of the best albums of the decade, and placed it at 390 on their 2012 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time and at 449 in the 2020 edition. It was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="294880" wikidata="Q1155719" url="?curid=294880" title="De Stijl (album)">
<text>De Stijl () is the second studio album by the American rock duo the White Stripes. The album was released on June 20, 2000, by the Sympathy for the Record Industry. Produced by the band&#x27;s guitarist and lead vocalist Jack White, the album was recorded on an 8-track analog tape in his living room following the covert divorce of members Jack and Meg White, who nevertheless continued working together. The album takes its name from the art movement of the same name, and features their early blues-inspired sound. 

&quot;De Stijl&quot; received positive reviews from critics, and earned a gold certification from the British Phonographic Industry. The album became a cult classic after appearing on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Independent Albums chart in 2002, and was later included on &quot;NME&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in 2013.

== Background and recording ==
The White Stripes band members Jack and Meg White divorced in 2000, however, Meg insisted that they continue working together. &quot;De Stijl&quot; was recorded by the duo in Jack&#x27;s living room, exclusively using an 8-track analog tape. Its cover art sets Jack and Meg against an abstract background of rectangles and lines in red, black and white, and utilizes common elements from the aesthetics of its namesake.

&quot;De Stijl&quot; takes its name from the De Stijl (&quot;the style&quot; in English) art movement, which included the painter Mondrian. Jack had been an admirer of the style for some time, especially of furniture designer Gerrit Rietveld, who designed the Rietveld Schröder House which the band had visited. &quot;De Stijl&quot; was dedicated to both Rietveld and Blind Willie McTell.

On February 5, 2008, Canadian media reported that former Radio-Canada host Dominique Payette filed a lawsuit against the White Stripes for using a nine-second clip of her interview with a little girl at the beginning of &quot;Jumble, Jumble&quot;. She demanded $70,000 in damages and the removal of the album from store shelves. The dispute was settled out of court.

== Music and lyrics ==

&quot;De Stijl&quot; features the band&#x27;s early blues-inspired sound, which was prominent on their self-titled debut album. Tom Breihan of &quot;Stereogum&quot; said the album showcased delta blues, hard and psychedelic rock influences, and Lizzy Goodman of &quot;NPR&quot; similarly noted its &quot;camp&quot; blues sound.

== Release ==
&quot;De Stijl&quot; was released on June 20, 2000, through the Sympathy for the Record Industry label. A re-issued vinyl LP version of the record was pressed at United Record Pressing in Nashville, Tennessee and mastered all-analog from the original master tapes. The album was re-issued again for its 20th anniversary.

== Reception ==

&quot;De Stijl&quot; earned positive reviews from critics, who noted its simplicity, and fusion of blues and &quot;scuzzy garage rock&quot;. It was a sleeper hit, earning a following after the White Stripes began to grow popular outside of Detroit. &quot;NME&quot; included it on their &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list in 2013. 

Heather Phares of AllMusic said that &quot;As distinctive as it is diverse, &quot;De Stijl&quot; blends the Stripes&#x27; arty leanings with enough rock muscle to back up the band&#x27;s ambitions.&quot; William Bowers of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that the album &quot;contained thunderous, honky-soulful, lacerating pop at various stages of evolution&quot;. Jenny Eliscu of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;feisty and clever&quot; and praised the drumming, guitar and vocal performances, stating that &quot;like everything about the White Stripes, it [&quot;De Stijl&quot;] proves that you don&#x27;t need bombast to make a blues explosion.&quot; Ann Powers of the &quot;New York Times&quot; described the album as &quot;what many hip rock fans consider real music.&quot; 

&quot;De Stijl&quot; later appeared at number 38 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Independent Albums chart in 2002, and is now considered a cult classic. The song &quot;Why Can&#x27;t You Be Nicer to Me?&quot; appeared on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in 2010, used in the episode &quot;Judge Me Tender&quot; from its twenty-first season. The song &quot;Apple Blossom&quot; was featured in the 2015 Quentin Tarantino film &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot;.

<text>The White Stripes is the debut studio album by American rock duo the White Stripes, released on June 15, 1999. The album was produced by Jim Diamond and vocalist/guitarist Jack White, recorded in January 1999 at Ghetto Recorders and Third Man Studios in Detroit. White dedicated the album to deceased blues musician Son House.

==Recording and production==
The album was recorded in a week at Ghetto Recorders with &quot;Screwdriver&quot;, &quot;Sugar Never Tasted So Good&quot;, &quot;St. James Infirmary&quot;, and &quot;Astro&quot; recorded at Jack White&#x27;s home. Johnny Walker of the Soledad Brothers played slide guitar on two songs: &quot;Suzy Lee&quot; and &quot;I Fought Piranhas&quot;. Walker is credited with having taught Jack White how to play slide, a technique featured heavily on the White Stripes&#x27; first two albums. Walker explains, &quot;[Jack] had a four track in his living room and invited me to come by and do some recording. In return, I showed him how to play slide.&quot;

The duo covered &quot;St. James Infirmary Blues&quot; after being introduced to the song from a &quot;Betty Boop&quot; cartoon.

==Critical reception==

The album received mostly positive reviews. Norene Cashen of &quot;The Metro Times&quot; said the LP &quot;serves better to remind us that [Detroit&#x27;s] local identity has more options than a membership card to the latest cliché...or a one-way ticket to the coast.&quot;

Much of the media feedback came two or three years after its initial release, following the duo&#x27;s fame spreading beyond Detroit. AllMusic said of the album, &quot;Jack White&#x27;s voice is a singular, evocative combination of punk, metal, blues, and backwoods while his guitar work is grand and banging with just enough lyrical touches of slide and subtle solo work... Meg White balances out the fretwork and the fretting with methodical, spare, and booming cymbal, bass drum, and snare... All D.I.Y. punk-country-blues-metal singer-songwriting duos should sound this good.&quot;

BBC DJ John Peel first spotted the album in a record shop and said, &quot;I just liked the look of it and I looked at the titles – you develop an instinct, d&#x27;you know what I mean? And it looked like the sort of record I would like, so I took it out and I did like it, and started playing it.&quot; His endorsement was key in heightening their popularity in the UK.

<text>CBGB was a New York City music club opened in 1973 by Hilly Kristal in the East Village in Manhattan, New York City. The club was previously a biker bar and before that was a dive bar. The letters &quot;CBGB&quot; were for &quot;Country, Bluegrass, Blues&quot;, Kristal&#x27;s original vision for the club. But CBGB soon emerged as a famed and iconic venue for punk rock and new wave bands, including Ramones, Dead Boys, Television, Patti Smith Group, Blondie, Madonna and Talking Heads. 

Other bands affiliated with CBGB included Agnostic Front, Murphy&#x27;s Law, U.S. Chaos, Cro-Mags, Warzone, Gorilla Biscuits, Sick of It All, and Youth of Today.

One storefront beside CBGB became the &quot;CBGB Record Canteen&quot;, a record shop and café. In the late 1980s, &quot;CBGB Record Canteen&quot; was converted into an art gallery and second performance space, &quot;CB&#x27;s 313 Gallery&quot;. CB&#x27;s Gallery was played by music artists of milder sounds, such as acoustic rock, folk, jazz, or experimental music, such as Dadadah, Kristeen Young, Medeski Martin &amp; Wood and Toshi Reagon, while CBGB continued to showcase mainly hardcore punk, post punk, metal, and alternative rock. 

313 Gallery was also the host location for Alchemy, a weekly Goth night showcasing goth, industrial, dark rock, and darkwave bands. On the other side, CBGB was operating a small cafe and bar in the mid-1990s, which served classic New York pizza, among other items.

Around 2000, CBGB entered a protracted dispute over allegedly unpaid rent amounts until the landlord, Bowery Residents&#x27; Committee, sued in 2005 and lost the case. Kristal and the BRC reached an agreement whereby CBGB would leave by October 31, 2006.

On October 15, 2006, the club closed with a performance by Patti Smith, who took the stage at 9:30 p.m. and played for 3 1/2 hours until slightly after 1 a.m. on October 16, 2006, closing with her song &quot;Elegie&quot; followed by reading a list of punk rock musicians and advocates who had died in recent years. 

CBGB Radio launched on the iHeartRadio platform in 2010, and CBGB music festivals began in 2012. In 2013, CBGB&#x27;s onetime building, 315 Bowery, was added to the National Register of Historic Places as part of The Bowery Historic District (not a New York City Historic District).

CBGB was founded on December 10, 1973, on the site of Kristal&#x27;s earlier bar, Hilly&#x27;s on the Bowery, which he ran from 1969 to 1972. Initially, Kristal focused on his more profitable East Village nightspot, Hilly&#x27;s, which Kristal closed amid complaints from the bar&#x27;s neighbors. After Hilly&#x27;s closure, Kristal focused on the Bowery club. Its full name of CBGB &amp; OMFUG stands for &quot;Country, Bluegrass, Blues, and Other Music For Uplifting Gourmandizers&quot;. Although a gourmandizer is usually a ravenous eater of food, what Kristal meant was &quot;a voracious eater of (…) music&quot;. Kristal&#x27;s intended theme of country, bluegrass, and blues music along with poetry readings yielded to the American movement in punk rock. A pioneer in the genre, Ramones played their first shows at CBGB.

In 1973, while the future &quot;CBGB&quot; was still Hilly&#x27;s, two locals, Bill Page and Rusty McKenna, convinced Kristal to let them book concerts. In February 1974, Hilly booked local band Squeeze to a residency, playing Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the club&#x27;s change from country and bluegrass to original rock bands. Squeeze was led by guitarist Mark Suall, later with CBGB&#x27;s quasi house band the Revelons, which included Fred Smith of Television and JD Daugherty of the Patti Smith Group. Although these bands did not play punk rock, they helped lay its foundation. The August 1973 collapse of the Mercer Arts Center left unsigned bands little option in New York City to play original music. Mercer refugees—including Suicide, The Fast, Ruby and the Rednecks, Jayne County, and the Magic Tramps—soon played at CBGB.

On April 14, 1974, in the audience of Television&#x27;s third gig were Patti Smith and Lenny Kaye, whose Patti Smith Group debuted at CBGB on February 14, 1975. Other early performers included the Dina Regine Band. Dennis Lepri was lead guitarist as well as the Stillettoes which included Deborah Harry on vocals. The newly formed band Angel and the Snake, later renamed Blondie, as well as Ramones arrived in August 1974. Mink DeVille, Talking Heads, The Shirts, The Heartbreakers, The Fleshtones, and other bands soon followed. 

In April 1977, The Damned played the club, marking the first time a British punk band had ever played in America.

During 1975 and 1976, Metropolis Video recorded some shows on film. Beginning in 1977, Metropolis Video filmmaker Pat Ivers and partner Emily Armstrong continued to record shows in a project called Advanced TV, later renamed GoNightclubbing. Ivers&#x27; and Armstrong&#x27;s films are available at the New York University Fales Library.

CBGB&#x27;s two rules were that a band must move its own equipment and play mostly original songs, although regular bands often played one or two covers in set. CBGB&#x27;s growing reputation drew more and more acts from outside New York City. 

In 1978, new wave songwriter Elvis Costello would open shows for The Voidoids, while The Police played at CBGB for their first American gigs. Meanwhile, CBGB became famed for Misfits, Television, Patti Smith Group, Mink DeVille, Dead Boys, the Dictators, the Fleshtones, the Voidoids, the Cramps, the B-52&#x27;s, Blondie, Joan Jett &amp; the Blackhearts, the Shirts, and Talking Heads. Yet in the 1980s, hardcore punk&#x27;s New York underground was CBGB&#x27;s mainstay. Named &quot;thrash day&quot; in a documentary on hardcore, Sunday at CBGB was day, which became an institution, played from afternoon until evening by hardcore bands such as Reagan Youth, Bad Brains, Beastie Boys, Agnostic Front, Murphy&#x27;s Law, Cro-Mags, Leeway, Warzone, Gorilla Biscuits, Sick of It All, Misfits, Sheer Terror, Stillborn and Youth of Today. 

In 1990, violence inside and outside of the venue prompted Kristal to suspend hardcore bookings, although CBGB brought hardcore back at times. CBGB&#x27;s last several years had no formal bans by genre.

===21st century===
In 2005, atop its normally-paid monthly rent of $19,000, CBGB was sued for some $90,000 in rent allegedly owed to its landlord, Bowery Residents&#x27; Committee (BRC). Refusing to pay until a judge ruled the debt legitimate, Kristal claimed that he had never been notified of scaled rent increases, accruing over a number of years, asserted by BRC&#x27;s executive director Muzzy Rosenblatt. Ruling the debt false and that BRC had never properly billed the rent increases,the judge indicated that CBGB ought to be declared a landmark, but noted that Rosenblatt did not need to renew the lease, soon expiring. Rosenblatt vowed to appeal.

Expecting Rosenblatt&#x27;s resistance to lease negotiation, Kristal agreed that the rent ought to rise, but not to the $55,000 monthly that Kristal believed the BRC to want. 

A nonprofit corporation housing homeless above CBGB mostly through donations and government funding, the BRC had only one commercial tenant and raised its monthly rent to $35,000. Kristal and the BRC reached an agreement whereby CBGB would leave by September 30, 2006. Planning to move CBGB to Las Vegas, Kristal explained, &quot;We&#x27;re going to take the urinals. I&#x27;ll take whatever I can. The movers said, &#x27;You ought to take everything, and auction off what you don&#x27;t want on eBay.&#x27; Why not? Somebody will&quot;.

====Closure====

Many punk rock bands played at CBGB when they found it was going to close in hopes that their support could keep it from closing. Rocks off, a promoter in New York, organized CBGB&#x27;s final weeks of shows to book &quot;many of the artists who made CB&#x27;s famous&quot;. Avail, the Bouncing Souls, and such newer acts opened during the last week, which included multi-night stands by Bad Brains and the Dictators and an acoustic set by Blondie. The final show, broadcast live on Sirius Satellite Radio on October 15, was played by Patti Smith, helped on some songs by Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Television&#x27;s Richard Lloyd, too, played in a few, including &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;. Nearly-finished, Smith and band playing &quot;Gloria&quot; alternated the chorus with echoes of &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot; by the Ramones—&quot;Hey! Ho! Let&#x27;s go!&quot;. During &quot;Elegie&quot;, her final encore, Smith named musicians and other music figures who had died since playing at CBGB. On October 15, 2006, upon Patti Smith&#x27;s last show at CBGB, the storied bar and club closed.

====Aftermath====
After closing, the old CBGB venue remained open as CBGB Fashions—retail store, wholesale department, and an online store—until October 31, 2006. CBGB Fashions moved to 19–23 St. Mark&#x27;s Place on November 1, and closed nearly two years later in summer 2008.

Hilly Kristal died from complications of lung cancer on August 28, 2007. In early October, Kristal&#x27;s family and friends hosted a private memorial service in the nearby YMCA. Soon, there was a public memorial, contributed to by CBGB onetime staff and by others.

Kristal&#x27;s ex-wife Karen Kristal and his daughter, Lisa Kristal Burgman, battled legally over the purported $3 million CBGB estate, and settled in June 2009 with Burgman receiving most of the money left after payment of creditors and estate taxes. In 2011, a group of unknown investors bought the remaining CBGB assets, including the associated intellectual property and original interior. The location is now occupied by John Varvatos fashions.

In December 2015, various news outlets reported on a rebranded CBGB &quot;reopening&quot; at Newark International Airport as CBGB L.A.B. (Lounge and Bar) by New York chef Harold Moore, which had opened as of the end of December 2015.

==Venue==

By late 2007, fashion designer John Varvatos planned to open a store in CBGB&#x27;s former space, 315 Bowery, but to tastefully trail CBGB&#x27;s legacy rock and roll stickers on the walls, and much of the graffiti at the toilets was preserved, as were some playbills, found behind a wall, from shows at the club&#x27;s 10th anniversary in 1983. The store opened in April 2008.

In 2008, a SoHo art gallery dedicated to music photography, the Morrison Hotel, opened a second location in the onetime CBGB Gallery at 313 Bowery, but the Morrison Hotel gallery closed in 2011. The space was then occupied by a surf-oriented Patagonia store until late 2021.

Called the &quot;Extra Place&quot;, the alley behind the building became a pedestrian mall. Dead Boys&#x27; Cheetah Chrome rued, &quot;All of Manhattan has lost its soul to money lords&quot;, yet reflected, &quot;If that alley could talk, it&#x27;s seen it all&quot;. CBGB&#x27;s nomination as a landmark drew an explanation:
==Legacy==
CBGB&#x27;s second awning, the one in place when the club closed in 2006, was moved into the lobby of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.

The CBGB Festival produced large free concerts in Times Square and Central Park on July 7, 2012. They also showcased hundreds of bands in venues across the city. The festival premiered dozens of rock-n-roll movies in theaters around Manhattan.

Directed by Randall Miller and starring Alan Rickman as Hilly Kristal, the film &quot;CBGB&quot;, about Kristal and the origins of the club, was released in October 2013 to harsh reviews. Iconic in American popular culture, CBGB&#x27;s image remained storied:
* CBGB was in a promotional ad aired during New York City&#x27;s bid to host the 2012 Olympic Games.
* CBGB appears in the 2010 rhythm game &quot;Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock&quot;.
* In The Shapers&#x27; song &quot;Old School Punk Star&quot;, the venue is referenced in the bridge: &quot;...and to rock on at the CBGB ...&quot;
* Rapper Aesop Rock mentions CBGB in his song &quot;Shrunk&quot;, &quot;Telephone uncovered by purveyors of the Ouija/Then checked against the CBGB women&#x27;s room graffiti&quot;
* Talking Heads mention CBGB in the song &quot;Life During Wartime&quot;, &quot;This ain&#x27;t no Mudd Club, or C.B.G.B.&quot; 
* The Heads, a spin-off band of Talking Heads, mentions CBGB in their song &quot;Punk Lolita,&quot; off their album &quot;No Talking, Just Head;&quot; &quot;She was a punk Lolita, C.B.G.B. era.&quot;
* LCD Soundsystem&#x27;s 2002 debut single &quot;Losing My Edge&quot; references CBGB, &quot;I was the first guy playing Daft Punk to the rock kids. I played it at CBGB&#x27;s. Everybody thought I was crazy&quot;.

<text>The Ouachita National Forest is a vast congressionally-designated National Forest that lies in the western portion of Arkansas and portions of extreme-eastern Oklahoma, USA.

==History==
The Ouachita National Forest is the oldest National Forest in the southern United States. The forest encompasses , including most of the scenic Ouachita Mountain Range. Six locations in the forest, comprising , have been congressionally-designated as wilderness areas.

&quot;Ouachita&quot; is the French spelling of the Indian word &quot;Washita&quot;, which means &quot;good hunting grounds&quot;. The forest was known as Arkansas National Forest on its establishment on December 18, 1907; the name was changed to Ouachita National Forest on April 29, 1926.
Rich in history, the rugged and scenic Ouachita Mountains were explored by Europeans in 1541 by Hernando de Soto&#x27;s party of Spaniards. French explorers followed, flavoring the region with names like Fourche La Fave River.

The area including the forest nearly became a national park during the 1920s, but a last-minute pocket veto by President Calvin Coolidge ended the effort. The bill had been pushed by U.S. Senator Joseph T. Robinson and U.S. Representative Otis Wingo, both Democrats, and State Representative Osro Cobb, then the only Republican in the Arkansas legislature. Cobb had been invited to meet with Coolidge before the proposal was killed because of opposition from the National Park Service and the United States Department of Agriculture, presumably because of the nearby location of Hot Springs National Park. Coolidge proposed expanding the forest into Oklahoma which would be realized in 1930 when the forest was extended into Le Flore County, Oklahoma.

In a magazine article, Cobb described the area that he had sought to protect for future generations, located approximately midway between Little Rock and Shreveport, Louisiana, as within relatively easy driving distance of 45 million Americans, many of whom could not afford long trips to the national parks in the western states. He compared flora and fauna in the Ouachita forest to those of the southern Alleghenies, a division of the Appalachian Mountains. Cobb continued:

A visitor standing upon one of the many majestic peaks in the area of the proposed park is thrilled by a panoramic view that cannot be had elsewhere in the South Central States. With cheeks flushed by the invigorating mountain breezes, the mountain climber is rewarded by an inspiring view of countless and nameless peaks, mountain groups, dense forests, and inviting valleys, all merging into the distant horizon. ... there are many mountain streams, now moving slowly in narrow but deep pools, then churning with savage ferocity down some water-worn precipice, leaving in its wake snow-white sprays ... Fed by crystal springs and like so much molten silver these streams flow their turbulent courses unappreciated and rarely visited. ...

==Features==
The endangered and rare maple-leaf oak occurs in the forest, which also contains extensive woodlands of stunted Northern Red Oak, White Oak, post oak, and Blackjack Oak at elevations over and on steep, dry slopes. Much of these woodlands, being of little commercial value, were never logged and the extent of old growth forest within them may total nearly . There are also old-growth woodlands of Eastern Redcedar, Gum Bumelia, Winged Elm, and Yaupon along some streams. These vast unbroken reserves of old-growth forest make up the largest virgin forest in the United States, barring only the vast timber reserves in Alaska&#x27;s Tongass Forest.

The Talimena Scenic Drive, which is Highway 1 in Oklahoma and Highway 88 in Arkansas, is a National Scenic Byway which meanders through the forest. The Scenic Drive passes through old-growth oak woodlands on Winding Stair and Rich Mountains.

Forest headquarters are located in Hot Springs, Arkansas.
===Recreation===
The forest contains a number of hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding trails. The most extensive hiking trail is the Ouachita National Recreation Trail, which traverses across the region. This is a well-maintained backpacking, hiking trail with overnight shelters in several portions of the trail. Mountain biking is also allowed for some sections of the trail.

Camp Clearfork was originally constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). Managed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), it is on Clearfork Lake, about west of Hot Springs on U.S. 270. Reservations are required for camping and may be made through the Womble USDA Office. The campground has six dorm/cabins which can hold up to 10 people each, three staff cabins that hold five to six people each, a dining hall, a recreation hall and accessible flush toilets and showers.

In the Oklahoma section of the forest, the Winding Stair Mountain National Recreation Area and six other designated areas offer visitors a full range of activities with more than 150 campsites, a lake and an equestrian camp.

Southeast of Idabel, the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation manages the Red Slough Wildlife Management Area, a wetland area donated to the USFS by The Conservation Fund in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Hunting (no lead shot) and fishing are allowed there. The area is also a destination for birdwatchers.

Canoeing and fishing are popular activities on the Mountain Fork River, Caddo River, Little Missouri River and Ouachita River within the bounds of the forest. The Cossatot River, said to be the most difficult whitewater river between the Smoky and Rocky Mountains, also passes through the forest.

Rockhounds frequent a geologic belt several miles wide containing high concentrations of very pure quartz crystals. Visitors and rock collectors are free to pick up loose crystals within the belt for personal use and may dig for quartz with the permission of the district ranger.

== Wilderness areas ==
A network of wilderness areas are found in the national forest, protecting the sections of the forest that have had the least amount of human intervention. These areas harbor some of the most rugged, scenic and secluded places in all of Arkansas and the South.

The Black Fork Mountain Wilderness is located in both Arkansas and Oklahoma and contains significant old-growth forests. It protects beautiful, rugged vistas and clear mountain springs.

The Upper Kiamichi River Wilderness is located solely in Oklahoma.

The 14,290-acre (57.8 km2) Caney Creek Wilderness is located in the southwestern part of the forest in Arkansas. It is known for its rare Appalachian mixed mesophytic forest biome and high levels of biodiversity, as well as rare reserves of moist-hardwood old growth forest.

The 11,141-acre (45.1 km2) Poteau Mountain Wilderness is located in the north-central range of the Ouachita mountains in Arkansas.

The 6,301-acre (25.5 km2) Dry Creek Wilderness is located in the north-central ranges of the Ouachita Mountains near Magazine Mountain. It is the state&#x27;s second-smallest wilderness is known for scenic overlooks and high, secluded sandstone bluffs.

The 10,181-acre (41.2 km2) Flatside Wilderness is located in the extreme-eastern segment of the Ouachita National Forest, near Lake Maumelle and Little Rock. This rarely-visited wilderness has some of the highest and most panoramic views in Arkansas and winding, tumbling clear mountain streams and waterfalls.

==Counties==
Ouachita National Forest is located in 13 counties in western and central Arkansas and two counties in southeastern Oklahoma. They are listed here in descending order of forestland within the county. Also given is their area as of 30 September 2007. Roughly 80% of the forest&#x27;s area is in Arkansas, with the remaining 20% in Oklahoma. In Arkansas, there are local ranger district offices located in Booneville, Danville, Glenwood, Jessieville, Mena, Mount Ida, Oden, Perryville and Waldron. In Oklahoma, they are located in Hodgen, Talihina and north of Broken Bow. Even though the Ouachita National Forest is far from being the largest, its twelve ranger districts are the most of any in the National Forest system. The giant Tongass National Forest in Alaska is second with nine ranger district divisions.

<text>End of the Century is the fifth studio album by the American punk rock band Ramones, released on February 4, 1980, through Sire Records. The album was the band&#x27;s first to be produced by Phil Spector, though he had offered the band his assistance earlier in their career. With Spector fully producing the album, it was the first release that excluded original member Tommy Ramone, who had left the band in 1978 but had produced their previous album &quot;Road to Ruin&quot;. Spector used more advanced standards of engineering, such as high-quality overdubbing and echo chambers. These painstaking methods caused conflict between the band and Spector since the Ramones were accustomed to a quicker recording process. Spector emphasized the production value as well, working with a budget of around $200,000, far exceeding their earlier album sessions.

The songs on &quot;End of the Century&quot; were written primarily to expand the band&#x27;s fan base, straying from the band&#x27;s original punk genre and steering toward a more pop oriented sound. The lyrics on the album deal with various topics, ranging from drug addictions to the band&#x27;s lifestyle while touring. The album also features a cover of the Ronettes&#x27; song &quot;Baby, I Love You&quot;, as well as successors to the previous Ramones songs &quot;Judy Is a Punk&quot; and &quot;Havana Affair&quot;.

It received generally positive reviews from critics, though many reviewers were less favorable than they had been to the band&#x27;s previous releases, due to Spector&#x27;s production quality and the band&#x27;s desire for mainstream success starting to show in their music. Despite this, the album is the highest-charting Ramones album of all time, reaching number 44 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and number 14 on the UK Albums Chart. &quot;End of the Century&quot; spawned the singles &quot;Baby, I Love You&quot; and &quot;Do You Remember Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Radio?&quot;, both of which charted in Europe.

== Recording and production ==
In February 1977 after attending a Ramones concert in Los Angeles, music producer Phil Spector offered to assist in making &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot;. The band declined his offer, feeling as though the album would not be the same without Tommy Ramone and Tony Bongiovi producing the album. While the band refused his initial offer, their management later asked Spector to help with the album because of their lack of popularity and sales. &quot;End of the Century&quot; would be the first album released without former drummer and producer Tommy. Spector had become famous through his work with the Ronettes, the Righteous Brothers, Ike and Tina Turner, the Beatles and John Lennon, among others. With these releases, Spector defined what would become known as the &quot;Wall of Sound&quot;, which is a dense, layered, and reverberant sound that came across well on AM radio and jukeboxes. These standards are created through instruments performing identical parts in unison, using high-quality overdubbing and echo chambers to aid in the production value. The producer was convinced that the Ramones had talent with lyrics and musical structure, so he intended to promote the band through more advanced methods of sound output.

Recording sessions for the album began on May 1, 1979 at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles. Gold Star Studios had become famous through its history with artists like Eddie Cochran and the Beach Boys. At the Ramones&#x27; request, Ed Stasium joined the band in Los Angeles, serving as &#x27;musical director&#x27;, playing additional guitar parts and singing backing vocals, but not engineering. During the studio work, Spector&#x27;s recording methods were different from those the Ramones were accustomed to from their four previous studio albums. The band recorded their earlier compositions in the shortest time possible for the lowest feasible budget, with a relatively low production value. With &quot;End of the Century&quot;, which took nearly six months to mix, the band experienced Spector&#x27;s infamous perfectionism, and a budget of $200,000 ($869,000 in 2024) to fully record and produce the album. This is significant because the band&#x27;s debut album cost $6,400 ($35,486 in 2024) total, and their second album cost $10,000 ($55,447 in 2024). &quot;End of the Century&quot; is the most expensive album in the Ramones&#x27; career.

=== Conflict ===
This method of recording caused conflicts to arise. Bassist Dee Dee Ramone wrote of Spector&#x27;s obsessive techniques: &quot;Phil would sit in the control room and would listen through the headphones to Marky hit one note on the drum, hour after hour, after hour, after hour.&quot; During the recording of &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot;, Johnny was forced by Spector to repeat his part hundreds of times for several hours. Sire Records owner Seymour Stein relates: &quot;To Johnny, this must have been like the Chinese water torture.&quot; &quot;I understood [Spector&#x27;s] attitude,&quot; said Marky. &quot;He was from The Bronx, I was from Brooklyn. We got along very well and had a nice rapport... But he had his way of working that was very slow, and the Ramones had their way of working which was very fast. So that would sometimes irk everybody, and led to animosity with Johnny and Dee Dee.&quot;

Early in the sessions, Spector reportedly held the Ramones hostage at gunpoint. According to Dee Dee, when Spector took Joey away for a three-hour private meeting in his mansion where the album was to be recorded, Dee Dee went looking for them. &quot;The next thing I knew Phil appeared at the top of the staircase, shouting and waving a pistol.&quot;
Johnny gave a similar account in a 1986 interview:
However, in 2008, Marky Ramone gave a different account of the story:

Dee Dee claimed to have left the sessions without recording anything. &quot;We had been working for at least fourteen or fifteen hours a day for thirteen days straight and we still hadn&#x27;t recorded one note of music,&quot; he wrote in his autobiography. After supposedly hearing that Johnny had returned to New York, Dee Dee wrote that he and Marky Ramone booked a flight and returned home as well. &quot;To this day, I still have no idea how they made the album &quot;End of the Century&quot;, or who actually played bass on it.&quot; Dee Dee&#x27;s account contradicts much of the band&#x27;s collective account from the 1982 &quot;Trouser Press&quot; interview, where the band stated that the only track that Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky did not play on was the cover of &quot;Baby, I Love You&quot;; as the band, save for Joey, had gone home after cutting basic tracks for the rest of the album. Ed Stasium, who was present the entire time except for the mixing, confirmed this in 2014, saying, &quot;it&#x27;s untrue that Dee Dee didn&#x27;t play on the album. There&#x27;s one song that the Ramones did not appear on ... It&#x27;s no secret—Dee Dee had substance abuse problems. He may have forgotten, but Dee Dee played bass on the record.&quot;

== Compositions ==
&quot;End of the Century&quot; was described by the band as an album written solely to gain popularity, resulting in more of a punk rock with pop sensibilities. Joey failed to contribute to the best of his abilities on the album and recalled: &quot;I think that some of the worst crap I ever wrote went on the album. That was me at my worst.&quot; Johnny also felt that the album was far from the band&#x27;s prime:

The album opens with &quot;Do You Remember Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Radio?&quot;, a throwback to the rock music of the 1950s and 1960s. The lyrics name several famous musicians of this era, including Jerry Lee Lewis, John Lennon, and T. Rex, and also cite &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Many instruments that were previously rarely—if ever—used in punk rock were featured in the song&#x27;s score, including the saxophone and electronic organ. The lyrics, written by Joey, applied to all the band, Dee Dee explained. They depict his childhood in Germany where he would secretly listen to rock radio stations at night.

Johnny&#x27;s part is not heard on the next track, &quot;I&#x27;m Affected&quot;, as reported by Johnny himself. Joey admitted that he did not favor the song, recalling: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t believe how awful it sounded. It was horrible.&quot; &quot;Danny Says&quot;, the third track, was a lyrical depiction of what the band constantly went through while touring—soundchecks, autograph sessions, interviews, etc. The title &quot;Danny Says&quot; refers to the band&#x27;s tour manager Danny Fields giving the members instructions, schedules, and demands. According to Joey, the ballad was inspired by Lou Reed, who had released the songs &quot;Candy Says&quot; and &quot;Caroline Says&quot;. Joey&#x27;s brother Mickey Leigh called the song a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and said it &quot;remains one of the most captivatingly beautiful songs I&#x27;ve ever heard.&quot;

Dee Dee wrote the next song, &quot;Chinese Rock&quot;, in 1975 (with lyrical help from Richard Hell), and Johnny Thunders later revised it. Dee Dee wrote the piece in response to Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Heroin&quot;, and attempted to concoct better lyrics on the same subject of drug use and heroin addiction. After Johnny vetoed the song, it was recorded by Thunders&#x27;s band the Heartbreakers before the Ramones, though the bands use slightly different words. The lyrics deal with the daily life of a heroin addict, and the term &quot;Chinese Rock&quot; is a euphemism for the drug. &quot;The Return of Jackie and Judy&quot; is a continuation to one of the band&#x27;s earlier songs, &quot;Judy is a Punk&quot;, which was released on their debut album &quot;Ramones&quot;. There were numerous studio guests involved in the album&#x27;s recording, including producer/musicians, Dan Kessel and David Kessel, and California disc jockey Rodney Bingenheimer.

Side B begins with &quot;Baby, I Love You&quot;. Johnny constantly claims in his book &quot;Commando&quot; that he hated the song and the band didn&#x27;t even play on it, only Joey and some studio musicians. Joey exclaimed that he &quot;hated&quot; the song, despite it obtaining a level of popularity in Europe. The song is a cover version of the original by the Ronettes, and contained a string section arrangement that Leigh deemed &quot;gooey&quot; and that it &quot;sounded right out of Redbone&#x27;s &#x27;Come and Get Your Love.&#x27;&quot; He also confessed that the song &quot;almost made [him] embarrassed.&quot; &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot; originally appeared on the soundtrack to &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot;, a film directed by Allan Arkush. The movie depicts a storyline in which the Ramones are obsessed over by female high school student Riff Randell along with other pupils attending the school. The album concludes with &quot;High Risk Insurance&quot;, which is a reaction to politics of that era.

&quot;End of the Century&quot; marks the final Ramones album to feature songs officially credited to Joey, Johnny and Dee Dee together.

== Critical reception==
The album received generally positive reviews from critics, but not as favorable for many of the band&#x27;s previous records. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, senior editor for AllMusic, noted that the Ramones desired mainstream success much more and were recording music in such a fashion as to expand their fan base. Another AllMusic editor, T. Donald Guarisco, noted that the &quot;entire album is pretty controversial in the world of Ramones fandom&quot;. Although he gave the album a &quot;B+&quot; rating, music critic Robert Christgau nevertheless called the album &quot;[s]ad&quot;, and described the band as &quot;tired&quot;. He also felt that Spector&#x27;s production failed to make much of a difference in the band&#x27;s overall sound, saying &quot;his guitar overdubs are worse than his orchestrations, and they&#x27;re not uncute.&quot;

Kurt Loder, reviewing the album for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, called it &quot;Phil Spector&#x27;s finest and most mature effort in years&quot;, and said that his production created a setting &quot;rich and vibrant and surging with power&quot;. He noted that the Ramones are still &quot;spotlighted&quot;, rather than their producer. Author Richard Williams exclaimed that to &quot;old fans the Ramones&#x27; version of &#x27;Baby, I Love You&#x27; went too far, desecrating the memory of the original despite Joey&#x27;s evident devotion to the task of emulating Ronnie&#x27;s lead vocal.&quot; Williams also said that &quot;Do You Remember Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Radio&quot; and &quot;Chinese Rock&quot; maintained the principles of the Ramones in their earlier days.

== Commercial performance==
&quot;End of the Century&quot; is the Ramones&#x27; highest-peaking album on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (having reached No. 44 during a fourteen-week chart stay), as well as their most successful on the UK Albums Chart and the Swedish chart Sverigetopplistan. The album became the first—and only—Ramones&#x27; album to chart on Norway&#x27;s VG-lista chart and New Zealand&#x27;s Recorded Music NZ. It was also the band&#x27;s first album to chart on the Netherlands&#x27; MegaCharts, with their 1987 album &quot;Halfway to Sanity&quot; being their only other release to chart there as well.

Two singles were spawned from &quot;End of the Century&quot;: &quot;Baby, I Love You&quot; and &quot;Do You Remember Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Radio?&quot;, released respectively. The first single charted on Belgium&#x27;s Ultratop chart as well as reaching number 8 in the UK. &quot;Do You Remember Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Radio?&quot; also charted in Europe, peaking and debuting at 54 on the UK Singles Chart.

<text>Forbes () is an American business magazine founded by B. C. Forbes in 1917 and owned by Hong Kong–based investment group Integrated Whale Media Investments since 2014. Its chairman and editor-in-chief is Steve Forbes. The company is based in Jersey City, New Jersey. Sherry Phillips was slated to become the new CEO at Forbes on January 1, 2025.

Published eight times per year, &quot;Forbes&quot; features articles on finance, industry, investing, and marketing topics. It also reports on related subjects such as technology, communications, science, politics, and law. It has an international edition in Asia as well as editions produced under license in 27 countries and regions worldwide. The magazine is known for its lists and rankings, including its lists of the richest Americans (the &quot;Forbes&quot; 400), of 30 notable people under the age of 30, of America&#x27;s wealthiest celebrities, of the world&#x27;s top companies (the &quot;Forbes&quot; Global 2000), of the world&#x27;s most powerful people, and of the world&#x27;s billionaires. The motto of &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine is &quot;Change the World&quot;.

==Company history==
B. C. Forbes, a financial columnist for the Hearst papers, and his partner Walter Drey, the general manager of the &quot;Magazine of Wall Street&quot;, founded &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine on September 15, 1917. Forbes provided the money and the name and Drey provided the publishing expertise. The original name of the magazine was &quot;Forbes: Devoted to Doers and Doings&quot;. Drey became vice-president of the B.C. Forbes Publishing Company, while B.C. Forbes became editor-in-chief, a post he held until his death in 1954. B.C. Forbes was assisted in his later years by his two eldest sons, Bruce Charles Forbes (1916–1964) and Malcolm Forbes (1919–1990).

Bruce Forbes took over after his father&#x27;s death, and his strengths lay in streamlining operations and developing marketing. During his tenure, from 1954 to 1964, the magazine&#x27;s circulation nearly doubled.

On Bruce&#x27;s death, his brother Malcolm Forbes became president and chief executive officer of Forbes, and editor-in-chief of &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine. Between 1961 and 1999 the magazine was edited by James Michaels. In 1993, under Michaels, &quot;Forbes&quot; was a finalist for the National Magazine Award. In 2006, an investment group Elevation Partners that includes rock star Bono bought a minority interest in the company with a reorganization, through a new company, Forbes Media LLC, in which Forbes Magazine and Forbes.com, along with other media properties, is now a part. A 2009 &quot;New York Times&quot; report said: &quot;40 percent of the enterprise was sold... for a reported $300 million, setting the value of the enterprise at $750 million.&quot; Three years later, Mark M. Edmiston of AdMedia Partners observed, &quot;It&#x27;s probably not worth half of that now.&quot; It was later revealed that the price had been US$264 million.

In 2021, Forbes Media reported a return to profit, with revenue increasing by 34 percent to $165 million. Much of the revenue growth was attributed to Forbes&#x27; consumer business, which was up 83 percent year-over-year. CEO Mike Federle says that Forbes is built on an audience and business scale with 150 million consumers.

===Sale of headquarters===
In January 2010, &quot;Forbes&quot; reached an agreement to sell its headquarters building on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to New York University; terms of the deal were not publicly reported, but Forbes was to continue to occupy the space under a five-year sale-leaseback arrangement. The company&#x27;s headquarters moved to the Newport section of downtown Jersey City, New Jersey, in 2014.

===Sale to Integrated Whale Media (51% stake)===
In November 2013, Forbes Media, which publishes &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, was put up for sale. This was encouraged by minority shareholders Elevation Partners. Sale documents prepared by Deutsche Bank revealed that the publisher&#x27;s 2012 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization was US$15 million. &quot;Forbes&quot; reportedly sought a price of US$400 million. In July 2014, the Forbes family bought out Elevation and then Hong Kong-based investment group Integrated Whale Media Investments purchased a 51 percent majority of the company.

In 2017, Isaac Stone Fish, a senior fellow of the Asia Society, wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that &quot;Since that purchase, there have been several instances of editorial meddling on stories involving China that raise questions about Forbes magazine&#x27;s commitment to editorial independence.&quot;

===Failed SPAC merger and sale===
On August 26, 2021, Forbes announced plans to go public via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company called Magnum Opus Acquisition, and to trade on the New York Stock Exchange as FRBS. In February 2022, it was announced that Cryptocurrency exchange Binance would acquire a $200 million stake in Forbes as a result of the SPAC flotation. In June 2022, the company terminated its SPAC merger citing unfavorable market conditions.

In August 2022, the company announced that it was exploring a sale of its business. In May 2023, it was announced that billionaire Austin Russell, founder of Luminar Technologies, agreed to acquire an 82percent stake in a deal valuing the company at $800million. His majority ownership was to include the remaining portion of the company owned by the Forbes family which was not previously sold to Integrated Whale Media. The transaction attracted scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Russell denied reports that Russian businessman Magomed Musaev was involved in the transaction. In November 2023, the deal collapsed, as Russell was unable to put together the necessary funds.

Chairman / Editor-in-chief Steve Forbes and his magazine&#x27;s writers offer investment advice on the weekly Fox TV show &quot;Forbes on Fox&quot; and on &quot;Forbes on Radio&quot;. Other company groups include Forbes Conference Group, Forbes Investment Advisory Group and Forbes Custom Media. From the 2009 &quot;Times&quot; report: &quot;Steve Forbes recently returned from opening up a &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine in India, bringing the number of foreign editions to 10.&quot; In addition, that year the company began publishing &quot;ForbesWoman&quot;, a quarterly magazine published by Steve Forbes&#x27;s daughter, Moira Forbes, with a companion Web site.

The company formerly published &quot;American Legacy&quot; magazine as a joint venture, although that magazine separated from Forbes on May 14, 2007.

The company also formerly published &quot;American Heritage&quot; and &quot;Invention &amp; Technology&quot; magazines. After failing to find a buyer, Forbes suspended publication of these two magazines as of May 17, 2007. Both magazines were purchased by the American Heritage Publishing Company and resumed publication as of the spring of 2008. Forbes has published the &quot;Forbes Travel Guide&quot; since 2009.

In 2013, Forbes licensed its brand to Ashford University, and assisted with the launch of the Forbes School of Business &amp; Technology. CEO Mike Federle justified the licensing in 2018, stating that &quot;Our licensing business is almost a pure-profit business, because it&#x27;s an annual annuity.&quot; Forbes would launch limited promotions for the school in limited issues. Forbes has never formally endorsed the school.

On January 6, 2014, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine announced that, in partnership with app creator Maz, it was launching a social networking app called &quot;Stream&quot;. Stream allows Forbes readers to save and share visual content with other readers and discover content from &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine and Forbes.com within the app.

==Forbes.com==
David Churbuck founded &quot;Forbes&quot;″s web site in 1996. The site uncovered Stephen Glass&#x27;s journalistic fraud in &quot;The New Republic&quot; in 1998, an article that drew attention to internet journalism. At the peak of media coverage of alleged Toyota sudden unintended acceleration in 2010, it exposed the California &quot;runaway Prius&quot; as a hoax, as well as running five other articles by Michael Fumento challenging the entire media premise of Toyota&#x27;s cars gone bad. The website (like the magazine) publishes lists focusing on billionaires and their possessions, especially real estate.

Forbes.com is part of Forbes Digital, a division of Forbes Media LLC. Forbes&#x27;s holdings include a portion of RealClearPolitics. Together these sites reach more than 27 million unique visitors each month. Forbes.com employs the slogan &quot;Home Page for the World&#x27;s Business Leaders&quot; and claimed, in 2006, to be the world&#x27;s most widely visited business web site. The 2009 &quot;Times&quot; report said that, while &quot;one of the top five financial sites by traffic [throwing] off an estimated $70 million to $80 million a year in revenue, [it] never yielded the hoped-for public offering&quot;.

Forbes.com uses a contributor network in which a wide network of freelancers (&quot;contributors&quot;) writes and publishes articles directly on the website. Contributors are paid based on traffic to their respective Forbes.com pages; the site has received contributions from over 2,500 individuals, and some contributors have earned over US$100,000, according to the company. The contributor system has been criticized for enabling &quot;pay-to-play journalism&quot; and the repackaging of public relations material as news. &quot;Forbes&quot; currently allows advertisers to publish blog posts on its website alongside regular editorial content through a program called BrandVoice, which accounts for more than 10 percent of its digital revenue. In July 2018 Forbes deleted an article by a contributor who argued that libraries should be closed, and Amazon should open bookstores in their place.

As of 2019 the company published 100 articles each day produced by 3,000 outside contributors who were paid little or nothing. This business model, in place since 2010, &quot;changed their reputation from being a respectable business publication to a content farm&quot;, according to Damon Kiesow, the Knight Chair in digital editing and producing at the University of Missouri School of Journalism. Similarly, Harvard University&#x27;s Nieman Lab deemed Forbes &quot;a platform for scams, grift, and bad journalism&quot; as of 2022.

In 2017 the website blocked internet users using ad blocking software from accessing articles, demanding that the website be put on the ad blocking software&#x27;s whitelist before access was granted. Forbes argued that this is done because customers using ad blocking software do not contribute to the site&#x27;s revenue. Malware attacks have been noted to occur from the Forbes site.

Forbes won the 2020 Webby People&#x27;s Voice Award for Business Blog/Website.

== Forbes8 ==
In November 2019, Forbes launched a streaming platform Forbes8, highlighting notable entrepreneurs and sharing business tips. In 2020, the network announced the release of several documentary series including &quot;Forbes Rap Mentors&quot;, &quot;Driven Against the Odds&quot;, &quot;Indie Nation&quot; and &quot;Titans on the Rocks&quot;.

<text>Your Hit Parade was an American radio and television music program that was broadcast from 1935 to 1953 on radio, and seen from 1950 to 1959 on television. It was sponsored by American Tobacco&#x27;s Lucky Strike cigarettes. During its 24-year run, the show had 19 orchestra leaders and 52 singers or groups. 

When the show debuted, there was no agreement on its title. The press referred to it by several names, with the most common being &quot;Hit Parade&quot;, &quot;The Hit Parade&quot;, &quot;The Lucky Strike Hit Parade&quot;, and &quot;The Lucky Strike Parade&quot;. The program title officially became &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot; on November 9, 1935.

Every Saturday evening, the program offered the most popular and bestselling songs of the week. The earliest format involved a presentation of the top 15 songs. Later, a countdown with fanfares led to the top three finalists, with the number one song for the finale. Occasional performances of standards and other favorite songs from the past were known as &quot;Lucky Strike Extras&quot;.

Listeners were informed that the &quot;&quot;Your Hit Parade&quot; survey checks the best sellers on sheet music and phonograph records, the songs most heard on the air and most played on the automatic coin machines, an accurate, authentic tabulation of America&#x27;s taste in popular music.&quot; However, the exact procedure of this &quot;authentic tabulation&quot; remained a secret. Some believe song choices were often arbitrary due to various performance and production factors. The show&#x27;s ad agencies—initially Lord and Thomas and later Batten, Barton, Durstine &amp; Osborne—never revealed the specific sources or the methods that were used to determine top hits. They made a general statement that it was based mainly on &quot;readings of radio requests, sheet music sales, dance-hall favorites and jukebox tabulations&quot;; &quot;Radio Guide&quot; claimed &quot;an endless popularity poll on a nationwide scale.&quot;

===Lucky Strike&#x27;s first radio endeavors===
The origins of the format can be traced back to the Lucky Strike Saturday Night Dance Party sponsored by Lucky Strike cigarettes. Led by Benjamin A. Rolfe, the show was heard on the NBC Red network Saturdays between 10 and 11 pm beginning in September 1928. The program was devised by American Tobacco&#x27;s George W. Hill, an attempt to popularize the consumption of tobacco products, which were increasingly used by young people and women. For the latter demographic group, the company also launched the slogan &quot;Reach for a Lucky instead of a sweet&quot; at the same time. In a cross-promotion, Rolfe made recordings for Edison Records credited as &quot;B.A. Rolfe and his Lucky Strike Orchestra&quot;.

Beginning in April 1930, the show became known as The Lucky Strike Dance Hour, as a second hour-long show began airing Wednesday nights on the NBC Blue network (9:30 to 10:30 pm). During the fall, the Wednesday show was replaced by Tuesday and Thursday night broadcasts, also on NBC Red.

During its first three years, the show featured Rolfe&#x27;s band playing popular songs and novelty tunes interspersed with plugs for Lucky Strikes by the announcer, whose other role was introducing each number. During the fall of 1931, the program was revamped as The Lucky Strike Magic Carpet Show, a variety show hosted by Walter O&#x27;Keefe featuring the orchestras of Rolfe, Anson Weeks, Jack Denny, George Olsen, Abe Lyman, Phil Harris and others supplied exclusively by Jules Stein&#x27;s Music Corporation of America, and the bands were picked up from diverse points across the US instead of originating entirely from New York, which was a novelty at the time. The &quot;variety&quot; segments included dramatizations of cases from the New York Police Department, society gossip by Walter Winchell (then a gossip columnist for Hearst&#x27;s tabloid &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot;, featuring a style different from the one Winchell is more remembered for), and comedy by Bert Lahr and Jack Pearl. During the spring and summer of 1933, the Tuesday and Thursday broadcasts were phased out and the show reverted to the original Lucky Strike Saturday Night Dance Party format with Rolfe&#x27;s orchestra and the Men About Town trio, running until early 1934.

===Your Hit Parade on radio (1935–1953)===

&quot;Your Hit Parade&quot; began on NBC April 20, 1935, as a 60-minute program with 15 songs played in a random format before presenting the number 1 song. Initially, the songs were more important than the singers, so a stable of vocalists went uncredited and were paid $100 per episode, equal to $ in . In 1936–37, it was carried on both NBC and CBS. Script continuity in the late 1930s and early 1940s was written by Alan Jay Lerner before he found fame as a lyricist. The first number one song on the first episode was &quot;Soon&quot; by Bing Crosby.

Some years passed before the countdown format was introduced, with the number of songs varying from seven to 15. Vocalists in the 1930s included Buddy Clark, Lanny Ross, Kay Thompson and Bea Wain (1939–1944), who was married to the show&#x27;s announcer, French-born André Baruch. Frank Sinatra joined the show in 1943, which gave the show even more popularity. By 1944 however, Sinatra&#x27;s move to Hollywood led to a conflict with American Tobacco as it determined that the singer was the one to pay the production costs (including the telephone hook-up to New York) and was fired for messing up the No. 1 song, &quot;Don&#x27;t Fence Me In&quot; by interjecting a mumble to the effect that the song had too many words and missing a cue. An AFRS transcription survives of this show. As Sinatra zoomed in popularity, he was rehired, returning (1947–49) to co-star with Doris Day.
Hugely popular on CBS through the WWII years, &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot; returned to NBC in 1947. The show&#x27;s opening theme, from the musical revue &quot;George White&#x27;s Scandals of 1926&quot;, was &quot;This Is Your Lucky Day&quot;, with music by Ray Henderson and lyrics by Buddy G. DeSylva, Stephen W. Ballantine and Lew Brown.

Orchestra leaders over the years included Al Goodman, Lennie Hayton, Abe Lyman, Leo Reisman, Harry Salter, Ray Sinatra, Harry Sosnik, Axel Stordahl, Peter Van Steeden, Mark Warnow and Raymond Scott (1949–1957). The chorus was led by musical director Lyn Murray.

Dozens of singers appeared on the radio program, including &quot;Wee&quot; Bonnie Baker, Dorothy Collins, Beryl Davis, Gogo DeLys, Joan Edwards (1941–46), Georgia Gibbs, Dick Haymes, Snooky Lanson, Gisèle MacKenzie, Johnny Mercer, Andy Russell, Dinah Shore, Ginny Simms, Lawrence Tibbett, Martha Tilton, Eileen Wilson, Barry Wood, and occasional guest vocalists. The show featured two tobacco auctioneers, Lee Aubrey &quot;Speed&quot; Riggs of Goldsboro, North Carolina and F.E. Boone of Lexington, Kentucky.

From the summer of 1950 to the start of summer of 1951 (the first year of the Hit Parade television show), the stars of the TV show—Eileen Wilson, Snooky Lanson, and Dorothy Collins—also starred on the Hit Parade radio show. (Wilson had sung on the radio show since 1948.) Beginning in the fall of 1950, the radio show and the TV show both aired on Saturdays; the radio program was heard from 9:00–9:30 pm, Eastern time, and the TV show was seen from 10:30–11:00 pm. Both shows featured the Lucky Strike Orchestra, led by Raymond Scott.

In the fall of 1951, the radio show moved to Thursday nights, and its personnel and format were changed. The show, still sponsored by Lucky Strike, now starred Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians. Vocalists from Lombardo&#x27;s orchestra sang on the new version of the radio show, which also featured a guest female vocalist each week; the guest vocalist was called the &quot;Lucky Star of the Week&quot;. Guy Lombardo was host of the show until January 16, 1953, when the Hit Parade radio program aired for the last time.

====Spin-off series====
The success of the radio show spawned a spin-off series, Your All-Time Hit Parade, sponsored by Lucky Strike and devoted to all-time favorites and standards mixed with some current hits. The program began on NBC February 12, 1943, airing Fridays at 8:30 pm until June 2, 1944, and then Sundays at 7 pm as a summer replacement for Jack Benny, continuing until September 24, 1944. The regular vocalists were Marie Green, Ethel Smith, Martha Stewart, Bea Wain and Jerry Wayne. Lyn Murray led the chorus, and the orchestra was conducted by Mark Warnow.

On December 6, 1948, Lucky Strike introduced yet another musical series, the daytime Your Lucky Strike, aka The Don Ameche Show, since the host was Don Ameche. This 30-minute show, airing weekdays at 3:30 pm on CBS, was a talent competition with little-known and unknown professional vocalists, backed by Al De Crescent on organ or Bill Wardell on piano. The performers were judged by a trio of random housewives casting votes via long-distance phone calls. Winners were booked into the Mocambo, Earl Carroll&#x27;s or other night clubs. Produced by Bernard Schubert and directed by Harlan Dunning, this show also featured auctioneer Riggs. It went off the air March 4, 1949.

During the early 1980s, André Baruch and Bea Wain hosted a syndicated radio version of &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;, reconstructing the list of hits of selected weeks in the 1940s and playing the original recordings.

===Your Hit Parade on television (1950–1959)===
André Baruch continued as the announcer when the program arrived on NBC television in summer 1950 (Del Sharbutt succeeded him in the 1957–58 season), written by William H. Nichols, and produced, in its first years, by both Dan Lounsbery and Ted Fetter. Norman Jewison and Clark Jones (nominated for a 1955 Emmy Award) directed with associate director Bill Colleran. Tony Charmoli won a 1956 Emmy for his choreography, and the show&#x27;s other dance directors were Tom Hansen (1957–58), Peter Gennaro (1958–59) and Ernie Flatt (uncredited). Paul Barnes won an Emmy in 1957 for his art direction. In 1953, the show won a Peabody Award &quot;for consistent good taste, technical perfection and unerring choice of performers.&quot;

The seven top-rated songs of the week were presented in elaborate TV production numbers requiring constant set and costume changes. However, because the top songs sometimes stayed on the charts for many weeks, it was necessary to continually find ways of devising a new and different production number of the same song week after week. After the show was revamped in September 1957, the top songs were reduced to five, while &quot;extras&quot; were increased.

On the TV series, vocalists Dorothy Collins (1950–57, 1958–59), Russell Arms (1952–57), Snooky Lanson (1950–57) and Gisèle MacKenzie (1953–57) were top-billed during the show&#x27;s peak years. During this time, MacKenzie had her own hit record in 1955 with &quot;Hard to Get&quot; which climbed to the #5 ranking in June 1955 and stayed on the charts for 16 weeks. She also starred in her own NBC variety program, &quot;The Gisele MacKenzie Show&quot; from 1957 to 1958, produced by her mentor, comedian Jack Benny. Russell Arms also enjoyed a hit record during his stint on the show – &quot;Cinco Robles (Five Oaks)&quot; (# 22 / 1957)

The line-up of the show&#x27;s other singers included Eileen Wilson (1950–52), Sue Bennett (1951–52), June Valli (1952–53), Alan Copeland (1957–58), Jill Corey (1957–58), Johnny Desmond (1958–59), Virginia Gibson (1957–58), and Tommy Leonetti (1957–58). All were performers of standards, show tunes or big band numbers. Featured prominently were the Hit Parade dancers and the Hit Paraders, the program&#x27;s choral singers. The vocal arranger and choral director of the Hit Parade was Ray Charles (1950–57). He started with the pilot shows in 1949, but did not receive billing until 1955 because he was simultaneously working with a choir on a show sponsored by a competing brand (Chesterfield cigarettes). The Hit Paraders sang the opening commercial jingle (composed by Raymond Scott):
:Be happy, go Lucky,
:Be happy, go Lucky Strike
:Be happy, go Lucky,
:Go Lucky Strike today!
During the 1950–1951 season, Bob Fosse appeared as a guest dancer on several episodes, with partner Mary Ann Niles. From 1950 until 1957, the orchestra was led by well-known bandleader and musician Raymond Scott (who married Dorothy Collins in 1952); the show&#x27;s other music supervisors were Dick Jacobs (1957–58) and Harry Sosnik (1958–59). During the 1957–58 season, sponsor American Tobacco pitched Hit Parade filter cigarettes instead of Lucky Strikes. Alternate sponsors included Avco Manufacturing&#x27;s Crosley division (1951–54), Richard Hudnut hair care products (1954–57), and The Toni Company (1957–58).

&quot;Your Hit Parade&quot; finished in the Nielsen ratings at #29 in the 1950–51 season, #30 in 1953–54, #15 in 1954–55 and #23 in 1955–56.

The show faded with the rise of rock and roll when the performance became more important than the song. The need for visual performances to accompany the songs on television resulted in skits that became more ludicrous as the songs repeated each week. Those issues, along with the growing popularity of rock and roll, contributed to the show&#x27;s eventual cancellation.

In the fall of 1957, the show was revamped: production was moved to Hollywood with a new cast and was now broadcast in color, being the first TV show to be introduced by the animated version of the &quot;Living Color&quot; peacock (introduced one year earlier and nowadays the logo of NBC). American Tobacco also switched sponsorship to its new upscale &quot;Hit Parade&quot; filter brand that had been launched that spring. However, low ratings caused the show to revert to New York and black-and-white in 1958 (sponsorship also reverted to Lucky Strike, as the Hit Parade brand was quietly retired late that year due to low sales), switching to CBS before being cancelled during the spring of 1959. While &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot; was unable to deal with the rock revolution, the show&#x27;s imaginative production concepts had an obvious influence on the wave of music videos that began in the decade that followed.

CBS also brought it back for a brief summer revival in 1974 and 1975. That version featured Kelly Garrett, Sheralee and Chuck Woolery. The 1974 version of &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot; also featured hit songs from a designated week in the 1940s or 1950s. Milton DeLugg conducted the orchestra and Chuck Barris packaged this series.

The show&#x27;s familiar closing theme was &quot;So Long for A While&quot;:
:So long for a while.
:That&#x27;s all the songs for a while.
:So long to &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;,
:And the tunes that you picked to be played.
:So long!

<text>The Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT Kharagpur or IIT-KGP) is a public institute of technology, research university, and autonomous institute established by the Government of India in Kharagpur, West Bengal. Founded in 1951, the institute is the first of the IITs to be established and is recognised as an Institute of National Importance. In 2019 it was awarded the status of Institute of Eminence by the Government of India. IIT Kharagpur is ranked among the most prestigious academic institutions in India.

The institute was initially established to train engineers after India attained independence in 1947. However, over the years, the institute&#x27;s academic capabilities diversified with offerings in management, law, architecture, humanities, etc. IIT Kharagpur has an campus and has about 22,000 residents.

== History ==

=== Foundation ===

In 1946, a committee was set up by Sir Jogendra Singh, Member of the Viceroy&#x27;s executive council, to consider the creation of higher technical institutions for the industrial development of India post World War II. This was followed by the creation of a 22-member committee headed by Nalini Ranjan Sarkar. In its interim report, the Sarkar Committee recommended the establishment of higher technical institutions in India, along the lines of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and consulting from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign along with affiliated secondary institutions. The report urged that work should start with the speedy establishment of major institutions in the four-quarters of the country with the ones in the east and the west to be set up immediately.


On the grounds that West Bengal had the highest concentration of industries at the time, Bidhan Chandra Roy, the Chief Minister of West Bengal, persuaded Jawaharlal Nehru (India&#x27;s first prime minister) to establish the first institute in West Bengal. The first Indian Institute of Technology was thus established in May 1950 as the Eastern Higher Technical Institute. It was located in Esplanade East, Calcutta, and in September 1950 shifted to its permanent campus at Hijli, Kharagpur - south-west of Kolkata (formerly called Calcutta). Hijli had been used as a detention camp during the period of British rule in India, where Indian independence activists were imprisoned.

IIT Kharagpur is the 4th oldest technical institute in the state after IIEST, Shibpur (established as B.E. College in 1856), Jadavpur University (established as the Bengal Technical Institute in 1906) and Rajabazar Science College (established as Calcutta University campus for Science and Technology in 1914). When the first session started in August 1951, there were 224 students and 42 teachers in the ten departments of the institute. The classrooms, laboratories and the administrative office were housed in the historic building of the Hijli Detention Camp (now known as Shaheed Bhawan), where political revolutionaries were imprisoned during the period of British colonial rule. The office building had served as the headquarters of the Bomber Command of the U.S. 20th Air Force during World War II.
=== Early developments ===
The name &quot;Indian Institute of Technology&quot; was adopted before the formal inauguration of the institute on 18 August 1951 by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. On 18 May 1956, a Bill (Bill no 36 of 1956) was introduced in Lok Sabha to declare the institution known as the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur to be an institution of national importance and to provide for its incorporation and matters connected therewith. The motto of the institute, योगः कर्मसु कौशलम् is taken from the Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verse 50, and it has been translated by Sri Aurobindo as &quot;Excellence in action is Yoga&quot;. On 15 September 1956, the Indian Institute of Technology (Kharagpur) Act, 195 of Parliament received the assent of the President. Prime Minister Nehru, in the first convocation address of IIT Kharagpur, said:

The Srinivasa Ramanujan Complex was incorporated as another academic complex of the institute with Takshashila starting operation in 2002, Vikramshila in 2003, and Nalanda in 2012. The erstwhile Hijli Detention camp building, subsequently renamed as the Hijli Saheed Bhavan, hosts the Nehru Museum of Science &amp; Technology and is an imposing building bearing resemblance to the Byzantine style of architecture.
== Campus ==
IIT Kharagpur is located west of Kolkata. The campus is located five kilometres away from Kharagpur Railway Station in West Midnapore district. The layout of the present campus and the design of the buildings were carried out by a group of engineers and architects under the guidance of Werner M. Moser, a Swiss architect. The campus is residence to about 22,000 inhabitants. In 2015, IIT Kharagpur had about 605 faculty members, 1,933 employees and approximately 10,010 students living on the campus. The campus has a total of of roadways. The Institute plans to go Green by 2020.

The 22 student hostels are located on either side of Scholars Avenue, which extends from the institute gate to the B. C. Roy Technology Hospital. The three earliest halls—Patel, Azad, and Nehru—together constitute the PAN loop or Old Campus, which is located just next to Scholar&#x27;s Avenue. There are twelve hostels for undergraduate male students (MMM, LBS, RP, RK, MS, LLR, HJB, JCB, VS, Patel, Azad and Nehru) and two for undergraduate female students (SN/IG and MT). There are post-graduate hostels including four for women (RLB, Gokhle, Nivedita and SAM), two for research scholars (BCR and BRH), and a separate hostel for scholars from the armed forces. The Jnan Ghosh Stadium and the Tata Sports Complex host large-scale sports competitions. The Tagore Open Air Theatre has a capacity of 6,000 people, and is used to host cultural programs. The Science and Technology Entrepreneurs&#x27; Park (STEP) provides infrastructure facilities to alumni seeking to start their own corporations.

In addition to the main campus at Kharagpur, the institute has an extension centre at Kolkata to provide venues for continuing education programmes, distance learning courses, and guesthouse accommodation. The Kolkata extension centre at Rajarhat is used to offer some full-time undergraduate and postgraduate courses. The Rajarhat campus houses 2,500 students. The institute&#x27;s plan for a similar branch campus of in Bhubaneswar was scrapped following rejection by the Union Human Resource and Development ministry.

The Ministry of Human Resource Development on 5 September 2019 awarded the &quot;Institute of Eminence&quot; status to IIT Kharagpur along with four public institution in India, which will enable full autonomy and special incentives.


=== Academic buildings ===
IIT Kharagpur has 19 academic departments, eight multi-disciplinary centres/schools, and 13 schools of excellence in addition to more than 25 central research and development units. Apart from the main building in the central academic complex, the Srinivasa Ramanujan Complex also has common academic facilities. &quot;Takshashila&quot; houses the G. S. Sanyal School of Telecommunication, the School of Information Technology, the Computer and Informatics Centre, and has facilities for conducting lectures. The &quot;Vikramshila&quot; Complex consists of four lecture halls, several seminar rooms, and the 850-seat Kalidas Auditorium. The School of Medical Science and Technology is housed in the basement of the Vikramshila building.

The institute main building houses most of the administrative offices, the lecture halls, and two auditoriums on either side. The signage at the front displays the message, &quot;Dedicated to the service of the nation.&quot; The tower of the main building has a steel tank with 10,000 imperial gallons of water capacity for emergency supply needs. The Netaji Auditorium in the main building is used for official functions and events, and doubles as a cinema theatre on weekend nights, showing films to the IIT community at subsidised rates.

IIT Kharagpur&#x27;s first library was located in a small room of the institute&#x27;s Old Building (&quot;Shaheed Bhawan&quot;). At the time of its opening in 1951, the library had a collection of 2,500 books. Now located in the main building of the institute, the Central Library is one of the largest of its type. Its collection includes over 350,000 books and documents, and it subscribes to more than 1,600 printed and online journals and conference proceedings.

The library has six halls and a section exclusively for SC and ST students. The library&#x27;s collection consists of books, reports, conference proceedings, back volumes of periodicals, standards, theses, micro-forms, DVDs, CD-ROMs, and audio-visual material. The library&#x27;s transaction service is automated and online searches are possible through an Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC). The Electronic Library section has a collection of databases, video lectures and miscellaneous other resources.

The Nehru Museum of Science and Technology has over a hundred indoor exhibits that include technical models collected from institutions across India. The park outside the museum contains 14 open-air demonstrations and outdoor exhibits, including a fighter plane and a steam engine. The museum has an archive room, showing documents relating to the history of the institute and West Midnapore district. The Rural Museum, located in the Rural Development Centre, has a collection of exhibits in local culture.

=== Civic amenities ===
The institute campus has six guest houses, a civic hospital, four nationalised banks, four schools (Hijli High School, Kendriya Vidyalaya, D.A.V Model School, and St. Agnes Branch School), a railway reservation counter and a police station. The campus has a water pumping station, electrical sub-station, telephone exchange, market, six restaurants, and a garbage disposal section for the daily needs of the residents. Construction is presently going on for another guest house and a convention centre with a 2,000 seating capacity. The institute draws its supply of water from wells near the Kosai river (located 112 kilometres away from institute) by harnessing sub-surface water. Three deep wells near the institute supplement the supply from the river. The water is supplied by a pipeline to 12 tanks in the campus with a total capacity of 2,800,000 litres (615,000 imperial gallons). In 2009, students had expressed dissatisfaction with the level of amenities on campus, especially the civic hospital, forcing the director to resign.

IIT Kharagpur is located just outside the town of Kharagpur, in the village of Hijli. Its civic amenities make it nearly self-sufficient with regards to the basic needs of the residents. As Kharagpur is a small town, there is limited direct interaction between the campus community and the town. There is also little employment opportunities for families of the faculty. Unlike some IITs (such as IIT Bombay), IIT Kharagpur does not restrict the entry of outsiders into the campus. IIT Kharagpur provides much of its benefits to the local community through the Rural Development Centre (RDC) located in the campus. Established in 1975, the RDC helps the local community by developing customised technologies. The RDC also co-ordinates the National Service Scheme (NSS) programs in IIT Kharagpur, with the members of NSS taking part in weekly community service activities such as sanitation, road construction, teaching and building educational models.

In 2005, IIT Kharagpur started the construction of a boundary wall to ensure campus security, which is now complete. At present, mild restrictions apply on the entry of outsiders&#x27; vehicles. The boundary wall was opposed by the local community as it would hinder their access to amenities provided by the institute. Campus residents have also been denied direct access to the adjoining Hijli railway station as a result of this wall. The local community opposed the construction of a flyover from the railway station to the campus, stating that it would lead to a substantial loss of opportunity for the shops along the roads. However, upon completion, the Hijli road over-bridge has resulted in convenient transportation to the campus. The construction of the long flyover was approved by the Indian Railways and West Bengal state government, and was constructed for an estimated cost of .

===Halls of residence===
IIT Kharagpur provides on-campus residential facilities to its students, research scholars, faculty members and many of its staff. The students live in hostels (referred to as &quot;halls&quot;) throughout their stay in the IIT. Hostel rooms are wired to provide an internet connection, for which students pay a compulsory charge. Most rooms in the older &quot;halls&quot; are designed to accommodate one student, but an increase in the number of incoming undergraduate students has led to shared rooms in the first two years. The Lal Bahadur Shastri Hall of Residence and newer blocks of some &quot;halls&quot; now accommodate three students per room. The oldest Halls of Residence are located in the PAN Loop, named after the Patel, Azad, and Nehru Halls.

The halls of IIT Kharagpur are:
Undergraduate students choose between the National Cadet Corps (NCC), National Service Scheme (NSS), National Sports Organisation (NSO), or National Cultural Appreciation (NCA) for their first two years of study. IIT Kharagpur has a range of sporting facilities including grounds for cricket, football, hockey, volleyball, lawn tennis, badminton (indoor and outdoor); a state-of-the-art athletics tracks; and swimming pools for aquatic events. Most hostels have their own dedicated sports grounds. The institute used to organise &quot;Shaurya&quot;, an annual inter-collegiate sports and games meet in October, which was discontinued in 2012.

==Organisation and administration==
=== Governance ===

IIT Kharagpur shares a common &quot;Visitor&quot; (a position held by the President of India) and the IIT Council with other IITs. The rest of IIT Kharagpur&#x27;s organisational structure is distinct from that of the other IITs. The Board of Governors of IIT Kharagpur is under the IIT Council, and has 13 members that include representatives of the states of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha, in addition to other members appointed by the IIT Council and the institute&#x27;s Senate. Under the Board of Governors is the institute Director, who serves as the chief academic and executive officer of the IIT, and is aided by the Deputy Director. Under the Director and Deputy Director are the Deans, Heads of Department, the Registrar, President of the Students&#x27; Council, and Chairman of the Hall Management Committee (HMC). The Registrar is the chief administrative officer and oversees day-to-day operations. He is the custodian of records, funds, and other properties of the institute. Under the charge of the heads of departments (HOD) are the faculty (full-time professors as well as those of associate and assistant status). The wardens of hostels are placed under the chairman of the hall management committee in the organisation.

IIT Kharagpur receives comparatively more funding than other engineering colleges in India. While the total government funding to most other engineering colleges is around 100–200 million (US$2–4.5 million) per year, IIT Kharagpur gets nearly per year. Other sources of funds include student fees and research funding by industry-sponsored projects. IIT Kharagpur provide scholarships to all MTech students and research scholars to encourage them to pursue higher studies. The cost borne by undergraduate students, including boarding and mess expenses, is around per annum. 35% of undergraduate students are given additional financial support based on personal need and economic background, with their annual expenses being nearly .

The academic policies of IIT Kharagpur are decided by its senate. It consists of all professors of the institute, and administrative and student representatives. The senate controls and approves the curriculum, courses, examinations and results, and appoints committees to look into specific academic matters. The teaching, training and research activities of the institute are periodically reviewed by the senate to maintain educational standards. The Director of IIT Kharagpur is the &quot;ex officio&quot; chairman of the Institute Senate.

=== Academic Units ===
== Academics ==

Admission to most undergraduate and postgraduate courses in IIT Kharagpur is granted through written entrance examinations. Admissions to M.S. (by Research) and PhD programmes are based on written tests followed by personal interviews.

Admission to undergraduate programmes in all IITs is tied to the Indian Institute of Technology Joint Entrance Examination (IIT-JEE). Since 2013, students have to pass the qualifying JEE Mains examination, followed by the JEE Advanced examination, in order to be admitted to an undergraduate course at an IIT. Candidates who qualify for admission through IIT-JEE apply for admission in four-year B.Tech. (&quot;Bachelor of Technology&quot;), five-year B.Arch. (&quot;Bachelor of Architecture&quot;), five-year Dual Degree (integrated &quot;Bachelor of Technology&quot; and &quot;Master of Technology&quot;), and four year B.S. (&quot;Bachelor of Science)&quot; courses at IIT Kharagpur. Admissions to postgraduate programmes (M.Tech.) are granted primarily through the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE). Other postgraduate entrance exams include Joint Admission to M.Sc. (JAM) for M.Sc., and the Common Admission Test (CAT) conducted by IIMs for management studies.

15% of the seats are reserved for students belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC) and 7.5% for Scheduled Tribes (ST). , 27% separate reservation exists for the &quot;Other Backward Classes&quot;.

IIT Kharagpur is a member of LAOTSE, a network of universities in Europe and Asia exchanging students and senior scholars.

=== Undergraduate education ===
IIT Kharagpur offers degrees as part of its undergraduate programmes. They include Bachelor of Technology (BTech.Hons), Bachelor of Architecture (BArch) and the 5-year integrated Master of Science. The BTech degree is the most common undergraduate degree in IIT Kharagpur in terms of student enrolment. It is based on a four-year programme with eight semesters. The first year of the BTech curriculum has common courses from various departments. At the end of the first year, an option to change departments is given to students on the basis of their performance in the first two semesters. Like other IITs which evaluate their students on the basis of others&#x27; performance IIT Kharagpur also uses relative grading.

From the second year onwards, the students take courses offered by their departments that are known as &quot;depth&quot; courses. In addition to these, the students take inter-disciplinary courses known as &quot;breadth&quot; courses. Separate courses from the humanities and social sciences (HSS) department, and management and information technology are also required. At the end of the third year for the BTech and fourth year for the dual degree, students undertake industrial training for a minimum period of eight working weeks as part of the undergraduate curriculum. In the final year of their studies, most of the students are offered jobs in industries and other organisations through the Training and Placement section of the institute commonly known as Career Development Centre or CDC. Some students opt out of this facility in favour of higher studies or by applying to recruiting organisations directly. In addition to the major degree as part of the undergraduate education, students can take courses from other departments, and by demonstrating knowledge of a discipline based on objectives set by the department, earn a minor in that department. To stay up-to-date with the latest academic and industry standards, IIT Kharagpur revamps its academic curriculum periodically. In August 2017, an Undergraduate Council(UG Council) was constituted by the institute under the Dean of Undergraduate Studies(Dean UGS) as its chairman and with one student representative from each department to be elected/nominated for an annual term, to assist in the process of curriculum update, assimilate student feedback on different academic policies, and forward suggestions and proposals to the institute senate.

=== Postgraduate and doctoral education ===

IIT Kharagpur offers postgraduate programmes including Master of Technology (MTech), Master of Business Administration (MBA), and Master of Sciences (MSc). Some specialised post graduate programmes offered by IIT Kharagpur include Master of Human Resource Management (MHRM), Postgraduate Diploma in Information Technology (PGDIT), Master in Medical Science and Technology (MMST), Master of City Planning (MCP), LL.B in Intellectual Property Law (LL.B Honors in IP Law), and Postgraduate Diploma in Maritime Operation and Management (PGDMOM). The institute offers the Doctor of Philosophy degree (PhD) as part of its doctoral education programme. The doctoral scholars are given a topic by the professor, or work on the consultancy projects sponsored by industry. The duration of the programme is usually unspecified and depends on the discipline. PhD scholars submit a dissertation as well as conduct an oral defence of their thesis. Teaching assistantships (TA) and research assistantships (RA) are provided based on the scholar&#x27;s academic profile. IIT Kharagpur offers an M.S. (by research) programme; the MTech and M.S. being similar to the US universities&#x27; non-thesis (course-based) and thesis (research-based) master programmes respectively.
IIT Kharagpur (along with other IITs) offers Dual Degree programs that integrate undergraduate and postgraduate studies in selected pairs of branches and specialisations. Most of the Dual Degree programs involve specialisation in the major field of education of the student. For a dual degree involving an MBA from Vinod Gupta School of Management, the selection is made on the basis of an aptitude test of students across all engineering streams. The Dual Degree program spans five years as against six years in conventional BTech (four years) followed by an MTech or MBA (two years).

IIT Kharagpur has a management school (Vinod Gupta School of Management), an entrepreneurship school (Rajendra Mishra School of Engineering Entrepreneurship) and a law school (Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law) on its premises. The Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law has been opened in collaboration with George Washington University. Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law is the only law school in IIT System of the country The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) ranked the institute 5th in its law ranking of 2024.

==Placements at IIT Kharagpur==
Prior to 2006, an internal policy at IIT Kharagpur allowed only Indian companies to apply for the campus recruitment drive. This was overturned by the Career Development Center (CDC) so as to not limit placement opportunities for graduates. Oil giants Schlumberger and Shell offered annual salaries to the tune of $80,000 that year.

The top domestic compensation in 2008 came in at per annum. In the 2011 batch, Goldman Sachs recruited 10 students on a package of per annum. Barclays Capital recruited 11 students with a compensation package of per annum in December 2009. The highest salary offered till now is per annum by social networking site Facebook in an off-shore recruitment (of which employee stock ownership plans [ESOPs] were offered valued at 10 million) in December 2010. The 2010 batch of BTech students saw 94% placements. Deutsche Bank recruited 9 students on a package of per annum. For the 2012 batch, Facebook has made the highest offer $150,000 to four students.

<text>Brook Farm, also called the Brook Farm Institute of Agriculture and Education or the Brook Farm Association for Industry and Education, was a utopian experiment in communal living in the United States in the 1840s. It was founded by former Unitarian minister George Ripley and his wife Sophia Ripley at the Ellis Farm in West Roxbury, Massachusetts (nine miles outside of downtown Boston), in 1841 and was inspired in part by the ideals of transcendentalism, a religious and cultural philosophy based in New England. Founded as a joint stock company, it promised its participants a portion of the farm&#x27;s profits in exchange for an equal share of the work. Brook Farmers believed that by sharing the workload, they would have ample time for leisure and intellectual pursuits.

Life on Brook Farm was based on balancing labor and leisure while working together for the community&#x27;s benefit. Each member could choose whatever work they found most appealing and all were paid equally, including women. Revenue came from farming and from selling handmade products like clothing, as well as fees paid by the farm&#x27;s many visitors. The main source of income was the school, which was overseen by Mrs. Ripley. A preschool, primary school, and a college preparatory school attracted children internationally and each child was charged for his or her education. Adult education was also offered.

The community was never financially stable and had difficulty profiting from its agricultural pursuits. By 1844, the Brook Farmers adopted a societal model based on the socialist concepts of Charles Fourier and began publishing &quot;The Harbinger&quot; as an unofficial journal promoting Fourierism. Following his vision, the community began building an ambitious structure called the Phalanstery. When the uninsured building burned down, the community was financially devastated and never recovered. It was fully closed by 1847. Despite the commune&#x27;s failure, many Brook Farmers looked back on their experience favorably. The commune&#x27;s critics included Charles Lane, founder of another utopian community, Fruitlands. Nathaniel Hawthorne was a founding member of Brook Farm, though not a strong adherent of the community&#x27;s ideals. He later fictionalized his experience in his novel &quot;The Blithedale Romance&quot; (1852).

After Brook Farm closed, the property was operated for most of the next 130 years by a Lutheran organization, first as an orphanage, and then a treatment center and school. Fire destroyed the Transcendentalists&#x27; buildings over the years. In 1988, the State of Massachusetts acquired of the farm, which is now operated by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation as a historic site. Brook Farm was one of Massachusetts&#x27;s first sites to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places and be designated a National Historic Landmark. In 1977, the Boston Landmarks Commission designated Brook Farm a Boston Landmark, the city&#x27;s highest recognition for historic sites.

== History ==

===Planning and background===

In October 1840, George Ripley announced to the Transcendental Club that he was planning to form a Utopian community. Brook Farm, as it would be called, was based on the ideals of Transcendentalism; its founders believed that by pooling labor they could sustain the community and still have time for literary and scientific pursuits. The experiment was meant to serve as an example for the rest of the world, based on the principles of &quot;industry without drudgery, and true equality without its vulgarity&quot;. At Brook Farm, as in other communities, physical labor was perceived as a condition of mental well-being and health. Brook Farm was one of at least 80 communal experiments active in the United States in the 1840s, though it was the first to be secular. Ripley believed his experiment would be a model for the rest of society. He predicted: &quot;If wisely executed, it will be a light over this country and this age. If not the sunrise, it will be the morning star.&quot; As more interested people began to take part in planning, Ripley relocated meetings from his home to the West Street bookshop operated by Elizabeth Palmer Peabody.

===Beginnings===
Ripley and his wife Sophia formed a joint stock company in 1841 along with 10 other investors. He sold shares of the company for $500 with a promise of 5% of the profits to each investor. Shareholders were also allowed a single vote in decision-making and several held director positions. The Ripleys chose to begin their experiment at a dairy farm owned by Charles and Maria Mayo Ellis in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, near the home of Theodore Parker. They began raising money, including holding a meeting at Peabody&#x27;s bookshop to raise $10,000 for the farm&#x27;s purchase. The site was eventually purchased on October 11, 1841, for $10,500, though participants began moving in as early as April. The farm about eight miles (13 km) from Boston was described in a pamphlet as a &quot;place of great natural beauty, combining a convenient nearness to the city with a degree of retirement and freedom from unfavorable influences unusual even in the country&quot;. The purchase also covered a neighboring Keith farm, about , &quot;consisting altogether of a farm with dwelling house, barn, and outbuildings thereon situated&quot;.

The first major public notice of the community was published in August 1841. &quot;The Community at West Roxbury, Mass.&quot; was likely written by Elizabeth Palmer Peabody. Though they began with 10 investors, eventually 32 people became Brook Farmers. Writer and editor Margaret Fuller was invited to Brook Farm and, though she never officially joined the community, was a frequent visitor, often spending New Year&#x27;s Eve there. Ripley received many applications to join the community, especially from people who had little money or were in poor health, but full-fledged membership was granted only to those who could afford a $500 share of the joint stock company.

One of Brook Farm&#x27;s founders was author Nathaniel Hawthorne. Hawthorne did not particularly agree with the experiment&#x27;s ideals, hoping only that it would help him raise enough money to begin his life with his wife-to-be, Sophia Peabody. She considered moving there as well and even visited in May 1841, though Hawthorne sent her away. Ripley was aware of Hawthorne&#x27;s motivations, and tried to convince him to get involved more fully by appointing him as one of four trustees, specifically overseeing &quot;Direction of Finance&quot;. After requesting his initial investment returned, Hawthorne resigned from Brook Farm on October 17, 1842. He wrote of his displeasure with the community: &quot;even my Custom House experience was not such a thraldom and weariness; my mind and heart were freer ...Thank God, my soul is not utterly buried under a dung-heap.&quot;

===Fourier inspiration===

In the late 1830s, Ripley became increasingly engaged in &quot;Associationism&quot;, an early socialist movement based on the work of Charles Fourier. Horace Greeley, a New York newspaper editor, and others began to pressure Brook Farm to follow more closely the pattern of Fourier at a time when the community was struggling to be self-sufficient. Albert Brisbane, whose book &quot;The Social Destiny of Man&quot; (1840) had inspired Ripley, paid Greeley $500 for permission to publish a front-page column in the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; that ran in several parts from March 1842 to September 1843. Brisbane argued in the series, titled &quot;Association: or, Principles of a True Organization of Society&quot;, that Fourier&#x27;s theories could be applied in the United States. He published similar articles in 1842 in &quot;The Dial&quot;, the journal of the Transcendentalists. Fourier&#x27;s societal vision included elaborate plans for specific structures and highly organized roles for its members. He called his system for an ideal community a &quot;Phalanx&quot;.

To meet this vision, now under the name &quot;Brook Farm Association for Industry and Education&quot;, Brook Farmers committed themselves to constructing an ambitious communal building known as the Phalanstery. Construction began in the summer of 1844. The structure would accommodate 14 families and single people as well. It was planned to be by and include, as Ripley wrote, &quot;a large and commodious kitchen, a dining-hall capable of seating from three to four hundred persons, two public saloons, and a spacious hall or lecture room&quot;.

Ripley and two associates created a new constitution for Brook Farm in 1844, beginning the experiment&#x27;s attempts to follow Fourier&#x27;s Phalanx system. Many Brook Farmers supported the transition; at a dinner in honor of Fourier&#x27;s birthday, one member of the group proposed a toast to &quot;Fourier, the second coming of Christ&quot;. Others did not share that enthusiasm, and some left the commune. One of those who left was Isaac Hecker, who converted to Catholicism and went on to become the founder of the first American-based order of priests, the Paulist Fathers, in 1858. In particular, many Brook Farmers thought the new model was too rigid and structured and too different from the carefree aspects that had attracted them. Both supporters and detractors called the early part of Brook Farm&#x27;s history the &quot;Transcendental days&quot;. Ripley himself became a celebrity proponent of Fourierism and organized conventions throughout New England to discuss the community.
In the last few months of 1844, Brook Farmers were offered the chance to take over two Associationism-inspired publications, Brisbane&#x27;s &quot;The Phalanx&quot; and John Allen&#x27;s &quot;The Social Reformer&quot;. Four printers were part of Brook Farm at the time and members of the community believed it would elevate their status as leaders of the movement, as well as provide additional income. Ultimately, the Brook Farmers published a new journal combining the two, &quot;The Harbinger&quot;. The journal&#x27;s first issue was published on June 14, 1845, and it was continuously printed, originally weekly, until October 1847, when it relocated to New York City, still under the oversight of Ripley and fellow Brook Farmer Charles Anderson Dana. Naming the publication turned out to be a difficult task. Parke Godwin offered advice when it was suggested to keep the name &quot;The Phalanx&quot;:

===Decline and dissolution===
Brook Farm began to decline rapidly after its restructuring. In October 1844, Orestes Brownson visited the site and sensed that &quot;the atmosphere of the place is horrible&quot;. To save money, &quot;retrenchments&quot;, or sacrifices, were called for, particularly at the dinner table. Meat, coffee, tea, and butter were no longer offered, though it was agreed that a separate table with meat be allowed in December 1844. That Thanksgiving, a neighbor donated a turkey. Many Brook Farmers applied for exceptions to these rules and soon it was agreed that &quot;members of the Association who sit at the meat table shall be charged extra for their board&quot;. Life on Brook Farm was further worsened by an outbreak of smallpox in November 1845; though no one died, 26 Brook Farmers were infected. Ripley attempted to quell the financial difficulties by negotiating with creditors and stockholders, who agreed to cancel $7,000 of debt.

Construction on the Phalanstery progressed well until March 3, 1846, when it was discovered that it had caught fire. Within two hours, the structure had completely burned down; firefighters from Boston arrived too late. The fire was likely caused by a defective chimney. One participant noted, &quot;Ere long the flames were chasing one another in a mad riot over the structure; running across long corridors and up and down the supporting columns of wood, until the huge edifice was a mass of firework&quot;. The financial blow from the loss of the uninsured building was $7,000 and it marked the beginning of the end of Brook Farm.

Ripley, who had begun the experiment, made an unofficial break with Brook Farm in May 1846. Many others began to leave as well, though the farm&#x27;s dissolution was slow. As one Brook Farmer said, the community&#x27;s slow decline was like apple petals drifting slowly to the ground, making it seem &quot;dreamy and unreal&quot;. On November 5, 1846, Ripley&#x27;s book collection, which had served as Brook Farm&#x27;s library, was auctioned to help cover the association&#x27;s debts. By the end, Brook Farm had a total debt of $17,445. Ripley told a friend, &quot;I can now understand how a man would feel if he could attend his own funeral&quot;. He took a job with the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; and it took him 13 years to repay Brook Farm&#x27;s debt, which he did in 1862.

==After Brook Farm==

A man named John Plummer purchased the land that was Brook Farm in 1849 before selling it six years later to James Freeman Clarke, who intended to establish another community there. Instead, Clarke offered it to President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War and the 2nd Massachusetts Infantry Regiment used it for training as Camp Andrew.

Clarke sold the property in 1868 to two brothers, who used it as a summer boarding house. In 1870, Gottlieb F. Burckhardt purchased the property, after which he formed the Association of the Evangelical Lutheran Church for Works of Mercy to operate an orphanage in The Hive, as the property&#x27;s main house. The orphanage opened in 1872 and operated until 1943. In 1948 the Lutherans converted it into a treatment center and school, which closed in 1977. Parts of the farm were separated in 1873 for use as a cemetery, a use that continues today as a non-denominational cemetery known as the Gardens of Gethsemene (as part of St. Joseph&#x27;s Cemetery and the Baker Street Jewish Cemeteries). During the period of Lutheran ownership the only now extant building, a c. 1890 print shop, was built on the land; the buildings associated with the Transcendentalists, most recently the Margaret Fuller Cottage, had burned down by the 1980s.

In 1988, the Metropolitan District Commission (since merged with the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, or DCR) purchased of the original land. The farm was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1965, a Boston Landmark in 1977, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The DCR now operate the state-owned portion as a historic site; the West Roxbury Historical Society periodically offers tours.

== Landscape and facilities ==
Brook Farm was named for the brook that ran near the roadside and eventually went to the Charles River. It was surrounded by low hills and its meadows and sunny slopes were diversified by orchard, quiet groves and denser pine woods. But the land turned out to be difficult to farm.

The land on the Keith lot that was purchased along with the Ellis farm included a functional farmhouse, which Brook Farmers called &quot;The Hive&quot;. The Hive became the center for social activities and was where community members went for three meals a day. The Hive&#x27;s dining room held 50 people and its library was stocked with Ripley&#x27;s personal book collection, which was made available to all members.

As the community grew, it became necessary to add more buildings for lodgings and various activities. The first building constructed was &quot;The Nest&quot;, where school lessons took place and where guests of the farm would stay. Mr. and Mrs. Ripley&#x27;s house, later called the Eyrie, was built during the second year. The next building to be built was the Margaret Fuller Cottage; though named after Fuller, she never spent a night there. A Brook Farm participant named Ichabod Morton built the Pilgrim House, named in honor of his home town of Plymouth, Massachusetts. The -story building was the third structure built that year, at a cost of nearly $5,000. Morton stayed there only two weeks before moving out, after which the building was used for general lodging and also held laundry facilities. The many constructions, including greenhouses and small craft shops, quickly reduced the treasury.

=== Work and finances ===

Participants at Brook Farm were also shareholders and were promised 5% of the annual profits or free tuition for one student. In exchange for 300 days of work per year, they were granted free room and board. Members performed whatever work most appealed to them and all, including women, were paid equal wages. The philosophy of labor, according to Ripley, was &quot;to insure a more natural union between intellectual and manual labor than now exists; to combine the thinker and the worker, as far as possible, in the same individual.&quot;

The organization of work in Brook Farm changed over time because of both financial troubles and changes in ideology. Members of Brook Farm initially participated in an &quot;attractive industry&quot; system where each could pick his or her work assignments based on their preferences. This method had no specific authority to ensure that essential tasks were done. After initial leniency, some sensed that not all members were doing their fair share of the labor, so in 1841 the community adopted standards for work: ten hours of work were required per day during the summer and eight hours during winter. When Brook Farm first adopted Fourierist notions, it created a more structured work environment with a system that consisted of three series of industry: agriculture, mechanical, and domestic. Within each series were a number of groups that handled more specific tasks. Each group had a chief who kept a record of the work done. While this system created a new work hierarchy, the members still had the flexibility to move between groups easily. These new measures caused Brook Farm to make a profit in 1844, a feat it had not accomplished in its first few years of existence.

Typical work duties at Brook Farm included chopping wood, bringing in firewood, milking cows, turning a grindstone, and other farming chores. Not all were farmers, however. Some worked in the trades, including making shoes, and others were teachers. Regardless of the job, all were considered equal and because of the job distribution, as Elizabeth Peabody wrote, &quot;no one has any great weight in any one thing&quot;. In exchange for their work, participants were granted several &quot;guarantees&quot;, including &quot;medical attendance, nursing, education in all departments, amusements&quot;. There were some occasional conflicts between different workers, partly because those who were educators believed themselves more aristocratic; overall, however, as historian Charles Crowe wrote, &quot;indeed all aspects of communal life operated with surprisingly little friction&quot; in general.

People visited Brook Farm frequently, totaling an estimated 1,150 each year, and each was charged for their visit. Between November 1844 and October 1845, surviving records show that $425 was collected from visitor fees. The list of visitors included theologian Henry James, Sr., sculptor William Wetmore Story, artist John Sartain, and British social reformer Robert Owen.

Despite multiple sources of income, the community was in constant debt almost immediately after it began. The community, including Ripley, had difficulty with farming, in particular because of poor soil and not enough labor. The major crop was hay, which was sold at low-grade prices; vegetables, milk, and fruit were not produced in sufficient numbers to be profitable. The property was mortgaged four times between 1841 and 1845. Brook Farm got into the habit of spending money before it had been raised. One Brook Farmer wrote, &quot;I think here lies the difficulty,—we have not had business men to conduct our affairs ... those among us who have some business talents, see this error&quot;.

===Education===
On September 29, 1841, the &quot;Brook Farm Institute of Agriculture and Education&quot; was organized. The school was Brook Farm&#x27;s most immediate (and at times only) source of income and attracted students from as far away as Cuba and the Philippines. Children under 12 were charged $3.50 per week and, at first, boys over 12 were charged $4 a week and girls were charged $5; by August 1842, the rates were made identical. Adult education was also available in the evenings. The schedule for adults included courses on moral philosophy, German language, and modern European history.

Within the school there was an infant school for children under six, a primary school for children under ten, and a preparatory school that prepared children for college in six years. When entering the school, each pupil under high-school age was assigned a woman of the community who was in charge of his/her wardrobe, personal habits, and exercise. The teachers included three graduates of Harvard Divinity School (George Ripley, George Partridge Bradford, and John Sullivan Dwight) and several women (Ripley&#x27;s wife Sophia, his sister Marianne, and his cousin Hannah, Georgianna Bruce, and Abby Morton). Ripley was in charge of teaching English and was known to be relaxed in his class. Dana taught languages, speaking ten himself. Dwight taught music and Latin. Students studied European languages and literature and, at no extra cost, pupils could also indulge in the fine arts. The primary school was overseen by Sophia and Marianne Ripley, using a progressive child-centered pedagogy that has been compared to John Dewey&#x27;s later reforms. Sophia Ripley&#x27;s dedication to the school was remarked upon by many; she missed only two classes in six years.

=== Leisure ===
The people of Brook Farm spent most of their time either studying or working the farm, but they always set aside time for play. In their free time, they enjoyed music, dancing, card games, drama, costume parties, sledding, and skating. Every week, the community would gather at The Hive for a dance by the young ladies of the community. They wore wreaths of wild daisies on their heads, and each week a special wreath, bought from a florist, was given to the best-dressed girl. At the end of every day, many performed a &quot;symbol of Universal Unity&quot;, in which they stood in a circle and joined hands and vowed for &quot;truth to the cause of God and Humanity&quot;.

Spirits remained high throughout the experiment, regardless of the community&#x27;s financial standing. The social structure demanded selflessness and people rarely failed to fulfill their duties, a requirement to earn leisure time. Leisure time was important to Brook Farm&#x27;s philosophy. As Elizabeth Palmer Peabody wrote for &quot;The Dial&quot; in January 1842, &quot;none will be engaged merely in bodily labor ... This community aims to be rich, not in the metallic representative of wealth, but in ... leisure to live in all the faculties of the soul&quot;.

=== Role of women ===
At Brook Farm, women could go beyond their typical sphere of tasks and their labor was highly valued. They did have tasks typical of other women at the time, such as simple food preparation, and shared housekeeping. But during harvest time, women were allowed to work in the fields and men even helped out with laundry during the cold weather. Because no single religion could impose its beliefs on the community, women were safe from the typical patriarchy associated with religion at the time. Because of the community&#x27;s focus on individual freedom, women were autonomous from their husbands and allowed to become stockholders. Women also played an important role in providing sources of income. Many devoted time to making, in Brook Farmer Marianne Dwight&#x27;s words, &quot;elegant and tasteful caps, capes, collars, undersleeves, etc., etc.,&quot; for sale at Boston shops. Others painted screens and lampshades for sale. Women were allowed to go to school and, because of the well-known education of women at Brook Farm, many female writers and performers visited. Sophia Ripley, who had written an outspoken feminist essay for &quot;The Dial&quot; on &quot;Woman&quot; before moving to Brook Farm, was very educated and taught history and foreign languages at the farm.

==Criticism==
Many people in the community wrote of how much they enjoyed their experience and the lighthearted atmosphere. One participant, John Codman, joined the community at age 27 in 1843. He wrote, &quot;It was for the meanest a life above humdrum, and for the greatest something far, infinitely far beyond. They looked into the gates of life and saw beyond charming visions, and hopes springing up for all&quot;. But the community&#x27;s idealism was sometimes not lived up to. Because the community was officially secular, a variety of religions were represented, though not always amicably. When Isaac Hecker and, later, Sophia Ripley converted to Catholicism, a Protestant Brook Farmer complained, &quot;We are beginning to see wooden crosses around and pictures of saints ... and I suspect that rosaries are rattling under aprons.&quot;

Nathaniel Hawthorne, eventually elected treasurer of the community, did not enjoy his experience. Initially, he praised the work he was doing, boasting of &quot;what a great, broad-shouldered, elephantine personage I shall become by and by!&quot; Later, he wrote to his wife-to-be Sophia Peabody, &quot;labor is the curse of the world, and nobody can meddle with it without becoming proportionately brutified&quot;. After dissociating with the community, Hawthorne demanded the return of his initial investment, though he never held any ill will toward Ripley, to whom he wrote he would &quot;heartily rejoice at your success—of which I can see no reasonable doubt&quot;.

Many outside Brook Farm were critical of it, especially in the press. The New York &quot;Observer&quot;, for example, wrote, &quot;The Associationists, under the pretense of a desire to promote order and morals, design to overthrow the marriage institution, and in the place of the divine law, to substitute the &#x27;passions&#x27; as the proper regulator of the intercourse of the sexes&quot;, concluding that they were &quot;secretly and industriously aiming to destroy the foundation of society&quot;. Edgar Allan Poe expressed his opinions on the community in an article titled &quot;Brook Farm&quot; in the December 13, 1845, issue of the &quot;Broadway Journal&quot;. He wrote that he had &quot;sincere respect&quot; for the group and that its journal, &quot;The Harbinger&quot;, was &quot;conducted by an assemblage of well-read persons who mean no harm—and who, perhaps, can do no less&quot;. Despite many critics, none suggested George Ripley be replaced as Brook Farm&#x27;s leader.

Ralph Waldo Emerson never joined the Brook Farm community, despite several invitations. He wrote to Ripley on December 15, 1840, of his &quot;conviction that the Community is not good for me&quot;. He also questioned the community&#x27;s idealism, particularly its optimism that all members would share responsibility and workload equally. As he wrote, &quot;The country members naturally were surprised to observe that one man ploughed all day and one looked out of a window all day ... and both received at night the same wages&quot;. Twenty years later, Emerson publicly denounced the experiment in his essay collection &quot;The Conduct of Life&quot;. Charles Lane, one of the founders of another community called Fruitlands, thought the Brook Farmers&#x27; lifestyle did not sacrifice enough. He said they were &quot;playing away their youth and day-time in a miserably joyous frivolous manner&quot;. Like other communities, Brook Farm was criticized for its potential to break up the nuclear family because of its focus on working as a larger community. After its conversion to Fourierism, the Transcendentalists showed less support for it. Henry David Thoreau questioned the community members&#x27; idealism and wrote in his journal, &quot;As for these communities, I think I had rather keep bachelor&#x27;s hall in hell than go to board in heaven&quot;. Even Sophia Ripley later questioned their original optimism, calling it &quot;childish, empty, &amp; sad&quot;.

== In fiction ==

Though a founding member, Hawthorne was unhappy during his tenure as a Brook Farmer, partly because he was unable to write while living there. &quot;I have no quiet at all&quot;, he complained, and his hands were covered &quot;with a new crop of blisters—the effect of raking hay&quot;. He presented a fictionalized portrait of his experience in his 1852 novel &quot;The Blithedale Romance&quot;. He acknowledged the resemblance in his introduction, saying &quot;in the &#x27;Blithedale&#x27; of this volume, many readers will probably suspect a faint and not very faithful shadowing of Brook Farm, in West Roxbury, which (now a little more than ten years ago) was occupied and cultivated by a company of socialists.&quot; The chapter called &quot;The Masqueraders&quot;, for example, was based on a picnic held one September to celebrate the harvest season. George Ripley, who reviewed the book for the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, said that former Brook Farmers would only notice the resemblance in the humorous parts of the story. Some have also seen a resemblance between Margaret Fuller and Hawthorne&#x27;s fictional character Zenobia. In the novel, a visitor—a writer like Hawthorne—finds that hard farm labor is not conducive to intellectual creativity. In his introduction, Hawthorne insisted that, although his experience with Brook Farm undoubtedly influenced his concept of a utopian community, the characters in his novel did not represent any specific Brook Farmers.

<doc id="294903" wikidata="Q585110" url="?curid=294903" title="Restoration Movement">
<text>The Restoration Movement (also known as the American Restoration Movement or the Stone–Campbell Movement, and pejoratively as Campbellism) is a Christian movement that began on the United States frontier during the Second Great Awakening (1790–1840) of the early 19th century. The pioneers of this movement were seeking to reform the church from within and sought &quot;the unification of all Christians in a single body patterned after the church of the New Testament.&quot;

The Restoration Movement developed from several independent strands of religious revival that idealized early Christianity. Two groups which independently developed similar approaches to the Christian faith were particularly important. The first, led by Barton W. Stone, began at Cane Ridge, Kentucky, and identified as &quot;Christians&quot;. The second began in western Pennsylvania and Virginia (now West Virginia) and was led by Thomas Campbell and his son, Alexander Campbell, both educated in Scotland; they eventually used the name &quot;Disciples of Christ&quot;. Both groups sought to restore the Christian church based on visible patterns set forth in the New Testament, and both believed that creeds kept Christianity divided. In 1832 they joined in fellowship with a handshake.

Among other things, they were united in the belief that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; that Christians should celebrate the Lord&#x27;s Supper on the first day of each week; and that baptism of adult believers was necessarily by immersion in water. Because the founders wanted to abandon all denominational labels, they used the biblical names for the followers of Jesus. Both groups promoted a return to the purposes of the 1st-century churches as described in the New Testament. One historian of the movement has argued that it was primarily a unity movement, with the restoration motif playing a subordinate role.

The Restoration Movement has since divided into multiple separate groups. The three main groups are: the Churches of Christ, the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), and the independent Christian Church/Church of Christ congregations. Additionally, there are the International Churches of Christ, the International Christian Church, the Churches of Christ in Europe, and the Evangelical Christian Church in Canada, and the Churches of Christ in Australia. Some characterize the divisions in the movement as the result of the tension between the goals of restoration and ecumenism: the Churches of Christ and unaffiliated Christian Church/Church of Christ congregations resolved the tension by stressing restoration, while the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) resolved the tension by stressing ecumenism.

Because the Restoration Movement lacks any centralized structure, having originated in a variety of places with different leaders, there is no consistent nomenclature for the movement as a whole. The term &quot;Restoration Movement&quot; became popular during the 19th century; this appears to be the influence of Alexander Campbell&#x27;s essays on &quot;A Restoration of the Ancient Order of Things&quot; in the &quot;Christian Baptist.&quot; The term &quot;Stone-Campbell Movement&quot; emerged towards the end of the 19th century as a way to avoid the difficulties associated with some of the other names that have been used and to maintain a sense of the collective history of the movement.

==Principles==
The Restoration Movement has been characterized by several key principles:
* Christianity should not be divided; Christ intended the creation of church.
* Creeds divide, but Christians should be able to find agreement by standing on the Bible (from which they believe all creeds are but human expansions or constrictions)
* Ecclesiastical traditions divide, but Christians should be able to find common ground by following the practice (as best as it can be determined) of the early church.
* Names of human origin divide, but Christians should be able to find common ground by using biblical names for the church (i.e., &quot;Christian Church&quot;, &quot;Church of God&quot; or &quot;Church of Christ&quot; as opposed to &quot;Methodist&quot; or &quot;Lutheran&quot;, etc.).
Thus, the church &quot;should stress only what all Christians hold in common and should suppress all divisive doctrines and practices&quot;.

Several slogans have been used in the Restoration Movement, which are intended to express some of the distinctive themes of the movement:
* &quot;Where the Scriptures speak, we speak; where the Scriptures are silent, we are silent.&quot;
* &quot;The church of Jesus Christ on earth is essentially, intentionally, and constitutionally one.&quot;
* &quot;We are Christians only, but not the only Christians.&quot;
* &quot;In essentials, unity; in opinions, liberty; in all things love.&quot;
* &quot;No creed but Christ, no book but the Bible, no law but love, no name but the divine.&quot;
* &quot;Do Bible things in Bible ways.&quot;
* &quot;Call Bible things by Bible names.&quot;

==Background==
During the late Middle Ages, dissenters such as John Wycliffe and John Huss called for a restoration of a primitive form of Christianity, but they were driven underground. As a result, it is difficult to find any direct links between such early dissenters and the restoration movement. Beginning with the Renaissance, intellectual roots become easier to discern. At the heart of the Reformation was an emphasis on the principle of &quot;Scripture alone&quot; (&quot;sola scriptura&quot;). This, along with the related insistence on the right of individuals to read the Bible and interpret it for themselves and a movement to reduce rituals in worship, formed part of the intellectual background of early Restoration Movement leaders. The branch of the Reformation movement which was represented by Huldrych Zwingli and John Calvin contributed an emphasis on &quot;restoring biblical forms and patterns.&quot;
The rationalism of John Locke provided another influence. Reacting to the deism of Lord Herbert, Locke sought a way to address religious divisions and persecution without abandoning Scripture. To do this, Locke argued against the right of government to enforce religious orthodoxy and turned to the Bible to supply a set of beliefs that all Christians could agree upon. The core teachings which he viewed as essential were the messiahship of Jesus and Jesus&#x27; direct commands. Christians could be devoutly committed to other Biblical teachings, but in Locke&#x27;s view these were non-essentials over which Christians should never fight or try to coerce each other. Unlike the Puritans and the later Restoration Movement, Locke did not call for a systematic restoration of the early church. One of the basic goals of the English Puritans was to restore a pure, &quot;primitive&quot; church that would be a true apostolic community. This conception was a critical influence in the development of the Puritans in Colonial America. It has been described as the &quot;oldest ecumenical movement in America&quot;: 
During the First Great Awakening, a movement developed among those Baptists known as Separate Baptists. Two themes of this movement were the rejection of creeds and &quot;freedom in the Spirit.&quot; The Separate Baptists saw Scripture as the &quot;perfect rule&quot; for the church. However, while they turned to the Bible for a structural pattern for the church, they did not insist on complete agreement on the details of that pattern. This group originated in New England but was especially strong in the South where the emphasis on a biblical pattern for the church grew stronger. In the last half of the 18th century, Separate Baptists became more numerous on the western frontier of Kentucky and Tennessee, where the Stone and Campbell movements would later take root. The development of the Separate Baptists in the southern frontier helped prepare the ground for the Restoration Movement. The membership of both the Stone and Campbell groups drew heavily from the ranks of the Separate Baptists. Separate Baptist restorationism also contributed to the development of the Landmark Baptists in the same region as the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement and at about the same time. Under the leadership of James Robinson Graves, this group wanted to define a precise blueprint for the primitive church, believing that any deviation from that blueprint would prevent a person from being part of the true church.

James O&#x27;Kelly was an early advocate of seeking unity through a return to New Testament Christianity. In 1792, dissatisfied with the role of bishops in the Methodist Episcopal Church, he separated from that body. O&#x27;Kelly&#x27;s movement, centering in Virginia and North Carolina, was originally called Republican Methodists. In 1794 they adopted the name Christian Church. During the same period, Elias Smith of Vermont and Abner Jones of New Hampshire led a movement espousing views similar to those of O&#x27;Kelly. They believed that members could, by looking to scripture alone, simply be Christians without being bound to human traditions and the denominations brought by immigrants from Europe.
The ideal of restoring a &quot;primitive&quot; form of Christianity grew in popularity in the U.S. after the American Revolution. This desire to restore a purer form of Christianity played a role in the development of many groups during this period, known as the Second Great Awakening. These included the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Baptists and Shakers. The Restoration Movement began during, and was greatly influenced by, this Second Awakening. While the Campbells resisted what they saw as the spiritual manipulation of the camp meetings, the Southern phase of the awakening &quot;was an important matrix of Barton Stone&#x27;s reform movement&quot; and shaped the evangelistic techniques used by both Stone and the Campbells.

==Stone movement==


===Cane Ridge revival===

In 1801, the Cane Ridge Revival in Kentucky planted the seed for a movement in Kentucky and the Ohio River valley to disassociate from denominationalism. In 1803 Barton W. Stone and others withdrew from the Kentucky Synod and formed the Springfield Presbytery. The defining event of the Stone wing of the movement was the publication of &quot;Last Will and Testament of The Springfield Presbytery,&quot; at Cane Ridge, Kentucky, in 1804. The brief document announces their withdrawal from Presbyterianism and their intention to be solely part of the body of Christ. The writers appeal for the unity of all who follow Jesus, suggest the value of congregational self-governance, and declare the Bible as the source for understanding the will of God. They denounced the &quot;divisive&quot; use of the Westminster Confession of Faith and adopted the name &quot;Christian&quot; to identify their group. 
By 1804 Elias Smith had heard of the Stone movement and the O&#x27;Kelly movement by 1808. Although not formally merged, the three groups were cooperating and fellowshiping by 1810. At that time the combined movement had a membership of approximately 20,000. This loose fellowship of churches was called by the names &quot;Christian Connection/Connexion&quot; or &quot;Christian Church.&quot;

===Characteristics===
The cornerstone for the Stone movement was Christian freedom. This ideal of freedom led them to reject all the historical creeds, traditions and theological systems that had developed over time and to focus instead on a primitive Christianity based on the Bible.

While restoring primitive Christianity was central to the Stone movement, they believed that restoring the lifestyle of members of the early church is essential. During the early years, they &quot;focused more... on holy and righteous living than on the forms and structures of the early church. The group also worked to restore the primitive church. Concerned that emphasizing particular practices could undermine Christian freedom, this effort tended to take the form of rejecting tradition rather than an explicit program of reconstructing New Testament practices. The emphasis on freedom was so strong that the movement avoided developing any ecclesiastical traditions; it was &quot;largely without dogma, form, or structure.&quot; What held &quot;the movement together was a commitment to primitive Christianity.&quot;

Another theme was that of hastening the millennium. Many Americans of the period believed that the millennium was near and based their hopes for the millennium on their new nation, the United States. Members of the Stone movement believed that only a unified Christianity based on the apostolic church, rather than a country or any of the existing denominations, could lead to the coming of the millennium. Stone&#x27;s millennialism has been described as more &quot;apocalyptic&quot; than that of Alexander Campbell, in that he believed people were too flawed to usher in a millennial age through human progress. Rather, he believed that it depended on the power of God, and that while waiting for God to establish His kingdom, one should live as if the rule of God were already fully established. For the Stone movement, this millennial emphasis had less to do with eschatological theories and more about a countercultural commitment to live as if the kingdom of God were already established on earth. This apocalyptic perspective or world view led many in the Stone movement to adopt pacifism, avoid participating in civil government, and reject violence, militarism, greed, materialism and slavery.

==Campbell movement==


=== Background ===
The Campbell wing of the movement was launched when Thomas Campbell published the &quot;Declaration and Address of the Christian Association of Washington&quot; in 1809. The Presbyterian Synod had suspended his ministerial credentials. In &quot;The Declaration and Address,&quot; he set forth some of his convictions about the church of Jesus Christ. He organized the Christian Association of Washington in Washington County, Pennsylvania on the western frontier of the state, not as a church but as an association of persons seeking to grow in faith. On May 4, 1811, the Christian Association reconstituted itself as a congregationally governed church. With the building it constructed at Brush Run, Pennsylvania, it became known as Brush Run Church. When their study of the New Testament led the reformers to begin to practice baptism by immersion, the nearby Redstone Baptist Association invited Brush Run Church to join with them for the purpose of fellowship. The reformers agreed, provided that they would be &quot;allowed to preach and to teach whatever they learned from the Scriptures.&quot;
Thomas&#x27; son Alexander came to the U.S. to join him in 1809. Before long, he assumed the leading role in the movement. The Campbells worked within the Redstone Baptist Association during the period 1815 through 1824. While both the Campbells and the Baptists shared practices of baptism by immersion and congregational polity, it quickly became clear the Campbells and their associates were not traditional Baptists. Within the Redstone Association, some of the Baptist leaders considered the differences intolerable when Alexander Campbell began publishing a journal, &quot;The Christian Baptist,&quot; which promoted reform. Campbell anticipated the conflict and moved his membership to a congregation of the Mahoning Baptist Association in 1824. In 1827, the Mahoning Association appointed Walter Scott as an evangelist. Through Scott&#x27;s efforts, the Mahoning Association grew rapidly. In 1828, Thomas Campbell visited several of the congregations formed by Scott and heard him preach. Campbell believed that Scott was bringing an important new dimension to the movement with his approach to evangelism.

Alexander used &quot;The Christian Baptist&quot; to address what he saw as the key issue of reconstructing the apostolic Christian community in a systematic and rational manner. He wanted to clearly distinguish between essential and non-essential aspects of primitive Christianity. Among what he identified as essential were &quot;congregational autonomy, a plurality of elders in each congregation, weekly communion and immersion for the remission of sins.&quot; Among practices he rejected as non-essential were &quot;the holy kiss, deaconesses, communal living, footwashing and charismatic exercises.&quot;
Several Baptist associations began disassociating congregations that refused to subscribe to the Philadelphia Confession. The Mahoning Association came under attack. In 1830, The Mahoning Baptist Association disbanded. The younger Campbell ceased publication of the &quot;Christian Baptist&quot;. In January 1831, he began publication of the &quot;Millennial Harbinger&quot;.

===Characteristics===
The Age of Enlightenment had a significant influence on the Campbell movement. Thomas Campbell was a student of the Enlightenment philosopher John Locke. While he did not explicitly use the term &quot;essentials&quot; in the &quot;Declaration and Address&quot;, Thomas proposed the same solution to religious division as had been advanced earlier by Locke and Edward Herbert: &quot;[R]educe religion to a set of essentials upon which all reasonable persons might agree.&quot; The essentials he identified were those practices for which the Bible provided: &quot;a &#x27;Thus saith the Lord,&#x27; either in express terms or by approved precedent.&quot; Unlike Locke, who considered the earlier efforts by Puritans to be inherently divisive, Thomas argued for &quot;a complete restoration of apostolic Christianity.&quot; Thomas believed that creeds served to divide Christians. He also believed that the Bible was clear enough that anyone could understand it and, thus, creeds were unnecessary.

Alexander Campbell was also deeply influenced by Enlightenment thinking, in particular the Scottish School of Common Sense of Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart. This group believed that the Bible related concrete facts rather than abstract truths, and advocated a scientific or &quot;Baconian&quot; approach to interpreting the Bible. It would begin with those facts, arrange the ones applicable to a given topic, and draw conclusions from them in a way that has been described as &quot;nothing less than the scientific method applied to the Bible.&quot; Alexander reflected this Baconian approach when he repeatedly argued that &quot;the Bible is a book of facts, not of opinions, theories, abstract generalities, nor of verbal definitions.&quot; Just as a reliance on facts provides the basis for agreement among scientists, Alexander believed that if Christians limited themselves to the facts found in the Bible they would necessarily come to agreement. He believed that those facts, approached in a rational and scientific manner, provided a blueprint or constitution for the church. Alexander was attracted to this scientific approach to the Bible because it offered a reliable basis for Christian unity.

Thomas Campbell combined the Enlightenment approach to unity with the Reformed and Puritan traditions of restoration. The Enlightenment affected the Campbell movement in two ways. First, it provided the idea that Christian unity could be achieved by finding a set of essentials that all reasonable people could agree on. Second, it also provided the concept of a rational faith that was formulated and defended based on facts derived from the Bible. Campbell&#x27;s solution to achieve Christian unity combined forsaking the creeds and traditions, which he believed had divided Christians, and recovering the primitive Christianity, found in scripture, that was common for all Christians.

Alexander Campbell&#x27;s millennialism was more optimistic than Stone&#x27;s. He had more confidence in the potential for human progress and believed that Christians could unite to transform the world and initiate a millennial age. Campbell&#x27;s conceptions were postmillennial, as he anticipated that the progress of the church and society would lead to an age of peace and righteousness before the return of Christ. This optimistic approach meant that, in addition to his commitment to primitivism, he had a progressive strand in his thinking.

==Merger of the Stone and Campbell movements==
The Campbell movement was characterized by a &quot;systematic and rational reconstruction&quot; of the early church, in contrast to the Stone movement which was characterized by radical freedom and lack of dogma. Despite their differences, the two movements agreed on several critical issues. Both saw restoring apostolic Christianity as a means of hastening the millennium. Both also saw restoring the early church as a route to Christian freedom. And both believed that unity among Christians could be achieved by using apostolic Christianity as a model. The commitment of both movements to restoring the early church and to uniting Christians was enough to motivate a union between many in the two movements.
The Stone and Campbell movements merged in 1832. This was formalized at the Hill Street Meeting House in Lexington, Kentucky, with a handshake between Stone and &quot;Raccoon&quot; John Smith. Smith had been chosen by attendees as spokesman for the followers of the Campbells. A preliminary meeting of the two groups had been held in late December 1831, culminating with the merger on January 1, 1832. Two representatives of the assembly were appointed to carry the news of the union to all the churches: John Rogers for the Christians and Smith for the reformers. Despite some challenges, the merger succeeded. Many believed the union held great promise for the future success of the combined movement and greeted the news enthusiastically.

When the two movements united, only a minority of Christians participated. Those who did were from congregations west of the Appalachian Mountains that had come into contact with the Stone movement. The eastern members had several key differences with the Stone and Campbell group: an emphasis on conversion experience, quarterly observance of communion, and nontrinitarianism. Those who did not unite with Campbell (the Christian Connection) merged with the Congregational Churches in 1931 to form the Congregational Christian Churches. In 1957, the Congregational Christian Church merged with the Evangelical and Reformed Church to become the United Church of Christ.

===Genealogical chart===













==United movement (1832–1906)==
The merger raised the question of what to call the new movement. Finding a biblical, non-sectarian name was important. Stone wanted to continue to use the name &quot;Christians,&quot; while Alexander Campbell insisted upon &quot;Disciples of Christ&quot;. Stone advocated using the name &quot;Christians&quot; based on its use in , while Campbell preferred the term &quot;disciples&quot; because he saw it as both a more humble and an older designation. As a result, both names were used, and the confusion over names has continued ever since.

After 1832, use of the term &quot;Reformation&quot; became frequent among leaders of the movement. The Campbells had designated themselves as &quot;Reformers,&quot; and other early leaders also saw themselves as reformers seeking Christian unity and restoring apostolic Christianity. The movement&#x27;s language at the time included phrases such as &quot;religious reformation,&quot; the &quot;present reformation,&quot; the &quot;current reformation&quot; and &quot;the cause of reformation.&quot; The term &quot;Restoration Movement&quot; became popular by the late 19th century. It appears to have been inspired by Alexander Campbell&#x27;s essays on &quot;A Restoration of the Ancient Order of Things&quot; in the &quot;Christian Baptist.&quot;

The combined movement grew rapidly over the period from 1832 to 1906. According to the 1906 U.S. Religious Census the combined membership of the movement made it the 6th largest Christian group in the country at that time.
===Journals===
From the beginning of the movement, the free exchange of ideas among the people was fostered by the journals published by its leaders. Alexander Campbell published &quot;The Christian Baptist&quot; and &quot;The Millennial Harbinger&quot;. Stone published &quot;The Christian Messenger&quot;. Both men routinely published the contributions of persons whose positions differed radically from their own. Following Campbell&#x27;s death in 1866, the journals were used to keep the discussions going. Between 1870 and 1900, two journals emerged as the most prominent. The &quot;Christian Standard&quot; was edited and published by Isaac Errett of Cincinnati. &quot;The Christian Evangelist&quot; was edited and published by JH Garrison from St. Louis. The two men enjoyed a friendly rivalry and kept the dialog going within the movement.

The &quot;Gospel Advocate&quot; was founded by the Nashville-area preacher Tolbert Fanning in 1855. Fanning&#x27;s student William Lipscomb served as co-editor until the American Civil War forced them to suspend publication in 1861. After the end of the Civil War, publication resumed in 1866 under the editorship of Fanning and Lipscomb&#x27;s younger brother David Lipscomb; Fanning soon retired, and David Lipscomb became the sole editor. While Lipscomb was the editor, the focus was on seeking unity by following scripture exactly, and the &quot;Advocate&quot;&#x27;s editorial position was to reject anything that is not explicitly allowed by scripture.

&quot;The Christian Oracle&quot; began publication in 1884. It was later known as &quot;The Christian Century&quot; and offered an interdenominational appeal. In 1914, Garrison&#x27;s Christian Publishing company was purchased by R.A. Long. He established a non-profit corporation, The Christian Board of Publication&quot; as the Brotherhood publishing house.

===Anabaptism and materialism controversies===

The Christadelphians, Church of the Blessed Hope, and Church of God (General Conference) also have roots in the restoration movement, but took their own direction about this time.

In 1832 Walter Scott baptised John Thomas, an English doctor who had emigrated to the United States. Thomas was a strong supporter of Alexander Campbell and the principles of the Disciples movement, and he quickly became a well-known leader and teacher. In 1834, however, Thomas took a contrary position to Campbell on the significance of baptism which led to a sharp conflict between the two men. While Campbell believed baptism by immersion to be very important, he recognised as Christians all who believed Jesus of Nazareth to be Messiah and Lord, and recognised any prior baptism. For this reason, members of Baptist churches who joined the Disciples movement were not required to be baptised again. Thomas, on the other hand, insisted that a baptism based on a different understanding of the gospel to that held in the Disciples movement was not a valid baptism, and he called for rebaptism in his periodical, the &quot;Apostolic Advocate&quot;. Campbell viewed this as sectarianism, which cut across the fundamental commitment of the Disciples movement to &quot;the union of all Christians,&quot; and rejected &quot;anabaptism.&quot; The two men became estranged.

Thomas began to refuse to share prayer, worship, or communion with those he considered not to be validly baptised Christians. His theological views also continued to develop. By 1837 he was teaching annihilationism, and he debated a Presbyterian clergymen, Isaac Watts. Campbell interpreted this as materialism and believed that it undermined the biblical doctrine of the resurrection, and he reacted strongly. In the &quot;Millennial Harbinger&quot; Campbell announced that he could no longer consider Thomas a brother. Many congregations of Disciples took this as an indication that they should withhold fellowship from Thomas, and he found himself on the margins of the movement. Thomas continued to have supporters among the Disciples but moved further from Christian orthodoxy. In 1846 he published a &quot;Confession and Abjuration&quot; of the faith he held at his baptism, and he arranged to be baptised again. Despite this, when he toured the United Kingdom to give prophetic lectures in 1848–1850 he played down his separation from the Disciples movement, in an endeavour to access congregations in Britain. But his true position was discovered by James Wallis and David King, and the movement closed ranks against him.

In 1864 he coined the name &quot;Christadelphian&quot; for those who shared his views and sought to register as conscientious objectors to military service. The name was adopted by Robert Roberts, the Scottish protege of Thomas, for the periodical which he had just begun to publish in Birmingham; and the sect began to grow rapidly.

Benjamin Wilson left the Disciples about the same time as Thomas, but split with Thomas in 1863 over disagreements about eschatology, forming the Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith. During the American Civil War his followers also sought to register as conscientious objectors. Some congregations were unable to register this name because of local regulations and chose an alternative name, Church of the Blessed Hope; but the two names referred to the same sect. The sect divided in 1921, and the Church of God (General Conference) was formed by the larger grouping.

===Missionary society controversy===
In 1849, the first national convention was held at Cincinnati, Ohio. Campbell had concerns that holding conventions would lead the movement into divisive denominationalism. He did not attend the gathering. Among its actions, the convention elected Campbell its president and created the American Christian Missionary Society (ACMS). By the end of the century, the Foreign Christian Missionary Society and the Christian Woman&#x27;s Board of Missions were also engaged in missionary activities. Forming the ACMS did not reflect a consensus of the entire movement, and these para-church organizations became a divisive issue. While there was no disagreement over the need for evangelism, many believed that missionary societies were not authorized by scripture and would compromise the autonomy of local congregations.

The ACMS was not as successful as proponents had hoped. It was opposed by those who believed any extra-congregational organizations were inappropriate; hostility grew when the ACMS took a stand in 1863 favoring the Union side during the Civil War. A convention held in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1869 adopted a plan intended to address &quot;a perceived need to reorganize the American Christian Missionary Society (ACMS) in a way that would be acceptable to more members of the Movement.&quot; The &quot;Louisville Plan,&quot; as it came to be known, attempted to build on existing local and regional conventions and to &quot;promote the harmonious cooperation of all the state and District Boards and Conventions.&quot; It established a General Christian Missionary Convention. Membership was congregational rather than individual. Local congregations elected delegates to district meetings, which in turn elected delegates to state meetings. States were given two delegates, plus an additional delegate for every 5,000 members. The plan proved divisive and faced immediate opposition. Opponents continued to argue that any organizational structure above the local congregational level was not authorized by scripture, and there was a general concern that the board had been given too much authority. By 1872 the Louisville Plan had effectively failed. Direct contributions from individuals were sought again in 1873, individual membership was reinstated in 1881, and the name was changed back to the American Christian Missionary Society in 1895.

===Use of musical instruments in worship===

The use of musical instruments in worship was discussed in journal articles as early as 1849, but initial reactions were generally unfavorable. Some congregations, however, are documented as having used musical instruments in the 1850s and 1860s. An example is the church in Midway, Kentucky, which was using an instrument by 1860. A member of the congregation, L. L. Pinkerton, brought a melodeon into the church building. The minister had been distressed to his &quot;breaking point&quot; by the poor quality of the congregation&#x27;s singing. At first, the instrument was used for singing practices held on Saturday nights but was then incorporated into worship on Sundays. One of the elders of that assembly removed the first melodeon, but it was soon replaced by another.

Both acceptance of instruments and discussion of the issue grew after the Civil War. Opponents argued that the New Testament provided no authorization for their use in worship, while supporters argued on the basis of expediency and Christian liberty. Affluent urban congregations were more likely to adopt musical instruments, while poorer and more rural congregations tended to see them as &quot;an accommodation to the ways of the world.&quot;

The &quot;Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement&quot; notes that Restoration Movement historians have tended to interpret the controversy over the use of musical instruments in worship in ways that &quot;reflect their own attitudes on the issue.&quot; Examples are given of historians from different branches of the movement interpreting it in relation to the statements of early Restoration Movement leaders, in terms of social and cultural factors, differing approaches to interpreting scripture, differing approaches to the authority of scripture, and &quot;ecumenical progressivism&quot; versus &quot;sectarian primitivism.&quot;

===Biblical interpretation===
The early 19th-century Restoration Movement encompassed very different views concerning the role of clergy: the Campbell branch was strongly anti-clergy, believing there was no justification for a clergy/lay distinction, while the Stone branch believed that only an ordained minister could officiate at communion.

Early leaders of the movement had a high view of scripture and believed that it was both inspired and infallible. Dissenting views developed during the 19th century. As early as 1849, Pinkerton denied the inerrancy of the Bible. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement&quot; Pinkerton is &quot;sometimes labeled the first &#x27;liberal&#x27; of the Stone-Campbell Movement.&quot; In addition to rejecting the plenary inspiration of the Bible and supporting the use of instruments in worship, Pinkerton also supported &quot;open membership&quot; (recognizing as members individuals who have not been baptized by immersion) and was a strong supporter of the temperance and abolition movements. As the 19th century progressed, the denial of the inerrancy of the Bible slowly spread. In 1883 the editor of the &quot;Christian Standard&quot;, Isaac Errett, said &quot;Admitting the fact of inspiration, have we in the inspired Scriptures an &quot;infallible&quot; guide?... I do not see how we can answer this question affirmatively.&quot; Others, including JW McGarvey, fiercely opposed these liberal views.

==Separation of the Churches of Christ and Christian Churches==
===Factors leading to the separation===
Disagreement over centralized organizations above the local congregational level, such as missionary societies and conventions, was one important factor leading to the separation of the Churches of Christ from the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). After the Civil War more congregations began using instruments, which led to growing controversy. The greatest acceptance was among urban congregations in the Northern states; very few congregations in the Southern United States used instruments in worship. While music and the approach to missionary work were the most visible issues, there were also some deeper ones, such as basic differences in the underlying approach to Biblical interpretation. For the Churches of Christ, any practices not present in accounts of New Testament worship were not permissible in the church, and they could find no New Testament documentation of the use of instrumental music in worship. For the Christian Churches, any practices not expressly forbidden could be considered. The Civil War exacerbated the cultural tensions between the two groups.

As the 19th century progressed, a division gradually developed between those whose primary commitment was to unity and those whose primary commitment was to the restoration of the primitive church. Those whose primary focus was unity gradually took on &quot;an explicitly ecumenical agenda&quot; and &quot;sloughed off the restorationist vision.&quot; This group increasingly used the terms &quot;Disciples of Christ&quot; and &quot;Christian Churches&quot; rather than &quot;Churches of Christ.&quot; At the same time, those whose primary focus was restoration of the primitive church increasingly used the term &quot;Churches of Christ&quot; rather than &quot;Disciples of Christ.&quot; Reports on the changes and increasing separation among the groups were published as early as 1883.

The rise of women leaders in the temperance and missionary movements, primarily in the North, also contributed to the separation of the unaffiliated Christian Church/Church of Christ congregations. In the Christian Churches, many women spoke in public on behalf of the Christian Woman&#x27;s Board of Missions and Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union. In contrast, the Churches of Christ largely discouraged women from joining activist women&#x27;s organizations and speaking in public about any issue. In 1889 the Erie, Illinois, Christian Church confirmed the leadership role of women by ordaining Clara Babcock as the first known woman Disciple preacher.

===Formal recognition in 1906===
The United States Census Bureau began a religious census in 1906. Special Agents were used to collect information on those groups which had little or no formal organizational structure, such as the churches associated with the Restoration Movement. Officials working on the census noticed signs that the movement was no longer unified: the &quot;Gospel Advocate&quot; appeared at times to distance itself from the Disciples of Christ, and the Bureau had received at least one letter claiming that some &quot;churches of Christ&quot; were no longer affiliated with the &quot;Disciples of Christ.&quot;

To resolve the question, Census Director Simon Newton Dexter North wrote a letter to David Lipscomb, the editor of the &quot;Advocate&quot;. He asked:

Lipscomb summarized the early history of the movement, described the &quot;general organization of the churches under a missionary society with a moneyed membership&quot; and the &quot;adoption of instrumental music in the worship&quot; as &quot;a subversion of the fundamental principles on which the churches were based,&quot; and then continued:

The 1906 U.S. Religious Census for the first time listed the &quot;Churches of Christ&quot; and the &quot;Disciples of Christ&quot; as separate and distinct groups.This, however, was simply the recognition of a division that had been growing for years, with published reports as early as 1883. The process that led to this separation had begun prior to the Civil War.

For Lipscomb, an underlying theological concern was the adoption of German liberal theology by many among the Disciples wing of the Restoration Movement. He saw them as taking a direction very different from the principles enunciated by Thomas and Alexander Campbell. Lipscomb&#x27;s response to the Census Bureau, and its official listing of the two groups in 1906, became another source of friction between the groups. James Harvey Garrison, editor of &quot;The Christian-Evangelist,&quot; accused Lipscomb of &quot;sectarianism.&quot; Lipscomb said that he had &quot;done nothing to bring about the present condition of affairs,&quot; the Census Bureau had started the discussion, and he had simply answered the question they brought to him.

Movement historian Douglas Foster has summarized the events this way:

===Aftermath===
When the 1906 U.S. Religious Census was published in 1910 it reported combined totals for the &quot;Disciples or Christians&quot; for comparison to the 1890 statistics on the movement, as well as separate statistics for the &quot;Disciples of Christ&quot; and the &quot;Churches of Christ.&quot; The Disciples were by far the larger of the two groups at the time.

Generally speaking, the Disciples of Christ congregations tended to be predominantly urban and Northern, while the Churches of Christ were predominantly rural and Southern. The Disciples favored college-educated clergy, while the Churches of Christ discouraged formal theological education because they opposed the creation of a professional clergy. Disciples congregations tended to be wealthier and constructed larger, more expensive church buildings. Churches of Christ congregations built more modest structures and criticized the wearing of expensive clothing at worship. One commentator has described the Disciples &quot;ideal&quot; as reflecting the &quot;businessman,&quot; and the Church of Christ &quot;ideal&quot; as reflecting &quot;the simple and austere yeoman farmer.&quot;

Churches of Christ have maintained an ongoing commitment to purely congregational structure, rather than a denominational one, and have no central headquarters, councils, or other organizational structure above the local church level.

After the separation from the Churches of Christ, tensions remained among the Disciples of Christ over theological liberalism, the nascent ecumenical movement and &quot;open membership.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Christian Churches/Churches of Christ&quot;&gt;Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L. Dunnavant, &quot;The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ&quot;, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, , , 854 pages, entry on &quot;Christian Churches/Churches of Christ&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; While the process was lengthy, the more conservative unaffiliated Christian Church/Church of Christ congregations eventually emerged as a separately identifiable religious body from the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Some commentators believe divisions in the movement have resulted from the tension between the goals of restoration and ecumenism, and see the Churches of Christ and unaffiliated Christian Church/Church of Christ congregations resolving the tension by stressing restoration while the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) resolve the tension by stressing ecumenism.

All of the three major U.S. branches of the movement share the following characteristics:
* A high view, compared to other Christian traditions, of the office of the elder; and
* A &quot;commitment to the priesthood of all believers&quot;.

The term &quot;restoration movement&quot; has remained popular among the Churches of Christ and the unaffiliated Christian Church/Church of Christ congregations. Because of the emphasis it places on the theme of restoration, it has been a less comfortable fit for those whose primary focus has been on the theme of unity. Historically, the term &quot;Disciples of Christ&quot; has also been used by some as a collective designation for the movement. It has evolved, however, into a designation for a particular branch of the movement—the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)—as a result of the divisions of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The movement as a whole grew significantly over the course of the 20th century, and the relative size of the different groups associated with the movement shifted as well.

==Subsequent development of the Christian Churches (Disciples of Christ)==

Following the 1906 separation of the Churches of Christ, controversy still existed within the movement over whether the missionary efforts should be cooperative or independently sponsored by congregations. Questions on the role of the methods of biblical criticism to the study and interpretation of the Bible were also among the issues in conflict. An awareness of historical criticism began developing in the 1880s, and by the 1920s many Disciples accepted the work of the higher critics. By that time the question of &quot;open membership,&quot; or &quot;admission of the pious unimmersed to membership&quot; had arisen as an additional source of tension. During the first half of the 20th century the opposing factions among the Christian Churches coexisted but with discomfort. The three missionary societies were merged into the United Christian Missionary Society in 1920. Human service ministries grew through the National Benevolent Association providing assistance to orphans, the elderly and the disabled. By mid century, the cooperative Christian Churches and the independent Christian Churches were following different paths.

By 1926 a split began to form within the Disciples over the future direction of the church. Conservatives within the group began to have problems with the perceived liberalism of the leadership, upon the same grounds described earlier in the accepting of instrumental music in worship. In 1927 they held the first North American Christian Convention, and the unaffiliated Christian Church/Church of Christ congregations began to emerge as a distinct group from the Disciples, although the break was not formalized until the late 1960s. By this time the decennial religious census was a thing of the past and could not be used as a delineation as it was in 1906.

Following World War II, it was believed that the organizations that had been developed in previous decades no longer effectively met the needs of the postwar era. After several discussions throughout the 1950s, the 1960 International Convention of Christian Churches adopted a process to plan the &quot;restructure&quot; of the entire organization. The Commission on Restructure, chaired by Granville T. Walker, held its first meeting October 30 and November 1, 1962. In 1968, at the International Convention of Christian Churches (Disciples of Christ), those Christian Churches that favored cooperative mission work adopted a new &quot;provisional design&quot; for their work together, becoming the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Those congregations that chose not to be associated with the new denominational organization went their own way as the unaffiliated Christian Church/Church of Christ congregations, completing a separation that had begun decades before.

The Disciples of Christ still have their own internal conservative-liberal tension. In 1985, a movement of conservative congregations and individuals among the Disciples formed the &quot;Disciple Renewal.&quot; They thought that others in the Disciples fellowship had increasingly liberal views on issues such as the lordship of Christ, the authority of the Bible, and tolerance of homosexuality. In 1985 the Disciples General Assembly rejected a resolution on the inspiration of scripture; afterward, the Disciple Renewal planned to encourage renewal from within the fellowship through founding a journal entitled &quot;Disciple Renewal&quot;. Conservative members were concerned that the Disciples had abandoned the fundamental principles of the Restoration Movement.

In 1995 the Disciple Heritage Fellowship was established. It is a fellowship of autonomous congregations, about half of which are formally associated with the Disciples of Christ. the Disciples Heritage Fellowship included 60 congregations and 100 &quot;supporting&quot; churches. The Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) has experienced a significant loss of membership since the middle of the 20th century. Membership peaked in 1958 at just under 2 million. In 1993, membership dropped below 1 million. In 2009, the denomination reported 658,869 members in 3,691 congregations. As of 2010, the five states with the highest adherence rates were Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Kentucky and Oklahoma. The states with the largest absolute number of adherents were Missouri, Texas, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio.

==Subsequent development of the unaffiliated congregations==
Independent Christian churches and churches of Christ have both organizational and hermeneutic differences with the Churches of Christ. For example, they have a loosely organized convention, and they view scriptural silence on an issue more permissively. Nonetheless, they are much more closely related to the Churches of Christ in their theology and ecclesiology than they are with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).

The development of the unaffiliated Christian Church/Church of Christ congregations as a separately identifiable religious body from the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) was a lengthy process. The roots of the separation can be found in the polarization resulting from three major controversies that arose during the early 20th century. One, which was a source of division in other religious groups, was &quot;the theological development of modernism and liberalism.&quot; The early stages of the ecumenical movement, which led in 1908 to the Federal Council of Churches, provide a second source of controversy. The third was the practice of open membership, in which individuals who had not been baptized by immersion were granted full membership in the church. Those who supported one of these points of view tended to support the others as well.

The Disciples of Christ were, in 1910, a united, growing community with common goals. Support by the United Christian Missionary Society of missionaries who advocated open membership became a source of contention in 1920. Efforts to recall support for these missionaries failed in a 1925 convention in Oklahoma City and a 1926 convention in Memphis, Tennessee. Many congregations withdrew from the missionary society as a result.

The North American Christian Convention was organized by the more conservative congregations in 1927. The &quot;Christian Standard&quot; served as a source of cohesion for these congregations. From the 1960s on, newer unaffiliated missionary organizations like the Christian Missionary Fellowship (today, Christian Missionary Fellowship International) were working more on a national scale in the United States to rally Christian Church/Church of Christ congregations in international missions. By this time the division between liberals and conservatives was well established.

The official separation between the independent Christian churches and Churches of Christ and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) is difficult to date. Suggestions range from 1926 to 1971 based on the events outlined below:
* 1926: The first North American Christian Convention in 1927 was the result of disillusionment at the Memphis convention.
* 1944: International Convention of Disciples elects as president a proponent of open membership
* 1948: The Commission on Restudy, appointed to help avoid a split, disbands
* 1955: The Directory of the Ministry was first published listing only the &quot;Independents&quot; on a voluntary basis.
* 1968: Final redaction of the Disciples Year Book removing Independent churches
* 1971: Independent churches listed separately in the Yearbook of American Churches.

Because of this separation, many independent Christian churches and Churches of Christ are not only non-denominational, they can be anti-denominational, avoiding even the appearance or language associated with denominationalism holding true to their Restoration roots.

==Subsequent development of the Churches of Christ==

One of the issues leading to the 1906 separation was the question of organizational structures above the level of the local congregation. Since then, Churches of Christ have maintained an ongoing commitment to church governance that is congregational only, rather than denominational. Churches of Christ purposefully have no central headquarters, councils, or other organizational structure above the local church level. Rather, the independent congregations are a network with each congregation participating at its own discretion in various means of service and fellowship with other congregations (see Sponsoring church (Churches of Christ)). Churches of Christ are linked by their shared commitment to restoration principles.

Since Churches of Christ are autonomous and purposefully do not maintain an ecclesiastical hierarchy or doctrinal council, it is not unusual to find variations from congregation to congregation. There are many notable consistencies, however; for example, very few Church of Christ buildings display a cross, a practice common in other Christian churches. The approach taken to restoring the New Testament church has focused on &quot;methods and procedures&quot; such as church organization, the form of worship, and how the church should function. As a result, most divisions among Churches of Christ have been the result of &quot;methodological&quot; disputes. These are meaningful to members of this movement because of the seriousness with which they take the goal of &quot;restoring the form and structure of the primitive church.&quot;

Three quarters of the congregations and 87% of the membership are described by &quot;The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement&quot; as &quot;mainstream,&quot; sharing a consensus on practice and theology. The remaining congregations may be grouped into four categories which generally differ from the mainstream consensus in specific practices, rather than in theological perspectives, and tend to have smaller congregations on average. The largest of these four categories is the &quot;non-institutional&quot; Churches of Christ. This group is notable for opposing congregational support of institutions such as orphans homes and Bible colleges. Approximately 2,055 congregations fall in this category. The remaining three groups, whose congregations are generally considerably smaller than those of the mainstream or &quot;non-institutional&quot; groups, also oppose institutional support but differ from the &quot;non-institutional&quot; group by other beliefs and practices:

*One group opposes separate &quot;Sunday school&quot; classes; this group consists of approximately 1,100 congregations.
*Another group opposes the use of multiple communion cups (the term &quot;one-cupper&quot; is often used, sometimes pejoratively, to describe this group); there approximately 550 congregations in this group, and this group overlaps somewhat with those congregations that oppose separate Sunday school classes.
*The smallest group &quot;emphasize[s] mutual edification by various leaders in the churches and oppose[s] one person doing most of the preaching.&quot; This group includes roughly 130 congregations.

While there are no official membership statistics for the Churches of Christ, growth appears to have been relatively steady through the 20th century. One source estimates total U.S. membership at 433,714 in 1926; 558,000 in 1936; 682,000 in 1946; 835,000 in 1965; and 1,250,000 in 1994.

===Separation of the International Churches of Christ===
The International Churches of Christ (ICOC) had their roots in a &quot;discipling&quot; movement that arose among the mainline Churches of Christ during the 1970s. This discipling movement developed in the campus ministry of Chuck Lucas. In 1967, Chuck Lucas was minister of the 14th Street Church of Christ in Gainesville, Florida (later renamed the Crossroads Church of Christ). That year he started a new project known as Campus Advance (based on principles borrowed from the Campus Crusade and the Shepherding movement). Centered on the University of Florida, the program called for a strong evangelistic outreach and an intimate religious atmosphere in the form of &quot;soul talks&quot; and &quot;prayer partners. Soul talks&quot; were held in student residences and involved prayer and sharing overseen by a leader who delegated authority over group members. &quot;Prayer partners &quot;refers to the practice of pairing a new Christian with an older guide for personal assistance and direction. Both procedures led to &quot;in-depth involvement of each member in one another&#x27;s lives,&quot; and critics accused Lucas of fostering cultism.

The Crossroads movement later spread into some other Churches of Christ congregations. One of Lucas&#x27; converts, Kip McKean, moved to the Boston area in 1979 and began working with the Lexington Church of Christ. He asked the congregation to &quot;redefine their commitment to Christ,&quot; and introduced the use of discipling partners. The congregation grew rapidly and was renamed Boston Church of Christ. In the early 1980s, the focus of the movement moved to Boston where McKean and the Boston Church of Christ became prominently associated with the trend. With the national leadership located in Boston, during the 1980s it commonly became known as the &quot;Boston movement.&quot;

In 1990 the Crossroads Church of Christ broke with the Boston movement and, through a letter written to &quot;The Christian Chronicle&quot;, attempted to restore relations with the mainline Churches of Christ. By the early 1990s some first-generation leaders had become disillusioned by the movement and left. The movement was first recognized as an independent religious group in 1992 when John Vaughn, a church growth specialist at Fuller Theological Seminary, listed them as a separate entity. &quot;Time&quot; magazine ran a full-page story on the movement in 1992 calling them &quot;one of the world&#x27;s fastest-growing and most innovative bands of Bible thumpers&quot; that had grown into &quot;a global empire of 103 congregations from California to Cairo with total Sunday attendance of 50,000&quot;.

A formal break was made from the mainline Churches of Christ in 1993 when the movement organized under the name &quot;International Churches of Christ.&quot; This designation formalized a division that was already in existence between those involved with the Crossroads/Boston movement and &quot;mainline&quot; Churches of Christ. Other names that have been used for this movement include the &quot;Multiplying Ministries&quot; and the &quot;Discipling Movement&quot;.

==Reunion efforts==
Efforts have been made to restore unity among the various branches of the Restoration Movement. In 1984 a &quot;Restoration Summit&quot; was held at the Ozark Christian College, with 50 representatives of both the Churches of Christ and the unaffiliated Christian Church/Church of Christ congregations. Later meetings were open to all and were known as &quot;Restoration Forums.&quot; Beginning in 1986 they have been held annually, generally in October or November, with the hosting venue alternating between the Churches of Christ and the Christian churches and churches of Christ. Topics discussed have included issues such as instrumental music, the nature of the church, and practical steps for promoting unity.

Efforts were made in the early 21st century to include representatives of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). These efforts followed the &quot;Stone-Campbell Dialogue,&quot; which was a series of meetings beginning in 1999 that included representatives of all three major U.S. branches of the Restoration Movement. The first full meeting in 1999 included six representatives from each of the three traditions. Meetings were held twice annually, and in 2001 were expanded to include anyone associated with the Restoration Movement who was interested in attending. Also, special efforts were made in 2006 to create more intentional fellowship between the various branches of the Movement. This was in conjunction with the centennial anniversary of the &quot;official&quot; recognition of the split between the Christian Church and the Churches of Christ by the U.S. Census in 1906. One example of this was the hosting by Abilene Christian University (ACU) of the annual Restoration Unity Forum for 2006 as part of the university&#x27;s annual Bible lectureship. During the program Don Jeanes, president of Milligan College and Royce Money, president of ACU, jointly gave a presentation on the first chapter of the Gospel of John. The 2004 ACU Lectureship included a forum with leaders from the Churches of Christ and the ICOC that included apologies from both groups.

==Timeline==
==Churches outside North America==
Restoration Movement churches are found around the world, and the World Convention of Churches of Christ provides many national profiles. Their genealogies are representative of developments in North America. Their theological orientation ranges from fundamentalist to liberal to ecumenical. In some places they have joined with churches of other traditions to form united churches at local, regional or national level.

A group in Nottingham withdrew from the Scotch Baptist church in 1836 to form a Church of Christ. James Wallis, a member of that group, founded a magazine named &quot;The British Millennial Harbinger&quot; in 1837. In 1842 the first Cooperative Meeting of Churches of Christ in Great Britain was held in Edinburgh. Approximately 50 congregations were involved, representing a membership of 1,600. The name &quot;Churches of Christ&quot; was formally adopted at an annual meeting in 1870. Alexander Campbell influenced the British Restoration Movement indirectly through his writings; he visited the Britain for several months in 1847, and &quot;presided at the Second Cooperative Meeting of the British Churches at Chester.&quot; At that time the movement had grown to encompass 80 congregations with a total membership of 2,300. Annual meetings were held after 1847. The use of instrumental music in worship was not a source of division among the Churches of Christ in Great Britain before World War I. More significant was the issue of pacifism; a national conference was established in 1916 for congregations that opposed the war. A conference for &quot;Old Paths&quot; congregations was first held in 1924. The issues involved included concern that the Christian Association was compromising traditional principles in seeking ecumenical ties with other organizations and a sense that it had abandoned Scripture as &quot;an all-sufficient rule of faith and practice.&quot; Two &quot;Old Paths&quot; congregations withdrew from the association in 1931; an additional two withdrew in 1934, and 19 more withdrew between 1943 and 1947. Membership declined rapidly during and after the First World War. The Association of Churches of Christ in Britain disbanded in 1980. Most association congregations (approximately 40) united with the United Reformed Church in 1981. In the same year, 24 other congregations formed a Fellowship of Churches of Christ. The fellowship developed ties with the unaffiliated Christian Church/Church of Christ congregations during the 1980s.

Historically, Restoration Movement groups from Great Britain were more influential than those from the United States in the early development of the movement in Australia. Churches of Christ grew up independently in several locations. While early Churches of Christ in Australia saw creeds as divisive, towards the end of the 19th century they began viewing &quot;summary statements of belief&quot; as useful in tutoring second generation members and converts from other religious groups. The period from 1875 through 1910 also saw debates over the use of musical instruments in worship, Christian Endeavor Societies and Sunday schools. Ultimately, all three found general acceptance in the movement. Currently, the Restoration Movement is not as divided in Australia as it is in the United States. There have been strong ties with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), but many conservative ministers and congregations associate with the unaffiliated Christian Church/Church of Christ congregations instead. Others have sought support from non-instrumental Churches of Christ, particularly those who felt that &quot;conference&quot; congregations had &quot;departed from the restoration ideal.&quot; The Fellowship of Churches of Christ and some Australian and New Zealand Churches advocate a &quot;missional&quot; emphasis with an ideal of &quot;five fold leadership.&quot; Many people in more traditional Churches of Christ see these groups as having more in common with Pentecostal churches. The main publishing organs of traditional Churches of Christ in Britain are &quot;The Christian Worker&quot; magazine and the &quot;Scripture Standard&quot; magazine.

There are believed to be more than 1 million members of the Churches of Christ in Africa. The total number of congregations is approximately 14,000. The most significant concentrations are in &quot;Nigeria, Malawi, Ghana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, South Africa and Kenya&quot;.

India has historically been a target for missionary efforts; estimates are that there are 2,000 or more Restoration Movement congregations in India, with a membership of approximately 1,000,000. More than 100 congregations exist in the Philippines. Growth in other Asian countries has been smaller but is still significant.

<text>The Hogarth Press is a book publishing imprint of Penguin Random House that was founded as an independent company in 1917 by British authors Leonard Woolf and Virginia Woolf. It was named after their house in Richmond (then in Surrey and now in London), in which they began hand-printing books as a hobby during the interwar period.

Hogarth originally published the works of many members of the Bloomsbury Group, and was at the forefront of publishing works on psychoanalysis and translations of foreign, especially Russian, works.

In 1938, Virginia Woolf relinquished her interest in the business and it was then run as a partnership by Leonard Woolf and John Lehmann until 1946, when it became an associate company of Chatto &amp; Windus. In 2011, Hogarth Press was relaunched as an imprint for contemporary fiction in a partnership between Chatto &amp; Windus in the United Kingdom and Crown Publishing Group in the United States, which had both been acquired by Random House.

==History==
Printing began as a hobby for the Woolfs, and it provided a diversion for Virginia when writing became too stressful. The couple bought a handpress in 1917 for £19 (equivalent to about £1295 in 2018) and taught themselves how to use it. The press was set up in the dining room of Hogarth House, where the Woolfs lived, lending its name to the publishing company they founded. In July they published their first text, a book with one story written by Leonard and the other written by Virginia.

From these origins as a &#x27;little press&#x27;, by the late 1920s the Hogarth Press had become a larger operation, using commercial printers and distributing to an international readership, with some of its bestsellers printed in the tens of thousands. 

Between 1917 and 1946 the Press published 527 titles. It moved to Tavistock Square in 1924.


== Series ==

The Hogarth Press produced a number of publication series that were affordable as well as being attractively bound and printed, and usually commissioned from well known authors. These include the initial &quot;Hogarth Essays&quot; in three series 1924–1947 (36 titles), 
&quot;Hogarth Lectures on Literature&quot; (2 series 1927–1951), &quot;Merttens Lectures on War and Peace&quot; (8 titles 1927–1936), &quot;Hogarth Living Poets&quot; (29 titles 1928–1937), &quot;Day to Day Pamphlets&quot; (1930–1939), &quot;Hogarth Letters&quot; (12 titles 1931–1933) and &quot;World-Makers and World-Shakers&quot; (4 titles 1937).

The &quot;Essays&quot; were the first series produced by the press and include works by Virginia Woolf, Leonard Woolf and Gertrude Stein. Virginia Woolf&#x27;s defence of modernism, &quot;Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown&quot; (1924) was the initial publication in the series. Cover illustrations were by Woolf’s sister Vanessa Bell. Bell also designed book jackets for all of Woolf’s books that were published by Hogarth Press.

The &quot;Letters&quot; are less well known, and are epistolary in form. Authors include E.M. Forster and Virginia Woolf. Woolf&#x27;s &quot;A Letter to a Young Poet&quot; (1932), was number 8, and addressed to John Lehmann as an exposition on modern poetry. Cover illustrations were by John Banting. In 1933, the entire series was reissued as a single volume, and are available on the Internet Archive in a 1986 edition.

<text>Professor Phineas Potter is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, primarily in association with Superman.

==Publication history==
Phineas Potter first appeared in &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal, Jimmy Olsen&quot; #22 (August 1957) and was created by Otto Binder and Curt Swan.

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis===
The original incarnation of Professor Potter is the uncle of Lana Lang and first encounters the Man of Steel during his teenage years as Superboy. A professor and eccentric scientist, Potter often invents odd or fantastical devices for the betterment of humanity. However, he rarely considers the potential downsides of his inventions. While several of his devices are harmless, many others are not and cause chaos when activated.

Potter befriends three newspaper reporters from the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;: Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and Clark Kent. Olsen is often the victim of Potter&#x27;s inventions, being transformed into a variety of bizarre forms. Potter later creates a serum that gives Olsen elasticity, enabling him to become the superhero Elastic Lad and an honorary member of the Legion of Super-Heroes.

===Post-Crisis===
Following &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, which reboots DC&#x27;s continuity, Clark Kent&#x27;s history is revised so that he does not become a superhero until adulthood, and thus never operates as Superboy. Potter appears as a S.T.A.R. Labs scientist uninvolved with Superman.

McGillis was born on July 9, 1957, in the Southern California suburb of Newport Beach, the eldest of three daughters born to Virginia Joan (née Snell), a homemaker, and Donald Manson McGillis, a physician. Her direct paternal descent is Scots-Irish, including German and Welsh ancestry. She attended Newport Harbor High School.

McGillis attended the Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts at Allan Hancock College in Santa Maria, California. After dropping out of high school in 1975, she obtained her GED and then moved to New York City to study acting at the Juilliard School, where she graduated in 1983, Group 12.

== Career ==
=== Film ===
After making her film debut in &quot;Reuben, Reuben&quot; in 1983, McGillis&#x27;s breakout role was that of an Amish mother in &quot;Witness&quot; (1985) for which she received Golden Globe and BAFTA award nominations.

&quot;The Centurion&quot;, a 110-foot schooner valued at $1.5 million owned by McGillis and her then-husband, Fred Tillman, was destroyed by fire in April 1996 at a marina in Dania, Florida. The fire started on an adjacent boat at the Port LauDania marina on a Dania Cutoff Canal and spread to the schooner. Tillman had brought the boat from the couple&#x27;s home in Key West in hopes of selling it at the Fort Lauderdale Boat Show.

McGillis came out as a lesbian in 2009 during an interview with &quot;SheWired&quot;. In 2010, she entered into a civil union with Melanie Leis, a Philadelphia sales executive. They had met in 2000 when Leis was a bartender at the Caribbean Bar Grill &amp; Brewery in Key West, Florida, which McGillis owned with her then-husband.

McGillis currently lives in Hendersonville, North Carolina. As of 2013, she has taught acting at the New York Studio for Stage and Screen (NYS3) in Asheville, North Carolina.

===2016 home invasion===
McGillis was left scratched and bruised after she was assaulted by a woman who broke into her home on June 17, 2016. She said the attack, as well as others which she has been a victim of in the past, led her to apply for a concealed carry permit to protect herself. Following the incident, a 38-year-old woman, Laurence Marie Dorn, was charged with second-degree burglary, misdemeanor larceny, misdemeanor stalking, assault and battery, and interfering with emergency communication. Later, Dorn was convicted of misdemeanor breaking and entering and sentenced to probation.

<doc id="294927" wikidata="Q65122090" url="?curid=294927" title="Cross-correlation matrix">
<text>The cross-correlation matrix of two random vectors is a matrix containing as elements the cross-correlations of all pairs of elements of the random vectors. The cross-correlation matrix is used in various digital signal processing algorithms.

==Definition==
For two random vectors formula_1 and formula_2, each containing random elements whose expected value and variance exist, the cross-correlation matrix of formula_3 and formula_4 is defined by

 \triangleq\ \operatorname{E}[\mathbf{X} \mathbf{Y}^{\rm T}]&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

and has dimensions formula_5. Written component-wise:

:formula_6

The random vectors formula_3 and formula_4 need not have the same dimension, and either might be a scalar value.

==Example==
For example, if formula_9 and formula_10 are random vectors, then
formula_11 is a formula_12 matrix whose formula_13-th entry is formula_14.

==Complex random vectors==
If formula_15 and formula_16 are complex random vectors, each containing random variables whose expected value and variance exist, the cross-correlation matrix of formula_17 and formula_18 is defined by

:formula_19

where formula_20 denotes Hermitian transposition.

==Uncorrelatedness==
Two random vectors formula_21 and formula_22 are called uncorrelated if
:formula_23

They are uncorrelated if and only if their cross-covariance matrix formula_24 matrix is zero.

In the case of two complex random vectors formula_17 and formula_18 they are called uncorrelated if
:formula_27
and
:formula_28

==Properties==
===Relation to the cross-covariance matrix===
The cross-correlation is related to the &quot;cross-covariance matrix&quot; as follows:
:formula_29
: Respectively for complex random vectors:
:formula_30

<doc id="294930" wikidata="Q1554290" url="?curid=294930" title="Gulfport–Biloxi International Airport">
<text>Gulfport–Biloxi International Airport is a joint civil–military public-use airport three nautical miles (6 km) northeast of the central business district of Gulfport, a city in Harrison County, Mississippi, United States. It is owned by the Gulfport–Biloxi Regional Airport Authority and serves the Gulf Coast area.

This airport is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport (more than 10,000 enplanements per year). As per Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 487,907 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008; 411,978 enplanements in 2009; and 325,437 emplacements in 2014. Despite its title, all regularly scheduled commercial passenger flights at the airport are domestic flights only. US Customs is available 24/7 if scheduled. US Customs has a fully functioning customs office to process passengers at Million Air Aviation. The GPT airport has private international and military charter international traffic throughout the year.

==History==
The airport was originally built in 1942 by the United States Army Air Forces as a training base for Air Corps Flying Training Command. Gulfport Army Airfield opened on July 7, and the Eastern Technical Training Command conducted technical training and basic training unit transferred to Third Air Force on March 31, 1944 with joint use by Technical Training Command for marine training of Emergency Rescue School (3d Air Rescue Group) at Keesler Army Airfield. With the end of the war and the drawdown of the military, Gulfport AAF was placed into reserve status on January 31, 1946.

Gulfport Field was declared excess by the Air Force and conveyed by the War Assets Administration to the City of Gulfport in 1949 for use as a civil airport. The city negotiated airline service contracts with Southern Airways and later National Airlines to provide passenger and cargo service beginning in the early 1950s.

Due to the large expansion of the United States Air Force as a result of the Cold War, a new lease was obtained for military use of the airport, and Gulfport Air Force Base was opened as a joint-use civil–military facility. Gulfport AFB was closed as an active Air Force installation and its military facilities were transferred to the Mississippi Air National Guard, with the airport remaining a joint-use airport and Air National Guard base. Although no military aircraft are permanently assigned, the base serves as the home of the Gulfport Combat Readiness Training Center.

Through the late 1970s, Southern Airways continued as the primary airline, followed by successors Republic Airlines and Northwest Airlines into the 1990s.

==Facilities and aircraft==
Gulfport–Biloxi International Airport covers an area of 1,400 acres (567 ha) at an elevation of 28 feet (9 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways: 14/32 is 9,002 by 150 feet (2,744 x 46 m) with an asphalt and concrete surface; 18/36 is 4,935 by 150 feet (1,504 x 46 m) with an asphalt surface.

For the 12-month period ending January 31, 2018, the airport had 48,868 aircraft operations, an average of 134 per day: 52% military, 26% general aviation, 8% air taxi, and 14% scheduled commercial. As in 4Q of 2023, there were 41 aircraft based at this airport: 32 single-engine, 4 jet, 2 multi-engine, 3 helicopter, .

===Cargo facility===
A cargo facility is at Gulfport–Biloxi International Airport. It includes of chiller space; of cargo sorting and distribution space; and of office space.
Airside access from the runway system has been designed with safety and efficiency in mind. The ramp can facilitate two MD11s, DC10s or B747s. The area is also expandable with reserved for air cargo on airport property.

==Airlines and destinations==


==Statistics==


==Hurricane Katrina==

The airport was closed for repairs following severe damage by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005. On August 30, 2005, the airfield reopened to first responder flights, and on September 8 it reopened for commercial flights. The airport underwent an extensive renovation that was completed in 2007.

<text>The World Junior Chess Championship is an under-20 chess tournament (players must have been under 20 years old on 1 January in the year of competition) organized by the World Chess Federation (FIDE).

The idea was the brainchild of William Ritson-Morry, who organized the 1951 inaugural event to take place in Birmingham, England. Subsequently, it was held every two years until 1973, when an annual schedule was adopted. In 1983, a separate tournament for girls was established.

The first championship was an 11-round Swiss system tournament. In subsequent championships, the entrants were divided into sections, and preliminary sectional tournaments were used to establish graded finals sections (Final A, Final B, etc.). Since 1975 the tournaments have returned to the Swiss format.

Originally the winner of the open tournament was awarded the title International Master if he had not already received it. Currently the winner receives the Grandmaster title, and the second and third-place finishers receive the International Master titles .
The winner of the girls&#x27; tournament receives the Woman Grandmaster title, and the second and third-place finishers receive the Woman International Master titles . In the Open section, two winners - Zaven Andriasian (2006) and Abdulla Gadimbayli (2022) have earned the GM title directly by winning the event. In the Girls section, five winners - Shen Yang (2006), Vera Nebolsina (2007), Nataliya Buksa (2015), Aleksandra Maltsevskaya (2018), and Polina Shuvalova (2019) have earned the WGM title directly by winning the event.

The youngest winner was Joël Lautier, who won the 1988 edition event at age 15, a record that still stands.

Four winners – Boris Spassky, Anatoly Karpov, Garry Kasparov and Viswanathan Anand – have gone on to win the World Chess Championship.

1951 – Coventry and Birmingham, England – (July) – Eighteen players played an 11-round Swiss-system tournament. Borislav Ivkov dominated the tournament with an undefeated 9.5-1.5, 1.5 points ahead of the second-place finisher. Also-rans included future leading grandmasters Bent Larsen (6.5–4.5) and Friðrik Ólafsson (5.5–5.5).

1953 – Copenhagen, Denmark – (July) – Twenty players began play in each of two sections, with the top four from each section advancing to the championship final. Oscar Panno and Klaus Darga tied for first in the final with undefeated 5.5-1.5 scores, with Panno taking the title on Sonneborn–Berger points. Former champion Ivkov and Olafsson tied for third and fourth place with even scores, with Ivkov finishing third on tiebreak. Larsen tied for fifth-eighth place with the remaining players at 2.5–4.5, finishing last of the eight finalists on tiebreak.

1955 – Antwerp, Belgium – (July) – There were 24 players in total, comprising an original entry of 23, plus an additional player from the home country to make a more manageable number. The competitors were split into three groups of eight; the representatives of USSR, Argentina and Yugoslavia (the top three teams at the 1954 Olympiad) were seeded into separate groups, and the remainder allocated their group randomly. The top three finishers of each group plus the highest scoring fourth place then went forward to a final ten player all-play-all contest. Surprise casualties at the group stage were John Purdy (Australia) and Ciric (YUG). In the final, future world champion Boris Spassky gave up just two draws to score 8–1, the also-undefeated Edmar Mednis scored 7–2, and Miguel Farre of Spain scored 6.5–2.5. Future grandmasters Lajos Portisch (HUN) (5.5–3.5) and Georgi Tringov (BUL) (5–4) finished fourth and fifth.

1957 – Toronto, Canada – (August) – Only twelve players from eleven countries competed in a round-robin tournament. William Lombardy won all eleven games, becoming the only player ever to achieve a perfect score in this tournament.

1959 – Münchenstein, Switzerland – (July–August) – Twenty-six players from all the populated continents competed. Bobby Fischer and Vlastimil Hort, the talented fifteen-year-old who had finished second in the Czechoslovakian championship, were not present. The players were divided into three preliminary groups, with the top four finishers from each group competing in the &quot;Final A&quot;, a round-robin. Bielecki won with 8.5/12, two points ahead of the second-fourth-place finishers.

1961 – The Hague, Netherlands – (August–September) – Twenty-nine players competed. Raymond Weinstein of the United States had also registered, but was ruled too old to compete. The top three finishers from each of four preliminary groups qualified for Final A. Hort competed this time, scoring 4/6 to tie with three others for first place in Preliminary Group B. Unfortunately, he finished fourth on Sonneborn–Berger tiebreak, so did not qualify for Final A. Final A saw a battle between two future grandmasters, with Bruno Parma of Yugoslavia, who had tied for second the year before, beating Florin Gheorghiu in their individual game and edging out the latter by a half-point (9/11 to Gheorghiu&#x27;s 8.5). The third-place finisher, Kuindzhi of the Soviet Union, scored 8 points. He beat both Parma and Gheorghiu, but lost to the last place finisher, Thomson of Scotland, who scored only two draws against the rest of the field.

1963 – Vrnjacka Banja, Yugoslavia – (August–September) – Thirty juniors competed in each of five preliminary groups, with the top two from each group advancing to the A Final. Once again a player who had finished second two years before became the champion, although not without difficulty. Gheorghiu of Romania and Janata tied for first with 7.5/9 scores, with Gheorghiu winning their individual game. They finished three points ahead of the third-place finisher, future grandmaster Bojan Kurajica of Yugoslavia. The match called for the tie to be broken by a four-game match, but this finished with four draws. Because Gheorghiu had the superior Sonneborn–Berger score, he was declared the champion.

1965 – Barcelona, Spain – (August–September) – Twenty-eight juniors competed in five preliminary groups, with the top two from each group advancing to the A Final. In Preliminary Group A, future grandmasters Vladimir Tukmakov and Raymond Keene tied for second with 2.5/4. Their Sonneborn–Berger scores were identical, and they had drawn their individual game, so they drew lots to break the tie. Tukmakov drew the right number to advance to the Final A. There, experience again proved helpful, with Kurajica, who had been third in Vrnjacka Banja, scoring 6.5/9 to nose out Hartoch and Tukmakov by a half-point. Future World Championship candidate Robert Hübner of West Germany finished with an even score.

1967 – Jerusalem, Israel – (August) – The June Six-Day War made it questionable whether the tournament could be held in Israel at all, and some federations asked for it to be postponed. Although the event went ahead as scheduled, a number of countries chose not to send representatives. Only nineteen players participated, with the top three finishers from each of the three preliminary groups advancing to Final A. Julio Kaplan of Puerto Rico scored 6.5/8, a point ahead of second-place finisher Raymond Keene (who, by virtue of the drawing of lots, had missed out on Final A the previous time). Future World Championship candidate Jan Timman finished third with 5/8. Hübner scored 4.5/8 to finish fourth.

1969 – Stockholm, Sweden – (August) – Thirty-eight players played in six preliminary sections, with the top two in each advancing to Final A. Among those who did not qualify for Final A was future World Championship candidate Eugenio Torre of the Philippines, who won Final B with 9/11. Final A was dominated by the rising young Soviet junior Anatoly Karpov (who would become World Champion just six years later), who gave up only two draws (10/11). András Adorján (Hungary) and Urzica (Romania) finished three points behind. The strength of the field is shown by the fact that former Champion Kaplan could only finish fourth with 6.5/11.

1971 – Athens, Greece – (July–August) – A record forty-four players from forty-three countries participated in six preliminary groups. Werner Hug of Switzerland was the surprise winner, scoring 8.5/11. Two years before, he had only finished fifth in Final C. More highly touted players finished lower: Hungarian Chess Olympiad team member and future World Championship candidate Zoltán Ribli (8/11, second); the strong American player Kenneth Rogoff (7.5/11, third); and Torre and the Soviet Grandmaster Rafael Vaganian, who were among three players scoring 7/11.

1973 – Teesside, England – (July–August) – A record fifty players from forty-eight countries competed in two preliminary Swiss-system tournaments; the top six from each qualified for Final A. The favorite, Alexander Beliavsky of the Soviet Union, won Final A with 8.5/11 despite losing to both of the English players. Tony Miles of England finished a half-point behind. There was a three-way tie for third at 7.5/11 among Michael Stean (England), Larry Christiansen (United States), and Slavoljub Marjanović of Yugoslavia, with Stean taking third on tiebreak.

1974 – Manila, Philippines – (August) – This was the first championship since the switch to an annual format. Tony Miles, who had finished second the year before, won, scoring 7/9 in the A Final. Dieks, Marjanović, and Schneider tied for second-fourth at 5.5/9.

1975 – Tjentiste, Yugoslavia – (July) – Set in the mountains about 100 miles north of Dubrovnik, the small town was the scene of World War II&#x27;s Battle of the Sutjeska. Dr. Max Euwe laid a wreath on the war memorial at the opening ceremony. The tournament was organised at the last minute by the Yugoslav Chess Federation after the Puerto Ricans withdrew their early offer, due to mounting financial pressure. Winner Valery Chekhov played skilfully throughout, scoring an undefeated 10-3 for a deserved victory; he had recently finished second in the Moscow senior championship. Larry Christiansen finished a half-point behind. He had a winning adjournment against the Soviet, but was less well prepared for the resumption and allowed it to fizzle out to a draw. The Englishman Jonathan Mestel managed a top three finish despite being one of the younger competitors. Ventzislav Inkiov of Bulgaria, like Mestel, scored 9–4, but due to an inferior Bucholz tie-splitting score, had to settle for fourth place. Forty-eight players took part including future grandmasters Jaime Sunye Neto and Murray Chandler. It was the first World Junior to feature a 13-round Swiss format.

1976 – Groningen, Netherlands – (December 21, 1976 – January 5, 1977) – Mark Diesen exceeded expectations, scoring 10–3 to win the event. Some credited Diesen&#x27;s success to the considerable coaching and adjournment skills of his second, GM Lubomir Kavalek, who later helped Nigel Short beat Anatoly Karpov and reach a World Championship match against Garry Kasparov. This year the tournament was combined with the European Junior Chess Championship. Ľubomír Ftáčnik, who finished half a point behind Diesen, was the top-placed European and thereby became the European Junior Champion. Nir Grinberg of Israel finished third with a 9–4 score. Tied for 4th-8th places were Daniel Cámpora from Argentina, Leslie Leow from Singapore, Marcel Sisniega from Mexico and Evgeny Vladimirov from the USSR. Also in the chasing pack were Ian Rogers (AUS), Krum Georgiev (BUL), Attila Grószpéter (HUN), Jonathan Mestel (ENG), Petar Popović (YUG), Reynaldo Vera (CUB), Murray Chandler (NZL) and Margeir Petursson (ISL).

1977 – Innsbruck, Austria – (September 4–19) – Artur Yusupov, a 17-year-old economics student at Moscow University, won the event with 10.5 points out of 13. Second-placed Zapata, a point behind, was also studying economics, at the University of Bogotá. Yusupov&#x27;s second was the Russian IM Mark Dvoretsky and their alliance heralded the start of a long-running and mutually beneficial relationship. Marcel Sisniega of Mexico hired experienced Soviet GM Vasiukov to be his second and it may have boosted his performance, but not enough to make a difference to the medals. Petar Popović scored 8.5 points for the bronze medal. Also challenging for honours were Skembris of Greece, Fries-Nielsen of Denmark and Vera of Cuba, who lost out to Popović on tie-break.

1979 – Skien, Norway – (July 27 – August 10) – The first three finishers were expected to do well, but disappointing was the form of the highly rated Artur Yusupov, who only scored 7.5-5.5, tying for 12th-17th out of 56 players. Among the chasing pack were James Plaskett, Margeir Petursson, Ivan Morovic and Attila Grószpéter.

1989 – Tunja, Colombia – (August 15–31) – Due to the drug wars then raging in Colombia, some countries, including the British Chess Federation, boycotted the event. Vasil Spasov of Bulgaria was the surprise winner of the boys/open event, benefiting from a slip by his closest rival, Jacek Gdański of Poland. Gdanski managed to lose his last 2 games to throw away a 1½ point lead. Consequently, his earlier loss to Spasov was decisive in the tie-break. Sharing 3rd-5th with Swede Richard Wessman were the Soviets, Alexey Dreev and Mikhail Ulibin. Slightly off the pace were Alexei Shirov (1 point behind) and Zsuzsa Polgar (2 points behind).

1991 – Mamaia, Romania – (August) – The tournament had to be put together in hasty fashion when the planned hosts (the Chilean Chess Federation) dropped out at the last minute. Despite this setback, the proceedings went without any serious hitch and the players appreciated the excellent conditions and sound organising skills of the Romanian officials. Hot favourites for a clean sweep in the Boys/Open U-20 event were the Soviets Vladimir Akopian, Sergei Tiviakov and Mikhail Ulibin. It turned out that all three were in good form and the medals were divided between them, following a tie-break to separate the top two. The Girls U-20 event was a two-horse race between Bojkovic of Yugoslavia and Botsari of Greece, the Yugoslav girl winning out by a half point:

1993 – Kozhikode, India – (November – December) – Top seed in the Boys / Open event, Matthew Sadler of England, led with the Czech Republic&#x27;s Vlastimil Babula for much of the tournament. With both players facing top quality opposition each round, the pressure finally became too great and both failed at the final hurdle in their quest for the gold medal. Sadler also suffered from serious and frequent time trouble. This strong event contained many players who went on to become top-flight grandmasters; Alexander Onischuk, Christian Gabriel, Vladislav Tkachiev and Peter-Heine Nielsen were just four of the strong finishers not amongst the medals. Swede Jonas Barkhagen also played some enterprising chess, but was just unable to keep up with the leading group. In the Girls event, Armenian Elina Danielian, Krystina Dabrowska of Poland and Adrienn Csőke of Hungary were among those challenging for the medals. FIDE President Florencio Campomanes attended the closing ceremony and announced a new directive that assured future winners of the Boys / Open event an automatic Grandmaster title.

<text>Alan Miller is an American video game designer who was the co-founder of the video game company Activision.

==Career==
Miller studied electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, graduating in 1973.

Miller joined Atari, Inc. in February 1977 and was one of the first four Atari 2600 game designers. His 2600 titles include &quot;Surround&quot;, &quot;Hangman&quot; and &quot;Basketball&quot;. With others, he co-authored the operating system for the Atari 400/800 computers in late 1978 and early 1979. His last game for Atari, &quot;Basketball&quot;, was one of the first ROM games for the Atari computers. Miller did not work on any Atari 2600 cartridges during his last year with Atari.

In late 1979, Miller left Atari with three other programmers, David Crane, Larry Kaplan and Bob Whitehead. They were disillusioned and disappointed with Atari&#x27;s refusal to give them screen credit for any of the games they worked on. With music industry executive, Jim Levy, they formed Activision, the first independent video game developer and publisher. Activision rapidly grew to US$159 million in revenue in 1983, its third year of sales. Miller acted as Vice President of Product Development and designed several of the company&#x27;s first games. Among his games designed while with Activision are &quot;Checkers&quot;, &quot;Tennis&quot;, &quot;Ice Hockey&quot;, &quot;Starmaster&quot; and &quot;Robot Tank&quot;. Miller experimented with implementing a 3D display for the game Checkers but due to technical limitations of both the Atari 2600 and television sets of the era, the idea was dropped.

Miller and Whitehead thought that diversification to other platforms, such as the home computers like the Commodore 64, was essential for success. Activision was resistant to this idea, so he and Whitehead left Activision in 1984 and together formed the game publisher Accolade. While with his new company, he designed only one game, &quot;Law of the West&quot; for the Commodore 64. Miller started as Vice President of Product Development but in a few years rose to chairman and CEO.

After ten years at Accolade, Miller left in 1994. Accolade hit hard times and in 1999 was purchased by Infogrames, which later changed its subsidiaries&#x27; names to Atari, Atari Europe, Atari Australia, and Atari Japan respectively.

In September 2001, Miller rejoined David Crane at Crane&#x27;s company, Skyworks Technologies, a leading developer of custom branded online games (advergames) for Fortune 100 companies, where he served as Vice President of Business Development for four years.

==Click Health==
In 1997, Miller co-founded Click Health, a pioneering publisher of health education games for children with asthma and diabetes. The games were made available for Nintendo consoles and IBM PCs. Miller served as chairman and CEO. Clinical trials of the company&#x27;s games demonstrated significant effectiveness. In a clinical trial with pediatric diabetes patients at Stanford University Medical Center and Kaiser Permanente, children who played the company&#x27;s diabetes game, &quot;Packy and Marlon&quot;, experienced a 77% reduction in urgent care visits over six months, compared to children in the control group who were given a standard video game to play. The company&#x27;s anti-smoking game, &quot;Rex Ronan: Experimental Surgeon&quot;, is an interactive exhibit in the Health Odyssey Museum at the Centers for Disease Control headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, played by thousands of children each year as they tour the museum.

Unable to find significant interest in distribution of the effective games through health care providers, insurers, and government agencies, Click Health closed its doors in September 2001.

<text>Imelda Romualdez Marcos (; born Imelda Remedios Visitación Trinidad Romuáldez; July 2, 1929) is a Filipino politician who was First Lady of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986, wielding significant political power after her husband Ferdinand Marcos placed the country under martial law in September 1972. She is the mother of current president Bongbong Marcos.

During her husband&#x27;s 21-year rule, Imelda Marcos ordered the construction of many grandiose architectural projects, using public funds and &quot;in impossibly short order&quot; – a propaganda practice, which eventually came to be known as her &quot;edifice complex&quot;. She and her husband stole billions of pesos from the Filipino people, amassing a personal fortune estimated to have been worth to by the time they were deposed in 1986; by 2018, about $3.6 billion of this had been recovered by the Philippine government, either through compromise deals or sequestration cases.

Marcos and her family gained notoriety for living a lavish lifestyle during a period of economic crisis and civil unrest in the country. She spent much of her time abroad on state visits, extravagant parties, and shopping sprees, and spent much of the State&#x27;s money on her personal art, jewelry and shoe collections – amassing 3,000 pairs of shoes. The subject of dozens of court cases around the world, she was eventually convicted of corruption charges in 2018 for her activities during her term as governor of Metro Manila; the case is under appeal. She and her husband hold the Guinness World Record for the &quot;Greatest Robbery of a Government&quot;, putting Suharto of neighboring Indonesia at second.

The People Power Revolution in February 1986 unseated the Marcoses and forced the family into exile in Hawaii. In 1991, President Corazon Aquino allowed the Marcos family to return to the Philippines to face various charges after the 1989 death of Ferdinand. Imelda Marcos was elected four times to the House of Representatives of the Philippines, and ran twice for the presidency of the Philippines but failed to garner enough votes.

== Early life ==
Imelda Remedios Visitación Romuáldez was born at dawn in San Miguel, Manila, on July 2, 1929. Her parents were Vicente Orestes Romuáldez (1885–1955), a lawyer, and his second wife, Maria Remedios Trinidad (1902–1938). Imelda is the sixth of Vicente&#x27;s eleven children, and Remedios&#x27; firstborn. Her paternal great-grandfather is Fray Francisco Miguel Lopez Silgado, a Spanish Friar and silversmith from Granada, Andalusia who became the parish priest of Pandacan in Manila. 

Born into the Romualdez political dynasty from the province of Leyte, Imelda grew up in a wealthy clan of devout Catholics. She was baptized in the nearby San Miguel Church on the day after her birth.

Notable members of Imelda&#x27;s family include the clan matriarch &quot;Doña&quot; Trinidad Lopez de Romualdez; her uncle Norberto Romualdez, who was a Supreme Court Associate Justice; and her younger brother Benjamin &quot;Kokoy&quot; Romualdez, who served as Governor of Leyte and later as an ambassador under the regime of Imelda&#x27;s husband, Ferdinand Marcos.

At the time of her birth, the Romualdezes were wealthy. Around 1932, the financial conditions of Imelda&#x27;s family began to decline.

Imelda&#x27;s parents were separated for a time, during which Remedios worked for the nuns at the Asilo de San Vicente de Paul. Vicente and Remedios eventually reconciled but to avoid further conflict, she and her children, including Imelda, moved to their house&#x27;s garage. In 1937, after Conchita&#x27;s birth, Remedios&#x27;s health began to fail and she died on April 7, 1938, due to double pneumonia. In her ten years of marriage, Remedios had six children – Imelda, Benjamin, Alita, Alfredo, Armando, and Conchita. Remedios was born and raised in Baliwag, Bulacan.

In November 1938, Imelda&#x27;s father gave up Manila due to his declining fortunes in his law practice and returned to Tacloban, where he could support his family with a simpler lifestyle. She grew up learning the Waray language, and then learned the Tagalog language and eventually English.

== Education ==
=== Elementary ===
Imelda finished grade one in the nearby College of the Holy Spirit Manila, where her older half-sisters also studied.

She continued her early studies at Holy Infant Academy, a convent school run by Order of Saint Benedict. The old wooden structure of the school still stands today four blocks away from the Romualdez house. At school, Imelda had to face her family&#x27;s humiliating poverty, and she was frequently among the students who had to apologize for late payments.

=== High school ===
In 1942, the Romualdezes returned to Tacloban, and around that time, Imelda&#x27;s father refused to let her go back to school. When the Americans returned in 1944, she was eager to resume her studies at Leyte Progressive High School. She finished her first year at the provincial high school where she was also chosen Miss I-A; then in her second year, she moved to Holy Infant and stayed there until she graduated.

Imelda continued her higher studies at Holy Infant Academy from 1938 to 1948, the year she graduated from high school. As a student, her scholastic record shows that she had a general average of 80 percent throughout her primary and high school.

=== College ===
Imelda ran for President of the student council at St. Paul&#x27;s College (now named Divine Word University) in 1951, three years before her marriage to Marcos. At that time, she was about to graduate with a degree in Education. She was put up as candidate for the Department of Education, which had an enrollment of 800 students. Even during the nomination, her victory was already a foregone conclusion, but the school authorities insisted that another candidate be put up to make the elections a democratic procedure. That was how the College of Law, with 200 students, put up Francisco Pedrosa.

While an undergraduate student, Marcos taught at a local Chinese high school before graduating in 1952. She had won a scholarship to study music at the Philippine Women&#x27;s University under Adoración Reyes, a close friend of the family. She briefly held a job at a music store but left this for a better one at the Central Bank. After a few lessons, Adoración was convinced that Imelda had talent and persuaded her to enroll at the College of Music and Fine Arts at Philippine Women&#x27;s University (PWU), under a special arrangement that put her on register while Adoración continued to give her free lessons.

== Early career ==
Imelda returned to Manila in 1952 under the rule of President Elpidio Quirino and stayed in the house of her relative, House of Representatives of the Philippines Speaker &quot;Pro tempore&quot; Daniel Romuáldez, who had three adopted children. Imelda&#x27;s status in the Romuáldez household during this time has been described as &quot;higher than servants and lower than family members as a poor relative&quot;. Imelda found work as a salesgirl in a store called P.E. Domingo, which infuriated her father when he learnt of during one of his visits, perceiving it as ill treatment of Imelda.

To calm the indignation of Vicente Romuáldez, Eduardo and Daniel exercised their political and economic influence to find work for Imelda in the Central Bank where she worked under Braulio Hipuna, the Chief Clerk of the Intelligence Division.

During this time her cousin Loreto Ramos introduced her to Adoración Reyes, a teacher from the College of Music and Fine Arts of Philippine Women&#x27;s University (PWU), who gave her vocal lessons and a chance to get a PWU scholarship. She later sang three songs at a performance with her cousin Loreto at Holy Ghost College (now named College of the Holy Spirit Manila).

Imelda also joined the 1953 Miss Manila beauty pageant. The results became controversial, resulting in both Imelda and Miss Norma Jiménez being declared Manila&#x27;s candidate to the larger Miss Philippines pageant. Both of them eventually lost to Miss Cristina Galang.

== Courtship and marriage ==
Imelda and Ferdinand Marcos met on April 6, 1954, during a budget hearing at the Philippine Congress. Ferdinand was part of the opposition team who led the argument against the budget, while Imelda was there to visit her cousin Daniel, who was the Speaker of the House. During a recess, Imelda caught Ferdinand&#x27;s eye, and he asked his journalist friend Jose Guevara of &quot;The Manila Times&quot; to introduce him to Imelda. At that time, Ferdinand already knew of Imelda. Imelda, on the other hand, knew very little of Ferdinand Marcos. After comparing heights and confirming that he was at least an inch taller than her, Ferdinand sought the help of Guevara to pursue Imelda in marriage. This whirlwind courtship lasted only eleven days.

During Holy Week of that year, Ferdinand visited Imelda&#x27;s house, and when Imelda claimed that she planned to spend the holidays in Baguio, Ferdinand and Guevara offered her a ride up to Daniel&#x27;s family mansion where she planned to stay, while the two booked a room in nearby Pines. For the remainder of that Holy Week, Ferdinand showered Imelda with flowers and gifts and visited her daily, prodding her to sign the marriage license that sealed the agreement. On April 16, 1954, Good Friday, after having been jokingly asked by Guevara if she wanted to be &quot;the First Lady of the Land someday&quot;, Imelda finally agreed to sign it. On April 17, 1954, Ferdinand and Imelda were secretly married by a reluctant Francisco Chanco, a judge befriended by Ferdinand who lived in the area. The church wedding followed only after receiving the blessing of Vicente Orestes, Imelda&#x27;s father, which Ferdinand asked via telegram on Easter Sunday. Their wedding was held on May 1, 1954, at the San Miguel Pro-Cathedral in Manila where Imelda was christened.

The marriage meant that Ferdinand&#x27;s common-law wife, Carmen Ortega of La Union&#x27;s Ortega political clan, with whom he had already sired three children, had to be quietly taken out of the public eye.

== 1965 presidential campaign ==

It was during the 1965 campaign that Imelda became influential as a political figure at the national level, supporting her husband’s political tactics through her charismatic appeal and youth. Crowds of working-class Filipinos came out in droves to Marcos campaigns because they wanted to see the &quot;beautiful wife of Marcos&quot;.

Campaign strategists incorporated Imelda’s public appeal into the overall tone of the Marcos-led Nacionalista campaign, asking Imelda to always appear at her best in public at all times regardless of the type of audience and encouraging her to wear her signature ternos as an integral part of their image strategy.

Marcos heavily relied on Imelda, eventually telling the press at one point that it was Imelda who had delivered the one million vote margin he needed to win the election.

It was in this period that Imelda described herself – a neophyte transitioning into a true political partner to her husband – as &quot;a butterfly breaking out of its cocoon&quot;. This led one foreign journalist to call her &quot;the iron butterfly&quot;.

Imelda had assumed a managerial position in her husband&#x27;s campaign early on when Marcos faced his first challenge, which was to win the presidential candidacy for the Nacionalista Party. She enthusiastically ran a detailed campaign, befriending the 1,347 delegates of the Nacionalista Party Convention until Ferdinand Marcos won the party’s presidential nomination on November 21, 1964, for the Nacionalista Party.

McCoy recounts that it was supposedly also Imelda who convinced Fernando Lopez to accept the vice-presidential nomination alongside Marcos. She met Lopez personally, appealing to him by recounting the many struggles she and Ferdinand faced during the campaign. Lopez refused to give in multiple times, until Imelda cried in front of him. When he relented, Imelda proceeded to hand a document to sign, stating that he had accepted the nomination as the Nacionalista vice-presidential candidate.

During the presidential election itself, she delivered votes from the southern province of Leyte and Manila. She was especially popular with the poor. Imelda also used her voice to appeal to voters, singing during campaigns. Her songs were usually varieties of local folk songs.

== First term (1965–1969) ==
During Ferdinand Marcos&#x27;s first term, Imelda began doing the duties traditionally expected of a First Lady, mostly social events and public appearances. Imelda became a power broker. Receptions at her offices in the Malacañang &quot;Music Room&quot; were sought after by cabinet members, heads of financing institutions, and business leaders who felt that she had Ferdinand&#x27;s ear.

A year later in March 1966, Marcos established the Cultural Center of the Philippines through Executive Order No. 60 and arranged for Imelda to be elected chairman of the board in a bid to change the perception that she was just another &quot;politician&#x27;s wife&quot;.

=== Inauguration ===

Ferdinand Marcos was elected as the 10th president of the Philippines on November 9, 1965. When he was inaugurated on December 30, 1965, Imelda officially became the First Lady.

The Romualdez clan had been torn apart by the presidential campaign. To fix this, Imelda allegedly sent out invitations to family members, some of whom supported the opposing party, and told them they were all welcome at their house on Ortega Street in San Juan, which was then part of Rizal.

Ferdinand and Imelda held Mass in the courtyard of their house on Ortega Street before proceeding to Luneta Park for the inauguration ceremonies.

At night, a state dinner hosted 60 guests in the reception hall of the Malacañang Palace.

=== Early projects ===
In the first three years of being First Lady, she spent for the beautification of the Paco Park and for the beautification of Fort Santiago.

In May 1966, Imelda pushed a twelve million peso plan to pool together the social welfare efforts of several dozen social welfare groups. The plan involved the construction of welfare villages and the reorientation of personnel to staff them. The cornerstone for first village, the Reception and Study Center in Quezon City was laid in 1966, and several more were built from then until 1968: Marilla Hills in Alabang, the Children&#x27;s Orphanage in Pasay, the Molave Village in Tanay, Rizal, a Home for the Aged in Quezon City, and the Philippine Village at Manila International Airport.

In mid-1967, Imelda started the &quot;Share for Progress&quot; Seed Dispersal Program a project that suggested making vegetable gardens out of idle lots all over the country. By 1968, 309,392 kits containing seeds had been distributed in over 1500 towns.

=== Blue Ladies ===
The &quot;Blue Ladies&quot;, a group initially composed of wives of political men in the Nacionalista Party, had played a critical role during Marcos&#x27;s 1965 campaign. They contributed funds and provided publicity, giving the campaign a personal touch by visiting factories and farms to shake hands and have small conversations with the voters, making door-to-door appeals in the slum areas. That year they also introduced to politics the purchase of radio and television time, to campaign for Marcos, through the use of little speeches for the voters. This was affordable because the Blue Ladies were mostly prominent matrons and/or beautiful youthful girls married to men of means.

Upon becoming First Lady, Imelda often asked members of the Blue Ladies to accompany her on her trips out of the country. One of her most famous socialite friends was Cristina Ford.

Imelda&#x27;s Blue Ladies—specifically Maria Luisa, a daughter of the rich Madrigal family and the wife of Daniel Vazquez—contributed to the fashion spending of Imelda. In 1968, Maria Luisa accompanied Imelda on an overseas trip, during which Imelda and daughter Imee spent $3.3 million. At this time Vazquez and Maria Luisa opened a Citibank account. In November 1968, the couple added &quot;Fernanda Vazquez&quot; as a joint holder of the bank account. An allegation that Imelda and Fernanda Vazquez are one and the same is validated by the notations for the bank account had Imelda Marcos&#x27;s handwriting.

=== Beatles incident ===

On July 4, 1966, the First Lady invited the Beatles to perform at a private event in the Palace, but the invitation was declined. As a result of the rejection, an order to lock down Manila International Airport was enacted; this resulted in mobs trying to storm the band&#x27;s hotel rooms and prevent them from leaving the country. There were also reports that a tax assessment was issued to their manager.

=== Increased independence ===
The Dovie Beams scandal, which began as rumors in the late 1960s, eventually led to a significant change in Imelda&#x27;s public role. President Marcos had met the American actress after she arrived in Manila in 1968 to play the female lead in &quot;Maharlika&quot;, a propaganda film portraying Ferdinand&#x27;s supposed exploits during World War II. According to Beams, the two had an affair and she was moved into one of Ferdinand&#x27;s safe houses, where she recorded their sexual encounters with Ferdinand&#x27;s full consent. These tapes were later played in a press conference, causing great humiliation for Imelda.

Members of the Marcos Cabinet such as Cesar Virata and Gerardo Sicat recount that Imelda used the humiliation of the Dovie Beams affair as leverage to begin developing an independent political agenda which gave her more and more political power. Initially, this meant that Imelda had free rein on her projects while her husband prepared for the 1969 presidential campaign, but as Marcos&#x27;s health declined, it involved her being put in increasingly powerful positions, including those of Minister of Human Settlements and of Governor of Metro Manila.

== Second term (1969–1972) ==
In July 1974, the annual Ms. Universe pageant was held in Manila, to which then First Lady Imelda Marcos allegedly spent () for the renovation of all public and private infrastructures throughout Manila, and the other cities in which the Ms. Universe pageant participants were subsequently toured.

=== Foreign relations roles ===
Given that the President hardly left the Malacañang Palace, Ferdinand increasingly sent his wife on official visits to other countries as a de facto vice president.

When the Marcoses went to the United States in September 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson offered Imelda the Philippine war damage claims totaling . President Johnson agreed to have be used as funds for the Cultural Center, one of Imelda&#x27;s projects.

For the inauguration of the CCP, a gala opening of the Golden Salakot, a pageant-drama of a story about the prehistory of the Philippines, occurred on September 8, 1969. US President Richard Nixon was invited but instead California Governor (and future President) Ronald Reagan, along with his wife, flew to the country on Air Force One for the event. There were accounts that the First Lady attempted to bring other celebrities by getting them tickets to ride Air Force One, but she was denied this luxury by President Nixon. Accounts have also mentioned that this trip by the then-Governor Reagan and his wife led to the closeness of the Reagans and Marcoses.

In 1971, Imelda attended Iran&#x27;s 2,500-year celebration of the Persian Empire of the founding of the Persian Empire. This trip, according to palace insiders, provided her with a social introduction to some of the world&#x27;s wealthiest people.

=== Accusation of bribery in Constitutional Convention ===

On May 19, 1972, the Constitutional Convention delegate for Leyte&#x27;s first district, Eduardo Quintero, accused Imelda and thirteen others of bribing some of the convention members to vote against provisions which would have prevented Marcos from retaining power beyond the two four-year terms allowed him by the previous constitution.

In the stress following the accusations and media circus, Imelda claimed to have suffered a miscarriage. Later, this was revealed to be a hoax to avoid Quintero&#x27;s charges. According to Ellison, this was &quot;an eloquent example of the lengths to which Imelda would go to support [Ferdinand] and her ambition&quot;.

=== Actions preceding martial law ===
In Ferdinand&#x27;s diary preceding May, he wrote that he and Imelda were planning to wager all their power and wealth &quot;on a single throw of the dice of fate for the sake of the people and the Republic&quot;.

On the eve of September 5, 1972, tourism minister Manuel Elizalde called each member of Manila&#x27;s foreign press corps to a party. Imelda arrived at the party, allegedly rambling about democracy and how only the Americans could afford it. On that same day, Martial Law was announced. Ferdinand stated the purpose of the Martial Law was to create a &quot;New Society&quot; with reformed institutions, no inequalities, corruption, or crime. Imelda called it &quot;martial law with a smile&quot;. Days after the announcement, a warrant of arrest was issued for Amelita Cruz, author of the &quot;you-know-who&quot; columns on Imelda. Cruz was told that the orders &quot;came directly from the music room&quot;, Imelda&#x27;s palace study.

== Martial law (1972–1981) ==
During this time period, she orchestrated public events using national funds to bolster her and her husband&#x27;s image. She secured the Miss Universe 1974 pageant in Manila, which required the construction of the Folk Arts Theater in less than three months. She organized the &quot;Kasaysayan ng Lahi&quot;, a festival showcasing Philippine history. She also initiated social programs, such as the Green Revolution, which was intended to address hunger by encouraging the people to plant produce in household gardens, and created a national family-planning program.

In 1972, she took control of the distribution of a bread ration called Nutribun, which actually came from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

=== Stabbing attack ===
An assassination attempt against Imelda Marcos occurred on December 7, 1972, when an assailant named Carlito Dimahilig tried to stab her on live television with a bolo knife in Nayong Pilipino but was shot by the police. Congressman Jose Aspiras and Linda Amor Robles were also injured in trying to subdue the attacker. 
The motive appeared to have been her role in her husband&#x27;s presidency, but human rights dissidents believed it was staged by the government.

Marcos was immediately flown by helicopter to the Makati Medical Center, with her husband immediately driving to the hospital upon hearing the news while playing golf at Malacañang Park&#x27;s Pangarap golf course.

=== Foreign relations roles ===
In 1972, Imelda Marcos initiated the first of many trips to the Soviet Union; it was dubbed as &quot;cultural missions&quot; but eventually led to the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Philippines.

In 1975, after the assassination of King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, Marcos wanted to extend the official condolences. Women were not welcome in the Saudi court, but Imelda, through her connection to the surgeon who previously performed a heart surgery on the new king, managed to be the first woman guest to be honored.

In 1978, she was also appointed as Ambassador Plenipotentiary and Extraordinary, allowing her to tour the United States, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Cuba. Throughout her travels, she became friends with Richard Nixon, Muammar Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein, Fidel Castro, and Josip Broz Tito. She traveled to Iraq to secure oil and to Libya for a peace treaty with the Moro National Liberation Front.

=== Governor of Metro Manila ===

In 1975, Ferdinand Marcos issued Presidential Decree 824, establishing the Metro Manila Commission (MMC), the central government of Metro Manila, and named Imelda to head it, making her Governor of Metro Manila from that point until the Marcoses were deposed in 1986.

=== Minister of Human Settlements ===
Ferdinand Marcos appointed Imelda to the position of Minister of Human Settlements in 1976—a post which she held until the EDSA Revolution of February 1986, and which allowed her to construct the Cultural Center of the Philippines, the Philippine Heart Center, the Lung Center of the Philippines, the Philippine International Convention Center, the Coconut Palace, the Manila Film Center, and the Calauit Safari Park.

=== Batasang Pambansa ===

In 1978, Kilusang Bagong Lipunan party fielded Imelda as a candidate in the Philippine parliamentary elections of 1978. Because most of the opposition candidates were either in jail or had limited mobility as a result of Martial Law, Imelda Marcos easily won a seat as a member of the Interim Batasang Pambansa (National Congress) representing Region IV (Metro Manila).

=== Role in Benigno Aquino Jr.&#x27;s exile ===
In 1980, after learning former Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. had a life-threatening heart ailment, Imelda convinced her husband to allow Aquino leave for the United States for medical treatment. This was arranged after a secret hospital visit by Imelda. Aquino supposedly agreed to her conditions that he return to the Philippines and not speak out against the Marcos regime in the US. Having made a quick recovery, Aquino decided to remain in the US, saying that &quot;a pact with the devil is no pact at all&quot;.

Six months after martial law was lifted on January 17, 1981, Ferdinand Marcos was re-elected as president. While her husband began to suffer from lupus erythematosus, Imelda effectively ruled in his place.

Imelda claimed that during her last meeting with Aquino on May 21, 1983, in New York, she &quot;begged him for 3½ hours to postpone his return to the Philippines until it was safe for him to come&quot;. Aquino returned to the Philippines on August 21, 1983, and was assassinated at Manila International Airport upon his arrival. Feeling that he was pressured into causing an investigation of the assassination, Ferdinand created the Agrava Commission, a fact-finding committee, to investigate the circumstances surrounding the assassination of Aquino Jr., ultimately finding the military guilty.

== Downfall ==
On February 7, 1986, snap elections were held between Ferdinand Marcos and Corazon Aquino, the widow of Benigno Aquino Jr. Despite Ferdinand Marcos claiming to have won the election, allegations of vote rigging led to mass protests, later known as the People Power Revolution.

On February 25, Ferdinand Marcos, with his wife Imelda by his side, held the inauguration at Malacañang Palace. The couple later emerged on the Palace balcony in front of a loyalist crowd and Imelda sang a song for the crowd.

Later that day, Ferdinand Marcos finally agreed to step down and was given safe passage for him and his entire family to flee to Hawaii, United States.

== Exile in Hawaii (1986–1991) ==
At midnight, February 26, 1986, the Marcos family fled the country to Hawaii with a party of about 80 individuals – the extended Marcos family and a number of close associates. Their arrival was controversial, and soon led to Hawaii residents calling on the government to force the Marcoses to leave.

The US Government initially hosted the exiles at Hickam Air Force Base. Ferdinand and Imelda moved into a pair of residences in Makiki Heights, Honolulu, a month later.

Ferdinand Marcos eventually died in exile in September 1989. His son Bongbong was the only family member present at his deathbed.

After Imelda left Malacañang Palace, press reports worldwide took note of her lavish wardrobe, said to include 15 mink coats, 508 gowns, 888 handbags, and 3,000 pairs of shoes. Some news reports estimated that there were up to 7,500 pairs, but &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that the final tally was 1,060. The US government documented that the Marcos family entered the United States with millions of dollars in cash, stocks, jewelry, and gold kilobars inscribed &quot;To my husband on our 24th anniversary&quot;.

== Return from exile (1991–present) ==
On November 4, 1991, President Corazon Aquino allowed Imelda and her children to return to the Philippines so they could be formally charged in their tax fraud and corruption cases – part of the government&#x27;s effort to convince Swiss courts to return the money in the Marcos&#x27; Swiss Bank accounts to the Philippine government.

After her return from exile, Imelda returned to politics.

In 1992, Imelda ran for president in the 1992 Philippine presidential election, finishing 5th out of 7 candidates.

She was elected as a congresswoman of Leyte during the 1995 Philippine general election, representing the first district, despite facing a disqualification lawsuit in which the Supreme Court ruled in her favor.

She chose not to seek re-election in Congress and instead sought the presidency again in the 1998 Philippine presidential election, but later withdrew to support the eventual winner Joseph Estrada, while she finished 9th among 11 candidates. She considered running for mayor of Manila in the 2001 Philippine general election but did not push through with it.

In November 2006, Marcos started her own business, a fashion label &quot;Imelda Collection&quot; including jewelry, clothing and shoes with the help of her daughter Imee.

Imelda ran for the second district of Ilocos Norte in the 2010 Philippine House of Representatives elections to replace her son, Ferdinand Jr. (Bongbong), who ran for senator under the Nacionalista Party. During her term, she held the position of Millennium Development Goals committee chair in the Lower House.

She was re-elected on May 14, 2013, and on May 9, 2016, for a third and final term.

In October 2018, Marcos filed her certificate of candidacy to run for governor of Ilocos Norte in the 2019 Philippine general election to replace her daughter, Imee, who was term-limited and chose to run for senator. However, following her conviction of graft, she withdrew from the race a month later and was substituted by her grandson Matthew Manotoc, initially her running mate for vice governor. Manotoc eventually won the gubernatorial race.

Marcos underwent a successful angioplasty at St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Center – Global City, Taguig on May 7, 2023. She was hospitalized in March 2024 after contracting a suspected case of pneumonia.

== Major court cases ==
Imelda Marcos has been involved in court cases against her in the Philippines and abroad. Some of these, such as her corruption charges in the Philippines, are criminal cases. Others, such as the rulings of the Swiss Federal Court on her bank accounts, are either civil or forfeiture cases.

=== 1988 racketeering case (Manhattan) ===
In October 1988, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, together with eight associates (including Adnan Khashoggi, a Saudi Arabian businessman and weapons smuggler believed to have been involved with her husband&#x27;s regime), were indicted by a federal grand jury in Manhattan on charges of racketeering, conspiracy, fraud and obstruction of justice. She pleaded not guilty to federal charges that she used $103 million in stolen government funds to buy Manhattan real estate and art. Tobacco heiress Doris Duke posted $5 million bail for the former First Lady. The Marcos couple&#x27;s defense team was led by criminal defense attorney Gerry Spence. Actor George Hamilton, an unindicted co-conspirator, testified at trial under a grant of immunity, acknowledging that he had received a $5.5-million loan from Marcos&#x27;s associate. In July 1990, following a three-month trial, she was acquitted of all charges, after Imelda had successfully characterized herself as “a poor widow who knew nothing about her husband’s activities.”

=== 1990 Swiss Federal Supreme Court forfeiture case ===
In 1990, the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland ruled that funds in the Marcoses&#x27; Swiss bank accounts were of &quot;criminal provenance&quot;. This cleared the way for the transfer of assets worth around $356 million back to the Philippines. These assets were previously frozen by Swiss courts in 1986 shortly after the People Power Revolution. The decision eventually led to reforms in 1998 that made it more difficult for dictators and criminals to keep their money in the Swiss banking system.

=== 1995 human rights violations class suit (Hawaii) ===
In February 1995, the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii ruled against the Marcoses, awarding $1.96 billion to 9,539 victims of human rights violations during the Marcos dictatorship. This decision was upheld by US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in 1996. The ruling has yet to be enforced in the Philippines due to jurisdiction issues.

=== Corruption cases in the Philippines ===
Upon the Marcos family&#x27;s return to the Philippines in the early 1990s, 28 criminal cases were filed against Mrs. Marcos by the Philippines&#x27; Office of the Ombudsman from 1991 to 1995.
These included cases of graft and malversation of public funds.

In 1993, Marcos was convicted on a graft case. This was overturned by the Appellate Court in 2008, and the reversal was upheld by the Philippine Supreme Court in 2018 because of technical issues with the evidence.

In March 2008, a judge in Manila acquitted her of 32 counts of illegal transfers of funds to Swiss bank accounts between 1968 and 1976, determining that the government had failed to prove its case.

In 2011, the Sandiganbayan Fifth Division ordered her to return in government funds taken by her and her husband from the National Food Authority. On November 9, 2018, the Sandiganbayan convicted Marcos on seven counts of graft and corruption, which disqualified Marcos from holding any public office.

In October 2015, Imelda Marcos still faced 10 criminal charges of graft and 25 civil cases in the Philippines.

=== 2018 Swiss foundation cases convictions ===
In 1991, Marcos was indicted on ten corruption charges in the Philippines&#x27; anti-graft court, the Sandiganbayan.

Twenty-seven years later, on November 9, 2018, she was convicted on seven counts of violating the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, for funneling roughly to various Swiss foundations while she was still serving as governor of Metro Manila in the 1970s. That same day, the court announced her acquittal on the three remaining counts, but since she failed to appear, the court also ordered the forfeiture of the earlier bond that she had posted in 1991.

She was sentenced to prison terms ranging from six to eleven years for each count – totalling a minimum of 42 years and 7 months, and a maximum of 77 years. The Sandiganbayan also disqualified Marcos, a representative for the first district of Ilocos Norte and a candidate for governor of the same province, from holding any public office. The sanction will not go into immediate effect, pending appeal by her, but she nonetheless withdrew her candidacy for the governorship.

On November 12, 2018, Marcos&#x27;s attorney filed a &quot;Motion for Leave of Court to Avail of Post-Conviction Remedies&quot;, which included a provision for bail. The court granted bail due to her &quot;ill health&quot;, but reserved ruling on the balance of the requests until November 28. Marcos posted bail on November 16, 2018, a week after her conviction. She intends to appeal her conviction. The normal form of appeal is a motion for reconsideration to the Sandiganbayan; she further requested a direct appeal to the Philippine Supreme Court, which was originally denied as premature, then granted on November 28.

== Personal wealth ==
=== Court rulings and estimated amount ===
The Philippine Supreme Court considers the unexplained wealth of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos to be &quot;ill-gotten&quot; based on the definitions set forth in Republic Act 1379, which was passed in 1955. The Supreme Court&#x27;s interpretation of R.A. 1379 says that property acquired by a public officer or employee which is &quot;manifestly out of proportion to his salary as such public officer and to his other lawful income&quot; is &quot;presumed prima facie to have been unlawfully acquired&quot;. The bulk of the assets of the Marcoses, including the Marcos jewels, were treated as unlawful in a 2012 decision which specified that &quot;according to the Official Report of the Minister of Budget, the total salaries of former President Marcos as President from 1966 to 1976 was ₱60,000 a year and from 1977 to 1985, ₱100,000 a year; while that of the former First Lady, Imelda R. Marcos, as Minister of Human Settlements from June 1976 to February 22–25, 1986 was ₱75,000 a year&quot; – about $304,372.43.

Estimates of this ill-gotten wealth vary, with sources estimating a figure of about to for wealth acquired in the last years of the Marcos administration. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; estimates her current net worth at a more modest $22M (the amount declared by Imelda Marcos in 2012), but states that it is likely that she and her husband stole billions of pesos while in power, and that the amount they stole could have paid off the entirety of the Philippine foreign debt.

In a 1985 report to the United States Congress House Committee on Foreign Affairs, US Ambassador to the Philippines Stephen Bosworth estimated that the Marcoses had stolen an accumulated wealth of &quot;in recent years&quot;, in the context of the rapid decline of the Philippine economy in the early 1980s. The same figure was cited by the Philippines&#x27; Office of the Solicitor General soon after Marcos was deposed by the EDSA Revolution in 1986. Bosworth&#x27;s source, Dr. Bernardo Villegas of the Philippine think tank the Center for Research and Communication (CRC), noted that the figure ultimately cited by Bosworth was a conservative estimate, and that the amount probably came closer to $13 billion.

The PCGG&#x27;s first chairperson, Jovito Salonga, later said that he estimated the figure to be to , based on the documentary trail left behind by the Marcoses in 1986. Internationally, Salonga&#x27;s estimate has become the popularly cited estimate of the Marcoses&#x27; unexplained wealth. Dr. Jesus Estanislao, another noted economist from the CRC, said this figure reflected amounts taken out of the country in the years immediately prior to the ouster of the Marcos administration, and that there was no way to accurately estimate the wealth acquired by the Marcoses since the 1950s. He suggested that the figure could be as much as $30 billion.

Aside from the Marcoses&#x27; amassed wealth, Imelda Marcos was famous for spending it, with some accounts calling her &quot;the ultimate personification of conspicuous consumption&quot;. On one occasion, Imelda spent $2,000 on chewing gum at the San Francisco International Airport and, on another, forced a plane to do a U-turn mid-air because she had forgotten to buy cheese in Rome. A portion of her famous shoe collection is now kept in the National Museum of the Philippines, while another is displayed in a shoe museum in Marikina. Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) damaged her ancestral home in Tacloban, which also serves as a museum, although she still retains homes in Ilocos Norte and Makati, where she resides.

=== Sequestration ===
Some of this wealth has been recovered as the result of various court cases – and has either been returned to the Philippine government, or awarded as reparations to the victims of human rights abuses under Marcos&#x27;s presidency. Some of it has also been recovered by the Philippine government through settlements and compromise deals, either with Imelda or cronies who say that certain properties had been entrusted to them by the Marcoses. Some of the recovery cases have been dismissed by the courts for reasons such as improper case filing procedures and technical issues with documentary evidence. An amount of unidentified proportions has yet to be recovered, as the full extent of the family&#x27;s wealth remains unknown.

In March 1968, Ferdinand and Imelda opened four accounts, under the names of William Saunders and Jane Ryan, with Credit Suisse in Zürich,—Marcos using the alias &quot;William Saunders&quot; and Imelda using the alias &quot;Jane Ryan&quot;. These were later moved into other accounts under various dummy foundations, but when relevant records were discovered by the new Philippine government after the 1986 EDSA revolution, the Swiss Federal council froze them. On December 21, 1990, the Swiss Federal Supreme Court ruled that these accounts could be turned over to the Philippine government, on the condition that there be a concurring &quot;final and absolute judgment&quot; by a Philippine court. In 1997, the Swiss Federal Supreme Court established the funds to have been &quot;of criminal provenance&quot; and permitted their transfer to an escrow account in Manila, pending a ruling from a Philippine court which came in the form a confiscation ruling by the Philippine Supreme court on July 15, 2003. Switzerland finally released a total of $683 million in Marcos funds to the Philippines Treasury in 2004.

Throughout the 1980s, Imelda Marcos bought four prominent buildings in Manhattan. These were the Crown Building at the corner of 57th and Fifth; 40 Wall Street, later renamed the Trump building; the Herald Center; and the building at 200 Madison Avenue. She declined to buy the Empire State Building because she felt it was &quot;too ostentatious&quot;.

On January 13, 2014, three collections of Imelda Marcos&#x27;s jewelry: the Malacanang collection, the Roumeliotes collection, and the Hawaii collection; along with paintings by Claude Monet were seized by the Philippine government. In 2015, a rare pink diamond worth $5 million was discovered in her jewelry collection. The value of the three collections was appraised to be at about $21 million on February 16, 2016, when the government of the Philippines announced their intention to auction them off. They had not been sold as of April 17, 2020.

Her property also used to include a 175-piece art collection, which included works by Michelangelo, Botticelli, Canaletto, Raphael, as well as Monet&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Église et La Seine à Vétheuil&quot; (1881), Alfred Sisley&#x27;s &quot;Langland Bay&quot; (1887), and Albert Marquet&#x27;s &quot;Le Cyprès de Djenan Sidi Said&quot; (1946). On October 17, 2013, the attempted sale of two Claude Monet paintings, &quot;L&#x27;Eglise de Vetheuil&quot; and &quot;Le Bassin Aux Nymphéas&quot;, became the subject of a legal case in New York against Vilma Bautista, a one-time aide to Imelda Marcos. Bautista was sentenced in 2014 to 2–6 years in prison for attempting to sell &quot;valuable masterpieces that belonged to her country&quot;.

All told, about P170 billion worth of the Marcos wealth had been recovered by the PCGG by 2018 from the Marcoses – about $3.6 billion out of their $5 billion–to–10 billion estimated ill-gotten wealth.

=== Net worth in 2012 ===
In 2012, Imelda Marcos declared her net worth to be and was likewise listed as the second-richest Filipino politician behind boxer and politician Manny Pacquiao. She has claimed without evidence that her fortune came from Ferdinand Marcos&#x27;s discovery of Yamashita&#x27;s gold, a semi-mythical treasure trove that is widely believed in the Philippines to be part of the Japanese loot in World War II.

But Marcos has also said in interviews that &quot;If you know how rich you are, you are not rich. But me, I am not aware of the extent of my wealth. That&#x27;s how rich we are.&quot;

=== World record for largest theft from a government ===
The amount the Marcoses were estimated to have plundered from the Philippines is so large that it has been the subject of world records. Imelda Marcos, together with her husband Ferdinand (who is considered by many to be one of the greatest plunderers in history according to the &quot;Washington Post&quot;), were jointly credited in 1989 by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; with the largest-ever theft from a government: an estimated 5 billion to 10 billion dollars salted away. She is quoted as having stated: &quot;We practically own everything in the Philippines, from electricity, telecommunications, airlines, banking, beer and tobacco, newspaper publishing, television stations, shipping, oil and mining, hotels and beach resorts, down to coconut milling, small farms, real estate and insurance.&quot; In 2009, Imelda Marcos was listed by &quot;Newsweek&quot; as being one of the &quot;greediest people of all time&quot;. To this, Marcos replied: &quot;I plead guilty. For me, greedy is giving. I was first lady for 20 years, you have to be greedy first to give to all. It is natural. The only things we keep in life are those we give away.&quot;

== Edifice complex ==

The term &quot;edifice complex&quot; has been applied to Imelda and her penchant for grandiose public buildings, often constructed in impossibly short order. Imelda&#x27;s building projects were often of the Brutalist architectural style characterized by fortress-like, massive shapes intended to effect a sense of grandiosity.

In 1966, Ferdinand Marcos issued Executive Order No. 60, establishing the Cultural Center of the Philippines and appointing its board of directors. The board elected Imelda as their chairperson, giving her the legal mandate to negotiate and manage funds for the center.

The Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) Complex is considered the premier symbol of Imelda&#x27;s edifice complex. It was designed by architect Leandro Locsin and was built on a reclaimed land along Roxas Boulevard in Manila and covered an area of about . Ninety thousand pesos was granted by the Philippine-American Culture Foundation for its construction and was aided with funds from the Cultural Development Fund and the Special Fund for Education. Upon completion, it amounted to —a 50 000% increase from the original budget. Although it is notable that prices of the construction materials such as cement, steel, and tiles increased by 30% to 40% within this time frame, the escalation in the increase of the expenditures are highly questionable. Imelda called the CCP Complex the &quot;sanctuary of the Filipino soul,&quot; as it became the locus of all state-initiated cultural productions.

Another construction project linked with Imelda during her husband&#x27;s first term as President is the San Juanico Bridge, which links the island of Samar to Imelda&#x27;s home province, Leyte. Although it wasn&#x27;t initiated by Imelda herself, it was promoted by the administration as Ferdinand Marcos&#x27;s gift to his wife. It was funded with foreign loans of (about ), from Japan&#x27;s Overseas Technical Cooperation Agency (OTCA), the predecessor of today&#x27;s Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Upon its completion on July 2, 1973, Imelda&#x27;s birthday, economists and public works engineers quickly tagged it as a white elephant which was &quot;constructed several decades too soon,&quot; because its average daily traffic (ADT) was too low to justify the cost of its construction.

== Cultural influence ==
=== &quot;Imeldific&quot; ===
In the late 1980s, the revelation that Imelda Marcos had &quot;amassed a huge collection of art, jewellery, property and – most famously – at least 1,000 pairs of shoes&quot;, had turned her into a household name, frequently compared to Marie Antoinette of France, except &quot;with shoes&quot;.

This led to the coining of the Philippine English adjective &quot;Imeldific&quot;, to describe 

It also refers to people who have &quot;the Imelda Marcos syndrome&quot; – tending to be extravagant and not being afraid to flaunt it, or to describe a lifestyle of &quot;ostentatious extravagance&quot;.

It has also come to be used in International English, with dictionary writer and &quot;Atlantic&quot; columnist Anne Soukhanov expounding on the &quot;ostentatious extravagance&quot; etymology. In popular international media, the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;&#x27;s Jackie Dent said it simply &quot;means to be ... well, like Imelda&quot;.

The coining of the term is often attributed to Imelda Marcos, although it was used by &quot;People&quot; Magazine&#x27;s Carlos Lopez as early as April 1986, when he said: 

=== Fashion ===
Marcos influenced fashion in the Philippines, although her role as a patroness of the arts and fashion is still controversial. For instance, she actively promoted the &quot;terno&quot;, which also became her sartorial symbol, through projects such as &quot;Bagong Anyo&quot; and exhibitions abroad such as the Philippine contribution to the Expo &#x27;75 in Okinawa Japan.

Imelda made a conscious effort to portray herself as a patron of the arts, including those who specialize in Filipino haute couture such as Pitoy Moreno and Inno Sotto.

In a section of the 2003 Ramona Diaz film named after her, Imelda says that she maintains her extravagant clothing because it &quot;inspired the poor to dress better&quot;.

===Portrayals in news and art===
In August 2019, writer/director Lauren Greenfield debuted her documentary film &quot;The Kingmaker&quot; at the 76th Venice Film Festival, after which it premiered at the Telluride Film Festival, the Toronto International Film Festival, and the London Film Festival, the first documentary to ever debut at all four festivals in the same year. The documentary features the political career of Imelda Marcos with a focus on the Marcos family&#x27;s efforts to rehabilitate the family&#x27;s image and to return to political power – including her plans to see her son Bongbong become Vice President of the Philippines. It has a 97% fresh rating from Rotten Tomatoes and a 76/100 from Metacritic.

In the late 1990s, Imelda Marcos agreed to be the subject of a television documentary episode for PBS&#x27;s Independent Lens, simply titled &quot;Imelda&quot;, by Ramona S. Diaz. Released in 2003, the film documents her marriage to future President of the Philippines Ferdinand Marcos, her rule under the dictatorship, her exile in Hawaii and her eventual return to the Philippines. &quot;Imelda&quot; had its world premiere at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam and its North American premiere in the documentary competition of the 2004 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Excellence in Cinematography Award Documentary. The film was also screened at the Maryland Film Festival in Baltimore. It has a 94% fresh rating from Rotten Tomatoes and a 69/100 from Metacritic. Imelda Marcos obtained a temporary injunction that prevented the film from being shown in the Philippines for a brief time. When the injunction was canceled and the film was released, it earned more than &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; and was considered a hit.

The villain character &quot;Madame&quot; in the popular Filipino Comic Book series Trese is known for being a visual reference to Marcos, with her coiffed hair, butterfly sleeves, and deep connections to the powerful figures of the Trese universe.

The second track of Mark Knopfler&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Golden Heart&quot; is a sardonic song about her. In 2010, British producer Fatboy Slim and musician David Byrne released a concept album about her life called &quot;Here Lies Love&quot;, which later became a rock musical of the same name.

In Manila, local performance artist Carlos Celdran became known for his &quot;Living La Vida Imelda&quot; walking tour, which was also performed in Dubai in 2012. Filipino-American drag artist Manila Luzon impersonated Mrs. Marcos in the &quot;Snatch Game&quot; challenge in the third season of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race,&quot; deriving humor from the First Lady&#x27;s renowned obsession with shoes. Hawaiian comedian Frank De Lima has impersonated her on various occasions.

In an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (aired October 8, 1988), she was portrayed by comedienne Nora Dunn during the segment &quot;Weekend Update&quot;. She was also portrayed by Clavel Bendaña on the 2003 film &quot;Chavit (film)&quot;.

She is also portrayed by actress Dimples Romana Marcos on the &quot;Maalaala Mo Kaya&quot; episode entitled &quot;Makinilya&quot;, the second of the two-part &quot;The Ninoy &amp; Cory Aquino Story&quot; aired on ABS-CBN in 2010. Actress Ruffa Gutierrez also portrayed her in the 2022 film &quot;Maid in Malacañang&quot; and its sequel, the 2023 film &quot;Martyr or Murderer&quot;; actress Cindy Miranda portrays the young Marcos in the latter.

She is frequently mentioned in the following Netflix shows like &quot;Russian Doll&quot; (episode: &quot;Coney Island Baby&quot;), &quot;The Crown&quot; (episode: &quot;Fairytale&quot;) and &quot;Dynasty&quot; (episode: &quot;A Litte Father-Daughter Chat&quot;).

An original musical, &quot;Here Lies Love&quot;, by David Byrne and Fatboy Slim, spans her life from childhood to exile and utilizes largely disco and club music and innovative immersive staging. The title is a direct reference to a phrase Imelda mentioned she wanted written on her tombstone. Originally conceived as a song cycle, it was presented in concert (Adelaide 2006, Carnegie Hall 2007) format and presented at Mass MoCA (2012) and Off-Broadway (2013, 2014–15) at the Public Theatre. The Broadway transfer began previews at the Broadway Theatre on June 17, 2023, with opening night on July 20, 2023 and closed in the same year on November 26.

<doc id="294936" wikidata="Q862569" url="?curid=294936" title="Sukiyaki">
<text>is a Japanese dish that is prepared and served in the &quot;nabemono&quot; (Japanese hot pot) style.

It consists of meat (usually thinly sliced beef) which is slowly cooked or simmered at the table, alongside vegetables and other ingredients, in a shallow iron pot in a mixture of soy sauce, sugar, and mirin. The ingredients are usually dipped in a small bowl of raw, beaten eggs after being cooked in the pot, and then eaten.

Generally sukiyaki is a winter dish and it is commonly found at &quot;bōnenkai&quot;, Japanese year-end parties.

==Ingredients==

Thinly sliced beef is usually used for sukiyaki, although in the past, in certain parts of the country (notably Hokkaidō and Niigata) pork was also popular.

Popular ingredients cooked with the beef are:
*Tofu (usually seared firm tofu).
*&quot;Negi&quot; (a type of scallion).
*Leafy vegetables, such as Chinese cabbage and shungiku (garland chrysanthemum leaves).
*Mushrooms, such as shiitake and enokitake.
*Glass noodles made out of konnyaku or corm, such as ito konnyaku, or shirataki noodles.

Boiled wheat udon or mochi (rice-cakes) are sometimes added, usually at the end to soak up the broth.

==Preparation==

Sukiyaki is a one-pot dish (&quot;nabemono&quot;) that was developed during the Meiji era. Different regions have different ways of preparing sukiyaki. There are two main styles, the Kanto style from eastern Japan and Kansai style from western Japan.

In the Kanto style, warishita (a mixture of sake, soy sauce, sugar, mirin and dashi) is poured and heated in a pot, then meat, vegetables and other ingredients are added and simmered together. In Kansai-style sukiyaki, meat is heated in the pot first. When the meat is almost cooked, sugar, sake and soy sauce are added, then vegetables and other ingredients are added last.

The vegetables and meat used are different between the two styles. Because beef was expensive in the past, the use of pork was common in northern and eastern regions. Other ingredients added to modern sukiyaki include chicken (&quot;tori-suki&quot;), fish (&quot;uo-suki&quot; or &quot;oki-suki&quot;), udon noodles (&quot;udon-suki&quot;), negi, shiitake mushrooms, shirataki and slightly grilled tofu. In both styles, raw eggs are used as a dipping sauce and steamed rice with black sesame seeds is served.

== Etymology ==

One theory for the origin of the name is that it derives from the words , which means spade, and , which is the verb &quot;to grill&quot;. During the Edo period (1603–1868), farmers used suki to cook things like fish and tofu. However, sukiyaki became a traditional Japanese dish during the Meiji era (1868–1912). Another theory is that the name comes from the word , which means &quot;thinly sliced meat&quot;. 

==History==

Buddhism was introduced to Japan during the Asuka period. At that time, killing animals was against Buddhist law. Also eating beef was prohibited since cattle were considered work animals. However, people could eat meat under some special circumstances, such as when they were sick, or at special events, like bōnenkai, the year-end drinking party. During the Edo period, eating game, such as boar and duck, was common and not forbidden. In the 1860s, when Japan opened its ports to foreign merchants, foreigners who came to Japan introduced the culture of eating meat and new cooking styles. Cows, milk, meat, and eggs became widely used, and sukiyaki was a popular way to serve them. At first, cattle were imported from neighboring countries like Korea and China as the demand for beef increased. Sukiyaki possibly originated and became popular in the Kansai region. Following the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, many beef restaurants in Tokyo were closed and many people in Kantō temporarily moved to the Osaka area. While the people of Kantō were in Osaka, they got accustomed to the Kansai style of sukiyaki, and when they returned to Kantō, they introduced the Kansai sukiyaki style, where it has since become popular. Beef is the primary ingredient in today&#x27;s sukiyaki.

Sukiyaki became prominent in U.S. Japanese restaurants by the 1930s. In 1959, food writer for the &quot;New York Times&quot; Craig Claiborne wrote that the dish was among the four most requested recipes the newspaper had received over the previous year. It was among the four most requested recipes to the New York Times In 1978 W.L. Taitte stated in &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; that sukiyaki was &quot;the most famous but hardly the most characteristic Japanese dish.&quot; By the 1980s, in the U.S., sukiyaki was becoming obscure as sushi became more prominent.

==Trivia==

The 1961 song &quot;Ue wo Muite Arukō&quot; was given the alternative title &quot;Sukiyaki&quot; so that it could be short and recognizably Japanese in English-speaking countries. Despite the title, the lyrics have no connection to sukiyaki.

Swedish comedian and singer Povel Ramel wrote a song, the &quot;Sukiyaki Syndrome&quot;, wherein the restaurant customer wants sukiyaki. There are a number of variations, each with a description so long that by the time he orders any of them, the restaurant has run out.

==Related dishes==
*Shabu-shabu is similar, but whereas sukiyaki is considered sweeter, shabu-shabu is more savory. Shabu-shabu meat is even more thinly sliced and the individual slices of meat are cooked by dipping them into simmering liquid at the table, while sukiyaki is cooked in a more casserole style.
*Sukiyaki in Laos takes the form of a bowl of bean thread noodles, various vegetables, thinly sliced beef and other meats or seafood, sukiyaki sauce, and a raw egg in beef broth. The sukiyaki sauce is made from coconut, fermented tofu, tahini, peanut butter, sugar, garlic, lime, and spices. 
*Thai suki or &quot;Thai sukiyaki&quot; is a very popular hot pot dish in Thailand and, increasingly, neighboring countries. Despite the name, it bears only a vague resemblance to Japanese sukiyaki.

<doc id="294943" wikidata="Q191907" url="?curid=294943" title="Carotenoid">
<text>Carotenoids () are yellow, orange, and red organic pigments that are produced by plants and algae, as well as several bacteria, archaea, and fungi. Carotenoids give the characteristic color to pumpkins, carrots, parsnips, corn, tomatoes, canaries, flamingos, salmon, lobster, shrimp, and daffodils. Over 1,100 identified carotenoids can be further categorized into two classes xanthophylls (which contain oxygen) and carotenes (which are purely hydrocarbons and contain no oxygen).

All are derivatives of tetraterpenes, meaning that they are produced from 8 isoprene units and contain 40 carbon atoms. In general, carotenoids absorb wavelengths ranging from 400 to 550 nanometers (violet to green light). This causes the compounds to be deeply colored yellow, orange, or red. Carotenoids are the dominant pigment in autumn leaf coloration of about 15-30% of tree species, but many plant colors, especially reds and purples, are due to polyphenols.
Carotenoids serve two key roles in plants and algae: they absorb light energy for use in photosynthesis, and they provide photoprotection via non-photochemical quenching. Carotenoids that contain unsubstituted beta-ionone rings (including β-carotene, α-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, and γ-carotene) have vitamin A activity (meaning that they can be converted to retinol). In the eye, lutein, &quot;meso&quot;-zeaxanthin, and zeaxanthin are present as macular pigments whose importance in visual function, as of 2016, remains under clinical research.

== Structure and function ==


Carotenoids are produced by all photosynthetic organisms and are primarily used as accessory pigments to chlorophyll in the light-harvesting part of photosynthesis.

They are highly unsaturated with conjugated double bonds, which enables carotenoids to absorb light of various wavelengths. At the same time, the terminal groups regulate the polarity and properties within lipid membranes.

Most carotenoids are tetraterpenoids, regular &lt;chem&gt;C40&lt;/chem&gt; isoprenoids. Several modifications to these structures exist: including cyclization, varying degrees of saturation or unsaturation, and other functional groups. Carotenes typically contain only carbon and hydrogen, i.e., they are hydrocarbons. Prominent members include α-carotene, β-carotene, and lycopene, are known as &quot;carotenes&quot;. Carotenoids containing oxygen include lutein and zeaxanthin. They are known as &quot;xanthophylls&quot;. Their color, ranging from pale yellow through bright orange to deep red, is directly related to their structure, especially the length of the conjugation. Xanthophylls are often yellow, giving their class name.

Carotenoids also participate in different types of cell signaling. They are able to signal the production of abscisic acid, which regulates plant growth, seed dormancy, embryo maturation and germination, cell division and elongation, floral growth, and stress responses.

===Photophysics===
The length of the multiple conjugated double bonds determines their color and photophysics. After absorbing a photon, the carotenoid transfers its excited electron to chlorophyll for use in photosynthesis. Upon absorption of light, carotenoids transfer excitation energy to and from chlorophyll. The singlet-singlet energy transfer is a lower energy state transfer and is used during photosynthesis. The triplet-triplet transfer is a higher energy state and is essential in photoprotection. Light produces damaging species during photosynthesis, with the most damaging being reactive oxygen species (ROS). As these high energy ROS are produced in the chlorophyll the energy is transferred to the carotenoid’s polyene tail and undergoes a series of reactions in which electrons are moved between the carotenoid bonds in order to find the most balanced (lowest energy) state for the carotenoid.

Carotenoids defend plants against singlet oxygen, by both energy transfer and by chemical reactions. They also protect plants by quenching triplet chlorophyll. By protecting lipids from free-radical damage, which generate charged lipid peroxides and other oxidised derivatives, carotenoids support crystalline architecture and hydrophobicity of lipoproteins and cellular lipid structures, hence oxygen solubility and its diffusion therein.

===Structure-property relationships===
Like some fatty acids, carotenoids are lipophilic due to the presence of long unsaturated aliphatic chains. As a consequence, carotenoids are typically present in plasma lipoproteins and cellular lipid structures.

== Morphology ==
Carotenoids are located primarily outside the cell nucleus in different cytoplasm organelles, lipid droplets, cytosomes and granules. They have been visualised and quantified by raman spectroscopy in an algal cell.

With the development of monoclonal antibodies to &quot;trans-&quot;lycopene it was possible to localise this carotenoid in different animal and human cells.
==Foods==
Beta-carotene, found in pumpkins, sweet potato, carrots and winter squash, is responsible for their orange-yellow colors. Dried carrots have the highest amount of carotene of any food per 100-gram serving, measured in retinol activity equivalents (provitamin A equivalents). Vietnamese gac fruit contains the highest known concentration of the carotenoid lycopene. Although green, kale, spinach, collard greens, and turnip greens contain substantial amounts of beta-carotene. The diet of flamingos is rich in carotenoids, imparting the orange-colored feathers of these birds.

Reviews of preliminary research in 2015 indicated that foods high in carotenoids may reduce the risk of head and neck cancers and prostate cancer. There is no correlation between consumption of foods high in carotenoids and vitamin A and the risk of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Humans and other animals are mostly incapable of synthesizing carotenoids, and must obtain them through their diet. Carotenoids are a common and often ornamental feature in animals. For example, the pink color of salmon, and the red coloring of cooked lobsters and scales of the yellow morph of common wall lizards are due to carotenoids. It has been proposed that carotenoids are used in ornamental traits (for extreme examples see puffin birds) because, given their physiological and chemical properties, they can be used as visible indicators of individual health, and hence are used by animals when selecting potential mates.

Carotenoids from the diet are stored in the fatty tissues of animals, and exclusively carnivorous animals obtain the compounds from animal fat. In the human diet, absorption of carotenoids is improved when consumed with fat in a meal. Cooking carotenoid-containing vegetables in oil and shredding the vegetable both increase carotenoid bioavailability.

== Plant colors ==

The most common carotenoids include lycopene and the vitamin A precursor β-carotene. In plants, the xanthophyll lutein is the most abundant carotenoid and its role in preventing age-related eye disease is currently under investigation. Lutein and the other carotenoid pigments found in mature leaves are often not obvious because of the masking presence of chlorophyll. When chlorophyll is not present, as in autumn foliage, the yellows and oranges of the carotenoids are predominant. For the same reason, carotenoid colors often predominate in ripe fruit after being unmasked by the disappearance of chlorophyll.

Carotenoids are responsible for the brilliant yellows and oranges that tint deciduous foliage (such as dying autumn leaves) of certain hardwood species as hickories, ash, maple, yellow poplar, aspen, birch, black cherry, sycamore, cottonwood, sassafras, and alder. Carotenoids are the dominant pigment in autumn leaf coloration of about 15-30% of tree species. However, the reds, the purples, and their blended combinations that decorate autumn foliage usually come from another group of pigments in the cells called anthocyanins. Unlike the carotenoids, these pigments are not present in the leaf throughout the growing season, but are actively produced towards the end of summer.

== Bird colors and sexual selection ==
Dietary carotenoids and their metabolic derivatives are responsible for bright yellow to red coloration in birds. Studies estimate that around 2956 modern bird species display carotenoid coloration and that the ability to utilize these pigments for external coloration has evolved independently many times throughout avian evolutionary history. Carotenoid coloration exhibits high levels of sexual dimorphism, with adult male birds generally displaying more vibrant coloration than females of the same species.

These differences arise due to the selection of yellow and red coloration in males by female preference. In many species of birds, females invest greater time and resources into raising offspring than their male partners. Therefore, it is imperative that female birds carefully select high quality mates. Current literature supports the theory that vibrant carotenoid coloration is correlated with male quality—either though direct effects on immune function and oxidative stress, or through a connection between carotenoid metabolizing pathways and pathways for cellular respiration.

It is generally considered that sexually selected traits, such as carotenoid-based coloration, evolve because they are honest signals of phenotypic and genetic quality. For instance, among males of the bird species &quot;Parus major&quot;, the more colorfully ornamented males produce sperm that is better protected against oxidative stress due to increased presence of carotenoid antioxidants. However, there is also evidence that attractive male coloration may be a faulty signal of male quality. Among stickleback fish, males that are more attractive to females due to carotenoid colorants appear to under-allocate carotenoids to their germline cells. Since carotinoids are beneficial antioxidants, their under-allocation to germline cells can lead to increased oxidative DNA damage to these cells. Therefore, female sticklebacks may risk fertility and the viability of their offspring by choosing redder, but more deteriorated partners with reduced sperm quality.

==Aroma chemicals==
Products of carotenoid degradation such as ionones, damascones and damascenones are also important fragrance chemicals that are used extensively in the perfumes and fragrance industry. Both β-damascenone and β-ionone although low in concentration in rose distillates are the key odor-contributing compounds in flowers. In fact, the sweet floral smells present in black tea, aged tobacco, grape, and many fruits are due to the aromatic compounds resulting from carotenoid breakdown.

==Disease==
Some carotenoids are produced by bacteria to protect themselves from oxidative immune attack. The &quot;aureus&quot; (golden) pigment that gives some strains of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; their name is a carotenoid called staphyloxanthin. This carotenoid is a virulence factor with an antioxidant action that helps the microbe evade death by reactive oxygen species used by the host immune system.

== Biosynthesis ==
The basic building blocks of carotenoids are isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). These two isoprene isomers are used to create various compounds depending on the biological pathway used to synthesize the isomers. Plants are known to use two different pathways for IPP production: the cytosolic mevalonic acid pathway (MVA) and the plastidic methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP). In animals, the production of cholesterol starts by creating IPP and DMAPP using the MVA. For carotenoid production plants use MEP to generate IPP and DMAPP. The MEP pathway results in a 5:1 mixture of IPP:DMAPP. IPP and DMAPP undergo several reactions, resulting in the major carotenoid precursor, geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). GGPP can be converted into carotenes or xanthophylls by undergoing a number of different steps within the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway.

=== MEP pathway ===
Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and pyruvate, intermediates of photosynthesis, are converted to deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) catalyzed by DXP synthase (DXS). DXP reductoisomerase catalyzes the reduction by NADPH and subsequent rearrangement. The resulting MEP is converted to 4-(cytidine 5’-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol (CDP-ME) in the presence of CTP using the enzyme MEP cytidylyltransferase. CDP-ME is then converted, in the presence of ATP, to 2-phospho-4-(cytidine 5’-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol (CDP-ME2P). The conversion to CDP-ME2P is catalyzed by CDP-ME kinase. Next, CDP-ME2P is converted to 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate (MECDP). This reaction occurs when MECDP synthase catalyzes the reaction and CMP is eliminated from the CDP-ME2P molecule. MECDP is then converted to (e)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate (HMBDP) via HMBDP synthase in the presence of flavodoxin and NADPH. HMBDP is reduced to IPP in the presence of ferredoxin and NADPH by the enzyme HMBDP reductase. The last two steps involving HMBPD synthase and reductase can only occur in completely anaerobic environments. IPP is then able to isomerize to DMAPP via IPP isomerase.

=== Carotenoid biosynthetic pathway ===

Two GGPP molecules condense via phytoene synthase (PSY), forming the 15-cis isomer of phytoene. PSY belongs to the squalene/phytoene synthase family and is homologous to squalene synthase that takes part in steroid biosynthesis. The subsequent conversion of phytoene into all-trans-lycopene depends on the organism. Bacteria and fungi employ a single enzyme, the bacterial phytoene desaturase (CRTI) for the catalysis. Plants and cyanobacteria however utilize four enzymes for this process. The first of these enzymes is a plant-type phytoene desaturase which introduces two additional double bonds into 15-cis-phytoene by dehydrogenation and isomerizes two of its existing double bonds from trans to cis producing 9,15,9’-tri-cis-ζ-carotene. The central double bond of this tri-cis-ζ-carotene is isomerized by the zeta-carotene isomerase Z-ISO and the resulting 9,9&#x27;-di-cis-ζ-carotene is dehydrogenated again via a ζ-carotene desaturase (ZDS). This again introduces two double bonds, resulting in 7,9,7’,9’-tetra-cis-lycopene. CRTISO, a carotenoid isomerase, is needed to convert the cis-lycopene into an all-trans lycopene in the presence of reduced FAD.

This all-trans lycopene is cyclized; cyclization gives rise to carotenoid diversity, which can be distinguished based on the end groups. There can be either a beta ring or an epsilon ring, each generated by a different enzyme (lycopene beta-cyclase [beta-LCY] or lycopene epsilon-cyclase [epsilon-LCY]). α-Carotene is produced when the all-trans lycopene first undergoes reaction with epsilon-LCY then a second reaction with beta-LCY; whereas β-carotene is produced by two reactions with beta-LCY. α- and β-Carotene are the most common carotenoids in the plant photosystems but they can still be further converted into xanthophylls by using beta-hydrolase and epsilon-hydrolase, leading to a variety of xanthophylls.

=== Regulation ===
It is believed that both DXS and DXR are rate-determining enzymes, allowing them to regulate carotenoid levels. This was discovered in an experiment where DXS and DXR were genetically overexpressed, leading to increased carotenoid expression in the resulting seedlings. Also, J-protein (J20) and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) chaperones are thought to be involved in post-transcriptional regulation of DXS activity, such that mutants with defective J20 activity exhibit reduced DXS enzyme activity while accumulating inactive DXS protein. Regulation may also be caused by external toxins that affect enzymes and proteins required for synthesis. Ketoclomazone is derived from herbicides applied to soil and binds to DXP synthase. This inhibits DXP synthase, preventing synthesis of DXP and halting the MEP pathway. The use of this toxin leads to lower levels of carotenoids in plants grown in the contaminated soil. Fosmidomycin, an antibiotic, is a competitive inhibitor of DXP reductoisomerase due to its similar structure to the enzyme. Application of said antibiotic prevents reduction of DXP, again halting the MEP pathway.

<doc id="294944" wikidata="Q1025454" url="?curid=294944" title="Jackson–Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport">
<text>Jackson–Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport is a city-owned civil-military airport located in Jackson, Mississippi, United States, approximately east of Downtown Jackson across the Pearl River. It is located in Rankin County between the suburbs of Flowood and Pearl, whereas the majority of the city of Jackson is located in Hinds County.

It serves commercial, private, and military aviation. It is named after Medgar Evers, the assassinated Mississippi Field Secretary for the NAACP during much of the Civil rights movement, and is administered by the Jackson Municipal Airport Authority (JMAA), which also oversees aviation activity at Hawkins Field (HKS) in northwest Jackson.

In March 2011, the Jackson–Evers International Airport was ranked the 8th-best airport in a worldwide consumer survey conducted by Airports Council International (ACI). It was the only airport in the United States to be ranked in the top ten.

==History==
Groundbreaking for the new airport occurred on August 17, 1959, beginning construction that was expected to take two years. The expansion was expected to cost $6 million (). At the opening ceremony, mayor Allen C. Thompson got a laugh when he thanked the people who had anything to do with the airport in the past, and &quot;the taxpayers who are going to pay for it&quot; in the future. The airport opened in 1963, a new airport to replace Hawkins Field, Jackson&#x27;s airport since 1928. Delta Air Lines&#x27;s first flight, from Dallas Love Field, landed at Hawkins Field in 1929. The new airport was named Allen C. Thompson Field (after the Mayor of Jackson at the time, who was instrumental in obtaining the land for the airfield), which remains the name for the land on which the airport is built. The airport was &quot;Jackson Municipal Airport&quot;.

Following a decision by the Jackson City Council in December 2004, the airport name was changed to Jackson–Evers International Airport on January 22, 2005.

===Past air service===

The first jets scheduled to Jackson were Delta Convair 880s in late 1963, Newark-Birmingham-Jackson-Shreveport-Dallas and back.

In 1973 Delta Boeing 727s flew nonstop to Atlanta, Birmingham, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Monroe (LA), Montgomery (AL), Memphis, Meridian (MS), New Orleans, and Shreveport, which continued for some time afterward. In the mid-1980s, Delta 727s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9s flew nonstop to Atlanta, Dallas/Ft Worth, Memphis, Mobile, Monroe, and Shreveport. In October 1991 Delta had nonstop 727s, DC-9s and McDonnell Douglas MD-88s to its hubs in Atlanta, Cincinnati, and Dallas/Ft Worth, in addition to Baton Rouge, Birmingham, Monroe, and Shreveport. Delta reduced its flights in the 1990s and 2000s; in 2013 it flew only to Atlanta from Jackson.

In the 1960s Southern Airways Martin 404s connected Jackson with Natchez, Vicksburg, Greenwood, Columbus, Laurel, and New Orleans, but in the next decade Southern replaced these with DC-9s. In the 1970s Southern flew to Memphis, Atlanta, Greenville, Mississippi and Mobile, but after it merged with North Central Airlines in 1979 to form Republic Airlines it flew only to Memphis and left completely by 1984. In the 1970s Jackson had direct Convair 600s to Houston–Intercontinental, Alexandria, Louisiana, and Baton Rouge on Texas International Airlines.

In 1979 Frontier Airlines flew Boeing 737s direct to Little Rock, with connections to Denver and the rest of the airline&#x27;s network. Royale Airlines flew Gulfstream turboprops to Natchez and New Orleans. Between 1984 and 1986, Eastern Airlines had nonstop 727s to Atlanta and New Orleans; United Airlines flew 737s to Memphis, a route later taken over by Northwest with Saab 340s; Northwest also started direct turboprops to Laurel/Hattiesburg and later started Jackson–New Orleans. A Continental Airlines affiliate began turboprop flights to Houston–Intercontinental, which continued through June 2013 (now part of United, using regional jets). In 1981 American Airlines began direct flights to Dallas/Ft. Worth, Mobile, and later Nashville, using MD-83s and Boeing 727s.

In the early 1990s the airport&#x27;s name became &quot;Jackson International Airport&quot; since it has facilities for international flights (of which it has none scheduled). It has an office for U.S. Customs to service international arrivals and has established a Foreign Trade Zone. The airport saw US Airways as a new carrier during this time, gaining nonstop service to Charlotte and for a time, to New Orleans. Trans World Airlines began Trans World Express service to St. Louis in 1995; this ended the next year. TWA had DC-9, often DC-9-10, service to STL in 1996. Low-cost Valujet began DC-9 flights from Jackson to Atlanta in 1994, lasting for two years before it filed for bankruptcy and became AirTran Airways in 1997. The mid-1990s saw a tightening in the airline industry of the hub-and-spoke system, and many destinations from Jackson were eliminated. American downgraded service in 1995 from Jackson to American Eagle service only to Dallas/Ft. Worth and Nashville, and later only to DFW, and by 2004 Delta provided service only to Atlanta and Cincinnati, the latter only through subsidiary Comair.

In 1997 Southwest Airlines began service to Jackson from Baltimore, Chicago–Midway, Houston–Hobby and Orlando; Southwest flew its last flight from Jackson on June 7, 2014. On October 22, 2020, Southwest Airlines announced that it would be returning to Jackson in the first half of 2021.

===Recent air service===
In 2013, the airport saw 7,520 commercial aircraft (about 20 commercial aircraft per day) and 53,096 aircraft overall.

In 2006, the airport authority received a federal grant (Small Community Air Service Development) to recruit non-stop flight service to Newark, in the New York City area. Continental Airlines flights from Jackson to Newark began on September 25, 2007; the route ended in summer 2008. American Airlines non-stop service between Chicago–O&#x27;Hare and Jackson–Evers recently ended, though the route was resumed by United Airlines in December 2020.

In late 2018, Frontier Airlines started non-stop seasonal service to Orlando International Airport and Denver International Airport. They are the only airline to schedule the Airbus A320 family to Jackson.

The 172d Airlift Wing (172 AW) of the Mississippi Air National Guard has maintained an Air National Guard base on the airport since 1963, when it moved from Hawkins Field. The 172 AW previously operated the C-119 Flying Boxcar, C-124 Globemaster, C-130 Hercules, C-141 Starlifter and now flies the C-17 Globemaster III.

==Airport operations==
Previously, the city of Jackson, like other Mississippi cities, had control of the airport through the Jackson Municipal Airport Authority, controlled by a board with five people. Governor of Mississippi Phil Bryant signed Senate Bill 2162 into law in 2016 to give control to a new board of nine people with two appointed by the city government. The Jackson airport board sued on the basis of racial discrimination as the city is majority black; the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the Jackson board in August 2019. People supporting the takeover argued that the municipalities next to the airport should have power over its governance.

==Facilities==
The airport is within a non-contiguous portion of the Jackson city limits, and in Rankin County.
The airport has an L-shaped terminal, with the ramp extending north. The west concourse, with gates 15–19, extends nearly straight from the central part of the terminal with ticket counters, while the east concourse (gates 1–4) extends north at the other end of the terminal building. In the 1980s, United Airlines operated flights from gate 6, almost directly behind the ticket counters; however, when the airport was renovated in the early 1990s, gate 6 was converted into an observation deck.

The Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame museum is located at the airport.

The airport covers at an elevation of . It has two runways, 16L/34R and 16R/34L, each asphalt.

Five new jetways were installed in February 2011: two on the east Concourse (gates 3 and 4) and three on the west Concourse (gates 15, 17, and 19). Recent improvements include a new covered garage for long-term parking.

<doc id="294945" wikidata="Q2672059" url="?curid=294945" title="Ṛtusaṃhāra">
<text>Ṛtusaṃhāra, often written Ritusamhara, (Devanagari: ऋतुसंहार; ऋतु , &quot;season&quot;; संहार , &quot;compilation&quot;) is a medium length Sanskrit poem. 

While the poem is often attributed to Kalidasa, modern scholars disagree with this traditional attribution. According to Siegfried Lienhard &quot;the &quot;Ṛtusaṃhāra&quot; is almost certainly the work of some poet whose name has not come down to us and was probably written sometime between Asvaghosa (about 100 A.D.) and Kalidasa (4th to 5th century).&quot; 

The poem has six cantos for the six Indian seasons- (summer), (monsoon/rains), (autumn), (cool), (winter), and (spring).

The word Ritu (seasons) with the word saṃhāra is used here in the sense of &quot;coming together&quot; or &quot;group&quot;. Thus, Ritusamhara has been translated as &quot;Medley of Seasons&quot; or &quot;Garland of Seasons&quot;, perhaps more aptly as the &quot;Pageant of the Seasons&quot;, but also mistranslated as &quot;birth and death&quot; of seasons, which arises from the alternate meaning of &quot;samhāra&quot; as &quot;destruction&quot;.

The evocative poetry is in the popular Anustubh Chanda form of four line stanzas- a total of 144 stanzas. Collated by William Jones, this was the first Sanskrit text to be printed and published in Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1792. The changing seasons are portrayed in acute details using the thematic backdrop of how lovers react differently to the changing landscapes- the two themes beautifully accentuating each other. This imbues the poem with distinctly amorous taste (shringara) rasa. The predominant emphasis on a single rasa has been criticized by some, however it showcases the latent virtuosity of the neophyte poet, as he explores the range of flavors (Svad) within the single rasa rasa- an exuberant exposition of joie de vivre, conveyed through the interplay of changing nature and steady romance.

Sometimes his authorship has been challenged on the grounds of weak poetic imagination. As an example, here is verse 1.4 of Grishma, where the lovers are struggling against the heat: 
: To relieve their lovers of heat,
: Women make them lie
: On their girdled, round hips covered with silken robes, or
: On their sandal anointed breasts
: Heavy with ornaments.
: They seek help from fragrant flowers
: Set in coiffures after a bath,
: To intoxicate and delight their lovers.
Of these verses (4-9 of &quot;Grishma&quot; canto) the Mysore scholar K. Krishnamurthy says: 
: The sensuality and cloying love depicted in these verses is such that it cannot bring fame to any poet.
However, others have cited the primacy of &quot;shringara rasa&quot; (considered as a primeval source for other rasas), and also the balance the poet seeks to achieve by setting the lovers against the background of nature, as redeeming features of the work.

Simple evocations of changing seasons intersperse the more colorful ones:

: The summer scorched forest is thrilled with joy at the touch of new showers,
: A new pleasure sprouts on the Kadamba trees,
: and every branch shakes in a gaiety unexplained.
: Every flower of Ketaki is blossomed
: as if the forest has laughed. 
: And peacocks dance with a precipitate joy. (Canto 2)
: Cooled by the touch of fresh drops of water,
: And perfumed by the flower laden fragrant Lasak trees
: Aye! scented sweet by the Ketaki pollen,
: the pleasing wind enraptures the lovelorn women. (Canto 2)
Old Sanskrit texts&#x27; commentators like Mallinatha of 15th century ignored this work, along with dozens of other commentators. This has contributed to the doubts about the authorship of this work. But scholars like Keith argue that excepts from this work are quoted in several Sanskrit anthologies, hence it must be that commentators like Mallinatha didn&#x27;t like simple works. Academics like V.V. Mirashi and N.R Navlekar conclude that Ritusamharam is indeed Kalidasa&#x27;s work, albeit from his younger days.

==Adaptations==
Playwright and theatre director, Ratan Thiyam, stage his production based on the poem as closing production of 4th Bharat Rang Mahotsav in 2002.

==Translations==
&quot;Ritusamhara&quot; was translated into English by R. S. Pandit, published in 1947.

&quot;Ritusamhara&quot; was translated into Tamil and published in 1950 by T. Sathasiva Iyer.

&quot;Ritusamhara&quot; has been translated into Marathi Poetry by Dhananjay Borkar and published by Varada Prakashan in 2012. It has also been translated to Kannada by Bannanje Govindacharya titled &quot;Rutugala henige&quot;.

&quot;Ritusmahara&quot; has been simultaneously translated into Hindi and English, as well as illustrated by Rangeya Raghav, published by Atmaram and Sons in 1973.

<text>The July 1995 Chicago heat wave led to 739 heat-related deaths in Chicago over a period of five days. Most of the victims of the heat wave were elderly poor residents of the city, who did not have air conditioning, or had air conditioning but could not afford to turn it on, and did not open windows or sleep outside for fear of crime. The heat wave also heavily impacted the wider Midwestern region, with additional deaths in both St. Louis, Missouri and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

== Weather ==

The temperatures soared to record highs in July with the hottest weather occurring from July 12 to July 16. The high of on July 13 was the second warmest July temperature (warmest being set on July 23, 1934) since records began at Chicago Midway International Airport in 1928. Nighttime low temperatures were unusually high — in the upper 70s and lower 80s °F (about 26 °C).

The humidity made a large difference for the heat in this heat wave when compared to the majority of those of the 1930s, 1988, 1976–78 and 1954–56, which were powered by extremely hot, dry, bare soil and/or air masses which had originated in the desert Southwest. Each of the above-mentioned years&#x27; summers did have high-humidity heat waves as well, although 1988 was a possible exception in some areas. Moisture from previous rains and transpiration by plants drove up the humidity to record levels and the moist humid air mass originated over Iowa previous to and during the early stages of the heat wave. Numerous stations in Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois and elsewhere reported record dew point temperatures above with a peak at with an air temperature of making for a heat index reported from at least one station in Wisconsin (Appleton) at 5:00 pm local time on the afternoon of 14 July 1995, a probable record for the Western Hemisphere; this added to the heat to cause heat indices above in Iowa and southern Wisconsin on several days of the heat wave as the sun bore down from a cloudless sky and evaporated even more water seven days in a row. The heat also caused a series of derechos to move around the high pressure, with 4 derechos occurring over 4 consecutive nights. Some areas in Minnesota being hit by 3 over 3 consecutive nights.

A few days after, the heat moved to the east, with temperatures in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania reaching and in Danbury, Connecticut, which is Connecticut&#x27;s highest recorded temperature. North of the border, Toronto, Ontario reached , when coupled with record high humidity from the same airmass resulted in its highest ever humidex value of 50 C (122 F).

Dewpoint records are not as widely kept as those of temperature, however, the dew points during the heat wave were at or near national and continental records.
=== Analysis ===
The heat wave was caused by a large high pressure system that traversed across the midwest United States. This system was consistently producing maximum temperatures in the 90&#x27;s °F (32-38 °C) during the day with minimum temperatures still remaining as high as the 80s °F (27-32 °C) at night, which is abnormal for midwest summer months. The system also brought extremely low wind speeds, along with high humidity. In the MERRA-2 and the ERAI meteorological reanalyses, the system (see figure) moved eastward, becoming indistinguishable by July 18.

== Victims ==
Eric Klinenberg, author of the 2002 book &quot;Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago&quot;, has noted that the map of heat-related deaths in Chicago mirrors the map of poverty. Most of the heat wave victims were the elderly poor living in the heart of the city, who either had no air conditioning, or had air conditioning but could not afford to turn it on. Many older citizens were also hesitant to open windows and doors at night for fear of crime. Elderly women, who may have been more socially engaged, were less vulnerable than elderly men. By contrast, during the heat waves of the 1930s, many residents slept outside in the parks or along the shore of Lake Michigan.

Because of the nature of the disaster, and the slow response of authorities to recognize it, no official &quot;death toll&quot; has been determined. However, figures show that 739 additional people died in that particular week above the usual weekly average. Further epidemiologic analysis showed that Black residents were more likely to die than White residents, and that Hispanic residents had an unusually low death rate due to heat. At the time, many Black residents lived in areas of sub-standard housing and less cohesive neighborhoods, while Hispanic residents at the time lived in places with higher population density, and more social cohesion.

Mortality displacement refers to the deaths that occur during a heat wave that would have occurred anyway in a near future, but which were precipitated by the heat wave itself. In other words, people who are already very ill and close to death (expected to die, for instance, within days or a few weeks) might die sooner than they might have otherwise, because of the impact of the heat wave on their health. However, because their deaths have been hastened by the heat wave, in the months that follow the number of deaths becomes lower than average. This is also called a &quot;harvesting effect&quot;, in which part of the expected (future) mortality shifts forward a few weeks to the period of the heat wave. Initially some public officials suggested that the high death toll during the weeks of the heat wave was due to mortality displacement; an analysis of the data later found that mortality displacement during the heat wave was limited to about 26% of the estimated 692 excess deaths in the period between June 21 and August 10, 1995. Mortality risks affected Black residents disproportionally. Appropriately targeted interventions may have a tangible effect on life expectancy.

In August, the remains of forty-one victims whose bodies had not been claimed were buried in a mass grave in Homewood, Illinois.

== Aggravating factors ==
Impacts in the Chicago urban center were exacerbated by an urban heat island that raised nocturnal temperatures by more than . Urban heat islands are caused by the concentration of buildings and pavement in urban areas, which tend to absorb more heat in the day and radiate more of that heat at night into their immediate surroundings than comparable rural sites. Therefore, built-up areas get hotter and stay hotter.

Other aggravating factors were inadequate warnings, power failures, inadequate ambulance service and hospital facilities, and lack of preparation. City officials did not release a heat emergency warning until the last day of the heat wave. Thus, such emergency measures as Chicago&#x27;s five cooling centers were not fully utilized. The medical system of Chicago was severely taxed as thousands were taken to local hospitals with heat-related problems.

Another powerful factor in the heat wave was that a temperature inversion grew over the city, and air stagnated in this situation. Pollutants and humidity were confined to ground level, and the air was becalmed and devoid of wind. Without wind to stir the air, temperatures grew even hotter than could be expected with just an urban heat island, and without wind there was truly no relief. Without any way to relieve the heat, even the insides of homes became ovens, with indoor temperature exceeding at night. This was especially noticeable in areas which experienced frequent power outages. At Northwestern University just north of Chicago, summer school students lived in dormitories without air conditioning. In order to ease the effects of the heat, some of the students slept at night with water-soaked towels as blankets.

The scale of the human tragedy sparked denial in some quarters, grief and blame elsewhere. From the moment the local medical examiner began to report heat-related mortality figures, political leaders, journalists, and in turn the Chicago public have actively denied the disaster&#x27;s significance. Although so many city residents died that the coroner had to call in seven refrigerated trucks to store the bodies, skepticism about the trauma continues today. In Chicago, people still debate whether the medical examiner exaggerated the numbers and wonder if the crisis was a &quot;media event.&quot; &quot;The American Journal of Public Health&quot; established that the medical examiner&#x27;s numbers actually undercounted the mortality by about 250 since hundreds of bodies were buried before they could be autopsied.

== Environmental racism ==
Various aggravating factors in this context have informed discussions about environmental racism, environmental injustice within a racialized context.

In the context of the 1995 Chicago heat wave, principles of environmental racism have been used to better understand the hugely unequal death rates between various groups in the Chicago population. Out of the 739 heat related deaths attributed to the heat wave, it was found that Black citizens died at a much higher rate than their white peers. Further, this finding was statistically significant beyond the consideration of increased rate of death in impoverished areas.

In 2018, filmmaker Judith Hefland created &quot;Cooked: Survival by Zip Code&quot;, a documentary exploring the unequal death rates observed during the 1995 heat wave. &quot;Cooked&quot; examines the factors that most directly contributed to these unequal death rates, and posits that such a crisis was not a one time catastrophe, but rather a dangerous trend occurring beyond Chicago.

This documentary examined the particularly devastating impact of various aggravating factors on Black communities. Most directly, the lack of adequate warning and failure to utilize pre-existing cooling centers disadvantaged impoverished groups, and caused particularly devastating effects in Chicago&#x27;s poorest areas. Hefland warns that Chicago can serve as a model for the environmental racism present in many American cities.

Urban heat islands still exist throughout the United States and beyond, and impoverished, minority groups still disproportionately occupy these at-risk neighborhoods. With the number of climate disasters increasing five fold over the past 50 years, the risk to these groups increases as well, and social movements calling for environmental justice have grown in turn.

== Statistics ==
Chicago&#x27;s daily low and high temperatures in 1995:
* July 11: 
* July 12: 
* July 13: 
* July 14: 
* July 15: 
* July 16: 
* July 17: 
Statistics about the averaged July monthly average temperatures from 1960–2016 give us a mean of 74 degrees F and a standard deviation of 2.7.

During the week of the heat wave, there were 11% more hospital admissions than average for comparison weeks and 35% more than expected among patients aged 65 years and older. The majority of this excess (59%) were treatments for dehydration, heat stroke, and heat exhaustion.

=== Wet-bulb temperatures ===
Wet-bulb temperatures during the heat wave reached in some places. A wet-bulb temperature of may be fatal to healthy young humans if experienced over six hours or more for children one month of age as well as the elderly 70 and over.

<text>Mobile Regional Airport is a public/military airport west of Mobile, in Mobile County, Alabama, United States. The airport is owned and operated by the Mobile Airport Authority, a self-funded entity that receives no local tax dollars.

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport. Federal Aviation Administration records show the airport had 286,956 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 280,491 in 2009 and 277,232 in 2010.

The airport is home to U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Training Center, Mobile, providing advanced training to U.S. Coast Guard pilots and aircrew in MH-65D Dolphin and MH-60T Jayhawk helicopters, as well as the HC-144A/B Ocean Sentry turboprop aircraft. The Alabama Army National Guard&#x27;s 1st Battalion, 131st Aviation Regiment&#x27;s &quot;B&quot; Company is also located at the airport.

In August 2020 it was announced that the Mobile Airport Authority will shift commercial airline flights to the more convenient Mobile Downtown Airport, now renamed Mobile International Airport.

==History==

===Early years===
Eastern Air Lines served Mobile from the 1930s until 1991; in the 1930s Eastern&#x27;s one flight a day each way between Newark and San Antonio stopped at what is now Mobile International Airport.

===Bates Army Airfield===
During World War II, the United States Army Air Forces used Mobile Regional Airport. The 533d Army Air Force Base Unit commanded the airport, then known as Bates Field. The Army Air Forces also operated an auxiliary airfield at St. Elmo Airport.

The Army used this airport as a basic (level 1) pilot training airfield, under contract to Waterman Airlines. They performed flying training with Fairchild PT-19 aircraft as the primary trainer. The Army also assigned several Boeing-Stearman Model 75 aircraft. The Army also used Bates for glider pilot training under contract to Mobile Area Soaring, which used primarily Douglas C-47 Skytrain and Waco CG-4 unpowered gliders. The school aimed to train student pilots in proficiency in operation of gliders in various types of towed and soaring flight, both day and night, and in servicing of gliders in the field.

In 1944 with the reduced demand for pilots, the Army ended the flying training, and Domestic Transport Division of Air Transport Command used the airport as a transport airfield. Air Transport Command moved operations to Brookley Army Airfield (later Brookley Air Force Base) near downtown Mobile in late 1945.

===U.S. Air Force and U.S. Coast Guard activity===

The U.S. Air Force returned to Bates Field in May 1959 when the Air Force Reserve activated the 78th Troop Carrier Squadron at the airport with Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar aircraft. In 1961, the Air Force moved this squadron to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana as a Douglas C-124 Globemaster II heavy-lift squadron. The 357th Troop Carrier Squadron then replaced it and acquired the C-119s. The Air Force subsequently upgraded Bates to a Group level upon organizing the 908th Troop Carrier Group, Medium in 1963. However, the Air Force then moved the reservists to the larger Brookley Air Force Base located near downtown Mobile in October 1964 due to budget restraints.

In 1966 the U.S. Coast Guard acquired the vacant U.S. Air Force Reserve facility on the airfield. On December 17, 1966, the Coast Guard officially commissioned an Air Station in Mobile with Grumman HU-16 Albatross fixed wing aircraft from the Coast Guard&#x27;s Air Station in nearby Biloxi. The Coast Guard also established a fixed wing and helicopter training facility at the airport. U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Mobile serves as an Aviation Training Center with a designated headquarters unit that is under the direct control of the Commandant of the Coast Guard.

===Past airline service===
Eastern Airlines was first at Mobile, at the airport south of town until about 1941 when it and National moved to the present airport. In the 1960s Eastern Airlines flew Lockheed L-188 Electras to Mobile, then Boeing 727-100s and Douglas DC-9s mainly to Atlanta. Eastern served Mobile until its demise in 1991.

National Airlines Jacksonville-New Orleans flights stopped at the airport south of Mobile starting about 1939. National Lockheed L-188 Electras appeared in 1962–63; later their Boeing 727-200s flew nonstop to New Orleans and Houston. After its acquisition of National, Pan Am 727s served the airport until 1981.

Capital Airlines began Mobile flights in 1948; United Airlines acquired Capital in 1961 and served Mobile with Douglas DC-6Bs and Capital&#x27;s Vickers Viscounts. Mobile&#x27;s first jets were United Sud Aviation Caravelles to Newark via Birmingham in April 1962. United ended mainline service to Mobile in 1971, but United Express regional jets still serve the airport.

Southern Airways arrived at Mobile in 1950–51; in the 1970s Southern flew nonstop Douglas DC-9s to Atlanta and New Orleans. Southern merged with North Central Airlines to form Republic Airlines which was acquired by Northwest Airlines which continued at Mobile with DC-9s to the Northwest hub in Memphis. Northwest eventually merged into Delta Air Lines.

Starting in 1981 American Airlines Boeing 727-200s flew to Dallas/Fort Worth Airport via Jackson, MS or New Orleans, LA. American also flew to its hub in Nashville from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s before the airline closed that hub.

USAir (later US Airways and now merged into American Airlines) flew nonstop to Charlotte, NC in the mid 1990s with McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s and Fokker 100s.

Texas International arrived in 1979; successor Continental Airlines flew Boeing 737-200s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s nonstop to Houston Intercontinental Airport in the late 1990s. Continental has since merged into United Airlines.

The MC Farmer Terminal was completed in 1985.

===The 21st century===
United Airlines via United Express served Mobile from its hubs in Chicago (ORD) and Washington D.C. (IAD). After the September 11, 2001 attacks, United canceled all service at Mobile. United Express reinstated nonstop service to Houston (IAH) and Chicago (ORD) after the merger of United with Continental Airlines. On September 5, 2018, United stopped flights to Chicago (ORD), citing low demand. All United Express flights at Mobile are regional jets.

In 2006 Delta Air Lines dropped several flights from Mobile and Continental Airlines added flights. In December 2006 Delta had six weekday flights to Atlanta and one to its Cincinnati hub. Delta ended service to Cincinnati on December 12, 2006.

American Airlines restored flights to Chicago (ORD) in April 2007 but ended them in September 2008. Flights to Charlotte and Dallas/Ft. Worth continue on its American Eagle affiliate with Embraer ERJs.

In 2010 Northwest Airlines merged into Delta Air Lines. Northwest had operated nonstops from Mobile to its hub in Memphis; those flights ended after the merger.

After its merger with Continental Airlines in 2012 United Airlines (via its United Express regional affiliate operated by ExpressJet) resumed flights to its hub in Houston (IAH), seven weekday flights. United Express resumed service to the hub in Chicago (ORD) on April 9, 2013.

==Facilities==
Mobile Regional Airport covers 1,717 acres (695 ha) at an elevation of 219 feet (67 m). It has two runways: 15/33 is 8,502 by 150 feet (2,591 x 46 m) and 18/36 is 4,376 by 150 feet (1,334 x 46 m). It has one asphalt helipad, which is 100 by 100 feet (30 x 30 m). The National Weather Service Forecast Office for Southern Alabama, situated near Airport Road and the runway, has a full complement of meteorological instruments, including à NEXRAD weather radar. The airport has 6 gates with jetways.

The terminal at Mobile Regional Airport has renovated shops and restaurants, such as local favorite Carpe Diem Coffee and Tea, car rental agencies, and handicap accessible elevators.

In the year ending October 30, 2021 the airport had 75,034 aircraft operations, average 205 per day: 72% military, 14% general aviation, 8% air taxi, and 5% airline. 31 aircraft were then based at this airport: 6 single-engine and 25 military.

==Airlines and destinations==
;Airlines
The major carriers out of Mobile are United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, based on the number of flights. Additional weekday departures were as follows: Charlotte (four flights via American Eagle) and Dallas/Fort Worth (three flights via American Eagle). Schedules were slightly reduced on the weekends.

Various carriers represent all three major airline alliances—SkyTeam, Star Alliance, and Oneworld—at Mobile, allowing for connections to partner airlines.

Regional airlines flying for the major United States network airlines, as listed, primarily serve Mobile. Delta Air Lines alone operates mainline passenger service from the airport and uses such jet types as the Boeing 717 and the Airbus A319. Delta also operated the McDonnell Douglas DC-9-50 into Mobile prior to the retirement of this aircraft type from their fleet. All other scheduled passenger services are currently operated with either Canadair or Embraer regional jet aircraft.

==Statistics==

===Other statistics===

==Airfares==
The airport has a reputation for high domestic fares, usually attributed to the lack of a true low-cost carrier (LCC) serving the airport, such as JetBlue or Southwest Airlines. Low-cost carrier AirTran Airways served the airport for a time, but Delta Air Lines and other airlines matched fares on the routes that AirTran served, and passengers continued to fly the traditional network carriers. AirTran ultimately discontinued all service, and fares increased once again. AirTran later entered the Pensacola market, and fares dropped significantly from Pensacola International Airport. Because of this, many people drove about an hour in either direction to Pensacola International Airport in Florida or the Gulfport Airport in Mississippi. Fares from Pensacola were lower primarily on routes that AirTran served, while on other routes, including international services, Mobile and Pensacola offered similar fares. AirTran, however, was acquired by Southwest beginning in 2011 and ending in 2014.

In order to attract and maintain frequent flyers, Mobile Regional Airport offered the first airport-based frequent flyer program, called Passport. Passport was launched with a media blitz and new slogan: &quot;Fly Smarter, Fly Mobile.&quot;

The Mobile Airport Authority encourages passengers to use multiple airlines to stimulate more competition and lower fares, and it continues to work to attract a low-cost carrier. The Authority also believes that both Mobile and Pensacola would be better served if a single airport was built to serve both cities in Baldwin County—midway between both cities. However, the Authority claims that Pensacola officials do not want their airport in Alabama and have withdrawn from exploratory discussions.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On February 1, 2016, at around 9:00pm, two people died while returning home on an Angel Flight. The cause of the crash was the heavy fog that also hampered the search for the wrecked plane, a Cessna 182, which was not found until 2:00am on Tuesday, February 2. The crew members who died in the crash were identified as Maj. David R. Mauritson and 2nd Lt. Phil J. Dryden. The men were members of the Civil Air Patrol.

<text>The mistral (, Corsican: &quot;maestrale&quot;, , , , ) is a strong, cold, northwesterly wind that blows from southern France into the Gulf of Lion in the northern Mediterranean. It produces sustained winds averaging 31 miles an hour (50 kilometres an hour), sometimes reaching 60 miles an hour (100 kilometres an hour). It can last for several days. Periods of the wind exceeding for more than sixty-five hours have been reported. It is most common in the winter and spring, and strongest in the transition between the two seasons. 

It affects the northeast of the plain of Languedoc and Provence to the east of Toulon, where it is felt as a strong west wind. It has a major influence all along the Mediterranean coast of France, and often causes sudden storms in the Mediterranean between Corsica and the Balearic Islands.

The name &quot;mistral&quot; comes from the Languedoc dialect of the Occitan and means &quot;masterly&quot;. The same wind is called &quot;mistrau&quot; in the Provençal variant of Occitan, &quot;mestral&quot; in Catalan, &quot;maestrale&quot; in Italian and Corsican, &quot;maistràle&quot; or &quot;bentu maestru&quot; in Sardinian, and &quot;majjistral&quot; in Maltese.

The mistral is usually accompanied by clear, fresh weather, and it plays an important role in creating the climate of Provence. It can reach speeds of more than , particularly in the Rhône Valley. Its average speed during the day can reach about , calming noticeably at night. The mistral usually blows in winter or spring, though it occurs in all seasons. It sometimes lasts only one or two days, frequently lasts several days, and sometimes lasts more than a week.

== Cause ==
The mistral takes place each time there is an anticyclone, or area of high pressure, in the Bay of Biscay, and an area of low pressure around the Gulf of Genoa. When this happens, the flow of air between the high and low pressure areas draws in a current of cold air from the north which accelerates through the lower elevations between the foothills of the Alps and the Cevennes. The conditions for a mistral are even more favorable when a cold rainy front has crossed France from the northwest to the southeast as far as the Mediterranean. This cold, dry wind usually causes a period of cloudless skies and luminous sunshine, which gives the mistral its reputation for making the sky especially clear. There is also, however, the mistral noir, which brings clouds and rain. The mistral noir occurs when the Azores High is extended and draws in unusually moist air from the northwest.

The long and enclosed shape of the Rhône Valley, and the Venturi effect of funnelling the air through a narrowing space, is frequently cited as the reason for the speed and force of the mistral, but the reasons are apparently more complex. The mistral reaches its maximum speed not at the narrowest part of the Rhône Valley, south of Valence, but much farther south, where the Valley has widened. Also, the wind occurs not just in the Valley, but high above in the atmosphere, up to the troposphere, above the earth. The mistral is very strong at the summit of Mont Ventoux, 1900 meters (6300&#x27;) in elevation, though the plain below is very wide. Other contributing factors to the strength of the mistral are the accumulation of masses of cold air, whose volume is greater, pouring down the mountains and valleys to the lower elevations. This is similar to a foehn wind, but unlike a foehn wind the descent in altitude does not significantly warm the mistral. The causes and characteristics of the mistral are very similar to those of the Tramontane, another wind of the French Mediterranean region.
In France, the mistral particularly affects Provence, Languedoc east of Montpellier, as well as all of the Rhône Valley from Lyon to Marseille, and as far southeast as Corsica and Sardinia. The mistral usually blows from the north or northwest, but in certain pre-alpine valleys and along the Côte d&#x27;Azur, the wind is channelled by the mountains so that it blows from east to west. Sometimes it also blows from the north-northeast toward the east of Languedoc as far as Cap Béar. Frequently, the mistral will affect only one part of the region.

In the Languedoc area, where the tramontane is the strongest wind, the mistral and the tramontane blow together onto the Gulf of Lion and the northwest of the western Mediterranean, and can be felt to the east of the Balearic Islands, in Sardinia, and sometimes as far as the coast of Africa.

When the mistral blows from the west, the mass of air is not so cold and the wind only affects the plain of the Rhône delta and the Côte d&#x27;Azur. The good weather is confined to the coast of the Mediterranean, while it can rain in the interior. The Côte d&#x27;Azur generally has a clear sky and warmer temperatures. This type of mistral usually blows for no more than one to three days.

The mistral originating from the northeast has a very different character; it is felt only in the west of Provence and as far as Montpellier, with the wind coming from either a northerly or north-northeasterly direction. In the winter this is by far the coldest form of the mistral. The wind can blow for more than a week. This kind of mistral is often connected with a low pressure area in the Gulf of Genoa, and it can bring unstable weather to the Côte d&#x27;Azur and the east of Provence, sometimes bringing heavy snow to low altitudes in winter.

When the flow of air comes from the northeast due to a widespread low pressure area over the Atlantic and atmospheric disturbances over France, the air is even colder at both high altitudes and ground level, and the mistral is even stronger, and the weather worse, with the creation of cumulus clouds bringing weak storms. This kind of mistral is weaker in the east of Provence and the Côte d&#x27;Azur.

The mistral is not always synonymous with clear skies. When a low pressure front over the Mediterranean approaches the coast from the southeast, the weather can change quickly for the worse, and the mistral and its clear sky changes rapidly to an east wind bringing humid air and threatening clouds. The position of the low-pressure front creates a flow of air from the northwest or the northeast, channeled through the Rhône Valley. If this low-pressure area moves back toward the southeast, the mistral will quickly clear the air and the good weather will return; but if the cold-weather front continues to approach the land, bad weather will continue for several days in the entire Mediterranean basin, sometimes transforming into what French meteorologists call an &quot;épisode cévenol&quot;, a succession of torrential rains and floods, particularly in the areas west of the Rhône Valley: the Ardèche, the Gard, Hérault and Lozère.

The summer mistral, unlike the others, is created by purely local conditions. It usually happens in July, and only in the valley of the Rhône and on the coast of Provence. It is caused by a thermal depression over the interior of Provence (The Var and Alpes de Haute-Provence), created when the land is overheated. This creates a flow of air from the north toward the east of Provence. This wind is frequently cancelled out close to the coast by the breezes from the sea. It does not blow for more than a single day, but it is feared in Provence, because it dries the vegetation and it can spread forest fires.

== Effects ==
The mistral helps explain the unusually sunny climate (2700 to 2900 hours of sunshine a year) and clarity of the air of Provence. When other parts of France have clouds and storms, Provence is rarely affected for long, since the mistral quickly clears the sky. In less than two hours, the sky can change from completely covered to completely clear. The mistral also blows away the dust, and makes the air particularly clear, so that during the mistral it is possible to see mountains and farther away. This clarity of the air and light is one of the features that attracted many French impressionist and post-impressionist artists to the South of France.

The mistral has the reputation of bringing good health, since the dry air dries stagnant water and the mud, giving the mistral the local name &quot;mange-fange&quot; (Eng. &quot;mud-eater&quot;). It also blows away pollution from the skies over the large cities and industrial areas.

The sunshine and dryness brought by the mistral have an important effect on the local vegetation. The vegetation in Provence, which is already dry because of the small amount of rainfall, is made even drier by the wind, which makes it particularly susceptible to fires, which the wind spreads very rapidly, sometimes devastating vast expanses of mountainside before being extinguished. During the summer, thousands of hectares can burn when the mistral is blowing.

In the Rhône Valley and on the plain of la Crau, the regularity and force of the mistral causes the trees to grow leaning to the south. Once the forest has been razed by fire, the strong wind makes it difficult for new trees to grow. The farmers of the Rhône Valley have long planted rows of cypress trees to shelter their crops from the dry force of the mistral. The mistral can also have beneficial effects—the moving air can save crops from the spring frost, which can last until the end of April.

As summer visitors to the beach in Provence learn, the summer mistral can quickly lower the temperature of the sea, as the wind pushes the warm water near the surface out to sea and it is replaced by colder water from greater depths.

=== Beyond France ===

The mistral regularly affects the weather in Sardinia and sometimes also affects the weather in North Africa, Sicily and Malta and other parts of the Mediterranean, particularly when low-pressure areas form in the Gulf of Genoa. The winds create a physically cold, salty ocean body that sinks in the Gulf of Lion when certain weather conditions are present.

== Maestral or maestro in the Adriatic ==
Similar names—&quot;maestral&quot; or &quot;maestro&quot;—are used for (although also mostly northwestern) a quite different wind in the Adriatic Sea. It is an anabatic sea-breeze wind which blows in the summer when the east Adriatic coast gets warmer than the sea. It is thus a mild sea-to-coast wind, unlike the mistral. The strong katabatic wind there is the northeastern bora.

In Greece, it is also known as &quot;maïstros&quot; or &quot;maïstráli&quot;. In southwestern Crete, it is considered the most beneficial wind, said to blow only in daytime.

== In Provençal culture ==

The mistral played an important part in the life and culture of Provence from the beginning. Excavations at the prehistoric site called Terra Amata, at the foot of Mount Boron in Nice, showed that in about 40,000 B.C. the inhabitants had built a low wall of rocks and beach stones to the northwest of their fireplace to protect their fire from the power of the mistral.

The &quot;mas&quot; (farmhouse) traditionally faces south, with its back to the mistral. The bell towers of villages in Provence are often open iron frameworks, which allow the wind to pass through. The traditional Provençal Nativity scene usually includes a figure of a shepherd holding his hat, with his cloak blowing in the mistral.

A Fête du Vent (Festival of Wind) is held periodically on the Prado Beach in Marseille.

<doc id="294963" wikidata="Q2519471" url="?curid=294963" title="Polyene">
<text>In organic chemistry, polyenes are poly-unsaturated, organic compounds that contain at least three alternating double () and single () carbon–carbon bonds. These carbon–carbon double bonds interact in a process known as conjugation, resulting in some unusual optical properties. Related to polyenes are dienes, where there are only two alternating double and single bonds.

The following polyenes are used as antimycotics for humans: amphotericin B, nystatin, candicidin, pimaricin, methyl partricin, and trichomycin.

==Optical properties==
Some polyenes are brightly colored, an otherwise rare property for a hydrocarbon. Normally alkenes absorb in the ultraviolet region of a spectrum, but the absorption energy state of polyenes with numerous conjugated double bonds can be lowered such that they enter the visible region of the spectrum, resulting in compounds which are coloured (because they contain a chromophore). Thus many natural dyes contain linear polyenes.

== Chemical and electrical properties ==
Polyenes tend to be more reactive than simpler alkenes. For example, polyene-containing triglycerides are reactive towards atmospheric oxygen. Polyacetylene, which partially oxidized or reduced, exhibits high electrical conductivity. Most conductive polymers are polyenes, and many have conjugated structures. Poly(aza)acetylenes are readily prepared from pyridine precursors without the necessity of a controlled atmosphere, simply by ultraviolet irradiation of a mixture of pyridine and poly(4-vinyl) pyridine. Recent research at the Weizmann Institute and Aix-Marseille University showed a clear transition between ionic and electronic conductivity with increasing UV dose over 30 hours.

==Occurrence==
A few fatty acids are polyenes. Another class of important polyenes are polyene antimycotics,

<text>Robert Sward (23 June 1933 – 21 February 2022) was an American and Canadian poet and novelist.

Jack Foley, in his introduction to Sward&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems, 1957–2004&quot;, called him, &quot;in truth, a citizen, at heart, of both countries. At once a Canadian and American poet, one with a foot in both worlds, Sward also inhabits an enormous in-between.&quot;

==Early years==

Sward was born on 23 June 1933 and raised in Chicago, Illinois.
He began writing poetry at the age of 15 when he became involved with a street gang and used rhyming couplets in his notes to the other gang members. He graduated from Von Steuben High School at 17 and quit his job as a soda jerk in a pharmacy to join the United States Navy. In 1952, he was stationed in Korea on an amphibious ship, LST 914. A Yeoman 3rd Class, Sward soon became the head of the ship&#x27;s library, while serving in the combat zone during the Korean War.

==University==
He taught at Cornell University, 1964–65, where he first experimented with computer-generated poetry and served on the editorial board of &quot;Epoch&quot;. He went on to teach at the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop, the University of Victoria, and the University of California, Santa Cruz.

==Working in media==
In the 1980s, he worked for the CBC, where he interviewed and produced 60-minute radio features on Leonard Cohen, Margaret Atwood, Earle Birney, John Robert Colombo, Al Purdy, Gwendolyn MacEwen, and other leading Canadian figures. His &quot;Quill &amp; Quire&quot; interview with Nobel prize winner, Saul Bellow, was widely read. Sward also worked as journalist, book reviewer and feature writer for &quot;The Toronto Star&quot;, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, and &quot;The Financial Times&quot; in Toronto, Ontario while living on the Toronto Islands. He received a Canada Council grant to research and write &quot;The Toronto Islands&quot; (1983), a best-selling (Source: Dreadnaught Press publisher, 1983) illustrated history of a unique community, from prehistoric times to the present.

==Awards==

Sward had an active personal website: www.robertsward.com
Sward created MonoBlogAlz.com as a memorial for his late wife Gloria K. Alford 1928–2017, a well known West Coast visual artist.

==Books==
Sward&#x27;s first book, &quot;Uncle Dog &amp; Other Poems&quot; (1962), was published by Putnam &amp; Co. in England. It was followed by &quot;Kissing the Dancer&quot; (Cornell University Press, 1964), with an Introduction by Pulitzer Prize poet William Meredith. &quot;The Carleton Miscellany&quot; reviewed the book saying, &quot;In the animal poems there is a bravery in the face of our limitations, a warmth for our absurdities, a way of life to be gleaned from our failings and ineptitudes... a self-critique that turns our freakishness into an ironic source of fulfillment and transcendence.&quot; Source: Theodore Holmes in &quot;The Carleton Miscellany&quot; 1964. The poem, &quot;Uncle Dog: The Poet At 9&quot;, has been frequently anthologized and Sward continues to write about exotic animals and dogs in particular. Animated videos of these works (mini-movies with poetry) employ avatars, digital representations of the poet and his subjects, and appear in DVD format and online at Blue&#x27;s Cruzio Cafe.

A key theme in his last books, &quot;Rosicrucian in the Basement&quot; (2001), &quot;Heavenly Sex&quot; (2002), &quot;The Collected Poems, 1957–2004&quot; (2004), and &quot;God is in the Cracks&quot; (2006), is fathers and sons. Sward&#x27;s father, Dr. Irving M. Sward, was a podiatrist and something of a mystic, combining his practice of Rosicrucianism with a study of the Kabbalah. Of &quot;Rosicrucian in the Basement&quot;, Robert Bly writes, &#x27;There are many mysteries between father and son that people don&#x27;t talk about... There&#x27;s much leaping [in Sward&#x27;s poetry], but each line, so to speak, steps on something solid.&#x27; In commenting on the father and son series Dana Gioia adds, &quot;The CD is terrific... &quot;Rosicrucian in the Basement&quot; unfolds perfectly at its own pace and never loses the listener.&quot; Source: &quot;Robert Sward: Poetry, Review &amp; Interview with Jack Foley, Recorded for KPFA-FM Berkeley, CA with readings from Heavenly Sex &amp; Rosicrucian in the Basement&quot; (2002), &quot;Uncle Dog Audio&quot;, Number 1002 (2002), and &quot;The Collected Poems,&quot; Black Moss Press,&quot;1957–2004&quot; (2004).

Garrison Keillor selected &quot;God is in the Cracks&quot;, one of the father and son poems and title poem of Sward&#x27;s 2006 collection, for broadcast on his radio show &quot;Writer&#x27;s Almanac.&quot;

==Family==

Alford (1928–2017), lived in Santa Cruz, California, where he took up residence in 1985, after fourteen years living and working in Canada, primarily in Victoria, B.C. (1969–1979) and on the Toronto Islands (1979–1985). A member of the League of Canadian Poets starting in 1975, Sward toured Canada with each of his new books, reviewed and helped bring noted Canadian writers to the U.S.

<text>Isa Boletini (; 15 January 186423 or 24 January 1916) was an Albanian revolutionary commander and politician and rilindas from Kosovo.

As a young man, he joined the Albanian nationalist League of Prizren and participated in a battle against Ottoman forces. After this, he built a power base in the Mitrovica area. In 1909, he and other Kosovo Albanian chieftains, revolted against the Turks imposition of taxes on Muslims. Next, he took an important role in the 1910 revolt against Ottoman rule, the Albanian revolt of 1912, then fought against the Montenegrin and Serbian armies in Kosovo. He participated in the Albanian Declaration of Independence in Vlorë (November 1912) and was then assigned as a diplomatic agent to the British (1913), and bodyguard of Prince Wilhelm of Albania (1914). He was killed during a shoot-out in Podgorica under unclear circumstances in January 1916.

== Early life and family ==

Isa Boletini was born in the village of Boletin near Mitrovica, then part of the Ottoman Empire. His family were Albanian Muslims which had migrated to Boletin from the village of Isniq near Deçan, due to a blood feud () though they ultimately hailed from Shala, in northern Albania. They adopted the surname &quot;&quot; (&quot;of Boletin&quot;) from their village. His common name in Albanian is &quot;Isa Boletini&quot;, rendered in English as &quot;Isa Boletin&quot; and &quot;Isa Boljetini&quot;. Another common spelling is &quot;Isa Boletin&quot;. His name is also written as . In some German and Italian works, the name is spelt &quot;Issa Boletinaz&quot;. Other spellings include &quot;Isa Boletinac&quot;. The Shala were the poorest tribe of Albania with a small exception of around 400 families who lived in Isniq. They were in conflict with the Gashi tribe until they made peace in August 1879. 

Boletini had several sons, who are mentioned in 1924 as living with their women and other relatives in Boletini&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (that had been destroyed by Ottoman artillery several times) near the Sokolica Monastery. His son Mustafa was a rebel leader in the Balkan Wars.

== Career ==

=== 1878–1907 ===
Following the emergence of the Albanian nationalist League of Prizren in 1878, Isa Boletini actively participated in the evolving political and military landscape of the region. This involvement began prominently with his engagement in the Battle of Slivova against the Ottoman forces in April 1881. Boletini established a substantial influence in his native region, a power that often brought him into complex and contentious interactions with the local community.

During the turn of the century, Boletini&#x27;s role diversified. By 1898-99, he was known for his protective stance towards the Serbian Orthodox community in the Mitrovica region. Such actions garnered him recognition from various quarters, including the Kingdom of Serbia, which awarded him a medal and a supply of weapons. Boletini and his brother Ahmed lived in close proximity to the Sokolica Monastery, a Serbian Orthodox monastery nestled between Albanian villages. However, the tranquillity was increasingly overshadowed by escalating ethnic tensions after 1900.

=== 1908–1911 ===
During the Young Turk Revolution (1908), a large gathering in Firzovik of local urban notables and Muslim clergy (ulama) backed restoration of the constitution while Boletini on the side of the chieftains viewed that position as disloyalty to the sultan. He withdrew his forces before a decision could be made realizing the weakness of his position. During the revolution, rumors of the time had it that Abdul Hamid II asked Boletini for assistance to disperse the Firzovik gathering. He was loyal to the sultan though in 1908 Boletini had given his initial support to the Young Turks and later fought against their government. Boletini was deputy of Kosovo in the Ottoman Assembly between 1908 and 1912.

The Committee of Union and Progress, within a month of the restoration of the constitution, decided to address blood feuding matters in Kosovo, sentencing Albanians engaged in killings. Toward the end of 1908 aggressive measures was pushed by locals – Nexhip Draga and other notables in Kosovo viewed Boletini as a nuisance, threat and loyalist of sultan Abdulhamid II and lobbied the new Young Turk (CUP) government for his arrest and destruction of his kulla (tower house). Class differences of Draga, a landowner wanting law and order and Boletini, a chieftain preferring maintenance of old privileges and autonomy along with the disagreement in Firzovik about the restoration of the constitution resulted in the rift. Unable to convince CUP members in Mitrovica to take action, Draga traveled to Salonika and pleaded his case to the local CUP committee who approved and got the Ottoman government to act against Boletini. The Ottoman government needing a pretext for action sent an officer with some soldiers to serve a court order to Boletini for illegally receiving land from the sultan that previously belonged to a local named Haxhi Ali. Boletini scoffed at the charges, cursed the Young Turk revolution and threw the Ottoman authorities out. Ottoman forces arrived at his stronghold shortly after, resulting in an attack and fierce firefight with Boletini escaping with a small group of men and his kulla was razed to the ground. Local Ottoman authorities like the mutasarrif of İpek (Pejë) advised the Young Turk government against action on Boletini on grounds it could produce larger troubles for the state and instead advocated for a show of force to make local chieftains submit. After the events with Boletini, the Ottoman army then went throughout Kosovo and razed other kullas of several chieftains involved in the deruhdecilik (protection &quot;racket&quot;) system.

During the 31 March incident, Boletini along with several Kosovo Albanian chieftains offered the sultan military assistance. On 15 May 1909, the Young Turks, continuing their former policy of denying the Albanians national rights, sent a military expedition to the Kosovo Vilayet to stop the growth of hostile attitudes to the government and break resistance of the peasants, who refused to pay taxes which Istanbul had introduced. Cavid Pasha, the new commander of the division at Mitroviça, was ordered to carry out a succession of military operations against the Albanian mountaineers, in particular the capture of Boletini. The Young Turks expressed the view through their newspaper &quot;Tanin&quot; that most Albanians of the area had given their besa (pledge) not to go against the government apart from Boletini and a few supporters. Ottoman authorities placed a reward of 300 liras on Boletini for his capture. On account of the attempts of the authorities to collect taxes which hitherto had been paid almost entirely by the Christians, serious disturbances broke out among the warlike Muslim tribes of northern Albania. Boletini, a prominent leader often honoured by the Sultan, and other chiefs of Pejë and Yakova (Gjakovë), attacked the Ottoman army, and numerous fights led to much bloodshed, the Ottoman army also bombarding several villages. Boletini led fighting in Pristina, Prizren and elsewhere.

Boletini took an important role in the Albanian Revolt of 1910. Early in 1910, he visited the Albanian highlanders who had fled into Montenegro where they were given additional weapons by King Nikolla. In Kosovo at İpek, Boletini and the heads of twelve Albanian highland clans agreed for joint action against the Ottomans. Kosovo Albanians went on the offensive and with 2,000 men Boletini attacked Firzovik and Prizren. He resisted the Ottoman army at Carraleva for two days. Boletini later escaped as the Ottomans put down the rebellion. In 1910, Nopcsa named him and the earlier Ali Pasha Draga the leading Albanian figures in Mitrovica. In 1910–11, the Montenegrin government encouraged northern Albanian tribes (&quot;Malissori&quot;) to revolt against the Ottoman Empire. Apart from the Catholic Malissori, also some Kosovo Albanian leaders were approached, among these were Boletini. Boletini intended to use Montenegro as a base for incursions into Ottoman Albania. At first, Montenegro ignored his presence, but on 15 June, after numerous protests from the Ottoman ambassador, escorted Boletini and his thirteen followers away from the Albanian border.

=== 1912 ===


In the prelude to revolt, the Serbian government worked with some Albanian guerrilla bands to be in position of creating difficulties if the moment required it and to that end courted Boletini through the Serbian organization known as the Black Hand. On April 23, Hasan Prishtina&#x27;s rebels revolted in the Highlands of Gjakova, which then spread. By 20 May, Boletini alongside other Albanian leaders were present at a meeting in Junik where a besa (pledge) was given to wage war on the Young Turk government through armed insurrection in Kosovo Vilayet. In springtime 1912, Boletini led a revolt in Kosovo, with surprising victories after victories against the Turks. During the 1912 uprising, while waiting for an Ottoman response to the demands of the rebels, Boletini and other leaders of the rebellion ordered their forces to advance toward Üsküb (modern Skopje) which was captured during August 12–15. Albanian irregulars then threatened to march on Bitola and Thessaloniki, and the Ottomans sent troops against the rebels, who retired to the mountains but continued to protest against the government, and in the whole region between İpek and Mitrovica they plundered military depots, opened prisons and collected taxes from the inhabitants for the Albanian chiefs.

On August 18, the moderate faction led by Prishtina managed to convince Boletini, and other leaders Idriz Seferi, Bajram Curri and Riza Bey Gjakova of the conservative group to accept the agreement with the Ottomans for Albanian sociopolitical and cultural rights. The Ottomans then agreed on concessions that promised autonomy for the Albanian-inhabited vilayets of Kosovo, Scutari, Yanina and part of Monastir (Bitola). On 18 August 1912, the Porte replied that it was ready to concede a series of economic, political, administrative and cultural rights, but no formal autonomy. The Albanian side accepted, abandoned further national claims, and had Boletini pacified and returned to his home. The Ottoman side accepted on 4 September. This created a virtually autonomous Albanian state. While Muslim Kosovo Albanians were pleased, the Balkan neighbours and Catholic Albanians were not. The Balkan states envisaged the partition of Albania between them, and thus hastened to precipitate war. Montenegro won over the Malissori, supporting an autonomous northern Albanian Catholic entity.

In August, Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijević &quot;Apis&quot;, the head of the Serbian Black Hand organization, sent a letter requesting Boletini and his men to assist the Serbs in fighting the Ottomans. The Black Hand stimulated and encouraged the Kosovo Albanians in their revolt, promising them help; Colonel Apis visited northern Albania several times in order to get in touch with the leaders of the Albanian uprising, especially Boletini. Apis declared that the Serbs only wanted to liberate the Albanians from Ottoman subjection, and that the Serbs and Albanians both would benefit from liberating the country. Succeeding in persuading the Kosovo Albanians to fight against the Ottomans, however, Apis and his men committed political murders disguised as Albanians, and eventually the Montenegrin and Serbian armies massacred Albanians, and stopped the inflow of arms to the Albanians, in early September 1912.

=== Balkan Wars ===

In the beginning of the First Balkan War, the Ottoman army was supported by some Albanian volunteers and irregulars; the Ottoman authorities supplied Boletini&#x27;s men with 65,000 rifles and to protect Albanian lands within the empire he fought by their side which disappointed Serbia. The following historical account of events (uncorroborated by any other researcher of Albanian origin or otherwise) is from Isa Blumi, a researcher on Turkish Studies, based in Sweden. On 28 November 1912 in Vlora the Albanian National Assembly proclaimed independence. Ismail Qemali refused to wait for Boletini and other Albanian leaders of the Kosovo Vilayet and hastily made the declaration. The southern elite wanted to prevent Boletini&#x27;s plans to assert himself as a key political figure and used him to suite their military needs.

Boletini contributed in the protection of Vlora government, while later was part of the Albanian delegation to the London Conference (1913) together with Ismail Qemali, Albanian head of government. The Albanian delegation wanted a Kosovo within the borders of the newly founded state of Albania, however the Great Powers said no and ceded the region to Serbia.

In 1913, Boletini and Bajram Curri commanded rebels against the Serbian and Montenegrin armies. On 13 August 1913, an outbreak of hostilities took place on the Serbian-Albanian frontier. A tenacious Albanian band of fighters under the command of Boletini, now Minister for War in the Provisional Government, made a successful attack on the frontier town of Debar and captured it from the small Serbian garrison, which had to retire after suffering severe losses.

On 23 September 1913, the dissatisfaction of the Albanian population at finding themselves under Serbian rule led to an uprising in Macedonia of Albanian patriots who refused to accept the decision of the Ambassadors Conference on the Albanian borders. The Albanian government organised armed resistance to recover the lost areas and 6,000 Albanians under the command of Boletini, the Minister of War, crossed the frontier. After an engagement with the Serbians the forces retook Debar and then marched, together with a Bulgarian band led by Petar Chaoulev, in the direction of Ohrid, but another band was checked with loss at Mavrovo. Within a few days they captured the towns of Gostivar, Struga and Ohrid, expelling the Serbian troops. At Ohrid they set up a local government and held the hills towards Resen for four days.

=== 1914 ===


During the pro-Ottoman peasant uprising in central Albania which broke out in mid-May 1914, Isa Boletini and his troops defended Prince Wilhelm.

When the revolt deteriorated in June 1914, Boletini and his men, mostly from Kosovo, joined the Dutch International Gendarmerie in their fight against the pro-Ottoman rebels.

=== World War I ===

During World War I, Boletini commanded guerrilla fighters against the Montenegrin and Serbian armies.

== Death ==
There are different stories about his death in Podgorica on 23 or 24 January 1916:

*Boletini became seriously ill while defending Scutari, and in order to not be taken by the Montenegrins he sought to ask for protection at the French consulate in Cetinje. He was arrested in the Cetinje Hotel and immediately interred in Nikšić, then in Podgorica. During the entering of the Austro-Hungarian army and chaos in Podgorica, the Montenegrin gendarmerie killed Boletini, his two sons, two grandsons, son-in-law, nephew and two loyal fellows, on the bridge over the Morača river on 23 January 1916. It was believed that he went to meet the Austro-Hungarian army. According to the Albanian newspapers, the unit of Montenegrin Gendarmerie that killed Boletini was under command of Savo Lazarević.
*Historian Bogumil Hrabak mentioned that his death occurred &quot;in the stir which he provoked with his threats that he would take over the city&quot;. 
*Owen Pearson claims that on 24 January 1916 he was killed while &quot;virtually a prisoner&quot; in Podgorica, after a dispute provoked by the Montenegrins led to fighting in the town. He managed to kill eight before he died.
*A Belgrade press claimed that upon the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Montenegro, when citizens were to hand over weapons to the authorities, Isa Boletini, his son and six friends refused, entered the town courtroom where people had gathered, and tried to encourage them to resist the occupation, then shot a Montenegrin writer and two police officers (&quot;panduri&quot;). A manhunt followed, in which Boletini was killed.

==Flag of Isa Boletini==

The flag of Isa Boletini was used for the first time at the Assembly of Isniq in 1910. It was later raised on top of a hill in Visekovc and on 12 August 1912, Boletini with thirty of his men, carried it through the streets of Skopje, which at the time was part of the Vilayet of Kosovo. 
The same flag was used in Vlorë, when Boletini and a cavalry of four hundred fighters entered the city on the day Albania declared its independence.

== Assessment and legacy ==
Boletini was tall, well-built, and strong, with great reputation, whose deeds of bravery and escapes from Turks and Serbs had become legends in Albania. He was noted for always wearing the traditional Albanian &quot;qeleshe&quot; white cap and national dress. He is considered one of Albania&#x27;s greatest patriots and heroes. His ideas influenced the likes of Mid&#x27;hat Frashëri and prominent Albanian nationalists. During the airplane meeting in Podgorica on 24 June 1934, pilot Tadija Sondermajer wore a Montenegrin dress and the flintlock of Boletini. 
In 2010, Fatmir Sejdiu, the president of the Republic of Kosova, awarded him the highest order, &quot;Hero of Kosovo&quot;, along with Azem Galica, Shote Galica, Hasan Prishtina, and Bajram Curri. A statue of him was uncovered in Southern Mitrovica on the 100th anniversary of the Independence of Albania and Flag Day (28 November 2012). During the abandoned Serbia v Albania (UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying) match, on 14 October 2014, while the game was suspended, a small remote-controlled quadcopter drone with a flag suspended from it hovered over the stadium. The flag showed the faces of Ismail Qemali and Isa Boletini and a map of a Greater Albania.

The Isa Boletini Monument is a heroic statue of Boletini in Shkodër, in northwestern Albania. It is high and was erected in 1986.

== Quotes ==
*&quot;When the spring comes, we will manure the plains of Kosovo with the bones of Serbs, for we Albanians have suffered too much to forget&quot;, 1913.
*When Sir Edward Grey met Boletini in London at the British Foreign Office after having his pistol belt&#x27;s ammunition removed, he uttered: &quot;General, the newspapers might record tomorrow that Boletini, whom even Mahmut Shefqet Pasha could not disarm, was just disarmed in London.&quot;, upon which Boletini replied &quot;No, no, not in London either.&quot;, he then withdrew a second pistol from his pocket.

<text>Private Media Group, Inc. is a Swedish production and distribution company that distributes adult entertainment via print publications, DVDs, and the Internet. It first published a magazine called &quot;Private&quot; in Stockholm in 1965.

== Origins ==

&quot;Private&quot; magazine was established in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1965 as the world&#x27;s first full-color hardcore magazine by Berth Milton Sr. In the early 1990s, his son Berth Milton Jr. took over and started to produce movies and internet content, taking Private public soon after.

In August 2008 Private Media Group announced it had established an alliance with Marc Dorcel to collaborate in the home video market. The collaboration started with a three-year DVD distribution agreement for France.

The firm&#x27;s 2009 acquisitions of video on demand companies Gamelink LLC and Sureflix, and the ecommerce technology firm eLine LLC established it as a leading adult content and distribution company in the digital media sector.

<doc id="294974" wikidata="Q1071084" url="?curid=294974" title="Roppongi Hills">
<text>is a development project in Tokyo and one of Japan&#x27;s largest integrated property developments, located in the Roppongi district of Minato, Tokyo.

Constructed by building tycoon Minoru Mori, the mega-complex incorporates office space, apartments, shops, restaurants, cafes, movie theatres, a museum, a hotel, a major TV studio, an outdoor amphitheatre, and a few parks. The centrepiece of the complex is the 54-story Roppongi Hills Mori Tower. Mori&#x27;s stated vision was to build an integrated development where high-rise inner-urban communities allow people to live, work, play, and shop in proximity to eliminate commuting time. The company argued that this would increase leisure time, quality of life, and benefit Japan&#x27;s national competitiveness. 17 years after the design&#x27;s initial conception, the complex opened to the public on April 25, 2003. The architecture and use of space is documented in the book &quot;Six Strata: Roppongi Hills Redefined&quot;.

==Development==
Roppongi Hills cost over $4 billion and was built on a 27-acre (109,000 m2) site. The site amalgamated more than 400 smaller lots Mori acquired over 14 years.

===Mori Tower===

Mori Tower is a 54-story high-rise building designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox that houses an art museum, restaurants, cafes, clinics, stores, as well as the offices of Allen &amp; Overy, Barclays Capital, Ferrari Japan, Goldman Sachs, J-WAVE, Konami, Time Inc., Chevron, BASF, Lenovo, Mercari, Baidu, GREE, BP, SAS Institute and Google. The Pokémon Company also has its headquarters in the Mori Tower.
The first six levels of Mori Tower contain retail stores and restaurants. The top six floors house the Mori Art Museum and the Tokyo City View with panoramic views of the city. A new exit from Roppongi Station empties into a glass atrium filled with large television screens and escalators, as well as several shops and restaurants. The rest of the building is office space.
===Other buildings===
Around the Mori Tower are several smaller buildings predominantly occupied by shops and restaurants, a cinema complex and the Mori Garden. Behind the Mori Tower lies the Keyakizaka Street, famous for its night illumination of 1.2 million shining LEDs that begin in mid-November and run until Christmas Day. Keyakizaka also features cafes and luxury stores such as Louis Vuitton. Nearby are the four Roppongi Hills residence towers, with a total of 793 residential apartments.

Large open spaces have been built into the design of Roppongi Hills. About half of the area consists of gardens, pavilions, and other open spaces. The Mori Garden, an elaborate and authentic Japanese garden complete with a pond and trees is particularly popular. The garden is part of a lost mansion that housed members of the feudal Mōri clan.

On Roppongi Hills the exhibition of the United Buddy Bears was shown in 2005 for the first time in Japan. The exhibition was opened by the President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Horst Köhler, together with the Prime Minister of Japan, Junichiro Koizumi. According to the Mori-Group, project partners in Tokyo, they were able to count three million visitors over the six weeks of the exhibition.

The American School in Japan&#x27;s Early Learning Center is housed in a residence building next to the Hills, the Roppongi Sakura-zaka Residence. A playground adjacent to the complex, near the school, is known in English as Robot Park and has robot-themed play equipment.

The headquarters of TV Asahi is also situated in Roppongi Hills, next to the Mori Garden. The building was designed by architect Fumihiko Maki.

==Criticism==
Roppongi Hills Arena is a facility with large outdoor speakers, in proximity to older housing. Since the construction of the Roppongi Hills development, complaints of noise pollution from older residents have been ignored by Mori Building management, according to residents. The building most directly suffering from noise is on top of an embankment opposite the Arena. Residents say several residents have been forced out by the noise.

Henry Hilton of the &quot;Japan Today&quot; news aggregator website criticised the development when he argued:
Yet the truth is that the crowds are unlikely to return once they have been exhausted by the charade of inconvenient walkways that appear almost intentionally to confuse all but those with perfect map navigational skills. The whole maze is far from being user friendly—don&#x27;t count on full protection from autumn showers or sudden gusts of wind generated by the buildings themselves.

==Financial issues==
Mori Building has financed the project with $800 million equity and $1.3 billion in debt from a syndicate of banks led by the Development Bank of Japan. As a result, the company&#x27;s overall debts are $5.6 billion, secured by billions more in assets.

Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., the project&#x27;s anchor tenant, attracted deep discounts in rental prices because of the large amount of space it occupies. Japan&#x27;s sluggish economy, staff cuts by foreign companies, and the flow of new office space have put downward pressure on rents.

Because of eminent domain law in Japan, several past residents of the site that would be Roppongi Hills have been given residential units in the complex in return for their agreement to vacate their prior homes, so that their prior homes would be demolished and the land used for the development of Roppongi Hills.

<text>Diethylstilbestrol (DES), also known as stilbestrol or stilboestrol, is a nonsteroidal estrogen medication, which is presently rarely used. In the past, it was widely used for a variety of indications, including pregnancy support for those with a history of recurrent miscarriage, hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms and estrogen deficiency, treatment of prostate cancer and breast cancer, and other uses. By 2007, it was only used in the treatment of prostate cancer and breast cancer. In 2011, Hoover and colleagues reported adverse reproductive health outcomes linked to DES including infertility, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, preeclampsia, preterm birth, stillbirth, infant death, menopause prior to age 45, breast cancer, cervical cancer, and vaginal cancer. While most commonly taken by mouth, DES was available for use by other routes as well, for instance, vaginal, topical, and by injection.
DES is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. It is a synthetic and nonsteroidal estrogen of the stilbestrol group, and differs from the natural estrogen estradiol. Compared to estradiol, DES has greatly improved bioavailability when taken by mouth, is more resistant to metabolism, and shows relatively increased effects in certain parts of the body like the liver and uterus. These differences result in DES having an increased risk of blood clots, cardiovascular issues, and certain other adverse effects.
DES was discovered in 1938 and introduced for medical use in 1939. From about 1940 to 1971, the medication was given to pregnant women in the incorrect belief that it would reduce the risk of pregnancy complications and losses. In 1971, DES was shown to cause clear-cell carcinoma, a rare vaginal tumor, in those who had been exposed to this medication &quot;in utero&quot;. The United States Food and Drug Administration subsequently withdrew approval of DES as a treatment for pregnant women. Follow-up studies have indicated that DES also has the potential to cause a variety of significant adverse medical complications during the lifetimes of those exposed including infertility.

The United States National Cancer Institute recommends children born to mothers who took DES to undergo special medical exams on a regular basis to screen for complications as a result of the medication. Individuals who were exposed to DES during their mothers&#x27; pregnancies are commonly referred to as &quot;DES daughters&quot; and &quot;DES sons&quot;. Since the discovery of the toxic effects of DES, it has largely been discontinued and is now mostly no longer marketed for human treatment.

==Medical uses==
DES has been used in the past for the following indications:
* Recurrent miscarriage in pregnancy
* Menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal atrophy
* Hormone therapy for hypoestrogenism (e.g., gonadal dysgenesis, premature ovarian failure, and after oophorectomy)
* Postpartum lactation suppression to prevent or reverse breast engorgement
* Gonorrheal vaginitis (discontinued following the introduction of the antibiotic penicillin)
* Prostate cancer and breast cancer
* Prevention of tall stature in tall adolescent girls
* Treatment of acne in girls and women
* As an emergency postcoital contraceptive
* As a means of chemical castration for treating hypersexuality and paraphilias and sex offenders
* Prevention of the testosterone flare at the start of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH agonist) therapy
* Feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women

DES was used at a dosage of 0.2 to 0.5 mg/day in menopausal hormone therapy.

Interest in the use of DES to treat prostate cancer continues today. However, use of bioidentical parenteral estrogens like polyestradiol phosphate has been advocated in favor of oral synthetic estrogens like DES due to their much lower risk of cardiovascular toxicity. In addition to prostate cancer, some interest in the use of DES to treat breast cancer continues today as well. However, similarly to the case of prostate cancer, arguments have been made for the use of bioidentical estrogens like estradiol instead of DES for breast cancer.

Oral DES at 0.25 to 0.5 mg/day is effective in the treatment of hot flashes in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.

Although DES was used to support pregnancy, it was later found not to be effective for this use and to actually be harmful.

==Side effects==
At more than 1 mg/day, DES is associated with high rates of side effects including nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, headache, and bloating (incidence of 15–50%).

===Breast changes and feminization===
The pigmentation of the breast areolae are often very dark and almost black with DES therapy. The pigmentation that occurs with synthetic estrogens such as DES is much greater than with natural estrogens such as estradiol. The mechanism of the difference is unknown. Progestogens like hydroxyprogesterone caproate have been reported to reduce the nipple hyperpigmentation induced by high-dose estrogen therapy.

In men treated with it for prostate cancer, DES has been found to produce high rates of gynecomastia (breast development) of 41 to 77%.

===Blood clots and cardiovascular issues===
In studies of DES as a form of high-dose estrogen therapy for those with prostate cancer, it has been associated with considerable cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The risk is dose-dependent. A dosage of 5 mg/day DES has been associated with a 36% increase in non-cancer-related (mostly cardiovascular) deaths. In addition, there is an up to 15% incidence of venous thromboembolism. A 3 mg/day dosage of DES has been associated with an incidence of thromboembolism of 9.6 to 17%, with an incidence of cardiovascular complications of 33.3%. A lower dosage of 1 mg/day DES has been associated with a rate of death due to cardiovascular events of 14.8% (relative to 8.3% for orchiectomy alone).

===Other long-term effects===
DES has been linked to a variety of long-term adverse effects in women who were treated with it during pregnancy, and/or in their offspring, including increased risk of the following:
* vaginal clear-cell adenocarcinoma
* vaginal adenosis
* T-shaped uterus
* uterine fibroids
* cervical weakness
* breast cancer
* infertility
* hypogonadism
* intersexual gestational defects
* depression

A comprehensive animal study in 1993 found a plethora of adverse effects from DES such as (but not limited to)
* genotoxicity (due to quinone metabolite)
* teratogenicity
* penile and testicular hypoplasia
* cryptorchidism (in rats and rhesus monkeys),
* liver and renal cancer (in hamsters), ovarian papillary carcinoma (in canines), and
* malignant uterine mesothelioma (in squirrel monkeys). Evidence was also found linking ADHD to F2 generations, demonstrating that there is at least some neurological and transgenerational effects in addition to the carcinogenic.
Rodent studies reveal female reproductive tract cancers and abnormalities reaching to the F2 generation, and there is evidence of adverse effects such as irregular menstrual cycles intersexual in grandchildren of DES mothers. Additionally, evidence also points to transgenerational effects in F2 sons, such as hypospadias.
At this time however, the extent of DES transgenerational effects in humans is not fully understood.

==Overdose==
DES has been assessed in the past in clinical studies at extremely high doses of as much as 1,500 to 5,000 mg/day.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===

====Estrogenic activity====
DES is an estrogen; specifically, it is a highly potent full agonist of both of the estrogen receptors (ERs). It has approximately 468% and 295% of the affinity of estradiol at the ERα and ERβ, respectively. However, EC50 values of 0.18 nM and 0.06 nM of DES for the ERα and ERβ, respectively, have been reported, suggesting, in spite of its binding affinity for the two receptors, several-fold preference for activation of the ERβ over the ERα. In addition to the nuclear ERs, DES is an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), albeit with relatively low affinity (~1,000 nM). DES produces all of the same biological effects attributed to natural estrogens like estradiol. This includes effects in the uterus, vagina, mammary glands, pituitary gland, and other tissues.

A dosage of 1 mg/day DES is approximately equivalent to a dosage of 50 μg/day ethinylestradiol in terms of systemic estrogenic potency. Similarly to ethinylestradiol, DES shows a marked and disproportionately strong effect on liver protein synthesis. Whereas its systemic estrogenic potency was about 3.8-fold of that of estropipate (piperazine estrone sulfate), which has similar potency to micronized estradiol, the hepatic estrogenic potency of DES was 28-fold that of estropipate (or about 7.5-fold stronger potency for a dosage with equivalent systemic estrogenic effect).

DES has at least three mechanisms of action in the treatment of prostate cancer. It suppresses gonadal androgen production and hence circulating androgen levels due to its antigonadotropic effects; it stimulates hepatic sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) production, thereby increasing circulating levels of SHBG and decreasing the free fraction of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the circulation; and it may have direct cytotoxic effects in the testes and prostate gland. DES has also been found to decrease DNA synthesis at high doses.

DES is a long-acting estrogen, with a nuclear retention of around 24 hours.



====Antigonadotropic effects====

Due to its estrogenic activity, DES has antigonadotropic effects. That is, it exerts negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis), suppresses the secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and suppresses sex hormone production as well as gamete production or maturation in the gonads. A study of ovulation inhibition found that 5 mg/day oral DES was 92% effective, with ovulation occurring in only a single cycle. DES consistently suppresses testosterone levels in men into the castrate range (&lt;50 ng/dL) within 1 to 2 weeks at doses of 3 mg/day and above. Conversely, a dosage of 1 mg/day DES is unable to fully suppress testosterone levels into the castrate range in men, which instead often stabilize at just above castrate levels (&gt;50 ng/dL). However, it has also been reported that 1 mg/day DES results in approximately 50% suppression of testosterone levels, albeit with wide interindividual variability. It has been said that doses of DES of less than 1 mg/day have no effect on testosterone levels. However, the addition of an &quot;extremely low&quot; dosage of 0.1 mg/day DES to cyproterone acetate has been found to result in a synergistic antigonadotropic effect and to suppress testosterone levels into the castrate range in men. DES at 3 mg/day has similar testosterone suppression to a dose of 300 mg/day, suggesting that suppression of testosterone levels is maximal by 3 mg/day.

====Other activities====
In addition to the ERs, an &quot;in vitro&quot; study found that DES also possesses activity, albeit relatively weak, at a variety of other steroid hormone receptors. Whereas the study found EC50 values of 0.18 nM and 0.06 nM of DES for the ERα and ERβ, respectively, the medication showed significant glucocorticoid activity at a concentration of 1 μM that surpassed that of 0.1 nM dexamethasone, as well as significant antagonism of the androgen, progesterone, and mineralocorticoid receptors (75%, 85%, and 50% inhibition of positive control stimulation, respectively, all at a concentration of 1 μM). It also showed approximately 25% inhibition of the activation of PPARγ and LXRα at a concentration of 10 μM. The researchers stated that, to the best of their knowledge, they were the first to report such actions of DES, and hypothesized that these actions could be involved in the clinical effects of DES, for instance, in prostate cancer (notably in which particularly high dosages of DES are employed). However, they also noted that the importance of the activities requires further study in animal models at pharmacologically relevant doses.

DES has been identified as an antagonist of all three isotypes of the estrogen-related receptors (ERRs), the ERRα, ERRβ, and ERRγ. Half-maximal inhibition occurs at a concentration of about 1 μM.

===Pharmacokinetics===
DES is well-absorbed with oral administration. With an oral dosage of 1 mg/day DES, plasma levels of DES at 20 hours following the last dose ranged between 0.9 and 1.9 ng/mL (3.4 to 7.1 nmol/L). Sublingual administration of DES appears to have about the same estrogenic potency of oral DES in women. Intrauterine DES has been studied for the treatment of uterine hypoplasia. Oral DES is thought to have about 17 to 50% of the clinical estrogenic potency of DES by injection.

The distribution half-life of DES is 80 minutes. It has no affinity for SHBG or corticosteroid-binding globulin, and hence is not bound to these proteins in the circulation. The plasma protein binding of DES is greater than 95%.

Hydroxylation of the aromatic rings of DES and subsequent conjugation of the ethyl side chains accounts for 80 to 90% of DES metabolism, while oxidation accounts for the remaining 10 to 20% and is dominated by conjugation reactions. Conjugation of DES consists of glucuronidation, while oxidation includes dehydrogenation into (&quot;Z&quot;,&quot;Z&quot;)-dienestrol. The medication is also known to produce paroxypropione as a metabolite. DES produces transient quinone-like reactive intermediates that cause cellular and genetic damage, which may help to explain the known carcinogenic effects of DES in humans. However, other research indicates that the toxic effects of DES may simply be due to overactivation of the ERs. In contrast to estradiol, the hydroxyl groups of DES do not undergo oxidation into an estrone-like equivalent.

The elimination half-life of DES is 24 hours. The metabolites of DES are excreted in urine and feces.

==Chemistry==
DES belongs to the stilbestrol (4,4&#x27;-dihydroxystilbene) group of compounds. It is a nonsteroidal open-ring analogue of the steroidal estrogen estradiol. DES can be prepared from anethole, which also happens to be weakly estrogenic. Anethole was demethylated to form anol and anol then spontaneously dimerized into dianol and hexestrol, with DES subsequently being synthesized via structural modification of hexestrol. As shown by X-ray crystallography, the molecular dimensions of DES are almost identical to those of estradiol, particularly in regards to the distance between the terminal hydroxyl groups.

==History==

===Synthesis===
DES was first synthesized in early 1938 by Leon Golberg, then a graduate student of Sir Robert Robinson at the Dyson Perrins Laboratory at the University of Oxford. Golberg&#x27;s research was based on work by Wilfrid Lawson at the Courtauld Institute of Biochemistry, (led by Sir Edward Charles Dodds at Middlesex Hospital Medical School now part of University College London). A report of its synthesis was published in &quot;Nature&quot; on 5 February 1938.

DES research was funded by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC), which had a policy against patenting drugs discovered using public funds. Because it was not patented, DES was produced by more than 200 pharmaceutical and chemical companies worldwide.

===Clinical use===
DES was first marketed for medical use in 1939. It was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on September 19, 1941, in tablets up to 5 mg for four indications: gonorrheal vaginitis, atrophic vaginitis, menopausal symptoms, and postpartum lactation suppression to prevent breast engorgement. The gonorrheal vaginitis indication was dropped when the antibiotic penicillin became available. From its very inception, the drug was highly controversial.

In 1941, Charles Huggins and Clarence Hodges at the University of Chicago found estradiol benzoate and DES to be the first effective drugs for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. DES was the first cancer drug.

Orchiectomy or DES or both were the standard initial treatment for symptomatic advanced prostate cancer for over 40 years, until the GnRH agonist leuprorelin was found to have efficacy similar to DES without estrogenic effects and was approved in 1985.

From the 1940s until the late 1980s, DES was FDA-approved as estrogen replacement therapy for estrogen deficiency states such as ovarian dysgenesis, premature ovarian failure, and after oophorectomy.

In the 1940s, DES was used off-label to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with a history of miscarriage. On July 1, 1947, the FDA approved the use of DES for this indication. The first such approval was granted to Bristol-Myers Squibb, allowing use of 25 mg (and later 100 mg) tablets of DES during pregnancy. Approvals were granted to other pharmaceutical companies later in the same year. The recommended regimen started at 5 mg per day in the seventh and eighth weeks of pregnancy (from first day of last menstrual period), increased every other week by 5 mg per day through the 14th week, and then increased every week by 5 mg per day from 25 mg per day in the 15th week to 125 mg per day in the 35th week of pregnancy.
DES was originally considered effective and safe for both the pregnant woman and the developing baby. It was aggressively marketed and routinely prescribed. Sales peaked in 1953.

In the early 1950s, a double-blind clinical trial at the University of Chicago assessed pregnancy outcomes in women who were assigned to either receive or not receive DES. The study showed no benefit of taking DES during pregnancy; adverse pregnancy outcomes were not reduced in the women who were given DES. By the late 1960s, six of seven leading textbooks of obstetrics said DES was ineffective at preventing miscarriage.

Despite an absence of evidence supporting the use of DES to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes, DES continued to be given to pregnant women through the 1960s. In 1971, a report published in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; showed a probable link between DES and vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma in girls and young women who had been exposed to this drug &quot;in utero&quot;. Later in the same year, the FDA sent an FDA Drug Bulletin to all U.S. physicians advising against the use of DES in pregnant women. The FDA also removed prevention of miscarriage as an indication for DES use and added pregnancy as a contraindication for DES use. On February 5, 1975, the FDA ordered 25 mg and 100 mg tablets of DES withdrawn, effective February 18, 1975. The number of persons exposed to DES during pregnancy or &quot;in utero&quot; during the period of 1940 to 1971 is unknown, but may be as high as 2 million in the United States. DES was also used in other countries, most notably France, the Netherlands, and Great Britain.

From the 1950s through the beginning of the 1970s, DES was prescribed to prepubescent girls to begin puberty and thus stop growth by closing growth plates in the bones. Despite its clear link to cancer, doctors continued to recommend the hormone for &quot;excess height&quot;.

In 1960, DES was found to be more effective than androgens in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women. DES was the hormonal treatment of choice for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women until 1977, when the FDA approved tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator with efficacy similar to DES but fewer side effects.

Several sources from medical literature in the 1970s and 1980s indicate that DES was used as a component of hormone therapy for transgender women.

In 1973, in an attempt to restrict off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive (which had become prevalent at many university health services following publication of an influential study in 1971 in &quot;JAMA&quot;) to emergency situations such as rape, an &quot;FDA Drug Bulletin&quot; was sent to all U.S. physicians and pharmacists that said the FDA had approved, under restricted conditions, postcoital contraceptive use of DES.

In 1975, the FDA said it had not actually given (and never did give) approval to any manufacturer to market DES as a postcoital contraceptive, but would approve that indication for emergency situations such as rape or incest if a manufacturer provided patient labeling and special packaging as set out in a FDA final rule published in 1975. To discourage off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive, the FDA in 1975 removed DES 25 mg tablets from the market and ordered the labeling of lower doses (5 mg and lower) of DES still approved for other indications changed to state: &quot;This drug product should not be used as a postcoital contraceptive&quot; in block capital letters on the first line of the physician prescribing information package insert and in a prominent and conspicuous location of the container and carton label. In the 1980s, off-label use of the Yuzpe regimen of certain regular combined oral contraceptive pills superseded off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive.

In 1978, the FDA removed postpartum lactation suppression to prevent breast engorgement from their approved indications for DES and other estrogens. In the 1990s, the only approved indications for DES were treatment of advanced prostate cancer and treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women. The last remaining U.S. manufacturer of DES, Eli Lilly, stopped making and marketing it in 1997.

=== Trials ===
Diethylstilbestrol has been used countless times in studies on rats. Once it was discovered that DES was causing vaginal cancer, experiments began on both male and female rats. Many of these male rats were injected with DES while other male rats were injected with olive oil, and they were considered the control group. Each group received the same dosage on the same days, and the researchers performed light microscopy, electron microscopy, and confocal laser microscopy. With both the electron and confocal laser microscopy, it was prevalent that the Sertoli cells, which are somatic cells where spermatids develop in the testes, were formed 35 days later in the rats who were injected with Diethylstilbestrol compared to the rats in the control group. Proceeding the completion of the trial, it was understood that rats of older age who were injected with DES experienced delay in sertoli cell maturation, underdeveloped epididymides, and drastic decrease in weight compared to its counterparts.

The female rats used were inbred and most of them were given DES combined in their food. These rats were divided into three groups, one group who received no diethylstilbestrol, one group who had DES mixed into their diet, and the third group who had DES administered into their diet after day 13 of being pregnant. Some rats who were given DES unfortunately died before delivering their pup. The group that received DES in their food for 13 days while being pregnant resulted in early abortion and delivery failure. These outcomes showed that DES had a detrimental effect on pregnancy when administered as often as it was. Providing the dosing of diethylstilbestrol later in the pregnancy term also made visible the occurrence of abortions among the rats. Overall, any interaction with DES in female rats concluded in the rats&#x27; experiencing abortions, improper fetal growth, and the increase in sterility.

A review of people who had been treated or exposed to DES was done to find out what long-term effects would show. People for a long time had been treated during their pregnancy with DES, and there have been known to be toxic and adverse effects to the hormone therapy. &quot;Exposure to DES has been associated with an increased risk for breast cancer in DES mothers (relative risk, &lt;2.0) and with a lifetime risk of clear-cell cervicovaginal cancer in DES daughters of 1/1000 to 1/10 000.&quot; Side effects of DES are proving to be long-term as it can cause increased risks of cancer after use. There will be continued work to see how far the adverse effects of DES go after previous therapy and how it will affect offspring and the mothers longer-term.

=== Regulations ===
In 1938, the ability to test the safety of DES on animals was first obtained by the FDA. The results from the preliminary tests showed that DES harmed the reproductive systems of animals. The application of these results to humans could not be determined, so the FDA could not act in a regulatory manner.

New Drug Applications for DES approval were withdrawn in 1940 in a decision made by the FDA based on scientific uncertainty. However, this decision resulted in significant political pressure, so the FDA came to a compromise. The compromise meant that DES would be available only by prescription and would have to have warnings about its effects on the bottle, but the warning was dropped in 1945. In 1947, DES finally gained FDA approval for prescription to pregnant women who had diabetes as a method of preventing miscarriages. This led to the widespread prescription of DES to all pregnant women.

In 1971, the FDA recommended against the prescription of DES to pregnant women. As a result, DES then began to see a withdraw from the US market starting in 1972 and in the European market starting in 1978, but the FDA still did not withdraw its approval for the use of DES in humans.

DES was classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. After classification as a carcinogen, DES had its FDA approval withdrawn in 2000. DES is currently only in use for veterinary practices and in research trials as allowed by the FDA.

=== Medical ethics ===

Medical Ethics in regard to the approval and use of Diethylstilbestrol have been dismissed because of the actions of the FDA and pharmaceutical companies that were making DES at the time of its use. The Vice President of the American Drug Manufacturers Association, Carson Frailey, was employed by drug companies creating DES in order to help get it approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Nancy Langston, the author of The Retreat from Precaution: Regulating Diethylstilbestrol (DES), Endocrine Disruptors, and Environmental Health, states that &quot;Frailey persuaded fifty-four doctors from around the country to write to the FDA, describing their clinical experiences with a total of more than five thousand patients. Only four of these fifty-four doctors felt that DES should not be approved, and the result was that, against the concerns of many of the FDA medical staff, the FDA&#x27;s drug chief Theodore Klumpp recommended that the FDA approve DES.&quot; This excerpt describes how DES was unethically approved and shows that the motivation behind its approval was for the benefit of drug companies rather than the people who were going to use the drug. This approval of DES violates the values of medical ethics, autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice as there was little thought put into how DES would affect its users. The decisions made by the FDA leaders to approve DES without further study and convince doctors to dissimulate their opinions on the use of DES is unethical. Once DES was approved for public consumption the &quot;warnings [for DES were] made available only on a separate circular that patients would not see. Doctors could get this warning circular only by writing to the drug companies and requesting it. Letters between companies and FDA regulators reveal that both groups feared that if a woman ever saw how many potential risks DES might present, she might refuse to take the drug—or else she might sue the company and the prescribing doctors if she did get cancer or liver damage after taking the drug.&quot; Women were not informed about the possible effects of DES because doctors and FDA regulators were afraid DES would fail and never be approved costing the drug companies millions of dollars. The act of distributing potentially dangerous medicine to patients regardless of the effect and harm it may do solely for monetary gain is unethical.

===Lawsuits===
In the 1970s, the negative publicity surrounding the discovery of DES&#x27;s long-term effects resulted in a huge wave of lawsuits in the United States against its manufacturers. These culminated in a landmark 1980 decision of the Supreme Court of California, &quot;Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories&quot;, in which the court imposed a rebuttable presumption of market share liability upon all DES manufacturers, proportional to their share of the market at the time the drug was consumed by the mother of a particular plaintiff.

Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical company manufacturing DES, and the University of Chicago, had an action filed against them in regard to clinical trials from the 1950s. Three women filed the claim that their daughters had developments of abnormal cervical cellular formations as well as reproductive abnormalities in themselves and their sons. The plaintiffs had asked the courts to certify their case as a class action but were declined by the courts. However, the courts issued an opinion that their case had merit. The court held that Eli Lilly had a duty to notify about the risks of DES once they became aware of them or should have become aware of them. Under Illinois tort law, for the plaintiffs to recover under theories of breach of duty to warn and strict liability, the plaintiffs must have alleged injury to themselves. Ultimately, under their claims of breach of duty to warn and strict liability due to the plaintiffs citing risk of physical injury to others, not physical injury to themselves, the case was dismissed by the courts. Although the case was not certified as class action and their claims of breach of duty to warn and strict liability was dismissed, the courts did not dismiss the battery allegations. The issue was then to determine whether the University of Chicago had committed battery against these women but the case was settled before trial. Part of the settlement agreement for this case, Mink v. University of Chicago, attorneys for the plaintiffs negotiated for the university to provide free medical exams for all offspring exposed to DES in utero during the 1950 experiments as well as treat the daughters of any women involved who develop DES-associated vaginal or cervical cancer.

As of February 1991, there were over a thousand pending legal actions against DES manufacturers. There are over 300 companies that manufactured DES according to the same formula and the largest barrier to recovery is determining which manufacturer supplied the drug in each particular case. Many of the successful cases have relied on joint or several parties holding liability.

A lawsuit was filed in Boston Federal Court by 53 DES daughters who say their breast cancers were the result of DES being prescribed to their mothers while pregnant with them. Their cases survived a Daubert hearing. In 2013, the Fecho sisters who initiated the breast cancer/DES link litigation agreed to an undisclosed settlement amount on the second day of trial. The remaining litigants have received various settlements.

The advocacy group DES Action USA helped provide information and support for DES-exposed persons engaged in lawsuits.

==Society and culture==
Alan Turing, the ground-breaking cryptographer, founder of computing science and programmable computers, who also proposed the actual theoretical model of biological morphogenesis, was forcefully given this drug to induce chemical castration as a punitive and discredited &quot;treatment&quot; for homosexual behaviour, shortly before he died in ambiguous circumstances.

At least on one occasion in New Zealand in the early 1960s, diethylstilbestrol was prescribed for the &quot;treatment&quot; of homosexuality.

James Herriot describes a case regarding treating a small dog&#x27;s testicular Sertoli cell tumor in his 1974 book &quot;All Things Bright and Beautiful&quot;. Herriot decided to prescribe a high dose of stilboestrol for the recurring tumor, with the amusing side effect that the male dog became &quot;attractive to other male dogs&quot;, who followed the terrier around the village for a few weeks. Herriot comments in the story that he knew &quot;The new drug was said to have a feminising effect, but surely not to that extent.&quot;

==Veterinary use==

===Canine incontinence===
DES has been very successful in treating female canine incontinence stemming from poor sphincter control. It is still available from compounding pharmacies, and at the low (1 mg) dose, does not have the carcinogenic properties that were so problematic in humans. It is generally administered once a day for seven to ten days and then once every week as needed.

===Livestock growth promotion===
The greatest usage of DES was in the livestock industry, used to improve feed conversion in beef and poultry. During the 1960s, DES was used as a growth hormone in the beef and poultry industries. It was later found to cause cancer by 1971, but was not phased out until 1979. Although DES was discovered to be harmful to humans, its veterinary use was not immediately halted. As of 2011, DES was still being used as a growth promoter in terrestrial livestock or fish in some parts of the world including China.

<text>Boise Airport (Boise Air Terminal or Gowen Field) is a joint civil-military airport in the western United States in Idaho, south of downtown Boise in Ada County. The airport is operated by the city of Boise Department of Aviation, overseen by an airport commission. The busiest airport in the state, it serves more passengers than all other Idaho airports combined and roughly ten times as many passengers as the next busiest airport at Idaho Falls.

Boise is a landing rights airfield requiring international general aviation flights to receive permission from a Customs and Border Protection officer before landing.

In addition to being a commercial and general aviation airport, Boise also functions concurrently as a USAF military facility as used by the 124th Fighter Wing (124 FW) of the Idaho Air National Guard on the Gowen Field Air National Guard Base portion of the airport. The 124 FW operates the A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft.

The National Interagency Fire Center is based in the city of Boise and the Boise Airport is used for logistical support. The United States Forest Service (USFS) also uses Boise Airport as a base for aerial firefighting air tankers during the wildfire season.

Boise Airport enplaned 2,248,435 passengers in 2022, an increase of 24% vs. 2021 when 1,806,838 passengers were enplaned.

==Terminals and development ==
Boise Airport currently has one terminal with two concourses and servicing nine airlines. The terminal is a three-story building containing four baggage carousels, rental car counters on the ground floor, all of the ticketing counters, a consolidated security checkpoint including TSA PreCheck and CLEAR Security, offices and fast food outlets.

The two concourses have a combined 24 gates with 13 total jet bridges. Concourse B has 13 gates and 11 jet bridges (with one jet bridge serving each of B21 a/b and B22 a/b). Airline gate assignments are broken down as follows: B10, B11, B21 a/b (United), B15, B17 (Southwest), B14, B16, B19 (Common Use), B18 (American), B20, B22 a/b (Delta). The Common use gates are used as follows: B14 (United, Delta), B16 (Allegiant, southwest), B19 (American, Avelo, Spirit). Concourse C serves Alaska Airlines and has 11 gates; however, only gates C8a and C12 are equipped with jet bridges, with the rest having covered walkways.

In 2016, Boise Airport released a new master plan outlining their short, medium, and long-term plans. Each of these terms would mark different stages of the airport&#x27;s growth and renewal, with the largest projects being three new parking garages, upgrades to Concourse B, and a new Concourse A.

===Concourse A===

The new Concourse A would sit on the other side of the main terminal from concourses B and C in an existing employee parking lot. It would have ten new gates, all equipped with jet bridges and able to handle narrow-body aircraft. Long-term plans call for one of the new gates would be equipped to handle wide bodied aircraft, five equipped for narrowbody aircraft, and four equipped for regional jets up to an A220. Phase 1 of the new concourse is scheduled to begin construction by the end of 2022 and will include six gates, three for mainline aircraft and three for regional aircraft. The makeup of Phases 2 and 3 would depend on the needs of the airport and have not been determined yet.

===Parking garages===

Increasing passenger traffic at BOI requires the addition of parking. To this end, the airport is building three new parking garages. One will be a public garage for passengers with 940 spaces. This will be built on an existing surface lot. The other two garages, an employee garage and a rental car center garage, are being relocated to make room for Concourse A. The new employee garage will have 680 spaces and the rental car garage will have 880 spaces.
The airport has begun construction on its first two of the three parking garages. In late January 2022, it broke ground on the construction for the new employee parking garage after several delays, and its new public parking garage expansion. Both these projects plan to be finished by the end of 2023. The airport also plans to break ground on a new 2 part rental car garage in 2023, this will make room for the new Concourse A.

==History==
Boise&#x27;s first municipal airport, Booth Field, was built in 1926 on a gravel bed near the south bank of the Boise River, now the campus of Boise State University. The first commercial airmail flight in the United States passed through this airfield on April 26, 1926, carried by Varney Airlines. Varney began operating out of Boise in 1933, later merging with National Air Transport to become United Airlines. Since United traces its roots to Varney, United is recognized as the airline that has operated the longest out of Boise, years as of 2025. Less than four months after his historic transatlantic flight, the airfield hosted Charles Lindbergh and the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; 

The current airport has its origins in 1936 when Boise began buying and leasing land for the airport. By 1938, Boise had the longest runway in the United States at , built as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project under sponsorship of the city. The steel hangar for Varney Airlines was moved to the present field in 1939. As aircraft grew the hangar was no longer big enough and was converted into a passenger terminal. It was part of the modern terminal facility until the completion of a new terminal in 2004.

During World War II, the U.S. Army Air Forces leased the field for use as a training base for B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator bomber crews. More than six thousand men were stationed there during the war.

The field was named Gowen Field in 1941 on July 23, after 1st Lt Paul R. Gowen. Born and raised in Caldwell, he attended the University of Idaho for two years, then obtained an appointment to West Point in 1929, and graduated ninth in his class in 1933. While piloting a twin-engine B-10 bomber in the Army Air Corps, Gowen was killed instantly in a crash in Panama in July 1938. The right engine failed shortly after take-off from Albrook Field, near Panama City. The other two crew members, navigator and radio operator, survived and crawled from the wreckage with burns.

After the war the part of the field used by the Army Air Forces was returned to the city. The Idaho Air National Guard began leasing the airfield after the war and continues to do so.

===Jet service===
The jet age arrived in Boise during the mid-1960s. In 1966, United Airlines was operating Boeing 727-100 jetliners into the airport with round trip routings of Boise (BOI)-Salt Lake City (SLC)-Chicago (O&#x27;Hare, ORD)-Boston (BOS) and Seattle (SEA)-Portland (PDX)-Boise (BOI)-Salt Lake City (SLC)-Denver (Stapleton, DEN)-Chicago (ORD)-New York (Newark, EWR). United was also serving the airport with Douglas DC-6 and DC-6B propliners at this time. West Coast Airlines introduced Douglas DC-9-10 jet service during the late 1960s and in 1968 was operating round trip routings of Seattle (Boeing Field, BFI)-Portland (PDX)-Boise (BOI)-Salt Lake City (SLC) and Portland (PDX)-Seattle (BFI)-Boise (BOI)-Salt Lake City (SLC) West Coast was also serving Boise with Fairchild F-27 turboprops and Douglas DC-3 prop aircraft in 1968. The same year West Coast merged with Bonanza Air Lines and Pacific Air Lines to form Air West which was subsequently renamed Hughes Airwest which, in turn, continued to serve Boise with Douglas DC-9 (-10, -30) jets. In 1972, Hughes Airwest was operating non-stop DC-9 service from Boise to Portland and Salt Lake City and was also flying direct DC-9 service to Los Angeles (LAX), Las Vegas (LAS), Phoenix (PHX), San Diego (SAN), Burbank (BUR), Santa Ana (SNA), Spokane (GEG) and other regional destinations.

By 1976, Hughes Airwest and United were still the only two airlines operating jet service into Boise according to the Official Airline Guide (OAG). United had also expanded its Boise service by this time and was operating nonstop flights with Boeing 727 (-100, -200) and larger Douglas DC-8 jetliners to Chicago (O&#x27;Hare), Denver (Stapleton), Portland, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, Seattle, Reno, and Spokane as well as direct, no change of plane jet service to New York (LaGuardia), Los Angeles, Boston, Washington, D.C. (National), San Diego, and Hartford, according to the Official Airline Guide (OAG). United and Hughes Airwest were operating all of their flights into Boise with jet aircraft at this time in 1976. Also according to the OAG, in early 1985 Cascade Airways was operating international service of a sorts into Boise with a direct flight once a week from Calgary via intermediate stops in Spokane and Lewiston, ID.

Following the federal Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, a number of air carriers operated jet service into the airport at different times over the years from the late 1970s through the 1990s. The following list of airlines is taken from OAG editions from 1979 to 1999:

* Alaska Airlines (mainline jet service)
* America West Airlines
* Cascade Airways
* Continental Airlines
* Frontier Airlines (1950-1986)
* Horizon Air
* Morris Air
* Mountain West Airlines 
* Northwest Airlines

* Pacific Express
* Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA)
* Republic Airlines (1979-1986) (acquired Hughes Airwest in 1980)
* Sunworld International Airways (operating as Sunworld Airlines)
* United Express operated by Air Wisconsin
* US Airways 
* Western Airlines
* Wien Air Alaska
Between 2001 and 2005, Boise Airport was remodeled with a new terminal and an elevated roadway for departures, constructed in two phases. Phase 1 considered amenities such as baggage claim, lobby, and food and beverage concession, which were completed in 2003. Phase 2 dealt with security checkpoints and a new concourse (Concourse C) and the remodeling of Concourse B, which were completed in 2005.
The Boise Airport Passenger Terminal designed by CSHQA is a three-story, steel-framed state-of-the-art aviation facility. Curvilinear, steel trusses create the undulating ceiling plane of the ticket lobby and define the signature profile of the building. The terminal has garnered national attention for the beauty of its design and is considered a prototypical post-9/11 facility.

The Boise Airport was fourth in passenger satisfaction in the J.D. Power and Associates 2004 Global Airport Satisfaction Index Study. Power no longer publishes a global listing, and the airport was not listed in the 2017 North American ranking.

The Boise Airport was a hub for Horizon Air from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. Horizon Air was acquired by the Alaska Air Group, the parent company of Alaska Airlines, in 1986 and began code sharing flights for Alaska Airlines at that time. During the summer of 1990, Horizon Air was operating up to 36 departures a day from the airport to destinations in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, as well as direct one stop service to Salt Lake City. By 1999, Horizon Air was operating up to 22 departures a day from Boise with Fokker F28 Fellowship jets with additional flights being operated with de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 turboprops. The regional airline also previously operated Dornier 328, Fairchild F-27, and Swearingen Metroliner propjets. Boise is currently a focus city for Alaska Airlines service operated by both Horizon Air and code sharing partner SkyWest Airlines.

Boise was also one of the primary destinations served by Cascade Airways which competed with Horizon Air. In 1985, Cascade was serving the airport with British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven jets and Swearingen Metroliner propjets with regional service in Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and Montana, as well as nonstop jet service to Reno, Nevada, and connecting flights to Canada at Calgary, Alberta.

==Facilities==
Boise Airport covers at an elevation of at its east end. It has two runways and one helipad:

* 10L/28R: 10,000 x 150 feet (3,048 x 46 m), asphalt, weight capacity: /single wheel; VASI system
* 10R/28L: 9,763 x 150 feet (2,976 x 46 m), asphalt, weight capacity: /single wheel; VASI, ILS/DME
* Helipad H1: 50 feet by 50 feet (15 x 15m), asphalt. 
In the year ending May 31, 2023, the airport had 139,983 aircraft operations, average 383 per day: 46% general aviation, 39% airline, 9% air taxi, and 5% military. 273 aircraft were then based at this airport: 147 single-engine, 22 multi-engine, 37 jet, 17 helicopter and 50 military. Of the top 100 United States airports, BOI is among four airports that does not charge a PFC.

The airport can handle minor maintenance and repairs through fixed-base operators Jackson Jet Center, Turbo Air and Western Aircraft.

Law enforcement is handled by the Boise Police Department (BPD). In 2006, the Airport Division had an authorized strength of 1 lieutenant, 2 sergeants, and 28 officers, and there were five TSA certified K-9 units trained in explosive detection.

The original layout was the primary runway (10R/28L) with two others at , both are retired but still visible as taxiways. The north–south runway (offset slightly northeast) was aligned with present-day S. Zeppelin Street (approximately with Owyhee Street to the north), and the east–west runway was offset slightly southwest. The intersection point of the two former runways was on today&#x27;s main taxiway, near the terminal. The second parallel runway (10L/28R) was extended to the east in 1998.

===ATC tower===
In 2008, city officials broke ground for Boise Air Terminal&#x27;s new airport traffic control tower, the latest facilities improvement. The tower&#x27;s height at made it the tallest building in the state of Idaho until it was surpassed by the Zions Bank Idaho Headquarters Building in 2013 and the Northwest&#x27;s tallest control tower. It was relocated to the south side of the airport in order to control an existing Guard assault strip, runway 09/27, south of Gowen Field. The tower was planned and constructed when it was believed that the radar functions would be moved to Salt Lake City in Utah. After it was decided to leave the radar positions in Boise, the facility at the base of the tower was redesigned and partially remodeled to house the Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON).

The tower and TRACON opened on September 16, 2013, with updated electronics and equipment, including the STARS radar system; improving services and safety for pilots and the flying public. With the expanded facilities and new equipment, the TRACON operates the approach control for Boise Airport, and also remotely operates the approach control for the Bozeman Airport in Montana. The TRACON was then renamed Big Sky Approach to reflect the broader geographical coverage. The consolidation of Boise and Bozeman approach control facilities into Big Sky Approach is part of the FAA&#x27;s continuing plan to consolidate approach control services across the nation. Boise&#x27;s TRACON was designed with the option of adding additional radar scopes, and may offer approach control services to other airports in the future.

===Gowen Field Air National Guard Base===
Gowen Field Air National Guard Base primarily refers to the military facilities on the south side of the runways, which includes Air National Guard, Army National Guard, and reserve units of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. The field is home to the 124th Fighter Wing (124 FW), Idaho Air National Guard, which consists of one flying squadron operationally-gained by the Air Combat Command (ACC) and 12 additional support units. The aircraft based at Gowen Field ANGB is the A-10 Thunderbolt II close air support attack aircraft of the 190th Fighter Squadron (190 FS).

The 124 FW was previously designated as the 124th Wing (124 WG), a composite Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Mobility Command (AMC) unit that also operated C-130H Hercules transport aircraft in the 189th Airlift Squadron (189 AS), the 189 AS being operationally-gained by AMC.

BRAC 2005 directed that the Idaho Air National Guard divest itself of the C-130 mission by 2009, transferring its C-130s to the Wyoming Air National Guard, while retaining its A-10 fighter mission. This action was completed in 2009 and the 124 WG was redesignated the 124 FW at that time. The 124 FW is composed of over 1000 military personnel, consisting of just over 300 full-time Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) and Air Reserve Technician (ART) personnel and over 700 traditional part-time Air National Guardsmen.

===First responder training area===
In February 2011, FedEx donated a surplus Boeing 727-200 cargo jet (tail number N275FE) to the City of Boise for use as a training tool for emergency first responders. The aircraft—stripped of engines—is parked near the southeastern end of Boise&#x27;s third runway—a location more than a mile southeast of, and not visible from, the main passenger terminal. Several agencies use the plane for training purposes.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On June 13, 1961, an Idaho Air National Guard North American F-86L crashed shortly after takeoff; the pilot ejected, was critically injured, and later recovered. The wreckage damage was limited to several acres of grassland fire.
*Ten days later on June 23, 1961, another air guard F-86L was lost, this time while preparing to land, about south of the runway. The pilot ejected safely and escaped injury, but the wreckage damaged the mainline tracks of the Union Pacific railroad.
*On June 19, 1970, a Grumman TBM (N7026C) was on fire (engine, cockpit) and attempting to return to the airport when it crashed about southeast. A naval aviator and Vietnam War veteran, the pilot bailed out at low altitude, but his parachute failed to deploy, and he was killed.
*On December 28, 1970, a de Havilland DH125 (N36MK) made a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) about northeast of the airport, at an elevation of approximately above sea level. The corporate jet of Morrison Knudsen was returning from Billings, Montana, where four passengers were dropped off. No passengers were on board at the time of the crash, more than an hour after sunset, which killed both experienced pilots.
*On August 1, 1974, a Douglas B-26B (N91354) and a Beechcraft M24R (N2529W) collided on the ground while both were taxiing. The pilot of the light plane was killed, crushed under the bomber after the bomber&#x27;s nose gear collapsed. The B-26 had just arrived from Twin Falls, over an hour prior to sunset, and was headed for the Boise Interagency Fire Center; badly burned, its pilot was airlifted to Salt Lake City, but succumbed three days later.
*On November 16, 1991, a Cessna 402B (N29517) lost power in its starboard engine shortly after take-off from runway 10L, attempted to return, and crashed a mile (1.6 km) south of the airport, killing the pilot and his daughter, the only passenger. Bound for Pocatello, the air taxi cargo flight occurred over four hours prior to sunrise on Saturday.
*On December 9, 1996, a Douglas C-47A (N75142) of Emery Worldwide crashed on approach to runway 28(L/R), killing the only two crew members on board. The aircraft was on a cargo flight to Salt Lake City after sunset when the starboard engine caught fire shortly after take-off from runway 10L and the decision was made to return to Boise.
*On February 3, 2012, a Lancair IV-PT turboprop (N321LC) flown by Steve Appleton, CEO of Micron Technology, crashed shortly after take-off from runway 10R, killing the pilot. Attempting an emergency landing, Appleton had aborted an earlier take-off attempt for unknown the accident was attributed to pilot error.
* On January 31, 2024, a steel-framed hangar owned by Jackson Jet Center that was under construction collapsed at the airport, killing three people and injuring nine others. As of April 21, 2024 the OSHA investigation is on-going.
* On April 9, 2024, Air Canada Flight #997 from Mexico City to Vancouver declared an in-flight emergency and made an unscheduled landing in Boise. Airport staff deboarded the plane and assisted passengers through U.S. Customs, according to the city; border patrol officials were onsite to help assist with proper entry into the United States. The city and the airport have not released what caused the unscheduled landing; no injuries were reported.

<text>The following is an overview of events in 2007 in film, including the highest-grossing films, award ceremonies and festivals, a list of films released and notable deaths. The highest-grossing film of the year was &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;, which was just marginally ahead of &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;. 2007 is often considered one of the greatest years for film in the 21st century. It was also the last year to never have a film gross $1 billion until 2020.

==Evaluation of the year==
In his article from April 18, 2017, which highlighted the best movies of 2007, critic Mark Allison of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; said, &quot;2007 must surely be remembered as one of the finest years in English-language film-making, quite possibly the best of this century so far. Like 1939, 1976, or 1994, it was one of those years in which a succession of veritable classics came into being. So many, in fact, that some of the best examples were cruelly overlooked by the hype machine of the day.&quot; He also emphasized, &quot;If 2007 proves anything, it&#x27;s that classic films aren&#x27;t just a relic of ages past; they&#x27;re being made all around us. I can&#x27;t wait to see what we&#x27;re watching in another ten years&#x27; time.&quot;

Critic Craig Johnson from the film review and movie list website &quot;Taste of Cinema&quot; said in an article from December 16, 2014, &quot;For one glorious year, it (2007) was like the 1970s all over again. Smart characters were using their brains as weapons. Movie stars were challenging themselves with tough roles. Punches were not pulled. Happy endings were not guaranteed. There was a parade of intelligent movies, seemingly made for adults to watch while the kids were watching Transformers&quot;.

<doc id="294980" wikidata="Q8975" url="?curid=294980" title="Newcastle International Airport">
<text>Newcastle International Airport is an international airport serving Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Located approximately from Newcastle City Centre, it is the primary and busiest airport in North East England, and the second busiest in Northern England. In 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Newcastle International handled 5.2 million passengers annually.

Newcastle Airport has a Civil Aviation Authority Public Use Aerodrome Licence (Number P725) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction.

In 2019, it was named the best airport in Europe of those serving 515million passengers annually by Airports Council International (ACI) for the second consecutive year.

==Ownership==
The airport is owned by seven local authorities (51%) and AMP Capital (49%). The seven local authorities are: City of Newcastle, City of Sunderland, Durham County Council, Gateshead MBC, North Tyneside MBC, Northumberland County Council, and South Tyneside MBC. In October 2012 Copenhagen Airport sold its stake in the airport to AMP Capital.

==Area served==
The airport mainly serves the counties of Tyne and Wear, County Durham, and Northumberland in North East England, as well as Cumbria in North West England, and the Scottish Borders area of southern Scotland. The airport competes with the smaller Teesside International Airport for passengers travelling from and to County Durham and the Teesside area of North Yorkshire. The nearest similar-sized airports are Edinburgh, Glasgow and Leeds Bradford.

==History==
===Early years===

In 1929, Newcastle-upon-Tyne City Council set up a special committee to investigate the potential for building an airport to serve the North-East of England, considering 18 locations before selecting a site at Woolsington, about northwest of the city centre. The airport was opened on 26 July 1935 as Woolsington Aerodrome by the Secretary of State for Air, Sir Phillip Cunliffe-Lister. Incorporating a clubhouse, hangar, workshops, fuel garage and grass runway, it cost £35,000 to build. The airport became the base for the Newcastle upon Tyne Flying Club, which moved from its previous home at Cramlington Aerodrome and ran the new airport on behalf of the council. On 1 June 1939, No. 43 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School, operated by Newcastle Flying Club and equipped with a mixture of de Havilland Tiger Moths, Miles Magisters and Hawker Hinds opened at Woolsington, as one of a large number of civil-operated flying schools set up to train aircrew for the RAF. The school was disbanded on 3 September 1939, with the outbreak of the Second World War.

In 1940, the airfield was occasionally used to operate detachments of Supermarine Spitfire fighters from RAF Acklington-based 72 Squadron. On 25 July that year, No. 83 Maintenance Unit RAF, tasked with recovering crashed aircraft and salvaging any usable parts, was formed at Woolsington, remaining operational until April 1946. The airfield was also used as a base for the single Tiger Moth of the Durham University Air Squadron from February 1941, and from 1942 to 1943 by detachments from No. 278 Squadron RAF, operating Westland Lysander and Supermarine Walrus in the air sea rescue role. No. 281 Squadron RAF, another air sea rescue squadron, operated from Woolsington from June to October 1943, while from November 1943 to June 1945, the airfield was used as a satellite field for No. 62 OTU, based at RAF Ouston. Woolsington was handed back to the council in 1946.

In 1967, the construction of a new runway and terminal was completed, along with an apron and a new air traffic control tower. These new additions were officially opened by the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson on 17 February 1967.

In 1978, with passenger figures approaching one million per year, the airport was designated as a regional international hub airport in the UK government&#x27;s White Paper on Airports Policy, opening the way for further redevelopment; in the same decade it was re-branded as Newcastle Airport. The 1980s saw further investment in check-in, catering and duty-free shops. In 1991, Airport Metro station opened, connecting the airport with Newcastle Newcastle City Centre and Sunderland using the Tyne and Wear Metro system.

===Since the 2000s===
In August 2004, an extended and refurbished Departure Terminal was opened. The refurbishment included a 3,000 square metre extension with new shops, cafes and 1,200 new seats for waiting passengers.

In 2006, a record 5.4 million passengers used the airport, according to Civil Aviation Authority figures.

Rapid expansion in passenger traffic has led to increasing commercial use of the south side of the airport. This was previously used for general aviation, but is now used for freight, mail and corporate flights. This is partially due to difficulties obtaining departure and arrival slots for light aircraft traffic, which need to be separated from larger aircraft to protect against wake turbulence. As part of the Airport Master Plan, the south-side area is to be expanded with maintenance facilities including new hangar and apron areas.

In January 2007, it was announced that Emirates were to begin a daily non-stop service to Dubai from the airport. This service started on 7 September 2007 and has operated ever since. Until 2012, the route was flown by an Airbus A330. Since September 2012 it has been flown by a Boeing 777. Also in 2007, now defunct carrier Flyglobespan shortly connected Newcastle with Hamilton, Ontario, through this serving the greater Toronto area. Services were discontinued the same summer.

In 2012, Air Transat cut its route linking Newcastle with Toronto-Pearson, which had operated for several years. Through this, Newcastle was left without any transatlantic service.

On 23 May 2015, United Airlines commenced its summer seasonal route from Newcastle to New York-Newark, which was a huge achievement for the airport and the region. The service operated five times per week onboard B757-2 through September. However, in August 2016, United Airlines announced it would discontinue its seasonal route from Newark to Newcastle in 2017 after operating for just two consecutive seasons, citing economic reasons.

In July 2017, it was announced that the airport would be investing £3 million on a terminal expansion project which is part of overall £20 million improvement plans running from 2016 to 2017. This £20m improvement plan included a new radar system alongside digital signage in the check-in areas and the installation of new flooring. The £3m plan includes an extension to the terminal by 4,800 sq ft (450 m2) and will increase the equipment in the security hall, bringing in improved technology to speed up procedures there. This was due to be constructed over the winter of 2017/2018.

Until 2019, Jet2.com frequently linked its base in Newcastle with Newark during Christmas time. However, these services have not been resumed since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

In August 2020, easyJet announced the closure of their crew base in Newcastle due to the financial difficulties from the COVID-19 pandemic which means that the airline only operates domestic flights from the airport after scrapping all of its international routes by 31 August 2020. However, since this decision the airline resumed its operations to Palma de Mallorca and Geneva in 2022 as well as Alicante, Amsterdam and Paris Charles de Gaulle in 2024. As well as introducing a winter seasonal route to Lyon in 2025.

In March 2022, Ryanair opened its new base at Newcastle and announced 10 new routes which meant that the airline would operate a total of 19 routes, with over 130 weekly flights over Summer 2022 using two based aircraft.

In April 2023, TUI announced its biggest ever programme at the airport for summer 2024, operating up to 84 weekly flights to a total of 31 destinations on offer using an additional fifth aircraft, including new routes to Sal, Cape Verde and Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt.

In May 2023, Jet2.com announced their biggest ever Winter schedule for Newcastle Airport, with over 45 weekly flights. Destinations that have seen increases in the number of flights include Tenerife, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote and Alicante.

== Facilities ==
Newcastle Airport Freight Village is south of the airport and includes Emirates SkyCargo, FedEx, and North East Air Cargo company offices which deal with freight exports and imports and mail. It also houses freight forwarding agents such as Casper Logistics Ltd, Kintetsu World Express, Kuehne + Nagel, Nippon Express, Schenker International, Davis Turner Air Cargo, and Universal Forwarding.

In April 2016, Emirates reported that flown exports have soared to £310million per year since the arrival of the Emirates service from Newcastle to Dubai. The Dubai route contributes some £600m to the economy and has opened new export avenues to North East firms, some of whom have opened offices in the United Arab Emirates.

The airport is also home to the Newcastle Airport Fire Academy. The Newcastle Aviation Academy is also located within this area. When Gill Airways operated, its head office was in the New Aviation House, on the airport property. The south side of the airport also has a base for the National Police Air Service. They normally have one respective helicopter based here at a time but are known to rotate their fleet around bases. The area also holds maintenance workshops for the airport and various other depots for airport-run services like Alpha Catering.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===
The following airlines operate regular scheduled services to and from Newcastle upon Tyne:


== Statistics ==
The airport saw significant growth in the ten years to 2007, when passenger numbers peaked at 5.65 million, more than double the number handled ten years earlier. Passenger numbers declined in the subsequent four years due to the financial crisis of 2007–2010, but later recovered, with around 5.3 million passengers passing through the airport in 2018 (close to the 2006 total), although cargo volumes have broadly increased to record levels since 2005.


===Busiest routes===
== Accidents and incidents ==
On 30 November 2000, a Piper Aerostar registered N64719 en route to Iceland from Newcastle International Airport, crashed close to Fortingall, on the north side of Loch Tay in Perthshire, Scotland, killing the single crewmember. The accident report concluded that the aircraft gradually lost airspeed during an icing encounter, before stalling and the pilot losing control.

==Ground transport==
The Newcastle Airport Metro station is directly connected to the terminal through an indoor walkway. The station is the northern terminus of the green line of the Tyne and Wear Metro, with frequent direct services to the city centres of Newcastle and Sunderland (approximately 20 and 50 minutes respectively), as well as to many other towns within Tyne and Wear. Connection to the National Rail network is available at .

The airport is served by a number of bus routes. A half-hourly bus service links the airport to the nearby villages of Ponteland and Darras Hall, as well as to the City Centre.

The airport is connected to the A1 trunk road by the A696 dual carriageway.

<doc id="294982" wikidata="Q2102346" url="?curid=294982" title="2003 Belgian federal election">
<text>Federal elections were held in Belgium on 18 May 2003, the first under a new electoral code. One of the novelties was an electoral threshold of 5, which has cost many seats to the N-VA and the Green parties, Ecolo and Agalev. The Belgian Socialists recovered well; the liberal and nationalist parties increased their vote as well.

The Flemish Greens lost all their seats. The Greens were attacked on two fronts: some, including their coalition partners, accused them of being too fundamentalist, while others said that they had betrayed their ideals. The resignation of a Walloon green minister (Isabelle Durant), one week before the elections, probably didn&#x27;t do them much good either. Although it was predicted in some opinion polls, the gains of the Front National were surprising, considering that it seldom appeared in the media. The most important trend was the recovery of the Flemish social-democrats, led by the popular (some would say populist) Steve Stevaert. The fact that Elio Di Rupo was learning Dutch caused rumours that he hoped to become prime minister, if the social-democrats would turn out to be the largest political family.

Themes that probably influenced the election results in some way were the government&#x27;s opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the controversy around the nuisance around the airport of Zaventem, the controversy surrounding the banning of tobacco publicity, and unemployment, but a general dominating theme was lacking.

<doc id="294984" wikidata="Q5081955" url="?curid=294984" title="Charles Read (naval officer)">
<text>Charles William Read (May 12, 1840 – January 25, 1890), known commonly as &quot;Savez&quot;, was an officer in the antebellum United States Navy and then in the Confederate Navy during the American Civil War. He was nicknamed the &quot;Seawolf of the Confederacy&quot; for his exploits and daring.

==Early life and career==
Charles William Read was born in Satartia, Mississippi in 1840. He was appointed to the United States Naval Academy in 1856 and graduated in 1860. He served briefly aboard USS &quot;Powhatan&quot; after graduation.

==American Civil War==
At the outbreak of the American Civil War Read resigned his commission with the United States Navy and accepted a position with the Confederate States Navy. Read was initially assigned to the at New Orleans, Louisiana as a midshipman and participated in the battle between batteries on Ship Island and the on July 9, 1861. On October 12, 1861, he participated in the attack on the Union blockading squadron at Head of the Passes on the Mississippi River. When the commander of the CSS &quot;McRae&quot; was wounded on April 24, 1862, Read took command of the ship.

Read then served as executive officer of the during its actions against a blockading fleet of over 30 ships on the Mississippi River near Vicksburg, Mississippi on 13 July 1862. Read served as acting commander of the &quot;Arkansas&quot; during her final battle supporting the Confederate Army assaulting Baton Rouge, Louisiana on 6 August 1862. After the sinking of the &quot;Arkansas&quot;, Read travelled by foot to Port Hudson, Louisiana and assisted with the emplacement of shore guns there.

Read was soon ordered to Mobile, Alabama and was assigned to the which set sail on 15 January 1863. He transferred to the , a captured prize of the &quot;Florida&quot;, and set out on his own. During this raiding mission, which lasted from 6 June 1863 to 27 June 1863, Read transferred his command to prize vessels twice more, once to the and finally to the .

At the end of the raid, Lieutenant Read had captured or destroyed twenty-two United States vessels. He and his crew were captured off Portland, Maine on June 27, 1863, while attempting to take the . Read was held at Fort Warren, Massachusetts, until he was exchanged at Cox Wharf, Virginia, on October 18, 1864.

After his release, Read participated in naval and land operations on the James River, he commanded the and two other torpedo boats at the Battle of Trent&#x27;s Reach. In January 1865, he was assigned to the at Shreveport, Louisiana with the intention that she become a raider in the Pacific Ocean. Read did not reach the &quot;Webb&quot; until 22 April 1865. Read attempted to break out to the Gulf of Mexico but grounded in shallow waters near New Orleans on April 23, 1865. Read fired the ship to prevent its capture by Federal forces. Read surrendered to Federal naval authorities in New Orleans and was transported again to Fort Warren. He was released on July 24, 1865.

==Later life==
In 1867, Read was second officer aboard a ship involved in an effort to help Cuban rebels overthrow the Spanish government of the island. Read and others were arrested by the US government but were quickly released.

He was later hired by Charles Flynt to train Peru in the use of torpedoes. Read was commissioned as an Commander in the Peruvian Navy and much like John Randolph Tucker, received disdain from within the Peruvian Navy due to their jealousy of a foreigner being hired in a position of command.

Read earned his nickname &quot;Savvy&quot; or &quot;Savez&quot; due to his constant use of the term.

Charles Read died on January 25, 1890, in Meridian, Mississippi, and was interred at Rose Hill Cemetery.

<text>Köthen was a district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) in the middle of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Neighboring districts were (from north clockwise) Anhalt-Zerbst, Schönebeck, Anhalt-Zerbst, the district-free city Dessau, Bitterfeld, Saalkreis and Bernburg.

== History ==

In 1603 the principality of Anhalt-Köthen was created, when the principality of Anhalt was split in five parts. In 1665 it merged with Anhalt-Plötzkau, and in 1807 it became a duchy. 1847 it was divided between Anhalt-Dessau and Anhalt-Bernburg, and in 1853 it was merged with Anhalt-Dessau to form the Duchy of Anhalt-Dessau-Köthen.

When in 1863 the various parts of Anhalt were reunited, the district was created. At first the district &quot;Dessau-Köthen&quot; did cover the area surrounding the two district-free cities Dessau and Köthen. In 1950 the city of Köthen was added to the district, and it was renamed after its capital. As result of the district reform of 2007, the area was merged into the new district of Anhalt-Bitterfeld with the city of Köthen as its capital.

== Geography ==
The district is located in the &quot;Magdeburger Börde&quot;, with soft hills from the moraines from the last ice age. The river Elbe forms part of the northern boundary of the district.
