<text>Prescot is a town and civil parish within the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley in Merseyside, United Kingdom. It lies about to the east of Liverpool city centre. At the 2001 Census, the civil parish population was 11,184 (5,265 males, 5,919 females). The population of the larger Prescot East and West wards at the 2011 census totalled 14,139.
Prescot marks the beginning of the A58 road which runs through to Wetherby, near Leeds in West Yorkshire. The town is served by Prescot railway station and Eccleston Park railway station in neighbouring Eccleston.

==History==
Prescot&#x27;s name is believed to be derived from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;prēost&quot; &quot;priest&quot; + &quot;cot&quot; &quot;cot&quot;, meaning a cottage or small house owned or inhabited by a priest, a &quot;priest-cottage&quot;. (ME prest, preste, priest, OE prēost, LL presbyter, Gk πρεσβύτερος presbýteros &quot;elder, priest&quot;).

In the 14th century, William Dacre, 2nd Baron Dacre, obtained a charter for the holding of a three-day market and moveable fair at Prescot, to begin on the Wednesday following Corpus Christi.

In 1593, the English political philosopher Gerrard Winstanley&#x27;s parents, Edward and Isabell Winstanley, originally from Wigan, were married in Prescot.

From the mid-1590s to 1609, Prescot was home to the Prescot Playhouse, a purpose-built Shakespearean theatre, probably located on Eccleston Street. In the sixteenth century it was a small town of about 400 inhabitants, and not much bigger by the late seventeenth century.

During the 18th and 19th centuries it was at the centre of the watch and clock-making industry. This ended with the failure of the Lancashire Watch Company in 1910. In later years the BICC company was the primary industrial employer in the town. BICC ceased operations in Prescot in the early 1990s before the site was demolished and later cleared. The land remained desolate until 2000 when it was then regenerated into what is now known as Cables Retail Park, the name of which is a reference to the BICC and the history of the site on which it was built.

==Governance==

Prescot has historically lain within the historic county of Lancashire. The town was contained in the Prescot Urban District in the administrative county of Lancashire from 1894.

When the administrative counties were abolished in 1974 the district became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley in the metropolitan county of Merseyside. It is currently served by Prescot Town Council and Knowsley Metropolitan Borough Council. The current iteration of Prescot Town Hall is a converted public house: the conversion works were completed in 2014.

==Churches==
The centre of Prescot has six churches. Dominating the skyline is the 17th-century Prescot Parish Church of St Mary&#x27;s is the only Grade I listed building in the borough of Knowsley. Tucked away behind St Mary&#x27;s is the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady and St Joseph designed by Joseph Aloysius Hansom, inventor of the Hansom Cab. Prescot Methodist Church celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2009, but the building has since been converted into apartments. The congregation continues to exist, however, meeting in the adjacent church hall, known as Prescot Methodist Centre which has now been converted into a church. Also in the town are a Salvation Army church, an Elim Pentecostal church (Prescot Community Church) and the Zion Independent Methodist Church. Outside the centre, in the Portico area of the town is the Catholic Our Lady Help of Christians Church.

Places of worship shut down or moved over the past 20 years include the United Reformed church, the Kingdom Hall (Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses), the Plymouth Brethren Gospel Hall and an independent charismatic church called simply Prescot Christian Fellowship.

==Tourism, leisure and places of interest==
Prescot Museum houses a permanent exhibition about the history of clock and watch-making in the town, and several temporary exhibitions per year. The Georgian building is now also home to Knowsley Council&#x27;s Arts and Events Service.

On the edge of the town is the famous estate of Lord Derby, which includes Knowsley Safari Park.

In recent years, a number of cultural and arts events have been established in the town, including the annual 10-day Prescot Festival of Music and the Arts and an annual Elizabethan Fayre.

The Shakespeare North Trust promotes William Shakespeare&#x27;s historic connection with the town, a subject being researched at Liverpool&#x27;s John Moores University. Inspired by the historic Prescot Playhouse, the Trust has built the Shakespeare North complex in Prescot, including a Shakespearean playhouse and an educational centre. In April 2016, Knowsley Council granted planning permission for the new playhouse. Construction work on the new The Shakespeare North Playhouse was completed in late 2022.

Stone Street,() running between High Street and Eccleston Street, is just 26 inches wide at its southern end and is one of the narrowest streets in Britain.

==Sport==
The area&#x27;s local football team Prescot Cables currently play in the Northern Premier League Premier Division at Valerie Park.
Prescot &amp; Odyssey Cricket Club is located near Knowsley Safari Park.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Merseyside, Heart North West, Capital North West &amp; Wales, Hits Radio Liverpool, Smooth North West, and Greatest Hits Radio Liverpool &amp; The North West. The town is served by the local newspapers: &quot;Prescot &amp; Knowsley Reporter&quot; and &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot;.

<text>Kirkby ( ) is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley, Merseyside, England. The town, historically in Lancashire, has a size of is north of Huyton and north-east of Liverpool. The population in 2016 was 41,495 making it the largest in Knowsley and the 9th biggest settlement in Merseyside.

Evidence of Bronze Age activity has been noted though the first direct evidence of a settlement dates to 1086 via the Domesday Book. The town was mainly farmland until the mid-20th century until the construction of ROF Kirkby, the largest Royal Ordanance Factory filling munitions, during the Second World War; Kirkby&#x27;s urban development happened in the post-war period.

In November 2020, Liverpool F.C. relocated its training facilities from the Melwood site in West Derby, to the town following the completion of the new AXA Training Centre.

==History==

Archaeological evidence of Bronze Age settlement indicates that Kirkby was founded around 870 AD.
Historically, it has been part of Lancashire. Kirk-by derives from the Northern dialect of Old English word &quot;Kirk&quot; (&#x27;church&#x27;) and &quot;by&quot; (settlement or village; cognate with Old Norse &quot;byr&quot;). Settlers arrived via Ireland around 900. The first direct evidence of a settlement dates from 1086 and the Domesday Book, with a reference to &quot;Cherchebi&quot; (population 70). Ownership of present-day Kirkby (established as the West Derby hundred in the 11th century) passed through a number of hands until 1596, when the Molyneux family purchased the hundred. After a brief loss of patronage in 1737 (when the head of the family took holy orders), in 1771, Charles Molyneux became the 1st Earl of Sefton and regained the land.
Although it remained largely farmland until the mid-20th century, transport links to the region began in 1848 with the building of the Liverpool and Bury Railway through Kirkby. The East Lancashire Road (the A580) added a road connection in 1935, and industrial development was considered before the Second World War. ROF Kirkby, a Royal Ordnance Factory, was established in 1939 and completed in 1941. At its peak, the factory employed over 20,000 workers.

Liverpool had received much damage by the end of the war, and much of the remaining housing stock were slums. The Liverpool Corporation began a policy of buying land in surrounding areas and moving industry (and people) to newly developed &quot;overspill&quot; estates. This process culminated with the purchase of of land, including Kirkby, from the Earl of Sefton in 1947 for £375,000 (£ adjusted for inflation). Kirkby became Merseyside&#x27;s largest over-spill estates. A 1949 Liverpool proposal to have Kirkby designated a new town was rejected. Large-scale development began in February 1950 with the construction of the Southdene neighbourhood; the first houses were finished in 1952, the 5,000th in 1956, and the 10,000th in 1961. A population of 3,000 in 1951 grew to over 52,000 by 1961. The Kirkby Urban District was created in 1958. Its population grew between the 1950s and the 1970s due to over-spill housing for Liverpool.

Growth caused a number of problems, including a lack of local amenities. Although occupation of Southdene&#x27;s council estates had begun in 1952, its first shops were not completed until 1955 and its first pub did not open until 1959. The people who were being moved into Kirkby during this period came from Liverpool&#x27;s poorest areas. Kirkby Industrial Estate expanded to become one of England&#x27;s largest; at its peak in 1971, the estate employed over 26,000 people.

Kirkby became an Urban District in 1958. This status was later abolished, and on 1 April 1974 Kirkby was combined with Huyton with Roby and Prescot Urban District and parts of Whiston and West Lancashire Rural Districts to form the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley.

==Government==

Kirkby has been represented in Parliament as part of the Knowsley constituency since 2010. The town has been represented by Labour Party MP Anneliese Midgley since 2024. She was preceded by George Howarth (Labour, 1986–2024), Robert Kilroy-Silk (Labour, 1974–1986), Harold Soref (Conservative, 1970–1974) and Harold Wilson (Labour, 1950–1970).

Kirkby is divided into four districts: Southdene, Westvale, Northwood and Tower Hill. Its electoral wards, which do not coincide with the districts, are Cherryfield, Kirkby Central, Northwood, Park, Shevington and Whitefield. Kirkby&#x27;s 18 local councillors belong to the Labour Party, and often run unopposed.

==Geography==
Kirkby is north-east of Liverpool, in Merseyside in North West England. It is north-west of London and north-west of Huyton, the borough administrative headquarters. The River Alt flows through the town&#x27;s extreme south-west, with the Kirkby Brook tributary passing through its centre.

===Climate===
Due to its position near England&#x27;s north-west coast, Kirkby has a temperate maritime climate; its Köppen climate classification is Cfb. Its mean annual temperature of is similar to that throughout the Mersey basin and slightly cooler than the English average. The annual average sunshine duration, 1394.6 hours, is slightly higher than the UK average of 1339.7. January is the coldest month, with an average mean temperature of ; July is the hottest, at . Rainfall, , is slightly lower than the England average of and much lower than the UK average of . October is the wettest month, with an average rainfall of ; April is the driest, with of rain. The nearest Met Office weather station is at Manchester Airport.


==Demographics==
Kirkby&#x27;s population was 42,744 in the 2011 census. This was just over a quarter of the total population of the borough of Knowsley and was down from its peak of 52,207 in the 1961 census, largely due to a falling birth rate and the slow decline of the industrial estate. Housing demand has increased, however, with significant developments built across the town. Part of the demand may be attributed to a need for replacement housing stock due to the demolition of high-rise flats and maisonettes, built during the 1960s and now in disrepair.

According to British government statistics, the borough of Knowsley (including Kirkby) had a population of 145,900 in the 2011 census and a gender balance of 52.6 per cent female to 47.4 per cent male. This is down from 150,459 in the 2001 census. The borough has a white population of 98.42 per cent, compared with the national average of 90.9 per cent. Other ethnic groups are multiracial (0.83 per cent), Chinese (0.24 per cent), other Asian (0.23 per cent) and Black (0.22 per cent). A large proportion of the population is of Irish Catholic descent as a result of immigration into Liverpool.

The borough is mostly Christian (85.63 per cent), compared to the national average of 71.74 per cent. The next-largest group (5.84 per cent) describe themselves as non-religious, significantly lower than the national average of 14.59 per cent. Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and Jews are 0.17, 0.11, 0.07 and 0.03 per cent of the population.
===Population changes===

Kirkby&#x27;s population was on a gradual downward trend from 1861 to 1931 before it rose when the Liverpool Corporation began to develop the region. Its annual growth rate from 1951 to 1961 was over 30 per cent, making it England&#x27;s fastest-growing town by far. Kirkby&#x27;s population peaked in 1971 at 59,917, before declining. The town&#x27;s population has again begun to increase.

==Economy==

Kirkby Industrial Estate, formerly ROF Kirkby, is still a large employer. The town&#x27;s industrial heritage, however, has largely faded away as service industries replace factories. Major employers include QVC and Barclaycard, and several call centre companies are based in Kirkby.

===Regeneration===
Kirkby has seen regeneration efforts. The Kirkby Sports Centre, one of the region&#x27;s main velodromes and athletic centres, was replaced in 2007 by a leisure facility without a track. Several new stores have opened.

The regeneration began in December 2006, when a proposal was made by Tesco and Everton F.C. for redevelopment of the town centre which included a 50,000-seat football stadium and retail outlets. The proposal was known as The Kirkby Project. Kirkby Market was redeveloped, and reopened on 26 April 2014.

In 2015, the town centre owned by Tesco was bought by St. Modwen Properties for £35.8 million. St Modwen announced their plans for the regeneration of the town centre, including a cinema, a supermarket, parking, and leisure development. This led to reports that two supermarkets were competing to build a store; it was rumoured that one of the stores was ASDA. A public hearing was held for local businesses, shopkeepers and residents in October 2016. St, Modwen submitted a revised application for the town-centre scheme to include food-store anchor Morrisons, who submitted the winning bid.
====Tesco plans====
Reports suggested that local support for the Tesco/Everton F.C. scheme appeared to be tempered by concern about the stadium&#x27;s effect on residents. In 2012, the Knowsley council decided to invest £5 million to replace the multi-purpose Kirkby Civic Suite with the Kirkby Centre. The centre would include a library, a gallery and a local-history archive.
====St. Modwen plans====
After the collapse of Tesco&#x27;s plans for Kirkby Town Centre, regeneration halted until St. Modwen Properties acquired the town centre in October 2015. St. Modwen planned a multi-million-pound retail-led regeneration in partnership with Knowsley Metropolitan Borough Council. They planned to develop and expand the retail centre, complementing Tesco&#x27;s existing offer and providing housing on a 65-acre site the town centre. Refurbishment began in June 2016, and was planned to take eight weeks. In October, St. Modwen announced 24 November as the date for Kirkby&#x27;s Christmas lights switch-on.

Costa Coffee agreed in February 2017 to open a store in the town centre. In September, St. Modwen confirmed that Morrisons would open a 45,000-square-foot supermarket in the town centre. The following month, St. Modwen held an information event with the community about their proposed plans. According to the company, work would begin in 2018 and end in 2019. The planning application was granted in November 2019. In June 2018, St. Modwen reported that Home Bargains and fast food restaurant KFC would open in the town centre.
====Council intervention====
When the promised development was delayed, Knowsley council leader Graham Morgan said: &quot;Despite our best efforts, the redevelopment of the town centre still hasn&#x27;t happened and it&#x27;s quite clear that we need to find a different model. The people of Kirkby deserve more than this. We have worked closely to encourage St. Modwen to push on with their plans but, despite major names already being signed up, they remain extremely cautious and have still not confirmed a start date. We have waited too long and it&#x27;s time to move on.&quot; The council&#x27;s cabinet endorsed a plan for the council to purchase St. Modwen&#x27;s holdings in Kirkby Town Centre, including the shopping centre and the Knowsley College site on Cherryfield Drive. The college plans to move to the town centre.

==Transport==


=== Road ===
The main motorways that connect the town are the M57 motorway, which runs adjacent to the town, and M58 motorway, which connects just north of the town. However, the town also has other major roads that connect it, such as East Lancashire Road and the A506.

=== Rail ===
Alongside road connections, Kirkby also has a few rail links, with Kirkby railway station and Headbolt Lane railway station offering frequent trains to Liverpool, and Headbolt Lane offering an hourly service to Wigan.

=== Buses ===
Buses in the town and the wider region are managed by Merseytravel, are run by several different companies, mainly Arriva North West and Stagecoach North West.
==Education==

Primary secular, Church of England, and Roman Catholic education is available. At the secondary level, secular and Roman Catholic education is available. Educational services are provided or monitored by the Knowsley local education authority.

Kirkby has 11 primary schools; Northwood Community Primary School is the newest and largest. Kirkby High School and All Saints Catholic High School were formed after the town&#x27;s three secondary schools closed. Ruffwood and Brookfield, due to merge in September 2009, merged a year early when Ruffwood was designated a failing school in an Ofsted report. After the shake-up, All Saints Catholic High School and the Kirkby Sports College Center for Learning emerged. On 1 September 2013, Kirkby Sports College became an academy and was relaunched as Kirkby High School.

Higher education is provided by Knowsley Community College, with its main campus in Kirkby Town Centre. The college has an annual intake of over 12,000.
==Houses of worship==


St Chad&#x27;s Church, built during the 19th century on the site of a church noted in the Domesday Book, has graves of soldiers of both world wars.

==Sports and recreation==
Kirkby is home to the training ground and youth academy of Liverpool F.C. The youth academy was built in 1998 on the site previously used for Kirkby Town F.C.&#x27;s ground located on Simonswood Lane; the plans to move Liverpool F.C.&#x27;s full training ground to the same location were announced in 2018 and the move was completed during the international break in November 2020. The town&#x27;s former football club Kirkby Town, was later renamed Knowsley United and was dissolved in 1997. The most widely supported football teams in Kirkby are Liverpool F.C. and Everton F.C. reflecting the town&#x27;s proximity to Liverpool and historically that a large proportion of the town&#x27;s residents moved from Liverpool to the town after world war two.

During the 1970s, Kirkby was home to an artificial ski slope. Work started on the slope in 1973 and it was intended to open in 1975, however, the project was abandoned in autumn 1975 over fears it was not safe. Investigations by the &quot;Liverpool Free Press&quot; revealed a considerable degree of corruption in the sourcing of materials and building of the slope. Police investigations later led to a former council leader and former council architect being jailed over their involvement in the project.

==Services==
Law enforcement is provided by Merseyside Police, whose basic command unit in the borough of Knowsley has a Kirkby station on St Chad&#x27;s Drive. Public transport is co-ordinated by Merseytravel. Fire and rescue services are provided by the Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service, which has a Kirkby station on Webster Drive.

Waste management is co-ordinated by the Merseyside Recycling and Waste Authority.

==Filmography==
Kirkby and Seaforth were the bases for the fictional Newtown of the 1960s BBC TV series, &quot;Z-Cars&quot;.

&quot;Behind the Rent Strike&quot; is a 1974 documentary by Nick Broomfield documenting a 14-month rent strike in Kirkby by 3,000 social housing tenants protesting poor housing and rent increases triggered by the Housing Finance Act of 1972.

<doc id="300800" wikidata="Q1228523" url="?curid=300800" title="Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley">
<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley is a metropolitan borough in Merseyside, North West England. It covers several towns and villages, including Kirkby, Prescot, Huyton, Whiston, Halewood, Cronton and Stockbridge Village; Kirkby, Huyton, and Prescot being the major commercial centres. It takes its name from the village of Knowsley, though its headquarters are in Huyton. It forms part of the wider Liverpool City Region.

Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire, the borough was formed on 1 April 1974 by the merger of Huyton-with-Roby Urban District, Kirkby Urban District and Prescot Urban District, along with most of Whiston Rural District and a small part of West Lancashire Rural District, all from the administrative county of Lancashire.

It is known for Knowsley Hall and Knowsley Safari Park.

==History==

The modern-day borough of Knowsley was formerly composed of villages and towns in Lancashire dating back to 650 AD. The Earls of Derby have their ancestral home in the borough at Knowsley Hall, the surroundings of which today house the popular visitor attraction of Knowsley Safari Park.

Knowsley experienced rapid population expansion in the 1950s and 1960s, resulting from the combination of industrialization and migration, including a significant amount of overspill development from Liverpool. By 1971, some 194,600 lived within the area which would become Knowsley. However, over the next two decades general economic decline – particularly in manufacturing – contributed to a significant fall in population to around 154,600 by 1994. Subsequently, a population stabilization strategy helped to stem this decline. The strategy was focused on house building and marketing the borough to secure inward investment. Record house building and strong growth in inward investment yielded the borough&#x27;s first small rise in population in over 25 years in 1995. The population stabilized at over 154,000 for most of the rest of the 1990s.

The borough of Knowsley was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 covering the area of three former urban districts, which were abolished at the same time, plus six civil parishes (five from Whiston Rural District and one from West Lancashire Rural District):
*Cronton‡
*Halewood‡
*Huyton with Roby Urban District
*Kirkby Urban District
*Knowsley‡
*Prescot Urban District
*Simonswood parish from West Lancashire Rural District
*Tarbock‡
*Whiston‡
‡Parishes from Whiston Rural District

All the component parts of Knowsley had previously been in the administrative county of Lancashire, but were transferred to the new metropolitan county of Merseyside at the same time the district came into being on 1 April 1974. A committee of councillors from the outgoing district councils chose the name Knowsley for the new district in 1972, taking the name from Knowsley village, being a central location within the new district, rather than using the name of one of the three urban districts which had the majority of the population. The committee noted that the Knowsley Hall estate had historic connections to all the constituent parts of the new district. The government confirmed the name in 1973. The new district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chairman of the council to take the title of mayor.

===Liverpool City Region Combined Authority===
The Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley is one of the six constituent local government districts of the Liverpool City Region. Since 1 April 2014, some of the borough&#x27;s responsibilities have been pooled with neighbouring authorities within the metropolitan area and subsumed into the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority.

The combined authority has effectively become the top-tier administrative body for the local governance of the city region and the leader of Knowsley Council, along with the five other leaders from neighbouring local government districts, take strategic decisions over economic development, transport, employment and skills, tourism, culture, housing and physical infrastructure.

The Liverpool City Region, which includes Knowsley, is also governed by the Mayor of the Liverpool City Region who is directly elected by the residents of the Liverpool City Region and has powers over a number of areas, the incumbent Mayor is Steve Rotheram of the Labour Party.

According to the 2011 census, 80.9% of people in Knowsley describe themselves as Christian, the highest proportion in any local authority in England and Wales. This is significantly different from average figures from the 2011 census for England and Wales, which showed that 59.3 per cent of the population identified as Christian and 14.1 million people, around a quarter of the population in England and Wales, reported that they have no religion.

<text>Halewood is a town and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley in Merseyside, England. It lies near the city of Liverpool&#x27;s southeastern boundary, bordered by the suburbs of Netherley, Hunt&#x27;s Cross and Woolton.

Historically a part of Lancashire, Halewood originated as a small village but later developed along with parts of Knowsley district, Sefton district and St Helens district into overspill areas for the surrounding cities of Liverpool, Manchester and Salford.

At the 2001 census, the population of the civil parish was 20,309, remaining similar at the 2011 census. The combined population of Halewood&#x27;s four local government wards was 29,217.

== History ==
The township of Halewood lies between the old course of Ditton Brook in the north and Rams Brook in the south. Disputes over the manor lands of Halewood between the Ireland and Holland families began in the 13th century and were to be ongoing for some time. The Ireland family had Hale, most of Halebank and part of North End, while the Holland family who were the superior lords, controlled most of North End and a portion of Halebank. However, the Hollands were based at a Hall in Halebank, while the Irelands&#x27; main residence was the &#x27;Hutt&#x27; within Halewood.

By the 15th century, Halewood was a separate township from Hale and in 1682, the manor of Halewood became part of the dower of Charlotte, Countess of Derby.

Halewood once had a workhouse for the township&#x27;s poor that opened in 1723. The workhouse was housed in a cottage rented from the Earl of Derby in 1722. It was run at a cost of 6d per annum, and had space for 40 people. It worked with other parts of the community to give aid to the homeless (&#x27;vagrants&#x27;) and gave the poor a coal allowance and schooling.

In 1839, the Chapel of St Nicholas was built. It was later enlarged in 1847 and in 1868, St Nicholas&#x27; Chapel become a rectory and a true Parish Church. A tower and bells were added to the church around 1883. St Nicholas&#x27; Church is Grade II listed and has 17 historically significant stained glass windows designed by William Morris (1834–1896), the English textile designer, poet, novelist, translator, and socialist activist, and Edward Burne-Jones. The church also has a Henry Willis organ installed in 1889.

William Imrie, Liverpool shipowner who owned the White Star Line is buried in Halewood. Imrie died in 1906. A service was held at St Margaret&#x27;s Church and his body was laid with that of his wife in the family plot in the graveyard of St Nicholas Church. The church also has war memorial, erected in 1921.

Halewood railway station opened in 1988. An earlier station, a few hundred metres further east, on Baileys Lane had closed in 1951. The original Halewood station opened 1874 and first appeared in the timetable in May that year. The railway line in Halewood passed on a three-arched sandstone viaduct. The station was high up on an embankment, and for this reason it was constructed from timber (unlike nearly all of the other CLC stations which were palatial brick structures).

There are a few pubs in Halewood, with the oldest being The Eagle &amp; Child (c.1750). It was renamed The Reverend Plummer in late 2018, but restored back to its original name in mid-2020. Reverend Canon F B Plummer was the vicar of St Nicholas Church from 1902 to 1926, and lost three of his seven sons during the First World War. His sons are memorialised on the cenotaph in St Nicholas&#x27; churchyard.

Halewood is home to the first war horse grave to be awarded heritage protection. Blackie was a war horse buried at the RSPCA Liverpool Animal Centre, Higher Road, Halewood in 1942. He served with the 275th Brigade Royal Field Artillery &#x27;A&#x27; Battery – 55th West Lancashire Division in most of the major battles of the First World War, including Arras, the Somme Offensive and Ypres. Recognising the contribution Blackie made as a horse in service with the British Army during the First World War, his grave in Halewood became a grade II listed monument in 2017.

Halewood was one of the sites of the Survey of English Dialects. Despite being close to Liverpool, the speech of Halewood at the time was still traditional Lancashire dialect and not Scouse.

== Car factory ==

Halewood body and assembly facility was originally opened by Ford Motor Company in 1963, to build the then small-saloon Ford Anglia, reflecting pressure on Ford of Britain&#x27;s principal plant at Dagenham. In March 1963, the Lord Mayor of Liverpool, Alderman David John Lewis, drove the first car, an Anglia de Luxe, off the production line at the £30 million plant. The first Ford Anglia to roll of the production line at Halewood was featured as the prize in a competition in the Liverpool Echo newspaper, which was won by a Mr Taylor. Mr Taylor could not drive and sold the car on. Ford bought the car back three years later and donated it to Liverpool City Museum, as World Museum was then known. The car is now housed at the Museum of Liverpool.

Production of the Anglia ceased in 1967 and the Ford factory began work on the Escort, a car it would produce untilm the turn of the millennium. The Halewood plant was also used for assembling the Ford Corsair between the model&#x27;s 1964 launch and 1969.

Female machinists at Ford, Halewood downed tools and walked out in solidarity with their southern colleagues in Dagenham in 1968. In the 1960s, the female machinists at Ford were classified within the company pay structure as grade B. That meant they were officially unskilled, despite having to pass tests in order to gain their employment. After years battling for recognition as skilled workers, they finally walked out, bringing car production to halt and becoming the focus of national news stories.

== Education ==
Halewood contains many primary schools and one secondary school, Halewood Academy.

== Economy ==
The Halewood plant, which is in Speke, L24 9BJ, is now home to the Jaguar Land Rover Body &amp; Assembly facility, which produces the Land Rover Discovery Sport, Range Rover Evoque and until 2009, the Jaguar X-Type. On the same site is a large factory owned by Ford Motor Company which produces gearboxes for amongst other the Ford Transit, Ford Fiesta and the Ford Focus.

There is also the Eli Lilly Factory which produces pharmaceuticals. Liverpool City Council have built a new training ground and youth academy for Everton Football Club on the edge of Halewood called Finch Farm.

===Regeneration efforts===
Following significant regeneration efforts since 2004, Halewood has turned a corner. Crime has reduced, the performance of local schools has drastically improved (with Halewood Centre for Learning topping the local authority league tables). New housing developments have created high quality housing which has resulted in an influx of professionals. The old sports centre, Bridgefield Forum, has been knocked down and replaced with the state of the art Halewood Leisure Centre. Other housing communities such as Okell Drive and surrounding areas and housing close to the original Halewood village are also thriving. Halewood&#x27;s largest employer is the Jaguar Land Rover factory. In 2012 Halewood&#x27;s old Raven Court shopping centre was replaced with a 7 million pound shopping centre with new shops including Aldi, Iceland, Card Factory, Tesco Express, Barnardos, Ladbrokes and a newsagent.

Halewood Park Triangle is Halewood&#x27;s main public park, securing Green Flag Award in 2011. Consisting largely of mature woodland, with ponds, meadow habitat and heathland remnants, the park is a designated Local Wildlife Site. Its layout is closely linked to its railway history. It formed part of the Liverpool Loop Line and the Transpennine Trail now follows the route leading southwards to Halewood Doorstep Green.

On the abolition of the administrative county of Lancashire in 1974, the urban district was also abolished and its former area was transferred to Merseyside to be combined with that of other districts to form the present-day metropolitan borough of Knowsley. The Knowsley borough was formed on 1 April 1974 by the merger of, Huyton-with-Roby Urban District, Kirkby Urban District and Prescot Urban District, along with most of Whiston Rural District (of which Halewood was part) and a small part of West Lancashire Rural District, all from the administrative county of Lancashire.

The Garston and Halewood constituency was created in 2010 represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2010 by Maria Eagle of the Labour Party.

<doc id="300802" wikidata="Q1639484" url="?curid=300802" title="Huyton">
<text>Huyton ( ) is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley, Merseyside, England. Part of the Liverpool Built-up Area, it borders the Liverpool suburbs of Dovecot, Knotty Ash and Netherley. 

Historically in Lancashire, Huyton was an ancient parish which in the mid-19th century contained Croxteth Park, Knowsley and Tarbock. It was part of the hundred of West Derby, an ancient subdivision of Lancashire covering the south-west of the county.

==History==

===Medieval===
Huyton was first settled about 600–650 AD by Angles. The settlement was founded on a low hill surrounded by inaccessible marshy land. The first part of the name may suggest a landing-place, probably on the banks of the River Alt.

Both Huyton and Roby are mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, Huyton being spelt &quot;Hitune&quot;.

===Industrial development===
Huyton-with-Roby is situated near to the south-western extremity of the former Lancashire coalfield. In the 19th century, Welsh workers settled in the area to work in nearby collieries. A Welsh-speaking Non-conformist chapel (Calvinistic Methodists) was founded in Wood Lane, Huyton Quarry. Nearby Cronton Colliery finally ceased production in March 1984, shortly before the UK miners&#x27; strike (1984–1985). Both Huyton and Roby have stations on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (another station, Huyton Quarry, closed in 1958). The railway&#x27;s construction was supervised by George Stephenson and, when it opened in 1830, it became the world&#x27;s first regular passenger train service. On the day of the railway&#x27;s official opening, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington alighted the train at Roby station.

===Second World War===
During the Second World War, Huyton suffered bombing from the Luftwaffe but the scale of destruction was far less than that experienced in Liverpool, Bootle, and Birkenhead. Schoolchildren were not evacuated from Huyton, instead schools and homes were provided with air-raid shelters.

Huyton hosted three wartime camps: an internment camp, a prisoner-of-war camp, and a base for American servicemen. The internment camp may have been one of the largest in the UK. Some internees were refugees from the Nazis, including socialists such as Kurt Hager and a large number of artists attacked in Germany and elsewhere for their &quot;degeneracy&quot;. Huyton internees included artists Martin Bloch, Hugo Dachinger, and Walter Nessler, dancer Kurt Jooss, musicians, sociologist Norbert Elias, anthropologist Eric Wolf and composer Hans Gál. More than 40 per cent of Huyton&#x27;s internees were over 50 years old. The camp, first occupied in May 1940, was formed around several streets of new, empty council houses and flats and then made secure with barbed wire fencing. Twelve internees were allocated to each house, but overcrowding resulted in many sleeping in tents.

Initially, the camp was only meant to hold the internees until they could be shipped to the Isle of Man. However, largely in response to the torpedoing of the transport ship, &quot;Arandora Star&quot; (and the loss of 805 lives, including the Captain, 12 of his officers, 42 of his crew and 37 military guards), the deportations ended. Most of the internees were released before the camp closed in 1942. The camp was sited in and around what became known as the &quot;Bluebell Estate&quot; and many of the streets were given names of the great battles of WWII.

The prisoner of war camp closed in 1948. Some inmates &quot;went native&quot;, stayed in Britain and married local women. Among those in the Huyton camp was Bert Trautmann, who later went on to be the 1950s goalkeeper for Manchester City. From 1944, American servicemen were temporarily stationed in Huyton.

===Murders===
Huyton was brought to national attention in 2005 after the racially motivated murder of black teenager Anthony Walker in McGoldrick Park. Two local youths were later found guilty of his murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. They were 17-year-old Michael Barton (brother of footballer Joey Barton) and 20-year-old Paul Taylor.

In July 2008, an 18-year-old teenager Michael Causer was battered to death in a homophobic attack at a house in Huyton.

==Governance==
In 1894, the township was included in the Huyton with Roby Urban District. &quot;Since the First World War, Huyton-with-Roby has been transformed into a residential suburb of Liverpool, while agriculture, formerly the area&#x27;s main occupation, has almost disappeared&quot;. In 1932 Liverpool City Council purchased a large area of the Earl of Derby&#x27;s Knowsley estate. Thereafter, throughout the 1930s, the city built four large housing estates in the north-west of Huyton-with-Roby. These Liverpool ‘overspill&#x27; housing estates were Fincham, Huyton Farm, Longview and Woolfall Heath. Other smaller developments were commissioned by the urban district council or privately commissioned. By 1950 the population was over 55,000, the vast majority of whom had moved to the area from the city of Liverpool.

After the Second World War, the district successfully fought off absorption into the Liverpool City Council boundaries. However, its application for borough status failed in 1952. Huyton Municipal Building was completed in 1963.

On 1 April 1974, Huyton-with-Roby became part of the new metropolitan borough of Knowsley.

By convention, Huyton-with-Roby contains Huyton Park, Roby, Longview, Huyton Quarry, Page Moss, Woolfall Heath, Bowring Park, Fincham, and Court Hey. Today this area is covered by six local government wards: Stockbridge, Page Moss, Roby, St. Gabriel&#x27;s, St. Michael&#x27;s, and Swanside. Stockbridge ward includes Longview (in Huyton) as well as Stockbridge Village (outside Huyton).

==Transport==
Huyton is located just west of the M57 motorway which marks its border. Liverpool city centre is to the west via the M62 motorway.

There are three surrounding motorway junctions (M57 J2, M62 J5 and J6) making Huyton very easily accessed via road.

===Huyton railway station===
Huyton railway station, formerly called Huyton Gate, is served by regular City Line services to and from Liverpool, St. Helens, Wigan and further afield.

===Huyton bus station===

Huyton bus station is on Huyton Hey Road, adjacent to the shopping centre and 140 metres away from the Huyton railway station.

Buses from Huyton bus station serve destinations as far afield as Liverpool, Kirkby, St. Helens, Warrington, Runcorn and Liverpool John Lennon Airport.

==Education==
Huyton has one secondary school—Lord Derby Academy on Seel Road—and fifteen primary schools. A construction training college is on Princess Drive.

==Amenities==

The shopping centre of Huyton is still referred to by local people as &quot;the village&quot; or &quot;the villie&quot;, which dates back to the days when the centre was a rural village community. An Asda Walmart complex has been built nearby. There are also around 100 other independent shops and previously hosted an indoor market, which has since been closed.

The area is host to Huyton Library (Civic Way) and before 2014 was also served by Page Moss Library (Stockbridge Lane). There is also a contemporary art gallery at Huyton Library.

There are eight public parks: Court Hey Park, Bowring Park (the oldest public park in Knowsley, opened in 1907), Huyton Lane Wetland, Jubilee Park (Twig Lane/Dinas Lane), McGoldrick Park (Rydal Road), Sawpit Park (Hall Lane/Sawpit Lane), Stadt Moers Park (covers more than of land between Whiston and Huyton) and St. John&#x27;s Millennium Green (Manor Farm Road). There are also nine children&#x27;s playgrounds.

Huyton has a King George&#x27;s Field in memorial to King George V. It also has one of the biggest dogs&#x27; homes in Merseyside, Dogs&#x27; Trust, located on Whiston Lane.

Huyton has many public houses including The Huyton Park Hotel, The Stanley Arms (named after Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby), The Crofters, Seel Arms, Queens Arms, Oak Tree, The Old Bank, Longview Social Club and The Swan. The former Wheatsheaf/Rose And Crown reopened as The Barker&#x27;s Brewery on 23 January 2011, as part of the Wetherspoon chain of pubs. Several former landmark pubs have been demolished for new projects since the late 1990s: The Dovecot, Bluebell Inn, Farmers Arms, Hillside, Eagle and Child, The Quarry Inn and The Quiet Man.

In January 2012, the Longview Social Club was destroyed by a fire on the premises.

In the early hours of 16 April 2015, four supermarkets at Longview Shops were destroyed by fire and later demolished due to extensive damage. The fire started at a One Stop store and spread across another three businesses. Merseyside Police later revealed the blaze was caused by an attempted burglary.

==Sport==
The area is served by Knowsley Leisure and Culture Park (Longview Drive) and King George V Sports Centre (Longview Lane).

Huyton-with-Roby has two 18-hole golf courses: Huyton &amp; Prescot Golf Club (founded in 1905) and Bowring Golf Club (according to a sign at the course, the oldest municipal golf course in England).

Huyton has its own cricket club, located off Huyton Lane which was founded in the mid-1860s by the Stone family and the town has produced at least one first class cricketer: Reginald Moss.

Huyton also had a professional rugby league club from 1968 to 1985. It was formed from Liverpool Stanley (1934–1951) and Liverpool City (1951–1968). Huyton RLFC struggled in the second division of the Rugby Football League until 1985 when they were replaced by Runcorn Highfield. This club, later renamed Highfield, struggled on near the bottom of the pro game: in 1995–1996 they gained just one point all season and changed their name to Prescot Panthers, before folding at the end of the 1997 season. (Huytonians still interested in supporting pro rugby league have the choice of either St. Helens or Widnes Vikings, both of whom are away from Huyton).

In football, the town has produced the England midfield internationals Peter Reid (Everton) and Steven Gerrard (Liverpool). Other footballers include Craig Hignett, Tony Hibbert, David Nugent, Lee Molyneux, Leon Osman, John Relish, Greg Tansey, Lee Trundle, Callum McManaman and Cole Stockton. On 28 March 2007, two of Huyton&#x27;s most prominent footballers starred for England in a 3–0 away win in Andorra. Goals came from Steven Gerrard (2) and David Nugent. Both players were educated at Cardinal Heenan High School.

Huyton has many amateur football teams at both junior and senior level, but only one FA Charter Standard Club, Paramount Community Football Club.

Despite producing so many pro footballers, Huyton has never been able to sustain a semi-pro club for long. Nearby Kirkby Town changed their name to Knowsley United in 1988 and moved to Alt Park, the former home of Huyton Rugby league Club. In United&#x27;s first five seasons they were successful. In 1988–89 they finished runners-up in the North West Counties Football League. The following season they were champions and won promotion to the Northern Premier League Division One. They were accordingly promoted to the Premier Division. The following season they reached the first round proper of the FA Cup, only to be beaten by Carlisle United at home. The momentum did not last and Knowsley United ceased to be a senior semi-pro side in 1998.

Huytonians wishing to support a local semi-pro outfit have Prescot Cables located at Valerie Park in the Northern Premier League (Premier Division) less than away.

==Notable people==

Huyton-with-Roby has several Beatles connections. As The Quarrymen, the Fab Four played the MPTE Social Club in Finch Lane. The Beatles also played 15 times in a hall in Page Moss (Hambleton Hall, St David Road; later became a Probation Office) between January 1961 and January 1962. On 21 March 1961, The Swinging Blue Jeans, fronted by Huyton-born Ray Ennis (born Raymond Vincent Ennis on 26 May 1942), introduced the Beatles to their first-ever Cavern Club evening slot. Paul McCartney&#x27;s aunt Jin lived in Dinas Lane. In 1963, this was the site of McCartney&#x27;s eventful 21st birthday party, at which John Lennon got drunk and assaulted a local DJ for insinuating he was a homosexual. Huyton Parish Church churchyard is the final resting place of the Beatles&#x27; original bass guitarist, Huytonian Stuart Sutcliffe.

<doc id="300805" wikidata="Q2342885" url="?curid=300805" title="Coffee percolator">
<text>A coffee percolator is a type of pot used for the brewing of coffee by continually cycling the boiling or nearly boiling brew through the grounds using gravity until the required strength is reached. The grounds are held in a perforated metal filter basket.

Coffee percolators once enjoyed great popularity but were supplanted in the early 1970s by automatic drip-brew coffeemakers. Percolators often expose the grounds to higher temperatures than other brewing methods, and may recirculate already brewed coffee through the beans. As a result, coffee brewed with a percolator is particularly susceptible to overextraction. However, percolator enthusiasts maintain that the potential pitfalls of this brewing method can be eliminated by careful control of the brewing procedures.

==Brewing process==
A coffee percolator consists of a pot with a chamber at the bottom which is nearest to the heat source. A removable vertical tube leads from there to the top of the percolator. Just below the upper end of this tube is a perforated metal filter &quot;basket&quot; to hold the grounds to be brewed.

Water is poured into the pot, keeping the level below the bottom of the basket, and the desired amount of a fairly coarse-ground coffee is placed in the basket.

The percolator is placed on a range or stove, heating the water in the bottom chamber. Water at the very bottom of the chamber gets hot first and starts to boil. The boiling creates bubbles of steam that are directed up the vertical tube, pushing hot water along with it up and out the top of the tube in a process similar to the principle behind a gas lift pump. The hot water hits the underside of the lid, and flows out and over the inner lid of the coffee basket. Perforations in the inner lid distribute the water over the top of the coffee grounds in the basket. From there the freshly brewed coffee drips into the gradually warming water below. This whole cycle repeats continuously, making the characteristic intermittent &quot;perking&quot; sound of the hot water hitting the underside of the lid.

As the brewing coffee nears the boiling point, the &quot;perking&quot; sound becomes a continuous gurgle, signaling that the coffee is ready to drink. In a manual percolator the pot is removed from the stove or the heat reduced to stop the percolation. Brewed coffee left continuously percolating at the boiling point will over extract, making the resulting coffee harsh and excessively bitter.

Some coffee percolators have an integral electric heating element and are not used on a stove. Most of these automatically reduce the heat at the end of the brewing phase, keeping the coffee at drinking temperature but not boiling.

==Inventor==
The first modern percolator incorporating the rising of boiling water through a tube to form a continuous cycle and capable of being heated on a kitchen stove was invented in 1819 by the Parisian tinsmith Joseph-Henry-Marie Laurens. Its principle was then often copied and modified.

The first US patent for a coffee percolator was issued to James Nason of Franklin, Massachusetts, in 1865, . This mechanism did not use the conventional percolation method as described above. 

An Illinois farmer named Hanson Goodrich patented the modern U.S. stove-top percolator as it is known today, and he was granted on 13 August 1889. It had the key elements of a conventional percolator: the broad base for boiling, the upflow central tube and a perforated basket hanging on it. Goodrich&#x27;s design could transform any standard coffee pot of the day into a stove-top percolator. Subsequent patents have added very little.

Electric percolators have been in production since at least the first decade of the 20th century with General Electric publishing a pamphlet titled &quot;Coffee Making By Electricity&quot; in 1905. Automatic percolators have been available since the 1940s or earlier.

==Usage==
Large percolators, called coffee urns, are often found in use at offices, cafeterias, community events, church gatherings and other large group activities where large quantities of coffee are needed at one time.

Percolators are also popular among campers and other nature enthusiasts because of their ability to make coffee without electricity, although a simple filter holder can also be used with boiled water poured from a pot. Non-pressure percolators may also be used with paper filters.

==Improvements==
The method for making coffee in a percolator had changed very little since the introduction of the electric percolator in the early part of the 20th century. However, in 1970 commercially available &quot;ground coffee filter rings&quot; were introduced to the market. The coffee filter rings were designed for use in percolators, and each ring contained a pre-measured amount of coffee grounds that were sealed in a self-contained paper filter. The sealed rings resembled the shape of a doughnut, and the small hole in the middle of the ring enabled the coffee filter ring to be placed in the metal percolator basket around the protruding convection (percolator) tube.

Prior to the introduction of pre-measured self-contained ground coffee filter rings, fresh coffee grounds were measured out in scoopsful and placed into the metal percolator basket. This process enabled small amounts of coffee grounds to leak into the fresh coffee. Additionally, the process left wet grounds in the percolator basket. The benefit of the pre-packed coffee filter rings was two-fold: First, because the amount of coffee contained in the rings was pre-measured, it negated the need to measure each scoop and then place it in the metal percolator basket. Second, the filter paper was strong enough to hold all the coffee grounds within the sealed paper. After use, the coffee filter ring could be easily removed from the basket and discarded. This relieved the consumer from the task of cleaning out the wet coffee grounds from the percolator basket.

While most percolators use metal filter baskets the Neuerer Aromators used double-layered cross-slitted porcelain filters similar to those in Karlsbad-style coffee makers, not requiring any paper ring filters.

==Decline==
With better brands of instant coffee and the introduction of the electric drip coffee maker, the popularity of percolators plummeted in the early 1970s, and so did the market for the self-contained ground coffee filters. In 1976, General Foods discontinued the manufacture of Max Pax, and by the end of the decade, even generic ground coffee filter rings were no longer available. However, as of 2019, coffee percolator filters are still produced by the major coffee device maker Melitta and are readily available in stores and from online sources.

==Terminology and unrelated brewing methods==
The name &quot;percolator&quot; is derived from the word &quot;percolate&quot; which means &quot;to cause (a solvent) to pass through a permeable substance especially for extracting a soluble constituent&quot;. In the case of coffee-brewing the solvent is water, the permeable substance is the coffee grounds, and the soluble constituents are the chemical compounds that give coffee its color, taste, aroma, and stimulating properties. 

While many popular brewing methods and devices use percolation to make coffee, the term &quot;percolator&quot; narrowly refers to devices similar to the stove-top coffee pots developed by Hanson Goodrich mentioned above. His percolator was one of the earliest coffee brewing devices to use percolation rather than infusion or decoction as its mode of extraction, and he named it accordingly. Other brewing methods based on percolation followed, and this early naming convention can cause confusion with other percolation methods.
In 1813, Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford published his essay, &quot;Of the Excellent Qualities of Coffee&quot;, in which he disclosed several designs for percolation methods which would now be most closely related to drip brewing.

&quot;Siphon brewers&quot; appeared in the early 1830s. Using a combination of infusion and percolation, they were the first development in coffee percolation. However, the complex, fragile devices remained a curiosity. Siphon brewing relies on vapor pressure to raise water from a pressure chamber up to the brewing chamber where the coffee is infused. Once the heat source has been removed from the pressure chamber, the atmosphere within cools, lowering the pressure and drawing the coffee through a filter and back into the pressure chamber. Distinctions from percolator brewing include the fact that the majority of the extraction takes place during the infusion phase (as an immersion brewer) and that the water is not recycled through the grounds.

&quot;Filter drip brewing&quot; (invented 1908, Melitta Bentz) uses a bed of coffee grounds placed in a holder with a filter to prevent passage of the grounds into the filtrate and hot water is passed through the grounds by gravity. This is distinct from percolator brewing due to the fact that the water is &quot;not&quot; recycled through the grounds, and the water does not have to be boiled to reach the brew chamber. (In many automatic drip machines, the water is boiled or nearly boiled to raise it through a tube to the brewing chamber, but this is an implementation detail specific to those machines, and not required by the process, which was first used manually.)

&quot;Moka brewing&quot; (invented 1933, Alfonso Bialetti) uses a bed of coffee grounds placed in a filter basket between a pressure chamber and receptacle. Vapor pressure above the water heated in the pressure chamber forces the water through the grounds, past the filter, and into the receptacle. The amount of vapor pressure that builds up, and the temperature reached, are dependent on the grind and packing (&quot;tamping&quot;) of the grounds. This is distinct from percolator brewing in that pressure, rather than gravity, moves the water through the grounds; that the water is not recycled through the grounds; and that the water does not have to be boiled to reach the brew chamber. In the South of Europe, in countries like Italy or Spain, the domestic use of the moka expanded quickly and completely substituted the percolator by the end of the 1930s.

Since both percolator and drip brewing were available and popular in the North American market throughout the 20th century, there is little confusion in the United States and Canada between these methods. However, moka pots have only recently become readily available in that market; and vendors and customers alike often conflate moka pots with percolators, despite their fairly disparate mechanics and results.

<text>Oscar McKinley Charleston (October 14, 1896 – October 5, 1954) was an American center fielder, first baseman and manager in Negro league baseball and the Cuban League. Over his 43-year baseball career, Charleston played or managed with more than a dozen teams, including the Homestead Grays and the Pittsburgh Crawfords, Negro league baseball&#x27;s leading teams in the 1930s. He also played nine winter seasons in Cuba and in numerous exhibition games against white major leaguers. He was posthumously inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1976.

One of the Negro leagues&#x27; early stars, Charleston was by 1920 generally considered &quot;the greatest center fielder and one of the most reliable sluggers in black baseball.&quot; He and Josh Gibson share the record for Negro league batting titles with three. He was the second player to win consecutive Triple Crowns in either batting or pitching (after Grover Cleveland Alexander), a feat matched just one time by a batter. He is now credited with having won the Triple Crown (leading in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in) three times, which is the most for any player in Major League Baseball. He holds the third-highest career batting average, behind Josh Gibson and Ty Cobb, and the fourth-highest career OPS (1.066).

In 1915, after serving three years in the U.S. Army, the Indianapolis native continued his baseball career as a professional with the Indianapolis ABCs. He played in the Negro National League&#x27;s inaugural doubleheader on May 20, 1920. His most productive season was with the St. Louis Giants in 1921, when he hit 15 home runs, 12 triples, and 17 doubles, stole 31 bases, and had a .437 batting average. In 1933, Charleston played in the first Negro National League All-Star Game at Chicago&#x27;s Comiskey Park and appeared in the League&#x27;s 1934 and 1935 all-star games. In 1945, Charleston became manager of the Brooklyn Brown Dodgers and helped recruit black ballplayers such as Roy Campanella to join the first integrated Major League Baseball teams. His career ended in 1954 as a player-manager for the Indianapolis Clowns.

==Early life and family==
Oscar McKinley Charleston was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, on October 14, 1896, the seventh of eleven children; his younger brother Bennie Charleston played alongside him on the 1932 Pittsburgh Crawfords. Charleston&#x27;s father, Tom Charleston, was a construction worker and a former jockey. Oscar spent his youth playing sandlot baseball and was a batboy for the Indianapolis ABCs.

On March 7, 1912, fifteen-year-old Charleston lied about his age to enlist in the U.S. Army. He was assigned to Company B of the Twenty-Fourth Infantry Regiment and served in the Philippines, where he ran track and played baseball on the regiment&#x27;s team. In 1914 the seventeen-year-old, left-handed pitcher played a season representing the regiment in the Manila League. Charleston also pitched a 3–0 shutout and scored a run during a local all-star game. At the end of his tour of duty, Charleston decided not to reenlist. He returned to Indianapolis in April 1915.

On November 24, 1922, Charleston married Jane Blalock Howard, a widow from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The couple often traveled together during the early years of their marriage when he was a player and manager for the Harrisburg Giants. The Charlestons had no children and separated during the 1930s, but they never divorced.

==Career and statistics==
Between 1915 and 1954, Charleston was a player and/or manager for the Indianapolis ABCs, Lincoln Stars, Chicago American Giants, Detroit Stars, Saint Louis Giants, Harrisburg Giants, Hilldale Club, Homestead Grays, and Pittsburgh Crawfords, as well as the Toledo Crawfords, Indianapolis Crawfords, Philadelphia Stars, Brooklyn Brown Dodgers, and the Indianapolis Clowns. Charleston was a player-manager until 1941, but his thirty-nine year baseball career continued as a team manager until his death in 1954. In addition to his play in the Negro leagues, Charleston participated in numerous exhibition games against all-white teams in the years before major league baseball became integrated in 1947. He also played nine winter seasons in Cuba.

Official statistics for the Negro league players are incomplete and vary among sources. The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum&#x27;s website and Baseball Reference&#x27;s website reported as of March 6, 2018, that Charleston&#x27;s career batting average over 239 Negro league games and twenty-six seasons (1915–1941) was .339, with a slugging percentage of .545. The Hall of Fame website also noted that Charleston had a .326 lifetime batting average in exhibition play against white major leaguers. Data from other sources provided different statistics, but do not include specific periods of time. For example, the online version of &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot; lists Charleston&#x27;s lifetime overall batting average as .357, as did baseball historian James A. Riley in his book &quot;The Biographical Encyclopedia of the Negro Baseball Leagues&quot; (1994). Riley further stated that Charleston had a .326 batting average in exhibition games against white major league players and a .361 batting average in nine seasons of winter games in Cuba.

===Early years, 1915–1920===
After his honorable discharge from the U.S. Army in 1915, Charleston returned to the United States and immediately began his baseball career with the Indianapolis ABCs. He was paid $50 per month. On April 11, 1915, Charleston pitched his first game for the ABCs, a three-hit, 7–0 shutout in an exhibition game against the Reserves, a semiprofessional team of white players. Charleston, called &quot;Charlie&quot; by his teammates, soon moved to the center field position, where he became known for playing shallow (close behind second base) and his one-handed catches. Charleston was especially adept at catching high flies, using his running speed to retrieve balls above his head. His strong batting and fielding skills also earned Charleston the nickname of the &quot;Hoosier Comet.&quot;

In addition to his skills as a ballplayer, Charleston was known for his combative nature and willingness to fight when provoked. One memorable incident occurred during a game that the Indianapolis ABCs played against a team of white major and minor leaguers in Indianapolis on October 24, 1915. When ABCs player Elwood &quot;Bingo&quot; DeMoss got into a dispute with umpire James Scanlon over a bad call against the team, Charleston ran in from center field and punched the umpire, knocking him to the ground. According to local newspapers, the ballpark erupted into &quot;a near race riot.&quot; Charleston and DeMoss escaped the field and were arrested and jailed. The two players were released after posting bail and immediately left town to play winter baseball in Cuba. Charleston was also temporarily dismissed from the ABCs and sent to play for the Lincoln Giants in New York until the controversy died down. He returned to the team in June 1916.

During another incident that occurred in Cuba in the mid-1920s, Charleston fought with Cuban soldiers during a Cuban League game against Havana. He was arrested and fined for his role in the fighting, but was released from custody and returned to the field to play the following day. James &quot;Cool Papa&quot; Bell related a story to baseball historian John Holway of another confrontation involving Charleston. Bell told Holway that around 1935 Charleston tore off the hood of a white-robed Ku Klux Klansman during a trip to Florida.

In spite of the controversy surrounding some of his behavior, Charleston contributed to the success of the Indianapolis ABCs. In 1916 he was a member of the team when it beat the Chicago American Giants to claim what the game&#x27;s promoters called &quot;The Championship of Colored Baseball.&quot; (The first Negro League World Series was not played until October 1924.) Charleston left the ABCs at end of the 1918 season to attend the Colored Officer Training Program during World War I, but he served less than two months before the armistice was signed to end the war and he was discharged. When Charleston returned to Indiana in 1919, the owner of the ABCs did not field a team, so he joined the Chicago American Giants.

===Negro league player, 1920–1941===

When the Negro National League was established in 1920, Charleston returned to Indianapolis to play for the ABCs, playing center field for the team in the League&#x27;s inaugural doubleheader on May 20, 1920, at Indianapolis. The ABCs beat the Giants 4–2 and 11–4. Charleston remained with the ABCs until 1921, then signed with the Saint Louis Giants, who paid him $400 per month, the league&#x27;s highest salary. Charleston&#x27;s most productive season was with the Saint Louis Giants in 1921, when he hit fifteen home runs, twelve triples, seventeen doubles, and stole thirty-one bases over sixty games. Charleston&#x27;s batting average that year was .434; he was also the league&#x27;s leader in doubles, triples, and home runs.

When the Giants folded at the end of the 1921 season due to financial difficulties, Charleston returned to the ABCs and stayed until 1924, when he became a player-manager of the Harrisburg Giants in Pennsylvania. Charleston continued his career with the Harrisburg team until 1927. After it disbanded, Charleston played for the Hillsdale Club, a team near Philadelphia, for two seasons (1928 and 1929) and spent the next two seasons (1930 and 1931) with the Homestead Grays. As Charleston aged, he shifted from center field to first base during his final years playing for the Giants and two years with the Grays. Charleston also played nine seasons of winter baseball on teams in Cuba. His batting average for the nine seasons was .361. A countrywide fan poll taken after the 1925 Eastern Colored League season for an &quot;All-Eastern Team&quot; gave Charleston the most votes, mostly placing him in center field, but he also received votes for left and right field, and as a manager.

In 1932 Charleston became player-manager of the Pittsburgh Crawfords, whose roster included future Hall of Famers Josh Gibson, Satchel Paige, and Judy Johnson, in addition to teammates Ted Page, Jud Wilson, Jimmie Crutchfield, and Double Duty Radcliffe. (Cool Papa Bell joined the Crawfords in 1933.) The Negro National League was revived in 1933 and the Pittsburgh Crawfords and Homestead Grays became its leading teams in the 1930s. The two teams competed for more than a dozen Negro League championships and had several future Hall of Famers on their rosters, including Charleston.

Between 1932 and 1936, while Charleston was player-manager of the Crawfords, the team was considered the best in professional baseball. In 1932 the Crawfords played as an independent team and went 99–36, with Charleston batting .363. That year Charleston received the most votes (43,000) from fans and played first base in the first East-West All-Star Game on September 10, 1933. The game was held at Chicago&#x27;s Comiskey Park in front of a crowd of 20,000 a few weeks after the first Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Charleston was also a first baseman in the 1934 and 1935 Negro League All-Star Games. For the 1935–36 season, when the Crawfords were part of the Negro National League, the team&#x27;s overall record was 36–24; Charleston&#x27;s batting average was .304. Charleston was also a member of the Crawford team that won the 1935 Negro National Team pennant. The 1935 Crawfords team is considered the best in Negro League history.
Charleston&#x27;s career as a professional ballplayer was nearing its end when the Pittsburgh Crawfords was dissolved in 1939 and acquired by new owners. Charleston moved with the team to Toledo, Ohio, but it failed to attract enough fan support and relocated to Indianapolis in 1940. As it did in Ohio, the Indianapolis Crawfords failed to develop a fan base to sustain the team. Charleston retired as a professional player in 1941. From 1942 to 1944, he played for the integrated semipro Philadelphia Quartermaster Depot team in the city&#x27;s industrial league, garnering league player of the week honors in June 1943. In 1945 at the age of 49, Charleston briefly came out of retirement and made appearances in both games of a doubleheader while managing the Brooklyn Brown Dodgers as a pinch hitter and defensive replacement at first base.

===Team manager and scout, 1941–1954===
During the winter of 1940–41, Charleston returned to Pennsylvania to become manager of the Philadelphia Stars. The Stars finished the season with a 15–46 record and he was dismissed following the season. In 1944, he returned to the Stars as a first base coach. In 1945 Branch Rickey hired Charleston as manager of the Brooklyn Brown Dodgers in the United States League, but the team was short-lived. Its main purpose was to scout talented black players for the first integrated Major League Baseball teams. When this goal was met, the Brown Dodgers disbanded. Although Charleston was not involved in Jackie Robinson&#x27;s recruitment, he recruited others, including Roy Campanella.

In 1946 Charleston returned to managing the Philadelphia Stars for five seasons, eventually retiring at the end of 1950.

The integration of Major League Baseball teams in the late 1940s marked the decline and eventual end of the Negro leagues. In 1954 Charleston briefly came out of retirement to manage the Indianapolis Clowns, a barnstorming team that usually played on the road. The Clowns captured the Negro American League pennant in 1954 before Charleston returned to Philadelphia, shortly before his death that fall.

=== Umpiring ===
In addition to serving as a manager and scout, Charleston umpired for the Negro National League beginning in 1946. In 1947, he worked an NNL-NAL all star game at the Polo Grounds.

==Death and legacy==

In early October 1954, Charleston fell ill due to a heart attack or stroke. He was admitted to a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, hospital, and died on October 5, 1954, at the age of 57. Charleston&#x27;s remains are buried at Floral Park Cemetery in Indianapolis, Indiana.

A renowned player of his era, Charleston was recognized for his athletic skills as a powerful, hard-hitting slugger, his speed and aggressiveness as a base runner, and as a top outfielder. Observers often compared his play to elite contemporaries such as Ty Cobb, Tris Speaker, and Babe Ruth. Charleston ranks among Negro league baseball&#x27;s top five players in home runs and batting average, and its leader in stolen bases.

While &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 greatest baseball players, published in 1998, ranked Charleston only sixty-seventh, only four other black ballplayers who played all or most of their careers in pre-1947 Negro leagues placed higher on the list: Josh Gibson, Satchel Paige, Buck Leonard, and Cool Papa Bell. In 1999 Charleston was also nominated as a finalist for Major League Baseball&#x27;s All-20th Century Team.

Charleston&#x27;s reputation has grown considerably in recent decades. Baseball writer Bill James, author of &quot;The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot; (2001), reported that Charleston &quot;did everything exceptionally well&quot; and ranked him as the fourth-best player of all-time behind Ruth, Honus Wagner, and Willie Mays. Other baseball observers now consider Charleston as not just the greatest all-around Negro league ballplayer but possibly the greatest baseball player ever.

In addition, Charleston&#x27;s teammates and competitors such as Juanelo Mirabal, Buck O&#x27;Neil, and Turkey Stearnes, extol his greatness. “Oscar Charleston was Willie Mays before there was a Willie Mays,” said “Double Duty” Radcliffe shortly before his death in 2005, “except that he was a better base runner, a better center fielder and a better hitter.”

Hall of Fame manager John McGraw, whose career spanned forty years, once said, “If Oscar Charleston isn’t the greatest baseball player in the world, then I’m no judge of baseball talent.” Renowned sportswriter Grantland Rice wrote a column on Charleston titled “No Greater Ball Player” in which he proclaimed: “It’s impossible for anybody to be a better ballplayer than Oscar Charleston.”

<text>Bury (, ) is a market town on the River Irwell in the Metropolitan Borough of Bury, Greater Manchester, England. which had a population of 81,101 in 2021 while the wider borough had a population of 193,846.

The town was originally part of the county of Lancashire but has been in the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester since 1974. Bury emerged in the Industrial Revolution as a mill town manufacturing textiles. The town is known for the open-air Bury Market and black pudding, the traditional local dish.

Sir Robert Peel was born in the town. Peel was a Prime Minister of the United Kingdom who founded the Metropolitan Police and the Conservative Party. A memorial and monument for Peel, the former stands outside Bury Parish church and the latter overlooks the borough on Holcombe Hill. The town is east of Bolton, south-west of Rochdale and north-west of Manchester.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name &quot;Bury&quot; (also earlier known as &quot;Buri&quot; and &quot;Byri&quot;) comes from an Old English word, meaning &quot;castle&quot;, &quot;stronghold&quot; or &quot;fort&quot;, an early form of modern English &quot;borough&quot; (German &quot;burg&quot;).

===Early history===
Bury was formed around the ancient market place but there is evidence of activity dating back to the period of Roman occupation. Bury Museum has a Roman urn containing a number of small bronze coins dated for AD 253–282 and found north of what is now the town centre. Under Agricola the road-building programme included a route from the fort at Manchester (Mamucium) to the fort at Ribchester (Bremetennacum) which ran through Radcliffe and Affetside. The modern Watling Street, which serves the Seddons Farm estate on the west side of town, follows the approximate line of the Roman road.

The most imposing building in the early town would have been Bury Castle, a medieval manor house built in 1469 for Sir Thomas Pilkington. It sat in a good defensive position on high ground overlooking the Irwell Valley. The Pilkington family suffered badly in the Wars of the Roses when, despite geography, they supported the House of York. When Richard III was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, Thomas Pilkington was captured and later executed. The outcome of the battle was the Lancastrian Duke of Richmond being crowned Henry VII by Sir William Stanley. As a reward for the support of his family, Thomas Stanley was created Earl of Derby and, amongst other lands, the confiscated Pilkington estate in Bury was presented to him.

The ancestral home of the Earls of Derby is Knowsley Hall on the outskirts of Liverpool. The family maintains a connection with Bury in various ways—the Derby High School is named after them. When the school opened in 1959 the 18th Earl of Derby was patron and the school&#x27;s badge is based on the Earl&#x27;s coat of arms. The 15th and 16th earls were both supporters of Bury Grammar School, both financially and in terms of land, and one of the school houses is named &quot;Derby&quot; in their honour. The town was formerly home to the Derby Hall and the &quot;Derby Hotel&quot;.

The castle remains were buried beneath the streets outside the Castle Armoury until properly excavated for the first time in the 1970s.

Between 1801 and 1830, the population of the town more than doubled from 7,072 to 15,086. This was the time when the factories, mines and foundries, with their spinning machines and steam engines, began to dominate the landscape. In 1822 Bury Savings Bank opened on Silver Street established under government control and later became TSB.

===Industrial Revolution===
Probate evidence from the 17th century and the remains of 18th-century weavers&#x27; cottages in Elton, on the west side of Bury, indicate that domestic textile production was an important factor in the local economy at a time when Bury&#x27;s textile industry was dominated by woollens, and based upon the domestic production of yarn and cloth, as well as water-powered fulling mills.

Development was swift in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The establishment in 1773 by the family of Sir Robert Peel of Brooksbottom Mill in Summerseat, north of the town, as a calico printing works marked the beginning of the cotton industry in Bury. By the early 19th century, cotton was the predominant textile industry, with the Rivers Roch and Irwell providing power for spinning mills and processing water for the finishing trades. Development was further promoted when the town was linked to the national canal network by the Manchester, Bolton &amp; Bury Canal, fully opened in 1808. The canal was provided with water from Elton Reservoir, fed by aqueducts from a weir on the Irwell, north of what is now the Burrs Country Park. The Burrs is also the site of another mill developed by the Peel family, first founded in 1790. The remains are displayed for the public. There were seven cotton mills in Bury by 1818 and the population grew from 9,152 in 1801, to 20,710 in 1841, and then to 58,029 in 1901.

Following this, railways were opened, linking the town from Bury Bolton Street railway station to Manchester (via Prestwich and Radcliffe), to Rawtenstall and to Accrington. From the Knowsley Street railway station there were connections to the neighbouring mill towns of Bolton, Heywood and Rochdale. As well as the many cotton mills, other industries which thrived included paper-making, calico printing and some light engineering. The town expanded to incorporate the former townships of Elton, Walmersley and Heap, and rows of terraced houses encircled the town centre by the turn of the 19th century. Districts such as Freetown, Fishpool and Pimhole were transformed from farmers&#x27; fields to rows of terraces beside the factories and mills.

The houses were of the most limited kind, without basic facilities, sewers or proper streets. The result was the rapid spread of disease and high mortality rates in crowded areas. In 1838, out of 1,058 working class houses in Bury investigated by the Manchester Statistical Society, 733 had 3–4 people in each bed, 207 had 4–5, and 76 had 5–6. Social reformers locally and nationally were concerned about such issues, including Edwin Chadwick. One report that prepared the ground for the reform of public health matters, commissioned by the then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, asked local doctors for information. King Street, Bury, was highlighted: it had 10 houses, each with one bedroom, and a population of 69. The average age of death in Bury was 13.8 years. Towns like Bury were likened to &#x27;camps&#x27; where newcomers sought work in mill, mine or forge. Many, often from Ireland, found shelter in lodging houses. Thirty-eight in Bury were surveyed. Seventy-three per cent had men and women sharing beds indiscriminately, 81% were filthy and the average was 5.5 persons to a bed.

Although Bury had few of the classic late-19th-century spinning mills that were such a feature of other Lancashire towns, a group known as Peel Mills are still in use at Castlecroft Road. Immediately north of the town centre, their name is another reminder of the link with the Peel family.

===Lancashire Fusiliers===
According to writer Geoffrey Moorhouse, no history of Bury is complete without reference to its role as the regimental town of the Lancashire Fusiliers.

In 1688, Prince William of Orange (later King William III) landed at Brixham, Devon. He asked Colonel Sir Robert Peyton to raise a regiment containing six independent companies in the Exeter area. This regiment absorbed the previously enscripted men housed at the Wellington Barracks, who would have been any men over the age of 21. These men became the Lancashire Fusiliers once they joined William&#x27;s of Orange Men. Following successful recruitment, a regimental depot was established at Wellington Barracks in 1881. This barracks were originally built as a response to the Chartist movement, who were a mass movement of working-class men who protested via petition signatures.

The People&#x27;s Charter called for six reforms to make the political system more democratic:

# A vote for every man aged twenty-one years and above, of sound mind, and not undergoing punishment for a crime.
# The secret ballot to protect the elector in the exercise of his vote.
# No property qualification for Members of Parliament to allow the constituencies to return the man of their choice.
# Payment of Members, enabling tradesmen, working men, or other persons of modest means to leave or interrupt their livelihood to attend to the interests of the nation.
# Equal constituencies, securing the same amount of representation for the same number of electors, instead of allowing less populous constituencies to have as much or more weight than larger ones.
# Annual Parliamentary elections, thus presenting the most effectual check to bribery and intimidation, since no purse could buy a constituency under a system of universal manhood suffrage in every twelve months.

Chartists saw themselves fighting against political corruption and for democracy in an industrial society, but attracted support beyond the radical political groups for economic reasons, such as opposing wage cuts and unemployment.

===Recent history===

The post-war period saw a major decline in the cotton industry and, as with many neighbouring towns, Bury&#x27;s skyline was soon very different, with countless factory chimneys being pulled down and the associated mills closing their doors permanently. The old shopping area around Princess Street and Union Square was demolished in the late 1960s, and a concrete precinct was built to replace it. This development was replaced by the Mill Gate Shopping Centre in 1995.

On 23 November 1981, an F0/T1 tornado formed over Whitefield and subsequently moved through Bury town centre and surrounding areas.

In 2010 a £350m shopping development opened up around the Rock. The main street is populated mainly by independent shops and food outlets. At the top end of the street is a shopping area with a multi-screen cinema, bowling alley, and department stores including Marks &amp; Spencer, Primark, H&amp;M, Boots, Clarks, Poundland, Body Shop and Warren James Jewellers.

Bury also benefited from other facilities in the early 2010s including a new medical centre and office accommodation close to Bury Town Hall. A decision by Marks and Spencer to vacate its store in the Mill Gate Shopping Centre and move into a new larger one on The Rock emphasised a change of clientele in the town.

The town centre is famous for its traditional market, with its &quot;world famous&quot; black pudding stalls. Bury Market was also once famous for its tripe, although this has declined in recent decades. The Bury Black Pudding Company, owned by the Chadwick family, provides black pudding to retailers such as Harrods, and to major supermarkets, and the market is a destination for people from all over Greater Manchester and beyond. The last 30 years have seen the town develop into an important commuter town for neighbouring Manchester. Large-scale housing development has taken place around Unsworth, Redvales, Sunny Bank, Brandlesholme, Limefield, Chesham and Elton. The old railway line to Manchester Victoria closed in 1990 and was replaced by the light rapid transit system Metrolink in 1992. The town was also linked to the motorway network with the opening of the M66, accessed from the east side of the town, in 1978.

==Governance==
The town was initially a parish, then a select vestry with a &quot;board of guardians for the poor&quot;. Improvement commissioners were added before the borough charter was granted in 1876. In 1889, the town&#x27;s status was raised to that of a county borough of Lancashire.

The coat of arms was granted in 1877 and its symbols represent local industry. In the quarters are representations of the anvil (for forging), the golden fleece (the wool industry), a pair of crossed shuttles (the cotton industry) and a papyrus plant (the paper industry). Above them are a closed visor capped by a mayfly and two red roses. The Latin motto &quot;&quot;Vincit Omnia Industria&quot; translates as &quot;work conquers all&quot;&quot;.

With the passage of the Local Government Act 1972, Bury merged with the neighbouring municipal boroughs of Radcliffe and Prestwich, together with the urban districts of Whitefield, Tottington and Ramsbottom in 1974 to become the Metropolitan Borough of Bury. The borough is part of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester.

On 3 July 2008, a referendum was held in the borough to decide whether it should be ruled by a directly elected mayor. The proposal was rejected by the voters.

==Geography==
Bury is located on the edge of the western Pennines in North West England, in the northern part of the Greater Manchester Urban Area. Its position on the River Irwell has proved important in its history and development. Flowing from north to south, the river divides the town into two parts on the east and west sides of the valley, respectively. The town centre sits close to, and above, the river on the east side. Bury Bridge is a key bridging point, linking the east side of town and the town centre with the western suburbs and Bolton beyond. Other bridges across the river are few—there is one at Radcliffe Road to the south and one at Summerseat to the north. There is a bridge at the Burrs, but it serves a cul-de-sac and does not allow full east–west access. To the south, the main tributary (the River Roch, flowing from the east) joins the Irwell close to another significant bridging point, Blackford Bridge. This carries the main road south (the A56) towards Manchester.

Bury experiences a warm temperate climate with warm summers and cool winters owing to the shielding effect of the Western Pennine Moors. Summer is the driest time of the year with low rainfall. Bury rarely experiences temperatures over , due to oceanic north easterly winds. In summer, the temperature is warm and Bury experiences much sun. Winters are cool; temperatures can drop below freezing between December and March. There is not much extreme weather in Bury; floods are rare since the town is on higher ground, although flood is occasionally seen in Ramsbottom. Early summer thunderstorms bring high rainfall.

For purposes of the Office for National Statistics, Bury is part of the Greater Manchester Urban Area.

==Demography==
At the 2001 census the town of Bury had a total population of 77,211, whereas the wider Metropolitan Borough had a population of 183,200.

==Landmarks==

Attractions in Bury include:

* Bury Art Museum, containing the Wrigley collection of paintings, which includes works by J. M. W. Turner, Edwin Henry Landseer, John Constable and Peter De Wint. The building, by Woodhouse and Willoughby in 1899, was described by Pevsner as &quot;probably the best building in Bury.&quot;
* Bury Castle is a fortified manor house built in the mid-13th century by Sir Thomas Pilkington and is now protected as a scheduled monument; the foundations have been excavated and have been open to the public since 2000.
* Bury Parish Church, on the Market Place in the centre of the town, is a Grade I listed building.
* Bury&#x27;s &#x27;World-Famous&#x27; Market has been in operation for nearly 600 years; the original licence for a market was granted in 1444. In 2006, of 1,150 markets in the UK, Bury Market was voted the best &#x27;British Market of the Year&#x27; by the National Association of British Market Authorities. The market was also selected as BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Food and Farming Awards&quot; Market of the Year in 2008. It receives over 1,000 coachloads of visitors every year.
* Castlesteads is an ancient promontory fort and scheduled monument.
* Peel Tower, Harcles Hill, above Holcombe village, Ramsbottom. The tower was built in remembrance of Sir Robert Peel, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and founder of the Metropolitan Police, who was born in Bury and was responsible for the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. Hundreds of people climb to the tower each year on Good Friday. Historically this gathering had a principally religious purpose, since the hill was said to be strikingly similar to the hill that Jesus climbed (Calvary) before his crucifixion on Good Friday.

* Whitehead Clock Tower stands in Whitehead Garden, separated from the Town Hall by a railway cutting. It was erected in 1913 as a memorial to Walter Whitehead, a surgeon of international repute who was born in the town.
* East Lancashire Railway, a heritage railway which runs from the town to Heywood, Ramsbottom and Rawtenstall. Based at Bury Bolton Street railway station.
* The Fusilier Museum, a regimental museum of the Lancashire Fusiliers on Moss Street in Bury.
* Manchester Road, Silver Street and environs contain many examples of Late Georgian brick terrace and York stone housing.

Bury is home to several fine sculptures and pieces of public art. Edward Hodges Baily&#x27;s 1851 statue of Sir Robert Peel stands in the centre of town, while Lutyens&#x27; Lancashire Fusiliers War Memorial can be found outside the Fusilier Museum. George Frampton&#x27;s &#x27;cheering fusilier&#x27;, a tribute to those who died in the Boer War, stands in Whitehead Garden near the town hall. The Kay Monument, a solid pavilion with a stone dome capped with a bronze Fame, commemorates John Kay, the inventor of the flying shuttle which revolutionised the weaving industry. Designed by William Venn Gough in 1908, it holds a number of sculpted bronze plaques by John Cassidy. Contemporary works include Ron Silliman&#x27;s text piece &quot;From Northern Soul (Bury Neon)&quot; at Bury Interchange.

==Transport==
Bury is connected to other settlements via bus services, Metrolink and the heritage railway.

Between 1903 and 1949, the Bury Corporation Tramways network served the town.

Bury Bolton Street railway station, first opened in 1846 and substantially rebuilt in the 1880s and again in the 1950s, is now home to the East Lancashire Railway, a heritage railway which serves Heywood, Ramsbottom and Rawtenstall but does not provide a regular commuter service. The station is the original railway station of Bury and was a mainline station until 1980, although after December 1966 passenger services were reduced to a commuter service to Manchester only (formerly there were services to Ramsbottom, Rawtenstall and Bacup to the north of Bury also from Bolton Street station).

Bury was served by two major railway stations between 1848 and 1970, when Bury Knowsley Street railway station was closed. Bury Knowsley Street station had passenger services travelling east–west through Bury, connecting the town directly to both Bolton and Heywood. After October 1970 services to and from Manchester were the only passenger rail services connecting Bury to the national rail network. Bury to Manchester Victoria rail services were provided by Class 504 units, which were third-rail operated, in the 1970s and 1980s. Bury Interchange opened in March 1980 close to the site of the former Knowsley Street station (which was demolished in the early 1970s). It was the replacement for the Bolton Street railway station (which was subsequently taken over the East Lancashire Railway heritage line in 1987), and initially incorporated a railway station, with services to Manchester Victoria, and a bus station. Third-rail-powered heavy rail passenger services integrated with the national rail network ceased in 1991, with Metrolink taking over the line and trams operating the line since April 1992. As a result, Bury has not had a conventional heavy rail link to the national network since 1991.

Currently, most buses are run by the Bee Network (Which replaced those run by Diamond North West), Go North West, and Rosso, (with some buses run by Vision Bus) connecting with destinations within Greater Manchester, Rossendale, Blackburn and Burnley. It is planned that all buses from Bury running within Greater Manchester will be incorporated into the Bee Network by March 2024. The bus station is connected to the Bury Interchange Metrolink tram stop, to provide a vast complex of inter-modal transport. There is also a free car park at the rear of the complex and a cycle hub for parking bikes during the day. The station is located in the centre of Bury, close to Bury Market, the Millgate Shopping Centre, the Rock and the main square.

Manchester Metrolink operates trams to Altrincham and Piccadilly from Bury. There is generally a service every 6 minutes from Bury to Manchester city centre, with every other tram continuing to Altrincham.

Bury hosts several music festivals yearly, including the Glaston-Bury Festival on the August bank holiday weekend, and Head for the Hills Festival (previously known as Ramsbottom Festival) closing the festival season in mid-September. While Glaston-Bury hosts mainly local/upcoming bands, Head for the Hills hosts a wider range of talent, including bands such as Soul II Soul, The Proclaimers and Maxïmo Park. The festival also has a popular silent disco, where DJs battle for the larger audience. For the past two years, this battle has largely been dominated by the DJ team &quot;BABs&quot;, a brother and sister partnership from the local village of Edenfield.

===Food===

Bury is known for its black puddings so much so, that it is not uncommon to see it marketed as &quot;Bury Black Pudding&quot; on a menu. Bury simnel cake is a variant of the cake originating in Bury. The town was also notable for tripe, though there is little demand for this in modern times.

==Notable people==

* Sir Robert Peel (1788–1850), the 19th century Prime Minister of the United Kingdom best known today for the repeal of the Corn Laws and his introduction of the modern police force (hence the terms &quot;Bobbies&quot; and &quot;Peelers&quot;), was born in Bury. He is also notable for forming the famous British Police division, &#x27;Scotland Yard&#x27; in London. A monument, Peel Tower, now exists to his memory. As this is situated nearly 1,000 feet above sea level, it is easily recognisable for miles around. The tower itself was not built for Sir Robert, but to provide work for local workers and was later dedicated to him. A statue of Peel stands in Market Place, outside the &quot;Robert Peel&quot; public house. The statue of Sir Robert has his waistcoat fastening the wrong way round.
* John Kay (1704 – 1779), the inventor of the flying shuttle, one of the key inventions of the Industrial Revolution. He was born to a yeoman farming family at Park, a hamlet just north of Bury, on 16 June 1704. A memorial to John Kay stands in the heart of Bury in Kay Gardens. He also features as one of twelve subjects of the Manchester Murals by Ford Madox Brown which decorate the Great Hall of Manchester Town Hall and depict the history of the city. The piece shows Kay being smuggled to safety as rioters, who feared their jobs were in danger, sought to destroy looms whose invention he had made possible. This was a key moment in the struggle between labour and new technology. He eventually fled to France and died in poverty.
* James Wood, mathematician, Dean of Ely and Master of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, was born at Holcombe, Bury, in 1760. A pupil at Bury Grammar School, he won an exhibition to St John&#x27;s College and was a college tutor from 1789 to 1814. During this time he published &quot;The Principles of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy&quot;. He was appointed Dean of Ely in 1820. He served as Master of St John&#x27;s from 1815 and left his library to the college upon his death in 1839.
* Professor Sir John Charnley, born the son of a Bury pharmacist in 1911. He wrote &quot;The Closed Treatment of Common Fractures&quot;, first published in 1950, which became a standard text for the subject. His subsequent achievement in developing hip replacement surgery, in 1962, is acknowledged as a ground breaking development that changed the approach to orthopaedic surgery. He established a centre for hip surgery at Wrightington Hospital, near Wigan where he worked. He was knighted for his work in 1977. The John Charnley Research Institute at Wrightington Hospital near Wigan, was named in his honour.

<text>East Finchley is a London Underground station in East Finchley in the London Borough of Barnet, north London. The station is on the High Barnet branch of the Northern line, between Finchley Central and Highgate stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 3.

The station was opened on 22 August 1867, on the Great Northern Railway&#x27;s line between Finsbury Park and Edgware stations. As part of London Underground&#x27;s only partially completed Northern Heights plan, the station was completely rebuilt with additional tracks in the late 1930s. Northern line trains started serving the station on 3 July 1939 and main line passenger services ended on 2 March 1941.

==History==
===Original station===
East Finchley station was built by the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway (EH&amp;LR) on its line from Finsbury Park station to Edgware station. Before the line was opened, it was purchased in July 1867 by the larger Great Northern Railway (GNR), whose main line from King&#x27;s Cross ran through Finsbury Park on its way to Potters Bar and the north. The station, originally named &quot;East End, Finchley&quot;, opened along with the railway to Edgware on 22 August that year. The station was given its current name either on 1 February 1887 or, alternatively, in 1886. As a result of the Railways Act 1921, which created the &quot;Big Four&quot; railway companies, the GNR amalgamated with several other railways to create the London &amp; North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923.

At the start of the 1930s, the station had around 54 trains daily from High Barnet and a few through trains from Edgware. Services ran to Finsbury Park and then either King&#x27;s Cross, Moorgate or Broad Street.
===Northern Heights project===
In 1935, the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) announced a proposal, which became known as the Northern Heights project. This was to take over the LNER lines from Finsbury Park to Edgware, High Barnet and Alexandra Palace, and link them to both the Northern line at East Finchley and to the Northern City line at Finsbury Park. The construction of the first phase of this project involved extending tube train services from the Northern line&#x27;s existing terminus at Archway station, through a new section of paired tunnels under the LNER&#x27;s Highgate station to emerge south-east of East Finchley station, where track connections to the LNER line were made.
For the introduction of London Underground services, the original station was completely demolished and rebuilt. The station was provided with two additional platforms, giving four in total. The platforms comprise two parallel islands with tracks on both sides. This was necessary as the intention of the Northern Heights project was that trains would be able to run south from East Finchley to Highgate via both the surface and the underground routes. The inner pair of tracks served the surface route, whilst the outer pair serve the tunnel route.

Northern line trains first served the station on 3 July 1939. After completion of the electrification of the line to High Barnet, Underground services were extended northwards on 14 April 1940. The station continued to be served by LNER steam trains from Highgate until 2 March 1941 when that service was discontinued. The inner platforms are now used only by northbound trains entering service or southbound trains terminating at East Finchley on their way to or from Highgate Wood depot south of the station.

===Post-war===
After the war, plans to complete the Northern Heights project were reviewed but no work was carried out. Maintenance works and reconstruction of war damage on the existing network had the greatest call on London Underground funds. Funds for new works were severely limited and priority was given to the completion of the western and eastern extensions of the Central line to West Ruislip, Epping and Hainault. Despite being shown as under construction on underground maps as late as 1950, work never restarted on the unimplemented parts of the Northern Heights project.

British Railways (the successor to the LNER) freight trains continued to serve the station&#x27;s goods yard until 1 October 1962, when it was closed.

==Description of the building==

The new station was constructed in an &quot;Art Deco&quot;/&quot;Streamline Moderne&quot; design by Charles Holden with L H Bucknell. Like Holden&#x27;s other designs for London Underground in the 1930s, East Finchley station was inspired by European architecture (particularly Dutch) that Holden had seen on trips to the continent during that decade. The track here runs roughly north-west to south-east. The imposing station building, built on rising ground adjacent to the railway bridge over High Road (A1000), has three entrances. The two main entrances to the ticket hall are on the north side of the tracks facing High Road and the third, minor entrance, is on the south side. The entrances are linked by a passage under the tracks which provides access up to the platforms.

A strong feature of the station is the semi-circular glazed stairways leading to the enclosed bridge over the tracks occupied by staff offices. Prominent from the platforms and dominating the main entrance façade is &quot;The Archer&quot;, a statue by Eric Aumonier of a kneeling archer captured as if having just released an arrow. The archer is intended to commemorate Finchley&#x27;s ancient association with hunting in the nearby Royal Forest of Enfield. The station is a Grade II listed building.
==Services and connections==
===Services===
The station is in Travelcard Zone 3, between Finchley Central and Highgate stations. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 3–7 minutes between 05:40 and 01:01 northbound and 05:34 and 00:12 southbound (as of 2015).

===Connections===
London Buses routes 102, 143, 234, 263, 603 and H3 and night route N20 serve the station.

<doc id="300815" wikidata="Q808233" url="?curid=300815" title="Bark scale">
<text>The Bark scale is a psychoacoustical scale proposed by Eberhard Zwicker in 1961. It is named after Heinrich Barkhausen, who proposed the first subjective measurements of loudness. One definition of the term is &quot;a frequency scale on which equal distances correspond with perceptually equal distances. Above about 500 Hz this scale is more or less equal to a logarithmic frequency axis. Below 500 Hz the Bark scale becomes more and more linear.&quot;

The scale ranges from 1 to 24 and corresponds to the first 24 critical bands of hearing.

It is related to, but somewhat less popular than, the mel scale, a perceptual scale of pitches judged by listeners to be equal in distance from one another.

== Bark scale critical bands ==

Since the direct measurements of the critical bands are subject to error, the values in this table have been generously rounded.

In his letter &quot;Subdivision of the Audible Frequency Range into Critical Bands&quot;, Zwicker states:

&quot;These bands have been directly measured in experiments on the threshold for complex sounds, on masking, on the perception of phase, and most often on the loudness of complex sounds. In all these phenomena, the critical band seems to play an important role. It must be pointed out that the measurements taken so far indicate that the critical bands have a certain width, but that their position on the frequency scale is not fixed; rather, the position can be changed continuously, perhaps by the ear itself.&quot;

Thus the important attribute of the Bark scale is the width of the critical band at any given frequency, not the exact values of the edges or centers of any band.

== Conversions ==
To convert a frequency &quot;f&quot; (Hz) into Bark use:
:formula_1

or (Traunmüller, 1990) 
:formula_2

or (Wang, Sekey &amp; Gersho, 1992)
:formula_3

<doc id="300820" wikidata="Q845985" url="?curid=300820" title="Negrito">
<text>The term Negrito (; ) refers to several diverse ethnic groups who inhabit isolated parts of Southeast Asia and the Andaman Islands. Populations often described as Negrito include: the Andamanese peoples (including the Great Andamanese, the Onge, the Jarawa, and the Sentinelese) of the Andaman Islands, the Semang peoples (among them, the Batek people) of Peninsular Malaysia, the Maniq people of Southern Thailand, as well as the Aeta of Luzon, the Ati and Tumandok of Panay, the Mamanwa of Mindanao, and about 30 other officially recognized ethnic groups in the Philippines.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Negrito,&quot; the Spanish diminutive of &quot;negro&quot;, is used to mean &quot;little black person.&quot; This usage was coined by 16th-century Spanish missionaries operating in the Philippines, and was borrowed by other European travellers and colonialists across Austronesia to label various peoples perceived as sharing relatively small physical stature and dark skin. Contemporary usage of an alternative Spanish epithet, &quot;Negrillos&quot;, also tended to bundle these peoples with the pygmy peoples of Central Africa on the basis of perceived similarities in stature and complexion. (Historically, the label &quot;Negrito&quot; has also been used to refer to African pygmies.) The appropriateness of bundling peoples of different ethnicities by similarities in stature and complexion has been called into question.

== Population ==
There are over 100,000 Negritos in the Philippines. In 2010, there were 50,236 Aeta people in the Philippines. There were 55,473 Ati people (2020 census). Officially, Malaysia had approximately 4,800 Negrito (Semangs). This number increases if we include some of the populations or individual groups among Orang Asli who have either assimilated Negrito population or have admixed origins. According to the 2006 census, the number of Orang Asli was 141,230 
Andamanese of India with just c. over 500. Thailand Negrito Maniq is estimated 300, divided into several clans. Other puts it at 382 or less than 500.

== Culture ==

Most groups designated as &quot;Negrito&quot; lived as hunter-gatherers, while some also used agriculture, such as plant harvesting. Today most live assimilated to the majority population of their respective homeland. Discrimination and poverty are often problems, caused either by their lower social position, their hunter-gatherer lifestyles, or both.

==Origins==

Based on perceived physical similarities, Negritos were once considered a single population of closely related people. However, genetic studies suggest that they consist of several separate groups descended from the same ancient East Eurasian meta-population that gave rise to modern East Asian peoples and Oceanian peoples, as well as displaying genetic heterogeneity. The Negritos form the indigenous population of Southeast Asia, but were largely absorbed by Austroasiatic- and Austronesian-speaking groups who migrated from southern East Asia into Mainland and Insular Southeast Asia with the Neolithic expansion. The remainders form minority groups in geographically isolated regions.

Genetic studies provided mixed evidence of modern Negrito populations, with admixtures in different. Studies indicate that Negrito populations are closer to their neighboring non-Negrito communities in their paternal heritage and overall DNA on average.

It has been found that the physical and morphological phenotypes of Negritos, such as short stature, a wide and snub nose, curly hair and dark skin, &quot;are shaped by novel mechanisms for adaptation to tropical rainforests&quot; through convergent evolution and positive selection, rather than a remnant of a shared common ancestor, as suggested previously by some researchers.

A Negrito-like population was most likely also present in Taiwan before the Neolithic expansion and must have persisted into historical times, as suggested by evidence from morphological features of human skeletal remains dating from around 6,000 years ago resembling Negritos (especially Aetas in northern Luzon), and further corroborated by Chinese reports from the Qing period rule of Taiwan (1684 to 1895) and from tales of Taiwanese indigenous peoples about people with &quot;dark skin, short-and-small body stature, frizzy hair, and occupation in forested mountains or remote caves&quot;.

<text>de Volkskrant (; ) is a Dutch daily morning newspaper. Founded in 1919, it has a nationwide circulation of about 250,000.

Formerly a leading centre-left Catholic broadsheet, &quot;de Volkskrant&quot; today is a medium-sized centrist compact. Pieter Klok is the current editor-in-chief.

==History and profile==
&quot;De Volkskrant&quot; was founded in 1919 and has been a daily morning newspaper since 1921. Originally &quot;de Volkskrant&quot; was a Roman Catholic newspaper closely linked to the Catholic People&#x27;s Party and the Catholic pillar. The paper temporarily ceased publication in 1941.

On its re-founding in 1945, its office moved from Den Bosch to Amsterdam. It became a left-wing newspaper in the 1960s, but began softening its stance in 1980. On 23 August 2006 the &quot;Volkskrant&quot; published its 25,000th edition.

In 1968, the ownership of &quot;De Volkskrant&quot; and &quot;Het Parool&quot; merged into a new parent, De Perscombinatie. &quot;Het Parool&quot; gained control due to the larger investment in the parent. De Perscombinatie started joint printing. In 1975, &quot;Trouw&quot; joined. In 1994 De Perscombinatie acquired Uitgeverij Meulenhoff &amp; Co and became PCM Uitgevers. In 1995 PCM acquired the larger Nederlandse Dagblad Unie, owners of the &quot;Algemeen Dagblad&quot; en &quot;NRC Handelsblad&quot;. In 1996 it acquired &quot;De Volkskrant&quot;. PCM was acquired in 2009 by De Persgroep from Belgium and in December 2009 renamed De Persgroup Nederland, now DPG Media Nederland.

In 2010, Pieter Broertjes completed his 20-year tenure as editor-in-chief. In 2013 &quot;de Volkskrant&quot; was awarded the European Newspaper of the Year in the category of nationwide newspapers.

In October 2006, &quot;de Volkskrant&quot; announced it intended to start publishing a free version of its paper, targeting young people. As PCM gave no permission this never happened.

==Circulation==
In 2001 the circulation of &quot;De Volkskrant&quot; was 335,000 copies.

Print circulation remains the third largest of the Netherlands, after &quot;De Telegraaf&quot; and &quot;Algemeen Dagblad&quot;.

==Typeface==
The typeface Capitolium News by Gerard Unger (2006) has been the main type used in &quot;de Volkskrant&quot; since 2 December 2006.

<doc id="300824" wikidata="Q11365639" url="?curid=300824" title="Metropolitan Borough of Wirral">
<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Wirral is a metropolitan borough of Merseyside, in North West England. It has a population of (), and encompasses of the northern part of the Wirral Peninsula. Major settlements include Birkenhead, Wallasey, Bebington, Heswall, Hoylake and West Kirby. It is one of the six boroughs of the Liverpool City Region, a combined authority area with a population of more than 1.5 million.

Wirral is England&#x27;s westernmost metropolitan borough, faced by the City of Liverpool to the northeast over the River Mersey. 

==Geography==

Bordering is the River Mersey to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and the River Dee to the west; the borough of Cheshire West and Chester occupies the remainder of the Wirral Peninsula and borders the borough of Wirral to the south. 

== History ==
The borough was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, as a merger of the county boroughs of Birkenhead and Wallasey, along with the municipal borough of Bebington and the urban districts of Hoylake and Wirral.

== Governance ==
===Liverpool City Region Combined Authority===

The Metropolitan Borough of Wirral is one of the six constituent local government districts of the Liverpool City Region. Since 1 April 2014, some of the borough&#x27;s responsibilities have been pooled with neighbouring authorities within the metropolitan area and subsumed into the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority.

The combined authority has effectively become the top-tier administrative body for the local governance of the city region and the leader of Wirral Borough Council, along with the five other leaders from neighbouring local government districts, take strategic decisions over economic development, transport, employment and skills, tourism, culture, housing and physical infrastructure.

As of July 2015, negotiations are currently taking place between the UK national government and the combined authority over a possible devolution deal to confer greater powers on the region. Discussions include whether to introduce an elected &#x27;Metro Mayor&#x27; to oversee the entire metropolitan area.

===Wirral Borough Council Composition===

After the local elections in 2008 the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral was governed by a Labour Party/Liberal Democrat coalition, the second and third largest parties on the council respectively. Steve Foulkes of Labour was leader of the council. The Conservative Party was the largest party represented, and was in opposition with its leader Jeff Green being leader of the opposition.

After the local elections in 2010 the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral was governed by a Conservative Party/Liberal Democrat coalition, which reflected the coalition at national level. The Conservative Party, continuing to be the largest party represented on the council increased its number of seats by 2 to 27 and has now entered into coalition government with the Liberal Democrats as the leading coalition partner with the leader of the Conservatives, Jeff Green, becoming the new leader of the council. The Labour Party increased its representation on the council by 4 to 24 and remained the second largest party though they are now in opposition with their leader, Steve Foulkes, who was leader of the council now leader of the opposition. The Liberal Democrats lost 4 seats decreasing their tally to 15 remaining the third largest party on the council but continuing to participate in the governing of the council as the junior coalition partner to the Conservatives. The one independent represented on the council lost their seat.

After the local elections in 2011 the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral was governed by a minority Labour Party administration. Foulkes was leader of the council with Phil Davies as deputy leader. The Liberal Democrats lost a councillor who switched to Labour, Steve Niblock shortly after the elections. There are now no independents on Wirral Council. Labour have 36 seats, Conservatives have 23 and the Liberal Democrats 7.

In February 2012 the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats defeated the Labour administration in a motion of no confidence and the two parties governed again until the May election. Labour made gains in May 2012, gaining majority control of the council for the first time since local elections in 2002 saw Labour become a minority. 

In 2014, the Green Party gained their first seat on the council, defeating Labour in their typically safe seat of Birkenhead and Tranmere. They retained it in 2018 with an increased vote share, albeit with a reduced majority. In the 2023 local elections, the Green Party won 13 seats. Since May 2023, the council has been led by Labour councillor Paul Stuart.

Plans were announced in 2006 for a £4.5bn development around the docklands to be called Wirral Waters. The development is a mixture of industrial, office, residential and leisure facilities. Planning permission was granted in 2010 and work began on the site in 2011, with development work potentially lasting for 30 years.

== Education ==
When the borough was set up in 1974, it inherited comprehensive systems from the former County Boroughs of Birkenhead and Wallasey. In the part of Wirral formerly administered by Cheshire County Council, it inherited a selective system of grammar and secondary modern non-Roman Catholic schools and a comprehensive Roman Catholic school (St John Plessington Catholic College).

Until the implementation of the Education Reform Act 1988, education in Wirral continued to be organised in four areas; Birkenhead, Wallasey and the former parts of Cheshire known for education purposes as &quot;Bebington&quot; and &quot;Deeside&quot;. However this Act introduced &quot;open enrolment&quot;, allowing parents from anywhere in the borough, and outside it, to apply for a place for their child at any secondary school. As a result, significant numbers of pupils from the former &quot;comprehensive areas&quot; attend schools in the former &quot;selective areas&quot; and vice versa. The distinction between different types of school was to an extent masked, as all secondary modern and most comprehensive schools were named &quot;High School&quot;. As a further result of this Act, St Anselm&#x27;s College and Upton Hall School, both within the Birkenhead education area, became the only independent schools in the country to become state funded grant-maintained schools, retaining selective admissions policies to become Roman Catholic grammar schools.

A further change came as a result of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, which effectively changed secondary modern schools into comprehensives as schools were no longer permitted to select by examination failure. In summary, Wirral now has a state secondary sector made up of 16 comprehensive schools (of which two are Roman Catholic) and 6 grammar schools (of which two are Roman Catholic).

==Political makeup==

<text>Trafford is a metropolitan borough of Greater Manchester, England, with an estimated population of in . It covers and includes the area of Old Trafford and the towns of Altrincham, Stretford, Urmston, Partington and Sale. The borough was formed in 1974 as a merger of six former districts and part of a seventh. The River Mersey flows through the borough, separating North Trafford from South Trafford, and the historic counties of Lancashire and Cheshire. Trafford is the seventh-most populous district in Greater Manchester.

There is evidence of Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Roman activity in the area, two castles – one of them a Scheduled Ancient Monument – and over 200 listed buildings. In the late 19th century, the population rapidly expanded with the arrival of the railway. Trafford is the home of Manchester United F.C. and Lancashire County Cricket Club, as well as Altrincham F.C. and Trafford F.C.. The Imperial War Museum North, opened in 2002, is located in the borough.

Trafford has a strong economy with low levels of unemployment and contains both Trafford Park industrial estate and the Trafford Centre, a large out-of-town shopping centre. Apart from the City of Manchester, Trafford is the only borough in Greater Manchester to be above the national average for weekly income. Socially, the area includes both working class and middle class areas like Bowdon and Hale. In Parliament, Trafford is represented by three constituencies: Stretford and Urmston; Altrincham and Sale West; and Wythenshawe and Sale East, which mainly covers neighbouring Manchester.

== History ==
The borough was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of six former districts which were abolished at the same time, as well as four civil parishes from a seventh abolished district:
*Altrincham Municipal Borough
*Bowdon Urban District
*Carrington‡
*Dunham Massey‡
*Hale Urban District
*Partington‡
*Sale Municipal Borough
*Stretford Municipal Borough
*Urmston Urban District
*Warburton‡
‡ Parishes from Bucklow Rural District

Stretford and Urmston had been in the administrative county of Lancashire prior to the 1974 reforms, whilst all the others had been in the administrative county of Cheshire. The new district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chairman of the council to take the title of mayor.

The choice of the name Trafford for the borough was a &quot;compromise between Altrincham, Stretford and Sale&quot;, and &quot;seemed to have wide support&quot;. A Liberal councillor for the Municipal Borough of Sale suggested &quot;Crossford ... whilst &quot;Watlingford&quot; was suggested by councillors in Hale, after the supposed name of an ancient Roman road in the district. Those names were rejected in favour of Trafford, because of the district&#x27;s &quot;famous sports venue, a major employer as well as historic associations&quot;, referring to Old Trafford (cricket and football), Trafford Park and the de Trafford baronets respectively.

As a place name, Trafford is an Anglo-French version of Stratford, deriving from the Old English words &quot;stræt&quot; (a street, more specifically a Roman road) and ford (crossing). The Metropolitan Borough of Trafford has existed since 1974, but the area it covers has a long history. Neolithic arrowheads have been discovered in Altrincham and Sale, and there is evidence of Bronze Age habitation in Timperley. Fragments of Roman pottery have been found in Urmston, and Roman coins have been found in Sale. The Roman road between the legionary fortresses at Chester (Deva Victrix) and York (Eboracum) crosses Trafford, passing through Stretford, Sale, and Altrincham. The settlements in Trafford have been based largely around agriculture, although Altrincham was founded as a market town in the mid 13th century. Although the Industrial Revolution affected Trafford, the area did not experience the same rate of growth as the rest of Greater Manchester. A 100% increase in population in the Trafford area between 1841 and 1861 was a direct result of an influx due to the construction of the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway, which allowed residents to commute more easily from Trafford into Manchester. The area developed its own centres of industry in Broadheath (founded in 1885) and Trafford Park (founded in 1897). They have since declined, although Trafford Park still employs 40–50,000 people. Today, Trafford is mostly a commuter area. The borough was formed on 1 April 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972 as one of the ten metropolitan districts of Greater Manchester.

== Geography ==
The metropolitan boroughs of the City of Salford and the City of Manchester border Trafford to the north and east respectively; the Cheshire East area of Cheshire lies to the south. The geology of South Trafford is Keuper marl with some Keuper waterstone and sandstone, whilst the geology of North Trafford is Bunter sandstone. The River Mersey runs east to west through the area, separating North Trafford from South Trafford; other rivers in Trafford include the Bollin, the River Irwell, Sinderland Brook, and Crofts Bank Brook. The Bridgewater Canal, opened in 1761 and completed in 1776, follows a course through Trafford roughly north to south and passes through Stretford, Sale, and Altrincham. The Manchester Ship Canal, opened in 1894, forms part of Trafford&#x27;s northern and western boundaries with Salford.

Trafford is generally flat, with most of the land lying between and above sea level, apart from Bowdon Hill in South Trafford which rises above sea level. The lowest point in Trafford, near Warburton, is above sea level. There are areas of mossland in low-lying areas: Warburton Moss, Dunham Moss, and Hale Moss. Greenspace accounts for 51.8% of Trafford&#x27;s total area, domestic buildings and gardens comprise 25.6%, the rest is made up of roads and non-domestic buildings.

Localities within the boundaries of Trafford include:

North Trafford: Cornbrook, Davyhulme, Firswood, Flixton, Gorse Hill, Lostock, Old Trafford, Stretford, Trafford Park and Urmston.

South Trafford: Altrincham, Ashton-Upon-Mersey, Bowdon, Broadheath, Brooklands, Carrington, Dunham Massey, Hale, Hale Barns, Oldfield Brow, Partington, Sale, Sale Moor, Timperley, Warburton and West Timperley.

== Governance ==

=== Representation ===
The residents of Trafford Metropolitan Borough are represented in the British Parliament by Members of Parliament (MPs) for three separate parliamentary constituencies. Altrincham and Sale West is represented by Connor Rand MP (Labour). Stretford and Urmston is represented by Andrew Western MP (Labour). Wythenshawe and Sale East, which also covers parts of the City of Manchester, is represented by Mike Kane MP (Labour).

=== Council ===
In 1974, Trafford Council was created to administer the newly formed Trafford Metropolitan Borough and is headquartered at Trafford Town Hall, which was previously named Stretford Town Hall. On its formation in 1974, the council was controlled by the Conservative Party; the Conservatives have been in control 1973–85, 1988–94, and 2004–2018. The only time the Labour Party was in control was 1996–2002, and 2019 to the present. The rest of the time were periods of no overall control. The council meets to decide policy and allocate budget. Its duties include setting levels of council tax, monitoring the health service in Trafford, providing social care, and funding schools. Cllr Andrew Western is the leader of the council as of 2021, and Cllr Laurence Walsh is the current mayor.

In 2007 the Audit Commission judged Trafford Council to be &quot;improving strongly&quot; in providing services for local people. Overall the council was awarded &quot;three star&quot; status meaning it was &quot;performing well&quot; and &quot;consistently above minimum requirements&quot;, similar to 46% of all local authorities. In 2008–09, Trafford council had a budget of £150.5 million. This was collected from council tax (57%) and government grants (43%). The council spent £31.8 million on children and young people&#x27;s services (21%); £60.1 million on community services and social care (40%); £34.4 million on &quot;prosperity, planning, and development&quot; (23%); and £33.8 million on customer and corporate services (22%).

Civil parishes form the bottom tier of local government; the parish councils are involved in planning, management of town and parish centres, and promoting tourism. In 2001, 8,484 people (4.0% of the borough&#x27;s population) lived in Trafford&#x27;s four civil parishes: Carrington, Dunham Massey, Partington, and Warburton. They were all previously part of Bucklow Rural District. A rural district was a type of local government district for the administration of predominantly rural areas. The rest of Trafford is unparished. The unparished areas are: Altrincham (Municipal Borough), Bowdon (Urban District), Hale (Urban District), Sale (Municipal Borough), Stretford (Municipal Borough), and Urmston (Urban District). The status of each area prior to 1974 is shown in brackets. An urban district was a type of local government district which covered an urbanised area.

Following the 2018 local elections, the council, which was previously Conservative-held, came under Labour control in the form of a minority administration supported by the Liberal Democrats in a confidence and supply administration. There were a few shock results, such as in Altrincham (ward), where the Green Party gained seats from the incumbent Conservative councillors. After gaining seats in the 2019 local elections, the Labour Party was in a position to form a majority-controlling administration.

==== Electoral wards ====
There are 21 electoral wards in Trafford, each with 3 councillors, giving a total of 63 councillors with one-third elected three years out of four. In the following table, which lists the wards before the boundary changes of 2023, the populations for each ward are based on 2013 population estimates from the Office for National Statistics.

==== Coat of arms ====

The coat of arms of Trafford Council depicts a griffin on a shield flanked by two unicorns. The line bisecting the shield horizontally symbolises the River Mersey running through Trafford from east to west and the canals in the borough. The white legs of a lion on a red background represent the parts of Trafford previously controlled by the De Massey family, while the red body and head of an eagle on a white background represents the areas of Trafford previously controlled by the De Traffords. Both elements were taken from the coats of arms of the respective families. The fist holding bolts of lightning represents Stretford and the electrical industry; the cog on the arm represents Altrincham&#x27;s engineering industry. The unicorns stand for Sale and Altrincham. The oak branches represent Urmston and the rural areas of Trafford.

== Demography ==


At the 2001 UK census, the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford had a total population of 210,145.
Of the 89,313 households in the borough, 36.5% were married couples living together, 31.6% were one-person households, 7.8% were co-habiting couples and 9.7% were lone parents, following a similar trend to the rest of England.

The population density was and for every 100 females, there were 94.6 males. Of those aged 16–74 in Trafford, 24.7% had no academic qualifications, significantly lower than the 28.9% in all of England. 8.2% of Trafford&#x27;s residents were born outside the United Kingdom, lower than the English average of 9.2%. The largest minority group was Asian, at 4.0% of the population.

In 1841, 12% of Trafford&#x27;s population was middle class compared to 14% in England and Wales; this increased to 21% in 1931 (15% nationally) and 55% in 2001 (48% nationally). From 1841 to 1951, the working class population of Trafford and across the country was in decline, falling steadily from 43% to 18% (36% to 29% nationally). It has since increased slightly, up to 27% (26% nationwide). The rest of the population was made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers. In the 2008–2009 financial year, the crime rates in Trafford for violence against a person and sexual offences were below the national averages. However, the rate of robberies and burglaries were above the national average.

=== Population change ===
The table below details the population change since 1801. Although Trafford was formed as a Metropolitan Borough in 1974, figures have been generated by combining data from the towns, villages, and civil parishes that would later be constituent parts of Trafford. The greatest percentage change in the population occurred between 1851 and 1871, and was a result of the construction of the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway in 1849. The decrease in Trafford&#x27;s population between 1971 and 2001 mirrors the trend for Greater Manchester, although on a smaller scale; this has been accounted for by the decline of Greater Manchester&#x27;s industries, particularly those in Manchester and Salford but including those in Trafford, and residents leaving to seek new jobs.
== Economy ==

Historically, the economy of the Trafford dominated by agriculture. This continued to some extent even during the Industrial Revolution, as the textile industry in Trafford did not develop as quickly or to the same extent as it did in the rest of Greater Manchester. There are only two known 18th-century mill sites in Trafford, compared with 69 known in Tameside and 51 in Manchester. After reaching a high of 43% in 1812, employment in the textile industry in Trafford declined to 12% according to the 1851 census. The textile industry in Trafford could not compete with that in places such as Manchester, Oldham, and Ashton-under-Lyne, partly because of a reluctance to invest in industry on the part of the two main land owners in the area: the Stamfords and the de Traffords.

Trafford Park was founded in 1897, and at its peak in 1945 employed 75,000 people. As well as being the world&#x27;s first planned industrial estate, it is Europe&#x27;s largest business park. More than 1,400 companies are within the park, employing between 40,000 and 50,000 people. The Trafford Centre, which opened on 10 September 1998, is North West England&#x27;s largest indoor shopping complex. The centre has over 30 million visitors annually, and contains 235 stores, 55 restaurants, and the largest Odeon cinema in the UK.
Trafford is a prosperous area, with an average weekly income of £394, and apart from Manchester it is the only borough in Greater Manchester to be above the national average for weekly income and is on average the highest in the county. Media, advertising and public relations have been identified as growth industries in Greater Manchester and are concentrated in Manchester and Trafford. Average house prices in Trafford are the highest out of all the metropolitan boroughs in Greater Manchester, 45% higher than the average for the county.

At the 2001 UK census, Trafford had 151,445 residents aged 16 to 74. 2.5% of these people were students with jobs, 5.7% looking after home or family, 5.4% permanently sick or disabled and 2.8% economically inactive for other reasons. Trafford has a low rate of unemployment (2.7%) compared with Greater Manchester (3.6%) and England as a whole (3.3%). Trafford has the lowest number of unemployment benefit claimants compared to all the other boroughs in Greater Manchester (3.7%).

In 2001, of 99,146 residents of Trafford in employment, the industry of employment was 17.1% property and business services, 16.5% retail and wholesale, 12.3% manufacturing, 11.9% health and social work, 8.2% education, 8.0% transport and communications, 5.9% construction, 5.5% finance, 4.5% public administration and defence, 4.0% hotels and restaurants, 0.8% energy and water supply, 0.6% agriculture, and 4.6% other. This was roughly in line with national figures, except for the proportion of jobs in agriculture which is less than half the national average, reflecting Trafford&#x27;s suburban nature and its proximity to the centre of Manchester.

A study commissioned by Experian rated Trafford as the strongest and most resilient borough in North West England to dealing with sudden changes in the economy. Trafford&#x27;s low reliance on vulnerable businesses in the current recession and its high proportion of multinational companies were two factors which give the borough its high ranking.

Excavation on the site over a period of 18 years has shown Timperley to be inhabited since the Bronze Age. A grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund has been made to develop the site into a community project.

Trafford has two medieval castles. Dunham Castle is an early medieval castle in Dunham Massey. It belonged to Hamon de Massey, and was probably still standing in the early 14th century. The bailey was landscaped into the grounds of Dunham Massey Hall and its moat turned into an ornamental pond. Watch Hill Castle is an early medieval motte-and-bailey castle on the border of Dunham Massey and Bowdon. It is listed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The motte and surrounding ditch still survives, although it had fallen out of use by the 13th century.

Trafford is the home of several major sports teams, including Manchester United Football Club and Lancashire County Cricket Club (LCCC). Manchester United began as Newton Heath L&amp;YR F.C. in 1878. The team plays at Old Trafford football ground, which is sometimes used as a stadium for major football matches like the 2003 UEFA Champions League final. Manchester United have won the FA Cup 13 times and been the Premier League champions 13 times (since the league was formed 31 seasons ago) and were Football League champions seven times in the years prior to that.

They were one of the founder members of the Elite Ice Hockey League. In 2008–09 they finished sixth in the Elite Ice Hockey League. The Trafford Metros were the Phoenix&#x27;s junior side and are also based at the Altrincham Ice Dome. The Phoenix were replaced by a new team bearing the Manchester Storm name, who took a spot in the Elite Ice Hockey League for the 2015–2016 season

<text>A funitel is a type of cableway, generally used to transport skiers, although at least one is used to transport finished cars between different areas of a factory. It differs from a standard gondola lift through the use of two arms attached to two parallel overhead cables, providing more stability in high winds. The name &quot;funitel&quot; is a portmanteau of the French words &quot;funiculaire&quot; and &quot;telepherique&quot;. 

When used to transport skiers, funitels are a fast way to get to a higher altitude. Skis or snowboards have to be taken off and held during the trip. Depending on the configuration, cabins may or may not contain seats. Without seats, funitels can sometimes be uncomfortable for long trips, in the same way other large cable cars can be. Funitels combine a short time between successive cabins with a capacity of around 20 to 30 people per cabin.

==Overview==
A funitel installation employs two cables (or a single cable arranged in two loops) strung between two terminals and supported by intermediate towers. During transit from terminal to terminal each of a series of detachable passenger cabins is suspended from the two cables which move in parallel at exactly the same rate. The technology was developed from the Double Monocable Creissels (DMC) lift, which featured two so-called monocables (supplying both support and propulsion) moving in parallel and spaced about one meter apart. This technology was developed by the French engineering company Denis Creissels SA and was manufactured by Poma in the 1980s. In the 1990s the first funitels were built, differing from earlier DMC lifts by having the two cables spaced far enough apart for the cabin to be hung between the cables, instead of underneath, thus eliminating the need for a long hanger arm which makes the carrier assembly susceptible to swinging in strong winds. The two cables in these early funitel installations have separate tensioning systems and separate, electrically synchronized motors, one for each cable. Later the double-loop monocable (DLM) was developed, featuring a single cable looped around twice, as the diagram below shows. DLM ensures that the cable sections from which a cabin is suspended move at the same speed without motor synchronization.

The first funitel was constructed in Val-Thorens, 1990, by Denis Creissels SA and Enterprises Reel and Städeli-Lift. The first funitel-style lift constructed outside Europe was near Mammoth Mountain, California at June Mountain ski area, built by Yan Lift in 1988. Jan Kunczynski, the owner of Yan, actually claimed to have invented the funitel lift with reference to US Patent 4,848,241. The Yan &quot;QMC&quot; differed, however, from other funitels in having a quad-monocable design with vertically aligned drive sheaves. The QMC suffered from various design flaws including the famously unsafe Yan cable grips and was shut down by California safety inspectors in 1996 and dismantled over the course of the next few years.
Funitel passenger cabins are connected to the overhead cable sections with four spring-loaded grips — two for each cable section. As with other detachable-carrier lifts the cabins are decelerated and detached from the cables at the terminal for boarding, then accelerated and reattached for transit to the other terminal.
===Reversible funitel===
In 1985 Poma produced a reversible funitel in Megève, France. This system was originally referred to as a DMC lift, although it uses the configuration which would later become known as DLM. Unlike a modern funitel, the cable on this system does not move uninterruptedly. Instead, the system operates in a similar manner to an aerial tramway, with two large cabins shuttling back-and-forth. These cabins do not detach from the cable in normal operation. A similar system was built in 1993, in Montmorency Falls Park, Canada, by the French and Canadian subsidiaries of Doppelmayr.

In 2002, Poma installed a reversible funitel in Val Thorens, France. Instead of two large cabins, this system features two groups of three smaller cabins shuttling back-and-forth. A similar system was built by Doppelmayr in 2004, in Alpe d&#x27;Huez, France. Another similar system in Val Thorens was built by the Swiss manufacturer, Bartholet, in 2011.

<text>Stockport is a town in Greater Manchester, England, south-east of Manchester, south-west of Ashton-under-Lyne and north of Macclesfield. The Rivers Goyt and Tame merge to create the River Mersey here. It is the main settlement of the wider Metropolitan Borough of Stockport. At the 2021 census, the built up area as defined by the Office for National Statistics had a population of 117,935, and the metropolitan borough had a population of 294,773.

Most of the town is within the boundaries of the historic county of Cheshire, with the area north of the Mersey in the historic county of Lancashire. Stockport in the 16th century was a small town entirely on the south bank of the Mersey, known for the cultivation of hemp and manufacture of rope. In the 18th century, it had one of the first mechanised silk factories in the British Isles. Stockport&#x27;s predominant industries of the 19th century were the cotton and allied industries. It was also at the centre of the country&#x27;s hatting industry, which by 1884 was exporting more than six million hats a year; the last hat works in Stockport closed in 1997. The town&#x27;s football club, Stockport County, is nicknamed The Hatters.

Dominating the western approaches to the town is Stockport Viaduct. Built in 1840, its 27 brick arches carry the mainline railway passing through the town over the River Mersey.

==History==
===Toponymy===
Stockport was recorded as &quot;Stokeport&quot; in 1170. The currently accepted etymology is Old English &quot;port&quot;, a market place, with &quot;stoc&quot;, a hamlet (but more accurately a minor settlement within an estate); hence, a market place at a hamlet. Older derivations include &quot;stock&quot;, a stockaded place or castle, with &quot;port&quot;, a wood, hence a castle in a wood. The castle probably refers to Stockport Castle, a 12th-century motte-and-bailey first mentioned in 1173.

Other derivations are based on early variants such as Stopford and Stockford. There is evidence that a ford across the Mersey existed at the foot of Bridge Street Brow. Stopford retains a use in the adjectival form, Stopfordian, for Stockport-related items, and pupils of Stockport Grammar School style themselves Stopfordians. Stopfordian is used as the general term, or demonym used for people from Stockport, much as someone from London would be a Londoner.

Stockport has never been a sea or river port as the Mersey is not navigable here; in the centre of Stockport the river has been culverted and the main shopping street, Merseyway, built above it.

===Early history===
The earliest evidence of human occupation in the wider area are microliths from the hunter-gatherers of the Mesolithic period (the Middle Stone Age, about 8000–3500 BC) and weapons and stone tools from the Neolithic period (the New Stone Age, 3500–2000 BC). Early Bronze Age (2000–1200 BC) remains include stone hammers, flint knives, palstaves (bronze axe heads), and funerary urns; all finds were chance discoveries, not the results of systematic searches of a known site. There is a gap in the age of finds between about 1200 BC and the start of the Roman period in about 70 AD, which may indicate depopulation, possibly due to a poorer climate.

Despite a strong local tradition, there is little evidence of a Roman military station at Stockport. It is assumed that roads from Cheadle to Ardotalia (Melandra) and Manchester to Buxton crossed close to the town centre. The preferred site is at a ford over the Mersey, known to be paved in the 18th century, but it has never been proved that this or any roads in the area are Roman. Hegginbotham reported (in 1892) the discovery of Roman mosaics at Castle Hill (around Stockport market) in the late 18th century, during the construction of a mill, but noted it was &quot;founded on tradition only&quot;; substantial stonework has never been dated by modern methods. However, Roman coins and pottery were probably found there during the 18th century. A cache of coins dating from 375 to 378 AD may have come from the banks of the Mersey at Daw Bank; these were possibly buried for safekeeping at the side of a road.

Six coins from the reigns of the Anglo-Saxon English Kings Edmund (reigned 939–946) and Eadred (reigned 946–955) were found during ploughing at Reddish Green in 1789. There are contrasting views about the significance of this; Arrowsmith takes this as evidence for the existence of a settlement at that time, but Morris states the find could be &quot;an isolated incident&quot;. The small cache is the only Anglo-Saxon find in the area. However, the etymology &quot;Stoc-port&quot; suggests inhabitation during this period.

===Medieval and early modern period===

No part of Stockport appears in the Domesday Book of 1086. The area north of the Mersey was part of the hundred of Salford, which was poorly surveyed. The area south of the Mersey was part of the Hamestan hundred. Cheadle, Bramhall, Bredbury, and Romiley are mentioned, but these all lay just outside the town limits. The survey includes valuations of the Salford hundred as a whole and Cheadle for the times of Edward the Confessor, just before the Norman invasion of 1066, and the time of the survey. The reduction in value is taken as evidence of destruction by William the Conqueror&#x27;s men in the campaigns generally known as the Harrying of the North. The omission of Stockport was once taken as evidence that destruction was so complete that a survey was not needed.

Arrowsmith argues from the etymology that Stockport may have still been a market place associated with a larger estate, and so would not be surveyed separately. The Anglo-Saxon landholders in the area were dispossessed and the land divided amongst the new Norman rulers. The first borough charter was granted in about 1220 and was the only basis for local government for six hundred years. 

A castle held by Geoffrey de Costentin is recorded as a rebel stronghold against Henry II in 1173–1174 when his sons revolted. There is an incorrect local tradition that Geoffrey was the king&#x27;s son, Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany, who was one of the rebels. Dent gives the size of the castle as about , and suggests it was similar in pattern to those at Pontefract and Launceston.

A branch of the Arden family (to which Shakespeare is related on his mother&#x27;s side) were prominent in Stockport in 1500s at Underbank Hall, and Arden Hall (also known as Harden or Hawarden).

The castle was probably ruinous by the middle of the 16th century, and in 1642 it was agreed to demolish it. Castle Hill, possibly the motte, was levelled in 1775 to make space for Warren&#x27;s mill, see below. Nearby walls, once thought to be either part of the castle or of the town walls, are now thought to be revetments to protect the cliff face from erosion.

The regicide John Bradshaw (1602–1659) was born at Wibersley, in the parish of Stockport, baptised in the parish church and attended Stockport Free School. A lawyer, he was appointed lord president of the high court of justice for the trial of King Charles I in 1649. Although he was dead by the time of the Restoration in 1660, his body was brought up from Westminster Abbey and hanged in its coffin at Tyburn.
Stockport bridge has been documented as existing since at least 1282. During the English Civil War the town was supportive of Parliament and was garrisoned by local militias of around 3,000 men commanded by Majors Mainwaring and Duckenfield. Prince Rupert advanced on the town on 25 May 1644, with 8–10,000 men and 50 guns, with a brief skirmish at the site of the bridge, in which Colonel Washington&#x27;s Dragoons led the Royalist attack. Rupert continued his march via Manchester and Bolton to meet defeat at Marston Moor near York.
Stockport bridge was pulled down in 1745 and trenches were additionally dug in the fords to try to stop the Jacobite army of Charles Edward Stuart as they marched through the town on the way to Derby. The vanguard was shot at by the town guard and a horse was killed. The army also passed through Stockport on their retreat back from Derby to Scotland.

One of the legends of the town is that of Cheshire farmer, Jonathan Thatcher, who, in a 1784 demonstration against taxation, avoided William Pitt the Younger&#x27;s saddle tax on horses by riding to market at Stockport on an ox. The incident is also celebrated in &#x27;The Glass Umbrella&#x27; in St Petersgate Gardens, one of the works on Stockport&#x27;s Arts Trail.

===Industrialisation===

Hatmaking was established in north Cheshire and south-east Lancashire by the 16th century. From the 17th century Stockport became a centre for the hatting industry and later the silk industry. Stockport expanded rapidly during the Industrial Revolution, helped particularly by the growth of the cotton manufacturing industries. However, economic growth took its toll, and 19th century philosopher Friedrich Engels wrote in 1844 that Stockport was &quot;renowned as one of the duskiest, smokiest holes&quot; in the whole of the industrial area.

Stockport was one of the prototype textile towns. In the early 18th century, England was not capable of producing silk of sufficient quality to be used as the warp in woven fabrics. Suitable thread had to be imported from Italy, where it was spun on water-powered machinery. In about 1717 John Lombe travelled to Italy and copied the design of the machinery. On his return he obtained a patent on the design, and went into production in Derby. When Lombe tried to renew his patent in 1732, silk spinners from towns including Manchester, Macclesfield, Leek, and Stockport successfully petitioned parliament to not renew the patent. Lombe was paid off, and in 1732 Stockport&#x27;s first silk mill (the first water-powered textile mill in the north-west of England) was opened on a bend in the Mersey. Further mills were opened on local brooks.

Silk weaving expanded until in 1769 two thousand people were employed in the industry. By 1772 the boom had turned to bust, possibly due to cheaper foreign imports; by the late 1770s trade had recovered. The cycle of boom and bust would continue throughout the textile era.

The combination of a good water power site (described by Rodgers as &quot;by far the finest of any site within the lowland&quot; [of the Manchester region]) and a workforce used to textile factory work meant Stockport was well placed to take advantage of the phenomenal expansion in cotton processing in the late 18th century. Warren&#x27;s mill in the market place was the first. Power came from an undershot water wheel in a deep pit, fed by a tunnel from the River Goyt. The positioning on high ground, unusual for a water-powered mill, contributed to an early demise, but the concept of moving water around in tunnels proved successful, and several tunnels were driven under the town from the Goyt to power mills. In 1796, James Harrisson drove a wide cut from the Tame which fed several mills in the Park, Portwood. Other water-powered mills were built on the Mersey.

The town was connected to the national canal network by the of the Stockport branch of the Ashton Canal opened in 1797 which continued in use until the 1930s. Much of it is now filled in, but there is an active campaign to re-open it for leisure uses.

In the early 19th century, the number of hatters in the area began to increase, and a reputation for high quality work was created. The London firm of Miller Christy bought out a local firm in 1826, a move described by Arrowsmith as a &quot;watershed&quot;. By the latter part of the century hatting had changed from a manual to a mechanised process, and was one of Stockport&#x27;s primary employers; the area, with nearby Denton, was the leading national centre. Support industries, such as blockmaking, trimmings, and leatherware, became established. Stockport Armoury was completed in 1862.

World War I cut off overseas markets, which established local industries and eroded Stockport&#x27;s eminence. Even so, in 1932 more than 3,000 people worked in the hatting industry, making it the third biggest employer after textiles and engineering. The depression of the 1930s and changes in fashion greatly reduced the demand for hats, and the demand that existed was met by cheaper wool products made elsewhere, for example the Luton area.

In 1966, the largest of the region&#x27;s remaining felt hat manufacturers, Battersby &amp; Co, T &amp; W Lees, J. Moores &amp; Sons, and Joseph Wilson &amp; Sons, merged with Christy &amp; Co to form Associated British Hat Manufacturers, leaving Christy&#x27;s and Wilson&#x27;s (at Denton) as the last two factories in production. The Wilson&#x27;s factory closed in 1980, followed by the Christy&#x27;s factory in 1997, bringing to an end over 400 years of hatting in the area. The industry is commemorated by the UK&#x27;s only dedicated hatting museum, Hat Works.

====Recent history====

Since the start of the 20th century Stockport has moved away from being a town dependent on cotton and its allied industries to one with a varied base. It makes the most of its varied heritage attractions, including a national museum of hatting, a unique system of World War II air raid tunnel shelters in the town centre, and a late medieval merchants&#x27; house on the 700-year-old Market Place. In 1967, the Stockport air disaster occurred, when a British Midland Airways C-4 Argonaut aeroplane crashed in the Hopes Carr area of the town, resulting in 72 deaths among the passengers and crew.

On 23 November 1981, an F1/T2 tornado formed over Cheadle Hulme. It subsequently passed over Stockport town centre.

In 2011, Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council embarked on an ambitious regeneration scheme, known as Future Stockport. The plan is to bring more than 3,000 residents into the centre of the town, and revitalise its residential property and retail markets in a similar fashion to the nearby city of Manchester. Many ex-industrial areas around the town&#x27;s core will be brought back into productive use as mixed-use residential and commercial developments. Property development company FreshStart Living has been involved in redeveloping a former mill building in the town centre, St Thomas Place. The company plan to transform the mill into 51 residential apartments as part of the regeneration of Stockport.

==Governance==
There is one main tier of local government covering Stockport, at metropolitan borough level: Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council, which meets at Stockport Town Hall on Wellington Road South and has its main offices in the adjoining Stopford House and Fred Perry House. The council is a member of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, led by the directly elected Mayor of Greater Manchester.

===Administrative history===
Stockport was an ancient parish in the Macclesfield Hundred of Cheshire. The parish was large, being sub-divided into fourteen townships: Bramhall, Bredbury, Brinnington, Disley, Dukinfield, Hyde, Marple, Norbury, Offerton, Romiley, Stockport Etchells, Torkington, Werneth, and a Stockport township covering the central part of the parish including the town itself. The townships were all made separate civil parishes in 1866.

The Stockport township was an ancient borough, having been made a borough during the reign of Henry III (reigned 1216–1272). A Stockport parliamentary borough (constituency) was created in 1832, covering the old borough of Stockport, part of the township of Brinnington, the hamlets of Brinksway and Edgeley from the parish of Cheadle, and part of the township of Heaton Norris, the latter being on the north side of the River Mersey and forming part of the ancient parish of Manchester in Lancashire.

Stockport was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country. As part of that reform, the borough boundaries were enlarged to match the recently created constituency. The borough of Stockport therefore straddled Cheshire and Lancashire from 1836 onwards.

Under the terms of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, Stockport Poor Law Union was established on 3 February 1837 and was responsible for an area covering 16 parishes or townships (mostly from the old parish of Stockport) with a total population of 68,906. Stockport Union built a workhouse at Shaw Heath in 1841.

When elected county councils were established in 1889, Stockport was considered large enough to provide its own county-level services, and so it was made a county borough, independent from both Cheshire County Council and Lancashire County Council. The borough boundaries were enlarged several times, notably absorbing the urban districts of Reddish in 1901 and Heaton Norris in 1913. It continued to straddle the geographical counties of Cheshire and Lancashire until 1974, although it was placed entirely in Lancashire for judicial purposes in 1956.

In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the old County Borough of Stockport was amalgamated with neighbouring districts to form the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport in the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. In 1986, Greater Manchester County Council was abolished and Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council assumed its functions, with some services being provided by joint committees.

In 2011, Stockport bid for city status as part of the 2012 Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee celebrations but was unsuccessful.

===Parliamentary representation===
There are three parliamentary constituencies in the Stockport Metropolitan Borough: Stockport, Cheadle and Hazel Grove. Stockport has been represented by the Labour MP Navendu Mishra since 2019. Tom Morrison has been the Liberal Democrat MP for Cheadle since 2024 and Lisa Smart has been the Lib Dem MP for Hazel Grove since 2024.

==Geography==
At (53.408°, −2.149°) Stockport is on elevated ground, south-east of Manchester city centre, at the confluence of the rivers Goyt and Tame, creating the River Mersey. It shares a common boundary with the City of Manchester.

Stockport stands on Permian sandstones and red Triassic sandstones and mudstones, mantled by thick deposits of till and pockets of sand and gravel deposited by glaciers at the end of the Last Glacial Period, some 15,000 years ago. To the extreme east is the Red Rock fault, and the older rocks from the Upper Carboniferous period surface. An outcrop of coal measures extends southwards through Tameside and into Hazel Grove. The Pennines lie to the east of the town, consisting of the upland moors and Millstone Grit outcrops of sandstones and shales in the Dark Peak area of the Peak District.

==Demography==
At the 2001 UK census, Stockport had a population of 136,082. The 2001 population density was 11,937 per mi2 (4,613 per km2), with a 100 to 94.0 female-to-male ratio. Of those over 16 years old, 32% were single (never married) and 50.2% married. Stockport&#x27;s 58,687 households included 33.1% one-person, 33.7% married couples living together, 9.7% were co-habiting couples, and 10.4% single parents with their children, these figures were similar to those of Stockport Metropolitan Borough and England. Of those aged 16–74, 29.2% had no academic qualifications, significantly higher than that of 25.7% in all of Stockport Metropolitan Borough but similar to the whole of England average at 28.9%.

Although suburbs such as Woodford, Bramhall and Cheadle Hulme are relatively wealthy and 45% of the borough is green space, districts such as Edgeley, Adswood, Shaw Heath and Brinnington are among the poorer areas. In the north-west of the borough are the areas of Heaton Moor and Heaton Mersey, which together with Heaton Chapel and Heaton Norris comprise the so-called &quot;Four Heatons&quot;.

===Population change===
==Economy==

Stockport&#x27;s principal commercial district is the town centre, with branches of most high-street stores to be found in the Merseyway Shopping Centre or The Peel Centre. Redrock Stockport has a twelve-screen cinema, bars and several restaurants. Stockport is from Manchester, making it convenient for commuters and shoppers. In 2008, the council&#x27;s £500 million plans to redevelop the town centre were cancelled after construction company Lendlease pulled out of the project, blaming the credit crunch. More recently work has begun with talks of a Metrolink route to Manchester, redevelopment of the old bus station amongst many old buildings becoming luxury apartments. Also many roadworks to deal with the intended growth from the development.
==Landmarks==

Stockport Town Hall, designed by Sir Alfred Brumwell Thomas, has a ballroom described by John Betjeman as &quot;magnificent&quot; which contains the Wurlitzer theatre pipe organ formerly installed in the Paramount and later Odeon Theatre in Manchester. The war memorial and art gallery are on Greek Street, opposite the town hall. Underbank Hall is a Grade II* listed late 16th-century timber-framed building which was the townhouse of the Arderne family from Bredbury who occupied it until 1823. Since 1824, it has been used as a bank and its main banking hall lies behind the 16th-century structure and dates from 1915.

Stockport Viaduct is high, and carries four railway tracks over the River Mersey on the line to Manchester Piccadilly. The viaduct built of 11,000,000 bricks, a major feat of Victorian engineering, was completed in 21 months at a cost of £70,000. The structure is Grade II* listed.

Beside the M60 motorway is the Stockport Pyramid, a distinctive structure designed by Christopher Denny from Michael Hyde and Associates. It has a steel frame covered with mostly blue glass and clear glass paneling at the apex and was intended to be the signature building for a much larger development planned in 1987. Construction began in the early 1990s and it was completed in 1992 but an economic downturn caused the project to be abandoned as the developers went into administration. The building lay empty until 1995 when The Co-operative Bank repossessed it and opened it as a call centre.

Vernon Park, to the east towards Bredbury, was opened on 20 September 1858 on the anniversary of the Battle of the Alma in the Crimean War. It was named after Lord Vernon who presented the land to the town.

St Elisabeth&#x27;s Church, Reddish, and the model village are parts of a mill community designed in the main by Alfred Waterhouse for workers of Houldsworth Mill.

Chapels and churches were built in those townships and the parish today covers a much smaller area. Parts of the church, situated by the market place, date to the early 14th century. The church is Grade I listed. In the town are the Grade II listed Roman Catholic St Joseph&#x27;s Church and Our Lady and the Apostles Church.

===Football===

Stockport County F.C. play in the EFL League One. The club was formed in 1883 as Heaton Norris Rovers, changing its name to Stockport County in 1890 to reflect the town&#x27;s status as a county borough. It joined the English Football League in 1900. Its most successful season was the 1996–97 season, when it reached the Football League Cup semi-finals and won promotion to Division One.

The town is also home to Non-League clubs, Stockport Georgians A.F.C., Cheadle Heath Nomads F.C., Stockport Town F.C. and Cheadle Town F.C. who are based within the Borough of Stockport and play in the North West Counties Football League.

When the rugby football schism occurred in 1895, Stockport RFC, founded in 1895, became a founder member of the Northern Rugby Football Union (now Rugby Football League). Stockport played for eight seasons from the 1895–96 season to the end of 1902–1903 season, the latter two seasons played at Edgeley Park, the club finished 17th of 22 in the initial combined league, then 5th, 11th, 11th, 9th, 12th, 6th, in the 14-club Lancashire Senior Competition, and then 18th of 18 in Division 2 of the recombined league, after which it withdrew from the Northern Rugby Football Union.

In the early 1980s, the Stockport Amateur Rugby League club played in the BARLA North West Counties League. They played at Lancashire Hill although changed at The Three Crowns. The founder was a local postman, Graham Tonge. They used the same colours as the original club – claret and black.

<doc id="300828" wikidata="Q1546645" url="?curid=300828" title="Metropolitan Borough of Sefton">
<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Sefton is a metropolitan borough of Merseyside, England. It was formed on 1 April 1974, by the amalgamation of the county boroughs of Bootle and Southport, the municipal borough of Crosby, the urban districts of Formby and Litherland, and part of West Lancashire Rural District. It consists of a coastal strip of land on the Irish Sea which extends from Southport in the north to Bootle in the south, and an inland part to Maghull in the south-east, bounded by the city of Liverpool to the south, the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley to the south-east, and West Lancashire to the east.

It is named after Sefton, near Maghull. When the borough was created, a name was sought that would not unduly identify the borough with any of its constituent parts, particularly the former county boroughs of Bootle and Southport. The area had strong links with both the Earl of Sefton and the Earl of Derby, resident of Knowsley Hall, and the adjacent borough was subsequently named Knowsley. A Sefton Rural District covering some of the villages in the district existed from 1894 to 1932.

==Governance==
===Liverpool City Region Combined Authority===
The Metropolitan Borough of Sefton is one of the six constituent local government districts of the Liverpool City Region. Since 1 April 2014, some of the borough&#x27;s responsibilities have been pooled with neighbouring authorities within the metropolitan area and subsumed into the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority.

The combined authority has effectively become the top-tier administrative body for the local governance of the city region and the leader of Sefton Council, along with the five other leaders from neighbouring local government districts, take strategic decisions over economic development, transport, employment and skills, tourism, culture, housing and physical infrastructure.

In July 2015, negotiations took place between the UK national government and the combined authority over a possible devolution deal to confer greater powers on the region, including whether to introduce an elected &#x27;Metro Mayor&#x27; to oversee the entire metropolitan area.

===Historic controversy===

The existence of Sefton has been an ongoing local controversy, especially in Southport, where local Members of Parliament (MPs) and councillors have campaigned for separation from Bootle and the possible inclusion of the town as a district in the non-metropolitan county of Lancashire. It was highlighted after the 2012 local government election that different regions in Sefton had vastly different socio-economic backgrounds and needs. There are high levels of poverty around the Bootle area and central Southport.

===Sefton Council composition===
The council has 66 councillors, three for each of the borough&#x27;s 22 wards:

, the council is composed of 41 Labour councillors, 12 for The Liberal Democrat and Progressive Alliance Group, six Conservatives, and five for The Independents Group. There are two vacancies.

==Economy==

The borough has a strong income from tourism, most of whom visit the Aintree Grand National, the most valuable horse race in Europe, Anthony Gormley&#x27;s &quot;Another Place&quot; at Crosby Beach and Southport. Birkdale is also home to the Royal Birkdale Golf Club which has played host to the Open Championship, Ryder Cup, Walker Cup and Curtis Cup.

<doc id="300829" wikidata="Q1812315" url="?curid=300829" title="British Chess Championship">
<text>The British Chess Championships are organised by the English Chess Federation. The main tournament incorporates the British Championship, the English Chess Championships and the British Women&#x27;s Chess Championship so it is possible, although it has never happened, for one player to win all three titles in the same competition. The English Women&#x27;s Chess Championship was also incorporated into this event but did not take place in 2015 and was held as a separate competition in 2016. Since 1923 there have been sections for juniors, and since 1982 there has been an over-sixty championship. The championship venue usually changes every year and has been held in different locations in England, Scotland, Wales and once on the Isle of Man.

The championship was originally open to citizens of any Commonwealth country and has previously been won by Mir Sultan Khan (India) and Abe Yanofsky (Canada). After the Indian R. B. Ramesh finished first in 2002 and several other Indians took top prizes at the same event, many top Britons declined to compete in the 2003 championship. Following the victory of Indian Abhijit Kunte in 2003 and criticism that the British Championship was not serving the interests of British players, it was announced that starting in 2004 only British and Irish players would be eligible to take part. Players excluded by these rules are however welcome to participate in the Commonwealth Chess Championship.

==BCA Congress (1857–1861)==
These were the first large tournaments organised by the British Chess Association, international players were allowed to participate.

==London international tournaments (1862–1883)==
In July 1862, Adolf Anderssen won the first international tournament organized by the British Chess Association (BCF Congress), held in London. Second place went to Louis Paulsen, followed by John Owen. This was the first round-robin tournament.
In August 1872, Wilhelm Steinitz won the second British Chess Federation international tourney, held in London. Second place went to Joseph Henry Blackburne. The great London 1883 chess tournament was won convincingly by Johannes Zukertort (22 points ouf of 26) ahead of Steinitz (19/26).

==BCA Congress (1885–1899)==
In 1884, a new British Chess Association was inaugurated. In July 1885, Isidor Gunsberg won the first British Chess Association championship in London. In August 1886, Blackburne and Amos Burn tied for first in the second British Chess Association championship, held in London. Blackburne won the play-off. In December 1887, Burn and Gunsberg tied for first in the third British Chess Association Congress in London.

==BCA Challenge Cup (1866–1872) ==
The first British Championship was organized by the British Chess Association as an event at the 1866 London Congress.
A rule awarded the B.C.A. Challenge Cup permanently to a player who won two consecutive titles.
John Wisker accomplished this in 1872 by defeating Cecil De Vere in a play-off.
The British Championship was then discontinued until 1904.

==British Amateur Championship (1886–1902) ==

Ten amateur championships were held between 1886 and 1902, but they did not include the strongest players and were unrepresentative, especially in the earlier years.

==British Championship (1904–present)==
The current championship series was begun by the British Chess Federation in 1904.
The championship was not held in war years.
It was also not held in 1919, 1922, 1927, and 1930 as major international events were then being held in England. José Raúl Capablanca won the BCF Victory Congress held in Hastings 1919 and the 1922 London International tournament, Alexander Alekhine won the 16th BCC Major Open at Portsmouth/Southsea 1923, Aron Nimzowitsch and Savielly Tartakower won at London 1927, and Edgard Colle won at Scarborough 1930. In 1939 the championship was also not held as the British team was in Buenos Aires for the 8th Chess Olympiad. In that time, Max Euwe won an international tournament at Bournemouth 1939, played during the BCC. The women&#x27;s championship was held in most of those years.

<doc id="300834" wikidata="Q1454723" url="?curid=300834" title="Acquittal">
<text>In common law jurisdictions, an acquittal means that the criminal prosecution has failed to prove that the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the charge presented. It certifies that the accused is free from the charge of an offense, as far as criminal law is concerned. The finality of an acquittal is dependent on the jurisdiction. In some countries, such as the United States, an acquittal prohibits the retrial of the accused for the same offense, even if new evidence surfaces that further implicates the accused. The effect of an acquittal on criminal proceedings is the same whether it results from a jury verdict or results from the operation of some other rule that discharges the accused. In other countries, like Australia and the UK, the prosecuting authority may appeal an acquittal similar to how a defendant may appeal a conviction — but usually only if new and compelling evidence comes to light or the accused has interfered with or intimidated a juror or witness.

==Scotland==

Scots law has two acquittal verdicts: &quot;not guilty&quot; and &quot;not proven&quot;. However, a verdict of &quot;not proven&quot; does not give rise to the double jeopardy rule.

==England and Wales==

In England and Wales, which share a common legal system, the Criminal Justice Act 2003 creates an exception to the double jeopardy rule, by providing that retrials may be ordered if &quot;new and compelling evidence&quot; comes to light after an acquittal for a serious crime. Also, the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 permits a &quot;tainted acquittal&quot; to be set aside in circumstances where it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that an acquittal has been obtained by violence or threats of violence to a witness or juror/s.

In modern England and Wales, and in all countries that substantially follow English criminal procedure, an acquittal normally results in the immediate liberation of the defendant from custody, assuming no other charges against the defendant remain to be tried. However, until 1774, a defendant acquitted by an English or Welsh court would be remanded to jail until he had paid the jailer for the costs of his confinement. It was known for acquitted persons to die in jail for lack of jailer&#x27;s fees.

==United States==

With one exception, the prosecution in the United States cannot appeal an acquittal because of constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled:

:If the judgment is upon an acquittal, the defendant, indeed, will not seek to have it reversed, and the government cannot. &quot;U.S. v. Sanges&quot;, 144 U.S. 310 (1892). &quot;Ball v. U.S.&quot;, 163 U.S. 662, 671 (1896)

:A verdict of acquittal, although not followed by any judgment, is a bar to a subsequent prosecution for the same offense. &quot;Ball&quot;, supra, at 672.

:Society&#x27;s awareness of the heavy personal strain which a criminal trial represents for the individual defendant is manifested in the willingness to limit the Government to a single criminal proceeding to vindicate its very vital interest in enforcement of criminal laws. &quot;United States v. Jorn&quot;, 400 U.S. 470, 479 (1971)

:Whether the trial is to a jury or, as here, to the bench, subjecting the defendant to postacquittal factfinding proceedings going to guilt or innocence violates the Double Jeopardy Clause. &quot;Smalis v. Pennsylvania&quot;, 476 U.S. 140 (1986)

It was decided in &quot;Fong Foo v. United States&quot;, 369 U.S. 141 (1962) that the prosecution cannot appeal a judgment of acquittal by a jury. In &quot;United States v. Jenkins&quot;, 420 U.S. 358 (1975), this was held applicable to bench trials. In &quot;Arizona v. Rumsey&quot;, 467 U.S. 203 (1984), it was ruled that in a bench trial, when a judge was holding a separate hearing after the jury trial, to decide if the defendant should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment, the judge decided that the circumstances of the case did not permit death to be imposed. On appeal, the judge&#x27;s ruling was found to be erroneous. However, even though the decision to impose a life sentence instead of death was based on the judge&#x27;s incorrect interpretation of the law, the finding of life imprisonment in the original case constituted an acquittal of the death penalty. Thus, death could not be imposed upon a subsequent trial. Even though the acquittal of the death penalty was erroneous in that case, the acquittal must stand.

The only exception to an acquittal being final is if the defendant was never in actual jeopardy. If a defendant bribes a judge and obtains acquittal due to a bench trial, the acquittal is invalid because the defendant was never in jeopardy in the first place. &quot;Harry Aleman v. Judges of the Criminal Division, Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, et al.&quot;, 138 F.3d 302 (7th Cir. 1998).

An acquittal, while conclusive as to the criminal law, does not necessarily bar private civil actions in tort or on some other grounds as a result of the facts alleged in the charge. For example, the City of Los Angeles was held liable in 1994 for the 1991 Rodney King beating despite state acquittals in 1992 of all of its four main LAPD defendants, and in 1997 O. J. Simpson was held civilly liable for wrongful death even after being tried and acquitted in 1995 of murder. An acquittal also does not bar prosecution for the same offenses under a statute of a different jurisdiction. For example, in the United States, someone acquitted of a state murder charge can be retried for the same actions on a federal charge of violating civil rights, and police acquitted of a state charge of felonious assault, as in the Rodney King case, can likewise be tried on federal civil rights charges.

== The effect of acquittals on criminal records ==
An acquittal does not mean the defendant is innocent of the charge presented—only that the prosecutor failed to prove that the defendant was &quot;guilty beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;.

The charge may remain on the defendant&#x27;s criminal record in the United States even after an acquittal, depending on the state regulations. A federal criminal record may include acquittals, case dismissals, and convictions.

In the UK, police forces can reveal whether individuals have been acquitted of criminal charges when issuing information for enhanced record checks, according to a 2018 Supreme Court ruling.

Depending on one&#x27;s location, a background check may highlight not only convictions or plea bargains but also arrests, charges that were dropped or dismissed, and acquittals.

== Acquittal vs &quot;Not Guilty&quot;==
A &quot;not guilty&quot; finding is generally considered an acquittal, but there is a subtle difference between the two. A defendant found &quot;not guilty&quot; is not legally answerable for the criminal charge filed. An acquittal is when a judge or jury finds a defendant &quot;not guilty&quot; of the crime charged.

&quot;Not guilty&quot; also refers to a type of plea in a criminal case. To avoid confusion, the term &quot;acquittal&quot; is often used in place of it to refer to the court judgment.

== Partial acquittal ==
When multiple charges are filed against a defendant, and a judge or jury finds the defendant not guilty of some charges but guilty of others, the defendant is said to have received a &quot;partial acquittal&quot;. The defendant will then be sentenced for the charges that did not result in acquittal.

Editor was succeeded on 12 December 2006, by . After a dispute with the new owners, Donker had to step down on 26 April 2010 and was replaced by Belgian . In 2019, he was succeeded by René Moerland.

On 7 March 2011, the paper changed its format from broadsheet to tabloid. The circulation of in 2014 was 188,500 copies, putting it in 4th place among the national dailies.

In 2015 the NRC Media group was acquired by the Belgian company Mediahuis.

In 2022, when it stopped producing evening editions, the paper shortened its official name to &quot;NRC&quot;, by which it had already been known colloquially.

Between 2006 and 2021 Mediahuis also published &quot;nrc•next&quot;, a morning tabloid aimed at young people.

==Character==

<doc id="300843" wikidata="Q1043730" url="?curid=300843" title="Omphalotus olearius">
<text>Omphalotus olearius, commonly known as the jack-o&#x27;-lantern mushroom, is a poisonous orange gilled mushroom that to an untrained eye appears similar to some chanterelles. It is notable for its bioluminescent properties. It is found in woodland areas in Europe, where it grows on decaying stumps, on buried roots or at the base of hardwood trees. A similar, but phylogenetically distinct species found in eastern North America is &quot;Omphalotus illudens&quot;.

Unlike chanterelles, &quot;Omphalotus olearius&quot; and other &quot;Omphalotus&quot; species contain the toxin illudin S, and are poisonous to humans. While not typically lethal, consuming this mushroom leads to very severe cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea. 

== Description ==
&quot;Omphalotus olearius&quot; is the same shade of orange internally and externally. It does not change color when bruised or sliced, a feature which helps to distinguish it from visibly similar species. Its bioluminescence, a blue-green color, can be observed in fresh specimens in low light conditions once the eye becomes dark-adapted. The whole mushroom does not glow—only the gills do so. This is due to an enzyme called luciferase, acting upon a compound called luciferin, leading to the emission of light much as fireflies do when glowing. Bioluminescence has been shown to aid in the reproduction of fungi by attracting insects to them to spread spores. However, the jack-o&#x27;-lantern mushroom does not use bioluminescence for the purpose of attracting insects, and studies on it have not yet determined the exact purpose of bioluminescence in this species.

Identifiable characteristics of the jack-o&#x27;-lantern mushroom include true, sharp, decurrent, non-forking gills. The smell of these mushrooms is non-distinctive. Cap size can range from 4-12 cm in diameter. The jack-o&#x27;-lantern stem can vary between 1-2 cm (0.4-0.8 in) in thickness and 3.5-9 cm (1.2-3.5 in) in total length from attachment to cap to base of stem.

== Distribution and Habitat ==
&quot;Omphalotus olearius&quot; are an uncommon find and can be seen in the summer and fall seasons (July-October) in regions of southern Europe. This range includes southern France, the Iberian Peninsula, and other Mediterranean countries. This species has also been reported from the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Clusters of jack-o&#x27;-lantern mushrooms can be found in forests that contain primarily deciduous trees. The roots, decaying stumps, and bases of hardwoods are their preferred habitat, particularly on the decaying roots of olive trees.

== Similar species ==
Several species of chanterelles may be confused with the jack-o&#x27;-lantern mushroom. A characteristic that distinguishes chanterelles from the jack-o&#x27;-lantern is the appearance of the gills. Jack-o&#x27;-lanterns have sharp, bendable, paper-like gills; chanterelles, however, have false gills that take the appearance of blunt ridges. Furthermore, if the jack-o&#x27;-lantern&#x27;s stem is peeled, the same shade of orange as the outer flesh, while the chanterelle is paler inside the stem.

Two common bioluminescent species that can be found in North America are the &quot;Omphalotus illudens&quot; and the &quot;Omphalotus olivascens.&quot; &quot;Omphalotus olivascens&quot; is common to southern to central California, while &quot;Omphalotus illudens&quot; is found in eastern North America. Both of these species are poisonous. The similarly poisonous mushroom Tsukiyotake (&quot;Omphalotus japonicus&quot;, formerly known as &quot;Lampteromyces japonicus),&quot; can be found in Japan and eastern Asia and is also bioluminescent and contains the same poison, illudin.

<text>George Wilkins (died 1618) was an English dramatist and pamphleteer best known for his possible collaboration with William Shakespeare on the play &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot;. By profession he was an inn-keeper, but he was also apparently involved in criminal activities.

==Life==
Wilkins was an inn-keeper in Cow-Cross, London, an area that was &quot;notorious as a haunt of whores and thieves&quot;. Most biographical information about him derives from his regular appearance in criminal court records for thievery and acts of violence. Many of the charges against him involved violence against women, including kicking a pregnant woman in the belly, and knocking down and stomping another woman. The latter appears in other records as a known &quot;bawd&quot;, or keeper of prostitutes. These facts have led to the suggestion that his inn functioned as a brothel and that Wilkins was a procurer, or pimp.

Wilkins was associated with the King&#x27;s Men, and their chief playwright William Shakespeare, during the latter&#x27;s last working years as a dramatist. Shakespeare and Wilkins were both witnesses in the case of &quot;Bellott v Mountjoy&quot; in 1612; in his deposition he described himself as a &quot;victualler.&quot;

==Works==
He is first heard of as the author of a pamphlet on the &quot;Three Miseries of Barbary&quot;, which dates from 1606. He then collaborated in 1607 with William Rowley and John Day in &quot;The Travels of the Three English Brothers&quot;, a dramatisation of the real-life adventures of the Sherley brothers.

In the same year Wilkins wrote &quot;The Miseries of Enforced Marriage&quot;. This play is based on the real life story of Walter Calverley, a Yorkshireman whose identity is thinly disguised under the name of &quot;Scarborough.&quot; This man had killed his two children and had attempted to murder his wife. The play avoided a tragic ending, at least in the printed version of 1607, which ends in comedy. The story stopped short before the catastrophe perhaps because of objections raised by Mrs. Calverley&#x27;s family, the Cobhams. Walter Calverley&#x27;s crimes are dealt with in a short play, &quot;A Yorkshire Tragedy&quot;, of uncertain authorship.

==&quot;Pericles&quot;==
A number of studies have attributed to Wilkins a share in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot; (which does not appear in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;First Folio&quot;, but was published only in a textually corrupt quarto). This may have been collaboration, or perhaps Wilkins was the original author of &quot;Pericles&quot; and Shakespeare remodelled it, or vice versa. However it may be, Wilkins published in 1608 a novel entitled &quot;The Painful Adventures of Pericles, Prynce of Tyre&quot;, described as &quot;the true history of Pericles as it was lately presented by ... John Gower&quot; (who serves as narrator in the play). This follows the play very closely. The editors of the 1986 Oxford Edition of Shakespeare make the assumption that Wilkins was the co-author of &quot;Pericles&quot; and draw heavily upon &quot;The Painful Adventures&quot; in their controversial reconstructed text of the play. Wilkins is thought to have contributed most of the first two acts of the play, while Shakespeare wrote the last three.

In his 2022 book &quot;Aemilia Lanyer as Shakespeare’s Co-Author&quot;, Mark Bradbeer suggests that George Wilkins might have been a pseudonym for the poet Emilia Lanier.

<doc id="300854" wikidata="Q583591" url="?curid=300854" title="Mer de Glace">
<text>The Mer de Glace (, ) is a valley glacier located on the northern slopes of the Mont Blanc massif, in the French Alps. It is 7.5 km long and deep but, when all its tributary glaciers are taken into account, it can be regarded as the longest and largest glacier in France, and the second longest in the Alps after the Aletsch Glacier.

==Geography==
The glacier lies above the Chamonix valley. The pressure within the ice is known to reach at least 30 atmospheres. The Mer de Glace can be considered as originating at an elevation of , just north of the , where it is formed by the confluence of the and the . The former is fed by the , whilst the latter is, in turn, fed by the Glacier des Périardes, the vast Glacier du Géant and the broad icefields of the . The Glacier du Tacul supplies much more ice than the Glacier de Leschaux.

However, if the Mer de Glace is considered in its broadest sense (i.e. from source to tongue), it is a compound valley glacier, gaining ice from snowfields that cover the heights directly north of Mont Blanc at an altitude of around 4,000 metres. It flows for a total distance of 12 kilometres, covering an area of 32 square kilometres in the central third of the Mont Blanc massif.

From the Aiguille du Tacul, the Mer de Glace flows north-north-west between on the east and Trélaporte on the west. It descends below Montenvers, at which point it is approximately 0.5 km wide, and descends to approximately . The glacier was once easily visible from Chamonix but has been shrinking backwards, and is now barely visible from below. The surface topography of the Mer de Glace changed very little during the first third of the 20th century, but from 1939 to 2001 the surface of the glacier has lowered an average of 30 cm each year, corresponding to an equivalent loss of 700 million cubic metres of water.
When the tension in the ice increases as the slope increases, the glacier is unable to deform and crevasses appear. These are notably transversal and, when there is intense crevasse activity on the steepest terrain, blocks of seracs appear as the glacier breaks up. Crevasses are of variable depth, depending on their position, and may be as deep as fifty metres. Seracs always form in the same places, namely the steepest sections over which the glacier flows. As crevasses open and seracs tumble downstream, the supply of ice is renewed by the constant flow from upstream. Broad banding patterns, visible on the surface of the Mer de Glace, are known as ogives, or Forbes bands, and result from differences in summer and winter collapse rates of the serac fields. On 24 July 1842, Scottish physicist James David Forbes observed the pattern of light and dark dirt bands on the Mer de Glace from the nearby Aiguille des Grands Charmoz and began to consider whether glaciers flowed in a similar fashion to a sluggish river and with a viscous or plastic manner.
In the 18th and 19th centuries, the glacier descended all the way down to the hamlet of Les Bois, where it was known as Glacier des Bois. At that time the river Arveyron emerged from the glacier under a grotto-like vault () and, through the accounts of early writers and explorers, attracted many more visitors, painters and later photographers, for example J. M. W. Turner&#x27;s &quot;Source of the Arveron in the Valley of Chamouni Savoy&quot;, 1816. The position of its front end fluctuated over the years but its maximum extent was in the mid-19th century.

==Literary and cultural references==
Mary Shelley&#x27;s 1818 novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; references Mer de Glace during Victor Frankenstein&#x27;s hikes into the Mount Blanc massif. Dr. Frankenstein meets his creation twice during mountaineering on the Mer de Glace. This episode inspired the 1991 opera &quot;Mer de glace&quot; by Australian composer Richard Meale to a libretto by his compatriot David Malouf.

<text>Sir Robert Shirley (or Sherley; c. 1581 – 13 July 1628) was an English traveller and adventurer, younger brother of Sir Anthony Shirley and Sir Thomas Shirley. He is notable for his help modernising and improving the Persian Safavid army according to the British model, by the request of Shah Abbas the Great. This proved to be highly successful, as from then on the Safavids proved to be an equal force to their archrival, the Ottoman Empire.

==Family==
Robert Shirley was the third son of Sir Thomas Shirley of Wiston, Sussex, and Anne Kempe, the daughter of Sir Thomas Kempe (d. 7 March 1591) of Olantigh in Wye, Kent. He had two elder brothers, Sir Thomas Shirley and Sir Anthony Shirley, and six sisters who survived infancy.

==Career==
Shirley travelled to Persia in 1598, accompanying his brother, Anthony, who had been sent to Safavid Persia from 1 December 1599 to May 1600, with 5000 horses to train the Persian army according to the rules and customs of the English militia and to reform and retrain the Persian artillery. When Anthony Shirley left Persia, Robert remained in Persia with fourteen other Englishmen. There, in February 1607, he married Sampsonia, a Christian Circassian lady of the Circassian nobility of Safavid Persia. After being baptized by the Carmelites, she adopted the Teresia in addition to her own name. She became known in the west by the name &quot;Lady Teresia Sampsonia Shirley&quot;.

In 1608 Shah Abbas sent Robert on a diplomatic mission to James I of England and to other European princes for the purpose of uniting them in a confederacy against the Ottoman Empire. From his very first mission in Persia, the modernisation of the army by Robert and his men proved to be highly successful; the Safavids scored their first crushing victory over the Ottomans in the Ottoman–Safavid War, ending the war on highly favourable terms.
Shirley travelled first to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, where he was received by Sigismund III Vasa. In June of that year, he arrived in Germany, where he received the title of Count Palatine and was appointed to Knight of the Holy Roman Empire by Emperor Rudolph II. Pope Paul V also conferred upon him the title of Count. From Germany, Sir Robert travelled to Florence and then Rome, where he entered the city on Sunday, 27 September 1609, attended by a suite of eighteen persons. He next visited Milan, and then proceeded to Genoa, from whence he embarked to Spain, arriving in Barcelona in December 1609. He sent for his Persian wife, and they remained in Spain, principally at Madrid, until the summer of 1611.
In 1613 Shirley returned to Persia. In 1615 he returned to Europe, and resided at Madrid. In a pleasingly serendipitous meeting Shirley&#x27;s caravan met Thomas Coryate, the eccentric traveller and travel writer (and attendant of Prince Henry&#x27;s court in London), in the Persian desert in 1615.

Shirley&#x27;s third journey to Persia was undertaken in 1627 when he accompanied Sir Dodmore Cotton the first British ambassador to the Kingdom of Persia, but soon after reaching the country he died at Qazvin, in what is today northwest Iran. After being initially buried there, his remains were later moved from Qazvin to Rome in 1658 by his wife Teresia following her retirement to a convent in the same city attached to Santa Maria della Scala. She died there in 1668.

==In art==
There are several double portraits of Shirley and his wife in English collections, including the private collection of R. J. Berkeley and of Petworth House (by van Dyck).

==In literature==
The exploits of the Shirley brothers were dramatised in the 1607 play &quot;The Travels of the Three English Brothers&quot; by John Day, William Rowley and George Wilkins.

In 1609, Andreas Loeaechius (Andrew Leech), a Scot living in Kraków, Poland, wrote a Latin panegyric to Shirley entitled &quot;Encomia Nominis &amp; Neoocij D. Roberti Sherlaeii&quot;. This text was translated in the same year by the English writer Thomas Middleton as &quot;Sir Robert Sherley his Entertainment in Cracovia&quot;.

<text>Sir Thomas Shirley (c. 1564 – c. 1634) was an English soldier, adventurer and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1584 and 1622. His financial difficulties drove him into privateering which culminated in his capture by the Turks and later imprisonment in the Tower of London.

==Family==
Thomas Shirley was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Shirley of Wiston House, Sussex, and Anne Kempe, the daughter of Sir Thomas Kempe (d. 7 March 1591) of Olantigh in Wye, Kent. Sir Anthony Shirley and Sir Robert Shirley were his younger brothers.

==Career==

Shirley matriculated at Hart Hall, Oxford in 1579, but left the university without taking a degree. In 1584 he was elected Member of Parliament for Steyning. He went on military service with his father and brother in the Low Countries in 1585, and later saw some in Ireland. He was knighted at Kilkenny in Ireland by the lord deputy, Sir William Fitz-William, on 26 October 1589. Shirley later came to the court. In the summer of 1591 he made a secret marriage to one of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s maids of honour and when the queen heard of it, she promptly committed him to the Marshalsea Prison. He remained in prison till the spring of 1592. In 1593 he was elected MP for Steyning again. In the same year he saw service with the rank of captain in the Low Countries again.

Shirley was beginning to suffer from hopeless embarrassment because of his father&#x27;s increasing financial difficulties. To secure a livelihood, he decided to fit out a privateering expedition to attack Spanish merchandise. He handed over his company at Flushing to Sir Thomas Vavasour, a relation of his wife, and in the summer of 1598 sailed into the English Channel, and seized four &#x27;hulks&#x27; of Lübeck which were reputed to be carrying Spanish goods. He may have made some of his attacks with the Queen&#x27;s ship &quot;Foresight&quot;, which he commanded in 1599. The costs and returns were high. A ship that Shirley captured while returning from San Domingo laden with sugar, was valued at £4,700. In April 1600, Shirley offered the Earl of Nottingham £600 for his tenth share in two ships which he brought into Plymouth and said he had already paid £2,000 for &#x27;the company&#x27;s thirds&#x27;. In October 1600 Shirley was brought before the Admiralty court for seizing a ship from Hamburg which had a cargo belonging to some Dutch merchants and Lord Cobham had to intervene on his behalf. He was also coming under attack from his creditors for in July 1600 some supporters of Sir Richard Weston broke into his father&#x27;s house at Blackfriars and threatened the Shirleys, father and son, demanding payment. In 1601 his father required the borough seat of Steyning. Shirley was elected MP for both Bramber and Hastings and chose to sit for Hastings. In 1602 he renewed his privateering adventures, and pillaged &#x27;two poor hamlets of two dozen houses in Portugal.&#x27;

At the end of 1602 Shirley equipped two ships for a more ambitious adventure in the Levant where he aimed to strike a blow against the Ottoman Empire of Mehmed III. He was given encouragement by the Duke of Tuscany at Florence, who supported Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor in this respect. However, he made an imprudent descent on the island of Kea on 15 Jan 1603 and was captured by the Turks. He was transferred to Negropont on 20 March, and on 25 July 1603 he was carried a close prisoner to Constantinople. When news of his misfortunes reached England, James I appealed to the government of the sultan to release him. The English ambassador to the Porte, Henry Lello, used every effort on his behalf, and finally he was released on 6 December 1605, after eleven hundred dollars had been paid to his gaolers. He immediately went to Naples, where he was described by Toby Mathew, on 8 August 1606, as living there &#x27;like a gallant.&#x27; At the end of 1606 he returned to England.

Shirley was imprisoned in the Tower of London in September 1607 on a charge of illegal interference with the operations of the Levant Company. It was said that he had &quot;overbusied himself with the traffic of Constantinople, to have brought it to Venice and to the Florentine territories.&quot; In August 1611 he was confined in the king&#x27;s bench as an insolvent debtor. The death of his father next year, and his second marriage greatly increased his difficulties. Wiston, which had fallen into ruins, was sold, but he was elected MP for Steyning in 1614, and 1621.

Shirley is said to have retired subsequently to the Isle of Wight, and to have died there about 1630.

==Marriages and issue==
Shirley married firstly Frances Vavasour, daughter of Henry Vavasour of Copmanthorpe, by whom he had three sons and four daughters. His second son, Henry Shirley, was the dramatist who was murdered in London on 31 October 1627. His only surviving son by his first marriage, Thomas Shirley, was baptised at West Clandon, Surrey, on 30 June 1597, was knighted in 1645 by Charles I at Oxford, was alive in 1664, and was father of Thomas Sherley [q. v.], the physician.

Shirley married secondly at Deptford on 2 December 1617, a widow, Judith Taylor, daughter of William Bennet of London, by whom he had five sons and six daughters.

<text>Sir Anthony Shirley (1565 – 1635) was an English military officer, diplomat, writer and nobleman whose imprisonment in 1603 by James VI and I caused the House of Commons of England to assert one of its privileges, the freedom of its members from arrest, in &quot;The Form of Apology and Satisfaction&quot;.

==Family==
Anthony Shirley was the second son of Sir Thomas Shirley of Wiston, Sussex, and Anne Kempe, the daughter of Sir Thomas Kempe (d. 7 March 1591) of Olantigh in Wye, Kent. He had an elder brother, Sir Thomas Shirley, and a younger brother, Sir Robert Shirley, and six sisters who survived infancy.

==Career==
Educated at the University of Oxford, Shirley gained military experience with the English troops in the Netherlands and during an expedition to Northern France in 1591 where he distinguished himself at the Battle of Château-Laudran. Later in the year he fought under The 2nd Earl of Essex, who was related to his wife, Frances Vernon; about this time he was knighted by Henry of Navarre (Henry IV of France), and fought alongside English and Swiss troops in support of Henry, who at the time was Protestant (fighting the Catholic League) at the Siege of Rouen. As a result of his fighting prowess, Shirley and fellow knight combatant Sir Nicolas Clifford (also related to the Earl of Essex), were awarded French honorifics, an event which brought upon both men the displeasure of their own sovereign, and as a result, a short imprisonment.

In 1596, Shirley conducted a predatory expedition along the western coast of Africa and then across to Central America, including a raid on Spanish Jamaica a year later. According to Anthony Standen he had sailed from Plymouth on 21 May 1596 with five ships, with the financial support of the Earl of Essex but had hoped to command a larger fleet. Owing to a mutiny he returned to London with a single ship in 1597.

In 1598, he led a few English volunteers to Italy to take part in a dispute over the possession of Ferrara; this, however, had been accommodated when he reached Venice, and he decided to journey to Persia with the twofold object of promoting trade between England and Persia and of stirring up the Persians against the Turks. He obtained money at Constantinople and at Aleppo, and was very well received by the Shah, Abbas the Great, who made him a Mirza, or prince, and granted certain trading and other rights to all Christian merchants.

Then, as the Shah&#x27;s representative, he returned to Europe and visited Moscow, Prague, Rome, and other cities, but the English government would not allow him to return to his own country. Two members of his expedition returned to London, where they published the anonymous pamphlet &quot;The True Report of Sir Anthony Shirley&#x27;s Journey&quot;, which, additionally spurred by the actor Will Kempe&#x27;s meeting with Sir Anthony in Rome, evoked two references to &quot;the Sophy&quot;— the Shah— in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (1601–02).

For some time he was in prison in Venice, and in 1605, he went to Prague and was sent by Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor on a mission to Morocco; afterwards he went to Lisbon and to Madrid, where he was welcomed very warmly. The King of Spain appointed him the admiral of a fleet which was to serve in the Levant, but the only result of his extensive preparations was an unsuccessful expedition against the island of Mitylene. After this he was deprived of his command. Shirley, who was a count of the Holy Roman Empire, died at Madrid some time after 1635.

Shirley wrote an account of his adventures, &quot;Sir Anthony Sherley: his Relation of his Travels into Persia&quot; (1613), the original manuscript of which is in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. There are in existence five or more accounts of Shirley&#x27;s adventures in Persia, and the account of his expedition in 1596 is published in Richard Hakluyt&#x27;s &quot;Voyages and Discoveries&quot; (1809-1812). See also &quot;The Three Brothers; Travels and Adventures of Sir Anthony, Sir Robert and Sir Thomas Sherley in Persia, Russia, Turkey and Spain&quot; (London, 1825); EP Shirley, &quot;The Sherley Brothers&quot; (1848), and the same writer&#x27;s &quot;Stemmata Shirleiana&quot; (1841, again 1873).

<text>Princess Augusta of Cambridge (Augusta Caroline Charlotte Elizabeth Mary Sophia Louise; 19 July 1822 – 5 December 1916) was a member of the British royal family as the granddaughter of George III. She married into the Grand Ducal House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and became Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.

==Early life==
Augusta was born Princess Augusta of Cambridge on 19 July 1822 at the Palace of Montbrillant, Hanover. Her father was Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, the seventh son of George III and Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Her mother was Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel. As the male-line granddaughter of a British monarch, she was titled a British princess with the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;. The young princess was baptised at the same palace on 16 August 1822, by Rev Edward Curtis Kemp (Chaplain to the British Ambassador to the Court of Berlin, The Rt. Hon. Sir George Rose).
Three of her godparents were present at the baptism:
*Princess Frederick of Hesse-Kassel (her maternal grandmother)
*Princess Luise Henriette of Nassau-Usingen (her maternal grandaunt)
*Princess Louise, Countess von der Decken (her maternal aunt)
The rest were not present, possibly being represented by proxies:
*The Duke of York and Albany (her paternal uncle)
*all of her five living paternal aunts (by blood)
**The Queen Dowager of Württemberg
**The Princess Augusta Sophia
**The Landgravine of Hesse-Homburg
**The Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh
**The Princess Sophia
*The Electress of Hesse (wife of Wilhelm II, her mother&#x27;s cousin)
*The Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (her maternal aunt)
*Princess Charles of Hesse-Kassel (wife of her maternal uncle)

The Princess spent her earlier years in Hanover, where her father was the viceroy on behalf of his brother, George IV.

Princess Augusta had one brother, Prince George, later 2nd Duke of Cambridge; and one sister, Princess Mary Adelaide, later Duchess of Teck. Princess Augusta was also the aunt to Mary of Teck, later consort of George V. Additionally, Princess Augusta was the first cousin through her father to Queen Victoria and through her mother to Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel, the wife of King Christian IX of Denmark.

With her mother, she was part of the royal party at the 1838 coronation of Queen Victoria.

==Marriage==
On 28 June 1843, Princess Augusta married her first cousin, Frederick William of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, in the newly built Private Chapel at Buckingham Palace, London (they were also second cousins on their fathers&#x27; side). Upon marriage, Augusta became the Hereditary Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and, on 6 September 1860, the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz following the death of her father-in-law.

The marriage of the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess produced two sons:
* Duke Frederick William of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (born and died in London, 13 January 1845)
* Duke Adolphus Frederick of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (22 July 1848 – 11 June 1914); succeeded his father as Adolphus Frederick V in May 1904.

==Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz==
Although she spent most of her adult life in Germany, the Grand Duchess Augusta retained close personal ties to the British Royal Family. She frequently visited her mother, the Duchess of Cambridge, at her Kensington Palace apartments.

After her mother&#x27;s death in 1889, the Grand Duchess acquired a house—thereafter known as Mecklenburg House—at 16 Buckingham Gate, London, where she spent a portion of the year until advanced old age made it impossible for her to travel abroad.

In making preparations for the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in 1901, the Duke of Norfolk consulted her on matters of etiquette and attire. This was due to her presence at the coronation of King William IV and Queen Adelaide 71 years earlier. She was 9 years old at the time and kissed the Queen&#x27;s hand. She was also able to provide details of the coronation of Queen Victoria.

The Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz was particularly close to her niece, the future Queen Mary. However, old age prevented her from attending the Coronation of King George V and Queen Mary on 22 June 1911.

Following the outbreak of World War I, the British Government suspended the annuity she had been receiving as a member of the British Royal Family under the Annuity, Duchess of Mecklenburgh Strelitz Act 1843. During the war, the Swedish Embassy passed letters from the Queen to her aunt, who still lived in Germany.

As an elderly lady, she was known for being cantankerous. She was also known as being quite shrewd and intelligent. In his book, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; (London, 1959), the Queen&#x27;s official biography, James Pope-Hennessy reports that the Queen&#x27;s aunt Augusta was not fond of the new science of photography, fearing it would intrude deeply into the private lives of Royal personages; at pp. 101–105 he offers a masterly sketch of this formidable lady.

The Dowager Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz died on 5 December 1916 in Neustrelitz and was buried in Mirow. As the longest-lived grandchild of George III, she was the last link to the British branch of the House of Hanover.

At the time of her death, she was 94 years, 4 months and 16 days old, making her the longest-lived British princess by blood, until Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, a male-line granddaughter of Queen Victoria, surpassed her in 1977. Her will was sealed and in 1920 her estate was valued at £57,282 (or £1.7 million in 2022 when adjusted for inflation).

<text>Scallop () is a common name that encompasses various species of marine bivalve mollusks in the taxonomic family Pectinidae, the scallops. However, the common name &quot;scallop&quot; is also sometimes applied to species in other closely related families within the superfamily Pectinoidea, which also includes the thorny oysters.

Scallops are a cosmopolitan family of bivalves found in all of the world&#x27;s oceans, although never in fresh water. They are one of the very few groups of bivalves to be primarily &quot;free-living&quot;, with many species capable of rapidly swimming short distances and even migrating some distance across the ocean floor. A small minority of scallop species live cemented to rocky substrates as adults, while others attach themselves to stationary or rooted objects such as seagrass at some point in their lives by means of a filament they secrete called a byssal thread. The majority of species, however, live recumbent on sandy substrates, and when they sense the presence of a predator such as a starfish, they may attempt to escape by swimming swiftly but erratically through the water using jet propulsion created by repeatedly clapping their shells together. Scallops have a well-developed nervous system, and unlike most other bivalves all scallops have a ring of numerous simple eyes situated around the edge of their mantles.

Many species of scallops are highly prized as a food source, and some are farmed as aquaculture. The word &quot;scallop&quot; is also applied to the meat of these bivalves, the adductor muscle, that is sold as seafood. The brightly coloured, symmetric, fan-shaped shells of scallops with their radiating and often fluted ornamentation are valued by shell collectors, and have been used since ancient times as motifs in art, architecture, and design.

Owing to their widespread distribution, scallop shells are a common sight on beaches and are often brightly coloured, making them a popular object to collect among beachcombers and vacationers. The shells also have a significant place in popular culture.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Scallops inhabit all the oceans of the world, with the largest number of species living in the Indo-Pacific region. Most species live in relatively shallow waters from the low tide line to 100 m, while others prefer much deeper water. Although some species only live in very narrow environments, most are opportunistic and can live under a wide variety of conditions. Scallops can be found living within, upon, or under either rocks, coral, rubble, sea grass, kelp, sand, or mud. Most scallops begin their lives as byssally attached juveniles, an ability that some retain throughout their lives while others grow into free-living adults.

== Anatomy and physiology ==
Very little variation occurs in the internal arrangement of organs and systems within the scallop family, and what follows can be taken to apply to the anatomy of any given scallop species.

=== Orientation ===

The shell of a scallop consists of two sides or valves, a left valve and a right one, divided by a plane of symmetry. Most species of scallops rest on their right valve, and consequently, this valve is often deeper and more rounded than the left (i.e., upper) valve, which in many species is actually concave. With the hinge of the two valves oriented towards the top, one side corresponds to the animal&#x27;s morphological &quot;anterior&quot; or front, the other is the &quot;posterior&quot; or rear, the hinge is the &quot;dorsal&quot; or back/top region, and the bottom corresponds to the &quot;ventral&quot; or (as it were) underside/belly. However, as many scallop shells are more or less bilaterally symmetrical (&quot;equivalved&quot;), as well as symmetrical front/back (&quot;equilateral&quot;), determining which way a given animal is &quot;facing&quot; requires detailed information about its valves.

=== Valves ===

The model scallop shell consists of two similarly shaped valves with a straight hinge line along the top, devoid of teeth, and producing a pair of flat wings or &quot;ears&quot; (sometimes called &quot;auricles&quot;, though this is also the term for two chambers in its heart) on either side of its midpoint, a feature which is unique to and apparent in all adult scallops. These ears may be of similar size and shape, or the anterior ear may be somewhat larger (the posterior ear is never larger than the anterior one, an important feature for distinguishing which valve is which). As is the case in almost all bivalves, a series of lines and/or growth rings originates at the center of the hinge, at a spot called the &quot;beak&quot; surrounded by a generally raised area called the &quot;umbo&quot;. These growth rings increase in size downwards until they reach the curved ventral edge of the shell. The shells of most scallops are streamlined to facilitate ease of movement during swimming at some point in their lifecycles, while also providing protection from predators. Scallops with ridged valves have the advantage of the architectural strength provided by these ridges called &quot;ribs&quot;, although the ribs are somewhat costly in weight and mass. A unique feature of the scallop family is the presence, at some point during the animal&#x27;s lifecycle, of a distinctive and taxonomically important shell feature, a comb-like structure called a ctenolium located on the anterior edge of the &quot;right&quot; valve next to the valve&#x27;s byssal notch. Though many scallops lose this feature as they become free-swimming adults, all scallops have a ctenolium at some point during their lives, and no other bivalve has an analogous shell feature. The ctenolium is found in modern scallops only; both putative ancestors of modern scallops, the entoliids and the Aviculopectinidae, did not possess it.

=== Muscular system ===

Like the true oysters (family Ostreidae), scallops have a single central adductor muscle, thus, the inside of their shells has a characteristic central scar, marking the point of attachment for this muscle. The adductor muscle of scallops is larger and more developed than those of oysters, because scallops are active swimmers; some species of scallops are known to move &quot;en masse&quot; from one area to another. In scallops, the shell shape tends to be highly regular, and is commonly used as an archetypal form of a seashell.

====Adductor muscles====
Scallops possess fast (striated) and slow (smooth) adductor muscles, which have different structures and contractile properties. These muscles lie closely apposed to one another but are divided by a connective tissue sheet. The striated adductor muscle contracts very quickly for swimming, whereas the smooth catch adductor muscle lacks striations, and contracts for long periods, keeping shells closed with little expenditure of energy.

=== Digestive system ===
Scallops are filter feeders, and eat plankton. Unlike many other bivalves, they lack siphons. Water moves over a filtering structure, where food particles become trapped in mucus. Next, the cilia on the structure move the food toward the mouth. Then, the food is digested in the digestive gland, an organ sometimes misleadingly referred to as the &quot;liver, &quot; which envelops part of the oesophagus, intestine, and entire stomach. Waste is passed on through the intestine (the terminus of which, like that of many mollusks, enters and leaves the animal&#x27;s heart) and exits via the anus.

=== Nervous system ===
Like all bivalves, scallops lack actual brains. Instead, their nervous system is controlled by three paired ganglia located at various points throughout their anatomy, the cerebral or cerebropleural ganglia, the pedal ganglia, and the visceral or parietovisceral ganglia. All are yellowish. The visceral ganglia are by far the largest and most extensive of the three, and occur as an almost-fused mass near the center of the animal – proportionally, these are the largest and most intricate sets of ganglia of any modern bivalve. From this radiate all of the nerves which connect the visceral ganglia to the circumpallial nerve ring which loops around the mantle and connects to all of the scallop&#x27;s tentacles and eyes. This nerve ring is so well developed that, in some species, it may be legitimately considered an additional ganglion. The visceral ganglia are also the origin of the branchial nerves which control the scallop&#x27;s gills. The cerebral ganglia are the next-largest set of ganglia and lie distinct from each other a significant distance dorsal to the visceral ganglia. They are attached to the visceral ganglia by long cerebral-visceral connectives, and to each other via a cerebral commissure that extends in an arch dorsally around the esophagus. The cerebral ganglia control the scallop&#x27;s mouth via the palp nerves and connect to statocysts which help the animal sense its position in the surrounding environment. They are connected to the pedal ganglia by short cerebral-pedal connectives. The pedal ganglia, though not fused, are situated very close to each other near the midline. From the pedal ganglia, the scallop puts out pedal nerves which control the movement of, and sensation in, its small muscular foot.

== Vision ==
Scallops have a large number (up to 200) of small (about 1 mm) eyes arranged along the edge of their mantles. These eyes represent a particular innovation among molluscs, relying on a concave, parabolic mirror of guanine crystals to focus and retro-reflect light instead of a lens as found in many other eye types. Additionally, their eyes possess a double-layered retina, the outer retina responding most strongly to light and the inner to abrupt darkness. While these eyes are unable to resolve shapes with high fidelity, the combined sensitivity of both retinas to light entering the eye and light retro-reflected from the mirror grants scallops exceptional contrast definition, as well as the ability to detect changing patterns of light and motion. Scallops primarily rely on their eyes as an &#x27;early-warning&#x27; threat detection system, scanning around them for movement and shadows which could potentially indicate predators. Additionally, some scallops alter their swimming or feeding behaviour based on the turbidity or clarity of the water, by detecting the movement of particulate matter in the water column.

== Locomotion ==


Scallops are mostly free-living and active, unlike the vast majority of bivalves, which are mostly slow-moving and infaunal. All scallops are thought to start out with a byssus, which attaches them to some form of substrate such as eelgrass when they are very young. Most species lose the byssus as they grow larger. A very few species go on to cement themselves to a hard substrate (e.g. &quot;Chlamys distorta&quot; and &quot;Hinnites multirigosus&quot;).

However, the majority of scallops are free-living and can swim with brief bursts of speed to escape predators (mostly starfish) by rapidly opening and closing their valves. Indeed, everything about their characteristic shell shape – its symmetry, narrowness, smooth and/ or grooved surface, small flexible hinge, powerful adductor muscle, and continuous and uniformly curved edge – facilitates such activity. They often do this in spurts of several seconds before closing the shell entirely and sinking back to the bottom of their environment. Scallops are able to move through the water column either forward/ventrally (termed swimming) by sucking water in through the space between their valves, an area called the gape, and ejecting it through small holes near the hinge line called exhalant apertures, or backward/dorsally (termed jumping) by ejecting the water out the same way it came in (i.e. ventrally). A jumping scallop usually lands on the sea floor between each contraction of its valves, whereas a swimming scallop stays in the water column for most or all of its contractions and travels a much greater distance (though seldom at a height of more than 1 m off the sea bed and seldom for a distance of greater than 5 m). Both jumping and swimming movements are very energy-intensive, and most scallops cannot perform more than four or five in a row before becoming completely exhausted and requiring several hours of rest. Should a swimming scallop land on its left side, it is capable of flipping itself over to its right side via a similar shell-clapping movement called the righting reflex. So-called singing scallops are rumored to make an audible, soft popping sound as they flap their shells underwater (though whether or not this happens is open to some debate). Other scallops can extend their foot from between their valves, and by contracting the muscles in their foot, they can burrow into sand.

=== Mobility and behavior ===

Most species of the scallop family are free-living, active swimmers, propelling themselves through the water through the adductor muscles to open and close their shells. Swimming occurs through the clapping of valves for water intake. Closing the valves propels water with a strong force near the hinge via the velum, a curtain-like fold of the mantle that directs water expulsion around the hinge. Scallops swim in the direction of the valve opening unless the velum directs an abrupt change in course direction.

Other species of scallops can be found on the ocean floor attached to objects by byssal threads. Byssal threads are strong, silky fibers extending from the muscular foot, used to attach to a firm support, such as a rock. Some can also be found on the ocean floor, moving with an extendable foot between their valves or burrowing themselves in the sand by extending and retracting their feet. Scallops are highly sensitive to shadows, vibrations, water movement, and chemical stimuli. All possess a series of 100 blue eyes, embedded on the edge of the mantle of their upper and lower valves that can distinguish between light and darkness. They serve as a vital defense mechanism for avoiding predators. Though rather weak, their series of eyes can detect surrounding movement and alert precaution in the presence of predators, most commonly sea stars, crabs, and snails. Physiological fitness and exercise of scallops decrease with age due to the decline of cellular and especially mitochondrial function, thus increasing the risk of capture and lowering rates of survival. Older individuals show lower mitochondrial volume density and aerobic capacity, as well as decreased anaerobic capacity construed from the amount of glycogen stored in muscle tissue. Environmental factors, such as changes in oxidative stress parameters, can inhibit the growth and development of scallops.

Seasonal changes in temperature and food availability have been shown to affect muscle metabolic capabilities. The properties of mitochondria from the phasic adductor muscle of &quot;Euvola ziczac&quot; varied significantly during their annual reproductive cycle. Summer scallops in May have lower maximal oxidative capacities and substrate oxidation than any other time in the year. This phenomenon is due to lower protein levels in adductor muscles.

== Lifecycle and growth ==
The scallop family is unusual in that some members of the family are dioecious (males and females are separate), while others are simultaneous hermaphrodites (both sexes in the same individual), and a few are protoandrous hermaphrodites (males when young then switching to female). Female scallops have red roe and male scallops have white roe. Spermatozoa and ova are released freely into the water during mating season and fertilized ova sink to the bottom. After several weeks, the immature scallops hatch and the larvae, miniature transparent versions of the adults called &quot;spat&quot;, drift in the plankton until settling to the bottom again (an event called spatfall) to grow, usually attaching by means of byssal threads. Some scallops, such as the Atlantic bay scallop &quot;Argopecten irradians&quot;, are short-lived, while others can live 20 years or more. Age can often be inferred from annuli, the concentric rings of their shells.

Many scallops are hermaphrodites (having female and male organs simultaneously), altering their sex throughout their lives, while others exist as dioecious species, having a definite sex. In this case, males are distinguished by roe-containing white testes and females with roe-containing orange ovaries. At the age of two, they usually become sexually active, but do not contribute significantly to egg production until four. The reproduction process occurs externally through spawning, in which eggs and sperm are released into the water. Spawning typically occurs in late summer and early autumn; spring spawning may also take place in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. The females of scallops are highly fecund, capable of producing hundreds of millions of eggs per year.

Once an egg is fertilized, it is then planktonic, a collection of microorganisms that drift abundantly in fresh or salt water. Larvae stay in the water column for four to seven weeks before dissipating to the ocean floor, where they attach themselves to objects through byssus threads. Byssus is eventually lost with adulthood, transitioning almost all scallop species into free swimmers. Rapid growth occurs within the first several years, with an increase of 50–80 % in shell height and quadrupled size in meat weight, and reaches a commercial size at about four to five years of age. The lifespans of some scallops have been known to extend over 20 years.

==Ecology==
Scallops are known to be infected by viruses, bacteria, microalgae of the heterokonts and dinoflagellates. 

=== Mutualism ===
Some scallops, including &quot;Chlamys hastata&quot;, frequently carry epibionts such as sponges and barnacles on their shells. The relationship of the sponge to the scallop is characterized as a form of mutualism, because the sponge provides protection by interfering with adhesion of predatory sea-star tube feet, camouflages &quot;Chlamys hastata&quot; from predators, or forms a physical barrier around byssal openings to prevent sea stars from inserting their digestive membranes. Sponge encrustation protects &quot;C. hastata&quot; from barnacle larvae settlement, serving as a protection from epibionts that increase susceptibility to predators. Thus, barnacle larvae settlement occurs more frequently on sponge-free shells than on sponge-encrusted shells.

In fact, barnacle encrustation negatively influences swimming in &quot;C. hastata&quot;. Those swimming with barnacle encrustation require more energy and show a detectable difference in anaerobic energy expenditure than those without encrustation. In the absence of barnacle encrustation, individual scallops swim significantly longer, travel further, and attain greater elevation.

== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==

=== Etymology ===
The family name Pectinidae, which is based on the name of the type genus, &quot;Pecten&quot;, comes from the Latin &quot;&quot; meaning comb, in reference to a comb-like structure of the shell which is situated next to the byssal notch.

=== Phylogeny ===
The fossil history of scallops is rich in species and specimens. The earliest known records of true scallops (those with a ctenolium) can be found from the Triassic period, over 200 million years ago. The earliest species were divided into two groups, one with a nearly smooth exterior: &quot;Pleuronectis&quot; von Schlotheim, 1820, while the other had radial ribs or riblets and auricles: &quot;Praechlamys&quot; Allasinaz, 1972. Fossil records also indicate that the abundance of species within the Pectinidae has varied greatly over time; Pectinidae was the most diverse bivalve family in the Mesozoic era, but the group almost disappeared completely by the end of the Cretaceous period. The survivors speciated rapidly during the Tertiary period. Nearly 7,000 species and subspecies names have been introduced for both fossil and recent Pectinidae.

The cladogram is based on molecular phylogeny using mitochondrial (12S, 16S) and nuclear (18S, 28S, and H3) gene markers by Yaron Malkowsky and Annette Klussmann-Kolb in 2012.
==== Taxonomic structure ====
Scallops are the family Pectinidae, marine bivalve molluscs within the superfamily Pectinoidea. Other families within this same superfamily share a somewhat similar overall shell shape, and some species within some of the related families are also commonly referred to as &quot;scallops&quot; (for example, Propeamussiidae, the glass scallops).

The family Pectinidae is the most diversified of the pectinoideans in present-day oceans. It is one of the largest marine bivalve families and contains over 300 extant species in 60 genera. Its origin dates back to the Middle Triassic Period, approximately 240 million years ago; in terms of diversity, it has been a thriving family to the present day.

Evolution from its origin has resulted in a successful and diverse group: pectinids are present in the world&#x27;s seas, found in environments ranging from the intertidal zone to the hadal depths. The Pectinidae play an extremely important role in many benthic communities and exhibit a wide range of shell shapes, sizes, sculptures, and cultures.

Raines and Poppe listed nearly 900 species names of scallops, but most of these are considered either questionable or invalid. Raines and Poppe mentioned over 50 genera, around 250 species, and subspecies. Although species are generally well-circumscribed, their attribution to subfamilies and genera is sometimes equivocal, and information about phylogeny and relationships of the species are minimal, not the least because most work has been based only on adult morphology.

This family&#x27;s earliest and most comprehensive taxonomic treatments were based on macroscopic morphological characters of the adult shells and represent broadly divergent classification schemes. Some level of taxonomic stability was achieved when Waller&#x27;s studies in 1986, 1991, and 1993 concluded evolutionary relationships between pectinid taxa based on hypothesized morphological synapomorphies, which previous classification systems of Pectinidae failed to do. He created three Pectinidae subfamilies: Camptonectinidae, Chlamydinae and Pectininae.

The framework of its phylogeny shows that repeated life habit states derive from evolutionary convergence and parallelism. Studies have determined the family Pectinidae is monophyletic, developing from a single common ancestor. The direct ancestors of Pectinidae were scallop-like bivalves of the family Entoliidae. Entoliids had auricles and a byssal notch only at youth, but they did not have a ctenolium, a comb-like arrangement along the margins of the byssal notch in Pectinidae. The ctenolium is the defining feature of the modern family Pectinidae and is a characteristic that has evolved within the lineage.

In a 2008 paper, Puslednik et al. identified considerable convergence of shell morphology in a subset species of gliding Pectinidae, which suggests iterative morphological evolution may be more prevalent in the family than previously believed.

There have been a number of efforts to address phylogenetic studies. Only three have assessed more than ten species and only one has included multiple outgroups. Nearly all previous molecular analyses of the Pectinidae have only utilized mitochondrial data. Phylogenies based only on mitochondrial sequence data do not always provide an accurate estimation on the species tree. Complicated factors can arise due to the presence of genetic polymorphisms in ancestral species and resultant lineage sorting.

In molecular phylogenies of the Bivalvia, both the Spondylidae and the Propeamussiidae have been resolved as sister to the Pectinidae.

== Seafood industry ==

=== Aquaculture ===
=== Wild fisheries ===
The largest wild scallop fishery is for the Atlantic sea scallop (&quot;Placopecten magellanicus&quot;) found off the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. Scallops are harvested using scallop dredges or bottom trawls. Most of the rest of the world&#x27;s production of scallops is from Japan (wild, enhanced, and aquaculture) and China (mostly cultured Atlantic bay scallops).

In the D&#x27;Entrecasteaux Channel in the south of Tasmania dredging was banned in 1969, and since then divers have caught them in this area. Attempts to use lighted pots to attract lobster and crab led to the discovery that they were effective in attracting scallops.

=== Sustainability ===
The scallop fishery in New Zealand declined from a catch of 1246 tonnes in 1975 to 41 tonnes in 1980, at which point the government ordered the fishery closed. Spat seeding in the 1980s helped it recover, and catches in the 1990s were up to 684 tonnes. The Tasman Bay area was closed to commercial scallop harvesting from 2009 to 2011 due to a decline in the numbers. The commercial catch was down to 22 tonnes in 2015, and the fishery was closed again. The main causes for the decline seem to be fishing, climate effects, disease, pollutants, and sediment runoff from farming and forestry. Forest and Bird list scallops as the &quot;Worst Choice&quot; in their Best Fish Guide for sustainable seafood species.

On the east coast of the United States, over the last 100 years, the populations of bay scallops have greatly diminished due to several factors but probably mostly due to a reduction in seagrasses (to which bay scallop spat attach) caused by increased coastal development and concomitant nutrient runoff. Another possible factor is the reduction of sharks from overfishing. A variety of sharks used to feed on rays, which are the main predator of bay scallops. With the shark population reduced – this apex predator in some places almost eliminated – the rays have been free to feed on scallops to greatly decrease their numbers. By contrast, the Atlantic sea scallop (&quot;Placopecten magellanicus&quot;) is at historically high levels of abundance after recovery from overfishing.

== As food ==

Scallops are characterized by offering two flavors and textures in one shell: the meat, called &quot;scallop&quot;, which is firm and white, and the roe, called &quot;coral&quot;, which is soft and often brightly coloured reddish-orange. Sometimes, markets sell scallops already prepared in the shell, with only the meat remaining. Outside the U.S., the scallop is often sold whole. They are available both with and without coral in the UK and Australia.

Scallops without any additives are called &quot;dry-packed&quot;, while scallops that are treated with sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) are called &quot;wet-packed&quot;. STPP causes the scallops to absorb moisture prior to the freezing process, thereby increasing their weight. The freezing process takes about two days.

In French cuisine, scallops are often quickly cooked in a hot buttered pan, sometimes with calvados and served with creamed leeks, or prepared in a white wine sauce. In Galician cuisine, scallops are baked with breadcrumbs, ham, and onions. 

Scallops are sometimes breaded, deep-fried, and served with coleslaw and french fries in the northeastern United States (either on their own or as part of a fisherman&#x27;s platter). In New England, some seafood restaurants offer scallop rolls, consisting of breaded scallops on a grilled, split-top hot dog bun.

In Japanese cuisine, scallops may be served in soup or prepared as &quot;sashimi&quot; or &quot;sushi&quot;. In a sushi bar, &quot;hotategai&quot; (帆立貝, 海扇) is the traditional scallop on rice and, while &quot;kaibashira&quot; (貝柱) is more loosely used to include other shellfish species with round-shaped flesh (the adductor muscle), such as &quot;Atrina pectinata&quot; (帶子). 

Dried scallop is known in Cantonese Chinese cuisine as &quot;conpoy&quot; (乾瑤柱, 乾貝, 干貝). Smoked scallops are sometimes served as appetizers or used as an ingredient in the preparation of various dishes and appetizers.

Scallops have lent their name to the culinary term &quot;scalloped&quot;, which originally referred to seafood creamed and served hot in the shell. Today, it means a creamed casserole dish such as scalloped potatoes, which contains no seafood at all.


== Pearls ==

Scallops do occasionally produce pearls, though scallop pearls do not have the buildup of translucent layers or &quot;nacre&quot; which give desirability to the pearls of the feather oysters, and usually lack both lustre and iridescence. They can be dull, small, and of varying colour, but exceptions occur that are appreciated for their aesthetic qualities.

== Symbolism of the shell ==
=== Shell of Saint James ===


The scallop shell is the traditional emblem of St James the Great and is popular with pilgrims travelling the Way of St James (Camino de Santiago). Medieval Christians would collect a scallop shell while at Compostela as evidence of having made the journey. The association of Saint James with the scallop can most likely be traced to the legend that the apostle once rescued a knight covered in scallops. An alternative version of the legend holds that while St. James&#x27; remains were being transported to Galicia (Spain) from Jerusalem. As the ship approached land, the wedding of the daughter of Queen Lupa was taking place on shore. The young groom was on horseback, and, upon seeing the ship&#x27;s approach, his horse got spooked, and horse and rider plunged into the sea. Through miraculous intervention, the horse and rider emerged from the water alive, covered in seashells.

Indeed, in French, the mollusc itself – as well as a popular preparation of it in cream sauce – is called . In German they are – literally &quot;James&#x27;s shellfish&quot;. Curiously the Linnaean name &quot;Pecten jacobeus&quot; is given to the Mediterranean scallop, while the scallop endemic to Galicia is called &quot;Pecten maximus&quot; due to its bigger size. The scallop shell is represented in the decoration of churches named after St. James, such as in St James&#x27; Church, Sydney, where it appears in a number of places, including in the mosaics on the floor of the chancel.

When referring to St James, a scallop shell valve is displayed with its convex outer surface showing. In contrast, when the shell refers to the goddess Venus (see below), it is displayed with its concave interior surface showing.

=== Fossil Fuel ===
The Shell company, one of the world&#x27;s biggest companies, is represented by a scallop.

=== Badge ===
The scallop shell symbol found its way into heraldry as a badge of those who had been on the pilgrimage to Compostela, although later, it became a symbol of pilgrimage in general. Sir Winston Churchill and Lady Diana&#x27;s family, the Spencer family coat of arms includes a scallop, as well as both of Diana&#x27;s sons Prince William and Prince Harry&#x27;s personal coats of arms; also Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s personal coat of arms includes a scallop; another example is the surname Wilmot and also John Wesley&#x27;s (which as a result the scallop shell is used as an emblem of Methodism). However, charges in heraldry do not always have an unvarying symbolic meaning, and there are cases of arms in which no family member went on a pilgrimage, and the occurrence of the scallop is simply a pun on the name of the armiger (as in the case of Jacques Coeur), or for other reasons. In 1988, the State of New York in the US chose the bay scallop (&quot;Argopecten irradians&quot;) as its state shell.

=== Fertility symbol ===
Throughout antiquity, scallops and other hinged shells have symbolized the feminine principle. Outwardly, the shell can symbolize the protective and nurturing principle, and inwardly, the &quot;life-force slumbering within the Earth&quot;, an emblem of the vulva.

Many paintings of Venus, the Roman goddess of love and fertility, included a scallop shell in the painting to identify her. This is evident in Botticelli&#x27;s classically inspired 15th century painting &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot;.

One legend of the Way of St. James holds that the route was seen as a fertility pilgrimage, undertaken when a young couple desired to bear offspring. The scallop shell is believed to have originally been carried by pagans as a symbol of fertility.

===Other interpretations===
Alternatively, the scallop resembles the setting sun, which was the focus of the pre-Christian Celtic rituals of the area. To wit, the pre-Christian roots of the &quot;Way of St. James&quot; was a Celtic death journey westwards towards the setting sun, terminating at the &quot;End of the World&quot; (&quot;Finisterra&quot;) on the &quot;Coast of Death&quot; (Costa da Morte) and the &quot;Sea of Darkness&quot; (i.e., the Abyss of Death, the &quot;Mare Tenebrosum&quot;, Latin for the Atlantic Ocean, itself named after the &quot;Dying Civilization&quot; of Atlantis).

===Contemporary art===

The beach at Aldeburgh, Suffolk, England, features Maggi Hambling&#x27;s steel sculpture, &quot;The Scallop&quot;, erected in 2003 as a memorial to the composer Benjamin Britten, who had a long association with the town.

== Scalloped shape ==

The term &quot;scalloped&quot; is used to designate a decorative pattern, resembling the wavy scallop surface, that is used at the edges of furniture, fabrics, and other items.

<text>The Agaricales are an order of fungi in the division Basidiomycota. As originally conceived, the order contained all the agarics (gilled mushrooms), but subsequent research has shown that not all agarics are closely related and some belong in other orders, such as the Russulales and Boletales. Conversely, DNA research has also shown that many non-agarics, including some of the clavarioid fungi (clubs and corals) and gasteroid fungi (puffballs and false truffles) belong within the Agaricales. The order has 46 extant families, more than 400 genera, and over 25,000 described species, along with six extinct genera known only from the fossil record. Species in the Agaricales range from the familiar &quot;Agaricus bisporus&quot; (cultivated mushroom) and the deadly &quot;Amanita virosa&quot; (destroying angel) to the coral-like &quot;Clavaria zollingeri&quot; (violet coral) and bracket-like &quot;Fistulina hepatica&quot; (beefsteak fungus).

==History, classification and phylogeny==

In his three volumes of &quot;Systema Mycologicum&quot; published between 1821 and 1832, Elias Fries put almost all of the fleshy, gill-forming mushrooms in the genus &quot;Agaricus&quot;. He organized the large genus into &quot;tribes&quot;, the names of many of which still exist as common genera of today. Fries later elevated several of these tribes to generic level, but later authors—including Gillet, Karsten, Kummer, Quélet, and Staude—made most of the changes. Fries based his classification on macroscopic characters of the fruit bodies and color of the spore print. His system had been widely used as it had the advantage that many genera could be readily identified based on characters observable in the field. Fries&#x27;s classification was later challenged when microscopic studies of basidiocarp structure, initiated by Fayod and Patouillard, demonstrated several of Fries&#x27;s groupings were unnatural. In the twentieth century, Rolf Singer&#x27;s influential work &quot;The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy&quot;, published in four editions spanning from 1951 to 1986, used both Fries&#x27;s macroscopic characters and Fayod&#x27;s microscopic characters to reorganize families and genera; his final classification included 230 genera within 18 families. Singer treated three major groups within the Agaricales &quot;sensu lato&quot;: the Agaricales &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, Boletineae, and Russulales. These groups are still accepted by modern treatments based on DNA analysis, as the euagarics clade, bolete clade, and russuloid clade.

Molecular phylogenetics research has demonstrated that the euagarics clade is roughly equivalent to Singer&#x27;s Agaricales &quot;sensu stricto&quot;. A large-scale study by Brandon Matheny and colleagues used nucleic acid sequences representing six gene regions from 238 species in 146 genera to explore the phylogenetic grouping within the Agaricales. The analysis showed that most of the species tested could be grouped into six clades that were named the Agaricoid, Tricholomatoid, Marasmioid, Pluteoid, Hygrophoroid and Plicaturopsidoid clades.

Molecular studies have shown that agarics are more divergent than once thought. Agarics in the genera &quot;Russula&quot; and &quot;Lactarius&quot;, for example, belong to the order Russulales, whilst agarics in the genera &quot;Paxillus&quot; and &quot;Hygrophoropsis&quot; belong in the Boletales. Conversely some genera with non-agaric fruit bodies, such as the puffballs, bird&#x27;s nest fungi, and many clavarioid fungi, belong in the Agaricales.

==Distribution and habitat==
Members of the Agaricales are ubiquitous, with species found in all continents. The great majority are terrestrial, in almost every habitat from woodland and grassland to deserts and dunes. Agaricoid species were long thought to be solely terrestrial, until the 2005 discovery of &quot;Psathyrella aquatica&quot;, the only gilled mushroom known to fruit underwater. Species are variously saprotrophic or ectomycorrhizal, occasionally parasitic on plants or other fungi, and sometimes lichenized.

the Agaricales include six monotypic fossil genera mostly found fossilized in amber. The oldest records are from three Cretaceous age genera; the late Aptian &quot;Gondwanagaricites magnificus&quot; from the Crato Formation (Brazil), the Albian age (approximately 100 Ma) &quot;Palaeoagaracites antiquus&quot; from Burmese amber and the slightly younger Turonian New Jersey Amber species &quot;Archaeomarasmius leggeti&quot;. The three other species, &quot;Aureofungus yaniguaensis&quot;, &quot;Coprinites dominicana&quot; and &quot;Protomycena electra&quot; are known from single specimens found in the Dominican amber mines of Hispaniola.

==Genera &quot;incertae sedis&quot;==
There are several genera classified in the Agaricales that are i) poorly known, ii) have not been subjected to DNA analysis, or iii) if analysed phylogenetically do not group with as yet named or identified families, and have not been assigned to a specific family (i.e., &quot;incertae sedis&quot; with respect to familial placement). These include:

*&quot;Cephaloscypha&quot; – 1 sp.
*&quot;Cheilophlebium&quot; – 1 sp.
*&quot;Cymatella&quot; – 1 sp.
*&quot;Cymatellopsis&quot; – 1 sp.

*&quot;Gramincola&quot; – 1 sp.
*&quot;Laterradea&quot; – 1 sp.
*&quot;Lycogalopsis&quot; – 9 spp.
*&quot;Metraria&quot; – 2 spp.
*&quot;Metulocyphella&quot; – 2 spp.

*&quot;Mycospongia&quot; – 1 sp.
*&quot;Nochascypha&quot; – 6 spp.
*&quot;Palaeocephala&quot; – 1 sp.
*&quot;Peglerochaete&quot; – 1 sp.
*&quot;Phlebonema&quot; – 1 sp.
*&quot;Polygaster&quot; – 1 sp.
*&quot;Pseudohygrophorus&quot; – 1 sp.
*&quot;Secotium&quot; – ca. 15 spp.
*&quot;Skepperiella&quot; – 4 spp.
*&quot;Stanglomyces&quot; – 1 sp.

<text>Sexy Beast is a 2000 black comedy crime film directed by Jonathan Glazer (in his feature film directorial debut) and written by Louis Mellis and David Scinto. It stars Ray Winstone, Ben Kingsley, and Ian McShane. It follows Gary &quot;Gal&quot; Dove (Winstone), a retired criminal visited by a sociopathic gangster (Kingsley) who demands that he take part in a bank robbery in London.

&quot;Sexy Beast&quot; was critically acclaimed, and Kingsley&#x27;s performance earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. In 2004, &quot;Total Film&quot; named &quot;Sexy Beast&quot; the 15th best British film. It was the final film to feature Cavan Kendall, who died of cancer shortly after filming ended.

==Plot==
British ex-criminal Gary &quot;Gal&quot; Dove is happily retired on the Costa del Sol with his beloved wife DeeDee, his best friend Aitch, and Aitch&#x27;s wife Jackie. An old criminal associate, the feared sociopath Don Logan, arrives at Gal&#x27;s villa, intent on enlisting Gal for a bank robbery in London planned by crime lord Teddy Bass. Teddy has learned about the bank vault from Harry, the bank&#x27;s chairman, whom he met at an orgy. Gal declines, but Don continues to pressure Gal, growing increasingly aggressive and violent.

After Gal suggests that Don&#x27;s real reason for visiting is his infatuation with Jackie, with whom he had a brief affair, Don grows furious and leaves. On the plane back to England, Don refuses to extinguish his cigarette prior to takeoff, is aggressive to staff and other passengers, and is ejected, but avoids punishment by claiming that a flight attendant sexually assaulted him. He returns to the villa screaming obscenities and attacks Gal with a glass. DeeDee emerges with Gal&#x27;s hunting shotgun and shoots Don, incapacitating him; the group beat him to death and bury him under the swimming pool.

To avoid raising suspicion with Don&#x27;s disappearance, Gal decides to do the job in London - preparing for the heist. When Teddy questions Gal about Don&#x27;s whereabouts, Gal lies and claims that Don returned to London and called him from Heathrow Airport. The heist involves using diving gear to drill into the bank vault from a pool in a neighbouring bath house. The pool water muffles the sound of the drilling equipment and also floods the vault and shorts its security system. As Teddy&#x27;s crew empties the vault&#x27;s safe deposit boxes, Gal secretly pockets a pair of ruby and diamond earrings.

After the job, Teddy insists on driving Gal to the airport. He stops at Harry&#x27;s home, where he shoots Harry and demands that Gal tell him where Don is. Gal responds that he is &quot;not into this any more&quot;. While dropping Gal off, Teddy indicates that he knows that Gal was involved in something happening to Don, and implies that Gal would be severely punished if Teddy cared at all about Don. He suggests he may visit Gal in Spain and humiliates him by paying him only £10 for the job.

Gal returns to his friends and family in Spain, where DeeDee wears the earrings and life has returned to normal. Gal still hears Don&#x27;s voice in his head; he responds that Don is dead now and can &quot;shut up&quot;.

==Cast==
* Ray Winstone as Gary &#x27;Gal&#x27; Dove, a retired criminal who married DeeDee and moved to Spain to start a new life
* Ben Kingsley as Don Logan, a violent sociopath and recruiter for the London underworld
* Ian McShane as Teddy Bass, a London crime boss 
* Amanda Redman as DeeDee Dove, Gal&#x27;s beloved wife and a former porn star
* James Fox as Harry, a banker who shows Bass the vault
* Cavan Kendall as Aitch, Dove&#x27;s best friend
* Julianne White as Jackie, Aitch&#x27;s wife, who had a fling with Don
* Álvaro Monje as Enrique, a young Spanish domestic servant who helps Gal around the house

==Production==
&quot;Sexy Beast&quot; was shot in London and Spain in the summer of 1999. Ray Winstone travelled to Spain two weeks before filming commenced to get as deep a tan as he could in the time possible and to eat as much as he could to bulk up considerably. He later called this &quot;the best rehearsal time I&#x27;ve ever had in my life&quot;. Winstone had originally been considered for the role of Don, along with Anthony Hopkins.

The producer Jeremy Thomas remembered his experience making the film:

Technical elements of the heist have been compared with those in the 1979 film &quot;Sewers of Gold&quot;, which also starred McShane in the central role.

==Reception==
, the film has an approval rating of 87% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 141 reviews with an average rating of 7.30/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;&quot;Sexy Beast&quot; rises above other movies in the British gangster genre due to its performances—particularly an electrifying one by Ben Kingsley—and the script&#x27;s attention to character development.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a rating of 79/100, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

It received praise from writers at the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Slate&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was less enthusiastic, describing the plot as &quot;preposterous&quot; and highlighting &quot;Ben Kingsley spraying saliva-lubricated variants of the F-word into the atmosphere like anti-aircraft fire for 10 solid minutes&quot; as the film&#x27;s &quot;one guilty pleasure&quot;.

==Box office==
&quot;Sexy Beast&quot; grossed $10.2 million on a budget of $4.3 million, making it a relative box office success.

==Awards and honors==
Kingsley&#x27;s performance received a majority of the accolades given to &quot;Sexy Beast&quot;, winning Best Supporting Actor awards from the Broadcast Film Critics Association, Boston Society of Film Critics, Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association, Florida Film Critics Circle, San Diego Film Critics Society, Southeastern Film Critics Association and the Toronto Film Critics Association. He also was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award (losing to Ian McKellen for his performance in &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;), a Golden Globe and an Academy Award (losing both to Jim Broadbent for his performance in &quot;Iris&quot;).

The film also won Best Director and Best Screenplay from the British Independent Film Awards and Special Recognition (&quot;For excellence in film making&quot;) from the National Board of Review.

==Music==
Original music for the film was composed by Spanish composer/saxophonist Roque Baños and English electronic band UNKLE in collaboration with South . Dean Martin&#x27;s version of &quot;Sway&quot; accompanies the film&#x27;s end credits. The soundtrack also includes &quot;Peaches&quot; by The Stranglers, &quot;Cuba&quot; by The Gibson Brothers, &quot;G-Spot&quot; by Wayne Marshall, &quot;Daddy Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot; by Derek Martin, and Henry Mancini&#x27;s &quot;Lujon&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
Brian Sella of The Front Bottoms attributes the band&#x27;s name to a line spoken by Ben Kingsley in the film. Another line spoken by Kingsley inspired The Kooks&#x27; song &quot;Jackie Big Tits&quot;.

== Prequel television series ==

A prequel television series based on the film was in development at Paramount Network, which was being produced by Paramount Television Studios and Anonymous Content. However, the series was scrapped by Paramount Network. On 15 February 2022, ViacomCBS Networks UK And Australia announced that the series was revived for Paramount+, but would instead be produced by Train a Comin&#x27; Productions, Familystyle, Chapter One, Solas Mind, Anonymous Content and Paramount Television International Studios. The eight-episode series was released on 25 January 2024.

<text>Clara Smith (March 13, 1894 – February 2, 1935) was an American classic female blues singer, billed as the &quot;Queen of the Moaners&quot;, although she had a lighter and sweeter voice than many of her contemporaries. Clara Smith was not related to the singers Bessie Smith and Mamie Smith.

== Early life ==
Clara Smith was born to parents Selena and William Smith in Spartanburg County, South Carolina. She is not believed to have any siblings. She never was enrolled in school but was recorded on the census as able to read and write. Blues historians thinks that Smith most likely was introduced in her youth to &quot;traveling tent shows&quot;, that frequently stopped in Spartanburg and sparked her interest in performance.

==Career==
In 1910, Smith began working on African-American theater circuits, in tent shows, and vaudeville. By 1918, she was appearing as a headliner with the Theater Owners Booking Association circuit across Southern states. By 1923, she had performed at major theatres of the time such as the Lyric in New Orleans, the Dream Theatre in Columbus, Georgia, the Bijou Theatre in Nashville, and the Booker T. Washington Theatre in St. Louis.

In 1923, she settled in New York City, appearing at cabarets and speakeasies there. She was then signed to a recording contract, and the same year she made the first of her commercially successful series of gramophone recordings with Columbia Records, working with many other musicians such as Fletcher Henderson, Louis Armstrong, and Don Redman. She recorded two duets with Bessie Smith: &quot;My Man Blues&quot; and &quot;Far Away Blues&quot; (Columbia 14098-D), on September 1, 1925. She recorded Tom Delaney&#x27;s &quot;Troublesome Blues&quot; in 1927. Initially a singer of depressing ballads, she later began recording more uptempo numbers. Her May 1926 recording of &quot;Whip It to a Jelly&quot; was noted as &quot;one of the more overt sexual blues&quot;. Smith cut 122 sides, all with Columbia Records, with her record sales being topped only by Bessie Smith. Clara Smith was known across the U.S., even performing on the West Coast, which was rare for a blues singer.

During her time performing, Smith met young Josephine Baker and chose to mentor her. Smith is accredited for giving Baker her start in the recording business, having hired Baker when aged 13 as her dresser. Smith and Baker are thought to have had a romantic relationship for a time, notably being referred to as &quot;lady lovers&quot; by a colleague.

In 1933, she was on the road in Detroit, Michigan and worked at theaters in revues there until she succumbed to heart disease in February 1935, a month short of her 41st birthday.

<doc id="300915" wikidata="Q659629" url="?curid=300915" title="Boletales">
<text>The Boletales are an order of Agaricomycetes containing over 1300 species with a diverse array of fruiting body types. The boletes are the best known members of this group, and until recently, the Boletales were thought to only contain boletes. The Boletales are now known to contain distinct groups of agarics, puffballs, and other fruiting-body types.

==Taxonomy==
The order Boletales originally was created to describe boletes, but based on and molecular phylogenetic characteristics, a large number of nonbolete species have recently been reclassified to belong to this group, as well. The order also includes some gilled mushrooms, in the families Gomphidiaceae, Serpulaceae, Tapinellaceae, Hygrophoropsidaceae, and Paxillaceae, which often have the same flesh texture as the boletes, spore-bearing tissue which is also easily separable from the cap, and similar microscopic characteristics of spores and cystidia. Taxonomic studies using secondary metabolites and later molecular phylogenetic evidence moved several physically dissimilar groups into Boletales, including the Sclerodermataceae (earthballs) and the Rhizopogonaceae (false truffles).

Phylogenetic analyses shows the Sclerodermataceae, Boletinellaceae and Gyroporaceae appear to form a discrete group within the Boletales, and together with the Pisolithaceae, and the Astraceae, are grouped under the suborder Sclerodermatineae. Thus, the boletes of &quot;Boletinellus&quot; and &quot;Phlebopus&quot; are more closely related to earthballs of &quot;Scleroderma&quot; than to &quot;Boletus&quot;. Similarly, the bolete genus &quot;Suillus&quot; is more closely related to the agarics and false truffles of &quot;Chroogomphus&quot;, &quot;Gomphidius&quot;, and &quot;Rhizopogon&quot; than to &quot;Boletus&quot;.

In some older classification systems, a part of the family Boletaceae was separated to form the family Strobilomycetaceae. However, more recent molecular genetics studies have found it to be an unnatural grouping. According to the 2008 (10th) edition of the &quot;Dictionary of the Fungi&quot;, the Boletales comprise 17 families, 96 genera, and 1316 species.

==Ecology==
The Boletales are largely ectomycorrhizal fungi, hence are found mainly in or near woodlands. Certain species are parasitic rather than ectomycorrhizal. Members of the family Gomphidiaceae are thought to be parasitic upon members of the family Suillaceae; these relationships are often highly species-specific. Other parasitic boletes included &quot;Pseudoboletus parasiticus&quot; which grows on &quot;Scleroderma citrinum&quot;. A few species are saprophytic and lignicolous, like those in the genus &quot;Buchwaldoboletus&quot;.

==Edibility and identification==
Boletes are usually identified by having a sponge-like surface under the cap, instead of the usual gills. They occur in a variety of colours, such as red, white, brown and gray. Many of the inedible boletes are either white or red, and these should be avoided during picking.

The genus &quot;Boletus&quot; contains many edible species, most notably, &quot;B. edulis&quot;, including &quot;B. aereus&quot; and &quot;B. pinophilus&quot;, though many others are eaten, as well, such as &quot;B. badius&quot;. &quot;B. edulis&quot; and its relatives are of great commercial importance in Europe and North America. Species of &quot;Suillus&quot; are considered by many to be slimy and insipid; in Russia, though, they are often pickled and even sold commercially this way. In North America, &quot;S. pungens&quot;, known also as the &quot;slippery jack,&quot; is said by some to be delicious cooked, provided the slimy coat of its cap is removed beforehand. Many boletes, while not toxic, are nonetheless bitter-tasting and inedible.

The Paxillaceae contain a number of species that have been implicated in fatal poisonings. A few boletes are also highly toxic (though generally not deadly), notably the fairly conspicuous &quot;Boletus satanas&quot; and allies. Still, many mushroom hunters recommend that beginners start with boletes, since deadly mix-ups are far less likely than with agarics.

==Genera &quot;incertae sedis&quot;==
There are several genera classified in the Boletales that are i) poorly known, ii) have not been subjected to DNA analysis, or iii) if analysed phylogenetically do not group with as yet named or identified families, and have not been assigned to a specific family (i.e., &quot;incertae sedis&quot; with respect to familial placement). These include:
*&quot;Corditubera&quot;
*&quot;Corneromyces&quot;
*&quot;Marthanella&quot;
*&quot;Phaeoradulum&quot;

<text>Trixie Smith (c.1885/1895 – September 21, 1943), was an American blues singer and film actress. She made four dozen recordings and appeared in five films.

==Biography==
Born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, Smith came from a middle-class background. Various years are given for her birth including 1885, 1888, and 1895. She attended Selma University, in Alabama, before moving to New York City at the age of twenty around 1915. Soon after, she began working in a number of different cafés and theaters in Harlem and Philadelphia.

She began her career as a vaudeville and minstrel entertainer who performed as a comedian, dancer, actress, and singer in traveling shows. Between 1916 and the early 1920s, she worked in minstrel shows and toured as a featured singer. She performed on Broadway using the name Bessie Lee and recorded for Silvertone. She also worked on the Theater Owners Booking Association vaudeville circuit before making her first recordings for Black Swan Records in 1922, among which was &quot;My Man Rocks Me (With One Steady Roll)&quot; (1922), written by J. Berni Barbour, of historical interest as the first record to refer to &quot;rocking&quot; and &quot;rolling&quot; in a secular context. Her record inspired various lyrical elaborations, such as &quot;Rock That Thing&quot; by Lil Johnson and &quot;Rock Me Mama&quot; by Ikey Robinson.

Also in 1922, billed as the &quot;southern nightingale,&quot; Smith won first place and a silver cup in a blues singing contest in which she sang her own composition, &quot;Trixie&#x27;s Blues&quot;, competing against Alice Leslie Carter, Daisy Martin and Lucille Hegamin, at the Inter-Manhattan Casino in New York, sponsored by the dancer Irene Castle. She is best remembered for &quot;Railroad Blues&quot; (1925), which features one of her most inspired vocal performances on record, and &quot;The World Is Jazz Crazy and So Am I&quot; (1925). Louis Armstrong played the cornet on both songs.

Smith was a polished performer, and her records include several outstanding examples of the blues, on which she is accompanied by artists such as James P. Johnson, and Freddie Keppard. She recorded with Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s Orchestra for Paramount Records in 1924 and 1925. By the late 1930s her formerly girlish voice became more full-bodied, and her performance style more direct and sexual. Later rhythm-and-blues and soul singers would adopt this approach.

As her career as a blues singer waned, she sustained herself mostly by performing in cabaret revues and starring in musical revues such as &quot;New York Revue&quot; (1928) and &quot;Next Door Neighbors&quot; (1928) at the Lincoln Theater in Harlem. She also appeared in Mae West&#x27;s short-lived 1931 Broadway show, &quot;The Constant Sinner.&quot; Two years later, Smith was elevated to the stage of the Theatre Guild for its production of &quot;Louisiana&quot;.

She appeared in five movies: &quot;Birthright&quot; (1938), &quot;God&#x27;s Step Children&quot; (1938), &quot;Swing!&quot; (1938), &quot;Drums o&#x27; Voodoo&quot; (1934), and &quot;The Black King&quot; (1932). Two of these films were directed by Oscar Micheaux. She appeared at the concert &quot;From Spirituals to Swing&quot;, produced by John H. Hammond, in 1938. She recorded seven titles in 1938 and 1939. Most of her later recordings were with Sidney Bechet for Decca Records in 1938. In 1939 she cut &quot;No Good Man&quot; with a band including Red Allen and Barney Bigard.

Known in later life as Trixie Muse, she died in New York in 1943, after a brief illness, at the age of 48.

In 2017, her song &quot;Jack I&#x27;m Mellow&quot; was featured as the theme song for the TV comedy sitcom, &quot;Disjointed&quot;.

<doc id="300920" wikidata="Q330906" url="?curid=300920" title="Concept and object">
<text>In the philosophy of language, the distinction between concept and object is attributable to the German philosopher Gottlob Frege in 1892 (in his paper &quot;Concept and Object&quot;; German: &quot;Über Begriff und Gegenstand&quot;).

==Overview==
According to Frege, any sentence that expresses a singular thought consists of an expression (a proper name or a general term plus the definite article) that signifies an object together with a predicate (the copula &quot;is&quot;, plus a general term accompanied by the indefinite article or an adjective) that signifies a concept. Thus &quot;Socrates is a philosopher&quot; consists of &quot;Socrates&quot;, which signifies the object &quot;Socrates&quot;, and &quot;is a philosopher&quot;, which signifies the concept of &quot;being a philosopher&quot;.

The distinction was of fundamental importance to the development of logic and mathematics. Frege&#x27;s distinction helped to clarify the notions of a set, of the membership relation between element and set, and of empty and infinite sets. However, Frege&#x27;s conception of a class (in his terminology an extension of a concept) differs from the current iterative conception of a set.

Frege&#x27;s distinction leads to the famous difficulty or &quot;awkwardness of language&quot; that some expressions which purport to signify a concept — Frege&#x27;s example is &quot;the concept &quot;horse&quot;&quot; — are grammatically expressions that by his criterion signify an object. Thus &quot;the concept &quot;horse&quot; is not a concept, whereas the city of Berlin is a city.&quot;

Anthony Kenny sought to justify the distinction, other philosophers such as Hartley Slater and Crispin Wright have argued that the distinguished category of &quot;entity&quot; cannot be associated with predication in the way that individual objects are associated with the use of singular terms.

<text>The Christopher Ewart-Biggs Memorial Prize was created in 1977, in memory of Christopher Ewart-Biggs, British Ambassador to Ireland, who was assassinated by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1976.

Founded by his Widow Jane Ewart-Biggs (following her death, the literary prize is currently administered jointly by their 3 children) following the death of her husband, its stated goal is to promote peace and reconciliation in Ireland, a greater understanding between the peoples of the United Kingdom and Ireland, or closer co-operation between partners of the European Community now known as the EU.

It is awarded to a book, a play or a piece of journalism that best fulfills this aim, published during a two-year period up to December 31 of the year preceding the year in which the prize is awarded. The value of the biennially awarded literary prize is currently set at £7,500, an increase on the original £5,000 award of 1977.

==Past winners==
The years of publication/broadcast for which the prize was awarded is given. In earlier years the Prize was identified by the year of award, but the official website now gives year of publication/broadcast.

<text>The Parish ale or church ale is a party or festivity in an English parish at which ale is the chief drink. It is typically a fundraising occasion for the parish that might include music and dancing. Very common in the later Middle Ages, parish ales encountered some opposition after the English Reformation, some have survived into modern times in some form. In 2025, this form of fundraising is planned to take place at the church of St. Helen&#x27;s in Colne. 

==Types==
The word &quot;ale&quot;, in the sense of an ale-drinking party, was part of many compound terms for types of party or festivity based on the consumption of ale or beer. Thus there was the leet-ale (held on &quot;leet&quot;, the manorial court day); the lamb-ale (held at lamb-shearing); the Whitsun-ale (held at Whitsun), the clerk-ale, the church-ale etc. The word &quot;bridal&quot; originally derives from bride-ale, the wedding feast organised to raise money for the couple. The bid-ale, once very common throughout England, was a benefit feast to which a general invitation was given, and all those attending were expected to make some contribution to help the object of the benefit, usually a poor person or family or some other charitable cause. Morris dancing used to be common entertainment at parish ales, and a meeting of Morris dancers today is still called a Morris Ale.

==Significance==
These parish festivals were of much ecclesiastical and social importance in medieval England. The chief purpose of the church-ale (which was originally instituted to honour the church saint) and the clerk-ale, was to facilitate the collection of parish dues and to make a profit for the church from the sale of ale by the church wardens. These profits kept the parish church in repair, or were distributed as alms to the poor.
In the gallery of the tower arch of St Agnes, Cawston in Norfolk is inscribed:
On the beam of a screen in the church of Thorpe-le-Soken, Essex, is the following inscription in raised blackletter on a scroll held by two angels: &quot;This cost is the bachelers made by ales thesn be ther med.&quot; The date is about 1480.

==Description==
The feast was usually held in a barn near the church or in the churchyard. In Tudor times church-ales were held on Sundays; gradually the parish-ales were limited to the Whitsun season, and these still have local survivals. The colleges of the universities used to brew their own ales and hold festivals known as college-ales; some of these ales are still brewed and famous, like &quot;chancellor&quot; at Queen&#x27;s College, and &quot;archdeacon&quot; at Merton College, Oxford, and &quot;audit ale&quot; at Trinity, Cambridge.

A short piece printed in the &quot;Manchester Times&quot; in 1870 quoted from &quot;Jefferson&#x27;s Book about the Clergy&quot;:

Of the Church-ale, often called the Whitsun-ale, from being generally held at Whitsuntide, it is necessary to speak at greater length, for it is a far more important institution than the bid-ale or clerk-ale. The ordinary official givers of the church-ale were two wardens who, after collecting subscriptions in money or kind from every one of their fairly well-to-do parishioners, provided a revel that not infrequently passed the wake in costliness and diversity of amusements. The board, at which everyone received a welcome who could pay for his entertainment, was loaded with good cheer; and after the feasters had eaten and drunk to contentment, if not to excess, they took part in sport on the turf of the churchyard, or on the sward of the village green. The athletes of the parish distinguished themselves in wrestling, boxing, quoit throwing; the children cheered the mummers and the morris dancers; and round a maypole decorated with ribbons, the lads and lasses plied their nimble feet to the music of the fifes, bagpipes, drums and fiddles. When they had wearied themselves by exercise, the revellers returned to the replenished board; and not seldom the feast, designed to begin and end in a day, was protracted into a demoralising debauch of a week&#x27;s or even a month&#x27;s duration.

<text>Samuel Purchas ( – 1626) was an English Anglican cleric who published several volumes of reports by travellers to foreign countries.

== Career ==
Purchas was born at Thaxted, Essex, son of a yeoman. He graduated from St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1600. In 1604 James I presented him to the vicarage of St. Laurence and All Saints, in Eastwood, Essex.

Eastwood is two miles from Leigh-on-Sea, which was then a prosperous shipping centre and a congregational place of seafaring men. Purchas himself never travelled &quot;200 miles from Thaxted in Essex where I was borne.&quot; Instead, he recorded personal narratives shared with him by sailors who returned to England from their voyages. He added these accounts to a vast compilation of unsorted manuscripts that were left to him by Richard Hakluyt, which were later published as Purchas&#x27;s third – and final – book.

In 1614, Purchas became chaplain to Archbishop George Abbot and rector of St Martin, Ludgate, London. He held a Bachelor of Divinity degree, and with this degree was admitted at Oxford University in 1615.

In 1614 he published &quot;Purchas His Pilgrimage: or Relations of the World and the Religions observed in all Ages and Places discovered, from the Creation unto this Present.&quot; In this work, intended as an overview of the diversity of God&#x27;s creation from an Anglican world-view, he presented several abbreviated travel stories he would later publish in full.
The book achieved immediate popularity and went through four editions between 1613 and 1626, the year of Purchas&#x27;s death.

His second book, &quot;Purchas his Pilgrim or Microcosmus, or the Historie of Man. Relating the Wonders of his Generation, Vanities in his Degeneration, Necessities of his Regenerations,&quot; was published in 1619.

In 1625 Purchas published &quot;Hakluytus Posthumus, or Purchas his Pilgrimes&quot;, a massive four-volume collection of travel stories that can be seen as a continuation of Richard Hakluyt&#x27;s &quot;Principal Navigations&quot; and was partly based on manuscripts left by Hakluyt, who had died in 1616. Although the work is not methodically organized, it may be thematically divided into four volumes:

* Volume I explores ancient kings, beginning with Solomon, and records stories of circumnavigation around the African coast to the East Indies, China, and Japan.
* Volume II is dedicated to Africa, Palestine, Persia, and Arabia. 
* Volume III provides history of the North-East and North-West passages and summaries of travels to Tartary, Russia, and China.
* Volume IV deals with America and the West Indies.

The fourth edition of the &quot;Pilgrimage&quot; (published in 1626) is usually catalogued as the fifth volume of the &quot;Pilgrimes&quot;, but the two works are essentially distinct. Purchas himself said of the two volumes:

&quot;These brethren, holding much resemblance in name, nature and feature, yet differ in both the object and the subject. This [i.e. the Pilgrimage] being mine own in matter, though borrowed, and in form of words and method; whereas my Pilgrimes are the authors themselves. acting their own parts in their own words, only furnished by me with such necessities as that stage further required, and ordered according to my rules.&quot;

Purchas died in September or October 1626, according to some in a debtors&#x27; prison, nearly ruined by the expenses of his encyclopedic labor. Others believe the patronage of Dr. King, Bishop of London, which provided him with the Rectory of St Martin, Ludgate, and made him Chaplain to the Archbishop of Canterbury, relieved him from his financial troubles. In addition, his move to London allowed Purchas to expand his research. None of his works was reprinted till the Glasgow reissue of the &quot;Pilgrimes&quot; in 1905–1907.

As an editor and compiler Purchas was often injudicious, careless and even unfaithful; but his collections contain much of value and are frequently the only sources of information upon important questions affecting the history of exploration.

His editorial decisions as well as the commentary he added can be understood from his basic goal: to edify and educate the reader about the world, foreign culture, and morality. This should be contrasted with Hakluyt&#x27;s goal of inspiring and interesting the nation in pursuing the project of exploration.

&quot;Purchas his Pilgrimes&quot; became one of the sources of inspiration for the poem &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. As a note to Coleridge&#x27;s poem explains, &quot;In the summer of the year 1797, the Author, then in ill health, had retired to a lonely farm-house between Porlock and Linton, on the Exmoor confines of Somerset and Devonshire. In consequence of a slight indisposition, an anodyne had been prescribed, from the effects of which he fell asleep in his chair at the moment that he was reading the following sentence, or words of the same substance, in Purchas&#x27;s Pilgrimes: &quot;In Xaindu did Cublai Can build a stately palace, encompassing sixteen miles of plaine ground with a wall, wherein are fertile meddowes, pleasant springs, delightful streams, and all sorts of beasts of chase and game, and in the middest thereof a sumptuous house of pleasure.&quot;

<text>The spore print is the powdery deposit obtained by allowing spores of a fungal fruit body to fall onto a surface underneath. It is an important diagnostic character in most handbooks for identifying mushrooms. It shows the colour of the mushroom spores if viewed en masse.

==Method==

A spore print is made by placing the spore-producing surface flat on a sheet of dark and white paper or on a sheet of clear, stiff plastic, which facilitates moving the spore print to a darker or lighter surface for improved contrast; for example, it is easier to determine whether the spore print is pure white or, rather, very slightly pigmented. The mushroom is left for several hours, often overnight, in this manner. Some guides advise using a moisture-resistant enclosure, like a glass or jar, to contain the mushroom during printing. If the mushroom is to be preserved, a small hole can be made in the spore print paper rather than cutting the stipe. When the mushroom is removed, the colour of the spores should be visible. Mycologists often use glass slides, which allow for quick examination of spores under a microscope. A mushroom cannot be identified from its spore print alone; the spore print is only one characteristic used in making a taxonomic determination. Spore prints are usually white to cream, black, or shades of red, purple, or brown. The poisonous false parasol (&quot;Chlorophyllum molybdites&quot;) has a green spore deposit. Although the spore print is generally used to help identify the genus of a specimen, on occasion it can be used to help distinguish between similar species. For example, the lookalikes &quot;Russula crustosa&quot; and &quot;Russula virescens&quot; have yellowish and white spore deposits, respectively.

In the field, spore print colour can sometimes be quickly determined by examining the top of stipes for spore &quot;dust&quot; on the nearby forest floor.

Collecting and examination of a spore print is not always successful. Some mushrooms are too young or too old to produce spores. Mushrooms collected at high elevations will typically not produce a spore print at lower elevations. Sometimes, the colour can vary depending on the thickness of the spore print. In the genus &quot;Lactarius&quot;, for example, thin deposits are usually white, while thick deposits are cream to yellow. Many of the original authors of species guides in this genus did not indicate whether spore print colours they recorded were with thick or thin prints, limiting the usefulness of this feature as an identification characteristic. In some instances, the colour of the spore print matches that of the mature gills, but this is not always true and gill colour cannot reliably be used as an indicator of spore print colour.

The North American Mycological Association (NAMA) created a &#x27;how-to guide&#x27; for people interested in creating their own spore prints.

==Importance==

Historically the classification of many families of fungi were based on spore colour, a feature first systematically emphasized by Swedish mycologist Elias Fries. An example is the Tricholomataceae, a large family containing many fungi whose common factor was having white spores. However recent molecular research has shown some strange relationships, with some fungi of disparate spore colours showing close relations.

<doc id="300930" wikidata="Q238744" url="?curid=300930" title="Peter of Verona">
<text>Peter of Verona (1205 – April 6, 1252), also known as Saint Peter Martyr and Saint Peter of Verona, was a 13th-century Italian Catholic priest. He was a Dominican friar and a celebrated preacher. He served as Inquisitor in Lombardy, was killed by an assassin, and was canonized as a Catholic saint 11 months after his death, making this the fastest canonization in history.

==Biography==
Thomas Agni of Leontino, Dominican archbishop of Cosenza, and later patriarch of Jerusalem, was the first to write a biography of Peter of Verona. He lived for many years with Peter of Verona and had been his superior.

Peter was born in the city of Verona into a family perhaps sympathetic to the Cathar heresy. Peter went to a Catholic school, and later to the University of Bologna, where he is said to have maintained his orthodoxy and, at the age of fifteen, met Dominic of Osma. Peter joined the Order of the Friars Preachers (Dominicans) and became a celebrated preacher throughout northern and central Italy.

From the 1230s on, Peter preached against heresy, and especially Catharism, which had many adherents in thirteenth-century Northern Italy. Pope Gregory IX appointed him General Inquisitor for northern Italy in 1234 and Peter evangelized nearly the whole of Italy, preaching in Rome, Florence, Bologna, Genoa, and Como. He is credited with founding, around 1240, the Venerabile Arciconfraternita della Misericordia di Firenze.

In 1243 he recommended the new Servite foundation to the pope for approval. In 1245, he led two battles against Cathars in Florence in which he was victorious. In 1251, Pope Innocent IV recognized Peter&#x27;s virtues (severity of life and doctrine, talent for preaching, and zeal for the orthodox Catholic faith), and appointed him Inquisitor in Lombardy. He spent about six months in that office and it is unclear whether he was ever involved in any trials. His one recorded act was a declaration of clemency for those confessing heresy or sympathy to heresy.

In his sermons he denounced heresy and also those Catholics who professed the Faith by words, but acted contrary to it in deeds. Crowds came to meet him and followed him; conversions were numerous, including many Cathars who returned to the Catholic church.

Because of this, a group of Milanese Cathars conspired to kill him. They hired an assassin, Carino of Balsamo. Carino&#x27;s accomplice was Manfredo Clitoro of Giussano. On April 6, 1252, when Peter was returning from Como to Milan, the two assassins followed Peter to a lonely spot near Barlassina, and there killed him and mortally wounded his companion, a fellow friar named Domenico.

Carino struck Peter&#x27;s head with an axe and then attacked Domenico. Peter rose to his knees, and recited the first article of the Apostles&#x27; Creed. Offering his blood as a sacrifice to God, according to legend, he dipped his fingers in it and wrote on the ground: &quot;Credo in Deum&quot;, the first words of the creed. The blow that killed him cut off the top of his head, but the testimony given at the inquest into his death confirms that he began reciting the Creed when he was attacked.

Domenico was carried to Meda, where he died five days afterwards.
==Legends==
According to Dominican tradition Peter often conversed with the saints, including the virgin martyrs Catherine, Agnes and Cecilia.

Once, when preaching to a vast crowd under the burning sun, the heretics challenged him to procure shade for his listeners. As he prayed, a cloud overshadowed the audience.

==Veneration==
Peter&#x27;s body was carried to Milan and laid in the Church of Sant&#x27;Eustorgio, where an ornate mausoleum, the work of Balduccio Pisano, was erected to his memory. Since the eighteenth century this has been located in the Portinari Chapel.

Many miracles were attributed to him while alive, and even more after his martyrdom.

Peter was canonized by Pope Innocent IV on March 9, 1253, the fastest canonization in papal history. St Peter the Martyr&#x27;s feast day is 6 April although his Dominican brothers celebrate it on 4 June. From 1586, when the feast day was inserted in the General Roman Calendar, to 1969, when it was removed on the grounds of the limited importance now attached to the saint internationally, the celebration was on 29 April. (6 April, his death date, was not used because it would too often conflict with the Easter Triduum.) The Church of Santa Maria Antiqua in Verona is co-entitled to him.

Carino, the assassin, later repented and confessed his crime. He converted to the Catholic church and eventually became a lay brother in the Dominican convent of Forlì. He is the subject of a local cult as Blessed Carino of Balsamo.

The sculptures on the great door of S. Anastasia, the Dominican Church in Verona, represent scenes from the life of St. Peter Martyr.

<text>Ida M. Cox ( Prather; February 26, 1888 or 1896 – November 10, 1967) was an American singer and vaudeville performer, best known for her blues performances and recordings. She was billed as &quot;The Uncrowned Queen of the Blues&quot;.

==Childhood and early career==
Cox was born Ida M. Prather, the daughter of Lamax and Susie ( Knight) Prather in Toccoa, then Habersham County, Georgia, and grew up in Cedartown, Polk County, Georgia. Many sources give her birth date as February 26, 1896, but the researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc have suggested she was born in 1888, and noted other evidence suggesting 1894. Her family lived and worked in the shadow of the Riverside Plantation, the private residence of the wealthy Prather family, from which her namesake came. She faced a future of poverty and few educational and employment opportunities.

Cox joined the local African Methodist Choir at an early age and developed an interest in gospel music and performance. At the age of 14, she left home to tour with White and Clark&#x27;s Black &amp; Tan Minstrels. She began her career on stage by playing Topsy, a &quot;pickaninny&quot; role commonly performed in vaudeville shows of the time, often in blackface. Cox&#x27;s early experience with touring troupes included stints with other African-American travelling minstrel shows on the Theater Owners Booking Association vaudeville circuit: the Florida Orange Blossom Minstrels, the &quot;Silas Green Show&quot;, and the Rabbit Foot Minstrels.

The Rabbit Foot Minstrels, organized by F. S. Wolcott and based after 1918 in Port Gibson, Mississippi, were important not only for the development of Cox&#x27;s performing career but also for launching the careers of her idols Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith. 

Known colloquially as the Foots, the troupe provided a nurturing environment in which Cox developed her stage presence, but life on the vaudeville circuit was trying for performers and workers alike. Paul Oliver wrote, in &quot;The Story of the Blues&quot;, &quot;The &#x27;Foots&#x27; travelled in two cars and had an 80&#x27; x 110&#x27; tent which was raised by the roustabouts and canvassmen while a brass band would parade in town to advertise the coming of the show...The stage would be of boards on a folding frame and Coleman lanterns – gasoline mantle lamps – acted as footlights. There were no microphones; the weaker voiced singers used a megaphone, but most of the featured women blues singers scorned such aids to volume.&quot; When she was not singing, Cox performed as a sharp-witted comedian in vaudeville shows, gaining stage experience and cultivating her stage presence.

==Personal life==
By 1908 (though some sources suggest 1916), she had married Adler Cox, who performed as a trumpeter with the Florida Orange Blossom Minstrels, a group with which she briefly toured. Their marriage was cut short by his death in World War I. She kept his surname for the rest of her performing career. In the early 1920s, she married Eugene Williams and gave birth to a daughter, Helen. Few other details are known of this marriage, which ended in divorce.

In 1927, she married Jesse &quot;Tiny&quot; Crump, a blues piano accompanist active on the Theater Owners Booking Association vaudeville circuit. Crump collaborated with her in the composition of many songs, including &quot;Gypsy Glass Blues&quot; and &quot;Death Letter Blues&quot;, provided piano and organ accompaniment on several of her recordings, and served as manager of her blossoming career In the following years.

==Gaining popularity==
By 1915, Cox had advanced from the &quot;pickaninny&quot; roles of her early minstrel years to singing the blues almost exclusively. In 1920, she left the vaudeville circuit briefly to appear as a headline act at the 81 Theatre in Atlanta, with the pianist Jelly Roll Morton. Her commanding stage presence and expressive delivery earned Cox star billing, and by the early 1920s, she was regarded as one of the finest solo acts offered by the shows that travelled the Theater Owners Booking Association circuit. In March 1922, a performance by Cox at the Beale Street Palace, in Memphis, Tennessee, was aired on radio station WMC with positive reviews, leading to exposure to a wider audience.

==Recording career==
After the success of Mamie Smith&#x27;s 1920 recording of &quot;Crazy Blues&quot;, record companies became aware of a demand for recordings of race music. The classic female blues era had begun and would extend through the 1920s. With her popularity in the South rapidly increasing, Cox caught the attention of talent scouts and secured a contract with Paramount Records, the same company for which her idol Ma Rainey recorded. Paramount called her &quot;The Uncrowned Queen of Blues&quot;. Between September 1923 and October 1929, she recorded 78 titles for Paramount. For her numerous recording sessions, Paramount provided Cox with outstanding backup musicians, including the pianist Lovie Austin and her band, the Blues Serenaders, featuring Jimmy O&#x27;Bryant (clarinet) and Tommy Ladnier (cornet). She also recorded two sides backed by the Pruitt Twins. During this period, Cox also recorded songs for other labels, including Broadway and Silvertone, using the pseudonyms Kate Lewis, Velma Bradley, Julia Powers, and Jane Smith.

==&quot;Raisin&#x27; Cain&quot;==
In 1929, Cox and Crump formed their tent show revue, &quot;Raisin&#x27; Cain&quot; (after the biblical story of Cain and Abel and the resulting colloquialism). Cox performed as the title act, and Crump served as both accompanist and manager. Through the end of the 1920s and into the early 1930s, &quot;Raisin&#x27; Cain&quot; toured black theaters across the Southeast and westward through Texas, with shows in Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, Texas, Missouri, and Oklahoma, and performed several times in Chicago. The show had sixteen chorus girls, comics, and backup singers. The &quot;Raisin&#x27; Cain&quot; tent show proved so popular that in 1929 it became the first show associated with the Theater Owners Booking Association circuit to open at the famed Apollo Theater, in Harlem, New York. Cox, sometimes billed as the &quot;Sepia Mae West&quot;, headlined touring companies into the 1930s. This was the pinnacle of her performing career.

By the end of the decade, the economic hardships of the Great Depression and the waning popularity of female blues singers made it difficult to maintain performances of the show, with frequent layoffs and gaps in its touring schedule. Cox continued her performing career through the 1930s. In 1935, she and Crump reorganized &quot;Raisin&#x27; Cain&quot;, which by then had been renamed &quot;Darktown Scandals&quot;, and continued to tour the South and Midwest until 1939. In the early 1930s drummer Earl Palmer entered show business as a tap dancer in Cox&#x27;s &quot;Darktown Scandals&quot; revue.

==Later career and comeback==
In 1939, she was invited to participate in the Carnegie Hall concert series &quot;From Spirituals to Swing&quot; produced by John Hammond in which she sang &quot; &quot;&#x27;Fore Day Creep&quot;&quot; with James P. Johnson (piano), Lester Young (tenor saxophone), Buck Clayton (trumpet), and Dicky Wells (trombone). It gave her performing career a boost after the Depression. Cox recorded for Vocalion in 1939 and Okeh in 1940 with bands that included Charlie Christian, Hot Lips Page, Red Allen, J. C. Higginbotham, Lionel Hampton. She continued to perform until 1945, when she was forced into retirement after a debilitating stroke which occurred during a performance at a nightclub in Buffalo, New York. She moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, where she lived with her daughter, Helen Goode, and became active in her church.

Cox effectively disappeared from the music world until 1959 when John Hammond placed an ad in &quot;Variety&quot; magazine in search of her. After locating her, Hammond and the record producer Chris Albertson urged her to make another recording, and in 1961, 15 years after her last sessions, she recorded the album &quot;Blues for Rampart Street&quot; for Riverside with Roy Eldridge, Coleman Hawkins, Sammy Price, Milt Hinton, and Jo Jones. The album contained songs from her repertoire, including &quot;Wild Women Don&#x27;t Have the Blues&quot;, which found a new audience, including the singers Nancy Harrow and Barbara Dane, who recorded their own versions of the song. A review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that Cox at the age of 65 had lost quality in range and intonation but retained her charismatic and expressive delivery.

Cox referred to the album as her &quot;final statement&quot;. After recording it, she returned to Knoxville to live with her daughter. She had another stroke in 1965. In 1967, she entered East Tennessee Baptist Hospital, where she died of cancer on November 10, 1967.

==Singing style==
Consistent with her early career, Cox&#x27;s style leaned more toward vaudeville than blues. She had a less powerful and less rugged voice than her better-known contemporaries Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey, but she held her audiences spellbound with the fiery spirit of her delivery. At the height of the classic female blues era, competition was stiff, with numerous talented blueswomen performing, and Cox&#x27;s singing was only part of her act. Nevertheless, as her career developed, she assumed and embodied the title bestowed on her, &quot;The Uncrowned Queen of the Blues&quot;. Onstage, she exuded a glamorous sophistication and confidence that captivated her fans. She also embellished her stage presence with a stylish wardrobe, which often included a tiara, cape and rhinestone wand.

==Independent spirit==
The independent spirit that governed Cox&#x27;s life and career was a characteristic shared by many early blues stars, including Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, Sippie Wallace, and Victoria Spivey. Forced to exercise independence from an early age as a result of her teenage career in the minstrel circuits, Cox proved herself as an independent and astute businesswoman through her ability to organize and maintain her own troupe, &quot;Raisin&#x27; Cain&quot;, which lasted for a decade. She broke barriers in this regard, as virtually no black women owned and managed their own businesses in the 1920s and 1930s. She was one of the few female blues singers of the time to write her own songs.

Through her raw and sharp lyricism, Cox in her songs described the complex social realities of poor and working class African Americans in the early twentieth century. Her songs address topics of female independence, sexual liberation, and the social and political struggles of black Americans from a decidedly female perspective that became her trademark. One of Cox&#x27;s most famous and enduring songs, &quot;Wild Women Don&#x27;t Have the Blues&quot;, is remembered as one of the earliest feminist anthems:

I&#x27;ve got a disposition and a way of my own,When my man starts to kicking I let him find a new home,I get full of good liquor, walk the street all nightGo home and put my man out if he don&#x27;t act rightWild women don&#x27;t worry,Wild women don&#x27;t have the blues.

<doc id="300935" wikidata="Q620361" url="?curid=300935" title="Sodium–potassium alloy">
<text>Sodium–potassium alloy, colloquially called NaK (commonly pronounced ), is an alloy of the alkali metals sodium (Na, atomic number 11) and potassium (K, atomic number 19) that is normally liquid at room temperature. Various commercial grades are available. NaK is highly reactive with water (like its constituent elements) and may catch fire when exposed to air, so must be handled with special precautions.

== Properties ==
=== Physical properties ===
NaK containing 40% to 90% potassium by mass is liquid at room temperature. The eutectic mixture consists of 77% potassium and 23% sodium by mass (NaK-77), and it is a liquid from , and has a density of 0.866 g/cm3 at and 0.855 g/cm3 at , making it less dense than water. It is highly reactive with water and is stored usually under hexane or other hydrocarbons, or under an inert gas (usually dry nitrogen or argon) if high purity and low levels of oxidation are required.

A solid compound, , exists at low temperatures, containing 46 percent potassium by mass.

NaK has a very high surface tension, which makes large amounts of it pull into a bun-like shape. Its specific heat capacity is 982 J/(kg⋅K), which is roughly one quarter of that for water, but heat transfer is higher over a temperature gradient due to higher thermal conductivity.

=== Chemical properties ===
When stored in air, it forms a yellow potassium superoxide coating and may ignite. This superoxide reacts explosively with water and organics. NaK is not dense enough to sink in most hydrocarbons, but will sink in lighter mineral oil. It is unsafe to store in this manner if the superoxide has formed. A large explosion took place at the Oak Ridge Y-12 facility on December 8, 1999, when NaK cleaned up after an accidental spill and inappropriately treated with mineral oil was scratched with a metal tool. The liquid alloy also attacks PTFE (&quot;Teflon&quot;). Sodium–potassium alloy polymerizes dimethyldichlorosilane into polysilanes with a Si-Si backbone and methyl radicals, primarily dodecamethylcyclohexasilane.

=== Further alloys with low melting points ===
Further alloys with low melting points are at , at and at . The alloy consisting of 40.8 % caesium, 11.8 % sodium and 47.4 % potassium has a melting point of .

== Usage ==

=== Coolant ===
NaK has been used as the coolant in experimental fast neutron nuclear reactors. Unlike commercial plants, these are frequently shut down and defuelled. Use of lead or pure sodium, the other materials used in practical reactors, would require continual heating to maintain the coolant as a liquid. Use of NaK overcomes this. The Dounreay Fast Reactor is an example.

The first nuclear reactor in space, the United States&#x27; experimental SNAP-10A satellite, used NaK as coolant. The NaK was circulated through the core and thermoelectric converters by a liquid metal direct current conduction-type pump. The satellite was launched in 1965, and as of 2022 is the only fission reactor power system launched into space by the United States.

The Soviet RORSAT radar satellites were powered by a BES-5 reactor, which was cooled with NaK. In addition to the wide liquid temperature range, NaK has a very low vapor pressure, which is important in the vacuum of space.

An unintended consequence of the usage as a coolant on orbiting satellites has been the creation of additional space debris. NaK coolant has leaked from a number of satellites, including Kosmos 1818 and Kosmos 1867. The coolant self-forms into droplets of sodium–potassium of up to several centimeters in size. These objects are space debris.

The Danamics LMX Superleggera CPU cooler uses NaK to transport heat from the CPU to its cooling fins.

=== Desiccant ===
In contact with water, hydrogen is created. Hence, sodium–potassium alloys are used as desiccants in drying solvents prior to distillation.

=== Hydraulic fluid ===
Eutectic NaK (NaK-77, an alloy of 77% potassium and 23% sodium by mass) can be used as a hydraulic fluid in high-temperature and high-radiation environments, for temperature ranges of . Its bulk modulus at is 2.14 GPa, higher than of a hydraulic oil at room temperature. Its lubricity is poor, so positive-displacement pumps are unsuitable and centrifugal pumps have to be used. Addition of caesium shifts the useful temperature range to . NaK-77 was tested in hydraulic and fluidic systems for the Supersonic Low Altitude Missile. NaK may also be used to transmit forces inside high temperature pressure transducers as an alternative to mercury.

=== Chemical methods ===
NaK can be used as catalyst in some reactions, such as isobutylbenzene, a precursor to ibuprofen.

== Synthesis and production ==
Industrially, NaK is produced in a reactive distillation.

<text>KAMAZ () is a Russian manufacturer of trucks, buses, and engines headquartered in Naberezhnye Chelny. Founded in 1969, the company is known for its cab over trucks. , KAMAZ is the largest truck producer in Russia and the CIS, producing 43,000 trucks a year. Its trucks have won the Dakar Rally a record eighteen times, the most in the truck category by any manufacturer.

==History==


In 1969, the Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the USSR Council of Ministers was approved which envisaged construction of a complex of heavy duty truck production plants. Out of 70 sites investigated as potential locations, Naberezhnye Chelny, then a small town on the Kama River, was chosen. Naberezhnye Chelny is located near two navigable rivers: the Kama River and the Volga River, and has railway connections. These transport links made the site attractive as they could be used to bring in raw materials and facilitate the export of the trucks. The fact that the huge construction company &quot;KamGESenergostroy&quot; existed in the region allowed construction of plant buildings and apartment blocks for prospective KAMAZ employees to be completed.

Workers and engineers, representing more than 70 ethnicities, converged on Naberezhnye Chelny. Over 100,000 personnel were employed at the construction site itself. In its fit-out, the plant was provided with state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment. More than 700 international firms were among equipment vendors for KAMAZ facilities, including Swindell-Dressler, Holcroft, CE-Cast, Ingersoll Rand, Ex-Cello (U.S.A.), Hueller-Hille, Liebherr (West Germany), Morando, Fiat (Italy), Renault (France), Sandvik (Sweden), JCB (U.K.), Komatsu and Hitachi (Japan).

On December 13, 1969, ground was broken and the first bucket of soil was excavated at the construction site of the Kama River Truck Plant which was rated for production of 150,000 heavy duty trucks and 250,000 engines per year. The Complex of Plants on the Kama River sprawled over 57 square km. Facilities had to be constructed for the 100,000 workers at the plant. They were provided with housing, educational facilities, kindergartens and creches, hospitals and clinics, numerous cultural, sporting and recreational centers. KAMAZ was instrumental in transforming the Kama River Area into an industrial and scientific research hub and developing the infrastructure for nearby agricultural areas.

Every year the population of the city grew by another 30-40 thousand or so. Whereas before construction of KAMAZ got underway, 27,000 residents had lived in Naberezhnye Chelny, the current population is over half a million.

In 2016, the company&#x27;s revenue amounted to 121 billion rubles.

As a result of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kamaz is sanctioned by the EU (March 2022), by New Zealand (April 2022), and by Japan (January 2023). In July 2023, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu stated that the supplies of KAMAZ multipurpose vehicles had surged 17.6 times since early 2022.

== Group structure ==
===Owners and management===
The main shareholders of Kamaz are the state corporation Rostec (49.9%), Avtoinvest Limited (23.54%), a Cyprus-registered company, and Daimler Truck (15%). In February 2022, Daimler suspended cooperation with Kamaz due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The main beneficiaries of the Cyprus-based company have never been officially disclosed, however it is alleged that the company can be traced to Sergei Roldugin, a concert cellist and personal friend of Vladimir Putin based on the Panama Papers.

At the same time, a 4% stake in the company is publicly traded on the Moscow Exchange, leading the company to have many minority shareholders (more than 76,000 individuals in 2007).

In early March 2008 the Board of Directors of KAMAZ was elected, which included 15 people, including:

The mayor of the city of Naberezhnye Chelny (April 2010 - Prime Minister of Tatarstan) - Ildar Khalikov,
head of the management Federal Agency for State Property Management (Rosimushchestvo) - Ivan V. Aksenov, and
the Director-General of the &quot;Russian Technologies State Corporation&quot; Sergey Chemezov.

===Subsidiaries===
KAMAZ Publicly Traded Company has more than 110 subsidiaries and affiliates, it owns shares in the authorized capital of more than 50 different companies and businesses. Together they form KAMAZ Group. The group includes:
* Truck Assembly Plant (Naberezhnye Chelny)
* Metallurgical Complex, KAMAZ PTC
*: KAMAZ Foundries (now one of the largest in Russia)
*: KAMAZ Forge
*: KAMAZ Truck Assembly Plant
* KAMAZ Press and Stamping Plant
* Engine Plant, KAMAZ PTC
* Remdiesel (Engine Re-Manufacture Plant)
* KAMAZ Trade and Finance Company JSC
* Neftekamsk Automotive Plant (NEFAZ) - manufactures buses and vehicles on KAMAZ chassis 
* Auto Trailer Plant OJSC (formerly СЗАП (En:SZAP) of Stavropol)
* KAMAZ Technical Service OJSC
* KAMAZ Auto Technology
* RIZ OJSC (formerly of KAMAZinstrumentspetsmash)
* KIP Master OJSC
* KAMAZ-FINANCE
* KAMAZ-CAPITAL KAMAZ R &amp; D Center

The main production facilities of the plant are located in the industrial area of Naberezhnye Chelny. Nefaz buses are produced in Neftekamsk (Bashkortostan).

KAMAZ owns United Automotive Technologies, a Russian holding of auto parts manufacturers.

The company has overseas manufacturing facilities in Vietnam, India, Kazakhstan (KAMAZ-Engineering JSC). Since 2015 Ganja Auto Plant (Azerbaijan) also assembles Kamaz trucks.

In January 2022, the Hungarian Ministry for Innovation and Technology and Kamaz signed an agreement for production of electric cars in Hungary - about 32,000 by 2025 and 320,000 by 2030.

==Competition==
A team, Kamaz Master, which has been active since 1988 has participated as truck category in distinguished rally raid such as Dakar Rally, Silk Way Rally and Africa Eco Race, has brought Kamaz an outstanding fame. Kamaz vehicles have won the truck category of the Dakar Rally 19 times as of 2022.

<doc id="300940" wikidata="Q711666" url="?curid=300940" title="Arthur Symons">
<text>Arthur William Symons (28 February 186522 January 1945) was a British poet, critic, translator and magazine editor.

==Life==
Born in Milford Haven, Wales, to Cornish parents, Symons was educated privately, spending much of his time in France and Italy. In 1884–1886, he edited four of Bernard Quaritch&#x27;s &quot;Shakespeare Quarto Facsimiles&quot;, and in 1888–1889 seven plays of the &quot;&quot;Henry Irving&quot; Shakespeare&quot;. He became a member of the staff of the &quot;Athenaeum&quot; in 1891, and of the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; in 1894, but his major editorial feat was his work with the short-lived &quot;Savoy&quot;.

In 1892, &quot;The Minister&#x27;s Call&quot;, Symons&#x27;s first play, was produced by the Independent Theatre Society – a private club – to avoid censorship by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office.

Symons conducted a long-lasting relationship with a secret lover who has never been identified, commemorated in his book &quot;Amoris Victima&quot;; in 1901 (19 June) he married Rhoda Bowser (1874–1936), an aspiring actress and oldest daughter of a Newcastle-upon-Tyne shipping magnate.

Symons&#x27;s 1897 book &quot;Studies in Two Literatures&quot; was one of his earliest works as a “serious critic” and established lyricism, mysticism, profundity, modernity, and sincerity as the various traits he would consider in his critiques. His work in his 1899 book &quot;The Symbolist Movement in Literature&quot; emphasized the importance of both lyricism and mysticism, with the latter being particularly important to Symons&#x27;s beliefs regarding both poets and symbolists.

In 1902, Symons made a selection from his earlier verse, published as &quot;Poems&quot;. He translated from the Italian of Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio &quot;The Dead City&quot; (1900) and &quot;The Child of Pleasure&quot; (1898), and from the French of Émile Verhaeren &quot;The Dawn&quot; (1898). To &quot;The Poems of Ernest Dowson&quot; (1905) he prefixed an essay on the deceased poet, who was a kind of English Verlaine and had many attractions for Symons.

In early 1908, Symons received news that a translated version of his play &quot;Tristan and Iseult: A Play in Four Acts&quot; (1917) was to be put on in Italy. Symons and his wife decided to tour Europe that autumn. While in Venice, Symons began to become overstimulated and feverish, and soon left his wife behind while travelling between several different hotels around the region. His letters to friends and family started to read vastly different than his previous work. After wandering lost through the countryside for two days, suffering fatigue and symptoms of madness, he was found and arrested by two Italian soldiers and held in prison in Ferrara. His wife soon located him, and within a few months he was transferred from an Italian ward to a doctor&#x27;s care back in England.

After Symons&#x27;s psychotic breakdown, he published very little new work for a period of more than twenty years. His wife Rhoda took over the management of his affairs. His &quot;Confessions: A Study in Pathology&quot; (1930) has a moving description of his breakdown and treatment.

Most of Symons&#x27;s work as a critic was published between 1903 and 1906, with it being included in publications such as &quot;Weekly Critical Review&quot;, the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, and &quot;Outlook&quot;. Symons would later go on to publish his own book titled &quot;Studies on Modern Painters&quot; in 1925 using many of the articles he wrote for &quot;Weekly Critical Review&quot; and &quot;Outlook&quot;.

In 1918, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine published Symons&#x27;s Baudelarian essay, &quot;The Gateway to an Artificial Paradise: The Effects of Hashish and Opium Compared.&quot; On one occasion between 1889 and 1895, John Addington Symonds, Ernest Dowson, and &quot;some of Symons&#x27; lady friends from the ballet all tried hashish during an afternoon tea given by Symons in his rooms at Fountain Court.&quot;

His wife died in Tenterden, Kent, in 1936; Symons died probably in the same house (Island Cottage, Back Street, Kingsgate) in 1945.

== Contributions to literature ==
Arthur Symons is largely credited in contributing to what is best known as symbolism and decadence, though decadent became the term used more often later in his career. His criticisms of French artists spread to the upcoming artists influencing those such as W. B. Yeats and T. S. Eliot. Symons strived to internationalize English literature and culture. Symons translated many international author’s and creator’s works. Italian writer and playwright Gabriele D’Annunzio was Symons&#x27;s main focus on international writers in terms of translations as both authors focused on decadent devices within their works.

Symons contributed poems and essays to &quot;The Yellow Book&quot;. He would later create a collection of short essays added over the period 1899–1919 called &quot;The Symbolist Movement in Literature&quot;. This criticizes authors such as Honoré de Balzac, Prosper Mérimée, and earlier authors like Gérard de Nerval. Though he does not directly state the definition of symbolism in his introduction, it has enough description to be understood as a movement. Symons also created &quot;The Decadent Movement in Literature&quot; which was published in &quot;Harper’s New Monthly Magazine&quot; in November 1893, where he claims decadence is the most representative literature of the day.

=== Critics ===
Symons&#x27;s contemporary Holbrook Jackson stated that Symons&#x27;s &quot;vision of the decadent idea&quot; was clearer in his earlier works than in his later ones, and later Decadent critics focused more on his earlier writings on the subject.

Samuel Chew, another contemporary, considered Symons&#x27;s poetry and the Decadent movement as a whole to be “morbid,” “perverse,” and “unwholesome.”

Symons also appears to have been heavily influenced by art and literature critic Walter Pater, both in his poetry and in his Decadent beliefs.

== Literary themes and devices ==

=== Rootlessness ===
Autobiographical fiction work &quot;Spirited Adventures&quot; (1905)&quot;,&quot; &#x27;A Prelude to life&#x27; (1905) presents Symons in his youth and early adult life. Symons presents his mentality as aimless and destitute, which reflects Symons&#x27;s partialness to the word &#x27;vagabond&#x27; and its wandering, decadent representation within his works and writing style as a critic and writer.

=== Repetition ===
Many of Symons&#x27;s writings recycled themselves and tended to repeat themselves, with small modifications added through each cycle. This repetition caused a need for reassessment with Symons&#x27;s work, especially within his publications as a critic.

=== Eroticism and urban life ===
Symons&#x27;s early poetry focused on capturing urban life&#x27;s mysticism and displaying explicit displays of eroticism, such as &quot;Days and Nights&quot; (1889). His essay on French sculptor Auguste Rodin &quot;Studies in Seven Arts&quot; (1906) emphasized sensuality and eroticism in Rodin&#x27;s work.

<text>K Records is an independent record label in Olympia, Washington, founded in 1982. Artists on the label included early releases by Beck, Modest Mouse and Built to Spill. The record label has been called &quot;key to the development of independent music&quot; since the 1980s.

The label was founded by Beat Happening frontman Calvin Johnson and managed for many years by Candice Pedersen. Many early releases were on the cassette tape format, making the label one of the longest lasting reflections of the cassette culture of the 1970s and early 1980s. Although itself releasing primarily offbeat pop music and indie rock, the DIY label is regarded as one of the pioneers of riot grrrl movement and the second wave of American punk in the 1990s.

==History==
Calvin Johnson founded K Records with the intention of distributing cassette tapes of a local band, The Supreme Cool Beings, which he had recorded performing for his radio show at Evergreen State College radio station KAOS (FM). According to author Gina Arnold, the name &quot;K&quot; originally stood for &quot;knowledge&quot;—as in knowledge of regional underground music scenes and of music in general. Johnson, however, has stated that &quot;it&#x27;s unclear why the name is K.&quot;

K was run from Johnson&#x27;s kitchen in Olympia until January 1986, when he hired Candice Pedersen for $20 a week and academic credit at Evergreen State College. Pedersen became a full partner in 1989 until selling her half of the label to Johnson in 1999. In 2016, Pedersen told &quot;The Stranger&quot; that the separation was on &quot;bad terms,&quot; and that Calvin had reluctantly agreed to a payment plan for her share, to be paid back over 20 years.

The label&#x27;s first vinyl record release was the 1984 Beat Happening 45, &quot;Our Secret / What&#x27;s Important,&quot; but the great bulk of the label&#x27;s early releases were made on the medium of cassette tapes, with &quot;about 20&quot; cassette releases noted in a 1986 &quot;Flipside&quot; interview, in addition to &quot;4 more in the works.&quot;

Johnson noted:

A cassette is great for a local scene like Olympia because a band can release a cassette and not have to spend their would-be savings. If they were to press 500 records, there goes their savings. But if you do a cassette you make up as many as you need, they&#x27;re cheap, and if you don&#x27;t sell them you just use them.

This large group of local cassette-only releases was built into a mail order distribution business, which eventually become a full-time job for Johnson and Pederson. A newsletter was put out in support of the mail order operation, which in 1986 had a circulation of about 2,000. The label also benefited from an early distribution deal with Rough Trade Records in 1985.

K&#x27;s distribution roster expanded as Johnson reached out to independent acts he discovered through his radio show at KAOS-FM. Acts would receive distribution through K newsletters and cassette compilations.

Mariella Luz, a long-standing employee, is currently the general manager. In 2016, several artists on the K roster shared concerns about missed royalties from the label, with The Moldy Peaches singer and solo act Kimya Dawson describing the label as a &quot;broken, sinking ship.&quot; Phil Elverum of the Microphones and Jared Warren of KARP also spoke on the record about late royalty payments and difficulties engaging the label. Johnson said K would liquidate its holdings to make good on its debts to artists, but stated that the label was not in jeopardy.

===International Pop Underground===
In 1987, K Records shifted from cassette distribution to vinyl single production with the launch of the &quot;International Pop Underground&quot; series. During that year, K Records released 10 vinyl singles, which put the label in regular contract with distributors and increasing their interest in K&#x27;s releases. This batch of releases included a new Beat Happening single &quot;Look Around&quot; and the first of the label&#x27;s many Mecca Normal releases.

Over time, the series would include releases from artists including Teenage Fanclub, Mirah, The Microphones, Make-Up, Thee Headcoats, and Built to Spill.

In 1991, K Records organized the week-long International Pop Underground Convention. This event featured more than fifty independent and punk bands, including Bikini Kill, Beat Happening, Fugazi, L7, Unwound, and Jad Fair. It has been called &quot;a remarkable testament of musical self-preservation and fierce resistance to corporate takeover.&quot; The music festival included arts and crafts, film presentations, and poetry readings, and was notable for its deliberate lack of hired security officers.

===Dub Narcotic Studio===

In 1993, Johnson converted a small basement space into a recording studio, which he named Dub Narcotic Studio. The arrangement allowed him to host musicians while recording, and to experiment with studio engineering techniques. Beck recorded &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; for K Records at Dub Narcotic, which became its most financially successful record. Other albums recorded at the studio include early Modest Mouse albums, Johnson&#x27;s eponymous Dub Narcotic Sound System project, and The Halo Benders&#x27; &quot;God Don&#x27;t Make No Junk&quot; album.

The studio was relocated to the former Olympia Knitting Mills building in the late 1990s, and added a 16-track tape machine. The extra space meant the studio could serve as offices for K Records and provide artist and musician housing. Other businesses in the mill included independent musician service companies offering services such as tour booking, promotion, and artist studio space. In 2016, Johnson acknowledged that the studio hadn&#x27;t generated the income he had anticipated for the label.

Then an Evergreen State College student, Phil Elverum of the Microphones recorded his first album, &quot;Tests&quot; (1998), after being given the keys to the studio. Elverum became a fixture of the Dub Narcotic control room. Among albums recorded by Elverum at the studio were the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. The debut record by Arrington de Dionyso, an Evergreen student with an internship at K, was recorded and released on K as Old Time Relijun. Elverum also recorded Mirah Tov Zeitlyn, known as Mirah, at the studio. These acts helped define a new era of the K Records sound, which shifted its emphasis and started producing records known for their experimental production techniques while maintaining their lo-fi authenticity.

==Influence==
===Philosophy===
Though the label was part of the punk and underground scenes of the 1980s, the term has reflected the label&#x27;s philosophy more than the sound of its roster.

Al Larsen of the band Some Velvet Sidewalk was part of the K Roster. In 1989, he wrote an article for the Snipehunt zine which reflected and distinguished K&#x27;s approach to &quot;punk&quot; music with an ethos he called &quot;Love Rock,&quot; in which he wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s a scary world, but we don&#x27;t need to be scared anymore. We need active visionary protest, we need to grab hold and make the transformation, from complaining that there is NO FUTURE to insisting there be a future.&quot; This manifesto, which focused on a DIY ethic, became an unofficial label philosophy.

This philosophy viewed lo-fi, homemade projects as a preferred alternative to corporate culture, which maintained a philosophical link to punk. The first K Records newsletter includes the K shield as a knight, described as battling &quot;the many-armed corporate ogre.&quot;

Some critics have considered this philosophy to be a liability in regards to mainstream success. Author Mark Baumgarten has observed that Pitchfork Media&#x27;s &quot;Top 200 Tracks of the 1990s&quot; included six bands with direct relationships to the label (Bikini Kill, Sleater-Kinney, Fugazi, Built to Spill, Beck, and Nirvana) but only one proper K Records release.

===Twee punk===
Early K releases included childlike, hand-drawn album art. Combined with the stripped-down toy-instrument aesthetic of Beat Happening and distribution of bands such as Heavenly in the US, the label was quickly associated with the twee music scene. Johnson has been called &quot;the first star of American twee.&quot;

Critics have suggested that the &quot;twee&quot; label for K Records acts reflects its rejection of the hardcore punk ethos popular in the 1980s, and that K Records acts were subverting &quot;punk&quot; through confronting and threatening masculine sensibilities within the punk scene.

===Riot Grrl movement===
The Love Rock philosophy also made room for a feminist approach to punk, which had existed in Olympia, WA just as K Records became an established presence in the town. The region&#x27;s early punk acts, such as The Accident and Neo Boys, included women. Women artists such as Lois Maffeo and Stella Marrs were early champions of K Records and appeared on its roster.

Rock critic Michael Azerrad writes that K was &quot;a major force in widening the idea of a punk rocker from a mohawked guy in a motorcycle jacket to a nerdy girl in a cardigan&quot;. That the label was co-owned by a woman reflected an openness to women&#x27;s participation. Pedersen is quoted in Tobi Vail&#x27;s Riot Grrrl zine, Jigsaw, saying &quot;I think it&#x27;s really important that people know there are women ... girls who ... do more than package up things. ... It&#x27;s really important that people to know that there are girls out there making decisions and doing stuff.&quot;

While Pederson was behind the scenes, acts like Mecca Normal, and Heather Lewis&#x27; presence in K&#x27;s flagship band, Beat Happening, have been mentioned as an inspiration for many female-fronted bands at the time.

The label also highlighted women in its International Pop Underground Convention&#x27;s opening night at the Capitol theater, &quot;Love Rock Revolution Girl Style Now&quot;, or &quot;Girls Rock Night&quot;, dedicated to 15 female-led acts such as Bratmobile, Olympia&#x27;s first exclusively-female group, and featuring bands with future members of Sleater-Kinney and Bikini Kill.

Many riot grrrl acts would release through another Olympia label, Kill Rock Stars, which launched with a compilation record at the International Pop Underground Convention. Though Kill Rock Stars would have financial conflicts with K Records over the compilation, Bikini Kill and others moved to Kill Rock Stars out of an aesthetic preference for the &quot;grungier&quot; sound of its releases, and there is no evidence of ill-will. Corin Tucker of Sleater-Kinney has said &quot;It&#x27;s not that we didn&#x27;t love Calvin and love K; it&#x27;s just that this new thing that was starting was going to be so exciting.&quot;

===Partnerships===

====Dischord====
In 1989, Johnson met with Dischord Records head and Fugazi frontman Ian MacKaye, who introduced Johnson to the hardcore R&amp;B band Nation of Ulysses. The two agreed to release their album through a joint venture, DisKord Records, which also released Autoclave&#x27;s 1991 release &quot;Go Far.&quot; This partnership was also responsible for co-tours between Olympia and Washington, DC–based punk acts.

====Kill Rock Stars====
The Kill Rock Stars label, also based in Olympia, had produced exclusively spoken word until Calvin encouraged the label to release a compilation record of local music acts ahead of its International Pop Underground Convention; Calvin provided half of the recordings for the record. With the mainstream success of Nirvana, whose track &quot;Beeswax&quot; was exclusive to the compilation, demand was high enough for K Records to work out a distribution deal with Kill Rock Stars. Collection of the royalties, and distribution of those royalties to Kill Rock Stars, was a matter of disagreement between the labels, and the two ended their working relationship.

===References in pop culture===
* Los Campesinos! cite a &#x27;K Records T-shirt&#x27; in the song &quot;Knee Deep At ATP&quot;, while early single &quot;The International Tweexcore Underground&quot; directly alludes to the label&#x27;s International Pop Underground.
* Nothing Painted Blue released a song &quot;K for Karnival&quot; which is partially a tribute to K Records; it repeats &quot;Who put the shield around the K?&quot; several times, referring to the interstate-style shield around the letter K in the K Records logo.
* Kurt Cobain had the K Records logo guitar sticker on his white Fender Stratocaster and tattoo on his forearm, saying it was to &quot;try and remind me to stay a child.&quot; The song &quot;Lounge Act&quot; on &quot;Nevermind&quot; references his logo tattoo in the line, “I&#x27;ll arrest myself and wear a shield.” Cobain also played guitar on a K Records release, &quot;Bikini Twilight,&quot; with Johnson, released as The Go Team.
* The Hole song &quot;Olympia&quot; (credited as &quot;Rock Star&quot; on &quot;Live Through This&quot;) was changed on a performance on the John Peel show to reference Johnson and K Records.

<text>Bernard Alexander Christian Quaritch ( ; April 23, 1819 – December 17, 1899) was a German-born British bookseller and collector.

The company established by Bernard Quaritch in 1847 lives on in London as Bernard Quaritch Ltd, dealing in rare books and manuscripts, as well as publishing books.

==Early life==
Quaritch was born in Worbis, Germany. After being apprenticed to a bookseller, he went to London in 1842, and was employed by Henry Bohn, the publisher.

==Work in London==

In 1847 he started a bookseller&#x27;s business off Leicester Square, becoming naturalized as a British subject. In 1848 he started to issue a monthly &quot;Catalogue of Foreign and English Books&quot;. About 1858 he began to purchase rare books, one of the earliest of such purchases being a copy of the &quot;Mazarin Bible&quot; (usually known as the Gutenberg Bible), and within a period of forty years he possessed six separate copies of this rare and valuable edition.

In 1860 he moved to Piccadilly. In 1873 he published the &quot;Bibliotheca Xylographica, Typographica et Palaeographica&quot;, a remarkable catalogue of early productions of the printing press of all countries. He became a regular buyer at all the principal book-sales of Europe and America, and from time to time published a variety of other catalogues of old books. Amongst these may be mentioned the &quot;Supplemental Catalogue&quot; (1877), and in 1880 an immense catalogue of considerably over 2,000 pages. The last complete catalogue of his stock was published in 1887-88 under the title &quot;General Catalogue of Old Books and Manuscripts&quot;, in seven volumes, increased with subsequent supplements to twelve. All these catalogues are of considerable bibliographical value. By this time Quaritch had developed the largest trade in old books in the world.

Among the books that he published was Edward Fitzgerald&#x27;s translation of Omar Khayyám&#x27;s poetry collection Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. He was also the agent for the publications of the British Museum and the Society of Antiquaries.

He died at Hampstead, London, leaving the business to his son Bernard Alfred Quaritch, who died in 1913. Both father and son are buried together on the western side of Highgate Cemetery. The business survives to this day.

<doc id="300949" wikidata="Q409133" url="?curid=300949" title="Chloroethane">
<text>Chloroethane, commonly known as ethyl chloride, is a chemical compound with chemical formula CH3CH2Cl, once widely used in producing tetraethyllead, a gasoline additive. It is a colorless, flammable gas or refrigerated liquid with a faintly sweet odor.

Ethyl chloride was first synthesized by Basil Valentine by reacting ethanol and hydrochloric acid in 1440. Glauber made it in 1648 by reacting ethanol and zinc chloride.

==Production==
Chloroethane is produced by hydrochlorination of ethylene:
:C2H4 + HCl → C2H5Cl

At various times in the past, chloroethane has also been produced from ethanol and hydrochloric acid, from ethane and chlorine, or from ethanol and phosphorus trichloride, but these routes are no longer economical. Some chloroethane is generated as a byproduct of polyvinyl chloride production.
==Uses==
Chloroethane is an inexpensive ethylating agent. It reacts with aluminium metal to give ethylaluminium sesquichloride, a precursor to polymers and other useful organoaluminium compounds. Chloroethane is used to convert cellulose to ethylcellulose, a thickening agent and binder in paints, cosmetics, and similar products.

Like other chlorinated hydrocarbons, chloroethane has been used as a refrigerant, an aerosol spray propellant, an anesthetic, and a blowing agent for foam packaging. For a time it was used as a promoter chemical in the aluminium chloride catalyzed process to produce ethylbenzene, the precursor for styrene monomer. At present though, it is not widely used in any of these roles.

===Obsolete uses===
Beginning in 1922 and continuing through most of the 20th century, the major use of chloroethane was to produce tetraethyllead (TEL), an anti-knock additive for gasoline. TEL has been or is being phased out in most of the industrialized world, and the demand for chloroethane has fallen sharply. 

===Niche uses===
Chloroethane has a low boiling point, so when applied topically, the heat absorbed by the boiling liquid produces a deep and rapid chill. When sprayed on the skin, this chill has a mild anesthetic effect, which can be useful when removing splinters or incising abscesses in a clinical setting. Chloroethane was standard equipment in casualty wards. It was commonly used to induce general anaesthesia before continuing with di-ethyl ether, which has a much slower uptake. In dentistry, chloroethane is used as one of the means of diagnosing a &#x27;dead tooth&#x27;, i.e., one in which the pulp has died. A small amount of the substance is placed on the suspect tooth using a cotton wad; if the tooth is still alive this should be sensed by the patient as mild discomfort that subsides when the wad is removed.

===Recreational drug===
Chloroethane is a recreational inhalant drug, although it should not be confused with a duster or canned air, which is composed of fluorinated low-weight hydrocarbons such as tetrafluoromethane, chlorodifluoromethane or another similar gas.

In Brazil, it is a major component of a traditional (though illegal) drug taken during Carnaval, known locally as &quot;lança-perfume&quot; (lit. &quot;perfume launcher&quot; or &quot;sprayer&quot;).

Abuse of chloroethane by inhaling the substance from commercial products (e.g., muscle sprays, cleaning solvents) has been reported intermittently. Cerebellar dysfunction is a common clinical feature of toxicity, but brain imaging studies are often unremarkable. Abusers can develop cardiac arrhythmias, some of which can be fatal.

==Safety==

The vapor is flammable and narcotic, which requires care.

Monochloroethane is the least toxic of the chloroethanes. Like other chlorinated hydrocarbons, it is a central nervous system depressant, albeit a less potent one than many similar compounds. People breathing its vapors at less than 1% concentration in air usually experience no symptoms. At concentrations of 3% to 5%, victims usually exhibit symptoms similar to those of alcohol intoxication. Breathing its vapors at &gt;15% concentration is often fatal; most commercially available handheld containers contain 30% per volume of concentrated vapors that naturally disperse in the outside air.

If exposed to concentrations higher than 6% to 8% victims often exhibit shallow breathing, loss of consciousnesses, and depressed heart-rate. They can be roused with physical contact or loud noise. At this point removal from the area of exposure is advised to restore consciousness. The long-term effects of exposure over a period of 4 or more hours will cause side effects similar to alcoholic hang-over with dehydration, dizziness, loss of clear vision and temporary loss of consciousness, which can last an hour or more. If no longer exposed to the gas, a victim will return to normal health quickly. This can be helped with intake of extra fluids, vitamins, and sugars.

Toxic over-exposure starts at 9% to 12% concentrations, the heart rate drops further, the victim may have more shallow breathing or stop all together, they do not respond to any outside stimulation and may begin to involuntarily gasp, belch or vomit, which can lead to aspiration if the victim is not turned on their side. This constitutes a medical emergency and requires prompt action. It is advised to move the victim to clear air and administer forced breathing for them to purge the lungs of the toxic fumes. If the victim recovers quickly enough, hospitalization may not be required, but will require a medical examination to ensure that no organ damage has occurred.

At &gt;12% concentration, the victim&#x27;s heart, lungs and kidneys begin to fail. Immediate CPR followed by medical support measures may be required to prevent fatal kidney, lung and heart failure. Singer Darius Campbell Danesh died of &quot;toxic effects of chloroethane&quot; as well as suffocation.

Studies on the effects of chronic ethyl chloride exposure in animals have given inconsistent results, and no data exists for its long-term effects on humans.

While chloroethane is not classified as carcinogenic to humans specifically, it is still used in medicine as a local anesthetic.

<text>Gabriel Harvey (1545 – 11 February 1631) was an English writer. Harvey was a notable scholar, whose reputation suffered from his quarrel with Thomas Nashe. Henry Morley, writing in the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot; (March 1869), has argued that Harvey&#x27;s Latin works demonstrate that he was distinguished by qualities very different from the pedantry and conceit usually associated with his name.

==Family==
Gabriel Harvey was the eldest son of John Harvey (d.1593), a yeoman farmer and master ropemaker from Saffron Walden, Essex, and his wife, Alice (d.1613). He had two younger brothers, Richard and John (d. July 1592), and a sister, Mercy.

==Education==
Harvey received his early education at the town&#x27;s grammar school, and matriculated at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1566. In 1570 he was elected fellow of Pembroke Hall. Here he formed a friendship with Edmund Spenser, who may have been his pupil.

==Promotion of hexameter verse==
Harvey wished to be &quot;epitaphed as the Inventour of the English Hexameter,&quot; and was a prime mover in a literary clique known as the Areopagus which attempted to impose the Latin rules of quantity on English verse. In a letter to &quot;M. Immerito&quot; (Edmund Spenser) Harvey says that Edward Dyer and Philip Sidney were helping forward &quot;our new famous enterprise for the exchanging of Barbarous and Balductum Rymes with Artificial Verses.&quot; The letter includes a tepid appreciation of Spenser&#x27;s &quot;Faerie Queene&quot; which had been sent to him for his opinion, and he gives examples of English hexameters illustrative of the principles enunciated in the correspondence. The opening lines--&quot;What might I call this Tree? A Laurell? O bonny Laurell Needes to thy bowes will I bow this knee, and vayle my bonetto&quot;—afford a fair sample of the success of Harvey&#x27;s metrical experiments, which were an easy mark for the wit of Thomas Nashe. &quot;He (Harvey) goes twitching and hopping in our language like a man running upon quagmires, up the hill in one syllable, and down the dale in another,&quot; says Nashe in &quot;Strange Newes&quot;, and he mimics him in the mocking couplet:
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;But ah ! what news do you hear of that good Gabriel Huff-Snuff, 
Known to the world for a fool, and clapped in the Fleet for a rhymer?&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;
Harvey influenced Spenser greatly for a short time, and the friendship lasted. Harvey is the &quot;Hobbinoll&quot; of his friend&#x27;s &quot;The Shepheardes Calender&quot;, and into his mouth is put the beautiful song in the fourth eclogue in praise of Eliza. If he was really the author of the verses &quot;To the Learned Shepheard,&quot; signed &quot;Hobynoll&quot; and prefixed to the &quot;Faerie Queene&quot;, he was a good poet spoiled. Harvey&#x27;s genuine friendship for Spenser shows the best side of his character, which appeared uncompromising and quarrelsome to the world in general. In 1573 the bad feeling against him in his college was so strong that there was a delay of three months before the fellows would agree to grant him the necessary grace for his MA degree.

==Career==
He became reader in rhetoric in about 1576, and in 1578, on the occasion of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s visit to Sir Thomas Smith at Audley End House, he was appointed to dispute publicly before her. In the next year he wrote to Spenser complaining of the unauthorized publication of satirical verses of his which were supposed to reflect on high personages, and threatened seriously to injure his career. In 1583 he became junior proctor of Cambridge University, and in 1585 was elected master of Trinity Hall, of which he had been a fellow from 1578, but the appointment appears to have been quashed at court. He was a protégé of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, to whom he introduced Spenser, and this connection may account for his friendship with Sidney. But in spite of patronage, a second application for the mastership of Trinity Hall failed in 1598.

In 1585 he received the degree of D.C.L. from the University of Oxford, and is found practising at the bar in London. Gabriel&#x27;s brother, Richard Harvey, had taken part in the Martin Marprelate controversy, and had given offence to Robert Greene by contemptuous references to him and his fellow wits. Greene retorted by inserting a few lines in the first edition of his &quot;A Quip for an Upstart Courtier&quot; containing scathing remarks on the four Harvey brothers, drawing attention, among other things, to the fact that they were the sons of a ropemaker. In 1599 Archbishop Whitgift made a raid on contemporary satire in general, and among other books the tracts of Harvey and Nashe were destroyed, and it was forbidden to reprint them. Harvey spent the last years of his life in retirement in Saffron Walden, dying there on 7 February 1631.

&quot;The Letter-Book of Gabriel Harvey, AD, 1573–80&quot; (1884, ed. E J L Scott, Camden Society), contains rough drafts of the correspondence between Spenser and Harvey, letters relative to the disputes at Pembroke Hall, and an extraordinary correspondence dealing with the pursuit of his sister Mercy by a young nobleman. A copy of Quintilian (1542), in the British Museum, is extensively annotated by Harvey.

Harvey was also a wordsmith and has been credited with the coining or first use of the word &quot;jovial&quot; (derived from the Latin for &quot;pertaining to Jove or Jupiter&quot;), circa 1590, as well as the words &quot;conscious&quot;, &quot;extensively&quot;, &quot;idiom&quot;, &quot;notoriety&quot; and &quot;rascality&quot;. This claim is supported by the criticism of rival Thomas Nashe, in which Nashe cites Harvey as the creator of the words, announces his dislike of Harvey&#x27;s words, and then predicts Mr. Harvey&#x27;s words will not stand the test of time. Etymologist Robert Hendrickson also cites Harvey&#x27;s hand in creating these words in his book &quot;The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins&quot;.

==Feud with Nashe==
After Robert Greene&#x27;s death Harvey published &quot;Foure Letters and certaine Sonnets&quot; (1592), in which he revealed the miserable details of Greene&#x27;s later years. Nashe settled his personal score with the Harveys, in &quot;Strange Newes&quot; (1593). Harvey rebutted the personal charges made by Nashe in &quot;Pierce&#x27;s supererogation, or a New Prayse of the Old Asse&quot; (1593). In a religious work, &quot;Christs Teares over Jerusalem&quot; (1593) Nashe made a full apology to Harvey, who however resumed the controversy in a &quot;New Letter of Notable Contents&quot; (1593). Harvey probably had not seen Nashe&#x27;s apology in print when he wrote the &quot;New Letter of Notable Contents&quot;, but he knew something along those lines was rumoured. He refused to take reports of Nashe&#x27;s change of heart at face value until he had the proof in black and white:

:&quot;Till a public injury be publicly confessed, and print confuted in print, I am one of St. Thomas&#x27; disciples, not over prest to believe...&quot;

This certainly sounds as if Harvey had simply not seen a copy of &quot;Christs Teares&quot; at the time of writing &quot;New Letter&quot;. Nashe dramatically withdrew his apology in a new edition (1595) of &quot;Christes Teares&quot;. Harvey, he claimed, had hinted at wanting a reconciliation so that Nashe would make a public apology, and as soon as he did so he was made to look a fool for his pains:

:&quot;Impious Gabriel Harvey, the vowed enemy to all vows and protestations, plucking on with a private slavish submission a general public reconciliation, hath with a cunning ambuscado of confiscated idle oaths, welnear betrayed me to infamy eternal (his own proper chair of torment in hell). I can say no more but the devil and he be no men of their words.&quot;

It was nearly two years before Nashe replied to &quot;New Letter&quot;. When hearing that Harvey had boasted of victory, he produced the most biting satire of the series in &quot;Have with You to Saffron-Walden&quot; (1596). Harvey never responded. Later Richard Lichfield of Cambridge attacked Nashe in &quot;The Trimming of Thomas Nashe Gentleman&quot; (1597). He signed his work &quot;by the high-titled patron Don Richardo de Medico campo&quot;, a play on his name (i.e. &quot;leech-field&quot;). This work was formerly attributed to Harvey.

==Editions and commentary==
His complete works were edited by Grosart with a Memorial Introduction for the Huth Library (1884–1885). See also Isaac Disraeli, on &quot;Literary Ridicule,&quot; in &quot;Calamities of Authors&quot; (ed. 1840); Thomas Warton&#x27;s &quot;History of English Poetry&quot; (ed. William Hazlitt, 1871); John Payne Collier&#x27;s &quot;Bibliographical and Critical Account of the Rarest Books in the English Language&quot; (1865), and the &quot;Works of Thomas Nashe&quot;. There is a modern edition of Harvey&#x27;s pamphlets with Thomas Nashe prepared as a PhD thesis by Peter Brynmor Roberts at the University of Cardiff (2010). A number of Harvey&#x27;s annotated books have been digitised as part of the &#x27;Archaeology of Reading in Early Modern Europe&#x27; project.

<text>A bier is a stand on which a corpse, coffin, or casket containing a corpse is placed to lie in state or to be carried to its final disposition.

In Christian burial, the bier is often placed in the centre of the nave with candles surrounding it, and remains in place during the funeral.

The bier is a flat frame, traditionally wooden but sometimes of other materials. In antiquity it was often a wooden board on which the dead were placed, covered with a shroud. In modern times, the corpse is rarely carried on the bier without being first placed in a coffin or casket, though the coffin or casket is sometimes kept open.

A bier is often draped with cloth to lend dignity to the funeral service. The modern funeral industry uses a collapsible aluminium bier on wheels, known as a &quot;church truck&quot; to move the coffin to and from the church or funeral home for services.

Biers are generally smaller than the coffin or casket they support for reasons of appearance. As a result, they are not particularly stable, and can tip over unless well-centered and undisturbed.

The Carmelite Priory at Mdina, Malta, has a colorful bier on display that was used to carry the monks or friars before they were buried without a coffin.
Ancient Egyptians depicted biers used in their embalming practices and to bear royal coffins in the tomb. They were fashioned to resemble the goddess Sekhmet, the fierce lioness who was the protector of the kings, displaying her head, feet, and often, her distinctive tail that in graphics is shown arching over the bier.

<text>, trading as FN Herstal and often referred to as Fabrique Nationale, or simply FN, is a leading firearms manufacturer based in Herstal, Belgium, and former vehicle manufacturer. It was the largest exporter of military small arms in Europe .

FN Herstal is owned by FN Browning Group, which is in turn owned by the regional government of Wallonia. The Herstal Group also owns the Browning Arms Company and the U.S. Repeating Arms Company (Winchester).

FN America is the U.S. subsidiary of FN Herstal, which was formed by the merger of FN&#x27;s previous two American subsidiaries – FN Manufacturing and FNH USA. A United Kingdom-based manufacturing facility, FN UK, is also in operation.
Firearms designed and/or manufactured by FN include the S.A.W. M249, Browning Hi-Power and Five-seven pistols, the FAL, FNC, F2000 and SCAR rifles, the P90 submachine gun, the M2 Browning, MAG, Minimi and the FN Evolys machine guns; all have been commercially successful. FN Herstal&#x27;s firearms are used by the armed forces of over 100 countries.

==History==

FN Herstal originated in the small city of Herstal, near Liège. The &quot;Fabrique Nationale d&#x27;Armes de Guerre&quot; (French for &#x27;National Factory of Weapons of War&#x27;) was established in 1889 to manufacture 150,000 Mauser Model 89 rifles ordered by the Belgian government. FN was co-founded by the major arms makers of the Liège region, with Henri Pieper of &quot;Anciens Etablissements Pieper&quot; being the driving force and the primary shareholder of the new company. In 1897, the company entered into a long-lasting relationship with John Browning, a well-known American firearms designer.

The company was an important manufacturer of motor vehicles in Belgium, a development championed by Alexandre Galopin as managing director. FN cars were produced in Herstal from the early 1900s until 1935. Production of FN motorcycles continued until 1965, and production of trucks until 1970. In 1973, FN changed its name to reflect a diversified product line far beyond just military Small Arms and Firearms manufacturing, adopting the current name of &quot;Fabrique Nationale d&#x27;Herstal&quot;.

One of Fabrique Nationale&#x27;s handguns, a Model 1910 semi-automatic pistol in 9×17mm (.380 ACP) (serial number 19074), was one of four weapons that were taken from the assassins of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, although it is unknown which of the four weapons fired the fatal round.

Browning began the development of the GP35 &quot;High Power&quot; pistol, the GP standing for &quot;Grande Puissance&quot; (French for &quot;high power&quot;), which is well known as the Browning Hi-Power. The weapon was finalized by FN&#x27;s Dieudonné Saive and did not appear until 1935, nearly a decade after Browning&#x27;s death; it remained in production until 2017.

FN Herstal also had an aerospace engines division and became the only aircraft engine manufacturer in Benelux. Established 1949 in Liers, it manufactured parts, and made and assembled complete engines under licence from British, French and US companies. When four European countries, including Belgium, adopted the F-16 fighter in 1977, FN Herstal built an entirely new plant that made parts, assembled and tested the engines for these aircraft. The &quot;FN Division Moteurs&quot; also supplied parts for the Ariane space programme. However, by 1987, FN Herstal had divested itself of these activities, which today are part of the Safran Group.

In 2023 the company posted a profit of 75 million euros on its second-highest ever revenue, of 908 million euros.

On 17 February 2024 FN Herstal launched a venture capital group named FNX with 20 million euro capital.

On 15 June 2024 FN Herstal changed its name to FN Browning Group.

FN Browning Group was interested in January 2025 to purchase Sofisport, which &quot;employs a total of 1,000 people at fifteen active sites in France, Italy, Spain, the UK and Canada. Its subsidiaries, including Nobel Sport, Cheddite and Sofiam, specialize in the manufacture of ammunition and the production of components including powders, shotshell cases and primers.&quot; At the time, the FN Browning Group employed over 3,000 people and had &quot;seven production sites in Belgium, Portugal, Finland, the United States and the United Kingdom&quot;.

FN Browning Group commemorated its 135th anniversary with an exhibition in Liège&#x27;s La Boverie museum from 25 April to 26 July 2025.

==Divisions==
The FN Manufacturing LLC plant in Columbia, South Carolina, is part of the military division of FN. It is primarily responsible for the production of U.S. military weapons, such as M16 rifles, SCARs, M249 light machine guns, M240 machine guns, and M2 machine guns.

<doc id="300972" wikidata="Q923925" url="?curid=300972" title="Malcolm X (1992 film)">
<text>Malcolm X is a 1992 American independent epic biographical drama film about the African-American activist Malcolm X. Directed and co-written by Spike Lee, the film stars Denzel Washington in the title role, alongside Angela Bassett, Albert Hall, Al Freeman Jr., and Delroy Lindo. Lee has a supporting role, while Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale, the Rev. Al Sharpton, and future South African president Nelson Mandela make cameo appearances.

The screenplay, co-credited to Lee and Arnold Perl, is based largely on Alex Haley&#x27;s 1965 book &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot;. Haley had collaborated with Malcolm X on the book beginning in 1963 and completed it after Malcolm X&#x27;s death. The film dramatizes key events in Malcolm X&#x27;s life: his criminal career, his incarceration, his conversion to Islam, his ministry as a member of the Nation of Islam and his later falling out with the organization, his marriage to Betty X, his pilgrimage to Mecca and reevaluation of his views concerning whites, and his assassination in 1965. Defining childhood incidents, including his father&#x27;s death, his mother&#x27;s mental illness, and his experiences with racism are dramatized in flashbacks.

&quot;Malcolm X&quot; was distributed by Warner Bros. and released in the United States on November 18, 1992. The same year, Denzel Washington won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor for his performance. At the 65th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for two Oscars including the Best Actor for Washington and Best Costume Design for Ruth E. Carter. In 2010, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Malcolm Little is raised in a strong household in rural Michigan by his Grenadian mother and African-American father. When Malcolm is a young boy, their house is burnt down and his father, an activist for black rights, is killed by a chapter of the Black Legion. His death is registered as a suicide and the family receives no compensation. Malcolm&#x27;s mother&#x27;s mental state deteriorates and she is admitted to a mental institution. Malcolm and his siblings are put into protective care. Malcolm performs well in school and dreams of being a lawyer, but his teacher discourages it due to his skin color.

In 1944, Malcolm, now a teenager, lives in Boston. One night, he catches the attention of the white Sophia, and the two begin having sex. Malcolm travels to New York City&#x27;s Harlem with Sophia, where he meets &quot;West Indian&quot; Archie, a gangster who runs a local numbers game, at a bar. The two become friends and start co-operating an illegal numbers racket. One night at a club, Malcolm claims to have bet on a winning number; Archie disputes this, denying him a large sum of money. A conflict ensues between the two and Malcolm returns to Boston after an attempt on his life. Malcolm, Sophia, Malcolm&#x27;s friend Shorty, and a woman named Peg decide to perform robberies to earn money.

By 1946, the group has accrued a large amount of money from thievery. However, they are later arrested. The two women are sentenced to two years as first offenders in connection with the robberies, while Malcolm and Shorty are sentenced to 8 to 10 years. While incarcerated, Malcolm meets Baines, a member of the Nation of Islam, who directs him to the teachings of the group&#x27;s leader Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm grows interested in the Muslim religion and lifestyle promoted by the group, and begins to resent white people for mistreating his race. Malcolm is paroled from prison in 1952 after serving six years, and travels to the Nation of Islam&#x27;s headquarters in Chicago. There, he meets Muhammad, who instructs Malcolm to replace his surname &quot;Little&quot; with &quot;X&quot;, which symbolizes his lost African surname that was taken from his ancestors by white slavemasters; he is rechristened as &quot;Malcolm X&quot;.

Malcolm returns to New York City&#x27;s Harlem and begins to preach the Nation&#x27;s message; over time, his speeches draw large crowds of onlookers. Malcolm proposes ideas such as African-American separation from white Americans. In 1958, Malcolm meets nurse Betty Sanders. The two begin dating, quickly marry and become the parents of four daughters. Several years later, Malcolm is now in a high position as the spokesperson of the Nation of Islam. During this time, Malcolm learns that Muhammad had fathered numerous children out of wedlock, contradicting his teachings and Islam.

After President John F. Kennedy is assassinated in November 1963, Malcolm comments that the assassination was the product of the white violence that has been prevalent in America since its founding, comparing the killing to &quot;the chickens coming home to roost.&quot; This statement damages Malcolm&#x27;s reputation and Muhammad suspends him from speaking to the press or at temples for 90 days. In early 1964, Malcolm goes on a pilgrimage to Mecca where he meets Muslims from all races, including white. Malcolm, having lost his faith in the Nation of Islam and also converting to Sunni Islam during his pilgrimage, publicly announces that he is founding the Organization of Afro-American Unity, which teaches tolerance instead of racial separation. He is exiled from the Nation of Islam, and his house is firebombed in early 1965.

On February 21, 1965, Malcolm prepares to speak before a crowd at the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem, but tragically, disciples of the Nation of Islam shoot him several times. One of Malcolm&#x27;s bodyguards shoots one of the shooters, Thomas Hagan, in the leg before a furious crowd beats Hagan, after which he is arrested. Malcolm is transported to a hospital, but is pronounced dead on arrival.

The film concludes with a series of clips showing the aftermath of Malcolm&#x27;s death. Martin Luther King Jr. delivers a eulogy to Malcolm, and Ossie Davis recites a speech at Malcolm&#x27;s funeral. Nelson Mandela delivers a speech to a school, quoting an excerpt from one of Malcolm&#x27;s speeches.

==Cast==

Political activists Bobby Seale and Al Sharpton make cameo appearances as a pair of street preachers. Civil rights attorney William Kunstler appears as the judge who sentences Malcolm and Shorty to prison. Future South African President Nelson Mandela appears as a Soweto school teacher delivering a lecture on X. Spike Lee regular Nicholas Turturro has a minor role as a Boston police officer. Michael Imperioli briefly appears as a news reporter. Film director John Sayles appears as an FBI agent surveilling Malcolm. Washington&#x27;s then-eight-year-old son John David Washington appears as a Harlem elementary school student; John David would later go on to star as the lead of Lee&#x27;s 2018 film &quot;BlacKkKlansman&quot;.

Ossie Davis provides voiceover narration over the film&#x27;s closing sequence, reading the eulogy he had originally performed at the real Malcolm&#x27;s funeral.

==Production==
 &quot;It&#x27;s such a great story, a great American story, and it reflects our society in so many ways. Here&#x27;s a guy who essentially led so many lives. He pulled himself out of the gutter. He went from country boy to hipster and semi-hoodlum. From there he went to prison, where he became a Muslim. Then he was a spiritual leader who evolved into a humanitarian.&quot;— Producer Marvin Worth on his 25-year effort to make a film about the life of Malcolm X. 

Producer Marvin Worth acquired the rights to &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot; in 1967. Worth had met Malcolm X, then called &quot;Detroit Red,&quot; as a teenager selling drugs in New York City. Worth was fifteen at the time, and spending time around jazz clubs in the area. As Worth remembers: &quot;He was selling grass. He was sixteen or seventeen but looked older. He was very witty, a funny guy, and he had this extraordinary charisma. A great dancer and a great dresser. He was very good-looking, very, very tall. Girls always noticed him. He was quite a special guy.&quot;

Early on, the production had difficulties telling the entire story, in part due to unresolved questions surrounding Malcolm X&#x27;s assassination. In 1971, Worth made a well-received documentary &quot;Malcolm X&quot; (1972), which received an Academy Award nomination in that category. The project remained unrealized. However, several major entertainers were attached to it at various times, including Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, and director Sidney Lumet.

===Screenplay===
In 1968, Worth commissioned a screenplay from novelist James Baldwin, who was later joined by Arnold Perl, a screenwriter who had been a victim of McCarthy-era blacklisting. However, the screenplay took longer to develop than anticipated. Perl died in 1971.

Baldwin developed his work on the screenplay into the 1972 book &quot;One Day, When I Was Lost: A Scenario Based on Alex Haley&#x27;s The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot;. In 1976, Baldwin wrote of his experience, &quot;I think that I would rather be horsewhipped, or incarcerated in the forthright bedlam of Bellevue, than repeat the adventure&quot;. Baldwin died in 1987. Several authors attempted drafts, including David Mamet, David Bradley, Charles Fuller and Calder Willingham. Once Spike Lee took over as director, he rewrote the Baldwin-Perl script. Due to the revisions, the Baldwin family asked the producer to take his name off the credits. Thus &quot;Malcolm X&quot; only credits Perl and Lee as the writers and Malcolm X and Alex Haley as the authors of &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot;.

===Production difficulties===
The production was considered controversial long before filming began. The crux of the controversy was Malcolm X&#x27;s denunciation of whites before he undertook his hajj. He was, arguably, not well regarded among white citizens by and large; however, he had risen to become a hero in the African-American community and a symbol of blacks&#x27; struggles, particularly during the presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. In the three years before the movie&#x27;s release, sales of &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot; had increased 300 percent, and four of his books had a nine-fold increase in sales between 1986 and 1991.

Once Warner Bros. agreed to the project, they initially wanted Oscar-nominated Canadian film director Norman Jewison to direct the film. Jewison, director of the seminal civil rights film &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1967), was able to bring Denzel Washington into the project to play Malcolm X. Jewison and Washington previously worked together in &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Story&quot; (1984). A protest erupted over the fact that a white director was slated to make the film. Spike Lee was one of the main voices of criticism; since college, he had considered a film adaptation of &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot; to be a dream project. Lee and others felt that it was appropriate that only a black person should direct &quot;Malcolm X.&quot;

After the public outcry against Jewison, Worth concluded that &quot;it needed a black director at this point. It was insurmountable the other way...There&#x27;s a grave responsibility here.&quot; Jewison left the project, though he noted he gave up the movie not because of the protest, but because he could not reconcile Malcolm&#x27;s private and public lives and was unsatisfied with Charles Fuller&#x27;s script. Lee confirmed Jewison&#x27;s position, stating, &quot;If Norman actually thought he could do it, he would have really fought me. But he bowed out gracefully.&quot; Jewison and Denzel Washington would reunite several years later for &quot;The Hurricane&quot; (1999), in which Washington played imprisoned boxer Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter, who spent nearly twenty years in prison for a murder he claimed he did not commit before his conviction was overturned in 1985.

Spike Lee was soon named the director, and he substantially edited the script. &quot;I&#x27;m directing this movie and I rewrote the script, and I&#x27;m an artist and there&#x27;s just no two ways around it: this film about Malcolm X is going to be my vision of Malcolm X. But it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m sitting atop a mountain saying, &#x27;Screw everyone, this is the Malcolm I see.&#x27; I&#x27;ve done the research, I&#x27;ve talked to the people who were there.&quot; Soon after Spike Lee was announced as the director and before its release, &quot;Malcolm X&quot; received criticism by black nationalists and members of the United Front to Preserve the Legacy of Malcolm X, headed by poet and playwright Amiri Baraka, who were worried about Lee&#x27;s portrayal of Malcolm X. One protest in Harlem drew over 200 people. Some based their opinion on dislike of Lee&#x27;s previous films; others were concerned that he would focus on Malcolm X&#x27;s life before he converted to Islam. Baraka bluntly accused Spike Lee of being a &quot;Buppie&quot;, stating &quot;We will not let Malcolm X&#x27;s life be trashed to make middle-class Negroes sleep easier&quot;, compelling others to write the director and warn him &quot;not to mess up Malcolm&#x27;s life.&quot; Some, including Lee himself, noted the irony that many of the arguments made against him mirrored those made against Jewison.

Although Washington agreed to play Malcolm X while Jewison was scheduled to direct the film, Lee stated he never envisioned any actor other than Washington in the role. The two had previously worked together on &quot;Mo&#x27; Better Blues&quot; (1990), and Lee noted that Washington had &quot;really captured Malcolm&quot; in his Off Broadway performance as him.

===Budget issues===
Spike Lee also encountered difficulty in securing a sufficient budget. Lee told Warners and the bond company that a budget of over US$30 million was necessary; the studio disagreed and offered a lower amount. Following advice from fellow director Francis Ford Coppola, Lee got &quot;the movie company pregnant&quot;: taking the movie far enough along into actual production to attempt to force the studio to increase the budget. The film, initially budgeted at $28 million, climbed to nearly $33 million. Lee contributed $2 million of his own $3 million salary. Completion Bond Company, which assumed financial control in January 1992, refused to approve any more expenditures; in addition, the studio and bond company instructed Lee that the film could be no longer than two hours, fifteen minutes in length. The resulting conflict caused the project to be shut down in post-production.

The film was saved by the financial intervention of prominent black Americans, some of whom appear in the film: Bill Cosby, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Janet Jackson, Prince, Tracy Chapman, and Peggy Cooper Cafritz, founder of the Duke Ellington School of the Arts. Their contributions were made as donations; as Lee noted: &quot;This is not a loan. They are not investing in the film. These are black folks with some money who came to the rescue of the movie. As a result, this film will be my version. Not the bond company&#x27;s version, not Warner Brothers&#x27;. I will do the film the way it ought to be, and it will be over three hours.&quot; The actions of such prominent members of the African American community giving their money helped finish the project as Lee envisioned it.

The dissatisfaction Warners had for how Lee funded the film by completing it through the help of his African American friends later resulted in Warner Bros. blocking out Lee from participating in the development of &quot;Space Jam&quot; (1996), as Lee had approached Joe Pytka about polishing the film&#x27;s script.

===Request for black interviewers===

A month before the film was released, Lee asked that media outlets send black journalists to interview him. The request proved controversial. While it was common practice for celebrities to pick interviewers who were known to be sympathetic to them, it was the first time in many years in which race had been used as a qualification. Lee clarified that he was not barring white interviewers from interviewing him, but that he felt, given the subject matter of the film, that black writers have &quot;more insight about Malcolm than white writers&quot;.

The request was turned down by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, but several others agreed including &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Interview&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; explained they did not give writer approval. The editor of &quot;Premiere&quot; noted that the request created internal discussions that resulted in changes at the magazine: &quot;Had we had a history of putting a lot of black writers on stories about the movie industry we&#x27;d be in a stronger position. But we didn&#x27;t. It was an interesting challenge he laid down. It caused some personnel changes. We&#x27;ve hired a black writer and a black editor&quot;.

===Filming===
Malcolm X&#x27;s widow, Dr. Betty Shabazz, served as a consultant to the film. The Fruit of Islam, the defense arm of the Nation of Islam, provided security for the movie.

When Denzel Washington took the role of Malcolm X in the play, &quot;When the Chickens Come Home to Roost&quot;, which dealt with the relationship between Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad, he admitted he knew little about Malcolm X and had not yet read &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot;. Washington prepared by reading books and articles by and about Malcolm X and went over hours of tape and film footage of speeches. The play opened in 1981 and earned Washington a warm review by Frank Rich, who was at the time the chief theater critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Upon being cast in the film, he interviewed people who knew Malcolm X, among them Betty Shabazz and two of his brothers. Although they had different upbringings, Washington tried to focus on what he had in common with his character: during the making of the movie Washington was close to Malcolm X&#x27;s age when he was assassinated, both men were from large families, both of their fathers were ministers, and both were raised primarily by their mothers.

&quot;Malcolm X&quot; is the first non-documentary, and the first American film, to be given permission to film in Mecca (or within the Haram Sharif). A second unit film crew was hired to film in Mecca because non-Muslims, such as Lee, are not allowed inside the city. Lee fought very hard to get filming in Mecca but Warners initially refused to put up the money for location shooting. New Jersey was considered for filming the Mecca segments. In the end, Lee got money and permission together for filming in Mecca.

In addition to Nelson Mandela, the film featured cameos by Christopher Plummer (as the prison&#x27;s Catholic chaplain), Peter Boyle (as a police officer), William Kunstler (as a judge), as well as activists Al Sharpton and Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale (as street preachers).

The film was made shortly after Mandela&#x27;s 1990 release from prison and during the negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa. Lee explained that he made &quot;the connection between Soweto and Harlem, Nelson and Malcolm, and what Malcolm talked about: pan-Africanism, trying to build these bridges between people of color. He is alive in children in classrooms in Harlem, in classrooms in Soweto.&quot; Mandela ends the film with a quote from Malcolm X himself, with Malcolm in a film clip saying the last four words. The quote goes: &quot;We declare our right on this earth, to be a human being, to be respected as a human being, to be given the rights of a human being, in this society, on this earth, in this day, which we intend to bring into existence &quot;by any means necessary&quot;.&quot;

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 79 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The critics&#x27; consensus states: &quot;Anchored by a powerful performance from Denzel Washington, Spike Lee&#x27;s biopic of the legendary civil rights leader brings his autobiography to life with an epic sweep and a nuanced message.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F
scale.

Critic Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; ranked the film No. 1 on his Top 10 list for 1992 and described the film as &quot;one of the great screen biographies, celebrating the sweep of an American life that bottomed out in prison before its hero reinvented himself.&quot; In 1999, Ebert and director Martin Scorsese, the latter sitting in for Ebert&#x27;s late co-host Gene Siskel, both ranked &quot;Malcolm X&quot; among the ten best films of the 1990s.

===Accolades===
Denzel Washington&#x27;s portrayal was widely praised and he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Washington lost to Al Pacino (for &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;), a decision which Lee criticized, saying &quot;I&#x27;m not the only one who thinks Denzel was robbed on that one.&quot;

<text>Twin Oaks Community is an ecovillage and intentional community of about one hundred people living on in Louisa County, Virginia. It is a member of the Federation of Egalitarian Communities. Founded in 1967, it is one of the longest-enduring and largest secular intentional communities in North America. The community&#x27;s core values are cooperation, egalitarianism, nonviolence, sustainability, and income sharing. About 100 adults and 17 children live in the community.

== Founding ==
The community was founded on a tobacco farm in 1967 by a group of eight individuals with no farming experience that included Kat Kinkade, who wrote two books about the community. The community&#x27;s inspiration was B. F. Skinner&#x27;s novel &quot;Walden Two,&quot; which describes a fictional behaviorist utopia. However, Skinner&#x27;s vision quickly faded from prominence at Twin Oaks, as behaviorist principles were abandoned in favor of egalitarian principles. The community struggled greatly during its first few years, from high member turnover and low member income. According to Kinkade, the community avoided the problems of laziness, freeloading, and lack of structure stereotypically associated with communes by adopting a structured, yet flexible, labor system.

Modified versions of the community&#x27;s organizational structure and labor credit system survive. As in Skinner&#x27;s novel, the original labor credit system utilized &quot;variable&quot; credit hours. Certain jobs were worth more credit hours than others in order to make each job desirable. What the community found once the population reached about 40, is that there was neither universally desirable work, nor undesirable work and the variable credit hour system created incentives that encouraged work. The updated plan uses &quot;standardized&quot; credits; each job in the community is valued equally in credit hours.

== Life as a member ==
Twin Oaks has approximately 100 members. People interested in joining Twin Oaks must attend a scheduled three-week visitor period. During this period, visitors tour the community and attend orientations on various aspects of membership. Unlike most co-housing situations, there is no cost to join the community, nor any rent or ongoing costs associated with living there. Basic necessities—housing, clothing, food, health care—are all provided to members in return for their 38 weekly hours of work. Since 2011, Twin Oaks has consistently had a waiting list, so visitors who are accepted for membership need to wait typically three to nine months before they can join. Before a new member can join, while the community is at its population capacity, a current member needs to drop membership. Historically, Twin Oaks has expanded its housing when it has had a waiting list for a prolonged period by building new residences and expanding the stock of bedrooms available.

A member of Twin Oaks works around 38 hours a week. Some labor is directed toward generating income, and the rest consists of domestic work like gardening/food production, cooking, bike repair, building maintenance, cleaning, and child care. Most Twin Oakers perform a wide variety of tasks each week instead of spending all of their time in one labor area. Members can also choose to work outside of Twin Oaks. The income from this labor may go to the community, although some portion of it can go into a member&#x27;s &quot;vacation earnings&quot;. Excess labor done in a week accumulates as vacation time.

Though live television viewing is prohibited, Twin Oaks&#x27; members have access to the Internet as well as to public computers. Members can also watch movies and tapes of TV programs. People in the community often gather for other recreational activities such as dancing, meditating, discussing literature, staging musicals, and playing board games.

Twin Oaks members are religiously diverse. The membership includes Christians, atheists, pagans, Buddhists, and others. The community hosts pagan handfastings, Equinox parties, and Thanksgiving dinners, and it celebrates June 16, the anniversary of its founding.

Interpersonal relationships are also diverse. Multiple types of gender relationships coexist, including monogamy, celibacy, and polyamory.

Residents live in dormitory-style living quarters spread out across the community. Each member has a private bedroom, but shares public spaces.

Member turnover is no longer as high as it was in the community&#x27;s early years, and many former Twin Oakers live in nearby Charlottesville and Louisa to maintain ties to the community.

The community itself acknowledges that it has yet to create the perfect society; it even provides a guidebook entitled &quot;Not Utopia Yet&quot; to visitors. Those who choose to live at Twin Oaks for several years—including founder Kinkade—sometimes feel &quot;trapped&quot; there. This is because members have little opportunity to build up equity or savings. The BBC Four television series &quot;Utopia: In Search of the Dream&quot;, broadcast on August 15, 2017, devoted an 11-minute segment to Twin Oaks. Members and one former member (the founders&#x27; daughter), interviewed by Professor Richard Clay, expressed concerns about the inability to build savings, and complex interpersonal relationships. Clay observed that 20 percent of the membership turned over annually.

== Community businesses ==
Twin Oaks&#x27; 38-hour work week is divided between domestic and income-producing labor. Twin Oaks operates several community-owned businesses, including Twin Oaks Tofu, Twin Oaks Hammocks, and Twin Oaks Book Indexing. Additionally, members working in the Twin Oaks Seed Farm grow seeds for Southern Exposure Seed Exchange. From these sources, Twin Oaks generates around $600,000 per year. This money pays for community upkeep and goods that cannot be produced on site, and each member receives a monthly stipend for personal use (i.e., to purchase items that the community does not provide). In news segments, Twin Oakers often attribute the longevity of the community to its engagement in capitalism through its tofu and hammocks businesses.
== Supporting the communities movement ==
Twin Oaks has helped establish three sister communities: Acorn Community, about from Twin Oaks, Living Energy Farm, also in Louisa County, Virginia; and East Wind Community in south central Missouri.

Twin Oaks also hosts annual intentional community gatherings cosponsored by the Fellowship for Intentional Community: The Communities Conference, and the Women&#x27;s Gathering, both of which take place every August.

== Media coverage ==

The history of Twin Oaks Community is detailed extensively in two books by Kathleen (Kat) Kinkade, one of the co-founders of the community. The first, &quot;A Walden Two Experiment&quot;, covers the first five years of the community. The second, &quot;Is it Utopia Yet?&quot;, covers the next 20 years. Another book from the 1980s, &quot;Living the Dream&quot;, by Ingrid Komar (the mother of a member at the time the book was written), also discusses Twin Oaks&#x27; history. About half a dozen dissertations and a dozen master&#x27;s theses have been written about the community, as well. In 1998, the &quot;Washington Post Magazine&quot; did a cover story on Twin Oaks. A 21st century book, &quot;Surviving the Dream&quot;, by Craig Kurtz (a member from 2007 to 2020), analyzes Twin Oaks&#x27; political structure.

==Ecology ==

Twin Oaks seeks to be a model of sustainability. The average Twin Oaks member consumes fewer resources than the average American due to the community&#x27;s practices of resource sharing and self-sufficiency. Members hold all resources in common except for the personal items they keep in their bedrooms. For instance, members share housing, a fleet of 17 vehicles, and a large &quot;clothing library&quot;. Twin Oaks members consume 70% less gasoline, 80% less electricity, and 76% less natural gas per capita than do their neighbors.

<text>Thutmose (; also rendered Thutmoses, Thutmosis, Tuthmose, Tutmosis, Thothmes, Tuthmosis, Thutmes, Dhutmose, Djhutmose, Djehutymes, etc.) is an anglicization of the ancient Egyptian personal name &quot;dhwty-ms&quot;, usually translated as &quot;Born of the god Thoth&quot;.

Thoutmôsis (in Ancient Greek Θούθμωσις / Thoúthmôsis) is the Hellenized form of the Egyptian Ḏḥwtj-mś (reconstructed pronunciation: /tʼaˈħawtij ˈmissaw/) and means &quot;Born of Thoth&quot;. This theophoric name was part of the royal titulary of four pharaohs of the 18th dynasty as the name of Sa-Rê or &quot;birth name&quot;. It was also worn by the eldest son of Amenhotep III, high priest of Ptah, as well as by a vizier who exercised his functions successively under Thutmose IV and Amenhotep III. Under this last king and under his successor, Amenhotep IV, two other high dignitaries, royal sons of Kush, similarly called themselves &quot;Born[s] of Thoth&quot;.

==Ancient Egyptians==
===Monarchs and royals===
The name was common among royals of the Eighteenth Dynasty, which is thus sometimes called the &quot;Thutmosid&quot; Dynasty from the reign of Thutmose I onward.

* Thutmose I (16th-century–c. 1490 BC), third pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty
* Thutmose II (fl. 1493–1479 BC), fourth pharaoh
* Thutmose III (fl. 1479–1425 BC), &quot;the Conqueror&quot; or &quot;the Great&quot;, sixth pharaoh
* Thutmose IV (died 14th-century BC), eighth pharaoh
* Crown Prince Thutmose, the elder brother of Pharaoh Akhenaten

===Royal officials===
* Thutmose (18th-dynasty vizier), Vizier during the reign of Thutmose IV
* Thutmose (19th-dynasty vizier), Vizier during the latter part of the reign of Ramesses II during the 19th dynasty
* Tuthmose (Viceroy of Kush), the Viceroy of Kush during the reign of Akhenaten

===Other Egyptians===
* Thutmose (sculptor) (fl. 1350 BC), Akhenaten&#x27;s court sculptor at Amarna, to whom is attributed the famous Berlin bust of Nefertiti
* Thutmose (scribe) (fl. 11th-century BC), father of Butehamun, himself a scribe

==Others==
* Thutmose (musician) (born 1995), stage name of the Nigerian-American rapper Umar Ibrahim
* Thutmose Kamel Gabrial (1924-1948), an Egyptian military pilot who was killed in action during the 1948 Palestine War.

<text>A sea kayak or touring kayak is a kayak used for the sport of paddling on open waters of lakes, bays, and oceans. Sea kayaks are seaworthy small boats with a covered deck and the ability to incorporate a spray deck. They trade off the manoeuvrability of whitewater kayaks for higher cruising speed, cargo capacity, ease of straight-line paddling (tracking), and comfort for long journeys.

Sea kayaks are used around the world for marine (sea) journeys from a few hours to many weeks, and can accommodate one to three paddlers along with their camping gear, food, water, and other supplies. Solo sea kayaks are long, while tandem craft can be up to long; beam widths range from to .

The term &quot;sea kayaking&quot; may have been popularised by the 1981 book &quot;Sea Kayaking&quot; by John Dowd, who said, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t called sea kayaking until my book came out; it was called kayak touring or sea canoeing or canoe touring, blue-water paddling, coastal paddling, all those things&quot;.

==Origins==
Contemporary sea kayaks trace their origin to the native boats of Alaska, northern Canada, and Southwest Greenland. Inuit (formerly Eskimo) hunters developed a fast seagoing craft to hunt seals and walrus. The ancient Aleut name for an Aleutian kayak is &quot;Iqyak&quot;, and earliest models were constructed from a light wooden frame (tied together with sinew or baleen) and covered with sea mammal (sea lion or seal) hides. Archaeologists have found evidence indicating that kayaks are at least 4000 years old. Wooden kayaks and fabric kayaks on wooden frames (such as the Klepper) dominated the market up until the 1950s, when fiberglass boats were introduced. Rotomolded plastic kayaks first appeared in 1984.

==Design==

Modern sea kayaks come in a wide array of materials, designs, and sizes to suit a variety of intended uses. In sea kayaking, where the designs continue along primarily traditional lines, the primary distinction is between &quot;rigid&quot; kayaks and &quot;Folding kayaks&quot;. Folding kayaks are in some ways more traditional boats, being similar in design to &quot;skin-on-frame&quot; kayaks used by native people. Modern folding kayaks use ash and birch or contemporary materials such as aluminum for the frame, and replace the sealskin covering with synthetic waterproof fabrics. Unlike rigid kayaks, folding kayaks can be easily disassembled and packed for transport. Many folding kayaks include inflatable sponsons that improve the secondary stability of the vessel, helping to prevent capsize. More recently, a class of inflatable folding kayaks has emerged, combining a more limited rigid frame with a tightly inflated skin to produce greater rigidity than an inflatable boat alone.

In recent years, there has been an increase in production of sit-on-top kayaks suitable for sea use.

Most rigid sea kayaks also derive from the external designs of native vessels, especially those from Greenland, but the strength of modern materials such as fiberglass, rotomolded plastic and carbon fiber eliminate the need for an internal frame, though significantly increasing weight. Modern &quot;skin-on-frame&quot; sea kayaks constructed with nylon skins represent an ultralight niche within the rigid sea kayak spectrum. Some recent design innovations include:
* Recreational kayaks — shorter kayaks with wide beams and large cockpits intended for sheltered waters
* Sit-on-top kayaks — boats without an enclosed cockpit, but with the basic hull shape of a kayak.
* Inflatable kayaks with either a removable bladder within a tough outer skin, or a single skin similar to that used in rigid inflatable boat (RIB) construction.

A different class of vessel emerged in the 1960s, the surf ski, a long, narrow boat with low inherent stability that is intended for use in surf and following waves.

===Size===
Most production sea kayaks are between in length, the larger kayaks often built for two (or in rare cases, three) paddlers. The width (beam) of typical kayaks varies from , though specialized boats such as surf skis may be narrower. The length of a kayak affects not only its cargo capacity (for both gear and paddlers) but may also affect its &quot;tracking&quot; ability—the ease with which the boat travels in a straight line. While other design features also impact tracking, very long kayaks are easier to paddle straight (and harder to turn). The width of a kayak affects the cargo capacity, the maximum size of the cockpit (and thus the size of the paddler in that cockpit), and (to a degree that depends on the design of the hull) the stability.

===Material===

Most rigid production kayaks are now made out of fiberglass, rotomolded polyethylene, thermoformed plastic, blow moulded polyethylene or carbon-kevlar. More exotic materials include carbon fiber and foam core. Some kayaks are hand-built from plywood or wood strips covered with fiberglass. Skin-on-frame kayaks are built on wood or aluminum frames covered in canvas, dacron, or other fabrics, and may include inflatable tubes called sponsons.

Marine grade plywood available today provides a high strength to weight ratio for kayak construction.
Inflatable kayaks may be made from cheaper polyvinyl chloride (PVC) with a nylon outer skin to resist abrasion, or more expensive single-skin designs made from hypalon which is very tough and easy to dry after use.

===Bow, stern, and deck===
There are many design approaches for the bow, stern, and deck of kayaks. Some kayaks have upturned bows, which are meant to provide better performance when paddling into waves, as well as better wave-shedding ability. Other kayaks achieve this through increased buoyancy in the bow. Kayaks with unobstructed stern decks may ease certain types of self-rescue. Waterproof bulkheads in modern kayaks provide flotation in the event of capsize.

Sea kayak decks typically include one or more hatches for easy access to the interior storage space inside. Kayak decks usually include attachment points for &quot;deck lines&quot; of various kinds, which are aids in self-rescue and attachment points for above-deck equipment or luggage.

Cockpits can be of several designs. They can be large or small. A large keyhole cockpit can give the advantages of both, and combine firm contact between paddler and boat, while offering relatively easier access.

===Equipment===

Sea kayaks have a wide range of hull designs, which greatly expands their range of performance. Designs can accommodate a wide range of physical fitness, or usage. Boats come in many lengths, whereby shorter boats are generally more maneuverable, and longer boats generally travel straighter and faster. Width of beam can affect a boat&#x27;s stability, speed, and ability to bring to an edge. The amount of rocker (the curve from bow to stern) can greatly affect the ability of a boat to turn.

Many have steering gear or tracking aids in the form of rudders or skegs. In most cases, rudders are attached at the stern and operated by lines (wire or synthetics such as Spectra) from foot pedals in the cockpit. Rudders are typically retractable for beach landings. Skegs are typically retractable straight blades that drop from a well in the stern of the boat. Both devices assist in paddling when a strong wind or waves are coming from a direction other than directly in front. Some skegs may be more effective at countering pitch, roll and yaw.

==Paddles==
Sea-kayak paddles, and the associated paddling styles, fall into three basic classifications:
;European: 
: Two roughly spoon-shaped blades at either end of a cylindrical shaft. This paddle style was developed for fast acceleration and sudden manoeuvring in whitewater kayaking, and then back-ported to sea-kayaking. European-style paddles can be made of aluminium, plastic, or even wood; but the best are usually formed of more expensive materials like carbon-fibre for lightness. Often the two blades are &quot;feathered&quot;, or set at an angle relative to each other (both for ergonomic efficiency, and so that as one blade moves backwards through the water, the opposite blade moving forward through the air presents its edge, rather than its face). This makes it less efficient with the wind on the side or behind.
;Greenland: Relatively narrow blades which are rounded and full near the loom and blade roots, and becoming oval near the blade tips. Some paddles feature a &quot;shoulder&quot;, or abrupt transition between the loom and blade roots. Greenland paddle blades are usually not feathered. Short Greenland paddles (generally one arm-span in length), called storm paddles, are used with a sliding stroke, during which the hands are shifted along the blades for each stroke. Storm paddles are often used as spares and in very windy locations, as there is very little outboard blade to catch the wind.
;Wing: The blade of the paddle is shaped with a profile like a wing. When used with a particular stroke, the blade produces lift as it moves through the water, enabling the kayaker to produce more forward motion than with any other kind of paddle. The paddling technique is different from the European style paddle though the same motion is how the Greenland paddle works with its narrow blade. It is most often used in racing, but also sees some limited use in recreational paddling such as touring.
===Dimensions===
True sea kayaks, not to be mistaken for wider, more stable recreational kayaks, are available in many designs. The length of a solo sea kayak can range anywhere from long, and tandem kayaks can range from long. Sea kayaks can range in width (beam) from 22 to 24 inches wide. Wider touring kayaks of ) are better for bigger paddlers, or small/average sized paddlers looking for more initial stability and maneuverability. Narrower beams of are good for small-medium-sized paddlers who want more speed and less maneuverability. And lastly, kayak depth (or the height from the hull to the highest area of the deck) can range from high.

This design is typical of modern sea kayaks and has a low rear deck for easy rolling, a white water cockpit, compartments that allow the kayaker to reach into them while at sea, and a sloping rear bulkhead that enables the kayak to be emptied by lifting the bow.

==Safety==

A sea kayak&#x27;s primary safety device is its paddler. Although some kayakers consider a well-practised self-righting move such as an Eskimo roll to be essential in order to safe open-water kayaking, it is the technique of bracing that every well-trained, experienced kayaker practises in order to maintain an upright position in their kayak. Practice in bracing is often neglected by inexperienced kayakers once they have learned the Eskimo roll. However, the reality is that having to roll really means having to recover from a failed brace. Being in the capsized position in some environments due to missing a brace can put the paddler in danger of colliding with obstacles under the water. Staying upright in surf zones, rocky surf zones (informally known as rock gardens), and rivers is most important and is only accomplished through well-practised and successful bracing.

While there are a number of techniques for unassisted righting and re-entry of a kayak after a capsize and turtling, most paddlers consider it safest to paddle with one or more others, as assistance is useful if attempting to recover via rolling solo fails. Even if the assistance fails to successfully right the kayaker, it is much easier to climb back into a boat in the open sea if one has another boat and paddler to help and the swamped boat has been emptied of water first. Nonetheless, experienced paddlers do attempt open-water crossings unaccompanied, and many major long-distance kayak expeditions have been carried out solo.

The use of a paddle float self-rescue device, generally consisting of foam or in the form of an inflatable bag, and attached to the end of a paddle when needed, allows the paddle to be used as an outrigger while climbing back into the cockpit. If an inflatable paddle float is chosen, it should be a dual-chambered model on account of the safety advantage (in the event of failure of one chamber) that is conferred by the redundancy. The kayaker is advised to train with only one chamber inflated. In many areas (Canada, for instance), a paddle float is a safety item required by the coast guard. Re-entry using a paddle float is a fairly reliable rescue technique that, if well practised, allows one to paddle with confidence when one is not equipped with a flawlessly honed rolling skill.

There is a strong culture of self-sufficiency amongst sea kayakers and extensive safety equipment such as compass, towing lines, manual pumps, repair kits including wet application repair tape, flares, paddle leash, spare paddles, and survival gear are routinely carried; along with supplies of food and a flask of hot beverage for non-emergency use. GPS, charts, lights, radios and cell phones, and radar reflectors are also sometimes carried.

==Forms of sea kayaking==
===Kayak sailing===
Developed by kayak enthusiasts, Kayak sails can supplement or effectively eliminate the need for paddling. Using a sail can increase offshore range and allow longer expeditions. Use of a sail for touring has established a strong following with recreational sea kayakers, expedition paddlers, and adventure racers.

===Expedition trips===
Weekend trips with overnight camping are popular among recreational kayakers and many combine kayaking with wildlife watching. Modern sea kayaks are designed to carry large amounts of equipment and unsupported expeditions of two weeks or more are conducted in environments ranging from the tropics to the Arctic. Expedition kayaks are designed to handle best when loaded, so it may be necessary to ballast them on shorter trips.

===Surf kayaking===
Closely related to surf boards and requiring a mix of surfing and kayaking skills, a wide range of sea kayaks are specifically designed for the sport of surf kayaking.

===Sea fishing===
The sea kayak has long been a means of transportation and a means of accessing fishing grounds and kayak fishing has gained popularity due to the availability of purpose built stable designs. This technological development also solves some ergonomic problems that are associated with sitting for long hours without being able to change positions and special kayaks for fishing are accessorized for this sport, including specially-designed hatches, built-in rod holders, catch bags and equipment mounts.

Many of the techniques used in kayak fishing are the same as those used on other fishing boats. The difference is in the set-up, how each piece of equipment is fitted to the kayak, and how each activity is carried out on such a small craft. Contemporary kayaks can be equipped with fishing aids such as rod holders, electronic fish-finders and live-bait containers. Kayak anglers target highly prized bottom feeders like halibut and cod and also pelagics like amberjacks, tuna, sailfish, wahoo, and even marlin.

==Pioneering sea kayak expeditions==
;Pre-1900
* There is controversial evidence to suggest early trans-Atlantic kayak journeys from Labrador or Greenland to Scotland by Inuit paddlers. At the end of the 17th century there were at least three separate kayaks preserved in Scotland. One kayak, with associated equipment, is preserved in Aberdeen&#x27;s Marischal Museum. It was found, with dying occupant, on a nearby shore. Some suggest the occupants were escaped Inuit from European ships, Inuit storm-driven from Greenland, or from a European source. Many suggest Inuit and their kayaks to be the origin of the Celtic Finn-men, or Selkie, legends.

<text>Barry Town United Football Club is a semi-professional association football team based in Barry, Wales. They currently play in the .

They are known for representing Wales in Europe as winners of the Cymru Premier and Welsh Cup during the 1990s and early 2000s and have also competed in England&#x27;s Southern League and FA Cup. The team, which has contained more than 50 full internationals, is now run by supporters. They play at their traditional home of Jenner Park, Barry, which holds 3,500 spectators.

==History==

===Formation===

Barry Town United&#x27;s history dates back to 1892 when an association football team named Barry and Cadoxton District was formed in the area. During the early years, this side endured many upheavals, playing on five different grounds under various identities, including Barry Unionist Athletic, Barry United Athletic and Barry District. Players who featured during these years included Ted Vizard and Billy Jennings; who would each go on to play in the famous &#x27;White Horse&#x27; FA Cup Final.
In November 1912, a meeting at The Windsor public house in Holton Road saw townsfolk choose to pursue membership of the thriving Southern League as Barry AFC (the &#x27;Town&#x27; suffix was added after World War II). The club would secure land owned by the Jenner family and the people of the town came together to build Jenner Park, ahead of the first match of the 1912–13 season.

On 6 September 1913, Barry played their first fixture; a Southern League match against Mid-Rhondda at Jenner Park. The game attracted 4,000 spectators, including 1,000 travelling supporters.

Fittingly, the new team would register a surprise, albeit merited, victory, with Barry&#x27;s Ralph Isherwood scoring the very first goal at Jenner Park just three minutes in. His second, midway through the second half, sealed a 2–1 victory, a fine start for the Barry side on, coincidentally, the same afternoon that Arsenal played their first match at Highbury.

The ensuing two seasons would see Stoke City, Brentford, Coventry City and others visit the new ground. However, the Great War would soon interrupt any competitive proceedings; with Barry captain Major James Wightman one of the many casualties of The Battle of the Somme.

===Southern League success===
The 1920–21 season ranks as one of the finest in Barry&#x27;s history, as they surprised many by becoming champions of the Southern League&#x27;s Welsh section. The achievement was all the more impressive when considering the small Barry squad played over 100 matches in all competitions during the course of the season. Competing simultaneously in both the Welsh and Western League, the Barry board gave priority to Southern League fixtures, swayed by aspirations of joining the new English Third Division.

Inspired by Stanley Cowie, the title was clinched in early May, and yet hopes of Barry being able to move up to the Football League were scuppered just a month later, when their application failed and Charlton Athletic and Aberdare Athletic (the latter of whom finished second to Barry in their section) were elected instead.

Barry retained membership of the Southern League for more than 60 years – their highest finish being fourth in the 1930s. Among the notable players of the era were Johnny Gardner (with over 500 appearances), Dai Ward (scorer of more than 300 goals) and Fred Whitlow (a 100+ goal marksman). Meanwhile, Barry-born sportsman Ernie Carless combined his footballing exploits with a successful cricketing career with Glamorgan.

===FA Cup and Welsh Cup glory===

At the end of the 1920s, a crowd of 6,000 at Upton Park saw Barry beat Dagenham Town 1–0 to progress to the FA Cup 2nd Round; before losing to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion ten days later. It proved to be their most successful run in the competition. Barry would reach the 1st Round again in 1934–35, losing 1–0 to Northampton Town at Jenner Park, but the build-up to the match was tainted by a fire that ravaged the grandstand.

Football again took a backseat in 1939, with the eruption of World War II . Barry&#x27;s Chris Mason would be captured as a prisoner of war during the conflict, though would return to Jenner Park to resume his career afterwards; entertaining spectators thrilled by the adventures of players such as Derek Tapscott (who would later sign for Arsenal), celebrated striker Stan Richards and Gwilym &#x27;Cannonball&#x27; Cain.

In the 1949–50 season, Jenner Park became one of the first grounds in the country to introduce floodlights, with Newport County, Swansea City and Cardiff City all visiting to showcase the facilities. Two seasons later, an all-Welsh showdown in the FA Cup 1st Round saw Barry beaten by Newport, 4–0. Nevertheless, the town&#x27;s most celebrated footballing achievement was right around the corner.

In May 1955, following a 1–1 draw at the Racecourse in Wrexham, Barry beat Chester City 4–3 at Ninian Park to lift the Welsh Cup for the first time. Former Chelsea right-wing Charlie Dyke scored the winner, a dramatic late free-kick to take the cup back to Barry.

===1960s, 1970s and 1980s===
In the late 1950s, a host of Scandinavian stars made their way to Jenner Park, and dazzled Barry football enthusiasts with their skill. Among their number were Finland&#x27;s Hannu Kankkonen and Bengt &#x27;Folet&#x27; Berndtsson; a member of the Sweden squad that reached the final of the 1958 World Cup. The influx of players from continental Europe came as a result of chairman John Bailey&#x27;s business interests overseas.

During this period, the club embarked on an overseas tour, playing three games in Malta in 1960 against Sliema Wanderers, Hibernians and Valletta that all ended in draws.

1961 saw another big match as QPR visited Jenner Park in the FA Cup. A crowd of 7,000 saw Laurie Sheffield&#x27;s opener for Barry cancelled out late on. QPR won the replay at Loftus Road comfortably. The 1960s and 70s are perhaps most fondly remembered for the personalities that pulled on the Barry shirt. Among them, prolific goalscorers Ken Gully and Clive Ayres, brothers John and Dickie Batt, long-serving Bobby Smith and Ashley Griffiths, and tall defender Mike Cosslett; now a member of the club coaching staff.

In 1982, Barry left the Southern League, focusing on Welsh League competition and winning six Welsh League titles before the decade&#x27;s end; thanks in no small part to the goals of striker Steve Williams. The most significant match of the decade though came on 17 November 1984, as 3,850 crammed into Jenner Park to see Barry vs Reading in the FA Cup 1st Round. Despite Ian Love&#x27;s goal, an injury-time winner by Trevor Senior was enough to send the Royals through.

===Exile and return===

After insufficient floodlighting had stopped the club being able to compete in the Southern League for most of the 1980s, the tail end of the decade saw the necessary ground improvements to support a return to England. Barry entered the league&#x27;s Midland Division and would consistently finish in the top six, yet were denied the opportunity to field a reserve XI in the Welsh League as they had done previously.

The creation of the League of Wales (now Cymru Premier) in 1992 then prompted a decree that Barry would no longer be able to compete in the English pyramid at all while based on Welsh soil. As part of a group of rebel clubs known as the Irate Eight (alongside Newport, Merthyr, Colwyn Bay, Bangor City, Caernarfon Town, Newtown and Rhyl), the Town were forced into exile; with the first team adopting the name of Barri AFC and playing &#x27;home&#x27; matches out of Worcester City&#x27;s ground, while the reserves (by now, a local league outfit), manned the Jenner Park fort. However, this arrangement would last only one season, as chairman O&#x27; Halloran performed a shock u-turn that saw the Barry first team return home; eventually accepted into Welsh League Division One for the 1993–94 campaign.

===Decade of dominance===

Barry&#x27;s return to Jenner Park would spark the side&#x27;s most successful period, as they earned immediate promotion to the top flight and a unique quadruple of Welsh League championship, Welsh League Cup, FAW Trophy and Welsh Cup (for the first time since 1955).

The latter was one of the Town&#x27;s most famous achievements, as they upset Football League Second Division outfit Cardiff City in front of 16,000 spectators at the old National Stadium. Barry&#x27;s reward for winning the Welsh Cup was a European Cup Winners Cup tie against Žalgiris Vilnius of Lithuania, but they crashed out 7–0 on aggregate. Greater glory was on the horizon.

After one season in the League of Wales, Barry opted to become the league&#x27;s first fully professional club and, thereafter, won their first league championship in 1995–96. The season was though marred by the deaths of chairman Neil O&#x27; Halloran and young midfielder Matthew Holtham, the latter in a motorway accident on the way back from an away match in April.

1996 saw the club create history as the first League of Wales side to progress beyond the opening round of a European competition.

Following victory in Latvia over Dinaburg, Barry ousted Hungarian side Budapest Vasutas in one of several epic European nights at Jenner Park. Despite trailing 3–1 from the away leg, Barry stormed to a victory in the return match by the same score-line, and then won a penalty shoot-out 4–2.

A memorable all-British tie with Scottish Premier League side Aberdeen was their reward and, after losing 3–1 to Roy Aitken&#x27;s side at Pittodrie, the Welshmen were held to a pulsating 3–3 draw at a rain-swept Jenner Park; exiting the cup in thrilling fashion before a crowd of over 6,000. 

On the domestic scene, Barry were all-conquering, clinching a first treble of League of Wales championship, Welsh League Cup and Welsh Cup. The championship was claimed with a record 105 points and a goal difference of more than +100. In January 1997, the team was part of the first League of Wales match to be broadcast live on television; a 5–2 win over visitors Caernarfon Town that still holds the league&#x27;s attendance record. Then, from March, Barry went 51 matches without tasting a single defeat in a league fixture.

1999 saw Barry become the first League of Wales team to win the FAW Premier Cup, with a 2–1 win over Wrexham at the club&#x27;s own Racecourse Ground. Pipped to the title in 2000 by the emerging TNS, Barry would regain their crown the following campaign, while European battles with the likes of Dynamo Kyiv and Boavista saw players of the highest calibre grace Jenner Park (among them, the likes of Andriy Shevchenko and Serhii Rebrov.)

Then, in the 2001–02 season, Barry notably became the first League of Wales team to win a European Champions League tie, when they defeated the Azerbaijan champions FC Shamkir to set up a tie with Portuguese club FC Porto. Barry lost the first leg in Portugal by an emphatic 8–0 margin, after conceding two early penalties in front of a partisan 55,000 crowd. However, the Town would win the home leg 3–1, recording a famous result that has grown in legend with the career success of Porto&#x27;s Ricardo Carvalho, Helder Postiga and others.

===Decline and turmoil===
The golden era would not last forever, and the continual challenge of securing enough prize money to sustain their high standards set would eventually catch up with those running the club. After chairperson and backer Paula O&#x27; Halloran stood aside, former Scarborough and Grantham Town official Kevin Green came in as the club&#x27;s new chief executive; yet his varying initiatives failed to stop the rot. In one move that garnered significant press, Green would recruit ex-footballer and celebrity John Fashanu as the club&#x27;s high-profile chairman in the winter of 2002. Some saw Fashanu as the missing piece of the puzzle, and the man who would help sustain Barry&#x27;s success going forward. Promising African and Chinese TV deals and an influx of Nigerian internationals, Fashanu made headlines, yet did little to steady a Barry ship in increasingly rough seas. Then, after success on ITV reality show I&#x27;m A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here! saw him attain new-found popularity, Fashanu left the club; which by now was in a perilous financial state.

In the summer of 2003, the club went into administration and the professional squad would quickly disintegrate. An interim management team was appointed, together with an amateur squad drawn primarily from local side N &amp; M Construction of the South Wales Amateur League (five levels below the Welsh Premier). Within a month, Barry had gone from winning a match in Europe to losing 8–0 at Caernarfon Town. Though the professional-era bubble had well and truly burst, fans set about raising money to help keep the club alive. Eventually, mystery man Stuart Lovering arrived to purchase of the club on 10 December 2003. Few could have foreseen what was to come.

2003–04 was a difficult season, with champions Barry&#x27;s first league win not coming until February 2004 when they beat fellow strugglers Welshpool Town 5–4 with a 98th-minute winning penalty from youngster Luke Sherbon. Manager Colin Addison was brought in resuscitate the team&#x27;s ailing fortunes, yet the Dragons still ended up bottom of the division, four points off safety, and were relegated to the Welsh League Division One. Controversially, Addison was dismissed by Lovering on the eve of the new campaign, with assistant David Hughes replacing him; only to leave himself months later on finding his budget slashed. In the meantime, an independent district valuer had determined that the club should pay £42,000 in rent and rates each season for the remainder of the lease. Judging the figure to be unfairly based on the club&#x27;s relinquished professional status, Lovering refused to pay this amount and instead moved the senior side to the White Tips Stadium in Treforest from January 2005 to May 2006. During the absence, a number of staunch supporters formed breakaway club Barry FC; the culmination of a series of disputes with chairman Lovering, who had banned them from fundraising at club. With the Town relegated to their lowest-ever league status at the end of the 2005–06 season, the future appeared bleak for this fallen giant of Welsh football.

===Fan-led fightback===
While chaos reigned off the field for much of the decade, the roots of recovery began to grow in 2007, with the appointment of new manager Gavin Chesterfield. Chesterfield led Barry to promotion in 2008, with the hope that a winning run of form in the second tier would see the club&#x27;s dwindling support return. After stumbling early on, Barry enjoyed a 21-match unbeaten streak and finished the season a credible third. Nevertheless, the team&#x27;s achievements were continually overshadowed by events behind the scenes.

In December 2008, a crisis meeting at Jenner Park saw supporters come forward to pledge their commitment to operating the first team (forming a new company for this purpose), to allow Lovering to focus on finding a buyer. In one of a number of close calls, the club appeared on the verge of being sold in 2010, when businessman Clayton Jones appeared to strike a deal. However, this fell through at the eleventh hour, scuppering a plan to bring in Wales international John Hartson as Director of Football.

Undeterred, 2010 saw the Stand Up For Barry campaign launch, using new social media platforms such as Twitter to spread news of the club&#x27;s plight with a wider online audience. The resulting support from across the football community proved an invaluable asset as supporters strived to keep the club alive.

Shortly after the close of the 2010–11 season, Lovering announced his fresh intent of withdrawing the first team from higher league competition. To prevent this, the Barry Town Supporters&#x27; Committee (BTSC) took complete control of all football and its funding; resulting in what became known to some supporters as the &#x27;DIY Football&#x27; era. In the months that followed, the rejuvenated, fan-run Barry set-up enjoyed their most successful Welsh Cup campaign in several seasons; defeating rivals Merthyr Town at Penydarren Park and winning at Haverfordwest County in extra-time, before being edged out 3–2 at Newport County.

2012 marked the 100th anniversary of the club&#x27;s , with a series of events lined up to mark this and the subsequent centenary season. To launch the festivities, the BTSC hosted Cardiff City in an August fundraising friendly attended by 2,000 spectators. However, Lovering&#x27;s threats to withdraw Barry from the Welsh Football League would intensify in the weeks prior, threatening to cast a cloud over these celebrations. Nevertheless, the BTSC held a successful &#x27;100 Years of Barry Town&#x27; event at the Angel Hotel (attended by many past and present players), before the current team beat Welsh League champions Cambrian and Clydach on the 100th anniversary itself.

In March 2013, following wins against Caerleon, Penrhyncoch, Ely Rangers and Pontardawe Town, Barry won 2–0 at Flint Town United to progress to the Welsh Cup semi-final for the first time in a decade. Eventually, the team narrowly lost 1–2 to eventual winners Prestatyn Town, marking the first appearance of a fully amateur Barry side at the Welsh Cup semi-final stage.

===Survival and resurgence===
On 7 May 2013, Lovering withdrew the senior team from the Welsh Football League, against the will of the BTSC, players and supporters; who were ready, willing and able to fulfill the remaining two league fixtures (both against Ton Pentre). Rejecting this perceived act of sabotage, those running the football outlined their intentions to continue as they were, adopting the Barry Town United suffix to emphasise their continuing unity and endeavour. However, a meeting of the FAW Council in Betws-y-Coed in June 2013 announced that the Barry side would have to play &quot;recreational football&quot; henceforth; a declaration that prompted significant outcry, both locally and further afield.

There appeared hope for beleaguered Barry as second meeting was arranged for July 2013 at Maesmawr Hall in Caersws to hear new evidence as why the team should be able to continue on. At this second gathering, 15 of the FAW Councillors voted against discussing Barry&#x27;s future, thus concluding the meeting in no more than five minutes and at considerable expense. Notably, it emerged that this decision went against the recommendations of the FAW&#x27;s own Domestic Committee and legal team.

With their immediate and long-term future unclear, Barry began their pre-season with wins at Moreton and Elmore that same month, followed by a narrow 3–2 loss to Premier League newcomers Cardiff City, watched by a home crowd of 1,650 supporters on Saturday 27 July. Remarkably, given the bizarre set of circumstances, Barry had led 2–1 at half-time.

Eventually, a High Court judge in Cardiff ruled in Barry&#x27;s favour; stating that the FAW Council had acted unlawfully in denying them their licence to play Welsh League football. As a result, the fan-run Town side was entered back into the structure.

In the years that have followed, Barry would win two consecutive league titles, reclaiming their place in the second tier, while continuing to develop as a club, on and off the pitch. Today, the club competes at senior, development, youth and junior levels, along with various ladies&#x27; teams and pan disability sides in the over and under-16 age groups. In the 2016–17 season, the first team reached the final of Welsh League Cup for the first time since 2001, becoming only the second side from outside the national top flight to achieve this feat since the competition was expanded several years prior. In April 2017, the club secured its return to the Welsh Premier as champions of the Welsh Football League, continuing this remarkable revival.

On Saturday 6 April 2019, a remarkable 5–2 victory at Bala Town, coupled with a 6–0 win for The New Saints away against Newtown, ensured Barry would finish at least third in the 2018–19 JD Cymru Premier and qualify for the preliminary round of the UEFA Europa League. This marked a remarkable transformation for the club, qualifying for European competition for the first time since winning the JD Cymru Premier in the 2002–03 season.

A second European appearance in as many years would follow, as Barry travelled to the Faroe Islands to play NSI Runavik in a one-legged tie, following the abandonment of the 2019–20 season in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the club&#x27;s league results had begun to decline and Barry were ultimately relegated to the Cymru South in April 2022, having finished 11th out of 12 in the 2021-22 Cymru Premier. Nevertheless, the club would bounce back, with new manager Lee Kendall, a former goalkeeper at Jenner Park, guiding the team to the Cymru South championship with three games to spare.

On 25 July 2023, Kendall resigned as manager after just nine months in charge, despite signing a two-year contract with the club following their promotion back to the Cymru Premier. Kendall would be replaced by former Wales international defender Steve Jenkins.

==Colours==
For many decades, Barry wore green as their primary colour – thought to be due to officials securing the club&#x27;s first kit from Plymouth Argyle. On exile in 1992, Barri adopted a red and white strip, which would remain with them on their return to the Welsh pyramid. It was the following season that the club adopted its yellow change kit (deemed lucky for the success it brought in Welsh Cup competition) as a home strip – and it is this colour that has become synonymous with Town football, with variations including uses of blue.

Two of the club&#x27;s most memorable home strips are the fluorescent lime and navy ordered in error in 2006, and the experimental claret and blue kit worn in the early 1970s – both of which saw the club simultaneously plummet in footballing fortune. Nowadays, the club tends to wear yellow at home and green on the road, though red and then grey-based kits were worn in the past few seasons.







==Stadium==


Jenner Park occupies the space of land between Gladstone Road and Barry Road in central Barry and has been the setting for the evolution of Barry&#x27;s senior football club for more than 100 years.

Named after the Jenner family who had gifted the land, the ground was built by the Barry football enthusiasts for their representative side to compete at the highest possible level and was completed between the landmark meeting of 1912 and the opening fixture of 1913–14.

Among the most notable Barry matches played at Jenner Park have been European ties, domestic cup finals, major semi-finals and quarter-finals, FA Cup fixtures, televised matches, testimonials, high-scoring thrillers and friendlies against high-profile opposition.

Comprised initially of two wooden stands, popular bank terracing was added in 1923 and floodlights added in the 1940s, allowing Jenner Park to host Wales&#x27; first floodlit football match between Barry and Newport in 1949–50.

During the 1980s, the local council rebuilt Jenner Park, installing a synthetic running track, a new all-seater stand and improved floodlights.

To bring Jenner Park up to UEFA standards, a second covered stand was built in the mid-1990s, boosting the seating capacity to 2,500. This was temporarily increased to 6,000+ for the visits of Aberdeen and Manchester United with the use of temporary bleachers.

Recent years have seen the addition of a special viewing area for wheelchair users in the grandstand (known colloquially as the &#x27;Old Stand&#x27;), accessible via the stadium&#x27;s Devon Avenue entrance. Meanwhile, October 2015 saw work completed on a new, state-of-the-art 3G pitch, with its inaugural game, a Welsh Cup match against Aberdare Town.
