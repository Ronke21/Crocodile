==History==
Lord Chandrasuriyawongse (เจ้าจันทรสุริยวงษ์) and his followers established a settlement at Baan Luang Phonsim (บ้านหลวงโพนสิม) near the Thad Ing Hang Stupa (พระธาตุอิงฮัง) on the left bank of the Mekong River in Laos. Several decades later he died.

Lord Chanthakinnaree (เจ้าจันทกินรี), his son, succeeded him as ruler. In B.E. 2310 (1767 Common Era), a huntsman crossed over the Mekong and arrived along the right bank at the mouth of the stream Bang Muk (บังมุก), where he discovered a discarded realm complete with a monastery and seven sugar palms on the nearby riverbank. He found the area much better than the territories along the left side of the Mekong, and moreover at the mouth of the Bang Muk was an abundance of fish. He reported this to his ruler, Lord Chanthakinnaree. Chanthakinnaree led his followers across the Mekong to inspect the area and found that the area was indeed the remains of an ancient realm and in much better condition than any area along the left bank of the Mekong. He led his people from Baan Luang Phonsim to establish a settlement on the right bank at the mouth of Bang Muk.

When he began to clear away the forests to make way for his resettlement of the realm, he found two Buddha images beneath a sacred fig tree. The larger of the two was bricks-and-mortar, while the smaller one was made of fine iron. He had a new monastery built at once in the vicinity of the old, abandoned temple, and named it Wat Sri Moungkhoun (วัดศรีมุงคุณ) (cognate to Sri Mongkol (ศรีมงคล) in Central Thai, meaning &#x27;Temple of Serene Auspices&#x27;). He constructed a palatial manse in the vicinity of the temple where he enshrined both Buddha images in a vihara. Later, the iron Buddha image (the smaller one) appeared to mysteriously reestablish itself beneath the fig tree where it had first been discovered and ultimately, after some three or four spectacles of this nature, began slowly sinking into the ground there until only the crown of the head could be seen. An alternate place of worship was built there to cover the site instead and the image itself was then named Phra Loup Lek (พระหลุบเหล็ก), or &#x27;Venerable One of Ironmetal Who Shrouds Himself&#x27;. Today the site where Phra Loup Lek would submerge himself beneath the earth has been overtaken by the waters of the Mekong and washed away (presumably leaving only the shrine rescued and preserved at the front of the vihara at today&#x27;s Wat Sri Mongkol South (วัดศรีมงคลใต้)).

As for the brick-and-mortar Buddha image enshrined in the vihara at the Sri Mongkol Temple, the inhabitants of the realm named it Phra Chao Ong Luang (พระเจ้าองค์หลวง), or &#x27;Venerable Holy One&#x27;, and made it the representative image of Wat Sri Mongkol, which itself was later renamed Wat Sri Mongkol South. This Buddha image has been associated with the settlement and realm ever since.

During the rebuilding of the realm, at around midnight there were reports of a transparent or translucent object glittering and bright spotted emerging from the seven sugar palms. It drifted in the air above the Mekong every night until near dawn when the crystal-like object would then float back into the seven trees from whence it came. Lord Chanthakinnaree named this auspicious omen Keo Mukdahan (แก้วมุกดาหาร) or the &#x27;Pearlsmouth Crystal&#x27; as he had founded his realm on the banks of the Mekong where the mouth of the stream Bang Muk (or &#x27;Pearlhaven&#x27;) was located, in which people had discovered pearls (&quot;muk&quot;; มุก) in clams there. &quot;Mukdahan&quot; can refer to most any semiprecious stone resembling the pearl having a grey dull color, and not necessarily the pearl oyster, &quot;Pinctada margaritifera&quot;. Lord Chanthakinnaree then renamed the realm Mueang Mukdahan, as from the Fourth Month of the Year of the Pig, Year 1132 of the Chulasakarat (Minor Era), [Year 2313 of the Buddhasakarat (Buddhist Era or BE)] of the Buddhist calendar. The realm of Mukdahan at this stage covered both sides of the Mekong and reached the frontier lands of the Vietnamese (including the Laotian province of Savannakhet).

In B.E. 2321, during the Thonburi Period when King Taksin the Great extended his forces into the area of the Mekong River, he ordered Phra Mahakasut Suek and Chao Phya Chakri to dispatch their troops to the banks of the Mekong in order to suppress and unify the lords of all the realms great and small there on both sides of the Mekong together under the reign of the Kingdom of Thonburi, declaring Lord Chanthakinnaree the Phya Chanthasrisuraja Uparaja Mandhaturaj (พระยาจันทรศรีสุราชอุปราชามันธาตุราช), the first Lord of the Realm of Mukdahan and thereby officially naming the realm &quot;Mueang Mukdahan&quot;.

The city of Mukdahan was founded in 1770 by Lord Chanthakinnaree of Phonsim. It was originally administered within Monthon Udon Thani, but in 1907 it became a district (amphoe) of Nakhon Phanom province. On 27 September 1982 Mukdahan was upgraded to provincial status.

In 2006, the Second Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge, from Mukdahan to Savannakhet, Laos was opened.

==Economy==
In 2018, the Airports Department of the Thai Ministry of Transport announced that it would spend six million baht on a Mukdahan International Airport feasibility study. If built, it would become Thailand&#x27;s thirtieth international airport. The study is to be completed by March 2019.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows the Prasart Song Nang Sathit Palace, in which a moonstone is displayed on a tray.

The provincial tree and flower is &quot;Ochna integerrima&quot;. The Asian redtail catfish (&quot;Hemibagrus wyckioides&quot;) is the provincial aquatic life.

The provincial slogan is &quot;Skyscraping Ho Kaeo Tower, Phu Pha Thoep and Kaeng Kabao, eight ethnic minorities, famous sweet tamarind, large ancient kettledrum, origin of Lam Phaya, stunning view of the Mekong River, gateway to Indochina.&quot;

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
The province is divided into seven districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;). The districts are further divided into 53 subdistricts (&quot;tambon&quot;) and 493 villages (&quot;muban&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Mukdahan Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 25 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Mukdahan has town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 24 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 29 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<doc id="302528" wikidata="Q490043" url="?curid=302528" title="Miff Mole">
<text>Irving Milfred Mole (March 11, 1898 – April 29, 1961) known professionally as Miff Mole, was an American jazz trombonist and band leader. He is generally considered one of the greatest jazz trombonists and credited with creating &quot;the first distinctive and influential solo jazz trombone style.&quot;

His major recordings included &quot;Slippin&#x27; Around&quot;, &quot;Red Hot Mama&quot; in 1924 with Sophie Tucker on vocals, &quot;Miff&#x27;s Blues&quot;, and &quot;There&#x27;ll Come a Time (Wait and See)&quot;, which is on the film soundtrack to the 2008 movie &quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&quot;.

==Career==

Miff Mole was born in Greenwich Point, later renamed Roosevelt, Long Island, New York. He studied violin and piano as a child and switched to trombone when he was 15. From 1918 to 1919 Mole played in the Acme Sextett with Benny Krueger (saxophone), Ernie Holst (violin), and Edwin Taylor Williams (banjo). He played in Gus Sharp&#x27;s orchestra for two years and in the 1920s became a significant figure on the New York scene: he was a member of the Original Memphis Five (1922), played with Ross Gorman, Roger Wolfe Kahn, Sam Lanin, Ray Miller and many others. His other activities, like those of many jazz musicians at the time, included working for silent film and radio orchestras. In 1926–29, he and trumpeter Red Nichols led a band called Miff Mole and His Little Molers. They recorded frequently until 1930.

Mole and his band backed Sophie Tucker, who was known as &quot;The Last of the Red Hot Mammas&quot; and who was one of the most popular singers of the 1910s and 1920s. They accompanied her on her 1927 Okeh recordings of &quot;After You&#x27;ve Gone&quot;, &quot;Fifty Million Frenchmen Can&#x27;t Be Wrong&quot;, &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Got Nobody&quot;, and &quot;One Sweet Letter from You&quot;. Mole and his band, which included Eddie Lang, Jimmy Dorsey, Red Nichols, and Vic Berton, also accompanied her for live performances.

From 1925 to 1929, Mole was identified with bands led by cornetist Red Nichols: The Red Heads, The Hottentots, The Charleston Chasers, The Six Hottentots, The Cotton Pickers, Red and Miff&#x27;s Stompers, and especially Red Nichols and His Five Pennies. These bands recorded for the labels Perfect, Domino, Pathé, Edison, OKeh and Victor, though the Five Pennies name was used only for their recordings on Brunswick. The original Five Pennies band consisted of Nichols on cornet, Mole on trombone, Jimmy Dorsey on clarinet and alto sax, Eddie Lang on guitar, Arthur Schutt on piano, and Vic Berton (who came up with the name for the group) on drums, but over time the personnel changed and expanded. Among the musicians who passed through the Five Pennies were clarinetist Pee Wee Russell, violinist Joe Venuti, bass saxophonist Adrian Rollini, tuba and bass player Joe Tarto, trombonist Glenn Miller, and extra trumpeters such as Leo McConville and Charlie Teagarden.

When Jack Teagarden arrived in New York in 1928, he replaced Mole as the role model for trombonists, with a more legato, blues-oriented approach. Having started working for radio in 1927 (at WOR), Mole changed his focus to working with NBC (1929–1938). In 1938–1940, he was a member of Paul Whiteman&#x27;s orchestra, but his style by then had changed under the influence of Teagarden. In 1942–1943, Mole played in Benny Goodman&#x27;s orchestra, and between 1942 and 1947 he led dixieland bands. He worked in Chicago in 1947–1954.

Due to bad health, Mole played sporadically during his last years. He died in New York City on April 29, 1961. A benefit to raise money for his medical expenses was scheduled too late. He was interred in the family plot in Greenfield Cemetery, Hempstead, Long Island, New York.

Mole&#x27;s solo style, which included octave-leaps, shakes, and rapid-fire cadenzas, had a profound effect on jazz trombone playing in his time. Among those who emulated Mole&#x27;s playing were trombonists Bill Rank, Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, and Jimmy Harrison. His 1928 recording of &quot;Shim-Me-Sha-Wabble&quot; with the Little Molers (Okeh), was used in the soundtrack to the Russell Crowe movie &quot;Cinderella Man&quot; (2005).

In 2008, his composition &quot;There&#x27;ll Come a Time (Wait and See)&quot;, written with Wingy Manone, was on the soundtrack to the Academy Award-nominated movie &quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&quot;.

<text>Allard Motor Company Limited was a London-based low-volume car manufacturer founded in 1945 by Sydney Allard in small premises in Clapham, south-west London. Car manufacture almost ceased within a decade. It produced approximately 1900 cars before it became insolvent and ceased trading in 1958. Before the war, Allard supplied some replicas of a Bugatti-tailed special of his own design from Adlards Motors in Putney.

Allards featured large American V8 engines in a light British chassis and body, giving a high power-to-weight ratio and foreshadowing the Sunbeam Tiger and AC Cobra of the early 1960s. Cobra designer Carroll Shelby and Chevrolet Corvette chief engineer Zora Arkus-Duntov both drove Allards in the early 1950s.

== Pre-war Allard Specials ==

The first Allard cars were built to compete in &quot;trials&quot; events – timed rally-like events on terrain almost impassable by wheeled vehicles. Built in under three weeks, the first Allard was powered by a Ford flathead V8 in a body mainly pirated from a Bugatti. The V8 was moved backward in the chassis to improve traction. The car used the American engine&#x27;s high torque to great effect in slow-speed competition. It debuted at the Gloucester Cup Trials, and later won the event at Southport Sands. 

After a time the front beam axle was converted to independent front suspension. Leslie Ballamy&#x27;s rather crude method was to cut the beam in half and mount the halves as swing axles and these swing axles were used on nearly all later Allard specials.

Further Allards were soon built to order. Allard&#x27;s brother, Leslie, was a customer, while racer Ken Hutchinson purchased a Lincoln-Zephyr V12-powered version. It led to the pair forming a team, dubbed Tail Waggers, to race the car, which proved quite successful, including setting a new record at the Prescott hillclimb.

In 1937, Allard began producing modified Fords (in much the same way as the Chevrolet brothers had in the U.S.), selling them for £450 each. By the outbreak of war in 1939, twelve Allard Specials had been built. Sydney Allard&#x27;s planned volume production was pre-empted by work on Ford-based trucks during the conflict. By the war&#x27;s end, Allard had built up a substantial inventory of Ford parts.

==Post-war models==

The Allard Motor Company was founded in 1945, setting up in Clapham High Street, London. Using its inventory of easy-to-service Ford mechanicals built up during World War II and bodywork of Allard&#x27;s own design, three post-war models were introduced with a newly designed steel chassis and lightweight body shells: the J, a competition sports car; the K, a slightly larger car intended for road use, and the four seater L. All three were based on the Ford Pilot chassis and powered by a fairly stock sidevalve V8 with a single carburettor and 6:1 compression, driving a three-speed transmission and low-geared rearend, for superior acceleration. Front suspension was Ballamy swing axle, rear Ford solid axle. They were bodied in aluminium by Allard&#x27;s friend Godfrey Imhof. Sales were fairly brisk for a low-volume car, and demand was high for cars in general, which led to the introduction of several larger models, the drophead coupe M and P.

Allard used &quot;J&quot; for the short-wheelbase two-seaters, &quot;K&quot; for two- or three-seat tourers or roadsters, &quot;L&quot; for four-seat tourers, &quot;M&quot; for drophead (convertible) coupes, and &quot;P&quot; for fixed-head cars. As models were replaced, subsequent models were numbered sequentially.

===J===
====J1====
Built from 1946 to 1947, the J1 was released as a two-seater competition car together with the K1 touring two-seater and the L- Type touring 4-seater. The J1 was a starkly trimmed and equipped 2-seater competition car on a wheelbase. Powered by a overhead valve Mercury V8, the J1 had a top speed of , limited by the low rear axle gearing. Only 12 were produced and went only to buyers who would rally them. They had good ground clearance and the front wings were removable. Copies driven by Allard himself, Maurice Wick, and others, and was a successful racer. Imhof won the 1947 Lisbon Rally in a J1 powered by a Marshall-supercharged version, while Leonard Potter took the &quot;Coupe des Alpes&quot; that year.

====J2====
Sydney Allard soon saw the potential of the economically more vibrant – but sports car starved – U.S. market and developed a special competition model to tap it, the J2. The new roadster, weighing just , was a potent combination of a lightweight, hand-formed aluminium body fitted with new coil spring front suspension, fitted with inclined telescopic dampers, and de Dion-type rear axle, inboard rear brakes, and , Mercury flathead V8, with the option of an Ardun hemi conversion. The J2 had a disturbing tendency to catch fire when started.

Importing American engines just to ship them back across the Atlantic proved problematic, so U.S.-bound Allards were soon shipped engineless and fitted out in the States variously with newer overhead valve engines by Cadillac, Chrysler, Buick, and Oldsmobile. In that form, the J2 proved a highly competitive international race car for 1950, most frequently powered by Cadillac engines. Domestic versions for England came equipped with Ford or Mercury flatheads. Zora Duntov worked for Allard from 1950 to 1952 and raced for the factory Allard team at Le Mans in 1952 and 1953.

Available both in street trim and stripped down for racing, the J2 proved successful in competition on both sides of the Atlantic, including a third place overall at Le Mans in 1950 (co-driven by Tom Cole and Allard himself) at an average , powered by a Cadillac V8.

J2s returned to Le Mans in 1951, one co-driven again by Cole and Allard, the other by Reece and Hitchings; Reece jumped an embankment, while the Allard car broke. They had no more success in 1952, both cars failing to finish.

Of 313 documented starts in major races in the 9 years between 1949 and 1957, J2s compiled 40 first-place finishes; 32 seconds; 30 thirds; 25 fourths; and 10 fifth-place finishes. Both Zora Duntov and Carroll Shelby raced J2s in the early 1950s. Ninety J2s were produced between 1950 and 1952.

====J2X====

In an effort to extend a line growing obsolete in the face of advances in sports car design, Allard introduced an &#x27;improved&#x27; model in late 1951, the J2X (extended). The chassis remained unchanged from the previous J2, but in an attempt to improve handling, the front suspension&#x27;s rear attaching radius rods were redesigned with forward ones, which required a forward cross member and extending the nose past the front wheels. This, in turn, allowed the engine to be moved forward , yielding more cockpit room. The nose was lengthened some to accommodate the change.

In standard form, the spare wheel was carried hidden on top of the rear-mounted fuel tank, but either version could carry one or two side-mounted spares. This allowed the use of a 40 gallon long distance fuel tank.

Arriving later, during a time when sports racing car design was developing rapidly, the J2X was not as successful in international racing as the J2, as it was not as competitive compared to more advanced C- and D-type Jaguars, alongside Mercedes, Ferrari, and Maserati works entries. Thus, it headlined less often in major international races and of 199 documented major race starts in the 9 years between 1952 and 1960, J2X&#x27;s garnered 12 first-place finishes; 11 seconds; 17 thirds; 14 fourths; and 10 fifths.

One J2X chassis was given custom magnesium-alloy bodywork by Essex Aero.

====JR====

This 1953 car was a lightweight specialist racer, powered by a Cadillac engine claimed to produce . Entered at Le Mans that year, the Allard/Fotheringham-Parker car suffered a broken rear suspension, while the Duntov/Merrick car also retired. This was the marque&#x27;s last effort at Le Mans. Seven cars were built in total, with the last car finished in 1956.
===K===
====K1====
Built from 1946 to 1948, the K1 used a wheelbase and was powered by a tuned version of the V8, with 7:1 compression, producing . The frame was made up from stamped steel channel sections by Thomsons of Wolverton specially for Allard. Side rails and cross members were designed to fit the Allard trailing link, transverse leaf independent front suspension and live rear axle. Production totaled 151 and fitted with the same engine options as the J1 the K1 could reach .
====K2====
The K2 is a 2-seater sports car produced from 1950 to 1952. It was offered with Ford and Mercury V8s in the home market and with Chrysler and Cadillac V8s in the USA. 119 were built.

====K3====
In 1952, Allard adapted the Palm Beach in a K3, an attempt to offer a more civilized variant of the J2 and J2X models seen at the track. Exported to America as a potential &quot;Corvette slayer&quot; Dodge dealers had been clamoring for, it featured one of the most powerful engines of its era, the Chrysler hemi engine, fitted with a pair of 4-barrel carburetors. Essentially an up-enginged, rebodied Palm Beach, it failed to find a niche in either market in spite of its performance. Today the exceptionally rare automobile can fetch the better part of US$250,000 at auction. 62 examples were built, of which 57 were delivered to the United States.
===L===
The L is a 4-seat roadster, produced from 1946 to 1950. It was on a wheelbase and available with a choice of Ford V8 or Mercury engines. The top speed is estimated to be . Priced at a little more than £1000, 191 were produced.
===P===
====P1====

Known more often than not simply as the Allard 3.6-litre Saloon, the P1 was a five-seat, two-door sports saloon produced between 1949 and 1952. The cars used Ford engines and transmissions, and included a &quot;Sports&quot; model.
In 1952 an Allard P1, driven by Sydney Allard himself, along with Guy Warburton, won the Monte Carlo Rally. Tom Lush was the navigator.

The P1 was the choice of professionals who wanted something different and was quite popular with doctors and solicitors in its day. Some 559 were produced during the model&#x27;s run. Today it is believed fewer than 45 remain worldwide.

====P2 Monte Carlo====
The P2 Monte Carlo was a 2-door saloon variant of the K3, produced from 1952 to 1955. It utilised a wood frame with aluminium panels on a 112-inch wheelbase and was offered with 3.6-litre Ford Pilot V8 and 4.4-litre Mercury V8 engines. 11 were built.

====P2 Safari====

In an attempt to further extend its line, Allard adapted its P1 saloon to produce the 8-seater, wood-sided, V8-engined, P2 Safari Estate. It too found weak sales, with 13 examples being built in total.

===M===
The M appeared in 1948, remaining in production until 1950. It was a drophead coupé.

===Clipper===

The 1953 Clipper was an attempt to cash in on the era&#x27;s burgeoning microcar market. A tiny glass-fibre-bodied car powered by a rear-mounted 346 cc Villiers twin-cylinder motorcycle engine, it claimed to seat three people abreast with room for two children in an optional Dicky seat. About 20 were made.

===Palm Beach===

Allard introduced the Palm Beach roadster in 1952. It had a wheelbase, it was powered by either a Ford Consul inline four or Ford Zephyr inline six. Priced under £1200, the MkI was built until 1958. It sold poorly. A Mark II was introduced in 1956, with more modern bodywork. It could be had with Zephyr or Jaguar XK120 inline six. The split front axle was replaced by torsion bars and coil springs were fitted in the back.

===P4===
Car designer Chris Humberstone licensed the Allard name from Sydney&#x27;s son Alan Allard in the 1990s. He developed the J2X-C prototype racer, powered by a 3.5 liter Cosworth V8 engine and a transmission also grafted from an F1 car.

Short of money, Humberstone allegedly attempted to work a deal with Toyota, which would have seen examples of the first-generation Lexus LS400 be rebadged and sold as Allards to help build attention and capital for the J2X-C racer. According to sources from the time, the deal between Allard and Toyota was allegedly proceeding well, but fizzled and ultimately fell flat for unknown reasons.

The Allard P4 follows the same formula as another re-styled Anglo-Japanese hybrid, the Sterling 825, with Allard handling the design aspects while Lexus covered all the performance essentials. That meant the P4 was powered by the LS400&#x27;s 4.0 liter V8, which delivered 250 horsepower to the rear wheels. The exterior styling still retained a robust Lexus flavor. Still, Allard designers tried to make it somewhat different thanks to a revised front and rear fascia, basketweave wheels, and a red and black interior. Unfortunately, the P4 did little to help the J2X-C program, which collapsed after the car failed to meet its performance targets and the company itself liquidating during development.

== Decline ==
Insufficient research and development meant that Allard failed to keep up with cheaper and more technically advanced cars. The Palm Beach was essentially a year behind its competitors, the K3 failed to live up to expectations, and the Safari Estate could not find a market.

By the mid-1950s Allard was struggling to remain solvent, and with the market weak due to a late-1950s US recession, the company went into administration in 1957, when manufacture of cars came to an end.

The company also offered disc brake conversions for the Ford Anglia.

In 1961, the company offered a dragster, the Dragon, powered by a Shorrock-supercharged 1.5 liter Ford, and was distributor of the superchargers, later also taking over production of them.

Allard&#x27;s son, Alan, marketed the Allardette 105, 109, and 116, using the straight-four-cylinder engine from the Ford Anglia and other Ford models.

In 1966 Sydney Allard died on the same night a fire destroyed the Clapham factory and some of the Allard Motor Company factory records. The factory site in Clapham, South West London, is now a development of social housing apartments, and the showroom and workshop in Putney is now a Howdens Joinery trade products showroom.

== Marque Revival ==
In 2012, a new Allard company was established called Allard Sports Cars Limited. This company has produced a period correct continuation chassis 3408 of the JR, and announced the development of a new J8 model in 2017. The company officially reopened its business and began production in September 2018.

<text>Claude Gaspar Bachet Sieur de Méziriac (9 October 1581 – 26 February 1638) was a French mathematician and poet born in Bourg-en-Bresse, at that time belonging to Duchy of Savoy. He wrote , , and a Latin translation of the &quot;Arithmetica&quot; of Diophantus (the very translation where Fermat wrote a margin note about Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem). He also discovered means of solving indeterminate equations using continued fractions, a method of constructing magic squares, and a proof of Bézout&#x27;s identity.

== Biography ==
Claude Gaspar Bachet de Méziriac was born in Bourg-en-Bresse on 9 October 1581. By the time he reached the age of six, both his mother (Marie de Chavanes) and his father (Jean Bachet) had died. He was then looked after by the Jesuit Order. For a year in 1601, Bachet was a member of the Jesuit Order (he left due to an illness).

Bachet lived a comfortable life in Bourg-en-Bresse. He married Philiberte de Chabeu in 1620 and had seven children.

Bachet was a pupil of the Jesuit mathematician Jacques de Billy at the Jesuit College in Rheims. They became close friends.

Bachet wrote the &quot;Problèmes plaisans et délectables qui se font par les nombres&quot; of which the first edition was issued in 1612, a second and enlarged edition was brought out in 1624; this contains an interesting collection of arithmetical tricks and questions, many of which are quoted in W. W. Rouse Ball&#x27;s &quot;Mathematical Recreations and Essays&quot;.

He also wrote &quot;Les éléments arithmétiques&quot;, which exists in manuscript; and a translation, from Greek to Latin, of the &quot;Arithmetica&quot; of Diophantus (1621). It was this very translation in which Fermat wrote his famous margin note claiming that he had a proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. The same text renders Diophantus&#x27; term παρισὀτης as &quot;adaequalitat&quot;, which became Fermat&#x27;s technique of adequality, a pioneering method of infinitesimal calculus.

Bachet was the earliest writer who discussed the solution of indeterminate equations by means of continued fractions. He also did work in number theory and found a method of constructing magic squares. 
In the second edition of his &quot;Problèmes plaisants&quot; (1624) he gives a proof of Bézout&#x27;s identity (as proposition XVIII) 142 years before it got published by Bézout.

He was elected member of the Académie française in 1635.

<text>Pskov (; see also names in other languages) is a city in northwestern Russia and the administrative center of Pskov Oblast, located about east of the Estonian border, on the Velikaya River. Population: 

Pskov is one of the oldest cities in Russia. During the Middle Ages, it served as the capital of the Pskov Republic and was a trading post of the Hanseatic League before it was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Moscow and became an important border fortress in the Tsardom of Russia.

==History==

===Early history===

Pskov is one of the oldest cities in Russia. The name of the city, originally Pleskov (historic Russian spelling , ), may be loosely translated as &quot;[the town] of purling waters&quot;. It was historically known in English as Plescow. 

Its earliest mention comes in 903, which records that Igor of Kiev married a local lady, Olga (later Saint Olga of Kiev). Pskovians sometimes take this year as the city&#x27;s foundation date, and in 2003 a great jubilee took place to celebrate Pskov&#x27;s 1,100th anniversary.

The first prince of Pskov was Vladimir the Great&#x27;s youngest son Sudislav. Once imprisoned by his brother Yaroslav, he was not released until the latter&#x27;s death several decades later. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the town adhered politically to the Novgorod Republic. In 1241, it was taken by the Teutonic Knights, but Alexander Nevsky recaptured it several months later during a legendary campaign dramatized in Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s 1938 movie &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;.

In order to secure their independence from the knights, the Pskovians elected a Lithuanian prince, named Daumantas, a Roman Catholic converted to Orthodox faith and known in Russia as Dovmont, as their military leader and prince in 1266. Having fortified the town, Daumantas routed the Teutonic Knights at Rakvere and overran much of Estonia. His remains and sword are preserved in the local kremlin, and the core of the citadel, erected by him, still bears the name of &quot;Dovmont&#x27;s town&quot;.

In 1341 the city recognized overlordship of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, in 1347 it switched allegiance to the Novgorod Republic, and the following year it became the capital of the newly independent Pskov Republic.

===Pskov Republic===
By the 14th century, the town functioned as the capital of a &quot;de facto&quot; sovereign republic. Its most powerful force was the merchants who traded with the Hanseatic League. Pskov&#x27;s independence was formally recognized by Novgorod in 1348. Several years later, the veche promulgated a law code (called the Pskov Charter), which was one of the principal sources of the all-Russian law code issued in 1497.

Already in the 13th century German merchants were present in &quot;Zapskovye&quot; area of Pskov and the Hanseatic League had a trading post in the same area in the first half of 16th century which moved to &quot;Zavelichye&quot; after a fire in 1562. The wars with Livonian Order, Poland-Lithuania and Sweden interrupted the trade but it was maintained until the 17th century, with Swedish merchants gaining the upper hand eventually.
The importance of the city made it the subject of numerous sieges throughout its history. The Pskov Krom (or Kremlin) withstood twenty-six sieges in the 15th century alone. At one point, five stone walls ringed it, making the city practically impregnable. A local school of icon-painting flourished, and the local masons were considered the best in Russia. Many peculiar features of Russian architecture were first introduced in Pskov.

===Grand Duchy of Moscow===

Finally, in 1510, the city was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Three hundred families were deported from Pskov to central Russia, and merchants and military families from Muscovy were settled in the city. At this time Pskov had at least 6,500 households and a population of more than 30,000; it was one of the three biggest cities of Muscovy, alongside Moscow and Novgorod.

===Tsardom of Russia===

The deportation of noble families to Moscow under Ivan IV in 1570 is a subject of Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s opera &quot;Pskovityanka&quot; (1872). Pskov still attracted enemy armies and it withstood a prolonged siege by a 50,000-strong Polish-Lithuanian army during the final stage of the Livonian War (1581–1582). The king of Poland Stephen Báthory undertook some thirty-one attacks to storm the city, which was defended mainly by civilians. Even after one of the city walls was broken, the Pskovians managed to fill the gap and repel the attack. &quot;A big city, it is like Paris&quot;, wrote Báthory&#x27;s secretary about Pskov.

The estimates of the population of Pskov land in the middle of 16th century range from 150 to 300 thousand. Famines, epidemics (especially the epidemic of 1552) and the warfare led to a five-fold decrease of the population by 1582–1585 due to mortality and migration.

The city withstood a siege by the Swedish in 1615. The successful defence of the city led to the peace negotiations culminating in the Treaty of Stolbovo.

===Russian Empire===

Peter the Great&#x27;s conquest of Estonia and Livonia during the Great Northern War in the early 18th century spelled the end of Pskov&#x27;s traditional role as a vital border fortress and a key to Russia&#x27;s interior. As a consequence, the city&#x27;s importance and well-being declined dramatically, although it served as a seat of separate Pskov Governorate since 1777. In 1897, the ethnic make-up, by mother tongue, was 80.0% Russian, , 4.7% Jewish, 4.3% German, 2.4% Latvian, 2.1% Estonian.

During World War I, Pskov became the headquarters for Russia&#x27;s Northern Front, commanded by Nikolai Ruzsky. On 15 March 1917, aboard the Imperial train, Tsar Nicholas II abdicated here. After the Russo-German Brest-Litovsk Peace Conference (22 December 1917 – 3 March 1918), the Imperial German Army invaded the area. 

Pskov was also occupied by the Estonian army between 25 May 1919 and 28 August 1919 during the Estonian War of Independence when the White Russian commander Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz became the military administrator of Pskov. He personally ceded most of his responsibilities to a democratically elected municipal duma and focused on both cultural and economical recovery of the war-impoverished city. He also put an end to censorship of press and allowed for creation of several socialist associations and newspapers.

===Recent history===
Under the Soviet government, large parts of the city were rebuilt, many ancient buildings, particularly churches, were demolished to give space for new constructions. During World War II, in June 1940, the Soviet 8th Army invaded Estonia and Latvia from the city. The medieval citadel provided little protection against modern artillery of the Wehrmacht, and Pskov suffered substantial damage during the German occupation from 9 July 1941 until 23 July 1944. The Germans operated a forced labour camp for Jewish men and women. In February 1944, thousands of people were killed during Russian bombings of the city. A huge portion of the population died during the war, and Pskov has since struggled to regain its traditional position as a major industrial and cultural center of western Russia.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Pskov is the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Pskovsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the City of Pskov—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Pskov is incorporated as Pskov Urban Okrug.

==Landmarks and sights==
Pskov still preserves much of its medieval walls, built from the 13th century on. Its medieval citadel is called either the Krom or the Kremlin. Within its walls rises the Trinity Cathedral, founded in 1138 and rebuilt in the 1690s. The cathedral contains the tombs of saint princes Vsevolod (died in 1138) and Dovmont (died in 1299). Other ancient cathedrals adorn the Mirozhsky Monastery (completed by 1152), famous for its 12th-century frescoes, St. John&#x27;s (completed by 1243), and the Snetogorsky monastery (built in 1310 and stucco-painted in 1313).

Pskov is exceedingly rich in tiny, squat, picturesque churches, dating mainly from the 15th and the 16th centuries. There are many dozens of them, the most notable being St. Basil&#x27;s on the Hill (1413), St. Kozma and Demian&#x27;s near the Bridge (1463), St. George&#x27;s from the Downhill (1494), Assumption from the Ferryside (1444, 1521), and St. Nicholas&#x27; from Usokha (1536). The 17th-century residential architecture is represented by merchant mansions, such as the Salt House, the Pogankin Palace, and the Trubinsky mansion.

Among the sights in the vicinity of Pskov are Izborsk, a seat of Rurik&#x27;s brother in the 9th century and one of the most formidable fortresses of medieval Russia; the Pskov Monastery of the Caves, the oldest continually functioning monastery in Russia (founded in the mid-15th century) and a magnet for pilgrims from all over the country; the 16th-century Krypetsky Monastery; Yelizarov Convent, which used to be a great cultural and literary center of medieval Russia; and Mikhaylovskoye, a family home of Alexander Pushkin where he wrote some of the best known lines in the Russian language. The national poet of Russia is buried in the ancient cloister at the Holy Mountains nearby. Unfortunately, the area presently has only a minimal tourist infrastructure, and the historic core of Pskov requires serious investments to realize its great tourist potential.

On 7 July 2019, the Churches of the Pskov School of Architecture was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

== Geography ==

=== Ecological situation ===
Vehicle emissions reach 83% of total emissions from stationary and mobile sources. The volume of emissions of atmospheric pollutants from stationary sources in 2007 amounted to 16.5 thousand tons, including 7.1 thousand tons (43.2%) of carbon monoxide and 2.6 thousand tons (15.8%) of solids. The largest source of air pollution in Pskov is Pskov Poultry Farm LLC (1365.92 tons of pollutants were emitted) and the Pskov Heating Networks SE (478.12 tons). All rivers flowing through the territory of the Pskov Oblast, including the city of Pskov, are characterized by increased concentrations of total iron, copper ions, and hardly oxidizable organic compounds in the water.

The following indicators characterize air pollution in Pskov:
* annual average and maximum one-time concentration of sulfur dioxide – below 1 MPC
* the annual average concentration of nitrogen dioxide – 1.5 MPC; the maximum single concentration – 3.4 MPC
* annual average and maximum one-time concentration of carbon monoxide – below 1 MPC
* average annual concentration of suspended solids – below 1 MPC; the maximum single concentration – 2.2 MPC
* the degree of air pollution in general for Pskov is approximately low and is determined by the API value – 2.81

Since the late 1990s, the Clean Water project officially registered by United Russia in 2006 has been implemented. Improving the quality of drinking water is planned to be carried out by gradually abandoning surface water intake from the Velikaya River and transitioning to the extraction of water from underground sources. However, underground water intake leads to the clogging of hot water supply systems (up to complete obstruction) in those facilities where this water enters due to its increased hardness.

=== Climate ===
The climate of Pskov is humid continental (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with maritime influences due to the city&#x27;s relative proximity to the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Finland; with relatively mild (for Russia) but still quite long winter and warm summer. Further west in Europe on the same latitude, winters are quite a bit milder and summer highs a bit cooler. Summer and fall have more precipitation than winter and spring.

<text>Rosaura Revueltas Sánchez (August 6, 1910 – April 30, 1996) was a Mexican actress of stage and screen whose career was cut short by the entertainment industry blacklist in the 1950s. She is best known for her role in the 1954 film &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;.

==Early life==
Rosaura Revueltas was born in Lerdo, Durango, Mexico in 1910 to the famously artistic Revueltas family and had three brothers who were artists: Silvestre Revueltas, a composer; José Revueltas, a writer; and Fermín Revueltas, a painter. The family moved to Mexico City in 1921 and Rosaura enrolled in the Humboldt School, where she learned German and English. She also studied ballet and acting.

After marrying German citizen Frederick Bodenstedt and having a son, Arturo, Rosaura opted for a profession in the arts. She initially took up dance, making her public debut in Carmen at Bellas Artes in 1945. She then participated in the &quot;Arte Folklórico Español&quot; production of &quot;La doma de la fiera&quot; (1945). She had her first acting success on stage in &quot;La desconocida de Arrás&quot; (1946). By 1950, she was starring in &quot;El cuadrante de la soledad&quot;. Although she continued to do theatrical work in the early 1950s, such as Edmundo Baez&#x27;s play &quot;Un Alfiler en los Ojos&quot; (1952), she mostly turned her attention to film acting, culminating in her best-known film &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; (1954).

==Film career==
In 1950, Revueltas obtained a minor part in &quot;Pancho Villa vuelve&quot; (1950). Next, she earned a more prominent role in &quot;Un día de vida&quot; (1950). She portrayed Rosa Suárez, viuda de Ortiz (the widow of Ortiz), in &quot;Las Islas Marías&quot; (1951), featuring Pedro Infante. The following year, she was in &quot;El rebozo de Soledad&quot;, and in 1953 she played Tia Magdalena in the American-made film &quot;Sombrero&quot;.

In 1951, Revueltas began a pattern of selecting roles in politically charged films when she starred as the &quot;Madre superiora&quot; in &quot;Muchachas de Uniforme&quot;. It was the Mexican remake of the 1931 German film &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot;, which was one of the first screen representations of lesbian romance. Her willingness to choose pathbreaking projects sometimes caused her to be targeted by politicians and Catholic Church officials. After the release of &quot;Muchachas de Uniforme&quot;, the Catholic Church urged a boycott of the film. In the aftermath of the controversy, Revueltas immigrated to the United States. She again sought a role that offered a progressive representation of women when she landed the main part in Herbert J. Biberman&#x27;s &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;.

The story was based on the 1951 Empire Zinc strike in Grant County, New Mexico. She played Esperanza Quintero, the wife of a mine worker. In the film, Esperanza&#x27;s husband and fellow miners decide to go on strike, and in turn, their wives do the same in order to support their spouses and gain rights of their own.

Revueltas was not Biberman&#x27;s first choice for Esperanza. Originally his wife Gale Sondergaard was cast, but upon further reflection, Biberman thought the role should be portrayed by a Spanish-speaking actress. Revueltas was one of the few professional actors in &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;. Most of the other roles, including that of her husband Ramon, were played by actual miners, some of whom had taken part in real-life strikes. For instance, Juan Chacón, who played Ramon Quintero, was the president of a local miners&#x27; union.

==Blacklisted==
The Hollywood blacklist and Red Scare cast a shadow over &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;. The film&#x27;s director Herbert Biberman was a member of the Hollywood Ten—the initial group of film artists blacklisted and jailed for refusing to cooperate with the House Committee on Un-American Activities. His Academy Award-winning actress wife Gale Sondergaard supported Biberman throughout this time period, and she was blacklisted as well. The film&#x27;s producer Paul Jarrico and writer Michael Wilson were also blacklistees. Because of her involvement in &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;, Revueltas became a blacklistee too.

Near the end of filming on February 25, 1953, Revueltas was arrested by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) on an alleged passport violation (not having it stamped properly upon entry to the country). She was taken from the filming location in Silver City, New Mexico and driven 150 miles to El Paso, Texas. During the drive, she was repeatedly asked if she was a Communist and if her friends were Communists. &quot;She said she didn&#x27;t know, that she was just working on the picture, and she hummed. In El Paso she was kept under armed guard in a hotel room.&quot; As a result of her confinement, at least one scene was filmed by a Revueltas stand-in with her back to the camera. Esperanza&#x27;s voice-over narration had to be taped later in Mexico.

Revueltas was released from custody on March 6, 1953 and could return to Mexico, but she was never allowed to work in American films again. She once said that &quot;[s]ince [the INS] had no evidence to present of my &#x27;subversive&#x27; character, I can only conclude that I was &#x27;dangerous&#x27; because I had been playing a role that gave status and dignity to the character of a Mexican-American woman.&quot;

Due to the political climate, &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; was restricted to a very limited U.S. release and garnered almost no publicity. However, it did receive mild praise from Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He called it

While many people were blacklisted during McCarthyism in the 1950s, &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; was the only film to be blacklisted. Because it was largely unknown in North America for the first decade, Revueltas was not given full recognition for her acting achievement (note: she did win Best Actress in 1954 at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the former Czechoslovakia). Then, as a &quot;cult&quot; following for the film grew in the U.S. in the 1960s and &#x27;70s, Revueltas was appreciated more and more. For example, at a special Los Angeles screening in 1976, &quot;L.A. Times&quot; reviewer Linda Gross wrote about the movie&#x27;s cast of professional and non-professional actors: &quot;All perform exceedingly well. Miss Revueltas is stunning. Her portrayal is unforgettable.&quot; In the 1980s, public television began showing &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;; film critics and scholars began writing about it; the film was released on videocassette; and increasingly the general public started to see it. In 1992, nearly 40 years after being suppressed, it was inducted into the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Film Registry of significant U.S. films.

==Later years==
Barred from getting hired in the U.S. or Mexico, Revueltas moved to East Germany in 1957 and lived there for three years. While in East Germany, she worked with the Berliner Ensemble—the company of the late playwright Bertolt Brecht. She also acted on stage in Cuba where she starred in The Caucasian Chalk Circle in 1961.

She moved back to Mexico in the early 1960s and found herself in difficult financial straits. She taught dance and began to write plays. It was not until 1976 that she made her first film since being blacklisted, &quot;Mina, Viento de Libertad&quot; (&quot;Mina, Wind of Freedom&quot;). In that same year, she played Tía Licha in &quot;Lo Mejor de Teresa&quot; (&quot;The Best of Teresa&quot;). Her final film was &quot;Balun Canan&quot; (1977).

In 1979, she published the book &quot;Los Revueltas: Biografía de una familia&quot; (&quot;The Revueltas: Biography of a Family&quot;). At the 1982 premiere of &quot;A Crime to Fit the Punishment&quot;—a documentary about the making of &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;—she spoke about her blacklisting by the Mexican film industry. She appeared occasionally at film festivals, such as the 36th Berlin International Film Festival in 1986 where she served as one of the judges. At the 1988 Barcelona Film Festival, she sat on a panel with fellow blacklistees Jules Dassin, John Berry, and Walter Bernstein for a screening of &quot;The Front&quot; (1976).

In her later years, Revueltas made her home in Cuernavaca and taught dance and hatha yoga. When asked during an interview on Radio UNAM if she regretted taking the starring role in &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;, she replied:

==Death==
She died in Cuernavaca at age 85 on April 20, 1996, six months after having been diagnosed with lung cancer. She was survived by her son and grandchildren.

==Awards==
She won a Cuauhtémoc Award for her work in &quot;Un día de vida&quot;, and then a Best Supporting Actress honor at Mexico&#x27;s 1953 Ariel Awards for &quot;El rebozo de Soledad&quot;. In 1954, the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival conferred its Best Actress Award on Revueltas for &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 2000, the film &quot;One of the Hollywood Ten&quot; was released. Written and directed by Karl Francis, it&#x27;s a dramatization of Herbert Biberman&#x27;s blacklist experience, and includes a segment on &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; in which Revueltas is portrayed by actress Ángela Molina.

<doc id="302551" wikidata="Q1770089" url="?curid=302551" title="Frostating">
<text>Frostating () was one of the four ancient popular assemblies or things () of medieval Norway. Historically, it was the site of court and assembly for Trøndelag, Nordmøre, and Hålogaland. The assembly had its seat at Tinghaugen in what is now Frosta Municipality. It functioned as a judicial and legislative body, resolving disputes and establishing laws.

Frostating and Norway&#x27;s three other ancient regional assemblies, the Borgarting, Eidsivating, and Gulating, were joined into a single jurisdiction during the late 13th century, when King Magnus the Lawmender had the existing body of law put into writing.

==Tinghaugen==
Tinghaugen, from the Old Norse words meaning &#x27;assembly&#x27; and meaning &#x27;hill&#x27;, is close to the medieval church at Logtun. The site is represented by the Frostatinget bautasten at Tinghaugen. Frostating was arguably Norway&#x27;s oldest court, pre-dating the Viking Age. The Frostating had authority over the eight districts in Trøndelag including (Nordmøre and Fosen) and (Namdalen) and at a later time, it also included Hålogaland. When Norway was united as a kingdom, the existing (law assemblies) were constituted as superior regional assemblies, Frostating being one of them. These were representative assemblies at which delegates from the various districts in each region met to award legal judgments and pass laws.

==Magnus Lagabøtes landslov==

The first seeds of democratic evolution appeared in matters of law. When Norway was united as a kingdom, the four independent &quot;&quot; – Frostating, Gulating, Eidsivating, and Borgarting – were the most supreme bodies of law, acting as both legislative assemblies and courts. In 1274, with the consent of all , King Magnus the Lawmender (1238–1280) promulgated a new national law (), a unified code of laws for the Kingdom of Norway, which was exceptional of its time. With this, the Frostathing Law was replaced by the new law, significantly reducing the legislative power of the assembly, and centralising power in the realm.

A unified code of laws for a whole country had until then only been introduced in the Kingdom of Sicily in the &quot;Liber Augustalis&quot; promulgated in 1231 by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and the compiled during the reign of Alfonso X of Castile.

The law remained in force until Frederik III, king of the Denmark–Norway, promulgated absolute monarchy in 1660. This was codified in the King Act of 1665 which functioned as the Constitution of Norway of the Union of Denmark-Norway until 1814.

== Frostating seal ==
The Frostating seal () shows king Magnus the Lawmender seated on his throne and giving the lawman the new Frostating law () at the Frostating. The seal commemorates Magnus&#x27;s great effort to modernise the law-code. The representatives to the Thing—three deep—stand on the king&#x27;s left side. The king sits in the middle on his throne with a crown on his head and a scepter in his hand, and with the Norwegian lion under his foot. Below in the seal are two bowmen; one aiming at a squirrel while the other aims at a bird. Both the squirrel and the bird sit in trees. The original of the Frostating seal is in the &quot;Diplomatarium Norvegicum&quot;, a source collection of Norwegian letters and documents from earliest recorded history until 1570. The seal is found on a document dated 1 June 1453, in &quot;Dipl. Norv. VIII no. 349&quot;. A variation of this seal has lived on the coat of arms of Frosta.

<text>The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002, informally known as the Iraq Resolution, is a joint resolution passed by the United States Congress in October 2002 as Public Law No. 107-243, authorizing the use of the United States Armed Forces against Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq government in what would be known as Operation Iraqi Freedom.
==Contents==
The resolution cited many factors as justifying the use of military force against Iraq: 
* Iraq&#x27;s noncompliance with the conditions of the 1991 ceasefire agreement, including interference with U.N. weapons inspectors.
* Iraq &quot;continuing to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons capability&quot; and &quot;actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability&quot; posed a &quot;threat to the national security of the United States and international peace and security in the Persian Gulf region.&quot;
* Iraq&#x27;s &quot;brutal repression of its civilian population.&quot;
* Iraq&#x27;s &quot;capability and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction against other nations and its own people&quot;.
* Iraq&#x27;s hostility towards the United States as demonstrated by the 1993 assassination attempt on former President George H. W. Bush and firing on coalition aircraft enforcing the no-fly zones following the 1991 Gulf War.
* Members of al-Qaeda, an organization bearing responsibility for attacks on the United States, its citizens, and interests, including the attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, are known to be in Iraq.
* Iraq&#x27;s &quot;continu[ing] to aid and harbor other international terrorist organizations,&quot; including anti-United States terrorist organizations.
* Iraq paid bounty to families of suicide bombers.
* The efforts by the Congress and the President to fight terrorists, and those who aided or harbored them.
* The authorization by the Constitution and the Congress for the President to fight anti-United States terrorism.
* The governments in Israel, Turkey, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia feared Saddam and wanted him removed from power.
* Citing the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, the resolution reiterated that it should be the policy of the United States to remove the Saddam Hussein regime and promote a democratic replacement.
The resolution &quot;supported&quot; and &quot;encouraged&quot; diplomatic efforts by President George W. Bush to &quot;strictly enforce through the U.N. Security Council all relevant Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq&quot; and &quot;obtain prompt and decisive action by the Security Council to ensure that Iraq abandons its strategy of delay, evasion, and noncompliance and promptly and strictly complies with all relevant Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.&quot;

The resolution authorized President Bush to use the Armed Forces of the United States &quot;as he determines to be necessary and appropriate&quot; in order to &quot;defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions regarding Iraq.&quot;

==Passage==
An authorization by Congress was sought by President George W. Bush soon after his September 12, 2002 statement before the U.N. General Assembly asking for quick action by the Security Council in enforcing the resolutions against Iraq.

Of the legislation introduced by Congress in response to President Bush&#x27;s requests, sponsored by Sen. Daschle and Sen. Lott was based on the original White House proposal authorizing the use of force in Iraq, sponsored by Rep. Hastert and Rep. Gephardt and the substantially similar sponsored by Sen. Lieberman were modified proposals. sponsored by Rep. Hastings was a separate proposal never considered on the floor. Eventually, the Hastert–Gephardt proposal became the legislation Congress focused on.

==Legal challenges==
===U.S. law===
The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit refused to review the legality of the invasion in 2003, citing a lack of ripeness.

In early 2003, the Iraq Resolution was challenged in court to stop the invasion from happening. The plaintiffs argued that the President does not have the authority to declare war. The final decision came from a three-judge panel from the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit which dismissed the case. Judge Lynch wrote in the opinion that the Judiciary cannot intervene unless there is a fully developed conflict between the President and Congress or if Congress gave the President &quot;absolute discretion&quot; to declare war.

Similar efforts to secure judicial review of the invasion&#x27;s legality have been dismissed on a variety of justiciability grounds.

===International law===
The vast majority of international legal scholarship contended that the war was an illegal war of aggression, and United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan stated in 2004 that the invasion was illegal, and that it was &quot;not in conformity with the UN Charter&quot;.

====U.N. security council resolutions====
Debate about the legality of the 2003 invasion of Iraq under international law, centers around ambiguous language in parts of U.N. Resolution 1441 (2002). The U.N. Charter in Article 39 states: &quot;The Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security&quot;.

The position of the U.S. and U.K. is that the invasion was authorized by a series of U.N. resolutions dating back to 1990 and that since the U.N. security council has made no Article 39 finding of illegality, that no illegality exists.

Resolution 1441 declared that Iraq was in &quot;material breach&quot; of the cease-fire under U.N. Resolution 687 (1991), which required cooperation with weapons inspectors. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties states that under certain conditions, a party may invoke a &quot;material breach&quot; to suspend a multilateral treaty. Thus, the U.S. and U.K. claim that they used their right to suspend the cease-fire in Resolution 687 and to continue hostilities against Iraq under the authority of U.N. Resolution 678 (1990), which originally authorized the use of force after Iraq invaded Kuwait. This is the same argument that was used for Operation Desert Fox in 1998. They also contend that, while Resolution 1441 required the UNSC to assemble and assess reports from the weapons inspectors, it was not necessary for the UNSC to reach an agreement on the course of action. If, at that time, it was determined that Iraq breached Resolution 1441, the resolution did not &quot;constrain any member state from acting to defend itself against the threat posed by Iraq&quot;. The United States government argued, wholly apart from Resolution 1441, that it has a right of pre-emptive self-defense to protect itself from terrorism fomented by Iraq.

It remains unclear whether any party other than the Security Council can make the determination that Iraq breached Resolution 1441, as U.N. members commented that it is not up to one member state to interpret and enforce U.N. resolutions for the entire council. In addition, other nations have stated that a second resolution was required to initiate hostilities.

==Repeal==

On June 17, 2021, the House of Representatives voted for House Resolution 256, to repeal the 2002 resolution by a vote of 268–161. 219 House Democrats and 49 House Republicans voted to repeal, while 160 Republicans and 1 Democrat voted to oppose the repeal.

In July 2021, three Senators, Christopher Murphy, Mike Lee &amp; Bernie Sanders, introduced S.2391, the National Security Powers Act of 2021, which would have repealed previous war authorizations and established new procedures, but a Senator put a quasi-anonymous hold on it in committee until it was dead. Its companion in the House, H.R.5410, the National Security Reforms and Accountability Act, did not contain the repeal language (which prevented the Senators&#x27; attempt to repeal), and again, this companion bill was quasi-anonymously held in committee til it was dead.

On March 16, 2023, a bill (S. 316) to repeal the 1991 and 2002 AUMFs, introduced by Senators Tim Kaine and Todd Young, was advanced by the Senate by 68 votes to 27, but its companion, H.R.932, has been quasi-anonymously held by a Representative in the House Committee on Foreign Affairs since February 9, 2023.

On July 13, 2023, in a further attempt to repeal the 1991 and 2002 AUMFs, Tim Kaine &amp; Todd Young introduced S.Amdt.427 to S.2226, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024. But they didn&#x27;t timely propose it on the floor so that when the bill passed the Senate, no action was taken on their amendment &amp; it was therefore, by default, excluded by law. The POTUS remains authorized by Congress to strike at will, any targets of his choosing in Iraq.

<doc id="302560" wikidata="Q3715770" url="?curid=302560" title="Dublin Corporation">
<text>Dublin Corporation (), known by generations of Dubliners simply as The Corpo, is the former name of the city government and its administrative organisation in Dublin since the 1100s. Significantly re-structured in 1660–1661, even more significantly in 1840, it was modernised on 1 January 2002, as part of a general reform of local government in Ireland, and since then is known as Dublin City Council. This article deals with the history of municipal government in Dublin up to 31 December 2001. 
The long form of its name was The Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of the City of Dublin.

==History==
Dublin Corporation was established under the Anglo-Normans in the reign of Henry II of England in the 12th century.

===Two-chamber corporation===

For centuries it was a two-chamber body, made up of an upper house of 24 aldermen, who elected the Lord Mayor of Dublin from their number, and a lower house, known as the &quot;sheriffs and commons&quot;, consisting of up to 48 sheriffs peers (former sheriffs) and 96 representatives of the Guilds of the City of Dublin.

===19th-century reform===

The modern Dublin Corporation was restructured by late 19th-century and 20th-century legislation, particularly, the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840, with the elected body reduced to a single chamber &quot;Dublin City Council&quot;, presided over by the Lord Mayor of Dublin, an office first instituted but not filled by King Charles I and reconstituted following the Restoration of the Crown by King Charles II.

Queen Victoria refused to visit Ireland for a number of years, partly in protest at Dublin Corporation&#x27;s decision not to congratulate her son, Prince Albert Edward, The Prince of Wales, on both his marriage to Princess Alexandra of Denmark and on the birth of the royal couple&#x27;s oldest son, Prince Albert Victor.

===21st-century change of name===
On 1 January 2002, following a major reform of local government which also abolished the 300-year-old title of alderman in the Republic of Ireland and the 700-year-old title of &#x27;town clerk&#x27; in Dublin, the name of &quot;Dublin Corporation&quot; was changed to &quot;Dublin City Council&quot;, which previously had been used simply to refer to the assembly of elected councillors. The body had full corporate continuity but there were some boundary and other changes.

<doc id="302565" wikidata="Q11079254" url="?curid=302565" title="National Languages Committee">
<text>The National Languages Committee was established in 1919 by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China with the purpose of standardizing and popularizing the usage of Standard Chinese in the country. The committee was known in English as the Mandarin Promotion Council or the National Languages Promotion Committee until 2003, but the Chinese name has not changed. The phrase &quot;Guoyu&quot; ( &quot;National language&quot;) typically refers to Standard Chinese, but could also be interpreted as referring to &quot;national languages&quot;. The reorganization of the Executive Yuan made the duties of the National Languages Committee be transferred to the Department of Lifelong Education&#x27;s fourth sector (Reading and Language Education) from 2013.

It was created as the Preparatory Commission for the Unification of the National Language by the Republic (then still based in Nanjing) on 21 April 1919. On 12 December 1928, the commission was renamed to the Preparatory Committee for the Unification of the National Language, headed by Woo Tsin-hang and had 31 members. The committee was revived in 1983 as the Mandarin Promotion Council based on Taiwan.

The decisions reached by the Council include:
* Changing the first- and second-grade textbook titles from &quot;Guowen&quot; ( &quot;National Script&quot;) to &quot;Guoyu&quot; ( &quot;National language&quot;), on 24 January 1920
* Publishing the &quot;Guoyin Zidian&quot; ( &quot;National Pronunciation Dictionary&quot;) edited by Woo Tsin-hang, on 24 December 1920. The &quot;Guoyin Zidian&quot; later became the &quot;Mandarin Chinese Dictionary&quot; (), a comprehensive online and CD-ROM Traditional Chinese Mandarin dictionary.

The Committee for National Language Romanization () under the Council selects and modifies Romanization Systems. The official Mandarin romanization systems in the Republic of China have been:
* Gwoyeu Romatzyh (1928–1984)
* Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II (1984–2002)
* Tongyong Pinyin (2002–2008)
* Hanyu Pinyin (starting on 1 January 2009)

Since the Taiwanization movement took hold in government, the committee also handles:
* Researching mainland China Mandarin
* Researching the Formosan languages
* Researching other varieties of Chinese or languages like Hakka and Taiwanese Hokkien

<doc id="302577" wikidata="Q182736" url="?curid=302577" title="Ivan Lendl">
<text>Ivan Lendl (; born March 7, 1960) is a Czech-American former professional tennis player and coach. Widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time, he was ranked as the world No. 1 in men&#x27;s singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 270 weeks (fourth-most of all time), and finished as the year-end No. 1 four times. Lendl won 94 career singles titles, including eight majors (three each at the French Open and US Open, and two at the Australian Open) and seven year-end championships. He was runner-up at a further eleven majors and contested a record eight consecutive US Open finals.

Lendl is the only man in professional tennis history to have a match winning percentage of over 90% in five different years (1982, 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1989). He leads the head-to-head against his two biggest rivals, with a 22–13 record against Jimmy Connors and a 21–15 record against John McEnroe. Lendl&#x27;s dominance of his era was most evident at the year-end championships, where he holds a win–loss record of 39–10 and contested the final a record nine consecutive times.

Commonly referred to as the &#x27;Father Of Modern Tennis&#x27; and &#x27;The Father Of The Inside-Out Forehand&#x27;, Lendl pioneered a new style of tennis; his game was built around his forehand, hit hard and with a heavy topspin, and his success is cited as a primary influence in popularizing the now-common playing style of aggressive baseline power tennis. After retirement, he became a tennis coach for several players; in particular, he helped Andy Murray win three majors and reach the world No. 1 ranking.

==Tennis career==

===Early life and career===
Lendl was born into a tennis family in Ostrava, Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic). His parents were top players in Czechoslovakia, and his mother Olga, born Jeništová, was at one point ranked the No. 2 female player in the country.

Lendl first came to the tennis world&#x27;s attention as a junior player. In 1978, he won the boys&#x27; singles titles at both the French Open and Wimbledon and was the world No. 1 ranked junior player.

Lendl turned professional in 1978. After reaching his first top-level singles final in 1979, he won seven singles titles in 1980, including three tournament wins in three consecutive weeks. Lendl was part of Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Davis Cup winning team that year. He was the driving force behind the country&#x27;s team in the first half of the 1980s, and was also part of the Czechoslovak team that won the World Team Cup in 1981 and was runner-up in 1984 and 1985. However, he stopped playing in these events after he moved to the United States in 1986 because Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Tennis Association viewed him as an &quot;illegal defector&quot; from their country.

The success continued in 1981, as he won ten titles, including his first season-ending Masters Grand Prix tour title, defeating Vitas Gerulaitis in five sets. He relocated to the United States in 1981, first living at the home of mentor and friend, Wojtek Fibak.

In 1982, he won 15 of the 23 singles tournaments he entered and had a 44-match winning streak.

Lendl competed on the World Championship Tennis (WCT) tour, where he won all ten tournaments he entered, including his first WCT Finals, where he defeated John McEnroe in straight sets. He faced McEnroe again in the Masters Grand Prix final and won in straight sets to claim his second season-ending championship of the WCT. In an era when tournament prize money was rising sharply due to the competition between two circuits (Grand Prix and WCT), Lendl&#x27;s title victories quickly made him the highest-earning tennis player of all time.

Lendl won another seven tournaments in 1983; however, he had not won any Grand Slam titles in the early years of his career. He reached his first Grand Slam final at the French Open in 1981, where he lost in five sets to Björn Borg. Lendl&#x27;s second came at the US Open in 1982, where he was defeated by Jimmy Connors, not being able to cope &quot;with Connors&#x27; penetrating, sharply-angled groundstrokes into the corners, or his net-charging attacks&quot;. In 1983, he was the runner-up at the Australian Open (to Mats Wilander) and the US Open (to Connors).

In July 1983, Lendl played three exhibition matches (against Johan Kriek, Kevin Curren, and Jimmy Connors) in Sun City, South Africa, in the apartheid-era bantustan of Bophuthatswana. The Czechoslovak Sport Federation (ČSTV), controlled by the Communist Party, expelled him from the Czechoslovak Davis Cup team and fined him $150,000. Lendl disputed the punishment and the fine.

===Prime years===

In 1984, Lendl bought his own house in Greenwich, Connecticut. Lendl&#x27;s first Grand Slam title came at the 1984 French Open, where he defeated McEnroe in a long final. Down two sets to love, and trailing 4–2 in the third set, Lendl came back to claim the title 3–6, 2–6, 6–4, 7–5, 7–5. McEnroe subsequently beat Lendl in straight sets in both finals of the US Open 1984 and Volvo Masters 1984 (played in January 1985).

Lendl lost in the final of the 1985 French Open to Mats Wilander. He then faced McEnroe again in the final of the US Open, winning in straight sets. He reached the WCT Finals for the second and last time, defeating Tim Mayotte in three sets. He also won the Masters Grand Prix title for the third time, defeating Boris Becker in straight sets. He was upset by 19-year old and No. 6 Stefan Edberg in the semifinals of the 1985 Australian Open in an epic spread over two days.

Lendl won the French Open title in 1986, beating Mikael Pernfors in the final. He reached the Wimbledon final for the first time, but lost to Boris Becker in straight sets. At the US Open, Lendl beat Edberg in straight sets in the semi finals and Miloslav Mecir in straight sets in the final. Lendl beat Becker in straight sets in the season-ending Masters.

Lendl lost in the 1987 Australian Open semi finals to Pat Cash. He won the French Open, beating Wilander in a four-set final that finished in semi-darkness and pouring rain. At Wimbledon he beat Edberg in the semi finals in four sets before losing in straight sets to Cash in the final. In the US Open final, Lendl was suffering from influenza, but outlasted Wilander in a match lasting 4 hours and 47 minutes (the longest singles final in the tournaments history, surpassed the following year). Lendl won the Masters Grand Prix championship title in three sets over Wilander. This took him to his fifth and last Grand Prix year-end tour title.

In each year from 1985 through 1987, Lendl&#x27;s match-winning percentage was over 90%. This record was equalled by Roger Federer in 2004–2006, but Lendl remains the only male tennis player with over 90% match wins in five different years (1982 was the first, 1989 the last). From the 1985 US Open to the 1988 Australian Open, Lendl reached ten consecutive Grand Slam singles semifinals — a record that was broken by Federer at the 2007 Australian Open.

In 1988 Lendl reached just one Grand Slam final, losing the US Open final to Wilander in five sets in 4 hours 54 minutes (the longest US singles final to that point). Lendl began 1989 by winning his first Australian Open title with a straight sets final victory over Miloslav Mečíř, and went on to win 10 titles out of 17 tournaments he entered. He lost the US Open final to Becker, which was the last of eight consecutive US Open finals that Lendl contested. Lendl successfully defended his Australian Open title in 1990 when Edberg retired in the final.

The only Grand Slam singles title Lendl never managed to win was Wimbledon. In 1990, Lendl put in intensive efforts to train and improve his grass court game. He switched to a larger headed racket and skipped the 1990 French Open in order to spend more time practising on grass. He won the Queen&#x27;s Club Championships, with comfortable straight-set victories over McEnroe in the semi-final and Becker in the final, but was unable to reproduce this form at Wimbledon, and although he reached the semi-finals for the seventh time in eight years, he looked &quot;tight and inhibited&quot; in losing to eventual champion Stefan Edberg in straight sets.

===Later career===
Lendl remained near the top of the rankings in 1991. He skipped the French Open again to focus on Wimbledon, but lost in the third round against David Wheaton, and was never to win the Wimbledon title. The Australian Open in January that year, where he lost in four sets to Becker, was his last Grand Slam final.

Lendl was well known for his meticulous and intensive training and physical conditioning regime, and his scientific approach to preparation and playing. As part of his preparations for the US Open, he hired the same workers who laid the hardcourt surfaces at Flushing Meadows each year to install an exact copy in the grounds of his home in Greenwich, Connecticut.

Lendl announced his retirement from professional tennis on December 21, 1994, aged 34, due to chronic back pain. His last professional match prior to that had been his defeat in the second round of the US Open in 1994, three and a half months earlier.

Lendl won a career total of 94 ATP singles titles (plus 57 other non-ATP tournaments, a total of 151 singles titles) and 6 doubles titles, and his career total prize money of U.S. $21,262,417 was a record at the time. In 2001, he was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

===Return to the court===
On April 10, 2010, Lendl returned to play in the Caesars Tennis Classic exhibition match in Atlantic City, New Jersey, against his rival from the late 1980s, Mats Wilander, his first tournament since his retirement in 1994. He lost the one-set match 3–6.

On February 28, 2011, Lendl returned to the court again in an exhibition match against McEnroe at Madison Square Garden in New York City. It was planned to be a one-set, first-to-eight event. However, McEnroe, leading 6–3, injured his ankle and had to retire from the match.

In May 2012, Lendl played in Prague in the 2012 Sparta Prague Open tournament. He defeated fellow Czech Jiří Novák in the exhibition match.

===Coaching career===
On December 31, 2011, Lendl was appointed to coach Andy Murray. Lendl has been credited with improving Murray&#x27;s maturity and consistency, guiding him to his first two Grand Slam victories in the 2012 US Open and 2013 Wimbledon Championships. On winning the US Open in 2012, Murray became the second player in the Open Era, after Lendl, to have lost their first four Grand Slam finals, and won the fifth. On March 19, 2014, it was announced that Lendl and Murray would be ending their two-year coaching partnership.

On June 12, 2016, Lendl rejoined Andy Murray&#x27;s coaching team. By the end of 2016, Murray had become world No. 1, having won his second Wimbledon title, third major championship overall, second Olympic gold medal in singles, and his first ATP World Tour Finals title, defeating Novak Djokovic.

In August 2018, Lendl joined Alexander Zverev&#x27;s team. They split up in July 2019 due to disappointing results in 2019 and personal differences. Zverev has stated that Lendl was more interested in his dog or his golf game than in professional coaching.

He is currently coaching Hubert Hurkacz since November 2024.

==Playing style==
Nicknamed &quot;The Terminator&quot; and &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot;, Lendl&#x27;s Tennis Hall of Fame biography states: &quot;As a professional Lendl’s strength and power was the difference maker. It was earned by a fanatical work ethic, countless hours bashing balls on the tennis court, and even more hours pumping iron in the weight room. Despite his size, Lendl never fancied the serve-and-volley game, though he used it effectively when necessary. He was a punishing baseliner, hitting a heavy topspin forehand – though tight and flat compared to high and looping – and he had one of the most aggressive, relentless backcourt games that tennis has ever seen. His fitness was beyond reproach.&quot;

==Equipment==
At the beginning of his professional career, Lendl used Adidas clothing and Kneissl rackets, subsequently changing to Adidas rackets. Toward the end of his days on the ATP tour, Lendl ended his long-term clothing, shoe, and racket deal with Adidas. He signed with Mizuno, and finally began to play with a mid-sized racket very similar to the Adidas racket he had used throughout most of his career.

==Awards and recognition==
Lendl was the International Tennis Federation&#x27;s World Champion on four occasions (1985, 1986, 1987, 1990) and the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) Player of The Year three times (1985, 1986, 1987). Earlier in his career, he was also named ATP Most Improved Player, in 1981.

Due to his achievements, Lendl is often considered among the greatest tennis players in the sport&#x27;s history. In his book &quot;Modern Encyclopedia of Tennis&quot;, Bud Collins included Lendl in his list of the greatest men&#x27;s tennis players of the period 1946–1992. &quot;Tennis&quot; magazine described Lendl as &quot;the game&#x27;s greatest overachiever&quot; in its 40th anniversary series. In 1986, North Korea issued a postage stamp featuring Lendl.

==Personal life==
===US citizenship===
Lendl successfully applied for a U.S. Permanent Resident Card in 1987, hoping to obtain U.S. citizenship in time to represent the US in the 1988 Olympic Games and in the Davis Cup. A bill in Congress to bypass the traditional five-year waiting procedure was rejected in 1988 because Czechoslovak authorities refused to provide the necessary waivers. He became a U.S. citizen on July 7, 1992.

===Family===
On September 16, 1989, six days after competing in the final of the US Open versus Boris Becker, Lendl married Samantha Frankel. They have five daughters: Marika, twins Isabelle and Caroline, Daniela, and Nikola. Two of his daughters (Marika and Isabelle) were members of the University of Florida Women&#x27;s Golf Team. Daniela was a member of the University of Alabama Women&#x27;s Golf Team. His daughter Caroline was a part of the University of Alabama Women&#x27;s Rowing Team for the 2011–2012 academic year, and his daughter Nikola was an instructor at SoulCycle.

===Other activities===
After finishing his tennis career in 1994, Lendl took up golf, reaching a handicap of 0 and achieving a win on the Celebrity Tour. Lendl has played in the Gary Player Invitational charity Pro-Am several times, and organized a charity competition in 2004 called the Ivan Lendl Celebrity Golf Tournament. Still competitive at the mini-tour levels, Lendl now spends much of his time managing his daughters&#x27; golfing careers.

Lendl had a nearly complete collection of posters by Alfons Mucha. The collection was exhibited in Prague in 2013. He sold the collection in 2014 to Czech businessman Richard Fuxa for 3.5 million dollars.

In December 2024, it was announced that Lendl would compete in a professional pickleball event at the PPA Tour&#x27;s Daytona Beach Open in the 5.0 50+ category.

<doc id="302587" wikidata="Q982244" url="?curid=302587" title="Mad Mike Hoare">
<text>Thomas Michael &quot;Mad Mike&quot; Hoare (17 March 1919 – 2 February 2020) was a British-Irish military officer and mercenary who fought during the Simba rebellion and was involved in carrying out the 1981 Seychelles coup d&#x27;état attempt.

==Early life and military career==
Hoare was born on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day in India in Calcutta to Irish parents. His father was a river pilot. At the age of eight he was sent to school in England to Margate College and then commenced training for accountancy and, as he was not able to attend Sandhurst, he joined the Territorial Army. Hoare&#x27;s childhood hero was Sir Francis Drake. Aged 20 he joined the London Irish Rifles at the beginning of the Second World War, later he then joined the 2nd Reconnaissance Regiment of the Royal Armoured Corps as a 2nd lieutenant and fought in the Arakan Campaign in Burma and at the Battle of Kohima in India. He was promoted to the rank of major. In 1945, he married Elizabeth Stott in New Delhi, with whom he had three children. 

After the war, he completed his training as a chartered accountant, qualifying in 1948. Hoare found life in London boring and decided to move to South Africa. He subsequently emigrated to Durban, Natal Province in the Union of South Africa where he later managed safaris and became a soldier-for-hire in various African countries. In Durban, Hoare was restless and sought adventures by marathon walking, riding a motorcycle from Cape Town to Cairo and seeking the rumoured Lost City of the Kalahari in the Kalahari desert. By the early 1960s, Hoare was extremely bored with his life as an accountant, and yearned to return to the life of a soldier, resulting in his interest in becoming a mercenary.

== Congo Crisis (1961–65) ==
Hoare commanded two separate mercenary groups during the Congo Crisis.

=== Katanga ===
Hoare&#x27;s first mercenary action was in 1961 in Katanga, a province trying to rebel from the newly independent Republic of the Congo. His unit was named &quot;4 Commando&quot;. Hoare relished the macho camaraderie of war, telling one journalist &quot;you can&#x27;t win a war with choirboys&quot;.

During this time he married Phyllis Sims, an airline stewardess.

=== Simba rebellion ===
In 1964, Congolese Prime Minister Moïse Tshombe, his employer in Katanga, hired Hoare to command a military unit named 5 Commando, &quot;Armée Nationale Congolaise&quot; 5 Commando, later commanded by John Peters; composed of about 300 men, most of whom were from South Africa (not to be confused with No.5 Commando, the British Second World War commando force). His second-in-command was a fellow ex-British Army officer, Commandant Alistair Wicks. The unit&#x27;s mission was to fight a revolt known as the Simba rebellion. Tshombe distrusted General Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, the commander of the &quot;Armée Nationale Congolaise&quot; who had already commanded two coups, and preferred to keep the Congolese Army weak even during the Simba rebellion. Hence, Tshombe used mercenaries who had already fought for him in Katanga to provide a professional military force.
To recruit his force, Hoare placed newspaper advertisements in Johannesburg and Salisbury (modern Harare, Zimbabwe) for physically fit white men capable of marching 20 miles per day who were fond of combat and were &quot;tremendous romantics&quot; to join 5 Commando. The moniker Mad Mike which was given to him by the British press suggested a &quot;wildman&quot; type of commander, but in fact Hoare was very strict and insisted the men of 5 Commando always be clean-shaven, keep their hair cut short, never swear and attend church services every Sunday. The men of 5 Commando were entirely white and consisted of a &quot;ragbag of misfits&quot; upon whom he imposed stern discipline. 5 Commando was a mixture of South Africans, Rhodesians, British, Belgians, Irish and Germans, the last of whom were mostly Second World War veterans who had arrived in the Congo wearing Iron Crosses. Racist views towards blacks were very common in 5 Commando, but in press interviews, Hoare denied allegations of atrocities against the Congolese. 

Despite his denials, an observer stated &quot;anything black was killed indiscriminately, blindly&quot; by Hoare&#x27;s mercenaries. Hoare himself told journalists &quot;Killing communists is like killing vermin. Killing African nationalists is like killing animals. I don’t like either of them. My men and I killed between five and ten thousand Congolese rebels during the twenty months I spent in the Congo&quot;.

To the press, Hoare insisted that the 5 Commando were not mercenaries, but rather &quot;volunteers&quot; who were waging an idealistic struggle against Communism in the Congo. Tshombe paid the men of 5 Commando a sum of money equal to $1,100 U.S dollars per month. Hoare always argued that he was a &quot;romantic&quot; who was fighting in the Congo for martial &quot;glory&quot;, and insisted that for him the money was irrelevant. Whatever may have been Hoare&#x27;s motivation, his men showed rapacious greed in the Congo, being noted for their looting and a tendency to steal equipment from the United Nations forces in the Congo. Due to his pride in his Irish heritage, Hoare adopted a flying goose as the symbol of 5 Commando and called his men the Wild Geese after the famous Irish soldiers who fought for the Stuarts in exile during the 17th and 18th centuries. Hoare was known for coolness and courage under fire as he believed that the best way to inspire his men, some of whom wilted under fire, was to command from the front. He put a stop to a mutiny among his commandoes by pistol-whipping the commander of the mutiny.

Hoare brought his men south and then turned north in a swiftly moving offensive, assisted with aircraft flown by Cuban emigres. A particular specialty for Hoare was hijacking boats to take up the river Congo as he began rescuing hostages from the Simbas. The Simbas were badly disciplined, poorly trained, and often not armed with modern weapons, and for all these reasons, the well-armed, trained, and disciplined 5 Commando had a great effect on the Simba rebellion. The British journalist A.J. Venter who covered the Congo crisis wrote as Hoare advanced, &quot;the fighting grew progressively more brutal&quot; with few prisoners taken. Hoare&#x27;s advance was aided by the fact that the roads in the Congo remaining from Belgian colonial rule were still usable in 1964-65. Hoare&#x27;s men tended to collect the heads of Simbas and stick them to the sides of their jeeps.   

Later Hoare and his mercenaries worked in concert with Belgian paratroopers, Cuban exile pilots, and CIA-hired mercenaries who attempted to save 1,600 civilians (mostly Europeans and missionaries) in Stanleyville (modern Kisangani, Congo) from the Simba rebels in Operation Dragon Rouge. Hoare and the 5 Commando are estimated to have saved the lives of 2,000 Europeans taken hostage by the Simbas, which made him famous around the world. Many of the hostages had been so badly treated as to barely resemble humans, which added to the fame of Hoare, who was presented in the Western press as a hero. He wrote about Stanleyville as occupied by the Simbas: &quot;The mayor of Stanleyville, Sylvere Bondekwe, a greatly respected and powerful man, was forced to stand naked before a frenzied crowd of Simbas while one of them cut out his liver.&quot; About Operation Dragon Rouge, he wrote: &quot;Taking Stanleyville was the greatest achievement of the Wild Geese. There is only so much 300 men can do, but here we were, part of a very big push and clearing the rebels out of Stan was a major victory for our side.&quot; Hoare did not stop his men from sacking Stanleyville as the 5 Commando blew open the vaults of every bank and confiscated the alcohol in every tavern in the city.

Hoare was later promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the &quot;Armée Nationale Congolaise&quot; (ANC) and 5 Commando expanded into a two-battalion force. Hoare commanded 5 Commando from July 1964 to November 1965. After completing his service, he told the media that he estimated that 5 Commando had killed between 5,000-10,000 Simbas. The Simbas had been advised by Cuban officers, and one of them was the Argentine Communist revolutionary Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara, which caused Hoare to claim he was the first man to have defeated Che Guevara.   

Speaking on the conflict, he said, &quot;I had wanted nothing so much as to have 5 Commando known as an integral part of the ANC, a 5 Commando destined to strike a blow to rid the Congo of the greatest cancer the world has ever known—the creeping, insidious disease of communism&quot;. 

Later, Hoare wrote his own account of 5 Commando&#x27;s role in the 1960s Congo mercenary war, originally titled &quot;Congo Mercenary&quot; and much later repeatedly republished in paperback simply as &quot;Mercenary&quot; (subtitled &quot;The Classic Account of Mercenary Warfare&quot;). The exploits of Hoare and 5 Commando in the Congo were much celebrated for decades afterward and helped contribute significantly to the glorification of the mercenary lifestyle by magazines such as &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; together with many pulp novels that featured heroes clearly modeled after Hoare. The popular image of mercenaries fighting in Africa from the 1960s to the present is that of a macho adventurers defiantly living life on their own terms together with much drinking and womanizing mixed with perilous adventures.

==&quot;The Wild Geese&quot;==
During the mid-1970s, Hoare was hired as technical adviser for the movie &quot;The Wild Geese&quot;, the fictional story of a group of mercenary soldiers hired to rescue a deposed African president who resembled Tshombe while the central African nation the story was set in resembled the Congo. The character &quot;Colonel Allen Faulkner&quot; (played by Richard Burton) was modelled on Hoare. At least one of the actors of the movie, Ian Yule, had been a mercenary commanded by Hoare, before which he had served in the British Parachute Regiment and Special Air Service (SAS). Of the actors playing mercenaries, four were born in Africa, two were former POWs, and most had received military training.

In an interview, Hoare praised &quot;The Wild Geese&quot; as an authentic picture of the mercenary lifestyle in Africa saying: &quot;In a good mercenary outfit, they&#x27;re all there because they want to be. All right, the motive is probably the high money they earn, but they all want to do it. They&#x27;re all volunteers&quot;. The movie&#x27;s message that Africa needed pro-Western politicians like Tshombe and that mercenaries who fought for such politicians were heroes seemed to represent Hoare&#x27;s influence.

== Seychelles affair (1981) and subsequent conviction ==
=== Background ===
In 1978, Seychelles exiles in South Africa, acting on behalf of ex-president James Mancham, discussed with South African Government officials the possibility of a coup d&#x27;état against the new president France-Albert René, who had &quot;promoted&quot; himself from prime minister while Mancham was out of the country. The idea was considered favorably by some in Washington, D.C., due to the United States&#x27; concerns over access to its new military base on Diego Garcia island, the necessity to move operations from the Seychelles to Diego Garcia, and the determination that René was not someone who would be in favour of the United States.

=== Preparation ===
Associates of Mancham contacted Hoare, then in South Africa as a civilian resident, who eventually raised a force of 43 - 55 men including ex-South African Special Forces (Recces), former Rhodesian soldiers, and ex-Congo mercenaries.

During November 1981, Hoare dubbed them &quot;Ye Ancient Order of Froth Blowers&quot; (AOFB) after a charitable English social club of the 1920s. In order for the plan to work, he disguised the mercenaries as a rugby club, and hid AK-47s in the bottom of their luggage, as he explained in his book &quot;The Seychelles Affair&quot;:
We were a Johannesburg beer-drinking club. We met formally once a week in our favourite pub in Braamfontein. We played Rugby. Once a year we organised a holiday for our members. We obtained special charter rates. Last year we went to Mauritius. In the best traditions of the original AOFB we collected toys for underprivileged kids and distributed them to orphanages ... I made sure the toys were as bulky as possible and weighed little. Rugger footballs were ideal. These were packed in the special baggage above the false bottom to compensate for the weight of the weapon.
=== Fighting ===
The fighting started prematurely when one of Hoare&#x27;s men accidentally got into the &quot;something to declare&quot; line at which the customs officer insisted on searching his bag. The rifles were well-concealed in the false-bottomed kitbags; however, one rifle was found and a customs officer sounded the alarm. One of Hoare&#x27;s men pulled his own, disassembled AK-47 from the concealed compartment in the luggage, assembled it, loaded it and shot the escaping customs man before he could reach the other side of the building. 

The plan for the coup proceeded despite this set-back with one team of Hoare&#x27;s men attempting to capture a barracks. Fighting ensued at the airport and during the middle of this, an Air India jet (Flight 224) landed at the airport, damaging a flap on one of the trucks strewn on the runway. Hoare managed to negotiate a ceasefire before the aircraft and passengers were caught in the crossfire. After several hours, the mercenaries found themselves in an unfavorable position and some wanted to depart on the aircraft, which needed fuel. Hoare conceded and the captain of the aircraft allowed them aboard after Hoare had found fuel for the aircraft. 

On board, Hoare asked the captain why he had landed when he had been informed of the fighting, to which the pilot responded once the aircraft had started to descend he did not have enough fuel to climb the aircraft back to cruising altitude and still make his destination. Hoare&#x27;s men still had their weapons and Hoare asked the captain if he would allow the door to be opened so they could ditch the weapons over the sea before they returned to South Africa, but the captain laughed at Hoare&#x27;s out-of-date knowledge on how pressurized aircraft functioned, telling him it would not be at all possible.

=== Investigation and trial ===
Six of the mercenary soldiers stayed behind on the islands; four were convicted of treason in the Seychelles.

In January 1982 an International Commission, appointed by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 496, inquired into the attempted coup d&#x27;état. The UN report concluded that South African defence agencies were involved, including supplying weapons and ammunition.

Being associated with the South African security services, the hijackers were initially charged with kidnapping, which carries no minimum sentence, but this was upgraded to hijacking after international pressure.

Hoare was found guilty of aeroplane hijacking and sentenced to ten years in prison. In total, 42 of the 43 alleged hijackers were convicted. One of the mercenaries, an American veteran of the Vietnam War, was found not guilty of hijacking, as he had been seriously wounded in the firefight and was loaded aboard while sedated. Many of the other mercenaries, including the youngest of the group, Raif St Clair, were quietly released after serving three months of their six-month terms in their own prison wing. Hoare spent 33 months in prison until released after a Christmas Presidential amnesty. During his 33 months in prison, Hoare consoled himself by memorising Shakespeare.

=== Aftermath ===
Hoare was a chartered accountant and member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Previously the Institute had said it could not expel him despite protests from members as he had committed no offence and paid his membership dues. His imprisonment allowed the ICAEW to expel him from membership in 1983. 

Hoare&#x27;s account of the Seychelles operation, &quot;The Seychelles Affair&quot;, was markedly critical of the South African establishment. In 2013, he published his seventh book, a historical novel entitled &quot;The Last Days of the Cathars&quot; about the medieval persecution of the Cathars in the south-west of France. During his last decades, Hoare had extensively studied the beliefs of the Cathars.

== Personal life ==
Hoare married Elizabeth Stott in New Delhi in 1945 and together they had three children, Chris, Tim and Geraldine.

He quit accountancy and managed a motor car business. In 1954, he motorcycled across Africa from Cape Town to Cairo. In 1959 he established a safari business in the Kalahari and the Okavango delta. A keen sailor, he had a yacht in Durban, then later bought a 23-metre Baltic trader named &quot;Sylvia&quot; in which he sailed the Western Mediterranean for three years with his family and wrote a book about the travels.

After divorcing in 1960, he married airline stewardess Phyllis Sims in 1961 and they had two children, Michael Jeremy and Simon.

Irish-South African novelist Bree O&#x27;Mara (1968–2010) was his niece. She wrote an account of Hoare&#x27;s adventures as a mercenary in the Congo, which remained unpublished at the time of her death on Afriqiyah Airways Flight 771.

Hoare&#x27;s son Chris Hoare wrote a biography on his father, titled &quot;&#x27;Mad Mike&#x27; Hoare: The Legend.&quot;

===Death===
Hoare died of natural causes at a care facility in Durban, on 2 February 2020, at the age of 100.

<doc id="302593" wikidata="Q5152751" url="?curid=302593" title="Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation">
<text>The Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation was established by the Republic of China in 1913 in order to address several aspects of Chinese language reform—including selecting an official phonetic transcription system for Mandarin Chinese, as well as standardizing pronunciations for basic Chinese characters. Delegates representing every Chinese province deliberated on the merits of numerous systems, ultimately selecting the design of Zhang Binglin (1869–1936). Zhang&#x27;s system would serve as the prototype for bopomofo, and would be officially adopted by the Republican government in 1918.

== History ==
It was decided in a draft on 7 August 1912, a month after a July 10 conference led by Cai Yuanpei, that a set of phonetic symbols were to be used for education purposes. The commission was set up in December and chaired by Wu Zhihui. The Commission ended on 22 May 1913. Wu would later chair the Mandarin Promotion Council.

== Members ==
The first meeting took place on 15 February 1913 in Beijing, with 44 delegates. The chairman was Wu; vice-chairman Wang Zhao. There were two representatives per each of the 26 provinces. The Tibetans, the Mongolians and the overseas Chinese each had one representative. Prominent members included:
* Cai Zhang ()
* Chen Suiyi ()
* Gao Kunnan ()
* Hu Yuren ()
* Li Liangcai ()
* Liu Zishan ()
* Lu Zhuangzhang
* Ma Tiqian ()
* Wang Rongbao ()
* Wang Sui ()
* Wang Yi&#x27;an ()
* Xing Dao ()
* Yang Qu ()
* Yang Zenghao ()

== Phonetic symbols ==
There were three main ideas of how the phonetic symbols should be:
* Using certain complete Chinese characters to symbolize other characters of the same sound
** Supporters included Wang Zhao, Wang Rongbao, Wang Yi&#x27;an, and Cai.
* Using Latin alphabet letters
** Supporters included Yang Zenghao and Liu
* Using non-existent symbols
** Supporters included Wu, Lu, Ma, Li, Xing, Wang Sui, Hu, Yang Qu, Gao, Chen, and Zheng.

The three groups discussed for two months and adopted 15 symbols from Zhang Binglin&#x27;s all-Zhuanshu Jiyin Zimu (), which was the proposal by the Zhejiang Committee. Jiyin Zimu was renamed to Zhuyin Fuhao.

After its proclamation, several aspects of Zhuyin were further modified, including:
* Rearranging the order of the symbols
* Adding ㄜ (Pinyin &quot;e&quot;)
* ㄦ, originally just &quot;r&quot;, was now also &quot;er&quot; (a retroflex vowel)
* The three dialectal symbols — ㄪ (v), ㄫ (ng) and ㄬ (gn) — were deleted, but are still to be found in Unicode Bopomofo (U+3105–U+312C).
* The tone system was modified

== Programs ==
The commission established the Seven Mandarin Sound Promotion Programs (; Guoyu Tuixing Fangfa Qi Tiao):
# Proclaimed Zhuyin Zimu. [On 23 November 1918]
# All provinces were to establish places to promote and study the 6500 standardized Mandarin sounds (), where the county representatives would gather and return to their counties to spread the words. [Established in 1920, along with Summer Mandarin Seminars ()]
# Using the gramophone to record the exact pronunciation. [Recorded in 1920]
# Having Mandarin be a compulsory subject in all elementary school. [Implemented in 19??]
# All teachers were to speak solely in Mandarin in elementary and middle schools. [Implemented in 19??]
# All textbooks and some official documents were to be annotated by Zhuyin. [Implemented in 19??]

<text>The Vombatiformes are one of the three suborders of the large marsupial order Diprotodontia. Seven of the nine known families within this suborder are extinct; only the families Phascolarctidae, with the koala, and Vombatidae, with three extant species of wombat, survive.

Among the extinct families are the Diprotodontidae, which includes the rhinoceros sized &quot;Diprotodon&quot;, believed to be the largest marsupials ever, as well as the &quot;marsupial lions&quot; Thylacoleonidae and &quot;marsupial tapirs&quot; Palorchestidae.

<doc id="302599" wikidata="Q954951" url="?curid=302599" title="Enciso, La Rioja">
<text>Enciso is a small municipality (pop. 159 (2007)) in the southern part of La Rioja, Spain, near Arnedo. The main village rises is located above the Cidacos River.

Numerous trace fossils of dinosaurs have been found in the area and there is a museum specialized in paleontology in Enciso. The dinosaur has become an emblematic animal of this town.

==Demography==
Enciso has been steadily losing permanent population. From a total of 1,237 inhabitants in 1900, it had only 159 in the 2009 census.

==Villages==
Enciso&#x27;s municipal term encompasses several smaller populated places, including Navalsaz. Located on a bend of the river, almost depopulated Las Ruedas de Enciso is a popular place for hikers and sightseers.

<doc id="302600" wikidata="Q900804" url="?curid=302600" title="Gyromitra esculenta">
<text>Gyromitra esculenta is an ascomycete fungus from the genus &quot;Gyromitra&quot;, widely distributed across Europe and North America. It normally fruits in sandy soils under coniferous trees in spring and early summer. The fruiting body, or mushroom, is an irregular brain-shaped cap, dark brown in colour, that can reach high and wide, perched on a stout white stipe up to high.

Although potentially fatal if eaten raw (causing restrictions on its sales in some areas), &quot;G. esculenta&quot; is still commonly parboiled for consumption, being a popular delicacy in Europe and the upper Great Lakes region of North America; evidence suggests that thorough cooking does not eliminate all traces of mycotoxins. When consumed, the principal active mycotoxin, gyromitrin, is hydrolyzed into the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine, which affects the liver, central nervous system, and sometimes the kidneys. Symptoms of poisoning involve vomiting and diarrhea several hours after consumption, followed by dizziness, lethargy and headache. Severe cases may lead to delirium, coma, and death after five to seven days.

The fungus was first described in 1800, by mycologist Christian Hendrik Persoon, as &quot;Helvella esculenta&quot;, and gained its current accepted binomial name when the Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries placed it in the genus &quot;Gyromitra&quot; in 1849. The genus name is derived from the Greek terms &quot;gyros&quot;/γυρος &quot;round&quot; and &quot;mitra&quot;/μιτρα &quot;headband&quot;. Its specific epithet is derived from the Latin &quot;esculentus&quot;, &quot;edible&quot;.

It is known by a variety of common descriptive names such as &quot;brain mushroom&quot;, &quot;turban fungus&quot;, &quot;elephant ears&quot;, or &quot;beefsteak mushroom/morel&quot;, although &quot;beefsteak mushroom&quot; can also refer to the much choicer edible basidiomycete &quot;Fistulina hepatica&quot;. Dating from the 19th century, the German term is a result of the older , itself from the 18th century Low German , aligning with the similar-sounding (and similar-looking) .

&quot;Gyromitra esculenta&quot; is a member of a group of fungi known as &quot;false morels&quot;, so named for their resemblance to the highly regarded true morels of the genus &quot;Morchella&quot;. The grouping includes other species of the genus &quot;Gyromitra&quot;, such as &quot;G. infula&quot; (elfin saddle), &quot;G. caroliniana&quot; and &quot;G. gigas&quot; (snow morel). While some of these species contain little to no gyromitrin, many guidebooks recommend treating them all as poisonous, since their similar appearance and significant intraspecific variation can make reliable identification difficult. The toxic qualities of &quot;G. esculenta&quot; may be reduced by cooking, but possibly not enough to prevent poisoning from repeated consumption.

The more distantly related ascomycete mushrooms of the genus &quot;Verpa&quot;, such as &quot;V. bohemica&quot; and &quot;V. conica&quot;, are also known as false morels, early morels or thimble morels; like the &quot;Gyromitra&quot;, they are eaten by some and considered poisonous by others.

The genus &quot;Gyromitra&quot; had been classically considered part of the family Helvellaceae, along with the similar-looking elfin saddles of the genus &quot;Helvella&quot;. Analysis of the ribosomal DNA of many of the Pezizales showed &quot;G. esculenta&quot; and the other false morels to be only distantly related to the other members of the Helvellaceae and instead most closely related to the genus &quot;Discina&quot;, forming a clade which also contains &quot;Pseudorhizina&quot; and &quot;Hydnotrya&quot;. Thus the four genera are now included in the family Discinaceae.

==Description==

Resembling a brain, the irregularly shaped cap may be up to high and wide. Initially smooth, it becomes progressively more wrinkled as it grows and ages. The cap colour may be various shades of reddish-, chestnut-, purplish-, bay-, dark or sometimes golden-brown; it darkens to black in age. Specimens from California may have more reddish-brown caps. Attached to the cap at several points, the stipe is high and wide. &quot;G. esculenta&quot; has been reported to have a solid stipe whereas those of true morels (&quot;Morchella&quot; spp.) are hollow, although a modern source says it is hollow as well. The smell can be pleasant and has been described as fruity, and the fungus is mild-tasting. The spore print is whitish, with transparent spores that are elliptical and 17–22 μm in length.

===Similar species===
&quot;G. esculenta&quot; resembles the various species of true morel, although the latter are more symmetric and look more like pitted gray, tan, or brown sponges. Its cap is generally darker and larger.

&quot;G. gigas&quot;, &quot;G. infula&quot; and &quot;G. ambigua&quot; in particular are similar, the latter two being toxic to humans.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;G. esculenta&quot; grows on sandy soil in temperate coniferous forest and occasionally in deciduous woodlands. Among conifers it is mostly found under pines (&quot;Pinus&quot; spp.), but also sometimes under aspens (&quot;Populus&quot; spp.). The hunting period is from April to July, earlier than for other species, and the fungus may even sprout up with the melting snow. It can be abundant in some years and rare in others. The mushroom is more commonly found in places where ground has been disturbed, such as openings, rivulets, washes, timber clearings, plowed openings, forest fire clearings, and roadsides. Enthusiasts in Finland have been reported burying newspaper inoculated with the fungus in the ground in autumn and returning the following spring to collect mushrooms.

Although more abundant in montane and northern coniferous woodlands such as the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range in northwestern North America, &quot;Gyromitra esculenta&quot; is found widely across the continent, as far south as Mexico. It is also common in Central Europe, less abundant in the east, and more in montane areas than lowlands. It has been recorded from Northern Ireland, from Uşak Province in Western Turkey, and from the vicinity of Kaş in the Antalya Province of Turkey&#x27;s southern coast.

==Toxicity==

Toxic reactions have been known for at least a hundred years. Experts speculated the reaction was more of an allergic one specific to the consumer, or a misidentification, rather than innate toxicity of the fungus, due to the wide range in effects seen. Some would suffer severely or perish while others exhibited no symptoms after eating similar amounts of mushrooms from the same dish. Yet others would be not poisoned after eating &quot;G. esculenta&quot; for many years. However, the fungus is now widely recognized as potentially deadly.

&quot;Gyromitra esculenta&quot; contains levels of the poison gyromitrin that vary locally among populations; although these mushrooms are only rarely involved in poisonings in either North America or western Europe, intoxications are seen frequently in eastern Europe and Scandinavia. A 1971 Polish study reported at the time that the species accounted for up to 23% of mushroom fatalities each year. Death rates have dropped since the mid-twentieth century; in Sweden poisoning is common, though life-threatening poisonings have not been detected and there was no fatality reported over the 50 years from 1952 to 2002. &quot;Gyromitra&quot; poisonings are rare in Spain, due to the widespread practice of drying the mushrooms before preparation and consumption, .

A lethal dose of gyromitrin has been estimated to be 10–30 mg/kg for children and 20–50 mg/kg in adults. These doses correspond to around and of fresh mushroom respectively. Evidence suggests that children are more severely affected; it is unclear whether this is due to a larger weight consumed per body mass ratio or to differences in enzyme and metabolic activity.

===Geographical variation===
Populations of &quot;G. esculenta&quot; appear to vary geographically in their toxicity. A French study has shown that mushrooms collected at higher altitudes have lower concentrations of toxin than those from lower elevations, and there is some evidence that fungi west of the Rocky Mountains in North America contain less toxin than those to the east. However, poisonings in the USA have been reported, although less frequently than in Europe.

===Biochemistry===

The identity of the toxic constituents eluded researchers until 1968, when acetaldehyde &quot;N&quot;-methyl-&quot;N&quot;-formylhydrazone, better known as gyromitrin, was isolated. Gyromitrin is a volatile, water-soluble hydrazine compound hydrolyzed in the body into &quot;N&quot;-methyl-&quot;N&quot;-formylhydrazine (MFH) then monomethylhydrazine (MMH). Other &quot;N&quot;-methyl-&quot;N&quot;-formylhydrazone derivatives have been isolated in subsequent research, although they are present in smaller amounts. These other compounds would also produce monomethylhydrazine when hydrolyzed, although it remains unclear how much each contributes to the false morel&#x27;s toxicity.

The toxins react with pyridoxal-5-phosphate—the activated form of pyridoxine (vitamin B6)—and form a hydrazone. This reduces production of the neurotransmitter GABA via decreased activity of glutamic acid decarboxylase, producing the neurological symptoms. MMH also causes oxidative stress leading to methemoglobinemia. Inhibition of diamine oxidase (histaminase) elevates histamine levels resulting in headaches, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

MFH, as a mushroom component and an intermediary product of gyromitrin hydrolysis, has toxicities of its own. MFH undergoes cytochrome P450-regulated oxidative metabolism which, via reactive nitrosamide intermediates, leads to formation of methyl radicals which lead to liver necrosis.

===Symptoms===
The symptoms of poisoning are typically gastrointestinal and neurological. Symptoms occur within 6–12 hours of consumption, although cases of more severe poisoning may present sooner—as little as 2 hours after ingestion. Initial symptoms are gastrointestinal, with sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea which may be bloodstained. Dehydration may develop if the vomiting or diarrhea is severe. Dizziness, lethargy, vertigo, tremor, ataxia, nystagmus, and headaches develop soon after; fever often occurs, a distinctive feature which does not develop after poisoning by other types of mushrooms. In most cases of poisoning, symptoms do not progress from these initial symptoms, and patients recover after 2–6 days of illness.

In some cases there may be an asymptomatic phase following the initial symptoms which is then followed by more significant toxicity including kidney damage, liver damage, and neurological dysfunction including seizures and coma. These signs usually develop within 1–3 days in serious cases. The patient develops jaundice and the liver and spleen become enlarged; in some cases blood sugar levels will rise (hyperglycemia) and then fall (hypoglycemia) and liver toxicity is seen. Additionally intravascular hemolysis causes destruction of red blood cells resulting in increase in free hemoglobin and hemoglobinuria which can lead to renal toxicity or kidney failure. Methemoglobinemia may also occur in some cases. This is where higher than normal levels of methemoglobin, which is a form of hemoglobin that can not carry oxygen, are found in the blood. It causes the patient to become short of breath and cyanotic. Cases of severe poisoning may progress to a terminal neurological phase, with delirium, muscle fasciculations and seizures, and mydriasis progressing to coma, circulatory collapse, and respiratory arrest. Death may occur from five to seven days after consumption.

===Treatment===
Treatment is mainly supportive; gastric decontamination with activated charcoal may be beneficial if medical attention is sought within a few hours of consumption. However, symptoms often take longer than this to develop, and patients do not usually present for treatment until many hours after ingestion, thus limiting its effectiveness. Patients with severe vomiting or diarrhea can be rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Monitoring of biochemical parameters such as methemoglobin levels, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, urinalysis, and complete blood count is undertaken and any abnormalities are corrected. Dialysis can be used if kidney function is impaired or the kidneys are failing. Hemolysis may require a blood transfusion to replace the lost red blood cells, while methemoglobinemia is treated with intravenous methylene blue.

Pyridoxine, also known as vitamin B6, can be used to counteract the inhibition by MMH on the pyridoxine-dependent step in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter GABA. Thus GABA synthesis can continue and symptoms are relieved. Pyridoxine, which is only useful for the neurological symptoms and does not decrease hepatic toxicity, is given at a dose of 25 mg/kg; this can be repeated up to a maximum total of 15 to 30 g daily if symptoms do not improve. Benzodiazepines are given to control seizures; as they also modulate GABA receptors they may potentially increase the effect of pyridoxine. Additionally MMH inhibits the chemical transformation of folic acid into its active form, folinic acid, this can be treated by folinic acid given at 20–200 mg daily.

===Long-term effects===
====ALS====
Lagrange &quot;et al.&quot; presented in 2018 a link between life-long foraging for &quot;G. esculenta&quot; and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in French Alps populations. Similar ALS clusters possibly related to mushrooms are found near the Aosta Valley (Italy), in Sardinia, and in Michigan.

====Carcinogenicity====
Monomethylhydrazine, gyromitrin, raw &quot;Gyromitra esculenta&quot;, and &quot;N&quot;-methyl-&quot;N&quot;-formylhydrazine have been shown to be carcinogenic in experimental animals. Although &quot;Gyromitra esculenta&quot; has not been observed to cause cancer in humans, it is possible there is a carcinogenic risk for people who ingest these types of mushrooms. Even small amounts may have a carcinogenic effect. At least 11 different hydrazones have been isolated from &quot;G. esculenta&quot;, and it is not known if all potential carcinogens can be completely removed by parboiling.

==Consumption==

Despite its recognized toxicity, &quot;Gyromitra esculenta&quot; is marketed and consumed in several countries or states in Europe and North America. It was previously consumed in Germany, with fungi picked in and exported from Poland; more recently, however, Germany and Switzerland discouraged consumption by prohibiting its sale. Similarly in Sweden, the Swedish National Food Administration warns that it is not fit for human consumption, and restricts purchase of fresh mushrooms to restaurants alone. The mushroom is still highly regarded and consumed in Bulgaria, being sold in markets and picked for export there. In some countries such as Spain, especially in the eastern Pyrenees, they are traditionally considered a delicacy, and many people report consuming them for many years with no ill effects. Despite this, the false morel is listed as hazardous in official mushroom lists published by the Catalan Government and sale to the public is prohibited throughout Spain. Outside of Europe, &quot;G. esculenta&quot; is consumed in the Great Lakes region and some western states in the United States.

Selling and purchasing fresh false morels is legal in Finland, where it is highly regarded. However, the mushrooms are required by law to be accompanied with a warning that they are poisonous and legally prescribed preparation instructions. False morels are also sold prepared and canned, in which case they are ready to be used. Official figures from the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry report a total amount of false morels sold in Finland of 21.9 tonnes in 2006 and 32.7 tonnes, noted as being above average, in 2007. In 2002, the Finnish Food Safety Authority estimated annual consumption of false morels to be hundreds of tonnes in plentiful years. In Finnish cuisine, false morels may be cooked in an omelette, or gently sautéed in butter in a saucepan, flour and milk added to make a béchamel sauce, or pie filling. Alternatively, more fluid can be added for a false morel soup. Typical condiments added for flavour include parsley, chives, dill and black pepper.

While cooking the fungus removes (most of) the toxins, the cook can become poisoned by the hydrazine fumes given off by cooking.

===Controversies===
In 2015, Swedish chef caused a controversy when he prepared a dish with &quot;Gyromitra esculenta&quot; in a TV show. Mushroom expert Monica Svensson criticized him for including it, because monomethylhydrazine is a known carcinogen and there is a risk that inexperienced people might misinterpret the recipe and omit the steps that reduce the toxicity level. She also expressed criticism to Per Morberg for similar reasons. Paul Svensson said that he was not aware of the carcinogenic effects and apologized afterwards, and he promised to remove &quot;Gyromitra&quot; from his dishes.

===Preparation===

Most of the gyromitrin must be removed to render false morels edible. The recommended procedure involves either first drying and then boiling the mushrooms, or boiling the fresh mushrooms directly. To prepare fresh mushroom it is recommended that they are cut into small pieces and parboiled twice in copious amounts of water, at least three parts water to one part chopped mushrooms, for at least five minutes, after each boiling the mushroom should be rinsed thoroughly in clean water. Each round of parboiling reduces the free gyromitrin contents to a tenth. Significant amounts of gyromitrin are retained in the internal structure of the mushroom even after boiling. After 3 rounds of boiling for 5 minutes and discarding the water, the gyromitrin content is reduced to 6-15% of the original. After 5 rounds, this content is reduced to 7%. The gyromitrin is leached into the water where it will remain, therefore the parboiling water must be discarded and replaced with fresh water after each round of boiling. However, it is still recommended that the mushroom be boiled after drying.

MMH boils at and thus readily vaporizes into the air when water containing fresh false morels is boiled. If boiling the mushrooms indoors, care should be taken to ensure adequate ventilation, and, if symptoms of monomethylhydrazine poisoning appear, immediately open all windows and move outside to seek fresh air. Even after boiling, small amounts of gyromitrin and other hydrazine derivatives remain in the mushrooms. Given the possibility of accumulation of toxins, repeated consumption is not recommended.

===Prospects for cultivation===
Strains with much lower concentrations of gyromitrin have been discovered, and the fungus has been successfully grown to fruiting in culture. Thus there is scope for future research into cultivation of safer strains.

<doc id="302602" wikidata="Q186422" url="?curid=302602" title="Wolverine (character)">
<text>Wolverine (birth name: James Howlett; alias: Logan and Weapon X) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, often in association with the X-Men. He is a mutant with animal-keen senses, enhanced physical capabilities, a powerful regenerative ability known as a healing factor, a skeleton reinforced with the unbreakable fictional metal adamantium, significantly delayed aging and a prolonged lifespan and three retractable claws in each hand. In addition to the X-Men, Wolverine has been depicted as a member of X-Force, Alpha Flight, the Fantastic Four and the Avengers. The common depiction of Wolverine is multifaceted; he is portrayed at once as a gruff loner, susceptible to animalistic &quot;berserker rages&quot; despite his best efforts, while simultaneously being an incredibly knowledgeable and intelligent polyglot, strategist, and martial artist, partially due to his extended lifespan and expansive lived experiences. He has been featured in comic books, films, animation, and video games.

The character first appeared in the last panel of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #180 before having a larger role in #181 (cover-dated November 1974), in the Bronze Age of Comic Books. He was created by writer Len Wein and Marvel art director John Romita Sr. Romita designed the character&#x27;s costume, but the character was first drawn for publication by Herb Trimpe. Since 2017, Marvel editor-in-chief Roy Thomas has also claimed co-creator credit.

Wolverine then joined a revamped version of the superhero team the X-Men; writer Chris Claremont, artist Dave Cockrum and artist-writer John Byrne would play significant roles in the character&#x27;s development. In 1979, Wolverine featured in his first solo story, published in &quot;Marvel Comic&quot; #335 (UK). His position as a standalone character further advanced when artist Frank Miller collaborated with Claremont to revise Wolverine with a four-part eponymous limited series in 1982, which debuted Wolverine&#x27;s catchphrase, &quot;I&#x27;m the best there is at what I do, but what I do best isn&#x27;t very nice.&quot; The subsequent 1991 Weapon X storyline by Barry Windsor-Smith established that Wolverine had received the adamantium grafted to his skeleton in a torturous process conducted by a secret government project intended to create a super soldier, and that this experience led to post-traumatic amnesia.

Wolverine is typical of the many tough antiheroes that emerged in American popular culture after the Vietnam War; his willingness to use deadly force and his brooding loner nature became standard characteristics for comic book antiheroes by the end of the 1980s. As a result, the character became a fan favorite of the increasingly popular &quot;X-Men&quot; franchise, and has been featured in his own solo &quot;Wolverine&quot; comic book series since 1988.

Wolverine has appeared in most X-Men media adaptations, including animated television series, video games and film. In live action, Hugh Jackman portrayed the character across ten installments of the &quot;X-Men&quot; film series produced by 20th Century Fox between 2000 and 2017, and reprised the role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; (2024). Henry Cavill portrayed an alternate version of Wolverine dubbed &quot;Cavillrine&quot; in &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;. Troye Sivan portrayed a young version of Logan in the 2009 film &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;.

==Publication history==
===Creation and development===
Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Roy Thomas asked writer Len Wein to devise a character specifically named Wolverine, who was a Canadian of small stature and with a wolverine&#x27;s fierce temper. John Romita Sr. designed the first Wolverine costume, and believes he introduced the retractable claws, saying, &quot;When I make a design, I want it to be practical and functional. I thought, &#x27;If a man has claws like that, how does he scratch his nose or tie his shoelaces?&#x27;&quot; Wolverine first appeared in the final &quot;teaser&quot; panel of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #180 (cover-dated October 1974), written by Wein and penciled by Herb Trimpe. The character then appeared in a number of advertisements in various Marvel Comics publications before making his first major appearance in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #181 (November 1974), again by the Wein–Trimpe team. In 2009, Trimpe said he &quot;distinctly remembers&quot; Romita&#x27;s sketch and that, &quot;The way I see it, [Romita and Wein] sewed the monster together and I shocked it to life! ... It was just one of those secondary or tertiary characters, actually, that we were using in that particular book with no particular notion of it going anywhere. We did characters in &quot;The [Incredible] Hulk&quot; all the time that were in [particular] issues and that was the end of them.&quot; Though often credited as co-creator, Trimpe denied having had any role in Wolverine&#x27;s creation.
The character&#x27;s introduction was ambiguous, revealing little beyond his being a superhuman agent of the Canadian government. In these appearances, he does not retract his claws, although Wein stated they had always been envisioned as retractable. He appears briefly in the finale to this story in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #182.

Wolverine&#x27;s next appearance was in 1975&#x27;s &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; #1, written by Wein and penciled by Dave Cockrum, in which Wolverine is recruited for a new squad. Gil Kane illustrated the cover artwork but incorrectly drew Wolverine&#x27;s mask with larger headpieces. Dave Cockrum liked Kane&#x27;s accidental alteration (he thought the original was too similar to Batman&#x27;s mask) and incorporated it into his own artwork for the actual story. Cockrum was also the first artist to draw Wolverine without his mask, and the distinctive hairstyle became a trademark of the character.

Chris Claremont took the name Logan from Canada&#x27;s Mount Logan, stating that &quot;the idea was the tallest mountain being the name of the shortest character&quot;.

===Wolverine&#x27;s first intended origin===
Despite suggestions that co-creator Len Wein originally intended for Logan to be a mutated wolverine cub, evolved to humanoid form by an already established Marvel geneticist, the High Evolutionary, Wein denies this:

Wein said on the &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot; Blu-ray special features that he has read &quot;Ten things you did not know about Wolverine&quot;, which says the character was originally intended to be a mutated wolverine cub, and that this rekindled Wein&#x27;s frustration. He again stated that he had &quot;always known that Wolverine was a mutant.&quot;

In an article about the evolution of Wolverine included in a 1986 reprint of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #180–181, titled &quot;Incredible Hulk and Wolverine&quot;, Cockrum said he considered having the High Evolutionary play a vital role in making Wolverine a human. Writer Wein wanted Wolverine to be the age of a young adult, with superhuman strength and agility similar to Spider-Man. This changed when Wein saw Cockrum&#x27;s drawing of the unmasked Wolverine as a hairy 40-year-old. Wein originally intended the claws to be retractable and part of Wolverine&#x27;s gloves, and both gloves and claws would be made of adamantium. Chris Claremont eventually revealed that they were an integrated part of Wolverine&#x27;s anatomy in &quot;X-Men&quot; #98 (April 1976). Writer Jeph Loeb used a similar origin for Wolverine in the Marvel continuity, having feral mutants be an evolved lifeform.

===Wolverine&#x27;s second intended origin===
John Byrne said, both in interviews and on his website, that he drew a possible face for Wolverine, but then learned that Dave Cockrum had already drawn him unmasked in &quot;X-Men&quot; #98 (April 1976), long before Byrne&#x27;s run on the series. Later, Byrne used the drawing for the face of Sabretooth, an enemy of the martial artist superhero Iron Fist, whose stories Chris Claremont was writing. Byrne then conceived of the idea of Sabretooth being Wolverine&#x27;s father. Together, Byrne and Claremont came up with Wolverine being about 60 years old and having served in World War II after escaping from Sabretooth, who was about 120 years old.

===Chris Claremont era: 1970s and 1980s===
A revival of &quot;X-Men&quot; followed &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot;, beginning with &quot;X-Men&quot; #94 (August 1975), drawn by Cockrum and written by Chris Claremont. In &quot;X-Men&quot; and &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;, Wolverine is initially overshadowed by the other characters, although he does create tension in the team as he is attracted to Cyclops&#x27; girlfriend, Jean Grey. As the series progressed, Claremont and Cockrum (who preferred Nightcrawler) considered dropping Wolverine from the series; Cockrum&#x27;s successor, artist John Byrne, championed the character, later explaining, as a Canadian himself, he did not want to see a Canadian character dropped. Byrne modeled his rendition of Wolverine on actor Paul D&#x27;Amato, who played Dr. Hook in the 1977 sports film &quot;Slap Shot&quot;. Byrne also created Alpha Flight, a group of Canadian superheroes who try to recapture Wolverine due to the expense their government incurred training him. Later stories gradually establish Wolverine&#x27;s murky past and unstable nature, which he battles to keep in check. Byrne also designed a new brown-and-tan costume for Wolverine, but retained the distinctive Cockrum cowl. Cockrum had introduced a new costume for Wolverine (taken from his adversary Fang) in the final issue of his run, but it was dropped one issue into Byrne&#x27;s run because he and Cockrum alike found it painfully difficult to draw. &quot;X-Men&quot; #100 introduces the fastball special, a combat maneuver in which the super-strong Colossus throws Wolverine at a distance as if he were a projectile weapon. This tactic recurs in many future battles.

In 1979, Wolverine featured in his first solo story, &quot;At the Sign of a Lion&quot;, published in &quot;Marvel Comic&quot; #335 (UK). Written by Mary Jo Duffy, with pencils by Ken Landgraf and inks by George Pérez—marking Pérez&#x27;s debut as an inker—the story centers on Wolverine as the protagonist. The narrative unfolds in a bar, where Wolverine, sitting alone, becomes embroiled in a fight with Hercules after the latter attempts to intimidate him. This story is notable for being Wolverine&#x27;s first appearance as a standalone character, separate from the X-Men.

Following Byrne&#x27;s departure, Wolverine remained as a prominent character in &quot;X-Men&quot;, which later changed its name to &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;. Cockrum returned for a longer, monthly run and afterwards Paul Smith, John Romita Jr., Marc Silvestri and Jim Lee were frequent artists on this series. He remained a significant protagonist in this series until Chris Claremont left the title to write the new &quot;X-Men (vol. 2)&quot; and Wolverine transitioned to this new series.

The character&#x27;s growing popularity led to a solo, four-issue series, &quot;Wolverine&quot; (September–December 1982), by Claremont and Frank Miller. Elliott Serrano, a comic writer and commentator, argues that this series was particularly significant in establishing the character&#x27;s popularity: &quot;Before Claremont and Miller created the Wolverine series, Logan wasn&#x27;t a key figure, but the creation of this series is when Wolverine became Marvel&#x27;s Batman.&quot;

In this period, Wolverine&#x27;s appearance and characterization were particularly influenced by the film roles of Clint Eastwood, particularly the Revisionist Western antihero films featuring the Man with No Name. Dialogue and scenes also present a direct homage to Eastwood&#x27;s neo-noir detective film &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;. This inspiration continued to be significant throughout the development of the character and his adaptations.

The mini-series was followed by the six-issue &quot;Kitty Pryde and Wolverine&quot; by Claremont and Al Milgrom (Nov. 1984 – April 1985). Marvel launched an ongoing solo book written by Claremont with art by John Buscema in November 1988. It ran for 189 issues. In 1989, Wolverine also featured in a crossover graphic novel with Nick Fury, written by Archie Goodwin with art by Howard Chaykin. He appeared in a second self-contained story taking place in the Savage Land written by Walter Simonson and illustrated by Mike Mignola the following year.

===1990s===
Larry Hama took over the ongoing series and had a seven-year run, from 1990 to 1997. In the first years of the 1990s, the series was usually illustrated by Marc Silvestri. Following Silvestri&#x27;s departure in 1992, the series was often illustrated by Mark Texeira. Hama&#x27;s run included a storyline inspired by Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;. The series was bimonthly from July 1991 to September 1992. Hama also introduced &quot;Albert,&quot; a cyborg copy of Wolverine, and often featured Jubilee as Wolverine&#x27;s sidekick. Hama also frequently delved into Wolverine&#x27;s mysterious past in the Weapon X program, which was often highly convoluted and unreliable because of the false memories implanted by the program&#x27;s designers. In 1992, Hama revisited the Japanese setting and characters of Claremont&#x27;s and Miller&#x27;s earlier limited series, ending the story with the poisoning of Mariko Yashida and her mercy killing at the hands of Wolverine. Hama credited the influence of Yakuza films as well as Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Black Rain&quot;. Himself a Japanese American, Hama argued that his depiction was somewhat more authentic than previous American superhero stories told in Japan.

In 1991, Wolverine also appeared in a one-shot story written by Howard Mackie and penciled by John Romita Jr., co-starring with Punisher and Ghost Rider. John Romita Jr. acknowledged primarily commercial motivations, because, as he said at the time, these three &quot;are the top characters, right now.&quot;

During this period, Wolverine also regularly appeared in cover stories for the anthology series &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot;. Among these stories was &quot;Weapon X&quot;, by writer-artist Barry Windsor-Smith, serialized in &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; #72–84 (1991), which was an essential depiction of Wolverine&#x27;s past and the event of adamantium grafted to his skeleton. Subsequent stories in this publication were often illustrated by Sam Kieth and had a more psychedelic aesthetic and storytelling style.

In 1993, the &quot;Wolverine&quot; ongoing series was often drawn by Dwayne Turner.

Other writers who wrote for the &quot;Wolverine&quot; ongoing series include Peter David, Archie Goodwin, Erik Larsen, Frank Tieri, Greg Rucka, Mark Millar, and Gregg Hurwitz. Many artists have also worked on the series, including John Byrne, Gene Colan, Marc Silvestri, Mark Texeira, Adam Kubert, Leinil Francis Yu, Rob Liefeld, Sean Chen, Darick Robertson, John Romita Jr., Joe Madureira, and Humberto Ramos.

In the early 1990s, Wolverine featured as a prominent character in &quot;X-Men&quot; vol. 2, initially written by Chris Claremont and illustrated by Jim Lee. The first issue of this comic book series is the highest selling comic book in history. Following the departure of Claremont and Lee, Scott Lobdell and Fabian Nicieza usually wrote the title while Andy Kubert illustrated it.

In 1993, Wolverine&#x27;s adamantium is ripped out by Magneto in &quot;X-Men&quot; (Vol 2) #25. Writers were inspired by a passing joke of Peter David&#x27;s. It is revealed that Wolverine has natural bone claws, in contrast to previously established narrative continuity that his claws were entirely bionic. Wolverine himself is confused by this realization, and his healing factor is also greatly weakened by recovery from this extraordinary injury. He leaves the X-Men temporarily as a result. In 1994, the &quot;Wolverine&quot; ongoing series was usually drawn by Adam Kubert, the brother of the artist for &quot;X-Men&quot;.

In 1995, all of the X-Men related comic books were temporarily replaced by a storyline in an alternate reality, named Age of Apocalypse. The Wolverine series was replaced by a series called &quot;Weapon X&quot; (not to be confused with the origin story published in 1991), in which Logan is generally referred to by this code name rather than as Wolverine. In this reality, Logan still has his adamantium, and Magneto, now the leader of the X-Men, helps him to control his feral rages. Weapon X is also missing a hand. He and Jean Grey are lovers in this reality. The series lasted four issues, before concluding and the return to the original name and numbering of the &quot;Wolverine&quot; series.

Following the return to the original timeline, a follower of Apocalypse captures Wolverine and attempts to bond adamantium to his skeleton a second time, with the goal of making him one of Apocalypse&#x27;s warriors. However, Wolverine&#x27;s healing factor and willpower reject the process; the ensuing stress leads him to regress into a bestial state. Stick, the former mentor of Daredevil, sends Elektra to re-train Wolverine, and heal his psyche. For a few issues, Wolverine remains in a bestial state in which he is less articulate and shrewd. In this period, Val Semeiks is usually the penciller.

===2000s===
Sales for X-Men comics declined somewhat at the turn of the 21st century, and Grant Morrison was hired to revive interest in the characters, including Wolverine, by means of the more experimental &quot;New X-Men&quot;. Frank Quitely and Chris Bachalo drew many of these issues, as well as a returning Mark Silvestri. Subsequently, he featured in the &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; series initially written by Joss Whedon and illustrated by John Cassaday.

When the Ultimate Marvel imprint was created with reimagined versions of Marvel&#x27;s characters, an alternate Wolverine appeared in 2001 with the Ultimate X-Men. The series was initially written by Mark Millar, who went on to write a number of other influential stories about Wolverine, in both mainstream continuity and alternate versions. This version of the character is significantly more aggressive and amoral.

Another publication expanded upon the character&#x27;s past: &quot;Origin&quot;, a six-issue limited series by co-writers Joe Quesada, Paul Jenkins, and Bill Jemas and artist Andy Kubert (Nov. 2001 – July 2002). This story first provided Wolverine&#x27;s birth name (James Howlett) and fleshed out many details of his childhood and adolescence that were previously mysterious. Tom DeSanto, a writer and producer for the &quot;X-Men&quot; film franchise, indicates that Marvel felt the necessity to provide a definitive origin for Wolverine because of his success as a film character and concern that the films would begin to answer these questions if the comic books did not do so first. In 2004, Jenkins, who scripted &quot;Origin&quot;, wrote &quot;Wolverine: The End&quot; as a bookend to the story. The story portrays the old age of a possible future Wolverine, resolving ideas and character arcs from the origin story. Other writers subsequently present other possible futures for Wolverine.

In 2003, Wolverine appeared in &quot;&quot; by Tsutomu Nihei, which is an apocalyptic manga interpretation of the character.

Following Larry Hama&#x27;s exit from the &quot;Wolverine&quot; solo title, Mark Millar became a particularly influential writer for the character. In 2004, Millar wrote the &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; storyline in &quot;Wolverine&quot; vol. 3, in which Wolverine is brainwashed by the ninja secret society the Hand. Before returning to consciousness, he kills numerous innocent people. As in his previous bestial state, Elektra helps him to recovery humanity, although the earlier storyline is not referenced. In 2008, Millar and artist Steve McNiven explored a possible future for Wolverine in an eight-issue story arc entitled &quot;Old Man Logan&quot; that debuted with &quot;Wolverine&quot; #66.

In 2005, at the conclusion of the &quot;House of M&quot; storyline, Wolverine regains the memories he had lost or repressed. The following year, a second solo series, &quot;&quot;, written by Daniel Way with art by Steve Dillon, ran concurrently with the second &quot;Wolverine&quot; solo series. In the series, Wolverine delves into the ramifications of his newly remembered past. The series introduces Daken, Wolverine&#x27;s son, in issue #11 (April 2007). In the &quot;Decimation&quot; storyline, 90% of mutants lose their powers. Wolverine is among the 198 mutants who retain their powers.

In 2007, Jason Aaron became a prominent writer for the character. In his tenure, he wrote issues for the ongoing series as well as a new miniseries titled &quot;Wolverine: Manifest Destiny&quot; and an ongoing series titled &quot;Wolverine: Weapon X&quot;. Aaron&#x27;s story arcs include more hallucinatory narratives, including an homage to &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, along with more conventional adventure stories. In Aaron&#x27;s tenure, Wolverine begins a relationship with a non-superpowered woman, a reporter named Melita Garner.

In &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #493 (February 2008), part of the &quot;Messiah Complex&quot; storyline, Cyclops asks Wolverine to re-form and lead X-Force. This new, more militaristic sub-team of the X-Men initially includes X-23 (Wolverine&#x27;s daughter), Warpath, Hepzibah, Caliban, and Wolfsbane. The new team featured in its own ongoing series, written by Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost, from 2008 to 2010.

===2010s===
In the 2010s, Wolverine continues to lead X-Force. In the &quot;X-Force: Sex and Violence&quot; miniseries, written by Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost and illustrated by Gabriele Dell&#x27;Otto, he begins a romantic relationship with Domino. The series was revamped as &quot;Uncanny X-Force&quot;, also in 2010, written by Rick Remender. This version of the team retained Wolverine as leader, and included Psylocke, Warren Worthington III, Fantomex, and Deadpool.

Jason Aaron continued writing Wolverine stories prolifically in this decade. In addition to multiple solo stories, Aaron wrote &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot;, in which Wolverine becomes the headmaster of the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning and must mentor a younger generation of mutants as well as leading one of the X-Men teams. He also wrote &quot;Wolverine: Japan&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; in 2013.

Wolverine also joins the Avengers. He appears as a regular character throughout both the 2010–2013 &quot;Avengers&quot; series and the 2010–2013 &quot;New Avengers&quot; series. In the &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; storyline of 2012, Wolverine sides with the Avengers against his previous team. He describes his place in the group as &quot;the lone killer on a team full a&#x27; heroes.&quot;

In 2013, he also appeared in &quot;Savage Wolverine&quot; first written by Frank Cho. This is an adventure story in the Savage Land co-starring Shanna the She-Devil. The second story arc, written by Zeb Wells, features another encounter with Elektra.

In 2014, Charles Soule wrote the &quot;Death of Wolverine&quot; storyline. In this story, Wolverine contracts a virus that disables his healing factor, allowing his enemies to finally kill him. He is eventually resurrected.

2019 begins a new era for the X-Men. Beginning in House of X and Powers of X, by Jonathan Hickman, the mutants found a new nation on the living island of Krakoa, where they are capable of regularly resurrecting mutants after their death. Wolverine reconciles with Cyclops and abandons their long-standing rivalry. Wolverine leads a new version of X-Force in a series written by Benjamin Percy, which now includes Domino, Beast, Black Tom Cassidy, Jean Grey, Quentin Quire, and Sage.

In 2019, Wolverine also features as part of the Savage Avengers, along with Punisher, Elektra, Venom, Brother Voodoo, and Conan the Barbarian.

===2020s===
Wolverine continued in appear in a number of series in this decade, both as a solo hero and as part of multiple teams. As the Krakoa era continued for all of the X-Men characters, Benjamin Percy wrote a new &quot;Wolverine&quot; ongoing series beginning in 2020, along with his leadership role in the &quot;X-Force&quot; series.

Wolverine also featured in a new version of the Midnight Sons in a series that began in 2022.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life and backstory===
Wolverine was born as James Howlett in northern Alberta, Canada (approximately near Cold Lake), during the late 19th century, purportedly to rich farm owners John and Elizabeth Howlett, though he is actually the illegitimate son of the Howletts&#x27; groundskeeper, Thomas Logan. After Thomas is thrown off the Howletts&#x27; property for an attempted rape perpetrated by his other son, named simply Dog, he returns to the Howlett manor and kills John Howlett. In retaliation, young James kills Thomas with bone claws that emerge from the back of his hands, as his mutation manifests. He flees with his childhood companion, Rose, and grows into manhood on a mining colony in the Yukon, adopting the name &quot;Logan&quot;. When Logan accidentally kills Rose with his claws, he flees the colony and lives in the wilderness among wolves, until he is captured and placed in a circus. Saul Creed, brother of Victor Creed, frees Logan, but after he betrays Logan and Clara Creed to Nathaniel Essex, Logan drowns Creed in Essex&#x27;s potion. Logan returns to civilization, residing with the Blackfoot people. Following the death of his Blackfoot lover, Silver Fox, at the hands of Victor Creed, now known as Sabretooth, he is ushered into the Canadian military during World War I.

During World War II, Logan teams up with Captain America and continues a career as a mercenary. He serves with the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion during D-Day, and later with the CIA before being recruited by Team X, a black ops unit. Sometime after WWII and before joining Team X, Logan spends time in Madripoor before settling in Japan, where he marries Itsu. While Logan is away from home, Romulus sends the Winter Soldier to kill the pregnant Itsu and has her baby taken from her womb; the boy would later become Daken. Logan believes his son to be dead for many years.

As a member of Team X, Logan is given false memory implants. Eventually breaking free of this mental control, he joins the Canadian Defense Ministry. Logan is subsequently kidnapped by the Weapon X program, where he remains captive and experimented on, until he escapes. It is during his imprisonment by Weapon X that he has adamantium forcibly fused onto his bones. James and Heather Hudson help him recover his humanity following his escape, and Logan begins work as an intelligence operative for the Canadian government&#x27;s Department H.

===1970s===
He becomes Wolverine, one of Canada&#x27;s first superheroes. In his first mission, he is dispatched to stop the destruction caused by a brawl between the Hulk and the Wendigo. After the Canadian government fails to capture Hulk, Wolverine is forced to team-up with Living Diamond to infiltrate Brand Corporation, where they are briefly caught by Mesmero and a mysterious masked mutant named Wildlife. Wildlife is actually an amnesiac Beast, an X-Men member. Former Secret Empire agent Linda Donaldson recovers Beast&#x27;s memories. Wolverine then kills Living Diamond for killing both Beast and Linda. Before taking Mesmero away, as Wolverine&#x27;s old mask was heavily damaged, Wolverine takes Beast&#x27;s Wildlife mask, which then becomes the iconic mask he uses through years.

Later, Professor Charles Xavier recruits Wolverine to a new iteration of his superhero-mutant team, the X-Men, along with Banshee, Storm, Nightcrawler, and Colossus. He competes with Cyclops for the affection of Jean Grey. It was later revealed that Wolverine had been sent to assassinate Xavier, who wiped Logan&#x27;s memories and forced him to join the X-Men.

===1980s===
In The Dark Phoenix Saga, Jean Grey apparently sacrifices herself after transforming into the Phoenix Force, thereby temporarily ending the love triangle among herself, Wolverine, and Cyclops. While his teammates often distrust him, Wolverine is invaluable in rescuing the others and defeating their enemies, particularly in their conflict with the Hellfire Club.

In this decade his new X-Men teammates included Longshot, Dazzler, and Rogue. He becomes engaged to Mariko Yashida and battles The Hand. However, the engagement is broken because of the intervention of a member of the Hellfire Club. He becomes a close defender and mentor for Kitty Pryde. He battles Sabretooth during the Mutant Massacre story line, though he later discovers that he had many previous interactions with Sabretooth that his traumatic amnesia concealed. Separate from the X-Men, he has adventures in Madripoor disguised as his alter ego &quot;Patch.&quot;

===1990s===
He is a mentor for Jubilee. When the X-Men split into two different subgroups, he participates in the &quot;Blue Team&quot; along with Cyclops, Rogue, Beast, Gambit, and Psylocke. Jean Grey had been resurrected by this point, leading to resumption of his rivalry with Cyclops.

He also discovers some aspects of the trauma and brainwashing he received from the Weapon X program, although his memories remain unreliable. He meets Maverick, another former participant in the Weapon X project, and discovers that he had previously worked together with Sabretooth in a covert team subsequent to the project.

In &quot;X-Men&quot; #25 (1993), at the culmination of the &quot;Fatal Attractions&quot; storyline, the supervillain Magneto forcibly removes the adamantium from Wolverine&#x27;s skeleton. This massive trauma causes his healing factor to burn out and also leads to the discovery that his claws are actually bone. Wolverine leaves the X-Men for a time, embarking on a series of adventures during which his healing factor returns. Feral by nature, Wolverine&#x27;s mutation process will eventually cause him to degenerate physically into a more primitive, bestial state. Elektra helps him to recover his humanity.

After his return to the X-Men, Cable&#x27;s son Genesis kidnaps Wolverine and attempts to re-bond adamantium to his skeleton. This is unsuccessful and causes Wolverine&#x27;s mutation to accelerate out of control. He is temporarily changed into a semi-sentient beast-like form. Eventually, the villain Apocalypse captures Wolverine, brainwashes him into becoming the Horseman Death, and successfully re-bonds adamantium to his skeleton. Wolverine overcomes Apocalypse&#x27;s programming and returns to the X-Men.

===2000s===
Jean Grey becomes again possessed by the Phoenix Force, and Wolverine has no other choice but to kill her with his claws.

Wolverine learns about the existence of X-23. He initially believes her to be a clone, raised to be a perfect assassin. X-23 later goes by the name Laura. She is eventually enrolled at the Xavier Institute, with her true origin being kept secret as Logan&#x27;s way of protecting her. Despite being introduced as Wolverine&#x27;s &quot;sister&quot;, she quickly accepts Wolverine as a father figure. She eventually learns that he is actually her biological father.

In the &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; story line, Wolverine is brainwashed by the Hand. He battles Elektra, S.H.I.E.L.D., and the Fantastic Four. He also attacks the X-Mansion and kills Northstar. Wolverine is captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. and submitted to VR reprogramming. He turns against the Hand.

In the &quot;House of M&quot; story line, Scarlet Witch drastically transforms reality. As a consequence, Wolverine is able to recall memories of his previous life, overcoming his previous traumatic amnesia.

In &quot;Wolverine: Origins&quot;, the character&#x27;s second solo series, Wolverine discovers that he has a son named Daken, who has been brainwashed and made a living weapon. Wolverine then makes it his mission to rescue Daken.

During the events of the &quot;Messiah Complex&quot; storyline, Cyclops orders Wolverine to reform X-Force. Wolverine and the team (initially consisting of X-23, Warpath, and Wolfsbane) starred in a new monthly title. In the &quot;Messiah War&quot;, Cyclops ends the X-Force program, but Wolverine continues a new Uncanny X-Force team in secrecy with Angel/Archangel, Psylocke, Deadpool and Fantomex.

Wolverine splits with Cyclops and opens a new school in Westchester, New York, the &quot;Jean Grey School for Higher Learning&quot;. Around half of all the mutants on Utopia accompany Wolverine to Westchester to be a part of the new school. He appoints himself as the headmaster, Kitty Pryde as the co-headmistress, Hank McCoy as the vice-principal, and various other characters are appointed as the school&#x27;s staff.

===2010s===
In &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; the Phoenix Force returns to Earth and this produces conflict between the X-Men and the Avengers, and Wolverine takes the side of the Avengers. Cyclops becomes possessed by the Phoenix Force and kills Professor X. In &quot;Uncanny Avengers&quot; Wolverine gives a eulogy at the funeral of Professor X, in which he admits that he wanted to kill Cyclops. He becomes a member of the Avengers Unity Squad, a team created by Captain America in which X-Men and Avengers work together.

In the &quot;Death of Wolverine&quot; story line, a virus turns off Wolverine&#x27;s healing factor. Wolverine determines that Doctor Abraham Cornelius, the founder of the Weapon X program, has placed a bounty on his head. Wolverine gets covered in adamantium after confronting him, and dies from suffocation. Wanting to possess Logan, Ogun finds his dead body.

The aftermath of Wolverine&#x27;s death is explored in the series &quot;Wolverines&quot;. The &quot;Wolverines&quot; (a team formed from the fallout of his death by Daken, Lady Deathstrike, Mystique, Sabretooth, and X-23) try to find Logan&#x27;s adamantium-covered body, which is taken by Mister Sinister.

X-23 begins wearing a variation of Wolverine&#x27;s costume and adopts his codename.

In &quot;Marvel Legacy&quot; #1, the time-displaced Jean Grey discovers the adamantium shell in Wolverine&#x27;s grave has been cracked open and is empty. The X-Men set up Wolverine&#x27;s &#x27;public&#x27; grave in the cabin and were able to get his body out of the adamantium shell by having Kitty phase his corpse out of it, subsequently burying him in a secret location in Canada while leaving the shell as a site for others to attend in memorial of him. The shell is cracked when the Reavers attempt to steal Wolverine&#x27;s corpse and shortly after that attack, Kitty visits the &#x27;real&#x27; grave and realizes that it is empty. Kitty contacts Daredevil and Tony Stark for help finding who took Wolverine, but all are left concerned at the questions of who would even know the location of the true grave- which was known only by a few key X-Men- and whether Wolverine was stolen or &#x27;woke up&#x27; on his own as the X-Men also began their investigation, leaving the time-displaced Jean Grey alone in the cabin. At the same time, some of Wolverine&#x27;s worst enemies hear what happened and join the hunt.

The &quot;Return of Wolverine&quot; miniseries focusing on Wolverine&#x27;s resurrection opens with Wolverine having been brought back to life in an amnesic state by an unidentified force. He eventually realizes that he was brought back to life by Persephone.

Wolverine joins the X-Men to attack Orchis&#x27;s Mother Mold solar orbiting space station. As Wolverine and Nightcrawler volunteer for a suicide mission to teleport into the vacuum of space. The two longtime friends then say their goodbyes to each other, with Nightcrawler assuring Wolverine that he will be welcomed into heaven. As Nightcrawler is disintegrated, Wolverine&#x27;s body immediately ignites into flames and he and the Mother Mold are vaporized as they fall into the Sun.
Wolverine, along with the rest of the X-Men who perished in the attack on the Mother Mold space station, are then resurrected in the Arbor Magus&#x27; hatchery on the Pacific island of Krakoa using a new 48 hour cloning process. In this era, the X-Men have learned how to resurrect any mutant who has died. Forge, using Krakoan-Transmode cybernetics inside the island&#x27;s armory, provided the Adamantium and the skeletal bonding process.

===2020s===
Wolverine has been resurrected and equipped with an Adamantium skeleton no less than 10 times, having died in battle against Orchis&#x27;s Nimrod at least 9 times, and has grudgingly allowed for one of his clones to be created without Cerebro&#x27;s memory upload and to be genetically modified with phosphorescent blood to be fed upon by Dracula and his vampires.

During the &quot;Hellfire Gala&quot; storyline, Wolverine decides to spend time with his biological daughter Laura Kinney/X-23, and her clone Gabby/Scout, his biological son Daken, and also Kate Pryde and Jubilee. On the evening of the party, Wolverine and several members of X-Force are assigned positions as security. He and Domino then suddenly find themselves in a fight against Deadpool, who attempts to gatecrash the party. Meanwhile, Beast&#x27;s telefloronic programming on the Terra Verdan ambassador is hacked and starts attacking the party.

In the &quot;X Lives of Wolverine and X Deaths of Wolverine&quot; story event, Wolverine travels in time to save the life of an important figure to the mutant race. In the midst of his travels, Wolverine will relive certain moments from his own long-forgotten past as well. Upon revisiting the past, is revealed that Wolverine was present during the birth of Charles Xavier and indirectly Cassandra Nova, having saved his family from an invading Omega Red, when the Russian mutant possessed some of Xavier family&#x27;s butlers and nurse.

During the &quot;Judgment Day&quot; storyline, Wolverine is with the Quiet Council when Jack of Knives leads the attack on Krakoa. After killing some opponents, Wolverine finds Egg badly wounded and takes an attack from Jack of Knives as he tells Jean Grey to have the Five protected. After the opponents retreat, Wolverine learns from Nightcrawler what Uranos the Undying did on Arrako.

==Personality and themes==
===Animal and human nature===
Chris Claremont indicates that one of the main themes of Wolverine&#x27;s character is his struggle to maintain his humanity and to reconcile it with his wild, animal nature. This theme recurs through Wolverine stories, such as in the period in which he temporarily regresses into a bestial state. Claremont compared Wolverine to Hulk, because of his tendency to lapse into a &quot;berserker rage&quot; while in close combat. In this state, he lashes out with the intensity and aggression of an enraged animal and is even more resistant to psionic attack. Though he loathes it, he acknowledges that it has saved his life many times, it being most notably useful when he faced the telepathic &quot;Mister X&quot;, as X&#x27;s ability to read his mind and predict his next move in a fight was useless as not even Wolverine knows what he will do next in his berserk state.

===Military experience and samurai aspiration===
Chris Claremont says that he drew some of his characterization of Wolverine from Conan the Barbarian, declaring that &quot;Wolverine in his essence is a lot closer to Conan than any other Marvel hero we have.&quot; Like Conan, Wolverine is a perennial warrior. Various stories depict Wolverine&#x27;s experiences in various historical and fictional wars (such as World War I, the Spanish Civil War, World War II, the Vietnam War, and various Cold War conflicts), as well as attempts to train him or brainwash him into a weapon to be controlled by larger institutions or entities. Despite his apparent ease at taking lives, he mournfully regrets and does not enjoy killing or giving in to his berserker rages. Logan adheres to a firm code of personal honor and morality, and he generally only responds in a violent or deadly manner to enemies attacking him with deadly force. He often tries to restrict killing to a &quot;last resort,&quot; though he will often respond to deadly force with deadly force.

===Mental health struggles and psychological profile===
Wolverine is frequently depicted as a gruff loner, often taking leave from the X-Men to deal with personal issues or problems. He is often irreverent and rebellious towards authority figures, though he is a reliable ally and capable leader, and has occasionally displayed a wry, sarcastic sense of humor. J. Andrew Deman points out that while Wolverine is commonly associated with hypermasculinity, at least in Claremont&#x27;s characterization he also &quot;consistently demonstrates an emotional intelligence and sense of empathy,&quot; to an extraordinary degree.

Psychologist Suzana E. Flores writes that Wolverine demonstrates clinical psychological symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, antisocial personality disorder, dissociative disorder, and even sociopathy, but does so in a way that can be understood and empathized. She interprets his origin story as a depiction of complex childhood trauma, and its effects of dissociative amnesia and hypervigilance.

Larry Yarbrough, a clinical psychologist and Navy veteran, says that some of Wolverine&#x27;s personality traits are typical of combat veterans: &quot;The violent/kind demeanor of vets who witnessed war is paradoxical. Logan has an extremely reactive temper, but he&#x27;s also a kind person. The violent mood swings are a symptom of trauma, not a reflection of his character.&quot;

Yarbrough also observes Wolverine&#x27;s habitual smoking and drinking, as coping mechanisms for this experience of trauma. In addition, Wolverine practices zazen sitting meditation to maintain self-control and restore mental health.

===Canadian identity===
Wolverine is the best known Canadian superhero. In civilian clothes, he usually dresses in Western wear characteristic of Saskatchewan and Alberta (one of the early Wolverine artists, John Byrne, was raised in the latter of these provinces). Vivian Zenari has written about Wolverine&#x27;s Canadian patriotism: &quot;Wolverine must have national pride, almost out of structural necessity, in order to justify the Canadianness that coalesces around him.&quot; His primary connection to Canada is his affinity for the wild outdoors. One of Wolverine&#x27;s nicknames is &quot;Ol&#x27; Canucklehead,&quot; a variation on a slang term for Canadians.

==Powers and abilities==
Wolverine is a mutant with a number of both natural and artificial improvements to his physiology.

===Healing and defensive powers===

Wolverine&#x27;s primary mutant power is an accelerated healing process, typically referred to as his mutant healing factor, that regenerates damaged or destroyed tissues of his body far beyond that of normal humans. In addition to accelerated healing of physical traumas, Wolverine&#x27;s healing factor makes him extraordinarily resistant to diseases, drugs and toxins. However, he can still suffer the immediate effects of such substances in massive quantities; he has been seen to become intoxicated after ingesting significant amounts of alcohol, and has been incapacitated on several occasions with large amounts of powerful drugs and poisons; S.H.I.E.L.D. once managed to keep Wolverine anesthetized by constantly pumping eighty milliliters of anesthetic a minute into his system.

His healing factor allowed him to survive the experimental surgical binding of the virtually indestructible metal adamantium to his bones and claws, to which he was subjected under the Weapon X program (in later comics called the Weapon Plus program). While the adamantium in his body prevents or reduces many injuries, such as broken bones and decapitation, his healing factor must also work constantly to prevent metal poisoning from killing him. When his healing powers were rendered inactive, Beast synthesized a drug to counteract the adamantium poisoning.

Wolverine&#x27;s healing factor also dramatically affects his aging process, allowing him to live far beyond the normal lifespan of normal humans. Despite being born in the late 19th century, he has the appearance, conditioning, health and vitality of a man in his physical prime. While seemingly ageless, it is unknown exactly how greatly his healing factor extends his life expectancy.

Although Wolverine&#x27;s body heals, the healing factor does not suppress the pain he endures while injured. Wolverine also admits to feeling phantom pains for weeks or months after healing from his injuries. He does not enjoy being hurt and sometimes has to work himself up for situations where extreme pain is certain. Wolverine, on occasion, has deliberately injured himself or allowed himself to be injured for varying reasons, including freeing himself from capture, intimidation, strategy, or simply indulging his feral nature. Though he now has all of his memories, his healing abilities can provide increased recovery from psychological trauma by suppressing memories in which he experiences profound distress.

Depictions of the speed and extent of injury to which Wolverine can heal vary due to a broad degree of artistic license employed by various comic book writers. Originally, this was portrayed as accelerated healing of minor wounds, though Chris Claremont, head writer of the X-Men comics from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s increased Wolverine&#x27;s healing factor substantially, though not nearly as much as later writers would. During the 1980s, Wolverine&#x27;s mutant healing factor is depicted as being able to heal massive levels of trauma, though his recovery time could extend to days, weeks or months before fully healing; often depending upon the severity of the injuries, their extent and the frequency with which they are inflicted. Wolverine has also stated that his body actually heals faster when the injury is grave or life-threatening. During the 1990s through the modern era, other writers have increased Wolverine&#x27;s healing factor to the point that it could fully regenerate nearly any damaged or destroyed bodily tissues within seconds. Among the more extreme depictions of Wolverine&#x27;s healing factor include fully healing after being caught near the center of an atomic explosion and the total regeneration of his soft body tissue, within a matter of minutes, after having it incinerated from his skeleton. An explanation is given in a recent mini-series starring Wolverine for the increase of his healing powers. In the series, Wolverine is referred to as an &quot;adaptive self-healer&quot; after undergoing numerous traumatic injuries to test the efficiency of his healing factor. Wolverine has endured so much trauma, and so frequently, that his healing factor has adapted, becoming faster and more efficient to cope with increasing levels of trauma. The Xavier Protocols, a series of profiles created by Xavier that lists the strengths and weaknesses of the X-Men, say that Wolverine&#x27;s healing factor is increased to &quot;incredible levels&quot; and theorizes that the only way to stop him is to decapitate him and remove his head from the vicinity of his body.

It is possible to suppress the efficiency of Wolverine&#x27;s healing powers; for example, if an object composed of adamantium is inserted and remains lodged within his body, his healing powers are slowed dramatically. The Muramasa blade, a katana of mystic origins that can inflict wounds that nullify superhuman healing factors, can also suppress Wolverine&#x27;s powers. It has also been noted that Wolverine needs protein for his healing factor to generate tissue, meaning that if he was seriously injured and malnourished, his body might not be able to repair itself. His healing factor has also been turned off using nanites. On one occasion, Wolverine finds himself temporarily deprived of his healing factor, with the scientist and X-Man Beast revealing that an &quot;intelligent virus&quot; originating from the Microverse had shut off Wolverine’s healing factor (though not before it purged his body of the virus), leaving him as susceptible to injury, disease, and aging as any ordinary human.

It has been suggested that Wolverine can be killed by drowning. He has said that he is not particularly fond of being in the water, due partially to the weight of his adamantium laced skeleton, and that he can die if held underwater long enough - his healing factor would only prolong the agony. The two-part story arc &quot;Drowning Logan&quot; finds Wolverine trapped underwater for an extensive period of time. The second part of the story arc hints that this experience weakens his healing factor and future health.

Due to a combination of Wolverine&#x27;s healing factor and high-level psionic shields implanted by Professor Xavier, Wolverine&#x27;s mind is highly resistant to telepathic assault and probing. Wolverine&#x27;s mind also possesses what he refers to as &quot;mental scar tissue&quot; created by the traumatic events of his life. It acts as a type of natural defense, even against a psychic as powerful as Emma Frost.

While it is not clear whether this is an actual canon event or simply a hallucination, &quot;Wolverine&quot; vol. 3, #57 reveals that, when Wolverine is injured so seriously that his body actually dies before his healing factor can repair the damage, he returns to life by fighting with Azrael, the Angel of Death, while trapped in Purgatory because Wolverine defeated Azrael in real-world combat during World War I. However, after Wolverine&#x27;s resurrection and brainwashing by the Hand, he made a new deal with Azrael that repaired the damage to his soul, negated their previous arrangement, and weakened his healing factor slightly - and the next time Wolverine sustains death-inducing injuries, he will remain dead.

===Other abilities===
Wolverine&#x27;s mutation also includes animal-like adaptations to his body - his superhuman senses; pronounced, sharp, fang-like canines; and three retractable claws housed within each forearm. While originally depicted as bionic implants created by the Weapon X program, the claws are later revealed to be a natural part of his body. The claws are not made of keratin, as claws tend to be in the animal kingdom, but extremely dense bone. Wolverine&#x27;s hands do not have openings for the claws to move through: they cut through his flesh every time he extrudes them, with occasional references implying that he feels a brief moment of slight pain in his hands when he unsheathes them. During a talk to Jubilee, Wolverine reveals that there are channels inside his forearms through which the claws move when he extrudes them and that he unsheathes the claws a few times a day to keep the channels open, similar to pierced ears.
Wolverine&#x27;s senses of sight, smell, and hearing are all superhumanly acute. He can see with perfect clarity at greater distances than an ordinary human, even in near-total darkness. His hearing is enhanced in a similar manner, allowing him to hear sounds ordinary humans cannot and also hear to greater distances. A perfect example is him being able to hear the heartbeats of hostile living things before conflict begins.

Wolverine is able to use his sense of smell to easily remember and track targets by scent, even if the scent has been eroded somewhat over time by natural factors. This sense also allows him to identify shapeshifting mutants despite other forms they may take. Through concentration, he is also able to use his senses of smell and hearing as a type of natural lie detector, such as detecting a faint change in a person&#x27;s heartbeat and scent due to perspiration when a lie is told. Wolverine&#x27;s sense of smell and hearing also allows him to detect danger from considerable distances by being able to smell any weapons being carried by other living things and machines at least within a block radius and to hear particular disturbances or indications of an impending attack prior to their occurrence. For instance, in many cases he has been depicted as smelling the gun oil, gun powder, smokeless powder, or specific metal scent emanating from a concealed or distant gun or other weapon prior to an attack, as well as hearing the increased heart rate and smelling the increased perspiration of an individual preparing to attack. On one occasion, he is made aware of several yakuza members waiting for him outside of a bar by picking up the scent of their gun oil, the smell of their tattoo ink, and the smell of the daikon they ate before arriving. On another occasion, his acute sense of smell even allows him to detect the presence of X-23 sneaking around the outside grounds of Xavier Institute, by way of the wind shifting - despite him being indoors.

On more than one occasion, Wolverine&#x27;s entire skeleton, including his claws, has been molecularly infused with adamantium. Due to their coating, his claws can cut almost any known solid material, including most metals, wood, and some varieties of stone. The only known exceptions are adamantium itself and Captain America&#x27;s shield, which is made out of a proto-adamantium-vibranium alloy. Wolverine&#x27;s ability to slice completely through a substance depends upon both the amount of force he can exert and the thickness of the substance. His claws can also be used to block attacks or projectiles, as well as dig into surfaces allowing Wolverine to climb structures. The adamantium also adds weight to his blows, increasing the effectiveness of his offensive capabilities. However, his adamantium skeleton makes him highly susceptible to magnetic-based attacks. The full extent of this is revealed during a battle with Magneto, where the latter destabilizes the adamantium on a molecular level, and proceeds to rip it from his body. According to Reed Richards, Wolverine would be unable to move without his enhanced strength due to the additional weight of the adamantium bonded to his skeleton.

Wolverine&#x27;s healing factor also affects a number of his physical attributes by increasing them to superhuman levels. His stamina is sufficiently heightened to the point that he can exert himself for numerous hours, even after exposure to powerful tranquilizers. Wolverine&#x27;s agility and reflexes are also enhanced to levels that are beyond the physical limits of the finest human athlete. Due to his healing factor&#x27;s constant regenerative qualities, he can push his muscles beyond the limits of the human body without injury. This, coupled with the constant demand placed on his muscles by over one hundred pounds of adamantium, grants him some degree of superhuman strength. Since the presence of the adamantium negates the natural structural limits of his bones, he can lift or move weight that would otherwise damage a human skeleton. He has been depicted breaking steel chains, lifting several men above his head with one arm and throwing them through a wall, lifting Ursa Major (in grizzly bear form) over his head before tossing him across a room, and hauling a concert grand piano, and the platform it rests on, via a harness, while climbing a sheer cliff. Colossus and other allies use Wolverine&#x27;s endurance and strength when throwing him at high speed in the Fastball Special.

During and after the &quot;Return of Wolverine&quot;, he showcased a mysterious new ability where the adamantium in his claws can heat up to incredibly high, yet undisclosed, level of temperatures. The mechanics of this power have yet to be revealed; whether it is a Secondary Mutation, latent Weapon X faculty making itself known or a new power gained upon his resurrection is unclear. What is extent is that it is related to the berserker side of his persona, his Hot Claws as popularly noted being tied to Wolverine&#x27;s rage. This new power comes with the drawback of weakening his healing factor, however, as after using them to ward off the X-Men who came looking for him, he lost consciousness for a few weeks time afterward.

===Skills===
During Wolverine&#x27;s time in Japan and other countries, he became proficient in many forms of martial arts, with experience in many different fighting styles. He is proficient with most weaponry, including firearms, though he is partial to bladed weapons. He has demonstrated sufficient skills to defeat expert martial artist Shang-Chi and Captain America in single combat. He also has a wide knowledge of the body and pressure points. Like many of the X-Men, he is trained to pilot the group&#x27;s SR-71 Blackbird supersonic plane. He is highly skilled in the field of espionage and covert operations.

In contrast to his brutish nature, Wolverine is extremely knowledgeable. Due in part to his longer lifespan, he has traveled around the world and amassed extensive knowledge of foreign languages and cultures, being fluent or near fluent in Japanese, Russian, Spanish, French, Blackfoot, and German, among other languages. He is particularly fluent in Japanese due in part to his significant time spent in Japan and his relationship with Mariko Yashida.

== Supporting cast ==
Wolverine was originally introduced as an antagonist of the Hulk. Subsequently, he became a member of the X-Men and has had extensive interactions with all of them and their associates. In particular, he has a complex ambivalent relationship with Cyclops, for whom he was initially a rival for the affections of Jean Grey.

He has been a mentor and father figure to several younger women, especially Jubilee, Kitty Pryde and X-23.

===Enemies===
Wolverine&#x27;s prominent enemies include Sabretooth, the Hellfire Club, Viper (Madame Hydra), and Lady Deathstrike.

===Romantic interests===
His first love was Rose O&#x27;Hara, a close friend who did not reciprocate his affection. She died accidentally at his hands when she intervened in Wolverine&#x27;s adolescent fight with an adversary, Dog. Subsequently, he had a long relationship with Silver Fox. He had an intimate relationship with Mariko Yashida and had a failed engagement to her. Mariko was eventually poisoned by The Hand and Wolverine had no choice but to kill her in order to spare her a long agony. He also had a mutual, but unfulfilled attraction to Jean Grey, leading to arguments with her boyfriend (and later husband), Scott Summers. He also married Viper as part of a debt, then later divorced her. It has also been implied that he and Squirrel Girl had a relationship at some point in the past. Wolverine has had an on-again, off-again romantic relationship with longtime teammate and friend, Storm. He also had romantic relationships with Yukio, Domino, Mystique, and Elektra, all of whom are morally ambiguous warriors like himself. He describes Elektra in particular as a &quot;kindred spirit.&quot;

===Children===
Wolverine has a number of children, most notably his daughter, Laura, and his son, Akihiro. He also fostered a young orphan, Amiko. A group of his other children, the Mongrels, were used in a plot to torture him by the Red Right Hand. Laura has a number of other &#x27;sisters&#x27; and clones, including Gabby. He also has many children in other realities, such as Jimmy Hudson and Raze Darkhölme.

==Cultural impact and legacy==
===Status as anti-hero===
Wolverine was groundbreaking among comic book superheroes in demonstrating the traits of an antihero. As Suzana Flores describes it, an antihero is &quot;often psychologically damaged, simultaneously depicted as superior due to his superhuman abilities and inferior due to his impetuousness, irrationality, or lack of thoughtful evaluation.&quot; Subsequent to Wolverine&#x27;s appearance, many more such antiheroes have become popular in comic books, such as Punisher, Marv, Spawn, and Deadpool.

===Mental health analysis===
Psychologist Suzana E. Flores has identified that Wolverine&#x27;s extraordinary popularity partly stems from his illustration of various mental health challenges, particularly recovery from major trauma or psychological trauma. She argues that his first formative trauma was his poor relationship with his mother, who was unable to properly attach to him because she lost her first son. In adulthood, he also suffered the trauma of torture by the Weapon X program. While the character is usually physically invincible, he demonstrates emotional and psychological vulnerability. He exemplifies values and aspirations of resilience for his audience. His fan base is primarily men, and generally he exemplifies a masculine perspective on recovery from trauma. However, Flores says that she also found the character therapeutic in her own recovery from rape. Nnedi Okorafor, a Nigerian American science-fiction author, also writes that Wolverine was a therapeutic role model for her during her experience of paralysis following surgical treatment of scoliosis.

===Queer appeal and fandom===

While Wolverine is straight within the Earth-616 or main continuity of the comics, he has been depicted as being of differing sexual orientations in alternate timelines. Main continuity Wolverine&#x27;s relationship with Cyclops had often been acknowledged as homoerotic in both the comics, and in media adaptations. According to David Caballero of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; (&quot;CBR&quot;), the live-action film series &quot;did a considerable yet unintentional job encouraging the ship&quot;, which is one of the most popular X-Men-related ships on the fanfiction website Archive of Our Own. It has been argued that one of the reasons for the pairing&#x27;s popularity is that &quot;enemies-to-lovers stories remain a popular source of romantic entertainment&quot;.

Outside of his relationship with Cyclops, &quot;Screen Rant&quot;″s Alex Schlesinger has argued that taking into account their history in comics, there is &quot;some precedent set for Wolverine and Nightcrawler to be in an intimate relationship together&quot;. The &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; (2012–2013) series featured an alternate version of Wolverine who was in a relationship with Hercules, and the two characters shared an on-panel kiss in issue #10.

In 2012, ComicsAlliance assembled a panel consisting of various LGBT cartoonists, writers, editors, and journalists, to vote on which comics and characters had the biggest impact on them. As a group, the X-Men came in 13th place, with science fiction author and &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; writer Rachel Pollack stating that &quot;the X-Men&#x27;s themes are indelibly queer&quot;. Wolverine was one of the individual X-Men singled out by many panel members as being of great importance to them, with some of the reasons provided being that he is &quot;inspirational&quot;, while for others being their &quot;first crush&quot; as young queer comic readers.

Writing for Bleeding Cool, comics writer and columnist Rich Johnston described Wolverine as a &quot;gay icon amongst many&quot;, arguing that this was the case before Hugh Jackman first played the character in the live-action film series. Hannah Collins of &quot;CBR&quot; also described Wolverine as a gay icon and argued that his appeal to queer fans is &quot;largely invisible to heterosexual fans&quot;. Collins also described Wolverine&#x27;s muscular physique as similar to that of &quot;the idealized men found [in] &#x27;Bara&#x27; manga&quot;. &quot;Bara&quot; is genre of Japanese manga focusing on male same-sex love, created primarily by gay men for a gay male audience, and typically features masculine men with varying degrees of muscle, body fat, and body hair. Echoing Collins&#x27; statement over the character&#x27;s body, Ray Kampf described Wolverine in &quot;The Bear Handbook&quot; as an example of a bear in animation, with a contributor in the book who is gay admitting his attraction to the character growing up.

&quot;Wolverine&quot; #6 (2003), written by Greg Rucka, features a cover drawn by Esad Ribić. The cover depicts Wolverine sitting on a chair, drinking beer, and staring at Nightcrawler. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; notes how Nightcrawler is depicted in the nude, and that Wolverine is suggestively staring at his penis, with &quot;CBR&quot; also noting that the beer he is holding resembling an erection. According to Rucka, Ribić intentionally made the cover suggestive. Collins described the cover as helping &quot;bring [Wolverine&#x27;s queer appeal] to mainstream attention&quot;. According to Rucka, Ribić intentionally made the cover &quot;salacious&quot;, finding comedy in the fact that &quot;nobody at Marvel noticed&quot;.

==In other media==

Wolverine is one of the few X-Men characters appearing in every media adaptation of the &quot;X-Men&quot; franchise, including the 20th Century Fox &quot;X-Men&quot; films, television, computer and video games. Australian actor Hugh Jackman played Wolverine in the &quot;X-Men&quot; films and until December 2021 shared the Guinness World Record of the &quot;longest career as a live-action Marvel superhero&quot; with Patrick Stewart. Jackman would have regained that record in the 2024 film, &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;, but for the fact that Wesley Snipes reprised his even earlier role as the half-vampire Blade in the same film.

<text>MAX Machine (or simply MAX), also known as Ultimax in the United States and Canada and VC-10 in Germany, is a home computer designed and sold by Commodore International in Japan, beginning in November of 1982, a cousin to the popular Commodore 64, also sharing a lot of components with the C64. The Commodore 64 manual mentions the machine by name, suggesting that Commodore intended to sell the machine internationally; however, it is unclear whether the machine was ever actually sold outside Japan. When it was officially presented, in Tokyo, for the first time, it was named Commodore VICKIE.

The unit has a membrane keyboard and 2 KB of RAM internally and 0.5 KB of color RAM (1024 × 4 bits). It uses a television set for a display. It uses the same chipset and 6510 CPU as the Commodore 64, the same SID sound chip, and a MOS Technology 6566 graphics chip, a version of the VIC-II that powers the C-64 graphics for the MAX&#x27; static RAM. A tape drive could be connected for storage, but each cartridge had to implement its own cassette driver and protocol routines, so the tape could only be used by 2 of 24 released programs. The MAX also lacks the serial and user ports necessary to connect a disk drive, printer, or modem. The lack of any built-in operating system, not even a simple bootstrap OS, combined with the fact that all the software released for the platform are video games (besides a scaled down cartridge-based BASIC with no disk, modem, or printer support) positions the Max as a video game console rather than a home computer, despite sharing much of the Commodore 64&#x27;s chipset. The MAX&#x27;s 2KB of RAM also indicates it was intended as a games machine and not a personal computer. Even the Commodore PET, released five years earlier in 1977, had a minimum of 4K RAM, and rapidly 8K became the minimum. Even the VIC-20, heavily criticized for its minimal RAM, shipped with 5K of RAM.

Software is loaded from plug-in cartridges - turning on the MAX with no cartridge inserted yielded only a blank screen. Its ROM cartridge architecture was compatible with that of the C-64, so that MAX cartridges will work in the C-64. The MAX compatibility mode in C-64 was later frequently used for &quot;freezer&quot; cartridges (such as the Action Replay), as a convenient way to take control of the currently running program.

It was intended to sell for around US$200. Although the MAX had better graphics and sound capability, Commodore&#x27;s own VIC-20, which sold for around the same amount, was much more expandable, had a much larger software library, and had a better keyboard—all of which made it more attractive to consumers. The MAX never sold well and was quickly discontinued.

<doc id="302609" wikidata="Q782985" url="?curid=302609" title="King of the Romans">
<text>King of the Romans (; ) was the title used by the king of East Francia following his election by the princes from the reign of Henry II (1002–1024) onward.

The title originally referred to any German king between his election and coronation as Holy Roman Emperor by the pope. The title was also used to designate the successor to the throne elected during the lifetime of a sitting Emperor. From the 16th century onwards, as German kings adopted the title of Emperor-elect and ceased to be crowned by the pope, the title continued to be used solely for an elected successor to the throne during his predecessor&#x27;s lifetime.

The actual title varied over time. During the Ottonian period, it was King of the Franks (German: &quot;König der Franken&quot;, Latin: &quot;Rex Francorum&quot;), from the late Salian period it was King of the Romans (German: &quot;König der Römer&quot;, Lat.: &quot;Rex Romanorum&quot;). In the Modern Period, the title King in Germania (German: &quot;König in Germanien&quot;, Lat.: &quot;Germaniae Rex&quot;) came into use. Finally, modern German historiography established the term Roman-German King (&quot;Römisch-deutscher König&quot;) to differentiate it both from the classical Roman Emperor as well as from the modern German Emperor.

==Ruling kings==
===History and usage===

The territory of East Francia was not referred to as the Kingdom of Germany or &quot;Regnum Teutonicum&quot; by contemporary sources until the 11th century. During this time, the king&#x27;s claim to coronation was increasingly contested by the papacy, culminating in the fierce Investiture Controversy. After the Salian heir apparent Henry IV, a six-year-old minor, had been elected to rule the Empire in 1056 he adopted &quot;Romanorum Rex&quot; as a title to emphasize his sacred entitlement to be crowned Emperor by the Pope. Pope Gregory VII insisted on using the derogatory term &quot;Teutonicorum Rex&quot; (&quot;King of the Germans&quot;) in order to imply that Henry&#x27;s authority was merely local and did not extend over the whole Empire. Henry continued to regularly use the title &quot;Romanorum Rex&quot; until he finally was crowned Emperor by Antipope Clement III in 1084. Henry&#x27;s successors imitated this practice, and were also called &quot;Romanorum Rex&quot; before and &quot;Romanorum Imperator&quot; after their Roman coronations.

===Medieval practice===

Candidates for the kingship were at first the heads of Germanic stem duchies. As these units broke up, rulers of smaller principalities and even non-Germanic rulers were considered for the position. The only requirements generally observed were that the candidate be an adult male, a Catholic Christian, and not in holy orders. The kings were elected by several Imperial Estates (secular princes as well as Prince-Bishops), often in the imperial city of Frankfurt after 1147, a custom recorded in the &quot;Schwabenspiegel&quot; code in about 1275.

Originally all noblemen present could vote by unanimous acclamation, but later a franchise was granted to only the most eminent bishops and noblemen, and according to the Golden Bull of 1356 issued by Emperor Charles IV only the seven Prince-electors had the right to participate in a majority voting as determined by the 1338 Declaration of Rhense. They were the Prince-Archbishops of Mainz, Trier and Cologne as well as the King of Bohemia, the Count Palatine of the Rhine, the Saxon duke, and the Margrave of Brandenburg. After the Investiture Controversy, Charles intended to strengthen the legal status of the &quot;Rex Romanorum&quot; beyond Papal approbation. Consequently, among his successors only Sigismund and Frederick III were still crowned Emperors in Rome and in 1530 Charles V was the last king to receive the Imperial Crown at the hands of the Pope (in Bologna). The Golden Bull remained effective as constitutional law until the Empire&#x27;s dissolution in 1806.

After his election, the new king would be crowned as King of the Romans (&quot;Romanorum Rex&quot;), usually at Charlemagne&#x27;s throne in Aachen Cathedral by the Archbishop of Cologne in a solemnly celebrated ceremony. The details of Otto&#x27;s coronation in 936 are described by the medieval chronicler Widukind of Corvey in his &quot;Res gestae saxonicae&quot;. The kings received the Imperial Crown from at least 1024, at the coronation of Conrad II. In 1198 the Hohenstaufen candidate Philip of Swabia was crowned &quot;Rex Romanorum&quot; at Mainz Cathedral (as was King Rupert centuries later), but he had another coronation in Aachen after he had prevailed against his Welf rival Otto IV.

At some time after the ceremony, the king would, if possible, cross the Alps, to receive coronation in Pavia or Milan with the Iron Crown of Lombardy as King of Italy. Finally, he would travel to Rome and be crowned Emperor by the Pope. Because it was rarely possible for the elected King to proceed immediately to Rome for his crowning, several years might elapse between election and coronation, and some Kings never completed the journey to Rome at all. As a suitable title for the King between his election and his coronation as Emperor, &quot;Romanorum Rex&quot; would stress the plenitude of his authority over the Empire and his warrant to be future Emperor (&quot;Imperator futurus&quot;) without infringing upon the Papal privilege.

Not all Kings of the Romans made this step, sometimes because of hostile relations with the Pope, or because either the pressure of business at home or warfare in Germany or Italy made it impossible for the King to make the journey. In such cases, the king might retain the title &quot;King of the Romans&quot; for his entire reign.

===Later developments===
The title &quot;Romanorum Rex&quot; ceased to be used for ruling kings after 1508, when the Pope permitted King Maximilian I to use the title of &quot;Electus Romanorum Imperator&quot; (&quot;elected Emperor of the Romans&quot;) after he failed in a good-faith attempt to journey to Rome. At this time Maximilian also took the new title &quot;King in Germania&quot; (&quot;Germaniae rex&quot;, &quot;König in Germanien&quot;), but the latter was never used as a primary title.

Maximilian&#x27;s titles read, in part: &quot;&quot;Maximilian von Gots genaden erwelter Romischer Romischer kayser, zu allen zeiten merer des Reichs, in Germanien zu Hungern, Dalmatien, Croatien etc. kunig […]&quot; (&quot;Maximilian, by God&#x27;s grace Elected Roman Emperor, always Augustus, in Germany, of Hungary, Dalamatia, Croatia etc King […]&quot;

Beginning with Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, the rulers of the Empire no longer sought the Imperial coronation by the Pope and styled themselves &quot;Emperors&quot; without Papal approval, taking the title as soon as they were crowned in Germany or, if crowned in their predecessor&#x27;s lifetime, upon the death of a sitting Emperor.

==Heirs designate==
The Holy Roman Empire was an elective monarchy. No person had an automatic legal right to the succession simply because he was related to the current Emperor. However, the Emperor could, and often did, have a relative (usually a son) elected to succeed him after his death. This elected heir apparent bore the title &quot;King of the Romans&quot;.

During the Middle Ages, a junior King of the Romans was normally chosen only when the senior ruler bore the title of Emperor, so as to avoid having two, theoretically equal kings. Only on one occasion (1147–1150) was there both a ruling King of the Romans (King Conrad III) and a King of the Romans as heir (Henry Berengar). This practice continued from the 16th century onwards as the rulers of the Empire assumed the title &quot;Emperor elect&quot; without Imperial coronation by the Pope. The title of a King of the Romans now exclusively refers to the elected successor during his predecessor&#x27;s lifetime.

The election was in the same form as that of the senior ruler. In practice, however, the actual administration of the Empire was always managed by the Emperor (or Emperor elect), with at most certain duties delegated to the heir.

=== King of Rome ===
When Napoleon I, Emperor of the French, had a son and heir, Napoleon II (181132), he introduced the title as King of Rome (&quot;Roi de Rome&quot;), styling his son as such at birth. The boy was often known colloquially by this title throughout his short life. However, from 1818 onward, he was styled officially as the Duke of Reichstadt by his maternal grandfather, Emperor Francis I of Austria.

==List==

The following list shows all individuals bearing the title &quot;Kings of the Romans&quot;. The regnal dates given are those between a king&#x27;s election as &quot;King of the Romans&quot; and either becoming Emperor or ending their reign by deposition or death. Ruling kings are coloured in yellow, while those whose claim to the throne failed to achieve widespread support are coloured in pink. Individuals that bore the title &quot;Kings of the Romans&quot; solely as heirs designate are coloured in silver. &#x27;* &#x27; indicates that the king in question was elected in his predecessor&#x27;s lifetime.

<text>Attica (, &quot;Attikḗ&quot; or , or ), or the Attic Peninsula, is a historical region that encompasses the entire Athens metropolitan area, which consists of the city of Athens, the capital of Greece and the core city of the metropolitan area, as well as its surrounding suburban cities and towns. It is a peninsula projecting into the Aegean Sea, bordering on Boeotia to the north and Megaris to the west. The southern tip of the peninsula, known as Lavrio, was an important mining region.

The history of Attica is closely linked with that of Athens. In ancient times, Attica corresponded with the Athens city-state. It was the most prominent region in Ancient Greece, specifically during the Golden Age of Athens in the classical period. Ancient Attica (the classical Athens city-state) was divided into demoi, or municipalities, from the reform of Cleisthenes in 508/7 BC, grouped into three zones: urban (&quot;astu&quot;) in the region of Athens main town, and Piraeus (the port), coastal (&quot;paralia&quot;) along the coastline, and inland (&quot;mesogeia&quot;) in the interior.

The modern administrative region of Attica is more extensive than the historical region, and includes Megaris as part of the regional unit of West Attica, the Saronic Islands and Cythera, as well as the municipality of Troizinia on the Peloponnesian mainland.

==Eponymous name==
According to the Roman geographer Pausanias, the place was originally named Actaea, but was later renamed in the honour of Atthis, daughter of king Cranaus of Athens.

==Geography==

Attica is a triangular peninsula jutting into the Aegean Sea. It is naturally divided to the north from Boeotia by the long Cithaeron and Parnes mountain ranges.

To the west of Eleusis, the Greek mainland narrows into Megaris, connecting to the Peloponnese at the Isthmus of Corinth. The southwestern coast of Attica, also known as the Athens Riviera, forms the eastern coastline of the Saronic Gulf. Mountains separate the peninsula into the plains of Pedias, Mesogeia, and the Thriasian Plain. The mountains of Attica are the Hymettus, the eastern portion of the Geraneia, Parnitha (the highest mountain of Attica), Aigaleo and Penteli. Four mountains — Aigaleo, Parnitha, Penteli and Hymettus (clockwise from the southwest) — delineate the hilly plain on which the Athens urban area now spreads. The plain is pockmarked by a plethora of semi-continuous hills, the most notable ones being the Tourkovounia, Lykavittos, the Acropolis of Athens itself and Philopappou. Mesogeia lies to the east of Mount Hymettus and is bound to the north by the foothills of Mount Penteli, to the east by the Euboean Gulf and Mount Myrrhinous, and to the south by the mountains of Lavrio (modern Lavreotiki), Paneio (Πάνειον Όρος), and Laureotic Olympus (Λαυρεωτικός Όλυμπος). The Lavrio region terminates in Cape Sounion, forming the southeastern tip of the Attic peninsula.

Athens&#x27; water reservoir, Lake Marathon, is artificial and was created by damming in 1920. Pine and fir forests cover the area around Parnitha. Hymettus, Penteli, Myrrhinous and Lavrio are forested with pine trees, whereas the rest are covered by shrubbery. Parts of the sprawling forests of mount Penteli and Parnitha have been lost to forest fires, while the Synngrou Estate on the foothills of the former (intersecting the border between the suburban towns of Kifisia, Melissia and Marousi is home to the sole remaining natural forest in the Athenian plain.

The Kifisos is the longest river in Attica, which starts from the foothills of mount Parnitha near Varibobi, crosses the Athenian plain and empties into the delta of Faliro east of the port of Piraeus.

According to Plato, Attica&#x27;s ancient boundaries were fixed by the Isthmus, and, toward the continent, they extended as far as the heights of Cithaeron and Parnes. The boundary line came down toward the sea, bounded by the district of Oropus on the right and by the river Asopus on the left.

==History==
===Ancient history===

During antiquity, the Athenians boasted about being &#x27;autochthonic&#x27;, which is to say that they were the original inhabitants of the area and had not moved to Attica from another place. The traditions current in the classical period recounted that, during the Greek Dark Ages, Attica had become the refuge of the Ionians, who belonged to a tribe from the northern Peloponnese. Supposedly, the Ionians had been forced out of their homeland by the Achaeans, who in turn had been forced out of their homeland by the Dorian invasion. Supposedly, the Ionians integrated with the ancient Atticans, who, afterward, considered themselves part of the Ionian tribe and spoke the Ionian dialect of Ancient Greek. Many Ionians later left Attica to colonize the Aegean coast of Asia Minor and to create the twelve cities of Ionia.


During the Mycenaean period, the inhabitants of Attica lived in autonomous agricultural societies. The main places where prehistoric remains were found are Marathon, Rafina, Nea Makri, Brauron, Thorikos, Agios Kosmas, Elefsina, Menidi, Markopoulo, Spata, Aphidnae and Athens main city. All of these settlements flourished during the Mycenaean period.

According to tradition, Attica comprised twelve small communities during the reign of Cecrops, the legendary Ionian king of Athens. Strabo assigns these the names of Cecropia, Tetrapolis, Epacria, Decelea, Eleusis, Aphidna, Thoricus, Brauron, Cytherus, Sphettus, Cephisia, and possibly Phaleron. These were said to have been later incorporated in an Athenian state during the reign of Theseus, the mythical king of Athens. Modern historians consider it more likely that the communities were progressively incorporated into an Athenian state during the 8th and the 7th centuries BC. 

Until the 6th century BC, aristocratic families lived independent lives in the suburbs of Athens, such as Hippios Kolonos. Only after Peisistratos&#x27;s tyranny and the reforms implemented by Cleisthenes did the local communities lose their independence and succumb to the central government in Athens. As a result of these reforms, Attica was divided into approximately a hundred municipalities, the demes (&quot;dēmoi&quot;, δῆμοι), and also into three large sectors: the city (ἄστυ), which comprised the areas of central Athens, Ymittos, Aegaleo and the foot of Mount Parnes, the coast (παράλια), that included the area between Eleusis and Cape Sounion and the area around the city (ἐσωτερικό-μεσογαία), inhabited by people living on the north of Mount Parnitha, Penteliko and the area east of the mountain of Hymettus on the plain of Mesogeia. Principally, each civic unit would include equal parts of townspeople, seamen, and farmers. A &quot;trittýs&quot; (&quot;third&quot;) of each sector constituted a tribe. Consequently, Attica comprised ten tribes.

During the Peloponnesian war, Attica was invaded and raided several times by the Lacedaemonians, while in the war&#x27;s third phase the fortress of Decelea was captured and fortified by Lacedaemon.

====Fortresses====
During the classical period, Athens was fortified to the north by the fortress of Eleutherae, which is preserved well. Other fortresses are those of Oenoe, Decelea, Phyle and Aphidnae. To protect the mines at Laurium, on the coast, Athens was protected by the walls at Rhamnus, Thoricus, Sounion, Anavyssos, Piraeus, and Elefsina. Although these forts and walls had been constructed, Attica did not establish a fortification system until later, in the 4th century BC. Attica&#x27;s warfare is displayed by piles of rubble from fortresses from the Chremonidean war.

====Places of worship====
Even though archaeological ruins of religious importance are found in nearly the whole area of Attica, the most important are those found in Eleusis. The worship of the goddesses Demeter and Cora, beginning in the Mycenaean period, continued until the late years of antiquity.

Many other types of worship can be traced to the prehistory. For example, the worship of Pan and the Nymphs was common in many areas of Attica such as Marathon, Parnes and Ymittos. The god of wine, Dionysus, was worshipped mainly in the area of Icaria, now the suburb of Dionysus. Iphigeneia and Artemis were worshipped in Brauron, Artemis in Rafina, Athena on Sounion, Aphrodite on Iera Odos, and Apollo in Daphne.

The festival of Chalceia was celebrated every autumn in Attica. The festival honored the gods Hephaestus and Athena Ergane. In the deme of Athmonon, in modern-day Marousi, the Athmoneia games were also celebrated.

===Medieval period===


After the period of antiquity, Attica came under Roman, Byzantine, Venetian, and Ottoman rule. In the Roman period, the Scandinavian Heruli tribe raided Athens and Attica in 267 AD, destroying most of the city and laying waste to the countryside. During the Byzantine period Athens was an important middle size city. In 396 Attica was invaded by the Goths under the command of Alaric. Attica&#x27;s population diminished in comparison to the neighboring area of Boeotia.

The sites of historical interest date to the 11th and 12th centuries, when Attica was under the rule of the Franks. The great monastery of Dafni, that was built under Justinian I&#x27;s rule, is an isolated case that does not signify a widespread development of Attica during the Byzantine period. On the other hand, the buildings built during the 11th and 12th centuries show a greater development that continued during the rule of the Franks, who did not impose strict rule.

From the 14th century onwards, the Arvanites came to Attica from what is today southern Albania. They were mostly invited as mercenaries by the local Greek lords.

During the Ottoman rule, Athens enjoyed some rights. However, that was not the case for the villages of Attica. Great areas were possessed by the Turks, who terrorized the population with the help of sipahis. The monasteries of Attica played a crucial role in preserving the Greek element of the villages.

In spite of its conquerors, Attica managed to maintain its traditions. This fact is proved by the preservation of ancient toponyms such as Oropos, Dionysus, Eleusis, and Marathon.
During the Greek War of Independence in the 1820s, the peasants of Attica were the first to revolt (April 1821), occupying Athens and seizing the Acropolis that was handed over to the Greek revolutionaries in June 1822.

===Attica after 1829===


Attica belonged to the newly-founded Greek state from its founding. From 1834, Athens was made the new Greek capital (moved from Nafplio in Argolis), which caused the gradual repopulation of Attica by other people around Greece. The most dramatic surge came with Greek refugees from Anatolia following the Greek genocide and later the population exchanges between Greece and Turkey under the Treaty of Lausanne. Today, much of Attica is occupied by urban Athens, encompassing the entirety of the Athenian plain. The modern Greek region of Attica includes classical Attica as well as the Saronic Islands, a small part of the Peloponnese around Troezen, and the Ionian Island of Kythira.

<doc id="302617" wikidata="Q15699" url="?curid=302617" title="León, Spain">
<text>León (; ) is a city and municipality of Spain, capital of the province of León, part of the autonomous community of Castile and León, in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. It has a population of 124,303 (2019), by far the largest municipality in the province. The population of the metropolitan area, including the neighbouring San Andrés del Rabanedo and other smaller municipalities, accounts for around 200,000 inhabitants.

Founded as the military encampment of the &quot;Legio VI Victrix&quot; around 29 BC, its standing as an encampment city was consolidated with the definitive settlement of the &quot;Legio VII Gemina&quot; from 74 AD. Following its partial depopulation due to the Umayyad conquest of the peninsula, 910 saw the beginning of one of its most prominent historical periods, when it became the capital of the Kingdom of León, which took active part in the Reconquista against the Moors, and came to be one of the fundamental kingdoms of medieval Spain.

In 1188, the city hosted the first Parliament in European history under the reign of Alfonso IX, and this is why in 2010 it was acknowledged by professor John Keane, the King of Spain and the Junta of Castile and León, as the &quot;cradle of Parliamentarism&quot;. The Decreta of León were consequently included in the Memory of the World register by UNESCO in 2013. The city&#x27;s prominence began to decline in the early Middle Ages, partly due to the loss of independence after the union of the Leonese kingdom with the Crown of Castile, consolidated in 1301.

After a period of stagnation during the early modern age, it was one of the first cities to hold an uprising in the Spanish War of Independence, and some years later, in 1833 acquired the status of provincial capital. The end of the 19th and the 20th century saw a significant acceleration in the rate of urban expansion, when the city became an important communications hub of the northwest due to the rise of the coal mining industry and the arrival of the railroad.

León&#x27;s historical and architectural heritage, as well as the numerous festivals hosted throughout the year (particularly noteworthy are the Easter processions) and its location on the French Way of the Camino de Santiago, which is ranked as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, make it a destination of both domestic and international tourism. Some of the city&#x27;s most prominent historical buildings are the Cathedral, one of the finest examples of French-style classic Gothic architecture in Spain, the Basilica of San Isidoro, one of the most important Romanesque churches in Spain and resting place of León&#x27;s medieval monarchs, the Monastery of San Marcos, an example of plateresque and Renaissance Spanish architecture, and the Casa Botines, a Modernist creation of the architect Antoni Gaudí. An example of modern architecture is the city&#x27;s Museum of Contemporary Art or MUSAC.

==History==

===Roman origins===
León was founded in the 1st century BC by the Roman legion Legio VI &quot;Victrix&quot;, which served under Caesar Augustus during the Cantabrian Wars (29-19 BC), the final stage of the Roman conquest of Hispania. In the year 74 AD, the Legio VII &quot;Gemina&quot; —recruited from the Hispanics by Galba in 69 AD— settled in a permanent military camp that was the origin of the city. Its modern name, León, is derived from the city&#x27;s Latin name &quot;Castra Legionis&quot;.

The Romans established the site of the city to protect the recently conquered territories of northwestern Hispania from the Astures and Cantabri, and to secure the transport of gold extracted in the province —especially in the huge nearby mines of Las Médulas— that was taken to Rome through &quot;Asturica Augusta&quot; (modern-day Astorga).

Tacitus calls the legion &quot;Galbiana&quot;, to distinguish it from the old Legio VII &quot;Claudia&quot;, but this appellation is not found on any inscriptions. It appears to have received the appellation of &quot;Gemina&quot; on account of its amalgamation by Vespasian with one of the German legions, probably the Legio I &quot;Germanica&quot;. Its full name was Legio VII Gemina Felix. After serving in Pannonia, and in the civil wars, it was settled by Vespasian in Hispania Tarraconensis, to supply the place of the Legio VI &quot;Victrix&quot; and Legio X &quot;Gemina&quot;, two of the three legions ordinarily stationed in the province, but which had been withdrawn to Germany.

That its regular winter quarters, under later emperors, were at León, we learn from the Itinerary, Ptolemy, and the Notitiae Imperii, as well as from a few inscriptions; but there are numerous inscriptions to prove that a strong detachment of it was stationed at Tarraco (modern Tarragona), the chief city of the province.

Some elements of the original Roman encampment still survive in the modern city layout. Long sections of the Roman walls (built between the first century BC and the fourth century AD) are still standing. There are also archaeological exhibitions showing remains of the walls, gates, baths and an amphitheatre.

===Middle Ages===

The post-Roman history of the city is largely the history of the Kingdom of León. The station of the legion in the territory of the Astures grew into an important city, which resisted the attacks of the Visigoths until AD 586, when it was taken by Leovigild; and it was one of the few cities which the Visigoths allowed to retain their fortifications.

During the Umayyad conquest of Hispania, in 715 Tariq advanced from the area of La Rioja towards Astorga and León. The same fortress, which the Romans had built to protect the plain from the incursions of the mountaineers, became the advanced post which covered the mountain, as the last refuge of Cisastur Tribes. However, there is no notice of resistance whatsoever. An attempt was made by the invaders to settle the strongholds with Berbers came in a military capacity, but the scheme was abandoned when the Berbers of northern Iberia rebelled against the Arabs and gave up their positions to join the revolt around 740.

Towards the year 846, a group of Mozarabs (Christians who did not flee from the Muslims and lived under the Muslim regime) tried to repopulate the city, but a Muslim attack prevented that initiative. In the year 856, under the Christian king Ordoño I, another attempt at repopulation was made and was successful. Alfonso III of León and García I of León made León city the capital of the Kingdom of León and the most important of the Christian cities in Iberia.

The seat of the kingdom of Asturias moved to León in 910.

Sacked by Almanzor in about 987, the city was reconstructed and repopulated by Alfonso V, whose Decree of 1017 regulated its economic life, including the functioning of its markets. León was a way-station for pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago leading to Santiago de Compostela. With Alfonso V of León the city had the &quot;Fueru de Llión&quot;, an important letter of privileges.

In 1188, Alfonso IX of León gathered the three estates in the city of León (including representatives of the urban class) in the Cortes of León of 1188. Due to the written documentary corpus, the 1188 Cortes were recognised by the UNESCO in 2013 as &quot;cradle&quot; of parliamentarism.

Suburbs for traders and artisans sprang up, who, after the 13th century, began to influence the municipal government. During the early Middle Ages, the livestock industry produced a period of prosperity for the city.

Free from the &quot;seigneuralisation&quot; process of the Late Middle Ages, towards the end of the era León had consolidated as one of the 13 cities in the Meseta enjoying the right to vote at the Cortes of Castile.

===Modern history===
In the 16th century, economic and demographic decline set in and continued until the 19th century. For the extent of the Early Modern period the city remained controlled by a reduced set of noble families by means of the &quot;regimientos&quot; and &quot;regidurías&quot;.
The city population increased from 9,000 to 15,000 during the 19th century. The population further increased during the 20th century: 18,000 (1910), 44,000 (1940), 73,000 (1960), and 100,000 (1971). During the first decades of the 20th century, the city would be important as a railway center, with an significant socialist and anarchist labor movement, the city being the birthplace of Buenaventura Durruti, whose brother Manuel was killed in León during the Revolution of 1934.

The military coup d&#x27;état that marked the beginning of the Spanish Civil War took place (and succeeded) in León on 20 July 1936, with the putschist military officers meeting little resistance. The Catholic Church adhered to the rebels and instrumentalised the Catholic sentiment and traditions against the Republic. The rebels expanded from the city to the rest of the traditionally conservative province, which remained under rebel control except a small northern part connected to Asturias, that became part of the battlefront until the fall of the North in October 1937. Both the Convent of San Marcos, the old Santa Ana factory and the provincial prison were nonetheless rehabilitated as mass detention camps in the city by the Francoist side.

During the 1960s, León experienced much growth due to in-migration from the rural zones of the province.
==Main sights==

=== Churches ===

* León Cathedral, a rayonnant gothic building. It is one of the most relevant examples of the Gothic style in Spain, almost all of it built from 1205 to 1301. It contains one of the most extensive and best preserved collections of medieval stained glass in Europe, with at least 1,764 square meters of surface, most of it containing the original windows. 
*Basilica of San Isidoro, a highlight of Romanesque architecture in Spain. Built during the 11th and 12th centuries AD, the complex includes a subterranean Royal Pantheon with 12th century painted murals in an exceptional state of preservation.
*Convent of San Marcos (currently a luxurious Parador) built from the 16th century AD to the 18th. Its most striking feature is a highly ornamental plateresque façade.
*Church of &quot;San Salvador de Palat del Rey&quot;, the most ancient in the city (10th century), however with few remains of the original Pre-Romanesque building. As the name (meaning church of the &quot;Holy Savior of the King&#x27;s Palace&quot;) suggests, it once acted as royal chapel.
*Church of Nuestra Señora del Merdado, from the 11th century.
*Church of San Francisco, an active Catholic church, completed in 1791.
*Church of San Juan y San Pedro de Renueva, dating to 1944–1970, but including an 18th-century Baroque façade taken from the ruined monastery of San Pedro de Eslonza, located about outside the city.

=== Other historical buildings ===
*Roman Walls, built in the 1st century BC and enlarged in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. Long sections in the Eastern and Northern sides are preserved, as well as less complete parts in the Western side and some remains surrounded by other buildings in the Southern side. Some sections of a medieval wall built in the 13th and 14th centuries AD also exist in the Southern side. The wall can be visited in specific locations.
*Casa Botines, a neogothic styled building designed by Antoni Gaudí and built in 1891-1892 (one of the three Gaudí buildings outside Catalonia).
*Palacio de los Guzmanes, the site of the provincial &quot;diputación&quot; (parliament). It contains a patio in the plateresque style by Gil de Hontañón.

*Palacio del Conde Luna (14th century).
*Palacio de los Marqueses de Prado, a 17th-century Baroque building, currently the Hospital Nuestra Señora de Regla.

=== Museums ===
*MUSAC. It is a contemporary art museum which opened in 2005. Its design by the architectural studio Mansilla+Tuñón was awarded with the 2007 European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture. One of the building&#x27;s most distinctive features is its façade formed out of thousands of large multicolored stained-glass panels. Close to the museum is the León Auditorium, also projected by Mansilla+Tuñón, which has an equally striking presence of crisp white cubes perforated by irregularly set windows.
*Museo de León, which contains a collection of prehistorical tools and art from the Roman, Medieval and Modern periods.
*Museo Sierra-Pambley, a house from the Age of Enlightenment

=== Other areas and sights ===
*Plaza Mayor (main square).
*Plaza del Grano.
*Barrio Húmedo (the drinking and partying area).
*University of León.
==Folklore and customs==

Leonese customs include the Semana Santa (&quot;Holy Week&quot;), featuring numerous processions through the centre of the city. One of them is the so-called &quot;Procession of the Meeting&quot;, which acts out the meeting of three groups representing Saint John, the Virgin Mary and Christ, in the esplanade in front of the old council. Associated with Semana Santa is the procession called &quot;The Burial of Genarín&quot;. &quot;Genarín&quot; was an alcoholic beggar who was hit and killed by the first garbage truck in the city of León in the year 1929. This is a celebration of alcohol, and the main purpose of the people who attend it is getting drunk in honor to the alcoholic beggar.

The San Juan and San Pedro festivities are also remarkable, celebrated during the last week of June (between June 23 and June 29). During these days several concerts and festivals take place and the whole city is occupied by terraces and street markets where Leonese people celebrate the beginning of the summer, especially on San Juan&#x27;s night (June 23) when fireworks and bonfires take place.

===Public transport===

==Leonese language==

===History===
The Leonese language derives directly from Latin and developed in the Middle Ages. At this time, Leonese was the official language of the Leonese Kingdom and achieved a high codification grade in the city of Llión. The first written text in Leonese was &quot;Nodicia de Kesos&quot; (959 or 974); other works in the language include &quot;Fueru de Llión&quot;, &quot;Fueru de Salamanca&quot;, &quot;Fueru Xulgu&quot;, &quot;Códice d&#x27;Alfonsu XI&quot;, ou &quot;Disputa d&#x27;Elena y María&quot; or &quot;Llibru d&#x27;Alixandre&quot;.

Leonese is considered a seriously endangered language by UNESCO. It is almost extinct, being known and spoken by only a very few elderly people who live isolated in the mountains of the northern part of the province of León. However, people who wish to separate León from Castile and who support Leonese autonomy are trying to revive the language. León City Council and Leonese language associations like the Asociación Cultural de la Llingua Llïonesa El Fueyu are promoting its knowledge and use.

Leonese Language Day started in 2006 with the support of Leonese Provincial Government, and from 2008 the celebration is organised by the León City Council.

===Teaching===
At the end of the 1990s, several associations unofficially promoted Leonese language courses. In 2001, the Universidad de León (University of León) created a course for Teachers of Leonese language, and local government developed Leonese language courses for adults. The Leonese Language Teachers and Monitors Association (Asociación de Profesores y Monitores de Llingua Llïonesa) was created in 2008 and promotes Leonese language activities.

Leonese lessons in schools started in 2008, and it is currently taught in sixteen schools in León city in 2008–2009, promoted by the Leonese Local Government Department for Education. This course is for pupils in their 5th and 6th year of primary school (11- and 12-year-olds), where Leonese language is taught with Leonese culture.

More than one hundred people are studying Leonese in adult classes in 2008–2009. There are five levels for adults in the official courses developed by the Department for Leonese Culture of the Leonese City Council.

==Government==
The Leonese City Council was founded in 1345. It has 27 city councillors.

In the last municipal elections (26 May 2019) the results were:

* Spanish Socialist Workers Party (&quot;Partido Socialista Obrero Español&quot;, PSOE) - 30.31% of the votes and 10 councillors
* Partido Popular - 29.61% votes and 9 councillors
* Ciudadanos - 13.98% and 4 councillors
* Unión del Pueblo Leonés - 9.42% and 3 councillors
* Podemos-Equo - 5.35% and 1 councillor

The mayor is José Antonio Diez, from the PSOE.

León is in the county (&quot;comarca&quot;) of Tierras de León.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
León is twinned with:

* Baeza, Spain
* Bragança, Portugal
* Chartres, France

* León, Mexico
* Porto, Portugal
* Puebla, Mexico
* Viseu, Portugal
* Voronezh, Russia
* Xiangtan, China
==Food==

Within the wide range of Leonese cuisine the following dishes are the most representative: cecina (cured, smoked beef meat), morcilla (a blood sausage), botillo (a dish of meat-stuffed pork intestine), garlic soup, el cocido leonés (a mix of meat with vegetables and chickpeas, served after a vegetable-vermicelli soup) and mantecadas (pastry).
Another very important part of the gastronomy of León are the tapas, which are usually given free with drinks, unlike in the rest of Spain. It is very common to go &quot;de tapas&quot; or &quot;tapear&quot; i.e. to go for a few drinks (&quot;un corto&quot;, which is a very small beer, &quot;una caña&quot;, which is roughly half a pint of beer or &quot;un vino&quot;, a glass of wine, or a “butano”, a small glass of orange soda) just before lunch but more normally as a light form of dinner.

<doc id="302618" wikidata="Q212841" url="?curid=302618" title="Drama, Greece">
<text>Drama ( ) is a city and municipality in Macedonia, northeastern Greece. Drama is the capital of the regional unit of Drama which is part of the East Macedonia and Thrace region. The city (pop. 44,257 in the 2021 census) is the economic center of the municipality (pop. 55,679), which in turn comprises 60 percent of the regional unit&#x27;s population. The next largest communities in the municipality are Χiropótamos (2,535), Choristi (pop. 2,512), Kallífytos (1,627), Kalós Agrós (838), and Koudoúnia (814).

Built at the foot of mount Falakro, in a verdant area with abundant water sources, Drama has been an integral part of the Hellenic world since the classical era; under the Byzantine Empire, Drama was a fortified city with a castle and rose to great prosperity under the Komnenoi as a commercial and military junction.

During the Ottoman era, tobacco production and trade, the operation of the railway (1895) and improvement of the road network towards the port of Kavala, led to an increase in the population of the city and to the enhancement of commercial activity.

Drama hosts the &quot;Eleftheria&quot;, cultural events in commemoration of the city&#x27;s liberation, at the end of June or beginning of July, and an annual film festival in September.

==Name==
Archaeological finds show that in the area of the modern city there used to be an ancient Greek settlement named &quot;Dyrama&quot; (Greek: Δύραμα) or alternatively &quot;Hydrama&quot; (Greek: Ύδραμα), both meaning &quot;rich in water&quot;. Some scholars associate Drama with the ancient Greek Drabescus (). Hydrama was notable as the place of worship for many gods of classical Greek mythology, especially Apollo and Artemis. With the passage of time Dyrama became Drama. In the South Slavic languages, the city is known as Драма which is itself a transliteration of the Greek name.

==History==
The ancient Greeks knew the city as Hydrama or Dyrama (Ύδραμα, Δύραμα) owing to its abundant water. Later known as Drabescus, it became part of the Roman and Byzantine Empires along with the rest of Greece.

=== Byzantine Era ===
During the early Christian period (4th–7th centuries), Drama was a small fortified settlement closely tied both administratively and religiously to the declining Roman colony of Philippi. Over time, Drama emerged as the region&#x27;s most important urban center, a status it maintained during the Middle Byzantine period. Around the 10th century, the city was heavily fortified and flourished as a significant military and commercial hub.

Following the Fourth Crusade, Drama and its surrounding region became contested territory. It fell under the control of various powers, including the Kingdom of Thessalonica, the Bulgarians, the Serbs, and the Despotate of Epirus, before being reclaimed by the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty. Empress Irene of Montferrat, wife of Andronikos II, died in Drama during this period. However, the city was destabilized by the Byzantine civil wars of the 14th century, struck by the plague, and fell under Serbian control in 1345. Although briefly recaptured by the Byzantines in 1371, Drama was ultimately seized by the Ottomans in 1383, marking the definitive end of Byzantine rule in the area.

=== Ottoman Era ===
The Ottoman Empire conquered the region in 1383. In 1519 (Hijri 925) the town had 116 Muslim and 153 Christian households; it was in the jurisdiction of the &quot;beylerbey&quot; of Rumeli, Ferhad Pasha. In the 19th century, the town became centre of the Sanjak of Drama. In 1912, during the First Balkan War, Bulgarian troops took Drama from the Ottomans. In 1913, as a result of the Treaty of Bucharest following the Second Balkan War, the area became part of Greece - along with the rest of eastern Macedonia.

===World War II===

During World War II, in the wake of the 1941 German invasion of Greece, Bulgarian troops occupied Drama from 1941 to 1944.

On 28 September 1941, the local communist party organized a series of guerrilla attacks against the occupying forces in the villages of Drama and the surrounding villages. In response, the Bulgarian occupation forces applied harsh reprisals in Drama, Doxato and several villages like Choristi, Kyrgia, Koudounia, and Prosotsani. The following day, 29 September, the leaders of the attacks were all killed in battle or in their attempts to escape to the German occupation zone. Bulgarian troops moved into Drama to suppress the uprising and arrested all men between 18 and 45. They were reported to have executed between 360 and 500 people in Drama. According to the Bulgarian military reports, up to 1,600 Greeks were killed in the uprising and in the weeks that followed.

The massacres precipitated an exodus of Greeks from the Bulgarian to the German occupation zone in Central Macedonia. The terror and famine became so severe that the government in Athens considered plans for evacuating the entire Greek population to German-occupied Greece.

On 4 March 1943, after midnight, the Bulgarian military authorities rounded up the Jewish population across their zone of occupation in eastern Macedonia and Thrace. The 4,000-strong community, including 589 Jews from Drama, was carried by train into Bulgarian territory and assembled in tobacco warehouses, which were empty at that time of year. From there they were taken by train to the Treblinka extermination camp. None of the 589 Jews from Drama ever returned.

==Geography==
===Climate===

Drama has a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and chilly, wet winters.
==Municipality==
The municipality Drama was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 2 former municipalities, that became municipal units (constituent communities in brackets):
*Drama (Choristi, Drama, Kallifytos, Kalos Agros, Koudounia, Livadero, Makryplagio, Mavrovatos, Mikrochori, Monastiraki, Mylopotamos, Nikotsaras, Xiropotamos)
*Sidironero (Sidironero, Skaloti)

The municipality has an area of 840.103 km2, the municipal unit 488.830 km2.

==Population==
==Economy==
In the recent past, the economy of the Drama area relied heavily on the local paper and textile-clothing industries. However, these industries have either closed down or moved across the border to Bulgaria, because of the low demands of the Bulgarian workforce, with a negative impact on the local economy and employment. The situation worsened after 2007, when Bulgaria was admitted to the EU, and local Greek businessmen moved to expand their operations there. Other sources of revenue include agriculture, consisting mainly of tobacco plantations, small-scale mining (particularly of marble) and forestry. Recently, there have been efforts to exploit the rich local natural environment and to develop ecotourism.

There is a modern ski resort on Mount Falakro. Drama also hosts an annual short film festival.

==Transport==
===Rail transport===
The town is served by Drama railway station on the Thessaloniki-Alexandroupoli line, with daily services to Thessaloniki and Alexandroupolis.

==Culture==
Since 1978, Drama has hosted the Drama International Short Film Festival. In 1987, the festival was recognized nationally. In 1995, it added the International competition section, where short films from all over the world visit the city every year. In 1996, the festival was included in the National Cultural Network of Cities by the Greek Ministry of Culture.

===Churches===

====Hagia Sophia Church====
Hagia Sophia is the oldest surviving preserved monument in Drama. It was built during the tenth century AD, along with Drama&#x27;s city walls. It was probably erected on the site of a previous early Christian basilica. During the Ottoman rule, it was turned into a mosque.

===Museums===

====Archaeological Museum====
The Archaeological Museum of Drama covers human presence in the regional unit of Drama from the mid-Paleolithic Period (50,000 years before present) with traces of life from Paleolithic hunts in the caves of the source of the Angitis, up to modern times (1913).

The exhibition space consists of three main halls. In the first, archaeological finds from the cave of Maara give witness to the presence of nomadic hunters in the area from the mid-Palaeolithic period, while other finds demonstrate the life of settled farmers and animal rearers from Neolithic villages and the passage of the Copper Age in the city of Drama and the village of Sitagri. The reproduction of a Neolithic house with finds which describe the activities of Neolithic man and his daily activities is the main centre of interest for visitors of all ages.

Bust of Dionysius, found in the area of Kali Vrysi. The same hall continues the journey through time to the Iron Age and later years where the main element was the worship of Dionysius at the city of Drama itself and at Kali Vrysi and other areas of the regional unit. In the second hall architectural sculptures, pottery and coins confirm that life continued in the city and throughout the whole regional unit during early Christian, Byzantine and post-Byzantine years.

The visitor is taken through modern recent history by a photographic exhibition relating to the city of Drama, the towns of the regional unit and the mountain villages. The exhibition covers the period from the beginning of the Ottoman period up to the middle of the 19th century. In the third hall which is roofed with an atrium, the visitor can admire sculptures arranged into three thematic groups. The first includes architectural sculptures dating from ancient times up to Turkish occupation. The second contains votive monuments connected with the worship of various gods in the Greco-Roman pantheon as well as local deities, with particular reference to Dionysius while the third group of sculptures focuses on funerary monuments from Hellenistic and Roman times.

====Ecclesiastical Museum====
The history of the Christian Church in Drama began during the Byzantine period and underwent difficult and troubled times. From the 14th century when the city was captured by the Ottomans until the 20th century with successive foreign occupations, the Greek Orthodox Church in Drama struggled without end, fed by the blood of many faithful, martyrs to the faith and to the Hellenic ideal and provided succor to its followers through difficult periods.

The collection of icons dating from Byzantine times to the 20th century forms the basic core of the museum&#x27;s exhibits. The Museum of the Cathedral of Drama, founded during the reign of the honourable Bishop Dionysius 1st, is now housed in a recently restored five-storey wing of the Bishop of Drama&#x27;s palace on Venizelou St. In the spacious and well-attended halls, ecclesiastical treasures of priceless spiritual and artistic value are on exhibition. The Icons of the Virgin Ηοdegetria and the Blessing Lord from the 13th century, icons from the 17th century and particularly from the 19th century decorate and sanctify the place. Moreover, the episcopal canonicals, holy vessels and their covers, many from the 19th century, relics of Chrysostomos of Drama and Smyrni, constitute the most important exhibits in the museum.

Many of the exhibits are relics brought by refugees from Asia Minor and Pontus in 1922 from the churches of their ancient homes to their new home, valuable reminders of who they were and where they came from. Organized groups of pilgrims and visitors to the city are advised to contact the office of the Diocese of Drama before visiting the museum to make arrangements.

<text>Serres ( ) is a city in Macedonia, Greece, capital of the Serres regional unit and second largest city in the region of Central Macedonia, after Thessaloniki.

Serres is one of the administrative and economic centers of Northern Greece. The city is situated in a fertile plain at an elevation of about , some northeast of the Strymon river and north-east of Thessaloniki, respectively. Serres&#x27; official municipal population was 70,703 in 2021.

The city is home to the Department of Physical Education and Sport Science of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki () and the Serres Campus of the International Hellenic University (former &quot;Technological Educational Institute of Central Macedonia&quot;), composed of the Faculty of Engineering, the Faculty of Economics and Management, and the Department of Interior Architecture and Design. The head of the Faculty of Engineering of the International Hellenic University is located in Serres.

==Names==
The Ancient Greek historian Herodotus mentions the city as &quot;Siris&quot; (Σίρις) in the 5th century BC. Theopompus refers to the city as &quot;Sirra&quot; (Σίρρα). Later, it is mentioned as &quot;Sirae&quot;, in the plural, by the Roman historian Livy. Since then the name of the city has remained plural and by the 5th century AD it was already in the contemporary form as &quot;Serrae&quot; or &quot;Sérrai&quot; (Σέρραι) (plural), which remained the Katharevousa form for the name till modern times. In the local Greek dialect, the city is still known as &quot;ta Serras&quot; (τα Σέρρας), which is actually a corruption of the plural accusative &quot;tas Serras&quot; (τας Σέρρας) of the archaic form &quot;Serrae&quot;. The oldest mention of this form is attested in a document of the Docheiariou Monastery in Mount Athos from 1383, while there are many other such references in documents from the 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. It was known as &quot;Serez&quot; or &quot;Siroz&quot; in Turkish. In the Slavic languages, the city is known as &quot;Ser&quot; (Сер) in Macedonian, while in Bulgarian it is known as &quot;Syar&quot; (Сяр) or &quot;Ser&quot; (Сер). In Aromanian, Serres is known as or .

==History==

===Antiquity===
Although the earliest mention of Serres (as Siris) is dating in the 5th century BC (Herodotus), the city was founded long before the Trojan War, probably at the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. The ancient city was built on a high and steep hill (known as &quot;Koulas&quot;) just north of Serres. It held a strategic position, since it controlled a land road that followed the valley of the river Strymon from the shores of Strymonian Gulf to the Danubian countries.

The most ancient known inhabitants of the area were the Bryges (Phrygians) and Strymonians. Afterwards were the Paeonian tribes of the Siropaiones (since 1100 BC) and Odomantes (from the early 5th century BC until the end of antiquity). These populations mainly engaged in agriculture and cattle-raising especially worshiped the Sun, the deified river Strymon and later the &quot;Thracian horseman&quot;.

The ancient city of Serraepolis was founded in Cilicia by Siropaiones exiled from Serres.

===Roman era===
During the Roman period (168 BC – 315 AD) the city is mentioned in sources under the name &quot;Sirra&quot; (Σίρρα) and in inscriptions as &quot;Sirraion polis&quot; (Σιρραίων πόλις, ). It was an important city of the Roman province of Macedonia, with the status of a &quot;civitas stipendaria&quot;. It flourished especially during the imperial period thanks to the &quot;Pax Romana&quot;. Then, during the great crisis of the Roman Empire (235–284 AD), the city declined and only in the times of Diocletian, with its reforms (Tetrarchic system), returned to prosperity.

As regards the urban structure it featured, like all Greek cities, a market (&quot;agora&quot;), parliament (&quot;bouleuterion&quot;), theater, gymnasium and temples. As we know from epigraphic evidence, the local government was also based on the known Greek institutions, which were the parliament (&quot;boule&quot;), the citizen body (&quot;demos&quot;) and the archons (&quot;politarchai&quot;, &quot;agoranomoi&quot;, &quot;gymnasiarchai&quot;, high priests etc.). It was also the seat of a federation of five cities (&quot;Pentapolis&quot;) and actively participated in the provincial life and organization of the Macedonians; while many residents, mostly members of the local aristocracy, had received the right of Roman citizenship and were promoted to senior provincial dignities.

As a city-state (&quot;polis&quot;), apart from the usual Greek institutions, Sirra also had its own territory (&quot;chora&quot;), which roughly coincided with the area of the modern province of Serres. The organization of its territory was based on villages (&quot;komai&quot;, sing. &quot;kome&quot;), whose many sites have been found in various places near modern villages, such as Lefkonas, Oreini, Ano Vrontou, Neo Souli, Agio Pnevma, Chryso, Paralimnio etc. Within the limits of its territory have also discovered traces of marble quarries and iron mines, which indicate systematic exploitation of the existing mineral wealth in the imperial period (1st to 3rd century AD).In terms of population, except the most numerous Greek element, are recognized some population substrates even from prehistoric times. Concerning the society, the main feature was its distinction in upper (rich) and lower (poor) social strata (&quot;honestiores&quot; and &quot;humiliores&quot; in Latin). Finally, concerning the cults of the residents, except the known panhellenic cults (Dionysus, Zeus, Dioscuri, Apollo, Asclepius, Artemis and Isis), are evidenced and some local and Thracian cults as the Thracian horseman (or &quot;Hero&quot;). 
Many inscriptions of Roman (imperial) times have been found in the city (and to the early 1960s in the surrounding area). From these inscriptions (almost all written in Greek and only three in Latin), the eight are votive or honorific and all other on epitaph reliefs or steles.

===Middle Ages===
The first attested bishop of the city is recorded as participating in the Second Council of Ephesus in 449.


In Emperor Nikephoros I rebuilt the town and installed a strong garrison against the Slavic tribes of the Balkans. The city&#x27;s history was uneventful until the 10th century, being in the heartland of the Byzantine Greek world, until it was pillaged and briefly occupied by the Bulgarians. In 1185, the environs of the city were pillaged by a Norman invasion, and in the Battle of Serres in 1195/6 the Byzantines were defeated by the rebellious Bulgarian ruler Ivan Asen I. After the Fourth Crusade, Boniface of Montferrat took over the city, but shortly after Kaloyan of Bulgaria defeated the Crusaders of the Latin Empire and captured the city, until it was retaken by the Crusaders in the early 1230s. According to George Akropolites, Kaloyan almost destroyed the city, reducing it from a sizeable urban centre to a small settlement clustered around the fortified citadel, while the lower town was protected by a weak stone wall.

The city returned to Byzantine rule in 1246, when it was captured by the Nicaean Empire. By the 14th century, the city had regained its former size and prosperity, so that Nikephoros Gregoras called it a &quot;large and marvelous&quot; city. Taking advantage of the Byzantine civil war of 1341–47, the Serbs besieged and took the city on 25 September 1345. It became the capital of Stefan Dušan&#x27;s Serbian Empire. Dušan rebuilt the citadel for the last time. After Dušan&#x27;s death in 1355 his realm fell into feudal anarchy, and Serres became a separate principality, initially under Dušan&#x27;s Empress-dowager Helena and after 1365 by the Despot Jovan Uglješa. Jovan Uglješa maintained close political and cultural ties to the Byzantine court in Constantinople, and the Greek element rose again to prominence: local Greeks played a major role in his administration, which was carried out in the Greek language. After the 1371 Battle of Maritsa, the Byzantines under Manuel II Palaiologos (then governor of Thessalonica) retook Serres.

===Ottoman period===

Serres fell to the Ottoman Empire for the first time briefly in 1371, and definitely on 19 September 1383—although the Ottoman sources give several earlier and contradictory dates, the date is securely established by multiple Greek sources.

The city (Siroz in Turkish) and the surrounding region became a fief of Evrenos Beg, who brought in Yörük settlers from Sarukhan. Oral sources report that the terms of surrender guaranteed to the Greek population possession of its city quarters and churches, while the Turks were to settle outside the Byzantine walls, which were soon demolished to prevent any rebellion. The new Turkish quarters were established to the west and south of the walls, and named after their military leaders. The Grand Vizier Çandarlı Kara Halil Hayreddin Pasha built the town&#x27;s first mosque, the Old Mosque (&quot;Eski Camii&quot;), now destroyed, in 1385, as well as the Old Baths (&quot;Eski Hammam&quot;). In the same year, Sultan Murad I used the city as a base for operations against the Serbs. During the Ottoman Interregnum, the rebel Sheikh Bedreddin was executed in the city in 1412. Although never rising to particular prominence within the Ottoman Empire, Serres became the site of a mint from 1413/14 on.

In 1454/55, the city is estimated to have had some 6,200 inhabitants. The Muslim population grew steadily, and in the 15th century there were 25 Muslim to 45 Christian quarters. Towards the end of the 15th century, the first Sephardi Jews arrived from Sicily and Spain, and the Grand Vizier Koca Mustafa Pasha funded various public and charitable buildings in the city. In the early 16th century, Serres was visited by the French traveller Pierre Belon, who reported that the town was mainly inhabited by Greeks alongside German and Sephardi communities, while the people in the surrounding country spoke Greek and Bulgarian. In 1519 (Hijri 925) the town had 684 Muslim and 545 Non-Muslim households 54 of which being Jewish households; it was a has of the Sultan. In the aftermath of the Christian victory at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, Turkish reprisals were directed at the Greek population, who had risen in revolt. The metropolitan cathedral of Serres was looted along with seven other churches, while land and land titles owned by the Monastery of St John the Baptist were confiscated.

Much information on the town&#x27;s history in the years 1598–1642 is given by the chronicle of the priest Synadinos, a former merchant who became a priest. The town is also described in some detail by the 17th-century Ottoman travellers Haji Khalifa and Evliya Çelebi, as well as the Capuchin friar Robert de Dreux. Evliya records a prosperous settlement, comprising the 10 Christian quarters of the old town, and 30 Muslim quarters in the new town, with about 2,000 and 4,000 houses respectively, 12 main mosques and 91 smaller ones, 26 madrasahs, two tekkes and five baths. It boasted a large market, among the most important in the region of Macedonia, with 2,000 shops and 17 khans.
In the 18th and early 19th centuries, Serres was an autonomous lordship (beylik) under a succession of derebeys, within the Sanjak of Salonica. At the end of the 18th century, Serres was a cotton-producing area, exporting 50,000 balls of cotton to Germany, France, Venice and Livorno. The metropolitan bishop Gabriel founded in 1735 the Greek School of Serres, which he directed until 1745. The school was maintained by donations from wealthy Greek merchants, among them Ioannes Constas from Vienna with 10,800 florins and the banker and tragic leader of the Greek War of Independence in Macedonia Emmanouil Pappas, who donated 1,000 Turkish silver coins. Minas Minoides taught philosophy and grammar in 1815–19. The school operated also in the period of the Greek War of Independence under Argyrios Paparizou from Siatista.

A great fire in 1849 destroyed most of the city&#x27;s 31 surviving churches. Serres became a regular province as the Sanjak of Siroz of the Salonica Eyalet (later Salonica Vilayet). In the late 19th century, the kaza of Serres had a total population of 83.499, consisting of 31.210 Muslims, 31.148 Greeks, 19.494 Bulgarians, 995 Jews, 5 Armenians and 647 foreign citizens, and ranked, along with Monastir and Salonica, as one of the most important towns in Macedonia.

The development of railways, highways and sea transport by steamship diminished the importance of the annual fairs for which the city was famous, and commercial activity declined in the late 19th century. In 1886, the Greek colonel N. Schinas described the city as having 28,000 inhabitants, 26 churches and 22 mosques, two Greek and six Turkish schools, 24 khans and an enclosed market. The city recovered some of its importance when it was connected via railway to Salonica and Constantinople in 1896. During the last decades of Ottoman rule, the once dominant cultivation of cotton was replaced by tobacco.

In the early 20th century, the city became a focus of anti-Ottoman unrest, which resulted in the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising of 1903.

The Ottoman census of 1905 registered 42,000 inhabitants.

===Modern period===


A Bulgarian army commanded by General Georgi Todorov captured Serres during the First Balkan War on November 6, 1912, but was forced to withdraw by Greek forces commanded by the King of Greece, Constantine I, during the Second Balkan War. The first officer of the Hellenic Army to enter Serres was infantry colonel Napoleon Sotilis, head of the 7th Infantry Regiment on July 11, 1913.

Prior to abandoning the city, the Bulgarians set fire to it, which burned down much of the old Byzantine town, as well as many of the newer Muslim quarters. As the National Schism erupted in Greece during the First World War, Serres was temporarily occupied by the Central Powers after King Constantine ordered the local garrison not to resist to a token force of the Imperial German Army; eventually the city was liberated in 1917 by Greek-French Entente forces under the Venizelos government.

During the Second World War, after the conquest of mainland Greece by Nazi Germany in April 1941 (which was followed by the conquest of Crete in June), Serres was assigned by the Nazis to their Bulgarian allies (along with the rest of East Macedonia and Thrace and the island of Thasos), who occupied the city until the Allied liberation of Greece in 1944. In 1943, Serres&#x27; Jewish population was deported by the Gestapo to the Treblinka death camp and exterminated. There was a significant resistance movement in the city during the occupation, led by the left-wing National Liberation Front (EAM).

In the postwar years, the city&#x27;s population grew substantially, and there was also a significant rise in the standard of living. The long-serving conservative Greek Prime Minister Constantine Karamanlis (in office from 1955 to 1963 and again from 1974 to 1980) was a native of Serres, and as a result its people could count on the support of the central Greek government in Athens. However, the villages in the plains around the city were not so lucky; the low prices of agricultural products led many people of these villages to emigrate, mostly to the United States and West Germany.

, the Mayor of Serres is Petros Angelidis (independent, formerly a member of PASOK).

==Municipality==

The present Serres municipality was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 6 former municipalities, that became municipal units of the new municipality: Ano Vrontou, Kapetan Mitrousi, Lefkonas, Oreini, Serres, and Skoutari.

Serres has a hot summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csa&quot;) with some Humid (&quot;Cfa&quot;) influences. Serres has an irregular precipitation pattern throughout the year and rainfall is fairly light year round. July and August are the driest months. Due to its inland location Serres has particularly hot summers, while winters are cool but rarely very cold. According to the HNMS climate Atlas the Serres regional unit reaches an average annual sunshine close to 2.600 hours. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Serres was on January 27, 1963 while the highest was on July 25, 2007. In June 2024, the Hellenic National Meteorological Service station in Serres reached a mean maximum temperature of which is along with Sparta Greece&#x27;s record for June. Also, in July 2024 Serres reached a mean maximum temperature of which is Greece&#x27;s record to date. 

==Economy==

Serres is the capital of a primarily agricultural district and is an important trade centre for tobacco, grain, and livestock. Following the development of a government-sponsored manufacturing area in the late 20th century, it has also become a centre for the production of textiles and other manufactured items. Various products, meat and dairy, are also produced by breeding at Lake Kerkini.

<text>Tsingtao Brewery Co. Ltd. () is China&#x27;s second largest brewery, with about 15% of domestic market share and also accounts for half of China&#x27;s national beer exports. The brewery was founded in 1903 as an Anglo–German business with the brewery under the supervision of master brewers from Germany in Tsingtao (modern-day Qingdao), Kiautschou Bay Leased Territory, a area leased by the government of China to Imperial Germany.

In 2016, Tsingtao beer was the second most consumed beer globally and had reached 2.8% share of the global beer market, after its share of the world&#x27;s beer market had been steadily growing by at least 0.1 percentage points every year since 2009. Tsingtao is currently the sixth largest brewery in the world. Its logo displays an image of Huilan Pavilion that stands on the end of Zhanqiao Pier, located on Qingdao&#x27;s southern shore.

==History==
Tsingtao Brewery was founded by the Anglo-German Brewery Co. Ltd., an English-German joint stock company based in Hong Kong which owned it until 1916. The brewery sold beers to mainly Europeans in China. The brewery was founded on August 15, 1903, as the Germania-Brauerei Tsingtao Co., Ltd (&quot;Germania&quot; Brewery) with a paid-in capital of 400,000 Mexican silver dollars divided into 4,000 shares priced at $100 each.

;Founding members of the Supervisory Board
* John Prentice, of SC Farnham, Boyd &amp; Co., Ltd., Shanghai
* Alexander McLeod, of Gibb, Livingston &amp; Co., Shanghai
* C. W. Wrightson, of Fearon, Daniel &amp; Co., Shanghai
* Max Slevogt, of Slevogt &amp; Co., Shanghai
* J. Jürgen Block, of H. Sietas &amp; Co., Qufu

;Brewery Directors
* Heinrich Seifart (1904–November 25, 1907)
* Ernst Siemssen (November 1907 – 1914)

;Brewmasters
* R. Schuster (1904–05)
* Martin Wehle (1906–14)

The first beer was served on December 22, 1904.

Following the Siege of Tsingtao during World War I, Qingdao came under Japanese military control. On August 16, 1916, an extraordinary general meeting was held in Shanghai. Liquidators were appointed and it was decided the company would be sold to the Dai-Nippon Brewery (, which in 1949 would be split into Asahi Breweries and what later became Sapporo Brewery). The Japanese military administration in Qingdao approved the liquidation on September 9, 1916. German equity was approximately 70 percent. The German share of the sales price attributable to shareholders was in the hands of the liquidators by April 2, 1921.

===Nationalization===
After Japan&#x27;s surrender to the Allies and its retreat from China at the end of World War II, the Tsingtao Brewery was turned into a Chinese brewery under ownership of the Tsui family and the supervision of the Nationalist government in Nanjing. However, that period of ownership only lasted until 1949 when, after the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, the new People&#x27;s Republic of China confiscated all the shares in the Tsingtao Brewery, that had previously belonged to the Tsui family, and the business became a state-owned enterprise.

===Privatization===
The company was privatized in the early 1990s and in 1993 merged with three other breweries in Qingdao and was finally renamed Tsingtao Brewery Company Limited. In June 1993, Tsingtao Brewery became the first Chinese firm listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

At one point 27% of the company was owned by Anheuser-Busch. The company once owned several other breweries in China, some of which also produced Tsingtao Beer.

On January 23, 2009, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced that it was selling 19.9% to Asahi Breweries for $667 million. The sale would make Asahi Breweries, Ltd. the second largest shareholder in Tsingtao behind only the Tsingtao Brewery Group. On May 9, 2009, Anheuser-Busch InBev sold its remaining 7% to Chinese tycoon Chen Fashu () for $235 million.

In January 2017, Asahi Breweries announced that it would sell its 20 percent share in Tsingtao which it had owned since 2009; the value of this share of the company was estimated at US$1.1 billion.

==Beers==
&quot;Tsingtao Beer&quot;, a well-hopped standard pale lager of 4.7% abv, is the flagship brew, accounting for most of the brewery&#x27;s production. An unpasteurized version is sold as &quot;Tsingtao Draft Beer&quot;. Tsingtao Beer was long advertized as being &quot;brewed with mineral water from the Laoshan Spring&quot;, which contributed to its characteristic flavor, but that now applies only to beer produced in Qingdao, and not to those produced in the company&#x27;s other breweries.

The brewery also produces a number of other beers, mostly for the local market. Those sometimes found outside China include &quot;Tsingtao Dark Beer&quot; (5.2% abv), and more rarely &quot;Tsingtao Spirulina Green Beer&quot;, also sold as &quot;Tsingtao Green Beer&quot;, a 4.5% abv green pilsner colored by spirulina and claimed to promote good health. The alcohol content of export versions may vary slightly from those for the domestic market.

==Export orientation==

The beer market in China was very underdeveloped in the 1980s and the brewery was forced to concentrate on overseas markets. The Chinese economic reforms in the early 1980s facilitated exportation. However, while concentrating on international markets, the brewery also attempted to sell its beer on the domestic market and competed with other domestic brands as well as foreign brands.

The main export company for the brewery was the &quot;Good Harvest of Five Grains Corporation&quot; based in Hong Kong. The Good Harvest of Five Grains Corporation also tried to market the beer in Hong Kong itself and later built a wholesale network consisting of up to 300 companies.

Tsingtao Beer was introduced to the United States in 1972, and soon became the top-selling Chinese beer in the U.S. market; it has maintained this leadership within the United States ever since, despite increasing competition from other well known Chinese beer brands, Zhujiang and Yanjing. , distribution in the UK and Ireland was handled by C&amp;C Group PLC. The Tsingtao brand is sold in 62 countries and regions around the world, and accounts for more than 50% of China&#x27;s beer exports. According to the company&#x27;s financial figures from 2010, Tsingtao saw a 6.6% year-on-year revenue increase from sales to Hong Kong and other overseas markets.

==National marketing==

Before the 1949 takeover by the new PRC government, the brewery had used imported raw material and water from the Laoshan mountain. With the outbreak of the Korean War and the resulting embargo of the People&#x27;s Republic by the West, the brewery was forced to use domestic products, and the government encouraged peasants in Shandong to harvest the necessary raw materials (mainly hops and barley) themselves. The government used various incentives, like free seeds, to achieve this goal.

The brewery had previously used nationalistic marketing strategies, and after the switchover to production using only domestic material this nationalist marketing effort was increased. However, the brewery still maintained its international roots.

===International Beer Festival===
The brewery first applied for permission for a Qingdao International Beer Festival in 1991 and received approval and support from the Qingdao municipal administration, even to the extent that the city became the main sponsor. The first festival was opened on June 23, 1991, and has been held annually ever since. The festival was named &quot;&quot;International&quot; Beer Festival&quot; to attract foreigners as well as Chinese, although the main purpose of the festival was to make the brand more popular for domestic consumers.

The festival is usually held in late August and lasts for 14 days. During the festival, there are shows in the city and people enjoy many varieties of international beer instead of only Tsingtao. Nowadays the International Beer Festival is not meant simply to publicize the Tsingtao Brewery, but also to encourage the development of Qingdao&#x27;s beer culture.

==Controversies==
On October 23, 2023, a video of a worker urinating into a brewery tank went viral on social media.

He starred as Steve McGarrett in the CBS television program &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, which ran from 1968 to 1980.

== Early years ==
Born in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, New York, Lord was the son of Irish-American parents. His father, William Lawrence Ryan, was a steamship company executive. He grew up in Richmond Hill, Queens, New York.

As a child, Lord developed equestrian skills on his mother&#x27;s fruit farm in the Hudson River Valley. He started spending summers at sea, and from the decks of cargo ships painted and sketched the landscapes he encountered—Africa, the Mediterranean and China. He was educated at St. Benedict Joseph Labre School, John Adams High School, in Ozone Park, Queens, and the United States Merchant Marine Academy, then located at Fort Trumbull in New London, Connecticut, graduating as an Ensign with a Third Mate’s License. He attended New York University (NYU) on a football scholarship and earned a degree in Fine Arts.

Lord spent the first year of the United States&#x27; involvement in World War II with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, building bridges in Persia. He returned to the Merchant Marine as an able seaman before enrolling in the deck officer course at Fort Trumbull. While making maritime training films, Lord took to the idea of acting.

== Career ==
Lord received theatrical training from Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse. He worked first as a car salesman for Horgan Ford, then later as a Cadillac salesman in New York to fund his studies. Later he studied at the Actors Studio.

His Broadway debut was as Slim Murphy in Horton Foote&#x27;s &quot;The Traveling Lady&quot; with Kim Stanley. The show ran for 30 performances, October 27, 1954, through November 20, 1954. Lord won the Theatre World Award for his performance. Lord was then cast as Brick as a replacement for Ben Gazzara in the 1955–1956 production of &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;. He had been in &quot;The Little Hut&quot; (his first play), &quot;The Illegitimist&quot;, and &quot;The Savage&quot;.

Lord&#x27;s first commercial film role was in the 1949 film &quot;Project X&quot;, an anti-Communist production. He was associate producer in his 1950 film &quot;Cry Murder&quot;. In 1957, Lord starred in &quot;&quot;, which has run daily at Colonial Williamsburg since then. In 1958, Lord co-starred as Buck Walden in &quot;God&#x27;s Little Acre&quot;, the film adaptation of Erskine Caldwell&#x27;s 1933 novel.

Lord was the first actor to play the character Felix Leiter in the James Bond film series, introduced in 1962 in the first Bond film, &quot;Dr. No&quot;. According to screenwriter Richard Maibaum, Lord then demanded co-star billing, a bigger role and more money to reprise the role in &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, which resulted in director Guy Hamilton casting Cec Linder in the role; thereafter, until David Hedison played the role for a second time in 1989&#x27;s &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;, the character would be played by a different actor for each appearance.

In 1962, Lord starred as series namesake &quot;Stoney Burke&quot;, a rodeo cowboy from Mission Ridge, South Dakota. The basis for the series was real-life champion rodeo rider Casey Tibbs. The series featured Warren Oates and Bruce Dern in recurring supporting roles. Lord credited Gary Cooper as his on-screen role model and the inspiration for his characterization of Stoney Burke.

Lord was considered for Eliot Ness in &quot;The Untouchables&quot; before Robert Stack won the role. He did appear in the Season One episode &quot;The Jake Lingle Killing.&quot; In 1965, he guest-starred as Colonel &#x27;Pres&#x27; Gallagher in second-season episode 5, &quot;Big Brother&quot; of &quot;12 O&#x27;Clock High&quot;. Other television guest appearances include &quot;Appointment with Adventure&quot;, &quot;The Americans&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;The High Chaparral&quot;, &quot;Combat!&quot;, &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, &quot;The Reporter&quot; starring Harry Guardino, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;The Invaders&quot;, &quot;Rawhide&quot;, &quot;Ironside&quot;, and &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;

Lord appeared on the first episode of &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel&quot;. In 1968, he appeared with Susan Strasberg in the film &quot;The Name of the Game Is Kill!&quot;.

According to William Shatner, in 1966, Gene Roddenberry offered Lord the role of Captain James T. Kirk on &quot;Star Trek&quot; to replace Jeffrey Hunter, whose wife was making too many demands. Lord asked for 50 percent ownership of the show, so Roddenberry offered the role to Shatner.

=== &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; ===

Lord starred in &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; for its 12 seasons (1968 to 1980) as Detective Steve McGarrett, appointed by the governor to head the (fictional) State Police criminal investigation department in Honolulu, Hawaii. The opening sequence includes a shot of Lord standing on a penthouse balcony of the Ilikai hotel. Chin Ho Kelly, the name of the police detective played by Kam Fong, was a tip-of-the-hat to Ilikai developer Chinn Ho. Lord&#x27;s catchphrase “Book &#x27;em, Danno!&quot; became a part of pop culture. In the original run of the series (but not in syndication), at the end of each episode would be a promo: &quot;This is Jack Lord inviting you to be with us next week for (name of episode). Be here. Aloha!&quot; He was instrumental in the casting of native Hawaiians, instead of mainland actors. Lord insisted his character drive Ford vehicles; McGarrett drove a 1967 Mercury Park Lane in the pilot, a 1968 Park Lane from 1968 to 1974, and a 1974 Mercury Marquis for the remainder of the series (this very car was shown in the 2010 remake).

When series creator Leonard Freeman died in 1974, the show&#x27;s ownership was shared among Lord, CBS, and Freeman&#x27;s estate, with a contract that made Lord executive producer and gave him complete control over content. He was a hands-on partner who paid attention to minute details and was known for battles with network executives.

The seventh season premiere of the rebooted &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; featured an appearance that featured the old and new versions of Steve McGarrett, made possible through CGI. To execute this concept, permission was first secured from Lord&#x27;s estate, managed by a bank that required a script review. With the estate&#x27;s approval, work began. Counter Punch Studios created a CG version of Jack Lord&#x27;s face, working with Picture Shop visual effects to add realistic skin textures based on images from Lord&#x27;s final season in the original series.

Cinematographers sometimes refer to a 50mm lens (&quot;5-0&quot;) as a &quot;Jack Lord&quot; in reference to the name of the show that made him famous.

== Artist ==
During his years at NYU, Lord and his brother Bill opened the Village Academy of Arts. Jack&#x27;s childhood dream was to become an artist. His first professional sale was in 1941 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for his two linoleum cuts, entitled &quot;Vermont&quot; and &quot;Fishing Shacks, Block Island&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1942, Lord married his first wife, Ann Willard. They divorced in 1947. Their union produced a son, but Lord only saw him once when the boy was an infant. On August 24, 1955, his son died, aged 12 years, following a brief battle with hepatitis (he is buried in Fairfield County, Connecticut [state file number 14006]). Lord only learned of his son&#x27;s death after receiving a copy of his death certificate from his son&#x27;s mother. Ann Willard Ryan remarried in the 1950s and died on December 30, 2004.

Lord met his second wife while house hunting in upstate New York. On January 17, 1949, Lord married fashion designer Marie de Narde (1905-2005), a job she gave up to devote her time to him and his career. Until 1957, the couple lived near the Lescaze House on East 48th Street in New York before moving to California.

==Death==
After &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; ended its run in 1980, Lord kept a low profile and was rarely seen in public. His final TV appearance was that same year in a failed pilot for a new CBS series called &quot;M Station: Hawaii&quot; which he also directed (it had been filmed in early 1979, immediately before shooting the final season of &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;). Lord suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease for at least seven years before his death, although some accounts have suggested that he may have had the illness as early as the final season of &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, in 1979. He died of congestive heart failure at his home in Honolulu, on January 21, 1998, at the age of 77, leaving an estate of $40 million. He predeceased his &quot;Five-O&quot; co-star Richard Denning, who died nine months later in October 1998. He was a philanthropist and the entire estate went to Hawaiian charities upon his wife Marie&#x27;s death in 2005.

== Memorial ==
A bronze bust of Lord by Hawaii sculptor Lynn Weiler Liverton was unveiled in a ceremony at the Kahala Mall outside Macy&#x27;s on June 19, 2004. The Lords lived in a condominium in the Kahala area, and they were known to frequent the neighborhood mall. The nonprofit Jack Lord Memorial Fund, which raised the money for the memorial, was co-chaired by British &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; fan Esperanza Isaac and Lord&#x27;s co-star Doug Mossman.

<text>Arta () is one of the regional units of Greece. It is part of the Epirus region. Its capital is the town of Arta.

==Geography==

The regional unit of Arta is located north of the Ambracian Gulf. The main mountain ranges are the Athamanika in the northeast, the Pindus in the east, and Valtou in the southeast. Only one mountain road links Arta with the Pineios valley and Thessaly. There are low-lying agricultural plains in the west. Arta borders on the regional units of Preveza in the west, Ioannina to the north, Trikala in the east, Karditsa to the east and Aetolia-Acarnania to the south.

The main rivers are the Acheloos in the east, the Arachthos in the centre, and the Louros in the west. Most of the population lives in the west, in the Arachthos valley, south and east of Arta. The Athamanika and Valtou mountains are the least populated.

==Administration==

The regional unit Arta is subdivided into 4 municipalities. These are (number as in the map in the infobox):
*Arta (1)
*Central Tzoumerka (&quot;Kentrika Tzoumerka&quot;, 3)
*Georgios Karaiskakis (2)
*Nikolaos Skoufas (4)

===Prefecture===

Arta was established as a prefecture in 1882 (). As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Arta was created out of the former prefecture Arta. The prefecture had the same territory as the present regional unit. At the same time, the municipalities were reorganised, according to the table below.

==History==
Arta was one of the capitals of the Despotate of Epirus in the late Middle Ages. The territory of the regional unit was ceded to Greece in 1881 by the Ottoman Empire, along with Thessaly, in accordance with the 1878 Congress of Berlin. A famous landmark of Arta is the Old Bridge over the Arachthos river.

==Transport==

As one of the first completed sections of the future Ionia Odos linking Ioannina with Patras and Kalamata, the motorway bypass of the GR-5 around Arta was opened in 1997. The main highways are:

*Greek National Road 5/E55, S, Cen., W
*Greek National Road 21, W
*Greek National Road 30, Cen., E

<text>Ioannina ( &#x27; ), often calledYannena(&#x27; ) within Greece, is the capital and largest city of the Ioannina regional unit and of Epirus, an administrative region in northwestern Greece. According to the 2021 census, the city population was 64,896 while the municipality had 113,978 inhabitants. It lies at an elevation of approximately above sea level, on the western shore of Lake Pamvotis (). Ioannina is located northwest of Athens, southwest of Thessaloniki and east of the port of Igoumenitsa on the Ionian Sea.

The city&#x27;s foundation has traditionally been ascribed to the Byzantine Emperor Justinian in the 6th century AD, but modern archaeological research has uncovered evidence of Hellenistic settlements. Ioannina flourished in the late Byzantine period (13th–15th centuries). It became part of the Despotate of Epirus following the Fourth Crusade and many wealthy Byzantine families fled there following the 1204 sack of Constantinople, with the city experiencing great prosperity and considerable autonomy, despite the political turmoil. Ioannina surrendered to the Ottomans in 1430 and until 1868 it was the administrative center of the Pashalik of Yanina. In the period between the 18th and 19th centuries, the city was a major center of the modern Greek Enlightenment. Ioannina was ceded to Greece in 1913 following the Balkan Wars.

The city is also characterized by various green areas and parks, including Molos (Lake Front), Litharitsia Park, Pirsinella Park (Giannotiko Saloni), Suburban Forest. There are two hospitals, the General Hospital of Ioannina &quot;G. Hatzikosta&quot;, and the University Hospital of Ioannina. It is also the seat of the University of Ioannina. The city&#x27;s emblem consists of the portrait of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian crowned by a stylized depiction of the nearby ancient theater of Dodona.

==Name==
The city&#x27;s formal name, &quot;Ioannina&quot;, is probably a corruption of &quot;Agioannina&quot; or &quot;Agioanneia&quot;, &#x27;place of St. John&#x27;, and is said to be linked to the establishment of a monastery dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, around which the later settlement (in the area of the current Ioannina Castle) grew.

According to another theory, the city was named after Ioannina, the daughter of Belisarius, general of the emperor Justinian.

There are two forms of the name in Greek, &quot;Ioannina&quot; being the formal and historical name, while the colloquial and much more commonly used &quot;Υannena&quot; or &quot;Υannina&quot; () represents the vernacular tradition of Demotic Greek. The demotic form also corresponds to those in the neighboring languages (e.g., or , , , ).

==History==

=== Antiquity and early Middle Ages ===

The first indications of human presence in Ioannina basin are dated back to the Paleolithic period (24,000 years ago) as testified by findings in the cavern of Kastritsa. During classical antiquity the basin was inhabited by the Molossians and four of their settlements have been identified there. Despite the extensive destruction suffered in Molossia during the Roman conquest of 167 BC, settlement continued in the basin albeit no longer in an urban pattern.

The exact time of Ioannina&#x27;s foundation is unknown, but it is commonly identified with an unnamed new, &quot;well-fortified&quot; city, recorded by the historian Procopius as having been built by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I for the inhabitants of ancient Euroia. This view is not supported, however, by any concrete archaeological evidence. Early 21st-century excavations have brought to light fortifications dating to the Hellenistic period, the course of which was largely followed by later reconstruction of the fortress in the Byzantine and Ottoman periods. The identification of the site with one of the ancient cities of Epirus has not yet been possible.

It is not until 879 that the name Ioannina appears for the first time, in the acts of the Fourth Council of Constantinople, which refer to one Zacharias, Bishop of Ioannine, a suffragan of Naupaktos. After the Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria, in 1020 Emperor Basil II subordinated the local bishopric to the Archbishopric of Ohrid. The Greek archaeologist K. Tsoures dated the Byzantine city walls and the northeastern citadel of the Ioannina Castle to the 10th century, with additions in the late 11th century, including the south-eastern citadel, traditionally ascribed to the short-lived occupation of the city by the Normans under the leadership of Bohemond of Taranto in 1082. In a chrysobull to the Venetians in 1198, the city is listed as part of its own province (&quot;provincia Joanninorum&quot; or &quot;Joaninon&quot;). In the treaty of partition of the Byzantine lands after the Fourth Crusade, Ioannina was promised to the Venetians, but in the event, it became part of the new state of Epirus, founded by Michael I Komnenos Doukas.

=== Late Middle Ages (1204–1430) ===
Under Michael I, the city was enlarged and fortified anew. The Metropolitan of Naupaktos, John Apokaukos, reports how the city was but a &quot;small town&quot;, until Michael gathered refugees who had fled Constantinople and other parts of the Empire that fell to the crusaders of the Fourth Crusade, and settled them there, transforming the city into a fortress and &quot;ark of salvation&quot;. Despite frictions with local inhabitants who tried in 1232 to expel the refugees, the latter were eventually successfully settled and Ioannina gained in both population and economic and political importance. In the aftermath of the Battle of Pelagonia in 1259, much of Epirus was occupied by the Empire of Nicaea, and Ioannina was placed under siege. Soon, however, the Epirote ruler Michael II Komnenos Doukas, aided by his younger son John I Doukas, managed to recover their capital of Arta and relieve Ioannina, evicting the Nicaeans from Epirus. In or , John I Doukas, now ruler of Thessaly, launched a raid against the city and its environs, and a few years later an army from the restored Byzantine Empire unsuccessfully laid siege to the city. Following the assassination in 1318 of the last native ruler, Thomas I Komnenos Doukas, by his nephew Nicholas Orsini, the city refused to accept the latter and turned to the Byzantines for assistance. On this occasion, Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos elevated the city to a metropolitan bishopric, and in 1319 issued a chrysobull conceding wide-ranging autonomy and various privileges and exemptions on its inhabitants. A Jewish community is also attested in the city in 1319. In the Epirote revolt of 1337–1338 against Byzantine rule, the city remained loyal to Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos. Soon afterwards Ioannina fell to the Serb ruler Stephen Dushan and remained part of the Serbian Empire until 1356, when Dushan&#x27;s half-brother Simeon Uroš was evicted by Nikephoros II Orsini. The attempt of Nikephoros to restore the Epirote state was short-lived as he was killed in the Battle of Achelous against Albanian tribes., but Ioannina was not captured. It thus served as a place of refuge for many Greeks of the region of Vagenetia. In 1366–67 Simeon Uroš, having recovered Epirus and Thessaly, appointed his son-in-law Thomas II Preljubović as the new overlord of Ioannina. Thomas proved a deeply unpopular ruler, but he nonetheless repelled successive attempts by Albanian chieftains including a surprise attack in 1379, whose failure the Ioannites attributed to intervention by their patron saint, Michael.

After Thomas&#x27; murder in 1384, the citizens of Ioannina offered their city to Esau de&#x27; Buondelmonti, who married Thomas&#x27; widow, Maria. Esau recalled those exiled under Thomas and restored the properties confiscated by him. In 1389, Ioannina was besieged by Gjin Bua Shpata, and only with the aid of an Ottoman army was Esau able to repel the Albanians. Despite the ongoing Ottoman expansion and the conflicts between Turks and Albanians in the vicinity of Ioannina, Esau managed to secure a period of peace for the city, especially following his second marriage to Shpata&#x27;s daughter Irene in . Following Esau&#x27;s death in 1411, the Ioannites invited the Count palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos, Carlo I Tocco, who had already been expanding his domains into Epirus for the last decade, as their new ruler. By 1416 Carlo I Tocco had managed to capture Arta as well, thereby reuniting the core of the old Epirote realm, and received recognition from both the Ottomans and the Byzantine emperor. Ioannina became the summer capital of the Tocco domains, and Carlo I died there in July 1429. Carlo I&#x27;s army, as well as the army of the city of Ioannina itself both before and during Carlo I&#x27;s rule, was composed primarily of Albanians. His oldest bastard son, Ercole, called on the Ottomans for aid against the legitimate heir, Carlo II Tocco. In 1430 an Ottoman army, fresh from the capture of Thessalonica, appeared before Ioannina. The city surrendered after the Ottoman commander, Sinan Pasha, promised to spare the city and respect its autonomy.

===Ottoman period (1430–1913)===

Under Ottoman rule, Ioannina remained an administrative centre, as the seat of the Sanjak of Ioannina, and experienced a period of relative stability and prosperity. The first Ottoman tax registers for the city dates to 1564, and records 50 Muslim households and 1,250 Christian ones; another register from 15 years later mentions Jews as well.

In 1611 the city suffered a serious setback as a result of a peasant revolt led by Dionysius the Philosopher, the Metropolitan of Larissa. The Greek inhabitants of the city were unaware of the intent of the fighting as previous successes of Dionysius had depended on the element of surprise. Much confusion ensued as Turks and Christians ended up indiscriminately fighting friend and foe alike. The revolt ended in the abolition of all privileges granted to the Christian inhabitants, who were driven away from the castle area and had to settle around it. From then onwards, Turks and Jews were to be established in the castle area. The &quot;School of the Despots&quot; at the Church of the Taxiarchs, that had been operating since 1204, was closed. Aslan Pasha also destroyed the monastery of St. John the Baptist within the city walls in 1618 erected in its place the Aslan Pasha Mosque, today housing the Municipal Ethnographic Museum of Ioannina. The Ottoman reprisals in the wake of the revolt included the confiscation of many &quot;timars&quot; previously granted to Christian &quot;sipahis&quot;; this began a wave of conversions to Islam by the local gentry, who became the so-called &quot;Tourkoyanniotes&quot; (Τoυρκογιαννιώτες). The Ottoman traveller Evliya Çelebi, who visited the city in , counted 37 quarters, of which 18 Muslim, 14 Christian, 4 Jewish and 1 Gypsy. He estimated the population at 4,000 hearths.

====Center of Greek Enlightenment (17th–18th centuries)====

Despite the repression and conversions in the 17th century, and the prominence of the Muslim population in the city&#x27;s affairs, Ioannina retained its Christian majority throughout Ottoman rule, and the Greek language retained a dominant position; Turkish was spoken by the Ottoman officials and the garrison, and the Albanian inhabitants used Albanian, but the &quot;lingua franca&quot; and native language of most inhabitants was Greek, including among the &quot;Tourkoyanniotes&quot;, and was sometimes used by the Ottoman authorities themselves.

The city also soon recovered from the financial effects of the revolt. In the late 17th century Ioannina was a thriving city with respect to population and commercial activity. Evliya Çelebi mentions the presence of 1,900 shops and workshops. The great economic prosperity of the city was followed by remarkable cultural activity. During the 17th and 18th centuries, many important schools were established. Its inhabitants continued their commercial and handicraft activities which allowed them to trade with important European commercial centers, such as Venice and Livorno, where merchants from Ioannina established commercial and banking houses. The Ioannite diaspora was also culturally active: Nikolaos Glykys (in 1670), Nikolaos Sarros (in 1687) and Dimitrios Theodosiou (in 1755) established private printing presses in Venice, responsible for over 1,600 editions of books for circulation in the Ottoman-ruled Greek lands, and Ioannina was the centre through which these books were channeled into Greece. These were significant historical, theological as well as scientific works, including an algebra book funded by the Zosimades brothers, books for use in the schools of Ioannina such as the &quot;Arithmetica&quot; of Balanos Vasilopoulos, as well as medical books. At the same time these merchants and entrepreneurs maintained close economic and intellectual relations with their birthplace and founded charity and education establishments. These merchants were to be major national benefactors.

Thus the &quot;Epiphaniou&quot; School was founded in 1647 by a Greek merchant of Ioannite origin resident in Venice, Epiphaneios Igoumenos. The &quot;Gioumeios&quot; School was founded in 1676 by a benefaction from another wealthy Ioannite Greek from Venice, Emmanuel Goumas. It was renamed &quot;Balaneios&quot; by its rector, Balanos Vasilopoulos, in 1725. Here worked several notable personalities of the Greek Enlightenment, such as Bessarion Makris, the priests Georgios Sougdouris (1685/7–1725) and Anastasios Papavasileiou (1715–?), the monk Methodios Anthrakites, his student Ioannis Vilaras and Kosmas Balanos. The &quot;Balaneios&quot; taught philosophy, theology and mathematics. It suffered financially from the dissolution of the Republic of Venice by the French and finally stopped operation in 1820. The school&#x27;s library, which hosted several manuscripts and epigrams, was also burned the same year following the capture of Ioannina by the troops the Sultan had sent against Ali Pasha. The Maroutses family, also active in Venice, founded the Maroutsaia School, which opened in 1742 and its first director Eugenios Voulgaris championed the study of the physical sciences (physics and chemistry) as well as philosophy and Greek. The &quot;Maroutsaia&quot; also suffered after the fall of Venice and closed in 1797 to be reopened as the Kaplaneios School thanks to a benefaction from an Ioannite living in Russia, Zoes Kaplanes. Its schoolmaster, Athanasios Psalidas had been a student of Methodios Anthrakites and had also studied in Vienna and in Russia. Psalidas established an important library of thousands of volumes in several languages and laboratories for the study of experimental physics and chemistry that aroused the interest and suspicion of Ali Pasha. The &quot;Kaplaneios&quot; was burned down along with most of the rest of the city after the entry of the Sultan&#x27;s armies in 1820. These schools took over the long tradition of the Byzantine era, giving a significant boost to the Greek Enlightenment. &quot;During the 18th century&quot;, Neophytos Doukas wrote with some exaggeration, &quot;every author of the Greek world, was either from Ioannina or was a graduate of one of the city&#x27;s schools.&quot;

====Ali Pasha&#x27;s rule (1788–1822)====
In 1788 the city became the center of the territory ruled by Ali Pasha, an area that included the entire northwestern part of Greece, southern parts of Albania, Thessaly as well as parts of Euboea and the Peloponnese. The Ottoman-Albanian lord Ali Pasha was one of the most influential personalities of the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. Born in Tepelenë, he maintained diplomatic relations with the most important European leaders of the time and his court became a point of attraction for many of those restless minds who would become major figures of the Greek Revolution (Georgios Karaiskakis, Odysseas Androutsos, Markos Botsaris and others). During this time, however, Ali Pasha committed a number of atrocities against the Greek population of Ioannina, culminating in the sewing up of local women in sacks and drowning them in the nearby lake, this period of his rule coincides with the greatest economic and intellectual prosperity of the city. As a couplet has it &quot;The city was first in arms, money and letters&quot;.

When the French scholar François Pouqueville visited the city during the early years of the 19th century, he counted 3,200 homes (2,000 Christian, 1,000 Muslim, 200 Jewish). The efforts of Ali Pasha to break away from the Sublime Porte alarmed the Ottoman government, and in 1820 (the year before the Greek War of Independence began) he was declared guilty of treason and Ioannina was besieged by Turkish troops. Ali Pasha was assassinated in 1822 in the monastery of St Panteleimon on the island of the lake, where he took refuge while waiting to be pardoned by Sultan Mahmud II.

====Last Ottoman century (1822–1913)====
The &quot;Zosimaia&quot; was the first significant educational foundation established after the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1828). It was financed by a benefaction from the Zosimas brothers and began operating in 1828 and fully probably from 1833. It was a School of Liberal Arts (Greek, Philosophy and Foreign Languages). The mansion of Angeliki Papazoglou became the &quot;Papazogleios&quot; school for girls as an endowment following her death; it operated until 1905.

In 1869, a great part of Ioannina was destroyed by fire. The marketplace was soon reconstructed according to the plans of the German architect Holz, thanks to the personal interest of Ahmet Rashim Pasha, the local governor. Communities of people from Ioannina living abroad were active in financing the construction of most of the city&#x27;s churches, schools and other elegant buildings of charitable establishments. The first bank of the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman Bank, opened its first branch in Greece in Ioannina, which shows the power of the city in world trade in the 19th century. As the 19th century came to a close, signs of national agitation emerged among some parts of the city&#x27; s population. In 1877 for example, Albanian leaders sent a memorandum to the Ottoman government demanding, among other things, the establishment of Albanian language schools and various Muslim Albanians of the Vilayet formed in Ioannina a committee which aimed at defending Albanian rights, but it was inactive in general. The Greek population of the region authorized a committee to present to European governments their wish for union with Greece; as a result Dimitrios Chasiotis published a memorandum in Paris in 1879.

According to the Ottoman censuses of 1881–1893, the city and its environs (the central &quot;kaza&quot; of the Sanjak of Ioannina), had a population comprising 4,759 Muslims, 77,258 Greek Orthodox (including both Greek and Albanian speakers), 3,334 Jews and 207 of foreign nationality. While a number of Turkish-language schools were established at the time, Greek-language education retained its prominent position. Even the city&#x27;s prominent Muslim families preferred to send their children to well-established Greek institutions, notably the &quot;Zosimaia&quot;. As a result, the dominance of the Greek language in the city continued: the minutes of the city council were kept in Greek, and the official newspaper, &quot;Vilayet&quot;, established in 1868, was bilingual in Turkish and Greek.

By 1908 an Albanian association was already active in Ioannina with the goal of removing the Albanian schools and churches of Ioaninna from the Greek&#x27;s Patriarchate sphere of influence.

During the Ottoman period (&quot;turcokracy&quot;) the religious-linguistic minority of &quot;Turco-yanniotes&quot; (Τουρκογιαννιώτες) existed in Ioannina and neighbouring areas. These were islamized &quot;Yaniotes&quot; (= people from Ioannina), who spoke Greek. There is a limited number of texts written with Greek alphabet in their idiom.

===Modern period (since 1913)===
Ioannina was incorporated into the Greek state on 21 February 1913 after the Battle of Bizani in the First Balkan War. The day the city came under the control of the Greek forces, aviator Christos Adamidis, a native of the city, landed his Maurice Farman MF.7 biplane in the Town Hall square, to the adulation of an enthusiastic crowd.

Following the Asia Minor Catastrophe (1922) and the Treaty of Lausanne, the Muslim population was exchanged with Greek refugees from Asia Minor. A small Muslim community of Albanian origin continued to live in Ioannina after the exchange, which in 1940 counted 20 families and had decreased to 8 individuals in 1973.

In 1940 during World War II the capture of the city became one of the major objectives of the Italian Army. Nevertheless, the Greek defense in Kalpaki pushed back the invading Italians. In April 1941 Ioannina was intensively bombed by the German forces even during the negotiations that led to the capitulation of the Greek army. During the subsequent Axis occupation of Greece, the city&#x27;s Jewish community was rounded up by the Germans in 1944 and mostly perished in the concentration camps. On 3 October 1943, the German army murdered in reprisal nearly 100 people in the village of Lingiades, 13 kilometres distant from Ioaninna, in what is known as the Lingiades massacre.

The University of Ioannina was founded in 1970; until then, higher education faculties in the city had been part of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

== Jewish community ==

According to the local Greek scholar Panayiotis Aravantinos, a synagogue destroyed in the 18th century bore an inscription which dated its foundation in the late 9th century AD. The existing synagogue was built in 1829 and is known as the Old Synagogue. It is located in the old fortified part of the city known as &quot;Kastro&quot;, at 16 Ioustinianou street. Its architecture is typical of the Ottoman era, a large building made of stone. The interior of the synagogue is laid out in the Romaniote way: the bimah (where the Torah scrolls are read out during service) is on a raised dais on the western wall, the Aron haKodesh (where the Torah scrolls are kept) is on the eastern wall and at the middle there is a wide interior aisle. The names of the Ioanniote Jews who were killed in the Holocaust are engraved in stone on the walls of the synagogue.

There was a Romaniote Jewish community living in Ioannina before World War II, in addition to a very small number of Sephardi. Many emigrated to New York, founding a congregation in 1906 and the Kehila Kedosha Janina synagogue in 1927.

According to Rae Dalven, 1,950 Jews were living in Ioannina in April 1941. Of these, 1,870 were deported by the Nazis to concentration camps on 25 March 1944, during the final months of German occupation. Almost all of the people deported were murdered on or shortly after 11 April 1944, when the train carrying them reached Auschwitz-Birkenau. Only 181 Ioannina Jews are known to have survived the war, including 112 who survived Auschwitz and 69 who fled to join the resistance leader Napoleon Zervas and the National Republican Greek League (EDES). Approximately 164 of these survivors eventually returned to Ioannina.

As of 2008, the remaining community has shrunk to about 50 mostly elderly people. The Kehila Kedosha Yashan Synagogue remains locked, only opened for visitors on request. Emigrant Romaniotes return every summer and open the old synagogue. The last time a Bar Mitzvah (the Jewish ritual for celebrating the coming of age of a child) was held in the synagogue was in 2000, and was an exceptional event for the community. A monument dedicated to the thousands of Greek Jews who perished during the Holocaust was constructed in the city in a 13th-century Jewish cemetery. In 2003 the memorial was vandalized by unknown anti-Semites. The Jewish cemetery too was repeatedly vandalized in 2009. As a response to the vandalisms, citizens of the city formed an initiative for the protection of the cemetery and organized rallies.

In the municipal election of 2019, independent candidate Moses Elisaf, a 65-year-old doctor, was elected mayor of the city, the first Jewish elected mayor in Greece. Elisaf won 50.3 percent of the vote. Elisaf received 17,789 votes, 235 more than his runoff opponent.

==Geography==

One of the most notable attractions of Ioannina is the inhabited island of Lake Pamvotis which is simply referred to as Island of Ioannina. The island is a short ferry trip from the mainland and can be reached on small motorboats running on varying frequencies depending on the season. The monastery of St Panteleimon, where Ali Pasha spent his last days waiting for a pardon from the Sultan, is now a museum housing everyday artefacts and relics of his period. There are six monasteries on the island: the monastery of St Nicholas (Ntiliou) or Strategopoulou (11th century), the Monastery of St Nicholas (Spanou) or Philanthropinon (1292), St John the Baptist (1506), Eleousis (1570), St Panteleimon (17th century), and of the Transfiguration of Christ (1851). The monasteries of Strategopoulou and Philanthropinon also functioned as colleges. Alexios Spanos, the monks Proklos and Comnenos, and the Apsarades brothers Theophanis and Nektarios are among those that taught there. The school continued its activities until 1758, when it was superseded by the newer collegial institutions within the city. The island&#x27;s winding streets are also home to many gift-shops, tavernas, churches and bakeries.

===Ioannina Castle===


At the south-eastern edge of the town on a rocky peninsula of Lake Pamvotis, the castle was the administrative heart of the Despotate of Epirus, and the Ottoman vilayet. The castle was in constant use until the late Ottoman period and the fortifications underwent several modifications throughout the centuries. The most extensive alterations where conducted during the rule of Ali Pasha and were completed in 1815. Several monuments such as the Byzantine baths, the Ottoman baths, the Ottoman library, and the Soufari Sarai are found within the castle&#x27;s walls. There are two citadels in the castle. The south-eastern citadel, which bears the name &quot;Its Kale&quot; (Ιτς Καλέ, from Turkish &quot;Iç Kale&quot;, &#x27;inner fortress&#x27;) is where the Fethiye Mosque, the tomb of Ali Pasha, and the Byzantine Museum are located. The north-eastern citadel is dominated by the Aslan Pasha Mosque and also contains a few other monuments dating from the Ottoman period. The old Jewish Synagogue of Ioannina is within the walls of the castle and is one of the oldest and largest buildings of its type surviving in Greece.

===The city===
Several religious and secular monuments survive from the Ottoman period. In addition to the two mosques surviving within the walls of the castle, two further mosques are preserved outside the walls. The Mosque and Madrassa of Veli Pasha are in the centre of the city, and Kaloutsiani Mosque can be found in the area of the city with the same name. The now derelict &quot;House of the Archbishop&quot;, near the football stadium, is the only old mansion that survived the fire of 1820. Some of the notable landmarks in the city centre also date from the late Ottoman period. The municipal clock tower of Ioannina, designed by local architect Periklis Meliritos, was erected in 1905 to celebrate the Jubilee of sultan Abdul Hamid II. The adjacent building houses the VIII Division headquarters. It dates from the late 19th century. Some neoclassical buildings such the post office, the old Zosimaia School, the Papazogleios Weaving School, and the former Commercial School date from the late Ottoman period as do a few arcades in the old commercial centre of the city like Stoa Louli and Stoa Liampei. The churches of the Assumption of the Virgin at Perivleptos, Saint Nicholas of Kopanon and Saint Marina were rebuilt in the 1850s by funds from Nikolaos Zosimas and his brothers on the foundations of previous churches that perished in the great fire of 1820. The Cathedral of St Athanasius was completed in 1933. It was built on the foundations of the previous Orthodox cathedral which was destroyed in the fires of 1820. It is a three-aisled basilica.

==Culture==


===Museums and galleries===

Some of the most important museums of the city are within the walls of the castle. The Municipal Ethnographic Museum is hosted in Aslan Pasha Mosque in the north-east citadel. It is divided into three departments, each one representing one of the main communities that inhabited the city: Greek, Muslim, and Jewish. The Byzantine Museum is in the south-eastern citadel of the castle. The museum opened in 1995 in order to preserve and present artefacts of the wider region of Epirus covering the period from the 4th to the 19th century. The newest addition to the city&#x27;s museum, the silversmithing museum, is also in the south-eastern citadel. It is housed in the western bastion of the citadel and outlines the history of the art of silversmithing in Epirus. 
Outside the walls of the castle, close to the town centre, one will find the Archaeological Museum of Ioannina. It is in the Litharitsia fortress area. It includes archaeological exhibits documenting the human habitation of Epirus from prehistoric times through the late Roman Period, with special emphasis placed on finds from the Dodona sanctuary. The Municipal Art Gallery of Ioannina (Dimotiki Pinakothiki) is housed in the Pyrsinella neoclassical building dating from around 1890. The gallery&#x27;s collection displays major modern works of painters and sculptors, collected through purchases and donations from various collectors and artists. This includes about 500 works, paintings, drawings, prints, pictures and sculptures. The Pavlos Vrellis Greek History Museum is south of the city. It is a wax museum which covers events and personalities from Greek history as well as the history of the region and is the result of the personal work of Pavlos Vrellis.

=== Exhibitions ===
A digital art exhibition, Plásmata II, was organised by the Onassis Cultural Center in the lakeside of Pamvotis, in the summer of 2023. More than 100,000 people visited the exhibition. It is a new entry for the city and future actions in every area with the help of Onassis Cultural Center.

<text>Preveza (, ) is a city in the region of Epirus, northwestern Greece, located on the northern peninsula of the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf. It is the capital of the regional unit of Preveza, which is the southern part of the region of Epirus. The Aktio-Preveza Immersed Tunnel –the first, and so far only, undersea tunnel in Greece– was completed in 2002. The 1,570 m (5,150 ft) long immersed tunnel connects Preveza in the north, to Aktio of western Acarnania to the south. The ruins of the ancient city of Nicopolis lie north of Preveza.

==Origin of the name==
Despite the fact that the name &quot;Preveza&quot; is attested in the &quot;Chronicle of the Morea&quot; (, , ), in the narratives referring to the suppression of the rebellious prince of the Despotate of Epirus, Nikephoros I, which occurred in 1290, this does not prove that the city existed in that period. The name is commonly regarded as deriving from the Slavic word , meaning &#x27;passage&#x27;, but transmitted via an Albanian form , &#x27;transportation, crossing&#x27;. These words correspond to the ancient Greek word &quot;pereosis&quot; (), which means &quot;passing across&quot;, pointing to it as a likely ultimate origin of the name.

An alternative derivation is that proposed in 1857 by Panagiotis Aravantinos as coming from the Italian word , which means &#x27;provision, supply&#x27;. Aravantinos&#x27; proposal has no solid foundations, according to recent academic views.

== Municipality of Preveza ==

The present form of the Municipality of Preveza was established in 2011, through the Reform Legislation for Local Government, which merged the following three former municipalities, which in turn became its Municipal Units. (The constituent communities are mentioned in brackets):
* Former Municipality of Louros (Ano Rachi, Kotsanopoulo, Louros, Neo Sfinoto, Oropos, Remmatia, Skiadas, Stefani, Trikastro, Vrysoula)
* Former Municipality of Preveza (Flamboura, Michalitsi, Mytikas, Nicopolis, Preveza)
* Former Municipality of Zalongo (Cheimadio, Eklissies, Kamarina, Kanali, Kryopigi, Myrsini, Nea Sampsounta, Nea Sinopi, Riza, Vrachos)

The municipality has an area of 380.541 km2, the municipal unit 66.835 km2.

==History==

===Antiquity===

In antiquity, the south-southwestern part of Epirus was inhabited by the Greek tribe of Cassopeans, part of a larger tribe, the Thesprotians. Their capital city was Cassope (today, near the village of Kamarina). At the southernmost part of Epirus, king Pyrrhus founded, in 290 BC, the town of Berenike or Berenice, named after his mother-in-law Berenice I of Egypt. Today, it is believed that Berenike lies on the hills near the village of Michalitsi, following the excavations by Sotirios Dakaris in 1965. The Ionian Sea, near Berenike, was the site of the naval Battle of Actium, on 2 September 31 BC, in which Octavian&#x27;s forces defeated those of Mark Antony and queen Cleopatra of Egypt. The city of Nicopolis (, &quot;Victory City&quot;) was built nearby by Augustus to commemorate his victory. The city is believed to have, at its peak, a population of 150,000. In AD 90, Epictetus arrived at Nicopolis, after he had been banished by the Roman emperor Domitian and established a school of philosophy. One of his students Arrian became a famous historian and recorded all of his works.

===Medieval period===

The name &quot;Preveza&quot; was first attested in the &quot;Chronicle of the Morea&quot; for the year 1292, when the Genoese allies of Byzantine emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos raided its port of Saint Nicholas. However, it likely dates to the abandonment of Nicopolis after the Uzes raids in Greece in the 1060s.

Preveza is not mentioned thereafter until the 15th century, indicating that it was likely abandoned or was of negligible importance. No medieval monuments survive, either. The modern city likely traces its sources to a foundation (or at least fortification) after the Ottoman conquest of the region, likely , followed by a second fortification in 1495. Therefore, it is most unlikely that Preveza constitutes the continuation of ancient Nicopolis, as earlier scholars have suggested.

===First Ottoman period===
The Ottomans refounded Preveza probably in 1477, with a subsequent strengthening of the fortifications in 1495. The naval Battle of Preveza was fought off the shores of Preveza on 29 September 1538, where the Ottoman fleet of Hayreddin Barbarossa defeated a united Christian fleet under the Genoese captain Andrea Doria. This day is a Turkish Navy National Holiday, and some of today&#x27;s Turkish submarines are called &quot;Preveze&quot;.

===Venetian intervention===


Preveza was hotly contested in several Ottoman-Venetian Wars. In September 1684, in the early phase of the Morean War, the Venetians, aided by Greek irregulars, crossed from the island of Lefkada (Santa Maura) and captured Preveza as well as Vonitsa, which gave them control of Acarnania – an important morale booster towards the main campaign in the Morea. However, at the end of the war in 1699 Preveza was handed back to Ottoman rule. Venice captured Preveza again in 1717, during its next war with the Ottomans and was this time able to hold on to the town and fort it – a meager achievement in a war which otherwise went very badly for the Republic. Venetian rule would persist until the very end of the Venetian Republic itself in 1797. During this period, in 1779, the Orthodox missionary Kosmas visited Preveza where it is said he founded a Greek school, which would be the only school of the city during the 18th century. At the end of the 18th century, Preveza became a transit center of trade with western Europe (particularly France), which resulted in the increase of its population to approximately 10,000–12,000.

===Year of French rule (1797–1798)===
Following the Treaty of Campo Formio, where Napoleon Bonaparte decreed the final dissolution of the Venetian Republic, Preveza – like other Venetian possessions in Greece and Albania – was ceded to Revolutionary France. 280 French grenadiers arrived in Preveza under the commands of General La Salchette. The people of Preveza welcomed the French troops, and formed a pro-French civic militia. Around this same time the poet Rigas Feraios was combining support for the ideas of the French Revolution with calls for a Greek uprising against Ottoman rule. He was intercepted and killed by the Ottoman authorities when en route to meet Napoleon and directly ask for his help for the Greek cause.

Napoleon Bonaparte, however, focused his attention in another direction, launching the French Campaign in Egypt and Syria, placing France at war with the Ottoman Empire and giving little thought to the fate of the small Preveza garrison exposed on the edge of Ottoman territory. In October 1798, the local Ottoman governor Ali Pasha Tepelena – having great ambitions to make himself a semi-independent ruler – attacked Preveza with an overwhelming force. In the Battle of Nicopolis on 12 October 1798 the troops of Ali Pasha and his son Mukhtar completely overwhelmed the French troops and their local allies. Over the next two days, 13–14 October 1798, a major massacre of the French troops and the local Greek population which defended the city took place in Preveza and Port Salaora, on the Ambracian Gulf, starting before Ali Pasha entered Preveza on 13 October but also continuing in his presence. On 14 October, Ali Pasha called on those citizens of Preveza who had escaped to the Acarnanian Mountains to return to the city, and declared that they would be in no danger. However, upon their return, 170 of them were executed by the sword at the Salaora Port Customs. Many prisoners who survived the massacre died from the hardships on the road to Ioannina. In the grand return and reception held for his victorious troops, which Ali Pasha organized at Ioannina, surviving French and rebel prisoners were given the unpleasant role of walking at the head of the procession, holding the cut and salted heads of their companions, under the shouts and jeers of Ioannina&#x27;s pro-Ottoman residents. From Ioannina, nine captured French grenadiers, and two officers were sent chained to Istanbul for questioning. One of them, Captain Louis-Auguste Camus de Richemont, was later released, possibly mediated by the mother of Napoleon Bonaparte, Maria Letizia Bonaparte, and eventually became a general. Some popularly circulating tales, of doubtful historical authenticity, link this incident with the origins of the Spoonmaker&#x27;s Diamond, one of the most closely guarded treasures of Istanbul&#x27;s Topkapı Palace.

Though Preveza would remain under Ottoman rule for more than a century, this event – both the short period of Greek militias active in the city and the shock of the massacre that followed – and the influence of the ideas of the French Revolution had a part in the development of Greek nationalism towards the Greek War of Independence, which broke out three decades later.

===Second Ottoman period===
From 1798 to 1820, Preveza was under the rule of the semi-independent Ali Pasha. Following his death in 1822 in Ioannina, Preveza was more directly controlled from Constantinople. Preveza became the seat of a province (the Sanjak of Preveze) in 1863, until the year 1912 when the city joined Greece. In 1835, educational activity in the city revived with the foundation of a new Greek school, the &quot;Theophaneios&quot;, named after its sponsor, Anastassios Theophanis. In the following decades, this school became a centre of education in the surrounding area and in 1851 it also hosted a female and a secondary school.

According to the Congress of Berlin in 1878, parts of southern Epirus, including Preveza, were to be ceded by the Ottoman Empire to the Kingdom of Greece. Under this context, five meetings were held in Preveza, between Greek and Ottoman representatives, but all of them failed to reach an agreement. Even before negotiations started, the Ottoman side used a number of Albanian national figures for delaying purposes and appointed Abedin bey Dino, member of the League of Prizren and representative of the Albanian national movement, as Ottoman foreign minister. Moreover, Abedin Dino managed to gather various Albanian personalities in Preveza, from all over Albania and Epirus, who believed that the Ottomans will provide full support to the Albanian movement and were against annexation of Epirus to Greece. They also organized a meeting there in January 1879 and on 28 February 1879, signed a petition with a threat to take arms to prevent an annexation of Preveza to Greece. As a result of the unrest created, led by Abdyl Frashëri, another Albanian national figure, the local Ottoman governor was recalled. Abedin Dino was also recalled from Preveza, while the recently arrived Albanians left the city and returned to their homelands.

The discussions between the two sides continued later in Constantinople, but the Ottoman side disagreed with the proposed border by using as an excuse the unrest created by Albanian representatives. In March 1881, the Ottoman side proposed the cession of Thessaly and Arta regions, a proposal that ignored the Albanian positions, and was finally accepted by Greece, although most of Epirus was still outside Greece. On the other hand, the Greek organisation, &quot;Epirote Society&quot;, founded in 1906 by members of the Epirote diaspora, Panagiotis Danglis and Spyros Spyromilios, aimed at the annexation of the region to Greece by supplying local Greeks with firearms.

From 1881 to 1912 the main sectors of the local economy witnessed dramatic decline and the port of the city lost most of its former commercial significance. However, education was still flourishing with two schools operating: one boys&#x27; and one girls&#x27; school. The school system of the city was primarily financed by Anastasios Theofanis, notable member of the diaspora.

===Balkan Wars===

The city of Preveza remained under Ottoman control until finally taken by the Greek Army on 21 October 1912, during the First Balkan War. The city was liberated after the Battle of Nicopolis, by the Greek forces under Colonel Panagiotis Spiliadis. A garrison of the 8th Infantry Division was stationed in the city by December. Later on in the same war, on 8 February 1913, the inhabitants of Preveza were involved in the first instance in world history of a pilot being shot down in combat. The Russian pilot , flying for the Greeks, had his biplane hit by ground fire following a bomb run on the walls of Fort Bizani near Ioannina. He came down near Preveza, and with the help of local townspeople repaired his plane and resumed his flight back to base. In the following months there arrived in Preveza the famous Swiss photographer Frederic Boissonnas, and a lot of photographs from this period are available today. Preveza along with the rest of southern Epirus formally became part of Greece via the Treaty of London in 1913.

After the Balkan Wars the harbor of Preveza became a significant regional commercial center in western Greece. Moreover, local labor unions were created during the Interwar period.

===Second World War===
Along with the rest of Greece, Preveza was occupied by Fascist Italy (1941–1943) and Nazi Germany (1943–1944) during World War II. Before the occupation, the Jewish community had 250 members. They were arrested and exterminated in the Nazi death camps, only 15 survived. After the departure of the Wehrmacht from Preveza, in September 1944, an episode of the Greek Civil War known as the Battle of Preveza took place, lasting for 16 days, between armed partisans of the right-wing EDES and the left-wing EAM-ELAS. The fights stopped after the Caserta Agreement between Great Britain and the two main Greek resistance groups, EDES and ELAS.

===Modern period===

Today Preveza is a commercial harbor and tourist hub, with a marina, four museums, two cinemas, an open theatre, a music Hall (OASIS), many clubs, taverns, and cafes, benefiting from its proximity to the nearby Aktion National Airport and the nearby island of Lefkada, a major tourist destination. There are in the city the university department of Financial (department of university of Ioannina) and Commercial Navy Academy. The Aktio-Preveza Immersed Tunnel, opened on 2002, is an important work of infrastructure for what has traditionally been a remote and underdeveloped region, and links Preveza to Actium (, &quot;Aktio&quot;) on the southern shore of the Ambracian Gulf, greatly shortening the distance of the trip to Lefkada.

In July 2022, Preveza was affected by the large wildfires.

Preveza is linked by road to Igoumenitsa and other coastal settlements through the E55 national road, and is also linked with other cities in Epirus such as Ioannina and Arta. The Aktio-Preveza Undersea Tunnel links Preveza by road to Aetolia-Acarnania in Central Greece. Preveza also has a small commercial and passenger port and is served by the nearby Aktion National Airport, which also serves the island of Lefkada.

===Twin towns – sister cities===
Preveza is a founding member of the Douzelage, a unique town twinning association of 24 towns across the European Union. This active town twinning began in 1991 and there are regular events, such as a produce market from each of the other countries and festivals. Discussions regarding membership are also in hand with three further towns (Agros in Cyprus, Škofja Loka in Slovenia and Tryavna in Bulgaria).

<text>The Ionian Islands (Modern Greek: , ; Ancient Greek, Katharevousa: , ) are a group of islands in the Ionian Sea, west of mainland Greece. They are traditionally called the Heptanese (&quot;Seven Islands&quot;; , &quot;Heptanēsa&quot; or , &quot;Heptanēsos&quot;; ), but the group includes many smaller islands in addition to the seven principal ones.

As a distinct historic region, they date to the centuries-long Venetian rule, which preserved them from the Muslim conquests of the Ottoman Empire, and created a distinct cultural identity with many Italian influences. The Ionian Islands became part of the modern Greek state in 1864. Administratively today, they belong to the Ionian Islands Region except for Kythera, which belongs to the Attica Region.

==Geography==
The seven primary islands are, from north to south:

*Kerkyra (Κέρκυρα) usually known as Corfu in English and &quot;Corfù&quot; in Italian
*Paxi (Παξοί) also known as Paxos in English
*Lefkada (Λευκάδα) also known as Lefkas in English
*Ithaki (Ιθάκη) usually known as Ithaca in English
*Kefalonia (Κεφαλονιά) often known as Cefalonia, Cephalonia and Kefallinia in English
*Zakynthos (Ζάκυνθος) sometimes known as Zante in English and Italian
*Kythira (Κύθηρα) usually known as Cythera in English and sometimes known as Cerigo in English and Italian

The six northern islands are off the west coast of Greece, in the Ionian Sea. The seventh island, Kythira, is off the southern tip of the Peloponnese, the southern part of the Greek mainland. Kythira is not part of the region of the Ionian Islands, as it is included in the region of Attica.

==Etymology==

In Ancient Greek, the adjective &quot;Ionios&quot; () was used as an epithet for the sea between Epirus and Italy in which the Ionian Islands are found, because, according to myth, Io swam across it. Although they have the same Latin transliteration and Modern Greek pronunciation, the Ionian Sea and Islands are not related to Ionia, an Anatolian region; in Greek, the Ionian Sea and Ionian Islands are spelled with an omicron (Ιόνια), whereas Ionia has an omega (Ιωνία), reflecting a classical difference in pronunciation. The two words are still distinguished by stress: the western &quot;Ionia&quot; is accented on the antepenult (), and the eastern on the penult (). In English, the adjective relating to Ionia is &quot;&quot;, not &quot;Ionian&quot;.

The islands themselves are known by a variety of names. During the centuries of rule by Venice, they acquired Venetian names, by which some of them are still known in English (and in Italian). Kerkyra was known as Corfù, Ithaki as Val di Compare, Kythera as Cerigo, Lefkada as Santa Maura and Zakynthos as Zante.

A variety of spellings are used for the Greek names of the islands, particularly in historical writing. Kefallonia is often spelled as Cephallenia or Cephalonia, Ithaki as Ithaca, Kerkyra as Corcyra, Kythera as Cythera, Lefkada as Leucas or Leucada and Zakynthos as Zacynthus. Older or variant Greek forms are sometimes also used: Kefallinia for Kefallonia and Paxos or Paxoi for Paxi.

==History==
The islands were settled by Greeks at an early date, possibly as early as 1200 BC, and certainly by the 9th century BC. The early Eretrian settlement at Kerkyra was displaced by colonists from Corinth in 734 BC. The islands were mostly a backwater during Ancient Greek times and played little part in Greek politics. The one exception was the conflict between Kerkyra and its mother-city Corinth in 434 BC, which brought intervention from Athens and triggered the Peloponnesian War.

Ithaca was the name of the island home of Odysseus in the epic Ancient Greek poem the &quot;Odyssey&quot; by Homer. Attempts have been made to identify Ithaki with ancient Ithaca, but the geography of the real island cannot be made to fit Homer&#x27;s description. Archeological investigations have revealed findings in both Kefalonia and Ithaca.

===Roman and Byzantine rule===

By the 4th century BC, most of the islands were absorbed into the empire of Macedon. Some remained under the control of the Macedonian Kingdom until 146 BC, when the Greek peninsula was gradually annexed by Rome. After 400 years of peaceful rule, the islands continued under the control of the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire after the fall of the Western Roman Empire.

Under Byzantine rule, from the mid-8th century, they formed the theme of Cephallenia. The islands were a frequent target of Saracen raids and from the late 11th century, saw a number of Norman and Italian attacks. Most of the islands fell to William II of Sicily in 1185. Corfu and Lefkas remained under Byzantine control.

Kefallonia and Zakynthos became the County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos until 1357, when this entity was merged with Lefkada and Ithaki to become the Duchy of Leucadia under French and Italian dukes. Corfu, Paxi and Kythera were taken by the Venetians in 1204, after the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire by the Fourth Crusade. These became important overseas colonies of the Republic and were used as way-stations for their maritime trade with the Levant.

===Venetian rule===

From 1204, the Republic of Venice controlled Corfu and slowly all the Ionian islands fell under Venetian rule. In the 15th century, the Ottomans conquered most of Greece, but their attempts to conquer the islands were largely unsuccessful. Zakynthos passed permanently to Venice in 1482, Kefalonia and Ithaki in 1483, Lefkada in 1502. Kythera had been in Venetian hands since 1238.

The islands became the only part of the Greek-speaking world to escape Ottoman rule. During this time, large numbers of Greeks moved to the Ionian islands to escape Ottoman persecution. Smaller numbers of Albanian, Aromanian and Slavic-speaking Christians also fled to the islands, though they quickly assimilated into the Greek majority.

Venetian was the official language of the islands during this period, and many Greeks adopted the Venetian language for social advancement. This was bolstered by the arrival of thousands of settlers from other parts of the Venetian Republic, forming the basis of the Corfiot Italian community. The majority of the island, however, remained ethnically, linguistically and religiously Greek. Many Corfiot Italians later Hellenised, adopting the Greek language and religion, such as Ioannis Kapodistrias.

In the 18th century, a Greek national independence movement began to emerge, and the free status of the Ionian islands made them the natural base for exiled Greek intellectuals, freedom fighters and foreign sympathisers. The islands became more self-consciously Greek as the 19th century, the century of romantic nationalism, neared.

===Napoleonic era===


In 1797 the French general Napoléon Bonaparte conquered Venice. By the Treaty of Campo Formio of October 1797 the islanders found themselves under French rule, which organised the islands as the départements &quot;Mer-Égée&quot;, &quot;Ithaque&quot; and &quot;Corcyre&quot;. In 1798–1799 a Russian-Ottoman fleet under the command of the Russian Admiral Ushakov evicted the French; the victors established the Septinsular Republic of 1800–1807 under joint Russo-Ottoman protection—the first time Greeks had had even limited self-government since the fall of Constantinople in 1453.
In 1807 the Treaty of Tilsit between France and Russia ceded the Ionian Islands to the French again, and the French Empire took possession.

===British rule===

In 1809, the British Royal Navy defeated the French fleet in Zakynthos (October 2, 1809) captured Kefallonia, Kythera and Zakynthos, and took Lefkada in 1810. The French held out in Corfu until 1814. The Treaty of Paris in 1815 turned the islands into the &quot;United States of the Ionian Islands&quot; under British protection (November 5, 1815). In January 1817, the British granted the islands a new constitution. The islanders elected an Assembly of 40 members, who advised the British High Commissioner. The British greatly improved the islands&#x27; communications, and introduced modern education and justice systems. The islanders welcomed most of these reforms, and took up afternoon tea, cricket and other English pastimes. The British also brought thousands of Maltese to the Ionian Islands to work as builders and artisans, forming the basis of the Corfiot Maltese community.

Once Greek independence was established after 1830, however, the islanders began to press for &quot;Enosis&quot; – union with Greece. The British statesman William Ewart Gladstone toured the islands and recommended that having already Malta, giving the islands to Greece would not hurt the interest of the British Empire. The British government resisted, since like the Venetians they found the islands made useful naval bases. They also regarded the Bavarian-born king of Greece, King Otto, as unfriendly to Britain. However, in 1862, Otto was deposed in a coup by the Great National Assembly and a new king, George I from Denmark, was elected in his place.

===Union with Greece===
In 1862, Britain decided to transfer the islands to Greece, as a gesture of support intended to bolster the new King&#x27;s popularity (probably as a counterbalance to the newly established Italian state).

On May 2, 1864, the British departed and the islands became three provinces of the Kingdom of Greece, though Britain retained the use of the port of Corfu. On 21 May 1864 the Ionian Islands officially reunited with Greece. Prince Philippos of Greece and Denmark was born in Corfu in 1921 and grew up to become Britain&#x27;s Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. In 1923, following orders by Mussolini, the Italians temporarily occupied Corfu.

===World War II===
In 1941, when Axis forces occupied Greece, the Ionian Islands (except Kythera) were handed over to the Italians. Long a target of Italian expansionism, the Greek civil authorities were replaced by Italians in preparation for a post-war annexation.

In 1943, the Germans replaced the Italians, and deported the centuries-old Jewish community of Corfu to their deaths. By 1944, most of the islands were under the control of the EAM/ELAS resistance movement, and they have remained in general a stronghold of left-wing sentiment ever since.

===1953 earthquake===

The 1953 Ionian islands earthquake occurred with a surface wave magnitude of 7.2 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X (&quot;Extreme&quot;) on August 12, 1953. Building damage was extensive and the southern islands of Kefalonia and Zakynthos were practically levelled. The islands were reconstructed from the ground up over the following years under a strict building code. The code has proven extremely effective, as many earthquakes since that time have caused no damage to new buildings.

===Today===

Today, all the islands are part of the Greek region of the Ionian Islands (&quot;Ionioi Nisoi&quot;), except Kythera, which is part of the region of Attica. Kerkyra has a population of 103,300 (including Paxoi), Zakynthos 40,650, Kefallonia 39,579 (including Ithaca), Lefkada 22,536, Ithaki 3,052, Kythera 3,000 and Paxi 2,438.

In recent decades, the islands have lost much of their population through emigration and the decline of their traditional industries, fishing and marginal agriculture. Today, their major industry is tourism. Specifically Kerkyra, with its harbour, scenery and wealth of ruins and castles, is a favourite stopping place for cruise liners. British tourists in particular are attracted through having read Gerald Durrell&#x27;s evocative book &quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot; (1956), which describes his childhood on Kerkyra in the 1930s. The novel and movie &quot;Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot; are set in Kefalonia, in which Captain Corelli is part of the Italian occupation force during the Second World War.

==Demographics==
The Ionian Islands&#x27; official population, excluding Kythera, in 2011 was 207,855, decreased by 1.50% compared to the population in 2001. Nevertheless, the region remains the third by population density with 90.1/km2 nationwide, well above the national of 81.96/km2. The most populous of the major islands is Corfu with a population of 104,371, followed by Zakynthos (40,759), Kefalonia (35,801), Lefkada (23,693) and Ithaca (3,231). The foreign-born population was in 2001 19,360 or 9.3%, the majority of which was concentrated in Corfu and Zakynthos. Most of them originate from Albania (13,536). The fertility rate for 2011 according to Eurostat was 1.35 live births per woman during her lifetime.

==Culture==
== Economy ==
The regional gross domestic product for 2010 was 4,029 million euros. The GDP per capita for the same year was 18,440 euros per capita which was lower than the national median of 20,481. However, the GDP per capita of Kefalonia and Zante, 23,275 and 24,616 respectively, was much higher than the national figure. Additionally, unemployment for 2012 was 14.7, the lowest among all Greek regions, and much lower compared to the national unemployment of 24.2.

===Tourism===
The region is a popular tourist destination. The airports of Corfu, Zante and Kefalonia were in the top ten in Greece by number of international arrivals, with 1,386,289 international arrivals for 2012, with Corfu being the sixth airport by number of arrivals nationwide. While Kefalonia Airport had the biggest increase nationwide by 13.11% compared to 2011, while Corfu had an increase of 6.31%.

<text>The Dodecanese (, ; , &quot;Dodekánisa&quot; , ; ) are a group of 15 larger and 150 smaller Greek islands in the southeastern Aegean Sea and Eastern Mediterranean, off the coast of Turkey&#x27;s Anatolia, of which 26 are inhabited. This island group generally defines the eastern limit of the Sea of Crete. They belong to the wider Southern Sporades island group.

Rhodes has been the area&#x27;s dominant island since antiquity. Of the others, Kos and Patmos are historically the most important; the remaining 12 are Agathonisi, Astypalaia, Halki, Kalymnos, Karpathos, Kasos, Leipsoi, Leros, Nisyros, Symi, Tilos, and Kastellorizo. Other islands in the chain include Alimia, Arkoi, Farmakonisi, Gyali, Kinaros, Levitha, Marathos, Nimos, Pserimos, Saria, Strongyli and Syrna.

==Name==
The name &quot;Dodecanese&quot; (older form ἡ Δωδεκάνησος, &quot;hē Dōdekanēsos&quot;; modern τα Δωδεκάνησα, &quot;ta Dōdekanēsa&quot;), meaning &quot;The Twelve Islands&quot;, or &quot;Oniki Adalar&quot; in Turkish, denotes today an island group in the southeastern Aegean Sea, comprising 15 major islands (Agathonisi, Astypalaia, Chalki, Kalymnos, Karpathos, Kasos, Kastellorizo, Kos, Lipsi, Leros, Nisyros, Patmos, Rhodes, Symi, and Tilos) and 93 smaller islets. Since Antiquity, these islands formed part of the group known as the &quot;Southern Sporades&quot; (Νότιες Σποράδες).

The name &quot;Dōdekanēsos&quot; first appears in Byzantine sources in the 8th century, as a naval command under a &quot;droungarios&quot;, encompassing the southern Aegean Sea, which eventually evolved into the Theme of Samos. It was not applied to the current island group, but to the 12 Cyclades islands clustered around Delos. The name may indeed be of a far earlier date, and modern historians suggest that the 12 islands Strabo mentions (&quot;Geographica&quot; Χ.485) were the origin of the term. The term remained in use throughout the medieval period and was still used for the Cyclades in both colloquial usage and scholarly Greek-language literature until the 18th century.
The transfer of the name to the present-day Dodecanese has its roots in the Ottoman period. Upon the Ottoman conquest in 1522, the two larger islands, Rhodes and Kos, came under direct Ottoman rule, while the others, of which the 12 main islands were usually named, enjoyed extensive privileges pertaining to taxation and self-government. Concerted attempts to abolish these privileges were made after 1869, as the Ottoman Empire attempted to modernize and centralize its administrative structure, and the last vestiges of the old privileges were finally abolished after the Young Turks took power in 1908. It was at that time that the press in the independent Kingdom of Greece began referring to the 12 privileged islands (Astypalaia, Chalki, Ikaria, Kalymnos, Karpathos, Kasos, Kastellorizo, Leros, Nisyros, Patmos, Symi and Tilos), in the context of their attempts to preserve their privileges, collectively as the &quot;Dodecanese&quot;. Shortly afterward, in 1912, most of the Southern Sporades were captured by the Italians in the Italo-Turkish War, except for Ikaria, which joined Greece in 1912 during the First Balkan War, and Kastellorizo, which came under Italian rule only in 1921. The place of the latter two was taken by Kos and Rhodes, bringing the number of the major islands under Italian rule back to 12. Thus, when the Greek press began agitating for the cession of the islands to Greece in 1913, the term used was still the &quot;Dodecanese&quot;. The Italian occupation authorities helped establish the term when they named the islands under their control &quot;Rhodes and the Dodecanese&quot; (&quot;Rodi e Dodecaneso&quot;), adding Leipsoi to the list of the major islands to make up for considering Rhodes separately.

By 1920, the name had become firmly established for the entire island group, as acknowledged by the Italian government when it appointed the islands&#x27; first civilian governor, Count , as &quot;Viceroy of the Dodecanese&quot;. As the name was associated with Greek irredentism, from 1924 Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist regime tried to abolish its use by calling them the &quot;Italian Islands of the Aegean&quot;, but this name never acquired any currency outside Italian administrative usage. The islands joined Greece in 1947 following as the &quot;Governorate-General of the Dodecanese&quot; (Γενική Διοίκησις Δωδεκανήσου), since 1955 the &quot;Dodecanese Prefecture&quot; (Νομός Δωδεκανήσου).

==Geography==
The Dodecanese are in the South East Aegean sea and are bordered by Turkey in the East, Crete in the southwest and the Cyclades in the west.

===Climate===
Most of the Dodecanese have a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot; in the Köppen climate classification) while Karpathos, Kasos and Nisyros have a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSh&quot;) with mild winters and hot summers. Rhodes Port, Kasos, Karpathos and Kastellorizo record among the mildest winters in Europe. South East Rhodes experiences a significantly warmer climate with Lindos registering a mean annual temperature of around , making it the warmest area in Greece. Moreover, according to the Hellenic National Meteorological Service, South East Rhodes records the highest mean annual sunshine in Greece with over 3,100 hours.





==History==
===Pre-history and the Archaic period===
The Dodecanese have been inhabited since prehistoric times. In the Neopalatial period on Crete, the islands were heavily Minoanized (contact beginning in the second millennium BC). Following the downfall of the Minoans, the islands were ruled by the Mycenaean Greeks from circa 1400 BC, until the arrival of the Dorians circa 1100 BC. It is in the Dorian period that they began to prosper as an independent entity, developing a thriving economy and culture through the following centuries. By the early Archaic period Rhodes and Kos emerged as the major islands in the group, and in the 6th century BC the Dorians founded three major cities on Rhodes (Lindos, Kameiros and Ialyssos). Together with the island of Kos and the cities of Knidos and Halicarnassos on the mainland of Asia Minor, these made up the Dorian Hexapolis.

===Classical period===

This development was interrupted around 499 BC by the Persian Wars, during which the islands were captured by the Persians for a brief period. After the Athenians defeated the Persians in 478 BC, the cities joined the Athenian-dominated Delian League. When the Peloponnesian War broke out in 431 BC, they remained largely neutral, though they were still members of the League.

By the time the Peloponnesian War ended in 404 BC, the Dodecanese were mostly removed from the larger Aegean conflicts, and had begun a period of relative quiet and prosperity. In 408 BC, the three cities of Rhodes had united to form one state, which built a new capital on the northern end of the island, also named &quot;Rhodes&quot;; this united Rhodes dominated the region for the coming millennia. Other islands in the Dodecanese also developed into significant economic and cultural centers; most notably, Kos served as the site of the school of medicine founded by Hippocrates.

The Peloponnesian War had so weakened the entire Greek civilization&#x27;s military strength that it lay open to invasion. In 357 BC, the islands were conquered by King Mausolus of Caria, then in 340 BC by the Persians. But this second period of Persian rule proved nearly as short as the first, and the islands became part of the rapidly growing Macedonian Empire as Alexander the Great swept through and defeated the Persians in 332 BC, to the great relief of the islands&#x27; inhabitants.

After Alexander&#x27;s death, the islands, and even Rhodes itself, were split up among the many generals who contended to succeed him. The islands formed strong commercial ties with the Ptolemies in Egypt, and together they formed the Rhodo-Egyptian alliance, which controlled trade throughout the Aegean in the 3rd century BC. Led by Rhodes, the islands developed into maritime, commercial and cultural centers: coins of Rhodes circulated almost everywhere in the Mediterranean, and the islands&#x27; schools of philosophy, literature and rhetoric were famous. The Colossus of Rhodes, built in 304 BC, perhaps best symbolized their wealth and power.

In 164 BC, Rhodes signed a treaty with Rome, and the islands became aligned to greater or lesser extent with the Roman Republic while mostly maintaining their autonomy. Rhodes quickly became a major schooling center for Roman noble families, and, as the islands (and particularly Rhodes) were important allies of Rome, they enjoyed numerous privileges and generally friendly relations. These were eventually lost in 42 BC, in the turmoil following the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC, after which Cassius invaded and sacked the islands. Thereafter, they became part of the Roman Empire proper. Titus made Rhodes capital of the &quot;Provincia Insularum&quot;, and eventually the islands were joined with Crete as part of the 18th Province of the Roman Empire.

In the 1st century, Saint Paul visited the islands twice, and Saint John visited numerous times; they succeeded in converting the islands to Christianity, placing them among the first dominantly Christian regions. Saint John eventually came to reside among them, being exiled to Patmos, where he wrote his famous &quot;Revelation&quot;.

===Middle Ages===


As the Roman Empire split in AD 395 into Eastern and Western halves, the islands became part of the Eastern part, which later evolved into the Byzantine Empire. They would remain there for nearly a thousand years, though these were punctuated by numerous invasions. It was during this period that they began to reemerge as an independent entity, and the term &quot;Dodecanese&quot; itself dates to around the 8th century. Copious evidence of the Eastern Roman period remains on the islands today, most notably in hundreds of churches from the period in various states of preservation.

In the 10th and 11th centuries, on behalf the Roman Empire of Constantinople, the area was controlled and secured with trade duty rights by powerful maritime city-state fleets of Genoa (with the clan of Vignolo de&#x27;Vignoli) and Venice (with the clan of Cornaros); When the Genoese snatched a treaty from the Paleologos Emperors of Constantinople, they began invading portions of the Dodecanese and other eastern isles from Chios to Rhodes that had remained under the nominal power of the Empire of Nicea; Genoese family clans (Moresco, Vignoli, Giustiniani, Spinola and others) each held some islands and were granted rights to rule, trade and to exploit raw materials (&quot;masticha&quot;, etc.), in exchange for maritime protection, while Orthodox monks ruled on Patmos and Leros. The Byzantine era came to an end when the islands were rented and sold by Genoeses for the venue of the Knights Hospitaller (Knights of St John): Rhodes was reinforced in 1309, and in the rest of the islands the Knights gradually built castles and fortress over the next few decades, while the Genoese fleet remained in charge of the sea routes and kept its bases and trading stores (&quot;Empori&quot;). The Knights made Rhodes their stronghold, transforming its capital into a grandiose medieval city dominated by an impressive fortress, with scattered other fortresses and citadels throughout the rest of the islands.

These massive fortifications proved sufficient to repel invasions by the Sultan of Egypt in 1444 and Mehmed II in 1480. Finally, the citadel at Rhodes fell to the army of Suleiman the Magnificent in 1522, and the other islands were overrun within the year. The few remaining Knights fled to Malta.

===Ottoman rule===

Thus began a period of several hundred years in the Ottoman Empire. The Dodecanese formed a separate province within the Eyalet of the Archipelago. The population was allowed to retain a number of privileges provided it submitted to Ottoman rule. By Suleiman&#x27;s edict, they paid a special tax in return for a special autonomous status that prohibited Ottoman generals from interfering in their civil affairs or mistreating the population. These guarantees, combined with a strategic location at the crossroads of Mediterranean shipping, allowed the islands to prosper. The overwhelmingly Greek population (only Rhodes and Kos had Turkish communities) leaned heavily toward Greece following its declaration of independence in 1822, and many of the islanders joined the Greek War of Independence, with the result that the northern portion of the Dodecanese (including Samos) became briefly the Greek provinces of the Eastern Sporades and Southern Sporades. Kasos in particular played a prominent role due to its skilled mariners, until its destruction by the Egyptians in 1824. Most of the islands were slated to become part of the new Greek state in the London Protocol of 1828, but when Greek independence was recognized in the London Protocol of 1830, the islands were left outside the new Kingdom of Greece. The 19th century turned out to be one of the islands&#x27; most prosperous, and a number of mansions date from this era.

====Turks of the Dodecanese====

A Turkish Muslim minority lives in Rhodes and Kos. Sources have variously estimated the Turkish population of Kos and Rhodes to be 5,000, 6,000, or 7,000.

===Italian rule===

After the outbreak of the Italian-Turkish war over Libya in early 1912, Italy, in order to apply pressure on the Ottoman government closer to its metropolitan territories, occupied all the present-day Dodecanese except for Kastellorizo.

After the end of the war according to the Treaty of Ouchy, Italy maintained the occupation of the islands as guarantee for the execution of the treaty. The occupation continued after Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire (21 August 1915) during World War I.

During the war, the islands became an important naval base for Britain and France; Italy was allied with both nations. The Dodecanese were used as a staging area for numerous campaigns, most famously the one at Gallipoli. The French and British occupied some of the smaller islands, but Rhodes remained under Italian occupation. In 1915, the French also occupied Kastellorizo.

After the war, the Tittoni–Venizelos agreement, signed on 29 July 1919, called for the smaller islands to join with Greece while Italy maintained control of Rhodes. The treaty further outlined an exchange where Italy would receive Antalya for southwest Anatolia. The Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War and the foundation of modern Turkey prevented the exchange. Italy formally annexed the Dodecanese as the &quot;Possedimenti Italiani dell&#x27;Egeo&quot; under the terms of the Treaty of Lausanne. Mussolini embarked on a program of Italianization, hoping to make Rhodes a modern transportation hub that would serve as a focal point for the spread of Italian culture in the Levant. The islands were overwhelmingly Greek-speaking, with a Turkish-speaking minority and a smaller Ladino-speaking Jewish minority. Immigrant Italian speakers were a marginal language community.

Although the Italian state placed the islands under the direction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, their governance was strongly tied to the project for an Italian empire in the Mediterranean and to the Italian colonies in Libya, Somalia, Eritrea, and after 1936, in Ethiopia.

As part of securing sovereignty in the islands, Italy created and applied a form of imperial citizenship for the local population unique to its overseas empire. Called Italian Aegean citizenship (cittadinanza egea italiana), this form of citizenship was inclusive of local political rights and exclusive of military service. After 1934, Dodecanese citizens could complete military service and apply to become full Italian citizens, an option many locals chose while supporting Italian Fascism and seeing the Italian empire as promoting their financial well-being. Italian Aegean citizenship also ensured the islands were exempted from the exchange of Greek and Turkish minority populations in the Aegean, a provision of the Second Lausanne Treaty that ended the Greco-Turkish War. After 1934, it was also possible to acquire Italian Aegean citizenship from abroad and to transmit Italian Aegean citizenship on the principle of patrilineal descent. This reform mirrored the principle of jus sanguinis which provides the basis of Italian citizenship and was especially intended for the large Greek-speaking Dodecanese-origin emigrant community in Egypt.

The Fascist administration sought to modernize the islands, eradicating malaria, constructing hospitals, aqueducts, a power plant to provide Rhodes&#x27; capital with electric lighting, and establishing the Dodecanese cadastre. The main castle of the Knights of St. John was also rebuilt. The concrete-dominated Fascist architectural style detracted significantly from the islands&#x27; picturesque scenery (and also reminded the inhabitants of Italian rule), and has consequently been largely demolished or remodeled, apart from the famous example of the Leros town of Lakki, which remains a prime example of the architecture.

From 1936 to 1940 Cesare Maria De Vecchi acted as governor of the Italian Islands of the Aegean promoting the official use of the Italian language and favoring a process of Italianization, interrupted by the beginning of World War II. In the 1936 Italian census of the Dodecanese islands, the total population was 129,135, of whom 7,015 were Italians.

===World War II===

During World War II, Italy joined the Axis Powers, which used the Dodecanese as a naval staging area for their invasion of Crete in 1941. After Italy surrendered in September 1943, the islands briefly became a battleground between the Germans and Allied forces, including the Italians. The Germans prevailed in the Dodecanese Campaign, and although they were driven out of mainland Greece in 1944, the Dodecanese remained occupied until the end of the war in 1945, during which time nearly the entire Jewish population of 6,000 was deported and killed. Only 1,200 of these Ladino-speaking Jews survived by escaping to the nearby coast of Turkey. On 8 May 1945 the German garrison commander Otto Wagener surrendered the islands to the British on Rhodes, handing over 5,000 German and 600 Italian military personnel.

===Post-World War II===
After the war, the islands became a British military protectorate and were almost immediately allowed to run their own civil affairs, whereupon they became informally united with Greece, though under separate sovereignty and military control. Despite objections from Turkey, which desired the islands as well, they were formally united with Greece by the 1947 Peace Treaty with Italy.

As a legacy of its former status as a jurisdiction separate from Greece, it is still considered a separate &quot;entity&quot; for amateur radio purposes, essentially maintaining its status as an independent country &quot;on the air.&quot; Amateur radio call signs in the Dodecanese begin with the prefix SV5 instead of SV for Greece.

The 70th anniversary of the Dodecanese enosis was marked in 2017, with the Greek Parliament holding a special celebratory session for the event.

Today, Rhodes and the Dodecanese are popular travel destinations.

==Administration==

The Dodecanese Prefecture was one of the prefectures of Greece. As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis reform, the prefecture was abolished, and its territory was divided into four regional units, within the South Aegean administrative region:
* Kalymnos
* Karpathos-Kasos
* Kos
* Rhodes

===Municipalities and communities===
The prefecture was subdivided into the following municipalities and communities. These have been reorganised at the 2011 Kallikratis reform as well.

===Provinces===
Until 1997, the Prefecture of the Dodecanese was subdivided into provinces:
* Province of Patmos – Patmos
* Province of Kalymnos – Kalymnos
* Province of Kos – Kos
* Province of Rhodes – Rhodes City
* Province of Karpathos &amp; Kasos – Karpathos

==Cuisine==

Local specialities of the Dodecanese include:

* &quot;Avranies&quot;
* &quot;Koulouria&quot; (Κουλουρία)
* &quot;Pitaroudia&quot;
* &quot;Pouggia&quot; (Πουγγιά)

<text>Trikala () is a city in northwestern Thessaly, Greece, and the capital of the Trikala regional unit. The city straddles the Lithaios river, which is a tributary of Pineios. According to the Greek National Statistical Service, Trikala is populated by 81,355 inhabitants (2011), while in total the Trikala regional unit is populated by 131,085 inhabitants (2011).

Trikala is a lively Greek city with picturesque monuments and old neighborhoods with traditional architecture. The city is near Meteora and also near the mountain range of south Pindus, where there are many destinations (i.e. Pyli&#x27;s stone bridge, Elati, Pertouli, Palaiokarya&#x27;s stone bridge and waterfall, Pertouli Ski Center etc.).

==Name==
The city&#x27;s name derives from the ancient &quot;Trikka&quot; or &quot;Trikke&quot; ( or ), which was itself named after a nymph that was a daughter of Peneus or Asopos. The name &quot;Trikala&quot; appears in the Byzantine period. In Turkish, the city is known as . In Aromanian it is known as .

==History==

===Antiquity===

The region of Trikala has been inhabited since prehistoric times. The first indications of permanent settlement have been uncovered in the cave of Theopetra, and date back to approx. 49,000 BC. Neolithic settlements dating back to 6,000 BC have been uncovered in Megalo Kefalovriso and other locations.

The city of Trikala is built on the ancient city of Trikka or Trikke, which was founded around the 3rd millennium BC and took its name from the nymph Trikke, daughter of Peneus, or according to others, daughter of the river god Asopus. The ancient city was built at a defensive location in between the local hill and the river Lithaios. The city became an important center in antiquity and it was considered to be the birthplace and main residence of the healing god Asclepius. The city exhibited one of the most important and ancient of Asclepius&#x27; healing temples, called &quot;asclepieia&quot;. The city is mentioned in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; as having participated in the Trojan War with thirty ships under Asclepius&#x27; sons Machaon and Podalirius. In the Mycenean period, the city was the capital of a kingdom, and later it constituted the main center of the Thessalian region of Estaiotis, which occupied roughly the territory of the modern Trikala Prefecture.

In historical times, the city of Trikke and the surrounding area experienced prosperity. It fell to the Achaemenid Persians in 480 BC, while ten years later it joined the Thessalian monetary union. In 352 BC it was united with the Macedonia of Philip II. The city became a location of hard battles between Macedonia and Rome. While Philip V of Macedon and his son Perseus tried to keep the city, after 168 BC it fell to the Roman Republic.

=== Middle Ages ===

While the area was considered to be firmly under the rule of the Byzantine Empire, it was invaded nevertheless by a succession of raiders and nomadic tribes. Some of these tribes that raided the area include: Goths (396), Huns (447), Slavs (577), Bulgarians (986–1000), Normans (1082/3), Catalans (1309–1311).

The current name of Trikala first appears in the 11th-century &quot;Strategikon of Kekaumenos&quot;, where &quot;Trikalitan Vlachs&quot; are mentioned, and then in the early 12th-century &quot;Alexiad&quot; of Anna Komnene. Later in the century, the Arab traveller and geographer al-Idrisi recorded the town as &quot;an important agrarian center with abundant vineyards and gardens&quot; (T.E. Gregory).

After the dissolution of the Byzantine state by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, Trikala does not appear to have fallen into Frankish hands, but became part of the Despotate of Epirus. Epirote rule lasted until 1259, when the town was taken without resistance by the Empire of Nicaea (after 1261 the renewed Byzantine Empire) following the Battle of Pelagonia. In the early 14th century the town was the capital of a semi-independent domain under the &quot;sebastokrator&quot; Stephen Gabrielopoulos, which extended across much of western Thessaly and Macedonia. After his death in 1332/3 the city, along with most of Gabrielopoulos&#x27; lands, was seized by the Epirote ruler John II Orsini, but he was in turn expelled and the area incorporated into the Byzantine Empire by Andronikos III Palaiologos.

In 1348, Thessaly was conquered by Stephen Dushan and incorporated into the newly established Serbian Empire. The Serbian general Preljub was made the region&#x27;s governor, and established himself at Trikala. In 1359, Dushan&#x27;s half-brother Symeon Uroš established his court at Trikala, and in 1366/7 he founded the Meteora monasteries nearby. Symeon was succeeded by his son John Uroš, and he in turn by the local magnates Alexios Angelos Philanthropenos and Manuel Angelos Philanthropenos, who ruled until the Ottoman conquest of Thessaly in 1393/4.

=== Ottoman period ===

Under Ottoman rule, the city was called &quot;Tırhala&quot;. Its fortunes in the early period of Ottoman rule are unclear: it is reported as being part of a large &quot;sanjak&quot; under Ahmed, the son of Evrenos Bey, but in the early 15th century it formed part of the domain of Turahan Bey, who brought in Muslim settlers and granted privileges to the local Greek population. Turahan and his son and successor, Ömer Bey, erected many buildings in the city, helping it, in the words of the historian Alexandra Yerolimpos, to &quot;[acquire] the appearance of a typical Ottoman town, with mosques, &quot;medreses&quot;, a &quot;hammam&quot;, &quot;imaret&quot;, &quot;khan&quot; and &quot;karwansaray&quot; extending beyond the citadel and the Varoussi (Varosh) quarter which remained Christian&quot;.

As the administrative center of the local province (the Sanjak of Trikala), the city attracted Muslim immigrants and had large Muslim and Jewish communities: in the 1454/5 census, the city had 2,453 inhabitants (251 Muslim families and 9 widows, and 212 Christian families and 73 widows); in 1506, the city numbered 3,100 inhabitants, with 260 Muslim, 310 Christian and 19 Jewish families; in 1520/38, the number had risen to 301 Muslim, 343 Christian, and 181 Jewish families. The city also became an important intellectual center during these years (1543–1854) with the Trikke School (and later Greek School), where famous intellectuals of the time, such as Dionysius the Philosopher, taught. Christian children from Trikala also became Janissaries. According to the 1603-4 &quot;eşkal defter&quot; Christian boys from the villages around the town were included in the batch that the Turnacıbaşı, the Chief collection officer levied.

The 17th-century Ottoman traveller Evliya Çelebi reports that the city had 2,300 houses divided into sixteen Muslim and eight Christian quarters (&quot;mahalla&quot;); eight mosques, of which only the city&#x27;s main mosque, the Osman Shah Mosque built by Mimar Sinan, survives today; four &quot;hammams&quot;; six &quot;tekkes&quot;; and the probably exaggerated number of 1,000 shops, although Evliya curiously does not mention the city&#x27;s impressive &quot;bezesten&quot; (covered market) which was demolished in the early 20th century. The city was largely burned down in a great fire in 1749, a destruction repeated by Albanian irregulars following an abortive uprising by the local Christian population during the Orlov Revolt. Despite the destruction, its population seems to have remained the same, ca. 25,000, until the outbreak of the Greek Revolution in 1821. By 1840, it reportedly had only 10,000 inhabitants, with the last Ottoman census in 1877/8 listing 25,000 inhabitants for the entire &quot;sanjak&quot; of Trikala.

===Modern period===
On 23 August 1881 with the Treaty of Constantinople between the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Greece, the city passed in Greek sovereignty, along with the rest of Thessaly. It became occupied again by Ottoman forces briefly during the Greco-Turkish War of 1897. In the years that followed, Trikala played a fundamental role in the rural workers&#x27; mobilizations, in the early 20th century, against the Thessalian landlords (). Trikala eventually became the city that the first Agricultural Cooperative of Greece was founded, in 1906.

Historically, Trikala and its surroundings had a notable concentration of Aromanians, including from other regions.

The town lost much of its Ottoman and medieval buildings in the early 20th century, particularly after it was rebuilt to a modern urban plan in the 1930s.

Trikala today is a vibrant greek city, well known throughout Greece for its river that bisects the city center and also for the historic monuments and the picturesque old town.

<text>Florina (, &quot;Perifereiakí Enótita Flórinas&quot;) is one of the regional units of Greece. It is part of the region of Western Macedonia, in the geographic region of Macedonia, Greece. Its capital is the town of Florina. The total population is around 45,000 (2021).

==Geography==

Florina borders the regional units of Pella to the east, Kozani to the south and Kastoriá to the southwest. At the Greek international borders, it is adjacent to Albania (Korçë County) to the west, North Macedonia (Bitola and Resen municipalities) to the north and Lake Prespa to the northwest, where the two borders cross each other. Lake Vegoritida is situated in the east.

Mountains in the regional unit include Verno (), Varnous () and Voras ().

==Administration==

As from 2011 the regional unit of Florina is subdivided into three municipalities. These are (number as in the map in the infobox):
*Amyntaio (2)
*Florina (1)
*Prespes (3)

===Prefecture===

Florina was created as a prefecture (, &quot;Nomós Flórinas&quot;) in 1915. As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Florina was created out of the former prefecture Florina. The prefecture had the same territory as the present regional unit. At the same time, the municipalities were reorganised, according to the table below.

==Demographics==
The demographic composition of the area the 19th and early 20th centuries is unclear as many factors contributed to the ethnic orientation of the people; out of these religion was particularly important thus giving rise to a proselytism struggle between the Greek Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and the Bulgarian Exarchate (established in 1870). In 1886, 78.4% of the Christian population of the Florina &quot;kaza&quot; (district) - a part of Manastir Vilayet (province) - was aligned with the Ecumenical Patriarchate and 21.6% with the Bulgarian Exarchate, however by 1900 the Patriarchatists had dropped to 50.9% and Exarchatists had risen to 49.1%. In 1914 the majority of the Christian population of the Florina district was recorded as Exarchist Bulgarian (59%), 70% of whom were monolingual in Bulgarian only.

The 1920s was a period of migration, displacement, deportation and a voluntary exchange of populations between Greece and Bulgaria, during which the Greek government aimed to remove Slavic-speakers with fanatic Bulgarian sentiments from Greek Macedonia.). In 1925, according to the Prefect of Florina 52% of the population were schismatics (up from about 20% in 1886), 25% were Patriarchists, 15% were refugees, 6% were Vlachs (Aromanians) and 3% were indigenous Greeks. According to government sources, in 1925 there were 45,527 Slav speakers, of whom 34,234 former Exarchists and 11,293 former Patriarchists; 7449 Greek refugees; 3590 Vlachs (Aromanians); 1882 indigenous Greeks; 349 Jews and 27 Muslim Albanians. According to Kollopoulos in 1925 the recorded Slav Macedonians were 64,465 and constituted 64% of the population of the district of Florina, of whom 28,673 were schismatic. The 1928 census showed 38,562 Slavic speakers in the nome of Florina or 31% of the population, but according to contemporary Greek authors the numbers of this census &quot;clearly&quot; do not reflect the actual strength of the minority as a result of official policy and Greek government of reluctance. According to the Prefect of Florina, P. Kalligas, in 1930 there were 76,370 (61%), of whom 61,950 (49% of the population) lacked Greek consciousness, while his successor V. Balkos estimates those speaking Bulgarian as 75-80% of the population of the nome in 1931. According to the Prefect of Florina, in 1935 of 11,683 families 56% had Slavic national consciousness , while 41.3% were &quot;foreign speakers&quot; with Greek national consciousness.

The local Greek population includes a linguistic minority of bilingual Slavophones, who in the early 1990s formed about 64% of the rural population and about 16% of the prefecture&#x27;s total population.&quot; Anastasia Karakasidou estimated that 80% of the population of Florina Prefecture is either Slavic-speaking or descended from Slavic-speaking families. There also exist smaller communities of Aromanians and Arvanites, which today mostly have an ethnic Greek identity.

A diverse range of dialects are spoken in the regional unit alongside the official standard and local Macedonian varieties of Greek. A minority of people speak the local ethnic Macedonian dialects and especially the Lower Prespa dialect and the Prilep-Bitola dialect.

According to the 2021 census, the population of Florina regional unit was 44,880 people. In the 2009 European elections in Greece, 1,195 people from Florina Prefecture voted for the Rainbow Party.

==Agriculture==
Florina is rich in agriculture. The main production are peppers, beans and peaches. Beans are produced near Lake Prespa.

==Transport==
The main roads of Florina regional unit are Greek National Road 2 (Albania - Krystallopigi - Florina - Edessa - ...), Greek National Road 3 (North Macedonia - Niki - Florina - Amyntaio - Kozani - ...) and Greek National Road 15 (Agios Germanos - Kastoria - ...).

<text>Grevena (, &quot;Grevená&quot; ; ) is a town and municipality in Western Macedonia, northern Greece, capital of the Grevena regional unit. The town&#x27;s current population is 12,515 citizens (2021). It lies about from Athens and about from Thessaloniki. The municipality&#x27;s population is 25,905. Grevena has had access to the A2 motorway (Egnatia Odos) since the early 2000s, which now connects Igoumenitsa with Thessaloniki and Alexandroupoli at the border with Turkey. Mountains surround the municipality, which is situated by the river Greveniotikos, which itself flows into the Aliakmon. Other significant towns in the municipality are Amygdaliés and Méga Seiríni. Grevena Municipal Museum is located in the town.

==History==
===Ottoman period===
Under Ottoman rule, Grevena was a small administrative and military centre, the seat of a kaza belonging to the Sanjak of Serfiğe within the Vilayet of Manastir. According to the statistics of Vasil Kanchov (&quot;Macedonia, Ethnography and Statistics&quot;), 600 Greek Christians, 500 Turks, 200 Greek Muslims, 150 Aromanians and 100 Romani lived in the town in 1900.

Grevena was a mixed town and a part of its population were Greek-speaking Muslim Vallahades. The 1920 Greek census recorded 3,108 people in Grevena, and 200 inhabitants (40 families) were Muslim in 1923. Following the Greek–Turkish population exchange, Greek refugee families in Grevena were from East Thrace (6), Asia Minor (33) and Pontus (16) in 1926. The 1928 Greek census recorded 3,747 town inhabitants. In 1928, the refugee families numbered 52 (194 people). 

Due to its small size, the town&#x27;s Ottoman past, represented through a few public buildings and the homes of Muslims located in the urban centre, all disappeared during the 20th century. A mosque and a madrasa remained in Grevena until the population exchange; later both were destroyed. Another mosque existed in Grevena and was converted into a church in 1927; later it and its minaret were demolished, and the church of Agios Achillios built on the site. Military barracks remained until World War Two, and were later destroyed. The large granite fortress residence (konak) of Veli Bey was destroyed after the population exchange.

===1995 earthquake===
The earthquake that occurred in the region on 13 May 1995 was 6.6 on the Richter magnitude scale, but it caused only material damage. The worst hit area was the county of Ventzia. There were two foreshocks of lesser intensity that preceded the main earthquake by a few minutes and warned people. These warnings sent the population out of their houses. When the main earthquake came, it destroyed nearly all the houses in several villages of the Ventzia County – the houses collapsed to the ground – but all the inhabitants were outside. 
Another earthquake on 5 January 2005 measured 4.9 near Grevena. It took place at 20:00 local time (EET), and no damage was reported. Another earthquake with a measured intensity of 5.4 occurred on 17 July 2007 at 21:23 local time (EET) and was followed by weak aftershocks. Some older buildings were lightly damaged in villages northeast of Grevena.

<text>Kastoria (, &quot;Kastoriá&quot; ) is a city in northern Greece in the region of Western Macedonia. It is the capital of Kastoria regional unit, in the geographic region of Macedonia. It is situated on a promontory on the western shore of Lake Orestiada, in a valley surrounded by limestone mountains. The town is known for its many Byzantine churches, Byzantine and Ottoman-era domestic architecture, its lake and its fur clothing industry.

== Name ==
In the 6th century, the historian Procopius wrote the name Kastoria was used for the lake. The first reference to the town of Kastoria is by historian John Skylitzes writing about the late 10th century. The toponym Kastoria means &quot;place of beavers&quot; and is derived from &quot;kastori&quot; (καστόρι), the Greek word for beaver and an animal whose local habitat was along the shores of lake Kastoria. The name of the town is sometimes written as &quot;Castoria&quot;, especially in older works. The town is known as &quot;Kesriye&quot; in Turkish, &quot;Kostur&quot; (Cyrillic: Костур) in Bulgarian and Macedonian, &quot;Kosturi&quot; in Albanian and &quot;Kusturea&quot; in Aromanian.

==Municipality==

The municipality Kastoria was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 9 former municipalities, that became municipal units:
*Agia Triada
*Agioi Anargyroi
*Kastoria
*Kastraki
*Kleisoura
*Korestia
*Makednoi
*Mesopotamia
*Vitsi

The municipality has an area of 763.330 km2, the municipal unit 57.318 km2. The municipal unit consists of the town Kastoria and the settlements Aposkepos, Kefalari and Chloi.

===Districts===
*Apózari
*Doltsó
*Dailaki (Myloi)
*Doplitsa
*Kato Agora
*Kallithea
*Lyv

==Climate==
Kastoria has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;). As a result of the moderating effect of the lake, it records less extreme temperatures than the rest of Western Macedonia.
==History==

=== Antiquity ===

Kastoria was the site of previous settlements, the first being Celetrum (or Keletron), a town located near a lake in Orestis and mentioned by historian Livy in reference to the events of 199 BC. Celetrum surrendered to Publius Sulpicius Galba during the Roman war (200–197 BC) against Philip V of Macedon. The ancient town was possibly located on a hill above the town&#x27;s current location.

The Roman Emperor Diocletian (ruled 284–305 AD) founded the town of Diocletianopolis (Διοκλητιανούπολις) in the vicinity. After Diocletianopolis was destroyed by barbarians, Emperor Justinian relocated it on a promontory projecting into Lake Orestiada, the town&#x27;s current location, and Procopius writes the emperor &quot;gave it an appropriate name&quot;, perhaps indicating that he renamed it Justinianopolis (Ίουστινιανούπολις). References to Justinian&#x27;s settlement cease during the 7th and 8th centuries, due to the possible abandonment of the location. Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus made an anachronistic mention of Diocletianopolis in his work &quot;De Thematibus&quot; (10th century).

=== Middle Ages ===

The origins of Kastoria are from the 9th century, as its surrounding walls and oldest churches, such as St. Stephan and the Taxiarchs, date from the era. The first mention of the settlement of Kastoria was by Skylitzes in relation to events of the late 10th century during the Byzantine–Bulgarian wars. The town was in Bulgarian hands until 1018, when it was conquered by Basil II.

Kastoria was occupied by the Normans under Bohemond I in 1082/83. In October 1083, emperor Alexios I Komnenos forced the garrison to surrender, recovering thus the town and convincing many Norman troops, including Peter Aliphas, to enter his services.

During the 13th and 14th centuries, the town became contested between several powers and changed hands often. The Second Bulgarian Empire held the city under Kaloyan and Ivan Asen II. Under the Bulgarians, Kastoria had a significant Romaniote Jewish community, with prominent individuals such as scholar Tobiah ben Eliezer.

Later, it was recovered by the Despotate of Epirus. The Nicaean Empire captured it in ca. 1252, but lost it again to Epirus in ca. 1257, only for the Nicaeans to recapture it following the Battle of Pelagonia (1259).

In the early 14th century, Kastoria was part of the domain of John II Doukas, &quot;&quot;doux&quot; of Great Vlachia and Kastoria&quot;. After his death, the town became part of the semi-autonomous domain of Stephen Gabrielopoulos. After the latter&#x27;s death in 1332/3, the Byzantine emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos took over the town, but in the very next year (1334) it was surrendered briefly to the Serbs by the renegade Syrgiannes Palaiologos.

The Serbian ruler Stephen Dushan finally captured Kastoria in 1342/3, taking advantage of the ongoing Byzantine civil war, and made it part of his Serbian Empire. After Dushan&#x27;s death, Kastoria became the seat of Symeon Uroš.

The town came later under the Epirote ruler Thomas Preljubović, and then under the Albanian Muzaka family, until it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the mid-1380s.

=== Ottoman era ===
The Ottoman Turks conquered Kastoria around 1385, but it is unclear whether by force or by an agreement with its Albanian rulers. Following the conquest and depopulation of Constantinople, the Romaniote Jews from Kastoria were forcefully resettled by the Ottomans in Balat district as part of efforts to repopulate the city. Toward the end of the 15th century, Jews expelled from Italy, Sicily, Portugal and Spain settled in Kastoria. In 1519, Kastoria was a zeamet of Chamberlain Mehmed Bey, and the infantry commander of Thessaloniki, Hızır. The town also had Voynuks.
The establishment of Ottoman rule resulted in the demise of the local Greek landowning class, and funding of the arts and culture in Kastoria was undertaken by its wealthy merchants. The Greek merchants Georgios Kyritses and Manolakis Kastorianos financed Greek education in Kastoria. Greek schools were established in Kastoria, with the oldest in the town and Macedonia being founded in 1614; a second was founded in 1705, and a third in 1715, funded by Kyritses.

In 1797–1798, the Greek revolutionary Rigas Feraios was partly based in Kastoria. Among his co-conspirators were several Kastorian Greeks, such as Georgios Theocharis, and the brothers Panagiotis and John Emmanuel. When they were arrested by the Austrian authorities and handed over to the Ottomans, John Emmanuel admitted that he had smuggled a copy of Feraios&#x27; revolutionary song &quot;Thourios&quot; () into Kastoria and sang it there many times. Theocharis escaped execution thanks to his Austrian citizenship, but those of Feraios&#x27; companions that did not possess foreign citizenship were executed. When the Greek War of Independence broke out in 1821, there was Greek revolutionary activity in Kastoria as throughout the towns and villages of western Macedonia. John Papareskas was a notable Greek revolutionary from Kastoria. Revolutinary activity attracted the attention of the Ottoman authorities and the Ottoman commander Mehmet Emin took several Greek notables as hostages from towns in western Macedonia, including Kastoria.

Following the destruction of Moscopole (late eighteenth century), some Aromanian refugees attempted to settle in Kastoria, and their efforts were unsuccessful due to concerns by local Kastorians over economic competition from newcomers. Later, Aromanians with origins from Moscopole, Nikolicë, Vithkuq and other locations settled in Kastoria, and by the mid–nineteenth century the upper class of the town&#x27;s Greek community was formed mostly by Aromanian families.

In the late Ottoman period, Kastoria was the seat of a kaza belonging to the sanjak of Görice, within the Vilayet of Monastir.

The older presence of Greek cultural tradition led to the establishment of strong Greek national feeling among town inhabitants in an era of conflict arising from nationalism (late 19th and early 20th centuries). As a result, Kastoria became the main location for the Greek movement in west Macedonia during this period.

===Macedonian Struggle and Balkan Wars===

As a largely Greek town in west Macedonia at the turn of the 20th century, Kastoria featured prominently in the Greek efforts during the Macedonian Struggle. A notable figure was Germanos Karavangelis, who served as the Greek Orthodox Metropolitan Bishop of Kastoria from 1900 until 1907. Karavangelis thought that the post-Ottoman future of Macedonia would be decided by Balkan states, and viewed Bulgarian influence in the area as the greatest threat to Greek interests. He formed the earliest Greek armed groups fighting for the region. During the Macedonian struggle, Karavangelis, an imposing figure, traveled in rural areas and directed the Greek response toward supporters of the Bulgarian cause, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (VMRO) and the Exarchate. He supported close interaction among local Turks and Greeks, but only when it was needed. Greece sent more funds, men and arms to individuals such as Karavangelis in Macedonia. When the Greek fighter and officer Pavlos Melas was killed in action in 1904, Karavangelis arranged to have his body buried within the Metropolis of Kastoria, after first having threatened to mobilize the town&#x27;s Greek population if the Ottoman authorities did not surrender Melas&#x27; body.

===Modern Greece===

Ottoman rule ended in Kastoria after it was taken by the Greek Army in the First Balkan War (1912). In 1913, the town was annexed and the treaties of London and Bucharest formally recognised Kastoria and the wider area as part of Greece.

=== World War II ===
During both World War II and the Greek Civil War, the town was repeatedly fought over and heavily damaged in the process. It was nearly captured by the Communist Democratic Army of Greece in 1948, and the final battles of the civil war took place on the nearby Mount Gramos in 1949.

In 1940, Kastoria came under Italian occupation. In 1943, the judicial courts of Kastoria were destroyed by fire, including the town archive. Italy surrendered in late 1943, and Kastoria came under German control. In April 1944 the German army sent the town&#x27;s Jews first to Thessaloniki and later to the Auschwitz concentration camp where they were gassed. In 1945, the Kastoria Jewish community numbered 35 people, a reduction of 95 percent due to the Holocaust.

Kastoria was liberated from German rule by the guerrillas of the Greek People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

=== Contemporary period ===
Following the Greek Civil War, large numbers of Kastorian Greeks migrated abroad, where in the 1980s they numbered 25,000 in the New York area, and worked as furriers; younger generations worked as lawyers and doctors. A Kastorian Greek diaspora numbering 10,000 in the 1980s established itself in Frankfurt after it replaced Leipzig as Germany&#x27;s new fur industry centre, following its post–war division. Nowadays Kastoria is a prosperous provincial town, its economy being mainly driven by the fur industry and tourism, the latter due to the town&#x27;s physical attractiveness and many historical Byzantine churches.

==Economy==

Kastoria is a popular tourist destination and an international centre of fur trade, having taken so the nickname &quot;the city of the fur traders&quot;. Tourism and the fur industry dominate the local economy. Indeed, (as mentioned above) the town was possibly named after one of the former staples of the trade – the European beaver (&quot;kastóri&quot; in Greek), now extinct in the area. Trading in mink fur now predominates and every year an international showcase of fur takes place in the city. 

Involvement with fur began in the early middle ages, when Kastoria supplied ermine pelts for the robes of Byzantine courtiers. The fur industry was established in Kastoria during the sixteenth century, and extensive trade links emerged connecting the town with wider Europe. Merchants settled in Germany and Russia. In the seventeenth century, Kastoria was the European fur industry centre and marketplace, and various fur products on offer were imports (such as pelts from Russian sable), with a majority of Kastorian Jews being wealthy dealers in the fur trade. By the late 18th century, Kastoria had developed a strong Hellenic commercial culture.

In Kastoria, Jews participated in trade and tanning production. The Jewish community was involved in the fur industry, and its merchants worked closely with craftsmen who were mainly from the Greek community. The town economy was successful, in particular during the nineteenth century, due to both Jews and Greeks working well together. Slavophone peasants from the wider area would go to Kastoria on market days. By the early twentieth century, Jewish merchants were involved in the trade of fur and tobacco. The Muslim population of Kastoria in 1913 worked as fishermen (30 percent) in Lake Kastoria, in agriculture (13 percent), or were large landowners (16 percent). In the interwar period, local Jews were involved in the textile, agricultural, and raw material sectors of Kastoria&#x27;s economy.

In modern Kastoria, there are more than 300 small and big dealers in fur. Abroad, early twentieth century immigration to New York from Kastoria by Greeks involved in fur production expanded the local US industry, as demand for fur clothing increased, with most small businesses owned by Kastorian Greeks. The modern fur industry in New York is run by Kastorian Greeks, such as Castor Furs; a business involved in the fashion industry. Other industries include the sale and distribution of locally grown produce; particularly wheat, apples, wine, and fish. Recently a large shopping center has been built in the city of Kastoria. Kastoria has 16 local radio stations, two TV stations, five daily newspapers, and seven weekly ones. The town&#x27;s airport is named Aristotelis Airport.

==Population==
===Historical===
The Ottoman fiscal register of 1445 showed a total population of 4,518, of which 3,977 were Chritians, 431 were Jews, and 110 were Muslims. 

In 1519, the town had 4,815 people, of which 4,480 were Christians and 335 were Muslims, divided into 732 Christian households and 67 Muslim households. Muslims were a minority in Kastoria, and would remain a minority for the duration of Ottoman rule.

According to the findings of Vasil Kanchov, at the turn of the 20th century, the town had 3,000 Greek Christians, 1,600 Turkish Muslims, 750 Jews, 300 Bulgarian Christians, 300 Albanian Christians, and 240 Roma, for a total of 6,190 inhabitants. According to the findings of Dimitri Mishev, the town had a population of 4,000 Greek Christians, 400 Bulgarian Patriarchist Grecomans and 72 Vlachs in 1905 (excluding the Muslim minority).

The 1920 Greek census recorded 6,280 people in the town, and 829 inhabitants (242 families) were Muslim in 1923. The Muslim minority of Kastoria was sent to Turkey during the Greek–Turkish population exchange (1923), and resettled in places such as Bor, Kahramanmaraş, and Yozgat in Turkey. Following the exchange, there were 101 Greek refugee families from Asia Minor, 19 from East Thrace, and one from Pontus in 1926. The 1928 Greek census recorded 10,308 inhabitants. In 1928, Greek refugee families numbered 137 (588 people).

===Jewish Community===
A Jewish presence in the area is recorded as early as late antiquity, when a Jewish community resided in Emperor Justinian&#x27;s settlement. At the time of the First Bulgarian Empire, Kastoria had a significant Romaniote Jewish community, with prominent individuals such as scholar Tobiah ben Eliezer.

Following the conquest and depopulation of Constantinople, the Romaniote Jews from Kastoria led by Matthias Tamar, were forcefully resettled by the Ottomans in Balat district as part of efforts to repopulate the city. A synagogue named after Kastoria was built and still stands in modern Istanbul. Toward the end of the 15th century, Jews expelled from Italy, Sicily, Portugal and Spain settled in Kastoria and became an important part of the population.

In the late seventeenth century, the Jewish messianic Sabbatean movement had some prominent supporters in Kastoria, although most remained as practicing Jews. An epidemic during 1719–1720 resulted in 62 deaths among the Jewish community. Jews with Italian and Spanish origins from Vlorë, later went to Berat, and by 1740 had resettled in Kastoria due to several epidemics. 

Several blood libels were made toward the Jewish community during the 19th century. In 1873, a Jewish school was founded in the town. Bandits took 70 Jews hostage in 1887, and their release was secured by the Jewish community. Some Kastorian Jews migrated to Salonika. Ladino-speaking Jews immigrated to the United States, and by the early twentieth century those from Kastoria had formed a Kastoria Society. In the modern period, the community still uses the name Kastoria for burial plots. Under Ottoman rule, the Jews of Kastoria had close ties with the Jewish community of Monastir (modern Bitola). The levels of Jewish education increased in Kastoria after the organisation Alliance Israélite Universelle provided funding and support in 1903. In the early twentieth century, the Kastorian Jews were Sephardim and numbered some 1,600. In Kastoria, the Jewish community had a chief rabbi, three yeshivot (Jewish religious schools), and several synagogues. In 1906 the Jewish population numbered 1,600, and in 1908 a blood libel occurred.

Throughout the 1920s, the Jewish community had two synagogues, two welfare organisations, a society for burials, a kindergarten and school. In 1928, Kastorian Jews numbered 1,000. In 1928, a Zionist association was formed in Kastoria, and some of the town&#x27;s Jewish children were sent to study and live in Mandate Palestine.

In World War Two, Kastoria and its Jewish population came under Italian, and later, German occupation. The Jewish community numbered 900 people in 1940 and 1943. Some Jews became partisans, and others fled to a nearby village. In late March 1944, 763 Kastorian Jews residing in the Jewish neighbourhood were taken prisoner, while 50 went into hiding, and the Greek Orthodox Archbishop secured the release of 30–40 Jews. During April 1944, the German army sent the town&#x27;s Jews first to Thessaloniki, and later to the Auschwitz concentration camp where they were gassed. In 1945, the Kastoria Jewish community numbered 35 people; a reduction of 95 percent due to the Holocaust.

The Jewish population of Kastoria was 38 in 1948, 27 in 1959, two in 1973, and five in 1983. Post war, heirless Jewish properties of Kastoria were 22 dwellings, three shops, and 35 land lots, and were administered by the OPAIE (The Heirless Property and Jewish Rehabilitation Fund). In the early 1970s, the Central Board of Jewish Communities, an organisation representing Jewish communities in Greece, attempted to liquidate Jewish properties in Kastoria with support from a few local Jews, several other Kastorians, and officials. The Kastoria Jewish diaspora in Israel and the US supported moves to reclaim the properties. The Central Board managed to gain control of a few communal properties after purchasing them from their Jewish owners. The Jewish community had dwindled to one family, and during the 1980s, relatives and business were factors which influenced Jews to remain in Kastoria. By the late twentieth century the Jewish presence in Kastoria had disappeared due to deaths and migration. Members from the Kastorian Jewish diaspora produced &quot;Trezoros: The Lost Jews of Kastoria&quot;, a documentary about the Jews of Kastoria.

==Landmarks==
===Byzantine monuments===
Kastoria is an important religious centre for the Greek Orthodox Church, and is the seat of a metropolitan bishop. The Metropolis of Kastoria is one of the metropolises of the New Lands in Greece, administered as part of the Church of Greece. Kastoria originally had 72 Byzantine and medieval churches, of which 54 have survived; including Panagia Koumpelidiki and St Athanasius of Mouzaki. Some of these have been restored and provide useful insight into trends in Late Byzantine styles of architecture and fresco painting.

The Museum of Byzantine History located on Dexamenis Square houses many examples of Byzantine iconography. The Costume Museum and the Monuments Museum are also located in the city.

=== Doltsó and Apózari ===

During the Ottoman times, Kastoria attracted a multitude of people from across the Balkans and beyond, resulting in a diverse, multi-ethnic community. As a result, the city plan was radically transformed. The different ethnic communities, Bulgarian, Turkish, Greek, and Jewish, became centred around separate neighbourhoods or &#x27;quarters&#x27;. Two old Greek lakeside quarters, the &quot;Doltso&quot; (Dolcho) and &quot;Apozari&quot; neighbourhoods, are among the best-preserved and last remaining traditional quarters of the city.

These neighbourhoods are characterised by the rich stock of old houses preserved in the shape of autonomous historic buildings, such as the important private mansions or the more humble folk dwellings (&#x27;accessory&#x27; buildings) built between the 17th and 19th centuries. During this time, the processing and exporting of animal furs to Europe created wealth, and city mansions, of particular architectural and decorative value, were built. This interconnected nexus of churches and private houses constitutes a rare example of a Byzantine and post-Byzantine township, and remains inhabited to this day.

The traditional buildings and manor houses of the &quot;Doltso&quot; and &quot;Apozari&quot; neighbourhoods are threatened by modern development in the city, as well as structural degradation from poor levels of conservation. These sites were included on the 7 Most Endangered list of Europe&#x27;s most at-risk monuments and sites in 2014.

===Jewish Monuments===

During the late fifteenth century, a synagogue in Kastoria was built and was one of several in the region with the name Aragon. Kastoria had four synagogues (Italian, Portuguese, Romaniot and Spanish) in the early 18th century. Fire destroyed three synagogues between 1719 and 1720. A synagogue was constructed in 1750, and destroyed during 1828. In 1830, another synagogue named Aragon was erected by the Jewish community. Following World War Two, the Aragon synagogue was sold by the Central Board of Jewish Communities, and the new owners demolished it. The Jewish cemetery of Kastoria was neglected from the late interwar period, and had by the 1970s become overgrown with vegetation. The Greek army expropriated the cemetery in the next decade and turned the site into military barracks. Several stones were preserved. Some tombstones were repurposed for the storage room floor, and most stones were reused to construct the pathways of the site and barracks.

===Ottoman monuments===
During the Ottoman era, a Muslim minority resided in Kastoria and constructed various public, private and religious buildings. Kastoria had seven mosques in the late Ottoman period. Several mosques were constructed on sites or used, as had been Muslim practice, earlier Christian churches. Gazi Ervenos Mosque or Gula Mosque was the earliest built in the town after the Ottoman conquest. After 1912, Greek troops in Kastoria demolished the minaret and in 1926 the remaining mosque was demolished and replaced with a reservoir. Kule Mosque or Mosque of Dioikitiriou was repurposed following the population exchange into a grain warehouse, later a notary office. In 1950, Kastoria Municipality expropriated and demolished the building.
Prodromou Mosque was declared preserved during 1925, later the National Bank sold it and was demolished. Tabahane Mosque was also declared preserved in 1925 and later demolished in unknown circumstances. Hasan Kadi Mosque and Giahli or Giali Mosque were both destroyed. Gazi Mosque was used by the metropolitan and is well preserved. Kursum Mosque, named for its lead roof was declared preserved during 1925. Prior to Muslims leaving Kastoria, its last imam sold the mosque and under Greece has been used as a museum and as an antiquities warehouse, closed to the public. It is the only surviving mosque in Kastoria in a moderate state of preservation and in the early to mid 2020s was undergoing restoration work.

The Bektashi tekke was dedicated to Kasim Baba, a Sufi holy man. It was demolished. Another tekke belonged to the Hayati, an offshoot of the Halveti Order. Three tekkes, one used by Sufis as a hermitage, another by dervishes and a third affiliated with the Mevlevi Order were all demolished. Another three tekkes were destroyed following the population exchange. Burial monuments (turbes) were located in the vicinity of mosques or in Muslim cemeteries, such as one in Kursum Mosque&#x27;s courtyard, later destroyed. The turbe of Aydin Baba and the turbe of Kasim Baba were located on a hill above Kastoria, both destroyed. Muslim cemeteries were expropriated and demolished.

Kastoria&#x27;s Muslims had four primary schools, an elementary school and a madrassa. The Madrassa, a theological school with an open courtyard was declared a preserved monument by Greece in 1925 and repurposed as a depot for salt and other products. The building is presently closed and abandoned, some restoration has occurred and is in a state of moderate preservation. Remnants of a hamam are located in the Apozari neighbourhood. Portions of Kastoria&#x27;s Ottoman walls are a protected monument (declared in 1932 and 1945), although some parts were demolished for other building projects. A late Ottoman era guardhouse served as a penal prison till 1958 and was later demolished.

Some Muslim private buildings consisted of large inns and houses belonging to beys, later most were demolished. An unfinished Turkish Konak or official residence, a late Ottoman building was demolished in 1935. The Mathioudakis barracks, a military Ottoman structure from the early twentieth century was used from the interwar period to 2006 by the Greek army, who also erected several buildings within the complex. The Mathioudakis barracks now belongs to Kastoria municipality who has sought to demolish and rebuild it as a police station with pushback from town locals who advocate for its preservation.

===Modern period===

Under Greece, support came from Greek politicians such as Ion Dragoumis and Eleftherios Venizelos to conserve Kastoria&#x27;s architectural uniqueness. Muslims left Kastoria following the population exchange in 1923 and a new urban plan modernised and changed the town&#x27;s architectural layout and space. Efforts were aimed at conserving churches; other structures such as mansions, walls and Muslim buildings were neglected, with a majority of Ottoman era buildings demolished. The period of the 1930s brought some architectural alterations and overall the town retained its traditional form until the 1960s when new construction proceeded in an anarchic manner changing Kastoria.

<text>Kozani (, ) is a town in northern Greece, capital of Kozani regional unit and of Western Macedonia. It is located in the western part of Macedonia, in the northern part of the Aliakmonas river valley. The city lies above sea level, northwest of the artificial lake Polyfytos, south-west of Thessaloniki, between the mountains Pieria, Vermio, Vourinos and Askio. The population of the Kozani municipality is over 67,000 people. The climate of the area is continental with cold and dry winters, and hot summers.

Kozani is the home of the University of Western Macedonia, with about 15,000 students from all over Greece and other places. It is also the seat of West Macedonia&#x27;s court of appeal, police department, fire brigade, the seat of the 1st Army Corps of the Hellenic Army and of the Bishop of &quot;Servia and Kozani&quot;.One of the most important aspects of local folklore is Kozani&#x27;s carnival at the end of the winter, which retains much of the profanity of the ancient Dionysiac cult. Kozani is renowned in Greece and abroad for the production of saffron (&quot;Krokos Kozanis&quot;), in the nearby town of Krokos.

Kozani is a transport node between Central Macedonia, Thessaly and Epirus. The nearest airport is Filippos Airport, from the city, IATA code: KZI. The airport was first opened in the mid-20th century. Kozani is situated near the A2 motorway, which connects the coast of the Ionian Sea with Thessaloniki and Turkish borders.

==Etymology==
According to prevailing opinion in Greece, the name comes from the village of Epirus &quot;Kósdiani&quot;, the origin of settlers of Kozani in 1392. The settlement was first named Kózdiani, which then, it was changed into Kóziani, and in the end into Kozáni.

==History==

===Antiquity===
Antiquities from the prehistoric to the Byzantine period have been unearthed in many sectors of the city. In the east part of Kozani, an ancient necropolis has been found, dating to the early Iron Age. During Philip II of Macedon&#x27;s reign, the region was named &quot;Elimeia&quot;, which was part of Upper Macedonia and probably in the same place there was a town named Tyrissa (Greek: Τύρισσα). In the south-west of the modern city, on Siopoto hill, there was a settlement named &quot;Kalyvia&quot;, between 1100 and 1300, traces of which are still preserved.

===Ottoman period===
Kozani was probably founded by Christian settlers who, after the Ottoman conquest, withdrew from the plains of Macedonia into the mountains, during the 14th and 15th centuries. Its secure position soon attracted other Christians expelled from Epirus, in 1392. Together with the settlers from Epirus, many cattle-breeders moved in the region.

The first recorded mention of Kozani is in an Ottoman register of 1528, as a settlement with 91 houses, 23 singles and 15 widows. In the Ottoman tahrir defter (number 167) of 1530, the settlement is recorded as a village with the name , and was within the kaza of &quot;Serfice&quot;. One of the most important colonizers of Kozani was the chief shepherd Ioannis Trantas, who settled about 100 families. His son, Charisios Trantas, managed to obtain a Sultan&#x27;s firman in 1664, according to the terms of which the town came under the protection of the Sultan&#x27;s mother, was endowed with many privileges, and became forbidden for the Turks to settle in.

In 1664, the magnificent church of (St. Nicholas Cathedral) was built. In 1668, the library and the famous school of Kozani were founded. During the 17th and 18th century, commercial relations with the countries of central Europe gave the opportunity for the city to flourish economically. During the 19th century, as foreign travellers relate, the population of the town was Greek, and was growing.

The town&#x27;s growth was disrupted in 1770, because of conflict that erupted between Kozani&#x27;s local inhabitants and Kozanite merchants in central Europe, who contributed to the town&#x27;s prosperity; even more catastrophically, the city was pillaged by Turkish beys in 1770. A subsequent incursion by Aslan bey, in 1830, ravaged the city immensely. In 1855 next to St. Nicholas Church a 26 meters high bell tower was built, which would become the symbol of the city. In 1939, a clock was added to the top of the tower, donated by Greek-American, Konstantinos Mamatsios.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Kozani was part of the Manastir Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. In the 1881–1893 census, the kaza of had a total population of 27,652; consisting of 15,017 Muslims, 12,633 Greek Orthodox, and two Armenians. According to the 1904 population census of the Greek Kingdom&#x27;s consulate, 12,000 Greeks and 350 Aromanians were living in Kozani at the time.

===Balkan wars===


The Greek army entered Kozani on 11 October 1912, during the First Balkan War, after its victory against the Ottoman army in the Battle of Sarantaporo. By this time, the population of the town was 12,000 Orthodox Greeks. In 1923, during the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, about 1,400 Greek families from Pontus and Asia Minor were settled in Kozani.

===Modern times===

In the 20th century, the city grew tremendously, as lignite reserves in the area started being used by the Public Power Corporation, making Kozani the foremost producer of electrical power in Greece. An earthquake that occurred in the region on 13 May 1995, with a magnitude of 6.6 on the Richter scale, caused only property damage.

The city now combines modern with old architecture. Some magnificent buildings are the clock tower, the town hall, the folklore museum, the &quot;Valtadoreio&quot; Gymnasium, the National Bank of Greece building, the &quot;Ermioneion&quot; Hotel and the mansions of Georgios Lassanis and Grigorios Vourkas. The Municipal Library of Kozani called &quot;Kovendareios&quot; is the second biggest in Greece, and it has 150,000 books, rare publications, valuable documents, and one of the rare copies of Rigas Feraios&#x27; charter. For this reason Kozani was included in the National Cultural Network of Cities with object the promotion of the Book and Reading. The Institute of Book and Reading was established and Kozani is now known as &quot;City of Books&quot;. Kozani is the administrative, commercial, economic, and transport centre of the region of West Macedonia.

==Economy==
The city is mostly known for its important contribution to the Greek electricity supply, and a large part of the population works in the Public Power Corporation&#x27;s lignite-fired Agios Dimitrios Power Plant, the largest power plant in Greece. The Ptolemaida Basin hosts the Western Macedonia Lignite Center, which is accountable for the production of forty per cent of the electric energy of the country.

Other famous products are marble, saffron (Krokos, Kozanis), fruits, local wines and specialized arts and crafts industry. The Commercial Exhibition of Kozani takes part in the Exhibition Centre of Western Macedonia in Koila Kozanis every September. Many firms from Greece and other Balkan countries participate, especially with local products.

While Kozani remains a regional banking center, the Kozani-based Co-Operative Bank of Western Macedonia however failed the stress test conducted by the Bank of Greece and subsequently was liquidated in December 2013.

Carnival festivities in Kozani, and in general throughout Greece, last eleven days, starting on ( ; equivalent to Fat Thursday, similar to Mardi Gras) and ending on ( ; similar to Ash Wednesday).

During the Kozani carnival, great bonfires are lit in different parts of the city; every night, another district lights its fire and people dance around it; on the last night of the carnival, all fires are lit. These festive fires, as well as the cultural associations that organize the festivities in each district, are called &quot;Fanoi&quot; (fires). Each &quot;fanos&quot; welcomes visitors and locals to their district with songs and dances, and treats them to local delicacies, namely &quot;kichia&quot; (feta cheese wrapped around a snail-shaped phyllo) and meatballs, as well as wine. Popular songs are sung around the fire, with the singers and crowd dancing in a primitive way that sees repeating the same steps and gestures; at midnight, scatological and explicit songs are sung. In between songs, bands play instrumental songs, such as the &quot;Enteka,&quot; often called Kozani&#x27;s &quot;national anthem&quot;. It is worth nothing that all of these festivities are executed in the city&#x27;s dialect, Kozani Greek.

<text>Acol is the bridge bidding system that, according to &quot;The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge&quot;, is &quot;standard in British tournament play and widely used in other parts of the world&quot;. It is a natural system using four-card majors and, most commonly, a weak no trump.

==Origins==
Acol is named after the Acol Bridge Club in London NW6, where it originated in the early 1930s. The club was founded on Acol Road, named after Acol, Kent. According to Terence Reese, the system&#x27;s main devisers were Maurice Harrison-Gray, Jack Marx and S. J. &quot;Skid&quot; Simon. Marx wrote in the &quot;Contract Bridge Journal&quot; of December 1952, that &quot;...the Acol system was pieced together by Skid Simon and myself the best part of 20 years ago.&quot; In another account, Marx and Simon...
The first book on the system was written by Ben Cohen and Terence Reese. Skid Simon explained the principles that lay behind the system, and the system was further popularised in Britain by Iain Macleod. The Acol system is continually evolving but the underlying principle is to keep the bidding as natural as possible. It is common in the British Commonwealth but rarely played in North America.

Ely Culbertson and his partner Teddy Lightner had visited the Acol Bridge Club in 1934, after which members S.J. Simon and Jack Marx became interested in bridge bidding theory. Simon and Marx soon afterwards began a discussion that eventually led to the first version of the Acol system.

== Bidding system structure ==
As a bidding system, Acol has the following characteristics:
* It is a natural system: most opening bids, responses and rebids are made with at least four cards in the suit bid, and most no trump bids are made with balanced hands.
* It is a four-card major system: only four-card suits are required to open 1 or 1, unlike Standard American and many other systems where five-card suits are typically required.
* It is an &quot;approach forcing system&quot;: as in most modern bidding systems, a new suit in response to a suit opening is forcing, unlike some older systems such as Vienna, which require responder to jump in order to force opener to bid again. 
* It makes extensive use of limit bids: limit bids describe the hand so closely, in terms of high card points (HCP) and shape, that the one who makes the limit bid is expected to pass on the next round, unless partner makes a forcing bid.
* Understanding and correct use of limit bids and forcing bids is fundamental to applying the system: all no trump bids below the level of 4NT are limit bids, as are all suit bids that merely repeat a suit already bid by the partnership; changes of suit may be forcing or not depending on the approach bids.
* The level of the 1NT opening bid influences other bids: the normal choice is between a &quot;weak no trump&quot; (12–14 HCP) and a &quot;strong no trump&quot; (15–17 HCP). In earlier forms of Acol, a &quot;variable no trump&quot; was common; 12–14 non-vulnerable and 16–18 vulnerable.
* It is the only &quot;fully natural&quot; bidding system which does not require a &quot;short club&quot; or &quot;prepared&quot; club or diamond bid with less than four cards. All opening bids at the one-level promise at least four cards in the bid suit.

== Variants ==
Acol is an unregulated system. There is no Acol governing body and no single publication containing the &quot;official&quot; Acol (unlike, for example, Standard American Yellow Card). It can be compared to a living language since it is liable to change at the whim of users. The main versions of Acol in use today are:
* Acol: unregulated Acol, from the simple to the complex, remains in common use throughout the UK. At any one time the version in most common use will be known as &quot;Standard Acol&quot; although this term will mean different things to different players and is sometimes confused with Standard English Acol.
* Standard English Acol (originally called simply &quot;Standard English&quot;) or Bridge for All (BfA) Acol. Developed by the English Bridge Union in 1996, and designed to facilitate the learning of bridge and to provide standardised guidance to novices, intermediate players and their teachers. This variant uses the weak 1NT opening (12–14 points) and strong two opening bids. Simple conventions such as Stayman, Blackwood and Transfers are included at various stages in the learning process. It has been widely promulgated by the EBU and by EBUTA in particular, but the exact form is used mainly by those who have learned their bridge recently and those who taught them.
* Modern Acol: a broad term for modern systems based on standard Acol but adding some additional conventions, particularly transfers and alternative ways of playing opening two-bids, as described below. Varies between partnerships, but typically includes two-suited overcalls, cue bids, checkback Stayman, Jacoby 2NT and Roman Key Card Blackwood.
* Benjaminised (Benji) Acol: recognising that strong two opening bids occur rarely, the 2 and 2 openings are used as weak two bids to show weak hands containing long suits (under 10 HCP and a 6-card suit). Very strong hands (8 or more playing tricks, equivalent to an Acol Strong Two) are shown by an opening bid of 2 which forces a 2 response allowing suits to be shown. The strongest hands (e.g., 23 or more points or a game force hand, equivalent to the Acol 2 opening) are shown by an opening bid of 2.
* Reverse Benji: identical to Benji except that the 2 and 2 bids are switched in meaning. A 2 opening bid is now the strongest bid, as in basic Acol.
* Modern Acol with Three Weak Twos: uses the Standard American pattern where 2 is the only strong bid and 2, as well as 2 and 2, is a weak two bid. Proponents consider that a Benji 2 bid on 23+ or a game forcing hand is too infrequent (about 0.2% of hands) to use up a whole opening bid. A weak two in diamonds is much more common (1.2%). However, some definition is lost on strong hands aiming for slam. 
* Acol with Multi 2: this variant of Acol makes use of the Multi 2 diamonds convention, where 2 shows a variety of hands including weak two bids in hearts and spades. The 2 bid is used as in standard Acol (23+ points). Various uses are made of the 2 and 2 bids, with traditional strong twos or Lucas twos being some popular methods.

== Standard Acol ==
The following is a brief summary of the Standard Acol as from 2000 to 2005. Standard Acol has not changed significantly since that time.

=== Opening bids ===
Opening bids promise at least 12 high card points (HCP), or the equivalent in HCP and shape, unless preempting. Apart from NT, opening bids guarantee the ability to make a rebid over any forcing response from partner. There are six &quot;special&quot; opening bids which are quite closely defined, and one wide-ranging opening bid:
* Special opening bids:
** 1NT — Shows a balanced hand (4-3-3-3, 4-4-3-2 or 5-3-3-2). Subject to partnership agreement, it may be either weak (12–14 HCP), strong (15–17 or 16–18 HCP) or variable (i.e., varying between weak and strong according to vulnerability). Limit bid. The weak NT is by far the most common practice among UK club and social players.
** 2 — Conventional game-forcing bid, promising game-going values (normally 23+ HCP) and at least 5 quick tricks. Game forcing unless responder replies 2 and opener rebids 2NT.
** 2 of any other suit — Strong two bid which shows a strong hand with at least eight playing tricks and a 6-card suit (or two 5-card suits). Forcing for one round.
** 2NT — Shows a balanced hand with 20–22 HCP. Limit bid.
** 3 of a suit — Preemptive, normally seven or more cards in the suit bid (may be six at favourable vulnerability), weak hand (not more than 10 HCP). Not forcing.
** 3NT — Preemptive, shows a long solid minor suit and is called the Gambling 3NT
* Wide-ranging opening bid (made if too strong to pass and unable to make one of the special opening bids):
** 1 of a suit — Promises a minimum of 12 HCP and a 4-card suit, 11 HCP and a 5-card suit, or 10 HCP and a 6-card suit. Not forcing.

The wide-ranging 1 of a suit bid is the most common opening bid, accounting for about 75–80% of opening bids. The 1NT opening occurs on about 20% of biddable hands if &quot;weak&quot;, or 10% if &quot;strong&quot;.

=== Responses to 1 of a suit ===
* Pass — less than 6 HCP
* 2 of opener&#x27;s suit — at least four-card support and 6–9 HCP. Limit bid.
* 3 of opener&#x27;s suit — at least four-card support and 10–12 HCP. Invites game if opener has requisite strength (14 HCP or more). Limit bid.
* 4 of opener&#x27;s suit — at least five-card support for opener&#x27;s major and 6–10 HCP, this is preemptive and to play.
* 1NT — 6–9 HCP, denies ability to bid at 2 level. Not necessarily balanced. Limit bid.
* 2NT — balanced, 10–12 HCP. Limit bid.
* 3NT — balanced, 13–15 HCP. Limit bid.
* 1 of a new suit — promises at least four cards in the suit bid, 6 HCP upwards. Forcing for one round.
* 2 of a new suit (below 2 of opener&#x27;s suit) — normally 5-card suit, at least a good 8 or 9 HCP. Forcing for one round
* Jump in a new suit — 5-card suit (or support for partner), at least 16 HCP, Game force.
&quot;Note 1: these last three bids may conceal 4-card support for opener&#x27;s suit, whereas the three NT responses deny 4-card support for opener, and also normally deny holding a 4 card major biddable at the 1 level&quot;

&quot;Note 2: when supporting opener&#x27;s suit with an 8-card fit or better, HCP ranges can be adjusted downwards slightly to allow for shortages (singletons or voids)&quot;

&quot;Note 3: with at least four-card support for opener&#x27;s major and 13+ HCP, bid a new suit and then jump to 4 of opener&#x27;s suit on the next round, a delayed game raise. Alternatively, by partnership agreement, the Jacoby 2NT or an alternative method may be used.&quot;

=== Responses to 1NT ===
The responses below assume a weak (12–14) NT opening: players should adjust the point ranges for responses if playing a different opening range. 
* 2 — Stayman. Opener responds 2 with no four-card major, 2 with a four-card heart suit and 2 with four spades (denies four hearts). Forcing for one round. 
* 2 of any other suit — weak takeout, opener must pass. Some players make use of transfers.
* 3 of a suit — shows a strong hand with a five-card suit, forcing to game.
* 2NT — 11–12 HCP. invites game if opener is maximum (i.e., for a weak opening NT, if opener has 14 or a good 13 HCP).
* 3NT — to play.
* 4 — asks for aces. (Gerber)
* 4, 4 — to play.
* 4NT — slam invitation, opener bids 6NT with a maximum.
* 5NT — slam invitation, opener bids 6NT unless a minimum. Note: some play as invitation to 7NT; opener bids 6NT if minimum, 7NT with a maximum.

=== Responses to 2NT ===
* 3 — Baron. Opener bids his lowest four-card suit. Forcing. (Stayman may also be used as in responses to 1NT; i.e., 3 shows no 4-card major).
* 3 of other suit - shows a five card suit, forcing to game. Some players use transfers.
* Other responses as over 1NT.

=== Responses to 2 ===
* 2 — negative. Responder lacks the strength for a positive response. Unless opener rebids 2NT (balanced, 23–24 HCP, which may be passed), the sequence is forcing to game.
* 2NT — fairly balanced, 8 or more HCP. Some players take this as showing a minor. Forcing to game.
* 2 of a suit — at least five in the suit, the equivalent of an ace and a king in high cards. Forcing to game.
* 3 of a suit — Solid suit of at least six cards. Forcing to game.

=== Responses to 2 of a suit (strong two) ===
* 2NT — negative. Responder lacks the strength for a positive response.
* Simple bid of a new suit — 8 or more HCP (or an Ace and a King), at least five in the suit. Forcing to game.
* 3 of opener&#x27;s suit — 5–8 HCP, at least 3-card support. Forcing to game.
* 3NT — flat hand, 8–11 HCP. Not forcing.

=== Opener&#x27;s suit rebid after one-level opening ===
Rebid own suit
* Rebid of own suit at lowest level – minimum hand, at least a five-card suit, 12–15 HCP, non-forcing.
* Jump rebid of own suit – strong hand, normally at least six-card suit, 15–19 HCP, non-forcing but highly invitational.

==== Bid new suit ====
* Bid of new suit at the same level as first suit — minimum hand, 12–15 HCP, first suit has at least as many cards as second suit, non-forcing.
* Bid of new suit at higher level than two of the first suit, but without jumping (a Reverse bid) — strong hand, 16–19 HCP, first suit has more cards (at least five) than second suit, forcing for one round.
* Jump in new suit — strong hand, about 19+ HCP over 1 level response or 16+ over 2 level response, first suit has at least as many cards as second suit, forcing to game.

==== Support for responder ====
* Simple raise of responder&#x27;s suit — minimum hand, 4-card support, 12–15 HCP, non-forcing
* Jump raise of responder&#x27;s suit — stronger hand, 4-card support, 16–18 HCP, non-forcing
* Jump to game in responder&#x27;s suit — game values, 4-card support, 19+ HCP, non-forcing

&quot;Note: when supporting responder&#x27;s suit with an 8-card fit or better, HCP ranges can be adjusted downwards slightly to allow for shortages (singletons or voids)&quot;

=== Opener&#x27;s NT rebid after one-level opening ===
The following bids assume a weak (12–14) NT opening.

==== After a suit response at one level ==== 
The traditional rebids are:
* 1NT — balanced, 15–16 HCP, limit bid
* 2NT — balanced, 17–18 HCP, limit bid
* 3NT — balanced, 19 HCP, limit bid

However, the modern approach modifies the ranges for the rebids thus:
* 1NT — balanced, 15–17 HCP, limit bid
* 2NT — balanced, 18–19 HCP, limit bid
* 3NT — Often an Acol two type of hand prepared to play in NT.

==== After a suit response at two level ==== 
The traditional rebids are:
* 2NT — balanced, 15–16 HCP, limit bid
* 3NT — balanced, 17–19 HCP, limit bid

The modern approach is to use the 2NT rebid as forcing to game with 15–19 points, allowing major suit fits to be found at the 3 level. 3NT may be used as 15–17 with support for the minor that responder has bid (one option).

After the opener&#x27;s 2NT rebid, 3 can be used as a (forcing) enquiry to seek definition of the 2NT rebid.

The only non-forcing bid by responder after opener&#x27;s 2NT rebid is a rebid of responder&#x27;s suit. This means that bidding opener&#x27;s first suit is unconditionally forcing.

=== Responder&#x27;s second bid ===

By the time responder has to rebid, it is often clear what the best final contract should be, especially if either player has made a limit bid. If opener has bid two suits, responder can show preference between them. With a strong hand but uncertain whether a game contract is on or which game it should be, he can use fourth suit forcing to obtain further information.

=== Fourth suit forcing ===

A bid of the fourth suit at the 2 level by responder is a one-round force, usually asking opener to bid no trumps with a stopper in the fourth suit. A fourth suit bid at the 3 level is similar, but forcing to game.

=== Overcalls and doubles ===
Suit overcalls promise at least 5 cards.

Jump overcalls promise at least 6 cards, but may be played as weak, intermediate or strong. BfA Acol uses intermediate (opening hand, 11–16 points).

1NT overcall typically promises 15–18 points and at least one stopper in opponents&#x27; suit.

Double is for takeout, showing an opening hand (12+ points) short in opponents&#x27; suit (occasionally a very strong hand, at least 16+ points, of other shapes)

=== Responses to 1 of a suit if opponents overcall ===
Generally similar to unopposed bidding, but with these differences:
* Double — negative or Sputnik double (up to 2, or often higher in modern methods), for takeout, usually showing at least 4 cards in any unbid major. But note that in earlier versions of Acol, this double was for penalties. 
* 1NT, 2NT and 3NT limit bids normally promise a stopper in opponents&#x27; suit. 
* 2 of a new suit (without a jump but above 2 of opener&#x27;s suit) — at least 5-card suit, at least a good 9 HCP. Forcing for one round.

==Alternatives==

In common usage, the term Acol is understood to refer to a four-card majors system. For hybrid systems using the weak NT opening with one or both five-card majors, a different terminology is preferable.

* Five card spades or 5-4-4-3 system; the 1 opening shows at least 5 spades, and a hand with 4 spades and 4-3-3-3 shape is opened 1. A 1 opening may be on only 3 cards. This can also be played so that the 1 opening either guarantees 5 hearts or 4 cards in both majors. In this case a 3-4-3-3 shape would also be opened 1.
* Five card majors with a weak NT; both 1 and 1 openings guarantee 5 cards. Sometimes known as the &quot;Third Way&quot; system; the first system of this type was the Kaplan–Sheinwold system. To handle 4-4-3-2 hands with both 4 card majors, this needs either a &quot;short club&quot; (1 can be as few as 2 cards) or both a prepared 1 and 1 which could be just 3 card suits. Five card majors are more commonly used with a strong no trump, as in Standard American.

<doc id="302644" wikidata="Q7316334" url="?curid=302644" title="Restrictiveness">
<text>In semantics, a modifier is said to be restrictive (or &quot;defining&quot;) if it restricts the reference of its head. For example, in &quot;the red car is fancier than the blue one&quot;, &quot;red&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; are restrictive, because they restrict which cars &quot;car&quot; and &quot;one&quot; are referring to. (&quot;The car is fancier than the one&quot; would make little sense.) By contrast, in &quot;John&#x27;s beautiful mother&quot;, &quot;beautiful&quot; is non-restrictive; &quot;John&#x27;s mother&quot; identifies her sufficiently, whereas &quot;beautiful&quot; only serves to add more information.

Restrictive modifiers are also called &quot;defining&quot;, &quot;identifying&quot;, &quot;essential&quot;, or &quot;necessary&quot;; non-restrictive ones are also called &quot;non-defining&quot;, &quot;non-identifying&quot;, &quot;descriptive&quot;, or &quot;unnecessary&quot; (though this last term can be misleading). In certain cases, generally when restrictiveness is marked syntactically through the lack of commas, restrictive modifiers are called &quot;integrated&quot; and non-restrictive ones are called &quot;non-integrated&quot; or &quot;supplementary&quot;.

==Restrictiveness in English==

English does not generally mark modifiers for restrictiveness, with the exception of relative clauses: non-restrictive ones are set off in speech through intonation (with a pause beforehand and ) and in writing by using commas, whereas restrictive clauses are not. Furthermore, although restrictive clauses can be headed by any of the relative pronouns &quot;who(m)&quot;, &quot;which&quot;, &quot;that&quot; or by a zero, non-restrictive clauses can only be headed by &quot;who(m)&quot; or &quot;which&quot;. For example:

*Restrictive: &quot;We saw two puppies this morning: one that was born yesterday and one that was born last week. The one that (&quot;or&quot; which) was born yesterday is tiny.&quot;
*Non-restrictive: &quot;We saw a puppy and a kitty this morning. The puppy, which was born yesterday, was tiny.&quot;

Although English does not consistently mark ordinary adjectives for restrictiveness, they can be marked periphrastically by moving them into relative clauses. For example, &quot;John&#x27;s beautiful wife&quot; can be rewritten as &quot;John&#x27;s wife, who is beautiful&quot;, to avoid the suggestion of disambiguation between John&#x27;s various wives. A sentence unmarked for restrictiveness, like &quot;The red car is fancier than the blue one,&quot; can—if necessary—be rephrased to make it explicitly restrictive or non-restrictive: 
*Restrictive: &quot;The car that&#x27;s red is fancier than the one that&#x27;s blue.&quot;
*Non-restrictive: &quot;The car, which is red, is fancier than the other, which is blue.&quot;

English speakers do not generally find such locutions necessary, however.

<text>Originalism is a legal theory that bases constitutional, judicial, and statutory interpretation of text on the original understanding at the time of its adoption. Proponents of the theory object to judicial activism and other interpretations related to a living constitution framework. Instead, originalists argue for democratic modifications of laws through the legislature or through constitutional amendment.

Originalism consists of a family of different theories of constitutional interpretation and can refer to original intent or original meaning. Critics of originalism often turn to the competing concept of the Living Constitution, which asserts that a constitution should evolve and be interpreted based on the context of current times. Originalism should not be confused with strict constructionism.

Contemporary originalism emerged during the 1980s and greatly influenced American legal culture, practice, and academia. Over time, originalism became more popular and gained mainstream acceptance by 2020.

== History ==
Proponents of originalism argue that originalism was the primary method of legal interpretation in America from the time of its founding until the time of the New Deal, when competing theories of interpretation grew in prominence.

=== Modern ===
Jurist Robert Bork is credited with proposing the first modern theory of originalism in his 1971 law review article, &quot;Neutral Principles and Some First Amendment Problems&quot;, published in &quot;The Yale Law Journal&quot;. He noted that without specification in a constitutional text, judges are free to input their own values while interpreting a constitution. Bork proposed one principled method to avoid this: for judges to &quot;take from the document rather specific values that text or history show the framers actually to have intended and which are capable of being translated into principled rules.&quot; By following the original meaning, an originalist Supreme Court would therefore &quot;need make no fundamental value choices,&quot; and its rulings would be restrained.

Law professor Raoul Berger expanded on the theory in &quot;Government by Judiciary&quot; (1977), positing that the rulings by the Warren and Burger Courts were illegitimate, as they deviated from the Constitution&#x27;s original intent. In 1985, Edwin Meese, United States Attorney General under President Ronald Reagan, advanced a constitutional jurisprudence based on original intent in a speech before the American Bar Association, a jurisprudence that &quot;would produce defensible principles of government that would not be tainted by ideological predilection.&quot; A few months after the speech, Justice William Brennan rejected Meese&#x27;s view, claiming that the original intent of the Founding Fathers of the United States was indiscernible, and that text could only be understood in present terms.

During the 1980s, liberal members of the legal academy criticized the original intent formulated by Bork, Berger, and Meese. Serious opposition, beginning in law schools, evolved from debates in singular law review articles to books. In 1980, Paul Brest, who later became the dean of Stanford Law School, published &quot;The Misconceived Quest for the Original Understanding,&quot; an article whose criticism of originalism proved formative and influential. Brest argued that a collective intent among the Founding Fathers of the United States was nonexistent and attempting to do so would be extremely difficult. He also posited that historical changes between the time of adoption to the present made originalism inapplicable in areas such as free speech, freedom of religion, federalism, and gender discrimination. Other scholars of the period adopted and expanded Brest&#x27;s critiques, including H. Jefferson Powell and Ronald Dworkin. Brest and Powell suggested versions of originalism that sought higher purposes than a specific framer&#x27;s intent, leading to a shift in the dominant form of originalism from original intent to the original public understanding.

The debate grew more heated with the failed Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork in 1986 with the 1990s seeing originalism becoming a broadly endorsed view in the conservative legal movement. The Department of Justice under the Ronald Reagan administration played an important role in lending legitimacy to originalism in the 1980s.

== Types ==
In May 2024, conservative justices on the Supreme Court are reported to be considering new alternative interpretations of originalism.

=== Original intent ===

The historical arguments made by Hugo Black in &quot;Everson v. Board of Education&quot; relied entirely on historical evidence of the views of Madison and Jefferson and the appropriateness of interpreting the Establishment Clause based on that evidence. Edwin Meese once remarked that Black&#x27;s record was evidence that &quot;jurisprudence of original intention is not some recent conservative ideological creation&quot;.

=== Original public understanding ===
Original public understanding originalism bases the meaning of a constitutional provision on how the public which ratified it would have generally understood it to mean. Antonin Scalia was one of its most prominent theorists.

The conservative originalist movement spearheaded by Raoul Berger in the 1980s was a call for judicial restraint but over the years important differences have developed among originalist scholars. Justice Amy Coney Barrett explains:

A faithful judge resists the temptation to conflate the meaning of the Constitution with the judge’s own political preference; judges who give into that temptation exceed the limits of their power by holding a statute unconstitutional when it is not. That was the heart of the originalist critique of the Warren and Burger Courts. At the same time, fidelity will inevitably require a court to hold some statutes unconstitutional.

Barrett, who has been described as a protégé of Scalia&#x27;s, said at her confirmation hearing that she interprets the Constitution &quot;as text, and I understand it to have the meaning that it had at the time people ratified it.&quot;

==Debate==

The originalism debate has divided the American public since the school desegregation decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. Justices Antonin Scalia, Amy Coney Barrett, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch describe themselves as originalists in scholarly writings and public speeches.

=== Critics ===

Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, a frequent critic of conservative originalism, argues that some aspects of the constitution were intentionally broad and vague to allow for future generations to interpret them along with the times.

Michael Waldman argues that originalism is a new concept, and not one espoused by the founders.

According to a 2021 paper in the &quot;Columbia Law Review&quot;, the Founding Fathers did not include a nondelegation doctrine in the Constitution and saw nothing wrong with delegations as a matter of legal theory, contrary to the claims of some originalists.

Columbia Law School legal scholar Jamal Greene argues that originalism is remarkably unpopular outside the United States (including Canada, South Africa, India, Israel, and most of Europe), where judicial minimalism or textualism are the recommended responses to judicial activism.

Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr. described originalism as &quot;arrogance cloaked as humility&quot; during a 1985 speech at Georgetown University. In this speech, he also stated “It is arrogant to pretend that from our vantage we can gauge accurately the intent of the framers&quot;, and that politicians that claim to do so are motivated purely by political reasons, as they “have no familiarity with the historical record.&quot;

Harvard Law School legal scholar Richard H. Fallon Jr. argues at length that the Supreme Court Justices who claim to be Originalists actually apply Originalism in a highly selective manner &quot;which typically abets substantively conservative decisionmaking.&quot;

==Related positions==
===International law and originalism===
Many Originalists reject any consideration of International law (with an exception for British law before 1791). Antonin Scalia wrote that &quot;We must never forget that it is a Constitution for the United States of America that we are expounding. . . . Where there is not first a settled consensus among our own people, the views of other nations, however enlightened the Justices of this Court may think them to be, cannot be imposed upon Americans through the Constitution.&quot;

===Strict constructionism===

Scalia differentiated the two by pointing out that, unlike an originalist, a strict constructionist would not acknowledge that &quot;he uses a cane&quot; means &quot;he walks with a cane&quot; (because, strictly speaking, this is not what &quot;he uses a cane&quot; means). Scalia averred that he was &quot;not a strict constructionist, and no-one ought to be&quot;; he goes further, calling strict constructionism &quot;a degraded form of textualism that brings the whole philosophy into disrepute&quot;.

Legal scholar Randy Barnett asserts that originalism is a theory of &quot;interpretation&quot; and that constructionism is only appropriate when deriving the original intent proves difficult.

===Declarationism===
Declarationism is a legal philosophy that incorporates the United States Declaration of Independence into the body of case law on level with the United States Constitution. It holds that the Declaration is a natural law document and so that natural law has a place within American jurisprudence. Harry V. Jaffa and Clarence Thomas have been cited as proponents of this school of thought.
