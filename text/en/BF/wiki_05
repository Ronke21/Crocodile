<text>The Confederate States Army (CSA), also called the Confederate Army or the Southern Army, was the military land force of the Confederate States of America (commonly referred to as the Confederacy) during the American Civil War (1861–1865), fighting against the United States forces to support the rebellion of the Southern states and uphold and expand the institution of slavery. On February 28, 1861, the Provisional Confederate Congress established a provisional volunteer army and gave control over military operations and authority for mustering state forces and volunteers to the newly chosen Confederate States president, Jefferson Davis (1808-1889). Davis was a graduate of the United States Military Academy, on the Hudson River at West Point, New York, and colonel of a volunteer regiment during the Mexican–American War (1846-1848). He had also been a United States senator from Mississippi and served as U.S. Secretary of War under 14th president Franklin Pierce. On March 1, 1861, on behalf of the new Confederate States government, Davis assumed control of the military situation at Charleston Harbor in Charleston, South Carolina, where South Carolina state militia had besieged the longtime Federal Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor, held by a small U.S. Army garrison under the command of Major Robert Anderson (1805-1871). By March 1861, the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States meeting in the temporary capital of Montgomery, Alabama, expanded the provisional military forces and established a more permanent regular Confederate States Army.

An accurate count of the total number of individuals who served in the Military forces of the Confederate States (Army, Navy and Marine Corps) is not possible due to incomplete and destroyed / burned Confederate records; and archives. Estimates of the number of Confederate soldiers, sailors and marines are between 750,000 and 1,000,000 troops. This does not include an unknown number of black slaves who were pressed into performing various tasks for the army, such as the construction of fortifications and defenses or driving wagons. Since these figures include estimates of the total number of soldiers who served at any time during the war, they do not represent the size of the army at any given date. These numbers also do not include sailors / marines who served in the Confederate States Navy.

Although most of the soldiers who fought in the American Civil War were volunteers, both sides by 1862 resorted to conscription as a means to supplement the volunteer soldiers. Although exact records are unavailable, estimates of the percentage of Confederate Army soldiers who were drafted are about double the 6 percent of Union Army soldiers who were drafted.

According to the National Park Service, &quot;Soldier demographics for the Confederate Army are not available due to incomplete and destroyed enlistment records.&quot; Their estimates of Confederate military personnel deaths are about 94,000 killed in battle, 164,000 deaths from disease, and 25,976 deaths in Union prison camps. One estimate of the total Confederate wounded is 194,026. In comparison, the best estimates of the number of Union military personnel deaths are 110,100 killed in battle, 224,580 deaths from disease, and 30,218 deaths in Confederate prison camps. The estimated figure for Union Army wounded is 275,174.

The main Confederate armies, the Army of Northern Virginia under General Robert E. Lee and the remnants of the Army of Tennessee and various other units under General Joseph E. Johnston, surrendered to the U.S. on April 9, 1865 (officially April 12), and April 18, 1865 (officially April 26). Other Confederate forces further south and west surrendered between April 16, 1865, and June 28, 1865. By the end of the war, more than 100,000 Confederate soldiers had deserted, and some estimates put the number as high as one-third of all Confederate soldiers. The Confederacy&#x27;s government effectively dissolved when it evacuated the four-year old capital of Richmond, Virginia, on April 3, 1865, and fled southwest by railroad train with President Jefferson Davis and members of his cabinet. It gradually continued moving southwestward first to Lynchburg, Virginia, and lost communication with its remaining military commanders, soon exerting no control over the remaining armies. They were eventually caught and captured near Irwinville, Georgia, a month later in May 1865.

==Prelude==
By the time Abraham Lincoln took office as President of the United States on March 4, 1861, the seven seceding slave states had formed the Confederate States. They seized federal property, including nearly all U.S. Army forts, within their borders. Lincoln was determined to hold the forts remaining under U.S. control when he took office, especially Fort Sumter in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina. On February 28, shortly before Lincoln was sworn in as president, the Provisional Confederate Congress had authorized the organization of a large Provisional Army of the Confederate States (PACS).

Under orders from Confederate President Jefferson Davis, C.S. troops under the command of General Pierre Gustave Toutant / P. G. T. Beauregard military forces surrounding the city harbor began bombarding bombarding Fort Sumter on April 12–13, 1861 and forced its capitulation on April 14. The remaining loyal United States in the North, outraged by the Confederacy&#x27;s attack, demanded war. It rallied behind new 16th President Lincoln&#x27;s call on April 15 for all the loyal states to send their state militia units avolunteer troops to reinforce and protect the national federal capital of Washington, D.C., to recapture the various forts, arsenals, shipyards and other seized federal installations from the secessionists, to put down and suppress the rebellion and to save the Union. Four more upper border slave states (North Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas and finally Virginia) then joined the Confederacy, making eleven seceded states rather than fight fellow Southerners. The Confederacy then moved its national capital from temporary Montgomery, Alabama to the state capital of Virginia in Richmond. Both the United States and the Confederate States began in earnest to raise large, mostly volunteer, armies, with the opposing objectives: putting down the rebellion and preserving the Union on the one hand, and establishing Southern independence from the northern United States on the other.

==Establishment==

The Confederate States Congress provided for a regular Confederate States Army, patterned after its parent in the United States Army (established 1775 / 1789). It was to consist of a large provisional force to exist only in time of war and a small permanent regular army. The provisional, volunteer army was established by an act of the Provisional Confederate Congress passed on February 28, 1861, one week before the act which established the permanent regular army organization, passed on March 6. Although the two forces were to exist concurrently, little was done to organize the Confederate regular army.
* The Provisional Army of the Confederate States (PACS) began organizing on April 27. Virtually all regular, volunteer, and conscripted men preferred to enter this organization since officers could achieve a higher rank in the Provisional Army than they could in the Regular Army. If the war had ended successfully for them, the Confederates intended that the PACS would be disbanded, leaving only the ACSA.
* The Army of the Confederate States of America (ACSA) was the regular army and was authorized to include 15,015 men, including 744 officers, but this level was never achieved. The men serving in the highest rank as Confederate States generals, such as Samuel Cooper and Robert E. Lee, were enrolled in the ACSA to ensure that they outranked all militia officers. ACSA ultimately existed only on paper. The organization of the ACSA did not proceed beyond the appointment and confirmation of some officers. Three state regiments were later denominated &quot;Confederate&quot; regiments, but this appears to have had no practical effect on the organization of a regular Confederate Army and no real effect on the regiments themselves.

Members of all the military forces of the Confederate States (the army, the navy, and the marine corps) are often referred to as &quot;Confederates&quot;, and members of the Confederate army were referred to as &quot;Confederate soldiers&quot;. Supplementing the Confederate army were the various state militias of the Confederacy:
* Confederate States State Militias were organized and commanded by the state governments, similar to those authorized by the United States&#x27; Militia Act of 1792. Some of these militia forces, in the early days of the Confederacy, had operated as stand alone military forces before being incorporated into the Confederate Army; one of the more well known was the Provisional Army of Virginia.

===Control and conscription===
Control and operation of the Confederate army were administered by the Confederate States War Department, which was established by the Confederate Provisional Congress in an act on February 21, 1861. The Confederate Congress gave control over military operations, and authority for mustering state forces and volunteers to the President of the Confederate States of America on February 28, 1861, and March 6, 1861. On March 8, the Confederate Congress passed a law that authorized President Davis to issue proclamations to call up no more than 100,000 men. The C.S. War Department asked for 8,000 volunteers on March 9, 20,000 on April 8, and 49,000 on and after April 16. Davis proposed an army of 100,000 soldiers in his message to Congress on April 29.

On August 8, 1861, the Confederacy called for 400,000 volunteers to serve for one or three years. Eight months later in April 1862, the Confederacy passed the first conscription law in either Confederate or Union history, the Conscription Act, which made all able bodied white men between the ages of 18 and 35 liable for a three-year term of service in the Provisional Army. It also extended the terms of enlistment for all one-year soldiers to three years. Men employed in certain occupations considered to be most valuable for the home front (such as railroad and river workers, civil officials, telegraph operators, miners, druggists and teachers) were exempt from the draft. The act was amended twice in 1862. On September 27, the maximum age of conscription was extended to 45. On October 11, the Confederate States Congress passed the so-called &quot;Twenty Negro Law&quot;, which exempted anyone who owned 20 or more slaves, a move that caused deep resentment among conscripts who did not own slaves.

The C.S. Congress enacted several more amendments throughout the war to address losses suffered in battle as well as the United States&#x27; greater supply of manpower. In December 1863, it abolished the previous practice of allowing a rich drafted man to hire a substitute to take his place in the ranks. Substitution had also been practiced in the United States, leading to similar resentment from the lower classes. In February 1864, the age limits were extended to between 17 and 50. Challenges to the subsequent acts came before five state supreme courts; all five upheld them.

==Morale and motivations==

In his 2010 book &quot;Major Problems in the Civil War&quot;, historian Michael Perman says that historians are of two minds on why millions of men seemed so eager to fight, suffer and die over four years:

Educated soldiers drew upon their knowledge of American history to justify their costs. Historian James M. McPherson says:

Before and during the Civil War, the popular press of Richmond, including its five major newspapers, sought to inspire a sense of patriotism, Confederate identity, and the moral high ground in the southern population.

===Religion===
The southern churches met the shortage of Army chaplains by sending missionaries. The Southern Baptists sent a total of 78 missionaries, starting in 1862. Presbyterians were even more active, with 112 missionaries sent in early 1865. Other missionaries were funded and supported by the Episcopalians, Methodists, and Lutherans. One result was wave after wave of religious revivals in the Army, religion playing a major part in the lives of Confederate soldiers. Some men with a weak religious affiliation became committed Christians, and saw their military service in terms of satisfying God&#x27;s wishes. Religion strengthened the soldiers&#x27; loyalty to their comrades and the Confederacy. Military historian Samuel J. Watson argues that Christian faith was a major factor in combat motivation. According to his analysis, the soldiers&#x27; faith was consoling for the loss of comrades; it was a shield against fear; it helped reduce drinking and fighting in the ranks; it enlarged the soldiers&#x27; community of close friends and helped compensate for their long-term separation from home.

===Slavery and white supremacism===
In his 1997 book &quot;For Cause and Comrades&quot;, which examines the motivations of the American Civil War&#x27;s soldiers, noted Princeton University war historian and author James M. McPherson (born 1936), contrasts the views of Confederate soldiers regarding slavery with those of the colonial American revolutionaries of the earlier 18th century. He stated that while the American rebel colonists of the 1770s saw an incongruity between owning slaves on the one hand, and proclaiming to be fighting for liberty on the other, the later Confederacy&#x27;s soldiers did not, as the Confederate ideology of white supremacy negated any contradiction between the two:

McPherson states that Confederate States Army soldiers did not discuss the issue of slavery as often as the opposing United States Army soldiers did, because most Confederate soldiers readily accepted as an obvious fact that they were fighting to perpetuate slavery and thus did not feel the need to debate over it:

Continuing, retired Professor McPherson also stated that of the hundreds of Confederate soldiers&#x27; letters he had examined, none of them contained any anti-slavery sentiment whatsoever:

McPherson admits some flaws in his sampling of letters. Soldiers from slaveholding families were overrepresented by 100%:

In some cases, Confederate men were motivated to join the army in response to the United States&#x27; actions regarding its opposition to slavery. After the U.S. President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1862-1863, some Confederate soldiers welcomed the move, as they believed it would strengthen pro-slavery sentiment in the Confederacy, and thus lead to greater enlistment of soldiers in the Confederate armies.

One Confederate soldier from the West in Texas gave his reasons for fighting for the Confederacy, stating that &quot;we are fighting for our property&quot;, contrasting this with the motivations of Union soldiers, who, he claimed, were fighting for the &quot;flimsy and abstract idea that a negro is equal to an Anglo American&quot;. One Louisianan artilleryman stated, &quot;I never want to see the day when a negro is put on an equality with a white person. There is too many free niggers ... now to suit me, let alone having four millions.&quot; A North Carolinian soldier stated, &quot;[A] white man is better than a nigger.&quot;

Decades later in 1894, Virginian and former famous Confederate cavalry leader, John S. Mosby (1833-1916), reflecting on his role in the war, stated in a letter to a friend that &quot;I&#x27;ve always understood that we went to war on account of the thing we quarreled with the North about. I&#x27;ve never heard of any other cause than slavery.&quot;
As stated by researcher / authors Andrew Hall, Connor Huff and Shiro Kuriwaki in the article &quot;Wealth, Slaveownership, and Fighting for the Confederacy: An Empirical Study of the American Civil War&quot;, research done using an 1862 Georgia lottery showed that rich white Southern men actually enlisted at a higher rate than poor men because they had more to lose. Slavery helped provide them with wealth and power, and they felt that the Civil War would destroy everything that they had if they lost because they saw slavery as the foundation of their wealth, which was under threat and caused them to fight hard.

===Desertion===

At many points during the war, and especially near the end, the Confederate armies were very poorly fed. At home their families were in worsening condition and faced starvation and the depredations of roving bands of marauders. Many soldiers went home temporarily (A.W.O.L. - &quot;Absent Without Official Leave&quot;) and quietly returned when their family problems had been resolved. By September 1864, however, President Davis publicly admitted that two-thirds of the soldiers were absent, &quot;most of them without leave&quot;. The problem escalated rapidly after that, and fewer and fewer men returned. Soldiers who were fighting in defense of their homes realized that they had to desert to fulfill that duty. Historian Mark Weitz argues that the official count of 103,400 deserters is too low. He concludes that most of the desertions came because the soldier felt he owed a higher duty to his own family than to the Confederacy.

Confederate policies regarding desertion generally were severe. For example, on August 19, 1862, famed General Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson (1824-1863), approved the court-martial sentence of execution for three soldiers for desertion, rejecting pleas for clemency from the soldiers&#x27; regimental commander. General Jackson&#x27;s goal was to maintain discipline in a volunteer army whose homes were under threat of enemy occupation.

Historians of the Civil War have emphasized how soldiers from poor families deserted because they were urgently needed at home. Local pressures mounted as Union forces occupied more and more Confederate territory, putting more and more families at risk of hardship. One Confederate Army officer at the time noted, &quot;The deserters belong almost entirely to the poorest class of non-slave-holders whose labor is indispensable to the daily support of their families&quot; and that &quot;When the father, husband or son is forced into the service, the suffering at home with them is inevitable. It is not in the nature of these men to remain quiet in the ranks under such circumstances.&quot;

Some soldiers also deserted from ideological motivations. A growing threat to the solidarity of the Confederacy was dissatisfaction in the Appalachian Mountains districts caused by lingering Unionism and a distrust of the power wielded by the slave-holding class. Many of their soldiers deserted, returned home, and formed a military force that fought off Regular Army units trying to capture and punish them. North Carolina lost nearly a quarter of its soldiers (24,122) to desertion. This was the highest rate of desertion of any Confederate state.

Young Samuel Clemens (1835-1910, later to be known as Mark Twain) soon deserted the Southern army long before he became a world-famous writer, journalist and lecturer, but he often commented upon that episode in his life comically, even writing a book about it. Author Neil Schmitz has examined the deep unease Twain felt about losing his honor, his fear of facing death as a soldier, and his rejection of a Southern identity as a professional author.

==Organization==
Because of the destruction of any central repository of records in the capital at Richmond in 1865 and the comparatively poor record-keeping of the time, there can be no definitive number that represents the strength of the Confederate States Army. Estimates range from 500,000 to 2,000,000 soldiers who were involved at any time during the war. Reports from the C.S. War Department beginning at the end of 1861 indicated 326,768 men that year, 449,439 in 1862, 464,646 in 1863, 400,787 in 1864, and &quot;last reports&quot; showed 358,692. Estimates of enlistments throughout the war range from 1,227,890 to 1,406,180.

The following calls for soldiers were issued:
* March 6, 1861: 100,000 volunteers and militia
* January 23, 1862: 400,000 volunteers and militia
* April 16, 1862, the First Conscription Act: passed by the Confederate States Congress conscripted white men ages 18 to 35 for the duration of hostilities
* September 27, 1862, the Second Conscription Act: expanded the age range to 18 to 45, with implementation beginning on July 15, 1863
* February 17, 1864, the Third Conscription Act: expanded further to ages 17 to 50
* March 13, 1865, authorized finally up to 300,000 African American slaves as troops but was never fully implemented.

The C.S.A. was initially a (strategically) defensive army, and many soldiers were resentful when General Robert E. Lee led his Army of Northern Virginia across the Potomac River in his first invasion of the North in the Antietam campaign in Maryland in September 1862.

===Command===

The Confederate States Army did not have a formal overall military commander, or general in chief, until late in the war. The Confederate President, Jefferson Davis, himself a former U.S. Army officer and U.S. Secretary of War, served as commander-in-chief and provided the overall strategic direction for Confederate land and naval forces in both eastern and western theaters. The following men had varying degrees of control:
* Robert E. Lee was &quot;charged with the conduct of military operations in the armies of the Confederacy&quot; from March 13 to May 31, 1862. He was referred to as President Davis&#x27; military adviser but exercised broad control over the strategic and logistical aspects of the Army, a role similar in nature to the current Chief of Staff of the United States Army (not developed until beginning in the early 20th century). On June 1, he assumed command of the Army of Northern Virginia, which was considered the most important of all the Confederate field armies.
* Braxton Bragg was similarly &quot;charged with the conduct of military operations in the armies of the Confederacy&quot; from February 24, 1864 (after he was relieved of field command following the Battle of Chattanooga) to January 31, 1865. This role was a military advisory position under Davis.
* Lee was formally designated General in Chief of the Armies of the Confederate States by an act of Congress (January 23, 1865) and served in this capacity from January 31 to April 9, 1865.

The lack of centralized control was a strategic weakness for the Confederacy, and there are only a few examples of its armies acting in concert across multiple theaters to achieve a common objective. One instance occurred in late 1862 with Lee&#x27;s invasion of Maryland, coincident with two other actions: Bragg&#x27;s invasion of Kentucky and Earl Van Dorn&#x27;s advance against Corinth, Mississippi. All three initiatives were unsuccessful, however. Georgia Governor Joseph E. Brown was an extreme case of a Southern States Rights advocate asserting control over Confederate soldiers: he defied the Confederate government&#x27;s wartime policies and resisted the military draft. Believing that local troops should be used only for the defense of Georgia, Brown tried to stop Colonel Francis Bartow from taking Georgia troops out of the state to the First Battle of Bull Run.

Many of the Confederacy&#x27;s senior military leaders (including Robert E. Lee, Albert Sidney Johnston, and James Longstreet) and even President Jefferson Davis, were former U.S. Army and, in smaller numbers, U.S. Navy officers who had been opposed to, disapproved of, or were at least unenthusiastic about secession, but resigned their U.S. commissions upon hearing that their states had left the Union. They felt that they had no choice but to help defend their homes. President Abraham Lincoln was exasperated to hear of such men who professed to love their country but were willing to fight against it.

===Personnel organization===
As in the U.S. Army, the Confederate Army&#x27;s soldiers were organized by military specialty. The combat arms included infantry, cavalry, and artillery.

Although fewer soldiers might comprise a squad or platoon, the smallest infantry maneuver unit in the Army was a company of 100 soldiers. Ten companies were organized into an infantry regiment, which theoretically had 1,000 men. In reality, as disease, desertions and casualties took their toll, and the common practice of sending replacements to form new regiments took hold, most regiments were greatly reduced in strength. By the mid-war, most regiments averaged 300–400 men, with Confederate units slightly smaller on average than their U.S. counterparts. For example, at the pivotal Battle of Chancellorsville, the average U.S. Army infantry regiment&#x27;s strength was 433 men, versus 409 for Confederate infantry regiments.

Rough unit sizes for CSA combat units during the war:
* Corps - 24,000 to 28,000
* Division - 6,000 to 14,000
* Brigade - 800 to 1,700
* Regiment - 350 to 400
* Company – 35 to 40

Regiments, which were the basic units of army organization through which soldiers were supplied and deployed, were raised by individual states. They were generally referred by number and state, for example 1st Texas, 12th Virginia. To the extent the word &quot;battalion&quot; was used to describe a military unit, it referred to a multi-company task force of a regiment or a near-regimental size unit. Throughout the war, the Confederacy raised the equivalent of 1,010 regiments in all branches, including militias, versus 2,050 regiments for the U.S. Army.

Four regiments usually formed a brigade, although as the number of soldiers in many regiments became greatly reduced, especially later in the war, more than four were often assigned to a brigade. Occasionally, regiments would be transferred between brigades. Two to four brigades usually formed a division. Two to four divisions usually formed a corps. Two to four corps usually formed an army. Occasionally, a single corps might operate independently as if it were a small army. The Confederate States Army consisted of several field armies, named after their primary area of operation. The largest Confederate field army was the Army of Northern Virginia, whose surrender at Appomattox Courthouse in 1865 marked the end of major combat operations in the U.S. Civil War.

Companies were commanded by captains and had two or more lieutenants. Regiments were commanded by colonels. Lieutenant colonels were second in command. At least one major was next in command. Brigades were commanded by brigadier generals although casualties or other attrition sometimes meant that brigades would be commanded by senior colonels or even a lower grade officer. Barring the same type of circumstances that might leave a lower grade officer in temporary command, divisions were commanded by major generals and corps were commanded by lieutenant generals. A few corps commanders were never confirmed as lieutenant generals and exercised corps command for varying periods as major generals. Armies of more than one corps were commanded by (full) generals.

===Ranks and insignia===


There were four grades of general officer (general, lieutenant general, major general, and brigadier general), but all wore the same insignia regardless of grade. This was a decision made early in the conflict. The Confederate Congress initially made the rank of brigadier general the highest rank. As the war progressed, the other general-officer ranks were quickly added, but no insignia for them was created. (Robert E. Lee was a notable exception to this. He chose to wear the rank insignia of a colonel.) Only seven men achieved the rank of (full) general; the highest-ranking (earliest date of rank) was Samuel Cooper, Adjutant General and Inspector General of the Confederate States Army.

Officers&#x27; uniforms bore a braided design on the sleeves and kepi, the number of adjacent strips (and therefore the width of the lines of the design) denoting rank. The color of the piping and kepi denoted the military branch. The braid was sometimes left off by officers since it made them conspicuous targets. The kepi was rarely used, the common slouch hat being preferred for its practicality in the Southern climate.

Branch colors were used for the color of chevrons—blue for infantry, yellow for cavalry, and red for artillery. This could differ with some units, however, depending on available resources or the unit commander&#x27;s desire. Cavalry regiments from Texas, for example, often used red insignia and at least one Texas infantry regiment used black.

The CSA differed from many contemporaneous armies in that all officers under the rank of brigadier general were elected by the soldiers under their command. The Confederate Congress authorized the awarding of medals for courage and good conduct on October 13, 1862, but wartime difficulties prevented the procurement of the needed medals. To avoid postponing recognition for their valor, those nominated for the awards had their names placed on a Roll of Honor, which would be read at the first dress parade after its receipt and be published in at least one newspaper in each state.

===Armies and prominent leaders===
The C.S. Army was composed of independent armies and military departments that were constituted, renamed, and disbanded as needs arose, particularly in reaction to offensives launched by the United States. These major units were generally named after states or geographic regions (in comparison to the U.S. Army&#x27;s custom of naming armies after rivers). Armies were usually commanded by full generals (there were seven in the C.S. Army) or lieutenant generals. Some of the more important armies and their commanders were:
* Army of Central Kentucky – Simon B. Buckner, Albert Sidney Johnston
* Army of East Tennessee – Edmund Kirby Smith (later renamed Army of Kentucky)
* Army of Eastern Kentucky – Humphrey Marshall
* Army of the Kanawha – Henry A. Wise, John B. Floyd, Robert E. Lee
* Army of Kentucky – Edmund Kirby Smith (eventually commander of all forces West of the Mississippi)
* Army of Louisiana – Braxton Bragg. Paul O. Hébert
* Army of Mississippi
** March 1862 – November 1862: P. G. T. Beauregard, Albert Sidney Johnston, Braxton Bragg, William J. Hardee, Leonidas Polk, (also known as the Army of the Mississippi; redesignated Army of Tennessee on November 20, 1862)
** December 1862 – July 1863: John C. Pemberton, Earl Van Dorn, (1863) William W. Loring (also known as Army of Vicksburg)
** July 1863 – June 1864: William J. Hardee, Leonidas Polk, William W. Loring (also known as the Army of the Mississippi; redesignated III Corps, Army of Tennessee in May 1864, but continued to use its old name)
* Army of Middle Tennessee – John C. Breckinridge
* Army of Missouri – Sterling Price
* Army of Mobile – Jones M. Withers, Braxton Bragg, John B. Villepigue, Samuel Jones, William L. Powell, John H. Forney
* Army of New Mexico – Henry H. Sibley
* Army of Northern Virginia – Joseph E. Johnston, Gustavus W. Smith, Robert E. Lee
** First Corps, Army of Northern Virginia
** Second Corps, Army of Northern Virginia
** Third Corps, Army of Northern Virginia
** Fourth Corps, Army of Northern Virginia, often styled &quot;Anderson&#x27;s Corps&quot;
** Cavalry Corps, Army of Northern Virginia
* Army of the New River – Henry Heth
* Army of the Northwest – Robert S. Garnett, Henry R. Jackson, William W. Loring, Edward Johnson
* Army of the Peninsula – John B. Magruder, Daniel H. Hill
* Army of Pensacola – Adley H. Gladden, Braxton Bragg, Samuel Jones
* Army of the Potomac – P. G. T. Beauregard, Joseph E. Johnston
* Army of the Shenandoah – Joseph E. Johnston
* Army of Tennessee – Braxton Bragg, Samuel Gibbs French, William J. Hardee, Daniel H. Hill, John Bell Hood, Joseph E. Johnston, Richard Taylor
** First Corps, Army of Tennessee
** Second Corps, Army of Tennessee
** Third Corps, Army of Tennessee
** Forrest&#x27;s Cavalry Corps – Nathan Bedford Forrest
* Army of the Trans-Mississippi – Thomas C. Hindman, Theophilus Holmes, Edmund Kirby Smith (also known as the Army of the Southwest)
* Army of the Valley (also known as Second Corps, Army of Northern Virginia) – Jubal Early
* Army of the West – Earl van Dorn, John P. McCown, Dabney H. Maury, Sterling Price
* Army of West Tennessee – Earl Van Dorn
* Army of Western Louisiana – Richard Taylor, John G. Walker

Some other prominent Confederate generals who led significant units operating sometimes independently in the CSA included Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson, James Longstreet, J. E. B. Stuart, Gideon Pillow, A. P. Hill, John B. Gordon.

===Military departments===

In addition to the Confederate field armies, the Confederate States itself was divided into several military territorial organizations, known as departments. These departments were mainly administrative in nature, organizing recruiting, supply distribution, and coordinating with the field armies in the event of Union invasions. The military departments were also the ultimate authority for all Confederate forts within their region, as well as commanding all garrison forces and units of the Confederate Home Guard

Unlike the Union, which had fairly stable military departments through most of the Civil War, Confederate departments were constantly being formed, reformed, and renamed as the war progressed. The original two departments, formed at the beginning of the Civil War, were &quot;Department No 1&quot; (later incorporated into the Department of Louisiana) and &quot;Department No 2&quot; (later becoming the Western Department).

In Virginia, where hostilities broke out almost immediately after the start of the war, the &quot;Alexandria line&quot; was established as the first Confederate administrative body in this area. This was later expanded to formal military departments in the following order:

* Department of Alexandria
* Department of the Potomac
* Department of Northern Virginia

Virginia also maintained the following smaller departments which fluctuated as the war progressed:

* Department of Norfolk
* Department of Fredericksburg
* Department of Richmond (operated in tandem with the Department of Henrico)
* Department of Southwestern Virginia
* Department of the Peninsula

In the Shenandoah Valley, the first Confederate administrative command was set up at Harper&#x27;s Ferry, later becoming the Valley District, directly subordinate to the Army of the Shenandoah. The Shenandoah Valley was without a department for most of the war, militarily controlled by Army of the Northwest and the Army of the Valley, before finally being declared the Trans-Allegheny Department. Elsewhere in the Confederacy, the following major departments were formed which operated throughout most of the war:

* Department of Louisiana
* Department of Tennessee
* Department of North Carolina
* Department of South Carolina
* Department of Georgia

The Union attack on Vicksburg, Mississippi also brought about a succession of departments known as:

* Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana
* Department of Alabama and East Mississippi 
* Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and Eastern Louisiana

The entire Mississippi region was eventually merged into the Trans-Mississippi Department, one of the largest departments of the war. At the same time, departments were being formed further west as the:

* Western Department
* Department of Texas
* Department of the Indian Territory

Battles in Tennessee, and shifting fronts in that region, also brought about the need for new departments in that region, most of which reported directly to the Army of Tennessee under John Bell Hood. Hood would directly command the following three departments at the same time as his service as an Army commander:

* Department of East Tennessee
* Department of East Tennessee and West Virginia
* Department of Tennessee and Georgia

In 1864, Robert E. Lee held the idea for &quot;super theaters&quot; encompassing vast areas of the south, as follows:

* Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia (expansion of the Department of Southern Virginia)
* Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and East Florida
* Department of South Carolina and Georgia (later expanded to the Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida

Lesser departments, without much combat activity, were:

* Department of West Florida
* Department of Alabama and West Florida (expansion of the District of Alabama)
* Department of Middle and Eastern Florida
* Department of Western Kentucky

==Supply and logistics==

The supply situation for most Confederate armies was dismal, even when they were victorious on the battlefield. The central Confederate government was short of money so each state government had to supply its regiments. The lack of central authority and the ineffective railroads, combined with the frequent unwillingness or inability of Southern state governments to provide adequate funding, were key factors in the Confederate army&#x27;s demise. The Confederacy early on lost control of most of its major river and ocean ports to capture or blockade. The road system was poor, and it relied more and more on a heavily overburdened railroad system. U.S. forces destroyed track, engines, cars, bridges and telegraph lines as often as possible, knowing that new equipment was unavailable to the Confederacy. Occasional raids into the North were designed to bring back money and supplies. In 1864, the Confederates burned down Chambersburg, a Pennsylvania city they had raided twice in the years before, due to its failure to pay an extortion demand.

As a result of severe supply problems, as well as the lack of textile factories in the Confederacy and the successful U.S. naval blockade of Southern ports, the typical Confederate soldier was rarely able to wear the standard regulation uniform, particularly as the war progressed. While on the march or in parade formation, Confederate armies often displayed a wide array of dress, ranging from faded, patched-together regulation uniforms; rough, homespun uniforms colored with homemade dyes such as butternut (a yellow-brown color), and even soldiers in a hodgepodge of civilian clothing. After a successful battle, it was not unusual for victorious Confederate troops to procure U.S. Army uniform parts from captured supplies and dead U.S. soldiers; this would occasionally cause confusion in later battles and skirmishes.

Individual states were expected to supply their soldiers, which led to a lack of uniformity. Some states (such as North Carolina) were able to better supply their soldiers, while other states (such as Texas) were unable for various reasons to adequately supply their troops as the war continued.

Furthermore, each state often had its uniform regulations and insignia, which meant that the &quot;standard&quot; Confederate uniform often featured a variety of differences based on the state the soldier came from. For example, uniforms for North Carolina regiments often featured a colored strip of cloth on their shoulders to designate what part of the service the soldier was in. Confederate soldiers also frequently suffered from inadequate supplies of shoes, tents, and other gear, and would be forced to innovate and make do with whatever they could scrounge from the local countryside. While Confederate officers were generally better-supplied and were normally able to wear a regulation officer&#x27;s uniform, they often chose to share other hardships – such as the lack of adequate food – with their troops.

Confederate soldiers were also faced with inadequate food rations, especially as the war progressed. There was plenty of meat in the Confederacy. The unsolvable problem was shipping it to the armies, especially when Lee&#x27;s army in Virginia was at the end of a long, tenuous supply line. The United States victory at Vicksburg in 1863 shut off supplies from Texas and the west.

By 1863, Confederate generals such as Robert E. Lee often spent as much time and effort searching for food for their men, as they did in planning strategy and tactics. Individual commanders often had to &quot;beg, borrow or steal&quot; food and ammunition from whatever sources were available, including captured U.S. depots and encampments, and private citizens regardless of their loyalties. Lee&#x27;s campaign against Gettysburg and southern Pennsylvania (a rich agricultural region) was driven in part by his desperate need of supplies, especially food.

General Sherman&#x27;s total warfare reduced the ability of the South to produce food and ship it to the armies or its cities. Coupled with the U.S. blockade of all ports the devastation of plantations, farms and railroads meant the Confederacy increasingly lost the capacity to feed its soldiers and civilians.

===Arms importation===

The Confederate government had some success in importing weapons from Britain. When the War began, the Confederacy lacked the financial and manufacturing capacity to wage war against the industrialized North. In order to increase its arsenal, the Confederacy looked to Britain as a major source of arms. British merchants and bankers funded the purchase of arms and construction of ships being outfitted as blockade runners which later carried war supplies bound for Southern ports. A British publication in 1862 summed up the country&#x27;s involvement in blockade running:
Score after score of the finest, swiftest British steamers and ships, loaded with British material of war of every description, cannon, rifles by the hundreds of thousand, powder by the thousand of tons, shot, shell, cartridges, swords, etc, with cargo after cargo of clothes, boots, shoes, blankets, medicines and supplies of every kind, all paid for by British money, at the sole risk of British adventurers, well insured by Lloyds and under the protection of the British flag, have been sent across the ocean to the insurgents by British agency.
It was estimated the Confederate Army received thousands of tons of gunpowder, half a million rifles, and several hundred cannons from British blockade runners.

Ulysses S. Grant III, President of the American Civil War Centennial in 1961, remarked for example:
[B]etween October 26, 1864 and January 1865, it was still possible for 8,632,000 lbs of meat, 1,507,000 lbs of lead, 1,933,000 lbs of saltpeter, 546,000 pairs of shoes, 316,000 blankets, half a million pounds of coffee, 69,000 rifles, and 43 cannon to run the blockade into the port of Wilmington alone, while cotton sufficient to pay for these purchases was exported[. I]t is evident that the blockade runners made an important contribution to the Confederate effort to carry on.
==Italian Americans and the Confederate Army==
Many Italian American soldiers of the Confederate States Army were veterans from the Army of the Two Sicilies who had fought against Giuseppe Garibaldi in, and were captured during, the Expedition of the Thousand as part of the unification of Italy. They were released after a treaty between Garibaldi and Chatham Roberdeau Wheat. In December 1860 and few months of 1861, these volunteers were transported to New Orleans with the ships &quot;Elisabetta&quot;, &quot;Olyphant&quot;, &quot;Utile&quot;, &quot;Charles &amp; Jane&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot; and &quot;Franklin&quot;. Most Confederate Italian Americans had settled in Louisiana. The militia of Louisiana had an Italian Guards Battalion that became part of its 6th Regiment. Following the protests of many soldiers, who did not feel like Italian citizens since they fought against the unification of Italy, it was renamed &quot;6th Regiment, European Brigade&quot; in 1862.

==Native Americans and the Confederate Army==

Native Americans served in both the United States and Confederate military during the American Civil War. They fought knowing they might jeopardize their freedom, unique cultures, and ancestral lands if they ended up on the losing side of the Civil War. During the Civil War, 28,693 Native Americans served in the U.S. and Confederate armies, participating in battles such as Pea Ridge, Second Manassas, Antietam, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor, and in Federal assaults on Petersburg. Many Native American tribes, such as the Creek, the Cherokee, and the Choctaw, were slaveholders themselves, and thus, found a political and economic commonality with the Confederacy.

At the beginning of the war, Albert Pike was appointed as Confederate envoy to Native Americans. In this capacity he negotiated several treaties, one such treaty was the Treaty with Choctaws and Chickasaws conducted in July 1861. The treaty covered sixty-four terms covering many subjects like Choctaw and Chickasaw nation sovereignty, Confederate States of America citizenship possibilities, and an entitled delegate in the House of Representatives of the Confederate States of America. The Cherokee, Choctaw, Seminole, Catawba, and Creek tribes were the only tribes to fight on the Confederate side. The Confederacy wanted to recruit Indians east of the Mississippi River in 1862, so they opened up a recruiting camp in Mobile, Alabama &quot;at the foot of Stone Street&quot;. The &quot;Mobile Advertiser and Register&quot; would advertise for a chance at military service.

=== Cherokee ===

Stand Watie, along with a few Cherokee, sided with the Confederate army, in which he was made colonel and commanded a battalion of Cherokee. Reluctantly, on October 7, 1861, Chief Ross signed a treaty transferring all obligations due to the Cherokee from the United States to the Confederate States. The Cherokee were guaranteed protection, rations of food, livestock, tools, and other goods, as well as a delegate to the Confederate Congress at Richmond.

In exchange, the Cherokee would furnish ten companies of mounted men, and allow the construction of military posts and roads within the Cherokee Nation. However, no Indian regiment was to be called on to fight outside Indian Territory. As a result of the Treaty, the 2nd Cherokee Mounted Rifles, led by Col. John Drew, was formed. Following the Battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas, March 7–8, 1862, Drew&#x27;s Mounted Rifles defected to the United States forces in Kansas, where they joined the Indian Home Guard. In the summer of 1862, U.S. troops captured Chief Ross, who was paroled and spent the remainder of the war in Washington and Philadelphia proclaiming Cherokee loyalty to the United States Army.

William Holland Thomas, the adopted white son of the chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, recruited hundreds of Cherokees for the Confederate army, particularly for Thomas&#x27; Legion. The Legion, raised in September 1862, fought until the end of the War.

===Choctaw===
Choctaw Confederate battalions were formed in Indian Territory and later in Mississippi in support of the southern cause. The Choctaws, who were expecting support from the Confederates, got little. Webb Garrison, a Civil War historian, describes their response: when Confederate Brigadier General Albert Pike authorized the raising of regiments during the fall of 1860, Seminoles, Creeks, Chickasaws, Choctaws, and Cherokees responded with considerable enthusiasm. Their zeal for the Confederate cause, however, began to evaporate when they found that neither arms nor pay had been arranged for them. A disgusted officer later acknowledged that &quot;with the exception of a partial supply for the Choctaw regiment, no tents, clothing, or camp, and garrison equipage was furnished to any of them.&quot;

==African Americans and the Confederate Army==


With so many white males conscripted into the army and roughly 40% of its population unfree, the work required to maintain a functioning society in the Confederacy ended up largely on the backs of slaves. Even Georgian governor Joseph E. Brown noted that &quot;the country and the army are mainly dependent upon slave labor for support.&quot; African American slave labor was used in a wide variety of logistical support roles for the Confederacy, from infrastructure and mining, to teamster and medical roles such as hospital attendants and nurses.

===Using enslaved soldiers===

The Confederacy did not allow African Americans to join the army, neither free people nor slaves. The idea of arming the Confederacy&#x27;s slaves for use as soldiers was speculated on from the onset of the war, but such proposals were not seriously considered by Jefferson Davis or others in the Confederate administration until late in the war when severe manpower shortages were faced. Gary Gallagher says, &quot;When Lee publicly advocated arming slaves in early 1865, he did so as a desperate expedient that might prolong Southern military resistance.&quot; After acrimonious debate the Confederate Congress agreed in March 1865. The war was nearly over by then, and only about two hundred enslaved soldiers ended up being enlisted before the Confederate armies all surrendered.

====Opposition from Confederates====
As early as November 1864, some Confederates knew that the chance of securing victory against the U.S. was slim. Despite lacking foreign assistance and recognition and facing slim chances of victory against superior U.S. assets, Confederate newspapers such as the Georgian &quot;Atlanta Southern Confederacy&quot; continued to maintain their position and oppose the idea of armed black men in the Confederate Army, even as late in the war as January 1865. They stated that it was incongruous with the Confederacy&#x27;s goals and views regarding African Americans and slavery. The Georgian newspaper opined that using black men as soldiers would be an embarrassment to Confederates and their children, saying that although African Americans should be used for slave labor, they should not be used as armed soldiers, opining that:
Prominent Confederates such as R. M. T. Hunter and Georgian Democrat Howell Cobb opposed arming slaves, saying that it was &quot;suicidal&quot; and would run contrary to the Confederacy&#x27;s ideology. Opposing such a move, Cobb stated that African Americans were untrustworthy and innately lacked the qualities to make good soldiers, and that using them would cause many Confederates to quit the army. Cobb said using blacks as soldiers would be the end of the revolution, because &quot;if slaves make good soldiers, our whole theory of slavery is wrong.&quot;

The overwhelming support most Confederates had for maintaining black slavery was the primary cause of their strong opposition to using African Americans as armed soldiers. Former Confederate secretary of state Robert Toombs said &quot;In my opinion, the worst calamity that could befall us would be to gain our independence by the valor of our slaves... instead of our own... &quot; and complained using black troops would be &quot;a surrender of the entire slavery question.&quot; Maintaining the institution of slavery was the primary goal of the Confederacy&#x27;s existence, and thus, using their slaves as soldiers was incongruous with that goal. According to historian Paul D. Escott:

Though most Confederates were opposed to the idea of using black soldiers, a small number suggested the idea. An acrimonious and controversial debate was raised by a letter from Patrick Cleburne urging the Confederacy to raise black soldiers by offering emancipation; Jefferson Davis refused to consider the proposal and issued instructions forbidding the matter from being discussed. It would not be until Robert E. Lee wrote the Confederate Congress urging them that the idea would take serious traction.

On March 13, 1865, the Confederate Congress passed General Order 14 by a single vote in the Confederate senate, and Jefferson Davis signed the order into law. The order was issued March 23, but as it was late in the war, only a few African American companies were raised in the Richmond area before the town was captured by the U.S. Army and placed back under U.S. control.
According to historian James M. McPherson in 1994, &quot;no black soldiers fought in the Confederate army, unless they were passing as white. He noted that some Confederates brought along &quot;their body servants, who in many cases had grown up with them&quot; and that &quot;on occasion some of those body servants were known to have picked up a rifle and fought. But there was no official recruitment of black soldiers in the Confederate army until the very end of the war...&quot; He continued, &quot;But Appomattox came only a few weeks later, and none of these men were ever put in uniform to fight.&quot;

===Treatment of black civilians===
In some cases, the Confederates forced their African American slaves to fire upon U.S. soldiers at gunpoint, such as at the First Battle of Bull Run. According to John Parker, a slave who was forced by the Confederates to fight Union soldiers, &quot;Our masters tried all they could to make us fight ... They promised to give us our freedom and money besides, but none of us believed them; we only fought because we had to.&quot; Parker stated that had he been given an opportunity, he would have turned against his Confederate captors, and &quot;could do it with pleasure&quot;. According to abolitionist Henry Highland Garnet in 1862, he had met a slave who &quot;had unwillingly fought on the side of Rebellion&quot;, but the slave had since defected to &quot;the side of Union and universal liberty&quot;.

During the siege of Yorktown, The United States Army&#x27;s elite sniper unit, the 1st United States Sharpshooters, was devastatingly effective at shooting Confederate artillerymen defending the city. In response, some Confederate artillery crews started forcing slaves to load the cannons. &quot;They forced their negroes to load their cannon,&quot; reported a U.S. officer. &quot;They shot them if they would not load the cannon, and we shot them if they did.&quot;

In other cases, under explicit orders from their commanders, Confederate armies would often forcibly kidnap free African American civilians during their incursions into Union territory, sending them south into Confederate territory and thus enslaving them, as was the case with the Army of Northern Virginia when it invaded Pennsylvania in 1863.

===Treatment of black prisoners of war===
The usage of black men as soldiers by the Union, combined with Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation, profoundly angered the Confederacy, with the Confederates calling it uncivilized. As a response, in May 1863, the Confederacy passed a law demanding &quot;full and ample retaliation&quot; against the United States, stating that any black person captured in &quot;arms against the Confederate States&quot; or giving aid and comfort to their enemies would be turned over to state authorities, where they could be tried as slave insurrectionists; a capital offense punishable with a sentence of death. However, Confederate authorities feared retaliation, and consequently no black prisoner was ever put on trial and executed.

James McPherson states that &quot;Confederate troops sometimes murdered black soldiers and their officers as they tried to surrender. In most cases, though, Confederate officers returned captured black soldiers to slavery or put them to hard labor on southern fortifications.&quot;
African American soldiers who served in the United States Colored Troops were often singled out by the Confederates and suffered extra violence when captured by them. They were often the victims of battlefield massacres and atrocities at the hands of the Confederates, most notably at Fort Pillow in Tennessee and at the Battle of the Crater in Virginia.

====Prisoner exchanges with the United States====
The Confederate law declaring black U.S. soldiers to be insurrectionist slaves, combined with the Confederacy&#x27;s discriminatory mistreatment of captured black U.S. soldiers, became a stumbling block for prisoner exchanges between the United States and the Confederacy, as the U.S. government in the Lieber Code officially objected to the Confederacy&#x27;s discriminatory mistreatment of prisoners of war on basis of color. The Republican Party&#x27;s platform of the 1864 presidential election reflected this view, as it too condemned the Confederacy&#x27;s discriminatory mistreatment of captured black U.S. soldiers. According to the authors of &quot;Liberty, Equality, Power&quot;, &quot;Expressing outrage at this treatment, in 1863 the Lincoln administration suspended the exchange of prisoners until the Confederacy agree to treat white and black prisoners alike. The Confederacy refused.&quot;

==Statistics and size==
Incomplete and destroyed records make an accurate count of the number of soldiers who served in the Confederate army impossible. Historians provide estimates of the actual number of individual Confederate soldiers between 750,000 and 1,000,000 troops.

The exact number is unknown. Since these figures include estimates of the total number of individual soldiers who served in each army at any time during the war, they do not represent the size of the armies at any given date. Confederate casualty figures are as incomplete and unreliable as the figures on the number of Confederate soldiers. The best estimates of the number of deaths of Confederate soldiers appear to be about 94,000 killed or mortally wounded in battle, 164,000 deaths from disease and between 26,000 and 31,000 deaths in Union prison camps. In contrast, about 25,000 Union soldiers died as a result of accidents, drowning, murder, killed after capture, suicide, execution for various crimes, execution by the Confederates (64), sunstroke, other and not stated. Confederate casualties for all these reasons are unavailable. Since some Confederate soldiers would have died for these reasons, more total deaths and total casualties for the Confederacy must have occurred. One estimate of the Confederate wounded, which is considered incomplete, is 194,026; another is 226,000. At the end of the war 174,223 men of the Confederate forces surrendered to the Union Army.

Compared to the Union Army at the time, the Confederate Army was not very ethnically diverse. Ninety-one percent of Confederate soldiers were native-born white men and only nine percent were foreign-born white men, Irishmen being the largest group with others including Germans, French, Mexicans, and British. A small number of Asian men were forcibly inducted into the Confederate Army against their will, when they arrived in Louisiana from overseas.

<doc id="293725" wikidata="Q1054513" url="?curid=293725" title="E6 (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, E6 is the name of some closely related Lie groups, linear algebraic groups or their Lie algebras formula_1, all of which have dimension 78; the same notation E6 is used for the corresponding root lattice, which has rank 6. The designation E6 comes from the Cartan–Killing classification of the complex simple Lie algebras (see ). This classifies Lie algebras into four infinite series labeled A&quot;n&quot;, B&quot;n&quot;, C&quot;n&quot;, D&quot;n&quot;, and five exceptional cases labeled E6, E7, E8, F4, and G2. The E6 algebra is thus one of the five exceptional cases.

The fundamental group of the adjoint form of E6 (as a complex or compact Lie group) is the cyclic group Z/3Z, and its outer automorphism group is the cyclic group Z/2Z. For the simply-connected form, its fundamental representation is 27-dimensional, and a basis is given by the 27 lines on a cubic surface. The dual representation, which is inequivalent, is also 27-dimensional.

In particle physics, E6 plays a role in some grand unified theories.

== Real and complex forms ==
There is a unique complex Lie algebra of type E6, corresponding to a complex group of complex dimension 78. The complex adjoint Lie group E6 of complex dimension 78 can be considered as a simple real Lie group of real dimension 156. This has fundamental group Z/3Z, has maximal compact subgroup the compact form (see below) of E6, and has an outer automorphism group non-cyclic of order 4 generated by complex conjugation and by the outer automorphism which already exists as a complex automorphism.

As well as the complex Lie group of type E6, there are five real forms of the Lie algebra, and correspondingly five real forms of the group with trivial center (all of which have an algebraic double cover, and three of which have further non-algebraic covers, giving further real forms), all of real dimension 78, as follows:

* The compact form (which is usually the one meant if no other information is given), which has fundamental group Z/3Z and outer automorphism group Z/2Z.
* The split form, EI (or E6(6)), which has maximal compact subgroup Sp(4)/(±1), fundamental group of order 2 and outer automorphism group of order 2.
* The quasi-split form EII (or E6(2)), which has maximal compact subgroup SU(2) × SU(6)/(center), fundamental group cyclic of order 6 and outer automorphism group of order 2.
* EIII (or E6(-14)), which has maximal compact subgroup SO(2) × Spin(10)/(center), fundamental group Z and trivial outer automorphism group.
* EIV (or E6(-26)), which has maximal compact subgroup F4, trivial fundamental group cyclic and outer automorphism group of order 2.

The EIV form of E6 is the group of collineations (line-preserving transformations) of the octonionic projective plane OP2. It is also the group of determinant-preserving linear transformations of the exceptional Jordan algebra. The exceptional Jordan algebra is 27-dimensional, which explains why the compact real form of E6 has a 27-dimensional complex representation. The compact real form of E6 is the isometry group of a 32-dimensional Riemannian manifold known as the &#x27;bioctonionic projective plane&#x27;; similar constructions for E7 and E8 are known as the Rosenfeld projective planes, and are part of the Freudenthal magic square.

== E6 as an algebraic group ==
By means of a Chevalley basis for the Lie algebra, one can define E6 as a linear algebraic group over the integers and, consequently, over any commutative ring and in particular over any field: this defines the so-called split (sometimes also known as &quot;untwisted&quot;) adjoint form of E6. Over an algebraically closed field, this and its triple cover are the only forms; however, over other fields, there are often many other forms, or &quot;twists&quot; of E6, which are classified in the general framework of Galois cohomology (over a perfect field &quot;k&quot;) by the set &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;k&quot;, Aut(E6)) which, because the Dynkin diagram of E6 (see below) has automorphism group Z/2Z, maps to &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;k&quot;, Z/2Z) = Hom (Gal(&quot;k&quot;), Z/2Z) with kernel &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;k&quot;, E6,ad).

Over the field of real numbers, the real component of the identity of these algebraically twisted forms of E6 coincide with the three real Lie groups mentioned above, but with a subtlety concerning the fundamental group: all adjoint forms of E6 have fundamental group Z/3Z in the sense of algebraic geometry, with Galois action as on the third roots of unity; this means that they admit exactly one triple cover (which may be trivial on the real points); the further non-compact real Lie group forms of E6 are therefore not algebraic and admit no faithful finite-dimensional representations. The compact real form of E6 as well as the noncompact forms EI=E6(6) and EIV=E6(-26) are said to be &quot;inner&quot; or of type 1E6 meaning that their class lies in &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;k&quot;, E6,ad) or that complex conjugation induces the trivial automorphism on the Dynkin diagram, whereas the other two real forms are said to be &quot;outer&quot; or of type 2E6.

Over finite fields, the Lang–Steinberg theorem implies that &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;k&quot;, E6) = 0, meaning that E6 has exactly one twisted form, known as 2E6: see below.

=== Automorphisms of an Albert Algebra ===
Similar to how the algebraic group G2 is the automorphism group of the octonions and the algebraic group F4 is the automorphism group of an Albert algebra, an exceptional Jordan algebra, the algebraic group E6 is the group of linear automorphisms of an Albert algebra that preserve a certain cubic form, called the &quot;determinant&quot;.

== Algebra ==

=== Dynkin diagram ===
The Dynkin diagram for E6 is given by , which may also be drawn as .

=== Roots of E6 ===
Although they span a six-dimensional space, it is much more symmetrical to consider them as vectors in a six-dimensional subspace of a nine-dimensional space. Then one can take the roots to be
:(1,−1,0;0,0,0;0,0,0), (−1,1,0;0,0,0;0,0,0),
:(−1,0,1;0,0,0;0,0,0), (1,0,−1;0,0,0;0,0,0),
:(0,1,−1;0,0,0;0,0,0), (0,−1,1;0,0,0;0,0,0),
:(0,0,0;1,−1,0;0,0,0), (0,0,0;−1,1,0;0,0,0),
:(0,0,0;−1,0,1;0,0,0), (0,0,0;1,0,−1;0,0,0),
:(0,0,0;0,1,−1;0,0,0), (0,0,0;0,−1,1;0,0,0),
:(0,0,0;0,0,0;1,−1,0), (0,0,0;0,0,0;−1,1,0),
:(0,0,0;0,0,0;−1,0,1), (0,0,0;0,0,0;1,0,−1),
:(0,0,0;0,0,0;0,1,−1), (0,0,0;0,0,0;0,−1,1),
plus all 27 combinations of formula_2 where formula_3 is one of formula_4
plus all 27 combinations of formula_5 where formula_6 is one of formula_7

Simple roots

One possible selection for the simple roots of E6 is: 
:(0,0,0;0,0,0;0,1,−1)

:(0,0,0;0,0,0;1,−1,0)

:(0,0,0;0,1,−1;0,0,0)

:(0,0,0;1,−1,0;0,0,0)

:(0,1,−1;0,0,0;0,0,0)

==== E6 roots derived from the roots of E8 ====
E6 is the subset of E8 where a consistent set of three coordinates are equal (e.g. first or last). This facilitates explicit definitions of E7 and E6 as:

:E&quot;7&quot; = {α ∈ Z7 ∪ (Z+)7 : Σαi2 + α12 = 2, Σαi + α1 ∈ 2Z},
:E&quot;6&quot; = {α ∈ Z6 ∪ (Z+)6 : Σαi2 + 2α12 = 2, Σαi + 2α1 ∈ 2Z}

The following 72 E6 roots are derived in this manner from the split real even E8 roots. Notice the last 3 dimensions being the same as required:

==== An alternative description ====
An alternative (6-dimensional) description of the root system, which is useful in considering E6 × SU(3) as a subgroup of E8, is the following:

All formula_9 permutations of
:formula_10 preserving the zero at the last entry,

and all of the following roots with an odd number of plus signs

:formula_11

Thus the 78 generators consist of the following subalgebras:

: A 45-dimensional SO(10) subalgebra, including the above formula_9 generators plus the five Cartan generators corresponding to the first five entries.
: Two 16-dimensional subalgebras that transform as a Weyl spinor of formula_13 and its complex conjugate. These have a non-zero last entry.
: 1 generator which is their chirality generator, and is the sixth Cartan generator.

One choice of simple roots for E6 is given by the rows of the following matrix, indexed in the order :

:formula_14

=== Weyl group ===
The Weyl group of E6 is of order 51840: it is the automorphism group of the unique simple group of order 25920 (which can be described as any of: PSU4(2), PSΩ6−(2), PSp4(3) or PSΩ5(3)).

=== Cartan matrix ===
:formula_15

== Important subalgebras and representations ==
The Lie algebra E6 has an F4 subalgebra, which is the fixed subalgebra of an outer automorphism, and an SU(3) × SU(3) × SU(3) subalgebra. Other maximal subalgebras which have an importance in physics (see below) and can be read off the Dynkin diagram, are the algebras of SO(10) × U(1) and SU(6) × SU(2).

In addition to the 78-dimensional adjoint representation, there are two dual 27-dimensional &quot;vector&quot; representations.

The characters of finite dimensional representations of the real and complex Lie algebras and Lie groups are all given by the Weyl character formula. The dimensions of the smallest irreducible representations are :

:1, 27 (twice), 78, 351 (four times), 650, 1728 (twice), 2430, 2925, 3003 (twice), 5824 (twice), 7371 (twice), 7722 (twice), 17550 (twice), 19305 (four times), 34398 (twice), 34749, 43758, 46332 (twice), 51975 (twice), 54054 (twice), 61425 (twice), 70070, 78975 (twice), 85293, 100386 (twice), 105600, 112320 (twice), 146432 (twice), 252252 (twice), 314496 (twice), 359424 (four times), 371800 (twice), 386100 (twice), 393822 (twice), 412776 (twice), 442442 (twice)...

The underlined terms in the sequence above are the dimensions of those irreducible representations possessed by the adjoint form of E6 (equivalently, those whose weights belong to the root lattice of E6), whereas the full sequence gives the dimensions of the irreducible representations of the simply connected form of E6.

The symmetry of the Dynkin diagram of E6 explains why many dimensions occur twice, the corresponding representations being related by the non-trivial outer automorphism; however, there are sometimes even more representations than this, such as four of dimension 351, two of which are fundamental and two of which are not.

The fundamental representations have dimensions 27, 351, 2925, 351, 27 and 78 (corresponding to the six nodes in the Dynkin diagram in the order chosen for the Cartan matrix above, i.e., the nodes are read in the five-node chain first, with the last node being connected to the middle one).

The embeddings of the maximal subgroups of E6 up to dimension 78 are shown to the right.

== E6 polytope ==
The E6 polytope is the convex hull of the roots of E6. It therefore exists in 6 dimensions; its symmetry group contains the Coxeter group for E6 as an index 2 subgroup.

==Chevalley and Steinberg groups of type E6 and 2E6==
The groups of type &quot;E&quot;6 over arbitrary fields (in particular finite fields) were introduced by .

The points over a finite field with &quot;q&quot; elements of the (split) algebraic group E6 (see above), whether of the adjoint (centerless) or simply connected form (its algebraic universal cover), give a finite Chevalley group. This is closely connected to the group written E6(&quot;q&quot;), however there is ambiguity in this notation, which can stand for several things:

* the finite group consisting of the points over F&quot;q&quot; of the simply connected form of E6 (for clarity, this can be written E6,sc(&quot;q&quot;) or more rarely formula_16 and is known as the &quot;universal&quot; Chevalley group of type E6 over F&quot;q&quot;),
* (rarely) the finite group consisting of the points over F&quot;q&quot; of the adjoint form of E6 (for clarity, this can be written E6,ad(&quot;q&quot;), and is known as the &quot;adjoint&quot; Chevalley group of type E6 over F&quot;q&quot;), or
* the finite group which is the image of the natural map from the former to the latter: this is what will be denoted by E6(&quot;q&quot;) in the following, as is most common in texts dealing with finite groups.

From the finite group perspective, the relation between these three groups, which is quite analogous to that between SL(&quot;n,q&quot;), PGL(&quot;n,q&quot;) and PSL(&quot;n,q&quot;), can be summarized as follows: E6(&quot;q&quot;) is simple for any &quot;q&quot;, E6,sc(&quot;q&quot;) is its Schur cover, and E6,ad(&quot;q&quot;) lies in its automorphism group; furthermore, when &quot;q&quot;−1 is not divisible by 3, all three coincide, and otherwise (when &quot;q&quot; is congruent to 1 mod 3), the Schur multiplier of E6(&quot;q&quot;) is 3 and E6(&quot;q&quot;) is of index 3 in E6,ad(&quot;q&quot;), which explains why E6,sc(&quot;q&quot;) and E6,ad(&quot;q&quot;) are often written as 3·E6(&quot;q&quot;) and E6(&quot;q&quot;)·3. From the algebraic group perspective, it is less common for E6(&quot;q&quot;) to refer to the finite simple group, because the latter is not in a natural way the set of points of an algebraic group over F&quot;q&quot; unlike E6,sc(&quot;q&quot;) and E6,ad(&quot;q&quot;).

Beyond this &quot;split&quot; (or &quot;untwisted&quot;) form of E6, there is also one other form of E6 over the finite field F&quot;q&quot;, known as 2E6, which is obtained by twisting by the non-trivial automorphism of the Dynkin diagram of E6. Concretely, 2E6(&quot;q&quot;), which is known as a Steinberg group, can be seen as the subgroup of E6(&quot;q&quot;2) fixed by the composition of the non-trivial diagram automorphism and the non-trivial field automorphism of F&quot;q&quot;2. Twisting does not change the fact that the algebraic fundamental group of 2E6,ad is Z/3Z, but it does change those &quot;q&quot; for which the covering of 2E6,ad by 2E6,sc is non-trivial on the F&quot;q&quot;-points. Precisely: 2E6,sc(&quot;q&quot;) is a covering of 2E6(&quot;q&quot;), and 2E6,ad(&quot;q&quot;) lies in its automorphism group; when &quot;q&quot;+1 is not divisible by 3, all three coincide, and otherwise (when &quot;q&quot; is congruent to 2 mod 3), the degree of 2E6,sc(&quot;q&quot;) over 2E6(&quot;q&quot;) is 3 and 2E6(&quot;q&quot;) is of index 3 in 2E6,ad(&quot;q&quot;), which explains why 2E6,sc(&quot;q&quot;) and 2E6,ad(&quot;q&quot;) are often written as 3·2E6(&quot;q&quot;) and 2E6(&quot;q&quot;)·3.

Two notational issues should be raised concerning the groups 2E6(&quot;q&quot;). One is that this is sometimes written 2E6(&quot;q&quot;2), a notation which has the advantage of transposing more easily to the Suzuki and Ree groups, but the disadvantage of deviating from the notation for the F&quot;q&quot;-points of an algebraic group. Another is that whereas 2E6,sc(&quot;q&quot;) and 2E6,ad(&quot;q&quot;) are the F&quot;q&quot;-points of an algebraic group, the group in question also depends on &quot;q&quot; (e.g., the points over F&quot;q&quot;2 of the same group are the untwisted E6,sc(&quot;q&quot;2) and E6,ad(&quot;q&quot;2)).

The groups E6(&quot;q&quot;) and 2E6(&quot;q&quot;) are simple for any &quot;q&quot;, and constitute two of the infinite families in the classification of finite simple groups. Their order is given by the following formula :

:formula_17
:formula_18

. The order of E6,sc(&quot;q&quot;) or E6,ad(&quot;q&quot;) (both are equal) can be obtained by removing the dividing factor gcd(3,&quot;q&quot;−1) from the first formula , and the order of 2E6,sc(&quot;q&quot;) or 2E6,ad(&quot;q&quot;) (both are equal) can be obtained by removing the dividing factor gcd(3,&quot;q&quot;+1) from the second .

The Schur multiplier of E6(&quot;q&quot;) is always gcd(3,&quot;q&quot;−1) (i.e., E6,sc(&quot;q&quot;) is its Schur cover). The Schur multiplier of 2E6(&quot;q&quot;) is gcd(3,&quot;q&quot;+1) (i.e., 2E6,sc(&quot;q&quot;) is its Schur cover) outside of the exceptional case &quot;q&quot;=2 where it is 22·3 (i.e., there is an additional 22-fold cover). The outer automorphism group of E6(&quot;q&quot;) is the product of the diagonal automorphism group Z/gcd(3,&quot;q&quot;−1)Z (given by the action of E6,ad(&quot;q&quot;)), the group Z/2Z of diagram automorphisms, and the group of field automorphisms (i.e., cyclic of order &quot;f&quot; if &quot;q&quot;=&quot;pf&quot; where &quot;p&quot; is prime). The outer automorphism group of 2E6(&quot;q&quot;) is the product of the diagonal automorphism group Z/gcd(3,&quot;q&quot;+1)Z (given by the action of 2E6,ad(&quot;q&quot;)) and the group of field automorphisms (i.e., cyclic of order &quot;f&quot; if &quot;q&quot;=&quot;p&quot;&quot;f&quot; where &quot;p&quot; is prime).

== Importance in physics ==
supergravity in five dimensions, which is a dimensional reduction from eleven-dimensional supergravity, admits an bosonic global symmetry and an bosonic local symmetry. The fermions are in representations of , the gauge fields are in a representation of , and the scalars are in a representation of both (Gravitons are singlets with respect to both). Physical states are in representations of the coset .

In grand unification theories, appears as a possible gauge group which, after its breaking, gives rise to gauge group of the standard model. One way of achieving this is through breaking to . The adjoint representation breaks, as explained above, into an adjoint , spinor and as well as a singlet of the subalgebra. Including the charge we have

:formula_19

Where the subscript denotes the charge.

Likewise, the fundamental representation and its conjugate break into a scalar , a vector and a spinor, either or :

:formula_20
:formula_21

Thus, one can get the Standard Model&#x27;s elementary fermions and Higgs boson.

<text>Abitibi Consolidated Inc. was a Canadian pulp and paper company based in Montreal, Quebec. Abitibi-Consolidated was formed from the merger of Abitibi-Price Inc. and Stone Consolidated Corp. on May 29, 1997; the Company merged with Bowater in 2007 to form AbitibiBowater.

==Operations==
A network of 19 paper mills, 20 sawmills, 4 remanufacturing facilities and 2 engineered wood facilities, located in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, supplied publishers, printers, building products distributors and housing manufacturers in over 70 countries. It had approximately 12,500 employees.

A global leader in newsprint, commercial printing papers and wood products, the Company saw combined revenues of $4.85 billion in 2006. Number one in Canada in terms of total certified woodlands, Abitibi-Consolidated was also one of the largest recyclers of newspapers and magazines, serving 21 metropolitan areas in North America and the United Kingdom.

In addition, the Company had significant hydroelectric generating assets in eastern Canada, which provided a cost advantage for the associated production facilities and was an extension into the energy sector.

==History==

===Price Brothers===

Price Brothers &amp; Company Limited was a lumber firm from Quebec founded in 1820 as William Price Company by William Price. Following the death of Price Sr sons William Evan Price and Evans John Price took over and the firm became Price Brothers and Company Limited.

In 1910 the company became Price Brothers Limited as (Sir) William Price III took control of the family firm. After Sir William&#x27;s death in 1924, his sons John Herbert and Arthur Clifford Price assumed control. In the 1930s the Price family lost control and the firm was sold. Price Brothers and Company was renamed Price Limited in 1966 and was acquired by Abitibi Power and Paper Co. and became Abitibi-Price in 1974. When Abitibi-Price became Abitibi-Consolidated in 1997, the Price name finally disappeared.

===Abitibi===
Abitibi Pulp and Paper Co. Ltd. was founded in 1912 at Iroquois Falls, Ontario on the Abitibi River by Frank Harris Anson. The following February, the company name was changed to Abitibi Power and Paper Co. Ltd. to reflect the power generation business it created through the need to build a dam to generate electricity for its mill. The company expanded to other locations in Ontario where it also built dams and operated hydro electric power stations. Wherever the company built a mill, a new town sprang up around it and it even built radio stations such as CFCH in Iroquois Falls to serve these remote new communities. The company acquired other small lumber operations and grew to become a major force in the North American newsprint business but the Great Depression forced the company to file for bankruptcy protection on September 10, 1932. A Royal commission was held to enquire into the company&#x27;s affairs, with its report issued in March 1941. It remained under the control of the Court-appointed Receiver until 1946, the longest such receivership in Canadian history. Emerging from bankruptcy, the company prospered in the post-World War II industrial boom and in 1965 changed its name to the Abitibi Paper Company Ltd. In 1974, Abitibi purchased a controlling interest in the Price Brothers &amp; Company Limited which had extensive operations in the Province of Quebec and whose vast forestry business dated back to the William Price Company established in Quebec City in 1820. The merger of Abitibi and the Price Brothers made it the world&#x27;s biggest newsprint producer. In 1979, the corporate name was changed to Abitibi-Price Inc. and in 1981 it was taken over by Olympia and York Developments Ltd. In 1982, Abitibi-Price bought out the Hilroy companies, whose founder, Roy Hill, had been a member of the Abitibi board of directors and had died in 1978. With the purchase of Hilroy, Abitibi-Price became the premiere vertically-integrated supplier of office stationery in the Canadian market. The collapse of Olympia and York in 1992 resulted in the consortium of banks being forced to take control of Abitibi-Price Inc. for a short time until they sold it through a public share issue in 1994. The share issue also entailed the divestment and sale of Hilroy to the Mead Corporation.

===Consolidated===
The Bathurst Power and Paper Company Ltd. built a mill in Bathurst, New Brunswick in 1914. Majority control of the company was obtained in the late 1930s by Arthur J. Nesbitt and his partner Peter A. T. Thomson through their holding company, Power Corporation of Canada. In the early 1960s, Power Corporation bought the Consolidated Paper Company. When Paul Desmarais acquired control of Power Corporation in 1968, the two companies were merged to become Consolidated-Bathurst Inc., which, in 1989, was sold to Stone Container Corporation of Chicago, Illinois who renamed it Stone Consolidated Inc.

===Acquisitions===
In 2000, Abitibi-Consolidated acquired a majority shareholding in Canadian integrated forest products company Donohue Inc.

== Merger with Bowater==
On January 29, 2007, Bowater and Abitibi-Consolidated announced they would be merging to create AbitibiBowater. The merger created the third largest pulp and paper company in North America, and the eighth largest in the world. Following the merger, Abitibi-Consolidated was rated B1, B+ and B+ by Moody&#x27;s, Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s and Fitch Ratings respectively.

<text>The suboccipital nerve (first cervical dorsal ramus) is the dorsal primary ramus of the first cervical nerve (C1). It exits the spinal cord between the skull and the first cervical vertebra, the atlas.

It lies within the suboccipital triangle along with the vertebral artery, where the artery enters the foramen magnum.

It supplies muscles of the suboccipital triangle, the rectus capitis posterior major, obliquus capitis superior, and obliquus capitis inferior. The suboccipital nerve also innervates rectus capitis posterior minor.

<doc id="293745" wikidata="Q1950718" url="?curid=293745" title="Mount Seymour">
<text>Mount Seymour is a mountain located in Mount Seymour Provincial Park in the District of North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is a part of the North Shore Mountains, rising to the north from the shores of Burrard Inlet and Indian Arm to a summit of above the Indian River and Deep Cove neighbourhoods. Mount Seymour is most commonly identified for its ski area of the same name, and as a popular hiking area. It is named in honour of Frederick Seymour, second governor of the Colony of British Columbia. The name is used to refer to the ridge although the main summit is one of several, and is also known as Third Peak.

==History==
In the 1920&#x27;s a road was built ending in a parking lot part way up the mountain. The parking lot and a small shelter and bulletin board became the starting point for early hiking and skiing. In 1936 the area was designated as a provincial park. In 1938 under the ownership of the Swedish emigrant, Harald Enqvist, a lodge was built housing a ski rental and a cafeteria. In 1949 the Government of British Columbia, then a Liberal Conservative coalition under B.Johnson, extended the road to its present location and bought the ski area. The Government did not have the experience to run a ski area, so, they issued Mr. Enqvist the first Park Use Permit to operate the area. The name Enqvist was later spelled Enquist giving name to &quot;The Enquist Lodge&quot; and &quot;Enquist Tube Park&quot; among other facilities. When the permit expired in 1951, the government found a concessionaire, who was put in charge of running the lifts, ski school and cafeteria. Under government ownership the Mystery Peak double chairlift was installed in 1977. The government retained overall ownership until 1984, when Bill Bennett&#x27;s Social Credit government privatized its operation. Under the contract the private resort operator owns all the equipment and facilities but pays rent for use of the park land. The contracts were for 60 (or 50) years and could be renewed after 30 years. Similar arrangements were made at the time for Ski resorts operating in Cypress Provincial Park and Manning Provincial Park. 

The ski area has been run by the Wood family since 1984. They installed the Lodge chairlift, a short lift taking riders up to the main lodge, in 1986 and the Brockton chairlift, a lift taking riders up and beyond Mystery Peak, in the early 1990s. Starting in the 2010s, the mountain has been more aggressively upgraded. The original Mystery Peak chairlift was removed in 2012 and replaced with a high-speed quad, while the Goldie rope tow was replaced with a magic carpet. Next, Mt Seymour replaced the Lodge chair with a high-speed quad for the 2023-2024 ski season.

On January 19, 2014, search and rescue leader Tim Jones died while coming down from the North Shore Rescue team cabin on Mount Seymour. Jones had saved many lives on the mountain over the years. Shortly after his death a community movement was formed to name the yet-unnamed Second Peak of Seymour after him. The BC government officially named the place Tim Jones Peak in 2017.

==Recreation==
==Facilities==

The Mount Seymour ski area has four lifts: the Mystery Peak Express, a high-speed quad chairlift, the Lodge Chairlift, a quad chairlift paired with a loading conveyor belt, Brockton double chairlift, and the Goldie Lake covered magic carpet. Another double chairlift, the Ridge Chair, was destroyed in a windstorm in 1998, and is currently still standing, though gradually rotting away. Another beginner lift, the Goldie Ropetow was removed in 2011 replaced by the magic carpet. The area offers of vertical drop and about of annual snowfall. Skiing and snowboarding are available on 40 marked trails and many unmarked routes. The longest trail is long (Unicorn) and 18 of the trails have night lighting. Four additional terrain parks exist for freestyle activities. Terrain has also been developed for snowtubing and tobogganing.

Guided and unguided snowshoeing takes place on a separate network of maintained trails. Backcountry access for snowshoeing and camping is permitted.

Mount Seymour&#x27;s Enquist Cabin, located in the Tube Park Parking Lot was destroyed in a fire in the late spring of 2005. The cabin was available for rental and was the home of the Mount Seymour Ski Club. This cabin has been rebuilt, and has been in operation since the beginning of the 2010/2011 season.

==Snow depth==
Mount Seymour has three weather stations: one at the bottom of the Mystery Peak Chairlift, one near tower 9 of the Mystery Peak Chairlift, and one just below Brockton Point which is the top lift station of the Brockton Chairlift. Except for the unusually warm winter of 2014-2015, there is usually a snow depth of or more at the Brockton weather station.

BCRFC historical records (from 1960 to 1989) report that Mount Seymour&#x27;s average snow base has been on January 1, increasing through winter and spring to on May 1.

==Broadcasting==
Several Vancouver-area broadcasters use transmission towers located on Mount Seymour. On 16 December 1953, the first television broadcast in Western Canada was transmitted from this site by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s CBUT Channel 2. The CBC broadcasting site on Mount Seymour was both the first television broadcasting site in Western Canada and the first high elevation/mountain top broadcasting site in Canada.

== History ==
===Origins in Britain===
In 1848, Henry Potter Burt founded Burt, Boulton Holdings Ltd. in England, a company that specialized in treating timber against rot from moisture. The company used substances, such as creosote derived from coal tar, to prolong lumber&#x27;s useful life, supplying railway ties and pilings for wharves and foundations throughout Europe and the British Empire. Within eleven years Burt, Boulton was exporting to North America and acquired a sawmill in Quebec&#x27;s Eastern Townships.

In the coal-intensive environment of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, there was an ever-increasing source of coal tar, and a demand for treated wood. Growth continued for Burt, Boulton Holdings Ltd. and led to the founding of a new company on February 4, 1903. It was called the Dominion Tar and Chemical Company, Limited. Dominion Tar&#x27;s first plant was located in Sydney, Nova Scotia, and began operations just eight months later.

In 1910, the company obtained two major contracts. The first, from the Canadian Pacific Railway, was to treat railway ties, and the second, with the Lake Superior Iron &amp; Steel Company (a predecessor of Algoma Steel), was to process tar produced from the coke ovens at its Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario mill. This required the financing of two new plants at opposite ends of Eastern Canada. Burt, Boulton retained the majority of shares in the company but took on Senator John S. McLennan from Nova Scotia and Drummond, McCall &amp; Co. of Montreal as the corporation&#x27;s first Canadian shareholders.

When the First World War broke out in 1914, Dominion Tar established its head office in Montreal, Canada.

===Incorporation in Canada===
Throughout the first quarter of the twentieth century, Dominion Tar opened offices in Toronto, Halifax, Vancouver, and Calgary. On November 26, 1928, Canadian business magnates Sir Herbert Holt of Montreal and Harold Gundy of Toronto acquired the British-owned corporation.

In 1929, Dominion Tar and Chemical Company Ltd was formed as a Canadian corporation in order to acquire the assets of the former company, and shortly thereafter offered its shares for public sale. It was then listed on the Montreal and Toronto stock exchanges. By the following year, it had unlisted trading privileges on the American Stock Exchange.

During the Great Depression of 1931–36, operating costs were slashed and capital expenditures delayed. Employee wages were reduced 10% and management was consolidated. Several plants were closed — some temporarily, others permanently. Dominion Tar withheld its annual dividend on common stock from 1932 to 1937.

In 1937, Dominion Tar invested in Industrial Minerals, an Alberta company that was producing salt under the Sifto brand.

In the 1950s, the firm&#x27;s assets grew from $35 million to over $500 million, with annual sales surging from $33 million to $325 million, and annual net profits climbing from less than $2.25 million to almost $19 million. Operations were still based on coal tar, salt, and construction materials. However, throughout this decade the company negotiated a series of acquisitions to fuel its growth:

:* In 1956, it began accumulating shares of Howard Smith Paper Mills, Canada&#x27;s largest fine paper company.
:* In 1958, it entered the field of construction materials with the acquisition of Gypsum, Lime, &amp; Alabastine Canada Limited, makers of gypsum wallboard

It also elevated Dominion Tar into the ranks of the largest Canadian-owned corporations, with plants located across the country, over $350 million in assets, and annual sales to match.

While continuing to invest in all its business sectors, Dominion Tar began to concentrate efforts on paper manufacturing, and converted the Windsor, Quebec pulp mill to exclusive production of bleached hardwood pulp and building a new greenfield pulp mill in Lebel-sur-Quévillon.

In 1962, the Cape Breton operations were abandoned, leaving behind Dominion Tar&#x27;s contribution to the Sydney Tar Ponds, a Canadian hazardous waste site on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia.

===Creation of Domtar===
In 1961, Dominion Tar entered into a merger with several other companies:

:* Howard Smith Paper (involving those shareholders who had not yet sold out to Dominion Tar),
:* St. Lawrence Corporation Limited, and
:* Hinde &amp; Dauch Limited.

In 1965, Dominion Tar &amp; Chemical Company, Limited became known as Domtar Ltd. (later changed to Domtar Inc.). In addition, the newly formed Domtar was reorganized into several operating divisions:

:* Chemicals,
:* Consumer Products (sold to Bristol Myers in 1967),
:* Construction Materials (sold to Georgia Pacific in 1998),
:* Kraft and Fine Papers,
:* Newsprint and Containerboard, and
:* Packaging.

In 1967, the latter three units were consolidated into a single pulp and paper group. By then, total corporate assets had reached $477 million, and Domtar was now determined to become a leader in paper manufacturing.

===Acquisitions and rationalizations===
Throughout the 1970s, Domtar began to re-evaluate its non-paper businesses as it continued to expand. The first noteworthy venture was the acquisition of Buntin Reid Paper Co. Ltd., the largest independent fine paper merchant in Canada. Next came the modernization and expansion of the flagship Cornwall, Ontario mill (closed in 2006), the expansion of the Caledonia gypsum wallboard plant, investments in a new laminated products plant at Huntsville, Ontario, and the acquisition of McFarlaneson &amp; Hodgson Inc., a major Canadian fine paper merchant. Domtar also launched several joint ventures to increase its lumber operations and to supply more wood to its newsprint mill in Dolbeau, Quebec.

In 1978, Argus Corporation, a long-time controlling shareholder in Domtar, entered into a private deal with MacMillan Bloedel to sell its 19% stake. Macmillan Bloedel made a takeover bid for the rest of Domtar&#x27;s shares, and Domtar retaliated with its own bid for MB&#x27;s shares. When the Province of British Columbia announced that it was opposing any attempt to acquired MB, both bids were dropped and MB sold its Domtar shares to the &quot;Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec&quot; in 1979. In 1981, the Caisse and the &quot;Société générale de financement du Québec&quot; expanded their shareholdings to a total of 42% of all outstanding common shares.

In 1979, Domtar acquired Reed Limited, a subsidiary of a U.K. pulp and paper manufacturer, with three corrugated container plants, a linerboard mill, and a waste paper recycling plant, all in the Toronto area. That same year, Domtar acquired Kaiser Cement&#x27;s gypsum resources in the United States and Canada. Lastly, the company founded Domtar Resources Inc. as an entry into the natural gas and oil exploration business in western Canada. The levelling off of energy costs eventually led to the venture&#x27;s demise.

In the early 1980s, Domtar withdrew from its manufacturing activities abroad and closed its U.K. fine paper mill. Paper remained paramount and Domtar began to explore the potential for paper recycling, and the Packaging Group proceeded to convert purchased waste paper into pulp.

In 1989, the company divested itself of the Arborite Products and Salt divisions, and exited the consumer products business to turn to manufacturing commodities for conversion or packaging prior to sale.

In December 1997, Domtar and Cascades Inc. developed a joint venture called Norampac. A major North American manufacturer and distributor of container board, Norampac is Canada&#x27;s largest producer of corrugated packaging. Since 2006, Cascades owns Norampac. 

In 1998, it bought the E. B. Eddy Company.

In January 2000, Domtar launched an e-business application, e-PAPER, enabling merchants and distributors to communicate with Domtar via the Internet. It also enabled customers to check on inventory, place orders, and track orders in transit via truck-mounted GPS units.

In July 2000, Domtar completed its acquisition of Ris Paper Company Inc., one of the largest independent merchants of commercial printing and business papers in the United States. On August 7, 2001, Domtar purchased four paper mills and their associated businesses and assets from Georgia-Pacific Corporation for a total of US$1.65 billion. With the acquisition of mills in Ashdown, Arkansas; Nekoosa and Port Edwards in Wisconsin; and Woodland, Maine, Domtar became Canada&#x27;s largest paper company in terms of sales, third-largest producer of uncoated free sheet paper in North America, and fourth-largest in the world. The Port Edwards plant was closed in 2008 and sold in 2013, and the Woodland plant was sold in 2010.

In August 2011 Domtar acquired Attends Healthcare, Inc., manufacturer and supplier of incontinence products, from KPS Capital Partners, L.P. for $315 million. Domtar also purchased Attends Healthcare Limited, manufacturer and supplier of adult incontinence care products in Europe, from Rutland Partners for €180 million, pursuant to a definitive agreement entered into on January 26, 2012. The brand was founded by Procter and Gamble in 1979.

===Merger with Weyerhaeuser===
On August 22, 2006, Domtar, Inc. agreed to merge with the paper division of Weyerhaeuser. The merger was effected as an arrangement under the &quot;Canada Business Corporations Act&quot;, taking place in several steps:

:* Weyerhauser transferred its division to Weyerhauser TIA, Inc., whose shares would be spun off to Weyerhauser&#x27;s shareholders.
:* Domtar&#x27;s shareholders would exchange their shares for those of Weyerhauser TIA.
:* The shareholdings were effectively split 55% for Weyerhauser&#x27;s shareholders and 45% for Domtar&#x27;s former shareholders.
:* Weyerhauser had the right to nominate a majority of the new board of directors.

On March 7, 2007, the transaction officially closed, and Weyerhauser TIA was subsequently renamed as Domtar Corporation.

In March 2013, Domtar announced it was acquiring Xerox&#x27;s US and Canadian Paper businesses and began being the exclusive seller and distributor of Xerox products as of June 1, 2013.
Cornwall coated cover was produced for a time in Chinese paper mills due to the closure of the Cornwall, Ontario plant, but production has since ceased.

===Acquisition by Paper Excellence===
On May 11, 2021, privately held forest products company Paper Excellence announced that it was acquiring Domtar Corp. for US$2.8-billion.

== Environmental issues ==
===Nova Scotia===
The company was originally known as the Dominion Tar and Chemical Company, Limited. Its first plant was located in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.

Dominion Tar and Chemical Company Ltd (Domtar) operated a coal tar refining plant and a coal tar storage facility in Sydney from 1903 to 1962. This facility was situated directly adjacent to and north of the coke oven operations. It diverted coal tar from the coke ovens, refined it, moved it through pipes, and stored it in tanks for shipping elsewhere. Domtar ceased operations in Sydney in 1962 abandoning its storage tanks, waste disposal lagoons, pipes, buildings and equipment. Domtar conducted little or no clean up of the site. A large tank, referred to as the &quot;Domtar tank&quot;, remained in place adjacent to the coke ovens site into the 2000s, measuring 28 m (92 ft.) in diameter and 6 m (20 ft.) high. It contained materials abandoned by Domtar and other materials added in the years since the facility&#x27;s abandonment.

This site, which is located adjacent to the former Sydney Steel plant, is included in a $400 million government sponsored cleanup of what is referred to as the Sydney Tar Ponds.

In 2008 Domtar partnered with WWF as a part of an ongoing effort to help them source their materials responsibly. They are also a long-time member of the Two Sides initiative.

===Cornwall===
Domtar operated a paper mill in Cornwall until 2006. The original mill was built by the Toronto Manufacturing Company in 1881 and purchased by Howard Smith Paper Mills in 1919.

In the early 1970s, Domtar persuaded the City of Cornwall to permit the dumping of its paper mill waste (sludge, bark and lime dregs) behind a shopping mall in the middle of the city. Part of the dump was sodded over while dumping continued, and Domtar funded a &quot;bunny&quot; ski hill there, known as &quot;Big Ben&quot;.

By the late 1980s, Domtar was pumping &quot;an average of 102 million litres of waste water into the St. Lawrence River every day&quot;. In May 1988, Greenpeace hung a banner from the company&#x27;s smokestacks demanding: &#x27;Zero discharge now&#x27;, referring to discharges of heavy metals, PCBs, phenols, and dioxin. Domtar was &quot;fighting efforts to make it clean up&quot; and it was listed as one of the worst polluters in Ontario in 1989.

By the mid-1990s this Domtar landfill was rapidly filling up with sludge, bark, and lime dregs from the Cornwall kraft and fine paper mill. The problem was exacerbated when new waste water regulations required the Cornwall mill to also remove lignin and starch—formerly discharged into the St. Lawrence River—from its waste water. In response, Domtar began selling dewatered mill waste to Cornwall and area residents labeled as &quot;Soil Conditioner&quot;.

For some five years—until high levels of fecal coliforms and fecal streptococcus were discovered in the waste—this &quot;Soil Conditioner&quot; was sold for home garden use and was used by local farmers as fertilizer. Domtar at first claimed that their process could not have contributed e-coli and fecal coli from human feces. The company later revealed to the Ontario Ministry of the Environment (MOE) that some toilets and urinals at the mill connected with the mill&#x27;s waste water treatment process, rather than with the city&#x27;s sanitary sewers. Moreover, a stormwater system also emptied into the sludge generating system.

The paper mill site (now a brownfield) was sold to Paris Holdings of Cornwall in 2006 with undisclosed terms and covenants relating to liability and clean up of soil and water affected, for over 120 years, by mill and human waste. Domtar still maintains control of the adjacent dump which is the source of a leachate plume polluting ground water between it and the St. Lawrence River (with the City of Cornwall Water Purification Plant in between). The dump which is officially named, the &quot;Big Ben Landfill And Recreation Area&quot;, currently receives demolition waste and asbestos from the decommissioned paper mill.

In 2007, Domtar Corporation made a request to the MOE to additionally allow the dumping of soil at &quot;Big Ben&quot;, contaminated with coal tar and bitumen waste, from another Dominion Tar and Chemical Co. Limited site in Cornwall. This manufacturing facility at 7th St. W. and Cumberland Street in Cornwall produced &quot;bituminous fibre&quot; pipe, from 1929 to 1976 known variously as; Cornwall &quot;Standard&quot; Fibre Conduit (1929–38), Cornwall Nocrete Conduit (1938–44), and finally No-co-rode Co. Ltd. – Fibre Conduit Division (1944–76).

In September 2008, over public opposition and in spite of MOE reports indicating off-site leachate impact from the dump and the likelihood of runoff to the St. Lawrence River, the MOE permitted dumping at the &quot;Big Ben&quot; site of contaminated soils from Domtar&#x27;s former No-co-rode Ltd. site.

Domtar has not remediated its former lands in Cornwall including; its paper mill site, its sludge and bark dump, and its coal tar pipe lands.

===Western Canada===
Domtar also operated a wood treatment facility in Cochrane, Alberta, treating railroad ties. This ceased operation about 1982, leaving significantly contaminated land. The latest of several clean-up operations is attempting to prevent the underground migration of the main contaminant plume. Building of non-residential structures is now in progress on part of the land.

The company once operated a wood treatment facility in the Transcona section of Winnipeg, Manitoba. The facility has been dismantled, and a residential development was created adjacent to the site in the early 1980s. The site itself remained largely vacant. In the late 1990s, years of debate and scientific study culminated with the re-detoxification. Many properties adjacent to the site were excavated to remove contaminated earth. Dozens of homes had their backyards completely dug up, and a handful also had parts of their homes removed and rebuilt—all at the company&#x27;s expense. The site itself, was converted to a wildlife sanctuary with a nature path.

Domtar operated a wood treatment plant in northeast Edmonton from 1924 to 1987. The 37-hectare property in question served as a Domtar Inc. wood-treatment operation from 1924 to 1987. Cherokee bought the land in 2010 to build a residential subdivision. Between 1924 and 1987, Domtar used this area to treat wood with creosote and other chemicals. Until 1972, the company simply dumped its untreated waste into a drainage ditch. When the plant went out of business, the soil and groundwater were left contaminated. In 1991, the Edmonton Board of Health issued warning letters, telling Hermitage neighbours to keep their children away from that area.

But Domtar and a Toronto-based brownfield specialist, Cherokee, carried out extensive remediation of the site. Eventually, Cherokee bought the whole 37-hectare parcel for $1.8 million. Parts of the property were more polluted than others.

===Other locations===
Other Domtar sites contaminated by creosote and coal tar by products include; &quot;Sunalta&quot; in Calgary, Alberta; Truro, Nova Scotia; Newcastle, New Brunswick; and New Westminster, British Columbia.
Domtar also operated a tie treating plant in Trenton, Ontario for many years.

Domtar operated a paper mill in Toronto from 1961 to late 1980s and is now site of Crothers Woods.

As of 2019, amongst the COVID-19 outbreak, Domtar announced a temporary reduction at its paper-making capacity at its Kingsport Mill, Tennessee due to decreased demand during the pandemic.

Permanent paper machine closures have been further announced at the Ashdown, Arkansas pulp and paper mill, and the Port Huron, Michigan paper mill.

== Business segments ==
=== Paper ===

:Air dry metric ton

===Research facility===
In 2010, Domtar joined with FPInnovations to create a new company that uses nanocrystalline cellulose, a material whose applications potentially include optically reflective films, high-durability varnishes, and innovative bioplastics. A new experimental plant will be located at the Domtar&#x27;s Windsor, Quebec pulp and paper mill site.

=== Distribution===
===Personal care===
Domtar has manufacturing, distribution and research and development facilities in the following locations:

:* Greenville, North Carolina
:* Aneby, Sweden
:* Jesup, Georgia 
In January 2021, the company announces that it has entered into an agreement to sell its personal care business to American Industrial Partners (AIP) for $920 million. This decision follows a strategic review of the business in August 2020 and the decision to reinforce its strategy on focused business portfolio.

<doc id="293748" wikidata="Q498798" url="?curid=293748" title="Greater occipital nerve">
<text>The greater occipital nerve is a nerve of the head. It is a spinal nerve, specifically the medial branch of the dorsal primary ramus of cervical spinal nerve 2. It arises from between the first and second cervical vertebrae, ascends, and then passes through the semispinalis muscle. It ascends further to supply the skin along the posterior part of the scalp to the vertex. It supplies sensation to the scalp at the top of the head, over the ear and over the parotid glands.

== Structure ==

The greater occipital nerve is the medial branch of the dorsal primary ramus of cervical spinal nerve 2. It may also involve fibres from cervical spinal nerve 3. It arises from between the first and second cervical vertebrae, along with the lesser occipital nerve. It ascends after emerging from below the suboccipital triangle beneath the obliquus capitis inferior muscle. Just below the superior nuchal ridge, it pierces the fascia. It ascends further to supply the skin along the posterior part of the scalp up to the vertex.

== Function ==
The greater occipital nerve supplies sensation to the scalp at the top of the head, over the ear and over the parotid glands.

== Clinical significance ==
Problems with the greater occipital nerve may be a cause of cervicogenic headaches. These may be referred to as occipital neuralgias. A common site, and usually misdiagnosed area of entrapment for the greater occipital nerve, is at the obliquus capitis inferior muscle. These may be treated with a temporary nerve block.

=== Occipital pain management ===
Most people with tension headaches experience increasing intensity with time, and report pain originating in the back of the head (occipital) moving to the front of the head (supraorbital). Neurostimulation is sometimes used to treat tension headaches that originate from the occipital nerve.

<doc id="293750" wikidata="Q441704" url="?curid=293750" title="Lesser occipital nerve">
<text>The lesser occipital nerve (or small occipital nerve) is a cutaneous spinal nerve of the cervical plexus. It arises from second cervical (spinal) nerve (C2) (along with the greater occipital nerve). It innervates the skin of the back of the upper neck and of the scalp posterior to the ear.

== Structure ==
=== Origin ===
It arises from the (lateral branch of the ventral ramus) of cervical spinal nerve C2; it (sources differ) receives or may also receive fibres from cervical spinal nerve C3. It originates between the atlas, and axis.

The lesser occipital nerve is one of the four cutaneous branches of the cervical plexus.

=== Course and relations ===
It curves around the accessory nerve (CN XI) to come to course anterior to it. It then curves around and ascends along the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle; rarely, it may pierce the muscle. Near the cranium, it perforates the deep cervical fascia. It is continued upwards along the scalp posterior to the auricle. It divides into medial and lateral segments between the inion, and intermastoid line.

=== Branches ===
It has an auricular, a mastoid, and an occipital branch.

Its auricular branch supplies the skin of the upper and back part of the auricula, communicating with the mastoid branch of the great auricular. This branch is occasionally derived from the greater occipital nerve.

=== Distribution ===
The nerve provides sensory innervation to the upper part of the back of the neck and adjacent scalp posterior to the auricle; it may also contribute to the sensory innervation of the auricle itself.

=== Communications ===
It communicates with the greater occipital nerve, great auricular nerve, and the auricular branch of the facial nerve.

=== Variation ===
Rarely, the lesser occipital nerve may be duplicated or triplicated.

== Clinical significance ==
Problems with the lesser occipital nerve cause occipital neuralgia. Nerve block is difficult due to variation in the course of the nerve.

<doc id="293751" wikidata="Q10970" url="?curid=293751" title="Lynx spider">
<text>Lynx spider (Oxyopidae) is a family of araneomorph spiders first described by Tamerlan Thorell in 1870. Most species make little use of webs, instead spending their lives as hunting spiders on plants. Many species frequent flowers in particular, ambushing pollinators, much as crab spiders do. They tend to tolerate members of their own species more than most spiders do, and at least one species has been identified as exhibiting social behaviour.

==Description ==
There are several genera of Oxyopidae: Oxyopes, Peucetia, Hamataliwa, Hamadruas, Hostus, Pseudohostus, Schaenicoscelis, Tapinillus, and Tapponia. Most spiders in the Oxyopidae family have large spiny bristles on their legs and in many species the bristles form almost a basket-like structure that may assist in confining the prey that they grasp, and protect the spider from its struggles. Most &quot;Oxyopes&quot; and &quot;Hamataliwa&quot; species are small to medium in size. Lynx spiders, in spite of being largely ambush hunters, are very speedy runners and leapers, alert and with good vision. Oxyopidae in general rely on keen eyesight in stalking, chasing, or ambushing prey, and also in avoiding enemies.

== Identification ==
As with many other families of spiders, the arrangement of their eyes is typical of the family and is an important aid in identifying them as members of the family. Six of the eight eyes of Oxyopid spiders are arranged in a hexagon-like pattern, more or less on a prominent hump on the front upper corner of the prosoma. The other two eyes are smaller, less conspicuous, and generally are situated in front of and below the other six. The basal parts of the chelicerae of most species are large, vertical and parallel, which combine with the bluff front end, a &quot;high forehead&quot; to the prosoma, to give most species a peculiar &quot;flat-faced&quot; appearance.

== Hunting ==
They tend to be drab ambush hunters, depending to some extent on the season, some occupy flowers, ambushing pollinating insects. In this they resemble the crab spiders (&quot;Thomisidae&quot;) in behaviour. Others crouch in wait, camouflaged on plant stalks or bark. &quot;Peucetia&quot; species on the other hand, commonly are larger. They are rangy and their camouflage is vivid green, adapted to hunting or hiding among foliage.

== Behavior ==

Except when defending egg purses, many tend to flee rapidly when approached by predators or large creatures such as humans. They tend not to be very aggressive towards other members of their own species, and sometimes meet casually in small groups. Possibly as an extreme example, at least one member of the genus &quot;Tapinillus&quot; is remarkable as being one of the few social spiders, living in colonies with communal feeding, cooperative brood care, and generational overlap. &quot;Peucetia viridans&quot; is unusual among spiders in that females defending their egg purses will spray or &quot;spit&quot; venom at intruders, including humans.

== Benefits ==
Some members of the genus &quot;Oxyopes&quot; are abundant enough to be important in agricultural systems as biological control agents. This is especially true of the striped lynx spider (&quot;Oxyopes salticus&quot;). Their net value in agriculture has been disputed however, on the grounds of their predation of pollinators.

==Genera==

Genera common in the United States include common lynx spiders and green lynx spiders. , the World Spider Catalog accepts the following genera:

*&quot;Hamadruas&quot; — Asia
*&quot;Hamataliwa&quot; — South America, North America, Central America, Asia, Australia, Africa, Caribbean

<doc id="293756" wikidata="Q7643409" url="?curid=293756" title="Supergroup (physics)">
<text>The concept of supergroup is a generalization of that of group. In other words, every supergroup carries a natural group structure, but there may be more than one way to structure a given group as a supergroup. A supergroup is like a Lie group in that there is a well defined notion of smooth function defined on them. 
However the functions may have even and odd parts. Moreover, a supergroup has a super Lie algebra which plays a role similar to that of a Lie algebra for Lie groups in that they determine most of the representation theory and which is the starting point for classification.

==Details==
More formally, a Lie supergroup is a supermanifold &quot;G&quot; together with a multiplication morphism formula_1, an inversion morphism formula_2 and a unit morphism formula_3 which makes &quot;G&quot; a group object in the category of supermanifolds. This means that, formulated as commutative diagrams, the usual associativity and inversion axioms of a group continue to hold. Since every manifold is a supermanifold, a Lie supergroup generalises the notion of a Lie group.

There are many possible supergroups. The ones of most interest in theoretical physics are the ones which extend the Poincaré group or the conformal group. Of particular interest are the orthosymplectic groups Osp(&quot;M&quot;|&quot;N&quot;) and the superunitary groups SU(&quot;M&quot;|&quot;N&quot;).

An equivalent algebraic approach starts from the observation that a supermanifold is determined by its ring of supercommutative smooth functions, and that a morphism of supermanifolds corresponds one to one with an algebra homomorphism between their functions in the opposite direction, i.e. that the category of supermanifolds is opposite to the category of algebras of smooth graded commutative functions. Reversing all the arrows in the commutative diagrams that define a Lie supergroup then shows that functions over the supergroup have the structure of a Z2-graded Hopf algebra. Likewise the representations of this Hopf algebra turn out to be Z2-graded comodules. This Hopf algebra gives the global properties of the supergroup.

There is another related Hopf algebra which is the dual of the previous Hopf algebra. It can be identified with the Hopf algebra of graded differential operators at the origin. It only gives the local properties of the symmetries i.e., it only gives information about infinitesimal supersymmetry transformations. The representations of this Hopf algebra are modules. Like in the non-graded case, this Hopf algebra can be described purely algebraically as the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie superalgebra.

In a similar way one can define an affine algebraic supergroup as a group object in the category of superalgebraic affine varieties. An affine algebraic supergroup has a similar one to one relation to its Hopf algebra of superpolynomials. Using the language of schemes, which combines the geometric and algebraic point of view, algebraic supergroup schemes can be defined including super Abelian varieties.

== Examples ==

The Super-Poincaré group is the group of isometries of superspace (specifically, Minkowski superspace with formula_4 supercharges, where often formula_4 is taken to be 1). It is most often treated at the algebra level, and is generated by the Super-Poincaré algebra.

The Super-conformal group is the group of conformal symmetries of superspace, generated by the super-conformal algebra.

<doc id="293758" wikidata="Q423751" url="?curid=293758" title="Loperamide">
<text>Loperamide, sold under the brand name Imodium, among others, is a medication of the opioid receptor agonist class used to decrease the frequency of diarrhea. It is often used for this purpose in irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, short bowel syndrome, Crohn&#x27;s disease, and ulcerative colitis. It is not recommended for those with blood in the stool, mucus in the stool, or fevers. The medication is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include abdominal pain, constipation, sleepiness, vomiting, and dry mouth. It may increase the risk of toxic megacolon. Loperamide&#x27;s safety in pregnancy is unclear, but no evidence of harm has been found. It appears to be safe in breastfeeding. It is an opioid with no significant absorption from the gut and does not cross the blood–brain barrier when used at normal doses. It works by slowing the contractions of the intestines.
Loperamide was first made in 1969 and used medically in 1976. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Loperamide is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 297th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 400,000 prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Loperamide is effective for the treatment of a number of types of diarrhea. This includes control of acute nonspecific diarrhea, mild traveler&#x27;s diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic diarrhea due to bowel resection, and chronic diarrhea secondary to inflammatory bowel disease. It is also useful for reducing ileostomy output. Off-label uses for loperamide also include chemotherapy-induced diarrhea, especially related to irinotecan use.

Loperamide should not be used as the primary treatment in cases of bloody diarrhea, acute exacerbation of ulcerative colitis, or bacterial enterocolitis.

Loperamide is often compared to diphenoxylate. Studies suggest that loperamide is more effective and has lower neural side effects.

==Side effects==
Adverse drug reactions most commonly associated with loperamide are constipation (which occurs in 1.7–5.3% of users), dizziness (up to 1.4%), nausea (0.7–3.2%), and abdominal cramps (0.5–3.0%). Rare, but more serious, side effects include toxic megacolon, paralytic ileus, angioedema, anaphylaxis/allergic reactions, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, urinary retention, and heat stroke. The most frequent symptoms of loperamide overdose are drowsiness, vomiting, and abdominal pain, or burning. High doses may result in heart problems such as abnormal heart rhythms.

===Contraindications===
Treatment should be avoided in the presence of high fever or if the stool is bloody. Treatment is not recommended for people who could have negative effects from rebound constipation. If suspicion exists of diarrhea associated with organisms that can penetrate the intestinal walls, such as &quot;E. coli &quot;O157:H7 or &quot;Salmonella&quot;, loperamide is contraindicated as a primary treatment. Loperamide treatment is not used in symptomatic &quot;C. difficile&quot; infections, as it increases the risk of toxin retention and precipitation of toxic megacolon.

Loperamide should be administered with caution to people with liver failure due to reduced first-pass metabolism. Additionally, caution should be used when treating people with advanced HIV/AIDS, as cases of both viral and bacterial toxic megacolon have been reported. If abdominal distension is noted, therapy with loperamide should be discontinued.

===Children===
The use of loperamide in children under two years is not recommended. Rare reports of fatal paralytic ileus associated with abdominal distention have been made. Most of these reports occurred in the setting of acute dysentery, overdose, and with very young children less than two years of age. A review of loperamide in children under 12 years old found that serious adverse events occurred only in children under three years old. The study reported that the use of loperamide should be contraindicated in children who are under 3, systemically ill, malnourished, moderately dehydrated, or have bloody diarrhea.

In 1990, all formulations for children of the antidiarrheal loperamide were banned in Pakistan.

The National Health Service in the United Kingdom recommends that loperamide should only be given to children under the age of twelve if prescribed by a doctor. Formulations for children are only available on prescription in the UK.

===Pregnancy and breast feeding===
Loperamide is not recommended in the United Kingdom for use during pregnancy or by nursing mothers. Studies in rat models have shown no teratogenicity, but sufficient studies in humans have not been conducted. One controlled, prospective study of 89 women exposed to loperamide during their first trimester of pregnancy showed no increased risk of malformations. This, however, was only one study with a small sample size. Loperamide can be present in breast milk and is not recommended for breastfeeding mothers.

==Drug interactions==
Loperamide is a substrate of P-glycoprotein; therefore, the concentration of loperamide increases when given with a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. Common P-glycoprotein inhibitors include quinidine, ritonavir, and ketoconazole. Loperamide can decrease the absorption of some other drugs. As an example, saquinavir concentrations can decrease by half when given with loperamide.

Loperamide is an antidiarrheal agent, which decreases intestinal movement. As such, when combined with other antimotility drugs, the risk of constipation is increased. These drugs include other opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, and anticholinergics.

==Mechanism of action==

Loperamide is an opioid-receptor agonist and acts on the μ-opioid receptors in the myenteric plexus of the large intestine. It works like morphine, decreasing the activity of the myenteric plexus, which decreases the tone of the longitudinal and circular smooth muscles of the intestinal wall. This increases the time material stays in the intestine, allowing more water to be absorbed from the fecal matter. It also decreases colonic mass movements and suppresses the gastrocolic reflex.

Loperamide&#x27;s circulation in the bloodstream is limited in two ways. Efflux by P-glycoprotein in the intestinal wall reduces the passage of loperamide, and the fraction of drug crossing is then further reduced through first-pass metabolism by the liver. Loperamide metabolizes into an MPTP-like compound, but is unlikely to exert neurotoxicity.

===Blood–brain barrier===
Efflux by P-glycoprotein also prevents circulating loperamide from effectively crossing the blood-brain barrier, so it can generally only antagonize mu-opioid receptors in the peripheral nervous system, and currently has a score of one on the anticholinergic cognitive burden scale. Concurrent administration of P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as quinidine potentially allows loperamide to cross the blood-brain barrier and produce central morphine-like effects. At high doses (&gt;70mg), loperamide can saturate P-glycoprotein (thus overcoming the efflux) and produce euphoric effects. Loperamide taken with quinidine was found to produce respiratory depression, indicative of central opioid action.

High doses of loperamide have been shown to cause a mild physical dependence during preclinical studies, specifically in mice, rats, and rhesus monkeys. Symptoms of mild opiate withdrawal were observed following abrupt discontinuation of long-term treatment of animals with loperamide.

== Chemistry ==
=== Synthesis ===
Loperamide is synthesized starting from the lactone 3,3-diphenyldihydrofuran-2(3H)-one and ethyl 4-oxopiperidine-1-carboxylate, on a lab scale. On a large scale a similar synthesis is followed, except that the lactone and piperidinone are produced from cheaper materials rather than purchased.

=== Physical properties ===
Loperamide is typically manufactured as the hydrochloride salt. Its main polymorph has a melting point of 224 °C and a second polymorph exists with a melting point of 218 °C. A tetrahydrate form has been identified which melts at 190 °C.

== History ==
Loperamide hydrochloride was first synthesized in 1969 by Paul Janssen from Janssen Pharmaceuticals in Beerse, Belgium, following previous discoveries of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (1956) and fentanyl citrate (1960).

The first clinical reports on loperamide were published in 1973 in the&quot; Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&quot; with the inventor being one of the authors. The trial name for it was &quot;R-18553&quot;. Loperamide oxide has a different research code: R-58425.

The trial against placebo was conducted from December 1972 to February 1974, its results being published in 1977 in the journal &quot;Gut&quot;.

In 1973, Janssen started to promote loperamide under the brand name Imodium. In December 1976, Imodium got US FDA approval.

During the 1980s, Imodium became the best-selling prescription antidiarrheal in the United States.

In March 1988, McNeil Pharmaceutical began selling loperamide as an over-the-counter drug under the brand name Imodium A-D.

In the 1980s, loperamide also existed in the form of drops (Imodium Drops) and syrup. Initially, it was intended for children&#x27;s usage, but Johnson &amp; Johnson voluntarily withdrew it from the market in 1990 after 18 cases of paralytic ileus (resulting in six deaths) were registered in Pakistan and reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the following years (1990-1991), products containing loperamide have been restricted for children&#x27;s use in several countries (ranging from two to five years of age).

In the late 1980s, before the US patent expired on 30 January 1990, McNeil started to develop Imodium Advanced containing loperamide and simethicone for treating both diarrhea and gas. In March 1997, the company patented this combination. The drug was approved in June 1997, by the FDA as Imodium Multi-Symptom Relief in the form of a chewable tablet. A caplet formulation was approved in November 2000.

In November 1993, loperamide was launched as an orally disintegrating tablet based on Zydis technology.

In 2013, loperamide in the form of 2-mg tablets was added to the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines.

In 2020, it was discovered by researchers at Goethe University that Loperamide was effective at killing glioblastoma cells.

==== United States ====
Loperamide was formerly a controlled substance in the United States. First, it was a Schedule II controlled substance. However, this was lowered to Schedule V. Loperamide was finally removed from control by the Drug Enforcement Administration in 1982, courtesy of then-Administrator Francis M. Mullen Jr.

====UK====
Loperamide can be sold freely to the public by chemists (pharmacies) as the treatment of diarrhoea and acute diarrhoea associated with medically diagnosed irritable bowel syndrome in adults over 18 years of age

===Economics===
Loperamide is sold as a generic medication. In 2016, Imodium was one of the biggest-selling branded over-the-counter medications sold in Great Britain, with sales of £32.7 million.

===Brand names===
Loperamide was originally marketed as Imodium, and many generic brands are sold.

===Off-label/unapproved use===
Loperamide has typically been deemed to have a relatively low risk of misuse. In 2012, no reports of loperamide abuse were made. In 2015, however, case reports of extremely high-dose loperamide use were published. The primary intent of users has been to manage symptoms of opioid withdrawal such as diarrhea, although a small portion derive psychoactive effects at these higher doses. At these higher doses central nervous system penetration occurs and long-term use may lead to tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal on abrupt cessation. Dubbing it &quot;the poor man&#x27;s methadone&quot;, clinicians warned that increased restrictions on the availability of prescription opioids passed in response to the opioid epidemic were prompting recreational users to turn to loperamide as an over-the-counter treatment for withdrawal symptoms. The FDA responded to these warnings by calling on drug manufacturers to voluntarily limit the package size of loperamide for public-safety reasons. However, there is no quantity restriction on number of packages that can be purchased, and most pharmacies do not feel capable of restricting its sale, so it is unclear that this intervention will have any impact without further regulation to place loperamide behind the counter. Since 2015, several reports of sometimes-fatal cardiotoxicity due to high-dose loperamide abuse have been published.

<doc id="293759" wikidata="Q661721" url="?curid=293759" title="Great auricular nerve">
<text>The great auricular nerve is a cutaneous (sensory) nerve of the head. It originates from the second and third cervical (spinal) nerves (C2-C3) of the cervical plexus. It provides sensory innervation to the skin over the parotid gland and the mastoid process, parts of the outer ear, and to the parotid gland and its fascia.

Pain resulting from parotitis is caused by an impingement on the great auricular nerve.

== Structure ==
The great auricular nerve is the largest of the ascending branches of the cervical plexus.

=== Origin ===
It arises from the second and third cervical (spinal) nerves (C2-C3), with the predominant contribution coming from C2.

=== Course and relations ===
The great auricular nerve is a large trunk that ascends almost vertically over the sternocleidomastoid. It winds around the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, then perforates the deep fascia before ascending alongside the external jugular vein upon that sternocleidomastoid muscle beneath the platysma muscle to the parotid gland. Upon reaching the parotid gland, it divides into an anterior branch and a posterior branch.

=== Branches ===
Anterior branch

The anterior branch (or facial branch) is distributed to the skin of the face over the parotid gland.

It communicates with the facial nerve (CN VII) inside the parotid gland.

Posterior branch

The posterior branch (or mastoid branch) innervates the skin over the mastoid process, on the back of the auricle (save for its upper part), of the lobule, and of the lower part of the concha.

The posterior branch communicates with the lesser occipital nerve, the auricular branch of the vagus, and the posterior auricular branch of the facial.

=== Distribution ===
The great auricular nerve is distributed to the skin of the face over the angle of the mandible and parotid gland (via anterior branch), skin over of the mastoid region (i.e. skin over the mastoid process) (via posterior branch), parts of the auricle (posterior branch), and the parotid gland and parotid fascia.

== Clinical significance ==
The great auricular nerve may be damaged during surgery on the parotid gland, reducing sensation to the face.

Pain resulting from parotitis is caused by an impingement on the great auricular nerve.

The intermingling of the great auricular nerve and the facial nerve (CN VII) is thought to be responsible for the pathogenesis of Frey&#x27;s syndrome following parotidectomy.

<text>The lesser auricular nerve originates from the cervical plexus, composed of branches of spinal nerves C2 and C3.

Therefore, the &quot;Great auricular nerve&quot; is incorrectly named &quot;Greater auricular nerve&quot;.

The Great auricular nerve runs posteriorly to the ear, and is &quot;greater,&quot; since it provides most of the innervation to the ear: the back of the ear, front of the ear and earlobe. The rest is provided by the auriculotemporal nerve, which supplies the skin anterior to the external auditory meatus.

The nerve is important for breathing because it provides exclusive motor control of the diaphragm, the primary muscle of respiration. In humans, the right and left phrenic nerves are primarily supplied by the C4 spinal nerve, but there is also a contribution from the C3 and C5 spinal nerves. From its origin in the neck, the nerve travels downward into the chest to pass between the heart and lungs towards the diaphragm.

In addition to motor fibers, the phrenic nerve contains sensory fibers, which receive input from the central tendon of the diaphragm and the mediastinal pleura, as well as some sympathetic nerve fibers. Although the nerve receives contributions from nerve roots of the cervical plexus and the brachial plexus, it is usually considered separate from either plexus.

The name of the nerve comes from Ancient Greek &quot;phren&quot; &#x27;diaphragm&#x27;.

==Structure==
The phrenic nerve originates in the phrenic motor nucleus in the ventral horn of the cervical spinal cord. It descends obliquely with the internal jugular vein across the anterior scalene, deep to the prevertebral layer of deep cervical fascia and the transverse cervical and suprascapular arteries. On the left, the phrenic nerve crosses anterior to the first part of the subclavian artery. On the right, it lies on the anterior scalene muscle and crosses anterior to the 2nd part of the subclavian artery. On both sides, the phrenic nerve usually runs posterior to the subclavian vein as it enters the thorax where it runs anterior to the root of the lung and between the fibrous pericardium and mediastinal parietal pleura.
* The right phrenic nerve passes over the brachiocephalic artery, posterior to the subclavian vein, and then crosses the root of the right lung anteriorly and then leaves the thorax by passing through the vena cava hiatus opening in the diaphragm at the level of T8. The right phrenic nerve passes over the right atrium.
* The left phrenic nerve passes over the pericardium of the left ventricle and pierces the diaphragm separately.

The pericardiacophrenic arteries and veins travel with their respective phrenic nerves.

The phrenic nerve can be marked by a line connecting these two points:
# 1st point can be labelled 3.5 cm at the level of the thyroid cartilage from the midsagittal plane.
# 2nd point is at the medial end of the clavicle.

===Variation===
As with most nerves in the neck, multiple anatomic variants have been described. Notably, there may be variability in the course of the phrenic nerve in the retro-clavicular region such that the nerve courses anterior to the subclavian vein, rather than its typical position posterior to the vein (between the subclavian vein and artery). This variant may predispose the phrenic nerve to injury during subclavian vascular cannulation.

In addition, an accessory phrenic nerve is commonly identified, present in up to 75% of a cadaveric study.

In canines, the phrenic nerve arises from C5-C7 with occasional small contributions from C4. In the cat, horse, ox, and small ruminant the phrenic nerve arises variably from C4-C7.

==Function==
Both of these nerves supply motor fibers to the diaphragm and sensory fibers to the fibrous pericardium, mediastinal pleura, and diaphragmatic peritoneum.

Some sources describe the right phrenic nerve as innervating the gallbladder, other sources make no such mention.
The right phrenic nerve may also supply the capsule of the liver.

==Clinical significance==

Pain arising from structures supplied by the phrenic nerve is often &quot;referred&quot; to other somatic regions served by spinal nerves C3-C5. For example, a subphrenic abscess beneath the right diaphragm might cause a patient to feel pain in the right shoulder.

Irritation of the phrenic nerve (or the tissues it supplies) leads to the hiccup reflex. A hiccup is a spasmodic contraction of the diaphragm, which pulls air against the closed folds of the larynx.

The phrenic nerve must be identified during thoracic surgery and preserved. To confirm the identity of the phrenic nerve, a doctor may gently manipulate it to elicit a dartle (diaphragmatic startle) response. The right phrenic nerve may be crushed by the vena cava clamp during liver transplantation. Severing the phrenic nerve will paralyse that half of the diaphragm. Bilateral paralysis can be caused by spinal cord injury, motor neuron disease, infection, pneumonia, sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, polyneuropathy, myopathy and amyotrophy, cardiac surgery, lung transplantation, or mediastinal tumors. Diaphragm paralysis is best demonstrated by sonography. Breathing will be made more difficult but will continue provided the other nerve is intact.

The phrenic nerve arises from the neck (C3-C5) and innervates the diaphragm, which is much lower. Hence, patients suffering spinal cord injuries below the neck are still able to breathe effectively, despite any paralysis of the lower limbs.

Brachial plexus injuries can cause paralysis in various regions in the arm, forearm, and hand depending on the severed nerves.

<text>L.F. Wade International Airport , formerly named Bermuda International Airport, is the sole airport serving the British overseas territory of Bermuda in the north Atlantic Ocean. It is located in the parish of St. George&#x27;s and is northeast of Bermuda&#x27;s capital, Hamilton. In 2016, the airport handled 402,925 passengers, up 5.6% from 2006. It has one passenger terminal, one cargo terminal, eight aircraft stands and can support all aircraft sizes up to and including the Airbus A380. Currently, nine passenger or cargo airlines operate seasonal or year-round scheduled services from the Azores, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The airport covers 536 acres (217 ha) of land and contains one runway.

==History==

The airfield was constructed during World War II for use as Kindley Field, a joint US Army Air Forces (USAAF)/Royal Air Force (RAF) base. The RAF forces in Bermuda were withdrawn at the end of the War. The local RAF Commander, however, stayed on, on loan to the Bermuda Government. He converted the RAF facilities into the Civil Air Terminal, operated by the local government. When the pre-war airport, a flying boat facility on Darrell&#x27;s Island, closed in 1948, Bermuda&#x27;s air routes were taken over by land planes operating through the airfield.

By then it was operated by the United States Air Force, as Kindley Air Force Base. In 1970, the field was transferred to the United States Navy, which operated it as US Naval Air Station, Bermuda until 1995. The US Navy terminated its 99-year lease and transferred the field to the Bermuda Government. It now operates the airport as part of the Ministry of Tourism &amp; Transport.

The US Navy was not required to meet international civil air standards, despite the operation of civil airlines to the base. The Bermuda Government, however, was required to meet these standards very quickly on assuming control, and at some expense. This involved changes to the airfield lighting, erecting new fences, levelling anything over a certain height and within a certain distance of the runway (including the former base commander&#x27;s residence, and the hill it stood on), and other changes.

The airport is at the west of St. David&#x27;s Island, and to the south of Ferry Reach. This places it in the &quot;East End&quot; of the archipelago, several miles from the capital, Hamilton.

The airfield was built between 1941 and 1943 by levelling Long Bird Island and several smaller islands and filling in the waterways with reclaimed land between them and St. David&#x27;s Island. This created a landmass contiguous with St. David&#x27;s. The airfield is typically described as being in, or on, St. David&#x27;s. The field originally had three runways, but only the longest is still in use. One of the others, most of which is on a narrow peninsula jutting into Castle Harbour, has been blocked by munitions bunkers that were built at the harbour end.

Additional bunkers are on the west side of the peninsula, which the US Navy had referred to as the &quot;Weapons Pier&quot;. Airport workers, today, refer to it as &quot;The Finger&quot;. The other former runway is today a taxiway to connect aprons one and two to the active runway, and the taxiway which parallels it. This was last used as a runway in 1978. It has its own former taxiway paralleling it, which now serves as a dispersal area for visiting aircraft.

On 16 April 2007 the airport was renamed as &quot;L.F. Wade International Airport&quot; in honour of L. Frederick Wade, a former leader of the incumbent governing party (the Progressive Labour Party) when it was in opposition. The name was criticised by the opposition United Bermuda Party for being politically biased.

On 16 March 2017, the Government of Bermuda signed an agreement with the Canadian Commercial Corporation, granting Skyport a 30-year concession to manage and operate the airport.

In December 2020, a new terminal was completed, replacing the previous one.

==Current operations==
In 2017, the airport handled almost five hundred thousand passengers. Airline flight arrivals and departures usually peak June – August summer season. It has received high marks in passenger satisfaction surveys, placing first among North American airports in the &quot;Under 15 million passengers&quot; category in 2003 and fourth worldwide in its size category, according to the global airport monitor report that year. Cited were courtesy of staff, security, and check-in facilities.

The former NATO hangar built in the early 1990s is now used for the airport&#x27;s growing corporate jet traffic. Because of Bermuda&#x27;s considerable distance from the nearest land mass, the airport&#x27;s use by General Aviation aircraft is limited to jets and long-range turboprops. Only jet fuel is available.

The airport offers US Customs and Immigration preclearance, which means US-bound passengers clear Customs in Bermuda; flights arriving in the US from Bermuda are thus treated as domestic flights.

Air traffic control service is provided by CI2 Aviation under contract to Bermuda Skyport Corporation. The control tower is located on the north side of the airport (not to be confused with the old tower located at the terminal building) and provides service for most of the day and night. Approach, departure and en route traffic control in the surrounding Oceanic Sector is provided by New York Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZNY), under an agreement between the US Government&#x27;s Federal Aviation Administration and the United Kingdom. The BDA tower controller and ZNY center controller are always in close contact. Remote radio transmitters and air traffic radar coverage at the airport also link Bermuda and New York Center.

A modern Doppler Weather radar with a range was built by the DAO in 2005. Navaids at the airport, such as the Instrument Landing System (ILS) and VOR (VHF omnidirectional range), are owned by Skyport but maintained by CI2 Aviation.

The airport was a United States government NASA Space Shuttle launch abort site. It was only able to be used during low and mid inclination launches.

The airport is also active in affairs of the Airports Council International (ACI), hosting the industry organisation&#x27;s Legal Affairs Committee annual meeting in 2005. In 2006, ACI selected the airport to host its World Assembly, which was held in Bermuda in November 2010, attended by hundreds of delegates representing airports worldwide. The airport&#x27;s current general manager is Aaron Adderley.

A small portion of the south-east corner of the airport was transformed in the 1990s into Bermuda Motorsports Park.

Since March 2017, Bermuda Skyport Corporation Limited has managed and operated L.F. Wade International. The 30-year airport concession includes construction of a new passenger terminal, which was completed in 2020.

<doc id="293769" wikidata="Q1740177" url="?curid=293769" title="Dorsal scapular nerve">
<text>The dorsal scapular nerve is a branch of the brachial plexus, usually derived from the ventral ramus of cervical nerve C5. It provides motor innervation to the rhomboid major muscle, rhomboid minor muscle, and levator scapulae muscle.

Dorsal scapular nerve syndrome can cause a winged scapula, with pain and limited motion.

== Structure ==

=== Origin ===
The dorsal scapular nerve arises from the brachial plexus, usually from the plexus root (anterior (ventral) ramus) of cervical nerve C5.

=== Course and relations ===
Once the nerve leaves C5 it commonly pierces the middle scalene muscle. It continues deep to levator scapulae muscle and the rhomboids (minor superior to major).

The nerve is accompanied by dorsal scapular artery.

== Function ==
The dorsal scapular nerve provides motor innervation to the two rhomboid muscles, and the levator scapulae muscle.

== Clinical significance ==
Injury to the dorsal scapular nerve is usually apparent on inspection when the scapula on the injured side is located farther from the midline than the uninjured scapula. The patient would be unable to pull their shoulder back, as when standing at attention. Isolated dorsal scapular nerve injury is uncommon, but case reports usually involve injury to the scalene muscles.

The dorsal scapular nerve is typically not anaesthetised during a supraclavicular nerve block. This can cause pain after some surgeries.

=== Dorsal scapular nerve syndrome ===
Dorsal scapular nerve syndrome can be caused by nerve compression syndrome. A winged scapula is the most common symptom. Shoulder pain may occur. It causes weakness in rhomboid major muscle, rhomboid minor muscle, and levator scapulae muscle. The range of motion of the shoulder may be limited. Treatment is usually conservative.

<text>Eagle Rock Reservation is a 408.33-acre (165.25 ha) forest reserve and recreational park in the First Watchung Mountain of New Jersey (U.S.), located in the communities of West Orange, Montclair, and Verona. The land is owned and administered by the Essex County Department of Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs.
The reservation is named after the Eagle Rock, a bare rock looking down from the mountain, which marks the boundary between the towns of Montclair and West Orange, New Jersey. The Lenape Trail passes through the reservation. There are many streams that flow throughout the reservation. The forests are home to abundant wildlife, including deer and occasionally bears.

Also located on the grounds of the reservation is a restaurant and special event location called Highlawn Pavilion. The building was once a casino, in the old sense of the word meaning country house, which had various functions through the years, including as a place for refreshments.

==9/11 memorial==
After the September 11 terrorist attacks, residents of nearby communities gathered to view the aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center. Because of this, on October 20, 2002, Essex County Executive James W. Treffinger, along with many local residents and dignitaries, dedicated a section of the reservation, which overlooks the Manhattan skyline, to a memorial built in honor of those killed during the attacks. The names of all who perished at the World Trade Center or on the two planes that crashed into the twin towers are permanently inscribed in a marble memorial.

<doc id="293773" wikidata="Q7129940" url="?curid=293773" title="Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan">
<text>Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388 (1935), also known as the &quot;Hot Oil case&quot;, was a case in which the US Supreme Court ruled that the Franklin Roosevelt administration&#x27;s prohibition of interstate and foreign trade in petroleum goods produced in excess of state quotas, the &quot;hot oil&quot; orders adopted under the 1933 National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), was unconstitutional.

The ruling was the first of several that overturned key elements of the administration&#x27;s New Deal legislative program. The relevant section 9(c) of the NIRA was found to be an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power, as it permitted presidential interdiction of trade without defining criteria for the application of the proposed restriction.

The finding thus differed from later rulings that argued that federal government action affecting intrastate production breached the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. In &quot;Panama v. Ryan&quot;, the Court found that Congress had violated the nondelegation doctrine by vesting the President with legislative powers without clear guidelines and by giving the President enormous and unchecked powers. The omission of congressional guidance on state petroleum production ceilings occasioned the adverse ruling because it allowed the executive to assume the role of the legislature.

Justice Cardozo dissented and claimed that the guidelines had been sufficient.

<doc id="293775" wikidata="Q1890743" url="?curid=293775" title="Long thoracic nerve">
<text>The long thoracic nerve (also: external respiratory nerve of Bell or posterior thoracic nerve) is a branch of the brachial plexus derived from cervical nerves C5-C7 that innervates the serratus anterior muscle.

== Structure ==

=== Origin ===
The long thoracic nerve arises from the anterior rami of cervical spinal nerves C5, C6, and C7. The root from C7 may occasionally be absent. The roots from C5 and C6 pierce through the scalenus medius, while the C7 root passes in front of the muscle.

=== Course and relations ===
The long thoracic nerve descends through the cervicoaxillary canal. It is posterior to the brachial plexus, and the axillary artery and vein. This takes it deep to the clavicle. It rests on the outer surface of the serratus anterior muscle. It extends along the side of the thorax to the lower border of the serratus anterior muscle, supplying fibres to each of the muscle&#x27;s digitations.

== Function ==
The long thoracic nerve innervates the serratus anterior muscle. It supplies filaments to each of its (finger-like projections).

== Clinical significance ==
Due to its long, relatively superficial course, the long thoracic nerve is susceptible to injury, either through direct trauma or stretch. Mechanisms of injury include:

* nerve lesions.
* various sports injuries, typically occurring from a blow to the ribs underneath an outstretched arm.
* surgery for shoulder and thorax. Treating breast cancer with removal of axillary lymph nodes.
* carrying weight, such as heavy bags, over the shoulder for a prolonged time.
* Parsonage Turner Syndrome, an autoimmune disease.
* trauma or infection.

Symptoms are often minimal – if symptomatic, a posterior shoulder or scapular burning type of pain may be reported. Some injuries, particularly lesions, can paralyse the serratus anterior muscle to produce a winged scapula. This is most prominent when the arm is lifted forward or when the patient pushes the outstretched arm against a wall. However, even winging may not be evident until the trapezius stretches enough to reveal an injury several weeks later.

<doc id="293781" wikidata="Q1160343" url="?curid=293781" title="Calgary International Airport">
<text>Calgary International Airport , branded as YYC Calgary International Airport, is an international airport that serves the city of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. It is located approximately northeast of downtown and covers an area of 20.82 square kilometres (8.04 sq mi; 5,144 acres; 2,082 ha). With 18.9 million passengers in 2024 and 202,497 aircraft movements in 2023, Calgary International is the busiest airport in Alberta and the fourth-busiest in Canada by both passenger traffic and aircraft movements. This airport is served by the Calgary International Airport Emergency Response Service for aircraft rescue and firefighting protection. The region&#x27;s petroleum and tourism industries (including proximity to Banff National Park) have helped foster growth at the airport, which has nonstop flights to an array of destinations in North and Central America, Europe, and Asia. Calgary serves as the headquarters and primary hub for WestJet.

Built in the late 1930s, the site has since grown to house: 71 gates at minimum (depending on airplane type), three runways and two terminal buildings with six concourses for passengers (Gates A1-6, A12-24, B31-40, C50-65, D70-79 and E80-97), warehouses for cargo handling, and other infrastructure. The Calgary Airport Authority operates the property while paying rent to the federal government. Close to the airport are the Deerfoot Trail and Stoney Trail freeways for transport into the city and surrounding area, and public transit also serves the airport.

==History==
===Early history===
The first airport to serve Calgary opened in 1914, in the neighbourhood of Bowness. It occupied one-square kilometre () and consisted of a hut and a grass runway. The site is now the location of a community centre (The Landing) as well as Bowness High School and Bowglen Park.

Operations shifted to a new airport southwest of the city in 1928, named Old Banff Coach Road Airport (). However, issues with turbulence in the area prompted another airfield to be built the following year in the neighbourhood of Renfrew known as the Calgary Municipal Airport or Stanley Jones Airport. The local airline Renfew Air Service constructed the Rutledge Hangar at the Renfrew site (6th Street and Regal Crescent) in 1929, a lamella arch structure composed of Douglas Fir planks on a reinforced concrete base. The Renfew Air Service folded in November 1931 as a result of the Great Depression, and ownership of the Rutledge Hangar was taken over by the Edmonton Credit Corporation who subsequently lease the hangar to the City of Calgary. The RCAF used the airport in the 1940s. The Rutledge Hangar remains standing at the original Renfew site by Boys and Girls Club of Calgary and was designated an Alberta Provincial Historic Resource on 5 May 2003.

===Present site and World War II===
As the City of Calgary grew to surround the Renfrew airport site the municipal government decided to relocate the airport to a new location. The city purchased an area of land north of Calgary in 1938 for about $31,000; and remains the site of Calgary&#x27;s current airport. The city came to an agreement with Trans-Canada Air Lines to construct and lease a hangar on the site for $45,000 (), and the federal Department of Transportation financed the construction of three runways and other improvements, the first of which opened on 25 September. The new Calgary airfield was named McCall Field after First World War ace and lifelong Calgarian Fred McCall.

As a result of Canada entering the Second World War, the federal government assumed control of McCall Field in 1940, re-purposing it as a fuel and maintenance stop for aircraft involved in the war effort and later stationing the No. 37 Service Flying Training School at the airfield from 22 October 1941 until its closure on 10 March 1944. McCall Field continued to operate regular passenger flights during the Second World War.

Following the end of the Second World War, the airport had been expanded to include additional hangars, four runways and other infrastructure. The City of Calgary resumed management of McCall Field in 1946, repurposed the a hangar as a passenger terminal, and convinced the federal government to extend the airports east–west runway to in October 1949 at an estimated cost of $750,000 the construction required a excavation below grade to prevent frost heaving. At the time of completion, McCall Field&#x27;s east–west runway was the third-longest runway in Alberta behind the Calgary Airport&#x27;s north–south runway and the runway at CFB Namao.

===1950s and 1960s: Terminal expansion and jet age===
The re-purposed military hangars did not meet the needs of the growing transportation needs of the city, and efforts were made by city officials to secure funding for a new passenger terminal. A new passenger terminal was constructed in 1956; its design originated in the 1950s as a thesis project by Provincial Institute of Technology and Art architecture student Ken Bond, who later formed the architectural firm Clayton, Bond and Mogridge, which was awarded the contract for designing the new terminal. The one-million dollar project featured an open public concourse, and ticketing offices for three airlines was dubbed one of the most modern air terminals in Canada when it opened on 2 June 1956. A lavish opening ceremony was attended by federal Transportation Minister George C. Marler, Lieutenant Governor of Alberta John J. Bowlen, and Mayor Donald Hugh Mackay, and a number of other dignitaries. The festivities included an air show featuring an Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck. Following construction of the new passenger terminal, McCall Field would see 110,984 passenger arrivals, 96,287 departures and nearly of cargo through the airport in 1957.

In the 1960s Calgary City Council began lobbying the federal government to designate McCall Field as an &quot;international airport&quot;, a status defined by the Department of Transportation. As a compromise on 6 April 1962, the federal government approved naming the airport terminal Calgary International Airport from Calgary Municipal Airport. However, Mayor Harry Hays, local aldermen and residents continued to refer to the airport in general as McCall Field. Calgary International Airport did not receive official &quot;International&quot; status from the federal government until 1969. The first non-stop transatlantic flights were scheduled by Canadian Pacific Airlines in 1961, connecting Calgary with Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, and more flights from Europe commenced the following year.

The jet age arrived shortly after the construction of Calgary&#x27;s new passenger terminal. The terminal was not designed with jet aircraft in mind, and the airport&#x27;s runways were not suitable for the larger and faster aircraft. In 1961 the airport replaced the diagonal runway with an runway capable of handling modern jet aircraft. In 1963 the airport underwent a $4-million refurbishment which saw improved electronic landing aids, and the main north–south runway extended by to its present length of .

The City of Calgary was unable to afford the continued upgrades the Calgary Municipal Airport necessary to cope with the rising aircraft traffic. The city proceeded to sell the Calgary Municipal Airport to the federal government in 1966 for $2 million, and the Department of Transportation proceeded to refurbish the runways shortly afterwards.

===1970s: Terminal and hub status===
The new passenger terminal constructed in 1956 proved to only temporarily meet the needs of the city, and was inadequate for expansion or facilitating jet aircraft servicing. Following the sale of the Calgary International Airport by the City of Calgary to the Government of Canada in 1966, plans were put in motion to build a new passenger terminal. The airport&#x27;s sale came with a promise by Federal Transportation Minister Jack Pickersgill that the federal government would build a $20-million passenger terminal within five years; however, continued delays pushed completion of the terminal to 1977.

Construction began on the new passenger terminal in 1972, construction would be delayed due to re-designs to meet increased air traffic needs, causing the price of the new terminal to grow well beyond the original $20-million figure. Finally, on 12 October 1977, the new $130-million (equivalent to $-million in ), terminal was opened by Mayor Rod Sykes, Provincial Transportation Minister Hugh Horner, and Federal Transportation Minister Otto Lang two months before construction had completed. Sykes was able to leverage his friendship with Lord Mountbatten to convince British Airways to have one of the newly introduced Concorde land in Calgary on the day, and although the jet showed up a day late due to mechanical issues, it was still quite the coup for a city of less than half a million residents. Among other festivities for the opening event included flyovers by a Boeing 747, Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, and the Canadian Air Force Snowbirds. The 1977 passenger terminal remains the core of Calgary International Airport&#x27;s domestic terminal to this day.

The Jumbo Jet age arrived in Calgary with the newly introduced Boeing 747 landing for the first time in 1973, with Wardair providing non-stop bi-weekly charter service from Calgary to London. Air Canada was not far behind, and began non-stop service to London using the 747 starting on 27 June 1974. In April 1974, Calgary International Airport hosted CP Air&#x27;s flight testing for the Boeing 747 after airport firefighters went on strike at both Vancouver International Airport and Toronto Pearson Airport.

In 1974 the Government of Alberta acquired ownership of Pacific Western Airlines, Canada&#x27;s third largest airline at the time and moved the head office and hub to Calgary. The airline continued under provincial government ownership until 1983, and later merged with Canadian Pacific Air Lines to form Canadian Airlines. Canadian Airlines maintained Calgary as the hub and headquarters for the airline until it was acquired by Air Canada in 2001.

===1990s: Reorganization and WestJet===
In the early 1990s, the Government of Canada introduced the National Airports Policy which moved towards privatization, liberalization and economic deregulation of air transportation, which included the formation of a local airport authority under the name Calgary Airport Authority in 1992 for the management, operation and development of the Calgary International Airport under lease from the federal government. The Calgary Airport Authority, incorporated in July 1990 is a non-share capital, not-for-profit corporation formed under the authority of Alberta&#x27;s &quot;Regional Airports Authorities Act&quot;. The Calgary Airport Authority signed a long-term 60-year lease with an additional 20-year option, which was subsequently exercised in 2011.

In 1992, Calgary International Airport opened a new air traffic control tower at the southern end of Aero Drive. The control tower when completed was tall with of office room, and was designed with the knowledge that it would not provide the necessary line of sight to the expanded east airfield.

In February 1996, WestJet, which began as a low-cost carrier began operations with a base of operations at Calgary International, occupying an expanded area of the terminal. The airline&#x27;s first flight, a Boeing 737 departed Calgary International on route to Vancouver International Airport on 29 February 1996.

===Operation Yellow Ribbon===
During the September 11, 2001 attacks 13 international flights destined for the United States were diverted to Calgary International Airport as part of Operation Yellow Ribbon. The operation was a joint effort between NAV Canada and Transport Canada in communication with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which facilitated the grounding of potentially destructive air traffic.

===2000s: Runway and new terminal===
The Calgary Airport Authority began analyzing the facility&#x27;s air capacity in the late 1990s, and found the airport could reach its maximum capacity as early as 2006. The Airport Authority and NAV Canada made a number of changes to airport operations in the 2000s to improve the efficiency and capacity of the facility, but by 2008, with a number of changes made, NAV Canada reported the airfield would begin to exceed its practical capacity. The Calgary Airport Authority planned and under the &quot;Airport Development Program&quot;, a major development program aimed at improving the capacity and quality of the airport, which included the construction of a new runway, air traffic control tower and passenger terminal.

On 25 May 2013, the new Air Traffic Control Tower opened at Calgary International Airport. The one-year, $25-million (equivalent to $-million) project came in advance of the airport&#x27;s new runway, and at 91 m (300 ft), the tower was the tallest free-standing control tower in Canada. The airport&#x27;s previous 50 m (165 ft) control tower was demolished in October 2014.

The Calgary Airport Authority initiated the Parallel Runway Project, a $620-million (equivalent to $-million) project to assess and construct a new runway, which led to the construction of the runway 17L/35R beginning in April 2011. Upon its completion on 28 June 2014, runway 17L/35R became the longest runway in Canada. During the construction of the runway, a $295-million (equivalent to $-million), , six-lane roadway tunnel was constructed underneath the runway to connect Barlow Trail to 36th Street N.E. and now, to the edge of the city at the major freeway of Stoney Trail, Calgary&#x27;s &quot;Ring Road.&quot; The decision for Calgary City Council on whether to construct the tunnel while the runway was being constructed, or wait until a later date was a major issue during the 2010 Calgary municipal election.

The Airport Authority addressed cargo capacity through the construction of a cargo facility in 2015 followed by a facility constructed in 2016.

The final stage of the Calgary Airport Authority&#x27;s Airport Development Program was the construction of a new $1.6-billion (equivalent to $-billion) international terminal. Officially opened on 31 October 2016, the international terminal facility added 24 new aircraft gates, North America&#x27;s first call-to-gate passenger boarding system, CATSA Plus enhanced passenger screening system, moving walkways and electric concourse connection tram system. The international terminal was designed with several sustainable principles including 581 geothermal wells for heating and cooling, and an annual rainwater capture capacity of .

In October 2016, Transport Canada officially renamed Calgary International Airport to &quot;YYC Calgary International Airport&quot;, affixing the &quot;YYC&quot; IATA code to the airport&#x27;s name.

In 2020, after several months of travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the governments of Alberta and Canada announced a new program to enable certain travellers to enter Canada more easily. Canadian citizens and essential workers entering Canada at Calgary, as well as at the Sweetgrass–Coutts Border Crossing, can be tested for the virus and, if they test negative, will be allowed to quarantine for only 48 hours instead of the usual 14 days.

On August 5, 2024, a hailstorm damaged the airport and numerous WestJet aircraft, but there were no injuries. While the other damaged areas of the airport were repaired promptly, Concourse B and its gates (gates 31-40) will be closed for at least 18 months, but this will not impact airport operations.

==Infrastructure==
===Passenger terminals===

The Calgary International Airport houses two passenger terminals, one for domestic flights and the other for United States and international flights.

The four-storey Domestic Terminal was originally opened in 1977 and has undergone a number of renovations in the decades following. The ground level of the terminal serves as the arrivals area with baggage claim and transportation facilities present. The second level of the terminal serves as the departures level and includes airport check-in, security and access to departure gates. The basement level of the airport contains utilities and tenant storage while the mezzanine level contains a food court, airline offices and the airport authority offices. The Domestic Terminal has four concourses: Concourses A1, A2, B, and C. All A, B and C gates are shared between domestic airlines such as Air Canada and Westjet (and their subsidiaries) predominantly, as well as Flair Airlines, Air North, Air Transat and Porter Airlines. Westjet primarily uses A gates, Air Canada flights primarily use C gates, and B gates are used by all airlines. Concourse A1 includes departure gates A1-A6 (used for WestJet regional non-jet flights); Concourse A2 includes gates A11-A24; Concourse B includes departure gates B31-B40; and Concourse C includes departure gates C50-C65.

The International Terminal was originally opened on 31 October 2016 and consists of five levels; utilities and baggage processing in the basement. Arrivals meet and greet areas, Canada Customs and relevant infrastructure on the ground level with departure check-in, security, US customs and the international departures concourse being located on the second floor. The third level contains the USA departures concourse and finally, the mezzanine level contains the international departures lounges. The International Terminal includes gates 70 through 97 shared across two concourses: Concourse D for all flights to and from foreign countries except the US as well as domestic flights; and Concourse E for flights to and from the United States. For the International Terminal, passengers travelling to the United States clear customs and immigration prior to departure at the preclearance facility.

The Domestic Terminal is connected to the International Terminal by a 620-metre walkway corridor and path for the YYC Link Passengers Shuttles; twenty ten-seat electric vehicles used to transport connecting passengers.

WestJet, headquartered in Calgary and for which Calgary is the hub, has criticized the design of the international terminal, which opened in 2016. The airline&#x27;s CEO stated that the distance between the terminals was too long for connecting travellers and that YYC Link was insufficient to solve this problem. As a result, WestJet had to alter its schedules in order to allow additional time for passengers transiting through Calgary. The Calgary Airport Authority responded that it did not see issues with the connections process, although it said passengers would need some time to adjust to the new facilities.

===Runways===
Calgary International Airport consists of two north–south parallel runways and one intersecting runway. The parallel runways are 17R/35L (west) which is generally used for aircraft arriving and departing to the west, and 17L/35R (east) which is generally used for aircraft arriving and departing to the east. During the winter months in Calgary, cold arctic air will move in from the north which means aircraft will primarily depart and arrive on north-facing runways (35R and 35L), while the summer months with warm winds from the south, aircraft will primarily take-off and land on south-facing runways (17R and 17L). The diagonal runway 11/29 is generally used when crosswinds are present, which commonly occurs in the summer when westerly Chinooks roll into Calgary, or when extreme wind conditions prohibit the use of the parallel runways. The former fourth and smallest runway, 08/26, was almost exclusively used by light aircraft and the general aviation sector, and as of October 3, 2024, has been officially redesignated as a taxiway.

Calgary International Airport&#x27;s three runways are as follows. with the following dimensions:

*Runway 11/29 is 
*Runway 17R/35L is 
*Runway 17L/35R is 

The longest runway in Canada at the time of its 2014 opening, Runway 17L/35R was built to reduce congestion and better accommodate larger, heavier aircraft: the weight of such aircraft, combined with the low air density resulting from the airport&#x27;s high elevation and temperatures during the summer, means that a longer runway is necessary for take-off. Runway 17L/35R is also layered with concrete, a material more durable than the asphalt that composes the airport&#x27;s other runways.

===Cargo area===
The airport has allotted an extensive amount of area for cargo operations, including over of warehouse space. Freight airlines such as Cargolux make regular trips to Europe, Asia, and other destinations. In 2017, the Calgary airport handled a total of 147,000 tonnes (144,678 tons) of cargo.

In 2011, Calgary International Airport received the Air Cargo World Award of Excellence for airports between 100,000 and 199,999 cargo tonnage, having the highest score for Canadian airports, and second highest for North-American airports.

===Hotels===
Calgary International Airport has two hotels located on site. The Calgary Airport Marriott In-Terminal Hotel is a 10-storey, 318 room hotel located in the international passenger terminal was opened On 1 September 2016. The Delta Hotels by Marriott Calgary Airport In-Terminal located across Airport Road from the domestic passenger terminal.

===Other facilities===
At , the airport&#x27;s air traffic control tower was the tallest standalone control tower in Canada upon its opening in 2013; compared to the previous tower, it has space for more air traffic controllers and is situated closer to the centre of the airport, giving controllers better views of the airfield. Meanwhile, the headquarters of WestJet and its subsidiary WestJet Encore are located onsite.

==Statistics==
In 2019, YYC Calgary International Airport was again the fourth-busiest airport in Canada in terms of the total number of passengers served, which was almost 18 million. This was another record year in passenger volume, surpassing the previous record set in 2018 by 3.54%.

=== Passenger and cargo traffic ===

Calgary International Airport passenger and cargo volumes since 2010 are provided in the following table:
==Ground transportation==
Deerfoot Trail provides freeway access to the rest of the city. There is also a tunnel beneath Runway 17L/35R that links the east side of the airport site to the terminal buildings. Two parking garages and a rental-car facility are situated across from the terminals. Public transport options are also available at the airport: Buses operated by Calgary Transit link YYC Calgary International to downtown, a nearby station of the local CTrain light-rail network, and other parts of the city.

==Notable accidents and incidents==
*On 10 May 1945, Royal Air Force No. 105 Squadron de Havilland DH.98 Mosquito B Mk IX (LR503) struck the control tower roof shortly after takeoff, shearing off the planes port wing, and crashed into the ground killing both crew members. The Mosquito, known as &quot;F for Freddie&quot; was a survivor of 213 operations over Europe, and crashed while performing a low level pass for spectators prior to flying to Red Deer and Lethbridge as part of cross country tour to garner support for 8th Victory Loan Drive.
*On August 24, 1963, West Coast Airlines Flight 794, a Fairchild F-27 departing from Spokane International Airport to Calgary via Cranbrook made a crash-landing shortly before the runway. The probable cause of the accident was the pilot failed to maintain the approved minimum altitude on approach. There were no fatalities.
*On March 22, 1984, Pacific Western Airlines Flight 501, a Boeing 737-200, aborted a take-off and exited the runway onto a taxiway after a component of the left engine broke off and hit the fuel stores in the wing, resulting in a fire that spread over the left and back portions of the plane. The flight attendants evacuated all passengers, while some suffered severe injuries, all the occupants survived.
*On July 17, 1990, an Ecuadorian Air Force de Havilland Canada DHC-5 Buffalo (Registration HC-BFH) being ferried to Calgary from Quito, via Billings, had the nosegear collapse following touchdown on runway 28, igniting hydraulic fuel and resulting in the aircraft burning out. There were no fatalities.

<text>The CFP franc (French: , called the &quot;franc&quot; in everyday use) is the currency used in the French overseas collectivities (, or COM) of French Polynesia, New Caledonia, and Wallis and Futuna. The initials &quot;CFP&quot; originally stood for () but since 2022 is officially (). Its ISO 4217 currency code is &quot;XPF&quot;. The CFP franc is subdivided into 100 centimes, although there are no centime denominations. The currency is issued by &quot;Institut d&#x27;émission d&#x27;outre-mer&quot; (IEOM).

== History ==

=== 1945–1949 ===

The CFP franc was created in December 1945, together with the CFA franc, used in Africa, because of the weakness of the French franc immediately after the Second World War. When France ratified the Bretton Woods Agreement in December 1945, the French franc was devalued in order to set a fixed exchange rate with the US dollar. New currencies were created in the French colonies to spare them the strong devaluation of December 1945. René Pleven, the French minister of finance, was quoted saying: &quot;In a show of her generosity and selflessness, metropolitan France, wishing not to impose on her far-away daughters the consequences of her own poverty, is setting different exchange rates for their currency.&quot; The other French colonial currencies were set at a fixed exchange rate with the French franc. However, the CFP franc was set at a fixed exchange rate with the US dollar, which played a major role in the economy of the French Pacific territories on account of World War II. That situation ended in September 1949 when the CFP franc was given a fixed exchange rate with the French franc.

=== 1949–1985 ===

The CFP franc has been issued by the &quot;Institut d&#x27;émission d&#x27;outre-mer&quot; (IEOM, ) since 1967. The IEOM has its headquarters in Paris.

The currency was initially issued in three distinct forms for French Polynesia, New Caledonia and the New Hebrides (see French Polynesian franc, New Caledonian franc and New Hebrides franc). Wallis and Futuna used the New Caledonian franc.

Banknotes were first issued in 500, 1,000 and 5,000 franc denominations. Although the banknotes of the New Hebrides bore the name of the territory, the notes of French Polynesia and New Caledonia could only be distinguished by the name of the capital cities (Papeete and Nouméa, respectively) printed on the reverse side of the notes.

In 1969, the New Hebrides franc was separated from the CFP franc, and was replaced by the Vatu in 1982 after the establishment in 1980 of the Republic of Vanuatu.

=== Since 1985 ===

The largest denomination 10,000 CFP franc banknote (€83.80) was first issued in 1986, and omitted the capital city name. The city was also omitted from 500 franc banknotes issued after 1992, and the 1,000 and 5,000 franc banknotes issued after 1995.

In 2014, a single set of new banknote designs and smaller sizes were introduced, identical in both New Caledonia and French Polynesia. One side of the banknotes shows landscapes or historical figures from French Polynesia, the other from New Caledonia.

Before 2023, the coins were issued in two sets, one each for New Caledonia and French Polynesia, in 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 franc denominations. While the obverse side was identical, the reverse side was inscribed with either or , and used different designs depicting local landscapes, flora and fauna. However, both sets of coins could be used interchangeably in all three French territories.

The initials &quot;CFP&quot; originally stood for (). This was later changed to (), and then (), from which the XPF currency code was derived. An ordinance of 15 September 2021, which entered into force on 26 February 2022, defines the name CFP franc as ().

In 2021, a new series of smaller coins were introduced, with a single set of designs common to all three territories. The 1 and 2 franc coins were discontinued and a new, bimetallic 200 franc coin introduced. The old coins were withdrawn in January 2023.

=== Historical exchange rates ===

* 26 December 1945 to 20 September 1949 – Fixed exchange with the US dollar at US$1 = F.CFP 49.60. Non-fixed exchange rate with the old French franc, which devalued four times vs. the US dollar. From F.CFP 1 = FF 2.40 (FF = French franc) in December 1945, the exchange rate reached F.CFP 1 = FF 5.50 in September 1949.
* 21 September 1949 to 31 December 1959 – Fixed exchange rate with the old French franc at F.CFP 1 = FF 5.50
* 1 January 1960 to 31 December 1998 – Fixed exchange rate with the French franc at F.CFP 1 = NF 0.055 or NF 1 ≈ F.CFP 18.182 (1 January 1960: 100 &#x27;old&#x27; French francs became 1 &#x27;new&#x27; franc)
* 1 January 1999 onward – Fixed exchange rate with the euro at F.CFP 1,000 = €8.38 or €1 ≈ F.CFP 119.332 (1 January 1999: euro replaced FRF at the rate of 6.55957 FRF for 1 euro)
**The calculation to the euro was formula_1, which meant that 1000 XPF was not worth exactly €8.38 prior to the introduction of the euro. The value of 1000 XPF in euros was instead rounded to the nearest euro cent upon the introduction of the euro.

The 1960 and 1999 events are merely changes in the currency in use in France; the relative value of the CFP franc (XPF) vs. the French franc / euro is unchanged since 1949.

== Coins ==
In 1949, New Caledonia and French Polynesia (then called French Oceania) began to issue coins with identical obverse sides, but distinct reverse side designs. They could be used interchangeably in all three French territories, in a similar way to the use of euro coins (with distinct national obverse sides) in all countries of the eurozone.

Until 2021, the IEOM issued two sets of CFP coins in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 francs. The New Caledonian series is marked with &quot;Nouvelle Caledonie&quot; on the reverse side and was circulated mainly in New Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna. The French Polynesian series is marked &quot;Polynesie Française&quot; and circulated in French Polynesia. The reverse designs depicted landscapes, plants, or animals typical of the region, as well as the coin denomination.

The obverse side, common to both regions, included the words () and depicted an allegorical representation of Minerva the goddess of wisdom on the 1, 2, and 5 franc coins, or Marianne, symbol of the French Republic, on the higher denominations. The obverse also included the mint year and the initials of the issuing central bank (IEOM) from 1972.

The 1, 2, and 5 franc coins were made from aluminium alloy, the 10, 20, and 50 franc coins from nickel (cupronickel after 2005), and the &quot;gold&quot; 100 franc coin from nickel bronze (copper nickel aluminium alloy after 2005).

=== 2023 onwards ===
In September 2021 a new single set of coins was released, common to all three French Pacific Territories, to replace the two older sets of coins. The 1 and 2 franc coins were discontinued, and a new bimetallic 200 franc coin was issued. The old coins were withdrawn from circulation in January 2023. Since the lowest denomination in use is now the 5 franc coin, cash transactions are now subject to rounding:
*Ending in 1 or 2 francs: round down to 0.
*Ending in 3 or 4 francs: round up to 5.
*Ending in 6 or 7 francs: round down to 5.
*Ending in 8 or 9 francs: round up to 10.
*Ending in 0 or 5 francs: remain unchanged.
The rounding rule does not apply to electronic transactions, which are still completed to the franc.

The obverses of all the coins features a single wavy-line design, with the IEOM issuer and year engraved around the edge, and the denomination value. Each coin denomination has a single reverse design depicting landscapes, artefacts, flora and fauna from all three territories.

== Banknotes ==
The IEOM began issuing banknotes in New Hebrides in 1965, and in New Caledonia and French Polynesia in 1969, in 500, 1,000, and 5,000 franc denominations. In 1986 the 10,000 franc banknote was introduced, which was common to both French Polynesia and New Caledonia. These were followed, between 1992 and 1995, by new 500, 1,000, and 5,000 franc banknote designs common to all of the French Pacific Territories. One side of the banknote shows landscapes or historical figures from New Caledonia, the other from French Polynesia.

In January 2014, the IEOM issued a new series of banknotes, and the older notes were withdrawn from circulation on 30 September of that year (they can be exchanged indefinitely at IEOM offices).

== Tārā ==

Before the French regulated the currency on Tahiti, French Polynesia, traders often used dollars. The word &quot;dollar&quot; became (often written without accents as &quot;tara&quot;, or &quot;tala&quot;), and this term is still used among native Tahitian and local Chinese traders as an unofficial unit, worth 5 francs. Thus for a price of 200 francs, one would say (40 tārā) in Tahitian. The currency of Samoa is also called the tālā.

<doc id="293791" wikidata="Q498721" url="?curid=293791" title="Revised Romanization of Korean">
<text>Revised Romanization of Korean () is the official Korean language romanization system in South Korea. It was developed by the National Academy of the Korean Language from 1995 and was released to the public on 7 July 2000 by South Korea&#x27;s Ministry of Culture and Tourism in Proclamation No. 2000-8.

The new system addressed problems in the implementation of the McCune–Reischauer system, such as the phenomena where different consonants and vowels became indistinguishable in the absence of special symbols. To be specific, under the McCune–Reischauer system, the consonants (&quot;k&quot;), (&quot;t&quot;), (&quot;p&quot;) and (&quot;ch&quot;) and (&quot;k&quot;), (&quot;t&quot;), (&quot;p&quot;) and (&quot;ch&quot;) became indistinguishable when the apostrophe was removed. In addition, the vowels (&quot;ŏ&quot;) and (&quot;o&quot;), as well as (&quot;ŭ&quot;) and (&quot;u&quot;), became indistinguishable when the breve was removed. Especially in early internet use, where omission of apostrophes and breves is common, this caused confusion.

==Features==
These are notable features of the Revised Romanization system:
* The aspiration distinction between consonants is represented in a new way. The unaspirated consonants , , , and are represented as ⟨g⟩, ⟨d⟩, ⟨b⟩, and ⟨j⟩ respectively. The aspirated consonants , , , and are represented as ⟨k⟩, ⟨t⟩, ⟨p⟩, ⟨ch⟩. These letter pairs have a similar aspiration distinction in English at the beginning of a syllable (but unlike English do not have a voicing distinction); this approach is also used by Hanyu Pinyin. By contrast, the McCune–Reischauer system uses ⟨k⟩ ⟨t⟩ ⟨p⟩ ⟨ch⟩ both for the unaspirated and aspirated consonants, adding an apostrophe for the aspirated versions (⟨k&#x27;⟩ ⟨t&#x27;⟩ ⟨p&#x27;⟩ ⟨ch&#x27;⟩). (The McCune–Reischauer system also includes voicing, which the revised romanization does not.)
** When placed in the final position, , , and are romanized as ⟨k⟩, ⟨t⟩, and ⟨p⟩ respectively, as they are neutralized to unreleased stops: → &quot;byeok, → &quot;bak, → &quot;bueok, → &quot;byeoge&quot;, → &quot;bakke&quot;, → &quot;bueoke&quot;, → &quot;ip, → &quot;ibe&quot;.
* Vowels and are written as ⟨eo⟩ and ⟨eu⟩ respectively, replacing the ⟨ŏ⟩ and ⟨ŭ⟩ of the McCune–Reischauer system.
** However, is written as ⟨wo⟩, not ⟨weo⟩, and is written as ⟨ui⟩, not ⟨eui⟩.
* ㅅ in the syllable-initial position is always written as ⟨s⟩. The McCune–Reischauer system used ⟨sh⟩ or ⟨s⟩ depending on context.
** When followed by another consonant or when in the final position, it is written as ⟨t⟩: → &quot;ot&quot; (but → &quot;ose&quot;).
* is ⟨r⟩ before a vowel or a semivowel and ⟨l⟩ everywhere else: → rieul, → &quot;Cheorwon&quot;, → &quot;Ulleungdo&quot;, → &quot;Balhae&quot;. Like in McCune–Reischauer, is written ⟨l⟩ whenever pronounced as a lateral rather than as a nasal consonant: → &quot;Jeollabuk-do&quot;
* Phonological changes are reflected where , , and are adjacent to : → &quot;joko&quot;, → &quot;nota&quot;, → &quot;japyeo&quot;, 낳지 → &quot;nachi&quot;.
** However, aspirated sounds are not reflected in case of nouns where follows , and : → &quot;Mukho&quot;, → &quot;Jiphyeonjeon&quot;.

In addition, special provisions are for regular phonological rules in exceptions to transcription (see Korean phonology).

Other rules and recommendations include the following:
* A hyphen optionally disambiguates syllables: → &quot;ga-eul&quot; (fall; autumn) versus → &quot;gae-ul&quot; (stream). Official publications usually do not make use of this provision (and actual instances of ambiguity among names are rare).
** However, in special cases where the premise is to convert the romanization back to hangul (such as in academic papers), the romanization has to be changed to match hangul spelling instead of pronunciation, and a hyphen is used to denote a soundless syllable-initial (except at the beginning of a word): → &quot;eobs-eoss-seubnida&quot;
* It is permitted to hyphenate syllables in a given name. Certain phonological changes, ordinarily indicated in other contexts, are ignored in names, for better disambiguating between names: → &quot;Gang Hongrip&quot; or &quot;Gang Hong-rip&quot; (not *&quot;Hongnip&quot; or &quot;Hong-nip&quot;), → &quot;Han Boknam&quot; or &quot;Han Bok-nam&quot; (not *&quot;Bongnam&quot; or &quot;Bong-nam&quot;)
** However, this does not guarantee perfect reversibility. For example, given names and are romanized as &quot;Bitna&quot; and &quot;Saetbyeol&quot; respectively – syllable-final consonants and both become &quot;t&quot;.
* Administrative units (such as the &quot;do&quot;) are hyphenated from the placename proper: → &quot;Gangwon-do&quot;
** One may omit terms such as : → &quot;Pyeongchang-gun&quot; or &quot;Pyeongchang&quot;, → &quot;Pyeongchang-eup&quot; or &quot;Pyeongchang&quot;.
** However, names for geographic features and artificial structures are not hyphenated: → &quot;Seoraksan&quot;, → &quot;Haeinsa&quot;
* Proper nouns are capitalized.

==Transcription rules==

===Vowels===
===Consonants===
, , and are transcribed as &quot;g&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;r&quot; when placed at the beginning of a word or coming before a vowel, and as &quot;k&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;p&quot; and &quot;l&quot; when followed by another consonant or when appearing at the end of a word.

==Usage==

===In South Korea===
Almost all road signs, names of railway and subway stations on line maps and signs, etc. have been changed according to Revised Romanization of Korean (&quot;RR&quot;, also called &quot;South Korean&quot; or &quot;Ministry of Culture (MC) 2000&quot;). It is estimated to have cost at least 500 billion won to 600 billion won (US$500–600 million) to carry out this procedure. All Korean textbooks, maps and signs to do with cultural heritage were required to comply with the new system by 28 February 2002. Romanization of surnames and existing companies&#x27; names has been left untouched because of the reasons explained below. However, the Korean government recommends using the revised romanization of Korean for the new names.

===Exceptions===
Like several European languages that have undergone spelling reforms (such as Portuguese, German, Polish or Swedish), the Revised Romanization is not expected to be adopted as the official romanization of Korean family names (example &quot;I&quot;, &quot;Bak&quot;, &quot;Gim&quot;, &quot;Choe&quot; instead of &quot;Lee&quot;, &quot;Park&quot;, &quot;Kim, Choi&quot; which are used commonly). However, South Korea&#x27;s Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism recommends those who &quot;newly&quot; register their romanized names to follow the Revised Romanization of Korean.

In addition, North Korea continues to use a version of the McCune–Reischauer system of romanization, a different version of which was in official use in South Korea from 1984 to 2000.

<text>Dublin Airport () is an international airport serving Dublin, Ireland. It is operated by DAA (formerly Dublin Airport Authority). The airport is located in Collinstown, north of Dublin, and south of the town of Swords.
In 2024, over 34.6 million passengers passed through the airport, making it the airport&#x27;s busiest year on record. It is the 13th busiest airport in Europe, and is the busiest of Ireland&#x27;s airports by total passenger traffic; it also has the largest traffic levels on the island of Ireland, followed by Belfast International Airport.

The airport has an extensive short and medium haul network, served by an array of carriers, as well as a significant long-haul network focused on North America and the Middle East. It serves as a hub for Ireland&#x27;s flag carrier Aer Lingus, and is the home base for Europe&#x27;s largest low-cost carrier Ryanair. British airline TUI Airways also operates a base at the airport.

United States border preclearance services are available at the airport for U.S.-bound passengers. Shannon Airport is the only other airport in Europe to offer this facility.

== History ==

===Collinstown Aerodrome===
The airport began as a wartime aerodrome located in the townland of Collinstown, Fingal. In 1917, during World War I, Collinstown was selected as the base for the British Royal Flying Corps. By April 1918, when the Flying Corps was renamed the Royal Air Force, Collinstown Aerodrome was more than 20% complete. Construction was completed in 1919 when the Irish War of Independence broke out. On 20 March 1919, a group of 30 Irish Volunteers, including five employed by the RAF, stole 75 rifles and 5,000 rounds of ammunition from the base. As Collinstown Camp, the site was used for internment of Irish republicans. At the end of 1922, the land and buildings at Collinstown were transferred to the Irish Free State. The airfield fell into disrepair and grass grew on the former runways.

===The beginnings in the 1930s and 1940s===

In 1936, the Executive Council of the Irish Free State established a new civil airline — Aer Lingus — which began operating from Casement Aerodrome, at Baldonnel. A decision was made that a civil airport should replace Baldonnel as Dublin&#x27;s airport. The Collinstown site was chosen and extended into the neighbouring townlands of Rock and Corballis.

Work on the new airport began in 1937. By the end of 1939, a grass airfield surface, internal roads, car parks and electrical power and lighting were set up. The inaugural flight from Dublin took place on 19 January 1940 to Liverpool. In August 1938, work began on a new airport terminal building. The terminal building was designed by architect Desmond FitzGerald, brother of politician Garret FitzGerald. FitzGerald, who had designed an airport terminal as part of his college studies, led a team of architects that also included Kevin Barry, Daithí Hanley, Charles Aliaga Kelly, Dermot O&#x27;Toole and Harry Robson. The terminal building opened in early 1941, with its design heavily influenced by the tiered structure of the luxury ocean liners of the time. The terminal was awarded the Triennial Gold Medal of the Royal Hibernian Institute of Architects in 1942 and is today a listed building.
Due to World War II, which was known as The Emergency in Ireland, services were severely restricted at Dublin Airport until late 1945. The only international scheduled routes operated during this time were by Aer Lingus to Liverpool (and for a period to Manchester&#x27;s Barton Aerodrome). The end of the war meant the beginning of a major expansion in services at the airport. Aer Lingus resumed its London service to Croydon in November 1945. In 1947, KLM started the first European flights to Dublin with a service to Amsterdam. Three new concrete runways were completed in 1948, and in 1950 - after ten years in operation - the airport had welcomed a total of 920,000 passengers.

===Expanding in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s===
Throughout the 1950s Dublin Airport expanded with virtually uninterrupted traffic growth. Runway extensions and terminal enhancements were carried out to deal with the influx of traffic and passengers. New airlines began serving the airport also. These included British European Airways, Sabena, and BKS.

In 1958, a new transatlantic service was started by Aer Lingus via Shannon Airport. By the mid-1950s, it was clear that the original terminal building was too small to cope with growing passenger numbers. A new North Terminal was opened in June 1959. Originally, the plan was that North Terminal would handle all US and European flights, but instead, it became the arrivals terminal for all Dublin Airport passengers, while the original passenger terminal was used for departures.

During the 1960s, the number of scheduled carriers continued to grow. By the close of the 1960s, a sizeable number of Boeing 737s, BAC One-Elevens, Boeing 707s and Hawker Siddeley Tridents were using the airport regularly. In the late 1960s new departure gate piers were added close to the old terminal to cope with larger aircraft. These piers would subsequently be connected to Terminal 1. During 1969, the airport handled 1,737,151 passengers. 

In his 1969 book &quot;Irish Pubs of Character&quot;, Roy Bulson describes the restaurant in Dublin airport as &quot;one of the best airport restaurants in Europe&quot; which served a table d&#x27;hôte lunch from noon until 3 pm, and hosted regular Saturday night dinner dances from October until April which had become very popular by that point. The airport bar, &quot;The Shamrock Lounge&quot;, operated from 7 am until 10:30 pm and included a cocktail bar from which the patron could watch the arrival and departure of aircraft. A separate premises named the &quot;Fáilte Bar&quot; existed in the arrivals building.
The advent of wide-body aircraft posed opportunities and challenges for aviation. In 1971, Aer Lingus took delivery of two new Boeing 747 aircraft; the first one arrived in March and, shortly afterwards, performed a flyover above O&#x27;Connell Street in Dublin on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day; a third Boeing 747 was delivered later that decade. To cope with this, a new £10 million passenger terminal capable of handling six million passengers per year, which became known as Terminal 1, was opened in June 1972. The growth which was anticipated at Dublin&#x27;s airport (and provided for through heavy investment by the airport and Aer Lingus) during the 1970s did not materialise immediately.

On 30 November 1975, one person was killed and eight others were injured when the airport was bombed by the Ulster Defence Association.


===Continuing in the 1980s and 1990s===
In 1983 Aer Lingus opened its &#x27;Aer Lingus Commuter&#x27; division which took delivery of Shorts, Saab AB and Fokker turboprop aircraft to open regular daily domestic services to and from Ireland&#x27;s smaller regional airports for the first time, as well as to serve existing routes to smaller regional airports in the United Kingdom. At various stages of its operations, flights were operated to several Irish regional airports to feed passengers into Aer Lingus&#x27;s international network. These domestic destinations included Cork Airport, Shannon Airport (the &quot;Shannon stopover&quot;), Kerry Airport, Galway Airport, Ireland West Airport, Waterford Airport, Sligo Airport and City of Derry Airport. Aer Lingus Commuter has since been re-absorbed into the main company. The domestic routes, with the exception of Dublin-Shannon, were taken over by Aer Arann. Most of these routes have since been discontinued as the development of the motorway network in Ireland has resulted in significant reductions in travelling time by road. Aer Lingus has continued with the remaining Dublin–UK flights.

During the 1980s, major competition, especially on the Dublin–London routes, resulted in passenger numbers swelling to 5.1 million in 1989. In the same year a new runway and a state-of-the-art air traffic control centre were opened. Dublin Airport continued to expand rapidly in the 1990s, with 5.5 million passengers in 1991. Pier A, which had been the first extension to the old terminal building, was significantly extended. A new Pier C, complete with air bridges, was built and as soon as this was completed, work commenced to extend it to double its capacity. The ground floor of the original terminal building was returned to passenger service after many years to provide additional departure gates. Pier D, completed in October 2007, is a dedicated low-fares boarding area and provides 14 quick turn-around stands and departure gates; these are not served by air bridges.

===The Bilateral Air Transport Agreement===
In 1993, a major milestone for the airport was the signing of a new United States – Ireland bilateral agreement which allowed airlines to operate some direct transatlantic services for the first time to/from Dublin Airport instead of touching down en route at Shannon Airport on the west coast of Ireland. (Shannon had once been a major transatlantic refuelling stop for pre-jet aircraft, and this agreement was designed to protect the interests of the Shannon region when modern jets no longer required a refuelling stop and Shannon saw a fall-off in traffic.) Airlines still had to provide an equal number of flights either to or through Shannon as to Dublin. A gradual further watering down of Shannon&#x27;s so-called &#x27;stopover&#x27; status came into effect in November 2006 when more direct flights to Dublin were allowed. The stopover requirement disappeared completely in 2008. At that time, airlines were allowed to fly direct to the US from Dublin without having to match these with any to/from Shannon. It was expected that this would result in a huge increase in services between Dublin and the US and Aer Lingus identified 16 destinations that it would like to serve directly from Dublin.

===Recent history===
With the success of Ireland&#x27;s &#x27;Celtic Tiger&#x27; economy, Dublin Airport saw growth in the 1990s and 2000s. This demand was driven by an increased demand for business travel to and from the country, together with an increase in inward tourism and a surge in demand for foreign holidays and city breaks from the Irish.

The demand from Ireland&#x27;s migrant workers, principally those from Eastern Europe, has resulted in a large number of new routes opening to destinations in the European Union accession states. Ireland was one of only three European Union countries (as well as the United Kingdom and Sweden) to open its borders freely to workers from the ten accession states that joined the European Union in 2004.

In 2007 the then shortest runway, 11/29, was closed and converted to an aircraft storage area. This runway would subsequently be demolished for the construction of a second long runway parallel to 10/28.

The airport saw significant declines in traffic in 2009 and 2010, although since 2011 the airport has seen an increase in traffic. During 2012, this increase continued with passenger numbers growing by 1.9%. During 2013, passenger numbers at Dublin Airport were above the 20 million mark for the first time since 2009 with a 5.6% increase year on year. During 2014, this positive trend continued with an 8% increase over 2013. As of early December 2015, passenger figures have increased by 16% compared to 2014, and the previous record of 23.46 million passengers set in 2008 has already been passed. 2019 was the airport&#x27;s busiest year, recording 32.9 million passengers - an increase in passenger numbers by 4% during the year. Long-haul passenger numbers increased by 4% to almost 5.2 million, while Short-haul traffic increased by 5% to 27.7 million.

In August 2019, Dublin Airport was chosen for the Special Achievement in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) award for its use of mapping software from ESRI Ireland.

Due to the pandemic and its impact, the airport lost 115 routes, as in January 2021, it scheduled flights to just 85 cities, down from 200 before the crisis began.

On several separate days in early 2023, reports of drone sightings at the airport led to the delay and cancellation of several flights. On 4 February 2023, for example, flights were disrupted for 45 minutes after two confirmed drone sightings. And, on 6 February 2023, flights were impacted for approximately 40 minutes. As it is illegal to operate a drone within 5 kilometers of an Irish airfield, DAA called for the Garda Síochana to introduce a counter-drone system and for the government to increase sentences for offenders. Ryanair also called for the government to take immediate action. One man was arrested later in February 2023, and was charged under the Air Navigation and Transport Act. As of April 2024, two men had been charged and due to be tried, separately, for allegedly flying drones near the airport.

==Long-haul traffic==
As of August 2019, there are services to 31 intercontinental destinations from Dublin Airport (not including Anatolia). In 2007, Etihad Airways began operating between Dublin Airport and Abu Dhabi, and increased its capacity to 14 weekly flights in March 2010. In addition, Emirates has served Dublin from Dubai since January 2012. A total of 22 cities in North America are connected directly to Dublin Airport by seven airlines. In 2015, Ethiopian Airlines began serving Dublin from Addis Ababa, thus inaugurating the first direct air link between Ireland and Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2017, Qatar Airways commenced a daily service to Dublin Airport from Doha.

===Services to East Asia===

The Government of Ireland, owner of Dublin Airport, and the Dublin Airport Authority, its operator, have long sought to connect Dublin with East Asia by direct air service. Their plans were realized in 2018 when Cathay Pacific launched 4 weekly direct flights between Dublin and Hong Kong. This was followed by services to Beijing-Capital (via Edinburgh) and Shenzhen (nonstop), launched by Hainan Airlines in June 2018 and January 2019, respectively. In August 2019, however, Hainan Airlines withdrew from Dublin entirely. In September, due to the ongoing political unrest in Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific restricted its previously year-round Hong Kong route to the summer season only.

===Shannon Stopover and Open Skies===
In the mid twentieth century, the Irish government introduced a rule stating that all air traffic between Ireland and the United States must transit through Shannon Airport. In return, the United States government placed a limit of four airports in the US that Aer Lingus could operate to. On 22 March 2007, the Open skies agreement between the US and EU was ratified. This resulted in the immediate cancellation of the long-running &#x27;Shannon Stopover&#x27; requirement, whereby the Irish government had insisted that 50% of all transatlantic flights between Ireland and the United States must pass through Shannon Airport.

===US border preclearance===
Dublin Airport is one of only two airports in Europe, and three outside the Americas, with United States border preclearance services for US-bound passengers (the other airports are Ireland&#x27;s Shannon Airport and Abu Dhabi International Airport in the United Arab Emirates). Those traveling on nonstop flights to the United States complete immigration and customs procedures in Dublin prior to their departure, and are treated as domestic passengers on arrival.

==Aer Rianta and DAA/Dublin Airport Authority==
In October 2004, Aer Rianta (which is the Irish for &#x27;Air Ways&#x27; or &#x27;Air Tracks&#x27;) was renamed Dublin Airport Authority plc, a result of the State Airports Act 2004. All assets and liabilities previously owned by Aer Rianta were transferred to Dublin Airport Authority. The State Airports Act 2004 also established new airport authorities at Shannon and Cork Airports. The Shannon Airport Authority and the Cork Airport Authority had separate boards of directors and were authorised under the Act to prepare business plans, which may have in time lead to their full separation from the Dublin Airport Authority. Following a decision by the Irish Government, Shannon Airport became a separate publicly owned airport on 31 December 2012.

In July 2013, the Dublin Airport Authority was officially renamed &quot;DAA plc&quot; by the Irish Government. The rename was principally to remove the &quot;Dublin&quot; and &quot;Authority&quot; elements of the name which were seen to have little relevance to the overall functions of DAA. The name change announced in July 2013 took effect on 6 November 2014.

As the largest gateway to Ireland, over 25 million passengers travelled through the airport in 2015, a 15% increase over the previous year. The main contributors to the growth in traffic in 2015 were the 23 new routes launched during the year and extra capacity on 40 existing services. Both long-haul and short-haul traffic increased by 15% in 2015. A record 8.9 million people travelled between Dublin Airport and Britain during 2015, which was a 14% increase on the previous year. Dublin Airport also welcomes more than one million passengers per annum from Northern Ireland and is a key international gateway for overseas visitors to Northern Ireland, whose largest airport is less than a quarter the size of Dublin in terms of passenger numbers.

==Passenger terminals==

===Terminal 1===

The current Terminal 1 building opened in 1972 was designed to handle five million passengers per year. The original design included a second pier which would have been identical to the current decagon-shaped boarding Pier B, but this was never built. A car park was originally located on the upper floor of the building and the access ramps are still in place but it was closed for security reasons in the 1970s and converted into offices. Terminal 1 has been regularly extended and improved over the last two decades. In October 2007, a new pier designed by Larry Oltmanns, while design director of the London office of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, who also designed graphics for its interior, was opened to the north of Terminal 1. This pier caters for the majority of Ryanair flights. In 2009, a new extension featuring new food and retail outlets was added to the side of Terminal 1. Terminal 1 is currently home to all airlines except Aer Lingus, American Airlines, British Airways, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Iberia Express, JetBlue, United Airlines and Vueling.

===Terminal 2===

Terminal 2 is a 75,000 m2 (810,000 sq ft) terminal and pier (Pier E) which provides aircraft parking for 27 narrow body aircraft through 25 departure gates and 16 immigration desks which can handle up to 15 million passengers annually. The project was designed by Pascall+Watson architects and the total cost was €600 million. Aer Lingus is the main carrier operating at Terminal 2 and since its opening have developed a hub at Dublin primarily for traffic traveling between Europe and the United States. Terminal 2 is now the transatlantic gateway for flights to the United States as it features a US pre-clearance immigration facility which was previously housed in Terminal 1.

Construction of Terminal 2 began on 1 October 2007, and it was officially opened on 19 November 2010 by the then Taoiseach Brian Cowen T.D. The intended purpose of Terminal 2 was to house all long-haul carriers in addition to Aer Lingus; however significant growth in US traffic has resulted in most long haul carriers flying outside the United States remaining in Terminal 1. During the design of Terminal 2 provisions were made for an expanded check in hall and additional pier (Pier F) to cater for future growth. Terminal 2 is currently home to IAG airlines Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia Express and Vueling, and U.S. carriers American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue and United Airlines. Emirates also operates from the terminal.

==Safety and security==

DAA has its own branch of the Airport Police Service which is mandated to provide aviation and general policing at the airport. The Airport Police Station is centrally located on the Arrivals road between Terminals 1 and 2. The airport also has its own Airport Fire and Rescue Service which provides cover to the entire campus, its roadways and lands.

The Office of the Revenue Commissioners provide a customs service to both passenger and cargo terminals, while the Department of Agriculture also has a presence in the airport. Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service performs immigration checks on all international passengers arriving at the airport. The Gardaí also have a small sub-station located beside the old terminal.

In 2016 it was confirmed that Garda Armed Support Units (ASU) would be deployed overtly to patrol Dublin Airport and Dublin Port full-time on foot inside terminal buildings and via vehicles outside and surrounding the perimeter to counter the rising threat of terrorist attacks in Europe. The decision was made as a direct result of the 2016 Brussels bombings in Belgium.

==Maintenance facilities==
Aer Lingus, Ryanair, CityJet, Eirtech and Dublin Aerospace have aircraft maintenance hangars and facilities at Dublin Airport.

==Other facilities==
Our Lady Queen of Heaven, a Catholic church built in 1964, is in the airport.

==Airport developments==
===New air traffic control complex===

The construction of a new control complex was required, as the location, height and visibility of the existing tower would be inadequate to operate the planned 10L/28R Runway.

The new complex opened on 15 June 2022. At nearly high, it is the tallest inhabited structure in Ireland. It has space for twelve operators as opposed to the five of the previous tower and a 360 degree view of the Airport and its surroundings. The new complex will be ideal for simultaneous operation of 10R/28L and 10L/28R.

The old control complex will become a contingent tower in case of emergency.

===New runway===
After a delay of several years due to the global financial crisis and predictions of falling consumer demand, it was announced in April 2016 that a new runway would start construction in 2017 and to be completed by 2021.

On 8 October 2020, the existing runway 10/28 was redesignated as 10R/28L in anticipation of the new runway becoming 10L/28R.

The new runway measuring opened on 24 August 2022 parallel to the existing runway 10R/28L, which opened (as runway 10/28) in 1989. Planning permission for the runway was originally granted in August 2007, with 31 planning conditions attached. The new runway runs parallel to the north of runway 10R/28L and allows the airport to accommodate 30 million passengers annually, at a length of . In March 2009 the DAA announced in a proposal for consultation that the new runway may be built to a length of following consultation with potential long-haul carriers. A runway of this length would allow direct flights from Dublin to the Far East. The runway cost in the region of €320 million. The airport also has invested heavily in extending aprons and creating rapid exit taxiways to derive maximum efficiency from the existing main runway. Runway 16/34 is most often used in the evening, depending on airport construction. In the day, 16/34 is generally used as a taxiway for aircraft utilizing runway 10R/28L. The first flight on the new runway was Ryanair flight FR1964 to Eindhoven at 11:00 UTC on 24 August 2022.

===Future developments===
A number of infrastructure additions and improvements are planned for the airport in the coming years, including two new passenger piers, expanded aircraft parking and apron facilities, an airside tunnel which will link the terminal area with remote stands and an expanded United States border preclearance facility.

===Proposed third terminal===
Developers have proposed the development of a new terminal to the west of the existing terminal campus. The land owners and DAA have to date been unable to come to an agreement on the development of the land and discussions are ongoing.

==Statistics==

===Passenger numbers===
Passenger numbers at Dublin Airport increased every year during the 10 years between 1998 and 2008, from around 11.6 million to over 23.4 million. Passenger numbers fell however during the subsequent two years to around 18.4 million in 2010, with a small increase to 18.7 million in 2011 and 19.1 million in 2012, then 2013 saw a significant increase of 5.6% to 20.2 million. In 2014, passenger numbers increased by almost 8% to over 21.7 million. Traffic growth of over 15% during 2015 resulted in passenger numbers exceeding 25 million for the first time. The previous record of 23.46 million (set in 2008) was exceeded during the first week of December 2015.

===Busiest routes===

==Ground transport==

Dublin Airport is located just off the M1 and the M50 north from the city centre and south of the town of Swords. There is no rail link to Dublin city centre, and the public transport options to the city are taxis, buses and private transport.

===Bus services===
Dublin Airport is served by a large network of bus and coach routes, serving both the wider Dublin area and the rest of Ireland. More than 700 buses a day service Dublin Airport. In addition, Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland run local stopping services that serve such residential areas as Santry, Swords, Rathfarnham, Ballinteer, Sutton, Malahide, Beaumont, Harold&#x27;s Cross, Terenure, Drumcondra, Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush and Portmarnock.

Aircoach offers a number of coach services from the Airport to the Dublin area, serving both the city centre and surrounding areas including Leopardstown, Sandyford, Bray and Dún Laoghaire.

Dublin Coach links Portlaoise and Red Cow Luas to Dublin Airport.

Dublin Express runs non-stop coach services to the city centre via the Port Tunnel, offering interchange with the rail network at Tara Street station as well as serving other city centre destinations such as Heuston Station the main railway station connecting to Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway etc.

Bus Éireann has 18 routes from Dublin Airport to places such as Waterford, Drogheda and Dundalk Ulsterbus Goldline offer cross-border bus services to Belfast. Translink solely operate services to Derry via either Monaghan and Omagh, or Armagh and Cookstown respectively.

Aircoach runs longer distance services to Cork City and Belfast, whilst Citylink and Gobus offer services to Galway, Éirebus and JJ Kavanagh operate regular services to Carlow, Limerick, Kilkenny and Waterford. Wexfordbus connects the airport with Wexford, and John McGinley Coaches also connects the airport with Donegal ending in Annagry.

===Taxi===
Taxis are available at taxi ranks located directly outside of Terminal 1 and Terminal 2.

===Rail===
There is no direct rail connection to Dublin Airport. However, &quot;Iarnród Éireann&quot; (Irish Rail) provide suburban and intercity railway services from Dublin Connolly and Dublin Heuston railway stations, and there are regular bus services from both stations to the airport. Some city bus services serve Drumcondra suburban railway station, which is on the Connolly to Maynooth railway line while the 102 route connects Dublin Airport to Sutton DART station. Bus services to Busáras/Dublin Connolly and Dublin Heuston railway stations connect with the Luas Red Line.

====Proposed rail link====
For many years, it was expected that Iarnród Éireann would extend the Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) to serve the airport. These plans were replaced with a proposal for an underground metro line, which would run from the city centre to Swords via the airport. The route for the line, initially known as Metro North, was announced in October 2006 and was proposed to connect with several other modes of transport. In 2011, it was announced that the Metro North plan would be deferred due to a lack of funding. As of July 2022, the project had been renamed to MetroLink and proposed to begin construction in and that, &quot;all going well&quot; it could be in operation by 2035.

<text>The Arisaka rifle () is a family of Japanese military bolt-action service rifles, which were produced and used since approximately 1897, when it replaced the Murata rifle (, ) family, until the end of World War II in 1945. The most common models include the Type 38 chambered for the 6.5×50mmSR Type 38 cartridge, and the Type 99 chambered for the 7.7×58mm Type 99 cartridge, which is comparable in power to a modern .308 Winchester round.

==History==


The Arisaka rifle was designed under the supervision of Colonel Arisaka Nariakira (; 1852–1915), who was later promoted to lieutenant general and also received the title of baron from Emperor Meiji, in 1907. The design was similar to, and may have been influenced by the German Rifle Test Commission 8mm Model 1888 bolt-action rifle, which was based on the earlier Mauser design. Over the course of several wars, the rifle went through multiple production runs, during which several variants were developed, including the transition from the 6.5mm Type 38 cartridge to the larger 7.7mm Type 99, as well as the introduction of a paratrooper rifle that could be broken down into two major parts for easier storage during airborne operations. Post war testing of Arisaka rifles revealed that their bolts and receivers were constructed of carbon steel &quot;similar to SAE steel grade No. 1085 with a carbon content of 0.80% to 0.90%, and a manganese content of 0.60% to 0.90%.&quot; During destructive stress tests, the Arisaka rifles were shown to be stronger than the American made M1903 Springfield, British made Lee–Enfield, and German Mauser rifles. The Arisaka rifles were also one of the only firearms of the era to use polygonal rifling in its barrel, rather than lands and grooves.

Some of the early issue Type 99 rifles were fitted with a folding wire monopod intended to improve accuracy in the prone position. The rear sights also featured folding horizontal extensions to give a degree of lead suitable for firing at aircraft. Near the end of World War II, ersatz models were manufactured with various cost-cutting measures, with the goal of cheaply bolstering the imperial armed forces. Some of these cost cutting measures included the replacement of the ovoid bulb-shaped bolt of earlier runs with a smaller, more utilitarian cylindrical shape. Additionally, the hand guard on the barrel was omitted, and crude fixed sights were fitted to the weapon.

The Arisaka bolt-action service rifle was used everywhere in the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy. Prior to World War II, Arisakas were used by the Royal Navy and Russian Army, in Finland and Albania. The Czech Legions that fought in the Russian Revolution were almost entirely armed with Type 30 and 38 Arisaka rifles. Many captured rifles were employed by neighboring countries both during and after World War II, by nations such as China, Thailand and Cambodia. After the Japanese surrender from World War II in the summer of 1945, the manufacture of Arisaka rifles and ammunition stopped abruptly, quickly becoming obsolete. As most weapons from the Imperial Japanese Armory were thrown into Tokyo Harbor after the signing of the surrender, ammunition for the Arisaka rifle also became rare, although China continued to manufacture 6.5×50mmSR and 7.7×58mm for use in their captured rifles.

The imperial ownership seal, a 16-petal chrysanthemum known as the Chrysanthemum Flower Seal stamped upon the top of the receiver in all official imperial-issue rifles, has often been defaced by filing, grinding, or stamping on surviving examples. While there are conflicting claims that this was done on the orders of the Imperial Japanese Military prior to surrender, it is generally accepted by most historians that the imperial chrysanthemums were ground off the rifles on the orders from General Douglas MacArthur, the commander of occupation forces at that time. To date, no documentation from either Japanese or U.S. forces has been found that required the defacing. Most of the Arisakas with surviving insignia are in Japan, though there are a few remaining on samples taken as war trophies before the surrender, and those captured by Chinese forces. Some of the captured Sino Arisakas were later exported to the United States, examples including a number of Type 38 carbines and Type 44 carbines rebarrelled and rechambered for the 7.62×39mm round. Some Type 38 rifles and Type 99 rifles captured by the Kuomintang forces were also converted to fire the 7.92×57mm Mauser round.

Many of the Chrysanthemum Seals were completely ground off, although some were only defaced with a chisel, scratched off, or had the number &quot;0&quot; stamped repeatedly along the edges. The latter was usually done with rifles removed from Japanese military service (and thus no longer the emperor&#x27;s property), including rifles given to schools or sold to other nations, such as the British Royal Navy&#x27;s purchase of many Type 38s in World War I to free up SMLE rifles for their land forces.

A very small run of Type 38 rifles was also manufactured for export to Mexico in 1910, with the Mexican coat of arms instead of the imperial chrysanthemum, though few arrived before the Mexican Revolution and the bulk remained in Japan until World War I, when they were sold to Imperial Russia.

Many thousands of Type 99s and other Arisaka variants were brought to the United States by Army soldiers and Marines as war trophies during and after World War II.

==Models==





===Type 30===

First rifle of the Arisaka series. Chambered in 6.5×50mmSR Type 30. 554,000 built.

====Type 30 carbine====
Carbine variant of the Type 30; 300 mm shorter. 45,000 built.

====Type 35====

Officially designated as &quot;Type 35 navy rifle&quot;. Also in 6.5×50mmSR Type 30.

Design overhaul based on the Type 30 for the Imperial Japanese Navy Land Forces by Major Nambu Kijirō. Changes include tangent type rear sight, separate sliding bolt cover (as opposed to simultaneously moving ones on all other types after) of the same type later used on the Siamese Mauser style rifle, hook safety replaced with a large knob cocking piece to protect from gases in case of a blown primer, larger bolt handle knob, improved bolt head, gas port in bolt body, and improved chamber configuration for better cartridge feeding.

===Type 38===

Developed by Major Nambu Kijirō. Chambered in 6.5×50mmSR Type 38, Type 30 cartridge is also usable. A short variant exists for ease of handling, its length is between the basic rifle and the carbine.

One of the most produced and commonly encountered model. Designed in 1905 and simultaneously produced until 1942 with 3,400,000 built.

====Type 38 carbine====

Carbine variant of the Type 38; 300 mm shorter. Also fielded by support personnel.

===Type 44 carbine===

Carbine derived from the Type 38 rifle. Chambered in 6.5×50mmSR Type 38, Type 30 cartridge is also usable. Distinguishing features are its folding spike bayonet and two-piece takedown cleaning rods concealed within the buttstock. Originally intended for the cavalry, also used by other support personnel.

===Type 97 sniper rifle===

One of the two main sniper rifles in imperial military service. Based on the Type 38 rifle. Chambered in 6.5×50mmSR Type 38, but more commonly used &quot;reduced charge cartridges&quot; associated with the Type 11 and 96 light machine guns for lighter recoil, reduced report, camouflaged muzzle flash, and overall accuracy. Uses factory-zeroed Type 97 telescopic sight (2.5X).

About 22,500 built.

===Type 99===

Successor to the Type 38 rifle. Chambered in 7.7×58mm Type 99, later rimless variants of the Type 92 and 97 cartridges also usable.

Designed in 1939, then produced and fielded from 1941 to 1945, the Type 99 was the most common Imperial Japanese service rifle of World War II and second most produced imperial rifle with 2,500,000 built. Significant changes are the improvement of the rear sight form transitioning from a V-notch type like those on a Type 38, to an aperture, the front sight blade was renewed to a triangular shape, chrome-lined barrels were used, and on earlier productions, the rear sight was equipped with anti-aircraft calipers.

Sub-variations included a long rifle (approximately only 38,000 made), and short rifle; former being 1258 mm in total and latter being 1118 mm. The short rifle also varied in quality from initial, intermediate, to last-ditch.

====Type 99 sniper rifle====

The other sniper rifle of the Imperial Japanese Military. Built on both the long and short models with the latter being higher in number. Chambered in 7.7×58mm Type 99, later rimless variants of the Type 92 and 97 cartridges also usable. The larger, more powerful caliber allowed the ballistics to be less affected by windage at the cost of stronger recoil. Two different types of scopes were issued to the rifles: the Type 97 2.5X telescopic scope, or the Type 99 4X telescopic scope. Later production of the Type 99 scope allowed for distance adjustment. Scopes were issued with their respective holsters and were often detached from the rifle and placed within them while advancing.

By doctrine, snipers of the imperial military were selected by their skill in marksmanship. The caliber of the rifle assigned to a sniper corresponded with the ammunition of the company he served under.

Production began in May 1942. Total number made is approximately 10,000.

===TERA===

A small series of takedown rifles produced for the imperial army paratroopers and imperial navy paratroopers. The only production model is the Type 2 based on the Type 99 short rifle; the rest are two proto-test types (Type 100 and Type 1). The Type 2 is chambered in 7.7×58mm Type 99, later rimless variants of the Type 92 and 97 cartridges also usable.

The Type 2 allowed for compact storage by breaking down to two pieces: the stock and action, and barrel and handguard.

About a total of 19,000 were produced from 1942 to 1944.

==Bayonets==
===Type 30===
Created simultaneously with the Type 30 rifle, this sword-type bayonet is compatible with all variants of the Arisaka rifle except for the Type 44 carbine. Twenty different variations exist, and is further categorized by early, mid, and late-war production phases. Also fixable on Type 96 and 99 light machine guns.

===Type 35 bayonet===
The Type 35 bayonet is a slightly modified Type 30 bayonet made specifically for the Type 35 rifle. The dimensions of the bayonet are almost exactly the same as the Type 30 bayonet. The only significant difference between the two is the added addition of a sprung catch that hooks into the scabbard when not in use.

About 8,400,000 were made.

===Type 44===
Fixed permanently on the Type 44 carbine, this spike-type bayonet is foldable under the handguard and does not interfere with the barrel when deployed.

===Type 2===
With the long length of the Type 30 bayonet unfit for concealing within a paratrooper&#x27;s personal equipment set, this knife-type bayonet was created to address this issue. Twenty centimetres shorter than a Type 30, its total length is 32.3 cm. Used primarily with the Type 2 TERA rifle or the Type 100 submachine gun by the Imperial Military Airborne Divisions.

About 25,000 were made.

==Details==

As with all captured foreign firearms they may be dangerous when fired, due to both the lower quality of the &quot;last-ditch&quot; rifles produced during the end-half of World War II, and to modifications performed by returning U.S. servicemen on those rifles. Ammunition for the Arisaka series, which were often battlefield pick-ups, or souvenirs, were not readily available after the end of the war. Consequently, many were rebored or rechambered for readily available calibers of that time. Additionally, some were occasionally rendered inoperable prior to being shipped home, or even potentially sabotaged. The manner in which rifles may have been &quot;demilled&quot; can include permanently damaging the receiver or removal of parts.

Type 38s in particular were commonly rechambered to 6.5×.257 Roberts, a wildcat cartridge made using the readily available .257 Roberts cases with the neck expanded to use 6.5mm bullets specific to the already existing barrel. Likewise, the Type 99 in 7.7×58mm were known to be converted to .30-06 Springfield, which is again of similar but not identical dimensions. While the .30-06 can be fired by lengthening the chamber of the rifle slightly (from 58 to 63mm), the 7.7mm case is slightly wider than the .30-06 and uses a slightly larger-diameter bullet, meaning a .30–06 cartridge case will swell slightly to fit the oversized chamber, and a standard .30-06 bullet with a .308 diameter will not provide a good fit to the .310–312 diameter rifling.

Those seeking ammunition for their Type 99 rifles often manufacture it by modifying .30–06 cases. The German 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge may also be used with the proper .311 diameter bullet. The widely available British .303 bullets also provide a proper fit for the firearm&#x27;s rifling. Norma currently manufactures stock 7.7×58mm ammunition, as well as making new brass available for reloaders. Hornady also produces new Arisaka ammunition in both 6.5mm and 7.7mm calibers. Since the base of the 7.7mm case is slightly larger than the .30-06 (thereby causing varying amounts of bulging in the reformed brass), some owners may find it preferable to use proper brass or new factory cartridges. Bullets and powder charges of surplus .303 British ammunition may also be loaded into proper 7.7×58mm cases to produce rifle cartridges with ballistics that are similar to the original Japanese military load.

<text>In mathematics, a subset of a given set is closed under an operation of the larger set if performing that operation on members of the subset always produces a member of that subset. For example, the natural numbers are closed under addition, but not under subtraction: is not a natural number, although both 1 and 2 are. 

Similarly, a subset is said to be closed under a &quot;collection&quot; of operations if it is closed under each of the operations individually.

The closure of a subset is the result of a closure operator applied to the subset. The &quot;closure&quot; of a subset under some operations is the smallest superset that is closed under these operations. It is often called the &quot;span&quot; (for example linear span) or the &quot;generated set&quot;.

==Definitions==
Let be a set equipped with one or several methods for producing elements of from other elements of .
A subset of is said to be &quot;closed&quot; under these methods, if, when all input elements are in , then all possible results are also in . Sometimes, one may also say that has the .

The main property of closed sets, which results immediately from the definition, is that every intersection of closed sets is a closed set. It follows that for every subset of , there is a smallest closed subset of such that formula_1 (it is the intersection of all closed subsets that contain ). Depending on the context, is called the &quot;closure&quot; of or the set generated or spanned by .

The concepts of closed sets and closure are often extended to any property of subsets that are stable under intersection; that is, every intersection of subsets that have the property has also the property. For example, in formula_2 a &quot;Zariski-closed set&quot;, also known as an algebraic set, is the set of the common zeros of a family of polynomials, and the Zariski closure of a set of points is the smallest algebraic set that contains .

===In algebraic structures===
An algebraic structure is a set equipped with operations that satisfy some axioms. These axioms may be identities. Some axioms may contain existential quantifiers formula_3 in this case it is worth to add some auxiliary operations in order that all axioms become identities or purely universally quantified formulas. See Algebraic structure for details. A set with a single binary operation that is closed is called a magma.

In this context, given an algebraic structure , a substructure of is a subset that is closed under all operations of , including the auxiliary operations that are needed for avoiding existential quantifiers. A substructure is an algebraic structure of the same type as . It follows that, in a specific example, when closeness is proved, there is no need to check the axioms for proving that a substructure is a structure of the same type.

Given a subset of an algebraic structure , the closure of is the smallest substructure of that is closed under all operations of . In the context of algebraic structures, this closure is generally called the substructure &quot;generated&quot; or &quot;spanned&quot; by , and one says that is a generating set of the substructure. 

For example, a group is a set with an associative operation, often called &quot;multiplication&quot;, with an identity element, such that every element has an inverse element. Here, the auxiliary operations are the nullary operation that results in the identity element and the unary operation of inversion. A subset of a group that is closed under multiplication and inversion is also closed under the nullary operation (that is, it contains the identity) if and only if it is non-empty. So, a non-empty subset of a group that is closed under multiplication and inversion is a group that is called a subgroup. The subgroup generated by a single element, that is, the closure of this element, is called a cyclic group.

In linear algebra, the closure of a non-empty subset of a vector space (under vector-space operations, that is, addition and scalar multiplication) is the linear span of this subset. It is a vector space by the preceding general result, and it can be proved easily that is the set of linear combinations of elements of the subset.

Similar examples can be given for almost every algebraic structures, with, sometimes some specific terminology. For example, in a commutative ring, the closure of a single element under ideal operations is called a principal ideal.

==Binary relations==
A binary relation on a set can be defined as a subset of formula_4 the set of the ordered pairs of elements of . The notation formula_5 is commonly used for formula_6 Many properties or operations on relations can be used to define closures. Some of the most common ones follow:

;Reflexivity 
:A relation on the set is &quot;reflexive&quot; if formula_7 for every formula_8 As every intersection of reflexive relations is reflexive, this defines a closure. The reflexive closure of a relation is thus formula_9
;Symmetry
:Symmetry is the unary operation on formula_10 that maps formula_11 to formula_12 A relation is &quot;symmetric&quot; if it is closed under this operation, and the symmetric closure of a relation is its closure under this relation.
;Transitivity
:Transitivity is defined by the partial binary operation on formula_10 that maps formula_11 and formula_15 to formula_16 A relation is &quot;transitive&quot; if it is closed under this operation, and the transitive closure of a relation is its closure under this operation.

A preorder is a relation that is reflective and transitive. It follows that the reflexive transitive closure of a relation is the smallest preorder containing it. Similarly, the reflexive transitive symmetric closure or equivalence closure of a relation is the smallest equivalence relation that contains it.

==Other examples==
* In matroid theory, the closure of &quot;X&quot; is the largest superset of &quot;X&quot; that has the same rank as &quot;X&quot;.
* The transitive closure of a set.
* The algebraic closure of a field.
* The integral closure of an integral domain in a field that contains it.
* The radical of an ideal in a commutative ring.
* In geometry, the convex hull of a set &quot;S&quot; of points is the smallest convex set of which &quot;S&quot; is a subset.
* In formal languages, the Kleene closure of a language can be described as the set of strings that can be made by concatenating zero or more strings from that language.
* In group theory, the conjugate closure or normal closure of a set of group elements is the smallest normal subgroup containing the set.
* In mathematical analysis and in probability theory, the closure of a collection of subsets of &quot;X&quot; under countably many set operations is called the σ-algebra generated by the collection.

==Closure operator==

In the preceding sections, closures are considered for subsets of a given set. The subsets of a set form a partially ordered set (poset) for inclusion. &quot;Closure operators&quot; allow generalizing the concept of closure to any partially ordered set.

Given a poset whose partial order is denoted with , a &quot;closure operator&quot; on is a function formula_17 that is
* &quot;increasing&quot; (formula_18 for all formula_19), 
* idempotent (formula_20), and 
* monotonic (formula_21).

Equivalently, a function from to is a closure operator if formula_22 for all formula_23

An element of is &quot;closed&quot; if it is its own closure, that is, if formula_24 By idempotency, an element is closed if and only if it is the closure of some element of .

An example is the topological closure operator; in Kuratowski&#x27;s characterization, axioms K2, K3, K4&#x27; correspond to the above defining properties. An example not operating on subsets is the ceiling function, which maps every real number to the smallest integer that is not smaller than .

===Closure operator vs. closed sets===
A closure on the subsets of a given set may be defined either by a closure operator or by a set of closed sets that is stable under intersection and includes the given set. These two definitions are equivalent. 

Indeed, the defining properties of a closure operator implies that an intersection of closed sets is closed: if formula_25 is an intersection of closed sets, then formula_26 must contain and be contained in every formula_27 This implies formula_28 by definition of the intersection.

Conversely, if closed sets are given and every intersection of closed sets is closed, then one can define a closure operator such that formula_26 is the intersection of the closed sets containing .

This equivalence remains true for partially ordered sets with the greatest-lower-bound property, if one replace &quot;closed sets&quot; by &quot;closed elements&quot; and &quot;intersection&quot; by &quot;greatest lower bound&quot;.

<text>Cork Airport () is the second-largest international airport in Ireland, after Dublin and ahead of Shannon. It is south of Cork City centre, in an area known as Farmers Cross. In 2018, Cork Airport handled 2.39 million passengers, growing by over 8% to 2.58 million in 2019. Following a decline during the COVID-19 global pandemic, which saw passenger numbers fall to 530,000 in 2020, numbers in 2022 rose to 2.24 million.

Cork is the state&#x27;s second-busiest airport in terms of passenger numbers, after Dublin, and third busiest on the island of Ireland, after Dublin and Belfast International.

==History==

===1957 to 1980===
In 1957, the Government of Ireland agreed in principle to the building of an airport for Cork. After considering many sites in the area, it was agreed that the airport should be built at Ballygarvan. Tenders were invited for the construction of the airport in 1959 at an estimated cost of £1 million. The airport was officially opened on 16 October 1961, following proving flights four days earlier by Aer Lingus and Cambrian Airways. In its first year the airport handled 10,172 passengers – close to the average number of passengers handled each day at the airport in 2007. Throughout the 1960s the airport expanded with the arrival of more advanced aircraft and more destinations. The first jet, a British Overseas Airways Corporation Comet, landed at Cork Airport on 29 March 1964. By 1969 Aer Lingus was operating to London Heathrow, Manchester and Bristol.

In 1975, Aer Rianta, the then state airports authority, undertook a passenger terminal study aimed at improving the terminal facilities. The findings resulted in the provision, over the next two years, of new departure and arrival halls, a new check-in area, office complex, information desk, duty office and executive lounge. The new extensions and facilities were opened in 1978.

===1980 to 2000===
The 1980s began with an extension of the main apron. New services to London Gatwick began, while Aer Lingus&#x27; commuter division started a new domestic service to Dublin Airport. In 1985 following significant growth, Aer Rianta carried out a survey of the terminal facilities with a view to carrying out a major expansion and development programme. On 8 June 1987, Ryanair commenced services at Cork Airport. The following year, Phase I of the Terminal Expansion and Development Plan was completed. The following year the main runway extension of was opened.

The 1990s began with the completion of Phase II of the terminal expansion in 1991 and Phase III being completed in 1992 with the plan being brought to completion in 1994.

===2000 to 2010===

A Great Southern Hotel was opened on the airport grounds during 2001, and plans were drawn up for the construction of a new terminal building and ancillary capital investment works at an estimated cost of €140 million. Also towards the end of 2001, new Irish regional airline Aer Arann opened its second base at Cork opening new routes to/from the airport.

Along with the construction of the terminal, roads were upgraded from single to dual carriageway and re-aligned, and a new short term multi-storey car park was constructed. Airbridges were included in the original terminal design, however only one airbridge was built because airline representatives from the low-cost carriers who use Cork Airport made it clear that they did not want airbridges, would not use them and would not pay for them. In the circumstances, the DAA removed the airbridges from the terminal design during construction of the new facility. The new terminal was completed with four fixed links to the main building, and was designed to accommodate additional airbridges in future or if needed.

In 2005, Ryanair opened its 15th European base and second Irish base at Cork. The following year, the new terminal opened on 15 August 2006. Designed by HOK and Jacobs Engineering Group, the new terminal was the first built in Ireland in the 21st century.

In April 2008, the board of Cork Airport Authority agreed by one vote to accept responsibility for a debt of €113 million incurred by the Dublin Airport Authority in the redevelopment of Cork Airport to secure independence from Dublin Airport. This was despite government commitments that the Cork Airport Authority would be established on a debt-free basis. The Cork Airport Authority Board also stated that their strong reservations about the level of debt that Cork Airport was being levied with and the potential impact on its future sustainability. In late April 2008, Cork Airport Authority chairman, Joe Gantly, announced his resignation effective from the end of July 2008. Gerry Walsh replaced Gantly as chairman.

The Irish Aviation Authority completed a new control tower 1 km from the old terminal to the west of the main runway.
The total cost was €7.5 million and was funded entirely by the IAA with no government funding. Construction began in August 2007 and was completed in June 2008 but it took until mid October 2009 to get all the new systems tested and working. The new control tower officially opened on 20 October 2009 at 00:01.

===2010 to present===

On 22 May 2011, at around 16:30 a man entered a Garda Síochána vehicle in Cork City Centre and slashed the Garda in the vehicle with a knife. The Garda jumped from his vehicle and the man hijacked it, hitting a number of vehicles while driving to Cork Airport. At approximately 16:50 the vehicle rammed through a perimeter airport fence, before breaking down. The man abandoned the Garda vehicle and, again producing a knife, hijacked an Airport Fire Service vehicle. By this time Air Traffic Control had suspended all operations. The man drove erratically on the airport taxiway, driving underneath a stationary Thomas Cook aircraft at high speed. The man proceeded to ram several Garda and airport vehicles, before attempting to ram an Aer Lingus aircraft. The hijacked vehicle stalled, halting a short distance from the Airbus A320. Armed Gardaí subdued the man with a taser. Flights were resumed after the man was removed and the airport perimeter secured.

On 16 October 2011, Cork Airport celebrated its 50th anniversary.


In 2013, Cork Airport was placed first for overall customer satisfaction in a global survey of passengers carried out by Airports Council International. The survey measured customer satisfaction across eight categories in 61 regional airports worldwide, with Cork Airport scoring highest.

In 2014, the Airport met its public sector obligation of a 33% reduction in energy costs, 6 years earlier than their 2020 target, and were awarded first place in the public sector category at the Sustainable Energy Awards 2014.

In 2016, Cork Airport won the Corporate Campaign of the Year Prize at the EU Public Affairs Awards (EuroPAwards) in Brussels, primarily for its efforts to secure a direct transatlantic route. Also in 2016, Cork Airport became the first Irish airport to launch a no drone zone within 5 km of the airfield. The campaign was launched following a number of incidents involving drones or aircraft on approach or departure from aerodromes throughout Europe. Despite this campaign, at least two drones encroached airspace during April 2017. Norwegian Air Shuttle launched service to Providence, United States, in July 2017. This was Cork&#x27;s first transatlantic flight. 

The airport was named as &quot;Best Airport in Europe under 5 million passengers&quot; at the Airports Council International (ACI) Europe General Assembly in both 2017 and 2019.

==Geographical situation==
With an elevation of above sea level, Cork Airport is sometimes prone to fog and a low cloud ceiling. The Instrument landing system has been upgraded to Category II, and together with a extension of the main runway has significantly reduced the number of diversions. However, during times of severe inclement weather the airport can suffer from delays or diversions to airports such as Shannon, Dublin or Kerry. Similarly, diversions from these airports occasionally land at Cork.

The length of the main runway dictates that the airport cannot handle fully laden large widebody aircraft. Large wide-bodied aircraft do visit Cork Airport on an irregular basis, for example to operate ad-hoc charter services for flights to sporting events such as those of the Munster Rugby team.

==Operator==
From its opening in 1961, the airport was managed by the Department of Transport and Power, now the Department of Transport. Aer Rianta took control of Cork and Shannon Airports on 1 April 1969 and the assets of the airports were transferred to the company under the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act, 1998. The name of Aer Rianta was changed to the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) under the &quot;State Airports Act 2004&quot;, which also created the Cork Airport Authority and the Shannon Airport Authority. These companies were charged with preparing a business plan in preparation for taking over the assets of their airports from the DAA.

Cork Airport is responsible for the infrastructure which enables airlines and handling agents at the airport. Aer Lingus provide their own aircraft ground handling services, while other airlines and private flights contract services to third party ground handlers (Swissport and Weston Aviation).

==Passenger facilities==
The main terminal at Cork Airport contains several shopping and eating facilities both before and after the security screening area, a bureau de change kiosk and ATM (cash machine) and a business lounge operated by Swissport. There are eight departure gates in the airport, two of which have an airbridge. Wi-Fi is available throughout the terminal.

There are two hotels located adjacent to the passenger terminal, the Cork International Hotel which is located in the business park, and the Cork Airport Hotel (previously branded Park Inn by Radisson) which is located opposite the terminal on airport grounds.

==Development plans==
In 2013, Cork Airport completed a Master Plan for the overall development of the airport until 2023.

This plan envisages that the cargo area, currently located to the north–east of the airport, would be moved to the south–east of the grounds, with the general aviation area transferred opposite the main runway at the south–west of airport. Using space from the removal of the cargo area, the main terminal could be extended northwards, potentially doubling the space for aircraft. The plan also calls for the old terminal to be demolished.

Parallel plans for transport infrastructure also exist, including upgrading the N27 to two lanes in each direction and a dedicated bus lane for city–bound traffic. The roundabout at the entrance of the airport would be enhanced with an under-pass.

In February 2017, it was announced that €4 million was to be invested at the airport for training, screening and restaurant facilities, with the existing restaurant moving from landside to airside.

In November 2020, it was announced that Cork Airport was bringing forward its plans to rebuild and refurbish its main runway from Q4 2022/Q1 2023 to Q3 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on its traffic.

<doc id="293807" wikidata="Q795487" url="?curid=293807" title="BA Connect">
<text>BA Connect was a regional airline and a wholly-owned subsidiary airline of British Airways. It was headquartered in Didsbury, Manchester, England, it operated a network of domestic and European services from a number of airports in the United Kingdom on behalf of British Airways. The airline operated as a low-cost carrier, with food sold via a &#x27;buy on board&#x27; programme (except for flights to London City Airport).

On 3 November 2006, British Airways announced the sale of BA Connect to Flybe. It formally transferred to Flybe on 25 March 2007.

== History ==

The company was incorporated on 26 January 1970 as Brymon Aviation Limited which operated as Brymon Airways. On 30 July 1993 the company was renamed Brymon Airways Limited to reflect the operating name.

The company was purchased by British Airways in 1993 and on 28 March 2002 it was merged with British Regional Airlines and was renamed British Airways Citiexpress Ltd operating as BA CitiExpress.

British Airways Citiexpress is recognised for pioneering and attaining CAA approval for the print-at-home boarding pass, one of the first self-service tools of the digital era.

The regional operations of British Airways at Birmingham and Manchester, and the operations of the former CityFlyer Express, were integrated into the new airline later in 2002.

On 1 February 2006 the airline was renamed BA Connect Limited operating as BA Connect and operations moved to a low-cost carrier model, with food sold via a &#x27;buy on board&#x27; programme (except for flights to London City Airport). However, allocated seating and a baggage valet service were still available, while lounge access, tier points and BA Miles remained unaffected for those in the Executive Club. Operationally the new service came into effect on 26 March 2006.
BA Connect handled most of British Airways&#x27; domestic and European services that do not serve London’s Heathrow or Gatwick airports. It had hubs in Birmingham, Bristol, London–City, Manchester and Southampton. From these locations the carrier operated services to several northwest European destinations and also to Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. A few services also operated from Gatwick. In total, BA Connect flew from 17 airports in the UK and Ireland on 63 routes to major or central regional airports.

On 3 November 2006, British Airways chief executive said that he had reached an agreement for Flybe to purchase BA Connect. BA would ensure that Flybe has sufficient funding in order to achieve its growth targets and the transition out of current BA Connect fleet. In return BA would acquire a 15% stake in the new business. The acquisition (which did not include BA Connect routes to London City or from Manchester to New York) would significantly increase the Flybe route network in both the UK and continental Europe, making Flybe the largest regional airline in Europe. Retention of the London City routes would result in BA retaining the RJ100 aircraft for these domestic and European services.

BA had to pay Flybe a sum of money to take on the company due to Flybe actually taking on a company that would cost them money rather than make profits for the foreseeable future.

Much concern was expressed at the shedding of routes across Scotland, but Flybe stated that BA Connect routes would be kept and expanded. On 6 March 2007 Flybe stated that they would not be operating any former BA Connect services from Bristol. Consequently, the last flights on any of BA Connect&#x27;s routes from Bristol was on 24 March 2007.

== Services ==
BA Connect operated from several destinations that were also served by the parent company, and were part of British Airways destinations. Those that were not served by British Airways itself, mainly UK regional destinations, are listed in British Airways franchise destinations.

== Fleet ==

The BA Connect fleet included the following aircraft, before the sale to Flybe (March 2007)

*1 BAe 146-100 (to Flybe)
*2 BAe 146-200 (to Flybe)
*1 BAe 146-300 (to Flybe)
*10 Avro RJ100 (to BA CityFlyer)
*6 Bombardier Dash 8 Q300 (to Flybe)
*28 Embraer ERJ 145 (to Flybe)

<doc id="293811" wikidata="Q7139844" url="?curid=293811" title="Parrot assembly language">
<text>The Parrot assembly language (PASM) is the basic assembly language used by the Parrot virtual machine.

PASM is the lowest level assembly language in the Parrot stack. The Parrot intermediate representation (PIR) is PASM extended to simplify development of compilers.

The hello world program in PASM is simply:
 print &quot;Hello world!\n&quot;
 end

Although it appears similar to source code in some high-level programming languages, more complex PASM programs will resemble other assembly languages. The main exceptions to this low level programming in PASM are string handling and, as shown above, input and output. Additionally, PASM has automatic garbage collection from the virtual machine, and it does not allow pointer arithmetic.

Parrot assembly language has more instructions than hardware assembly languages, even CISC processors. This is because the marginal cost of creating a new instruction in Parrot is low compared to the marginal cost of doing so in hardware, and the creators of Parrot had no particular goal of minimalism.

<doc id="293815" wikidata="Q8787" url="?curid=293815" title="Oneworld">
<text>oneworld (CRS: *O) is a global airline alliance consisting of 13 member airlines. It was founded on 1 February 1999. The alliance&#x27;s stated objective is to be the first choice airline alliance for the world&#x27;s frequent international travellers. Its headquarters have been located in Fort Worth, Texas, since December 2022.

The alliance&#x27;s current membership consists of Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Finnair, Iberia, Japan Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Royal Jordanian and SriLankan Airlines. Fiji Airways, a Oneworld Connect partner, announced in June 2024 that it would become a full member. On 20 June 2022, Oman Air announced it would formally join the alliance by 30 June 2025.

 its member airlines collectively operate a fleet of 3,296 aircraft, serve about 1,000 airports in 170 countries, carrying over 490 million passengers per year on 13,000 plus daily departures. It is the third-largest global airline alliance in terms of passengers carried, behind SkyTeam (676 million in 2019) and Star Alliance (762 million in 2019).

==Management==
oneworld announced the formation of a central alliance team, the oneworld Management Company (oMC), in February 2000, to mark the alliance&#x27;s first anniversary. The oMC was established May 2000 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (see § Headquarters below). It acts as the alliance&#x27;s central secretariat, with responsibility for driving future growth and the launch of new customer services and benefits.

The oMC was first led by managing partner Peter Buecking, previously director of sales and marketing at Cathay Pacific; followed by John McCulloch, previously the alliance&#x27;s vice-president for marketing. Bruce Ashby, who previously held roles of CEO of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s SAMA Airlines, CEO of India&#x27;s IndiGo, and executive vice-president for US Airways, became CEO in December 2011. Rob Gurney succeeded Ashby as CEO in October 2016.

Reporting to the CEO are vice-presidents for commercial; membership and customer experience; and corporate communications, a chief financial officer and an IT director.

The CEO reports to the oneworld Governing Board, which is made up of the chief executives of each of the member airlines. The Governing Board meets regularly to set strategic direction and review progress. Chairmanship of the board rotates among the alliance members&#x27; chief executives. Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker succeeded Qantas CEO as chairman in May 2021.

===Headquarters===
In 2011, the alliance headquarters relocated from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, to Park Avenue in New York City, New York, United States, sharing premises with the local offices of a number of Oneworld member airlines including American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Finnair, Japan Airlines and Qantas.

The headquarters of the oneworld alliance moved to Fort Worth, Texas, US, where American Airlines—one of its member airlines—is headquartered, in December 2022.

==History==

===New global alliance===

oneworld was unveiled by its founding members, American Airlines, British Airways, Canadian Airlines International, Cathay Pacific and Qantas at a press conference in London, United Kingdom, on 21 September 1998. Oneworld was officially launched and became operational on 1 February 1999.

The alliance outlined its services and benefits as including:
* Smoother transfers for passengers travelling across all member airlines
* Greater support to passengers regardless of which member airline they are travelling with
* Greater range of round-the-world products
* Enhanced co‑operation in the member airlines&#x27; frequent-flyer programmes to provide more rewards
* Wider recognition and access to more airport lounges.
* More codeshare agreements and connecting flights between member airlines

Ahead of the official launch, the alliance embarked on an extensive employee communications and training programme, involving virtually all of the 220,000 staff employed by the five-member airlines, to ensure they could deliver what the alliance brand promised. 

At its launch in 1999, oneworld&#x27;s member airlines and their affiliates served 648 destinations in 139 countries and carried 181 million passengers with a fleet of 1,577 aircraft.

====First additional members====

Finnair, Finland&#x27;s largest airline and flag carrier, was the alliance&#x27;s first new recruit on 9 December 1998. The alliance welcomed Iberia, Spain&#x27;s flag carrier, as its second recruit on 15 February 1999. Both airlines, together with Iberia&#x27;s franchisee, Iberia Regional Air Nostrum, joined the alliance on 1 September 1999, adding more than 50 destinations to the Oneworld network.

On 19 May 1999, LAN Chile became a member-elect, the alliance&#x27;s first representative from Latin America. LanChile&#x27;s two subsidiaries, LAN Express and LAN Perú, would also join the alliance. Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus was formally elected on board and confirmed as the ninth member of the alliance on 2 December 1999. As LanChile and Aer Lingus joined on 1 June 2000, Canadian Airlines International left the alliance, following the airline&#x27;s purchase by Air Canada, a member of the rival Star Alliance.

Swiss International Air Lines (Swiss) accepted an invitation to join oneworld in September 2003, after signing a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on 23 September 2003 to establish a wide-ranging commercial agreement with British Airways. However, Swiss later decided not to proceed with key elements of its agreement with British Airways and was therefore released from its commitment to join oneworld; it was taken over by Lufthansa in 2005 and joined Star Alliance in 2006.

====2005–2006: The first big expansion drive====

The mid 2000s saw oneworld undertake one of the biggest expansions in its history. Hungarian flag carrier Malév signed an MOU in May 2005 as a precursor to a formal invitation to join, extended in November 2005. On 17 October 2005, the alliance signed as a member-elect Royal Jordanian, the first airline from the Middle East to accept an invitation to join any global airline alliance.

Japan Airlines, then Asia&#x27;s largest airline group, applied to join the alliance on 25 October 2005. JAL and oneworld exchanged an MOU on 8 February 2006, setting out a framework for the remaining steps to be taken before the airline could be formally invited to join. On 5 June 2006, JAL accepted a formal letter of invitation to join the alliance, along with five members of the JAL Group as affiliate members, including J-Air, JAL Express, JALways, Japan Asia Airways and Japan Transocean Air.
All three of these airline groups — Japan Airlines, Malév and Royal Jordanian — joined as full members and started offering the alliance&#x27;s full range of services and benefits on 1 April 2007, along with, as Oneworld affiliate members, Japan Airlines&#x27; subsidiaries J‑Air, JAL Express, JALways, Japan Asia Airways and Japan Transocean Air, and LAN&#x27;s subsidiaries LAN Argentina and LAN Ecuador. They expanded the Oneworld network to almost 700 airports in nearly 150 countries served by 9,000 daily departures, carrying around 315 million passengers per year with a fleet of almost 2,500 aircraft, with top-tier frequent flyers able to access 400 airport lounges worldwide.

On the same day, Aer Lingus voluntarily exited the alliance due to a fundamental change to its business strategy. The Irish carrier was repositioning itself as a low fares point-to-point carrier, while oneworld&#x27;s focus was on the multisector, premium, frequent international travellers&#x27; market. Although no longer a oneworld member, Aer Lingus maintained frequent-flyer programme partnerships with some of the alliance members and continued to participate in the alliance&#x27;s Global Explorer round-the-world fare product.

In February 2012, Malév suspended all services indefinitely, citing financial difficulties. Its participation in Oneworld ended when the airline was wound up in the following weeks.

====Tenth anniversary (February 2009)====
In February 2009, Oneworld celebrated its tenth anniversary with its ten member airlines—American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Finnair, Iberia Airlines, Japan Airlines, LAN, Malév, Qantas, and Royal Jordanian. 

In the past decade, membership had doubled from an initial five members to ten members; its member airlines carried a total of 2.5 billion passengers and generated almost $500 billion, €450 million in revenue from passenger activities. Alliance fares and sales products generated $5 billion, €2.5 billion in revenue alone, with two-thirds or almost $3 billion, €1.5 billion would not have been generated if the alliance did not exist. As part of the celebration and to increase awareness of the 10‑member alliance, all the alliance member airlines decorated a proportion of their aircraft fleets in a new standard oneworld livery—around 40 aircraft in total, mainly types that fly on international routes. The alliance also unveiled a special version of its logo, featuring the text &quot;10 years&quot; printed behind the word oneworld as a watermark on its purple orb.
==== 2009–2011: New recruits and expansion ====

On 26 May 2009, Russian airline S7 Airlines was unanimously elected to the alliance. It became a full member on 15 November 2010, adding to oneworld one of the most extensive networks covering Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). It expanded the Oneworld network to another 54 cities, 35 of them in Russia. The airline&#x27;s subsidiary Globus Airlines joined oneworld at the same time as an affiliate member.

On 10 November 2009, oneworld welcomed Mexicana and its subsidiaries, MexicanaClick and MexicanaLink, after the airline accepted a formal invitation to join the alliance on 9 April 2008. Mexicana and its affiliates added 26 destinations to the alliance map. Mexicana was a former member of Star Alliance, leaving the group in March 2004 when it terminated its codeshare agreement with United Airlines and opted for bilateral agreements with oneworld members American Airlines and Iberia. On 2 August 2010, Mexicana filed for insolvency proceedings in Mexico and bankruptcy protection in the United States with its financial situation deteriorating. The airline suspended all operations from 28 August 2010. With the group under Mexican court protection, it has remained an inactive member of oneworld since then.
On 23 February 2010, India&#x27;s Kingfisher Airlines took its first step to joining oneworld with its chairman Vijay Mallya and chief executives from the alliance&#x27;s existing member airlines signing a memorandum of understanding, subject to Indian regulatory approval. The airline gained approval to join the alliance from the India&#x27;s Ministry of Civil Aviation and started participating in the alliance&#x27;s Global Explorer round-the-world fare product. However, on 3 February 2012, just a week before it was due to join the alliance, Kingfisher Airlines&#x27; entry was put on hold to give it more time to strengthen its financial position. Kingfisher Airlines suspended operations on 20 October 2012 and finally ceased operations in February 2013.

On 26 July 2010, Air Berlin, at that time Germany&#x27;s second-largest airline, accepted an invitation to join oneworld and joined the alliance on 20 March 2012.

On 6 June 2011, Malaysia Airlines became a new member designate on the sidelines of the IATA World Air Transport Summit in Singapore. Malaysia Airlines became a part of Oneworld on 1 February 2013.

====2012–2021: The second big expansion====

On 11 June 2012, SriLankan Airlines became oneworld&#x27;s latest member-elect, on the sidelines of the IATA World Air Transport Summit in Beijing. Cathay Pacific was SriLankan Airlines&#x27; sponsor through its alliance implementation programme. Its membership implementation was expected to take around 18 months. On 1 May 2014, SriLankan Airlines became a full member of the alliance, making it the first airline in the Indian subcontinent to join any alliance.
On 8 October 2012, Qatar Airways became a member-elect of oneworld. Qatar Airways was one of the fastest growing airlines worldwide—adding 15 destinations in 2012 alone—and one of the most highly regarded, having been named Airline of the Year by the Skytrax independent airline quality ratings agency in both 2011 and 2012. The agreement to join was widely reported in the media as a coup for oneworld, with Qatar Airways the first among the &quot;Big Three&quot; carriers in the Persian Gulf to sign for any global airline alliance. The airline joined the alliance on 30 October 2013.

On 14 February 2013, American Airlines began plans to merge with US Airways. Following U.S. Federal Aviation Administration approval, the merger was completed on 9 December 2013. US Airways left Star Alliance on 30 March 2014, and joined oneworld as an affiliate member the following day.

On 7 March 2013, LATAM Airlines Group chose oneworld as its alliance and announced that LAN subsidiary LAN Colombia plus TAM Airlines and its subsidiary TAM Paraguay would join Oneworld. LAN Colombia joined the alliance on 1 October 2013.

On 31 March 2014, TAM Airlines and US Airways joined oneworld after leaving Star Alliance on 30 March 2014.

On 15 August 2017, Air Berlin filed for insolvency after Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways stopped funding the airline. Air Berlin subsequently left oneworld upon entering administration and ceasing operations on 28 October 2017.

On 1 June 2018, oneworld introduced oneworld Connect, a membership platform similar to Star Alliance&#x27;s &quot;Connecting Partners&quot;, with Fiji Airways as the first member effective from 5 December onwards.

On 5 December 2018, oneworld announced Royal Air Maroc as a member-elect, and the airline joined the alliance on 1 April 2020, extending the alliance&#x27;s network into Africa.

On 26 September 2019, SkyTeam member Delta Air Lines announced its plans to buy 20% of LATAM for US$1.9 billion. On 1 January 2024, it was announced that Delta&#x27;s acquisition of its 20% stake in LATAM was completed. LATAM Airlines Group announced that it would leave oneworld on 1 May 2020, but the fate of Qatar Airways&#x27; 10% stake in LATAM is currently unannounced.
On 31 March 2021, Alaska Airlines and its affiliates Alaska Horizon and Alaska SkyWest joined the alliance as member and member affiliates, respectively.

====2021-present: The third major expansion====

On April 2022, following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, S7 Airlines was suspended from oneworld.

On 20 June 2022, Oman Air and oneworld signed the MOU for Oman Air to join the alliance during IATA General Meeting in Doha. Qatar Airways will act as their sponsor.

In September 2022, RwandAir&#x27;s intentions in joining Oneworld, with a sponsorship from Qatar Airways, were announced. This would make RwandAir the third airline to enter an airline alliance in East Africa, after Ethiopian Airlines (Star Alliance) and Kenya Airways (SkyTeam), and second African airline after Royal Air Maroc to join Oneworld.

In August 2023, the CEO of MIAT Mongolian Airlines Munkhtamir Batbayar revealed in an interview the airline&#x27;s intent to join as a oneworld Connect member, the second after Fiji Airways. It already has extensive codesharing with some Oneworld members, for example, Cathay Pacific since 2017 and JAL since 2020.

On 3 December 2023, the Alaska Air Group announced it planned to acquire Hawaiian Airlines for US$1.9 billion. The deal, which closed on 18 September 2024, retains both Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines as separate brands. Under the deal, Hawaiian Airlines will become a oneworld member and the two airlines will operate a combined frequent flyer program.

On 16 September 2024, Starlux Airlines announced that it plans to apply to join the oneworld alliance by the end of 2025.

===Subsidiaries and franchises===
Besides its full member airlines, oneworld has affiliate member of regional airlines, that are either owned by or have strong commercial links with the alliance&#x27;s full members. For customers, they further extend the network the alliance can offer. In governance terms, these affiliates are represented in Oneworld affairs by their parent airline.

Air Liberté ceased to be an affiliate member of oneworld when the French airline was sold by British Airways to French investment group Taitbout with the UK carrier explaining that it had been unable to receive adequate returns on its investment in the business. Kenya-based Regional Air joined the alliance on 1 July 2001, following its franchising agreement with British Airways. British Airways terminated its franchise agreement with Regional Air when the African carrier suspended flights in mid April 2005, ending its affiliate membership of Oneworld. TWA&#x27;s regional carriers, which operated under the Trans World Express brand, became oneworld affiliate members, as their name changed to AmericanConnection on 2 December 2001, following TWA&#x27;s acquisition by American Airlines. Three airlines operated under the AmericanConnection brand at that time: Chautauqua Airlines, Corporate Airlines, and Trans States Airlines.

The alliance further strengthened its network in Latin America when LAN&#x27;s two subsidiaries, LAN Argentina and LAN Ecuador, became the alliance&#x27;s newest affiliate members. LAN Argentina launched passenger and cargo services in June 2005 from its home base in Buenos Aires, while LAN Ecuador launched its services in April 2003 from its home base in Guayaquil. Both airlines officially joined their sister airlines and offer alliance&#x27;s services and benefits on 1 April 2007.

Conversely, on 5 March 2007, the alliance ended its relationship with affiliate member and British Airways subsidiary, BA Connect. BA Connect&#x27;s UK regional operations were sold to Flybe on 3 November 2006, in return for a 15% stake in the latter. Approximately 50 UK regional routes are affected by the sale; however, Belfast and Southampton would remain linked to the alliance network through other British Airways and alliance members. BA Connect&#x27;s operations from London City Airport and between Manchester and New York were retained and operated by another British Airways subsidiary, BA CityFlyer, and the airline itself, respectively.

The alliance ended its relationship with affiliate member and British Airways franchisee BMED on 27 October 2007, following the purchase of the airline by one of British Airways&#x27; UK rivals, BMI. Four days later, oneworld welcomed its latest affiliate member and Cathay Pacific wholly-owned subsidiary Dragonair to the alliance on 1 November 2007 – rebranded Cathay Dragon in 2016, it was consolidated into Cathay Pacific on 21 October 2020. Dragonair had the biggest network into mainland China for a non-mainland based carrier, with about 400 departures a week.

In 2008, the alliance lost another two affiliate members as British Airways continued the strategy of reducing its UK franchises. The first franchisee, GB Airways, exited the alliance on 30 March 2008, following its purchase by EasyJet. British Airways intended to start services from London Heathrow to Faro, Portugal, and Málaga, Spain, and from London Gatwick to Faro, Gibraltar, Ibiza, Málaga, Palma, and Tunis, which were operated under the franchise. The alliance bid farewell to one of its affiliate member Japan Asia Airways on 31 March 2008, following the airline&#x27;s consolidation into its parent, Japan Airlines. The second British Airways franchisee, Loganair, left the alliance on 25 October 2008, following the ending of its franchise agreement with the airline. A separate agreement for codesharing on some Loganair services replaced the previous franchise, for British Airways passengers connecting through Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow.

== Internal hostilities ==
The Oneworld alliance has been home to numerous conflicts between member airlines. 

As of 2024, all cases of tension between Oneworld airlines have involved Qatar Airways as one of the parties in the dispute.

=== Qatar Airways vs American Airlines (2017–2020) ===
Hostilities between American Airlines and Qatar Airways stemmed from allegations by American and other U.S. carriers that Qatar Airways, along with other Middle Eastern airlines, received excessive government subsidies, creating unfair competition. 

These claims, part of a broader dispute known as the &quot;Gulf Carrier Dispute&quot;, centered on accusations that subsidies allowed Qatar Airways to expand aggressively into U.S. markets, threatening domestic airlines.

Tensions escalated in 2017 when American Airlines announced it would end its codeshare agreement with Qatar Airways, citing these unfair practices. 

American Airlines criticised Qatar Airways&#x27; purchase of a 49% stake in Air Italy and the subsequent commencement of Air Italy flights to the US, with then-American Airlines CEO Doug Parker labelling the Air Italy services as a &quot;violation&quot; and referred to Qatar Airways as &quot;the greatest threat to commercial aviation and the United States.&quot; 

In 2018, Qatar Airways threatened to leave the Oneworld alliance citing the behaviour of American Airlines, along with separate issues with Qantas.

The dispute was largely resolved in 2020 through diplomatic negotiations between the U.S. and Qatari governments. Qatar Airways agreed to increase transparency in its financial reporting and limit certain flight routes to the U.S. 

This agreement helped ease tensions, and the airlines have since improved relations, with American Airlines resuming codeshare agreements with Qatar Airways in 2020 to enhance their global network. 

American Airlines began services to Qatar Airways&#x27; Doha hub in 2022.

=== Qatar Airways&#x27; comments on British Airways (2021) ===
In 2021, Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker called fellow Oneworld member British Airways a &quot;low cost carrier&quot; that would score &quot;two out of ten&quot; despite owning 25% of British Airways parent company, International Airlines Group. 

Al Baker further stated that:&quot;British Airways will never again be the world&#x27;s favourite airline, because that title belongs to Qatar Airways&quot; British Airways did not publicly respond to Qatar Airways&#x27; commentary.

=== Qatar Airways vs Qantas (2017–present) ===
In late 2012, before Qatar Airways joined the Oneworld alliance, Australian flag carrier and Oneworld founding member Qantas entered into a comprehensive joint venture with Qatar Airways&#x27; rivals Emirates, and renewed it in 2017. 

In 2018, the Coalition government rejected an Australian expansion plan by Qatar Airways which was opposed by Qantas, who argued that the state-owned Qatari airline was dumping capacity and being &quot;uncommercial and anti-competitive&quot; by &quot;selling tickets below cost-price, distorting markets and threatening the sustainable operation of international carriers to Australia&quot; 

Qantas referenced research by a US airline lobby group that revealed that Qatar Airways had received over US$17 billion in state aid and interest free loans from Qatar&#x27;s sovereign wealth fund, as well as other support. 

Qantas further stated that &quot;we welcome healthy competition – however it must be fair.&quot; 

This commentary from Qantas and the government rejection infuriated Qatar Airways and its CEO Akbar Al Baker, who publicly accused Qantas of failing to act &quot;in the spirit&quot; of the Oneworld alliance, and doubled down on this threat to leave the alliance after similar disputes with American Airlines.

==== COVID-19 pandemic ====
During the COVID-19 pandemic, in what was widely seen in aviation and business circles as a long-running publicity stunt intended to garner support from the Australian public as well as appeasement from Qatar Airways towards the Australian Government, Qatar Airways continually flew near-empty aircraft to and from Australia, under the banner of &quot;bringing Australians home.&quot; 

Due to Australia&#x27;s international border restrictions, which were amongst the strictest in the world, Qantas was unable to operate international flights as it was a commercial corporation rather than a sovereign state-backed entity like Qatar Airways, who could afford to run the routes at a deep loss and counterbalance this loss by accessing subsidies from Qatar&#x27;s sovereign wealth fund. 

Despite this, Qatar Airways accumulated a large degree of support from the Australian public who were not aware of all the circumstances surrounding this issue, and Qatar Airways made another application to the Australian Government to double its flights to Australia in 2022 citing this support and their services to Australia during the pandemic. 

==== Virgin Australia-Qatar Airways partnership ====
In late 2022, Qatar Airways also launched a comprehensive partnership with Qantas&#x27; main rival Virgin Australia, and significantly reduced and devalued Oneworld benefits available for Qantas Frequent Flyer members, further escalating tensions with Qantas. 

Qatar Airways also started to discourage its customers from using Qantas lounges, while Qantas in the most part refused to recognise Doha as a destination available to book flights to and from on its website.

Starting from late 2022 after the Virgin Australia partnership was launched, Qantas vehemently opposed Qatar&#x27;s application, with similar reasons to its 2018 argument, and made several representations to the Government.

Qantas stated that Qatar Airways will be &quot;distorting&quot; the Australian travel market through its access to Qatar&#x27;s sovereign wealth fund as well as pointing out that Qatar Airways may potentially be evading Australian law by engaging in tactics such as exploiting international flight landing agreements into smaller Australian cities. 

Qantas also argued that Qatar Airways&#x27; additional flights would be severely detrimental to the Australian tourism industry as it would fly out more Australians who spend domestically than it would bring in people from overseas due to the “disproportionately high” number of Australian-based outbound passengers on Qatar Airways flights. 

Al Baker, on a subsequent television interview, furiously insulted the Australian carrier for its commentary, criticising its absence in flying international flights during the pandemic, despite Qantas not being financially able to sustain international flights during this period. 

In July 2023, after successful lobbying from the Australian flag carrier, the Australian government, which switched to Labor in May 2022, rejected Qatar Airways&#x27; new request for additional flights into Australia&#x27;s major ports, further inflaming Qatar Airways. 

In October 2024, Qatar Airways announced plans to purchase a 25% stake in Virgin Australia, a move widely seen as a workaround to the blocking of extra international flights from Doha and Qantas&#x27;s role in that outcome. 

It will increase code-share and collaboration between Virgin Australia and Qatar, further undermining the relationship with Qantas and considerably escalate already tense hostilities between the two Oneworld carriers. 

The investment is still pending approval from Australia&#x27;s Foreign Investment Review Board and Competition &amp; Consumer Commission. Qantas is yet to publicly respond to this announcement.

==Benefits and services==

===Co-location===
Co-location provides alliance customers with smoother transfers between member airlines and better facilities than any of the member airlines could justify on their own. The alliance has combined ticket offices, check-in facilities and lounges at some 50 airports worldwide.


===Customer service initiatives===

====Interline electronic ticket====
On 21 April 2005, Oneworld became the first airline alliance to enable its customers to fly throughout its members&#x27; network on electronic tickets (e-tickets) only, with the completion of interline e-ticketing (IET) links between all its member airlines.

===Awards and recognitions===
==Livery and logo==
All alliance members&#x27; aircraft bear a Oneworld logo, in diameter, on the right of the first set of entry doors behind the cockpit.

===Japan Airlines – 2007 special Oneworld livery===
In 2007, Japan Airlines (JAL) painted two of its Boeing 777 aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER (JA704J) and a Boeing 777-300 (JA8941), in a special Oneworld livery to mark its entrance into the alliance. The first aircraft (JA704J) took off from the airline&#x27;s main international hub Tokyo Narita International Airport as Japan Airlines Flight 441 bound for Moscow on 16 April 2007. The design featured &quot;a huge globe in the distinctive horizon blue of Oneworld, painted on the centre of the aircraft, with a stylised motif to symbolise the convenience, comfort, value and choice available to passengers throughout the alliance&#x27;s comprehensive global network&quot;.

===Standard Oneworld livery===
The new (optional) standard Oneworld livery was introduced as part of the alliance&#x27;s tenth anniversary celebration in February 2009. It features the alliance name in large letters that are almost tall and the alliance logo along the side of their fuselage, against a white or a polished metal background. The name of the operating member airline will be placed in smaller lettering in a standard position at the front of the aircraft below the alliance name and logo. Each member airline will also retain its regular tailfin, winglets and engine design, any fuselage designs that do not conflict with the alliance logo can also be retained.

<text>Hapag-Lloyd AG is a German international shipping and container transportation company, the 5th biggest in the world. It was formed in 1970 through a merger of Hamburg-American Line (HAPAG) and Norddeutscher Lloyd.
==History==
The company was formed on 1 September 1970, by the merger of two German transportation/maritime companies, Hamburg-American Line (HAPAG), founded in 1847, and Norddeutscher Lloyd (known in English as North German Lloyd), which was formed in 1857.

Since its formation, Hapag-Lloyd has seen changes among its shareholders and has also undergone a number of mergers with other companies. For instance, Hapag-Lloyd was completely acquired by, and became a subsidiary of TUI AG (Hanover) in 1998. This transition was followed by TUI selling a majority stake of Hapag-Lloyd to private investors in Hamburg in 2009 and further sales in 2012. Other important events in the history of the company include Hapag-Lloyd&#x27;s acquisition of CP Ships in 2005 as well as Hapag-Lloyd&#x27;s merger with the container business of CSAV in 2014, and United Arab Shipping Company in 2017.

===HAPAG===
The Hamburg-Amerikanische Packetfahrt-Actien-Gesellschaft for shipping across the Atlantic Ocean was founded in Hamburg. In 1912, HAPAG built the first of their &quot;Big Three&quot; ocean liners; the &quot;Imperator&quot;, followed by its twin &quot;Vaterland&quot;. A third twin, &quot;Bismarck&quot;, was under construction at the outbreak of World War I and was completed after the war for White Star Line as the &quot;Majestic&quot;. These were the first liners to exceed 50,000 gross register tons and 900 feet (274 m) in length. During World War I, the majority of HAPAG&#x27;s fleet of 175 ships were wiped out, and most of the surviving ships (including the &quot;Big Three&quot;) had to be turned over to the winning side as war reparations. After the war&#x27;s end, HAPAG rebuilt its fleet with much smaller ships than before the war, but their fleet was again mostly wiped out during World War II, and the surviving ships turned over to Allied powers.

===Norddeutscher Lloyd===

Norddeutscher Lloyd (NDL) was formed in 1857 in the City-State of Bremen, offering passenger and cargo transportation between Bremen and New York, with an emphasis on emigration to the United States. Service started in June 1858 with the &quot;Bremen&quot;, the first of four steamships, and the company established its American base at Hoboken, New Jersey. NDL eventually built a large fleet of ships that carried many thousands of emigrants westwards, with around 218,000 passengers transported across the Atlantic in 1913 alone.

The outbreak of World War I resulted in the internment of 32 vessels in US ports, a status later changed to confiscation when the US entered the war in 1917. Likewise, its Hoboken base was confiscated and turned over to the US Navy, which used it as a transshipping point for the duration of the war. As with HAPAG, the NDL ships surviving the war were eventually confiscated as reparation, leaving the company to start over from scratch.

US operations were resumed in 1922, when NDL was able to purchase its former base from the United States Alien Property Administrator. NDL launched new liners &quot;Bremen&quot; and &quot;Europa&quot; in 1928–30.

During World War II, NDL repeated its World War I experience, with some parts of its fleet again being interned at the outbreak of the war, while a number of vessels remained under NDL control. One such exception was the &quot;Bremen&quot;, which raced across the Atlantic, and achieved protection at Murmansk in 1939, before eventually making a dash for Bremerhaven, where she was ultimately destroyed by a fire in 1941.

Passenger service resumed in 1954 with the &quot;Gripsholm&quot; formerly belonging to the &quot;Swedish American Line&quot; (the ship was renamed to only the following year). Later two other second-hand ships, (formerly &quot;Pasteur&quot;) and (formerly Swedish American Line&#x27;s &quot;Kungsholm&quot;), were purchased.

NDL attained several speed records over the years. Notable among them was the record for the run between Southampton and New York of eight days in 1881, which was set by the &quot;Elbe&quot;; and the record for the fastest transatlantic crossing set by the new &quot;Bremen&quot; in 1929 (see Blue Riband).

===Hapag-Lloyd===
Hapag and NDL continued to compete until they established a joint-venture container line. The &quot;Hapag-Lloyd Container Line&quot;, founded in 1967 and operating from 1968 onward, was established to share the huge investments related to the containerisation of the fleets. The two companies finally merged on 1 September 1970, under the name Hapag-Lloyd.

Hapag-Lloyd was acquired in 1998 by Preussag AG (since 2002 named TUI AG (Hanover)), a tourism conglomerate, and became its fully-owned subsidiary in 2002.

In August 2008, TUI announced an intention to sell its entire stake in Hapag-Lloyd shipping activities before the end of that year. Industry speculation predicted a sale price of approximately US$5.9 billion.

In October 2019, Hapag-Lloyd acquired a 10 percent stake in Container Terminal 3 (TC3) of the Tangier Med 2 port in Morocco.

In April 2022, Hapag-Lloyd acquired a participation in JadeWeserPort Wilhelmshaven, taking ownership of a 30 percent stake in Container Terminal Wilhellmshaven (CTW) and a 50 percent stake in Rail Terminal Wilhelmshaven (RTW).

On 12 January 2023, Hapag-Lloyd acquired a 49% minority stake in Spinelli Group, an Italian terminal and transport operator. Around three months later, on 19 April 2023, Hapag-Lloyd also acquired a 40% stake in J M Baxi Ports &amp; Logistics Limited (JMBPL), a terminal and inland transport service provider in India.

In August 2023, it was announced Hapag-Lloyd had acquired SM SAAM&#x27;s terminal business and related logistics services in the Americas. Since then, Hapag-Lloyd&#x27;s business activities have been divided into the segments of Liner Shipping on the one hand and Terminal &amp; Infrastructure on the other. The Terminal &amp; Infrastructure division has been operating under the brand name “Hanseatic Global Terminals” since July 2024. It is a fully owned but independent stand-alone business unit based in Rotterdam. 

Also in 2023, Hapag-Lloyd and the Brazilian shipping and waterway logistics company Norsul set up a new joint venture called “Norcoast”. Based on a 50-50 partnership, Norcoast started offering container cabotage and feeder services in Brazilian ports in the first quarter of 2024.

== Mergers and acquisitions ==
===CP Ships Limited===
On 21 August 2005, TUI AG agreed to acquire the Canadian business CP Ships Limited for €1.7 billion (US$2.0 billion) in cash. The deal, which was approved by the boards of both CP Ships, TUI, and the shareholders, was a success, and made the combined fleet the fifth-largest by capacity in the worldwide container shipping market.

===Hamburg Süd===
In late 2012, Hapag-Lloyd announced it was considering the possibility of a merger with its smaller compatriot Hamburg Süd. The merger plans were scotched when Hamburg Süd&#x27;s shareholders and owners did not reach an agreement with the Hapag-Lloyd stakeholders. After this event, Hamburg Süd remained a private, independent company until December 2016, when the container transport division of Danish logistics and energy company Maersk, announced it would purchase Hamburg Süd.

===Compañía Sud Americana de Vapores (CSAV)===
In 2014, Hapag-Lloyd took over the container business of Chile&#x27;s Compañía Sud Americana de Vapores SA (CSAV), with the latter becoming a major shareholder of Hapag-Lloyd. This made Hapag-Lloyd the fourth-largest container-shipping company in the world at the time.

===United Arab Shipping Company (UASC)===
In April 2016, Hapag-Lloyd announced it was in merger talks with the United Arab Shipping Company (UASC). The merger was agreed upon later in 2016, and the integration between the two companies was completed in 2017. At the time of the merger, UASC was reported to be the world&#x27;s 10th largest liner shipping company, with a fleet of 56 ships and a market share of 2.7 percent. As a result of the merger, Hapag-Lloyd strengthened its position as the world&#x27;s fifth-largest container transporter in terms of vessel capacity, ahead of Taiwan&#x27;s Evergreen Line. As a result of the merger, the former shareholders of UASC would become the largest shareholder in the new entity, whilst Hapag-Lloyd would absorb all operations and assets of UASC.
Historically United Arab Shipping Company was jointly established in July 1976 by the six shareholding governments of the Arab states of the Gulf (Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and UAE). Originally based in Kuwait, its corporate headquarters then moved to Dubai during the Iraqi conflict, and only some departments were moved back after the war.

The UASC fleet operated more than 45 services, connecting the Middle East to Europe, the Mediterranean, Indian Sub-continent, Far East, West Africa and the Americas. Its network covered over 220 ports, offering containerized and conventional cargo shipping by a fleet of 58 owned and chartered vessels. On 29 June 2016, UASC&#x27;s six shareholding states voted unanimously to approve the proposed merger. The deal gave a relative valuation of the two businesses at 72 percent for Hapag-Lloyd and 28 percent for UASC. At the time of the merger, UASC was 51 percent owned by Qatar and 35 percent owned by Saudi Arabia government, with the remainder held by other Arab states.

===NileDutch Transport &amp; Shipping ===
In March 2021, Hapag-Lloyd announced the acquisition of Nile Dutch Investments B.V., a leading container service provider to and from West Africa. The transaction was effectively closed on 8 July 2021.

=== Deutsche Afrika-Linien ===
On 1 June 2022, Hapag-Lloyd closed the acquisition of the container liner business of German carrier Deutsche Afrika-Linien (DAL), another Africa specialist, operating with liner services between Europe, South Africa and the Indian Ocean.

<text>The Buddhāvataṃsaka-nāma-mahā­vaipulya-sūtra(The [[Mahayana|Mahāvaipulya]] Sūtra named &quot;Buddhāvataṃsaka&quot;)&quot; is one of the most influential [[Mahayana sutras|Mahāyāna sutras]] of [[East Asian Buddhism]]. It is often referred to in short as the&quot;. In Classical Sanskrit, &quot;avataṃsa&quot;, &quot;vataṃsa&quot; and &quot;uttaṃsa&quot; (from stem &quot;taṃs&quot;, meaning &quot;to decorate&quot;) all mean garland, wreath, or any circular ornament, such as an earring&quot;&quot;; suffix -ka often functions either as a diminutive or plural. Thus, the title may be rendered in English as &quot;A Garland of Buddhas&quot;, &quot;Buddha Ornaments&quot;, or &quot;Buddha&#x27;s Fine Garland&quot;. In Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit, the term &quot;avataṃsaka&quot; means &quot;a great number,&quot; &quot;a multitude,&quot; or &quot;a collection.&quot; This is matched by the Tibetan title of the sutra, which is &quot;A Multitude of Buddhas&quot; (Tibetan: &quot;sangs rgyas phal po che&quot;).

Modern scholars consider the &quot;Buddhāvataṃsaka&quot; to be a compilation of numerous smaller sutras, many of which originally circulated independently and then were later brought together into the larger mature &quot;Buddhāvataṃsaka.&quot; Many of these independent &quot;Buddhāvataṃsaka&quot; sutras survive in Chinese translation.

The text has been described by the translator Thomas Cleary &quot;the most grandiose, the most comprehensive, and the most beautifully arrayed of the Buddhist scriptures.&quot; The &quot;Buddhāvataṃsaka&quot; describes a cosmos of infinite realms upon realms filled with an immeasurable number of Buddhas. This sutra was especially influential in East Asian Buddhism. The vision expressed in this work was the foundation for the creation of the Huayan school of Chinese Buddhism, which was characterized by a philosophy of interpenetration. The Huayan school is known as Hwaeom in Korea, Kegon in Japan and Hoa Nghiêm in Vietnam. The sutra is also influential in Chan Buddhism.

==Title==
This work has been used in a variety of countries. Some major traditional titles include the following:
* Sanskrit: &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Mahāvaipulya Sūtra named &quot;Buddhāvataṃsaka&quot;&quot;. &quot;Vaipulya&quot; (&quot;extensive&quot;) refers to key Mahayana sutras. &quot;Garland/wreath/adornment&quot; refers to a manifestation of the beauty of Buddha&#x27;s virtues or his inspiring glory. The term &quot;avataṃsaka&quot; also means &quot;a great number,&quot; &quot;a multitude,&quot; or &quot;a collection.&quot; This matches the content of the sutra, in which numerous Buddhas are depicted as manifestations of the cosmic Buddha Vairocana.&quot;&quot;
* Chinese: &quot;Dàfāngguǎng Fóhuāyán Jīng&quot; , commonly known as the &quot;Huāyán Jīng&quot; (), meaning &quot;Flower-adorned (Splendid &amp; Solemn) Sūtra.&quot; &quot;Vaipulya&quot; here is translated as &quot;corrective and expansive&quot;, &quot;fāngguǎng&quot; (). &quot;Huā&quot; () means at once &quot;flower&quot; (archaic; namely ) and &quot;magnificence.&quot; &quot;Yán&quot; (), short for &quot;zhuàngyán&quot; (), means &quot;to decorate (so that it is solemn, dignified).&quot;
* Japanese: &#x27; (), usually known as the &#x27; (). This title is identical to Chinese above, just in Shinjitai characters.
* &#x27; or &#x27; (), the Sino-Korean pronunciation of the Chinese name.
* , shortened to the &quot;, the Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation of the Chinese name.
* , Standard Tibetan &quot;
* Tangut (romanized): &quot;Tha cha wa tha fa sho ldwi rye&quot;
According to a Dunhuang manuscript, this text was also known as the &quot;&quot;.

== History ==
The &quot;Buddhāvataṃsakasūtra&quot; was written in stages, beginning from at least 500 years after the death of the Buddha. One source claims that it is &quot;a very long text composed of a number of originally independent scriptures of diverse provenance, all of which were combined, probably in Central Asia, in the late third or the fourth century CE.&quot; Japanese scholars such as Akira Hirakawa and Otake Susumu meanwhile argue that the Sanskrit original was compiled in India from sutras already in circulation which also bore the name &quot;Buddhavatamsaka&quot;.

The &quot;Ten Stages sutra (Daśabhūmika)&quot; and the &quot;Flower Array&quot; sutra &quot;(Gaṇḍavyūha)&quot; have both survived in Sanskrit. There are two other parts of the &quot;Avatamsaka&quot; which have survived in Sanskrit, the &quot;Bhadracaryāpraṇidhāna (The Aspiration Prayer for Good Conduct)&quot;, and the &quot;Anantabuddhakṣetraguṇodbhāvana-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra&quot; (&quot;Cultivating the Qualities of Infinite Buddhafields&quot;). Apart from these four texts and some fragments, the rest of the sutra only survives in Chinese and Tibetan translations.

Two full Chinese translations of the &quot;Buddhāvataṃsakasūtra&quot; were made. Fragmentary translation probably began in the 2nd century CE, and the famous &quot;Ten Stages Sutra&quot;, often treated as an individual scripture, was first translated in the 3rd century. The first complete Chinese version was translated by Buddhabhadra around 420 in 60 scrolls with 34 chapters, and the second by Śikṣānanda, assisted by Bodhiruci around 699 in 80 scrolls with 40 chapters. There is also a translation of the &quot;Gaṇḍavyūha&quot; section by Prajñā around 798. The second translation includes more sutras than the first, and the Tibetan translation, which is still later, includes many differences with the 80 scrolls version. Scholars conclude that sutras were being added to the collection.

The single extant Tibetan version was translated from the original Sanskrit by Jinamitra et al. at the end of ninth century.

According to Paramārtha, a 6th-century monk from Ujjain in central India, the &quot;Buddhāvataṃsakasūtra&quot; is also called the &quot;Bodhisattva Piṭaka.&quot; In his translation of the &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgrahabhāṣya&quot;, there is a reference to the Bodhisattva Piṭaka, which Paramārtha notes is the same as the &quot;Avataṃsaka Sūtra&quot; in 100,000 lines. Identification of the &quot;Buddhāvataṃsakasūtra&quot; as a &quot;Bodhisattva Piṭaka&quot; was also recorded in the colophon of a Chinese manuscript at the Mogao Caves: &quot;Explication of the Ten Stages, entitled &quot;Creator of the Wisdom of an Omniscient Being by Degrees&quot;, a chapter of the Mahāyāna sūtra &quot;Bodhisattvapiṭaka Buddhāvataṃsaka&quot;, has ended.&quot;

== Overview ==

The sutra, among the longest Buddhist sutras, is a compilation of disparate texts on various topics such as the Bodhisattva path, the interpenetration of phenomena (dharmas), the omnipresence of Buddhahood, the miraculous powers of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas, the visionary powers of meditation, and the equality of things in emptiness.

According to Paul Demiéville, the &quot;Buddhāvataṃsaka&quot; collection is &quot;characterized by overflowing visionary images, which multiply everything to infinity, by a type of monadology that teaches the interpenetration of the one whole and the particularized many, of spirit and matter&quot; and by &quot;the notion of a gradual progress towards liberation through successive stages and an obsessive preference for images of light and radiance.&quot; Likewise, Alan Fox has described the sutra&#x27;s worldview as &quot;fractal&quot;, &quot;holographic&quot;, and &quot;psychedelic&quot;.

=== Holistic cosmos ===

The East Asian Buddhist view of the text is that it expresses the infinite universe as seen by a Buddha (the Dharmadhatu), who sees all phenomena as empty and thus infinitely interpenetrating, from the point of view of enlightenment. This interpenetration is described in the &quot;Buddhāvataṃsakasūtra&quot; as the perception &quot;that the fields full of assemblies, the beings and aeons which are as many as all the dust particles, are all present in every particle of dust.&quot; Thus, a Buddha&#x27;s view of reality is also said to be &quot;inconceivable; no sentient being can fathom it&quot;.
The following passage from the &quot;Buddhāvataṃsaka&quot; describes this holistic idea of universal interpenetration or interfusion which sees the total sum of all things as being contained in each individual phenomena:Children of the Buddha, just as if there was a great sūtra, as extensive as the great universe, in which are written down all phenomena in the great universe. That is to say, in it is written about the phenomena in the great enclosing iron mountains, as extensively as the great enclosing iron mountains; it is written about the phenomena on earth, as extensively as the earth; it is written about the phenomena in the medium universe, as extensively as the medium universe; it is written about the phenomena in the small universe, as extensively as the small universe. In the same vein, all phenomena – be they of the four continents, or the great oceans, Sumeru mountains, the palaces of the gods in the heavens of the realm of desire, the palaces in the realm of form, and the palaces of the formless realm – are written down to an equal length. Even though this sūtra is as extensive as the great universe, it can be fully comprised within a single particle of dust. As it is with one particle, so it is with all particles of dust. This idea would later become central in East Asian Buddhist traditions like the Huayan school and Zen.

=== Mind-only and emptiness ===
Paul Williams notes that the sutra contains both the &quot;mind-only&quot; (&quot;cittamatra&quot;, Yogacara) teachings and the emptiness teachings (associated with Prajñaparamita and Madhyamaka). The sutra thus teaches that all things are empty of inherent existence and also speaks of &quot;pure untainted awareness or consciousness (&quot;amala-citta&quot;) as the ground of all phenomena&quot;.

Teachings about emptiness and mind-only can be found throughout the sutra, especially in chapters 10, 1 6, and 22 of the 60 fascicle version (T 278). The sutra contains various statements affirming the mind-only teaching. For example, it states: &quot;The triple world is only mind&quot;, and &quot;Everything is created by the mind alone.&quot; It also affirms emptiness when it states: &quot;The triple world is completely empty. That is the vision of the Buddhas;&quot; and &quot;all dharmas lack intrinsic nature; to understand the nature of dharmas like this is to see Vairocana.&quot;

=== The power of the Buddhas ===
The &quot;Buddhāvataṃsakasūtra&quot; also highlights the visionary and mystical power of attaining the spiritual wisdom which sees the nature of the world:

Endless action arises from the mind; from action arises the multifarious world. Having understood that the world&#x27;s true nature is mind, you display bodies of your own in harmony with the world. Having realized that this world is like a dream, and that all Buddhas are like mere reflections, that all principles [dharma] are like an echo, you move unimpeded in the world (Trans in Gomez, 1967: lxxxi)

As a result of their infinite power and omnipotence, Buddhas have the magical ability to create and manifest infinite number of forms all over the universe, and they do this effortlessly and without any calculation, through an infinite number of skillful means (upaya), out of great compassion for all beings. As the sutra states:
:In all atoms of all lands, Buddha enters, each and every one,
:Producing miracle displays for sentient beings:
:Such is the way of Vairocana...
:The techniques of the Buddhas are inconceivable,
:All appearing in accord with beings&#x27; minds...
:In each atom the Buddhas of all times
:Appear, according to inclinations;
:While their essential nature neither comes nor goes,
:By their vow power they pervade the worlds. (Cleary 1984–7: I, Bk 4)
=== Vairocana Buddha ===
The sutra also discusses how there are an immeasurable number of Buddhas and their buddha-fields which are said to be infinite, representing a vast cosmic view of reality. One key Buddha in this sutra is the Buddha Vairocana (&quot;Radiance&quot; or &quot;The Illuminator&quot;). Vairocana is a supreme cosmic Buddha who is the source of light and enlightenment of the &#x27;Lotus universe&#x27;, and who is said to contain all world systems within his entire cosmic body.

The &quot;Avatamsaka sutra&quot; also states that the wisdom of the Buddha (the Tathagata) is present everywhere in the universe, indeed, it is present within every living being. Thus, the sutra states (in chapter 32, Manifestation of the Tathagata):Son of Buddha, the wisdom of Tathagata is present everywhere. Why? Son of Buddha, in the class of living beings there is no place where the wisdom of Tathagata is not present. Why is it that? The wisdom of Tathagata is not established due to grasping the discrimination/consciousness, because the omniscient wisdom, the self-existent wisdom and the non-obstructed wisdom perfectly appear in total disconnection with discrimination.According to Paul Williams, the Buddha &quot;is said or implied at various places in this vast and heterogeneous sutra to be the universe itself, to be the same as &#x27;absence of intrinsic existence&#x27; or emptiness, and to be the Buddha&#x27;s all-pervading omniscient awareness.&quot; The very body of Vairocana is also seen as a reflection of the whole universe:

The body of [Vairocana] Buddha is inconceivable. In his body are all sorts of lands of sentient beings. Even in a single pore are countless, immeasurable vast oceans.

Also, for the &quot;Buddhāvataṃsakasūtra&quot;, the historical Buddha Sakyamuni is simply a magical emanation of the cosmic Buddha Vairocana.

=== Bodhisattva stages ===
The point of all the skillful teachings of the Buddha is to lead all living beings through the bodhisattva stages (Bhūmis) and to final Buddhahood. These stages of spiritual attainment are also widely discussed in various parts of the sutra (book 15, book 26). Indeed, according to a detailed study of the sutra by Itō Zuiei, some of the most important teachings in the sutra are related to the bodhisattva path, its primary cause (bodhicitta) and bodhisattva activity (bodhisattva-caryā). The &quot;Daśabhūmika Sūtra&quot; chapter describes ten bhūmis in detail.

==Sutra overview==
Luis O. Gómez notes that there is an underlying order to the &quot;Avatamsaka&quot; collection. The discourses in the sutra version with thirty nine books (or chapters) are delivered to eight different audiences or &quot;assemblies&quot; in seven locations such as Bodh Gaya and Tusita Heaven. Each &quot;assembly&quot; includes various locales, doctrinal topics and characters.

The following list of assemblies is based on the exegesis of the Chinese Huayan school. In Huayan commentaries, the main &quot;assemblies&quot; which the collection is traditionally divided into are:

=== 1. The Bodhimaṇḍa (Books 1–6) ===
This assembly of bodhisattvas and other beings is gathered at the Bodhimaṇḍa (the seat of awakening under the bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, Magadha), where the Buddha is seated. It is depicted as both the historical place as well as a transcendent palace filled with multicolored jewels and lights. In these chapters, various bodhisattvas, including Samantabhadra, and the Buddha, discuss the nature of reality, the infinity of the universe, how Buddhahood is omnipresent throughout the universe (which is really one vast Buddhafield) and how bodhisattvas fill the countless worlds in the universe. Chapter six discusses the Buddha Vairocana, his vow to reach Buddhahood long ago, and his path of practice.

=== 2. The Hall of Universal Light (Books 7–12) ===

This assembly is located in the &quot;Hall of Universal Light&quot;, a grand palace which is coextensive with the Bodhimaṇḍa. In this set of books, the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī arrives, and empowered by the Buddha&#x27;s power, gives various teachings on the path. Mañjuśrī teaches on the four noble truths and the Buddha sends a light from his feet that illuminates the ten directions (symbolizing the all-pervading quality of the Buddha&#x27;s wisdom). Mañjuśrī then gives further teachings on bodhisattvas, and on pure conduct. The 11th chapter is a popular text, widely known as the &quot;pure practices chapter&quot;.

In chapter 12, the bodhisattva Bhadraśrī also teaches the Bodhisattva Path, discussing bodhicitta, faith, and merit, and recites a set of verses which were seen as a dharani in India, the &quot;Dharani of the Jewelled Comet&quot; (&quot;Ratnolkadhāraṇī&quot;).

=== 3. Indra&#x27;s Palace (Books 13–18) ===
Without leaving his seat at the bodhi tree, the Buddha ascends to Indra&#x27;s (Sakra) palace in Trāyastriṃśa Heaven at the summit of Mount Sumeru and he is praised by Sakra in verse. Many bodhisattvas arrive from other realms and recite verses on the nature of reality, praising the Buddha and bodhisattvas.

In book 15, a bodhisattva named Dharmamati teaches on how the bodhisattva path progresses through ten abodes (viharas): (1) Awakening the Aspiration to Enlightenment; (2) Preparing the Ground; (3) Cultivating the Practices; (4) Noble Birth (i.e. into the family of the buddhas); (5) Perfection of Skilful Means; (6) Rectification of the Mind; (7) Nonregression; (8) Childlike Simplicity; (9) Crown Prince of the Dharma; and (10) Consecration. Dharmamati then teaches on spiritual conduct and the importance of analytical inquiry for beginners on the path (book 16). In book 17, Dharmamati teaches about the arousing of the mind of awakening (&quot;bodhicittotpāda&quot;) and how its merit is greater than any kind of act of worship, no matter how vast. In book 18, Dharmamati discusses the main practices of bodhisattvas: heedfulness (apramāda), the perfections (pāramitās), the ten &quot;inexhaustible treasuries&quot; and others.

=== 4. Yama&#x27;s Palace (Books 19–22) ===
The Buddha ascends to Yama&#x27;s palace (Yama is the god of death), is welcomed with verses of praise. Ten more bodhisattvas arrive and sing verses on the nature of reality, emptiness and the mind. These verses also discuss how the world is a mental creation, it includes the famous simile which compares the mind to a painter and the world to a painting.

In book 21, one of the bodhisattvas, Guṇavana, teaches the ten practices (carya) of bodhisattvas (which also roughly correspond to the 10 paramitas): (1) Giving Delight (corresponding to dāna); (2) Bestowing Benefits (śīla); (3) Nonresentment (kṣānti); (4) Inexhaustible Practice (vīrya); (5) Transcending Ignorance and Confusion (dhyāna); (6) Skilful Manifestation (upāya); (7) Nonattachment; (8) Veneration; (9) Cultivation of Good Qualities; (10) Cultivation of Truth (jñāna).

In book 22, Guṇavana teaches the &quot;Ten Inexhaustible Treasuries&quot; (which summarize the bodhisattva path in from a different point of view). They are: (1) Faith; (2) Ethical conduct; (3) Repentance; (4) Shame (with regard to past wrongdoing); (5) Acquiring Knowledge (of the Dharma); (6) Generosity; (7) Wisdom; (8) Mindfulness; (9) Retention (of what has been learnt); and (10) Eloquence (in teaching the Dharma).

=== 5. Tushita Heaven (Books 23–25) ===
Paralleling the last two books, the Buddha arrives as Tushita heaven without leaving from his past abodes as well. He radiates light in the ten directions and ten more bodhisattvas arrive, singing verses to the Buddha. In book 25, the bodhisattva Vajradhvaja enters samadhi and is blessed by 100,000 Buddhas. Then Vajradhvaja teaches the ten aspects of the bodhisattvas&#x27; transfer (pariṇāmana) of merit.

This is the second longest book in the Avatamsaka and it was known as the &quot;Vajradhvaja Sūtra&quot; or &quot;Vajradhvaja Dhāraṇī&quot; to the Indian scholar Shantideva.

=== 6. Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven (Book 26) ===
This is the &quot;Ten Stages Sutra&quot; (&quot;Daśabhūmika sutra&quot;), which focuses on explaining the ten &quot;bhūmis&quot; (levels or stages) of the bodhisattva path. It was well known in India as the main source for the bodhisattva stages and was widely cited by Shantideva. Vasubandhu wrote an influential commentary on this sutra, the &quot;Dasabhūmikabhāsya.&quot; Another commentary survives in Chinese translation, the &quot;Daśabhūmikavibhāṣā&quot; (十住毘婆沙論, &quot;Shi zhu piposha lun&quot;, Taisho # 1521)&quot;.&quot; It is attributed to Nagarjuna and was translated by Kumārajīva&#x27;s translation team.

=== 7. The Hall of Universal Light (Books 27–38) ===

The Buddha returns to the hall of universal light and Samantabhadra re-appears, becoming the main teacher of this assembly. In book 27, Samantabhadra teaches on ten types of meditative absorption (samadhi) and the various powers that they bestow on those who master them (such as being able to travel freely to all realms in the universe). In book 28, Samantabhadra similarly discusses ten supernormal powers (abhijñā) mastered by bodhisattvas (such as telepathy etc.), and in book 29, he discusses ten types of patience (kṣānti), which mainly refers to an acceptance of the illusory and unarisen nature of reality (i.e. &quot;anutpattikadharmakṣānti&quot;).

Book 30 is taught by the Buddha himself, and it discusses the incalculable (asaṅkhyeya) and infinite nature of the universe and the number of beings contained in it. Books 31 and 32 are taught by the bodhisattva Cittaraja and discuss time and space respectively. Cittaraja states that time is relative, and that in some worlds, an entire aeon (kalpa) is but a day in other worlds. Books 33 discusses the various qualities of the Buddhas and in book 34, Samantabhadra teaches the attributes of the ten bodies of the Buddha.

Book 35 discusses the manifestation of the Buddha in the world. Shakyamuni discusses his birth in Tushita, where he was a bodhisattva named Vairocana (&#x27;Shakyamuni&#x27; and &#x27;Vairocana&#x27; are often used interchangeably in the Avatamsaka). In book 36, Samantabhadra discusses the bodhisattva path in brief, including fifty qualities that must be cultivated.

Book 37 is an influential text titled &quot;The Manifestation of the Tathagata (Tathāgatotpattisaṃbhava)&quot; which also once circulated as an independent sutra. This book discusses the nature of Buddhahood and its manifestation in the world. Samantabhadra describes ten aspects of Buddhahood in detail and affirms that Buddhahood is present in every particle in the physical universe, as well as in the body and mind of every living being.

In book 38 (the third longest book in the sutra), titled &quot;Disengagement from the World&quot;, Samantabhadra teaches on the Buddhist path to awakening. He is asked two hundred questions on the bodhisattva&#x27;s career and provides ten answers to each one, providing a comprehensive set of guidelines and practices for bodhisattvas. These answers include: &quot;ten types of spiritual teachers, ten kinds of effort, ten sources of contentment, ten ways of bringing sentient beings to maturity, ten kinds of moral discipline and so on.&quot;

=== 8. Jetavana Pavilion (Book 39) ===

Book thirty nine, entitled &quot;Entering the Dharmarealm&quot; (入法界品) in the Chinese, is also known as the &quot;Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Stem Array,&quot; or &quot;Supreme Array Sutra&quot;). It is the longest book in the &quot;Avatamsaka&quot;. It contains the story of the bodhisattva Sudhana&#x27;s spiritual career. Sudhana is a young man who hears Manjushri teaching and is inspired to seek awakening. Manjushri sends him to his first teacher, and this begins Sudhana&#x27;s quest, which leads him to study under a series of teachers of all types (monastic, and lay, male and female, from all social and economic classes), including great bodhisattvas like Avalokiteshvara.

Each teacher imparts to Sudhana their own special bodhisattva practice which helps Sudhana deepen his wisdom. The book&#x27;s climax comes when Sudhana meets the bodhisattva Maitreya, who guides him to enter a great tower called &quot;Matrix Adorned with the Splendours of Vairocana&quot; (vairocana-vyūhālāṅkāra-garbha). Within the tower, Sudhana has a grand vision of infinite worlds, each of which contains forms of Maitreya guiding beings to awakening. He also sees countless assemblies of beings with Buddhas teaching them and with Sudhana present in each one.

Sudhana then meets Manjushri and Samantabhadra which confirm his attainment with further visions, including his final merging into the body of Samantabhadra (which contains the entire universe).

Following Sudhana&#x27;s mystic union with Samantabhadra, Samantabhadra recites a popular series of verses which describe the bodhisattva path, the aspiration for enlightenment and various bodhisattva vows. The core of these aspirations are the ten great vows of Samantabhadra, which are: &quot;(1) to pay homage to all the buddhas; (2) to glorify the qualities of all the tathāgatas; (3) to make ample offerings to all the buddhas; (4) to confess and repent of all one&#x27;s sins; (5) to rejoice in the merits of others; (6) always to request the preaching of the dharma; (7) to entreat enlightened beings to remain in the world; (8) always to study the teachings of the buddha; (9) always to respond to sentient beings according to their various needs; and (10) to dedicate all merits to sentient beings that they may achieve buddhahood.&quot;

These verses are known as the &quot;Bhadracaripraṇidhāna&quot; (&quot;Vows of Good Conduct&quot;) or &quot;Ārya-samantabhadra-caryā-praṇidhāna-rāja&quot; (&quot;The Royal Vow to follow the Noble Course of Conduct of Samantabhadra&quot;). This text which concludes the entire &quot;Avatamsaka&quot; was very popular in India, East Asia and in Himalayan Buddhism, and it is cited in numerous sources. It was considered to be a &quot;dhāraṇī&quot; and recited individually as a meritorious text.

The text was known to Indian authors like Bhavya, Śantideva, and Kamalaśīla. The Tibetan canon also contains five commentaries on the individual verses, attributed to figures like Nāgārjuna, Diṅnāga, Śākyamitra, Bhadrāpaṇa, and Vasubandhu.

== Individual sutras ==
Various &quot;chapters&quot; of the &quot;Buddhāvataṃsaka&quot; collection also circulated as individual sutras. These include the &quot;Ten Stages (Daśabhūmika),&quot; the &quot;Flower Array (Gaṇḍavyūha)&quot;, &quot;the Manifestation of the Tathagatha,&quot; the &quot;Bhadracaryāpraṇidhāna,&quot; and the &quot;Anantabuddhakṣetraguṇodbhāvana-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra.&quot;

=== &quot;Ten Stages Sutra&quot; ===

The sutra is also well known for its detailed description of the course of the bodhisattva&#x27;s practice through ten stages where the &quot;Ten Stages Sutra&quot;, or &#x27; (, ), is the name given to this chapter of the &#x27;. This sutra gives details on the ten stages (bhūmis) of development a bodhisattva must undergo to attain supreme enlightenment. The ten stages are also depicted in the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; and the &quot;Śūraṅgama Sūtra&quot;. The sutra also touches on the subject of the development of the &quot;aspiration for Enlightenment&quot; (bodhicitta) to attain supreme buddhahood.

=== &quot;The Flower Array Sutra&quot; ===

The last chapter of the &quot;Avatamsaka&quot; circulates as a separate and important text known as the &quot;Gaṇḍavyūha Sutra&quot; (&quot;&quot;, or &quot;bouquet&quot;; &#x27;Entering the Dharma Realm&#x27;). Considered the &quot;climax&quot; of the larger text, this section details the pilgrimage of the layman Sudhana to various lands (worldly and supra-mundane) at the behest of the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī to find a spiritual friend who will instruct him in the ways of a bodhisattva. According to Luis Gomez, this sutra can also be &quot;regarded as emblematic of the whole collection.&quot;

Despite the former being at the end of the &quot;Avataṃsaka&quot;, the &quot;Gaṇḍavyūha&quot; and the &quot;Ten Stages&quot; are generally believed to be the oldest written chapters of the sutra.

=== The &quot;Aspiration Prayer for Good Conduct&quot; ===

The &quot;Bhadracaryā-praṇidhāna&quot; (or &quot;Samantabhadra-caryā-praṇidhāna&quot;) was often added to the end of the &quot;Avataṃsaka-sūtra,&quot; at the very end of the &quot;Gaṇḍavyūha.&quot; The prayer contains the ten vows of Samantabhadra which encapsulate the core essence of the commitments and actions of all past and future buddhas. However, not all translations of the &quot;Gaṇḍavyūha&quot; contain this prayer (Śikṣānanda&#x27;s Chinese &quot;Gaṇḍavyūha&quot; does not include it, for example), and some translators translated the prayer independently, like Buddhabhadra&quot;.&quot;

The &quot;Bhadracaryā&quot; was influential in India, and has been influential on Nepalese Newar Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism and Chinese Buddhism&quot;.&quot; It is cited in numerous sources as well as in numerous Buddhist inscriptions. It was also considered a dharani with magical powers&quot;.&quot;

Furthermore, there is an Indian commentary to the &quot;Bhadracaryā-praṇidhāna&quot;, which was translated into Tibetan in various editions attributed to various authors, including Nagarjuna - which is unlikely, since the commentary knows of Aryadeva&#x27;s and Mātr̥ceṭa&#x27;s work. According to Dr. Maria Vasylieva, the most likely author is a certain *Bhadrapana. A Sanskrit manuscript of one edition of this commentary is held by a collection in China.

=== &quot;The Manifestation of the Tathagatha sutra&quot; ===
The &quot;Tathāgatotpattisaṃbhava sūtra&quot; (&quot;The Manifestation of the Tathagatha sutra&quot;), which corresponds to chapter 32 of the full &quot;Buddhāvataṃsaka&quot; translation of Buddhabhadra (Taisho Tripitaka no. 278)&quot;,&quot; focuses on the nature of the Buddha (Tathāgata) and his activities. According to Imre Hamar, this sutra &quot;is a precursor to the tathāgatagarbha theory, the idea of universal access to buddhahood, as it stresses that all living beings have the wisdom of the Buddha, but due to their defilements, they are not able to see it. The Buddha&#x27;s mission is to reveal this fact to living beings.&quot;&quot;&quot;

A version of this text was also translated into Chinese by Dharmarakṣa in 292 CE as an independent sutra, the &quot;Fo shuo rulai xingxian jing&quot; (佛說如來興顯經; &quot;The Appearance of Tathāgata as Related by the Buddha&quot;; &quot;*Tathāgatotapattisaṃbhavanirdeśa&quot;).&quot;&quot; The &quot;Tathāgatotpattisaṃbhava&quot; is quoted in numerous Indian Mahayana sources, including by the &quot;Sūtrasamuccaya&quot;, the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāgavyākhyā,&quot; Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Vyākhyāyukti&quot;.

=== The &quot;Vajradhvaja sūtra&quot; and the &quot;Ratnolkādhāraṇī&quot; ===
Both the &quot;Vajra-flag sutra (Vajradhvaja sūtra,&quot; also known as the &quot;Vajradhvaja-pariṇāmanā&quot;) and the &quot;Ratnolkādhāraṇī&quot; (&quot;The Dhāraṇī of the Jewel Torch&quot;) seem to have been important sutras in India. The &quot;Vajradhvaja sūtra&quot; is cited five times by Shantideva in his &quot;Śikṣāsamuccaya&quot; and it is one of the few texts explicitly recommended in his &quot;Bodhisatvacaryāvatāra&quot; (chapter 7, verse 46). It is Chapter 30 in the Tibetan &quot;Avatamsaka&quot;. Two manuscripts of an independent &quot;Vajradhvaja&quot; are preserved in the Dunhuang texts.

Meanwhile, the &quot;Ratnolkādhāraṇī&quot; is also widely cited by Shantideva (four times in the Śikṣāsamuccaya). The relationship between the &quot;Ratnolkādhāraṇī&quot; and the &quot;Buddhāvataṃsaka&quot; is complex. Parts of the &quot;Ratnolkādhāraṇī&quot; can be found in different chapters of the &quot;Buddhāvataṃsaka&quot; (in the Tibetan Avatamsaka&#x27;s chapter 17 and in chapter 20). The &quot;Ratnolkādhāraṇī&quot; also exists as independent Tibetan and Chinese sutras.

== English translations ==

The first relatively complete English translation of the contents of the &quot;Buddhāvataṃsakasūtra&quot; was authored by the late Thomas Cleary and published by Shambhala Publications in 1984 as &quot;The Flower Ornament Scripture: A Translation of the Avatamsaka Sūtra&quot;. Cleary&#x27;s translation was actually only partially translated from Śikṣānanda&#x27;s most complete and now standard Tang Dynasty edition. Cleary chose instead to translate fully a third of this scripture (the very long and detailed Chapter 26 and the immense 53-part Chapter 39) from the much later P.L. Vaidya Sanskrit editions, even though he claimed on page two of his introduction to have made his translation from the Śikṣānanda edition. This is clearly not true, for Cleary&#x27;s translations of Chapters 26 and 39 do not follow Śikṣānanda&#x27;s Chinese at all, whereas they &quot;do&quot; follow the often very different P.L. Vaidya Sanskrit edition fairly closely from beginning to end.

Bhiksu Dharmamitra has recently produced from Tripitaka Master Śikṣānanda&#x27;s 699 ce Sanskrit-to-Chinese edition (T0279) the first and so far only complete English translation of &quot;any&quot; edition of the &quot;Buddhāvataṃsakasūtra.&quot; It is published by Kalavinka Press in three volumes (totaling 2,500 pages) as &quot;The Flower Adornment Sutra: An Annotated Translation of the Avataṃsaka Sutra with A Commentarial Synopsis of the Flower Adornment Sutra&quot; (October 1, 2022 / ISBNS: Volume One - 9781935413356; Volume Two - 9781935413363; Volume Three - 9781935413370). (His complete translation of Chapter 39 which corresponds precisely to the &quot;Gaṇḍavyūha&quot; is contained in Volume Three of this work. It includes the traditionally appended conclusion to Chapter 39, &quot;The Conduct and Vows of Samantabhadra&quot; which was originally translated into Chinese in 798 ce by Tripitaka Master Prajñā).

Kalavinka Press also published the &quot;Daśabhūmika Sūtra&quot; (corresponding to Chapter 26 of the &quot;&quot;) as an independent text as: &quot;The Ten Grounds Sutra: The Daśabhūmika Sūtra: the Ten Highest Levels of Practice on the Bodhisattva&#x27;s Path to Buddhahood&quot; (2019). This was translated by Bhikshu Dharmamitra from Tripitaka Master Kumārajīva&#x27;s circa 410 ce Sanskrit-to-Chinese translation of the Daśabhūmika Sūtra (T0286).

The publisher Bukkyo Dendo Kyokai (BDK) has finished editing and is currently (as of July, 2022) in the process of preparing for publication an unannotated multi-volume edition of Bhikshu Dharmamitra&#x27;s &quot;Flower Adornment Sutra&quot; which also includes Bhikshu Dharmamitra&#x27;s translation of the traditionally appended conclusion to Chapter 39, &quot;The Conduct and Vows of Samantabhadra&quot; originally translated by Tripitaka Master Prajñā.

Both the &quot;Gaṇḍavyūha&quot; and the &quot;Daśabhūmika&quot; (which together constitute approximately one third of the &quot;&quot;) have been independently translated from the Tibetan version by Peter Alan Roberts along with 84000.co as:
* &quot;The Ten Bhūmis Chapter from the Mahāvaipulya Sūtra &quot;A Multitude of Buddhas&quot; 
* &quot;The Stem Array&quot; Chapter from the Mahāvaipulya Sūtra &quot;A Multitude of Buddhas&quot; 

These translations are freely available on the 84000 website.

The City of Ten Thousand Buddhas is also producing a translation of the &quot; (which they title &quot;The Great Means Expansive Buddha Flower Adornment Sutra&quot;) along with a lengthy commentary by Venerable Hsuan Hua. Currently over twenty volumes are available, and it is estimated that there may be 75-100 volumes in the complete edition.

<text>William &quot;Shooby&quot; Taylor (September 19, 1929 – June 4, 2003) was an American jazz vocalist famous for scat singing over various records, including those of the Ink Spots, the Harmonicats, Johnny Cash, Miles Davis, Mozart, and Cristy Lane, in a baritone voice.

Nicknamed &quot;The Human Horn&quot;, he is noted for his highly idiosyncratic scat style, using sounds and syllables quite unlike those used by other scat singers. 

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Marc Ferris noted that &quot;those who seek out music that swims against the mainstream have been entranced by [Taylor&#x27;s] originality.&quot; 

Music historian Irwin Chusid described Taylor as &quot;the world&#x27;s weirdest scat singer,&quot; &quot;100 percent uninhibited and soulful, in a lovably demented way,&quot; and stated that &quot;a joyousness permeates [his] performances, a celebratory quality that serves as an analgesic for temporary relief from existential pain.&quot;

==Biography==
On September 19, 1929, Shooby Taylor was born in Indiana Township, Pennsylvania, a month before the Great Depression. In March of 1931, at the age of 18 months, Taylor moved to Harlem, New York City, where he spent the majority of his life. Taylor stuttered in his youth. 

Circa 1946, Taylor married Sadie A.K.A. &quot;Peaches&quot; (last name unspecified), and at the age of 17 he had a son named William H. Taylor, Jr. The couple later divorced but remained friends until Sadie&#x27;s death in the 1980s.

Taylor did not graduate high school. Circa 1947, as an 18-year-old, Taylor was drafted into the Army, and he wished to enter as a medic. However, due to his alcoholism, the army rejected him, marking him 4-F (unfit for service). Taylor overcame his alcoholism with Alcoholics Anonymous and Christian beliefs. The Selective Service System accepted Taylor when he was 23 in 1953, and he was sent to train in Augusta, Georgia for assignment to Korea.

Following his discharge in 1955, he began working as a clerk. for the U.S. Post Office. Under the G.I. Bill of Rights, Taylor began studying at the Hartnett National Music Studio on 46th Street and 8th Ave in New York; his major was saxophone and his minor was in singing. A long-time jazz fan, he claimed he heard sounds in his head and felt the need to express them. After attempting to learn the saxophone, he realized he could instead employ his voice as an instrument, declaring &quot;I am the horn!&quot; In his youth, Taylor visited Catholic churches, Pentecostal churches, synagogues, and mosques and enjoyed all of the religious music, claiming, &quot;All of them had good music that was good to them and good to me.&quot;

While in school, Taylor&#x27;s voice teacher warned him that scatting would ruin his voice, and he stopped immediately, but eventually returned. Taylor performed at Harlem clubs and in Greenwich Village jam sessions, emulating the vocal style of Babs Gonzales; Gonzalez was Taylor&#x27;s idol as a teenager.

He claimed to have gotten permission from Dizzy Gillespie to use the nickname &quot;Shooby;&quot; when he met Gillespie in a lobby in the 1970s and asked for permission, Gillespie stated, &quot;Yeah, go ahead, guy! Go ahead!&quot; Taylor adopted the moniker &quot;Shooby Taylor, The Human Horn.&quot; 

In 2002, he described his days working as a clerk at the Post Office:I used to work from 4 to 12 so I can get off work and work the clubs...because I tried to make a name for myself. I would go to jam session nights, you see. I was unknown, trying to get my name known.In the 1970s, he suffered a workplace injury and retired from the Post Office. Taylor&#x27;s pension allowed him to devote his time to music, making numerous home recordings. In 1983, Taylor briefly appeared on the show &quot;Amateur Night at the Apollo,&quot; but was booed off the stage after roughly twenty seconds. This may be the only remaining video of his performances. In 2002, when asked to recall the event, Taylor recalled:I was hurt, very hurt because I got booed off...And then I figured, &quot;Oh, I did it wrong.&quot; But after months and months of thinking about it, I said, &quot;I did it the way how I wanted to do it!&quot;Circa 1983, Taylor paid multiple visits to Angel Sound Studios in Times Square, where he recorded a number of tracks, and where he came to the attention of studio engineer Craig Bradley, who recalled &quot;I was attuned to the unusual... Shooby was an exciting character, someone you were drawn to right away.&quot; Bradley later transferred the tracks to cassette and sent copies to WFMU manager Ken Freedman, who, with Irwin Chusid, began broadcasting and circulating them, leading to a growing cult following for Taylor and &quot;generating a frothing fan base.&quot; Taylor, however, was unaware of the publicity, and his fans were unaware of his whereabouts. In 1992, Taylor moved to a senior complex in Newark, New Jersey.

In 1993, Taylor&#x27;s last public performance was in a bar on West 23rd Street. The following year, he experienced a stroke that impaired his ability to scat, preventing him from recording and performing. In 1995, he was invited to be a guest on the Late Night with David Letterman show, but declined because he was still recovering from his stroke.

In 2000, two of Taylor&#x27;s songs, covers of &quot;Stout-Hearted Men&quot; and &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot;, were released as part of the outsider music compilation album &quot;Songs in the Key of Z&quot;, leading to further recognition.

In July 2002, Elektra Records executive and Taylor fan Rick Goetz managed to track Taylor down by cold-calling every person named William Taylor in the New York area, and finally was able to contact his son, William H. Taylor, Jr. 

On August 28, 2002, Shooby appeared for a radio interview on WFMU, leading to further publicity. Following the broadcast, Goetz and Chusid transferred a number of Taylor&#x27;s home recordings to CD-R to preserve some of his legacy. In September of that year, WFMU staff delivered birthday greetings to Taylor from fans around the world.

As of 2002, he continued to attend church regularly; his Newark nursing home held a service every Sunday and Tuesday night.

Taylor died on June 4, 2003, at the VA Hospital in East Orange, New Jersey, at the age of 73.

At the end of posthumous album &quot;Shooby Taylor: The Human Horn (Side Two),&quot; after Taylor&#x27;s cover of &quot;Over the Rainbow,&quot; he briefly addresses his audience:Okay, I hope you enjoyed the tunes that I&#x27;ve done by the great artists. &quot;Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise-ye the Lord.&quot; I&#x27;ve given you maybe not what you want, but hopefully what you need. The end. Shooby Taylor.

==Style and reception==
In 2000, Irwin Chusid wrote that Taylor&#x27;s scatting &quot;echoes Mother Goose nonsense simmering in a rich Afro-Yiddish stew.&quot; According to Chusid, &quot;Shooby&#x27;s vocabulary is a whole &#x27;nuther language. Some of his favorite scat syllables are &#x27;Raw-shaw,&#x27; &#x27;poppy-poppy,&#x27; and &#x27;splaw,&#x27; sputtered in a virile baritone vaguely reminiscent of Dudley Do-Right, the chaos-prone Canadian Mountie,&quot; and &quot;his lung capacity is staggering; he never pauses long enough to inhale as he spews out astonishing high-octane vocal runs.&quot; 

Circa 2000, singer Joe Henry described Taylor&#x27;s singing as &quot;a cross between scat singing and speaking in tongues,&quot; stating that it was &quot;unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever heard in my life. A lot of people who hear it think of it like a novelty, but I hear it as a man who&#x27;s completely come out of a vacuum and developed an approach to music that&#x27;s as unique as Charlie Parker... I can&#x27;t stop listening to it. It&#x27;s so full of a kind of passion that I can&#x27;t even begin to describe.&quot;

In 2002, Marc Ferris wrote that Taylor&#x27;s music can be &quot;difficult to digest. As he tries to approximate the sound of a saxophone solo with his voice, he hits sour notes. He spits out nonsense syllables like a machine gun, communicating in a private language nearly impossible to imitate. And he rarely meshes with his background music.&quot; 

In 2020, Allmusic reviewer Jason Ankeny described his music as &quot;singular and eccentric... equal parts nonsense words, off-tempo vocalese, and saxophone-inspired squawks.&quot; 

While scatting, Taylor would frequently mime playing an &quot;air&quot; saxophone. Craig Bradley recalled that all of Taylor&#x27;s recordings were first takes: &quot;I think he was just winging it, improvising. So even if we did a second take, it wouldn&#x27;t be to fix mistakes, it would just be a different version. But he was happy with his performance every time.&quot; An example is his two versions of &quot;Over the Rainbow;&quot; one of them being with a band sound and other with a piano accompaniment, while both have completely different melodies.

==Legacy==
During the 1990s, UK TV series &quot;Adam and Joe Show&quot; used the first 4 seconds of Taylor&#x27;s version of &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot;, at the start of their theme tune.

In the 2000 song &quot;Walk &amp; Chew Gum&quot; by the band Optiganally Yours, there is a mention of &quot;Shooby Taylor&quot; in the last line of their scat-like bridge.

In 2005, Taylor made a posthumous appearance on a split 7-inch EP by Xiu Xiu and The Dead Science.

In the 2016 Illumination Entertainment animated film &quot;Sing,&quot; a recording of Taylor&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Stout-Hearted Man&quot; is used for a hippopotamus&#x27;s audition.

In 2017, a posthumous compilation of Taylor&#x27;s work, entitled &quot;The Human Horn&quot;, was digitally released under the Songs in the Key of Z label. Dozens of these songs were not published during his lifetime. The label also distributes the &quot;Songs in the Key of Z&quot; compilation records.

In 2019, Taylor was the subject of a BBC Radio 4 broadcast by Adam Buxton.

Circa 2000, musicians Tom Waits and Marshall Crenshaw described themselves as fans of Taylor&#x27;s music, with Crenshaw proclaiming Taylor &quot;The King of Farfisa-Wielding, Outer-Space, Lunatic-Fringe Scat Singers.&quot;

<doc id="293833" wikidata="Q27567" url="?curid=293833" title="Abaza language">
<text>Abaza (, ; ) is a Northwest Caucasian language spoken by Abazins in Russia. The language has gone through several different orthographies based primarily on Latin and Cyrillic letters. Its consonant-to-vowel ratio is remarkably high; making it quite similar to many other languages from the same parent chain. The language evolved in popularity in the mid to late 1800s, but has become an endangered language.

Abaza is spoken by approximately 35,000 people in Russia, where it is written in a Cyrillic alphabet, as well as another 10,000 in Turkey, where the Latin script is used.
It consists of two dialects, the Ashkherewa dialect and the T&#x27;ap&#x27;anta dialect, which is the literary standard. The language also consists of five subdialects known as Psyzh-Krasnovostok, Abazakt, Apsua, Kubin-Elburgan and Kuvin.

Abaza, like its relatives in the family of Northwest Caucasian languages, is a highly agglutinative language. For example, the verb in the English sentence &quot;He couldn&#x27;t make them give it back to her&quot; contains four arguments (a term used in valency grammar): &quot;he&quot;, &quot;them&quot;, &quot;it&quot;, &quot;to her&quot;. Abaza marks arguments morphologically, and incorporates all four arguments as pronominal prefixes on the verb.

It has a large consonantal inventory (63 phonemes) coupled with a minimal vowel inventory (two vowels). It is very closely related to Abkhaz, but it preserves a few phonemes which Abkhaz lacks, such as a voiced pharyngeal fricative. Work on Abaza has been carried out by W. S. Allen, Brian O&#x27;Herin, and John Colarusso.

== History ==
Different forms of cultural assimilation contributed to its fall in use in areas of Russia, and over time its overall endangerment. The language can be broken into five different dialects and has several unique grammatical approaches to languages. The Abaza language was at its peak usage in the mid to late 19th century.

Abaza speakers along the Greater and Lesser Laba, Urup, and Greater and Lesser Zelenchuk rivers are from a wave of migrants in the 17th to 18th centuries who represent the Abaza speakers of today. The end of the Great Caucasian War in 1864 provided Russia with power and control of the local regions and contributed to the decrease in the popularity of pre-existing local languages prior to the war.

The Abaza language was not a written language until the Latin alphabet was adopted in 1932–1933 to write it. The Cyrillic script was later utilized to write the language in 1938. A small amount of books, pamphlets, and a newspaper were published in the Abaza language afterwards.

== Geographic distribution ==
The Abaza language is spoken in Russia and Turkey. Although it is endangered, it is still spoken in several regions in Russia. These include Kara-Pago, Kubina, Psyzh, El&#x27;burgan, Inzhich-Chukun, Koi-dan, Abaza-Khabl&#x27;, Malo-Abazinka, Tapanta, Krasnovostochni, Novokuvinski, Starokuvinski, Abazakt and Ap-sua.

== Phonology ==
The vowels may have a in front of it. The vowels and are allophones of and (respectively) before palatalized consonants, while the vowels and are allophones of and (respectively) before labialized consonants. The vowels , , , and can also occur as variants of the sequences //, //, // and //.

== Orthography ==
Since 1938, Abaza has been written with the version of the Cyrillic alphabet shown below.

The digraphs Лӏ and Фӏ are dialectal, and are therefore absent from the literary language and the official alphabet.

== Sample text ==
==Notable speakers==
Sultan Laguchev, a singer-songwriter famous in Russia, writes and performs songs in the Abaza language, including &quot;Абыгъь гӏважьква&quot; and &quot;БаъапI бара.&quot; He has written an additional song in Russian entitled &quot;Мы абазины&quot; (&#x27;We are Abazins&#x27;) about Abazinia.

<doc id="293834" wikidata="Q724406" url="?curid=293834" title="Derek and the Dominos">
<text>Derek and the Dominos was an English–American blues rock band formed in the spring of 1970 by singer-guitarist Eric Clapton, keyboardist-singer Bobby Whitlock, bassist Carl Radle and drummer Jim Gordon. All four members had previously played together in Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends, during and after Clapton&#x27;s brief tenure with Blind Faith. Dave Mason supplied additional lead guitar on early studio sessions and played at their first live gig. Another participant at their first session as a band was George Harrison, the recording for whose album &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; marked the formation of Derek and the Dominos.

The band&#x27;s only full-length release, &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot;, was produced by Tom Dowd, which also featured extensive contributions on lead and slide guitar from Duane Allman. A double album, &quot;Layla&quot; did not immediately enjoy strong sales or receive widespread radio airplay, but went on to earn critical acclaim. Although released in 1970 it was not until March 1972 that the album&#x27;s single &quot;Layla&quot; (a tale of unrequited love inspired by Clapton&#x27;s infatuation with his friend George Harrison&#x27;s wife, Pattie Boyd) made the top ten in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The album is often considered to be the defining achievement of Clapton&#x27;s career.

==History==
===Background and formation===

Derek and the Dominos came about through its four members&#x27; involvement in the American soul revue Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dominos/AM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The group were anchored by the musical duo Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett with a rotating ensemble of supporting members. Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends supported Blind Faith, Eric Clapton&#x27;s short-lived supergroup with Stevie Winwood, on a US tour in the summer of 1969. While on that tour, Clapton was drawn to Delaney &amp; Bonnie&#x27;s relative anonymity, which he found more appealing than the excessive fan worship lavished on his own band.

Together with his fellow future Dominos – Bobby Whitlock (vocals, keyboards), Carl Radle (bass) and Jim Gordon (drums) – Clapton toured Europe and the United States again between November 1969 and March 1970, this time as a member of Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends. In addition, the entire band backed him on his debut solo album, &quot;Eric Clapton&quot;, recorded over the same period. Disagreements over money led several members to leave Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends. Whitlock, recalling other difficulties with Delaney and Bonnie, noted the couple&#x27;s frequent fights and described Delaney as a demanding band leader in the manner of James Brown. Gordon, Radle and other Friends personnel, including drummer Jim Keltner, immediately joined Joe Cocker&#x27;s &quot;Mad Dogs and Englishmen&quot; tour with Leon Russell, but Whitlock remained with Delaney and Bonnie for a short time.

In April 1970, at the suggestion of his friend and mentor Steve Cropper, Whitlock travelled to England to visit Clapton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris/Mojo p 70&quot;&gt;Harris, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitlock subsequently lived in Hurtwood Edge, Clapton&#x27;s house in Surrey, where the two musicians jammed and began to write the bulk of the Dominos&#x27; catalogue on acoustic guitars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sutcliffe/Mojo&quot;&gt; Available at Rock&#x27;s Backpages (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the new songs reflected Clapton&#x27;s growing infatuation with Pattie Boyd, the wife of his best friend George Harrison,&lt;ref name=&quot;Layla40/Goldmine&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; who had joined Clapton as a guitarist on Delaney &amp; Bonnie&#x27;s European tour in December 1969.
Soon after Whitlock&#x27;s arrival, he and Clapton were eager to form a new band and contacted Radle and Gordon in the United States. Although their first choice for a drummer was Keltner – like Radle and Russell, a native of Tulsa – he was busy recording with jazz guitarist Gábor Szabó. Gordon, however, had been invited to London to work on Harrison&#x27;s post-Beatles solo album &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. In May that year, Clapton, Whitlock, Radle and Gordon reunited in London at a session for P.P. Arnold,&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris/Mojo p 72&quot;&gt;Harris, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; before going on to serve as the backing band on much of Harrison&#x27;s album. In a 1990 interview, Clapton said, &quot;We made our bones, really, on that album with George&quot;, since the four musicians had &quot;no game plan&quot; other than living at Hurtwood Edge, &quot;getting stoned, and playing and semi-writing songs&quot;.

Clapton biographer Harry Shapiro comments on the unprecedented aspect of Clapton&#x27;s bond with his new bandmates, in that from the Blind Faith tour onwards, the guitarist &quot;had been able to build a working relationship in a slow and natural fashion&quot; for the first time. Among the friendships formed before the group officially came into existence, Shapiro continues, &quot;the empathy ... outcropped most noticeably in Bobby Whitlock, in whom Eric found an accomplished and sympathetic songwriting partner and back-up vocalist.&quot; Clapton and Whitlock considered adding the Delaney &amp; Bonnie horn section to their new band, but this plan was abandoned. Whitlock later explained the ethos of Derek and the Dominos: &quot;we didn&#x27;t want any horns, we didn&#x27;t want no chicks, we wanted a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band. But my vocal concept was that we approach singing like Sam and Dave did: [Clapton] sings a line, I sing a line, we sing together.&quot;

===Concert debut===
Towards the end of the sessions for the basic tracks on &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, Dave Mason – another former guitarist with Delaney &amp; Bonnie – joined the Dominos at Clapton&#x27;s home. With the lineup expanded to a five-piece band, Derek and the Dominos gave their debut live performance on 14 June 1970. The event was a charity concert in aid of the Dr Spock Civil Liberties Legal Defence Fund, held at London&#x27;s Lyceum Theatre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapiro/Mojo&quot;&gt; Available at Rock&#x27;s Backpages (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt;

The group had been billed as &quot;Eric Clapton and Friends&quot;, but a discussion ensued backstage just before their appearance, with Harrison and pianist Tony Ashton among those involved, in an effort to find a proper band name. Clapton recalls that Ashton suggested &quot;Del and the Dominos&quot;, having taken to calling the guitarist &quot;Derek&quot; or &quot;Del&quot; since the Delaney &amp; Bonnie tour the previous year. Whitlock maintains that &quot;the Dynamics&quot; was the name chosen and that Ashton, following his opening set with Ashton, Gardner and Dyke, mispronounced it when introducing the band. Writing in 2013, Clapton and Whitlock biographer Marc Roberty quoted Jeff Dexter, the compere at the Lyceum show, who recalled that &quot;Derek and the Dominos&quot; had already been decided on before they went on stage. According to Dexter, Clapton was immediately taken with the name, but Whitlock, Radle and Gordon – all Americans – were concerned that they might be mistaken for a doo-wop act.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeRiso/SN&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The reception afforded the band from critics and fans was mixed. Together with the unfavourable reviews for Clapton&#x27;s eponymous solo album, particularly in Britain, this reaction was reflective of a widespread reluctance to view Clapton as a singer and frontman, rather than as the virtuoso guitarist synonymous with his role in bands such as Cream and The Yardbirds. In his 2007 autobiography, Clapton wrote that his main recollection of the Lyceum show was consulting New Orleans–born musician Dr. John, a self-styled practitioner of voodoo, and receiving a package made of straw that would serve as a means of winning Boyd&#x27;s affection.

===Recording with Phil Spector===
In return for the Dominos&#x27; assistance on &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, Clapton and Harrison had agreed that the latter&#x27;s co-producer, Phil Spector, would produce a single for the new group.&lt;ref name=&quot;White/Spin&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 June, the five band members, together with Harrison on guitar, took part in a session for the single at the Beatles&#x27; Apple Studio in central London. With Spector producing, two Clapton–Whitlock compositions were recorded that day – &quot;Tell the Truth&quot; and &quot;Roll It Over&quot; – along with two instrumental jams that would be included on the &quot;Apple Jam&quot; disc of Harrison&#x27;s triple album.

After this London session, Mason departed from the lineup; he later told &quot;Melody Maker&quot; that he was impatient to see the band start working full-time whereas Clapton was committed to helping Harrison complete &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. Clapton and Whitlock then contributed to the overdubbing phase of Harrison&#x27;s album, including adding backing vocals with Harrison (as &quot;the George O&#x27;Hara-Smith Singers&quot;) to tracks such as &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; and &quot;Awaiting on You All&quot;. In addition, while continuing to rehearse at Hurtwood Edge, all four band members participated in London sessions for Dr. John&#x27;s album &quot;The Sun, Moon &amp; Herbs&quot; (1971).

===UK summer tour===
Early in the summer of 1970, Clapton asked former Apple Records employee Chris O&#x27;Dell to find accommodation for Whitlock, Gordon and Radle in central London, telling O&#x27;Dell that they were &quot;going bonkers&quot; out in the Surrey countryside. The band then moved into a two-storey flat at 33 Thurloe Place, close to South Kensington tube station. The flat also served as a meeting place for Clapton and Boyd, who found herself flattered by Clapton&#x27;s attention in light of her husband&#x27;s infidelities and his preoccupation with Eastern spirituality. In his autobiography, Clapton wrote that he was both inspired and &quot;tormented&quot; by his feelings for Boyd, which he channelled into his music, beginning with a UK tour by Derek and the Dominos.

For three weeks from 1 August, the group performed in clubs and other small venues in Britain, where Clapton chose to play anonymously, still weary from the fame that he felt had plagued Cream and Blind Faith. Admission for the shows was set at £1, and clauses in the contract with each venue stipulated that Clapton&#x27;s name was not to be used as a crowd-puller. Shapiro writes that the band had &quot;made great strides&quot; since the Lyceum concert; their set list included &quot;Tell the Truth&quot;, covers of Billy Myles&#x27; &quot;Have You Ever Loved a Woman&quot; and Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Little Wing&quot;, and songs such as &quot;Bottle of Red Wine&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Know Why&quot;, both from the &quot;Eric Clapton&quot; album. Clapton has said of this UK tour, &quot;no one knew who we were, and I loved it. I loved the fact that we were this little quartet, playing in obscure places, sometimes to audiences of no more than fifty or sixty people.&quot;

===&quot;Layla&quot; sessions===

The band flew to Miami, Florida, on 23 August 1970 to begin recording with Atlantic Records producer Tom Dowd. Until early September, sessions took place at Criteria Studios for what became the double album &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot;. Most of the material, particularly the track &quot;Layla&quot;, was inspired by Clapton&#x27;s unrequited love for Boyd.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williamson/Uncut&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray/AVClub&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After Clapton and Whitlock&#x27;s initial experimentation with heroin while recording &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, the band&#x27;s time in Miami was marked by all four members&#x27; excessive use of hard drugs. According to Clapton, &quot;We were staying in this hotel on the beach, and whatever drug you wanted, you could get it at the newsstand. The girl would just take your orders.&quot; The Thunderbird Motel, in current Sunny Isles Beach, Florida.

The first few days of the &quot;Layla&quot; sessions were unproductive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black/Blender&quot;&gt; Available at Rock&#x27;s Backpages (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 August, Dowd, who was also producing the Allman Brothers Band&#x27;s album &quot;Idlewild South&quot;, took the Dominos to an Allman Brothers concert, where Clapton, already a fan of the Nashville-born guitarist, first heard Duane Allman play in person. After Clapton invited the whole band back to Criteria that night, he and Allman formed an instant bond that provided the catalyst for the &quot;Layla&quot; album. Over ten recording dates,&lt;ref name=&quot;Williamson/Layla review&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Allman contributed to most of the tracks on the album, in between his commitments to the Allman Brothers Band. Only three songs – &quot;I Looked Away&quot;, &quot;Bell Bottom Blues&quot; and &quot;Keep on Growing&quot; – were recorded without his participation. The band remade &quot;Tell the Truth&quot; during the sessions and subsequently attempted to have the Spector-produced single cancelled. In the United States, Atco Records released the original version of &quot;Tell the Truth&quot; backed with &quot;Roll It Over&quot; in September, but soon withdrew the single.

Clapton has described Allman as &quot;the musical brother that I never had, but wished I did&quot;. Allman&#x27;s slide guitar playing elevated the album&#x27;s blues covers, which included &quot;Nobody Knows You When You&#x27;re Down and Out&quot; (by Jimmy Cox), &quot;Have You Ever Loved a Woman&quot; (the Billy Myles song, originally recorded by Freddie King) and &quot;Key to the Highway&quot; (Big Bill Broonzy). Clapton invited him to become a member of Derek and the Dominos, but Allman demurred, choosing to remain loyal to his own band. According to Whitlock, however, Allman was &quot;a hired gun&quot; and an &quot;unnecessary&quot; addition; Whitlock added, &quot;He played with us twice, and it was not good both times he played, because he was not a fluid player ... He could play parts, but he couldn&#x27;t sing with his guitar.&quot; The jams from Allman&#x27;s first night at Criteria with the Dominos were issued on the second CD of &quot;The Layla Sessions: 20th Anniversary Edition&quot; in 1990.

The album&#x27;s best-known track, &quot;Layla&quot;, was compiled from recordings from two separate sessions. The main, guitar-oriented section was taped on 9 September, after the band had recorded their version of Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Little Wing&quot;; the closing section was added several weeks later, after Clapton had decided that the song lacked a suitable ending. The answer was an elegiac piano piece composed by Gordon (and an uncredited Rita Coolidge) and played by the drummer, with Whitlock providing a second piano part to cover Gordon&#x27;s relative inexperience on the instrument. During the &quot;Layla&quot; sessions, Gordon had been writing and playing songs for an intended solo album when, by chance, Clapton first heard the piano piece. According to Clapton&#x27;s recollection, in return for continuing to use the Dominos&#x27; studio time for his own project, Gordon agreed to have the segment used as the ending for &quot;Layla&quot;.

===October–December 1970 live shows===
After the recording of &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot;, the four-piece Derek and the Dominos returned to the UK to continue touring there before heading back to America to start the US tour on 15 October. Allman performed two shows with the group near the end of the US tour: at Curtis Hixon Hall, in Tampa, Florida, on 1 December, and at the Onondaga County War Memorial in Syracuse, New York, the following night.

Whitlock recalled of their drug consumption during the tour: &quot;We didn&#x27;t have little bits of anything. There were no grams around, let&#x27;s just put it like that. Tom couldn&#x27;t believe it, the way we had these big bags laying out everywhere. I&#x27;m almost ashamed to tell it, but it&#x27;s the truth. It was scary, what we were doing, but we were just young and dumb and didn&#x27;t know. Cocaine and heroin, that&#x27;s all and Johnny Walker.&quot; Elton John, who opened for them, said that despite the reports of drugs and booze, &quot;They were phenomenal. From the side of the stage, I took mental notes of their performance ... it was their keyboard player Bobby Whitlock that I watched like a hawk ... You watched and you learned, from people that had more experience than you.&quot; In 1973, a live double album, titled &quot;In Concert&quot;, was released, culled from the band&#x27;s October 1970 shows at the Fillmore East in New York City. Six of the recordings from that album were digitally remastered, remixed and expanded with additional material from the same shows to become &quot;Live at the Fillmore&quot;, released in 1994.

===Album release===
&quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot; was issued in November 1970. According to Shapiro, relative to the band and Dowd&#x27;s high expectations, it was a &quot;critical and commercial flop&quot;. Clapton similarly describes &quot;Layla&quot; as having &quot;died a death&quot; on release. Although it received favourable reviews in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, the album missed the top ten in the United States and failed to chart at all in the United Kingdom, until a reissue on CD resulted in a one-week stay at number 68 in 2011. It garnered little attention, partly as a result of a lack of promotion by Polydor, and partly due to the public&#x27;s ignorance of Clapton&#x27;s presence in the band. Dowd said that he &quot;felt it was the best album I&#x27;d been involved with since &quot;The Genius of Ray Charles&quot;&quot; and was disappointed at the lack of acclaim it initially received.

&quot;Layla&quot; was included on &quot;The History of Eric Clapton&quot; in 1972, and Atlantic issued the song as a single in July that year. It became a hit, reaching number 10 in America and number 7 in Britain. The success of the title track in 1972 led to a reappraisal of &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot;. It has since received widespread critical acclaim and has been ranked among the best albums of all time by VH1 (at number 89) and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (number 115). &quot;Layla&quot; is considered one of Clapton&#x27;s most outstanding achievements.

===&quot;Johnny Cash Show&quot; appearance===
The band appeared on &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot;, in their only television appearance. Filmed at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, and broadcast on 6 January 1971, the band performed &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot; and then joined Cash and Carl Perkins to play Perkins&#x27; &quot;Matchbox&quot;.

===Tragedy and dissolution===
Tragedy and misfortune dogged the group throughout and following its brief career. In September 1970, Clapton was devastated by the death of his friend and professional rival Jimi Hendrix; having just recorded a version of &quot;Little Wing&quot; in Miami, the Dominos included the track on &quot;Layla&quot; as a tribute to Hendrix. In October 1971, Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident. Clapton later wrote in his autobiography that he and Allman had been inseparable during the sessions at Criteria. In addition, Clapton took the lukewarm critical and commercial reception to &quot;Layla&quot; personally, which accelerated his spiral into drug addiction and depression. In 1985 when talking about the band, Clapton said:

In February 1971, Radle and Gordon participated in sessions, produced by Spector and Harrison, for a planned solo album by Ronnie Spector. Later that year, the Dominos disbanded acrimoniously in London, just before they could complete their second LP. In a subsequent interview with music critic Robert Palmer, Clapton said the second album &quot;broke down halfway through because of the paranoia and tension. And the band just dissolved.&quot; After the dissolution, Clapton turned away from touring and recording to nurse an intense heroin addiction. This three-year career hiatus was interrupted only by his participation in Harrison&#x27;s Concert for Bangladesh shows in August 1971, along with a large cast of musicians, including Leon Russell, Keltner and Radle; a guest appearance at Russell&#x27;s December 1971 show at London&#x27;s Rainbow Theatre; and his own Rainbow Concert, in January 1973. The latter event was organised by Pete Townshend of The Who to help Clapton kick his drug habit and build momentum for his return. Whitlock signed with the US record label ABC-Dunhill, for which he recorded the albums &quot;Bobby Whitlock&quot; and &quot;Raw Velvet&quot;. Both albums were released in 1972 and included contributions from all the Dominos (recorded in early 1971), along with Harrison, the Bramletts, Keltner, and the former Delaney &amp; Bonnie horn section.

Following Clapton&#x27;s return as a solo artist in 1974, he and Radle worked together until 1979, when Clapton abruptly dismissed him from his band. Radle died in June 1980 of complications from a kidney infection associated with alcohol and drug use. Whitlock and Clapton did not work together again until 2000, when they performed on Jools Holland&#x27;s BBC show &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;. In 1983, Gordon, who had undiagnosed schizophrenia at the time, killed his mother with a hammer during a psychotic episode. He was confined to a mental institution in 1984, until his death in 2023. Recordings from the 1971 sessions for the band&#x27;s cancelled second album were included on Clapton&#x27;s four-CD/cassette box set &quot;Crossroads&quot;, released in 1988.

<text>East Asian Yogācāra refers to the Mahayana Buddhist traditions in East Asia which developed out of the Indian Buddhist Yogācāra (lit. &quot;yogic practice&quot;) systems (also known as &quot;Vijñānavāda&quot;, &quot;the doctrine of consciousness&quot; or &quot;Cittamātra&quot;, &quot;mind-only&quot;). In East Asian Buddhism, this school of Buddhist idealism was known as the &quot;Consciousness-Only school&quot; (). 

The 4th-century Gandharan brothers, Asaṅga and Vasubandhu, are considered the classic founders of Indian Yogacara school. The East Asian tradition developed through the work of numerous Buddhist thinkers working in Chinese. They include Bodhiruci, Ratnamati, Huiguang, Paramārtha, Jingying Huiyuan, Zhiyan, Xuanzang and his students Kuiji, Woncheuk and Dōshō. 

The East Asian consciousness only school is traditionally seen as being divided into two main branches. There is the Dharma nature schools (&quot;Fǎxìng zōng&quot;, 法性), which refers to the earliest traditions to develop in China, like Dilun and Shelun, as well as to their specific doctrinal position which often blends buddha-nature thought with Yogācāra. The other branch is the &quot;Dharma Characteristics school&quot; (&quot;Fǎxiàng-zōng&quot;), which is mostly used to refer specifically to the tradition of Xuanzang and tends to focus much more strictly on mainstream Yogācāra philosophy. 

==Names==
In Chinese Buddhism, the overall Yogācāra tradition is mostly called &quot;Wéishí-zōng&quot; (, yusik) which is a translation of the Sanskrit &quot;Vijñānavādin&quot; (&quot;cognition only&quot;, &quot;mere consciousness&quot;). The consciousness-only view is the central philosophical tenet of the school which states that ontologically there are only &quot;vijñāna&quot; (consciousness, mental events). 

Yogācāra may also be referred to as &quot;Yújiāxíng Pài&quot; (瑜伽行派), a direct translation of the Sanskrit term Yogācāra (&quot;Yogic praxis&quot;).

The term &quot;Fǎxiàng-zōng&quot; (&quot;dharma characteristics&quot;, ) was first applied to a branch of Yogacara by the Huayan scholar Chengguan, who used it to characterize the teachings of the school of Xuanzang and the &quot;Cheng Wei Shi Lun&quot; as provisional, dealing with the characteristics of phenomena or dharmas. As such, this name was an outside term used by critics of the school, which eventually was adopted by Weishi nevertheless. Another lesser known name for the school i&quot;s Yǒu Zōng&quot; ( &quot;School of Existence&quot;). Yin Shun also introduced a threefold classification for Buddhist teachings which designates this school as &quot;Xūwàng Wéishí Xì&quot; ( &quot;False Imagination Mere Consciousness System&quot;). 

In opposition to the &quot;Dharma characteristics&quot; view, the term Dharma nature school (&quot;Fǎxìng zōng&quot;, 法性) is used to refer to a form of Yogācāra which blends Yogācāra with buddha-nature (tathagatagarbha) thought, especially with the doctrines of texts like the &quot;Awakening of Faith.&quot; This term would include schools like Dilun, Shelun, Chan, and Huayan, who affirm basic Yogācāra principles like mind-only, while also promoting metaphysical views which are not strictly compatible with orthodox Yogācāra. 

==Characteristics==

Like the Indian parent Yogācāra school, the East Asian Weishi tradition teaches that reality is only consciousness, and rejects the existence of mind-independent objects or matter. Instead, Weishi holds that all phenomena (dharmas) arise from the mind. In this tradition, deluded minds distort the ultimate truth, and project false appearances of independent subjects and objects (which is termed the imagined nature). 

In keeping with Indian Yogācāra tradition, Weishi divides the mind into Eight Consciousnesses and the Four Aspects of Cognition, which produce what we view as reality. The analysis of the eighth, the ālayavijñana, or store-consciousness (阿賴耶識) which is at the root of all experience, is a key feature of all forms of Weishi Buddhism. This root consciousness is also held to be the carrier of all karmic seeds (種子). Another central doctrinal schema for the Weishi traditions is the schema of the three natures (三性).

The central canonical texts of Weishi Buddhism are the classic Indian sutras associated with Yogācāra, such as the &quot;Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra&quot; and the &quot;Daśabhūmikasūtra,&quot; as well as the works associated with Maitreya, Asanga and Vasubandhu, including the &quot;Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra&quot;, &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot;, &quot;Viṃśatikā,&quot; &quot;Triṃśikā&quot;, and the &quot;Xianyang shengjiao lun&quot; (顯揚聖教論, T 1602.31.480b-583b). Besides these Indic works, the &quot;Chéng Wéishì Lùn&quot; (成唯識論&quot;, The Demonstration of Consciousness-only&quot;) compiled by Xuanzang is also a key work of the tradition.

There are different sub-sects of the East Asian Weishi, including the early &quot;Dharma-nature&quot; schools such as Dilun and Shelun, the school of Xuanzang, as well as Korean and Japanese branches of Weishi.

==History in mainland Asia==
Translations of Indian Yogācāra texts were first introduced to China in the early fifth century. Among these was Guṇabhadra&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; in four fascicles, which would also become important in the early history of Chan Buddhism. Another early set of translations where two texts by Dharmakṣema (Ch: Tan Wuchen 曇無讖; 385–433): the &quot;Bodhisattvabhūmi-sūtra&quot; (&quot;Pusa di chi jing&quot; 菩薩地持經; &quot;Stages of the Bodhisattva Path&quot;), and the &quot;Bodhisattva Prātimokṣa&quot; (which contains excerpts from the &quot;Yogācārabhūmi&quot;).

The earliest Yogacara traditions were the Dilun (&quot;Daśabhūmika&quot;) and Shelun (&quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot;) schools, which were based on Chinese translations of Indian Yogacara treatises. The Dilun and Shelun schools followed traditional Indian Yogacara teachings along with tathāgatagarbha (i.e. buddha-nature) teachings, and as such were really hybrids of Yogācāra and tathāgatagarbha. While these schools were eventually eclipsed by other Chinese Buddhist traditions, their ideas were preserved and developed by later thinkers, including the Korean monks Woncheuk (–696) and Wohnyo, and the patriarchs of the Huayan school like Zhiyan (602–668), who himself studied under Dilun and Shelun masters and Fazang (643–712).

===Dilun school===
The Dilun or Daśabhūmikā school (Sanskrit. Chinese: 地論宗; pinyin &quot;di lun zong,&quot; &quot;School of the Treatise on the Bhūmis&quot;) was a tradition that derived from the translators Bodhiruci (Putiliuzhi 菩提流支; d. 527) and Ratnamati (Lenamoti 勒那摩提; d.u.). Both translators worked on Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Shidijing lun&quot; (十地經論, Sanskrit: &quot;*Daśabhūmi-vyākhyāna&quot; or &quot;*Daśabhūmika-sūtra-śāstra, &quot;Commentary on the Daśabhūmikasūtra&quot;&quot;), producing a translation during the Northern Wei.

Bodhiruci and Ratnamati ended up disagreeing on how to interpret Yogacara doctrine and thus, this tradition eventually split into northern and southern schools. During the Northern and Southern Dynasties era this was the most popular Yogacara school. The northern school followed the interpretations and teachings of Bodhiruci (6th century CE) while the southern school followed Ratnamati. Modern scholars argue that the influential treatise called the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot; was written by someone in the northern Dilun tradition of Bodhiruci. Ratnamati also translated the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; (究竟一乘寶性論 Taisho no. 1611), an influential buddha-nature treatise. 
According to Hans-Rudolf Kantor, one of the most important doctrinal differences and points of contention between the southern and northern Dilun schools was &quot;the question of whether the ālaya-consciousness is constituted of both reality and purity, and is identical with the pure mind (Southern Way), or whether it comprises exclusively falsehood, and is a mind of defilements giving rise to the unreal world of sentient beings (Northern Way).&quot;

According to Daochong (道寵), a student of Bodhiruci and the main representative of the northern school, the storehouse consciousness is not ultimately real and buddha-nature is something that one acquires only after attaining Buddhahood (that is, the storehouse consciousness ceases and transforms into the buddha-nature). On the other hand, the southern school of Ratnamatiʼs student Huiguang (慧光) held that the storehouse consciousness was real and synonymous with buddha-nature, which is immanent in all sentient beings like a jewel in a trash heap. Other important figures of the southern school were Huiguangʼs disciple Fashang (法上, 495–580), and Fashangʼs disciple Jingying Huiyuan (淨影慧遠, 523–592). This school&#x27;s doctrine was later passed on to the Huayan school via Zhiyan.

An important founding figure of the southern Dilun, Huiguang (468–537) was the leading disciple of Ratnamati, who composed various commentaries, including: &quot;Commentary on the Ten Grounds Sutra&quot; (十地論疏 (Shidilun shu), &quot;Commentary on the Flower Garland Sutra&quot; (華嚴經疏 Huayanjing shu), &quot;Commentary on the Nirvana Sutra&quot; (涅槃經疏 Niepanjing shu) and &quot;Commentary on the Sutra of Queen Srimala&quot; (人王經疏 Renwangjing shu).

=== Shelun school ===
During the sixth century CE, the Indian monk and translator Paramārtha (Zhendi 真諦; 499–569) widely propagated Yogācāra teachings in China. His translations include the &quot;Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra&quot;, the &quot;Madhyāntavibhāga-kārikā&quot;, the &quot;Triṃśikā-vijñaptimātratā&quot;, Dignāga’s &quot;Ālambana-parīkṣā&quot; (&quot;Wu xiang si chen lun&quot; 無相思塵論), the &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot; and the &quot;Viniścayasaṃgrahaṇī&quot; (Juedingzang lun 決定藏論; a part of the a Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra). Paramārtha also taught widely on the principles of Consciousness Only, and developed a large following in southern China. Many monks and laypeople traveled long distances to hear his teachings, especially those on the &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot;. This tradition was known as the Shelun school (摂論宗, &quot;Shelun zong&quot;).

The most distinctive teaching of this school was the doctrine of the &quot;pure consciousness&quot; or &quot;immaculate consciousness&quot; (&quot;amalavijñāna&quot;, Ch: &quot;amoluoshi&quot; 阿摩羅識 or &quot;wugou shi&quot; 無垢識). Paramārtha taught that there was a pure and permanent (&quot;nitya&quot;) consciousness that is unaffected by suffering or mental afflictions, is not a basis for the defilements (unlike the &quot;ālayavijñāna&quot;), but rather is a basis for the noble path (&quot;āryamārga&quot;). Thus, the immaculate consciousness is the purifying counteragent to all the defilements. According to Paramārtha, at the moment of enlightenment, one experiences a “transformation of the basis” (&quot;āśrayaparāvṛtti&quot;) which leads to the cessation of the storehouse consciousness, leaving only the immaculate consciousness. Some texts attributed to Paramārtha also state that the perfected nature (&quot;pariniṣpannasvabhāva&quot;) is equivalent to the &quot;amalavijñāna.&quot; Furthermore, some sources attributed to Paramārtha also identify the immaculate consciousness with the “innate purity of the mind” (prakṛtiprabhāsvaracitta), which links the idea with the doctrine of Buddha nature.

=== Xuanzang&#x27;s school ===

By the time of Xuanzang (602 – 664), Yogācāra teachings had already been propagated widely in China, but there were many conflicting interpretations among the different schools. At the age of 33, Xuanzang made a dangerous journey to India in order to study Buddhism there and to procure Buddhist texts for translation into Chinese. He sought to put an end to the various debates in Chinese consciousness-only Buddhism by obtaining all the key Indian sources and receiving direct instruction from Indian masters. Xuanzang&#x27;s journey was later the subject of legend and eventually fictionalized as the classic Chinese novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, a major component of East Asian popular culture from Chinese opera to Japanese television (&quot;Monkey Magic&quot;).

Xuanzang spent over ten years in India traveling and studying under various Buddhist masters. These masters included Śīlabhadra, the abbot of the Nālandā Mahāvihāra, who was then 106 years old. Xuanzang was tutored in the Yogācāra teachings by Śīlabhadra for several years at Nālandā. Upon his return from India, Xuanzang brought with him a wagon-load of Buddhist texts, including important Yogācāra works such as the &quot;Yogācārabhūmi-śastra&quot;. In total, Xuanzang had procured 657 Buddhist texts from India. Upon his return to China, he was given government support and many assistants for the purpose of translating these texts into Chinese. 

As an important contribution to East Asian Yogācāra, Xuanzang composed the treatise &quot;Cheng Weishi Lun&quot;, or &quot;Discourse on the Establishment of Consciousness Only.&quot; This work is framed around Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Triṃśikā-vijñaptimātratā&quot; (&quot;Thirty Verses on Consciousness Only&quot;) but it draws on numerous other sources and Indian commentaries to Vasubandhu&#x27;s verses to create a doctrinal summa of Indian consciousness only thought. This work was composed at the behest of Xuanzang&#x27;s disciple Kuiji, and became a central representation of East Asian Yogācāra. Xuanzang also promoted devotional meditative practices toward Maitreya Bodhisattva. 

Xuanzang&#x27;s disciple Kuiji wrote a number of important commentaries on the Yogācāra texts and further developed the influence of this doctrine in China, and was recognized by later adherents as the first true patriarch of the school. His &quot;Cheng weishi lun shuji&quot; (成唯識 論述記; Taishō no. 1830, vol. 43, 229a-606c) is a particularly important text for the Weishi school.

After Xuanzang, the second patriarch of the Weishi school was Hui Zhao. According to A.C. Muller &quot;Hui Zhao 惠沼 (650-714), the second patriarch, and Zhi Zhou 智周 (668-723), the third patriarch, wrote commentaries on the &quot;Fayuan yulin chang&quot;, the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;, and the &quot;Madhyāntavibhāga&quot;; they also wrote treatises on Buddhist logic and commentaries on the &quot;Cheng weishi lun&quot;.&quot; Another important figure is Yijing 義淨 (635–713), who traveled to India in imitation of Xuanzang. He translated several works of Vinaya, as well as Yogācāra commentaries by Dharmapāla on Dignāga’s &quot;Ālambana-parīkṣā&quot; and on Vasubandhu’s &quot;Viṃśikā&quot;.

=== Wŏnch’ŭk&#x27;s school and Korean Yogācāra ===
While the lineage of Kuiji and Hui Zhao was traditionally considered the &quot;orthodox&quot; tradition of Xuanzang&#x27;s school, there were also other lineages of this tradition which differed in their interpretations from Kuiji&#x27;s sect. Perhaps the most influential heterodox group was a group of Yogācāra (Korean: Beopsang) scholars from the Korean Silla kingdom, mainly: Wŏnch’ŭk, Tojŭng, and Taehyŏn (大賢). 

Wŏnch’ŭk (圓測, 613–696) was a Korean student of Xuanzang as well as a disciple of the Shelun master Fachang (567–645). He composed various texts, including &quot;Haesimmilgyǔng so&quot; (C. &quot;Jieshenmi jing shu&quot;), an influential commentary to the &quot;Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra&quot; which was even translated to Tibetan and is known as the &quot;Great Chinese Commentary&quot; to Tibetans. This work later influenced Tibetan scholars like Tsongkhapa. 

Wŏnch’ŭk&#x27;s interpretations often differ from that of the school of Xuanzang and instead promotes ideas closer to those of the Shelun school, such as the doctrine of the &quot;immaculate consciousness&quot; (&quot;amalavijñāna&quot;) and the idea that the &quot;ālayavijñāna&quot; was essentially pure. Due to this, Wŏnch’ŭk&#x27;s work was criticized by the disciples of Kuiji. Wŏnch’ŭk&#x27;s tradition came to be known as the Ximing tradition (since he resided at Ximingsi monastery), and it was contrasted with Kuiji&#x27;s tradition, also called the Ci&#x27;en tradition after Kuiji&#x27;s monastery at Da Ci&#x27;ensi. 

While in China, Wŏnch’ŭk took as a disciple a Korean-born monk named Tojŭng (), who travelled to Silla in 692 and propounded and propagated Woncheuk&#x27;s exegetical tradition there where it flourished. In Korea, these Beopsang teachings did not endure long as a distinct school, but its teachings were frequently included in later schools of thought and also studied by Japanese Yogācāra scholars.

Another influential figure in Korean Yogācāra is Wŏnhyo (元曉 617–686). While he usually seen as a Huayan scholar, he also wrote many works on Yogācāra and according to Charles Muller &quot;if we look at Wŏnhyo’s oeuvre as a whole, along with accounts of his life, his involvement in Yogācāra studies looms large, and in fact, in terms of sheer quantity, forms the largest portion of his work.&quot; His work was influential on later Chinese figures like Fazang.

=== Dharma characteristics vs Dharma nature debates ===

With the rise of other Sinitic Mahayana schools to prominence, like Huayan and Chan, the Yogacara tradition of Xuanzang came under some doctrinal criticism. Sinitic schools like Huayan were influenced by the buddha-nature and ekayana (one vehicle) teachings, especially the doctrines of the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot;. They were thus connected with the teachings of the Dilun and Shelun schools. As such, their doctrines differed in significant ways from that of the school of Xuanzang. 

The scholars of the Huayan school like Fazang (643–712), Chengguan (738–839), and Zongmi (780–841), critiqued the school of Xuanzang, which they termed &quot;Faxiang-zong&quot; (dharma-characteristics school, a term invented by Chengguan), on various points. A key contention was that Xuanzang&#x27;s school failed to understand the true Dharma-nature (Ch: fa-xin, dharmata or tathata, i.e. the buddha-nature, the one mind of the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot;), even if they did understand the nature of dharmas (fa-xiang). According to Dan Lusthaus, &quot;This distinction became so important, that every Buddhist school originating in East Asia, including all forms of Sinitic Mahayana, viz. T&#x27; ien-t&#x27; ai, Hua-yen, Ch&#x27;an, and Pure Land, came to be considered Dharma-nature schools.&quot; 

The Huayan school sees the Dharma nature as dynamic and responding to conditions (of sentient beings), it also sees the Dharma nature (the buddha-nature, original enlightenment) as the basis and source of samsara &quot;and&quot; nirvana. As such, Huayan scholars like Zongmi critiqued the view of the Xuanzang &quot;Faxiang&quot; school which held that the Dharma nature (suchness) was &quot;totally inert&quot; and &quot;unchanging&quot; in favor of the view found in the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot; which sees the one mind (the dharma nature) as having &quot;both&quot; an unconditioned and a conditioned aspect. This conditioned aspect of the dharma nature is an active and dynamic aspect out of which all pure and impure dharmas arise. As Imre Hamar explains:The issue at stake is the relationship between the Absolute and phenomena. Is the tathata, the Absolute, dependent arising, or is it immovable? Does the Absolute have anything to do with the phenomenal world? According to the interpretation of the final teaching of Mahayana (i.e. Faxingzong), the Absolute and phenomena can be described with the &#x27;water and wave&#x27; metaphor. Due to the wind of ignorance, waves of phenomena rise and fall, yet they are not different in essence from the water of the Absolute. In contrast with this explanation, the elementary teaching of Mahayana (i.e. Faxiangzong) can be presented by the metaphor of &#x27;house and ground&#x27; . The ground supports the house but is different from it. Another key distinction and point of debate was the nature of the alayavijñana. For Xuanzang&#x27;s school, the alayavijñana is a defiled consciousness, while the so called &quot;Dharma-nature&quot; position (following the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot;) is that the alaya has a pure untainted aspect (which is buddha-nature) as well as an impure aspect.

The schools which were more aligned with the &quot;Dharma-nature&quot; position (like Huayan, Tiantai and Chan) also affirmed the ultimate truth of the one vehicle, while the Xuanzang school affirms the difference among the three vehicles. They also reject Xuanzang&#x27;s view that states that there is a certain class of very deluded beings called icchantikas who can never become Buddhas. The Xuanzang school also maintained the Five Natures Doctrine () which was seen as provisional and as being superseded by the one vehicle teaching by schools like Huayan and Tiantai.

=== Later history ===

After the third patriarch, the influence of the school of Xuanzang declined, though it continued to be studied at certain key centers, such as Chang’an, Mt. Wutai, Zhendingfu (now) Shijiazhuang), and Hangzhou. The Weishi (consciousness-only) school survived into the Song and Yuan dynasties, but as a minor school with little influence. However its texts have remained important sources for the study of Yogācāra thought down to today. 

The Xuanzang school&#x27;s influence declined due to competition with other Chinese Buddhist traditions such as Tiantai, Huayan, Chan and Pure Land Buddhism. Nevertheless, classic Yogācāra philosophy continued to exert an influence, and Chinese Buddhists of other schools relied on its teachings to enrich their own intellectual traditions. 

An important later figure associated with Yogācāra studies was the syncretic Chan scholar monk Yongming Yanshou (904–975), who wrote some commentaries on Yogācāra texts. During the Ming dynasty, two scholars also wrote Weishi commentaries: Mingyu 明昱 (1527–1616) and Zhixu 智旭 (1599–1655).

Other Yogācāra teachings remained popular in Chinese Buddhism, such as devotion to the bodhisattva Maitreya (who was associated with the tradition and is seen as the founder of Yogācāra). Various later Chinese figures promoted Maitreya devotion as a Pure Land practice and as a way to receive teachings in visions. Hanshan Deqing (1546–1623) was one figure who describes a vision of Maitreya.
=== Modern revival ===


The 20th century saw a revival in Weishi studies in China. Important figures in this revival include Yang Wenhui (1837-1911), Taixu, Liang Shuming, Ouyang Jingwu (1870–1943), Wang Xiaoxu (1875-1948), and Lu Cheng. Weishi studies was also revived among Japanese philosophers like Inoue Enryō.

Modern Chinese thinkers of the Weishi studies revival also discussed Western philosophy (especially Hegelian and Kantian thought) and modern science in terms of Yogacara thought. 

In his 1929 book on the history of Chinese Buddhism, Jiang Weiqiao wrote:
Ouyang Jian founded the Chinese Institute of Inner Studies (), which provided education in Yogācāra teachings and the Prajñāparamita sūtras, given to both monastics and laypeople. Many modern Chinese Buddhist scholars are second-generation descendants of this school or have been influenced by it indirectly.

New Confucian thinkers also participated in the revival of Weishi studies. New Confucians like Xiong Shili, Ma Yifu, Tang Junyi and Mou Zongsan, were influenced by the philosophy of Indian Yogācāra philosophy, and by the thought of the &quot;Awakening of Faith,&quot; though their work also critiqued and modified Weishi philosophy in various ways&quot;.&quot;

The work of Xiong Shili was particularly influential in the establishment of what is now called New Confucianism. His &quot;A New Treatise on Vijñaptimātra&quot; (新唯識論, &quot;Xin Weishi Lun&quot;) draws on Yogacara and Confucian thought to construct a new philosophical system.

==History in Japan==


=== Early period ===
The Consciousness-Only teachings were transmitted to Japan as &quot;Hossō-shū&quot; (法相宗, Japanese for &quot;Faxiang School&quot;), and they made considerable impact. There were various key figures who established early Hossō in Japan. One of them was Dōshō 道昭 (629–749), a student of Xuanzang from 653 to 660. Dōshō and his students Gyōki and Dōga followed the &quot;orthodox&quot; texts and teachings of Xuanzang&#x27;s school and transmitted these to Japan at Gangōji Temple. Other important figures who also studied under Xuanzang were Chitsu and Chitatsu. Together with Dōshō they defended the orthodox interpretations of Kuiji.

Another line of transmission was that of Chihō, Chiran, and Chiyu (all three visited Korea and then China c. 703), as well as the later figures Gien / Giin (653-728) and Genbō (d. 746). This tradition is known as the &quot;Northern Temple transmission&quot; since the lineage came to be based at Kōfuku-ji. This tradition was known to follow the teachings of the school of the Korean monk Wŏnch’ŭk in contrast to the &quot;southern temple&quot; tradition of Gangōji. 

The northern and southern temple traditions debated each other for centuries over their varying interpretations (Kuiji&#x27;s &quot;orthodoxy&quot; vs the views of the Silla Korean masters and their commentaries). These debates can be found in various later Hossō doctrinal sources, including: &quot;Record of the Light of the Lamp of Hossō&quot; (&quot;Hossō tōmyō ki&quot; 法相燈明記; 815) by Zen’an, &quot;Summary of the School of the Weishi lun&quot; (&quot;Yuishikiron dōgakushō&quot; 唯識論同學鈔) by Ryōsan 良算 (1202–?) and &quot;Chapters Providing a Brief Study of the Mahāyāna Yogācāra&quot; (&quot;Daijō hossō kenjinshō&quot; 大乘法相硏神章序) by Gomyō (750–834).

Hossō was an influential school during the Heian period. Hossō scholars also frequently debated with other emerging schools of Japanese Buddhism at the time. Both the founder of Shingon, Kūkai, and the founder of Tendai, Saichō, exchanged letters of debate with Hossō scholar Tokuitsu. Saichō condemned the school for not accepting the one vehicle teaching of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, which was seen as a provisional teaching in Hossō. Kukai, who became an influential figure at Nara, was more conciliatory with Hossō, and maintained amicable relations with the tradition. After Kukai, Shingon scholar monks often studied and commented on Hossō sources, while Hossō monks adopted Shingon ritual practices. However, over time, the universalist doctrine of the Tendai school won out and the Hossō position (which held that only some beings can become Buddhas and some beings called icchantikas have no hope for awakening) became a marginal view.

=== Kamakura revival and modernity ===
The tumultuous Kamakura period (1185–1333), saw a revival (fukkō) and reform (kaikaku) of Hossō school teachings, which was led by figures like Jōkei (1155–1213) and Ryōhen. The reformed doctrines can be found in key sources like &quot;Jō yuishiki ron dōgaku shō&quot; (&quot;A Collaborative Study of the Treatise on Consciousness-only&quot;), Jōkei&#x27;s &quot;Hossōshū shoshin ryakuō&quot; and Ryōhen&#x27;s &quot;Kanjin kakumushō&quot; (&quot;Summation on Contemplating the Mind and Awakening from a Dream&quot;). A key element of Jōkei&#x27;s teachings is the idea that even though the five classes of beings and the one vehicle teaching are relatively true, they are not ultimately so (since all phenomena are ultimately empty, non-dual and &quot;neither the same nor different&quot;). He also affirms that even icchantikas can attain enlightenment, since they will never be abandoned by the Buddhas and their compassionate power (which is not bound by causal laws). 

In a similar fashion, Ryōhen writes:Thus it should be remembered that in our school the doctrine of one vehicle and the doctrine of five groups of sentient beings are regarded as being equally true, for the doctrine of one vehicle is formulated from the standpoint that recognizes the unchangeable quality of the underlying substance of dharrnas, whereas the doctrine of the five groups of sentient beings has its roots in the distinctiveness of conditioned phenomena.… Thus, since our standpoint is that the relationship between the absolute and conditioned phenomena is one of “neither identity nor difference,” both the concept of one vehicle as well as the concept of five groups of sentient beings are equally valid. During the Kamakura, several new Buddhist schools were founded, with the various Pure Land sects derived from Hōnen becoming especially popular. As a novice monk, Hōnen had studied with Hossō scholars, but he later debated them while promoting his Pure land path. Jōkei was among Hōnen&#x27;s toughest critics. 

Jōkei is also known for popularizing the devotional aspects of Hossō, and for working to make it accessible to a wider audience. Jōkei promoted devotion to various figures, like Shakyamuni, Kannon, Jizo, and Maitreya, as well as numerous practices, like various nenbustu seeking birth in a pure land, dharani, precepts, liturgy (koshiki), rituals, lectures, worship of relics, etc. His pluralist and eclectic teachings thus offer a contrast to the more exclusive Kamakura schools who focused on one Buddha (Amitabha) or one practice (nembutsu etc.). For Jōkei, difference and diversity matters and people are not all the same (on the relative level), and thus it is not true that one practice or one Buddha is suitable for everyone. However, like the Pure Land schools, Jōkei stressed the importance of relying on the &quot;other power&quot; (of a Buddha or bodhisattva) and of birth in a pure land (Jōkei stressed the pure land of Maitreya), as well as practices that were accessible to less elite practitioners.

Jōkei is also a leading figure in the efforts to revive monastic discipline at places like Tōshōdai-ji, Kōfuku-ji and counted other notable monks among his disciples, including Eison, who founded the Shingon Risshu sect.

Although a relatively small Hossō sect exists in Japan to this day, its influence diminished due to competition from newer Japanese Buddhist schools like Zen and Pure Land. During the Meiji period, as tourism became more common, the Hossō sect was the owner of several famous temples, notably Hōryū-ji and Kiyomizu-dera. However, as the Hossō sect had ceased Buddhist study centuries prior, the head priests were not content with giving part of their tourism income to the sect&#x27;s organization. Following the end of World War II, the owners of these popular temples broke away from the Hossō sect, in 1950 and 1965, respectively. The sect still maintains Kōfuku-ji and Yakushi-ji.

<text>KLM Cityhopper is the regional airline subsidiary of KLM, headquartered in Haarlemmermeer, North Holland, Netherlands. It is based at nearby Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. As a subsidiary of Air France–KLM, it is an affiliate of SkyTeam. The airline operates scheduled European feeder services on behalf of KLM.

== History ==
The airline was established on 1 April 1991; it started operations the same year. It was formed from the merger of NLM CityHopper and Netherlines. Following the 1991 merger, KLM Cityhopper had Europe&#x27;s largest fleet composition of Fokker-built aircraft: the Fokker 50, 70 and 100.

In 1998, KLM acquired AirUK, which they rebranded KLM uk.

In November 2002, KLM merged its regional subsidiaries under the KLM Cityhopper name. It had 910 employees as of March 2007.

In 2008, the airline announced its fleet renewal programme, starting with an order of up to 17 Embraer 190 aircraft to replace its ageing and inefficient Fokker 50 aircraft and older Fokker 100 jets. Five Fokker 70 jets would also transfer over from Air France subsidiary Regional. Deliveries of the Embraer began in 2009 and by March 2010 KLM Cityhopper had operated its last Fokker 50 flight. The carrier began to phase out its older Fokker 100 jets. Further Embraer jet orders came in 2012 and allowed KLM Cityhopper to remove the last five remaining Fokker 100 aircraft from its operation.

In October 2012, KLM reportedly presented a plan to its unions that foresaw splitting the airline into two separate units. According to a report by Dutch newspaper &quot;Het Financieele Dagblad&quot;, KLM was considering splitting off its European operations that would operate with a lower cost base than today and include its subsidiary KLM Cityhopper. This would effectively mean an intercontinental operation to include only the wide-body fleet of KLM and a European fleet operating the short to medium-haul routes as a separate entity, including the current KLM Boeing 737 fleet and the entire KLM Cityhopper fleet.

The plan proved unpopular with unions and the CEO at the time and was parked. KLM then began the process of streamlining its operation, reducing costs and negotiating increased productivity from staff.

In 2013, KLM Cityhopper installed brand new slim-line leather seats from British company Acro on its Fokker 70 fleet. At the same time, the seat pitch was adjusted on all Fokker &amp; Embraer aircraft to offer a 3 tier cabin product with a Business Class, Premium Economy zone &amp; Economy zone. Also announced in 2013 was a lease agreement with BOC to take another six Embraer 190 jets, delivery from the end of the year up to April 2014. In turn, the early retirement of 7 Fokker 70 aircraft was announced. On 30 April 2014 KLM Cityhopper took delivery of its 28th Embraer 190 making it the largest operator of the type in Europe. A brand new livery was also launched on the same day with the aircraft arriving into Amsterdam sporting a new drooped cheat line and revised titles. Fondly referred to as &quot;the smiling Dolphin design&quot;, the adapted livery was commissioned to better suit the nose profile of modern aircraft such as the Embraer. The new look was created in-house by KLM designers and would be painted on all KLM Cityhopper aircraft and KLM aircraft in time.

Since 2014, KLM started to add new &quot;niche&quot; short-haul destinations to its network, with the majority served by KLM Cityhopper. The new routes were Bilbao, Turin, Zagreb, Montpellier, Kraków and Belfast. KLM Cityhopper also increased capacity from Bristol and Leeds-Bradford – upgrading the destinations to an Embraer 190 operation instead of the Fokker 70. On 9 December 2015 KLM announced new KLM Cityhopper services to Southampton, Inverness, Dresden and Genoa. The new flights commenced in spring 2016.

In 2015, following a long tendering process with several manufacturers, KLM Cityhopper announced that the Embraer 175 would replace the Fokker 70 fleet overall. The last Fokker 70 was scheduled to leave on 29 October 2017. The deal with Embraer saw an acceleration of the Fokker 70 withdrawal, starting in December 2015, and the arrival of two more Embraer 190 aircraft, bringing that fleet to 30 in total. 7 Fokker 70s were sold to Air Niugini, with four going to Cypriot carrier Tus Airways and two to Peruvian start-up Wayraperú. On 20 March 2016, the first Embraer 175 was delivered, operating in tandem on Fokker 70 routes and the Embraer 190 network when required. Its dual-type rating and commonality would allow overnight introduction of the Embraer 175 as both flight deck &amp; cabin staff trained on the Embraer 190 will be able to operate on the Embraer 175 after a brief &quot;differences&quot; session.

On 13 January 2016, KLM Cityhopper confirmed 2 out of 17 options for additional aircraft from Embraer – bringing the order total for the Embraer 175 to 17. The first Embraer 175 was delivered on 20 March 2016. In March 2016, KLM Cityhopper became the largest European operator of the Embraer E-Jet family, with 30 Embraer 190s in service as of December 2015 and an order for 17 Embraer 175 jets. KLM Cityhopper now operates one of the youngest regional jet fleets in the world after the Fokker 70 was retired from operation.

On 23 February 2021, KLM Cityhopper received its first Embraer 195-E2.

==Corporate affairs==
===Ownership===

KLM Cityhopper is 100% owned by KLM, itself a part of the Air France–KLM Group.

===Head office===
KLM Cityhopper&#x27;s head office is in the Convair Building on the grounds of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in Schiphol-Oost, Haarlemmermeer. In 1999 Schiphol Real Estate (SRE) contracted out a parcel of land to begin construction of the Convair Building. The building also houses the offices of KLM Recruitment Services. Originally the KLM Cityhopper head office was in the airport&#x27;s Building 70.

===Corporate design===
The company identity is identical to that of its parent carrier with the addition of “Cityhopper” after the KLM crown logo and the absence of “The Flying Dutchman” and “Royal Dutch Airlines” on its aircraft livery. A revised font style was introduced in 2010. In May 2014, KLM Cityhopper also introduced a revised livery.

==Destinations==
Several of KLM&#x27;s intra-European routes are operated by both KLM and KLM Cityhopper. Seasonal changes are common with routes switching between the Boeing 737 fleet of KLM to KLM Cityhopper as required, usually in concert with the start/end of IATA timetable seasons. The airline had five fully crewed UK bases in operation, inherited from its purchase of Air UK and subsequent merger of the KLM UK brand. Several hundred British cockpit and cabin crews continued to operate KLM Cityhopper flights from the UK and the Netherlands throughout the carrier&#x27;s network. All UK bases for cabin crew members were closed in 2017 with the last pilot-only bases closed in May 2020.

== Fleet ==

=== Current fleet ===
As of February 2025, the KLM Cityhopper fleet consists of the following aircraft:

=== Government aircraft ===
KLM Cityhopper was also responsible for the operation of the state-owned Fokker 70 aircraft, registration PH-KBX. This Fokker was used by the Dutch Government and the royal family and often flown by H.M. King Willem-Alexander himself, but was sold to an Australian-based buyer in 2017. A Boeing 737-700 BBJ Boeing Business Jet, registered PH-GOV, replaced the Fokker 70 and is operated by KLM mainline.

=== Historical fleet ===

When KLM Cityhopper was formed in 1991, its fleet consisted of mostly Fokker types. These have later been phased out and replaced by more efficient Embraer E-Jets, with the last airframe being retired on 28 October 2017. Today the airline&#x27;s fleet consists entirely of Embraer 175s, 190s and 195-E2s.
== Services ==
=== In-flight services ===
KLM Cityhopper offers passengers complimentary drinks and refreshments on all scheduled flights. Duty-free/tax-free products are not available. Business Class passengers are offered continental breakfast boxes, sandwiches &amp; dinner salads together with bar service. Economy Class passengers are offered sandwiches or a drink and complimentary snack depending on the time of day and duration of the flight.

In line with its parent carrier, KLM Cityhopper offers a two-class cabin service on all of its scheduled routes. Rows 1 on all aircraft is reserved for Europe Business Class passengers, and the section can be increased to additional rows subject to demand. These classes are defined by the designation &quot;C&quot; - For Europe Business Class &amp; &quot;M&quot; For Europe Economy - in reservation systems.

From 2011, KLM committed to blocking middle seats on its short-haul fleet so that business class passengers would always have an empty seat next to them for extra comfort. This meant that Seats C and E on any business class row on the Fokker fleet were no longer used, and a maximum of three passengers are seated on each row - reducing the maximum capacity of the Fokker 70 on scheduled services to 78 passengers. Seat blocking is not done on the Embraer E190 or E175 fleet which only has four-abreast seating. From 22 April 2013, KLM began charging for hold baggage on all European flights (including all KLM Cityhopper services) unless passengers are on a Business Class ticket or an Elite tier member of the &#x27;Flying Blue&#x27; frequent flyer program. The baggage fee will also be waived if the KLM Cityhopper flight is just one leg of an intercontinental trip.

Economy Comfort seats can be purchased on all KLM Cityhopper flights, up to row 7 on the Embraer E190, offering economy passengers additional legroom and the convenience of forward-situated seats for quicker disembarkation. The availability of this section fluctuates depending on the number of Business class seats sold on the flight.

==Incidents and accidents==
* On 4 April 1994, a Saab 340 operating KLM Cityhopper Flight 433 crashed at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, killing three and seriously injuring nine people. A faulty warning light caused the crew to mistakenly believe that the engine suffered from low oil pressure. On final approach at a height of , the captain decided to go around and gave full throttle, however only on the number one engine, leaving the other in-flight idle. Because of this, the aircraft rolled to the right, pitched up, stalled and hit the ground at 80 degrees bank.
* On 29 May 2024, an airport worker died after being ingested into the engine of an Embraer 190 operating KLM Cityhopper Flight 1341. The incident occurred on the apron at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol during pushback as the aircraft was preparing to depart for Billund. Investigators from the Dutch Safety Board determined that the worker intentionally jumped into the running engine to commit suicide.

==Notable pilots==
In 2017 Willem-Alexander, King of the Netherlands revealed that he had been flying secretly as a copilot twice a month for KLM Cityhopper for the past 21 years, including the state plane.

<text>Dajian Huineng or Hui-neng (; February 27, 638 – August 28, 713), also commonly known as the Sixth Patriarch or Sixth Ancestor of Chan (traditional Chinese: 禪宗六祖), is a semi-legendary but central figure in the early history of Chinese Chan Buddhism. According to tradition he was an uneducated layman who suddenly attained awakening (Chinese: 見性, jianxing) upon hearing the Diamond Sutra. Despite his lack of formal training, he demonstrated his understanding to the fifth patriarch, Daman Hongren, who then supposedly chose Huineng as his true successor instead of his publicly known selection of Yuquan Shenxiu.

Twentieth century scholarship revealed that the story of Huineng&#x27;s Buddhist career was likely invented by the monk Heze Shenhui, who claimed to be one of Huineng&#x27;s disciples and was highly critical of Shenxiu&#x27;s teaching.

Huineng is regarded as the founder of the &quot;Sudden Enlightenment&quot; Southern Chan school of Buddhism, which focuses on an immediate and direct attainment of Buddhist enlightenment. The &quot;Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch&quot; (), which is said to be a record of his teachings, is a highly influential text in the East Asian Buddhist tradition.

==Biography==

===Sources===
The two primary sources for Huineng&#x27;s life are the preface to the &quot;Platform Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Transmission of the Lamp&quot;. Most modern scholars doubt the historicity of traditional biographies and works written about Huineng, considering his extended biography to be a legendary narrative based on a historical person of &quot;merely regional significance&quot;, of whom very little is known. This legendary narrative reflects historical and religious developments which took place in the century after his life and death.

===The Platform Sutra===
The &quot;Platform Sūtra of the Sixth Patriarch&quot; is attributed to a disciple of Huineng named Fahai, and purports to be a record of Huineng&#x27;s life, lectures and interactions with disciples. However, the text shows signs of having been constructed over a longer period of time, and contains different layers of writing. According to John McRae, it is
According to Wong, the Platform Sūtra cites and explains a wide range of Buddhist scriptures listed here in the order of appearance:
*&quot;Diamond Sutra&quot;
*&quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot;
*&quot;Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot;
*&quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot;
*&quot;Brahmajāla Sūtra&quot;
*&quot;Vimalakirti Sutra&quot;
*&quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;
*&quot;Śūraṅgama Sūtra&quot;
*&quot;Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana&quot;

===Early life and introduction to Buddhism===

According to Huineng&#x27;s autobiography in the Platform Sutra, Huineng&#x27;s father was from Fanyang, but he was banished from his government position and died at a young age. Huineng and his mother were left in poverty and moved to Nanhai, where Huineng sold firewood to support his family. One day, Huineng delivered firewood to a customer&#x27;s shop, where he saw a man reciting the Diamond Sutra: &quot;On my way out of the gate I saw someone reciting a sutra, and as soon as I heard the words of the sutra my mind opened forth in enlightenment.&quot; He inquired about the reason that the Diamond Sutra was chanted, and the person stated that he came from the Eastern Meditation Monastery in Huangmei District of the province of Qi, where the Fifth Patriarch of Chan lived and delivered his teachings. Huineng&#x27;s customer paid his ten silver taels and suggested that he meet the Fifth Patriarch of Chan.

===Meeting the Fifth Patriarch of Chan Buddhism===
Huineng reached Huangmei thirty days later, and expressed to the Fifth Patriarch his specific request of attaining Buddhahood. Since Huineng came from Guangdong and was physically distinctive from the local Northern Chinese, the Fifth Patriarch Hongren questioned his origin as a &quot;barbarian from the south&quot;, and doubted his ability to attain enlightenment. Huineng impressed Hongren with a clear understanding of the ubiquitous Buddha nature in everyone, and convinced Hongren to let him stay. The first chapter of the Ming canon version of the &quot;Platform Sutra&quot; describes the introduction of Huineng to Hongren as follows:
Huineng was told to split firewood and pound rice in the backyard of the monastery and avoid going to the main hall.

===Poem contest===
Eight months later, the Fifth Patriarch summoned all his followers and proposed a poem contest for his followers to demonstrate the stage of their understanding of the essence of mind. He decided to pass down his robe and teachings to the winner of the contest, who would become the Sixth Patriarch. Shenxiu, the leading disciple of the Fifth Patriarch, composed a stanza, but did not have the courage to present it to the master. Instead, he wrote his stanza on the south corridor wall one day at midnight to remain anonymous. The other monks saw the stanza and commended it. Shenxiu&#x27;s stanza is as follows:
The Patriarch was not satisfied with Shenxiu&#x27;s stanza, and pointed out that the poem did not show understanding of &quot;[his] own fundamental nature and essence of mind.&quot; He gave Shenxiu a chance to submit another poem to demonstrate that he had entered the &quot;gate of enlightenment,&quot; so that he could transmit his robe and the Dharma to Shenxiu, but the student&#x27;s mind was agitated and could not write one more stanza.

Two days later, the illiterate Huineng heard Shenxiu&#x27;s stanza being chanted by a young attendant at the monastery and inquired about the context of the poem. The attendant explained to him the poem contest and the transmission of the robe and Dharma. Huineng asked to be led to the corridor, where he could also pay homage to the stanza. He asked a low-ranking official named Zhang Riyong from Jiangzhou to read the verse to him, and then immediately asked him to write down a stanza that he composed.

According to McRae, &quot;the earliest version of the &quot;Platform Sutra&quot; contains two versions of Huineng&#x27;s verse.&quot; Later versions, such as the Zongbao edition (c. 1291) from the Yuan era, contain one version of Huineng&#x27;s stanza, somewhat different from the two verses found in the c. 8th century Dunhuang edition:

The followers who were present were astonished by the work of a southern barbarian. Being cautious of Huineng&#x27;s status, the Patriarch wiped away the stanza and claimed that the author of the stanza had not reached enlightenment.

=== Interpretation of the verses ===
According to the traditional interpretation, which is based on Guifeng Zongmi, the fifth-generation successor of Shenhui, the two verses represent respectively the gradual and the sudden approach. According to McRae, this is an incorrect understanding:
Huineng&#x27;s verse does not stand alone, but forms a pair with Shenxiu&#x27;s verse:
McRae notes a similarity in reasoning with the Oxhead School, which used a threefold structure of &quot;absolute, relative and middle&quot;, or &quot;thesis-antithesis-synthesis&quot;. According to McRae, the Platform Sutra itself is the synthesis in this threefold structure, giving a balance between the need of constant practice and the insight into the absolute.

=== Succession of Hongren ===
However, on the next day, the Patriarch secretly went to Huineng&#x27;s room and asked, &quot;Should not a seeker after the Dharma risk his life this way?&quot; Then he asked, &quot;is the rice ready?&quot; Huineng responded that the rice was ready and only waiting to be sieved. The Patriarch secretly explained the Diamond Sutra to Huineng, and when Huineng heard the phrase &quot;one should activate one’s mind so it has no attachment,&quot; he was &quot;suddenly and completely enlightened, and understood that all things exist in self-nature.&quot;

The Dharma was passed to Huineng at night, when the Patriarch transmitted &quot;the doctrine of sudden enlightenment&quot; as well as his robe and bowl to Huineng. He told Huineng, “You are now the Sixth Patriarch. Take care of yourself, save as many sentient beings as you can, and spread the teachings so they will not be lost in the future.

=== Escape from monastery ===

He also explained to Huineng that the Dharma was transmitted from mind to mind, whereas the robe was passed down physically from one patriarch to the next. Hongren instructed the Sixth Patriarch to leave the monastery before he could be harmed. &quot;You can stop at Huai and then hide yourself at Hui.&quot; Hongren showed Huineng the route to leave the monastery, and rowed Huineng across the river to assist his escape. Huineng immediately responded with a clear understanding of Hongren&#x27;s purpose in doing so, and demonstrated that he could ferry to &quot;the other shore&quot; with the Dharma that had been transmitted to him.

The Sixth Patriarch reached the Tayu Mountains within two months, and realized that hundreds of men were following him, attempting to rob him of the robe and bowl. However, the robe and bowl could not be moved by Huiming, who then asked for the transmission of Dharma from Huineng. Huineng helped him reach enlightenment and continued on his journey.

==Teachings==

The earliest and most important source for the teachings of Huineng is the &quot;Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch&quot; (Chinese: 六祖壇經; pinyin: &quot;Liùzǔ Tánjīng&quot;). There are various editions of this text, the earliest of which are copies from Dunhuang which date to the 9th century. The original may have been composed in around 780 CE. According to modern scholars like Yanagida Seizan and John McRae, the early &quot;Platform Sutra&quot; was composed within the Oxhead school, not within the so called &quot;Southern School&quot; as was previously believed. The text continued to be edited and expanded until the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), when Zongbao (宗寶) produced an edition that eventually became part of the standard Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) Chinese Buddhist canon.

===Non-thought, non-attribute, and non-abiding ===
According to Peter Gregory, the most important ideas in the &quot;Platform Sutra&quot;, for which it is best known, form a set of three key interrelated doctrines: no-thought (&quot;wunian&quot;), nonform, also translated as nonattribute (&quot;wuxiang&quot;), and nonabiding (&quot;wuzhu&quot;).

In the &quot;Platform Sutra&quot;, Huineng taught &quot;no-thought&quot;, the &quot;pure and unattached mind&quot; which &quot;comes and goes freely and functions fluently without any hindrance&quot;. It does not mean that one does not think at all, but is &quot;a highly attentive yet unentangled way of being [...] an open, non-conceptual state of mind that allows one to experience reality directly, as it truly is.&quot; Regarding non-thought, Huineng says:

Thoughtlessness is to see and to know all dharmas [things] with a mind free from attachment. When in use it pervades everywhere, and yet it sticks nowhere. What we have to do is to purify our mind so that the six vijñānas [aspects of consciousness], in passing through the six gates [sense organs], will neither be defiled by nor attached to the six sense-objects. When our mind works freely without any hindrance, and is at liberty to come or to go, we attain samādhi of prajñā, or liberation. Such a state is called the function of thoughtlessness. But to refrain from thinking of anything, so that all thoughts are suppressed, is to be dharma-ridden, and this is an erroneous view.
As Gregory points out, for Huineng, no-thought does not refer to a blanking out of the mind. Rather, Huineng says, &quot;Freedom from thought means having no thought in the midst of thoughts.&quot; He says that such things as &quot;sitting without moving, getting rid of falsehood, and not giving rise to thoughts&quot; just lead to insentiency. This is to obstruct the Way which should, on the contrary, be allowed to flow freely, without any obstruction. For Huineng, suchness and thought exist together in an essence-function relationship. He says, &quot;Suchness is the essence of thought, thought is the function of suchness.&quot;

Related to the teaching of non-thought, Huineng also taught &quot;non-attribute.&quot; Just as non-thought does not eradicate thoughts, non-attribute for Huineng likewise is not a world-denying negation of the attributes of sensory experience, the vast array of things and characteristics which make up the basic features of life in the world. Rather, for Huineng, non-attribute has a this-worldly orientation which affirms human experience and the world of characteristics. It does not mean literally to be without any attributes at all, but rather to be free of attributes while right in the midst of attributes. To differentiate and distinguish the various phenomena of the world, and yet to regard them all as the same, is to have equanimity (&quot;shě&quot; 捨). As Brook Ziporyn observes, for Huineng, our self-nature is free of attributes, not in the sense of excluding them, but in the sense of embracing them all without attaching to them. In this way, our self-nature can be compared to space, while particular attributes are like the things appearing in that space.

Huineng says:

Learned Audience, the illimitable void of the universe is capable of holding myriads of things of various shape and form, such as the sun, the moon, stars, mountains, rivers, men, dharmas pertaining to goodness or badness, deva planes, hells, great oceans, and all the mountains of the Mahāmeru. Space takes in all of these, and so does the voidness of our nature. We say that the essence of mind is great because it embraces all things, since all things are within our nature.

In addition to non-thought and non-attribute, Huineng also taught non-abiding. He says rather than attach to characteristics and obstruct the Way, one should not abide in things. Huineng discusses nonabiding in terms of not dwelling in any experience in the past, present, or future. He says:

&quot;Within each moment of experience, not to think of any previous state. For the past experience, the present experience and the subsequent experience to connect up in an unbroken continuity is called bondage. But in relating to all things, to go through each experience without dwelling in it, that is freedom from bondage. This is why nonabiding is the root.&quot;

Again, like non-thought and non-attribute, non-abiding for Huineng means all things and thoughts are allowed but not attached to, similar to space. However, as Ziporyn points out, Huineng&#x27;s teaching of non-abiding puts a spin on the motionlessness of the spacelike self-nature. That is, unlike the traditional Buddhist emphasis on stillness and quiescence, which register no attributes and give rise to no activity; for Huineng, non-abiding means that true motionlessness is a kind of hyperintense &quot;motion&quot; that never dwells or stays in the same place.

In this way, as Ziporyn observes, Huineng&#x27;s teaching resonates with indigenous Chinese notions which give a positive value to change and transformation. According to Ziporyn, for Huineng, enlightenment is associated with &quot;flow&quot;, constant change and transformation. Huineng says, &quot;Good friends, one’s enlightenment (one’s Way, &quot;dao&quot;) must flow freely. How could it be stagnated? When the mind does not reside in the dharmas, one’s enlightenment flows freely. For the mind to reside in the dharmas is called ‘fettering oneself.’ If you say that always sitting without moving is it, then you’re just like Śāriputra meditating in the forest, for which he was scolded by Vimalakīrti!&quot; Similarly, the alleged Northern school&#x27;s emphasis on quiet contemplation was criticized by Huineng thus:

===Meditation and wisdom===
Huineng taught that meditation and wisdom were not sequential, with one being prior to and giving rise to the other, since in that case &quot;the Dharma would have two characteristics.&quot; Instead, Huineng says they are not different and form an essence-function relationship. For Huineng, wisdom is the function of meditation, while meditation is the essence of wisdom. In this way, when wisdom is present, so too is meditation; and when meditation is present, so too is wisdom. Huineng uses an analogy of a lamp and its light to illustrate this point. Where light is the function of a lamp, the lamp is the essence of the light.

As Gregory points out, Huineng&#x27;s oneness of meditation and wisdom is a sudden practice, as it does not treat meditation, or concentration, as a means of achieving wisdom. For that would be to understand meditation and wisdom dualistically. Moreover, using meditation as a means takes enlightenment as something to be realized in the future. Such an understanding is gradualistic and fails to recognize the enlightenment that is already present.

===Dhyāna===
Huineng defines &quot;zuochan,&quot; seated meditation, in a non-literal way as follows. He says &quot;sitting&quot; (&quot;zuo&quot;) means for the mind not to be activated in regards to various good and bad realms externally, while &quot;meditation&quot; (&quot;chan&quot;) means to see the motionlessness of the self-nature internally. He criticizes mere motionlessness of the body, as well as the practices of concentrating on mind and on purity. He says:

If one is to concentrate on the mind, then the mind [involved] is fundamentally false. You should understand that the mind is like a phantasm, so nothing can concentrate on it. If one is to concentrate on purity, then [realize that because] our natures are fundamentally pure, it is through false thoughts that suchness is covered up. Just be without false thoughts and the nature is pure of itself. If you activate your mind to become attached to purity, you will only generate the falseness of purity. The false is without location; it is the concentration that is false. Purity is without shape and characteristics; you only create the characteristics of purity and say this is ‘effort’ [in meditation]. To have such a view is to obscure one’s own fundamental nature, and only to be fettered by purity.

As Gregory observes, concentrating on, or viewing, the mind and purity are both dualistic as this is to make mind and purity into objects. Such objectification is false. Moreover, our nature is intrinsically pure, but activating the mind to view purity only externalizes that nature. This is to be deluded and to cover our fundamental purity so that it will not be seen.

==Historical impact and Influences==
Doctrinally, the Southern School is associated with the teaching that enlightenment is sudden, while the Northern School is associated with the teaching that enlightenment is gradual. This is a polemical exaggeration, since both schools were derived from the same tradition, and the so-called Southern School incorporated many teachings of the more influential Northern School. Eventually both schools died out, but the influence of Shenhui was so immense that all later Chan schools traced their origin to Huineng, and &quot;sudden enlightenment&quot; became a standard doctrine of Chan.

According to modern historiography, Huineng was a marginal and obscure historical figure. Modern scholarship has questioned his hagiography, with some researchers speculating that this story was created around the middle of the 8th century, beginning in 731 by Shenhui, who supposedly was a successor to Huineng, to win influence at the Imperial Court. He claimed Huineng to be the successor to Hongren, instead of the then publicly recognized successor Shenxiu:

In 745, Shenhui was invited to take up residence in the Heze temple in Luoyang. In 753, he fell out of grace, and had to leave the capital to go into exile. The most prominent of the successors of his lineage was Guifeng Zongmi. According to Zongmi, Shenhui&#x27;s approach was officially sanctioned in 796, when &quot;an imperial commission determined that the Southern line of Ch&#x27;an represented the orthodox transmission and established Shen-hui as the seventh patriarch, placing an inscription to that effect in the Shen-lung temple&quot;.

According to Schlütter and Teiser, the biography of Huineng explained in the Platform Sutra is a compelling legend of an illiterate, &quot;barbarian&quot; layman who became a Patriarch of Chan Buddhism. Most of what we know about Huineng comes from the Platform Sutra, which consists of the record of a public talk that includes an autobiography of Huineng, which was a hagiography, i.e. a biography of a saint portraying him as a hero.This pseudoautobiography was written to give authority to the teachings of Huineng. The Sutra became a very popular text, and was circulated widely in an attempt to increase the importance of the Huineng lineage. As a result, the account might have been altered over the centuries. Shenhui (685-758) was the first person to claim that Huineng was both a saint and a hero. As a result of this contested claim, modifications were made to the Platform Sutra, a manuscript copy of which was later found at Dunhuang.
It turns out that little was known about Huineng before Shenhui&#x27;s account of him. &quot;It took all the rhetorical skills of Shen-hui and his sympathizers to give a form to the name Huineng,&quot;; thus, the character Huineng described by Shenhui was not completely factual. In the Platform Sutra, following Huineng&#x27;s sermon was a narrative by Fahai, who addressed a few interviews between Huineng and his disciples, including Shenhui. It is likely that &quot;much of the Platform Sutra was built on the inventions of Shenhui,&quot; and the textual evidence suggests that &quot;the work was written soon after his death.&quot; After Huineng&#x27;s death, Shenhui wanted to claim his authority over Chan Buddhism, but his position was challenged by Shenxiu and Puji, who supported the Northern lineage that taught gradual enlightenment. It is reasonable to assume that this autobiography was likely an attempt by Shenhui to relate himself to the most renowned figures in Zen Buddhism, which essentially enabled him to connect to the Buddha through this lineage.

An epitaph of Huineng inscribed by the established poet Wang Wei also reveals inconsistencies with Shenhui&#x27;s account of Huineng. The epitaph &quot;does not attack Northern Chan, and adds new information on a monk, Yinzong (627-713), who is said to have tonsured Huineng.&quot; Wang Wei was a poet and a government official, whereas Shenhui was a propagandist who preached to the crowd, which again leads to questions about his credibility.

&quot;As far as can be determined from surviving evidence, Shenhui possessed little or no reliable information on Huineng except that he was a disciple of Hongren, lived in Shaozhou, and was regarded by some Chan followers as a teacher of only regional importance.&quot; It seems that Shenhui invented the figure of Huineng for himself to become the &quot;true heir of the single line of transmission from the Buddha in the Southern lineage,&quot; and this appears to be the only way he could have done so.

On a related note, the Chan Buddhist practices, including the wordless transmission and sudden enlightenment, were much different from the traditional training of a monk. According to Kieschnick, &quot;The Chan accounts ridicule every element of the scholar-monk ideal that had taken shape over the centuries in traditional hagiography,&quot; with examples found in the immense literature of the &quot;classical period.&quot;

==Mummification==

A mummified body, supposedly that of Huineng, is kept in Nanhua Temple in Shaoguan (northern Guangdong). This mummy was seen by the Jesuit Matteo Ricci who visited Nanhua Temple in 1589. Ricci told the European readers the story of Huineng (in a somewhat edited form), describing him as akin to a Christian ascetic. Ricci names him &quot;Liùzǔ&quot; (i.e. 六祖, &quot;The Sixth Ancestor&quot;).

During the Cultural Revolution, the mummy was damaged by the Red Guards.

==Liang Kai&#x27;s portrayal of Huineng==
The two paintings to the right were both completed by Liang Kai, a painter from Southern Song dynasty, who left his position as the court painter in Jia Tai&#x27;s court to practice Chan. These paintings depict Huineng, the Sixth Patriarch of Chan Buddhism. The protagonist occupies the lower central portion of both paintings, with his face turned to the side, so that his facial features are not portrayed.

&quot;The Sixth Patriarch Cutting the Bamboo&quot; depicts the process that Huineng went through to attain enlightenment, and exemplifies Huineng&#x27;s concentration and contemplation in doing so through the process of chopping bamboo. This particular enlightenment moment of his is only documented in this painting, and not in any literary sources. He holds an ax in his right hand, and extends his left arm to steady a stalk of bamboo while scrutinizing it. The brushstrokes are loose and free but construct a simplistic and lively image: they indicate a subtle motion of pulling the bamboo towards him. Huineng wears a shirt with sleeves rolled up, which is suggested by the crease at the edges of the shoulders. He puts his extra cloth into a hair bun. The light and dark ink indicate gradation and contrast, and the light shadow on his right arm and body of bamboo implies the source of light.

Similarly, The Sixth Patriarch Tearing a Sutra adopts a similar style in portraying the same figure, Huineng, performing a different mundane action. This reaffirms the focus of the Southern Chan Tradition, which is to attain sudden enlightenment without having to train to be a monk in the conventional way or to study Buddhist scriptures.

<text>Hurricane Alberto was the farthest-travelling tropical cyclone on record in the Atlantic Ocean. The third tropical cyclone, first named storm, and first hurricane of the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season, Alberto developed near the western coast of Africa from a tropical wave on August 3. Initially a tropical depression, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Alberto early on August 4. While briefly turning westward on August 6, Alberto attained hurricane status. The cyclone continued to track west-northwestward, and by early the following day, reached an initial peak with winds of . Shortly thereafter, Alberto re-curved northwestward and began encountering increased wind shear. As a result, Alberto weakened back to a tropical storm on August 9. However, the system quickly re-strengthened as winds became more favorable, and early on August 10, Alberto became a hurricane again. The storm gradually curved northward and north-northeastward between August 11 and August 12; Alberto attained its peak intensity with winds of during that time.

Increasing upper-level westerlies caused Alberto to weaken as it moved east-northeastward, with the cyclone losing most of its convection. Early on August 14, Alberto was downgraded to a tropical storm. A westerly trough that had been guiding Alberto outran the storm, and strong ridging developed to the north and west. As a result, Alberto turned southward on August 15, southwestward on August 16, and then to the west on August 17. While curving northwestward and then northward, Alberto began to re-strengthen, and was upgraded to a hurricane for a third time on August 18. Alberto reached a third peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of on August 20. After weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane, Alberto conducted an unusually large cyclonic loop, spanning approximately 5 degrees latitude and 8 degrees longitude. The cyclone was downgraded to a tropical storm on August 23, shortly before completing its extratropical transition. Although it did not affect land while tropical, the precursor tropical wave caused light rainfall in Senegal. The remnant extratropical cyclone also likely produced tropical storm-force winds in Iceland and Jan Mayen.

==Meteorological history==

A mesoscale convective complex, or large circular area of thunderstorms, developed in the Ethiopian Highlands of Africa on July 28. The complex moved west-southwestward through the continent, waxing and waning until persisting along a tropical wave on August 2. The next day, the wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from Guinea. Once over the open Atlantic Ocean, the wave quickly developed and became Tropical Depression Three later that day. The depression moved to the west-northwest and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Alberto early on August 4. Alberto continued to strengthen, but moved to cooler waters late on August 5 and weakened briefly. However, the storm strengthened again early on August 6, and it was upgraded to hurricane status as an eye became visible. The upgrade was accompanied with a brief westward turn. However, Alberto continued to move to the west-northwest later that day, reaching its first peak intensity of on August 7.

A vigorous upper-level low developed west of Alberto on August 7 and August 8. This caused an increase in vertical shear, weakening the hurricane down to a tropical storm on August 9. The low also caused the storm to turn to the northwest. However, on August 10, Alberto became better organised and was upgraded to hurricane status again. It then moved in a gradual curve towards the north and northeast through a break in a subtropical ridge between August 11 and August 12. Alberto made its closest approach to Bermuda on August 11, passing about east of the island. The strong storm became a Category 3 major hurricane on August 12 and reached its second and highest peak intensity of , and a wide eye was observed. Alberto was an unusual storm in that it reached its peak intensity at a high latitude, north of 35˚N, after it had re-curved. The hurricane began to weaken due to increasing upper-level westerlies on August 13 and August 14, while moving east-northeastward. Alberto was downgraded to a tropical storm on August 14.
As early as August 10, computer models anticipated the hurricane to accelerate to the northeast and become extratropical within three days, but this did not occur. A westerly trough that had been influencing Alberto&#x27;s motion outran the storm, and a strong ridge developed to the north and west, causing the storm to turn abruptly to the south on August 15, and to complete a large loop over the open Atlantic. Alberto turned to the southwest on August 16 and to the west on August 17. The storm then took a sharp turn toward the northwest as a large, slow-moving mid-level trough was carving out over the eastern United States. Alberto began to strengthen, and reached hurricane status for the third time on August 18. The hurricane continued to turn to the north on August 19 and to the northeast on August 20 and August 21. During this time, Alberto reached a third peak intensity of on August 20, and a wide eye was observed. Operationally, Alberto reached a peak intensity of , but after reanalysis, it was reduced to .

Hurricane Alberto began to weaken on August 22 as it accelerated into higher latitudes. It was downgraded to a tropical storm early on August 23. Initially, it was forecast to become extratropical on August 22, but a little burst of colder cloud tops enabled Alberto to remain tropical for a longer time, persisting into August 23, while it moved into a very high latitude of 53˚N. The weakening storm finally became extratropical late on August 23, while accelerating to the north-northeast, passing near Iceland on August 24. Gale-force winds became non-existent, as the centre turned to the east-northeast on August 25. Alberto dissipated about east of Jan Mayen later that day.

==Impact, records, and naming==
Very minimal impact occurred as a result from Hurricane Alberto. Dakar, Senegal, received of rain as the pre-Alberto tropical wave passed over the city. A discussion was issued on August 9 advising residents in Bermuda to monitor the progress of the storm until it safely passed. Also, from August 12 to August 14, public advisories were issued advising people from Azores to monitor the progress of Hurricane Alberto. This stopped when Alberto began to slow its motion and began to turn to the south, away from the Azores. Some swells were reported along the east coast of the United States a few days after the storm&#x27;s recurvature. No reports were available on the impact of Alberto on Iceland, but it was estimated that winds of at least tropical storm force were experienced there. Otherwise, there were no known reports of damage or casualties as a result of Hurricane Alberto.

Hurricane Alberto completed the largest loop ever observed over the Atlantic Ocean, spanning approximately 5 degrees latitude by 8 degrees longitude. The storm is currently the ninth longest-lived storm in the Atlantic Ocean (lasting 19.75 days), and is also the second longest-lived Atlantic storm during August (the longest lived is the 1899 Hurricane San Ciriaco). Also, Alberto is the farthest-travelling in the Atlantic (travelling 6,500 miles), being able to retain tropical characteristics at an unusually high latitude, up to 53˚N. The last storm to do so was Hurricane Frances in 1980.

<text>In computer networks and telecommunications, a dedicated line is a communications cable or other facility dedicated to a specific application, in contrast with a shared resource such as the telephone network or the Internet. It is a communication path between two points.

In practice, such services may not be provided by a single, discrete, end-to-end cable, but they do provide guarantees of constant bandwidth availability and near-constant latency, properties that cannot be guaranteed for more public systems. Such properties add a considerable premium to the price charged. 

As more general-purpose systems have improved, dedicated lines have been steadily replaced by intranets and the public Internet, but they are still useful for time-critical, high-bandwidth applications such as video transmission.

Some institutions such as NPR and other news agencies have large numbers of private lines with people that they frequently interview, (often government agencies) though these are being phased out in favor of VoIP systems.

<text>Motorsport(s) or motor sport(s) are sporting events, competitions and related activities that primarily involve the use of automobiles, motorcycles, motorboats and powered aircraft. For each of these vehicle types, the more specific terms &quot;automobile sport&quot;, &quot;motorcycle sport&quot;, &quot;power boating&quot; and &quot;air sports&quot; may be used commonly, or officially by organisers and governing bodies.

Different manifestations of motorsport with their own objectives and specific rules are called disciplines. Examples include circuit racing, rallying and trials. Governing bodies, also called sanctioning bodies, often have general rules for each discipline, but allow supplementary rules to define the character of a particular competition, series or championship. Groups of these are often categorised informally, such as by vehicle type, surface type or propulsion method. Examples of categories within a discipline are formula racing, stock car racing, touring car racing, sports car racing, etc.

== History ==
The first prearranged match race of two self-powered road vehicles over a prescribed route occurred in the north west of England at 4:30 A.M. on August 30, 1867, between Ashton-under-Lyne and Old Trafford, Manchester, a distance of eight miles. It was won by the locomotive of Isaac Watt Boulton, one of six he said he had run over the years, perhaps driven by his 22-year-old son, James W. The race was against Daniel Adamson&#x27;s carriage, likely the one made for Mr. Schmidt and perhaps driven by Mr. Schmidt himself. The reports do not indicate who was driving, since both were violating the red-flag law then fully in force. Boulton&#x27;s carriage was developed from a scrapped John Bridge Adams light-rail vehicle. These were solid fired steam carriages. This event and the details of the vehicles are recorded in the contemporary press, &quot;The Engineer&quot;, and in Fletcher&#x27;s books.

The Wisconsin legislature passed an act in 1875 offering a substantial purse for the first US motor race, which was run on July 16, 1878, over a 200-mile course from Green Bay to Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupon, Watertown, Fort Atkinson and Janesville, then turning north and ending in Madison. Only two actually competed: the Oshkosh and the Green Bay (the machines were referred to by their town of origin). This is examined and illustrated in detail in &quot;The Great Race of 1878&quot; by Richard Backus, Farm Collector, May/June 2004.

In 1894, the French newspaper &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot; organised a contest for horseless carriages featuring a run from Paris to Rouen. This is widely accepted as the world&#x27;s first motorsport event, and was the first to involve what would become known as automobiles. On 28 November 1895, the &quot;Chicago Times-Herald&quot; race, running from Chicago to Evanston and back, a distance of sixty miles, was held. This is believed to be the first motorsport event in the United States of America. In 1900, the Gordon Bennett Cup was established.

Motorsport was a demonstration event at the 1900 Summer Olympics.

Following World War I, European countries organised Grand Prix races over closed courses. In the United States, dirt track racing became popular.

After World War II, the Grand Prix circuit became more formally organised. In the United States, stock car racing and drag racing became firmly established.

==Automobile sport==
===Governing bodies===
The Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), formed in 1904, is the oldest and most prominent international governing body. It claims to be the sole international motor sporting authority for automobiles and other land vehicles with four or more wheels, whilst acknowledging the authority of the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) over vehicles with one to three wheels, which FIM calls motorcycle sport.

FIM and FIA are both recognised as international sports federations by the International Olympic Committee.

====FIA hierarchy====

Within the FIA&#x27;s structure, each affiliated National Sporting Authority () is recognised as the sole authority in their nation. Permission of the ASNs must be obtained to organise events using their rules, and their licenses must be held by participants. Not all ASNs function in the same manner, some are private companies such as Motorsport UK, some are supported by the state such as France&#x27;s FFSA, or in the case of the US&#x27;s ACCUS, a council of sanctioning bodies is the national representative at FIA meetings.

ASNs, their affiliated clubs or independent commercial promotors organise motorsport &quot;events&quot; which often include &quot;competitions&quot;. A collective of events is called a &quot;series,&quot; and a grouping of competitions often forms the basis of a &quot;championship&quot;, &quot;cup&quot; or &quot;trophy&quot;. 

====Unaffiliated automobile sport bodies====
Not all nations have a sporting authority affiliated with the FIA, some disciplines may not fall within the FIA&#x27;s remit of control, or organisations may choose to ignore the claim of the authority of others. Examples include banger racing and stock car racing in the United Kingdom which are claimed by both the Oval Racing Council and the National Stock car Association, despite the claim by the FIA affiliated ASN, Motorsport UK, to be the &quot;&quot;governing body of all four-wheel motorsport in the UK&quot;.&quot; SCORE International, National Auto Sport Association and National Off-Road Racing Association of the United States are also not members of the FIA affiliation system but may work with members for international matters.

=== Racing ===
Although English dictionaries do not unanimously agree and singularly define that a race is between competitors running head-to-head, in its International Sporting Code, the FIA defines racing as two or more cars competing on the same course simultaneously.

==== Circuit racing ====
Circuit racing takes place on sealed-surface courses at permanent autodromes or on temporary street circuits. Competitors race over a set number of laps of the circuit with the winner being the first to finish, or for a set length of time with the winner having completed the highest number of laps, with others classified subsequently.

Circuit racing replaced point-to-point (city-to-city) racing early in the history of motorsport, for both spectator appeal and as safety concerns brought in regulation of the sport, forcing organisers to use closed, marshalled and policed circuits on closed public roads. Aspendale Racecourse in Australia in 1906 was the first purpose-built motor racing track in the world. After which, permanent autodromes popularly replaced circuits on public roads.

In North America, the term road racing is used to describe racing and courses that have origins in racing on public highways; distinguished from oval racing, which has origins at purpose-built speedways using concrete or wooden boards.
*Single-seater racing involves cars with minimal chassis and bodywork material, with capacity only for the driver and necessary mechanical components. As the wheels protrude from the body of the car these thorough race cars are also known as open-wheel cars.
** Formula racing is an informal collection of series that use a specific set of rules for race car design. The most prevalent international series are Formula One and Formula Two. Others include Formula 3, Formula Ford, Formula Renault and Formula Palmer Audi. Former &#x27;Formula&#x27; series include Formula 5000, GP2 and GP3.
** Formula One is an international championship governed by the FIA and currently promoted by the privately owned company, Formula One Group. The regulations contain a strict set of rules which govern vehicle power, weight, size and design. The rules do allow for some variation however.
** Formula E is a championship of open-wheel racing that uses only electric-powered cars. The series was conceived in 2012 and the inaugural championship started in Beijing on 13 September 2014. The series is also sanctioned by the FIA and races a spec chassis/battery combination, with manufacturers allowed to develop their own electric power-trains. The series has gained significant traction in recent years.
**IndyCar Series originated on June 12, 1909, in Portland, Oregon. Shortly after, Indianapolis Motor Speedway opened in 1909 and held races that ranged from . Its premier race is the Indianapolis 500 which began on May 11, 1911. Today, IndyCar operates with over 20 teams and 40 different drivers.

*Sports car racing involves two categories. One includes production-based grand touring (GT) and sports cars. Although these are separate vehicle categories when built for road use; and historically they were raced as manufactured, these vehicle types have little difference when prepared for modern racing. The second category includes racing prototypes, thorough closed-bodied race cars with wheels enclosed by the bodywork and with the historical connection to a sports car&#x27;s requirement to have two seats and a minimum width. The flagship race is the 24 Hours of Le Mans which takes place annually in France during the month of June. It is a constituent race of the FIA World Endurance Championship.
*Stock car racing originally used production &#x27;stock&#x27; cars, the vehicles are now purpose-built prototype sports cars or single-seater cars. In the most prominent series organised by NASCAR in the US, Canada and Brazil amongst others, the cars maintain a silhouette body of a production road car. Stock car racing series&#x27; in the UK and New Zealand also use open-wheel, single-seater race cars with little to no bodywork.
*Touring car racing involves modified production cars intended for road use. In FIA regulations, touring cars must be recognised with having a minimum production quota and have a minimum of four seats, although the cars are still heavily modified and prepared for racing. Some national bodies accept cars with two seats as touring cars.
*Truck racing involves racing of modified large goods vehicle tractor units.

==== Off-road racing ====

Off-road racing can take place on open terrain with no set path, or on circuits that do not have a sealed surface such as asphalt or concrete.

Notable off-road races on open terrain include the Baja 1000 desert race, organised by SCORE International. The FIA authorise Extreme E, an electric off-road series whose organisers have announced a hydrogen fuel series, Extreme H, to begin in 2025. 

Examples of off-road racing disciplines and series include:

* Rallycross, short sprint races of touring cars on compact circuits of both asphalt and dirt surfaces. The discipline was born in Great Britain in 1967, when some entrants of the cancelled RAC Rally used their rally cars in a televised race instead.
* Lawn mower racing, involves the racing of ride-on lawnmowers on dirt surfaced circuits or point-to-point cross-country courses. The British Lawn Mower Racing Association organises an annual World Championship which consists of one event.
* Autograss, a British off-road racing series sanctioned by the National Autograss Sport Association. Ten classes of various vehicle categories are accepted, and races for each class are usually four to ten laps long and have up to eight vehicles competing.
==== Drag racing ====

Drag racing is an acceleration contest from a standing start along a short and straight course. Vehicles of various types can compete, usually between two vehicles. Winners can be the first to finish of competing pairs or by setting the fastest time, and competitions may have heats and/or series of runs.

==== Karting ====

Kart racing is a form of circuit racing using very small and low vehicles not considered as automobiles known as go-karts. It is one of the sports regulated by FIA (under the name of CIK), permitting licensed competition racing for anyone from the age of 8 onward. It is generally accepted as the most economical form of motorsport available on four wheels. As a free-time activity, it can be performed by almost anybody, and as karting circuits can be indoors and not take as much space as other forms of motorsport, it can be accessible to retail consumers without much qualification or training.

=== Hill climbs, time-trials and sprints ===
Non-racing speed competitions have various names but all carry the general rule of participants completing a course individually with the intention of setting the shortest time or highest average speed. This form of motorsport can be recreational or when competitive, rules may vary slightly such as whether to include the total time of several runs, the best time set, or the average pace of multiple courses to classify competitors.

Qualifying sessions for circuit races and special stages in rallying take the general form of time trials and sprints.

==== Hillclimbing ====
Hillclimbing is the most widely known form of time-trial due to its status as the only time trial or sprint form to have international FIA championships and endorsement. Its origins begin near the start of motorsport, particularly with the trials held that tested the capabilities of early automobiles to tackle uphill gradients. Contestants complete an uphill course individually and against the clock, the winner having the shortest, lowest average or total time. Hillclimbing events often include classes of competition for various categories and ages of vehicle and so may be incorporated into car shows or festivals of motoring such as the Goodwood Festival of Speed. Hill climb courses can be short at less than 1 mile, or several miles long such as the 12.42 mile Pikes Peak course in Colorado, USA.

==== Sprints, time trials and time attack ====
Sprints are governed by national FIA member ASNs in United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia, amongst other places. They are held on courses that do not climb a hill, at private and closed roadways where higher speeds and distances can be reached than at an autotesting course for example. 

Time attack are terms used by series that run sprints at racing circuits where competitors try to set the quickest lap time rather than racing head-to-head with others.

Time trials are run by the Sports Car Club of America, amongst others.

==== Rallysprint ====
Rallysprints are mainly sanctioned and held in continental Europe. Ultimately, they are similar to other time trial sprints but originate from the cars and courses used in special stage rallying with the elements of navigation and itinerary removed, and not necessarily requiring a co-driver to call pacenotes.

=== Rallying ===
Rallying involves driving to a set itinerary, following a prescribed route and arriving and departing at control points at set times with penalties applied for diverging from the route or arriving late and early.

Rallies nearly always involve routes on open roads, closed special stages are used on some rallies where competitors drive against the clock. The classification of these rallies are determined by summing the times set with the fastest crews being victorious, as found in the World Rally Championship. This method is often called rally racing or stage rallying informally, whilst rallies that do not include special stages are distinctly regularity rallies. 

Rallies that include routes that cover terrain off-road are also known as rally raid or cross-country rallies, the most famous example being the Dakar Rally. In the United States, the National Off-Road Racing Association (NORRA) was founded in 1967 along with the Baja 1000. Since the 1990s, this race has been organised by SCORE International whilst NORRA&#x27;s events have closer followed the FIA regulations and standards for cross country rallies, although the association has no affiliation to ACCUS, the US&#x27;s FIA member.

=== Drifting ===

Drifting is a form of motorsport where drivers intentionally lose rolling traction in corners through oversteering but maintain momentum with effective throttle control, clutch use and corrective steering. In competition a panel of judges award marks on artistry and car control through the corner or series of corners. Competitions often feature pairs of cars driving together where a lead car and a chase car go head-to-head, with only one car going through to the next heat or winning the competition.
=== Autocross ===
&quot;Autocross&quot; has multiple general meanings based on country of use.

*Prescribed by the FIA and in continental European nations is a form of off-road racing on short circuits entirely on unsealed surfaces. The cars are typically enclosed single-seaters called buggies; touring cars or tubular-chassis cross-cars.
*In United Kingdom and Ireland is an off-road time trial over a short temporary course. Multiple competitors may be on the course at one time but are not racing head-to-head.
*In United States and Canada is similar to Autotesting in the United Kingdom and Australia. It is a form of low-speed time-trial on short circuits or courses that are often temporary and reconfigurable allowing for multiple passes of new routes at one compact venue.

=== Autotesting / Gymkhana ===

Also known as Autocross in US and Canada and Autoslalom in Continental Europe, these similar disciplines are held in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. They involve precise car control, usually but not always against the clock on very short and compact temporary courses. Rather than being a high-speed test, car handling manoeuvres can be tested such as precision drifting, donuts, handbrake turns, reversing and so on.

=== Other ===
Other disciplines of automobile sport include:
* Autoball
* demolition derby
* monster truck events
* rock crawling
* tractor pulling
* land speed record attempts
* trials
* street racing

==Motorcycle sport==

The international motorcycle sport governing body recognised by the International Olympic Committee is the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM).

Disciplines include:
* Motorcycle racing
* Freestyle motocross
* Enduro
* Motorcycle trials
* Motorcycle rally
* Gymkhana
* Speedway

==Powerboating==

The international powerboating governing body recognised by the International Olympic Committee is the Union Internationale Motonautique (UIM). The organisation&#x27;s origins date back to 1922.

* Motorboat racing

==Air sports==

The international air sports governing body recognised by the International Olympic Committee is the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI). The FAI also governs non-powered air sport such as gliding and ballooning, however its motorised sports include:
* Air racing
* Drone racing

== Other forms of motorsport ==
* Hovercraft racing
* Radio-controlled model racing
* Slot car racing
* Snowmobile racing

<text>Lawrence Wayne&quot;Wild Man&quot;Fischer (November 6, 1944 – June 16, 2011) was an American street performer known for offering erratic, a cappella performances of &quot;new kinds of songs&quot; for a dime on the beaches of Los Angeles county and the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood. Most of his life was spent homeless or institutionalized, and he later became regarded as &quot;the godfather of outsider music&quot;.

Born in Los Angeles, Fischer was repeatedly sent to mental institutions as a teenager, where he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In 1968, he recorded a double album, &quot;An Evening with Wild Man Fischer&quot;, that was produced by Frank Zappa for the Bizarre label. At one point, Fischer was the opening act for the Byrds, Iron Butterfly, Solomon Burke, and Bo Diddley. His relationship with Zappa came to an abrupt end after Fischer threw a bottle that nearly hit Zappa&#x27;s daughter Moon.

In 1975, Fischer helped jumpstart Rhino Records with the novelty single &quot;Go to Rhino Records&quot;. The label put out a trilogy of albums that ultimately became his last: &quot;Wildmania&quot; (1977), &quot;Pronounced Normal&quot; (1981), and &quot;Nothing Scary&quot; (1983); the latter two were produced by the comedy music duo Barnes &amp; Barnes. A documentary about Fischer&#x27;s life, &quot;&quot;, premiered at the South by Southwest festival in 2005.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Larry Fischer was born on November 6, 1944, in Los Angeles, California. From an early age, he experienced major mood swings typical of bipolar disorder. When his mood worsened, he experienced auditory hallucinations and acted violently toward his family. He attended Fairfax High School but was expelled in 1962 for singing in class. In 1963, he was committed to Camarillo State Hospital for threatening his mother with a knife, and he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and manic depression. Released one year later, he appeared at numerous talent shows and was discovered by R&amp;B singer Solomon Burke, who gave him the nickname &quot;Wild Man&quot; and brought him along on a tour. Fischer was still living at home at this time, and in 1965, was once again institutionalized for his behavior. According to Fischer, the hospital stays only exacerbated his condition.

===&quot;An Evening with Wild Man Fischer&quot;===

By 1967, Fischer was on medication and acting as a street performer in Hollywood. For a nickel or a dime, he would offer a &quot;new kind of song&quot; to passersby as an a cappella performance. This led him to become an opening act for the Byrds, Bo Diddley, and Iron Butterfly. While performing onstage and outside at the Sunset Strip, he was noticed by Frank Zappa, bandleader for the Mothers of Invention. Zappa later said: &quot;I thought from the first day I met him that someone should make an album about Wild Man Fischer.&quot; He invited Fischer into a studio and recorded him singing about topics such as his mother, mental hospitals, fame, circles, and how he could move faster than a cat could see him. The Mothers of Invention, record producer Kim Fowley, radio DJ Rodney Bingenheimer, and Zappa&#x27;s girl group the GTOs made guest appearances on some of the tracks.

Released as a double album in 1968, &quot;An Evening with Wild Man Fischer&quot; was given a positive review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, where it was described as &quot;captur[ing] the total being of one strange member of the human community&quot;. On September 23, 1968, thanks to his connections with Zappa, Fischer appeared on &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, singing &quot;The Leaves Are Falling&quot; and &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot;. During this period he also made contributions to the 1968 psychsploitation album &quot;Bedlam&quot; by The Crazy People. In December, Zappa arranged for him to perform at a Christmas show involving the Mothers, the GTOs, Easy Chair, and Alice Cooper. Fischer sang &quot;Circles&quot;.

Fischer was frustrated that the album failed to bring him the fame he expected. One day, he visited Zappa and threw a bottle that nearly hit Zappa&#x27;s infant daughter Moon. This ended their relationship. After Frank&#x27;s death in 1993, Gail Zappa inherited her husband&#x27;s musical copyrights, and refused to reissue the album for as long as she lived feeling that the recording was &quot;a poor example of Frank&#x27;s work.&quot;

===Rhino Records albums===
In 1974, Larry appeared as a guest vocalist on noise band Smegma&#x27;s album &quot;Sing Popular Songs&quot;. In 1975, he recorded Rhino Records&#x27; first release, a novelty single entitled &quot;Go to Rhino Records&quot;. At the time, Rhino Records was only a record shop in Los Angeles. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;: &quot;Demand for [the single] proved so great that it catapulted the store&#x27;s owners into the record-producing business.&quot; Two years later he recorded their very first LP, &quot;Wildmania&quot;. In the 1980s, Fischer worked with the comedy music duo Barnes and Barnes (Bill Mumy and Robert Haimer) to produce two more albums for Rhino, &quot;Pronounced Normal&quot; (1981) and &quot;Nothing Scary&quot; (1984). In 1986, Barnes and Barnes also wrote and produced &quot;It&#x27;s a Hard Business&quot;, a duet featuring Fischer and Rosemary Clooney. The song was the result of a telephone friendship they began due to mutual acquaintances. In 1988, a judge awarded Fischer royalties on his song &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot; (from the videocassette release of the movie &quot;Medium Cool&quot;), but the attorney representing Fischer did not know how to contact him. Fischer was still homeless, living in motels and on the streets while panhandling at places like Dodger Stadium and Disneyland. He performed at the 1988 San Diego Comic Con with Bill Mumy&#x27;s group as his backing band.

In 1998, &quot;Date with the Devils Daughter&quot;, an album by Robert Williams (a drummer formerly with Captain Beefheart) includes &quot;Hello Robert&quot;, which consists of messages that Fischer left on Williams&#x27;s phone. In 1999, Rhino released &quot;The Fischer King&quot;, a two-CD package comprising 100 tracks and a 20-page booklet, which sold out within weeks. The limited-edition album comprises his entire Rhino catalog, including all three of the Rhino albums plus singles, unreleased material, interviews done for this release, and his duet with Clooney. It releases almost everything Fischer ever recorded, except &quot;An Evening with Wild Man Fischer&quot;, for which the Zappa family still held the rights.

===Final years and death===
Fischer was mentioned in Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s 1990 novel, Vineland. In the early 2000s, Fischer was filmed as the subject of a full-length documentary, &quot;&quot;, which premiered at South by Southwest in March 2005. Co-director Josh Rubin called the four years making the film &quot;the most arduous, trying time of my life&quot; due to Fischer&#x27;s erratic behavior. It included an appearance from Devo&#x27;s Mark Mothersbaugh who called him: &quot;as pure a rock and roll icon as you can find. He&#x27;s mainlined into the creative subconscious.&quot; In 2004, Fischer was the subject of a comic book (&quot;The Legend of Wild Man Fischer&quot; by Dennis Eichhorn), and in October, appeared on ABC-TV&#x27;s late-night talk/comedy show, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;.

In 2003, Fischer had a six-month-long paranoid episode, convinced somebody was trying to kill him, and he started living on the streets again. He called Bill Mumy up to 20 times a day, hanging up each time, until Mumy finally had to change his phone number. Fischer eventually moved in with his aunt Josephine, but three weeks later she was diagnosed with terminal cancer (this happened during the filming of &quot;Derailroaded&quot;). Fischer and his family consented to move him into an assisted-living mental institution in Van Nuys. The medications he was prescribed helped him control his behavior, but it also eliminated his creative drive, or &quot;pep&quot;. Fischer made his final performance on August 16, 2006, at the Trunk Space in Phoenix, Arizona.

The last seven years of Fischer&#x27;s life were spent peacefully but uneventfully. On June 16, 2011, he died of heart failure at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, at the age of 66.

<text>The black-tailed skimmer (Orthetrum cancellatum) is a dragonfly belonging to the family Libellulidae.

==Distribution==
This species is widespread in Europe and Asia. It is found throughout European continent including the Mediterranean islands but is absent in the north of Britain and the northern half of Fennoscandia. This is one of the most common European species and it is still increasing its range northwards. To the east, the range extends over central Asia to Kashmir, Mongolia to the northern parts of China and Arunachal Pradesh in India.

It is present in Albania, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, China, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France (Corsica, and mainland), Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Turkey (Turkey-in-Europe), Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and in part of United Kingdom.

The black-tailed skimmer is abundant throughout its range and is one of the most commonly seen dragonflies in Europe. It holds a stable population and has no known major threats.

This species has expanded its range, assisted by the creation of gravel pits which give it the extensive open unvegetated areas it prefers. It was first recorded in Great Britain in Essex in 1934. It is decreasing rapidly in the Maltese Islands.

==Habitat==
This dragonfly is found at any open water with bare patches along the shore where the patrolling males frequently rest in the sun. It also inhabits near slow-flowing waters. It favors lakes, slow rivers, ponds and sometimes marshy area, without dense riparian vegetation. Females are less bold and not encountered as regularly. Adults prefer to perch on bare ground and rocks.

==Description==
It is a fairly large dragonfly (the length of 47–53 mm, 29–35 mm abdomen, rear wing 35–41 mm.) with relatively broad, flattened abdomen, but not as broad as to chaser species. With age, adult males develop extensive blue pruinescence on their abdomen, offset by yellow lateral patches. The middle lobe of the pronotum is large and notched in the middle. The chest is yellow or yellowish-brown. The base of the hind wings do not show a dark opaque spots. The pterostigma is dark brown or black. On the front wings pterostigma 2–3 mm long. Anal appendages are black. The females and immature males are a deep yellow color, with wavy black lines dorsally on their abdomen. Males and females have the costal vein (the leading edge of the wing) yellow or black.

The species is similar to its much more localized congener the &quot;Orthetrum albistylum&quot;, but readily identifiable in the field. The males develop a blue pruinescence on the abdomen darkening to the rear with S8-10 becoming black. Its eyes are very dark green. They fly swift and low, skimming the water surface. Females retain their color and markings though they become quite grayish brown with age. This species could be confused with Keeled skimmer or Scarce chaser.

==Adults==
♂: Adult males have a bluish or blue-gray patina on the body, gradually darkening with age. They have a blue abdomen with a black tip and transparent wings. The young have a grid pattern on a yellow-brownish abdomen.

♀: Adult females have a yellow-brownish abdomen with a lattice pattern (wide longitudinal dark brown stripes and bright crescent-shaped spots) and transparent wings. 10 tergite of abdomen is black. Even the abdomen of the immature males looks that way.

Adults can reach a length of about 47–53 mm. Average wingspan is about 77 mm, while hindwings are 35–40 mm long. The eyes are dorsally narrowly apposed to dorsally broadly contiguous. They are brown (in the female), or blue (in the male). Legs are black and brown (the femoral bases brown). Thoracic antehumeral stripes are absent. The wings spread more or less horizontally in repose. They are dissimilar in shape and venation, sessile, unpatterned and clear. The inner wing venation is blackish. Discoidal cell is divided longitudinally into a conspicuous triangle and supra-triangle. There are antenodal veins in the forewings 10–13 (fewer in the hindwings). Pterostigma is well over twice but no more than five times as long as wide. Abdomen is lanceolate and 30–35 mm long; predominantly blue (in the male), or brown (in the female), or grey (sometimes, in old females). It is rather plain (in the male, but often with orange lateral markings, and darkened over the terminal segments), or predominantly longitudinally lined (the female with a dark medio-lateral band on either side along each segment); without mid-dorsal spots. The male abdomen is without auricles on segment 2; with a single inferior anal appendage.

==Nymphs==
The nymphs are stout, body is expanded in the middle. When mature, they are 23–25.5 mm long. The postocular lobes is curving sharply to the back of the head from some distance behind the eyes. The antennae is 7 segmented. The mask have the prementum hollowed dorsally. The prementum bears three (rarely two or four) long setae inserted near each lateral margin, and two medial fields of seven to eight short spiniform setae, the latter flanked by four setae of medium length. The body of the labial palps bears 6 or 7 major setae. Distal margins of the labial palps are weakly crenate. Legs are longer than the abdomen. The abdomen terminates in five short spine-like appendages. The cerci are no more than half the length of the paraprocts. The abdomen has mid-dorsal spines. The mid-dorsal abdominal spines are prominent on segments 3 to 6. The abdomen is without a mid-dorsal spine on segment 8; gizzard with 4–8 folds.
==Biology and behavior==
The main flight period is June and July. Males characteristically perch horizontally on exposed surfaces. They fly swift and low, skimming the water surface, while defending their territories. Mating can occur in flight or on land.

Females oviposit alone but with male in attendance. Eggs are laid in flight by dipping abdomen onto water surface. They hatch after five or six weeks and the larvae live partially hidden by bottom debris. They emerge after two or three years. Larvae prefer bottom areas rich in vegetation and decaying plant material.

<doc id="293870" wikidata="Q1936970" url="?curid=293870" title="Natural Bridges National Monument">
<text>Natural Bridges National Monument is a U.S. National Monument located about northwest of the Four Corners boundary of southeast Utah, in the western United States, at the junction of White Canyon and Armstrong Canyon, part of the Colorado River drainage. It features the thirteenth largest natural bridge in the world, carved from the white Permian sandstone of the Cedar Mesa Formation that gives White Canyon its name.

The three bridges in the park are named &quot;Kachina&quot;, &quot;Owachomo&quot;, and &quot;Sipapu&quot; (the largest), which are all Hopi names. A natural bridge is formed through erosion by water flowing in the stream bed of the canyon. During periods of flash floods, particularly, the stream undercuts the walls of rock that separate the meanders (or &quot;goosenecks&quot;) of the stream until the rock wall within the meander is undercut and the meander is cut off and the new stream bed then flows underneath the bridge. Eventually, as erosion and gravity enlarge the bridge&#x27;s opening, the bridge collapses under its own weight. There is evidence of at least two collapsed natural bridges within the Monument.

==History==
Humans have lived in the area around Natural Bridges since as early as 7500 BCE, as shown by rock art and stone tools found at nearby sites. Around 700 CE ancestors of modern Puebloan people moved to the site, constructing stone and mortar buildings and granaries. These structures share similarities with those found in Mesa Verde National Park, which can be seen distantly, to the east, from the Bears Ears on the park&#x27;s eastern border. Like the people of Mesa Verde, the residents of Natural Bridges seem to have left the region around the year 1270.

Europeans first visited the area in 1883 when gold prospector, Cass Hite followed White Canyon upstream, from the Colorado River, and found the bridges near the junction of White and Armstrong canyons. In 1904, the &quot;National Geographic Magazine&quot; publicized the bridges and the area was designated a National Monument on April 16, 1908, by President Theodore Roosevelt. It is Utah&#x27;s first National Monument.

The Monument was nearly inaccessible for many decades as reflected by the visitor log kept by the Monument&#x27;s superintendents. Reaching the site from Blanding, Utah, the nearest settlement would take a three-day horseback ride. The park received little visitation until after the uranium boom of the 1950s, which resulted in the creation of new roads in the area, including modern-day Utah State Route 95, which was paved in 1976.

== Geology ==
Located within the Colorado Plateau, the monument has three distinct bridges in White and Armstrong Canyons. These canyons were formed when the Colorado River eroded the Permian Cedar Mesa Sandstone. The Sipapu, Kachina, and Owachoma bridges were formed through rock decay, weathering and erosion, as water cut through narrow canyon walls. The monument is also the location of significant Biological soil crust. In places, Desert varnish darkens the lighter White Cedar Mesa Sandstone in places. The Monument&#x27;s elevation ranges up to .

==Attractions==
The main attractions are the natural bridges, accessible from the Bridge View Drive, which winds along the park and goes by all three bridges, and by hiking trails leading down to the bases of the bridges. There is also a campground and picnic areas and a visitor center within the park. Electricity in the park comes entirely from a large solar array near the visitor center.

In 2007, the International Dark-Sky Association named Natural Bridges the first International Dark-Sky Park, which is a designation that recognizes not only that the park has some of the darkest and clearest skies in all of the United States, but also that the park has made every effort to conserve the natural dark as a resource worthy of protection. , Natural Bridges has the only night sky monitored by the NPS Night Sky Team that rates a Class 2 on the Bortle Dark-Sky Scale, giving it the darkest sky ever assessed.

Horsecollar Ruin is an Ancestral Puebloan ruin visible from an overlook a short hike from Bridge View Drive. The site was abandoned more than 700 years ago but is in a remarkable state of preservation, including an undisturbed rectangular kiva with the original roof and interior, and two granaries with unusual oval-shaped doors whose shape resembles horse collars (hence the site&#x27;s name).

==Biology==
Animal species found in the National Monument include birds such as the pinyon jay, canyon wren, and turkeys (which were reintroduced by the State of Utah to the table-lands above the Monument) and mammals like rabbits, pack rats, bobcats, coyotes, bears, mule deer, and mountain lion. The Monument&#x27;s pygmy rattlesnakes have been the subject of occasional study; several lizard species common to southern Utah are abundant. In May 2006, KSL Newsradio reported a case of plague found in dead field mice and chipmunks at Natural Bridges.

Native plant species include willow, cottonwood, Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, pinyon pine, juniper, grasses, annuals, and perennials such as asters, penstemons, buckwheats, and Indian paintbrush, and various shrubs such as dwarf oaks, bayberry, manzanita, buffaloberry, rabbitbrush, black brush, brittle brush, Apache&#x27;s plume, sage, yucca, and Mormon tea. Invasive species include tumbleweeds, certain thistles, dandelions, and tamarisk.

Much of the Monument&#x27;s ground is covered in communities of cryptobiotic soil crusts, which prevents soil erosion and promotes the retention of soil nutrients.

==Climate==
Natural Bridges National Monument has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;) with cold winters and hot summers.

<doc id="293872" wikidata="Q7063014" url="?curid=293872" title="Notice of proposed rulemaking">
<text>A notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) is a public notice that is issued by law when a U.S. federal agency wishes to add, remove, or change a rule or regulation as part of the rulemaking process. The notice is an important part of US administrative law, which facilitates government by typically creating a process of taking of public comment. The term is also used at the state level in the United States.

==Procedure==
Although it is not required by the US Constitution, NPRM is required and defined by the Administrative Procedure Act, section 553. The US Congress created the requirement to enlighten agencies and to force them to listen to comments and concerns of people who will likely be affected by the regulation. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Federal Communications Commission (FCC), National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are examples of agencies subject to the NPRM.

The NPRM is published in the &quot;Federal Register&quot; and typically gives 60 days for public comment from any interested party and an additional 30 days for reply comments. Original comments may still be filed in the reply comments window. While that is the normal method of agency rulemaking, emergency rulemaking may bypass the NPRM process. A notice is not required to be published in the Federal Register if all persons subject to it are named and personally served with a copy of it.

Each notice, whether published in the Federal Register or personally served, includes:
#A statement of the time, place, and nature of the proposed rulemaking proceeding;
#A reference to the authority under which it is issued;
#A description of the subjects and issues involved or the substance and terms of the proposed regulation;
#A statement of the time within which written comments must be submitted; and
#A statement of how and to what extent interested persons may participate in the proceeding.

NPRMs are often preceded by a notice of inquiry (NOI) in which comments are invited but no rules have yet been proposed. Comments received in that period allow the agency to prepare the NPRM better by making more-informed decisions on proposals. An NPRM may be followed by a further notice of proposed rulemaking (FNPRM), if the comments from the initial NPRM lead the agency to change the proposal drastically to the point that further comment is required. Rules are finalized when a report and order (R&amp;O) is issued, which may be amended with a second R&amp;O (or more) in a continuing proceeding (such as the DTV transition).

Regulations.gov is a website established in 2002 to provide better access to rulemaking and allows comments to be posted to nearly 300 federal agencies.

In some circumstances, a federal agency is allowed to finalize a new regulation without first publishing it as a proposed rule in the Federal Register. The agency must disclose its reason when publishing the final rule.

==Foreign equivalents==
Equivalent procedures of public consultation are also used outside the United States for a document giving public notice of a proposed rule change and inviting informed comment on it. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) publishes similar notices referred to a notice of proposed amendment when it seeks public comment.

<text>Vassiliy Valeryevich Jirov (; born 4 April 1974), sometimes known as Vasily Zhirov, is a Kazakhstani former professional boxer who competed from 1997 to 2009, and held the IBF cruiserweight title from 1999 to 2003. As an amateur he won a gold medal at the 1996 Olympics, as well as consecutive bronzes at the 1993 and 1995 World Championships, all in the light heavyweight division.

==Amateur career==
Jirov took up boxing in 1986 when he was 12, studying at the Balkhash Technical School. His first coach was Alexander Apachinsky (Merited Trainer of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Master of Sports of the USSR). Jirov later recalled that:

From 1989 to 1991, he became the champion of the Kazakh SSR three times in a row. In 1990 he became the champion of the All-Union Spartakiad of Young Students (4 fights, 4 victories, Moscow,) and also won the USSR Youth Championship (4 fights, 4 victories, Donetsk,) received a degree of Master of Sports of the USSR in boxing.

In 1991, Jirov, who was yet at the junior age class, didn&#x27;t win the USSR Championship in Saratov (4 fights, 3 wins, 2nd place,) however he received an invitation to the USSR youth team.

In 1994, Vassiliy moved to the light heavyweight division (up to 81 kg.)

In December 1996, Jirov travelled to the United States, where he signed a contract with boxing promoter Bob Arum and began his career as a professional boxer.

Jirov was awarded the Val Barker Trophy for outstanding performance at the 1996 Summer Olympics.

He finished his amateur career having 217 fights under his belt, with a record of 207 wins, 10 losses (no stoppages.)

==Professional career==
Jirov made his debut as a professional on 18 January 1997, with a two-round knockout of Vince Brown in Las Vegas. He won eleven fights that first year, all by knockout, including wins over Exum Speight and Art Jimmerson. In 1998, he won eight fights, six before the final bell. On 5 May he won the WBC&#x27;s regional cruiserweight title with a 12-round decision over Rich La Montaigne, who became the first boxer to last the full distance against Jirov. On 5 December he once again fought in Ukrainian territory. In his first fight as a professional in Ukraine, he beat Alexander Vasiliev in Kyiv by decision in eight rounds.

===IBF cruiserweight champion===

In 1999, Jirov was given his first world title try: In front of an HBO Boxing audience, he beat IBF world Cruiserweight champion Arthur Williams by a knockout in seven rounds at Biloxi, Mississippi, to become that organization&#x27;s world cruiserweight champion.

For his first defense, he fought at the main supportive event at the Felix Trinidad-Oscar De La Hoya undercard on 18 September, retaining the crown with a ten-round knockout of Canadian Dale Brown.

In 2000, he beat Saul Montana by knockout in round nine to retain the world title on an Univision televised fight, and won two non-title bouts, including one over Esteban Pizarro at the Playboy mansion.

On 6 February 2001, Jirov went to Kazakhstan to defend his crown in his home-country for the first time. There, he retained the title with a first-round knockout of Álex González. He won three more fights that year, one a world title affair against Julian Letterlough (knockout win in 8).

There were reports that Jirov&#x27;s team and HBO were trying to negotiate a matchup against Roy Jones Jr., but those talks fell through. 

In 2002 Jirov, then managed by the Sugar Ray Leonard promotion company, defended his crown once that year, beating former world Middleweight champion Jorge Castro of Argentina by a 12-round decision on 1 February at the Celebrity Theater in Phoenix. Talks had begun about a fight of his against former multiple division world champion James Toney. However, negotiations took long and Jirov spent more than one year outside the ring, time in which the IBF threatened to take away recognition of Jirov as world champion if he did not defend his crown soon. As a result of these managerial problems, Jirov also moved from the SAR club gym, favored by his management, to Joe Diaz&#x27;s Gym, near Downtown Phoenix.

===Losing the title to Toney===

Jirov and Toney finally met on 26 April 2003, and Jirov suffered his first career defeat, when he lost the IBF cruiserweight title to Toney by a 12-round unanimous decision. On 9 August Jirov came back, beating fringe contender Ernest Mateen by knockout in seven rounds.

On 6 November 2003 he won the NABO regional cruiserweight title with a six-round knockout of Joseph Kiwanuka in Phoenix. Jirov&#x27;s next fight was against ex-heavyweight champion, Michael Moorer. Jirov was beaten by Moorer via TKO in the ninth round. Over the next six months, Jirov defeated Forrest Neal by knockout in round 3 and defeated Troy Beats by unanimous decision. His next fight was against former heavyweight and cruiserweight contender Orlin Norris. Jirov and Norris fought to a draw.

In his first return bout to the cruiserweight division (April 20, 2006) he defeated Luke Munsen in a unanimous decision.
On 14 July 2007 Jirov defeated Kenny &#x27;The Raven&#x27; Craven by TKO in second round of 10 round scheduled bout.

As a heavyweight, Jirov also lost to Joe Mesi by unanimous decision, after throwing a blow to Mesi that resulted in subdural bleeding near the fight&#x27;s end. It also marked the downturn in Jirov&#x27;s fighting career, and after a few more fights, he retired in 2009.

===Post-fight career in boxing===
Jirov lives in Arizona and works at the Scottsdale Boxing Club as a coach. Reflecting on his time as a fighter, Jirov said: “I travelled the world, got paid and kicked some ass.”

<doc id="293877" wikidata="Q313820" url="?curid=293877" title="Duane Allman">
<text>Howard Duane Allman (November 20, 1946 – October 29, 1971) was an American rock and blues guitarist and the founder and original leader of the Allman Brothers Band, for which he was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995.

Born in Nashville, Tennessee, Allman began playing the guitar at age 14. He formed the Allman Brothers Band with his brother Gregg in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1969. The group achieved its greatest success in the early 1970s. Allman is best remembered for his brief but influential tenure in the band and in particular for his expressive slide guitar playing and inventive improvisational skills. A sought-after session musician both before and during his tenure with the band, Duane Allman performed with such established stars as King Curtis, Aretha Franklin, Herbie Mann, Wilson Pickett, and Boz Scaggs. He also contributed greatly to the only studio album by Derek and the Dominos, &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot; (1970).

Allman died following a motorcycle crash on October 29, 1971, at the age of 24.

In 2003, he was ranked number 2 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time, second only to Jimi Hendrix. In 2011, he was ranked number 9 and in 2023 he was ranked 10th. His guitar tone (achieved with a Gibson Les Paul and two 50-watt bass Marshall amplifiers) was named one of the greatest of all time by &quot;Guitar Player&quot;.

==Early years==
Duane Allman was born on November 20, 1946, in Nashville, Tennessee. He was the elder son of Willis Allman (1918–1949) who, at the time of his death, was a second lieutenant on active duty in the United States Army, having served as an Army non-commissioned officer during World War II; and Geraldine Allman (née Robbins) (1917–2015). His brother, Gregg, was born on December 8, 1947.

On December 26, 1949, when the family was living near Norfolk, Virginia, where he was stationed, Willis Allman was murdered during an armed robbery by Michael Robert &quot;Buddy&quot; Green (1923–2024), an Army veteran that Allman and another recruiting officer had befriended earlier that day. Green was captured, convicted, sentenced and paroled in 1972. So that she could retrain as an accountant, Geraldine &quot;Mama A&quot; Allman sent Duane and Gregg to Castle Heights Military Academy in Lebanon, Tennessee, which they both disliked intensely. In 1957, the family moved to Daytona Beach, Florida, where the boys attended Seabreeze High School.

The boys returned to Nashville to spend summers with their grandmother, and there Gregg learned guitar basics from a neighbor. In 1960, he had saved enough money to buy his first guitar, a Japanese-made Teisco Silvertone, while Duane acquired a Harley 165 motorbike. Despite Duane being left-handed, he played the guitar right-handed. Duane began to take an interest in the guitar, and the boys would sometimes fight over it, until Duane wrecked the motorbike and traded it for a Silvertone of his own. His mother eventually bought Duane a Gibson Les Paul Junior.

It was also in Nashville that the boys became musically inspired by a rhythm-and-blues concert where they saw blues guitarist B.B. King perform. Duane told Gregg, &quot;We got to get into this.&quot; Duane learned to play very quickly and soon became the better guitarist of the two.

==Career==
===1961–1968: Allman Joys and Hour Glass===
The brothers started playing publicly in 1961, joining or forming a number of local groups. Around this time, Duane left school to focus on his guitar playing. His early band &quot;The Escorts&quot; opened for the Beach Boys in 1965 but disbanded, some of its members eventually forming the Allman Joys. After Gregg graduated from Seabreeze High School in 1965, the Allman Joys went on the road, performing throughout the Southeast, and eventually were based in Nashville. The Allman Joys became Hour Glass and moved to Los Angeles in early 1967. There Hour Glass recorded two albums for Liberty Records, but the band was unsatisfied. Liberty tried to market them as a pop band, ignoring the band&#x27;s desire to play more blues-oriented material. Hour Glass broke up in early 1968. Duane and Gregg went back to Florida, where they played on demo sessions with the 31st of February, a folk rock outfit whose drummer was Butch Trucks. Gregg returned to California to fulfill Hour Glass obligations, while Duane jammed around Florida for months but did not get another band going.

Duane began to learn to play slide guitar on his birthday in 1968. He was recovering from an injury to his left elbow, suffered in a fall from a horse. Gregg brought him a birthday present, the debut album by Taj Mahal, and a bottle of Coricidin pills. He left them on the front porch and rang the bell, as Duane was angry with him about the injury. &quot;About two hours after I left, my phone rang,&quot; Gregg recalled. &quot;&#x27;Baby brother, baby brother, get over here now!&#x27;&quot; Duane had poured the pills out of the Coricidin bottle, washed off the label and was using it as a slide to play along with the album track &quot;Statesboro Blues&quot; (on the recording, the slide guitar is played by Jesse Ed Davis). &quot;Duane had never played slide before,&quot; Gregg later said, but &quot;he just picked it up and started burnin&#x27;. He was a natural.&quot; The song became a part of the Allman Brothers Band&#x27;s repertoire, and Duane&#x27;s slide guitar became crucial to their sound. Because of his use of the early-1970s-era Coricidin medicine bottle, which is no longer manufactured, replica Coricidin bottles are now popular with slide guitar players who like its glassy feel and sound.

===1966–1969: Session musician===
Allman&#x27;s first major recording session occurred in early 1966 at Nashville&#x27;s RCA Studio &quot;B&quot;, two years before his famed tenure at Muscle Shoals&#x27; FAME Studios. Producer Tony Moon was recording The Vogues&#x27; first album after his successful &quot;5&quot;O&#x27;Clock World&quot; had reached the Top 5, and had been recorded in that same studio. He hired Allman to play on several sides, as he wanted a more rock sound. At the time, The Allman Joys were the house band at The Briar Patch in Nashville. Allman&#x27;s playing on the two Hour Glass albums and an Hour Glass session in early 1968 at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, caught the ear of Rick Hall, owner of FAME. In November 1968 Hall bought Allman&#x27;s contract for $10,000. Allman, tired of the studio limitation, was able to play on his first album as a sessions ace with Wilson Pickett. Allman&#x27;s work on that album, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; (1968), got him hired as a full-time session musician at Muscle Shoals and brought him to the attention of other musicians, notably Eric Clapton, who later said, &quot;I remember hearing Wilson Pickett&#x27;s &#x27;Hey Jude&#x27; and just being astounded by the lead break at the end. I had to know who that was immediately—right now.&quot;

Allman&#x27;s performance on &quot;Hey Jude&quot; impressed Atlantic Records producer and executive Jerry Wexler when Hall played it over the phone for him. Wexler immediately bought Allman&#x27;s recording contract from Hall and wanted to use him on sessions with Atlantic R&amp;B artists. While at Muscle Shoals, Allman played on recordings by numerous artists, including Clarence Carter, King Curtis, Aretha Franklin, Laura Nyro, Wilson Pickett, Otis Rush, Percy Sledge, Johnny Jenkins, Boz Scaggs, Delaney &amp; Bonnie, Doris Duke and jazz flautist Herbie Mann. For his first sessions with Franklin, Allman traveled to New York where, in January 1969, he went as an audience member to the Fillmore East to see Johnny Winter and told Muscle Shoals guitarist Jimmy Johnson that in a year he would be on that stage. That December, the Allman Brothers Band indeed played the Fillmore. Coincidentally, the Fillmore East performances recorded for the Allman Brothers album &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; in March 1971—often considered the high water mark for the band—were on the same bill as Johnny Winter.

===1968: Formation of the Allman Brothers Band===
When asked how the band came together Duane stated: &quot;Very slowly. I was in Muscle Shoals and I went down to Jacksonville and was jamming with Berry and Dickey. Jaimoe came with me from Muscle Shoals; he&#x27;s originally from Macon. Gregg was in California and Butch was in Jacksonville where we all got together and jammed for a couple of months putting together songs and stuff. We just needed a singer and Gregg was the guy. Two weeks after Gregg got back from California we went up to New York and recorded there. We played live gigs before our first album was released in November [of 1969].&quot;

While visiting St. Louis, Allman met Donna Roosman, who bore his second child, Galadrielle. The couple&#x27;s relationship soon ended. He had an earlier relationship with Patti Chandlee which resulted in the birth of a daughter who was born deaf.

===1969–1971: Success with &quot;Layla&quot; and &quot;At Fillmore East&quot;===
The Allman Brothers Band went on to become one of the most influential rock groups of the 1970s. George Kimball, writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1971, described the group as &quot;the best damn rock and roll band this country has produced in the past five years.&quot; After months of nonstop rehearsing and gigging without Gregg, including free shows in Central City Park in Macon and Piedmont Park in Atlanta, all they needed was a singer/organist and Duane knew who he wanted. When Gregg got back from California the group settled on the name of the band and was ready to record. Their debut album, &quot;The Allman Brothers Band&quot;, was recorded in New York in September 1969 and released a few months later. In the midst of intense touring, work began in Macon and Miami (at Atlantic South–Criteria Studios), and a little bit in New York, on the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Idlewild South.&quot; Produced mostly by Tom Dowd, &quot;Idlewild South&quot; was released in August 1970 and broke new ground for them by getting into the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

After a concert in Miami, in August, watched by Eric Clapton and the other members of Derek and the Dominos, the two bands went back to Criteria Studios in Miami, where the Dominoes were recording &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot;. Members of both bands jammed, after which Allman and Clapton stayed up all night trading and showing one another favorite licks, discovering they had a deep and instinctive rapport. Allman participated in the recording of most of the album&#x27;s tracks, contributing some of his best-known work. He never left the Allman Brothers Band, though, despite being offered a permanent position with Clapton. Allman never toured with Derek and the Dominos, but he did make at least two appearances with them, on December 1, 1970, at the Curtis Hixon Hall in Tampa (&quot;Soulmates&quot; LP), and on the following day at Onondaga County War Memorial in Syracuse, New York. It is unclear whether he also appeared with them on November 20, 1970, at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium when guitarist Delaney Bramlett performed with the band.

In an interview, Allman told listeners how to tell who played what: Clapton played the Fender parts and Allman the Gibson parts. He continued by noting that the Fender had a sparklier sound, while the Gibson produced more of a &quot;full-tilt screech&quot;. Clapton wrote later in his autobiography that he and Allman were inseparable during the sessions in Florida; he talked about Allman as the &quot;musical brother I&#x27;d never had but wished I did.&quot;

The Allman Brothers went on to record &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; in March 1971. Meanwhile, Allman continued contributing session work to other artists&#x27; albums whenever he could. According to &quot;Skydog: The Duane Allman Story,&quot; he would spontaneously drop in at recording sessions and contribute to whatever was being taped that day. He received cash payments but no recording credits, making it virtually impossible to compile a complete discography of his works.

Allman was well known for his melodic, extended and attention-holding guitar solos. During this period two of his stated influences were Miles Davis and John Coltrane. He said that he had listened intently to Davis&#x27;s &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; for two years.

As Allman&#x27;s distinctive electric bottleneck sound began to mature, it evolved into the musical voice of what would come to be known as Southern rock, being picked up by other slide guitarists, including his bandmate Dickey Betts (after Allman&#x27;s death), Derek Trucks, Gary Rossington of Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Joe Walsh. Duane also taught a young Don Felder to play slide.

==Personal life==
Allman had a daughter, Galadrielle Allman, with Donna Roosman in 1969. In 2014, Galadrielle Allman published a reflection on her father, mother, family, and the culture of the 1960s, called &quot;Please Be with Me: A Song for My Father&quot;.

==Death==
Allman was killed in a motorcycle crash shortly after the release and initial success of &quot;At Fillmore East&quot;.

On October 29, 1971, while the band was on a break from touring and recording, Allman was riding his Harley-Davidson Sportster motorcycle at high speed on Hillcrest Avenue, in the western part of Macon. As he approached Bartlett Street, a flatbed boom truck stopped suddenly in the intersection, forcing him to swerve sharply. He struck either the back of the truck or the ball on the crane and was thrown from the motorcycle, which landed on top of him and skidded another with him pinned underneath it, crushing his internal organs.

He was alive when he arrived at a hospital, but despite immediate medical treatment, he died several hours later from massive internal injuries.

===Memorial===

Allman&#x27;s funeral service was held on Monday, November 1, 1971, at Snow&#x27;s Memorial Chapel in Macon, Georgia. In the chapel, packed with family and friends, many of the musicians who had been part of Allman&#x27;s life were in attendance to mourn his death. Record producer Jerry Wexler gave the eulogy. Wexler praised Allman&#x27;s musical achievements; his uncompromising dedication to Southern gospel, country, and blues music; and the place he attained alongside the great black musicians and blues singers from the South. The band, joined by others, played several tunes, concluding with a group rendition of the Southern spiritual &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot;, a band favorite.

== Legacy ==
After Allman&#x27;s funeral and some weeks of mourning, the five surviving members of the Allman Brothers Band carried on, resuming live performances and finishing the recording work interrupted by Allman&#x27;s death. They named their next album &quot;Eat a Peach&quot; for Allman&#x27;s response to an interviewer&#x27;s question: &quot;How are you helping the revolution?&quot; Allman replied, &quot;I&#x27;m hitting a lick for peace, and every time I&#x27;m in Georgia I eat a peach for peace. But you can&#x27;t help the revolution, because there&#x27;s just evolution. I&#x27;m a player. And players don&#x27;t give a damn for nothing but playing...&quot; Released as a double album in February 1972, it contains a side of live and studio tracks with Allman, two sides of &quot;Mountain Jam&quot;, recorded with Allman at the same time as &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; in March, and a side of tracks by the surviving five members of the band.

Allman Brothers Band bassist Berry Oakley died less than 13 months later, also at the age of 24, in a similar motorcycle crash with a city bus, three blocks from the site of Allman&#x27;s fatal accident. Oakley was buried beside Allman in Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon, Georgia.

The variety of Allman&#x27;s session work and Allman Brothers Band bandleading can be heard to good effect on two posthumous Capricorn releases, &quot;An Anthology&quot; (1972) and &quot;An Anthology Volume II&quot; (1974). There are also several archival releases of live Allman Brothers Band performances from what the band calls &quot;Duane&#x27;s era&quot;.
Shortly after Allman&#x27;s death, Ronnie Van Zant of Lynyrd Skynyrd dedicated the song &quot;Free Bird&quot; to Allman&#x27;s memory. Van Zant would sometimes allude to this in concert; in the band&#x27;s 1976 performance of &quot;Free Bird&quot; in Knebworth, England, Van Zant said to pianist Billy Powell, &quot;Play it for Duane Allman.&quot; The song was written well before Allman died and was not written with him in mind. (Allen Collins wrote the song after his then girlfriend asked him the question &quot;if I leave here tomorrow, would you still remember me?&quot;)

In 1973, four boys who were Hinds Junior College students living in Vicksburg, Mississippi carved the very large letters &quot;REMEMBER DUANE ALLMAN&quot; into a vertical excavation face beside Interstate Highway 20 between Vicksburg and the school&#x27;s campus in Raymond on the route they travelled together while commuting between their homes and campus. A photograph was published in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine and in the &quot;Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;; the carving lasted for over 10 years.

In 1998, the Georgia State Legislature passed a resolution designating a stretch of State Highway 19, U.S. Route 41, within Macon, as Duane Allman Boulevard in his honor. The route, which passes near The Allman Brothers Band Museum (at &quot;The Big House&quot;, where the band once lived) and the H&amp;H Restaurant, where the band members often dined, crosses the Raymond Berry Oakley III Bridge.

Country singer Travis Tritt, in the song &quot;Put Some Drive in Your Country&quot; on his debut album, sings &quot;Now I still love old country / I ain&#x27;t tryin&#x27; to put it down / But damn I miss Duane Allman / I wish he was still around.&quot;

&quot;Skydog&quot;, a seven-CD box set tracing the virtuosity of Allman on the guitar, was released in 2013 with the help of his daughter, Galadrielle Allman. A March 16 interview with her on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Edition Saturday&quot; by Scott Simon runs over eight minutes, includes many details, and is highlighted with clips of his playing, including links to an audio file prepared for the broadcast.

Duane Allman was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 as a member of the Allman Brothers Band.

<text>A generic drug is a pharmaceutical drug that contains the same chemical substance as a drug that was originally protected by chemical patents. Generic drugs are allowed for sale after the patents on the original drugs expire. Because the active chemical substance is the same, the medical profile of generics is equivalent in performance compared to their performance at the time when they were patented drugs. A generic drug has the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) as the original, but it may differ in some characteristics such as the manufacturing process, formulation, excipients, color, taste, and packaging.

Although they may not be associated with a particular company, generic drugs are usually subject to government regulations in the countries in which they are dispensed. They are labeled with the name of the manufacturer and a generic non-proprietary name such as the United States Adopted Name (USAN) or International Nonproprietary Name (INN) of the drug. A generic drug must contain the same active ingredients as the original brand-name formulation. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires generics to be identical to or within an acceptable bioequivalent range of their brand-name counterparts, with respect to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties.

Biopharmaceuticals, such as monoclonal antibodies, differ biologically from small-molecule drugs. Biosimilars have active pharmaceutical ingredients that are almost identical to the original product and are typically regulated under an extended set of rules, but they are not the same as generic drugs as the active ingredients are not the same as those of their reference products. In most cases, generic products become available after the patent protections afforded to the drug&#x27;s original developer expire. Once generic drugs enter the market, competition often leads to substantially lower prices for both the original brand-name product and its generic equivalents. In most countries, patents give 20 years of protection. However, many countries and regions, such as the European Union and the United States, may grant up to five years of additional protection (&quot;patent term restoration&quot;) if manufacturers meet specific goals, such as conducting clinical trials for pediatric patients.

Manufacturers, wholesalers, insurers, and drugstores can all increase prices at various stages of production and distribution. In 2014, according to an analysis by the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, generic drugs accounted for 88 percent of the 4.3 billion prescriptions filled in the United States. &quot;Branded generics&quot; on the other hand are defined by the FDA and National Health Service as &quot;products that are (a) either novel dosage forms of off-patent products produced by a manufacturer that is not the originator of the molecule, or (b) a molecule copy of an off-patent product with a trade name.&quot; Since the company making branded generics can spend little on research and development, it is able to spend on marketing alone, thus earning higher profits and driving costs down. For example, the largest revenues of Ranbaxy, now owned by Sun Pharma, came from branded generics.

==Nomenclature==
Generic drug names are constructed using standardized affixes that distinguish drugs between and within classes and suggest their action.

==Economics==
When a pharmaceutical company first markets a drug, it is usually under a patent that, until it expires, the company can use to exclude competitors by suing them for patent infringement. Pharmaceutical companies that develop new drugs generally only invest in drug candidates with strong patent protection as a strategy to recoup their costs of drug development (including the costs of the drug candidates that fail) and to make a profit. The average cost to a brand-name company of discovering, testing, and obtaining regulatory approval for a new drug, with a new chemical entity, was estimated to be as much as US$800 million in 2003 and US$2.6 billion in 2014. Drug companies that bring new products have several product line extension strategies they use to extend their exclusivity, some of which are seen as gaming the system and labeled &quot;evergreening&quot; by critics, but at some point there is no patent protection available. For as long as a drug patent lasts, a brand-name company enjoys a period of market exclusivity, or monopoly, in which the company is able to set the price of the drug at a level that maximizes profit. This profit often greatly exceeds the development and production costs of the drug, allowing the company to offset the cost of research and development of other drugs that are not profitable or do not pass clinical trials. The impact of loss of patent exclusivity on pharmaceutical products varies significantly across different product classes (e.g., biologics vs. small molecules), largely due to regulatory, legal and manufacturing hurdles associated with such products. Indeed, the greater degree of &#x27;brand-brand&#x27; competitive dynamics seen in the biologics and complex generics space allows manufacturers of originators to better protect market share following loss of patent exclusivity.

Large pharmaceutical companies often spend millions protecting their patents from generic competition. Apart from litigation, they may reformulate a drug or license a subsidiary (or another company) to sell generics under the original patent. Generics sold under license from the patent holder are known as authorized generics. Generic drugs are usually sold for significantly lower prices than their branded equivalents and at lower profit margins. One reason for this is that competition increases among producers when a drug is no longer protected by patents. Generic companies incur fewer costs in creating generic drugs—only the cost of manufacturing, without the costs of drug discovery and drug development—and are therefore able to maintain profitability at a lower price. The prices are often low enough for users in less-prosperous countries to afford them. Generic drug companies may also receive the benefit of the previous marketing efforts of the brand-name company, including advertising, presentations by drug representatives, and distribution of free samples. Many drugs introduced by generic manufacturers have already been on the market for a decade or more and may already be well known to patients and providers, although often under their branded name.

India is a leading country in the world&#x27;s generic drugs market, exporting US$20.0 billion worth of drugs in the 2019–20 (April–March) year. India exports generic drugs to the United States and the European Union. also the according to market research community the Global Generic Drugs Market was evaluated US$465.96 million in 2021 and is expected to rise with a CAGR of 5.5% from 2022- 2028 during the forecast period. In the United Kingdom, generic drug pricing is controlled by the government&#x27;s reimbursement rate. The price paid by pharmacists and doctors is determined mainly by the number of license holders, the sales value of the original brand, and the ease of manufacture. A typical price decay graph will show a &quot;scalloped&quot; curve, which usually starts at the brand-name price on the day of generic launch and then falls as competition intensifies. After some years, the graph typically flattens out at approximately 20% of the original brand price. In about 20% of cases, the price &quot;bounces&quot;: Some license holders withdraw from the market when the selling price dips below their cost of goods, and the price then rises for a while until the license holders re-enter the market with new stock. The NHS spent about £4.3 billion on generic medicines in 2016–17. In 2012, 84 percent of prescriptions in the US were filled with generic drugs, and in 2014, the use of generic drugs in the United States led to US$254 billion in health care savings.

In the mid-2010s the generics industry began transitioning to the end of an era of giant patent cliffs in the pharmaceutical industry; patented drugs with sales of around US$28 billion were set to come off patent in 2018, but in 2019 only about US$10 billion in revenue was set to open for competition, and less the next year. Companies in the industry have responded with consolidation or turning to try to generate new drugs. Most developed nations require generic drug manufacturers to prove that their formulations are bioequivalent to their brand-name counterparts. Bioequivalence does not mean generic drugs must be exactly the same as the brand-name product (&quot;pharmaceutical equivalent&quot;). Chemical differences may exist; a different salt or ester may be used, for instance. Different inactive ingredients means that the generic may look different from the originator brand; however, the therapeutic effect of the drug must be the same (&quot;pharmaceutical alternative&quot;). Most small molecule drugs are accepted as bioequivalent if their pharmacokinetic parameters of area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) are within a 90% confidence interval of 80–125%; most approved generics in the US are well within this limit. For more complex products—such as inhalers, patch delivery systems, liposomal preparations, or biosimilar drugs—demonstrating pharmacodynamic or clinical equivalence is more challenging.

===United States===
Enacted in 1984, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, informally known as the Hatch–Waxman Act, standardized procedures for recognition of generic drugs. In 2007, the FDA launched the Generic Initiative for Value and Efficiency (GIVE): an effort to modernize and streamline the generic drug approval process, and to increase the number and variety of generic products available.

Before a company can market a generic drug, it needs to file an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) with the Food and Drug Administration, seeking to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence to a previously approved &quot;reference-listed drug&quot; and proving that it can manufacture the drug safely and consistently. For an ANDA to be approved, the FDA requires that the 90% confidence interval of the geometric mean test/reference ratios for the total drug exposure (represented by the area under the curve or AUC) and the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) should fall within limits of 80–125%. (This range is part of a statistical calculation, and does not mean that generic drugs are allowed to differ from their brand-name counterparts by up to 25 percent.) The FDA evaluated 2,070 studies conducted between 1996 and 2007 that compared the absorption of brand-name and generic drugs into a person&#x27;s body. The average difference in absorption between the generic and the brand-name drug was 3.5 percent, comparable to the difference between two batches of a brand-name drug. Non-innovator versions of biologic drugs, or biosimilars, require clinical trials for immunogenicity in addition to tests establishing bioequivalency. These products cannot be entirely identical because of batch-to-batch variability and their biological nature, and they are subject to extra rules.

When an application is approved, the FDA adds the generic drug to its Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations list and annotates the list to show the equivalence between the reference-listed drug and the generic. The FDA also recognizes drugs that use the same ingredients with different bioavailability and divides them into therapeutic equivalence groups. For example, as of 2006, diltiazem hydrochloride had four equivalence groups, all using the same active ingredient, but considered equivalent only within each group.

In order to start selling a drug promptly after the patent on innovator drug expires, a generic company has to file its ANDA well before the patent expires. This puts the generic company at risk of being sued for patent infringement, since the act of filing the ANDA is considered &quot;constructive infringement&quot; of the patent. In order to incentivize generic companies to take that risk the Hatch-Waxman act granted a 180-day administrative exclusivity period to generic drug manufacturers who are the first to file an ANDA.

When faced with patent litigation from the drug innovator or patent holder, generic companies will often counter-sue, challenging the validity of the patent. Like any litigation between private parties, the innovator and generic companies may choose to settle the litigation. Some of these settlement agreements have been struck down by courts when they took the form of reverse payment patent settlement agreements, in which the generic company basically accepts a payment to drop the litigation, delaying the introduction of the generic product and frustrating the purpose of the Hatch–Waxman Act.

Innovator companies sometimes try to maintain some of the revenue from their drug after patents expire by allowing another company to sell an authorized generic; a 2011 FTC report found that consumers benefitted from lower costs when an authorized generic was introduced during the 180 day exclusivity period, as it created competition. Innovator companies may also present arguments to the FDA that the ANDA should not be accepted by filing an FDA citizen petition. The right of individuals or organizations to petition the federal government is guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. For this reason, the FDA has promulgated regulations that provide, among other things, that at any time, any &quot;interested person&quot; can request that the FDA &quot;issue, amend, or revoke a regulation or order,&quot; and set forth a procedure for doing so.

====Acceptance====
Some generic drugs are viewed with suspicion by doctors. For example, warfarin (Coumadin) has a narrow therapeutic window and requires frequent blood tests to make sure patients do not have a subtherapeutic or a toxic level. A study performed in Ontario showed that replacing Coumadin with generic warfarin was safe, but many physicians are not comfortable with their patients taking branded generic equivalents. In some countries (for example, Australia) where a drug is prescribed under more than one brand name, doctors may choose not to allow pharmacists to substitute a brand different from the one prescribed unless the consumer requests it.

====Fraud====
A series of scandals around the approval of generic drugs in the late 1980s shook public confidence in generic drugs; there were several instances in which companies obtained bioequivalence data fraudulently, by using the branded drug in their tests instead of their own product, and a congressional investigation found corruption at the FDA, where employees were accepting bribes to approve some generic companies&#x27; applications and delaying or denying others.

In 2007, North Carolina Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;The People&#x27;s Pharmacy&quot; began reporting on consumers&#x27; complaints that generic versions of bupropion (Wellbutrin) were yielding unexpected effects. Subsequently, Impax Laboratories&#x27;s 300 mg extended-release tablets, marketed by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, were withdrawn from the US market after the FDA determined in 2012 that they were not bioequivalent.

Problems with the quality of generic drugs – especially those produced outside the United States – are widespread as of 2019. The FDA does infrequent – less than annual – inspections of production sites outside the United States. The FDA normally gives advance notice of inspections, which can lead to cover-ups of problems before inspectors arrive; inspections performed with little or no advance notice have produced evidence of serious problems at a majority of generic drug manufacturing sites in India and China.

====Litigation====
Two women, each claiming to have suffered severe medical complications from a generic version of metoclopramide, lost their Supreme Court appeal on June 23, 2011. In a 5–4 ruling in &quot;PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing&quot;, the court held that generic companies cannot be held liable for information, or the lack of information, on the originator&#x27;s label.

===India===
The Indian government began encouraging more drug manufacturing by Indian companies in the early 1960s, and with the Patents Act in 1970. The Patents Act removed composition patents for foods and drugs, and though it kept process patents, these were shortened to a period of five to seven years. The resulting lack of patent protection created a niche in both the Indian and global markets that Indian companies filled by reverse-engineering new processes for manufacturing low-cost drugs. The code of ethics issued by the Medical Council of India in 2002 calls for physicians to prescribe drugs by their generic names only. India is a leading country in the world&#x27;s generic drugs market, with Sun Pharmaceuticals being the largest pharmaceutical company in India. Indian generics companies exported US$17.3 billion worth of drugs in the 2017–18 (April–March) year. In 1945–2017, bioequivalence studies were only required for generics of drugs that are less than four years old. Since 2017, all generic drugs of certain classes, irrespective of age, require bioequivalence to be approved.

=== China ===

Generic drug production is a large part of the pharmaceutical industry in China. Western observers have said that China lacks administrative protection for patents. However, entry to the World Trade Organization has brought a stronger patent system. China remains the largest exporter of active pharmaceutical ingredients, accounting for 40% of the world market per a 2017 estimate.

Bioequivalence studies are required for new generic drugs starting from 2016, with older drugs planned as well. In addition, &quot;in vitro&quot; dissolution behavior is required to match. Since 2018, 44 classes of drugs are exempt from testing (requiring only a dissolution check), and 13 classes only require simplified testing.

== Industry ==
As of 2021, several major companies traditionally dominate the generic drugs market, including Viatris (merger of Mylan and Upjohn), Teva, Novartis&#x27; Sandoz, and Sun Pharma. Prices in traditional generic drugs have declined and newer companies such as India-based Sun Pharma, Aurobindo Pharma, and Dr. Reddy&#x27;s Laboratories, as well as Canada-based Apotex, have taken market share, which has led to a focus on biosimilars.

<text>The Bismarck Archipelago (, ) is a group of islands off the northeastern coast of New Guinea in the western Pacific Ocean and is part of the Islands Region of Papua New Guinea. Its area is about .

==History==
The first inhabitants of the archipelago arrived around 30,000–40,000 years ago. They may have traveled from New Guinea, by boat across the Bismarck Sea or via a temporary land bridge, created by an uplift in the Earth&#x27;s crust. Later arrivals included the Lapita people, the direct ancestors of the Austronesian peoples of Polynesia, eastern Micronesia, and Island Melanesia.

The first European to visit these islands was Dutch explorer Willem Schouten in 1616. The islands remained unsettled by western Europeans until they were annexed as part of the German protectorate of German New Guinea in 1884. The area was named in honour of the Chancellor Otto von Bismarck.

On 13 March 1888, a volcano erupted on Ritter Island causing a megatsunami. Almost the entire volcano fell into the ocean, leaving a small crater lake.

Following the outbreak of World War I, the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force seized the islands in 1914 and Australia later received a League of Nations mandate for the islands. They remained under Australian administration—interrupted only by Japanese occupation during World War II—until Papua New Guinea became independent in September 1975.

==Geography==
The Bismarck Archipelago includes mostly volcanic islands with a total land area of . The archipelago surrounds the Bismarck Sea and sits upon the North Bismarck Plate, the Manus Plate and the South Bismarck Plate.

<text>Whakaari / White Island (, , lit. &quot;the dramatic volcano&quot;), also known as White Island or Whakaari, is an active andesite stratovolcano situated from the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand, in the Bay of Plenty. The island covers an area of approximately , which is just the peak of a much larger submarine volcano.

The island is New Zealand&#x27;s most active cone volcano, and has been built up by continuous volcanic activity over the past 150,000 years. The nearest mainland towns are Whakatāne and Tauranga. The island has been in a nearly continuous stage of releasing volcanic gas at least since it was sighted by James Cook in 1769. Whakaari erupted continually from December 1975 until September 2000, and also erupted in 2012, 2016, and 2019.

Sulphur was mined on the island until the 1930s. Ten miners were killed in 1914 when part of the crater wall collapsed.

A large eruption occurred at 14:11 on 9 December 2019, which resulted in 22 fatalities, including two people who were missing and ruled to be dead by a coroner. Twenty-five survivors were injured, many critically and with severe burns. Forty-seven people were reportedly on the island when it erupted. A second eruption closely followed the first.

==Geography==
Whakaari / White Island is an irregular oval in shape, with a length (northwest–southeast) of and a width of , and covers an area of approximately . It lies in the Bay of Plenty from the North Island mainland, due north of the town of Ōpōtiki and north-northeast of Whakatāne. The island&#x27;s active crater lies slightly southeast of the island&#x27;s centre, and contains an acidic lake. The crater has a sharp rim to the northwest, with its highest point (also the island&#x27;s highest point) being the Mount Gisborne in the west. The Mount Percival forms the northern part of the rim. An older vent, the Mount Ngatoro, lies to the northwest. The exposed island is only the peak of a much larger submarine volcano, which rises up to above the nearby seafloor.

The island is generally rugged, with cliffs surrounding most of the coast. The only exceptions are to the southeast of the crater, where ash and boulder slopes descend to Te Awapuia Bay (also known as Crater Bay), the site of derelict buildings and the island&#x27;s wharf. This bay lies between a prominent headland, Troup Head, at the island&#x27;s southeastern extreme, and the island&#x27;s southernmost point, Otaketake, which is the site of one of the island&#x27;s gannet colonies. Another colony exists at Te Hokowhitu, the cliff which forms much of the western coast of the island.

Several rock reefs and islets are located along the island&#x27;s northeast coast, and there is also a rock reef at Troup Head. A small islet, Club Rocks, lies south of Otaketake Point. It consists of a set of four sea stacks rising to more than above sea level. In addition, four sea stacks collectively known as Te Paepae o Aotea or Volkner Rocks lie northwest of Whakaari / White Island. Three of these sea stacks rise precipitously from the sea floor (less than below sea level) to a maximum height of m above sea level. The fourth sea stack is just an eroded stump.

=== Climate ===

==Geology==
Whakaari / White Island is an andesite–dacite stratovolcano that consists of two overlapping volcanic cones, which are the Ngatoro and Central cones. The Ngatoro Cone is extinct and partially eroded. The amphitheatre-shaped Central Cone is an active cone. The crater of Central Cone is open to the southeast as the result of major, past flank landslides involving hydrothermally altered rock and past phreatic and phreatomagmatic eruptions. the Ngatoro Cone and Central cones are both constructed of alternating layers of lava flows, tuffs, agglomerates, tephra, igneous dikes, and breccias. Some of these strata have been altered to varying degrees by highly corrosive and acid hydrothermal fluids and gases.

The modern crater floor of Whakaari / White Island lies less than above sea level and is largely covered by material from the 1914 debris avalanche. The main crater contains three coalescing sub-craters. The sub-craters are aligned NW-SE within the amphitheatre-shaped Central Cone. The open sea breaches the south-eastern crater wall in three places to form Shark, Te Awapuia, and Wilson bays, which Troup Head and Pinnacle Head separate from each other. Long-lived, semi-continuous, weak, hydrothermal explosions, similar to those occurring in the Western sub-crater today, are regarded to have formed these three bays as hydrothermal explosion craters.

Whakaari / White Island and the sea stacks that form Club Rocks and Volckner Rocks are the emergent summits of a larger, , submarine volcano. It is known as &quot;White Island Volcano&quot; and has a total volume of . The bathymetry surrounding the emergent summit of Whakaari / White Island consists of a broad, sloping shelf extending from sea level to approximately depth. Steep margins define the extent of the submarine volcano at a depths of 

The amphitheatre-shaped crater of the modern Central Cone is argued to have been created by the collapse of the former cone of the White Island Volcano to the southwest. Based on extrapolating 20 m GIS contour data to enclose the present crater and upwards with a maximum slope angle of 30°, the former pre-collapse summit was inferred to have been high. Side-scan and bathymetric data indicate possible debris flows associated with its collapse that can be traced back to the current crater on White Island. One of these debris flows exited the crater on the southern side of Troup Head and towards the southeast. It produced well-defined boulder-covered lobes on the seafloor. Another debris flow exited the modern crater on the northern side of Troup Head and through several submarine valleys towards the east into deep water. It produced boulder-covered valley-fill deposits. The latter debris flow was large enough to have produced a significant tsunami. As a result of the collapse of the former cone of the White Island Volcano, it is suspected to have generated a high tsunami that flooded the coast of Bay of Plenty as much as inland between 3,000 and 2,200 B.P.

==Volcanology==

Whakaari / White Island lies in the northern end of the Taupō Volcanic Zone. The Taupō Volcanic Zone forms the southernmost segment of the -long Tonga–Kermadec–Taupō volcanic arc system and the Lau Basin–Havre Trough–Ngatoro Basin back-arc basin system.

===Geological history===

For the past few thousand years, Whakaari / White Island has been the location for an open, highly reactive hydrothermal system. This hydrothermal system expresses itself as hot springs and mud pools, fumaroles, and acid streams and lakes. The present centre for volcanic activity and outgassing is a large crater lake of boiling acidic waters located in the western subcrater. The intermixing mélange of marine waters, meteoric waters, and hot magmatic fluids generate acid brines, with pH as low as 2, that outgas and form numerous and often transitory hot springs and mud pools, fumaroles, and acid streams and lakes. The crater lake of boiling acidic water, which occupies the western subcrater, appears to vary in volume due to changing meteorological conditions and fluctuating levels of hydrothermal activity.

Although Strombolian activity occurred from the late seventies to the mid-eighties, explosive eruptions at Whakaari / White Island are typically phreatic or phreatomagmatic in style. The lava flows, ash, and pyroclastic flows produced by historic and prehistoric eruptions are andesitic and dacitic in composition. These eruptions also produce discrete craters within crater-fill deposits of the Central Cone. Since 1826, there has been a minimum of 28 phreatic or phreatomagmatic eruptions. In addition, prehistoric eruptions have also extruded lava. The lava flows from these prehistoric eruptions are exposed crater walls of the Central Cone. Whakaari / White Island&#x27;s frequent activity and easy access attract scientists and volcanologists as well as many tourists. For example, this volcano provides a readily studied example of the type of volcanic magmatic–hydrothermal system involved in the generation of porphyry copper deposits.
Volcanologists from the GeoNet Project continually monitor the volcano&#x27;s activity via surveillance cameras. Survey pegs, magnetometers and seismography equipment for early earthquake warnings via radio were installed on the crater walls in 1976. At most times the volcanic activity is limited to steaming fumaroles and boiling mud, but gas and ash emissions are common, and the island is typically on an alert level rating of 1 or 2 on a scale of 0 to 5; as &quot;Level 2 is the highest alert level before an eruption takes place and indicates &#x27;moderate to heightened volcanic unrest&#x27; with the &#x27;potential for eruption hazards.&#x27;&quot; The volcano is also monitored by the Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project.

In March 2000, three small vents appeared in the main crater and began belching ash which covered the island in fine grey powder. An eruption on 27 July 2000 blanketed the island with mud and scoria and a new crater appeared. Major eruptions in 1981–83 altered much of the island&#x27;s landscape and destroyed the extensive pōhutukawa forest. The large crater created at that time now contains a lake, whose level varies substantially.

Between July and August 2012 the island showed signs of increased activity with lake and gas levels rising from inside the crater. On 5 August 2012 a minor eruption occurred, sending ash into the air. More eruptions have followed since.

Ongoing volcanic activity and tremors on 25 January 2013 suggested another eruption was imminent. A small eruption occurred on 20 August 2013 at 10:23 am, lasting for ten minutes and producing mostly steam.

A minor eruption is ongoing as of 11 August 2024.&lt;ref name=&quot;10/8/24NZHerald&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The eruption has produced a weak plume with a low concentration of volcanic ash. As of January 2025, the volcano still emits weak to moderate gas and steam plumes on some days.

====2019 eruption====

In November 2019, background activity at Whakaari increased and gas, steam and mud was being ejected from the crater.
At 14:11 NZDT on 9 December 2019, Whakaari / White Island erupted. It was reported that there were forty-seven people on the island when the eruption happened. Twenty-two people were killed, including two people who are missing and confirmed dead on 23 January 2020, and a further twenty-five were seriously injured, many critically. The bodies of two victims have not been recovered and may have been lost to the sea. The ongoing seismic and volcanic activity in the area and subsequently heavy rainfall as well as low visibility and toxic gases all hampered recovery efforts.

Experts identified the event as a phreatic eruption: a release of steam and volcanic gases which caused an explosion, launching rock and ash into the air. Minor ash emissions were observed on 23 and 26 December, but no further eruptions occurred. Visual observations conducted in January showed that lava had been extruded into the vents created by the eruption on 9 December.

==History==
===Name===
The Māori name Whakaari is recorded in multiple 19th century texts by Europeans, with one mention dating back to 1849, though spelling varied including Wakaari, Whakari, and Whaka ari. The name Whakaari means &quot;to make visible&quot; or &quot;exposed to view&quot;. The full Māori name for the island is , meaning &quot;The Dramatic Volcano&quot;.

Whakaari was named &quot;White Island&quot; by Captain Cook on 1 November 1769. Cook noted in his journal, &quot;I have named it White Island because as such it always appeared to us&quot;. According to LINZ this name came from the dense clouds of white steam emanating from it. Alternatively, he may have been alluding to the guano deposits that once covered the island. Although Cook sailed close to the island, he did not record that it was a volcano.

The island&#x27;s official name was changed from &quot;White Island (Whakaari)&quot; to &quot;Whakaari / White Island&quot; in 1997. This makes it one of many places in New Zealand with dual Māori and English names.

===Mythology===
Some Māori myths describe Whakaari as part of Ngātoro-i-rangi&#x27;s ascent of Tongariro. In one account, he called on his ancestors for warmth; the fire was kindled on Whakaari and brought to him. Other versions of this story are similar but it is his sisters, or the gods, who send him warmth from Whakaari.

Other stories give origin stories for the island. One states that it rose from the deep after the god Māui, having first touched fire was so greatly tortured by the pain that he instantly dived under water to calm his pain; and in the place where he shook the fire from him arose Whakaari. Another tells that Moutohora Island and Whakaari / White Island were peaks in the Huiarau Range near Waikaremoana but were jealous of each other, and rushed towards the ocean, leaving behind them the tracks that now form the Whakatane valley and either the Tauranga or Te Waimana valley. Whakaari was faster, so got to the better position where it stands today.

===Industry===

Attempts were made in the mid-1880s, again from 1898 to 1901, and then from 1913 to 1914, to mine sulphur from Whakaari / White Island, with the island at first being owned by John Wilson. Mining came to a halt in September 1914, when part of the western crater rim collapsed, creating a lahar that killed all 10 workers, who disappeared without a trace. Only a camp cat survived, found some days afterwards by the resupply ship and dubbed &quot;Peter the Great&quot;.

In 1923, mining was again attempted but, learning from the 1914 disaster, the miners built their huts on a flat part of the island near a gannet colony. Each day they would lower their boat into the sea from a gantry, and row around to the mining factory wharf in Crater Bay. If the sea was rough they had to clamber around the rocks on a very narrow track on the crater&#x27;s edge.

Before the days of antibiotics, sulphur was used as an antibacterial agent in medicines, in the making of match-heads, and for sterilising wine corks. The sulphur was hauled to the crushing plant in small rail trucks, and a bagging facility was also constructed. However, there was not enough sulphur in the material mined at the island, so the ground-up rock was used as a component of agricultural fertiliser. Mining ended in the 1930s, because of the inadequate mineral content in the fertiliser. The remains of the buildings involved can still be seen, heavily corroded by the sulphuric gases.

===Ownership===
The ownership of Whakaari / White Island was one of the first two cases heard by the Native Land Court of New Zealand (now called the Māori Land Court), the other being ownership of nearby Motuhora. Retireti Tapihana (Tapsell) brought the case in 1867, claiming ownership. Retireti was the son of Phillip Tapsell and Hine-i-tūrama Ngātiki. Ownership was awarded jointly to Retireti Tapihana and his sister Katherine Simpkins.

In 1874, the island was sold to the partnership John Wilson and William Kelly by the estate of Retireti Tapihana (Tapsell). Wilson and Kelly subsequently leased it to the Auckland-based partnership of Stewart and Appleby, but after the conditions of the lease were unfulfilled, it was put up for lease again.

The island is now privately owned by the Buttle family trust, having been bought by George Raymond Buttle, a stockbroker, in 1936. Buttle later refused to sell it to the government, but agreed in 1952 that it be declared a private scenic reserve. In 2012, the island&#x27;s title was transferred to the Whakaari Trust, whose shareholders are Peter, Andrew and James Buttle.

==Local government==
The island is not included in the boundaries of a territorial authority council (district council) and the Minister of Local Government is its territorial authority, with support from the Department of Internal Affairs. The functions of the territorial authority are limited, as the island is uninhabited, the land is undeveloped and it is privately owned. The island is within the boundaries of the Bay of Plenty Regional Council for regional council functions.

==Natural life==
Whakaari / White Island is one of New Zealand&#x27;s main breeding colonies for Australasian gannets. Thousands of gannets come to the island each year to mate, raise chicks, and feed on the fish in the water around it. There is little vegetation on the island itself, but seaweed grows in the waters around it and gannet parents harvest it to cool off chicks. An ornithologist who visited in 1912 found five species and identified four; in addition to gannets they found red-billed gulls, great-winged petrels, and white-fronted terns.

BirdLife International has declared the island to be an Important Bird Area because of the gannets&#x27; nesting colony.

==Access==
Whakaari / White Island is privately owned. It was declared a private scenic reserve in 1953, and is subject to the provisions of the Reserves Act 1977. Visitors cannot land without permission. However, it is easily accessible by authorised tourist operators.

The waters surrounding the island are well known for their fish stocks. Yellowtail kingfish abound all year, while there is deep-water fishing for hapuka and bluenose (a type of warehou) in the winter. In the summer, blue, black and striped marlin, as well as yellowfin tuna can be caught. A small charter fleet, offering day trips and overnight or longer trips, operates from the nearby port at Whakatāne.

On-land tours of the island have not been operating since the 2019 eruption.

<doc id="293913" wikidata="Q513118" url="?curid=293913" title="Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford">
<text>Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford (1176 – 1 June 1220) of Pleshey Castle in Essex, was an Anglo-Norman nobleman who became Hereditary Constable of England from 1199.

==Origins==
Henry was the son and heir of Humphrey III de Bohun and Margaret of Huntingdon, daughter of Henry of Scotland. His father was lord of Trowbridge Castle in Wiltshire and Caldicot Castle in south-east Wales, and was the 5th feudal baron of Trowbridge. His father served King Henry II as Lord High Constable of England. Henry had a half-sister, Constance, Duchess of Brittany.

== Earldom ==
His paternal grandmother was Margaret of Hereford, a daughter of Miles FitzWalter of Gloucester, 1st Earl of Hereford, Lord of Brecknock (died 1143), Sheriff of Gloucester and Constable of England. After the male line of Miles of Gloucester failed, in 1200 King John created Henry de Bohun Earl of Hereford and Constable of England. His lands lay chiefly on the Welsh Marches, and from this date the Bohuns took a foremost place among the Marcher barons.

In 1212, Henry was in a legal dispute with William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury, over Trowbridge. With the dispute having dragged on, Henry attempted to cite illness as a justification for missing the hearing in June 1213. In response, Trowbridge was relinquished to the Crown. Henry was one of the twenty-five barons elected by their peers to enforce the terms of Magna Carta in 1215, and was subsequently excommunicated by the Pope.

In September 1215, Henry went with Saer de Quincy, Earl of Winchester and Robert Fitzwalter to France. In a meeting with Prince Louis, Henry, Saer, and Robert swore fealty to Louis and offered him the crown on the condition that he conquer England. In the civil war that followed Magna Carta, he was a supporter of King Louis VIII of France and was captured at the Battle of Lincoln in 1217.

==Marriage and issue==
Henry married Maud de Mandeville, daughter and heiress of Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex, of Pleshey Castle in Essex, by whom he had issue including:
*Humphrey IV de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford, 1st Earl of Essex (1204–1275), eldest son and heir, created Earl of Essex in 1239, who married Maud de Lusignan, by whom he had at least three children.
*Henry de Bohun, who died young.
*Ralph de Bohun.

==Death==
Henry died in June 1220 while on crusade to the Holy Land.

<text>William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton, KG (c. 1312 – 16 September 1360) was an English nobleman and military commander.

==Lineage==
He was the fifth son of Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford and Elizabeth of Rhuddlan. He had a twin brother, Edward. His maternal grandparents were Edward I of England and his first wife, Queen consort Eleanor of Castile.

==Life==
William de Bohun assisted at the arrest of Roger Mortimer in 1330, allowing Edward III to take power. After this, he was a trusted friend and commander of the king and he participated in the renewed wars with Scotland.

In 1332, he received many new properties: Hinton and Spaine in Berkshire; Great Haseley, Ascott, Deddington, Pyrton and Kirtlington in Oxfordshire; Wincomb in Buckinghamshire; Longbenington in Lincolnshire; Kneesol in Nottinghamshire; Newnsham in Gloucestershire, Wix in Essex, and Bosham in Sussex.

In 1335, he married Elizabeth de Badlesmere (1313 – 8 June 1356). Her parents Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere, and Margaret de Clare had both turned against Edward II the decade before. Elizabeth and William were granted some of the property of Elizabeth&#x27;s first husband, who had also been Mortimer&#x27;s son and heir.

William was created Earl of Northampton in 1337, one of the six earls created by Edward III to renew the ranks of the higher nobility. Since de Bohun was a younger son, and did not have an income suitable to his rank, he was given an annuity until suitable estates could be found.

In 1349 he became a Knight of the Garter. He served as High Sheriff of Rutland from 1349 until his death in 1360.

==Campaigns in Flanders, Brittany, Scotland, Sluys and Crecy==
In 1339 he accompanied the King to Flanders. He served variously in Brittany and in Scotland, and was present at the great English victories at Sluys and Crécy, the latter as a commander. His most stunning feat was leading an English force to victory against a much bigger French force at the Battle of Morlaix in 1342. Some of the details are in dispute, but it is clear that he made good use of pit traps, which stopped the French cavalry.

==Diplomat==
In addition to being a warrior, William was also a renowned diplomat. He negotiated two treaties with France, one in 1343 and one in 1350. He was also charged with negotiating in Scotland for the freedom of King David Bruce, King of Scots, who was held prisoner by the English.

==Senior naval command==
From the 8 March 1352 to 5 March 1355 he was appointed Admiral of the Northern Seas, Fleet.

==Issue==
1. Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford (1341–1373)
2. Elizabeth de Bohun (c. 1350–1385); married Richard FitzAlan, 4th Earl of Arundel

==In historical fiction==
In Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s series The Grail Quest, the Earl of Northampton plays a minor role as protagonist Thomas of Hookton&#x27;s lord. The Earl of Northampton is also a major character in Dan Jones&#x27; debut novel &quot;Essex Dogs&quot; and it&#x27;s sequel &quot;Wolves of Winter&quot;.
