<text>Man About the House is a British sitcom created by Brian Cooke and Johnnie Mortimer. It starred Richard O&#x27;Sullivan, Paula Wilcox, Sally Thomsett, Yootha Joyce and Brian Murphy. Six series were broadcast on ITV from 15 August 1973 to 7 April 1976. The series was considered daring at the time because it featured a man sharing a London flat with two single women. The show was made by Thames Television and recorded at its Teddington Studios in Greater London. It is regularly repeated on ITV3.

Two spin-off series were later made: &quot;George and Mildred&quot; and &quot;Robin&#x27;s Nest&quot;. A film version was released in 1974 and the series was remade in the United States as &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; in 1977. &quot;Man About the House&quot; placed 69th in a 2004 poll to find &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;.

==Plot==
Chrissy and Jo live in a London flat together and work for the same firm. The women find a stranger, student chef Robin Tripp, asleep in their bath the morning after the farewell party for their departed flatmate Eleanor. When he meets the two girls, Robin has been in London two days, having moved from Southampton to attend university. The girls are unimpressed with Gabrielle (Helen Fraser) as a potential replacement for Eleanor, but they are impressed by Robin&#x27;s culinary skills, as they cannot cook at all. Learning that Robin has been staying at the YMCA, they convince him to move in, on the understanding that it will be a platonic relationship.

Chrissy tells landlord George Roper that Robin is gay to eliminate George&#x27;s objections to the mixed-sex living arrangement. George, in truth a subletting landlord placed by the council, is a miserly, spiteful and unkempt man under the thumb of his domineering and sexually frustrated wife Mildred.

In the second episode, Robin&#x27;s true sexuality becomes known to Mildred. She takes out her frustrations with George&#x27;s lack of class and sexual inadequacy by making suggestive remarks to Robin and frequently siding with the tenants against George. Mildred openly flirts with Robin, and Robin frequently flirts with Chrissy and Jo. The girls, adhering to their pledge to maintain a platonic relationship with Robin, spurn his mild advances and adapt to his presence in the flat. Chrissy occasionally shows attraction to Robin, but the two never pursue any romantic interaction.

Robin&#x27;s friend Larry, a lovable rogue, appears on a recurring basis throughout the series. In the third series, he moves into the loft apartment above the trio&#x27;s apartment and is a frequent source of trouble. Another occasional cast member is George&#x27;s friend, the dodgy builder Jerry (Roy Kinnear). Jerry is the only supporting character to reappear in the spin-off &quot;George and Mildred&quot;.

Robin&#x27;s brother Norman Tripp (Norman Eshley) appears in the final three episodes of the sixth and final series, and starts a romance with Chrissy. The series ends with Norman and Chrissy marrying. Eshley had a previous guest role in the episode &quot;In Praise of Older Men&quot; (Series 2, Episode 3), and would subsequently appear as another character, the Ropers&#x27; neighbour, in &quot;George and Mildred&quot;. 

==Episodes==
First airing on 15 August 1973, &quot;Man About the House&quot; ran until 7 April 1976, spanning 39 episodes in six series. In addition, on Christmas Day 1973, a short special aired as part of &quot;All-star Comedy Carnival&quot;.

==Theme music==
Written by Johnny Hawksworth and entitled &quot;Up to Date&quot;, the theme song was not specially commissioned for the show, but rather was provided via the production music company De Wolfe Music. It also appeared on the 1996 compilation CD &quot;The Sound Gallery – Volume Two&quot;, but credited to the Simon Park Orchestra.

==Film==
A 1974 film version of the show starred all of the main cast members. It was the last in a series of movie screen adaptations of popular TV shows made by Hammer Films, though a &quot;George and Mildred&quot; film (featuring Yootha Joyce and Brian Murphy) would be made in 1980 by another studio.

==Spin-offs and remakes==

After the series ended in 1976, two successful spin-off series followed:

* &quot;George and Mildred&quot;, in which the Ropers move to the suburbs.
* &quot;Robin&#x27;s Nest&quot;, in which Robin gets married and opens a bistro.

The format of &quot;Man About the House&quot; was sold internationally, and it was remade in the United States as &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; in 1976; in the Netherlands as &quot;Sam Sam&quot; in 1994; in Sweden as &quot;En fyra för tre&quot; in 1996; in Norway as &quot;Tre på toppen&quot; in 1997; in Portugal as &quot;Não Há Duas Sem Três&quot; in 1997; in Poland as &quot;Lokatorzy&quot; in 2000; in Russia as &quot;Troe sverhy&quot; in 2006; in Ecuador as &quot;El hombre de la casa&quot; and in Chile as &quot;Tres son multitud&quot;, both in 2007.

The American &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; adaptation also spawned the same spin-offs as had &quot;Man About the House:&quot; &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot; (based on &quot;Robin&#x27;s Nest&quot;) and &quot;The Ropers&quot; (based upon &quot;George and Mildred).&quot;

Two and a half decades after the original ended, there were plans for &quot;Man About the House&quot; to return to British TV screens in the early 2000s with a new cast consisting of Johnny Vaughan, Amanda Holden and Jane Wall as the new main stars of the show, but those plans were scrapped before getting past the pre-planning stage.

==Home media==
All six series have been released on DVD in the UK by Network DVD, as have &quot;George and Mildred&quot; and &quot;Robin&#x27;s Nest&quot;.

Series 1 and 2 have had a US release as part of a two-disc set by FremantleMedia.

Series 1 and 2 were released in Australia in 2004, but a delay was encountered in releasing further series because of contract renegotiations (the same problem affected releases of &quot;George and Mildred&quot; and &quot;Bless This House&quot;). Series 3 was finally released on 16 July 2008, and Series 4 on 5 November 2008. Series 5 and 6 are yet to be released. Series 1 was re-released on 2 April 2009, now with the same cover art as the UK edition. Fremantle Media re-released series 1 on 3 March 2011 with new cover art. Re-releases have continued with Series 2 on 3 October 2012, Series 3 on 1 May 2013, and Series 4 on 1 May 2013. Series 5 and Series 6 finally received a release on 7 August 2013. Via Vision Entertainment announced &quot;The Complete Series&quot; will be released on October 21, 2020, which will be the first time this series will be released as a collection.

In 2019, a 19-disc DVD set (Region 2) was issued by Network/Fremantle containing every episode of &quot;Man About the House&quot;, &quot;George and Mildred&quot; and &quot;Robin&#x27;s Nest&quot;.

<doc id="294989" wikidata="Q1076457" url="?curid=294989" title="Spark gap">
<text>A spark gap consists of an arrangement of two conducting electrodes separated by a gap usually filled with a gas such as air, designed to allow an electric spark to pass between the conductors. When the potential difference between the conductors exceeds the breakdown voltage of the gas within the gap, a spark forms, ionizing the gas and drastically reducing its electrical resistance. An electric current then flows until the path of ionized gas is broken or the current reduces below a minimum value called the &quot;holding current&quot;. This usually happens when the voltage drops, but in some cases occurs when the heated gas rises, stretching out and then breaking the of ionized gas. Usually, the action of ionizing the gas is violent and disruptive, often leading to sound (ranging from a &quot;snap&quot; for a spark plug to thunder for a lightning discharge), light, and heat.

Spark gaps were used historically in early electrical equipment, such as spark gap radio transmitters, electrostatic machines, and X-ray machines. Their most widespread use today is in spark plugs to ignite the fuel in internal combustion engines, but they are also used in lightning arresters and other devices to protect electrical equipment from high-voltage transients.

==Breakdown voltage==
For air, the breakdown strength is about 30 kV/cm at sea level.

==Spark visibility==
The light emitted by a spark does not come from the current of electrons itself, but from the material medium fluorescing in response to collisions from the electrons. When electrons collide with molecules of air in the gap, they excite their orbital electrons to higher energy levels. When these excited electrons fall back to their original energy levels, they emit energy as light. It is impossible for a visible spark to form in a vacuum. Without intervening matter capable of electromagnetic transitions, the spark will be invisible (see vacuum arc).

==Applications==
Spark gaps are essential to the functioning of a number of electronic devices.

===Ignition devices===
A spark plug uses a spark gap to initiate combustion. The heat of the ionization trail, but more importantly, UV radiation and hot free electrons (both cause the formation of reactive free radicals) ignite a fuel-air mixture inside an internal combustion engine, or a burner in a furnace, oven, or stove. The more UV radiation is produced and successfully spread into the combustion chamber, the further the combustion process proceeds.

The Space Shuttle Main Engine hydrogen oxygen propellant mixture was ignited with a spark igniter.

===Protective devices===
Spark gaps are frequently used to prevent voltage surges from damaging equipment. Spark gaps are used in high-voltage switches, large power transformers, in power plants and electrical substations. Such switches are constructed with a large, remote-operated switching blade with a hinge as one contact and two leaf springs holding the other end as second contact. If the blade is opened, a spark may keep the connection between blade and spring conducting. The spark ionizes the air, which becomes conductive and allows an arc to form, which sustains ionization and hence conduction. A Jacob&#x27;s ladder on top of the switch will cause the arc to rise and eventually extinguish. One might also find small Jacob&#x27;s ladders mounted on top of ceramic insulators of high-voltage pylons. These are sometimes called horn gaps. If a spark should ever manage to jump over the insulator and give rise to an arc, it will be extinguished.

Smaller spark gaps are often used to protect sensitive electrical or electronic equipment from high-voltage surges. In sophisticated versions of these devices (called gas tube arresters), a small spark gap breaks down during an abnormal voltage surge, safely shunting the surge to ground and thereby protecting the equipment. These devices are commonly used for telephone lines as they enter a building; the spark gaps help protect the building and internal telephone circuits from the effects of lightning strikes. Less sophisticated (and much less expensive) spark gaps are made using modified ceramic capacitors; in these devices, the spark gap is simply an air gap sawn between the two lead wires that connect the capacitor to the circuit. A voltage surge causes a spark that jumps from lead wire to lead wire across the gap left by the sawing process. These low-cost devices are often used to prevent damaging arcs between the elements of the electron gun(s) within a cathode-ray tube (CRT).

Small spark gaps are very common in telephone switchboards, as the long phone cables are very susceptible to induced surges from lightning strikes. Larger spark gaps are used to protect power lines.

Spark gaps are sometimes implemented on Printed Circuit Boards in electronics products using two closely spaced exposed PCB traces. This is an effectively zero cost method of adding crude over-voltage protection to electronics products.

Transils and trisils are the solid-state alternatives to spark gaps for lower-power applications. Neon bulbs are also used for this purpose.

===High speed photography===
A triggered spark gap in an air-gap flash is used to produce photographic light flashes in the sub-microsecond domain.

===Radio transmitters===
A spark radiates energy throughout the electromagnetic spectrum. Nowadays, this is usually regarded as illegal radio frequency interference and is suppressed, but in the early days of radio communications (1880–1920), this was the means by which radio signals were transmitted, in the unmodulated spark-gap transmitter. Many radio spark gaps include cooling devices, such as the rotary gap and heat sinks, since the spark gap becomes quite hot under continuous use at high power.

===Sphere gap for voltage measurement===
A calibrated spherical spark gap will break down at a highly repeatable voltage, when corrected for air pressure, humidity and temperature. A gap between two spheres can provide a voltage measurement without any electronics or voltage dividers, to an accuracy of about 3%. A spark gap can be used to measure high voltage AC, DC, or pulses, but for very short pulses, an ultraviolet light source or radioactive source may be put on one of the terminals to provide a source of electrons.

===Power-switching devices===
Spark gaps may be used as electrical switches because they have two states with significantly different electrical resistance. Resistance between the electrodes may be as high as 10 ohms when the electrodes are separated by gas or vacuum which means that little current flows even when a high voltage exists between the electrodes. Resistance drops as low as a 10 ohms low when the electrodes are connected by plasma which means that power dissipation is low even at high current. This combination of properties has led to the use of spark gaps as electrical switches in pulsed power applications where energy is stored at high voltage in a capacitor and then discharged at high current. Examples include pulsed lasers, railguns, Marx generators, fusion, ultrastrong pulsed magnetic field research, and nuclear bomb triggering.

When a spark gap consists of only two electrodes separated by gas, the transition between the non-conducting and conducting states is governed by Paschen&#x27;s law. At typical pressure and electrode distance combinations, Paschen&#x27;s law says that Townsend discharge will fill the gap between the electrodes with conductive plasma whenever the ratio of the electric field strength to the pressure exceeds a constant value determined by the composition of the gas. The speed with which pressure can be reduced is limited by choked flow, while increasing the electric field in a capacitor discharge circuit is limited by the capacitance in the circuit and the current available for charging the capacitance. These limitations on the speed with which discharge may be initiated mean that spark gaps with two electrodes typically have high jitter.
Triggered spark gaps are a class of devices with some additional means of triggering to achieve low jitter. Most commonly, this is a third electrode, as in a trigatron. The voltage of the trigger electrode can be changed quickly because the capacitance between it and the other electrodes is small. In a triggered spark gap, gas pressure is optimized to minimize jitter while also avoiding unintentional triggering. Triggered spark gaps are made in permanently sealed versions with limited voltage range and in user-pressurized versions with voltage range proportional to the available pressure range. Triggered spark gaps share many similarities with other gas-filled tubes such as thyratrons, krytrons, ignitrons, and crossatrons.

Triggered vacuum gaps, or sprytrons, resemble triggered spark gaps both in appearance and construction but rely on a different operating principle. A triggered vacuum gap consists of three electrodes in an airtight glass or ceramic envelope that has been evacuated. This means that, unlike a triggered spark gap, a triggered vacuum gap operates in the parameter space to the left of the Paschen minimum where breakdown is promoted by increasing pressure. Current between the electrodes is limited to a small value by field emission in the non-conducting state. Breakdown is initiated by rapidly evaporating material from a trigger electrode or an adjacent resistive coating. Once the vacuum arc is initiated, a triggered vacuum gap is filled with conductive plasma as in any other spark gap. A triggered vacuum gap has a larger operating voltage range than a sealed triggered spark gap because Paschen curves are much steeper to the left of the Paschen minimum than at higher pressures. Triggered vacuum gaps are also rad hard because in the non-conducting state they do not contain any gas that could be ionized by radiation.
===Insect control===

They are also used as insect zappers. The two electrodes are implemented as metal lattices placed a slightly too far apart for the voltage to jump. When an insect ventures between the electrodes the gap distance is reduced by the insects body, being conductive, and a spark discharge occurs to electrocute and burn the insect.

In this use the spark gap mechanism is often used in conjunction with a bait, such as a light, to attract the insect into the spark gap.

<text>Capgras delusion or Capgras syndrome is a psychiatric disorder in which a person holds a delusion that a friend, spouse, parent, other close family member, or pet has been replaced by an identical impostor. It is named after Joseph Capgras (1873–1950), the French psychiatrist who first described the disorder.

The Capgras delusion is classified as a delusional misidentification syndrome, a class of beliefs that involves the misidentification of people, places, or objects. It can occur in acute, transient, or chronic forms. Cases in which patients hold the belief that time has been &quot;warped&quot; or &quot;substituted&quot; have also been reported.

The delusion most commonly occurs in individuals diagnosed with a psychotic disorder, usually schizophrenia, but has also been seen in brain injury, dementia with Lewy bodies, and other forms of dementia. It presents often in individuals with a neurodegenerative disease, particularly at an older age; it has also been reported as occurring in association with diabetes, hypothyroidism, and migraine attacks. In one isolated case, the Capgras delusion was temporarily induced in a healthy subject by administration of ketamine. It occurs more frequently in females, with a female to male ratio of approximately .

==History==
Capgras syndrome is named after Joseph Capgras, a French psychiatrist who first described the disorder in 1923 in his paper co-authored by Jean Reboul-Lachaux. They described the case of a French woman, &quot;Madame Macabre,&quot; who complained that corresponding &quot;doubles&quot; had taken the places of her husband and other people she knew. Capgras and Reboul-Lachaux first called the syndrome &quot;l&#x27;illusion des sosies&quot;, which can be translated literally as &quot;the illusion of Doppelgänger.&quot;

The syndrome was initially considered a purely psychiatric disorder, the delusion of a double seen as symptomatic of schizophrenia, and purely a female disorder (though this is now known not to be the case) often noted as a symptom of hysteria. Most of the proposed explanations initially following that of Capgras and Reboul-Lachaux were psychoanalytical in nature. It was not until the 1980s that attention turned to the usually co-existing organic brain lesions originally thought to be essentially unrelated or coincidental. Today, the Capgras syndrome is understood as a neurological disorder, in which the delusion primarily results from organic brain lesions or degeneration.

==Signs and symptoms==
Compared to other delusional misidentification syndromes, like the Fregoli delusion, the Capgras delusion is more widely documented. The following three case reports are examples of the Capgras delusion in a psychiatric setting:


The following case is an instance of the Capgras delusion resulting from a neurodegenerative disease:

==Causes==
It is generally agreed that the Capgras delusion has a complex and organic basis caused by structural damage to organs and can be better understood by examining neuroanatomical damage associated with the syndrome.

In one of the first papers to consider the cerebral basis of the Capgras delusion, Alexander, Stuss and Benson pointed out in 1979 that the disorder might be related to a combination of frontal lobe damage causing problems with familiarity and right hemisphere damage causing problems with visual recognition.

Further clues to the possible causes of the Capgras delusion were suggested by the study of brain-injured patients who had developed prosopagnosia. In this condition, patients are unable to recognize faces consciously, despite being able to recognize other types of visual objects. However, a 1984 study by Bauer showed that even though conscious face recognition was impaired, patients with the condition showed autonomic arousal (measured by a galvanic skin response measure) to familiar faces, suggesting there are two pathways to face recognition—one conscious and one unconscious.

In a 1990 paper published in the &quot;British Journal of Psychiatry&quot;, psychologists Hadyn Ellis and Andy Young hypothesized that patients with Capgras delusion may have a &quot;mirror image&quot; or double dissociation of prosopagnosia, in that their conscious ability to recognize faces was intact, but they might have damage to the system which produces the automatic emotional arousal to familiar faces. This might lead to the experience of recognizing someone while feeling something was not &quot;quite right&quot; about them. In 1997, Ellis and his colleagues published a study of five patients with Capgras delusion (all diagnosed with schizophrenia) and confirmed that although they could consciously recognize the faces, they did not show the normal automatic emotional arousal response. The same low level of autonomic response was shown in the presence of strangers. Young (2008) has theorized that this means that patients with the disease experience a &quot;loss&quot; of familiarity, not a &quot;lack&quot; of it. Further evidence for this explanation comes from other studies measuring galvanic skin responses (GSR) to faces. A patient with Capgras delusion showed reduced GSRs to faces in spite of normal face recognition. This theory for the causes of Capgras delusion was summarised in &quot;Trends in Cognitive Sciences&quot; in 2001.

William Hirstein and Vilayanur S. Ramachandran reported similar findings in a paper published on a single case of a patient with Capgras delusion after brain injury. Ramachandran portrayed this case in his book &quot;Phantoms in the Brain&quot; and gave a talk about it at TED 2007. Since the patient was capable of feeling emotions and recognizing faces but could not feel emotions when recognizing familiar faces, Ramachandran hypothesizes the origin of Capgras syndrome is a disconnection between the temporal cortex, where faces are usually recognized (see temporal lobe), and the limbic system, involved in emotions. More specifically, he emphasizes the disconnection between the amygdala and the inferotemporal cortex.

In 2010, Hirstein revised this theory to explain why a person with Capgras syndrome would have the particular reaction of not recognizing a familiar person. Hirstein explained the theory as being &quot;a more specific version of the earlier position I took in the 1997 article with V. S. Ramachandran,&quot; and elaborated:

Furthermore, Ramachandran suggests a relationship between the Capgras syndrome and a more general difficulty in linking successive episodic memories because of the crucial role emotion plays in creating memories. Since the patient could not put together memories and feelings, he believed objects in a photograph were new on every viewing, even though they normally should have evoked feelings (e.g., a person close to him, a familiar object, or even himself). Others like Merrin and Silberfarb (1976) have also proposed links between the Capgras syndrome and deficits in aspects of memory. They suggest that an important and familiar person (the usual subject of the delusion) has many layers of visual, auditory, tactile, and experiential memories associated with them, so the Capgras delusion can be understood as a failure of object constancy at a high perceptual level.

Most likely, more than a mere impairment of the automatic emotional arousal response is necessary to form the Capgras delusion, as the same pattern has been reported in patients showing no signs of delusions. Ellis suggested that a second factor explains why this unusual experience is transformed into a delusional belief; this second factor is thought to be an impairment in reasoning, although no specific impairment has been found to explain all cases. Many have argued for the inclusion of the role of patient phenomenology in explanatory models of the Capgras syndrome in order to better understand the mechanisms that enable the creation and maintenance of delusional beliefs.

Capgras syndrome has also been linked to reduplicative paramnesia, another delusional misidentification syndrome in which a person believes a location has been duplicated or relocated. Since these two syndromes are highly associated, it has been proposed that they affect similar areas of the brain and therefore have similar neurological implications. Reduplicative paramnesia is understood to affect the frontal lobe, and thus it is believed that Capgras syndrome is also associated with the frontal lobe. Even if the damage is not directly to the frontal lobe, an interruption of signals between other lobes and the frontal lobe could result in Capgras syndrome. Some authors have highlighted cannabis consumption as a trigger for Capgras syndrome.

==Diagnosis==
Because it is a rare and poorly understood condition, there is no established way to diagnose the Capgras delusion. Diagnosis is primarily made on a psychiatric evaluation of the patient, who is most likely brought to a psychiatrist&#x27;s attention by a family member or friend believed to be an imposter by the person under the delusion. The patient may undergo mental skills tests to check for dementia or other conditions, and brain imaging tests like MRI or EEG that look for lesions or other brain changes.

==Treatment==
Treatment of Capgras delusion has not been well studied, so there is no evidence-based approach. Typically, treatment of delusional disorders is challenging due to poor patient insight and lack of empirical data. Treatment is generally therapy, often with support of antipsychotic medication. As manifestation of Capgras delusion is often a symptom rather than a syndrome itself, treatment may focus on the accompanying condition. A study has shown that using medications appropriately to target the underlying disorder&#x27;s core symptoms can be an effective management strategy. Hospitalization may be necessary, if the patient is engaging in self-harm or violence.

<text>Petr Beckmann (November 13, 1924 – August 3, 1993) was a professor of electrical engineering and advocate of libertarianism and nuclear power who disputed Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity and other accepted theories in modern physics.

==Biography==
In 1939, when Beckmann was 14, his family fled their home in Prague, Czechoslovakia to escape the Nazis. From 1942 to 1945, he served in a Czech squadron of the Royal Air Force. He worked as a radar mechanic on the newly invented radar systems that helped Britain win the Battle of the Atlantic. He received a B.Sc. in 1949, a Ph.D. in 1955, and a D.Sc. in 1962, all from Prague&#x27;s Czech Academy of Sciences in electrical engineering. He defected to the United States in 1963 and became a professor (later, emeritus) of electrical engineering at the University of Colorado. In the United States, he became acquainted with novelist Ayn Rand, a contributing editor to a publication devoted to her ideas, &quot;The Intellectual Activist&quot;, and a speaker at The Thomas Jefferson School, an intellectual conference of similar purpose.

Beckmann was a prolific author; he wrote several electrical engineering textbooks and non-technical works. By 1968, he had founded Golem Press, which published most of his books. The Golem Press books included &quot;The Health Hazards of Not Going Nuclear&quot; (1976), which argued in favor of nuclear power during the height of the anti-nuclear movement by making &quot;apples-to-apples&quot; comparisons of the risks of nuclear power with the risks in the same terms (e.g., deaths per terawatt hour) of the alternative power sources. Beckmann also wrote &quot;A History of&quot;, documenting the history of the calculation of . The book also expresses opposition to the Roman culture, Catholicism (and other religions), Nazism, and Communism. He published his own monthly newsletter, &quot;Access to Energy&quot;, which since September 1993 has been written by biochemist Arthur B. Robinson.

In 1981, he took early retirement with emeritus status, in order to devote himself fully to what he saw as the defense of science, technology and free enterprise, through his newsletter, &quot;Access to Energy&quot;. He founded the Golem Press in 1967, publishing more than nine books. These included &quot;The History of &quot;, &quot;Einstein Plus Two&quot;, and &quot;The Health Hazards of Not Going Nuclear&quot; (with an Introduction by Edward Teller). He wrote some 60 scientific papers and eight technical books. Beckmann spoke at the 1990 San Francisco Conference of International Society for Individual Liberty (ISIL), where he received a standing ovation for his speech in which he attacked &quot;sham environmentalists&quot;.

Beckmann was also a frequent participant in Usenet debates. In them, he claimed to have debunked Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of special relativity in his book &quot;Einstein Plus Two&quot;, as well as in the journal &quot;Galilean Electrodynamics&quot;, which he also founded.

<doc id="294994" wikidata="Q357136" url="?curid=294994" title="François-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg">
<text>François Henri de Montmorency-Bouteville, Duke of Piney-Luxembourg, commonly known as Luxembourg (8 January 1628 – 4 January 1695), and nicknamed &quot;The Upholsterer of Notre-Dame&quot; (&quot;Le Tapissier de Notre-Dame&quot;), was a French general and Marshal of France. A comrade and successor of the Great Condé, he was one of the most accomplished military commanders of the early modern period and is particularly noted for his exploits in the Franco-Dutch War and War of the Grand Alliance. Not imposing physically, as he was a slight man and hunchbacked, Luxembourg was nonetheless one of France&#x27;s greatest generals.

==Early years==
François Henri de Montmorency was born in Paris. His father, François de Montmorency-Bouteville, had been executed six months before his birth for participating in a duel against the Marquis de Beuvron. His aunt, Charlotte Marguerite de Montmorency, Princess of Condé, took charge of him and educated him with her son, the Duke of Enghien. The young Montmorency (or Bouteville as he was then called) attached himself to his cousin, and shared his successes and reverses throughout the troubles of the Fronde. He returned to France in 1659 and was pardoned, and Condé, then much attached to the Duchess of Châtillon, Montmorency&#x27;s sister, contrived the marriage of his adherent and cousin to the greatest heiress in France, Madeleine de Luxembourg, Princess of Tingry and heiress of the Luxembourg dukedom (1661), after which he was created Duke of Luxembourg and peer of France.

==Luxembourg as general==

===War of Devolution and the Franco-Dutch War===
At the opening of the War of Devolution (1667–68), Condé, and consequently Luxembourg, had no command, but during the second campaign he served as Condé&#x27;s lieutenant general in the conquest of Franche-Comté. During the four years of peace which followed, Luxembourg cultivated the favour of Louvois, and in 1672 held a high command against the Dutch during the Franco-Dutch War (1672–1678). He defeated a counterattack by the Prince William III of Orange at Woerden but was blocked by the Dutch Water Line. On 27 December the inundations were frozen over and he began to cross over the ice, but a sudden thaw cut his force in half. Retreating, de Luxembourg found the fortress town of Bodegraven abandoned by its garrison and ordered the entire civilian population to be burned alive with their houses. The Dutch anti-French propaganda quickly exploited this massacre and when de Luxembourg bragged to Louis XIV that he had roasted any Dutchman he could find in the town, he was surprised to find that some at court considered such cruelties unnecessary. In 1673 he made his famous retreat from Utrecht to Maastricht with only 20,000 men in face of 70,000, an exploit which placed him in the first rank of generals. In 1674 he was made captain of the Garde du Corps, and in 1675 Marshal of France.

On 10 March 1676 (N.S.) he was made commander of the Army of the Rhine replacing Condé, who was in bad health. However, he could not relieve the siege of Philippsburg. This fortress had been invested by Imperial troops under Charles V, Duke of Lorraine on 1 May. Luxembourg could neither break through the defenses of Wissembourg established by the Imperials, nor draw them out to do battle. Philippsburg fell on 17 September. In 1677 he stormed Valenciennes and defeated William of Orange again at Cassel. In 1678 William forced Luxembourg from his positions at Saint-Denis after the signature of the Peace of Nijmegen. Despite this his reputation was now high and it is reputed that he quarrelled with Louvois, who managed to involve him in the &quot;Affair of the Poisons&quot; and get him sent to the Bastille. Rousset in his &quot;Histoire de Louvois&quot; has shown that this quarrel is probably apocryphal. Luxembourg doubtlessly spent some months of 1680 in the Bastille, but on his release took up his post at court as &quot;capitaine des gardes&quot;.

===War of the Grand Alliance 1688-97===
 By 1690, during the War of the Grand Alliance, Luxembourg was entrusted with the command of King Louis&#x27; army in the Spanish Netherlands, superseding Louis de Crevant, Duke of Humières. On 1 July 1690, he won his greatest victory over William&#x27;s allied commander, the Prince of Waldeck, at Fleurus. Strategically the battle however changed little. In the following year his cavalry showed its superiority at Leuze, despite being eventually thrown back.

In the next campaign he covered the king&#x27;s 1692 Siege of Namur and repulsed a surprise attack of William at Steenkerque in 1692. On 29 July 1693, won the most famous of his battles over his eternal adversary at Neerwinden, after which he was called &quot;Le Tapissier de Nôtre Dame&quot; (The Upholsterer of Notre Dame) due to the number of captured enemy flags that he sent to the cathedral. However, his last victory would be devoid of strategic results. The heavy losses suffered by his army stalled his campaign and his soldiers mutinied after which Louis XIV ordered Luxembourg to return to the French border. He was received with enthusiasm at Paris by all but the king, who looked coldly on a relative and adherent of the Condés. St-Simon describes in the first volume of his &quot;Memoirs&quot; how, instead of ranking as eighteenth peer of France according to his patent of 1661, he claimed through his wife to be duc de Piney of an old creation of 1571, which would place him second on the roll. The affair is described with St-Simon&#x27;s usual interest in the peerage, and was chiefly checked through his assiduity.

In the campaign of 1694, Luxembourg did little in Flanders, except conducting a famous march from Vignemont to Tournai in face of the enemy.

==Death==
On his return to Versailles for the winter he fell ill, and died. In his last moments he was attended by the famous Jesuit priest Bourdaloue, who said on his death, &quot;I have not lived his life, but I would wish to die his death.&quot; Luxembourg was considered immoral, even in those times, but as a general he was Condé&#x27;s grandest pupil. Though slothful like Condé in the management of a campaign, at the moment of battle he seemed seized with happy inspirations, against which no ardour of William&#x27;s and no steadiness of Dutch or English soldiers could stand. His death and Catinat&#x27;s disgrace close the second period of the military history of the reign of Louis XIV.

==Reputation==
St-Simon said of Luxembourg:
...in his final calculations no one was ever more conscientious than M. de Luxembourg; no one more brilliant, prudent and far-sighted in the face of the enemy or in battle. He had daring and confidence, and at the same time a cool-headedness that allowed him to observe and foresee in the midst of the fiercest cannonade, in dangerously critical moments. That was when he was truly great. At all other times he was idleness itself; no exercise, except where absolutely necessary; gambling; conversing with intimates; every night a small supper party; nearly always with the same company, and, if they happened to be near a town, an agreeable mingling of the sexes.
He was distinguished for a pungent wit. One of his retorts referred to his deformity. &quot;I never can beat that cursed humpback&quot;, William was reputed to have said of him. &quot;How does he know I have a hump?&quot; retorted Luxembourg, &quot;he has never seen my back.&quot; He left four sons, the youngest of whom was a marshal of France as Marechal de Montmorency.

==Marriage and children==

On 17 March 1661 François-Henri de Montmorency married Madeleine de Clermont-Tonnerre, duchess of Luxembourg, princess of Tingry, comtess of Ligny, baroness of Dangu, and had 5 children:

* Charles Frédéric de Montmorency-Luxembourg (1662–1726), duc de Piney-Luxembourg, father of Charles II Frédéric (1702–1764) Marshal of France (1757);
* Pierre Henri de Montmorency-Luxembourg (1663–1700), abbot of Saint-Michel d&#x27;Orcamp;
* Paul Sigismond de Montmorency-Luxembourg (1664-1731), duc de Châtillon, comte de Luxe and baron d&#x27;Apremont;
* Angelique Cunegonde de Montmorency-Luxembourg (1666–1736), mademoiselle de Luxembourg; married Louis Henri de Bourbon, bâtard de Soissons&quot;, illegitimate son of Louis de Bourbon and had issue; had two children;
* Christian Louis de Montmorency-Luxembourg (1675–1746), prince de Tingry, comte de Luxe, pair de France, Marshal of France (1734).

<doc id="294995" wikidata="Q875744" url="?curid=294995" title="Euler–Lagrange equation">
<text>In the calculus of variations and classical mechanics, the Euler–Lagrange equations are a system of second-order ordinary differential equations whose solutions are stationary points of the given action functional. The equations were discovered in the 1750s by Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler and Italian mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange.

Because a differentiable functional is stationary at its local extrema, the Euler–Lagrange equation is useful for solving optimization problems in which, given some functional, one seeks the function minimizing or maximizing it. This is analogous to Fermat&#x27;s theorem in calculus, stating that at any point where a differentiable function attains a local extremum its derivative is zero. 
In Lagrangian mechanics, according to Hamilton&#x27;s principle of stationary action, the evolution of a physical system is described by the solutions to the Euler equation for the action of the system. In this context Euler equations are usually called Lagrange equations. In classical mechanics, it is equivalent to Newton&#x27;s laws of motion; indeed, the Euler-Lagrange equations will produce the same equations as Newton&#x27;s Laws. This is particularly useful when analyzing systems whose force vectors are particularly complicated. It has the advantage that it takes the same form in any system of generalized coordinates, and it is better suited to generalizations. In classical field theory there is an analogous equation to calculate the dynamics of a field.

==History==

The Euler–Lagrange equation was developed in the 1750s by Euler and Lagrange in connection with their studies of the tautochrone problem. This is the problem of determining a curve on which a weighted particle will fall to a fixed point in a fixed amount of time, independent of the starting point.

Lagrange solved this problem in 1755 and sent the solution to Euler. Both further developed Lagrange&#x27;s method and applied it to mechanics, which led to the formulation of Lagrangian mechanics. Their correspondence ultimately led to the calculus of variations, a term coined by Euler himself in 1766.

==Statement==
Let formula_1 be a real dynamical system with formula_2 degrees of freedom. Here formula_3 is the configuration space and formula_4 the &quot;Lagrangian&quot;, i.e. a smooth real-valued function such that formula_5 and formula_6 is an formula_2-dimensional &quot;vector of speed&quot;. (For those familiar with differential geometry, formula_3 is a smooth manifold, and formula_9 where formula_10 is the tangent bundle of formula_11

Let formula_12 be the set of smooth paths formula_13 for which formula_14 and formula_15 

The action functional formula_16 is defined via
formula_17

A path formula_18 is a stationary point of formula_19 if and only if

{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot q^i}(t,\boldsymbol q(t),\dot{\boldsymbol q}(t)) = 0,
\quad i = 1, \dots, n.&lt;/math&gt;
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}} 
Here, formula_20 is the time derivative of formula_21 When we say stationary point, we mean a stationary point of formula_19 with respect to any small perturbation in formula_23. See proofs below for more rigorous detail.

{\mathrm{d}x} \frac{\partial L}{\partial f&#x27;}(x,f(x),f&#x27;(x)) \right] \eta(x)\,\mathrm{d}x + \left[ \eta(x) \frac{\partial L}{\partial f&#x27;}(x,f(x),f&#x27;(x)) \right]_a^b = 0 \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Using the boundary conditions formula_24,
formula_25

Applying the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations now yields the Euler–Lagrange equation
formula_26
{\Delta t}\right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial y&#x27;} \frac{\Delta y_m}{\Delta t} 
&lt;/math&gt;formula_27

Evaluating the partial derivative gives
formula_28

Dividing the above equation by formula_29 gives
formula_30
and taking the limit as formula_31 of the right-hand side of this expression yields
formula_32

The left hand side of the previous equation is the functional derivative formula_33 of the functional formula_34. A necessary condition for a differentiable functional to have an extremum on some function is that its functional derivative at that function vanishes, which is granted by the last equation.

==Example==
A standard example is finding the real-valued function &quot;y&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) on the interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;], such that &quot;y&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) = &quot;c&quot; and &quot;y&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) = &quot;d&quot;, for which the path length along the curve traced by &quot;y&quot; is as short as possible. 
:formula_35
the integrand function being formula_36.

The partial derivatives of &quot;L&quot; are:
:formula_37
By substituting these into the Euler–Lagrange equation, we obtain
:formula_38
that is, the function must have a constant first derivative, and thus its graph is a straight line.

==Generalizations ==

===Single function of single variable with higher derivatives===
The stationary values of the functional
:formula_39
can be obtained from the Euler–Lagrange equation 
:formula_40
under fixed boundary conditions for the function itself as well as for the first formula_41 derivatives (i.e. for all formula_42). The endpoint values of the highest derivative formula_43 remain flexible.

===Several functions of single variable with single derivative===
If the problem involves finding several functions (formula_44) of a single independent variable (formula_45) that define an extremum of the functional
:formula_46
then the corresponding Euler–Lagrange equations are
:formula_47

===Single function of several variables with single derivative===
A multi-dimensional generalization comes from considering a function on n variables. If formula_48 is some surface, then

: formula_49

is extremized only if &quot;f&quot; satisfies the partial differential equation

: formula_50

When &quot;n&quot; = 2 and functional formula_51 is the energy functional, this leads to the soap-film minimal surface problem.

===Several functions of several variables with single derivative===
If there are several unknown functions to be determined and several variables such that
: formula_52
the system of Euler–Lagrange equations is
: formula_53

===Single function of two variables with higher derivatives===
If there is a single unknown function &quot;f&quot; to be determined that is dependent on two variables &quot;x&quot;1 and &quot;x&quot;2 and if the functional depends on higher derivatives of &quot;f&quot; up to &quot;n&quot;-th order such that
: formula_54
then the Euler–Lagrange equation is
:formula_55
which can be represented shortly as:
:formula_56
wherein formula_57 are indices that span the number of variables, that is, here they go from 1 to 2. Here summation over the formula_57 indices is only over formula_59 in order to avoid counting the same partial derivative multiple times, for example formula_60 appears only once in the previous equation.

===Several functions of several variables with higher derivatives===
If there are &quot;p&quot; unknown functions &quot;f&quot;i to be determined that are dependent on &quot;m&quot; variables &quot;x&quot;1 ... &quot;x&quot;m and if the functional depends on higher derivatives of the &quot;f&quot;i up to &quot;n&quot;-th order such that
:formula_61

where formula_57 are indices that span the number of variables, that is they go from 1 to m. Then the Euler–Lagrange equation is

:formula_63

where the summation over the formula_57 is avoiding counting the same derivative formula_65 several times, just as in the previous subsection. This can be expressed more compactly as

:formula_66

===Field theories===
==Generalization to manifolds==
Let formula_67 be a smooth manifold, and let formula_68 denote the space of smooth functions formula_69. Then, for functionals formula_70 of the form
:formula_71
where formula_72 is the Lagrangian, the statement formula_73 is equivalent to the statement that, for all formula_74, each coordinate frame trivialization formula_75 of a neighborhood of formula_76 yields the following formula_77 equations:
:formula_78
Euler-Lagrange equations can also be written in a coordinate-free form as 

:formula_79
where formula_80 is the canonical momenta 1-form corresponding to the Lagrangian formula_81. The vector field generating time translations is denoted by formula_82 and the Lie derivative is denoted by formula_83. One can use local charts formula_84 in which formula_85 and formula_86 and use coordinate expressions for the Lie derivative to see equivalence with coordinate expressions of the Euler Lagrange equation. The coordinate free form is particularly suitable for geometrical interpretation of the Euler Lagrange equations.

<doc id="294996" wikidata="Q311757" url="?curid=294996" title="Charles Taylor (philosopher)">
<text>Charles Margrave Taylor (born November 5, 1931) is a Canadian philosopher from Montreal, Quebec, and professor emeritus at McGill University best known for his contributions to political philosophy, the philosophy of social science, the history of philosophy, and intellectual history. His work has earned him the Kyoto Prize, the Templeton Prize, the Berggruen Prize for Philosophy, and the John W. Kluge Prize.

In 2007, Taylor served with Gérard Bouchard on the Bouchard–Taylor Commission on reasonable accommodation with regard to cultural differences in the province of Quebec. He has also made contributions to moral philosophy, epistemology, hermeneutics, aesthetics, the philosophy of mind, the philosophy of language, and the philosophy of action.

==Early life and education==
Charles Margrave Taylor was born in Montreal, Quebec, on November 5, 1931, to a Roman Catholic Francophone mother and a Protestant Anglophone father by whom he was raised bilingually. His father, Walter Margrave Taylor, was a steel magnate originally from Toronto while his mother, Simone Marguerite Beaubien, was a dressmaker. His sister was Gretta Chambers.

He attended Selwyn House School from 1939 to 1946, followed by Trinity College School from 1946 to 1949, and began his undergraduate education at McGill University where he received a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in history in 1952. He continued his studies at the University of Oxford, first as a Rhodes Scholar at Balliol College, receiving a BA degree with first-class honours in philosophy, politics and economics in 1955, and then as a postgraduate student, receiving a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1961 under the supervision of Sir Isaiah Berlin. As an undergraduate student, he started one of the first campaigns to ban thermonuclear weapons in the United Kingdom in 1956, serving as the first president of the Oxford Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Recent research has explored Taylor&#x27;s engagement with socialist politics during this time.

==Career==
He succeeded John Plamenatz as Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory at the University of Oxford and became a fellow of All Souls College.

For many years, both before and after Oxford, he was Professor of Political Science and Philosophy at McGill University in Montreal, where he is now professor emeritus. Taylor was also a Board of Trustees Professor of Law and Philosophy at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, for several years after his retirement from McGill.

Taylor was elected a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1986. In 1991, Taylor was appointed to the Conseil de la langue française in the province of Quebec, at which point he critiqued Quebec&#x27;s commercial sign laws. In 1995, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. In 2000, he was made a Grand Officer of the National Order of Quebec.

In 2007 he and Gérard Bouchard were appointed to head a one-year commission of inquiry into what would constitute reasonable accommodation for minority cultures in his home province of Quebec.

==Awards==
In 2003, he was awarded the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council&#x27;s Gold Medal for Achievement in Research, which had been the council&#x27;s highest honour. He was awarded the 2007 Templeton Prize for progress towards research or discoveries about spiritual realities, which included a cash award of US$1.5 million. In June 2008, he was awarded the Kyoto Prize in the arts and philosophy category. The Kyoto Prize is sometimes referred to as the Japanese Nobel. In 2015, he was awarded the John W. Kluge Prize for Achievement in the Study of Humanity, a prize he shared with philosopher Jürgen Habermas. In 2016, he was awarded the inaugural $1-million Berggruen Prize for being &quot;a thinker whose ideas are of broad significance for shaping human self-understanding and the advancement of humanity&quot;.

==Views==
Despite his extensive and diverse philosophical oeuvre, Taylor famously calls himself a &quot;monomaniac,&quot; concerned with only one fundamental aspiration: to develop a convincing philosophical anthropology.

In order to understand Taylor&#x27;s views, it is helpful to understand his philosophical background, especially his writings on Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Martin Heidegger, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Taylor rejects naturalism and formalist epistemology. He is part of an influential intellectual tradition of Canadian idealism that includes John Watson, George Paxton Young, C. B. Macpherson, and George Grant.

In his essay &quot;To Follow a Rule,&quot; Taylor explores why people can fail to follow rules, and what kind of knowledge it is that allows a person to successfully follow a rule, such as the arrow on a sign. The intellectualist tradition presupposes that to follow directions, we must know a set of propositions and premises about how to follow directions.

Taylor argues that Wittgenstein&#x27;s solution is that all interpretation of rules draws upon a tacit background. This background is not more rules or premises, but what Wittgenstein calls &quot;forms of life.&quot; More specifically, Wittgenstein says in the &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; that &quot;Obeying a rule is a practice.&quot; Taylor situates the interpretation of rules within the practices that are incorporated into our bodies in the form of habits, dispositions and tendencies.

Following Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michael Polanyi, and Wittgenstein, Taylor argues that it is mistaken to presuppose that our understanding of the world is primarily mediated by representations. It is only against an unarticulated background that representations can make sense to us. On occasion we do follow rules by explicitly representing them to ourselves, but Taylor reminds us that rules do not contain the principles of their own application: application requires that we draw on an unarticulated understanding or &quot;sense of things&quot; — the background.

==Taylor&#x27;s critique of naturalism==
Taylor defines naturalism as a family of various, often quite diverse theories that all hold &quot;the ambition to model the study of man on the natural sciences.&quot; Philosophically, naturalism was largely popularized and defended by the unity of science movement that was advanced by logical positivist philosophy. In many ways, Taylor&#x27;s early philosophy springs from a critical reaction against the logical positivism and naturalism that was ascendant in Oxford while he was a student.

Initially, much of Taylor&#x27;s philosophical work consisted of careful conceptual critiques of various naturalist research programs. This began with his 1964 dissertation &quot;The Explanation of Behaviour&quot;, which was a detailed and systematic criticism of the behaviourist psychology of B. F. Skinner that was highly influential at mid-century.

From there, Taylor also spread his critique to other disciplines. The essay &quot;Interpretation and the Sciences of Man&quot; was published in 1972 as a critique of the political science of the behavioural revolution advanced by giants of the field like David Easton, Robert Dahl, Gabriel Almond, and Sydney Verba. In an essay entitled &quot;The Significance of Significance: The Case for Cognitive Psychology&quot;, Taylor criticized the naturalism he saw distorting the major research program that had replaced B. F. Skinner&#x27;s behaviourism.

But Taylor also detected naturalism in fields where it was not immediately apparent. For example, in 1978&#x27;s &quot;Language and Human Nature&quot; he found naturalist distortions in various modern &quot;designative&quot; theories of language, while in &quot;Sources of the Self&quot; (1989) he found both naturalist error and the deep moral, motivational sources for this outlook in various individualist and utilitarian conceptions of selfhood.

==Taylor and hermeneutics==

Concurrent to Taylor&#x27;s critique of naturalism was his development of an alternative. Indeed, Taylor&#x27;s mature philosophy begins when as a doctoral student at Oxford he turned away, disappointed, from analytic philosophy in search of other philosophical resources which he found in French and German modern hermeneutics and phenomenology.

The hermeneutic tradition develops a view of human understanding and cognition as centred on the decipherment of meanings (as opposed to, say, foundational theories of brute verification or an apodictic rationalism). Taylor&#x27;s own philosophical outlook can broadly and fairly be characterized as hermeneutic and has been called &quot;engaged hermeneutics&quot;. This is clear in his championing of the works of major figures within the hermeneutic tradition such as Wilhelm Dilthey, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and Gadamer. It is also evident in his own original contributions to hermeneutic and interpretive theory.

==Communitarian critique of liberalism==
Taylor (as well as Alasdair MacIntyre, Michael Walzer, and Michael Sandel) is associated with a communitarian critique of liberal theory&#x27;s understanding of the &quot;self&quot;. Communitarians emphasize the importance of social institutions in the development of individual meaning and identity.

In his 1991 Massey Lecture &quot;The Malaise of Modernity&quot;, Taylor argued that political theorists—from John Locke and Thomas Hobbes to John Rawls and Ronald Dworkin—have neglected the way in which individuals arise within the context supplied by societies. A more realistic understanding of the &quot;self&quot; recognizes the social background against which life choices gain importance and meaning.

==Philosophy and sociology of religion==

Taylor&#x27;s later work has turned to the philosophy of religion, as evident in several pieces, including the lecture &quot;A Catholic Modernity&quot; and the short monograph &quot;Varieties of Religion Today: William James Revisited&quot;.

Taylor&#x27;s most significant contribution in this field to date is his book &quot;A Secular Age&quot; which argues against the secularization thesis of Max Weber, Steve Bruce, and others. In rough form, the secularization thesis holds that as modernity (a bundle of phenomena including science, technology, and rational forms of authority) progresses, religion gradually diminishes in influence. Taylor begins from the fact that the modern world has not seen the disappearance of religion but rather its diversification and in many places its growth. He then develops a complex alternative notion of what secularization actually means given that the secularization thesis has not been borne out. In the process, Taylor also greatly deepens his account of moral, political, and spiritual modernity that he had begun in &quot;Sources of the Self&quot;.

==Politics==
Taylor was a candidate for the social democratic New Democratic Party (NDP) in Mount Royal on three occasions in the 1960s, beginning with the 1962 federal election when he came in third behind Liberal Alan MacNaughton. He improved his standing in 1963, coming in second. Most famously, he also lost in the 1965 election to newcomer and future prime minister, Pierre Trudeau. This campaign garnered national attention. Taylor&#x27;s fourth and final attempt to enter the House of Commons of Canada was in the 1968 federal election, when he came in second as an NDP candidate in the riding of Dollard. In 1994 he coedited a paper on human rights with Vitit Muntarbhorn in Thailand.

Taylor served as a vice president of the federal NDP (beginning ) and was president of its Quebec section.

In 2010, Taylor said multiculturalism was a work in progress that faced challenges. He identified tackling Islamophobia in Canada as the next challenge.

In his 2020 book &quot;Reconstructing Democracy&quot; he, together with Patrizia Nanz and Madeleine Beaubien Taylor, uses local examples to describe how democracies in transformation might be revitalized by involving citizenship.

<text>Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti (11 October 162926 February 1666), was a French nobleman, the younger son of Henri II, Prince of Condé and Charlotte Marguerite de Montmorency, daughter of Henri I, Duke of Montmorency. He was the brother of &quot;le Grand Condé&quot; and Anne Geneviève, Duchess of Longueville. As a member of the reigning House of Bourbon, he was a &quot;Prince du Sang&quot;.

== Life ==

=== Early life ===
Armand de Bourbon was born October 11,1629 in Paris. The title of Prince of Conti was revived in his favor at the time of his birth. With the title Armand also inherited the Château de L&#x27;Isle-Adam and its estate, which had been passed down to his mother Charlotte Marguerite after the death of her brother, Henri II de Montmorency whom had been executed due to Cardinal Richelieu´s intrigues.

Conti&#x27;s god-father was the Cardinal Richelieu whom he was also named Armand after. His godmother was his aunt by marriage Marie-Félicie des Ursins,Duchess of Montmorency.

Conti´s paternal grandfather Henri I de Condé had been a leader of the Calvinist Huguenots and his paternal grandmother Charlotte Catherine de La Trémoille was descended from two of France&#x27;s oldest and most powerful families. His maternal grandfather was Henri de Montmorency, Duke of Montmorency and Louise de Budos.

Conti´s parents marriage had been arranged partly to neutralize his father as a potential leader of the Huguenots to rally around, and partly because the king, Henry IV wished to make Charlotte-Marguerite his mistress- and believing his young relative would remain complaisant enough to allow this. Instead Henri had fled together with his wife to Brussels and did not return until after the death of Henry IV in 1610.

Conti&#x27;s mother, Charlotte Marguerite was known for her beauty and refinement, while his father Henri was small and thin, intelligent but with a temper and with a reputation as zealous Catholic who much preferred hunting and the military life to being at court. 

Of the six children born to the couple only three would survive to adulthood. 

In 1632, the Duke of Montmorency, the Condé children&#x27;s uncle, was accused of conspiring against the king. Their mother Charlotte-Marguerite went to plead with the king for her brothers life and to assure them of his loyalty. Distraught she even offered her sons, the Duke of Enghien and the Prince of Conti as a guarantee of her words- but to no avail. Montmorency was executed. 

==== Education ====
Due to a slight deformity of his back and having a weak constitution he was destined for a clerical career and studied theology at the university of Bourges, where he was educated by Étienne - Agard de Champs. He had his own household Hotel de Limoges 

But although he received several benefices, including the abbeys of Cluny, Saint Denis,Lerins and Molesme, he did not take orders. 

Conti would later study at the Collège de Clermont, a Jesuit institution. On 6 August 1643, he obtained his diploma as master of arts and, in 1646, that of bachelor in theology from the University of Bourges. 

On the death of his father in 1646 when he was seventeen, he inherited the governorship of Champagne and Brie, and during the same year, he was subject to the decision of a family council which decided to keep him with the Jesuits for another year, to his great displeasure. 

Conti was considered intelligent but was described as &quot;a cypher&quot; by a contemporary. and vacillated between debauched behavior and religious fervor. 

===== Literary interests =====
It has been claimed that Conti had been a fellow student of Molière&#x27;s at Clermont but as Conti started attending the school in 1637 by which time Moliére had already left the school its more truthful to say they were alumni of the same school. Conti was however a patron of Moliere and La Fontaine. He even he secured an introduction to the court of King Louis XIV for Moliére.

Conti and his sister, the duchess de Longueville attended the literary salon of Catherine de Vivonne, marquise de Rambouillet at the Hôtel de Rambouillet. 

Conti was involved in a literary dispute over the sonnet &quot;Job&quot; (1651) by the poet Benserade.The sonnet, which Benserade sent to a young lady with his paraphrase on the book of Job, was compared with the &quot;Urania&quot; of Voiture and led to a dispute on their relative merits that divided the whole court into two parties, named the Jobelins and the Uranists. 

Those in favour of Benserade were headed by Conti and Mlle de Scudéry, while his sister, the Duchess de Longueville, along with Mme de Montausier and Jean-Louis Guez de Balzac took the side of Voiture. 

Conti also employed the writer Jean François Sarrazin as his secretary in 1648. Biographers of Sarrazin would later claim that Conti had killed Sarrazin. 

==== Love affairs ====
Conti kept a mistress Madame de Calvimont of Bordeaux who was &quot;as silly as she was handsome&quot;. Ending their relationship with her he entered instead into an affair with a Mme de Calvière of Montpellier who was a relative of the mistress of one of the noblemen in Conti&#x27;s entourage, Comte. d&#x27;Aubijoux. It was said that d&#x27;Aubijoux also was the cause of Conti contracting syphilis during his visit to Montpellier in the autumn of 1653. 

Conti also found Madame de Sevigne &quot;very amiable&quot;. 

== Involvement in the Fronde ==

=== First Fronde ===
Cardinal de Richelieu, chief minister of Louis XIII from 1624 to 1642,hade many policies who weakened the influence of the nobility and reduced the powers of the judicial bodies, called Parlements. Opposition to the government among the nobility began to grow from 1643 under the “foreign” rule of the queen regent Anne of Austria (Louis XIV’s mother) and her chief minister, Cardinal Mazarin.

The refusal of the Parlement of Paris to approve the government’s revenue measures in the spring of 1648 was the catalyst for the first Fronde wich was called, the Fronde of the Parlement. &quot;The frondeurs&quot; wanted to put a constitutional limit on the monarchy by establishing its power to discuss and modify royal decrees. The government at war with Spain felt pressured to accept the terms since they lacked sufficient power to fight as most of their army was occupied in Spain.

Conti´s sister Anne-Genevieve, Duchess de Longueville was the guiding spirit of the first Fronde, when she convinced the nineteen Conti of the just cause of the frondeurs and he subsequently played a conspicuous part in the intrigues and fighting of the Fronde. In 1648 he became the commander-in-chief of the rebel army, but by January 1649, Conti&#x27;s brother Condé returned from Spain joined the cause of the government and besieged Paris. 

The two warring parties signed the Peace of Rueil (11 March 1649) which granted amnesty to the rebels and confirmed the concessions to Parlement. Conti tried rallying the Parisians in asking for aid from Spain but they refused and with this the frondeurs had to lay down arms and submit to the government. The peace of Rueil lasted until the end of 1649. 

=== Second Fronde ===
The princes, welcomed at court again again began to plot against Mazarin. Cardinal Mazarin, having come to an understanding with Monsieur Gondi and Madame de Chevreuse, had Conti, his brother Condé and brother-in-law (Longueville) arrested, on January 18, 1650, at the same time in a gallery of the Louvre Palace, where they had been lured under various pretexts. They were then taken to be imprisoned in the donjon at Vincennes. The person in charge of guarding them were captain Guy de Bar, who had been given a hundred men to guard them and was said to treat his prisoners very harshly.

They were then taken on Château de Marcoussis where they arrived 15 November 1650 and after this to Fort du Havre on 25 November.

==== Life in prison ====
Conti, his brother and their brother-in-law de Longuevilles imprisonment in the Chateau de Vincennes would be prove to be an ordeal for the young prince, and during the earlier days of captivity Conti would keep to his bed and cry.

Said to be &quot;mystic&quot; and &quot;full of strange ideas&quot;, Conti turned slightly mad while in prison. (this might have been a symptom of the syphilis which would lead to his death) Having a secret passion for his sister the Duchess of Longueville, he invented tricks to make her notice him. He would later like her become a fervent jansenist. He tried alchemy and potions for some time and eventually bruised himself with a spatula. This episode was ultimately fortunate for him because he could no longer be refused external help from physicians, some of whom would pass letters and pleas to the outside world which sped up his eventual release.

The sister of the brothers, the Duchess de Longueville, having fled to avoid capture turned to Turenne and begged him for aid and he resolved to rescue her brothers.

The Fronde of the Princes, the second Fronde began in early 1650 and was unlike the first Fronde wich dealt with constitutional issues, instead it was opportunistically motivated the result was a web of intrigues, rivalries, and ever-shifting allegiances. One common factor among the aristocratic rebels was opposition to Mazarin and his influence over government. Conti´s brother Condé, disappointed in his hope for political power became rebellious. 

Conti, his brother and brother-in-law were released early in February 1651, and by the spring the rebellion was over. Condé, and what was left of his army decided to enter the service of the king of Spain.

==== Third Fronde ====
Conti and the Comte de Marsin were left as the Condes representatives in Guyenne while Condé, reinforced by the troops of the Duke of Orleans, advanced on the royalist army at Bleneau.The Grand Condé was arrested after paying a visit to the Anne of Austria,and yet again confined at Vincennes, and then imprisoned at Nantes, from where he managed to escape. Condé forced into exile and sentenced to execution in his absence was not able to return to France until after the death of Cardinal Mazarin. Conti on the other took refuge in Bordeaux and he capitulated on 31 July 1653 and obtained permission to retire to Languedoc, to Pézenas in his castle of La Grange-des-Prés.

Released when Cardinal Mazarin went into exile, Conti wished to marry Charlotte-Marie de Lorraine (1627–1652), the second daughter of Madame de Chevreuse, the confidante of the queen, Anne of Austria (wife of King Louis XIII of France), but was prevented from doing so by his brother Condé, who was now supreme in the state.

== Marriage ==
Soon afterwards became reconciled with Cardinal Mazarin and as a cause of this Conti married Anne-Marie Martinozzi in 1654, the daughter of Girolamo Martinozzi and Laura Margherita Mazzarino. Anne Marie was one of the Mazarinettes,the many nieces of the powerful Cardinal Mazarin. The marriage took place at the Palais du Louvre 22 February 1654. Anne-Marie was described as being possessed of a beautiful appearance, blonde hair ,a sweet temper, generous, with a lot of wit and intelligence Although generally seen as gentle and modest, she sometimes had blunt manners that disconcerted and offended people. 

Anne-Marie also brought a dowry of 200,000 ecus to the marriage and through this marriage Conti was given the government of Guyenneformerly governed by his brother. Because of this marriage to a relative of Mazarins Conti&#x27;s relationship with his brother turned sour and he was despised by the Grand Condé who hated Mazarin and found his brother allied to his enemy a betrayal. 

The couple made their home in a house on the quai Malaquais, which became known as the Hôtel de Conti.

The couple´s first child was born stillborn a year after their marriage,their second in 1656 was likewise a stillbirth. In 1658 a son that they named Louis, was born sickly and &quot;covered in ulcers&quot; and would only live for a few weeks.

They would go on to have two sons, Louis Armand and François Louis who would live to adulthood.

Conti took command of the army, which in 1654, invaded Spain through Catalonia, where he captured three towns from the Spanish during the Franco-Spanish War. He afterwards 1657 led the French forces in northern Italy, but after his defeat before Alessandria he would retire from the military life. 

=== Religious conversion ===
Sometime around 1656, Conti ailing from what publicly was called a fever but most likely were syphilitic symtoms was visited by the Bishop of Aleth,Nicolas Pavillon. Pavillon was a zealous jansenist who effected Conti´s full conversion to Jansenism. Pavillon also advised Conti to acquire a spiritual guide and the person appointed by the bishop was Abbé Gabriel de Ciron. Ciron would be consulted by Conti on a regular basis,and would also serve as spiritual advisor for Conti´s wife and sister.

Conti joined the Compagnie du Saint-Sacrament [English:Company of the Blessed Sacrament],a religious society who swore its members to secrecy about the existence of the group and its inner workings.

Now completely devoted to Jansenism, Conti completely changed his way of living, by moderating his spending, cutting out all unnecessary luxuries in the in his household. The Prince of Conti also gave abundant alms to hospitals and the poor and gave considerable sums to churches and convents; he had even wanted to strip himself of all his property and his titles but was prevented by Pavillon to do so. Furthermore apart from when he was devoted to business, Conti occupied himself with reading religious literature, 
spiritual retreats, mortification and confessions to Abbé Ciron. 

Ciron had such a great power over Conti that he went, on the orders of Ciron, to throw himself at the feet of M. de Calvimont, a counselor in the Bordeaux Parliament, whose wife Mme de Calvimont, Conti had seduced a few years earlier and beg his forgiveness.

Conti´s new religious fervor went to such extreme lengths as to forbidding the servants in his household from dancing, playing games and attending plays. He also expected his servants to attend three masses a day held in his private chapel. Those servants that he deemed lacking their worship he punished by ordering that they only be given bread and water for a few days.

In order to demonstrate how sincere his conversion was Conti who had been a patron of the theatre, decided write a treatise against the theatre entitled &quot;Traité de la comédie et des spectacles selon les traditions de l&#x27;Église&quot; (Paris, 1667), in wich Conti turned against his old protégé Moliére, and charged the dramatist with keeping a school of atheism. 

The writing of this work constantly occupied him during the last years of his life. Conti also wrote &quot;Lettres sur la grâce&quot;, and &quot;Du devoir des grands et des devoirs des gouverneurs de province&quot;.

=== Friendship with Pére Surin ===
Conti was personally acquainted with Jesuit preacher and mystic Jean-Joseph Surin, whose book &quot;Catéchisme spirituel&quot; (1656) he helped to publish. Surins cousin, Jean de Belhade, chevalier de Thodias had been a loyal supporter and military commander of the Grand Condé during The Fronde, and it&#x27;s possible through this connection that Conti became acquainted with Surin. 

Conti would also together with his sister attend clandestine meetings organized by Surins mother Jeanne de Seurin (née d’Arrerac). As these meetings occurred during the height of first Fronde, there has been speculation that it was not only religious matters discussed but that Surin was one of the conspirators. Surin&#x27;s father had been a council member of the Bordeaux Parliament. 

The two men would maintain a friendship until Surin&#x27;s death. 

== Later life ==
On 16 January 1660, Louis XIV granted him an annual pension of 60,000 livres and offered him the government of Languedoc, which had been left vacant by the death of Gaston d&#x27;Orléans, the king&#x27;s uncle. 

== Death ==
Conti died on 26 February 1666 at Pézenas at the Château de la Grange-des - Prés in Languedoc, France, likely from syphilis. Conti was buried at the Chartreuse du Val-de-Bénédiction in Villeneuve-lès-Avignon. 

==Issue==
Armand married Anne Marie Martinozzi, the daughter of Girolamo Martinozzi and Laura Margherita Mazzarini, elder sister of Cardinal Mazarin. They had the following children:

# Stillborn child (1655)
# Stillborn child (1656)
# Louis de Bourbon (Hôtel de Conti, 6 September 1658 - Hôtel de Conti, 14 September 1658)
#Louis Armand I, Prince of Conti (1661–1685), married Marie Anne de Bourbon, the eldest legitimised daughter of King Louis XIV and his mistress, Louise de La Vallière, and died childless.
# François Louis, Prince of Conti (1664–1709), known as &quot;le Grand Conti&quot;, married Marie Thérèse de Bourbon, daughter of Henri Jules, Prince of Condé (Armand&#x27;s nephew), and had issue.

Marie Alexandrine &quot;Mary&quot; &quot;Freiin&quot; von Vetsera was born on 19 March 1871 as the third child and second daughter of Albin &quot;Freiherr&quot; von Vetsera (1825–1887), an Austrian diplomat from Pozsony, Kingdom of Hungary (present day Bratislava, Slovakia), and his wife, born Eleni &quot;Hélène&quot; Baltazzi (1847–1925), member of a wealthy noble family from Chios, Greece (then part of the Ottoman Empire). Albin Vetsera had been the guardian of the orphaned Baltazzi children and married the eldest daughter. He was raised to the rank of &quot;Freiherr&quot; in 1870 by Emperor Franz Joseph. Mary had three siblings, Ladislaus &quot;Laci&quot; (1865–1881), Johanna &quot;Hanna&quot; (1868–1901), and Franz Albin &quot;Fery&quot; (1872–1915).

&quot;Freifrau&quot; von Vetsera&#x27;s main goal was to advance socially, for which she had the support of the imperial family, even though she did not have the right to visit the court. She wanted to break out from the &quot;parvenu&quot; status she had as the wife of a newly made noble, and for this, she needed her daughters to marry into the best possible families. Vetsera was thus raised in a strict household under the pressure of having to climb socially and fulfill the dreams of her mother. For education, she was sent to the Institute for Daughters of the Nobility in the Salesian convent in Vienna&#x27;s third district. When she came of age, her mother threw parties and tried to be invited to court so that she could find the best husband for her daughters. It seems that Vetsera had a strained relationship with her mother, confiding in a friend that &quot;Mamma has no love for me... Ever since I was a little girl she has treated me like something she means to dispose of to the best advantage&quot;. During the winter of 1887, the Vetsera family travelled to Cairo, Khedivate of Egypt because of the illness of the father. While there, Vetsera supposedly had an affair with an English officer.

==Relationship with Crown Prince Rudolf==
In 1888, Vetsera became infatuated with Crown Prince Rudolf (1858–1889), a married man 13 years her senior, after returning from Cairo following the death of her father. In November of that year, she managed to meet him and soon they began an affair. She was 17 and he was 30. Upon finding out, her family reacted negatively: her sister Hanna called her foolish, and her mother was enraged, accusing her of compromising herself and ruining the lives of all of her family members. Historian Lucy Coatman disputes Larisch&#x27;s claims (who Georg Markus refers to), citing letters by Mary and from within the family which prove Helene and Hanna had no knowledge of Mary&#x27;s affair with Rudolf until the tragedy occurred.
 Vetsera appears to have been deeply in love, maybe even thinking that she was a credible threat to her lover&#x27;s wife, Crown Princess Stéphanie (1864–1945). Meanwhile, Rudolf was involved in a long-term relationship with actress Mizzi/Mitzi Kaspar (1864–1907). It was to Kaspar that Rudolf first proposed a suicide pact, to which she reacted with a laugh. Later, Kaspar went to the police, concerned for the safety of the heir to the throne, but she was dismissed and told not to interfere with imperial affairs.

==Death==

After Kaspar had refused to die with him, the crown prince proposed a suicide pact to Vetsera. While he probably just did not want to die alone, Vetsera seemingly perceived the plans as the dramatic union-in-death of star-crossed lovers. She wrote: &quot;If I could give him my life I should be glad to do it, for what does life mean for me?&quot; In her farewell note to her sister, she wrote &quot;we are both going blissfully into the uncertain beyond.&quot;

On 29 January 1889, the imperial couple hosted a family dinner party before leaving for Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary. The crown prince excused himself and travelled to the hunting lodge in Mayerling, where he arranged for a day of shooting for 30 January. When his valet, Johann Loschek knocked on his door to wake him up early in the morning, he received no answer. Rudolf&#x27;s hunting companion, Count Joseph von Hoyos-Stichstenstein joined him, and they tried to open the door.

In the end, Loschek smashed in a door panel with a hammer and opened the door from the inside. In the dark room, he found the crown prince sitting motionless by the side of the bed, leaning forward and bleeding from the mouth. Vetsera&#x27;s body lay on the bed, with rigor mortis having already set in. Later it was determined that the crown prince had first shot Vetsera, then himself.

==Aftermath==

Vetsera&#x27;s maternal uncles were quickly summoned to remove their niece&#x27;s body and bury it as discreetly as possible. Even her mother was forbidden to attend the ceremony. The body was taken to the closest cemetery, the one at the Cistercian monastery in Heiligenkreuz. As her death was thought to be a suicide, her uncles had a hard time persuading the abbot to give permission for a Christian burial, eventually convincing him that she had only committed it because of momentary insanity.

On 16 May 1889, Vetsera&#x27;s mother had her daughter exhumed. Vetsera&#x27;s remains were transferred from the original wooden coffin to a copper one and reburied.

The official story of murder-suicide was unchallenged until after the Second World War. After Soviet troops had disturbed Vetsera&#x27;s grave, and when it was being repaired in 1955, the monks found a small skeleton inside the coffin, with no apparent bullet holes in its skull.

In 1959, physician Gerd Holler and a member of the Vetsera family, accompanied by other specialists, inspected her remains. The bones were in disarray, but shoes and long black hair were found in the coffin. Upon careful examination, Holler found no sign of a bullet wound on the skeleton. The skull cavity showed signs of trauma, which could have been inflicted by the grave robbers, or could indicate that Vetsera had died from a blow to her skull and not by the hands of the crown prince.

Holler claimed he petitioned the Holy See to inspect their archives of the incident, including records of the investigation by an apostolic nuncio, Archbishop Luigi Galimberti, who had found that only one bullet was fired. Lacking forensic evidence of a second bullet, Holler advanced the theory that Vetsera died accidentally, probably as the result of an abortion, and that Rudolf then shot himself. Lucy Coatman, who is planning a biography of Vetsera, argues against this, citing a letter written by Mary shortly before the Mayerling incident. In it, Mary confirms that she lost her virginity to Rudolf on 13 January 1889. Coatman states that this proves Mary could not have died of a botched abortion, as a pregnancy would not have been evident at the time of their deaths. In 1991, Vetsera&#x27;s remains were disturbed again, this time by Helmut Flatzelsteiner, a Linz furniture dealer obsessed with the Mayerling incident who removed them for a forensic examination at his expense, which took place in February 1993. Flatzelsteiner told the examiners that the remains belonged to a relative killed 100 years earlier who may have been shot in the head or stabbed. One expert thought that this might be possible, but since the skull was in a state of advanced decomposition, it could not be confirmed. Other experts confirmed the presence of the remains of a bullet, as well as the hair being singed from the impact.

When Flatzelsteiner approached a journalist to sell both the story and the skeleton, the police became involved. Flatzelsteiner confessed and surrendered Vetsera&#x27;s remains, which were sent to the Legal Medical Institute in Vienna for further examination. Forensic experts found the bones were indeed 100 years old and those of a young woman aged around 20, but since part of the skull was missing, it could not be determined if there had ever been a bullet hole. Vetsera&#x27;s bones were re-interred on 28 October 1993.

On 31 July 2015, the Austrian National Library obtained copies of Vetsera&#x27;s farewell letters to her mother and other family members which had been found in a bank safe deposit box, where they had been placed in 1926. Written in Mayerling shortly before the deaths, they state clearly that Vetsera was preparing to die alongside Rudolf out of love for him. They were made available to scholars and exhibited to the public in 2016.

<text>Wonalancet (16191697) also spelled Wannalancet and Wannalancit and probably Wanaloset and Wanalosett — was a sachem or sagamore of the Penacook Indians. He was the son of Passaconaway.

==Biography==
Wonalancet was born 1619 after one of the worst epidemics in human history killed 75-90% of the populations of the indigenous peoples of New England. He was supposedly born near Pawtucket Falls in what is now Lowell, Massachusetts, where his father was politically active trying to bring political stability among allies. He was most likely the second son of his father, Passaconaway, whose Penacook or Pennacook confederation of Upper Merrimack bands was at the time closely allied with the Pawtucket confederation of bands along the lower Merrimack (as well as the coastal tribes from the North Shore to the Saco in Maine). The previous &quot;bashaba,&quot; or &quot;chief of chiefs&quot; of the alliance had been Nanepashemet, the sachem of the Pawtucket, who was killed on the north bank of the Mystic River at what now is Malden in 1619. These allied, &quot;central Abenakian&quot; peoples, were under repeated attacks at the time from the &quot;Tarrantines,&quot; or Mi&#x27;kmaq of Maine, going back to possibly as early as 1607. Wonalancet&#x27;s father, Passaconaway, would rise from sachem of the Pennacook to bashaba well before the time John Eliot hears the phrase when meeting with him at Pawtucket Falls in 1647.

While Wonalancet&#x27;s other siblings were married to the children of other elite sagamores and sachems of allied tribes, it is unclear who Wonalancet&#x27;s wife was, although much evidence points toward her coming from allied tribes of the Abenaki to the north of Pennacook and possibly as far as the St. Francis River. Throughout the epidemics of the 17th century, especially the deadly outbreak of smallpox in 1633, Wonalancet preferred to stay in the vicinity of Pawtucket Falls and had a particular love for Wickasauke Island, which was his preferred residence. But in 1637, the British massacred the Pequot in what is now Connecticut, ending the early period of harmonious relations. Fearing reprisals from the friendly Pawtucket and Pennacook, the English set out to arrest Passaconaway at Pawtucket Falls. Finding only his son, Wonalancet, they arrested him along with his wife and children. Wonalancet would escape, but the English would not return his family until Passaconaway and Wonalancet had ensured the English that the Pennacook had turned in all their firearms.

In 1653, missionary John Eliot was allowed to create a &quot;praying town&quot; for the local Pawtucket and Pennacook at nearby Wamesit, what is now Chelmsford (and had also been at times the home site of the Wamesit band of the Pawtucket). Wonalancet would become good friends with Daniel Gookin, chief administrator of English missions, which is much of why we know so much about Wonalancet, his family, and their betrayal by the English. By 1660, Passaconaway had become very old and was petitioning for land to settle on a farm of his own near the Souhegan (&quot;not&quot; in Pennacook itself, as David Stewart-Smith 1998 has argued quite successfully). It was in 1660 that Passaconaway abdicated his authority over the Pennacook to Wonalancet, who continued to maintain diplomatic relations with the English. In 1662 and 1663, Passaconaway and his sons Nanamocumuck and Wonalancet successfully petitioned for and were given lands between what is now Groton and Nashua in attempt to create a southern barrier between English settlement and the Pennacook heartland, which stretched to the north as far as the New Hampshire Lakes Region. The English had previously taken an allied sagamore hostage, and Wickasauke island had been traded to the English for the elder&#x27;s release. In the 1660s, Wonalancet and several of his family members signed petitions to have Wickasauke Island returned to them, and Wonalancet would eventually relinquish his land grant near Groton for the return of the island near Pawtucket Falls, which clearly held great value to him and his dwindling people.

While Wonalancet would finally be baptized in 1674 as a sign that he and his people were not taking sides during King Philip&#x27;s War, harassment from the local English would force him to remove his people to Pennacook in the north in 1675 (to what is now Concord, NH). Captain Mosely from Massachusetts followed Wonalancet and his followers to Pennacook, where they stood aside as Mosely burned the village and all their winter stores, leaving them to starve and freeze. Mosely was deemed a hero. When increasing harassment from Massachusetts colonists led the rest of the Christian Wamesit &quot;praying town&quot; people to flee north, their sagamore, Nobhow (who had married one of Wonalancet&#x27;s sisters, Bess) left a note for the English, &quot;We go towards the French, we go where Wanalansit is.&quot; Because Mosely had destroyed Pennacook in the late fall, Nobhow, Mystic George (a Pawtucket powwow), and many of the party died during the trip. Those who survived returned through the snow in January having not found Wonalancet, who had ostensibly fled to his wife&#x27;s people (the Abenaki) to the north after the destruction of Pennacook by Mosely.

Wonalancet would emerge again the next year, in 1676, as an important peacemaker, gathering the northern and coastal tribes who had taken refuge from the war to show their faith to the English. Along with 400 of the most important leaders of his alliance, he met with Captain Richard Waldron in Cocheco. Waldron, however, broke their peace deal and took them all prisoner. While Waldron would eventually agree to let Wonalancet and half of his party free, to send a message, 200 of the party were enslaved for life and sent to Barbados to die on plantations. This party that was sent to slavery by Waldron included Wenepaweekin, Wonalancet&#x27;s brother in law, the old sagamore of Naumkeg (Salem), who was the last living son of the Pawtucket Bashaba Nanepeshamet (who had died in 1619).

Facing more direct harassment at Wickasaukee Island in 1677 from his English neighbors and their Mohawk allies from New York, Wonalancet moved north to the protection of Pennacook with the last 50 survivors of the Wamesit mission. In 1685 he would sell Wickasauke Island to Jonathan Tyng. By this time he had abdicated his authority over what was left of his people to his older brother&#x27;s son, Kankamagus, who would briefly be known as the Pennacook war chief while avenging the savagery and immorality of Captain Waldron and the English under his protection. In 1689, Kankamagus would gather the Pennacook and their allies to a great war council to target Waldron for his repeated broken promises and treaties. On June 27, 1689, they attacked Cocheco, killing 23 people who resisted and taking 29 others captive, including Waldron&#x27;s daughter. Waldron himself, who had bragged the night before that if attacked he could immediately rally 100 men to his defense, was ritually executed by multiple people he had wronged throughout his life. The war would last into the 18th century, but in 1690 Benjamin Church would capture Kankamagus&#x27;s wife and children, forcing him to capitulate. This led Kankamagus to sign a peace treaty on the Kennebec delta that year, and he would finally remove his people to the protection of the French and Abenakian allies to the north. 

In March 1692, two old sagamores from Pennacook, Wonalancet and Wattanummon, traveled down the Merrimack to Dunstable (now Nashua) to seek peaceful coexistence with the English. In return for their good will, they were both immediately arrested by the English. Jonathan Tyng would step in and sponsor Wonalancet, essentially taking care of him in his old age while he waited out his death under &quot;house arrest&quot; rather than being sent into enslavement in Barbados. Tyng would personally support Wonalancet, who must have been a friend, and bury Wonalancet himself in 1697, probably on his land or on Wonalancet&#x27;s beloved Wickasauke Island. David Stewart-Smith (1994, 1998) provides good evidence that many of Wonalancet&#x27;s descendants joined others in migrating to the protection of the White Mountains and eventually the French.

Rarely was a group of indigenous Americans so pacifist toward the English so early in the colonial period as the Pennacook and Pawtucket under Passaconaway and Wonalancet. Such betrayals as they suffered would continue from New England to California until it would be impossible for America&#x27;s first people to be able to claim their rightful land (or get current residents to accept they are living on stolen land). Wonalancet&#x27;s legacy, however, is not one of defeat. As David Stewart-Smith writes (1998: 464) “If it is strategy to see one’s community survive, the northern tribes of New England succeeded under fatal odds ... Small Indian communities still survive in New England and the old blood flows hidden in many Yankee and French Canadian families, bearing some quiet testimony to the land and lasting portent for the future.”

== Misinformation ==
As is true of the early colonial period in New England and the history of indigenous Americans in general, there is a great deal of misinformation about Passaconaway and Wonalancet, including a lack of consensus about the meanings of their names. While town histories such as Coburn&#x27;s History of Dracut and Potter&#x27;s History of Manchester portend to be &quot;histories,&quot; they often contain more misinformation than fact. They are storytelling, and are interesting as oral history, but not for explaining historical events and people. Unfortunately, they are repeatedly cited, and misinformation about this period and the people abounds and is continually spread. English writers liked the fables they told of Passaconaway and Wonalancet because they were the &quot;pacifist&quot; chiefs who never actually double-crossed the English nor fought them. The real story of their betrayal and repeated arrest and enslavement at the hands of the English is almost never told. Further, the perpetuation of the story that Wonalancet&#x27;s sister Bess, wife of Nobhow, simply foolishly sold what became Lowell and Chelmsford to the English for the sum of four yards of Duffill and one pound of tobacco is shameful. Yet the fact that story still remains from the colonial era and is retold in the 21st century as a means to forget crimes of the past should give us pause for reflection.

==Legacy==
The name &quot;Wonalancet&quot; translates to &quot;Pleasant Breathing&quot;. His name is or has been preserved by:

*Wonalancet, New Hampshire, an unincorporated village within the town of Tamworth
*The Wonalancet River, which flows through the village
*Mount Wonalancet, elevation , in the Sandwich Range, overlooking the village

As well as a mill, street, lodge, and pair of U.S. Navy vessels, all listed here.

<text>Princess Stéphanie Clotilde Louise Herminie Marie Charlotte of Belgium (21 May 1864 – 23 August 1945) was a Belgian princess who became Crown Princess of Austria through marriage to Crown Prince Rudolf, heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
Princess Stéphanie was the second daughter of King Leopold II of Belgium and Marie Henriette of Austria. She married in Vienna on 10 May 1881 Crown Prince Rudolf, son and heir of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. They had one child, Archduchess Elisabeth Marie. Stéphanie&#x27;s marriage quickly became fragile. Rudolf, depressed and disappointed by politics, had multiple extramarital affairs, and contracted a venereal disease that he transmitted to his wife, rendering her unable to conceive again. In 1889, Rudolf and his mistress Mary Vetsera were found dead in an apparent murder-suicide pact at the imperial hunting lodge at Mayerling in the Vienna Woods.

In 1900, Stéphanie married again, to Count Elemér Lónyay de Nagy-Lónya et Vásáros-Namény, a Hungarian nobleman of lower rank; for this, she was excluded from the House of Habsburg. However, this second union was happy. After the death of her father in 1909, Stéphanie joined her older sister Louise to claim from the Belgian courts the share of the inheritance of which they both felt they had been stripped.

Until World War II, Count and Countess Lónyay (elevated to the princely rank in 1917) peacefully spent their lives at Rusovce Mansion in Slovakia. In 1935, Stéphanie published her memoirs, entitled &quot;Je devais être impératrice&quot; (&quot;I Had to Be Empress&quot;). In 1944, she disinherited her daughter, who had divorced to live with a socialist deputy and whom she had not seen since 1925. The arrival of the Red Army in April 1945, at the end of the war, forced Stéphanie and her husband to leave their residence and take refuge in the Pannonhalma Archabbey in Hungary. Stéphanie died of a stroke in the abbey later the same year.

==Life==
===Early years===
====Family background and birth====

Stéphanie was the third child of the Duke (future King Leopold II) and Duchess of Brabant (born Archduchess Marie Henriette of Austria), an unhappy and mismatched couple. In 1853, their marriage had been arranged for exclusively political reasons by both King Leopold I and the Habsburgs without consulting the groom and bride, whose interests were almost entirely opposed: the Duke of Brabant was little interested by family life and was passionate about political and economic issues in the kingdom which he was to reign over, while Marie Henriette was a young woman versed in religion with other interests limited to horseback riding, dogs and music.

Born at the Palace of Laeken on 21 May 1864, Stéphanie received an emergency baptism on the day of her birth. The official baptism took place one month later, on 25 June, in a ceremony which lasted an hour, in the chapel of the Palace of Laeken, where she received the names Stéphanie Clotilde Louise Herminie Marie Charlotte; her first two names were in honor of her godparents, her maternal uncle Archduke Stephen of Austria, titular Palatine of Hungary) and her aunt by marriage Princess Clotilde of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. After the ceremony, a gala lunch was given with 60 people in attendance.

Stéphanie had two older siblings: Louise (born 18 February 1858), and Leopold, Count of Hainaut (born 12 June 1859). On 10 December 1865, her paternal grandfather King Leopold I, founder of the Belgian dynasty, died after a reign of 34 years. His son, Stéphanie&#x27;s father, ascended to the throne under the name of Leopold II, and her brother assumed the title of Duke of Brabant as the new heir of the throne.

====A family and dynastic drama====

In the spring of 1868, the almost 9-year-old Leopold, Duke of Brabant and heir to the throne, suffered from a chill following a fall in the pond in the Park of Laeken. His condition deteriorated rapidly: the doctor diagnosed acute pericarditis. In the summer, he seemed to recover, but his cough persisted. The doctor recommended the removal of the uvula and performed this surgery before his young patient went to Ostend to recover. Queen Marie Henriette isolated herself in Spa to rest, while King Leopold II, held back by affairs of state, and his two daughters remained in Laeken. In August, Leopold, suffering from dropsy, was brought back to Laeken. The Queen thenceforth never left her son&#x27;s bedside. After having received the last sacraments in September, the son seemed better, but his condition worsened again until he died on 22 January 1869.

In her memoirs, Stéphanie wrote: &quot;The first event that was deeply engraved in my memory was the death of this beloved brother [...]. Although I was only four and a half years old, I still vividly remember this deliciously beautiful and tender child, his resignation during his short illness, and the poignant pain of my mother, when he exhaled in her arms&quot;. Stéphanie&#x27;s childhood was therefore marked by this mourning: &quot;From that moment on, my memories have seen my parents&#x27; married life darken. Struck in the heart by the death of her son, my mother had changed a lot: this child had been the goal of her life, he had reconciled her with the fate that had fallen to her&quot;.

At the beginning of 1871, epidemics of typhus and smallpox raged in Brussels. The Queen, without worrying about potential contagion, assisted affected families. On 10 April, Stéphanie, who was not yet seven, contracted typhus, to the dismay of her parents, who feared that a second child of theirs would die. For many weeks, the girl was unconscious, feverish and in great pain. Her relatives prepared her for death. Her father often came to see her, and her mother and the faithful Toni Schariry, a nanny of German origin hired shortly after Stéphanie&#x27;s birth, wept at her bedside. The princess was saved only by the care of an unknown Ardennes doctor, whom the royal couple had consulted, who recommended cold baths. The fever decreased and in October, Stéphanie was considered to have recovered. After the recovery of their daughter, Léopold II and Marie Henriette took her and her sister to make her convalescence in Biarritz, making a stopover in Paris.

Leopold nourished the hope of having a second son and therefore resumed sexual relations with the Queen; but, after a miscarriage in March 1871, another daughter was born on 30 July 1872: Clémentine, the last child of the royal couple. Stéphanie relates about her parents: &quot;It is sad and discouraging to think that these two beings [...] could not live better together and create a home. But unfortunately, they did not understand each other. Their paths crossed for a single instant, only to move away immediately and forever. He chose that of indifference, infidelity, she had to accept that of resignation, loneliness and pain&quot;. Leopold II thereafter lost interest in his family; he turned his attentions to the notorious creation of the Congo Free State, which was his personal fiefdom and not a Belgian colonial territory, and as such its ruthless exploitation amassed him a vast private fortune. He also rejected his family for his mistresses – having so many scandalous liaisons that he was known to his subjects as &quot;Le Roi des Belges et des Belles&quot; (“The King of the Belgians and of the Beauties”).

====Instruction and education====

From 1874, Stéphanie (who until then had a nanny, the Viennese Antoinette Polsterer) was placed under the direction of her sister Louise&#x27;s governess, Mademoiselle Legrand. Stephanie writes: &quot;My education began at the age of ten; I immediately understood that from that moment books and notebooks would take the place of my toys, that a more orderly life would begin&quot;. Stéphanie benefitted from schooling by teachers who provided her with various courses: French, English, German, Dutch and Hungarian for languages, while mathematics lessons, horsemanship, history, history of art, religion, botany, and rhetoric were also taught. However, the level of education of the princesses was not very high: &quot;The programs lacked scope. In the severe decor of the study room, it was usually too rudimentary that we applied ourselves to history, geography, literature, mathematics; a preponderant place being left to the decorative arts: painting, drawing, music, as well as needlework&quot;.

If Stéphanie&#x27;s instruction was somewhat rudimentary, the discipline was strict: &quot;We got up early in the morning: in summer, at five o&#x27;clock, in winter, at six o&#x27;clock. During our toilet, the most absolute silence was required; any breach of this rule resulted in severe punishment. We had to dress and comb our hair on our own. The maid stood in the room and watched us. In order to test us, the housekeeper often made unexpected entries. [...] Our dresses were as simple as our hairstyles. Cut in the shape of a shirt, they fell without any trim, below the knee; a leather belt held them back. In order to toughen us up, the windows of our bedroom, summer and winter, remained open: we rarely heated&quot;. Louise and Stéphanie had to dust their room themselves. Sometimes they joined the King and Queen at breakfast time. At their table, adorned with flowers, were sweets that the princesses were not allowed to taste. When Stéphanie was punished, she had to kneel on dry peas or remain locked up for hours, in the dark, between double doors. Stephanie and Louise had lunch and dinner with their parents after their governess reported their behavior to the Queen. When the King entered the dining room, the princesses would rise and bow before kissing his hand which he then put on their head, without a word. Only the girls&#x27; maid Toni showed them constant affection. The feast days, Easter, Saint Nicholas Day and Christmas, were the only times when Stéphanie and her sisters were pampered.

===Crown Princess of Austria-Hungary===
====Marriage projects====
While her older sister Louise married in 1875 a wealthy cousin of their father, Prince Philipp of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Austrian officer and friend of Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria, Stéphanie continued her studies and willingly took care of her younger sister Clémentine because Louise&#x27;s departure left a void at the Palace of Laeken.

Stéphanie made her first communion on 12 June 1876 and officially appeared for the first time at court. A few months later, Louise and her husband went to Brussels. Stéphanie found her older sister, who had turned into a &quot;young woman admired and celebrated&quot;, very different from the young girl she had known.

During the winter of 1878–1879, on her way to London, Empress Elisabeth of Austria (known as &quot;Sisi&quot;), mother of Crown Prince Rudolf, stopped at the court of Brussels, where the 14-year-old Stéphanie was introduced to her. Already rumors about her possible marriage were swirling in Europe. Leopold II and Marie Henriette hoped to marry their second daughter to a reigning sovereign or a crown prince. The first candidate mentioned was King Alfonso XII of Spain, but this possibility was almost immediately denied.

Stéphanie had heard of Rudolf for the first time at the end of a literature class given by her housekeeper Fanny Brossel. After reading the story of William Tell, the teacher decided to teach her pupil about the power and grandeur of the House of Habsburg and illustrated her words by showing her an engraving published in a magazine depicting the Crown Prince in hunting costume. This was how Stéphanie discovered the features of the one who would become her fiancé.

During the winter of 1879–1880, Empress Elisabeth returned to Brussels. She was persuaded by the arguments of the court of Vienna which encouraged the Crown Prince to marry young in order to quickly ensure descendants. In March 1880 Rudolf was invited to the Belgian court at the insistence of Leopold II. After meeting the 15-year-old Princess Stéphanie, he wrote to his mother that &quot;[he had] found what [he] sought&quot;, noting that she was &quot;pretty, good, [and] clever&quot;. However, she was not Rudolf&#x27;s first choice as a potential bride: having refused Princess Mathilde of Saxony, as well as several Infantas of Portugal and Spain, he found that Stéphanie was one of the few Catholic princesses who met the criteria imposed by his father Emperor Franz Joseph I to become wife of the heir of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Under pressure from his parents to marry as soon as possible, the Crown Prince was satisfied with Stéphanie and on 5 March, he asked her parents for her hand. The reaction of Rudolf&#x27;s parents was mixed – while Empress Elisabeth was deeply disappointed with the match as the Belgian monarchy dated only from 1830 and did not compare to the Habsburgs in terms of seniority, even though its royal house was a branch of the House of Wettin (one of the oldest ruling houses in Europe), Emperor Franz Joseph I was pleased. For her part, Stéphanie remembered: &quot;In the afternoon of 5 March, my parents called me. When I made my entrance, my father stood up, came to me and said in a deep voice: &quot;The Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary has come here to ask for your hand. Your mother and I are all in favor of this marriage. We have chosen you to be Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary. Go away, think about it and give us your answer tomorrow&quot;.

====Engagement and marriage====

The betrothal was formalized on 7 March 1880, when Stéphanie was not yet 16 years old. Rudolf went to Brussels accompanied by an official suite of 21 people, and his current mistress. To his tutor, the Crown Prince confided, &quot;A new life will soon begin for me and I must admit that this worries me a little&quot;.

The Crown Prince was 21 years old at the time of the engagement. Declared an adult at the age of 19, he already had his own household. In 1879 he had moved to Prague Castle and assumed command of an infantry regiment, a post he liked very much. He was friendly with Princess Louise of Belgium, who had encouraged him to marry her younger sister. In anticipation of her establishment at the Austrian court, her mother Marie Henriette had warned Stéphanie: &quot;Avoid Louise, and if you see her, reason with her, show her a good example [...] Louise is not true. It costs nothing to lie or act. She is very frivolous&quot;. Rudolf&#x27;s personality was ambiguous: Often subject to mood swings, he suddenly passed from a melancholy state to an expansive joy, and he was aware of the duality of his temperament. Very young, he became a &quot;bon vivant&quot; and indulged in morally lax behaviour. The marriage was supposed to end his affairs. Countess Marie Larisch von Moennich, niece of Empress Elisabeth, had declared about Rudolph&#x27;s future fiancée: &quot;In advance, we had pity on the poor princess who would have the honor of being chosen&quot;.

The preparations for the wedding filled King Leopold II with pride. The Austrian Emperor added 148,000 guilders to the initial dowry of 100,000 florins, plus an annual sum of 100,000 florins for the duration of the marriage. Engaged, Stéphanie was dispatched to Vienna to be taught Imperial court etiquette in preparation for her marriage, and then had to attend all official receptions and dinners until her wedding, which was scheduled for 15 February 1881; however the wedding had to be deferred because Stéphanie had not yet reached puberty, and the bride was returned home for a while.

The marriage was finally celebrated on 10 May 1881, a few days before Stéphanie&#x27;s 17th birthday, at the Saint Augustine&#x27;s Church in Vienna. Four thrones were arranged under a canopy for the Belgian and Austrian sovereigns, with the bride being walked down the aisle by her parents. Foreign princes (among them the future King Edward VII of the United Kingdom and his nephew, the future German Emperor Wilhelm II) and members of the imperial family attended the celebrations, alongside members of the diplomatic corps and the Knights of the Golden Fleece. The church was so crowded that the wedding procession was hampered in its progress. Stéphanie remembered, &quot;Both of us pronounced the sacramental &#x27;yes&#x27;. We exchanged alliances [...]. The bells of the whole city rang to announce to the inhabitants of the capital the celebration of our solemn marriage. A long, cheerful noise arose from the crowd. Military bands played the hymns of the two countries. I was the Crown Princess of Austria-Hungary!&quot;. As a part of the wedding celebrations, the Emperor bestowed Walthère Frère-Orban with the Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary and the Empress bestowed several ladies with the Order of the Starry Cross.

====At the court of Vienna====

After the wedding night, which Stéphanie in her private letters revealed to her sister to have been a violent event by Rudolf, already mentally unstable, the couple honeymooned at Laxenburg outside the capital. Stéphanie was soon subjected to the questioning of her new family: At the court of Vienna, she had to live most of the time with them – walks, canoeing parties, invitations and parties were almost always held with the many members of the House of Habsburg. Her mother-in-law, Empress Elisabeth, nicknamed her &quot;the hideous dromedary&quot;; however, Stephanie began to enjoy her new position. During an official visit to Hungary in May 1881, she was given a standing ovation and began to see the advantages of her situation.

As in any dynastic marriage where the political interest of the two sovereign houses takes precedence, the existence of romantic feelings within the couple has never been proven, but the relationship of the young spouses was based, at the beginning, on respect and a mutual attachment. The spouses gave nicknames to each other respectively: &quot;Coco&quot; for Rudolf, and &quot;Coceuse&quot; for Stéphanie. Their understanding was real; Stéphanie described Rudolf as &quot;a model husband&quot; and added that they understood each other admirably, which made her happy. However, Stéphanie related that Rudolf was suspicious when she accompanied him. She was not allowed to leave the palace and remained subject to strict surveillance, so she took the opportunity to devote herself to drawing or painting.

From October 1881, Stéphanie replaced the Empress at official receptions. It was she who, at the request of her mother-in-law, now accompanied the Emperor and the Crown Prince on official trips and who received foreign sovereigns visiting the court. She entered the ballrooms on her father-in-law&#x27;s arm and served as the hostess at official dinners. Delighted to be released from the &quot;official duties&quot;, Empress Elisabeth withdrew from court, while Rudolf broke away from his wife to whom he became less and less warm.

In the autumn of 1881, Stéphanie thought she was pregnant, but it was a false alarm. After this disappointment, in the spring of 1883, the Crown Princess&#x27;s pregnancy was confirmed, delighting the Emperor. After this announcement, the Crown Prince once again became considerate and attentive to his wife. Both Stéphanie and Rudolf were sure it would be a boy; they even spoke of the future child by calling him &quot;Wenceslaus&quot; (&quot;Wacław&quot;), a Czech first name reflecting the sympathies of the Crown Prince for the Slavic populations of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

On 8 August, Queen Marie Henriette visited her daughter in anticipation of her childbirth. Stéphanie did not dare talk about her marital problems with her mother. The preparations for a princely birth obeyed protocol: prayers in churches and the exhibition of the Blessed Sacrament in the churches of the imperial palaces. On 2 September in the Laxenburg castles complex, Stéphanie gave birth to a daughter, Elisabeth Marie, known as &quot;Erzsi&quot; (short for &quot;Erzsébet&quot;, the Hungarian form of Elisabeth). Generously, Emperor Franz Joseph I showered the young mother and her family with gifts. When the sex of the child was announced to Rudolf, he did not hide his disappointment at not having been given an heir to Austria-Hungary Empire, but he got used to his role of father and gave, in his correspondence, many details about the newborn girl. While Stéphanie blossomed in her new role of mother, this birth marked the beginning of deep marital difficulties.

====Rudolf&#x27;s disease and its consequences====

In Prague and Vienna, the couple received many visitors and gave many dinners. Stéphanie had a high idea of her rank and strove to fully assume the role conferred on her by her title, because the Empress had fled Vienna to travel frequently through Europe. For his part, Rudolf, who disapproved of his father&#x27;s policies, developed friendships among opponents of the monarchy and anonymously published his political opinions in the &quot;Neues Wiener Tagblatt&quot;, edited by his friend Moritz Szeps. At the beginning of 1886, the Crown Prince fell seriously ill. Several diagnoses included cystitis and stomach disease. These were only intended to hide the true nature of the disease which affected him – he had actually contracted a venereal disease, (possibly gonorrhea), during his extramarital affairs. Doctors, fearing syphilis, used the approaches then used to treat the latter, namely opium, cognac, morphine, as well as mercury which, taken at too high a dose, can lead to psychological consequences.

In order to take care of himself, Rudolf left to stay on the island of Lokrum, where he took Stéphanie. No one had informed the Crown Princess of the nature of the illness from which her husband was suffering. When she felt the first effects herself, doctors mentioned peritonitis. The consequences of this lie were dramatic: when the couple tried to conceive another child, Stéphanie, who was not yet 22 years old, found it that she was sterile. From that moment, feeling betrayed by her own husband, Stéphanie harbored resentment and bitterness towards Rudolf. She refused to resume her conjugal life with a husband who did not return until dawn, and disillusioned and undermined by a feeling of failure, had sunk into debauchery. Despite Rudolf&#x27;s attempts to reconcile with his wife, their quarrel seemed deep. During a visit to the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria in 1887, Stéphanie fell in love with the Polish Count Artur Władysław Potocki. During the next eighteen months, she did not try to hide her affections for the Count from her husband, who continued his own liaisons.

From the spring of 1887, painful scenes were repeated between the spouses. Rudolf began to lose control of himself: suffering from deep fits of melancholy and mania he spoke in front of whoever wanted to hear him the presentiment of his imminent death. During the summer of 1888, Stéphanie noticed a disturbing change in the general condition of the Crown Prince: his increasingly angry character led him to continued public outbursts of extreme violence.

====The Mayerling incident====
In October 1888, Stéphanie, worried about the depressive – even suicidal – tendencies of her husband, went to the Emperor Franz Joseph I to alert him, without succeeding in convincing him. She remembers: &quot;The Emperor greeted me cordially. I began by telling him that Rudolf was very ill and that his pathetic appearance and his dissipated behavior caused me serious concern; I begged him to make his son take a long journey so as to distract him from his grueling existence. But the Emperor interrupted me: &quot;It is your imagination that creates ghosts for you. Rudolf is doing very well. He looks a little tired, he is too often on the road, he exerts himself too much. He should stay more with you; but have no fear!&quot;.

Rudolf pursued other connections, in particular with the 17-year-old Baroness Marie Vetsera from around April 1888. Stéphanie became a widow at the age of 24 when, on 30 January 1889, her husband was found dead in strange circumstances with his mistress Baroness Vetsera, both shot dead, at the Mayerling hunting lodge. The apparent suicide of the Crown Prince deeply affected Stéphanie and constituted, in the words of Irmgard Schiel, &quot;the greatest catastrophe that can affect a woman in her married life&quot;. To Stéphanie, Rudolf had left an undated letter: &quot;Dear Stéphanie, you are delivered from my fatal presence; be happy in your destiny. Be good to the poor little one who is the only thing left of me. [...] I calmly enter death which alone can save my good reputation. Kissing you with all my heart, your Rudolf who loves you&quot;.

===Dowager Crown Princess===

After Rudolf&#x27;s death, Stéphanie had only one thought: to leave Vienna and the heavy atmosphere of the court. She wished to go to her parents in Brussels, but neither Leopold II nor Franz Joseph I would allow Stephanie, who had become a Dowager Crown Princess, to abandon Austria. As guardian of his 5-year-old granddaughter Elisabeth Marie, the Emperor demanded that Stéphanie remain with her child. Stéphanie had to obey and obtained permission to stay for four months at Miramare Castle, near Trieste. At the start of her widowhood, Stéphanie led a rather withdrawn life. Over the years, the separations from her daughter became more and more frequent, so a fulfilling relationship with her daughter did not last.

During this time, Stéphanie continued her romantic relationship with Count Potocki, whom she had nicknamed &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Widowed since 1881, he was Chamberlain at the court of Vienna and a life member of the House of Lords in the Austrian Parliament. Only her sister Louise was informed of the affair. Artur Potocki remained close to Stéphanie during the dark days following Rudolf&#x27;s death. However, the health of the Count, who was not yet 40, was so bad that he lost the ability to speak after surgery due to laryngeal cancer. In March 1890, Potocki died and Stéphanie once again went into a deep grieving.

At the court of Vienna, Stéphanie had to endure the coldness of Empress Elisabeth, who avoided her, and the equally distant attitude adopted by Emperor Franz Joseph I. Although she retained her title of Crown Princess, she did not retain its functions and was no longer authorized to represent the Empress. Her role was limited, and she could no longer count on the support of many friends. She traveled a lot and devoted herself to painting. Her watercolors painted in Lacroma were published as an album in 1892. In Austria, Stéphanie devoted herself to singing or went to the theater and concerts during her stays in her residences in Laxenburg and at the Hofburg.

Until 1898, Stéphanie undertook long journeys each year: Corfu, Malta, Tunis and Sicily in 1892; the Nordic countries the following year; North Africa, the Balearic Islands and Corsica in 1894; Greece and Palestine in 1895; and Russia in 1897. In March 1898, an illness forced her to give up traveling – she suffered from pneumonia and pleurisy, which forced her to remain bedridden for some time. This gave rise to fears for her life before she suddenly recovered. On 10 September 1898, Empress Elisabeth was assassinated in Geneva; even though she had never managed to get closer to her mother-in-law, Stéphanie was very affected by this unexpected death.

===A new life===
====A marriage of inclination====

Emperor Franz Joseph I and King Leopold II of Belgium cherished the plan to remarry Stéphanie with Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austria-Hungary Empire after the death of Rudolf. However, the latter harbored other marriage plans with Countess Sophie Chotek von Wognin, the daughter of Bohuslav, Count Chotek, Austrian ambassador to Stuttgart, St. Petersburg and Brussels, and lady-in-waiting to Archduchess Isabella of Austria, Duchess of Teschen.

For her part, Stéphanie planned to marry an aristocrat: Count Elemér Lónyay de Nagy-Lónya et Vásáros-Namény, a Hungarian nobleman of lower rank, of Protestant faith, and one year older than her. After studying law in Budapest, he had entered diplomatic service. In 1886, he was appointed counselor of the legation. He worked in Bucharest, then in Saint Petersburg and Brussels. In 1890, he became imperial and royal Chamberlain at the Austrian court. Promoted to embassy secretary in 1892, he worked in Saint Petersburg, Paris, London and Stuttgart. He then took advantage of a year&#x27;s leave to travel to Africa and the Mediterranean countries. In 1895, he accompanied Archduke Louis Victor as a member of the imperial legation during the coronation of Tsar Nicolas II in Saint Petersburg. In 1896 he and his brother Gábor were raised to the dignity of Count. In 1897, he resigned from the foreign service and retired from the public service. In order to be able to marry Stéphanie, he converted to Catholicism.

Stéphanie did not dare to forewarn her father of her marriage plans. She chose to address herself by letter, in October 1899, to Queen Victoria who supported her. However, the King of Belgium refused to see his daughter marry a man of lower rank. Stéphanie received a negative response from Leopold II: &quot;My father answered me in the severest and harshest terms that he refused me his consent. Queen Victoria&#x27;s letter had missed its mark. He gave her, too, an extremely lively answer, in which he even hinted that she had better not interfere in matters which did not concern her&quot;. The Belgian sovereigns, offended that Stéphanie did not primarily speak to them about her matrimonial projects, severed any relationship with their daughter and forbade her to return to Belgium. Leopold II even planned to withdraw the title of Royal Highness from his second daughter, but court jurists demonstrated the impossibility of this. The King forbade his youngest daughter Clémentine to correspond with Stéphanie and threatened to abolish the annual annuity of 50,000 francs which she received, although Franz Joseph I advised him against it.

On 22 March 1900 at Miramare Castle and after eleven years of widowhood, Stéphanie married Count Elemér Lónyay de Nagy-Lónya and Vásáros-Namény. The Emperor reluctantly gave his authorization, but Stéphanie lost her rank and her imperial titles by remarrying, while her daughter Elisabeth Marie remained in Vienna in her grandfather&#x27;s guardianship. The former Crown Princess&#x27;s household was dissolved: all those who were part of it were dismissed, but some of them were assigned to her daughter&#x27;s service. The patronages exerted by Stéphanie were withdrawn from her, and she thus received an annual pension of 100,000 guilders. Her new husband, for his part, had an annual income of 50,000 guilders.

The Austrian press, and in particular the journal &quot;Die Presse&quot;, saw in this marriage a &quot;certain marvelous romanticism in the act which the princess poses [because] the latter closed on her the portal of the Hofburg, at the same time thoughtful and the glance full of promising images, then went south where she will soon cease to be Princess Dowager&quot;. The new spouses initially settled at the Palais Zichy in Vienna.

====Family affairs====

Two years after her mother&#x27;s remarriage, Archduchess Elisabeth Marie (who at some point was considered as a potential bride for several princes in Europe, among them her cousin Prince Albert, heir presumptive to the throne of Belgium, and the German Crown Prince) married on 23 January 1902 Prince Otto Weriand of Windisch-Graetz, an Austrian prince born in a former Sovereign family (until the German mediatisation) and officer, despite the objections of her grandfather Emperor Franz Joseph I, who later gave his consent. A few months later, in September, while staying in London, Stéphanie learned of the death of her mother, Queen Marie Henriette, who was living withdrawn from the Belgian court. Immediately, she left for Spa to pay a last tribute to her mother. However, King Leopold II was still so furious with his daughter&#x27;s unequal marriage that he forbade Stéphanie to attend the funeral service, and she was finally forced a few days later to return to London.

When King Leopold II himself died on 17 December 1909, Stéphanie had just, two days earlier, been refused a final meeting with the monarch. Her sister Louise returned to Belgium as well, and the dying sovereign also refused to see her. Stéphanie and her sisters discovered that their father had left as main beneficiary of his will his chief mistress, the French prostitute Caroline Lacroix, as well as the Royal Trust. He also deliberately concealed property included in his estate in shell companies in Germany and France, not only to deprive his daughters of it, but also to allow his town-planning projects to continue. The Belgian state offered a financial transaction to the three princesses, who would each receive a sum of two million francs. While Stéphanie and Clémentine accepted the proposal, Louise refused it and initiated, in December 1910, a first trial against the Belgian State and her two sisters. In April 1911, Louise initiated a second lawsuit concerning the French companies created by Leopold II. In 1912, Louise and Stéphanie, who had now become her ally, were defended by Henri Jaspar and Paul-Émile Janson, and Louise persevered in her legal actions. The two princesses refused a new amicable agreement with the State, before their action was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in April 1913. However, on 22 January 1914, an agreement was concluded between Louise, the Belgian State and some of her creditors: She received, like her two sisters, a little more than five million francs from their late father&#x27;s fortune.

====Peaceful life in Hungary====

In January 1906, Stéphanie and Elemér bought the Rusovce Mansion in Hungary (now in Slovakia) in order to establish permanent residence there. The neoclassical-style building is located in an area of over 2,400 hectares, consisting of an English-style park, planted with purple beeches, silver fir trees and multiple decorative species, which extends over both banks of the Danube. They received many guests there, including Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his morganatic wife, still ostracized by the court of Vienna, and writers, such as the pacifist Bertha von Suttner. Renovation was required for the residence, which comprised 200 rooms. Elemér exhibited his artistic collections there, including antique furniture, paintings by old and modern masters, as well as precious porcelain. Stéphanie and her husband created three gardens: a rose garden, an alpine garden, and another of Dutch inspiration. Irmgard Schiel wrote, &quot;The princess was at the same time a lord, mistress of the house, manager of the estate, garden architect and hostess&quot;.

====World War I====

When Stéphanie learned of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914, she was convinced that the death of the heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne was desired by Emperor Franz Joseph I because the deceased had dared to stand up to him. Stéphanie claimed to have warned the victims because the Emperor knew the danger that his nephew was running. Four weeks later, war broke out. With Hungary not yet undergoing many hardships, Stéphanie set up a makeshift dispensary in the Rusovce house, while Elemér accepted a management position in the Austrian Red Cross which took him to Romania and Serbia. Stéphanie worked as a nurse in her residence.

In November 1916, the health of Emperor Franz Joseph I was declining, and his family came to see him. Stéphanie left Hungary for Vienna, where the Emperor died of bronchitis and pneumonia at the age of 86 on 21 November 1916 after a reign of 68 years. Stéphanie and her daughter Elisabeth Marie attended the funeral, which took place nine days later. On this occasion, the Habsburg monarchy unfolded its full splendor for the last time. The new Emperor Charles I led the funeral procession, which included representatives of the Allied Powers, all German princes, and the members of the House of Habsburg. In the choir of St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral, the new Emperor and his wife Empress Zita took a prominent place alongside the foreign rulers, and behind them stood their close family relatives. Stéphanie and her daughter were placed in the third row. Finally, the remains of Franz Joseph I were placed next to his wife and son in the Imperial Crypt in the center of Vienna.

The new emperor on 28 January 1917 granted the title of Hungarian &quot;Fürst&quot; (Prince) with the style of Serene Highness to Elemér. After the armistice of 11 November 1918, the Austro-Hungarian Empire ceased to exist. In March 1919, the whole imperial family had to leave Austria. However this measure did not apply to Stéphanie nor her daughter, who were excluded from the House of Habsburg following their marriages.

====Between wars====

Until World War II, Prince and Princess Lónyay peacefully spent their lives at Rusovce. In the years following the end of the World War I, Elisabeth Marie (who resided with her family in Schönau an der Triesting, Lower Austria) and her mother still had strong feelings for each other. This tenderness was expressed especially in their correspondence because it was difficult to travel to Rusovce. However, in 1922, Stéphanie was delighted to receive her two eldest grandsons, Franz Joseph and Ernst Weriand of Windisch-Graetz. The teenagers, however, were eager to return to their home because their grandmother&#x27;s attitudes were very different from what they were used to. Stéphanie&#x27;s last letter to her daughter dated from 1924, the year in which Erzsi had just obtained a divorce &quot;a mensa et thoro&quot; from her husband. The following year, Elisabeth Marie participated in her mother&#x27;s silver wedding anniversary. Thereafter, mother and daughter did not see each other at all. According to her granddaughter-in-law, author Ghislaine of Windisch-Graetz (née d&#x27;Arschot Schoonhoven), Stéphanie &quot;was confused in devotion and even bigoted; she was convinced that her daughter was possessed by the demon and she could not tolerate the immorality of her love life. As the reprobation seemed insufficient to her, she preferred to stay away, pray for her daughter and ask priests to join their prayers to hers.

In 1923, Stéphanie planned to write her memoirs. To do this, she chose to collaborate with Egon Corti, a biographer recognized in particular for his work on the historical figures of the House of Habsburg. The writer stayed in Rusovce eleven times. The collaboration was, however, abruptly interrupted in 1933 by Stéphanie, who wrote to Corti: &quot;For the sake of the imperial family, I decided to give up publishing my memoirs in the form that had been initially planned [...]. I see myself constrained to limit myself to my own notes, as well as to my personal memories, in which your contributions and your modifications do not find their place&quot;. Corti being excluded from the literary project, Stéphanie addressed Count and Countess Gatterburg, who submitted the manuscript first to a publisher in Leipzig in 1933. The latter considered that the manuscript was not complete enough and that its publication would be detrimental to the author. Another publishing house, John Murray of London, also rejected the text received. Finally, the Koehler &amp; Amelang house in Leipzig agreed to publish the book and have it published simultaneously in Europe and New York. The publishing contract was drawn up on 24 April 1934, but Stéphanie&#x27;s procrastination postponed the publication and distribution of her memoirs to October 1935, under the original title of &quot;Ich sollte Kaiserin werden&quot; (I Was To Be Empress) in German bookstores, because the book was censored in Austria, where the police visited every bookshop in Vienna in order to seize the copies already on sale. In the book she published Rudolf&#x27;s last letter to her, and proclaimed that (in her view) he and Baroness Vetsera had made a suicide pact. The work appeared in a French version in 1937 in Brussels under the title: &quot;Je devais être impératrice&quot; (I Had To Be Empress), and the same year was finally authorized to be published in Austria under the original title.

===Last years and death===

As long as they maintained satisfactory health, Stéphanie and Elemér traveled and met various exiled rulers: the deposed Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria and the Empress Zita. They met the latter in Spain, and then in Belgium where Ferdinand had been exiled since 1930. Gradually, they withdrew to their estate where they led a more secluded existence, punctuated by religious exercises. Among their closest acquaintances figured, from 1944, their chaplain, Geza Karsai, Germanist, university professor and monk of the Pannonhalma Archabbey.

In July 1944, Stéphanie drew up her will. She disinherited her daughter, who had divorced Prince Otto of Windisch-Graetz to live with Leopold Petznek, a Social Democratic deputy from Lower Austria, and bequeathed all of her real estate to the order of the Benedictines. In return, the Benedictines were responsible for meeting all the debts of the Lónyays and managing their estates. The year 1944 brought new worries to Stéphanie and her husband because the German Army wanted to transform their residence into a military hospital for war wounded, a project which was rejected at the last minute. On the other hand, in the autumn, Edmund Veesenmayer, SS &quot;Brigadeführer&quot;, and commander of the city of Budapest, took up quarters in Rusovce accompanied by a large staff. Veesenmayer began to search all the archives in the house and confiscated documents of a historical nature, such as letters from Crown Prince Rudolf. Stéphanie and Elemér were forced to take refuge in a few rooms because the occupants had appropriated most of the castle. At the end of March 1945, the Germans, realizing that their position was threatened by the advancing Red Army, traveled further west.

On 2 April 1945, it was the Red Army, having just launched a last offensive pushing back the Germans near Lake Balaton, which reached the Rusovce mansion. During the first weeks of the Soviet occupation, the Lónyays preferred to stay at home with a few servants. However, in May, Stéphanie (suffering from heart disease) and her husband left their residence to take refuge in the Pannonhalma Archabbey, protected by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Three months later, on 23 August 1945, Stephanie died there of a stroke, aged 81. Neither her daughter nor any of her descendants were present at her funeral. She was buried in the crypt of Pannonhalma Archabbey. Elemér survived her less than a year, dying on 29 July 1946, and was buried next to her.

==Aftermath==
Stéphanie&#x27;s only daughter, Archduchess Elisabeth Marie, finally obtained a divorce from her husband, Prince Otto Weriand of Windisch-Graetz in early 1948 and on 4 May of that year, she married her longtime partner Petznek in a registry office in Vienna. Estranged from her four children (of whom two died before her), after Leopold Petznek&#x27;s death in 1956 from a heart attack, Elisabeth Marie (confined to a wheelchair due to gout) became reclusive until her death on 16 March 1963 at the Windisch-Graetz Villa in Hütteldorf, Vienna and was buried in an unmarked tomb (only recognized by the burial codification group 2, number G72) at the Hütteldorfer cemetery next to her husband; near her were buried her two sons who predeceased her, Rudolf and Ernst. Like her mother before her, she also disinherited her two surviving children: she left some 500 heirlooms, owned by the Habsburg Imperial family and inherited by her, to the Republic of Austria, and the extensive park of her Windisch-Graetz villa, in a prime Viennese residential area, was willed to the city of Vienna for the construction of a new residential complex.

From her first marriage, Elisabeth Marie had had four children:

* Prince Franz Joseph of Windisch-Graetz (; born Prague 22 March 1904 – died Nairobi 1 January 1981), married in Brussels on 3 January 1934 with Countess Ghislaine d&#x27;Arschot Schoonhoven (who wrote a biography of her mother-in-law named &quot;L&#x27;archiduchesse rouge: La vie d&#x27;Élisabeth-Marie, orpheline de Mayerling&quot; [The Red Archduchess: The Life of Elisabeth-Marie, Orphan of Mayerling] in which her grandmother-in-law Stéphanie is often mentioned). They had two children.
* Prince Ernst of Windisch-Graetz (; born Prague 21 April 1905 – died Vienna 21 December 1952), married firstly in Vienna on 17 October 1927 (divorced 1938, annulled 1940) Ellen (Helena) Skinner, and secondly in Schwarzenbach an der Pielach, Lower Austria, on 11 May 1947 Baroness Eva von Isbary. With issue in both marriages.
* Prince Rudolph of Windisch-Graetz (; born Ploskovice 4 February 1907 – died Vienna 14 June 1930).
* Princess Stephanie of Windisch-Graetz (; born Ploskovice 9 July 1909 – died at Uccle 7 September 2005), married firstly in Brussels on 22 July 1933 Count Pierre d&#x27;Alcantara di Querrieu, and secondly in Brussels on 14 November 1945 Carl Axel Björklund. With issue in both marriages.

As of 2021, Stéphanie had eight great-grandchildren, 24 great-great-grandchildren and 32 great-great-great-grandchildren.

==Invention==
As the &quot;New York Times&quot; noted, Stéphanie &quot;invented a new chafing dish and spirit lamp combined, and [took] out patents in England, France, Germany, Italy, and Belgium&quot;. Her 1908 decision to take out a US patent on a chafing dish surprised the &quot;New York Times&quot;, not because of her lineage but because &quot;throughout Europe the proficiency of Columbia’s daughters with the chafing dish is traditional…&quot;.

<text>Civil rights leaders are influential figures in the promotion and implementation of political freedom 
and the expansion of personal civil liberties and rights. They work to protect individuals and groups from political repression and discrimination by governments and private organizations, and seek to ensure the ability of all members of society to participate in the civil and political life of the state.

<text>François Just Marie Raynouard (18 September 1761 – 27 October 1836) was a French dramatist and linguist.

==Biography==
Raynouard was born at Brignoles in Provence, trained for the bar, and practiced at Draguignan. In 1791 he represented the department of Var in the Legislative Assembly, but after the fall of his party, the Girondists, he went into hiding. Discovered and imprisoned in Paris, he wrote his play &quot;Caton d&#x27;Utique&quot; (1794) during his imprisonment.

In 1803 he won the Institut de France&#x27;s poetry prize. &quot;Éléonore de Bavière&quot; and &quot;Les Templiers&quot; were accepted by the Comédie-Française. &quot;Les Templiers&quot; was produced in 1805, and, over the opposition of Geoffroy, was a great success. Elected to the Académie française in 1807, elected to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1816, Raynouard was admitted &quot;secrétaire perpétuel&quot; of the Académie française in 1817. From 1806 to 1814 he represented the department of Var in the Corps législatif. 

Raynouard wrote other plays, one of which, &quot;Les États de Blois&quot; (acted 1810), offended Napoleon by its freedom of speech. Realizing that the public taste had changed and that Romanticism would triumph, Raynouard abandoned the stage and devoted himself to linguistic studies. His researches into Provençal were to an extent inaccurate, but his enthusiasm and perseverance opened the way for the study of the subject.

Raynouard is sometimes called the founder of Romance linguistics, although his contribution was marked by a fundamental misconception: he believed that the Romance languages were derived from a common post-Latin language, which he called &quot;le roman&quot;, and not directly from Latin, as is in fact the case. Raynouard&#x27;s chief works are &quot;Choix de poésies originales des troubadours&quot; (6 vols., 1816–1821), of which the sixth volume, &quot;Grammaire comparée des langues de l&#x27;Europe latine, dans leurs rapports avec la langue des troubadours&quot; (1821), was separately published; &quot;Lexique roman ou dictionnaire de la langue des troubadours comparée avec les autres langues de l&#x27;Europe latine&quot; (6 vols., 1838–1844). He spent the last years of his life at Passy.

Raynouard was Officer of the Legion of Honour. In the 16th arrondissement of Paris, a street and a square have been named after him. In Brignoles, a monument pays tribute to him near the house he was born in, and the secondary school (&quot;lycée&quot;) and a boulevard have been named after him.

<text>Pioneer Square is a neighborhood in the southwest corner of downtown Seattle, Washington, US. It was once the heart of the city: Seattle&#x27;s founders settled there in 1852, following a brief six-month settlement at Alki Point on the far side of Elliott Bay. The early structures in the neighborhood were mostly wooden, and nearly all burned in the Great Seattle Fire of 1889. By the end of 1890, dozens of brick and stone buildings had been erected in their stead; to this day, the architectural character of the neighborhood derives from these late 19th century buildings, mostly examples of Richardsonian Romanesque.

The neighborhood takes its name from a small triangular plaza near the corner of First Avenue and Yesler Way, originally known as Pioneer Place. The Pioneer Square–Skid Road Historic District, a historic district including that plaza and several surrounding blocks, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Like virtually all Seattle neighborhoods, the Pioneer Square neighborhood lacks definitive borders. It is bounded roughly by Alaskan Way S. on the west, beyond which are the docks of Elliott Bay; by S. King Street on the south, beyond which is SoDo; by 5th Avenue S. on the east, beyond which is the International District; and it extends between one and two blocks north of Yesler Way, beyond which is the rest of Downtown. Because Yesler Way marks the boundary between two different plats, the street grid north of Yesler does not line up with the neighborhood&#x27;s other streets (nor with the compass), so the northern border of the district zigzags along numerous streets.

In some places, the Pioneer Square–Skid Road Historic District extends beyond these borders. It includes Union Station east of 4th Avenue S., and several city blocks south of S. King Street.

==History==

===Early history===
The settlement&#x27;s importance was guaranteed in 1852, when Henry Yesler chose the site for his lumber mill, which was located on Elliott Bay at the foot of what is now Yesler Way, right on the border between the land claimed (and soon thereafter platted) by David Swinson &quot;Doc&quot; Maynard (to the south) and that platted by Arthur Denny and Carson Boren.

Much of the neighborhood is on landfill: in pioneer times, the area roughly between First and Second Avenue, bounded on the south by Jackson Street, and extending north almost to Yesler Way (about two-and-a-half city blocks) was a low-lying offshore island. The mainland shore roughly followed what is now Yesler Way to about Fourth Avenue, then ran southeast, at an angle of about 45 degrees to the current shoreline. Slightly inland were steep bluffs, which were largely smoothed away by regrading in the late 19th and early 20th century.

===&quot;Below the Line&quot;===
Yesler Way, originally Mill Street, is the main east–west street through the Pioneer Square neighborhood. Immediately south of the square itself, it was the dividing line between Maynard&#x27;s original claim (to the south) and Boren&#x27;s (to the north). It became Deadline, the northern border of the Great Restricted District, Maynardtown, Down on the Sawdust, the Lava Beds, the Tenderloin, White Chapel, or Wappyville, (after Charles Wappenstein, after a particularly corrupt police chief.), where low entertainment and vice were long tolerated. One of the earliest names, and one that stuck well into second half of the 20th century, was &quot;Skid Row&quot;.

Henry Broderick, approaching his 80th birthday in 1959, wrote of the neighborhood south of Yesler, &quot;[P]erhaps never in all history, certainly not in America, has there ever existed such a massive collection of the grouped in a restricted area.&quot; There were &quot;parlor houses&quot; with marquees, celebrity madames—among them Lou Graham, Lila Young, and Raw McRoberts—and piano &quot;professors&quot;. Scrupulous in their dealings, the parlor houses were completely tolerated by the city at the time, but there were also the far more controversial &quot;crib houses&quot; such as the Midway, the Paris and Dreamland near the corner of Sixth Avenue South and King Street. Each had a hundred or more cubicles—&quot;cribs&quot;—and they were not known for any particular honesty in their dealings. The city health department conducted inspections and attempted to keep venereal disease under control, but the state of medicine at the time was not such as to give them any great chance of success. Besides the brothels there were &quot;an ungodly mixture of dives, dumps... pawnshops, hash houses, dope parlors and... the et cetera that kept the police guessing.&quot; Box houses prospered, part theater, part bar, part brothel, as did all sorts of gambling. Police only dared enter the neighborhood in teams. Perhaps the only safe haven in the neighborhood was the saloon &quot;Our House&quot;, which rented out safe deposit boxes.

In 1870, Father Francis Xavier Prefontaine founded Seattle&#x27;s first Catholic Church, the Church of Our Lady of Good Help in the heart of this district, at Third Avenue South and Washington Street. Two decades later, Lou Graham opened the city&#x27;s most famous parlor house diagonally across the street. Father Prefontaine is commemorated by a street in the neighborhood, Prefontaine Place.

===Late 19th century===
By the end of 1889, Seattle had become the largest city in Washington with 40,000 residents. That same year, the Great Seattle Fire resulted in the complete destruction of Pioneer Square. However, the economy was strong at the time, so Pioneer Square was quickly rebuilt. Many of the new buildings show the influence of the Romanesque Revival architectural mode, although influence of earlier Victorian modes is also widespread. Because of drainage problems new development was built at a higher level literally burying the remains of old Pioneer Square. Anticipating the planned regrade, many buildings were built with two entrances, one at the old, low level, and another higher up. Visitors can take the Seattle Underground Tour to see what remains of the old storefronts.

Just before the fire, cable car service was instituted from Pioneer Square along Yesler Way to Lake Washington and the Leschi neighborhood.

In 1891, German-born Frederick Trump, President Donald Trump&#x27;s grandfather, owned the Dairy Restaurant on Washington Street.

===20th century===
During the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897 and 1898, Seattle was a center for travel to Alaska. Thousands of so-called &quot;stampeders&quot; passed through Seattle, making the city&#x27;s merchants prosperous.

In 1899, a group of citizens stole a Tlingit totem pole and placed it in Pioneer Place Park. After the Tlingit demanded compensation for the theft, the group&#x27;s organizers agreed to pay a settlement of $500. When an arsonist severely damaged the pole in 1938, the U.S. Forest Service hired a group of Tlingit artisans through the Civilian Conservation Corps to craft a replacement that was installed in 1940.

In addition to the totem pole, an iron and glass pergola designed by Julian F. Everett as part of a lavish underground comfort station and a bust of Chief Seattle were added to the park in 1909.

1914 saw the completion of the Smith Tower, which at the time was the tallest building west of the Mississippi River. However, by that time, the heart of Downtown Seattle had moved north. The building of Second Avenue Extension in 1928-29 reconfigured the eastern portion of the neighborhood, by extending a piece of the north-of-Yesler street grid south past Yesler and &quot;slicing into buildings in its path&quot;. The cable car line serving the area was shut down on August 10, 1940.

====1960s====
In the 1960s, Pioneer Square became a target of urban renewal. One proposal was to replace the buildings with parking garages to serve Downtown Seattle. In 1962, the historic Seattle Hotel was replaced with one such parking garage, commonly referred to as the &quot;Sinking Ship&quot; garage because of its appearance when viewed from 1st and Yesler; it stands to this day. Another proposal was to build a ring road which would have required destroying many of Pioneer Square&#x27;s buildings. Many buildings were saved by the &quot;benign neglect&quot; of landowner Sam Israel. Although he rarely sold any of his buildings, he sold the Union Trust Building to architect Ralph Anderson, whose rehabilitation of that building set the pattern for the neighborhood&#x27;s rehabilitation. In 1970, preservationists such as Bill Speidel, Victor Steinbrueck, and others succeeded in listing the neighborhood as historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Later that year, Pioneer Square became a city preservation district.

====1980s====
Streetcar service returned to Pioneer Square on May 29, 1982, with the opening of the Waterfront Streetcar. The streetcar discontinued service on November 19, 2005, since its carbarn was razed to make room for the Olympic Sculpture Park.

===21st century===
In the 21st century, Pioneer Square is home to art galleries, internet companies, cafés, sports bars, nightclubs, bookstores, and a unit of the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park, the other unit of which is located in Skagway, Alaska.

==Public art==

=== Forest For The Trees ===

This public art initiative developed by ARTXIV in collaboration with the nonprofit Forest for the Trees, aimed at transforming Seattle&#x27;s historic Pioneer Square into a year-round open-air gallery. The project features framed artworks displayed on building facades and in alleyways, blending contemporary art with the district&#x27;s architectural heritage. The initiative supports artists through a commission-based model, with proceeds from artwork sales reinvested to sustain future installations. By integrating art into the urban environment, the project enhances community engagement and expands public access to creative expression.

=== Fallen Firefighters Memorial ===

Each spring since 1989, on the weekend nearest June 6, the city has celebrated the &quot;Pioneer Square Fire Festival&quot; with a parade and display of antique and modern fire apparatus, demonstrations of fire fighter skills, food and craft booths, and a party. On June 6, 1998, the anniversary of the 1889 fire, fell on a Saturday. This year the Festival took on additional meaning when the Fallen Fire Fighter Memorial was dedicated. Thanks to the work of Battalion Chief Wes Goss and his Memorial Committee the bronze sculpture was now in place. On a granite block is inscribed the name of each Seattle fire fighter who died in the line of duty.

<text>Julien Louis Geoffroy (; 17 August 1743 – 27 February 1814) was a French literary critic.

He was born at Rennes, and educated there and at the Collège Louis le Grand in Paris. He took orders and for some time was a mere usher, eventually becoming professor of rhetoric at the Collège des Quatre-Nations. His tragedy, &quot;Caton&quot;, was accepted at the Théâtre Français, but was never performed. On the death of Élie Fréron in 1776 the other collaborators in the &quot;Année littéraire&quot; asked Geoffroy to succeed him, and he conducted the journal until its closure in 1792.

Geoffroy was a bitter critic of Voltaire and his followers, and made for himself many enemies. An enthusiastic royalist, he published, with Fréron&#x27;s brother-in-law, the abbé (1741–1792), a journal, &quot;L&#x27;Ami du roi&quot; (1790–1792), which possibly did more harm than good to the king&#x27;s cause by its ill-advised partisanship. During the Reign of Terror, Geoffroy hid in the neighbourhood of Paris, only returning in 1799.

An attempt to revive the &quot;Année littéraire&quot; failed, and Geoffroy undertook the position of theatre critic of the &quot;Journal des Débats&quot;. His scathing criticisms had a success of notoriety, but their popularity was ephemeral, and the publication of them (5 vols., 1819–1820) as &quot;Cours de littérature dramatique&quot; proved a failure. He was also the author of a perfunctory &quot;Commentaire&quot; on the works of Jean Racine prefixed to Lenormant&#x27;s edition (1808).

<text>An email address identifies an email box to which messages are delivered. While early messaging systems used a variety of formats for addressing, today, email addresses follow a set of specific rules originally standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in the 1980s, and updated by . The term email address in this article refers to just the &quot;addr-spec&quot; in Section 3.4 of . The RFC defines &quot;address&quot; more broadly as either a &quot;mailbox&quot; or &quot;group&quot;. A &quot;mailbox&quot; value can be either a &quot;name-addr&quot;, which contains a &quot;display-name&quot; and &quot;addr-spec&quot;, or the more common &quot;addr-spec&quot; alone.

An email address, such as &quot;john.smith@example.com&quot;, is made up from a local-part, the symbol @, and a &quot;domain&quot;, which may be a domain name or an IP address enclosed in brackets. Although the standard requires the local-part to be case-sensitive, it also urges that receiving hosts deliver messages in a case-independent manner, e.g., that the mail system in the domain &quot;example.com&quot; treat &quot;John.Smith&quot; as equivalent to &quot;john.smith&quot;; some mail systems even treat them as equivalent to &quot;johnsmith&quot;. Mail systems often limit the users&#x27; choice of name to a subset of the technically permitted characters; with the introduction of internationalized domain names, efforts are progressing to permit non-ASCII characters in email addresses.

Due to the ubiquity of email in today&#x27;s world, email addresses are often used as regular usernames by many websites and services that provide a user profile or account. For example, if a user wants to login to their Xbox Live video gaming profile, they would use their Microsoft account in the form of an email address as the username ID, even though the service in this case is not email.

== Message transport ==

An email address consists of two parts, a local-part (sometimes a user name, but not always) and a domain; if the domain is a domain name rather than an IP address then the SMTP client uses the domain name to look up the mail exchange IP address. The general format of an email address is &quot;local-part&quot;@&quot;domain&quot;, e.g. jsmith@[192.168.1.2], &quot;jsmith@example.com&quot;. The SMTP client transmits the message to the mail exchange, which may forward it to another mail exchange until it eventually arrives at the host of the recipient&#x27;s mail system.

The transmission of electronic mail from the author&#x27;s computer and between mail hosts in the Internet uses the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), defined in , and extensions such as . The mailboxes may be accessed and managed by applications on personal computers, mobile devices or webmail sites, using the SMTP protocol and either the Post Office Protocol (POP) or the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP).

When transmitting email messages, mail user agents (MUAs) and mail transfer agents (MTAs) use the domain name system (DNS) to look up a Resource Record (RR) for the recipient&#x27;s domain. A mail exchanger resource record (MX record) contains the name of the recipient&#x27;s mailserver. In absence of an MX record, an address record (A or AAAA) directly specifies the mail host.

The local-part of an email address has no significance for intermediate mail relay systems other than the final mailbox host. Email senders and intermediate relay systems must not assume it to be case-insensitive, since the final mailbox host may or may not treat it as such. A single mailbox may receive mail for multiple email addresses, if configured by the administrator. Conversely, a single email address may be the alias to a distribution list to many mailboxes. Email aliases, electronic mailing lists, sub-addressing, and catch-all addresses, the latter being mailboxes that receive messages regardless of the local-part, are common patterns for achieving a variety of delivery goals.

The addresses found in the header fields of an email message are not directly used by mail exchanges to deliver the message. An email message also contains a message envelope that contains the information for mail routing. While envelope and header addresses may be equal, forged email addresses (also called &quot;spoofed email addresses&quot;) are often seen in spam, phishing, and many other Internet-based scams. This has led to several initiatives which aim to make such forgeries of fraudulent emails easier to spot.

== Syntax ==

The format of an email address is &quot;local-part@domain&quot;, where the local-part may be up to 64 octets long and the domain may have a maximum of 255 octets. The formal definitions are in RFC 5322 (sections 3.2.3 and 3.4.1) and RFC 5321—with a more readable form given in the informational RFC 3696 (written by J. Klensin, the author of RFC 5321) and the associated errata.

An email address also may have an associated &quot;display-name&quot; (Display Name) for the recipient, which precedes the address specification, now surrounded by angled brackets, for example: &quot;John Smith &lt;john.smith@example.org&gt;&quot;. Email spammers and phishers will often use &quot;Display Name spoofing&quot; to trick their victims, by using a false Display Name, or by using a different email address as the Display Name.

Earlier forms of email addresses for other networks than the Internet included other notations, such as that required by X.400, and the UUCP &quot;bang path&quot; notation, in which the address was given in the form of a sequence of computers through which the message should be relayed. This was widely used for several years, but was superseded by the Internet standards promulgated by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

=== Local-part ===

The local-part of the email address may be unquoted or may be enclosed in quotation marks.

If unquoted, it may use any of these ASCII characters:
* uppercase and lowercase Latin letters codice_1 to codice_2 and codice_3 to codice_4
* digits codice_5 to codice_6
* printable characters codice_7
* dot codice_8, provided that it is not the first or last character and provided also that it does not appear consecutively (e.g., codice_9 is not allowed).

If quoted, it may contain Space, Horizontal Tab (HT), any ASCII graphic except Backslash and Quote and a quoted-pair consisting of a Backslash followed by HT, Space or any ASCII graphic; it may also be split between lines anywhere that HT or Space appears. In contrast to unquoted local-parts, the addresses codice_10, codice_11 and codice_12 are allowed.

The maximum total length of the local-part of an email address is 64 octets.

* Space and special characters codice_13 are allowed with restrictions (they are only allowed inside a quoted string, as described in the paragraph below, and in that quoted string, any backslash or double-quote must be preceded once by a backslash);
* Comments are allowed with parentheses at either end of the local-part; e.g., codice_14 and codice_15 are both equivalent to codice_16.

In addition to the above ASCII characters, international characters above U+007F, encoded as UTF-8, are permitted by RFC 6531 when the EHLO specifies SMTPUTF8, though even mail systems that support SMTPUTF8 and 8BITMIME may restrict which characters to use when assigning local-parts.

A local-part is either a Dot-string or a Quoted-string; it cannot be a combination. Quoted strings and characters, however, are not commonly used. RFC 5321 also warns that &quot;a host that expects to receive mail SHOULD avoid defining mailboxes where the Local-part requires (or uses) the Quoted-string form&quot;.

The local-part codice_17 is treated specially—it is case-insensitive, and should be forwarded to the domain email administrator. Technically all other local-parts are case-sensitive, therefore codice_18 and codice_19 specify different mailboxes; however, many organizations treat uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent. Indeed, RFC 5321 warns that &quot;a host that expects to receive mail SHOULD avoid defining mailboxes where ... the Local-part is case-sensitive&quot;.

Despite the wide range of special characters which are technically valid, organisations, mail services, mail servers and mail clients in practice often do not accept all of them. For example, Windows Live Hotmail only allows creation of email addresses using alphanumerics, dot (codice_8), underscore (codice_21) and hyphen (codice_22). Common advice is to avoid using some special characters to avoid the risk of rejected emails.

According to RFC 5321 2.3.11 &quot;Mailbox and Address,&quot; &quot;the local-part MUST be interpreted and assigned semantics only by the host specified in the domain of the address&quot;. This means that no assumptions can be made about the meaning of the local-part of another mail server. It is entirely up to the configuration of the mail server.

Interpretation of the local-part is dependent on the conventions and policies implemented in the mail server. For example, case sensitivity may distinguish mailboxes differing only in capitalization of characters of the local-part, although this is not very common. For example, Gmail ignores all dots in the local-part of a &quot;@gmail.com&quot; address for the purposes of determining account identity.

==== Sub-addressing ====

Some mail services support a tag included in the local-part, such that the address is an alias to a prefix of the local-part. Typically the characters following a plus and less often the characters following a minus, so fred+bar@domain and fred+foo@domain might end up in the same inbox as fred+@domain or even as fred@domain. For example, the address &quot;joeuser+tag@example.com&quot; denotes the same delivery address as &quot;joeuser@example.com&quot;. refers to this convention as &quot;subaddressing&quot;, but it is also known as &quot;plus addressing&quot;, &quot;tagged addressing&quot; or &quot;mail extensions&quot;. This can be useful for tagging emails for sorting, and for spam control.

Addresses of this form, using various separators between the base name and the tag, are supported by several email services, including Andrew Project (plus), Runbox (plus), Gmail (plus), Rackspace (plus), Yahoo! Mail Plus (hyphen), Apple&#x27;s iCloud (plus), Outlook.com (plus), Mailfence (plus), Proton Mail (plus), Fastmail (plus and Subdomain Addressing), postale.io (plus), Pobox (plus),
MeMail (plus), and MTAs like MMDF (equals), Qmail and Courier Mail Server (hyphen). Postfix and Exim allow configuring an arbitrary separator from the legal character set.

The text of the tag may be used to apply filtering, or to create &quot;single-use&quot;, or disposable email addresses.

=== Domain ===

The domain name part of an email address has to conform to strict guidelines: it must match the requirements for a hostname, a list of dot-separated DNS labels, each label being limited to a length of 63 characters and consisting of:

* Uppercase and lowercase Latin letters codice_1 to codice_2 and codice_3 to codice_4;
* Digits codice_5 to codice_6, provided that top-level domain names are not all-numeric;
* Hyphen codice_22, provided that it is not the first or last character.
This rule is known as the &quot;LDH rule&quot; (letters, digits, hyphen). In addition, the domain may be an IP address literal, surrounded by square brackets codice_30, such as codice_31 or codice_32, although this is rarely seen except in email spam. Internationalized domain names (which are encoded to comply with the requirements for a hostname) allow for presentation of non-ASCII domains. In mail systems compliant with RFC 6531 and RFC 6532 an email address may be encoded as UTF-8, both a local-part as well as a domain name.

Comments are allowed in the domain as well as in the local-part; for example, codice_33 and codice_34 are equivalent to codice_16.

 specifies that certain domains, for example those intended for documentation and testing, should not be resolvable and that as a result mail addressed to mailboxes in them and their subdomains should be non-deliverable. Of note for e-mail are &quot;example&quot;, &quot;invalid&quot;, &quot;example.com&quot;, &quot;example.net&quot;, and &quot;example.org&quot;.

=== Examples ===

==== Valid email addresses ====
* codice_36
* codice_37
* codice_38 (case is always ignored after the @ and usually before)
* codice_39 (one-letter local-part)
* codice_40
* codice_41 (may be routed to codice_42 inbox depending on mail server)
* codice_43 (slashes are a printable character, and allowed)
* codice_44 (local domain name with no TLD, although ICANN highly discourages dotless email addresses)
* codice_45 (see the List of Internet top-level domains)
* codice_46 (space between the quotes) 
* codice_47 (quoted double dot)
* codice_48 (bangified host route used for uucp mailers)
* codice_49 (include non-letters character AND multiple at sign, the first one being double quoted)
* codice_50 (% escaped mail route to user@example.com via example.org)
* codice_51 (local-part ending with non-alphanumeric character from the list of allowed printable characters)
* codice_52 (IP addresses are allowed instead of domains when in square brackets, but strongly discouraged)
* codice_53 (IPv6 uses a different syntax)
* codice_54 (begin with underscore different syntax)

==== Valid email addresses with SMTPUTF8 ====
* codice_55 (emoji are only allowed with SMTPUTF8)

==== Invalid email addresses ====
* codice_56 (no @ character)
* codice_57 (only one @ is allowed outside quotation marks)
* codice_58 (none of the special characters in this local-part are allowed outside quotation marks)
* codice_59 (quoted strings must be dot separated or be the only element making up the local-part)
* codice_60 (spaces, quotes, and backslashes may only exist when within quoted strings and preceded by a backslash)
* codice_61 (even if escaped (preceded by a backslash), spaces, quotes, and backslashes must still be contained by quotes)
* codice_62 (local-part is longer than 64 characters)
* codice_63 (underscore is not allowed in domain part)

== Validation and verification ==
Email addresses are often requested as input to website as validation of user existence. Other validation methods are available, such as cell phone number validation, postal mail validation, and fax validation.

An email address is generally recognized as having two parts joined with an at-sign (&quot;@&quot;), although technical specification detailed in RFC 822 and subsequent RFCs are more extensive.

Syntactically correct, verified email addresses do not guarantee that an email box exists. Thus many mail servers use other techniques and check the mailbox existence against relevant systems such as the Domain Name System for the domain or using callback verification to check if the mailbox exists. Callback verification is an imperfect solution, as it may be disabled to avoid a directory harvest attack, or callbacks may be reported as spam and lead to listing on a DNSBL.

Several validation techniques may be utilized to validate a user email address. For example,

* Verification links: Email address validation is often accomplished for account creation on websites by sending an email to the user-provided email address with a special temporary hyperlink. On receipt, the user opens the link, immediately activating the account. Email addresses are also useful as means of delivering messages from a website, e.g., user messages, user actions, to the email inbox.
* Formal and informal standards: RFC 3696 provides specific advice for validating Internet identifiers, including email addresses. Some websites instead attempt to evaluate the validity of email addresses through arbitrary standards, such as by rejecting addresses containing valid characters, such as &quot;+&quot; and &quot;/&quot;, or enforcing arbitrary length limitations. Email address internationalization provides for a much larger range of characters than many current validation algorithms allow, such as all Unicode characters above U+0080, encoded as UTF-8.
* Algorithmic tools: Large websites, bulk mailers and spammers require efficient tools to validate email addresses. Such tools depend upon heuristic algorithms and statistical models.
* Sender reputation: An email sender&#x27;s reputation may be used to attempt to verify whether the sender is trustworthy or a potential spammer. Factors that may be incorporated into an assessment of sender reputation include the quality of past contact with or content provided by, and engagement levels of, the sender&#x27;s IP address or email address.
* Browser-based verification: HTML5 forms implemented in many browsers allow email address validation to be handled by the browser.

Some companies offer services to validate an email address, often using an application programming interface, but there is no guarantee that it will provide accurate results.

== Internationalization ==

The IETF conducts a technical and standards working group devoted to internationalization issues of email addresses, entitled &quot;Email Address Internationalization&quot; (EAI, also known as IMA, Internationalized Mail Address). This group produced , and continues to work on additional EAI-related RFCs.

The IETF&#x27;s EAI Working group published RFC 6530 &quot;Overview and Framework for Internationalized Email&quot;, which enabled non-ASCII characters to be used in both the local-parts and domain of an email address. RFC 6530 provides for email based on the UTF-8 encoding, which permits the full repertoire of Unicode. RFC 6531 provides a mechanism for SMTP servers to negotiate transmission of the SMTPUTF8 content.

The basic EAI concepts involve exchanging mail in UTF-8. Though the original proposal included a downgrading mechanism for legacy systems, this has now been dropped. The local servers are responsible for the local-part of the address, whereas the domain would be restricted by the rules of internationalized domain names, though still transmitted in UTF-8. The mail server is also responsible for any mapping mechanism between the IMA form and any ASCII alias.

EAI enables users to have a localized address in a native language script or character set, as well as an ASCII form for communicating with legacy systems or for script-independent use. Applications that recognize internationalized domain names and mail addresses must have facilities to convert these representations.

Significant demand for such addresses is expected in China, Japan, Russia, and other markets that have large user bases in a non-Latin-based writing system.

For example, in addition to the .in top-level domain, the government of India in 2011 got approval for &quot;.bharat&quot;, (from &quot;Bhārat Gaṇarājya&quot;), written in seven different scripts for use by Gujrati, Marathi, Bangali, Tamil, Telugu, Punjabi and Urdu speakers. Indian company XgenPlus.com claims to be the world&#x27;s first EAI mailbox provider, and the Government of Rajasthan now supplies a free email account on domain राजस्थान.भारत for every citizen of the state. A leading media house Rajasthan Patrika launched their IDN domain पत्रिका.भारत with contactable email.

The example addresses below would not be handled by based servers without an extension, but are permitted by the UTF8SMTP extension of . Servers compliant with this will be able to handle these:

* Latin alphabet with diacritics: éléonore@example.com
* Greek alphabet: δοκιμή@παράδειγμα.δοκιμή
* Traditional Chinese characters: 我買@屋企.香港
* Japanese characters: 二ノ宮@黒川.日本
* Cyrillic characters: медведь@с-балалайкой.рф
* Devanagari characters: संपर्क@डाटामेल.भारत

<text>Élie Catherine Fréron (; 20 January 1718 – 10 March 1776) was a French literary critic and controversialist whose career focused on countering the influence of the &quot;philosophes&quot; of the French Enlightenment, partly through his vehicle, the &quot;Année littéraire&quot;. Thus Fréron, in recruiting young writers to counter the literary establishment became central to the movement now called the Counter-Enlightenment.

==Biography==
Fréron was born at Quimper in Brittany and educated by the Jesuits. He made such rapid academic progress that he was appointed professor at the college of Louis-le-Grand before he turned twenty. He became a contributor to the &quot;Observations sur les écrits modernes&quot; of the abbé Pierre Desfontaines. The very fact of his collaboration with Desfontaines, one of Voltaire&#x27;s bitterest enemies, was sufficient to arouse the latter&#x27;s hostility, and although Fréron had begun his career as one of his admirers, his attitude towards Voltaire soon changed. 

Fréron in 1746 founded a similar journal of his own, entitled &quot;Lettres de la Comtesse de ...&quot; It was suppressed in 1749, but he immediately replaced it by &quot;Lettres sur quelques écrits de ce temps&quot;, which, with the exception of a short suspension in 1752, on account of an attack on the character of Voltaire, was continued till 1754, when it was succeeded by the more ambitious &quot;Année littéraire&quot;. His death at Paris in 1776 is said to have been hastened by the temporary suppression of this journal.

==Legacy==
Fréron is now remembered solely for his attacks on Voltaire and the Encyclopaedists, and for the retaliation from Voltaire, who, besides attacking Fréron in epigrams, and even incidentally in some of his tragedies, directed against him a virulent satire, &quot;Le Pauvre diable&quot;, and made him the principal personage in a comedy &quot;L&#x27;Ecossaise&quot;, in which the journal of Fréron is designated &quot;L&#x27;Âne littéraire&quot;, &quot;the Literary Ass&quot;. Fréron is also mentioned in Voltaire&#x27;s famous novel &quot;Candide&quot;, in reference to a rude critic the title character meets at a theater. A further attack on Fréron entitled &quot;Anecdotes sur Fréron ...&quot; (1760), published anonymously, is generally attributed to Voltaire.

Fréron was the author of an &quot;Ode sur la bataille de Fontenoy&quot; (1745) &quot;Histoire de Marie Stuart&quot; (1742, 2 vols.); and &quot;Histoire de l&#x27;empire d&#x27;Allemagne&quot; (1771, 8 vols.).

He was the father of Stanislas Fréron, revolutionary politician.

<text>Peter Victor Ueberroth (; born September 2, 1937) is an American sports and business executive known for his involvement in the Olympics and in Major League Baseball. A Los Angeles–based businessman, he was the chairman of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee which brought the games to Los Angeles in 1984. Ueberroth was named 1984&#x27;s &quot;Time&quot; Man of the Year for his success in organizing the Olympic games.

After the conclusion of the games, he was named as the sixth commissioner of Baseball, a role he held from 1984 to 1989. He later served as the chairman of the United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee from 2004 to 2008.

==Early life==
Ueberroth was born in Evanston, Illinois, the son of Laura (Larson) and Victor Ueberroth. His father was of German and Austrian descent, and his mother was of Swedish and Irish ancestry. He caddied at Sunset Ridge Country Club, in Northfield, Illinois. He grew up in Northern California. While attending Fremont High School, Ueberroth excelled in football, baseball, and swimming. After graduating from high school, Ueberroth attended San Jose State University on an athletic scholarship. While attending San Jose State he joined Delta Upsilon. He competed in the 1956 United States Olympic water polo trials but failed to make the team. Ueberroth ultimately graduated from San Jose State in 1959 with a degree in business.

===Trans International Airlines===
After college, Ueberroth became a vice president and shareholder in Trans International Airlines (he was 22 years old at the time), then owned by future billionaire Kirk Kerkorian. Ueberroth worked at Trans International until 1963, when he founded his own travel company, which would become First Travel Corporation. By the time he sold First Travel in 1980, it was the second largest travel business in North America.

==Sports career==

===1984 Olympics===
For five years Ueberroth served as the organizer of the 1984 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles. He was a prominent figure in the games, receiving the Olympic Order in gold at its conclusion from the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Due to the success of the games, he was named &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Man of the Year in 1984. Under Ueberroth&#x27;s leadership and management, the first privately financed Olympic Games in history resulted in a surplus of nearly US$250 million, and became a model for all of the future games to follow. This was subsequently used to support youth and sports activities throughout the United States. Coincidentally, he was born on the day on which the founder of the modern Olympic Games, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, died.

Ueberroth created a committee of over 150 members (mostly business people and entrepreneurs) to generate ideas, opportunities and solve problems. His aggressive recruiting of sponsors for the 1984 Olympics is credited as the genesis for the current Olympic sponsorship program. Due to recruiting competitors between the Los Angeles Olympic Committee and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), after 1984 all Olympics in the US had their local organizing committees enter into recruitment agreements with the USOC to jointly recruit sponsors and share revenue.

===Baseball commissioner===
Ueberroth was elected to succeed Bowie Kuhn on March 3, 1984, and took office on October 1 of that year. As a condition of his hiring, Ueberroth increased the commissioner&#x27;s fining ability from US$5,000 to $250,000. His salary was raised to a reported $450,000, nearly twice what Kuhn was paid.

Just as Ueberroth was taking office, the Major League Umpires Union was threatening to strike the postseason. Ueberroth managed to arbitrate the disagreement and had the umpires back to work before the League Championship Series were over. The next summer, Ueberroth worked behind the scenes to limit a players&#x27; strike to one day before a new labor agreement was worked out with the Players Association.

During the course of his stint as commissioner, Ueberroth reinstated two Hall of Famers, Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle, who had been banned from working for Major League Baseball by Kuhn because of their associations with gambling casinos. Also, Ueberroth suspended numerous players because of cocaine use, negotiated a $1.8 billion television contract with CBS, and initiated the investigation against Pete Rose&#x27;s betting habits. In 1985, Ueberroth&#x27;s first full year in office, the League Championship Series expanded from a best-of-five series to a best-of-seven series. At his urging, the Chicago Cubs chose to install lights at Wrigley Field rather than reimburse the leagues for lost night-game revenue. Ueberroth then found a new source of income in the form of persuading large corporations to pay for the privilege of having their products endorsed by Major League Baseball.

However, Ueberroth, with the assistance of the owners, also facilitated collusion between the owners in violation of the league&#x27;s collective bargaining agreement with the players. Players entering free agency in the 1985, 1986 and 1987 offseasons were, with few exceptions, prevented from both signing equitable contracts and joining the teams of their choice during this period. The roots of the collusion lay in Ueberroth&#x27;s first owners&#x27; meeting as commissioner, when he called the owners &quot;damned dumb&quot; for being willing to lose money in order to win a World Series. Later, he told the general managers that it was &quot;not smart&quot; to sign long-term contracts. Former Major League Baseball Players Association president Marvin Miller later described this as &quot;tantamount to fixing, not just games, but entire pennant races, including all post-season series.&quot; The MLBPA, under Miller&#x27;s successor, Don Fehr, filed collusion charges and won each case, resulting in &quot;second look&quot; free agents, and over $280 million in fines. Fay Vincent, who followed as Ueberroth&#x27;s successor in the commissioner&#x27;s office, laid the crippling labor problems of the early 1990s (including the 1994–95 strike) directly at the feet of Ueberroth and the owners&#x27; collusion, holding that the collusion years constituted theft from the players.

Under Ueberroth, Major League Baseball enjoyed &quot;increased attendance (record attendance four straight seasons), greater awareness of crowd control and alcohol management within ballparks, a successful and vigilant anti-drug campaign, significant industry-wide improvement in the area of fair employment, and a significantly improved financial picture for the industry. When Ueberroth took office, 21 of the 26 clubs were losing money; in Ueberroth&#x27;s last full season – 1988 – all clubs either broke even or finished in the black. In 1987, for example, baseball as an industry showed a net profit of $21.3 million, its first profitable year since 1973.&quot;

Nonetheless, following the announcement of the first of three large awards to the players following the collusion findings, Ueberroth stepped down as commissioner before the start of the 1989 regular season; his contract was to have run through the end of the season. He was succeeded by National League president A. Bartlett Giamatti.

==Post-baseball activities==
Ueberroth has been a director of The Coca-Cola Company since 1986. Ueberroth is an investor and chairman of the Contrarian Group, Inc., a business management company, and has held this position since 1989. He is also co-chairman of Pebble Beach Company. He is a director of Hilton Hotels Corporation and previously served as director of Adecco S.A. from 2004 to 2008. He has served as Chairman of the Board of Aircastle since 2012 and been on the board since 2006.

In 1989, Ueberroth considered purchasing Eastern Air Lines, then crippled by a strike and bankruptcy from Texas Air. However, a management dispute with Texas Air CEO Frank Lorenzo led to the deal falling through.

In 1990, Ueberroth bought controlling interest of Hawaiian Airlines with his brother John and business partner J. Thomas Talbot.

Three years after leaving office, he led the &quot;Rebuild Los Angeles&quot; project after the 1992 Los Angeles riots.

In 1999, Ueberroth, along with Arnold Palmer and Clint Eastwood, bought the Pebble Beach golf course.

Ueberroth ran for Governor of California in the 2003 California recall election as an independent, though he was a registered Republican. His campaign focused on California&#x27;s economic and budget crisis, avoiding social issues. With polls indicating only a low level of support, he pulled out of the race on September 9, 2003, though his name still appeared on the ballot and received a small but significant number of votes. He placed 6th in a field of 135 candidates.

Ueberroth was chairman of Ambassadors International, Inc. but was replaced by his son, Joseph Ueberroth in April 2006. Ueberroth resigned from the board in November 2008.

Ueberroth was also the chairman of the United States Olympic Committee Board of Directors from 2004 to 2008.

Ueberroth was inducted into the USA Water Polo Hall of Fame in 2010.

Ueberroth is a Life Trustee of the University of Southern California.

Ueberroth and his wife, Ginny, were two of the founders of Sage Hill School. He additionally served briefly on the school&#x27;s Athletic Advisory Council.

Ueberroth is a board member for the Lott IMPACT Trophy, which is named after Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive back Ronnie Lott, and is awarded annually to college football&#x27;s Defensive IMPACT Player of the Year.

==Personal life==
Ueberroth married Virginia &quot;Ginny&quot; Nicolaus in 1959, and they have four children.

<doc id="295046" wikidata="Q5301642" url="?curid=295046" title="Douglas Feith">
<text>Douglas Jay Feith (; born July 16, 1953) is an American lawyer who served as Under Secretary of Defense for Policy from July 2001 until August 2005. He is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank.

Feith has been described as an architect of the Iraq War. In the lead up to the war, he played a key role in promoting the false claim that the Saddam Hussein regime had an operational relationship with al-Qaeda (even though there was scant credible evidence of such a relationship at the time). A Pentagon Inspector General report found that Feith&#x27;s office had &quot;developed, produced, and then disseminated alternative intelligence assessments on the Iraq and al Qaida relationship, which included some conclusions that were inconsistent with the consensus of the Intelligence Community, to senior decision-makers.&quot;

==Personal==
Feith was born to a Jewish family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, one of three children of Rose (née Bankel) and Dalck Feith. His father was a member of the Betar, a Revisionist Zionist youth organization, in Poland, and a Holocaust survivor who lost his parents and seven siblings in the Nazi concentration camps. Dalck came to the United States during World War II and became a businessman, a philanthropist, and a donor to the Republican party.

Feith grew up in Elkins Park, part of Cheltenham Township, a Philadelphia suburb. He attended Philadelphia&#x27;s Central High School, and later attended Harvard University, where he obtained his undergraduate degree and graduated magna cum laude in 1975. He continued on to the Georgetown University Law Center, receiving his J.D. magna cum laude in 1978. After graduation, he worked for three years as an attorney with the law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson LLP.

==Career==

===Work as a Democrat===
Feith worked on the staff of senator Henry M. Jackson in 1975 before going on to work on Elmo Zumwalt&#x27;s campaign against segregationist senator Harry Byrd, Jr. Byrd, an independent since 1970, defeated Zumwalt, a Democrat, 57–38%.

===Reagan administration===
At Harvard, Feith had studied under Richard Pipes, who joined the Reagan administration&#x27;s National Security Council, in 1981, to help carry out a private intelligence project called Team B that Pipes and his students had conceived. Feith joined the NSC as a Middle East specialist that same year, working under Pipes.

He transferred from the NSC staff to the Pentagon, in 1982, to work as special counsel for Richard Perle, who was then serving as assistant secretary to the United States Secretary of Defense. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger promoted Feith, in 1984, to deputy assistant secretary of defense for negotiations policy. When Feith left the Pentagon, in 1986, Weinberger awarded him the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service, the department&#x27;s highest civilian award.

During his time in the Pentagon in the Reagan administration, Feith helped to convince the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Weinberger and Secretary of State George Shultz all to recommend against ratification of changes to the Geneva Conventions. The changes, known as the &quot;Additional Protocols,&quot; grant armed non-state actors prisoner of war status under certain circumstances even if they fail to distinguish themselves from the civilian population to the same extent as members of the armed forces of a high contracting party. Reagan informed the United States Senate in 1987 that he would not ratify Additional Protocol I. At the time, both &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; editorialized in favor of Reagan&#x27;s decision to reject Additional Protocol I as a revision of humanitarian law that protected terrorists.

===Private practice===
Feith began his career as an attorney in private practice with the law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson LLP for 3 years, after which he joined the Reagan administration (see the previous section).

Upon leaving the Pentagon, Feith co-founded, with Marc Zell, the Washington, DC law firm of Feith &amp; Zell. The firm engaged in lobbying efforts for, among others, the Turkish, Israeli and Bosnian governments, in addition to representing defense corporations Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. Feith left the firm in 2001, following his nomination as Undersecretary of Defense for Policy.

===Bush administration===
Feith joined the administration of President George W. Bush as Undersecretary of Defense for Policy in 2001. His appointment was facilitated by connections he had with other neoconservatives, including Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz. With his new appointment in hand, Feith proved influential in having Richard Perle chosen as chairman of the Defense Policy Board. Feith was criticized during the first term of the Bush administration for creating the Office of Strategic Influence. This office came into existence to support the War on Terror. The office&#x27;s aim was to conduct non-covert influence operations in foreign countries. However, after significant media scrutiny into what exactly would fall within the OSI&#x27;s mandate, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had Feith shut the office down, while transferring its functions elsewhere within the Department of Defense. Feith played a significant role in the buildup to the Iraq War. Feith has been characterized as an architect of the Iraq War.

As part of his portfolio, he supervised the Pentagon Office of Special Plans, a group of policy and intelligence analysts created to provide senior government officials with raw intelligence, unvetted by the intelligence community. The office was responsible for hiring Lawrence Franklin, who was later convicted along with AIPAC employees Steven J. Rosen and Keith Weissman for passing classified national defense information to an Israeli diplomat Naor Gilon. The office, eventually dismantled, was later criticized in Congress and the media for analysis that was contradicted by CIA analysis and investigations performed following the invasion of Iraq. In response to the allegedly poor work of Feith&#x27;s Office of Special Plans, General Tommy Franks, who led both the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and the Iraq War called Feith &quot;the dumbest fucking guy on the planet&quot;.

Feith was responsible for the de-Ba&#x27;athification policy promulgated in Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) Order 1 which entered into force on 16 May 2003.

In February 2007, the Pentagon&#x27;s inspector general issued a report that concluded that Feith&#x27;s office &quot;developed, produced, and then disseminated alternative intelligence assessments on the Iraq and al-Qaeda relationship, which included some conclusions that were inconsistent with the consensus of the Intelligence Community, to senior decision-makers.&quot; This repeated Feith&#x27;s earlier involvement with Team B as a postgraduate, when alternative intelligence assessments exaggerating threats to the United States turned out to be wrong on nearly every point. The report found that these actions were &quot;inappropriate&quot; though not &quot;illegal.&quot; Senator Carl Levin, Chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, stated that &quot;The bottom line is that intelligence relating to the Iraq-al-Qaeda relationship was manipulated by high-ranking officials in the Department of Defense to support the administration&#x27;s decision to invade Iraq. The inspector general&#x27;s report is a devastating condemnation of inappropriate activities in the DOD policy office that helped take this nation to war.&quot; At Senator Levin&#x27;s insistence, on April 6, 2007, the Pentagon&#x27;s Inspector General&#x27;s Report was declassified and released to the public.

Responding to criticism of a report that linked Al-Qaeda with Iraq under Saddam Hussein, Feith called the office&#x27;s report a much-needed critique of the CIA&#x27;s intelligence. &quot;It&#x27;s healthy to criticize the CIA&#x27;s intelligence&quot;, Feith said. &quot;What the people in the Pentagon were doing was right. It was good government.&quot; Feith also rejected accusations he attempted to link Iraq to a formal relationship with Al Qaeda. &quot;No one in my office ever claimed there was an operational relationship&quot;, Feith said. &quot;There was a relationship.&quot; Feith stated that he &quot;felt vindicated&quot; by the report of the Pentagon inspector general. He told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that his office produced &quot;a criticism of the consensus of the intelligence community, and in presenting it I was not endorsing its substance.&quot;

Feith was the first senior Pentagon official to leave the administration after Bush was re-elected. There was some speculation when Feith announced he was leaving as to why he was stepping down. Some believed he was pressured to leave because of problems over his performance and his increasing marginalization.

===Post-government career===
Following his government service, Feith was employed by the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, where he taught a course on the Bush administration&#x27;s anti-terrorism policy. He came to Georgetown&#x27;s School of Foreign Service after leaving Stanford&#x27;s Hoover Institution and was appointed by School of Foreign Service dean, Robert Gallucci. However, his hiring &quot;caused an uproar among the Foreign Service school faculty.&quot; Two years later, Feith&#x27;s contract was not renewed, causing continuing hostility between the Georgetown Law Center faculty and alumni and the Foreign Service school faculty.

In 2008, Feith became a senior fellow at Hudson Institute, where he is the director of its Center for National Security Strategies.

==Views and publications==
Feith is a Republican, and has contributed money to various party candidates over the years. He has been described as a neoconservative. One of Feith&#x27;s controversial views was his argument that increasing the number of political appointees equated to more democracy, which would help align government policy to the promises politicians make before they get into office.

Feith&#x27;s writings have appeared in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Commentary&quot;, and &quot;The New Republic&quot;. He has contributed chapters to a number of books, including James W. Muller&#x27;s &quot;Churchill as Peacemaker&quot;, Raphael Israeli&#x27;s &quot;The Dangers of a Palestinian State&quot; and Uri Ra&#x27;anan&#x27;s &quot;Hydra of Carnage: International Linkages of Terrorism&quot;, as well as serving as co-editor for &quot;Israel&#x27;s Legitimacy in Law and History&quot;.

Feith is an ardent supporter of Israel. Along with Richard Perle and David Wurmser, he was a member of the study group which authored a controversial report entitled &quot;A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm&quot;, a set of policy recommendations for the newly elected Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. The report was published by the Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies without an individual author being named. According to the report, Feith was one of the people who participated in roundtable discussions that produced ideas that the report reflects. Feith pointed out in a September 16, 2004 letter to the editor of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that he was not the co-author and did not clear the report&#x27;s final text. He wrote, &quot;There is no warrant for attributing any particular idea [in the report], let alone all of them, to any one participant.&quot;

Feith was on the board of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA), a think tank that promotes a military and strategic alliance between the United States and Israel.

Feith was interviewed by the CBS news magazine &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in a segment that was aired on April 6, 2008. During this interview he promoted his newly released memoir, &quot;War and Decision&quot; and defended the decision making that led to the US invasion of Iraq in 2003.

===&quot;War and Decision&quot;===
On April 8, 2008, Feith&#x27;s memoir, &quot;War and Decision: Inside the Pentagon at the Dawn of the War on Terrorism&quot;, was published by HarperCollins.

==War crimes investigation==
In 2009, Feith became one of several Bush administration officials under consideration for investigation of possible war crimes in a Spanish court, headed by Baltasar Garzón under claims of universal jurisdiction. The case had reportedly still been active as of 2011.

== Personal life ==
Feith is married with four children. His eldest son, Daniel Feith, graduated from Harvard College and Yale Law School and served as Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Consumer Protection Branch in the United States Department of Justice. His second son, David Feith, graduated from Columbia University and worked as an editorial writer for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and an assistant editor at &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; before serving as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs in the United States Department of State from July 2020 to January 2021.

<text>Legg–Calvé–Perthes disease (LCPD) is a childhood hip disorder initiated by a disruption of blood flow to the head of the femur. Due to the lack of blood flow, the bone dies (osteonecrosis or avascular necrosis) and stops growing. Over time, healing occurs by new blood vessels infiltrating the dead bone and removing the necrotic bone which leads to a loss of bone mass and a weakening of the femoral head.

The condition is most commonly found in children between the ages of 4 and 8, but it can occur in children between the ages of 2 and 15. It can produce a permanent deformity of the femoral head, which increases the risk of developing osteoarthritis in adults. Perthes is a form of osteochondritis which affects only the hip. Bilateral Perthes, which means both hips are affected, should always be investigated to rule out multiple epiphyseal dysplasia.

==Signs and symptoms==

The condition is most commonly found in children between the ages of 4 and 10. Common symptoms include pain in the hip, knee, or ankle (since hip pathology can cause pain to be felt in a normal knee or ankle), or in the groin; this pain is exacerbated by hip or leg movement, especially internal hip rotation (with the knee flexed 90°, twisting the lower leg away from the center of the body). The range of motion is reduced, particularly in abduction and internal rotation, and the patient presents with a limp. Pain is usually mild. Atrophy of thigh muscles may occur from disuse and an inequality of leg length. In some cases, some activity can cause severe irritation or inflammation of the damaged area, including standing, walking, running, kneeling, or stooping repeatedly for an extended period. In cases exhibiting severe femoral osteonecrosis, pain is usually a chronic, throbbing sensation exacerbated by activity

The first signs are complaints of soreness from the child, which are often dismissed as growing pains, and limping or other joint guarding, particularly when tired. The pain is usually in the hip, but can also be felt in the knee (referred pain). In some cases, pain is felt in the unaffected hip and leg, due to the children favoring their injured side and placing the majority of their weight on their &quot;good&quot; leg. It is predominantly a disease of boys (4:1 ratio). Perthes is generally diagnosed between 5 and 12 years of age, although it has been diagnosed as early as 18 months. Typically, the disease is only seen in one hip, but bilateral Perthes is seen in about 10% of children diagnosed.

==Cause==

Perthes disease is a childhood hip disorder initiated by a disruption of blood flow to the head of the femur. Due to the lack of blood flow, the bone dies (osteonecrosis or avascular necrosis) and stops growing.

Legg believed the cause was impairment of blood supply to the femoral epiphysis, Calvé believed rickets, and Perthes deduced an infection possibly causing degenerative arthritis leads to LCP disease. Currently, a number of factors have been implicated, including heredity, trauma, endocrine dysfunction, inflammation, nutrition, and altered circulatory hemodynamics.
Risk factors are not limited to impaired and disproportionate growth, low birth weight, delayed skeletal maturity, short stature, systemic hormonal changes, and low economic index. Although no one has identified the cause of Perthes disease, a reduction in blood flow to the joint is known.

The disease is theorized to include the artery of the ligamentum teres femoris being constricted or even blocked too early, not allowing for time when the medial circumflex femoral artery takes over. The medial circumflex femoral artery is the principal source of blood supply to the femoral head. LCP disease is a vascular restrictive condition of idiopathic nature. Symptoms like femoral head disfigurement, flattening, and collapse occur typically between ages four and ten, mostly male children of Caucasian descent. Children affected by LCP disease often display uneven gait and limited range of motion, and they experience mild to severe pain in the groin area. For example, a child may be six years old chronologically but may have grown only four years old in terms of bone maturity. The child may then engage in activities appropriate for a six-year-old child, but lacking the bone strength of an older child, these activities may lead to flattening or fracture of the hip joint. Genetics do not appear to be a determining factor, but a deficiency of blood factors with anticoagulant property used to disperse blood clots may lead to blockages in the vessels supplying the joint. A deficiency of protein C and protein S, which also act as blood anticoagulants, may also exist; if that were the case, their deficiency could cause clot formation in ligamentum teres femoris artery and hinder blood supply to the femoral head. However, no evidence of this has been found; over the years, many theories have been published, but none has stood up to professional research.

==Pathology==

Over time, healing occurs by new blood vessels infiltrating the dead bone and removing the necrotic bone which leads to a loss of bone mass and a weakening of the femoral head. The bone loss leads to some degree of collapse and deformity of the femoral head and sometimes secondary changes to the shape of the hip socket.

It is also referred to as idiopathic avascular osteonecrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis of the femoral head since the cause of the interruption of the blood supply of the head of the femur in the hip joint is unknown. Perthes can produce a permanent deformity of the femoral head, which increases the risk of developing osteoarthritis in adults. Perthes is a form of osteochondritis which only affects the hip, although other forms of osteochondritis can affect elbows, knees, ankles, and feet. Bilateral Perthes, which means both hips are affected, should always be investigated thoroughly to rule out multiple epiphyseal dysplasia.

==Diagnosis==
X-rays of the hip may suggest and/or verify the diagnosis. X-rays usually demonstrate a flattened, and later fragmented, femoral head. A bone scan or MRI may be useful in making the diagnosis in those cases where X-rays are inconclusive. Usually, plain radiographic changes are delayed six weeks or more from clinical onset, so bone scintigraphy and MRI are done for early diagnosis. MRI results are more accurate, i.e. 97–99% against 88–93% in plain radiography. If MRI or bone scans are necessary, a positive diagnosis relies upon patchy areas of vascularity to the capital femoral epiphysis (the developing femoral head).

==Treatment==
The goals of treatment are to decrease pain, reduce the loss of hip motion, and prevent or minimize permanent femoral head deformity so that the risk of developing a severe degenerative arthritis as an adult can be reduced. Assessment by a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon is recommended to evaluate risks and treatment options. Younger children have a better prognosis than older children.

There is no high quality evidence to guide treatments, though a nationwide study (called a randomised controlled trial) has recently started throughout the UK, which could improve the evidence in future - called the OpNonSTOP study (see research direction). Until then, treatment decisions are based largely on case series and experience.

Treatment has historically centered on removing mechanical pressure from the joint until the disease has run its course. Options include traction (to separate the femur from the pelvis and reduce wear), braces (often for several months, with an average of 18 months) to restore range of motion, physiotherapy, and surgical intervention when necessary because of permanent joint damage. To maintain activities of daily living, custom orthotics may be used. Overnight traction may be used in lieu of walking devices or in combination. These devices internally rotate the femoral head and abduct the leg(s) at 45°. Orthoses can start as proximal as the lumbar spine, and extend the length of the limbs to the floor. Most functional bracing is achieved using a waist belt and thigh cuffs derived from the Scottish-Rite orthosis. These devices are typically prescribed by a physician and implemented by an orthotist. Clinical results of the Scottish Rite orthosis have not been good according to some studies, and its use has gone out of favor. Many children, especially those with the onset of the disease before age 6, need no intervention at all and are simply asked to refrain from contact sports or games which impact the hip. For older children (onset of Perthes after age 6), the best treatment option remains unclear. Current treatment options for older children over age 8 include prolonged periods without weight bearing, osteotomy (femoral, pelvic, or shelf), and the hip distraction method using an external fixator which relieves the hip from carrying the body&#x27;s weight. This allows room for the top of the femur to regrow.

While running and high-impact sports are not recommended during treatment for Perthes disease, children can remain active through a variety of other activities that limit mechanical stress on the hip joint. Swimming is highly recommended, as it allows exercise of the hip muscles with full range of motion while reducing the stress to a minimum. Cycling is another good option as it also keeps stress to a minimum. Physiotherapy generally involves a series of daily exercises, with weekly meetings with a physiotherapist to monitor progress. These exercises focus on improving and maintaining a full range of motion of the femur within the hip socket. Performing these exercises during the healing process is essential to ensure that the femur and hip socket have a perfectly smooth interface. This will minimize the long-term effects of the disease. Use of bisphosphonate such as zoledronate or ibandronate is currently being investigated, but definite recommendations are not yet available.

Perthes disease is self-limiting, but if the head of femur is left deformed, long-term problems can occur. Treatment is aimed at minimizing damage while the disease runs its course, not at &#x27;curing&#x27; the disease. It is recommended not to use steroids or alcohol as these reduce oxygen in the blood which is needed in the joint. As those affected age, problems in the knee and back can arise secondary to abnormal posture and stride adopted to protect the affected joint. The condition is also linked to arthritis of the hip, though this appears not to be an inevitable consequence. Hip replacements are relatively common as the already damaged hip experiences routine wear; this varies by individual, but generally is required any time after age 50.

==Prognosis==
Children younger than six have the best prognosis, since they have time for the dead bone to revascularize and remodel, with a good chance that the femoral head will recover and remain spherical after resolution of the disease. Children who have been diagnosed with Perthes&#x27; disease after the age of ten are at a very high risk of developing osteoarthritis and coxa magna. When an LCP disease diagnosis occurs after age eight, a better outcome results with surgery rather than nonoperative treatments. Shape of femoral head at the time when Legg-Calvé Perthes disease heals is the most important determinant of risk for degenerative arthritis; hence, the shape of femoral head and congruence of hip are most useful outcome measures.

==Epidemiology==
Perthes&#x27; disease is one of the most common hip disorders in young children, occurring in roughly 5.5 of 100,000 children per year. The lifetime risk of a child developing the disease is about one per 1,200 individuals. Boys are affected about three to five times more often than girls. New cases of Perthes&#x27; disease rarely occur after age 14 years (if diagnosed after 14 years of age, then it is usually old disease from early in childhood or avascular necrosis from an alternative cause).
White northern Europeans appear to be affected more frequently than other ethnicities, though a paucity of reliable epidemiology exists in the Southern Hemisphere. Children of those with the disease themselves may have a very slightly increased risk, though it is unclear if this is because of a genetic predisposition, or a shared environmental factor. It is most commonly seen in persons aged three to twelve years, with a median of six years of age. The UK incidence rates show an intriguing pattern with low incidence rates in London, and a progressive increase in disease in more northerly areas (maximal in Scotland). Some evidence suggests, at least in developed countries, more socioeconomically deprived communities have a greater risk of disease (a similar trend to diseases such as adult heart disease), though the reason for this remains unknown. One possible explanation that has been considered is tobacco smoke exposure, though this is significantly confounded by the strong socioeconomic gradient common to both smoking and Perthes&#x27; disease.

==History==
* 1897: The disease was first described by Karel Maydl (1853–1903).
* 1909: Henning Waldenström (1877–1972) described the disease, attributing it to tuberculosis.
* 1910: The disease was recognized as being unrelated to tuberculosis by three physicians working independently. Legg–Calvé–Perthes is named after these three doctors: Arthur Legg (1874–1939), Jacques Calvé (1875–1954), and Georg Perthes (1869–1927).

==Research directions==
The only Level I study to ever recruit in Perthes&#x27; disease has recently opened In the UK - the OpNonSTOP. This is a study funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), that is running throughout the UK . The OpNonSTOP study compares surgical containment to active containment (optimised therapy without surgery). The study is expected to recruit patients between 2024 and 2027, and will be the first high-quality level-I study ever produced in Perthes&#x27; disease, influencing the care of children throughout the world. The OpNonSTOP study follows a prior UK study, which was a nationwide cohort study that collected details of every case of Perthes&#x27; disease - called the British Orthopaedic Surgery Surveillance (BOSS) Study. Every hospital in England, Scotland, and Wales which treated Perthes&#x27; disease collected details of new cases, with the BOSS study demonstrating the major variation in treatment across the UK, with no clear benefit of surgery over non-surgical care. 

==Dogs==
LCP disease is an avascular necrosis of the femoral head in small-breed dogs, usually those weighing up to 25 lbs. LCP disease was first described in veterinary literature by Tutt in 1935. Tutt described the disease as almost exactly what Waldenstromin (1909) described in humans. Small breeds, particularly Toy Poodles, Yorkshire Terriers, Pugs, Jack Russell Terriers, West Highland White Terriers, and Dachshunds can be affected. No sex predilection is seen in the dog as contrasted to humans, in whom an 80% male incidence of the disease is evident. Similar to children, however, the condition is usually unilateral, with only about 10–15% incidence of bilateral disease. The age of onset varies between 4 and 12 months, with a peak incidence around 7 months. The pathology of avascular necrosis followed by revascularization and bony remodeling of the femoral head in the dog certainly suggests a vascular etiology, though the cause of the condition is not completely understood.
Hip pain is usually seen by the age of 6 to 8 months. The disease is bilateral in 12–16% of cases. X-rays are necessary to make the diagnosis and show increased opacity and focal lysis in the head of the femur, and later in the disease, collapse and fracture of the neck of the femur. The recommended treatment is surgical removal of the head of the femur, but conservative treatment (rest, exercise restriction, and pain medication) may be effective in a limited number of cases (less than 25%, according to some studies). In dogs, the prognosis is excellent with surgery. Prednisolone tablets may also be helpful.

<text>Cruz Miguel Bustamante (born January 4, 1953) is an American politician. He served as the 45th lieutenant governor of California from 1999 to 2007, under governors Gray Davis and Arnold Schwarzenegger. A member of the Democratic Party, Bustamante also served in the California State Assembly and was the speaker from 1996 to 1998.

==Early life and education==
The eldest of six children, Cruz Bustamante was born in Dinuba, California. His family later moved to San Joaquin, California. He attended and graduated from Tranquillity High School in the 1970s, where he excelled in both football and wrestling, and later attended Fresno City College and California State University, Fresno. Bustamante earned his Bachelor of Arts via distance learning from California State University, Fresno, in 2003.

==Career==
As a resident of Fresno, Bustamante was elected to the California State Assembly in a special election in 1993, and became the speaker of the Assembly in 1996. He was elected lieutenant governor in 1998, elected to statewide office in California in more than 120 years. He was also the highest-ranking Hispanic officeholder in the United States until Bill Richardson became governor of New Mexico in 2003.

===2003 recall election===
He was the most prominent Democrat to run in the 2003 California recall election to remove Governor Gray Davis, and placed second to Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger, losing by 17 points. (see full election results).

Bustamante had an apparently icy relationship with Governor Davis, a fellow Democrat, during his tenure. They reportedly had not talked in months before the recall election approached. Bustamante&#x27;s decision to run in the recall election was controversial, as many supporters of Governor Davis had urged prominent Democrats not to run, in an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of the event. During the recall election, Bustamante ran on a platform slogan of &quot;No on Recall, Yes on Bustamante&quot;, indicating he opposed the recall.

===2006 insurance commissioner election===

Bustamante was the Democratic nominee for California insurance commissioner in 2006. In his official candidate statement, he said &quot;I want to become an example to others to lead healthier lives by losing weight myself. Obesity in California costs $7.7 billion a year.&quot; Bustamante claimed to have shed 43 pounds, to a weight of 235 pounds, by means of diet and exercise.

He easily won the June 6, 2006, Democratic primary, receiving 70.5% of the vote and defeating his challenger, John Kraft. Bustamante received 1,606,913 votes to 674,309 for Kraft. Many political analysts believed that Kraft, who ran a low-key campaign in which he took no campaign contributions, received those votes as a protest for Bustamante&#x27;s behavior during the 2003 recall election. However, Kraft planned to actively campaign for Bustamante in the general election, and donated a significant portion of his fortune as an heir to Kraft Foods to Bustamante&#x27;s campaign.

Bustamante ran against Republican Steve Poizner in November. Bustamante announced that he would not be returning insurance industry contributions to his campaign, a position criticized by Poizner and campaign ethicists. Bustamante also failed to meet a deadline to submit a campaign statement to voters. According to the Field Poll, on November 3, 2006, Bustamante trailed Poizner by 9%. and lost to Poizner by 12% in the general election.

It was speculated that Bustamante would run for the U.S. House of Representatives in California&#x27;s 21st congressional district in 2012, but ultimately he did not run.

== Personal life ==
With his wife Arcelia, Bustamante has three children.

<doc id="295054" wikidata="Q490059" url="?curid=295054" title="Subclavian artery">
<text>In human anatomy, the subclavian arteries are paired major arteries of the upper thorax, below the clavicle. They receive blood from the aortic arch. The left subclavian artery supplies blood to the left arm and the right subclavian artery supplies blood to the right arm, with some branches supplying the head and thorax. On the left side of the body, the subclavian comes directly off the aortic arch, while on the right side it arises from the relatively short brachiocephalic artery when it bifurcates into the subclavian and the right common carotid artery.

The usual branches of the subclavian on both sides of the body are the vertebral artery, the internal thoracic artery, the thyrocervical trunk, the costocervical trunk and the dorsal scapular artery, which may branch off the transverse cervical artery, which is a branch of the thyrocervical trunk. The subclavian becomes the axillary artery at the lateral border of the first rib.

==Structure==
From its origin, the subclavian artery travels laterally, passing between anterior and middle scalene muscles, with the anterior scalene on its anterior side and the middle scalene on its posterior. This is in contrast to the subclavian vein, which travels anterior to the anterior scalene. As the subclavian artery crosses the lateral border of the first rib, it becomes the axillary artery.

On the right side, the subclavian artery arises from the brachiocephalic (innominate) artery behind the right sternoclavicular articulation; on the left side it springs from the arch of the aorta. The two vessels, therefore, in the first part of their course, differ in length, direction, and relation with neighboring structures. The left subclavian artery is around 9 cm long in adults, while the right subclavian artery is around 6 cm long. Both have a width of 9-12 mm.

=== Parts ===
In order to facilitate the description, each subclavian artery is divided into three parts:
* The first part, also known as the prescalene part, extends from the origin of the vessel to the medial border of the scalenus anterior muscle.
* The second part, also known as the scalene part, lies behind the anterior scalene muscle.
* The third part, also known as the postscalene part, extends from the lateral margin of the muscle to the outer border of the first rib, where it becomes the axillary artery.

The first portions of the two vessels require separate descriptions; the second and third parts of the two arteries are practically alike.

====First part====

=====Right subclavian artery=====
The first part of the right subclavian artery arises from the brachiocephalic trunk, behind the upper part of the right sternoclavicular articulation. It passes upward and lateralward to the medial margin of the scalenus anterior muscle. It ascends a little above the medial part of the clavicle.

It is covered, in front, by the integument, superficial fascia, the platysma muscle, deep fascia, the clavicular origin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the sternohyoid muscle, and the sternothyroid muscle, and another layer of the deep fascia. It is crossed by the internal jugular vein and the vertebral vein, by the vagus nerve and the cardiac branches of the vagus and sympathetic, and by the subclavian loop of the sympathetic trunk which forms a ring around the vessel. The anterior jugular vein is directed laterally in front of the artery, but is separated from it by the sternohyoid muscle and the sternothyroid muscle. Below and behind the artery is the pleura, which separates it from the apex of the lung. Behind the artery is the sympathetic trunk, the longus colli muscle and the first thoracic vertebra (T1). The right recurrent laryngeal nerve winds around the lower and back part of the vessel.

=====Left subclavian artery=====
The first part of the left subclavian artery arises from the aortic arch, behind the left common carotid artery, and at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra. It ascends in the superior mediastinal cavity to the root of the neck, and then arches lateralward to the medial border of the scalenus anterior muscle.

It is in relation, in front, with the vagus nerve, the cardiac nerves, and the phrenic nerves, which lie parallel with it, the left common carotid artery, left internal jugular and vertebral veins, and the commencement of the left innominate vein. It is covered by the sternothyroid muscle, the sternohyoid muscle, and the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Behind, it is in relation with the esophagus, thoracic duct, left recurrent laryngeal nerve, inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk, and the longus colli muscle; higher up, however, the esophagus and thoracic duct lie to its right side; the latter ultimately arching over the vessel to join the angle of union between the subclavian and internal jugular veins. Medial to it are the esophagus, trachea, thoracic duct, and left recurrent laryngeal nerve. Lateral to it are the left pleura and lung.

====Second part====
The second portion of the subclavian artery lies behind the scalenus anterior muscle and in front of the scalenus medius muscle. It is very short, and forms the highest part of the arch described by the vessel.

In front, it is covered by the skin, the superficial fascia, the platysma muscle, the deep cervical fascia, the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and the scalenus anterior muscle. On the right side of the neck, the phrenic nerve is separated from the second part of the artery by the scalenus anterior muscle, while on the left side it crosses the first part of the artery close to the medial edge of the muscle. Behind the artery are the pleura and the scalenus medius muscle. Above the artery is the brachial plexus. Below the artery is the pleura. The subclavian vein lies below and anterior to the artery, separated from it by the scalenus anterior muscle.

====Third part====
The third portion of the subclavian artery runs downward and lateralward from the lateral margin of the scalenus anterior muscle to the outer border of the first rib, where it becomes the axillary artery. This is the most superficial portion of the vessel, and is contained in the subclavian triangle.

It is covered, in front, by the skin, the superficial fascia, the platysma muscle, the supraclavicular nerves, and the deep cervical fascia. The external jugular vein crosses its medial part and receives the transverse scapular, transverse cervical, and anterior jugular veins, which frequently form a plexus in front of the artery. Behind the veins, the nerve to the Subclavius descends in front of the artery. The terminal part of the artery lies behind the clavicle and the Subclavius and is crossed by the transverse scapular vessels. The subclavian vein is in front of and at a slightly lower level than the artery. Behind, it lies on the lowest trunk of the brachial plexus, which intervenes between it and the scalenus medius muscle. Above and to its lateral side are the upper trunks of the brachial plexus and the omohyoid muscle. Below, it rests on the upper surface of the first rib.

===Branches===
The subclavian arteries give off five major arteries each: the vertebral artery, the internal thoracic artery, the thyrocervical trunk, the costocervical trunk, and the dorsal scapular artery.
===Development===
Embryologically, the left subclavian simply arises from the left 7th intersegmental artery, while the right subclavian arises, proximal to distal:

# right 4th aortic arch
# right dorsal aorta
# right 7th intersegmental artery

Essentially, the 4th aortic arch and dorsal aorta form the aortic arch on the left, but since the right dorsal aorta regresses distal to the right 7th intersegmental artery, on the right they form the proximal portion of the subclavian artery. Since the left subclavian is then a tributary of the left common carotid, they can be thought of as arising from the brachiocephalic trunk.

===Variation===
The subclavian arteries vary in their origin, their course, and the height to which they rise in the neck.

The origin of the right subclavian from the innominate takes place, in some cases, above the sternoclavicular articulation, and occasionally, but less frequently, below that joint. The artery may arise as a separate trunk from the arch of the aorta, and in such cases it may be either the first, second, third, or even the last branch derived from that vessel; in the majority, however, it is the first or last, rarely the second or third. When it is the first branch, it occupies the ordinary position of the innominate artery; when the second or third, it gains its usual position by passing behind the right carotid; and when the last branch, it arises from the left extremity of the arch, and passes obliquely toward the right side, usually behind the trachea, esophagus, and right carotid, sometimes between the esophagus and trachea, to the upper border of the first rib, whence it follows its ordinary course. In very rare instances, this vessel arises from the thoracic aorta, as low down as the fourth thoracic vertebra. Occasionally, it perforates the anterior scalene; more rarely it passes in front of that muscle. Sometimes the subclavian vein passes with the artery behind the Scalenus anterior. The artery may ascend as high as 4 cm. above the clavicle, or any intermediate point between this and the upper border of the bone, the right subclavian usually ascending higher than the left.

The left subclavian is occasionally joined at its origin with the left common carotid artery, forming a left brachiocephalic trunk.

The left subclavian artery is more deeply placed than the right in the first part of its course, and, as a rule, does not reach quite as high a level in the neck. The posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid corresponds pretty closely to the lateral border of the anterior scalene, so that the third portion of the artery, the part most accessible for operation, lies immediately lateral to the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid.

Some authors describe the subclavian artery as arising from the 7th intersegmental artery.

== Function ==
The subclavian arteries carry most of the blood that supplies the arms. It also supplies some blood to the neck and brain.

== Clinical significance ==
Compression of the subclavian artery can cause thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS).

The subclavian arteries can be vulnerable to aneurysm.

Subclavian steal syndrome occurs when there is occlusion or stenosis of the subclavian artery at a point before the branching of the vertebral artery. This can cause blood to flow the wrong way through the vertebral artery into the distal subclavian artery, allowed by the reduced pressure.

The subclavian arteries are relatively superficial, and can be seen using ultrasound.

Aberrant right subclavian artery is a condition where the right subclavian artery arises on the arch of aorta distal to the left subclavian artery, instead of brachiocephalic trunk. This condition occurs in about 0.4 to 1.8% of the general population. The aberrant right subclavian artery than has to cross behind the oesophagus to reach the right side of the body. Majority of those having the condition are asymptomatic, but some may be presented with difficulty in breathing, difficulty in swallowing, grating noise during breathing, and chest pain. This condition has to be ruled out during procedures relating to oesophagus because injury to this artery during the procedure can cause massive bleeding.

<text>Rio Convention relates to the following three conventions, which were agreed at the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992.

At the Earth Summit, the decision-making process was tailored to promote a sustainable planet for future generations. The key message entailed the idea that changes in behaviour could be the foundation needed for progress toward the desired transformation for the environment. The resulting documentation from the two-week deliberations and meetings included the following: Agenda 21 (a non-binding action plan of the United Nations promoting sustainable development), the Statement of Forest Principles, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, and the following Conventions were formed:

# UNFCCC, the abbreviation of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
# CBD, the abbreviation of Convention on Biological Diversity
# UNCCD, the abbreviation of United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification

== History ==
The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), also known as the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, the Rio Summit, the Rio Conference, and the Earth Summit, took place in Rio de Janeiro from June 3 to 14th in 1992. The conference was unprecedented and aimed to reassess economic development to preserve natural resources and discuss the problem of pollution. The decision-making process was tailored to promote a sustainable planet for future generations. The key message entailed the idea that changes in behaviour could be the foundation needed for progress toward the desired transformation for the environment. The resulting documentation from the two-week deliberations and meetings included the following: Agenda 21 (a non-binding action plan of the United Nations promoting sustainable development), the Statement of Forest Principles, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, and the following Conventions were formed: the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), and the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).

== Goals of the Three Rio Conventions ==

=== The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) ===
With 196 ratified parties, the Convention on Biological Diversity aims to conserve and protect biodiversity, biological resources and safeguard life on Earth, as an integral part of economic and social development. Considering biological diversity as a global asset to current and future generations and populations across the planet, the Convention works to prevent species extinction and maintain protected habitats. As well, the CBD promotes the sustainable use of the components of biological diversity, and works to maintain the environmental and sustainable process of access and benefit sharing, derived from genetic resource use.

Established on December 29th, 1993, the Convention on Biological Diversity works to maintain the following three objectives:

# “The conservation of biological diversity&quot;
# &quot;The sustainable use of the components of biological diversity&quot;
# &quot;The fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources” 

The CBD currently follows the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets, used as a vehicle to maintain synergies at National levels. Its mission is to “take effective and urgent action to halt the loss of biodiversity to ensure that by 2020, ecosystems are resilient and continue to provide essential services, thereby securing the planet’s variety of life, and contributing to human well-being, and poverty eradication.”

=== The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) ===
With 197 ratified parties, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is committed to the objective of “[stabilizing] greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Such a level should be achieved within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.” Following the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015 and previously the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, the UNFCCC Secretariat works to maintain the goals and objectives of the Convention, as the primary United Nations body whose role functions to address the threat of climate change.

=== The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) ===
The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) functions as an international agreement that ties the sustainability of land management and the issues of land degradation to the environment. Among the areas of consideration, the Convention focuses on restoring degraded ecosystems found in dryland areas. The UNCCD, consisting of 197 parties works towards creating “a future that avoids, minimizes, and reverses desertification/land degradation and mitigates the effects of drought in affected areas at all levels.”

Legislatively, the UNCCD is committed to achieving Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) and combat pressing environmental issues of Desertification, land degradation and drought (DLDD) through a newly created 2018-2030 Strategic Framework, consistent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development This framework follows the 10-year strategic plan and framework for 2008-2018 that aimed to establish global partnerships in working toward the reversal and prevention of desertification and land degradation. The UNCCD aims to restore the productivity of degraded land, while improving livelihoods and aiding populations that are vulnerable because of environmental destruction. “The Convention’s 197 parties work together to improve the living conditions for people in drylands, to maintain and restore land and soil productivity, and to mitigate the effects of drought.”

<doc id="295066" wikidata="Q942695" url="?curid=295066" title="Source lines of code">
<text>Source lines of code (SLOC), also known as lines of code (LOC), is a software metric used to measure the size of a computer program by counting the number of lines in the text of the program&#x27;s source code. SLOC is typically used to predict the amount of effort that will be required to develop a program, as well as to estimate programming productivity or maintainability once the software is produced.

==Measurement methods==
Multiple useful comparisons involve only the order of magnitude of lines of code in a project. Using lines of code to compare a 10,000-line project to a 100,000-line project is far more useful than when comparing a 20,000-line project with a 21,000-line project. While it is debatable exactly how to measure lines of code, discrepancies of an order of magnitude can be clear indicators of software complexity or man-hours.

There are two major types of SLOC measures: physical SLOC (LOC) and logical SLOC (LLOC). Specific definitions of these two measures vary, but the most common definition of physical SLOC is a count of lines in the text of the program&#x27;s source code excluding comment lines.

Logical SLOC attempts to measure the number of executable &quot;statements&quot;, but their specific definitions are tied to specific computer languages (one simple logical SLOC measure for C-like programming languages is the number of statement-terminating semicolons). It is much easier to create tools that measure physical SLOC, and physical SLOC definitions are easier to explain. However, physical SLOC measures are more sensitive to logically irrelevant formatting and style conventions than logical SLOC. However, SLOC measures are often stated without giving their definition, and logical SLOC can often be significantly different from physical SLOC.

Consider this snippet of C code as an example of the ambiguity encountered when determining SLOC:

for (i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) printf(&quot;hello&quot;); /* How many lines of code is this? */
In this example we have:
* 1 physical line of code (LOC),
* 2 logical lines of code (LLOC) (for statement and printf statement),
* 1 comment line.

Depending on the programmer and coding standards, the above &quot;line&quot; of code could be written on multiple separate lines:

/* Now how many lines of code is this? */
for (i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++)
 printf(&quot;hello&quot;);


In this example we have:
* 4 physical lines of code (LOC): is placing braces work to be estimated?
* 2 logical lines of code (LLOC): what about all the work writing non-statement lines?
* 1 comment line: tools must account for all code and comments regardless of comment placement.

Even the &quot;logical&quot; and &quot;physical&quot; SLOC values can have a large number of varying definitions. Robert E. Park (while at the Software Engineering Institute) and others developed a framework for defining SLOC values, to enable people to carefully explain and define the SLOC measure used in a project. For example, most software systems reuse code, and determining which (if any) reused code to include is important when reporting a measure.

==Origins==
At the time when SLOC was introduced as a metric, the most commonly used languages, such as FORTRAN and assembly language, were line-oriented languages. These languages were developed at the time when punched cards were the main form of data entry for programming. One punched card usually represented one line of code. It was one discrete object that was easily counted. It was the visible output of the programmer, so it made sense to managers to count lines of code as a measurement of a programmer&#x27;s productivity, even referring to such as &quot;card images&quot;. Today, the most commonly used computer languages allow a lot more leeway for formatting. Text lines are no longer limited to 80 or 96 columns, and one line of text no longer necessarily corresponds to one line of code.

==Usage of SLOC measures==

SLOC measures are somewhat controversial, particularly in the way that they are sometimes misused. Experiments have repeatedly confirmed that effort is highly correlated with SLOC, that is, programs with larger SLOC values take more time to develop. Thus, SLOC can be effective in estimating effort. However, functionality is less well correlated with SLOC: skilled developers may be able to develop the same functionality with far less code, so one program with fewer SLOC may exhibit more functionality than another similar program. Counting SLOC as productivity measure has its caveats, since a developer can develop only a few lines and yet be far more productive in terms of functionality than a developer who ends up creating more lines (and generally spending more effort). Good developers may merge multiple code modules into a single module, improving the system yet appearing to have negative productivity because they remove code. Furthermore, inexperienced developers often resort to code duplication, which is highly discouraged as it is more bug-prone and costly to maintain, but it results in higher SLOC.

SLOC counting exhibits further accuracy issues at comparing programs written in different languages unless adjustment factors are applied to normalize languages. Various computer languages balance brevity and clarity in different ways; as an extreme example, most assembly languages would require hundreds of lines of code to perform the same task as a few characters in APL. The following example shows a comparison of a &quot;hello world&quot; program written in BASIC, C, and COBOL (a language known for being particularly verbose).

Another increasingly common problem in comparing SLOC metrics is the difference between auto-generated and hand-written code. Modern software tools often have the capability to auto-generate enormous amounts of code with a few clicks of a mouse. For instance, graphical user interface builders automatically generate all the source code for a graphical control elements simply by dragging an icon onto a workspace. The work involved in creating this code cannot reasonably be compared to the work necessary to write a device driver, for instance. By the same token, a hand-coded custom GUI class could easily be more demanding than a simple device driver; hence the shortcoming of this metric.

There are several cost, schedule, and effort estimation models which use SLOC as an input parameter, including the widely used Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) series of models by Barry Boehm et al., PRICE Systems True S and Galorath&#x27;s SEER-SEM. While these models have shown good predictive power, they are only as good as the estimates (particularly the SLOC estimates) fed to them. Many have advocated the use of function points instead of SLOC as a measure of functionality, but since function points are highly correlated to SLOC (and cannot be automatically measured) this is not a universally held view.

===Example===
According to Vincent Maraia, the SLOC values for various operating systems in Microsoft&#x27;s Windows NT product line are as follows:

David A. Wheeler studied the Red Hat distribution of the Linux operating system, and reported that Red Hat Linux version 7.1 (released April 2001) contained over 30 million physical SLOC. He also extrapolated that, had it been developed by conventional proprietary means, it would have required about 8,000 person-years of development effort and would have cost over $1 billion (in year 2000 U.S. dollars).

A similar study was later made of Debian GNU/Linux version 2.2 (also known as &quot;Potato&quot;); this operating system was originally released in August 2000. This study found that Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 included over 55 million SLOC, and if developed in a conventional proprietary way would have required 14,005 person-years and cost US$1.9 billion to develop. Later runs of the tools used report that the following release of Debian had 104 million SLOC, and , the newest release is going to include over 213 million SLOC.

==Utility==
=== Advantages ===
# Scope for automation of counting: since line of code is a physical entity, manual counting effort can be easily eliminated by automating the counting process. Small utilities may be developed for counting the LOC in a program. However, a logical code counting utility developed for a specific language cannot be used for other languages due to the syntactical and structural differences among languages. Physical LOC counters, however, have been produced which count dozens of languages.
# An intuitive metric: line of code serves as an intuitive metric for measuring the size of software because it can be seen, and the effect of it can be visualized. Function points are said to be more of an objective metric which cannot be imagined as being a physical entity, it exists only in the logical space. This way, LOC comes in handy to express the size of software among programmers with low levels of experience.
# Ubiquitous measure: LOC measures have been around since the earliest days of software. As such, it is arguable that more LOC data is available than any other size measure.

=== Disadvantages ===
# Lack of accountability: lines-of-code measure suffers from some fundamental problems. Some think that it isn&#x27;t useful to measure the productivity of a project using only results from the coding phase, which usually accounts for only 30% to 35% of the overall effort.
# Lack of cohesion with functionality: though experiments have repeatedly confirmed that while effort is highly correlated with LOC, functionality is less well correlated with LOC. That is, skilled developers may be able to develop the same functionality with far less code, so one program with less LOC may exhibit more functionality than another similar program. In particular, LOC is a poor productivity measure of individuals, because a developer who develops only a few lines may still be more productive than a developer creating more lines of code – even more: some good refactoring like &quot;extract method&quot; to get rid of redundant code and keep it clean will mostly reduce the lines of code.
# Adverse impact on estimation: because of the fact presented under point #1, estimates based on lines of code can adversely go wrong, in all possibility.
# Developer&#x27;s experience: implementation of a specific logic differs based on the level of experience of the developer. Hence, number of lines of code differs from person to person. An experienced developer may implement certain functionality in fewer lines of code than another developer of relatively less experience does, though they use the same language.
# Difference in languages: consider two applications that provide the same functionality (screens, reports, databases). One of the applications is written in C++ and the other application written in a language like COBOL. The number of function points would be exactly the same, but aspects of the application would be different. The lines of code needed to develop the application would certainly not be the same. As a consequence, the amount of effort required to develop the application would be different (hours per function point). Unlike lines of code, the number of function points will remain constant.
# Advent of GUI tools: with the advent of GUI-based programming languages and tools such as Visual Basic, programmers can write relatively little code and achieve high levels of functionality. For example, instead of writing a program to create a window and draw a button, a user with a GUI tool can use drag-and-drop and other mouse operations to place components on a workspace. Code that is automatically generated by a GUI tool is not usually taken into consideration when using LOC methods of measurement. This results in variation between languages; the same task that can be done in a single line of code (or no code at all) in one language may require several lines of code in another.
# Problems with multiple languages: in today&#x27;s software scenario, software is often developed in more than one language. Very often, a number of languages are employed depending on the complexity and requirements. Tracking and reporting of productivity and defect rates poses a serious problem in this case, since defects cannot be attributed to a particular language subsequent to integration of the system. Function point stands out to be the best measure of size in this case.
# Lack of counting standards: there is no standard definition of what a line of code is. Do comments count? Are data declarations included? What happens if a statement extends over several lines? – These are the questions that often arise. Though organizations like SEI and IEEE have published some guidelines in an attempt to standardize counting, it is difficult to put these into practice especially in the face of newer and newer languages being introduced every year.
# Psychology: a programmer whose productivity is being measured in lines of code will have an incentive to write unnecessarily verbose code. The more management is focusing on lines of code, the more incentive the programmer has to expand their code with unneeded complexity. This is undesirable, since increased complexity can lead to increased cost of maintenance and increased effort required for bug fixing.

In the PBS documentary &quot;Triumph of the Nerds&quot;, Microsoft executive Steve Ballmer criticized the use of counting lines of code:

In IBM there&#x27;s a religion in software that says you have to count K-LOCs, and a K-LOC is a thousand lines of code. How big a project is it? Oh, it&#x27;s sort of a 10K-LOC project. This is a 20K-LOCer. And this is 50K-LOCs. And IBM wanted to sort of make it the religion about how we got paid. How much money we made off OS/2, how much they did. How many K-LOCs did you do? And we kept trying to convince them – hey, if we have – a developer&#x27;s got a good idea and he can get something done in 4K-LOCs instead of 20K-LOCs, should we make less money? Because he&#x27;s made something smaller and faster, less K-LOC. K-LOCs, K-LOCs, that&#x27;s the methodology. Ugh! Anyway, that always makes my back just crinkle up at the thought of the whole thing.

According to the Computer History Museum Apple Developer Bill Atkinson in 1982 found problems with this practice:

When the Lisa team was pushing to finalize their software in 1982, project managers started requiring programmers to submit weekly forms reporting on the number of lines of code they had written. Bill Atkinson thought that was silly. For the week in which he had rewritten QuickDraw’s region calculation routines to be six times faster and 2000 lines shorter, he put “-2000″ on the form. After a few more weeks the managers stopped asking him to fill out the form, and he gladly complied.

<text>The Exciters were an American pop music group of the 1960s. They were originally a girl group, with one male member being added afterwards. At the height of their popularity the group consisted of lead singer Brenda Reid, Herb Rooney, Carolyn Johnson and Lillian Walker.

==Career==
Brenda Reid, Carolyn (Carol) Johnson, Lillian Walker, and Sylvia Wilbur formed the group while at high school together in Queens, New York City, in 1961. They were originally called the Masterettes, as a sister group to another group called the Masters, and released their first recording, &quot;Follow the Leader&quot;, in early 1962. Wilbur then left the group to be replaced by Penny Carter, and they auditioned for Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, winning a recording contract. Penny Carter then left, and was replaced by Herb Rooney, a member of the Masters; Reid and Rooney later married.

The group&#x27;s name was changed to the Exciters, and their first hit record, arranged by Teacho Wiltshire and produced by Leiber and Stoller for United Artists Records, was &quot;Tell Him&quot;, which reached no. 4 on the U.S. pop chart in early 1963, and no. 12 in Canada. The song had previously been released unsuccessfully, as &quot;Tell Her&quot;, by Gil Hamilton later known as Johnny Thunder. According to Jason Ankeny at AllMusic, the Exciters&#x27; version of &quot;Tell Him&quot; &quot;...boasted an intensity that signified a sea change in the presentation and perception of femininity in popular music, paving the way for such tough, sexy acts as the Shangri-Las and the Ronettes.&quot;

Dusty Springfield was on a stop-over in New York City en route to Nashville to make a country music album with the Springfields in 1962, when she heard the Exciters&#x27; &quot;Tell Him&quot; playing while taking a late-night walk by the Colony Record Store on Broadway. The song helped Springfield decide to embark on a solo career with a pop/soul direction. She&#x27;d recall: &quot;The Exciters sort of got you by the throat...out of the blue comes blasting at you “I know something about love”, and that’s it. That’s what I wanna do.&quot;

Other songs by the group included &quot;He&#x27;s Got the Power&quot; (written by Ellie Greenwich and Tony Powers), &quot;Get Him&quot;, and Northern Soul classic &quot;Blowing Up My Mind&quot;. The Exciters also recorded &quot;Do-Wah-Diddy&quot;, written by Greenwich and Jeff Barry, in 1963; with a revised title of &quot;Do Wah Diddy Diddy&quot; it was covered shortly after by Manfred Mann, for whom it was an international hit. They were one of the opening acts for the Beatles during their first North American tour in August–September 1964. During this tour, they became the first black musicians to perform at the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Florida; the stadium&#x27;s management had initially refused to allow the Exciters to perform because of their race, but when the Beatles said they would refuse to perform too, the group was allowed to go on.

In 1965, the Exciters left the Leiber-Stoller management team, and the United Artists label, for Roulette Records. There they issued a remake (with revised lyrics) of the Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers&#x27; song &quot;I Want You to Be My Boy&quot;. They continued to record through the 1960s for Bert Berns&#x27; labels Bang and Shout, and later for RCA, but with little success. Ronnie Pace and Skip McPhee replaced Johnson and Walker. The group broke up in 1974.

In 1975, Brenda and Herb Rooney, credited as the Exciters, enjoyed a hit single in the UK with &quot;Reaching for the Best&quot;, produced by Rooney and young newcomer producer Ian Levine. The song was aimed at the British Northern soul scene but crossed over to the UK Singles Chart where it peaked at No. 31. As Brenda &amp; Herb, Reid and Rooney had a final R&amp;B chart hit in 1978 with &quot;Tonight I&#x27;m Gonna Make You A Star&quot;. The pair later separated, and Reid later launched a new version of the Exciters with members of her family. Brenda Reid and Lillian Walker still occasionally performed together as The Exciters.

Herb Rooney died in the early 1990s. Brenda and Herb Rooney&#x27;s son, Mark Cory Rooney, is a music business executive. Carolyn &#x27;Carol&#x27; Johnson died on May 7, 2007, aged 62. Lillian Walker-Moss died on February 5, 2023, at the age of 78. She had been battling angiosarcoma, a rare form of cancer.

<doc id="295074" wikidata="Q3298805" url="?curid=295074" title="Word of Wisdom (Latter Day Saints)">
<text>The &quot;Word of Wisdom&quot; is the common name of an 1833 section of the Doctrine and Covenants, a book considered by many churches within the Latter Day Saint movement to be a sacred text. The section defines beliefs regarding certain drugs, nutritious ingredients in general, and the counsel to eat meat sparingly; it also offers promises to those who follow the guidance of the Word of Wisdom.

As practiced by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the largest Latter Day Saint denomination, the Word of Wisdom explicitly prohibits the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, tea, and coffee (with tea and coffee being labeled as &quot;hot drinks&quot;), and recreational drug use, and encourages healthy practices such as nutritious eating, the sparing use of meat, regular exercise, proper hygiene, and getting sufficient rest.

Compliance with the Word of Wisdom is necessary in the LDS Church to become a member and to participate in various church functions, however, violation of the code is not normally cause for a church membership council.

==History==
=== Beginnings under Joseph Smith ===
Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, dictated the Word of Wisdom as a revelation from the Christian God was dictated on February 27, 1833. The Word of Wisdom was first published as a stand-alone broadsheet in December 1833. In 1835, it was included as Section LXXX (80) in the first edition of the Doctrine and Covenants. Brigham Young stated after Smith&#x27;s death that the revelation was given in response to problems encountered while conducting meetings in the Smith family home:

In February 1834, Joseph Smith proposed a resolution before the high council of the church that stated, &quot;No official member in this Church is worthy to hold an office after having the word of wisdom properly taught him; and he, the official member, neglecting to comply with and obey it.&quot; This resolution was accepted unanimously by the council. The charge of &quot;not observing the Word of Wisdom&quot; was later one of five leveled against David Whitmer (who was an apostle, and one of the Three Witnesses) on April 13, 1838, which led to his excommunication.

Joseph Smith is however recorded at various times drinking wine, beer, and tea, and using tobacco. One account by Amasa Lyman, a member of the First Presidency under Smith, reports that Smith once finished preaching a sermon on the Word of Wisdom and immediately afterward rode through the streets smoking a cigar. Similarly, Almon W. Babbitt stated &quot;that he had taken the liberty to break the Word of Wisdom, from the example of President Joseph Smith, Jun., and others, but acknowledged that it was wrong&quot; when he was brought before the church&#x27;s high council on August 19, 1835, on the charge of &quot;not keeping the Word of Wisdom&quot;. Joseph Smith had also been operating a hotel/tavern in Far West, Missouri, in 1838, and in June of that year, the high council of Far West felt compelled to remind Smith&#x27;s family that there was a ban on the sale and consumption of &quot;ardent spirits in the place&quot;.

=== Post-succession crisis ===
==== In the LDS Church ====
After Smith&#x27;s death, several factions emerged from the Latter Day Saint movement. The largest of these groups, the LDS Church, was led by Brigham Young. At a church general conference on September 9, 1851, Young called on the attendees to &quot;leave off the use of&quot; items mentioned in the Word of Wisdom:
The Patriarch John Smith] again rose to speak on the Word of Wisdom, and urging on the brethren to leave off using tobacco, &amp;c.

President Young rose to put the motion and called on all the sisters who will leave off the use of tea, coffee, &amp;c., to manifest it by raising the right hand; seconded and carried.

And then put the following motion; calling on all the boys who were under ninety years of age who would covenant to leave off the use of tobacco, whisky, and all things mentioned in the Word of Wisdom, to manifest it in the same manner, which was carried unanimously.&quot;

The Patriarch then said, may the Lord bless you and help you to keep all your covenants. Amen.

President Young amongst other things said he knew the goodness of the people, and the Lord bears with our weakness; we must serve the Lord, and those who go with me will keep the Word of Wisdom, and if the High Priests, the Seventies, the Elders, and others will not serve the Lord, we will sever them from the Church. I will draw the line, and know who is for the Lord and who is not, and those who will not keep the Word of Wisdom, I will cut off from the Church; I throw out a challenge to all men and women.
Though Young encouraged Mormons to follow the Word of Wisdom code, the church was tolerant of those who did not follow it. In 1860, Young counseled those chewing tobacco in church meetings to at least be discreet and not excessive, but did not charge users with sin. By 1870, he ended the practice of chewing and spitting tobacco in the Salt Lake Tabernacle.

Young also recognized a separation between using tobacco (which was discouraged), and selling it to non-Mormons as a business (which was encouraged). He also owned and maintained a bar in Salt Lake City for the sale of alcoholic beverages to non-Mormon travelers, on the theory that it was better for LDS Church authorities to run such establishments than for outsiders.

The modern LDS application of the Word of Wisdom has its beginnings in the presidency of Joseph F. Smith, who became LDS Church president in 1901 at a time when even notable church leaders drank alcohol and coffee. For example, George Albert Smith, apostle and later church president, &quot;took brandy for medicinal reasons&quot;, Anthon H. Lund, First Counselor in the First Presidency, &quot;enjoyed Danish beer and currant wine&quot;, Charles W. Penrose, Second Counselor in the First Presidency, &quot;occasionally served wine&quot;, Matthias F. Cowley, apostle, &quot;enjoyed Danish beer and currant wine&quot;, Brigham Young, Jr. and John Henry Smith, both apostles, argued in 1901 &quot;that the Church ought not interdict beer, or at least not Danish beer&quot;, and Emmeline B. Wells, of the Relief Society presidency (and who was later president of the Relief Society), &quot;drank an occasional cup of coffee&quot;. As church president, Joseph F. Smith emphasized the proscriptions on alcohol, tobacco, tea, and coffee. Adherence was still however not a prerequisite for entry into the temple, and in 1902 Smith encouraged stake presidents to be liberal when issuing temple recommends with old men who used tobacco and old ladies who drank tea. Of those who violated the revelation, it was mainly habitual drunkards that were excluded from the temple.

In 1921, LDS Church president Heber J. Grant finally made adherence to the Word of Wisdom a prerequisite for temple admission. Then, both the 1928 and 1934 editions of the Handbook — but not previous editions—listed &quot;liquor drinking&quot; and &quot;bootlegging&quot; among the &quot;transgressions which are ordinarily such as to justify consideration by the bishop&#x27;s court.&quot; To these the 1934 edition also added &quot;drunkenness.&quot; Violation of the Word of Wisdom is however not currently (no longer) cause for church discipline.

== Popular application ==
Adherence to the Word of Wisdom in the LDS Church is required for baptism and participation in the church (such as entry into the temple, full-time missionary service, and attendance at church schools), however the church instructs its leaders that violation of the Word of Wisdom is not normally cause for a church membership council and that church discipline &quot;should not be [used] to discipline or threaten members who do not comply with the Word of Wisdom&quot;.

A 2019 study of attitudes among Mormons within the U.S. said that a quarter to a half of such individuals interpret the Word of Wisdom in variance with the official interpretation by the LDS Church in some manner, and LDS Church leaders have counseled church members that they should not have personal interpretations of, or become extreme in their observance of the Word of Wisdom. One church leader specifically warned that adding additional unauthorized requirements, emphasizing it with excess zeal, or making it a &quot;gospel hobby&quot; is a sign of spiritual immaturity and sometimes apostasy.

=== Alcohol ===

LDS Church leaders teach that consumption of any form of alcohol, including beer, violates the Word of Wisdom, however, wine was used in the sacrament, and &quot;mild drinks&quot; (beers) were originally allowed.

=== Tobacco ===
In the LDS Church, tobacco is not allowed in any form, including smoking, chewing, or vaping.

=== Tea and coffee ===
The LDS Church prohibits tea and coffee, as interpreted from the mention of &quot;hot drinks&quot; in the scripture; it teaches that it does not matter whether or not the drinks are hot. It has not taken a clear position on decaffeinated tea or coffee.

There is generally thought to be no prohibition against drinking herbal tea, coffee substitutes such as Pero and Postum, hot chocolate, malt drinks such as Ovaltine and Milo, mate, or hot water.

==== Definition of the term &quot;hot drinks&quot; ====
&quot;Hot drinks&quot; is clarified for the LDS Church handbook:The only official interpretation of &quot;hot drinks&quot; (D&amp;C 89:9) in the Word of Wisdom is the statement made by early Church leaders that the term &quot;hot drinks&quot; means tea and coffee.In 1842, Smith&#x27;s brother Hyrum, who was the Assistant President of the Church and its presiding patriarch, provided an interpretation of the Word of Wisdom&#x27;s proscription of &quot;hot drinks&quot;:
And again &quot;hot drinks are not for the body, or belly;&quot; there are many who wonder what this can mean; whether it refers to tea, or coffee, or not. I say it does refer to tea, and coffee.
According to a book written by LDS missionary and hymnographer Joel H. Johnson in 1881, Joseph Smith shared Hyrum&#x27;s interpretation:
I understand that some of the people are excusing themselves in using tea and coffee, because the Lord only said &quot;hot drinks&quot; in the revelation of the Word of Wisdom ... Tea and coffee ... are what the Lord meant when He said &quot;hot drinks&quot;.

===Cola and other caffeinated beverages===
Since 2011 Church leaders have had no official position on ingesting caffeine, but church publications have made conflicting statements throughout the church&#x27;s history. A longstanding issue among members of the LDS Church is whether it is permissible to ingest drinks containing caffeine that are not tea or coffee. In 1918, Frederick J. Pack, a Mormon professor at the University of Utah, published an article in an official church magazine in which he reasoned that because Coca-Cola contained caffeine, which is also present in tea and coffee, Mormons should abstain from Coca-Cola in the same way that they abstain from the Word of Wisdom &quot;hot drinks&quot;. Since Pack&#x27;s article, many Mormons have come to believe that the reason tea and coffee are proscribed is the presence of caffeine in the drinks. However, the church has never stated that this is the reason for the prohibition.

The church does not have an official position on the consumption of caffeinated beverages, apart from the general statement that the Word of Wisdom does not specifically mention it. In 2012, in response to a report on Mormonism on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Rock Center with Brian Williams&quot;, which stated that LDS faithful were prohibited from drinking caffeine, the church wrote, &quot;the church revelation spelling out health practices ... does not mention the use of caffeine.&quot;

In the past, a number of church leaders have discouraged the use of such products. For example, in 1922, church president Heber J. Grant counseled the Latter-day Saints:
I am not going to give any command, but I will ask it as a personal, individual favor to me, to let coca-cola alone. There are plenty of other things you can get at the soda fountains without drinking that which is injurious. The Lord does not want you to use any drug that creates an appetite for itself.
Two years after making this statement, Grant met with a representative of The Coca-Cola Company to discuss the church&#x27;s position on Coca-Cola; at the conclusion of their second meeting, Grant stated that he was &quot;sure I have not the slightest desire to recommend that the people leave Coca-Cola alone if th[e] amount [of caffeine in Coca-Cola] is absolutely harmless, which they claim it is.&quot; Grant never again spoke out against the use of cola drinks.

Approximately fifty years later, the church issued an official statement which stated:
With reference to cola drinks, the Church has never officially taken a position on this matter, but the leaders of the Church have advised, and we do now specifically advise, against the use of any drink containing harmful habit-forming drugs under circumstances that would result in acquiring the habit. Any beverage that contains ingredients harmful to the body should be avoided.
Because of such statements, some adherents believe that caffeine is officially prohibited under the Word of Wisdom. In the mid-1950s, the director of the food services for Brigham Young University, a college owned by the LDS Church, decided not to sell caffeine on campus. This changed in September 2017 when BYU announced that caffeinated beverages would be sold on campus stating it was due to a change in responding to student requests. Official church publications have occasionally published articles by medical practitioners that warn of the health risks of consuming caffeine. In November 2010,&quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; stated that in the 2010 church &quot;Handbook&quot;, which sets out the official position of the church on health and social issues, no position on drinking Coca-Cola or caffeinated drinks was included. &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; concluded that the church &quot;takes no official position on caffeine&quot;.

The Word of Wisdom states that &quot;flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air ... are to be used sparingly&quot;, and that &quot;it is pleasing unto [God] that they should not be used, only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine.&quot;

Many LDS Church leaders have expressed their views on the subject of meat. In 1868, church president Brigham Young counseled, &quot;Flesh should be used sparingly, in famine and in cold.&quot; In 1868, apostle George Q. Cannon said, &quot;We are told that flesh of any kind is not suitable to man in the summer time, and ought to be eaten sparingly in the winter.&quot; From 1897 to 1901, apostle and then church president Lorenzo Snow repeatedly emphasized the importance of eating meat sparingly, teaching that church members should refrain from eating meat except in case of dire necessity, and that this should be seen in light of Smith&#x27;s teaching that animals have spirits. In 1895, Snow stated, &quot;Unless famine or extreme cold is upon us we should refrain from the use of meat.&quot; Apostle George Teasdale taught the same thing, and held that eating pork was a more serious breach of the Word of Wisdom than drinking tea or coffee. When Joseph F. Smith succeeded Snow as president of the church in 1901, he preached regularly against the &quot;unnecessary destruction of life&quot;, and emphasized kindness to animals and the important stewardship humans have toward them.

Despite these statements, restricting meat consumption was not given an explicit mention for worthiness in the LDS Church as the standards for obedience to the Word of Wisdom were made increasingly central to LDS Church doctrine and practice in the early 20th century. The increased emphasis on the Word of Wisdom took place during the presidency of Heber J. Grant, a long-time enthusiastic promoter of the Word of Wisdom. Although Grant did not emphasize restricting meat consumption, he continued to interpret it as part of the counsel in the Word of Wisdom. In the 1937 General Conference, at 80 years old, Grant said he worked long hours &quot;without fatigue and without feeling the least injury&quot;. He attributed his excellent health, in part, to eating very little meat.

In a 1948 LDS general conference address, apostle Joseph F. Merrill emphasized the importance of not eating meat as &quot;freely as many Americans are doing&quot;. In 1950, apostle and plant scientist John A. Widtsoe wrote, in relation to meat consumption, &quot;they who wish to be well and gain the promised reward stated in the Word of Wisdom must obey all of the law, not just part of it as suits their whim or their appetite, or their notion of its meaning.&quot; As recently as 2012, official church spokesperson Michael Otterson stated &quot;the church has also encouraged limiting meat consumption in favor of grains, fruits and vegetables.

To this day, the LDS Church&#x27;s hymnal includes a hymn with the following lyrics:
That the children may live long / And be beautiful and strong, / Tea and coffee and tobacco they despise, / Drink no liquor, and they eat / But a very little meat; / They are seeking to be great and good and wise.

A student manual published by the church has suggested that limiting the consumption of meat to the wintertime may be to some degree of the time in which the &quot;Word of Wisdom&quot; was delivered by Smith:This verse has caused some to ask if meat should be eaten in the summer. Meat has more calories than fruits and vegetables, which some individuals may need fewer of in summer than winter. Also, before fruits and vegetables could be preserved, people often did not have enough other food to eat in winter. Spoiled meat can be fatal if eaten, and in former times meat spoiled more readily in summer than winter. Modern methods of refrigeration now make it possible to preserve meat in any season. The key word with respect to the use of meat is &quot;sparingly&quot;.

=== Refined grain products ===
In a pamphlet written in 1930 called &quot;The Word of Wisdom&quot;, LDS Church apostle John A. Widtsoe taught that refined flour was contrary to the Word of Wisdom. The church, however, has never prohibited the use of refined flour.

=== Other areas ===
Speculation exists concerning the use of alcohol as a cooking ingredient or &quot;alcohol-free&quot; varieties of drinks. The LDS Church has taken no official stance on either.

Marijuana was banned by the LDS Church in August 1915. In 2019 the church clarified in &quot;New Era&quot; that medical marijuana should only be used &quot;under the care of a competent physician.&quot;Members should not use any substance that contains illegal drugs. Nor should members use harmful or habit-forming substances except under the care of a competent physician.

== Enstrom study regarding members of the LDS Church ==
A 14-year selective study conducted by UCLA epidemiologist James E. Enstrom tracked the health of 10,000 moderately active LDS Church members in California and ended in 1987.

Of these non-smoking, monogamous non-drinkers, Enstrom concluded from the study &quot;that LDS Church members who follow religious mandates barring smoking and drinking have one of the lowest death rates, including from cancer and cardiovascular diseases—close to half that of the general population. ... Moreover, the healthiest LDS Church members enjoy a life expectancy eight to eleven years longer than that of the general white population in the United States.&quot; For LDS high priests who exercised, had proper sleep, and never smoked cigarettes, the mortality rate was even lower.

The results were largely duplicated in a separate study of an LDS-like subgroup of white non-smoking churchgoers in Alameda County, California.

<text>In the philosophy of law, virtue jurisprudence is the set of theories of law related to virtue ethics. By making the aretaic turn in legal theory, virtue jurisprudence focuses on the importance of character and human excellence or virtue to questions about the nature of law, the content of the law, and judging.

==The topics encompassed by virtue jurisprudence==

Among the topics encompassed by virtue jurisprudence are:
# Virtue ethics has implications for an account of the proper ends of legislation. If the aim of law is to make citizens virtuous (as opposed to maximizing utility or realizing a set of moral rights), what are the implications for the content of the laws? 
# Virtue ethics has implications for legal ethics. Current approaches to legal ethics emphasize deontological moral theory, i.e. duties to clients and respect for client autonomy, and these deontological approaches are reflected in the various codes of professional conduct that have been devised for lawyers, judges, and legislators. 
# Accounts of the virtue of justice (in particular, Aristotle and Aquinas&#x27;s theories of natural justice) have implications for debates between natural lawyers and legal positivists over the nature of law. 
# A virtue-centered theory of judging, which describes the particular excellences required by judges.

==Aretaic theories of judging==
===The judicial virtues===

The most developed aspect of virtue jurisprudence is its distinctive theory of judging. A virtue-centered theory of judging offers an account of the characteristics or excellences that make for a good judge. These include: judicial temperance, judicial courage, judicial temperament, judicial intelligence, judicial wisdom, and justice. Although every theory of judging can incorporate some account of judicial virtue, a virtue-centered theory of judging makes the distinctive claim that the judicial virtues are central, &quot;i.e.&quot; that they have basic explanatory and normative significance.

===Criticisms of a virtue-centered theory of judging===

Many of the criticisms of virtue jurisprudence are parallel to those offered in the context of debates over virtue ethics. Some of these include:
* The charge that virtue jurisprudence does not provide sufficient guidance for making legal decisions. Advocates of virtue-centered theories of judging urge, &quot;Do as a virtuous judge would do!&quot; This formula provides little instruction to an ordinary decision maker, and it may encourage unedifying debates about the character--or lack thereof--of judges with whom one disagrees. Such virtue-centered standards may be too abstract to provide clear guidance, and may invite inappropriate personal attacks on judges&#x27; characters.
* The argument that virtue jurisprudence requires inordinate trust in the capacities of judges. In a democratic society, the rightness or wrongness of legal decisions should be decided by criteria that are public and accessible to all citizens. Judges who make decisions based on their own individual view of what an (ideally?) virtuous judge would do, may violate this publicity requirement by relying on a personal ideal of judging, rather than on established legal norms. 
* The claim that in modern liberal societies there is significant disagreement about what virtues a good or exemplary judge must possess. Some putative judicial virtues (e.g., impartiality, wisdom, open-mindedness, integrity, fairness, industriousness, and good temper) are relatively uncontroversial, while others (such as judicial restraint or sympathy for the underprivileged) are more contentious.

Other common criticisms of virtue jurisprudence include:
* The claim that rules play a more important role in law than they do in ethics. In law, for example, respect for the rule of law may require judges to decide cases primarily by invoking legal rules and other well-established legal norms. In ethics, there may be more scope for individualized judgment and discretion, as well as a greater focus on issues of personal character and flourishing.
* The argument that virtue jurisprudence, in virtue of its commitment to human flourishing as the proper aim of the law, can easily lead to illiberal values and misguided attempts to legislate morality.

==Virtue as the proper end of law==

Aristotle argued that the promotion of virtue was the proper end of law. Aquinas argued that true laws (which are rational) can teach virtue by being internalized by those who already possess sufficient virtue to grasp the purpose of the law. Even those who have not yet achieved this level of virtue can be coerced into obedience to the law, and this may enable them to become more virtuous.

A contemporary restatement of this view is found in the writings of Robert George. In his book, &quot;Making Men Moral&quot;, George argues for the promotion of virtue as the end of law and against the contrary views that the purpose of law is either the protection of rights or the general happiness.

==Law and virtue outside the Western tradition==

The phrase &quot;virtue jurisprudence&quot; is usually applied in the context of contemporary Western philosophical thinking about law. There are, however, important ideas about the relationship between law and virtue in other intellectual traditions. One example is provided by Confucian ideas about virtue. In the Analects, Confucius argues that a society in which people are virtuous would have no need of judges, rules, or jurisprudence because people would be able to resolve social conflicts by themselves. Thus, it is argued that the idea of virtue is opposed to the idea of law.

It can be argued that even virtuous citizens might disagree about the application of the law, especially where their own interests or ideological commitments are at stake. However, this argument is rather foreign to both traditional and modern Chinese political thought. Chinese political theory tends to assume that the truly virtuous are selfless to the point of martyrdom and would not consider their own personal interests and that the virtuous are able to transcend ideology. At the same time, traditional Chinese political thought regards those with absolute virtue to be historically extremely rare, and that most people, including the Emperor and his officials, are prone to both corruption and error. Consequently, there is a belief that law and indeed government is an unfortunate necessity in dealing with an imperfect world and with imperfect people.

The view that the inculcation of virtue is the proper end of legislation contrasts markedly with traditional Chinese thinking on the subject, which argues that laws exist because men are lacking in virtue. Confucianism places very little faith on the ability of law or external pressure to make men moral but rather believes that virtue must come from introspection and education. Throughout Chinese political and intellectual history, the Confucian view on law was frequently contrasted in discourse and practice with Chinese Legalist philosophy.

<text>Port Hawkesbury (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Baile a&#x27; Chlamhain&quot;) is a municipality in southern Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada. While within the historical county of Inverness, it is not part of the Municipality of Inverness County.

Their slogan is &quot;Opportunities Await&quot;.

== History ==

The end of glaciation began 13,500 years ago[5] and ended with the region becoming largely ice free 11,000 years ago. The earliest evidence of Palaeo-Indian settlement in the region follows rapidly after deglaciation.[6]

Several thousand years ago, the territory of the province became known a part of the territory of the Mi&#x27;kmaq nation of Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki. Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki includes what is now the Maritimes, parts of Maine, Newfoundland and the Gaspé Peninsula. The town of Port Hawkesbury is in the traditional Mi&#x27;kmaw district of Unama&#x27;ki.

In 1605, French colonists established the first permanent European settlement in the future Canada (and the first north of Florida) at Port Royal, founding what would become known as Acadia.[7][8] While the French established the first European settlements on Île Royale (as the French called Unama&#x27;ki) at present day Englishtown in 1629 and the following year at St. Peter&#x27;s, just 40 kilometres away from present-day Port Hawkesbury, neither settlement lasted past 1659. European settlers did not return to the island until Louisbourg were re-established by the French in 1713. By 1763 most of Acadia, including what had now become Cape Breton Island had come under British control.

Founded in 1789 as Ship Harbour, Port Hawkesbury was renamed in honour of Admiral Sir Edward Hawke, who commanded the ship that brought Governor Edward Cornwallis to Halifax. Incorporated in 1889, the community built ships for the timber export trade in the early and mid 19th century, such as the brig &quot;James,&quot; the subject of one of the earliest ship portraits in Canada.[4] Schooners and fishing boats were also built for the inshore and banks fishery by firms such as the noted boat builder H.W. Embree and Sons.

Today the town is largely a service centre for western Cape Breton Island, with many of its residents working in large industries, particularly the pulp and paper plant in the industrial park located in the adjacent community of Point Tupper, Richmond County.

== Government ==

The Town of Port Hawkesbury is governed by a council composed of a mayor and four councillors elected at-large. [23] The mayor is Brenda Chisholm-Beaton. Day to day activities are managed by a chief administrative officer (CAO) who is accountable to Council.[25]Municipal governments in Nova Scotia are elected every four years and the most recent round of elections took place on October 15, 2016.[26] The provincial legislation that creates and empowers the municipality is the Nova Scotia Municipal Government Act.[27]

Municipal Council is responsible for all facets of the municipal government, including directly delivered and shared or regional services. Directly delivered services include services such fire, public works, roads, as well as the municipally owned and operated electrical and water utilities. The municipality participates in shared services, such as library services and policing. The town&#x27;s municipal operating budget was $7.8 million in the 2018/19 fiscal year.[28]

Port Hawkesbury is represented in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly by Allan MacMaster, elected to the riding of Inverness, and in Canada&#x27;s House of Commons by Mike Kelloway, elected to represent the riding of Cape Breton—Canso.

== Economy ==
In 2006, the Port of Port Hawkesbury was the second largest by annual tonnage in Canada, second only to Vancouver, British Columbia, due to large volumes of crushed rock and gravel shipments and oil trans-shipments. It handled 31.6 million metric tonnes in 2006, of which 21.6 million tonnes was crude petroleum. By 2011, the volume of annual tonnage had dropped to 23.7 million tonnes, making it the 7th largest port in Canada.

The port is served by tugs of Svitzer Towing such as the tug &quot;Point Chebucto&quot;. Historically, it was a stop for American coastal steam ships.

Located in neighbouring Point Tupper, the Port Hawkesbury Mill began operation in 1962. The overwhelming majority of the paper produced is exported to the United States. The mill has the capability to produce nearly 400,000 tons of supercalendered paper, or 25–20% of the market for that type of paper. The mill was closed for a year 2011-12, following the 2008 financial crisis. However, by 2018, the company reported its annual order book was once again full.

== Geography ==

The land area of the municipality is 8.1 square kilometres with a population density (2016) of 396.6 persons per square kilometre. This compares to the provincial land area of 52,940 square kilometres and population density of 17.4 persons per square kilometre.

=== Climate ===
Port Hawkesbury experiences a Humid continental climate (Dfb). Due to the proximity to surrounding bodies of water, seasons tend to be delayed when compared to areas further inland. Precipitation is high, with the fall and winter being the wettest time of year and summer being the driest. Winters are cold, snowy and stormy with frequent snowstorms. Summer is the most pleasant time of year, with significantly less precipitation and warm temperatures.

The highest (reliable) temperature ever recorded in the strait area was on 7 July 1912 and 19 July 1975. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 7 February 1993.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Port Hawkesbury had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="295079" wikidata="Q912985" url="?curid=295079" title="Running back">
<text>A running back (RB) is a member of the offensive backfield in gridiron football. The primary roles of a running back are to receive handoffs from the quarterback to rush the ball, to line up as a receiver to catch the ball, and block. There are usually one or two running backs on the field for a given play, depending on the offensive formation. A running back may be a halfback (in certain contexts also referred to as a &quot;tailback&quot; ⁠ ⁠—  see below), a wingback, or a fullback. A running back will sometimes be called a &quot;feature back&quot; if he is the team&#x27;s key player/more prominent running back.

With the increase in pass-oriented offenses and single set back formations, it is more common to refer to these players as simply running backs.

==Halfback/tailback==
The halfback (HB) or tailback (TB) position is responsible for carrying the ball on the majority of running plays, and may frequently be used as a receiver on short (or sometimes long, depending on the system) passing plays.

In the modern game, an effective halfback must have a blend of both quickness and agility as a runner, as well as sure hands and good vision up-field as a receiver. Quarterbacks depend on halfbacks as a safety valve or checkdown receiver when primary targets downfield are covered or when they are under pressure. Occasionally, halfbacks line up as additional wide receivers.

When not serving either of these functions, the primary responsibility of a halfback is to aid the offensive linemen in blocking, either to protect the quarterback or another player carrying the football. If a team uses a Wildcat formation, often the halfback—instead of the quarterback—is the one who directly receives the snap. As a trick play, running backs are occasionally used to pass the ball on a halfback option play or halfback pass.

The difference between halfback and tailback is the position of the player in the team&#x27;s offensive formation. In historical formations, the halfback lined up approximately halfway between the line of scrimmage and the fullback (similarly, quarterbacks lined up a quarter of the distance between the line of scrimmage and the fullback). Because the halfback is usually the team&#x27;s main ball carrier (while the fullback is primarily a blocker), modern offensive formations have positioned the halfback behind the fullback (at the &quot;tail end&quot; of the formation), to take advantage of the fullback&#x27;s blocking abilities. As a result, some systems or playbooks will call for a tailback as opposed to a halfback.

In Canadian football, the term tailback is often used interchangeably with running back, while the use of the term halfback is often exclusively reserved for the defensive halfback, which refers to the defensive back halfway between the linebackers and the cornerbacks.

==Fullback==

In most modern college and professional football schemes, fullbacks (FB) carry the ball infrequently, instead using their stronger physiques as primary &quot;lead blockers&quot;. On most running plays, the fullback leads the halfback, attempting to block potential tacklers before they reach the ball carrier.

When fullbacks are called upon to carry the ball, the situation typically calls for gaining a short amount of yardage, such as scoring from the goal line, as the fullback can use his bulkiness to avoid being tackled early. While fullbacks do act as an eligible receiver, most plays call for the fullback to remain in the backfield and block any defensive players who make it past the offensive line, a skill referred to as &quot;blitz pickup&quot;. Fullbacks are technically running backs, but today the term &quot;running back&quot; is usually used in referring to the halfback or tailback. Although modern fullbacks are rarely used as ball carriers, in previous offensive schemes fullbacks would be the designated ball carriers.

In high school football, where player sizes vary greatly, fullbacks are still frequently used as ball carriers. In high school and college offenses, the triple option scheme uses the fullback as a primary ball carrier. The fullback plays a unique role by establishing an inside running threat on every play. College teams such as Georgia Tech and Air Force have employed the triple option scheme.

While in years past the fullback lined up on the field for almost every offensive play, teams often opt to replace the fullback with an additional wide receiver or a tight end in modern football. Fullbacks in the National Football League today rarely carry or catch the ball, since they are used almost exclusively as blockers. Fullbacks are also still used occasionally as rushers on plays when a short gain is needed for a first-down or touchdown or to surprise the defense since they are usually not expecting a fullback to run or catch the ball. In the past, fullbacks could even be a team&#x27;s featured back, using their larger size and strength as a &quot;power rusher&quot; to dominate the ground game. Pro Football Hall of Fame members Jim Brown, Marion Motley, Franco Harris, John Riggins, and Larry Csonka were fullbacks.

==Characteristics of a running back==

===Height and weight===

There is a diversity in those who play at the running back position. At one extreme are smaller (5&#x27;4&quot;–5&#x27;10&quot;), shiftier players. These quick, agile, and elusive running backs are often called &quot;scat backs&quot; because their low center of gravity and maneuverability allow them to dodge tacklers. Running backs known for their elusiveness include Red Grange, Hugh McElhenny, Gale Sayers, and Barry Sanders.

At the other extreme are &quot;power backs:&quot; bigger, stronger players who can break through tackles using brute strength and raw power. They are usually slower runners compared to other backs, and typically run straight ahead (or &quot;North-and-South&quot; in football terminology) rather than dodging to the outside edges of the playing field. Hall of Famers Earl Campbell, Bronko Nagurski, John Riggins, and Larry Csonka, as well as NFL all-time leading rusher Emmitt Smith, were considered power running backs. Derrick Henry, Mark Ingram II, Carlos Hyde, Nick Chubb, Kareem Hunt, and Leonard Fournette are all examples of current NFL power running backs.

More recently the NFL has turned to running backs who combine those traits such as Todd Gurley, Ezekiel Elliott, Dalvin Cook, and Saquon Barkley. These backs combine elusiveness with power and patience as well as receiving ability and blocking to become all around, three-down backs.

===Receiving ability===
Over the years, NFL running backs have been used as receivers out of the backfield. On passing plays, a running back will often run a &quot;safe route&quot;, such as a hook or a flat route, that gives a quarterback a target when all other receivers are covered or when the quarterback feels pressured. Hall of Famer Lenny Moore was a halfback who played primarily as a pass receiver.

Christian McCaffrey, is one of few players to have 1000 yards rushing and 1000 yards receiving in the same season in 2019. Some teams have a specialist &quot;third down back&quot;, who is skilled at catching passes or better at pass blocking and &quot;picking up the blitz&quot;, and thus is often put in the game on third down and long. It can also be used to fool the defense by making them think it is being put into the game for a pass play, when the play is actually a run. James White was used as a third-down back, or as an extra wide receiver. His receiving statistics exceed his rushing statistics, with 3,184 yards and 25 receiving touchdowns on 369 receptions, compared to 1,240 yards and 10 rushing touchdowns on 309 carries.

===Blocking===
Running backs are also required to help the offensive line in passing situations, and, in the case of the fullback, running plays. Running backs will regularly block blitzing linebackers or safeties on passing plays when the offensive line is occupied with the defensive linemen. On running plays, the fullback will often attempt to create a hole in the offensive line for the running back to run through. Effective blocking backs are usually key components for a running back&#x27;s success. On passing plays, a running back will stay back to help block and pick up the blitz

===Goal line backs===
Many teams also have a running back designated as a &quot;goal line back&quot; or &quot;short yardage specialist&quot;. This running back comes into the game in short yardage situations when the offense needs only a little bit of yardage to get a first down or a touchdown. Normally, when an offense gets inside the 5-yard line it sends in its goal line formation, which usually includes eight blockers, a quarterback, a running back, and a fullback. The closer it is to the goal line, the more likely it is to use this formation. If a certain running back is used often near the goal line, he may be called the &quot;goal line back.&quot; Short yardage and goal line backs often are power backs who are not prone to fumbling, who muscle through or push a large mass of defenders to get the first down or touchdown.

===As kick and punt returners===
Running backs are sometimes called upon to return punts and kickoffs, a role usually filled by wide receivers and cornerbacks, who are generally among the fastest players on the team. A running back, Brian Mitchell, currently holds the NFL records for career kickoff return yards (14,014 yards) and career punt return yards (4,999 yards).

==Value of running backs in the NFL==
In previous decades, the running back position was considered to be one of the more important skill positions in the NFL. In fact, as recently as the 1990s, the running back position was considered by some to be as important, if not more important, than the quarterback position. For example, in the history of the NFL draft, 23 running backs have been selected with the first overall pick, the most recent of these being Ki-Jana Carter in 1995. However, in the modern NFL, teams currently value running backs significantly less than they did in previous decades.

===Usage of analytics===

There are several possible explanations for the aforementioned shift in how teams have valued running backs. A common explanation for the shift is that teams have incorporated analytics into team-building. The analytics community has often considered the running back position to be the least important and most replaceable of any position in football. These analysts have defended this argument by noting that running back production is heavily dependent on offensive line play and offensive scheming rather than the ball carrier himself. Additionally, these analysts have noted that running back talent is replicable by citing that backups and mid-to-late round backs have often matched and sometimes exceeded the production of starting running backs or first-round backs. For example, in every season from 2019 to 2022, Dallas Cowboys backup running back Tony Pollard, a 2019 fourth-round selection, averaged more yards per carry than Dallas&#x27;s starting running back, Ezekiel Elliott, who was selected in the first round of the 2016 NFL draft. Furthermore, in 2022, star running back and 2017 first-round selection Christian McCaffrey, who began the season as the feature back for the Carolina Panthers, averaged 4.7 yards per carry in the team&#x27;s first six games of the season. After Carolina traded McCaffrey to the San Francisco 49ers before Week 7, running backs D&#x27;Onta Foreman and Chuba Hubbard, who were selected in the third round in 2017 and the fourth round in 2021, respectively, took over backfield duties for the Panthers. Foreman averaged 4.6 yards per carry as a Panther in 2022, which was similar to what McCaffrey averaged as a Panther that season. Meanwhile, Hubbard averaged 4.9 yards per carry as a Panther in 2022, which exceeded McCaffrey&#x27;s average yards per carry as a Panther that season. In other cases, the starting quarterback is a central component of the rushing attack. The Baltimore Ravens and Philadelphia Eagles had operated like this between the mid-2010s and early 2020s, though both teams made major free agent signings at running back in 2024 with Derrick Henry and Saquon Barkley respectively.

Analytics departments have also argued that offenses are more successful if they pass the ball more often. Passing plays have consistently averaged more yards than running plays in recent NFL history. Such analysts have argued that this is the case because during running plays, the defensive linemen, linebacking corps, and secondary all have a chance to tackle the ball carrier, but on passing plays, it is possible to effectively eliminate the defensive linemen, linebacking corps, and even the secondary from stopping the play. Furthermore, on passing plays, it is easier to gain additional yards when the ball is delivered to a receiver in open space, but it is not as easy for a running back to make defenders miss. This is especially the case when a running play is designed for the back to run between the tackles, and thus, through the teeth of the defense. Some analysts believe that running the ball is simply a complement to the passing game and will rarely win a team games. These analytical arguments may have also played a role in the NFL&#x27;s transition from a run-heavy to pass-happy offensive attack.

Because analytics have hinted at what it takes for rushing attacks to thrive, the widespread availability of productive and inexpensive running backs, and the efficiency of the passing offense, they may have served as the impetus for teams&#x27; transition to a passing offense and declining need for and valuation of traditional feature running backs.

===The rise of running back committees===
Another possible cause for the devaluation of running backs are the rise of running back committees. This is the practice of constructing a roster that has more than one featured running back. As of the 2023 NFL season, there are a number of running back committee setups present around the league, with the most common being the &quot;70-30 rotation&quot;, a setup which has a featured running back taking the majority of the snaps while one or more change of pace backs make up the rest. Other setups include the &quot;tandem backfields&quot;, which are setups that have two featured running backs splitting carriers, often with two different running styles, i.e. a power running back partnered with an elusive back or pass-catching back. One of the most famous of these setups was the tandem duo of Ricky Williams and Ronnie Brown as part of the 2008 Miami Dolphins. The last of these setups are &quot;full-blown&quot; committees, which often feature 3 or more running backs that are often cycled through throughout a game, with coaches often sticking to whomever is &quot;hot&quot; as the main running back. The running back by committee style has been popularized across the league because of how injury prone the position is and the effects of fatigue on players. Because of how successful this style of offense has been, the traditional &quot;workhorse&quot; back has become significantly less common.

Despite the rise of committees, &quot;workhorse&quot; running backs are still present, with a recent and prominent example being Derrick Henry of the Tennessee Titans, who, during the 2022 season, took nearly 90% of all of the Titans&#x27; carries that season.

===Long-term running back contracts===

Another possible explanation for the declining value NFL teams place on running backs is the risk of signing one to a lucrative, long-term deal. There are several examples of such contracts given to running backs that have backfired on teams. Most notably, before the 2018 NFL season, Los Angeles Rams star feature back Todd Gurley signed a 4-year extension for $60 million (with $45 million in guaranteed money). The deal made him the highest-paid running back in the NFL at the time. Although Gurley turned in another strong season in 2018 in which he led the league in rushing touchdowns and made a third Pro Bowl, an arthritis diagnosis hampered him during the 2018 Rams’ playoff run and in the 2019 NFL season. This led to the Rams releasing him after the conclusion of the 2019 season, meaning that Gurley did not play a down as a Ram for the time period that the team extended him for. Despite owing Gurley, who ended his playing career after the 2020 NFL season, a dead cap hit of $8.4 million for the 2021 NFL season, the Rams won that season&#x27;s Super Bowl LVI with an offense that ranked 24th in rushing but 5th in passing. The 2021 Rams opted to utilize a running back by committee approach and instead put greater focus on the passing attack.

On the other hand, several successful teams have survived without distributing significant financial capital towards running backs. In addition to the 2021 Los Angeles Rams, who won Super Bowl LVI in spite of the Gurley contract, the 2022 Kansas City Chiefs won Super Bowl LVII with an offense that finished 20th in rushing but 1st in passing. Seventh-round rookie running back Isiah Pacheco (who overtook the starting job from 2020 first-round selection Clyde Edwards-Helaire due to the latter&#x27;s injuries and suboptimal production) was Kansas City&#x27;s primary back during the team&#x27;s Super Bowl run. Out of the last 14 Super Bowl winners, only five of those teams paid their top rusher a base salary over $1 million, and only one of those five paid its top rusher a base salary of over $2 million, thus proving that a highly paid running back is not essential for winning.

Other examples of lucrative, long-term contracts given to running backs that backfired on teams include those given to Le&#x27;Veon Bell (4-year contract for $52.5 million, cut during year 2 of contract), Ezekiel Elliott (6-year extension for $90 million, cut after year 2 of extension), and David Johnson (3-year extension for $39 million, traded after year 1 of extension).

===Draft value===

Although drafting running backs in the first round of the NFL draft was commonplace throughout the 20th century, doing such is less commonplace and frequently criticized in the current era of NFL football. As previously mentioned, 23 running backs have been selected with the first overall pick in the history of the NFL Draft, but no running back has been selected first overall since 1995. However, football analytics departments view running back talent as replicable and thus believe that productive running backs can be drafted in the later rounds of the draft or signed to low-risk deals in free agency. For that reason, in recent years, teams with desires for a stronger rushing attack have passed on running backs during the first round and instead used those top draft picks on other needs or other positions that (according to analytics) are actually more responsible for rushing success, such as offensive linemen.

As teams have become more analytically inclined, they have not used their first round draft picks on running backs nearly as much as they used to. For example, from 1981 to 1985, more than half of all lead running backs were selected in the first round of the draft, but from 2016 to the present, that figure dipped to just over a quarter of all lead running backs. In fact, during the 2022 NFL draft, not a single running back was selected in the first round. The following year, when the Atlanta Falcons used the eighth overall pick to select running back Bijan Robinson, several analysts heavily criticized the Falcons and argued that they could have used the pick to fulfill another need and selected a productive running back in the later rounds. The Detroit Lions faced similar backlash for taking running back Jahmyr Gibbs with the twelfth overall pick in the 2023 NFL draft. Gibbs was considered a questionable pick because analysts felt that the pick could have been put to better use even with the known talent that Gibbs offered.

Despite the widespread criticism of drafting running backs in the first round, some observers have defended the practice if done in the right circumstances. For example, some writers defended the selection of Robinson in the first round due to his versatility and contributions to the passing attack while he was in college.

===Consequences of evolving team-building approaches on running backs===

Because teams have changed how they view the running back position, running back contracts have declined in value. For example, as of 2023, the average running back makes $1.808 million per season, which is less than what the average kicker makes ($2.196 million per season). Also, the franchise tag for running backs has decreased from $10.95 million in 2015 to $10.09 million in 2023. In fact, the running back position is the only position to see a decline in franchise tag value since 2015. Furthermore, in 2023, the franchise tag for running backs was the least valuable of franchise tags for any offensive or defensive position.

In recent years, NFL teams have shown that they are willing to move on from productive running backs once they are due for a big payday and instead replicate their production by taking advantage of cheaper alternatives such as their own backups, mid to late round draft picks, and low-risk free agent running backs. For example, during the 2023 NFL offseason, feature running backs Dalvin Cook, Ezekiel Elliott, Leonard Fournette, and Kareem Hunt, despite enjoying productive careers up to that point, were either released by the respective teams that they previously played for or allowed to leave during free agency. As of July 18, 2023 (the beginning of training camp for several NFL teams), the four aforementioned unemployed running backs have remained as such. Other productive running backs such as Las Vegas Raiders starting running back Josh Jacobs, New York Giants starting running back Saquon Barkley, and Dallas Cowboys backup running back Tony Pollard were franchise tagged by their respective teams during the 2023 offseason. The three aforementioned backs failed to agree to a long-term deal by the July 17 deadline. As of July 18, 2023, only Pollard has signed his franchise tender, while Barkley and Jacobs have yet to sign their tenders (Barkley would later agree to a separate one-year deal worth up to $11 million with the Giants on July 25, and Jacobs would later agree to a separate one-year deal worth up to $12 million with the Raiders on August 26). In other cases, productive running backs have accepted pay cuts due to a lack of leverage and/or the desire to contribute to teams. For example, Cincinnati Bengals feature back Joe Mixon took a pay cut before the 2023 season despite boasting a productive career resume to that point.

Due to the decline in value of running back contracts and the prolonged periods in which previously productive running backs (e.g. Elliott, Cook, Hunt, and Fournette) have remained unemployed, several running backs, such as Tennessee Titans running back Derrick Henry, have spoken out about the state of the running back market in 2023 and complained that running backs have not been provided with fair compensation for the services they provide.

<text>Leiber and Stoller were an American songwriting and record production duo, consisting of lyricist Jerome Leiber (; April 25, 1933 – August 22, 2011) and composer Michael Stoller (born March 13, 1933). As well as many R&amp;B and pop hits, they wrote numerous standards for Broadway.

Leiber and Stoller found success as the writers of such crossover hit songs as &quot;Hound Dog&quot; (1952) and &quot;Kansas City&quot; (1952). Later in the 1950s, particularly through their work with the Coasters, they created a string of ground-breaking hits—including &quot;Young Blood&quot; (1957), &quot;Searchin&#x27;&quot; (1957), and &quot;Yakety Yak&quot; (1958)—that used the humorous vernacular of teenagers sung in a style that was openly theatrical rather than personal. 

Leiber and Stoller wrote hits for Elvis Presley, including &quot;Love Me&quot; (1956), &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; (1957), &quot;Loving You&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t&quot;, and &quot;King Creole&quot;. They also collaborated with other writers on such songs as &quot;On Broadway&quot;, written with Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil; &quot;Stand By Me&quot;, written with Ben E. King; &quot;Young Blood&quot;, written with Doc Pomus; and &quot;Spanish Harlem&quot;, co-written by Leiber and Phil Spector. They were sometimes credited under the pseudonym Elmo Glick. In 1964, they launched Red Bird Records with George Goldner and, focusing on the &quot;girl group&quot; sound, released some of the notable songs of the Brill Building period.

In all, Leiber and Stoller wrote or co-wrote over 70 chart hits. They were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1985 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987.

==Biography==
===1950s===
Both born to Jewish families, Leiber came from Baltimore, Maryland, and Stoller from Queens, New York, but they met in Los Angeles, California, in 1950, where Stoller was a freshman at Los Angeles City College while Leiber was a senior at Fairfax High. Stoller had graduated from Belmont High School. After school, Stoller played piano and Leiber worked in Norty&#x27;s, a record store on Fairfax Avenue, and when they met, they found they shared a love of blues and rhythm and blues. In 1950, Jimmy Witherspoon recorded and performed their first commercial song, &quot;Real Ugly Woman&quot;. Stoller&#x27;s name at birth was Michael Stoller, but he later changed it legally to &quot;Mike&quot;.

Their first hit composition was &quot;Hard Times&quot;, recorded by Charles Brown, which was a rhythm and blues hit in 1952. &quot;Kansas City&quot;, first recorded in 1952 (as &quot;K. C. Loving&quot;) by rhythm &amp; blues singer Little Willie Littlefield, became a No. 1 pop hit in 1959 for Wilbert Harrison. In 1952, the partners wrote &quot;Hound Dog&quot; for blues singer Big Mama Thornton,
 which became a hit for her in 1953. The 1956 Elvis Presley rock and roll version, which was a takeoff of the adaptation that Presley picked up from Freddie Bell&#x27;s lounge act in Las Vegas, was an even bigger hit. Presley&#x27;s showstopping mock-burlesque version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, playfully bumping and grinding on the &quot;Milton Berle Show&quot;, created such public outcry and controversy that on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; they slowed down his act, with an amused Presley in a tuxedo and blue suede shoes singing his hit to a basset hound. Allen pronounced Presley &quot;a good sport&quot;, and the Leiber-Stoller song would be forever linked to Presley. Lieber and Stoller would afterwards write some songs for Presley as well.

Leiber and Stoller&#x27;s later songs often had lyrics more appropriate for pop music, and their combination of rhythm and blues with pop lyrics revolutionized pop, rock and roll, and punk rock.

They formed Spark Records in 1954 with their mentor, Lester Sill. Their songs from this period include &quot;Smokey Joe&#x27;s Cafe&quot; and &quot;Riot in Cell Block #9&quot;, both recorded by the Robins.

The label was later bought by Atlantic Records, which hired Leiber and Stoller in an innovative deal that allowed them to produce for other labels. This, in effect, made them the first independent record producers. At Atlantic, they revitalized the careers of the Drifters and wrote a number of hits for the Coasters, a spin-off of the Robins. Their songs from this period include &quot;Charlie Brown&quot;, &quot;Searchin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Yakety Yak&quot;, &quot;Stand By Me&quot; (written with Ben E. King), and &quot;On Broadway&quot; (written with Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil). For the Coasters alone, they wrote 24 songs that appeared in the US charts.

In 1955, Leiber and Stoller produced a recording of their song &quot;Black Denim Trousers and Motorcycle Boots&quot; with a white vocal group, the Cheers. Soon after, the song was recorded by Édith Piaf in a French translation titled, &quot;L&#x27;Homme à la Moto&quot;. The European royalties from another Cheers record, &quot;Bazoom (I Need Your Lovin&#x27;)&quot;, funded a 1956 trip to Europe for Stoller and his first wife, Meryl, on which they met Piaf. Their return to New York was aboard the ill-fated SS &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;, which was rammed and sunk by the Swedish liner MS &quot;Stockholm&quot;. The Stollers had to finish the journey to New York aboard another ship, the &quot;Cape Ann&quot;. After their rescue, Leiber greeted Stoller at the dock with the news that &quot;Hound Dog&quot; had become a hit for Elvis Presley. Stoller&#x27;s reply was, &quot;Elvis who?&quot; They would go on to write more hits for Presley, including the title songs for three of his movies—&quot;Loving You&quot;, &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;, and &quot;King Creole&quot;—as well as the rock and roll Christmas song, &quot;Santa Claus Is Back in Town&quot;, for Presley&#x27;s first Christmas album. 

On March 9, 1958, Leiber and Stoller appeared together on the TV panel quiz show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; as rock and roll composers of &quot;Hounddog&quot;, &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t&quot;. They were not household names and did not appear as celebrity mystery guests (a regular feature of the show) but as ordinary people with an unusual “line” of work. They even signed in under their own names, as the producers apparently were certain that the panel would not know who they were.

===Post-1950s===

In the beginning of the 1960s, they started Daisy Records and recorded Bob Moore and The Temps (with Roy Buchanan) on their label.

In the early 1960s, Phil Spector served an apprenticeship of sorts with Leiber and Stoller in New York City, developing his record producer&#x27;s craft while observing and playing guitar on their sessions, including the guitar solo on the Drifters&#x27; &quot;On Broadway&quot;.

After leaving the employ of Atlantic Records—where they produced, and often wrote, many classic recordings by the Drifters with Ben E. King—Leiber and Stoller produced a series of records for United Artists Records, including hits by Jay and the Americans (&quot;She Cried&quot;), the Exciters (&quot;Tell Him&quot;), and the Clovers (&quot;Love Potion #9&quot;, also written by Leiber and Stoller).

In the 1960s, Leiber and Stoller founded and briefly owned Red Bird Records, which issued the Shangri-Las&#x27; &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; and the Dixie Cups&#x27; &quot;Chapel of Love&quot;.

After selling Red Bird, they continued working as independent producers and songwriters. Their best-known song from this period is &quot;Is That All There Is?&quot; recorded by Peggy Lee in 1969; it earned her a Best Female Pop Vocal Performance Grammy. Earlier in the decade, they had a hit with Lee with &quot;I&#x27;m a Woman&quot; (1962).

Their last major hit production was &quot;Stuck in the Middle With You&quot; by Stealers Wheel, taken from the band&#x27;s 1972 eponymous debut album, which the duo produced. In 1975, they recorded &quot;Mirrors&quot;, an album of art songs with Peggy Lee. A remixed and expanded version of the album was released in 2005 as &quot;Peggy Lee Sings Leiber and Stoller&quot;. Also in 1975, they produced the Procol Harum album &quot;Procol&#x27;s Ninth&quot;, which included the UK Top 20 single &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; and a version of Leiber and Stoller&#x27;s &quot;I Keep Forgettin&#x27;&quot;.

In the late 1970s, A&amp;M Records recruited Leiber and Stoller to write and produce an album for Elkie Brooks; &quot;Two Days Away&quot; (1977) proved a success in the UK and most of Europe. Their composition &quot;Pearl&#x27;s a Singer&quot; (written with Ralph Dino &amp; John Sembello) became a hit for Brooks, and remains her signature tune. In 1978, mezzo-soprano Joan Morris and her pianist-composer husband William Bolcom recorded an album, &quot;Other Songs by Leiber and Stoller&quot;, featuring a number of the songwriters&#x27; more unusual (and satiric) works, including &quot;Let&#x27;s Bring Back World War I&quot;, written specifically for (and dedicated to) Bolcom and Morris; and &quot;Humphrey Bogart&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek song about obsession with the actor. In 1979, Leiber and Stoller produced another album for Brooks: &quot;Live and Learn&quot;.

In 1982, Steely Dan member Donald Fagen recorded their song &quot;Ruby Baby&quot; on his album &quot;The Nightfly&quot;. That same year, former Doobie Brothers member Michael McDonald released &quot;I Keep Forgettin&#x27; (Every Time You&#x27;re Near)&quot;, inspired by Leiber and Stoller&#x27;s &quot;I Keep Forgettin&#x27;&quot; for which they were eventually given a 50% songwriting credit.

====2000s====
In 2009, Simon &amp; Schuster published &quot;Hound Dog: The Leiber and Stoller Autobiography&quot;, written by Leiber and Stoller with David Ritz. As of 2007, their songs are managed by Sony/ATV Music Publishing.

With collaborator Artie Butler, Stoller wrote the music to the musical &quot;The People in the Picture&quot;, with book and lyrics by Iris Rainer Dart. Stoller and Butler&#x27;s music received a 2011 Drama Desk Award nomination.

On August 22, 2011, Leiber died in Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, aged 78, from cardio-pulmonary failure. He was survived by his sons Jed, Oliver, and Jake.

Stoller wrote both music and lyrics to the song &quot;Charlotte&quot;, recorded by Steve Tyrell and released in advance of the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina.

===Awards and honors===
Leiber and Stoller won Grammy awards for &quot;Is That All There Is?&quot; in 1969, and for the cast album of &quot;Smokey Joe&#x27;s Cafe&quot;, a 1995 Broadway musical revue based on their work. &quot;Smokey Joe&#x27;s Cafe&quot; was also nominated for seven Tony Awards, and became the longest-running musical revue in Broadway history.

===Legacy===
In the 1950s the rhythm and blues of the black entertainment world, up to then restricted to black clubs, was increasing its audience-share in areas previously reserved for traditional pop music, and the phenomenon now known as &quot;crossover&quot; became apparent.

Leiber and Stoller affected the course of modern popular music in 1957, when they wrote and produced the crossover double-sided hit by the Coasters, &quot;Young Blood&quot;/&quot;Searchin&#x27;&quot;. They released &quot;Yakety Yak&quot;, which was a mainstream hit, as was the follow-up, &quot;Charlie Brown&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Along Came Jones&quot;, &quot;Poison Ivy&quot;, &quot;Shoppin&#x27; for Clothes&quot;, and &quot;Little Egypt (Ying-Yang)&quot;.

They produced and co-wrote &quot;There Goes My Baby&quot;, a hit for the Drifters in 1959, which introduced the use of strings for saxophone-like riffs, tympani for the Brazilian &quot;baion&quot; rhythm they incorporated, and lavish production values into the established black R&amp;B sound, laying the groundwork for the soul music that would follow.

<text>Makalu (; ) is the fifth-highest mountain on Earth, with a summit at an elevation of AMSL. It is located in the Mahalangur Himalayas southeast of Mount Everest, on the China–Nepal border. One of the eight-thousanders, Makalu is an isolated peak shaped like a four-sided pyramid.

Makalu has two notable subsidiary peaks. Kangchungtse, or Makalu II (), lies about north-northwest of the main summit. Rising about north-northeast of the main summit across a broad plateau, and connected to Kangchungtse by a narrow, saddle, is Chomo Lonzo ().

==Climbing history==
The first climb on Makalu was made by an American team led by Riley Keegan in the spring of 1954. The expedition was composed of Sierra Club members including Bill Long and Allen Steck, and was called the California Himalayan Expedition to Makalu.
They attempted the southeast ridge but were forced to turn back at by a constant barrage of storms. A New Zealand team including Sir Edmund Hillary was also active in the spring, but did not get very high due to injury and illness. In the fall of 1954, a French reconnaissance expedition made the first ascents of the subsidiary summits Kangchungtse (October 22: Jean Franco, Lionel Terray, sirdar Gyalzen Norbu Sherpa and Pa Norbu) and Chomo Lonzo (likely on October 30: Jean Couzy and Terray).

===First ascent===

Makalu was first summited on May 15, 1955, by Lionel Terray and Jean Couzy of a French expedition led by Jean Franco. Franco, Guido Magnone and Gyalzen Norbu Sherpa summitted the next day, followed by Jean Bouvier, Serge Coupé, Pierre Leroux and André Vialatte on the 17th. This was an amazing achievement at the time, to have the vast majority of expedition members summit, especially on such a difficult peak. Prior to this, summits were reached by one to two expedition members at most, with the rest of teams providing logistical support before turning around and heading home. The French team climbed Makalu by the north face and northeast ridge, via the saddle between Makalu and Kangchungtse (the Makalu-La), establishing the standard route.

An ascent without oxygen was attempted by the 1960-61 Silver Hut expedition but neither of the two attempts succeeded.
===Notable ascents===


* 1955 &quot;North Face to Northeast Ridge&quot; FA by Lionel Terray and Jean Couzy of France.
* 1970: &quot;Southeast Ridge&quot; FA of ridge attempted by the Americans in 1954, was made by Y. Ozaki and A. Tanaka from Japan on May 23.
* 1971: The very technical &quot;West Pillar&quot; route was climbed in May by Frenchmen B. Mellet and Y. Seigneur.
* 1975: &quot;South Face&quot; – an expedition led by Aleš Kunaver reached the top of Makalu up its steep southern side, becoming the first Slovenes to summit an eight-thousander. The first amongst them was Stane Belak. This was the third ascent of an eight-thousand meter peak by a great mountain face and the highest peak successfully summitted without supplementary oxygen (Marjan Manfreda).
* 1976 – South pillar route completed by Czechoslovak expedition (first attempt in 1973 ended shortly before Makalu South at 8010m due to the fatal fall of Jan Kounický). Route goes via south buttress to Makalu South and then via southeast ridge. Makalu South was climbed by 11 expedition members. Two of them – Karel Schubert and Milan Kriššák summited main summit together with Jorge Camprubi from Spanish expedition which climbed southeast ridge. Karel Schubert died after bivouac near the summit.
* 1980: The second ascent of the &quot;West Pillar&quot; was completed in May by John Roskelley (summit), Chris Kopczynski, James States and Kim Momb, without Sherpa support and without bottled oxygen.
* 1981: On 15 October renowned Polish climber Jerzy Kukuczka ascended Makalu via a new route up the north-western side and north crest. Kukuczka climbed solo, in Alpine style, without supplemental oxygen.
* 1982 : On 10 October Polish climber Andrzej Czok ascended Makalu via West face till 8000m and north-western ridge. Camp IV was reached by two more climbers, Janusz Skorek and Andrzej Machnik, but when their first summit attempt failed, Czok decided to try one more time solo.
* 1988: Frenchman Marc Batard climbed in one day (after camps were set up) to the summit via the &quot;West Buttress&quot; on April 27.
* 1989: &quot;Direct South Face&quot;, solo new start by Frenchman Pierre Beghin to 1975 Yugoslav route.
* 1990: First female ascent, Kitty Calhoun via the West Pillar route.
* 1994: On May 15, the anniversary of the first summit (1955), Anatoli Boukreev and Neal Beidleman. Anatoli has planned a record speed ascent, but gave up that idea after realising his tent in camp III was destroyed by strong wind. He made an ascent in 46 hours.
* 1997: After seven failed attempts between 1977 and 1996, the West face was finally ascended. A Russian expedition led by Sergey Efimov brought Alexei Bolotov, Yuri Ermachek, Dmitri Pavlenko, Igor Bugachevski and Nikolai Jiline to the summit. This ascent won the 1998 Piolet d&#x27;Or.
* 2006: On or about January 27 the French mountaineer Jean-Christophe Lafaille disappeared on Makalu while trying to make the first winter ascent.
* 2009: Makalu was first climbed in winter on February 9, 2009, by Italian Simone Moro and Kazakh Denis Urubko. It was the final Nepali eight-thousander to be climbed in winter. Moro had previously made the first winter ascent of Shishapangma in winter 2005 with Pole Piotr Morawski.
* 2022: Ecuadorian Karl Egloff set a new speed record by ascending in 17 hours 18 minutes on May 8, 2022. He climbed without sherpa support and without bottled oxygen. 
* 2022: Adrian Ballinger made the first ski descent, skiing from 15m below the summit to the foot of the glacier.

<text>Girl Scouts of the United States of America (GSUSA), commonly referred to as Girl Scouts, is a youth organization for girls in the United States and American girls living abroad. 
It was founded by Juliette Gordon Low in 1912, a year after she had met Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of Scouting (formally Boy Scouts).

The stated mission of the Girl Scouts is to &quot;[build] girls of courage, confidence, and character, who make the world a better place&quot; through activities involving camping, community service, and practical skills such as first aid. Members can earn badges by completing certain tasks and mastering skills. More senior members may be eligible for awards, such as the Bronze, Silver, and Gold Awards. Membership is organized according to grade level, with activities designed for each level. The organization is a member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS).

==History==
===Girl Guides of America===

Girl Scouting in the United States began on March 12, 1912, when founder Juliette Gordon Low organized the first Girl Guide troop meeting in Savannah, Georgia. It has since grown to near 3.7 million members. From its inception, the Girl Scouts has been organized and run exclusively for girls.

Low was the granddaughter of Juliette Magill Kinzie and John Harris Kinzie, and her maternal grandparents were one of the earliest settlers of Chicago. Juliette Kinzie wrote about her experiences in the Northwest Territory (now the state of Wisconsin) in her book &quot;Wau-Bun: The Early Day&quot;. Low incorporated some of her grandmother&#x27;s experiences on the frontier into the traditions of Girl Scouts.

In late 1912, Low sought various mergers with similar organizations, including Camp Fire Girls and the Des Moines-based Girl Scouts of America, but was unsuccessful in any merging.

===Girl Scouts of the United States===

In 1913, the organization was renamed to Girl Scouts of the United States. Its headquarters was subsequently moved to Washington, D.C.

In 1915, the organization was incorporated, and its headquarters was moved to New York City. The organization was renamed for the final time to Girl Scouts of the United States of America in 1947. The organization received a congressional charter on March 16, 1950.

By 1920, the organization reached nearly 70,000 members. In 1930, that number had expanded to over 200,000 members. As of 2013, there were over 3.2 million Girl Scouts: 2.3 million youth members and 890,000 adult members. More than 50 million American women have participated in Girl Scouts throughout its history.

In 1923, Girl Scouts were organized into patrols, troops, local councils, and a National Council. Initially, troops had a high degree of independence, but over time, councils were formed between troops. Today there are over 300 councils across the United States.

The Juliette Gordon Low Historic District in Savannah, Georgia, became the national Girl Scout program center in 1956. Upon Low&#x27;s death in 1927, she willed her carriage house, at 330 Drayton Street, which eventually became The Girl Scout First Headquarters, to the local Savannah Girl Scouts for continued use.
===Desegregation===
Most Girl Scout units were originally segregated by race according to state and local laws and customs. The first troop for African American girls was founded in 1917; the first American Indian troop was formed in New York State in 1921; and the first troop for Mexican Americans was formed in Houston, Texas, in 1922. In 1933, Josephine Groves Holloway founded unofficial African American troops in Tennessee. She also fully desegregated the Cumberland Valley council in 1962. The first official African American troop in the South was founded in 1932 in Richmond, Virginia. It was created by Maggie Lena Walker and Lena B. Watson, but was led by Lavnia Banks, a teacher from Armstrong High School. It first met in Hartshorn Hall at Virginia Union University.

By the 1950s, GSUSA had begun significant national efforts to desegregate the camps and maintain racial balance. One of the first desegregations, accomplished by Murray Atkins Walls in 1956, was at Camp Shattuck in Kentucky. Later the same year, Martin Luther King Jr. described Girl Scouts as &quot;a force for desegregation&quot;. In 1969, a Girl Scout initiative called Action 70 was created that aimed to eliminate prejudice. Gloria D. Scott, an African American, was elected national president of GSUSA in 1975.

===Wing Scouts===

The Wing Scouts was a Senior Girl Scout program for girls interested in aviation. It was started in 1941 and ended in the 1970s. In July 1942, 29 troop leaders from 15 states met in Philadelphia for Wing Scout leadership training. They returned to their councils and began the creation of Wing Scout troops. In 1959, the council in San Mateo County, California was presented with an offer from United Airlines to start an aviation program for Senior Girl Scouts. A highlight of the Wing Scout program was a courtesy flight provided to Senior Girl Scouts using United Airlines aircraft. For many of the girls, the flight was their first time being in an airplane. Senior Girl Scouts who had been in the program for three years were given the opportunity to temporarily take control of a small aircraft during flight. The program was discontinued after United Airlines experienced financial issues in the 1970s.

==Age levels==

In 1938, the age divisions consisted of Brownies (ages 7 through 9), Intermediates (ages 10 through 13), and Seniors (ages 14 through 18).

In 1965, the age divisions were changed to include Brownies (ages 7 and 8, or 2nd and 3rd grade), Juniors (ages 9 through 11, or 4th through 6th grade), Cadettes (ages 11 through 14, or 7th through 9th grade), and Seniors (ages 14 through 18, or 10th through 12th grade).

The Daisy program for kindergarten-age girls was started in 1984. The Daisy program succeeded a 1976 pilot program known as Pixies.

In 2003, the Studio 2B program was introduced for Cadettes and Seniors. Under the Studio 2B programs, girls were able to work on traditional badges as well as Studio 2B activities, and the Silver Award and Gold Award requirements were altered to require both. Studio 2B activities differed from badges in that each booklet focused on a topic such as environmentalism or self-confidence rather than being skill-based like a badge.

On October 1, 2008, all levels were renamed to begin with &quot;Girl Scout&quot; (e.g., Girl Scout Brownies instead of Brownie Girl Scouts). Additionally, levels were changed to an exclusively grade-based system, A new level, Girl Scout Ambassadors, was created for girls in grades 11 and 12. Sixth grade girls were reclassified from Junior level to Cadette level in order to conform with the broad reclassification of 6th grade as a middle school grade. The new levels were tested in approximately six councils during the spring of 2008 and were instituted nationally after October 1, 2008.

As of 2024, Girl Scouts can begin in kindergarten and join all the way through 12th grade. The age divisions are Daisies (kindergarten and 1st grade), Brownies (2nd and 3rd grade), Juniors (4th and 5th grade), Cadettes (6th through 8th grade), Seniors (9th and 10th grade), and Ambassadors (11th and 12th grade).

Although troop membership is the most common way to participate in Girl Scouting, girls who do not have a local troop, or those who are unable or unwilling to participate in their local troop, can still sign up as individual Girl Scouts. Individual Girl Scouts were known in the early years of Girl Scouting as Lone Scouts and later as Juliettes; they attend activities independently and work individually on badges and awards. In 2015–2016, the term Juliette was phased out at the national level, in favor of the term Independent Girl Scouts, although some councils still use the term, Juliette.

===Mariner Scouts===
The 20th National Council of GSUSA launched the Mariner Girl Scout program in October 1934. Similar to the Boy Scouts of America&#x27;s Sea Scouting, the program was designed for older Girl Scouts interested in outdoor water-based activities. By the end of 1934, 12 Mariner ships were registered and the first two handbooks, &quot;launching a Girl Scout Mariner Ship&quot; and &quot;Charting the Course of a Girl Scout Mariner Ship,&quot; were published. The Mariner Girl Scout program remains active but in a smaller form; most girls have instead joined Sea Scouting, which has been coed since 1971.

===Special programs===
Programs are available for girls in specific circumstances that may make it difficult for them to participate in standard programs. The Girl Scouts &quot;Beyond Bars program&quot; helps daughters of incarcerated mothers connect with their mothers and helps mothers participate in Girl Scout activities. Another program, Girl Scouting in Detention Centers, allows girls who are themselves in detention centers to participate in Scouting. Other initiatives try to help girls in rural areas or in public housing. There are also programs for American girls living overseas, and girls whose families are experiencing homelessness or are living in temporary housing.

==Organizational structure==

The national organization is headquartered in New York City. It is headed by a chief executive officer and a 30-member board of directors. Bonnie Barczykowski currently serves as the chief executive officer and was officially appointed in February 2023. The president of the board of directors is Noorain Khan.

Councils operate below the national leadership; they usually cover a large portion of a state or geographic region. Some councils own and run camps for the troops within their area of responsibility. Councils are usually subdivided into areas, variously known as neighborhoods, service units, or associations. These are program delivery areas that consist of troops at all age levels in a smaller area, such as a town.

The basic unit is the troop which may or may not be sponsored. In contrast to Boy Scout troop-chartered organizations, Girl Scout troop sponsors do not own the troop. Troops range in size from as small as 5 to as large as 30 or more girls and may be divided into several patrols of 8 or fewer girls.

===Realignment===
In 2004, Girl Scouts of the USA hired a consultant &quot;to help Girl Scouts develop a strategy to ensure our future success and growth.&quot; Six &quot;gap teams&quot; looked at ways Girl Scouts could improve its structure in order to ensure the future growth and success of the organization. This followed declines in both membership and revenue, as well as challenges in subsidizing programs in urban areas. The governance gap team found that consolidation decreased confusion and provided economies of scale and recommended an optimal council size of approximately 10,000 girls. This left 312 regional Girl Scout councils, which administrate 236,000 local troops and other groups. In 2004, the board of directors consolidated the 312 councils into 109 councils.

In response to the consolidation, the Manitou Girl Scout council in Wisconsin sued GSUSA in the district court, alleging a breach of the Girl Scout charter. The suit was summarily dismissed with prejudice. The Seventh U.S. Circuit of Appeals overturned the decision, stating that a Girl Scout council agreement &quot;was no different than a Dunkin&#x27; Donuts franchise.&quot; The decision of the appeals court maintained the status of the Manitou council. As a result, there are 112 Girl Scout councils in the United States.

==Insignia==
===Promise, Law, Motto, and Slogan===
Promise

The Girl Scout Promise can be communicated in English, Spanish, or in American Sign Language, carrying the same meaning:
&lt;poem&gt;On my honor, I will try:
To serve God* and my country,
To help people at all times,
And to live by the Girl Scout Law

* Members may substitute for the word God
in accordance with their own spiritual beliefs.&lt;/poem&gt;

The Promise is often recited at Girl Scout troop meetings while holding up the three middle fingers of the right hand, forming the Girl Scout sign. Girl Scout policy states that the organization does not endorse or promote any particular philosophy or religious belief. The movement is nonsectarian and secular. In this context, the word &quot;God&quot; may be interpreted by each Girl Scout depending on her individual spiritual beliefs, and Girl Scouts are free to substitute the word consistent with their beliefs, such as &quot;Creator&quot;, &quot;my faith&quot;, &quot;Allah&quot;, etc. Many Girl Scouts use the word &quot;Community&quot; or &quot;Good&quot; as a substitution.

Law

The current version of the 
Girl Scout Law reads as follows:
&lt;poem&gt;I will do my best to be
honest and fair,
friendly and helpful,
considerate and caring,
courageous and strong, and
responsible for what I say and do,
and to
respect myself and others,
respect authority,
use resources wisely,
make the world a better place, and
be a sister to every Girl Scout.&lt;/poem&gt;

The Girl Scout Law has been changed several times since 1912. The original Girl Scout Law written by Juliette Gordon Low was:

Motto

Be prepared.

Slogan

Do a good turn daily.

===Girl Scout uniforms===
Girl Scout uniforms have changed significantly over the years from the original navy blue in 1912, to khaki in 1914, to the familiar green. The evolution has included uniforms with the specificity to designate each age level of Girl Scouting. Since 2008, Girl Scouts at each level have one required element (tunic, sash or vest) for the display of official pins and awards which will be required when girls participate in ceremonies or officially represent the Girl Scout Movement.

For girls ages 5 to 14, the unifying look includes wearing a choice of a tunic, vest, sash for displaying official pins and awards, combined with their own solid white shirts and khaki pants or skirts. Girl Scouts in high school can also wear a scarf that unites their look with the sisterhood of Girl Scouts around the world. For adult members the unifying look of the uniform is a Girl Scout official scarf or tie for men, worn with the official membership pins, combined with their own navy-blue business attire. Girl Scouts at the Daisy and Brownie levels will continue to have a full uniform ensemble available.

The adult uniform also changed, with registered women and men wearing navy blue business attire, again from their regular wardrobes. Also available for women are official sweaters and an insignia scarf, while men have the option of an official tie.

For all levels, earned awards go on the front of the vest or sash following official placements. Fun patches can be displayed on the back of a vest or sash. Girl Scout Daisies can choose a blue vest or a smock with a full uniform or white shirt and khaki pants and skirt. They have their own Daisy pin and a choice of accessories. Girl Scout Brownies can choose a traditional brown vest or sash to be worn with the historic Brownie pin and other uniform pieces or white shirt and khaki pants or skirts. Girl Scout Juniors wear their official vest or sash to display insignia including awards, coupled with a white shirt and khaki pants or skirt. Girl Scout Cadettes, Seniors, and Ambassadors can choose a khaki sash or vest to go with khaki pants or skirt and a white shirt.

===Logos===
 The emblem designed by Juliette Gordon Low was the only emblem used for Girl Scout pins through 1980. At the 1978 GSUSA National Convention, the use of two logos was voted on, allowing Girl Scouts to pick which they wanted to wear as their Girl Scout pin (for Girl Scout Juniors and up).

The current Girl Scouts of the USA logo is a rejuvenation of the original logo based on Saul Bass&#x27; 1978 design, Bass being a graphic designer known for his motion picture title sequences and design of various other well-known logos. In 2010, the hair and facial styles were updated by Jennifer Kinnon and Bobby C. Martin Jr. of The Original Champions of Design.

==Activities and programs==
One of the original and continuing attractions of Girl Scouts is that girls become proficient campers and participate in many outdoor activities such as canoeing or backpacking with their troops. Troops do service projects such as carrying out flag ceremonies, collecting food for food drives, visiting nursing homes, and Christmas caroling or other community services. Troops may also plan and take extended trips within the United States or even to another country. Troops may organize cultural or learning events such as first-aid training or attending live theater. The Girl Scout activity most familiar to the general public may be the annual sale of Girl Scout Cookies, which started in 1917 as a money-earning opportunity for councils and troops.

===Girl Scouts and STEM===
Girl Scouts has incorporated STEM-related programs and badges to encourage more interest in Scouts in STEM fields. From 2005 to 2007, more than 8.6 million STEM-related badges were earned. The first STEM-related Girl Scout badges, though, can be traced back to the 1913 Electrician and Flyer Badges. The first computer-related badges appeared in the 1980s. In 2001, The Girl Scout Research Institute, published a 36-page report about the need for more encouragement to get girls into the field of technology. An even larger push for STEM programs came after a 2012 study by the Girl Scout Research Institute reported that 74% of teenage girls were interested in courses in STEM subjects while only 25% of STEM industry jobs were held by women. Recent endeavors to encourage interest in STEM fields amongst Girl Scouts includes partnerships with companies like NASA, AT&amp;T, and Lockheed Martin. NASA specifically paired the Girl Scouts with the SETI Institute to create a 5-year space education program called &quot;Reaching for the Stars: NASA Science for Girl Scouts.&quot; The most recent push to help Girl Scouts imagine a future in STEM was the Girl Scout&#x27;s appearance at the International Consumer Electronics Show in January 2016 to show off Digital Cookie 2.0, a website made in partnership with Dell and Visa, that helps Girl Scouts manage their cookie business online.

There are four Girl Scout FIRST Robotics Competition teams: Space Cookies Team 1868, Lady Cans Team 2881, Gadget Girls Team 4816, and Tin Mints Team 4574. The Space Cookies are based at NASA Ames Research Center and were the first all-girls team to reach the finals at FRC world championships. They are known for their extensive community outreach and work to expand menstrual equity and eliminate period poverty. The Space Cookies helped launch the Girl Scout STEM Pledge, a national initiative to reduce the gender gap in STEM fields by bringing millions of girls into the STEM pipeline.

Girl Scouts currently has 127 badges and journeys under the STEM category. In 2020, Girl Scouts announced the addition of 24 new badges in STEM, entrepreneurship, and leadership.

The Automotive, Coding for Good, Cybersecurity, Mechanical Engineering, and Robotics badges are all series of three awards that cover different areas in their respective topics. These badges can be earned separately but are all related by the topic that they cover. Additionally, these badges mostly have the same name across levels, but have unique requirements for each level that get more complex and in-depth through the different age levels.

In June 2017, Girl Scouts announced a partnership with Palo Alto Networks to create 18 cybersecurity badges by September 2018.

==International convention==
Every three years Girl Scouts holds an international convention, featuring voting on policies and procedures, as well as guest speakers and activities and events for upwards of 10,000 girls and Girl Scout alums. The 2020 convention was conducted virtually due to concerns about COVID-19, and the latest convention was held in 2023 at Walt Disney World in Florida.

===Destinations===

Once known as &quot;Wider Opportunities&quot; or Wider Ops, Destinations are travel opportunities for individual older Girl Scouts. Destinations are held within the United States and in other countries. Destinations are primarily international, outdoor, science, people, or apprenticeship oriented, such as kayaking in Alaska, or career oriented such as learning about working for NASA.

A &quot;Destination&quot; may be a trip to one of the WAGGGS World Centers:

* Our Cabaña in Cuernavaca, Mexico
* Our Chalet in Adelboden, Switzerland
* Pax Lodge in London, England
* Sangam World Centre in Pune, India
*Kusafiri in Africa

==Traditions==
The Girl Scouts of the USA have many customs and traditions: camping, community service, singing, and money earning to support their activities. The Girl Scout Handshake and the Girl Scout signal for silence are two shared by WAGGGS member organizations. Other traditions include the Friendship Circle with &quot;the squeeze,&quot; taking bandanas and homemade sit-upons on camping trips, and the buddy system.

&quot;Bridging&quot; is the process of going from one level to another. Bridging is usually done at the troop level, although area bridgings are often held. The girls that are bridging walk across a bridge to their new level and are greeted with the Girl Scout Handshake. A bridging ceremony takes place in San Francisco, where Girl Scout Juniors transition to Cadettes by crossing the Golden Gate Bridge.

World Thinking Day and &quot;Girl Scouts&#x27; Own&quot; are traditions throughout the world of Girl Scouting. World Thinking Day has occurred annually since 1926 on February 22, the birthday of both Robert Baden-Powell and Olave Baden-Powell. On World Thinking Day, Girl Scouts and Guides around the world think about their sisters in other lands; Councils or local service units (associations) hold a celebration on or near this day, in which each participating troop gives a presentation of the culture and customs of a country selected by the troop. Many Girl Scouts in America celebrate Juliette Gordon Low&#x27;s birthday on October 31, Founder&#x27;s Day. The parties often include the girls dressing up in Halloween costumes and serving birthday cake.

A &quot;Girl Scouts&#x27; Own&quot; is a special ceremony that expresses the spirit of Girl Scouting when the girls reflect upon their feelings about Girl Scouting and the world around them. A &quot;Girl Scouts&#x27; Own&quot; can have any theme, or none at all. It is a solemn time given for Girl Scouts to create a moment of their very own. It can be held at any time and include the girls&#x27; troop or be held at any inter-troop gathering.

==Badges and other awards==
All levels of Girl Scouts can earn badges. Each level has specific badges that can be earned. Daisies earn badges shaped like flowers. Brownies earn badges shaped like triangles. Juniors earn badges shaped like circles. Cadettes earn badges shaped like diamonds. Seniors earn badges shaped like rectangles. Ambassadors earn badges shaped like squares.

Earned Badges and Awards are worn on the front of a Girl Scout&#x27;s vest (or sash). Fun Patches are worn on the back of the vest. Daisies wear blue vests. Brownies wear brown vests. Juniors wear green vests. Cadettes, Seniors, and Ambassadors wear khaki vests. For Cadettes, Seniors, and Ambassadors, a Girl Scout may choose to wear the same khaki vest for all three levels. Active Girl Scouts, who earn a lot of badges, may opt to get a new khaki vest when they change levels, so they have more room to display their awards.

===Skill building badges===

===Journey awards===
Each level of Girl Scouting has multiple Journey programs. A Journey is a series of lessons on a particular topic. The Journeys are made up of multiple parts and all parts of the Journey must be earned for it to be complete. A Girl Scout who completes three Journeys at one level earns a Summit Pin. Before beginning work on a Bronze, Silver, or Gold Award project, a Girl Scout must complete one Journey at her level. A Girl Scout who did not earn her Silver Award must complete two Journeys at her current level, instead of one, to work on her Gold Award.

===Additional awards===
Girl Scouts can earn other awards, usually represented by pins. Some of these awards are: Leadership Torch, Community Service Bar, Service to Girl Scouting Bar, Bronze Cross, Medal of Honor, Cookie Activity Pin, Safety Pin, My Promise My Faith Pin, Counselor in Training I &amp; II, Volunteer in Training, World Thinking Day Award, and Global Action Award.

Girl Scouts can also earn and display on their uniform awards from outside organizations, such as the religious emblems from religious organizations, or the President&#x27;s Volunteer Service Award.

===Highest awards===
The highest achievement in Girl Scouting is the Girl Scout Gold Award, which can only be earned by Girl Scout Seniors and Ambassadors. The highest award for Girl Scout Cadettes is the Silver Award, and Bronze Award is the highest award for Girl Scout Juniors. These awards require large-scale service projects showing leadership along with service hours.

The Gold Award is the highest honor a Girl Scout can earn. This award can be earned by Girl Scout Seniors and Girl Scout Ambassadors. This prestigious award represents a Girl Scout&#x27;s dedication and commitment to Girl Scouting and to her community. Earning the Girl Scout Gold Award requires hard work and a willingness to take on significant responsibility. For many, the leadership and organizational skills and sense of community and commitment that come from earning the Gold Award set the foundation for a lifetime of active citizenship. The Gold Award project takes a minimum of 80 hours to complete.

The Silver Award, the highest honor a Girl Scout Cadette can earn, gives girls the chance to do big things and make their community better in the process. The Silver Award takes the participants through a seven-step process: identify an issue, build a Girl Scout Silver Award team, explore the community needs, choose a project, develop the project, make a plan, and put it into motion. The Silver Award project takes a minimum of 50 hours to complete.

The Bronze Award, the highest honor a Girl Scout Junior can earn, requires girls to learn the leadership and planning skills necessary to follow through on a project that makes a positive impact on her community. Working toward this award demonstrates a Girl Scout&#x27;s commitment to helping others, improving her community and the world, and becoming the best she can be. The Bronze Award project takes a minimum of 20 hours to complete.

===Adult recognition===
There are also GS awards for adults including: Outstanding Volunteer, Outstanding Leader, Appreciation Pin, Honor Pin, Thanks Badge, and Thanks Badge II. Outstanding Volunteer is awarded for Outstanding service as Girl Scout volunteer (other than a leader). Outstanding Leader is awarded for Outstanding service as Girl Scout leader. Appreciation Pin is awarded for exceptional performance beyond expectations for the position. The Honor Pin recognizes an adult member who has delivered exceptional service beyond expectations to two or more geographic areas, service units or program delivery audiences in a way that furthers the council&#x27;s goals. Thanks Badge recognizes outstanding service for a Council as a whole or the Girl Scout Movement as a whole. Different GS councils use different terminology for regions within their council. Thanks Badge II is awarded where the recipient has received the Thanks Badge and the recipient&#x27;s service continues to merit further recognition. At least one nomination, two endorsements, and a review of the forms is required for each of these awards.

==Effect on American life==
Among the many famous American Girl Scouts are Taylor Swift, Sonia Sotomayor, Dakota Fanning, Lucille Ball, Katie Couric, and Elizabeth Dole. Many Girl Scouts have become successful leaders in numerous professional fields such as law, medicine, politics, journalism, and science. Beginning with Lou Henry Hoover, the incumbent First Lady has served as the Honorary President of GSUSA. Lou Henry Hoover was also the actual President of the Girl Scouts from 1922 to 1925 and Chairman of the National board of directors from 1925 to 1928. A 1994 &quot;Chronicle of Philanthropy&quot; poll showed Girl Scouts ranked by the public as the eighth &quot;most popular charity/non-profit in America&quot; among more than 100 charities.

During World War I and World War II, girls involved in Scouts helped the Allied forces by selling defense bonds, growing victory gardens, and collecting waste fat and scrap iron. Girl Scouts also spread their values into their communities through community service projects such as soup kitchens and food drives.

Over twenty of NASA&#x27;s female career astronauts were former Girl Scouts. The first American woman to spacewalk was a former Girl Scout, Dr. Kathryn Sullivan.

===&quot;The American Girl&quot;===
The Girl Scouts published their own magazine from 1917 to 1979. The name changed from &quot;The Rally&quot; (1917–1920) to &quot;The American Girl&quot; (eventually dropping &quot;The&quot;). Circulation exceeded 200,000 in the 1940s, and reached as high as 510,000 per month by 1949. It can be confused with &quot;American Girl&quot; magazine, 1992–2019.

===Girl Scout Senior Roundups===

International Girl Scout gatherings named Senior Roundups were held every three years from 1956 until 1965:
* Milford, Michigan (1956) attended by 5,000 girls
* Colorado Springs, Colorado, from July 3, 1959, to July 12, 1959, with 10,000 girls
* Button Bay, Vermont from July 18, 1962, to July 31, 1962, with 9,000 girls
* Farragut Reservation, Idaho, from July 17, 1965, to July 26, 1965, with 12,000 girls

==Issues==

===Religion===

====Non-sectarian founding====
When the Girl Scouts were first organized, the organization claimed to be &quot;non-sectarian in practice as well as theory&quot;. By the early 1920s, Catholic Girl Scout units had been founded in New York, Philadelphia, Washington and other cities. In the 1920s, about 2,000 Girl Scouts were Catholic. During this time, the organization upheld standards which were consistent with the beliefs of the Catholic religion. From its founding in 1912, it had Jewish leaders and scouts.

====&quot;To serve God&quot; in the Promise====

Since 1993, Girl Scouts have been able to substitute something appropriate to their own beliefs for the phrase &quot;To serve God&quot; in the Girl Scout Promise. This option appears in the guidelines distributed to adult volunteers but not in the actual girls&#x27; books. Official volunteer documentation contains this note:

This note or a shorter variant also frequently appears on local council web pages.

Volunteers are reminded &quot;to be sensitive to the spiritual beliefs of the girls in your group and to make sure that everyone in the group feels comfortable and included in Girl Scouting&quot; and to feel free to share the policy with the girls&#x27; families.

The policy change was prompted by lawsuits and attempts to be more inclusive. Atheist parents sued the Boy Scouts of America in 1991 for denying membership in the Cub Scouts to their sons. Considering this news, the Totem Girl Scout Council of Seattle attempted to change the Girl Scout Promise to make mention of &quot;God&quot; optional, which would be more inclusive of local non-theist Native American and Southeast Asian girls. After the national organization asserted this could not be changed locally, the Seattle council advocated that the change be adopted nation-wide. In November 1992, the parents of Nitzia Cuevas-Macias sued for their daughter to be permitted to participate in the Girl Scouts even though she refused to promise to serve God.

On October 23, 1993, at the Girl Scouts of the USA annual national convention, delegates voted 1,560 &quot;yes&quot; against 375 &quot;no&quot; to permit individuals to substitute another word or phrase for &quot;God&quot; in their promise. The convention gave this explanation:

This policy change settled the Cuevas-Macias lawsuit.

Some consider that the Girl Scouts of the USA have not gone far enough in making Scouting open to non-theists; others that they have gone too far in removing God or that they are violating the constitution of the WAGGGS. In 2017, some parents still find the perceived religious aspects of the Girl Scouts enough of a reason not to sign up their daughters to participate. The WAGGGS constitution requires member societies to maintain membership standards to include a promise similar to the one established by Baden-Powell, which includes the concept of duty to God. The GSUSA policy adopted in 1993 led to the 1995 formation of an alternative organization, the American Heritage Girls that accepts only leaders and chartering organizations that agree with a specific Christian statement of faith. The organization had a little over 5,000 members in 2006. According to the organization, membership as of 2017 is over 43,000.

====Prayer at meetings====
The official Girl Scout policy does not ban or require prayer.

====Religious pin====

Girl Scouts of the USA has an optional &quot;My Promise, My Faith&quot; pin which girls in all grades may earn. Girls may also do religious recognition programs and wear the resulting emblem on their uniform; however, these are created and administered by the religious organizations and not by the Girl Scouts directly.

===Sexuality and gender issues===
Girl Scouts of the USA stated in an October 1991 letter:

GSUSA upholds a &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t evangelize&quot; policy on sexuality. The debate over this issue is split between those who feel that the policy should avoid and prevent discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, and those who question the inclusion of lesbians.

In October 2011, the Girl Scouts of Colorado council publicly stated, &quot;If a child identifies as a girl and the child&#x27;s family presents her as a girl, Girl Scouts of Colorado welcomes her as a Girl Scout&quot;, when overturning a local troop&#x27;s rejection of a seven-year-old transgender girl. In July 2015, the Girl Scouts of Western Washington returned a $100,000 donation after the donor stipulated that the money could not be used to support services for transgender Scouts. The group then set up an online fundraising campaign to recoup the lost funds, ultimately raising $250,000.

In January 2012, a teen in California created a video calling for the boycott of Girl Scout Cookies in response to the Girl Scouts&#x27; policy of inclusion for transgender girls. The viral video became a rallying cry for both supporters and opponents of the group&#x27;s stance on transgender members. In February 2016, Robert James Carlson, the Roman Catholic archbishop of St. Louis, urged parishioners to cut ties with the Girl Scouts over the group&#x27;s embrace of LGBT rights.

The Girl Scouts themselves defended their actions against this. &quot;For 100 years, Girl Scouts has prided itself on being an inclusive organization serving girls from all walks of life. We handle cases involving transgender children on a case-by-case basis, with a focus on ensuring the welfare and best interests of the child in question and the other girls in the troop as our highest priority.&quot;

===Local objections to sex education sponsored by Planned Parenthood in Waco, Texas===
GSUSA is not aligned with and does not endorse, at the national level, the reproductive health organization Planned Parenthood; Girl Scout councils may choose to have or not have connections with Planned Parenthood. In 2003, in Waco, Texas, the local Bluebonnet Council was listed as a co-sponsor, with the Girl Scouts logo printed on the promotional flyer, of the Planned Parenthood of Central Texas event titled &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool &#x27;03: Dating, Love, Sex &amp; HIV.&quot; In 2004, the same Council promoted a Planned Parenthood education event without providing money nor sending Girl Scouts to it. This was criticized by some anti-abortion movement supporters and social conservatives, resulting in a local attempt to boycott Girl Scout cookies sold by the Bluebonnet Council. Waco residents responded to the announced boycott by purchasing a record number of cookies, and the Bluebonnet Council dropped promotion of the event. A month later, GSUSA CEO Kathy Cloninger went on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show, defending the Bluebonnet Council&#x27;s decision to sever ties with Planned Parenthood.

===The Radical Brownies===
In 2014, Marilyn Hollinquest and Ana Yvette Martinez, both women of color, founded the Radical Brownies, a community group for girls of color in Oakland, California. Similar to the GSUSA, but created specifically for girls of color, the Radical Brownies endeavors to &quot;empower and encourage&quot; girls of color and cultivate sisterhood and community bonds between them.

According to the Radical Brownies&#x27; mission statement at the time of its founding, its aim was to empower young girls of color to &quot;step into their collective power&quot; and to make the world a more &quot;radical&quot; place. The Radical Brownies wear brown berets and vests in homage to the Brown Berets and Black Panther movements. The group&#x27;s members, ages 8–12 years old, can earn badges in &quot;radical beauty,&quot; &quot;food justice,&quot; and &quot;radical self-love.&quot;

====Name controversy====
In February 2015, despite Radical Brownies co-founder Hollinquest clarifying that the group claimed no affiliation with the GSUSA, the GSUSA contacted the Radical Brownies organization and informed them that their troop&#x27;s name and uniforms caused &quot;some confusion&quot; among GSUSA membership. According to GSUSA Chief Communications Officer Kelly Parisi, once the founders of the Radical Brownies were notified of the misunderstanding, they offered to change the group&#x27;s name.

In May that same year, the Radical Brownies renamed themselves the Radical Monarchs.

The city of Savannah dedicated their annual &quot;Georgia Day&quot; to Juliette.

==Similar organizations==

Camp Fire Girls was founded in 1910, two years prior to the Girl Scouts, by some of the creators of the Boy Scouts of America. In 1975, the group became co-educational and soon afterwards changed its name to &quot;Camp Fire Boys and Girls&quot;. The name was changed to Camp Fire USA in 2001 and to Camp Fire in 2012. As of 2009, the group has a membership of about 750,000.

Various religious groups have established their own youth clubs such as Missionettes (now Mpact Girls) for the Assemblies of God. Little Flowers Girls&#x27; Club is a Catholic-focused girls club. GEMS Girls&#x27; Clubs is a non-denominational group with a Calvinist/Reformed background. Pioneer Girls started as a Methodist group but is non-denominational. The Masonic Lodge which requires belief in a Supreme Being has their own set of service organizations targeted at young and teenage girls, The International Order of the Rainbow for Girls and Job&#x27;s Daughters International.

One youth group explicitly set up as a Christian alternative to the Girl Scouts is the American Heritage Girls (AHG), started in 1995 in West Chester, Ohio, by a group of parents upset with available female Scouting organizations. AHG is a Christian organization that states that it is &quot;a nonprofit organization dedicated to the mission of building women of integrity through service to God, family, community and country.&quot; As of 2020, it claims a membership (adult and youth) of over 50,000.

<doc id="295093" wikidata="Q1431637" url="?curid=295093" title="Kahului Airport">
<text>Kahului Airport is the main airport of Maui in the state of Hawaii, United States, located east of Kahului. It has offered full airport operations since 1952. Many flights into Kahului originate from the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu; the Honolulu–Kahului corridor is one of the heaviest-trafficked air routes in the US, ranking 13th in 2004 with 1,632,000 passengers.

The FAA/IATA airport code OGG pays homage to aviation pioneer Bertram J. &quot;Jimmy&quot; Hogg, a Kauai native who worked for what is now Hawaiian Airlines, flying aircraft ranging from eight-passenger Sikorsky S-38 amphibians to Douglas DC-3s and DC-9s into the late 1960s.

It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2021–2025, in which it is categorized as a medium-hub primary commercial service facility.

== History ==
Construction started on Naval Air Station Kahului in 1942. After the war, extensive negotiations between the Territory of Hawaii and the Navy resulted in the airbase being turned over to the Hawaii Aeronautics Commission. The Kahului Airport began commercial airline operations in June 1952.

== Authority ==
Kahului Airport is part of a centralized state structure governing all of the airports and seaports of Hawaii. The official authority of Kahului Airport is the Governor of Hawaii. The governor appoints the Director of the Hawaii State Department of Transportation, who has jurisdiction over the Hawaii Airports Administrator.

The Hawaii Airports Administrator oversees six governing bodies: Airports Operations Office, Airports Planning Office, Engineering Branch, Information Technology Office, Staff Services Office, and Visitor Information Program Office. Collectively, the six bodies have authority over the four airport districts in Hawaii: Hawai&#x27;i District, Kaua&#x27;i District, Maui District and the principal O&#x27;ahu District. Kahului Airport is a subordinate of Maui District officials.

== Facilities and aircraft ==

The Kahului Airport terminal building has ticketing, USDA agricultural inspection, and baggage claim areas on the ground level.

Sixteen jetways are available for enplaning or deplaning passengers. Gates with odd numbers have a jetway, while the rarely used gates with even numbers have stairs that lead to the ramp below. The main passenger terminal is divided into two areas, north and south. The south area houses Gates 1–16 with seven aircraft parking positions (sized for four narrow-body and three wide-body aircraft). The north area houses Gates 17–39 with nine aircraft parking positions (sized for three narrow-body and six wide-body aircraft). Inter-island gates are Gates 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, and 21. Overseas gates are Gates 1, 5, 7, 23, 27, 29, 33, 35, and 39.

Most of the gates were spaced to handle narrow-body aircraft like the Boeing 717 and 737 used on inter-island flights. In 1982–83 Kahului started receiving nonstop flights from the United States mainland using much larger transoceanic aircraft. Today they include wide-body aircraft, like the Airbus A330, Boeing 767, and Boeing 777, and narrow-body craft like the Boeing 737-800. The smaller aircraft used on inter-island flights fit at all gates, while the larger overseas airliners cannot. Because of the size of the wide-body aircraft, Gates 3, 25, 31, and 37 are rarely used. The air traffic control tower stands above mean sea level and was completed in 1988.

The airport is going through expansion authorized by the Hawaii State Legislature. A goal has been set to prepare Kahului Airport to eventually become a permanent international airport with service routes from Canada and Japan. Current flights from Canada use United States border preclearance facilities in Vancouver, Calgary or Edmonton. Under the December 2016 &quot;Kahului Airport Master Plan Update&quot;, two more aircraft parking positions would be added to the thirteen existing for the main passenger terminal. The current thirteen positions are sized for three inter-island and ten overseas aircraft.

There is one lounge operated by Hawaiian Airlines, the Premier Club, located across from Gate 17.

=== Airfield ===

Kahului Airport covers at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has two asphalt runways: 2/20 is and 5/23 is . It also has an asphalt helipad designated H1 measuring . Helicopters operate from the area directly east of the approach end of Runway 2. No fixed-wing aircraft are permitted in this area between sunrise and sunset, and fixed-wing operations in this area from sunset to sunrise require prior authorization.

Most commercial flights use Runway 2, which is equipped with a Category I Instrument Landing System. Runway 5 is primarily used for lighter commuter aircraft and general aviation. For noise abatement, flights taking off from Runway 2 are directed to climb straight ahead after takeoff until clear of the shoreline by before making any turns. Flights taking off from Runway 5 for destinations east or west are directed to turn left as soon as possible to clear the shoreline by ; flights from Runway 5 for destinations south are directed to turn right as soon as possible. Flights landing on Runway 2 detour west of Kahului and Wailuku on a heading almost directly south before lining up for landing. Flights landing on Runway 5 follow the coastline and avoid overflying populated areas as much as possible.

Under the OGG Master Plan, Runway 2 would be lengthened (to the south) to by 2021, allowing operations with long-distance aircraft carrying a full load of fuel at maximum take-off weight. This would enable nonstop service from Kahului to Chicago, Dallas, and Denver with Boeing 777-200 aircraft. In addition, a parallel runway to 2/20 would be constructed in the future, with a centerline separation of . The parallel runway would enable simultaneous operations and would serve as a backup to Runway 2. Runway 2 has been experiencing pavement distress since 2008, and reconstruction to a concrete surface (from the present grooved asphalt) is recommended.

== Expansion ==
As a result of the passage of Hawaii State Legislature bills in 1998 and 2001, Kahului is planned to undergo expansion for new, larger facilities, lengthening of runways, increasing of fuel storage capacities, and construction of new access roads. The controversial project has met opposition from residents who do not agree with the elevation of Kahului Airport to a permanent international airport. Project opponents cite concerns about increased introduction of invasive species and other issues, as evidenced by the common Maui bumper sticker &quot;Big city airport, big city problems.&quot;

In early 2005, Governor Linda Lingle released $365 million for construction of an extended ticketing lobby, new baggage claim carousels, a new Alien Species building, a new cargo building, construction of a new apron, construction of an additional 10 jetways to replace the current jetways, and a new six-lane airport access road that would run from the airport, intersecting Haleakala Highway and Hana Highway, and run parallel to Dairy Road where it would merge with Puunene Avenue (highway 350), Dairy Road, and Kuihelani Highway (highway 380). Construction on the new Airport Access Road began in November 2013, and was completed in July 2016 at a cost of $56 million funded, from rental car facility charges.

A new consolidated rental car facility was opened at Kahului Airport on May 15, 2019. The LEED-certified facility features customer service counters, approximately 3,700 parking spaces for rental cars, and a people mover running between two stations at the terminal and the rental car facility, eliminating the need for shuttle buses. As part of its justification for building the facility, the state said that Kahului rents the most vehicles of all the 15 airports in the state, an average of 2,200 per day, more than twice the amount at Honolulu.

Maui Bus operates two routes that stop at Kahului Airport. Route 35 Haiku Islander and Route 40 Upcountry Islander stop at the airport, both starting in Kahului. Route 35 connects the airport with Paia and Haiku, while Route 40 connects Pukalani, Makawao, and Haliimaile to the airport.

== Accidents and incidents ==
=== Aloha Airlines Flight 243 ===

On April 28, 1988, Aloha Airlines Flight 243, a Boeing 737-200 inter-island flight from Hilo Airport to Honolulu International Airport carrying 89 passengers and six crew members, experienced explosive decompression when an 18-foot section of the fuselage roof and sides were torn from the aircraft. A flight attendant was sucked out of the aircraft and died. Several passengers sustained life-threatening injuries including massive head wounds. The aircraft declared an emergency and landed at Kahului Airport. Noise created by the rush of air rendered vocal communication impossible, and the pilots had to use hand signals during landing.

Investigations of the disaster, headquartered at Honolulu International Airport, concluded that the accident was caused by metal fatigue. The disaster caused most major United States air carriers to evaluate their older aircraft models.

=== Aloha IslandAir Flight 1712 ===
On October 28, 1989, Aloha IslandAir Flight 1712, a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft, collided with mountainous terrain near Halawa Valley, Molokai, while en route on a scheduled passenger flight from Kahului Airport to Molokai Airport in Hoolehua. 
All 20 aboard the aircraft died. Thirteen of the victims were from Molokai, including eight members of the Molokai High School boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; volleyball teams and two faculty members. The girls&#x27; team had just qualified on Maui for the state tournament.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined the cause of the accident was the airplane&#x27;s controlled flight into terrain as a result of the decision of the captain to continue to operate the flight under visual flight rules at night into instrument meteorological conditions, which obscured rising mountainous terrain.

=== Hawaii Air Ambulance ===
On March 8, 2006, a Hawaii Air Ambulance Cessna 414 was making an approach to Runway 5 when it crashed into a BMW dealership about a mile from the airport. A pilot and two paramedics were killed in the accident.

=== Hawaiian Airlines Flight 45 ===
On April 20, 2014, a 15-year-old stowed away in a landing gear well of a Hawaiian Airlines jet flying from San Jose International Airport to Kahului Airport. Upon his arrival, he was spotted by authorities, who questioned him about the incident. The teen claimed that he was trying to get to Ethiopia
to see his mother.

=== American Airlines Flight 271 ===
On January 29, 2024, American Airlines Flight 271 made a hard landing at the Kahului Airport. 6 people were injured.

<text>Cao Xueqin ( ; 4 April 171010 June 1765) was a Chinese novelist and poet during the Qing dynasty. He is best known as the author of &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;, one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. His given name was Cao Zhan () and his courtesy name was Mengruan.

== Family ==
Cao Xueqin was born to a Han Chinese clan that was brought into personal service (as &quot;booi aha&quot; or bondservants of Cigu Niru) to the Manchu royalty in the late 1610s. His ancestors distinguished themselves through military service in the Plain White Banner of the Eight Banners and subsequently held posts as officials which brought both prestige and wealth.

After the Plain White Banner was put under the direct jurisdiction of the Qing emperor, Cao&#x27;s family began to serve in civil positions of the Imperial Household Department.

During the Kangxi Emperor&#x27;s reign, the clan&#x27;s prestige and power reached its height. Cao grandfather, Cao Yin (), was a childhood playmate to Kangxi while Cao Yin&#x27;s mother, Lady Sun (), was Kangxi&#x27;s wet nurse. Two years after his ascension, Kangxi appointed Cao Xueqin&#x27;s great-grandfather, Cao Xi (), as the Commissioner of Imperial Textiles () in Jiangning (present-day Nanjing), and the family relocated there.

When Cao Xi died in 1684, Cao Yin, as Kangxi&#x27;s personal confidant, took over the post. Cao Yin was one of the era&#x27;s most prominent men of letters and a keen book collector. Jonathan Spence notes the strong Manchu element in the lives of these Imperial Household bond servants. They balanced the two cultures: Cao Yin took pleasure in horse riding and hunting and Manchu military culture, but was at the same time a sensitive interpreter of Chinese culture to the Manchus. By the early 18th century, the Cao clan had become so rich and influential as to be able to play host four times to the Kangxi Emperor in his six separate itinerant trips south to the Nanjing region. In 1705, the emperor ordered Cao Yin, himself a poet, to compile all surviving &quot;shi&quot; (lyric poems) from the Tang dynasty, which resulted in &quot;The Complete Poems of the Tang&quot;.

When Cao Yin died in 1712, Kangxi passed the office over to Cao Yin&#x27;s only son, Cao Yong (). Cao Yong died in 1715. Kangxi then allowed the family to adopt a paternal nephew, Cao Fu (), as Cao Yin&#x27;s posthumous son to continue in that position. Hence the clan held the office of Imperial Textile Commissioner at Jiangning for three generations.

The family&#x27;s fortunes lasted until Kangxi&#x27;s death and the ascension of the Yongzheng Emperor to the throne. Yongzheng severely attacked the family and in 1727 confiscated their properties, while Cao Fu was thrown in jail. This was ostensibly for their mismanagement of funds, though perhaps this purge was politically motivated. When Cao Fu was released a year later, the impoverished family was forced to relocate to Beijing. Cao Xueqin, still a young child, lived in poverty with his family.

== Life ==

Almost no records of Cao&#x27;s early childhood and adulthood have survived. Redology scholars are still debating Cao&#x27;s exact date of birth, though he is known to have been around forty to fifty at his death. Cao Xueqin was the son of either Cao Fu or Cao Yong. It is known for certain that Cao Yong&#x27;s only son was born posthumously in 1715; some Redologists believe this son might be Cao Xueqin. In the clan register (), however, Cao Yong&#x27;s only son was recorded as a certain Cao Tianyou (). Further complicating matters for Redologists is the fact that neither the names Cao Zhan nor Cao Xueqin—names that his contemporaries knew him by—can be traced in the register.

Most of what we know about Cao was passed down from his contemporaries and friends. Cao eventually settled in the countryside west of Beijing, where he lived the larger part of his later years in poverty selling off his paintings. Cao was recorded as an inveterate drinker. Friends and acquaintances recalled an intelligent, highly talented man who spent a decade working diligently on a work that must have been &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;. &quot;Born in the prosperous, finally degenerate.&quot; Cao Xueqin&#x27;s family fate has changed from the status like blooming of flowers to the state of decline, making him deeply experience the sorrow of life and the ruthlessness of the world, and also get rid of the mundanity and narrowness of his original social class. The trend of decadence also brought disillusionment and sentimentality. His tragic experience, his poetic emotion, his spirit of exploration, and his sense of innovation are all cast into &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;. They praised both his stylish paintings, particularly of cliffs and rocks, and originality in poetry, which they likened to Li He&#x27;s. Cao died some time in 1763 or 1764, leaving his novel in a very advanced stage of completion. (At least the first draft had been completed, some pages of the manuscript were lost after being borrowed by friends or relatives.) He was survived by a wife after the death of a son.

Cao achieved posthumous fame through his life&#x27;s work. &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; is a vivid recreation of an illustrious family at its height and its subsequent downfall, and the novel was &quot;semi-autobiographical&quot; in nature. A small group of close family and friends appeared to have been transcribing his manuscript when Cao died quite suddenly in 1763–4, apparently out of grief owing to the death of a son. Extant handwritten copies of this work—some 80 chapters—had been in circulation in Beijing shortly after Cao&#x27;s death and scribal copies soon became prized collectors&#x27; items.

In 1791, Cheng Weiyuan () and Gao E, who claimed to have access to Cao&#x27;s working papers, edited and published a &quot;complete&quot; 120-chapter version. This was its first woodblock print edition. Reprinted a year later with more revisions, this 120-chapter edition is the novel&#x27;s most printed version. Many modern scholars question the authorship of the last 40 chapters of the novel, whether it was actually completed by Cao Xueqin.

To this very day, Cao continues to be influential on new generations of Chinese novelists and poets, such as Middle Generation&#x27;s An Qi, who paid homage to him in her poem &quot;To Cao Xueqin&quot;.

<text>Carl Sassenrath (born 1957 in California) is an architect of operating systems and computer languages. He brought multitasking to personal computers in 1985 with the creation of the Amiga Computer operating system kernel, and he is the designer of the REBOL computer language, REBOL/IOS collaboration environment, the Safeworlds AltME private messaging system, and other products. Carl was a Principal Engineer at Roku, Inc. until his retirement in November 2023.

==Background==
Carl Sassenrath was born in 1957 to Charles and Carolyn Sassenrath in California. His father was a chemical engineer involved in research and development related to petroleum refining, paper production, and air pollution control systems.

In the late 1960s his family relocated from the San Francisco Bay Area to the small town of Eureka, California. From his early childhood Sassenrath was actively involved in electronics, amateur radio, photography, and filmmaking. When he was 13, Sassenrath began working for KEET, a PBS public broadcasting television station. A year later he became a cameraman for KVIQ (ABC affiliate then) and worked his way up to being technical director and director for news, commercials, and local programming.

In 1980 Sassenrath graduated from the University of California, Davis with a B.S. in EECS (electrical engineering and computer science). During his studies he became interested in operating systems, parallel processing, programming languages, and neurophysiology. He was a teaching assistant for graduate computer language courses and a research assistant in neuroscience and behavioral biology. His uncle, Dr. Julius Sassenrath, headed the educational psychology department at UC Davis, and his aunt, Dr. Ethel Sassenrath, was one of the original researchers of THC at the California National Primate Research Center.

==Career==

===Hewlett-Packard===

During his final year at the university, Sassenrath joined Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s Computer Systems Division as a member of the Multi-Programming Executive (MPE) file system design group for HP 3000 computers. His task was to implement a compiler for a new type of control language called &quot;Outqueue&quot;—a challenge because the language was both descriptive and procedural. A year later, Sassenrath became a member of the MPE-IV OS kernel team and later part of the HPE kernel group.

While at HP Sassenrath became interested in minimizing the high complexity found in most operating systems of that time and set out to formulate his own concepts of a microkernel-based OS. He proposed them to HP, but found the large company complacent to the &quot;smaller OS&quot; ideas.

In late 1981 and early 1982, Sassenrath took an academic leave to do atmospheric physics research for National Science Foundation at Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station. Upon returning, Sassenrath reached an agreement with HP to pursue independent research into new areas of computing, including graphical user interfaces and remote procedure call methods of distributed computing.

Later in 1982, impressed by the new computing ideas being published from Xerox PARC, Sassenrath formed an HP project to develop the modern style of window-based mouse-driven GUIs. The project, called &quot;Probus&quot; (for professional business workstation) was created on a prototype Sun Microsystems workstation borrowed from Andy Bechtolsheim while he was at Stanford University. Probus clearly demonstrated the power of graphical user interfaces, and the system also incorporated hyperlinks and early distributed computing concepts.

At HP, Sassenrath was involved with and influenced by a range of HP language projects including Ada, Pascal, Smalltalk, Lisp, Forth, SPL, and a variety of experimental languages.

===Amiga===
In 1983, Carl Sassenrath joined Amiga Computer, Inc., a small startup company in Silicon Valley. As &quot;Manager of Operating Systems&quot; he was asked to design a new operating system for the Amiga, an advanced multimedia personal computer system that later became the Amiga.

As a sophisticated computer for its day (Amiga used 28 DMA channels along with multiple coprocessors), Sassenrath decided to create a preemptive multitasking operating system within a microkernel design. This was a novel approach for 1983 when other personal computer operating systems were single tasking such as MS-DOS (1981) and the Macintosh (1984).

The Amiga multitasking kernel was also one of the first to implement a microkernel OS methodology based on a real-time message passing (inter-process communication) core known as Exec (for executive) with dynamically loaded libraries and devices as optional modules around the core.

This design gave the Amiga OS a great extensibility and flexibility within the limited memory capacity of computers in the 1980s. Sassenrath later noted that the design came as a necessity of trying to integrate into ROM dozens of internal libraries and devices including graphics, sound, graphical user interface, floppy disk, file systems, and others. This dynamic modular method also allowed hundreds of additional modules to be added by external developers over the years.

After the release of the Amiga in 1985, Sassenrath left Commodore-Amiga to pursue new programming language design ideas that he had been contemplating since his university days.

===Apple Computer===
In 1986, Sassenrath was recruited to Apple Computer&#x27;s Advanced Technology Group (ATG) to invent the next generation of operating systems. He was part of the Aquarius project, a quad-core CPU project (simulated on Apple&#x27;s own Cray XMP-48) that was intended to become a 3D-based successor to the Macintosh.

During that period, the C++ language had just been introduced, but Sassenrath, along with many other Apple researchers, preferred the more pure OO implementation of the Smalltalk language. Working at ATG with computing legends like Alan Kay, Larry Tesler, Dan Ingalls, Bill Atkinson and others provided Sassenrath with a wealth of resources and knowledge that helped shape his views of computing languages and systems.

===Sassenrath Research===

In 1988, Sassenrath left Silicon Valley for the mountains of Ukiah valley, 2 hours north of San Francisco. From there he founded multimedia technology companies such as Pantaray, American Multimedia, and VideoStream. He also implemented the Logo programming language for the Amiga, managed the software OS development for CDTV, one of the first CD-ROM TV set-top boxes, and wrote the OS for Viscorp Ed, one of the first Internet TV set-top boxes.

===REBOL Technologies===

In 1996, after watching the growth and development of programming languages like Java, Perl, and Python, Sassenrath decided to publish his own ideas within the world of computer languages. The result was REBOL, the &quot;relative expression-based object language&quot;. REBOL is intended to be lightweight, and specifically to support efficient distributed computing.

Sassenrath describes REBOL as a balance between the concepts of and symbolism, allowing users to create new relationships between symbols and their meanings. By doing so, he attempts to merge the concepts of code, data, and metadata. Sassenrath considers REBOL experimental because it provides greater control over context than most other programming languages. Words can be used to form different grammars in different contexts (called &quot;dialecting&quot;). Sassenrath claims REBOL is the ultimate endpoint for the evolution of markup language methodologies, such as XML.

In 1998, Sassenrath founded REBOL Technologies, a company he still runs. The company has released several versions of REBOL and produced additional products such as REBOL/View, REBOL/Command, REBOL/SDK, and REBOL/IOS.

Sassenrath implemented REBOL V3.0 and released it to GitHub on December 12, 2012: https://github.com/rebol/r3.

===Roku===

Since 2010, Sassenrath had worked at Roku, Inc. in product development. He retired in November 2023.

==Personal==

Sassenrath lives in Ukiah, California, where he grows grapes and makes wine, and is interested in amateur radio, video production, quantum electrodynamics, and boating. He volunteers with the Television Improvement Association, a community organization that brings free, over-the-air television broadcasts into the Ukiah area.

<doc id="295100" wikidata="Q1397509" url="?curid=295100" title="The Great Artiste">
<text>The Great Artiste was a U.S. Army Air Forces Silverplate B-29 bomber (B-29-40-MO , Victor number 89), assigned to the 393d Bomb Squadron, 509th Composite Group. The aircraft was named for its bombardier, Captain Kermit Beahan, in reference to his bombing talents. It flew 12 training and practice missions in which it bombed Japanese-held Pacific islands and dropped pumpkin bombs on targets in Japan. It was the only aircraft to have participated in both the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, albeit as an observation aircraft on each mission.

After the war ended it returned with the 509th Composite Group to Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico. It was scrapped in September 1949 after being heavily damaged in an accident at Goose Bay Air Base, Labrador, the year before.

==Aircraft history==
Built at the Glenn L. Martin Aircraft Plant at Omaha, Nebraska, &quot;The Great Artiste &quot; (B-29-40-MO ) was a Silverplate B-29 Superfortress bomber. It was accepted by the Army Air Forces on 20 April 1945, and flown to Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, by its assigned crew C-15, commanded by First Lieutenant Charles D. Albury, in May. It departed Wendover for North Field, Tinian on 22 June.

It was originally assigned Victor (unit-assigned identification) number 9, but on 1 August it was given the circle R tail markings of the 6th Bombardment Group as a security measure, and it had its Victor number changed to 89 to avoid misidentification with actual 6th Bombardment Group aircraft. Its nose art was painted after the Nagasaki mission. The name purportedly referred to the talents of the bombardier, Captain Kermit Beahan, with both the Norden bombsight and with women.

In addition to its use on the nuclear bomb missions, &quot;The Great Artiste&quot; was flown by five different crews on 12 training and practice missions. It flew bombing missions against Rota on 4 July, Truk on 8 July, and Marcus on 9 July. It returned to bomb Rota again on 12 and 14 July, and bombed Guguan on 18 and 19 July. It was flown by Albury and crew C-15 on two combat missions, one of which was aborted, and the other in which it used a pumpkin bomb to attack the railroad yards at Kobe on 24 July. Captain Bob Lewis and crew B-9 flew it to drop a pumpkin bomb on an industrial target in Koriyama on 29 July.

Flown by 393d commander, Major Charles W. Sweeney, it was assigned to the Hiroshima mission on 6 August 1945, as the blast measurement instrumentation aircraft. On the mission to bomb Nagasaki on 9 August 1945, it was to have been the aircraft carrying the bomb, but the mission schedule had been moved forward two days because of weather considerations, and the instrumentation had not yet been removed from the aircraft. To avoid delaying the mission, Sweeney traded airplanes with the crew of &quot;Bockscar&quot; to carry the Fat Man atomic bomb to Nagasaki. Captain Frederick C. Bock and his C-13 crew flew &quot;The Great Artiste&quot; to Nagasaki on its instrument support mission, and landed with it on Okinawa at the conclusion of the mission. It was the only aircraft to directly participate in both missions. &quot;Enola Gay&quot;, flown by Captain George Marquardt&#x27;s Crew B-10, was the weather reconnaissance aircraft for Kokura, the primary target on the Nagasaki flight. &quot;Enola Gay&quot; reported clear skies over Kokura.

In November 1945 it returned with the 509th Composite Group to Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico, where it remained for the rest of its flying career, except for a brief period when it was assigned to Task Force 1.5 for Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in July 1946. It returned to the 509th, now designated the 509th Bombardment Group, in September. On 3 September 1948, during a polar navigation training mission, it developed an engine problem after takeoff from Goose Bay Air Base, Labrador, and ran off the end of the runway when attempting to land. Heavily damaged, it never flew again, and was eventually scrapped at Goose Bay in September 1949, despite its historical significance.

==Displays==
A representation of &quot;The Great Artiste&quot; is on static display at the &quot;Spirit Gate&quot; of Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, now home base of the 509th Operations Group. The aircraft, originally B-29 , which served as an SB-29 &quot;Super Dumbo&quot; rescue aircraft during the Korean War, was refurbished to depict &quot;The Great Artiste&quot; and moved to Whiteman after the closure of Pease Air Force Base in 1991.

<text>John Richard Chambers (March 25, 1931 – April 13, 1978) was an artist and filmmaker. Born in London, Ontario, Chambers&#x27; painting style shifted from surrealist-influenced to photo-realist-influenced. He used the term &quot;Perceptual Realism&quot; and later &quot;perceptualism&quot; to describe his style. He began working with film in the 1960s, completing six by 1970. Stan Brakhage proclaimed Chambers&#x27; &quot;The Hart of London&quot; as &quot;one of the greatest films ever made.&quot;

==Biography==
Born John Richard Chambers in London, Ontario, Chambers signed his name as John until 1970 and thereafter was known as Jack professionally and posthumously. Chambers studied at Sir Adam Beck Collegiate Institute in London, where in 1944 he was taught by the painter Selwyn Dewdney. He later attended H.B. Beal Secondary School and the University of Western Ontario, before spending eight years (1953–1961) studying and working in Europe. While in Europe he met Pablo Picasso, turning up at the artist&#x27;s house and scaling his gate in order to introduce himself. Picasso suggested he continue his studies in Barcelona. He called his own work &quot;perceptual realism,&quot; a kind of surrealism based on his own dreams and memories and the existentialist philosophy of Maurice Merleau-Ponty. When he returned to London, Chambers worked with fellow London native Greg Curnoe. In 1969 he was diagnosed with leukemia. For the rest of his life he painted more realistically, often depicting sites in London and the surrounding area. An example of this is &quot;401 Towards London No. 1&quot; (1968–1969), a view of Highway 401 heading westward towards London.

In 1968, he founded Canadian Artists&#x27; Representation (CARFAC), now a national organization of artists, after an argument with the National Gallery of Canada over reproduction rights and fees. In 1973 he received the Victor Martyn Lynch-Staunton Award.

His work is in the collections of the National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and Museum London. An elementary school Jack Chambers Public School (and the streets surrounding it) are named for him in London, and a tree was planted in his memory in Gibbons Park after his death.

The 2012 retrospective of his work at the Art Gallery of Ontario has helped introduce his oeuvre to a new audience.

==Perceptual Realism==
Chambers evolved his theory of Perceptual Realism in the late 1960s in an essay of the same name. He argued for different types of realism and believed that his approach was unique. Art historian Mark Cheetham calls it &quot;a fully articulated position that detailed art’s profound and spiritual relationship with primary sensory experience&quot; and applies to his most notable films and paintings. Perceptual Realism showed the essence of matter through light and material. Chambers called it &quot;a faculty of inner vision where the object appears in the splendour of its essential namelessness.

==Paintings==
The foundations of Chambers’ painting technique were laid during his training in Spain. Many of his paintings from that period show the influence of Surrealism. After his return to Canada in 1961 he experimented with paint application and vibrant colour. By the mid-1960s his style changed again as he worked a sense of temporal movement into his paintings. Forms were fragmented in these paintings: &quot;A painting gets put together just like an experience – in particles.&quot; In the mid-1960s Chambers also produced his silver paintings using aluminum pigment. Other artists, including Andy Warhol, also experimented with this unusual metallic colour.

==Films==

Between 1964 and 1970, Chambers completed six films varying in length between nine minutes and 79 minutes. Working in both black and white and colour film, his works were montages dealing on the surface with his domestic life and images of London, Ontario. They were also examinations of the contrast between nature and society. Although for the most part peripheral to the history of avant-garde film, owing to his early death and reluctance to travel with his films for festivals, Chambers&#x27; filmography and in particular his feature-length film &quot;The Hart of London&quot; have become important within Canadian film history but have also grown in stature internationally.

<doc id="295105" wikidata="Q199820" url="?curid=295105" title="Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)">
<text>The Paris Peace Conference was a set of formal and informal diplomatic meetings in 1919 and 1920 after the end of World War I, in which the victorious Allies set the peace terms for the defeated Central Powers. Dominated by the leaders of Britain, France, the United States and Italy, the conference resulted in five treaties that rearranged the maps of Europe and parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific Islands, and also imposed financial penalties. Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey and the other losing nations were not given a voice in the deliberations; this later gave rise to political resentments that lasted for decades. The arrangements made by this conference are considered one of the great watersheds of 20th-century geopolitical history.

The conference involved diplomats from 32 countries and nationalities. Its major decisions were the creation of the League of Nations and the five peace treaties with the defeated states. Main arrangements agreed upon in the treaties were, among others, the transition of German and Ottoman overseas possessions as &quot;mandates&quot; from the hands of these countries chiefly into the hands of Britain and France; the imposition of reparations upon Germany; and the drawing of new national boundaries, sometimes involving plebiscites, to reflect ethnic boundaries more closely.

US President Woodrow Wilson in 1917 commissioned a group of about 150 academics to research topics likely to arise in diplomatic talks on the European stage, and to develop a set of principles to be used for the peace negotiations in order to end World War I. The results of this research were summarized in the so-called Fourteen Points document that became the basis for the terms of the German surrender during the conference, as it had earlier been the basis of the German government&#x27;s negotiations in the Armistice of 11 November 1918.

The main result of the conference was the Treaty of Versailles with Germany; Article 231 of that treaty placed the whole guilt for the war on &quot;the aggression of Germany and her allies&quot;. That provision proved very humiliating for German leaders, armies and citizens alike, and set the stage for the expensive reparations that Germany was intended to pay, only a small portion of which had been delivered when it stopped paying after 1931. The five great powers at that time, France, Britain, Italy, Japan and the United States, controlled the Conference. The &quot;Big Four&quot; leaders were French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, US President Woodrow Wilson, and Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando. Together with teams of diplomats and jurists, they met informally 145 times and agreed upon all major decisions before they were ratified.

The conference began on 18 January 1919. With respect to its end, Professor Michael Neiberg noted, &quot;Although the senior statesmen stopped working personally on the conference in June 1919, the formal peace process did not really end until July 1923, when the Treaty of Lausanne was signed.&quot; The entire process is often referred to as the &quot;Versailles Conference&quot;, although only the signing of the first treaty took place in the historic palace; the negotiations occurred at the Quai d&#x27;Orsay in Paris.

==Overview and direct results==

The Conference formally opened on 18 January 1919 at the Quai d&#x27;Orsay in Paris. This date was symbolic, as it was the anniversary of the proclamation of William I as German Emperor in 1871, in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles, shortly before the end of the Siege of Paris – a day itself imbued with significance in Germany, as the anniversary of the establishment of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701.
The Delegates from 27 nations (delegates representing 5 nationalities were for the most part ignored) were assigned to 52 commissions, which held 1,646 sessions to prepare reports, with the help of many experts, on topics ranging from prisoners of war to undersea cables, to international aviation, to responsibility for the war. Key recommendations were folded into the Treaty of Versailles with Germany, which had 15 chapters and 440 clauses, as well as treaties for the other defeated nations.

The five major powers, France, Britain, Italy, the U.S., and Japan, controlled the Conference. Amongst the &quot;Big Five&quot;, in practice Japan only sent a former prime minister and played a small role; and the &quot;Big Four&quot; leaders dominated the conference.
The four met together informally 145 times and made all the major decisions, which were then ratified by other attendees. The open meetings of all the delegations approved the decisions made by the Big Four. The conference came to an end on 21 January 1920, with the inaugural General Assembly of the League of Nations.

Five major peace treaties were prepared at the Paris Peace Conference, with, in parentheses, the affected countries:
* the Treaty of Versailles, 28 June 1919 (Germany)
* the Treaty of Saint-Germain, 10 September 1919 (Austria)
* the Treaty of Neuilly, 27 November 1919 (Bulgaria)
* the Treaty of Trianon, 4 June 1920 (Hungary)
* the Treaty of Sèvres, 10 August 1920; subsequently revised by the Treaty of Lausanne, 24 July 1923 (Ottoman Empire/Republic of Turkey).

The major decisions were the establishment of the League of Nations; the five peace treaties with defeated enemies; the awarding of German and Ottoman overseas possessions as &quot;mandates&quot;, chiefly to members of the British Empire and to France; reparations imposed on Germany; and the drawing of new national boundaries, sometimes with plebiscites, to better reflect the forces of nationalism. The main result was the Treaty of Versailles, with Germany, which in section 231 laid the guilt for the war on &quot;the aggression of Germany and her allies&quot;. This provision proved humiliating for Germany and set the stage for very high reparations Germany was supposed to pay. Germany paid only a small portion, before reparations ended in 1931. According to British historian AJP Taylor, the treaty seemed to Germans &quot;wicked, unfair&quot; and &quot;dictation, a slave treaty&quot; but one which they would repudiate at some stage if it &quot;did not fall to pieces of its own absurdity.&quot;

As the conference&#x27;s decisions were enacted unilaterally and largely on the whims of the Big Four, Paris was effectively the center of a world government during the conference, which deliberated over and implemented the sweeping changes to the political geography of Europe. Most famously, the Treaty of Versailles itself weakened the German military and placed full blame for the war and costly reparations on Germany&#x27;s shoulders, and the later humiliation and resentment in Germany is often sometimes considered by historians to be one of the direct causes of Nazi Party&#x27;s electoral successes and one of the indirect causes of World War II.

The League of Nations proved controversial in the United States since critics said it subverted the powers of the US Congress to declare war. The US Senate did not ratify any of the peace treaties and so the United States never joined the League. Instead, the 1921–1923 Harding administration concluded new treaties with Germany, Austria, and Hungary. The German Weimar Republic was not invited to attend the conference at Versailles. Representatives of White Russia but not Communist Russia were at the conference. Numerous other nations sent delegations to appeal for various unsuccessful additions to the treaties, and parties lobbied for causes ranging from independence for the countries of the South Caucasus to Japan&#x27;s unsuccessful proposal for racial equality to the other great powers.

==Mandates==
A central issue of the conference was the disposition of the overseas colonies of Germany (Austria-Hungary did not have major colonies, and the Ottoman Empire was a separate issue).

The British dominions wanted their reward for their sacrifice. Australia wanted New Guinea, New Zealand wanted Samoa, and South Africa wanted South West Africa. Wilson wanted the League to administer all German colonies until they were ready for independence. Lloyd George realized he needed to support his dominions and so he proposed a compromise: there be three types of mandates. Mandates for the Turkish provinces were one category and would be divided up between Britain and France.

The second category, of New Guinea, Samoa, and South West Africa, were located so close to responsible supervisors that the mandates could hardly be given to anyone except Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Finally, the African colonies would need the careful supervision as &quot;Class B&quot; mandates, which could be provided only by experienced colonial powers: Britain, France, and Belgium although Italy and Portugal received small amounts of territory. Wilson and the others finally went along with the solution. The dominions received &quot;Class C Mandates&quot; to the colonies that they wanted. Japan obtained mandates over German possessions north of the Equator.

Wilson wanted no mandates for the United States, but his main advisor, Colonel House, was deeply involved in awarding the others. Wilson was especially offended by Australian demands and had some memorable clashes with Hughes (the Australian Prime Minister), this the most famous:

==British approach==

The maintenance of the unity, territories, and interests of the British Empire was an overarching concern for the British delegates to the conference. Still, they entered the conference with more specific goals with this order of priority:
* Ensure colonial claims of Germany were redacted (taken or given to victory colonies)
* Germany was ensued with 30 billion dollars of debt, concerning interest
* Ensuring the security of France
* Removing the threat of the German High Seas Fleet
* Settling territorial contentions
* Supporting the League of Nations

The Racial Equality Proposal put forth by the Japanese did not directly conflict with any core British interest, but as the conference progressed, its full implications on immigration to the British dominions, with Australia taking particular exception, became a major point of contention within the delegation.

Ultimately, the British delegation did not treat that proposal as a fundamental aim of the conference; they were willing to sacrifice the Racial Equality Proposal to placate the Australian delegation and thus help to satisfy their overarching aim of preserving the unity of the British Empire.

Britain had reluctantly consented to the attendance of separate delegations from British dominions, but the British managed to rebuff attempts by the envoys of the newly proclaimed Irish Republic to put a case to the conference for Irish self-determination, diplomatic recognition, and membership in the proposed League of Nations. The Irish envoys&#x27; final &quot;Demand for Recognition&quot; in a letter to Clemenceau, the conference chairman, was not answered. Britain had been planning to renege on the Government of Ireland Act 1914 and instead to replace it with a new Government of Ireland Bill which would partition Ireland into two Irish Home Rule states (which eventually was passed as the Government of Ireland Act 1920). The planned two states would both be within the United Kingdom and so neither would have dominion status.

David Lloyd George commented that he did &quot;not do badly&quot; at the peace conference &quot;considering I was seated between Jesus Christ and Napoleon.&quot; This was a reference to the great idealism of Wilson, who desired merely to punish Germany, and the stark realism of Clemenceau, who was determined to see Germany effectively destroyed.

=== Eastern Mediterranean ===
Like the other main Allied powers, the British public was more inclined to punish Germany and Austria. Britain&#x27;s relationship with the Ottoman Empire was not a topic in the 1918 general election. There was an indecision among British decision makers over defanging and demobilizing the Ottoman army, the fate to be assigned to leading Committee of Union and Progress members, and the future of the Turkish straits. Per Taner Akçam, the considerations of British envoys to Versailles were:

# Securing Britain&#x27;s link to India
# Avoiding friction with France
# The long-standing policy of supporting the Ottoman Empire was no longer sensible
# An Eastern Mediterranean ally had to fill the security vacuum the Ottoman Empire left in order to contain a resurgent Russian threat

A strong Greece, Armenia, and fortified Palestine were all reflections of this sentiment.

===Dominion representation===

The dominion governments were not originally given separate invitations to the conference and had been expected to send representatives as part of the British delegation.

Convinced that Canada had become a nation on the battlefields of Europe, Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden demanded that it have a separate seat at the conference. That was initially opposed not only by Britain but also by the United States, which saw any Dominion delegation as an extra British vote. Borden responded by pointing out that since Canada had lost nearly 60,000 men, a far larger proportion of its men than the 50,000 American men lost, it had at least the right to the representation of a &quot;minor&quot; power. Lloyd George eventually relented and persuaded the reluctant Americans to accept the presence of delegations from Canada, India, Australia, Newfoundland, New Zealand, and South Africa, and that those countries receive their seats in the League of Nations.

Canada, despite its huge losses in the war, did not ask for either reparations or mandates.

The Australian delegation, led by Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes fought greatly for its demands: reparations, the annexation of German New Guinea, and the rejection of the Racial Equality Proposal. He said that he had no objection to the proposal if it was stated in unambiguous terms that it did not confer any right to enter Australia. He was concerned by the increasing power of Japan. Within months of the declaration of war in 1914, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand had seized all of Germany&#x27;s possessions in the Far East and the Pacific Ocean. The British had given their blessing for Japan to occupy German possessions, but Hughes was alarmed by that policy.

==French approach==

French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau controlled his delegation, and his chief goal was to weaken Germany militarily, strategically, and economically. Having personally witnessed two German attacks on French soil in the last 40 years, he was adamant for Germany not to be permitted to attack France again. Particularly, Clemenceau sought an American and British joint guarantee of French security in the event of another German attack.

Clemenceau also expressed skepticism and frustration with Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points and complained: &quot;Mr. Wilson bores me with his fourteen points. Why, God Almighty has only ten!&quot; Wilson gained some favour by signing a mutual defense treaty with France, but he did not present it to his country&#x27;s government for ratification and so it never took effect.

Another possible French policy was to seek a rapprochement with Germany. In May 1919 the diplomat René Massigli was sent on several secret missions to Berlin. During his visits, he offered, on behalf of his government, to revise the territorial and economic clauses of the upcoming peace treaty. Massigli spoke of the desirability of &quot;practical, verbal discussions&quot; between French and German officials that would lead to a &quot;Franco-German collaboration.&quot;

Massigli told the Germans that the French thought of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon powers&quot; (the United States and the British Empire) as the major threat to France in the post-war world. He argued that both France and Germany had a joint interest in opposing &quot;Anglo-Saxon domination&quot; of the world, and he warned that the &quot;deepening of opposition&quot; between the French and the Germans &quot;would lead to the ruin of both countries, to the advantage of the Anglo-Saxon powers.&quot;

The Germans rejected Massigli&#x27;s offers because they believed that the intention was to trick them into accepting the Treaty of Versailles unchanged; also, the German Foreign Minister, Count Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau, thought that the United States was more likely to reduce the severity of the penalties than France was. (Lloyd George was the one who eventually pushed for better terms for Germany.)

==Italian approach==
In 1914, Italy remained neutral despite the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary. In 1915, it joined the Allies to gain the territories promised by the Triple Entente in the secret Treaty of London: Trentino, the Tyrol as far as Brenner, Trieste, Istria, most of the Dalmatian Coast (except Fiume), Valona, a protectorate over Albania, Antalya (in Turkey), and possibly colonies in Africa.

Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando tried to obtain full implementation of the Treaty of London, as agreed by France and Britain before the war. He had popular support because of the loss of 700,000 soldiers and a budget deficit of 12,000,000,000 Italian lire during the war made both the government and people feel entitled to all of those territories and even others not mentioned in the Treaty of London, particularly Fiume, which many Italians believed should be annexed to Italy because of the city&#x27;s Italian population.

Orlando, unable to speak English, conducted negotiations jointly with his Foreign Minister Sidney Sonnino, a Protestant of British origins who spoke the language. Together, they worked primarily to secure the partition of the Habsburg monarchy. At the conference, Italy gained Istria, Trieste, Trentino, and South Tyrol. Most of Dalmatia was given to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Fiume remained disputed territory, causing a nationalist outrage.

Orlando obtained other results, such as the permanent membership of Italy in the League of Nations and the promise by the Allies to transfer British Jubaland and the French Aozou strip to Italian colonies. Protectorates over Albania and Antalya were also recognized, but nationalists considered the war to be a mutilated victory, and Orlando was ultimately forced to abandon the conference and to resign. Francesco Saverio Nitti took his place and signed the treaties.

There was a general disappointment in Italy, which the nationalists and fascists used to build the idea that Italy was betrayed by the Allies and refused what had been promised. That was a cause for the general rise of Italian fascism. Orlando refused to see the war as a mutilated victory and replied to nationalists calling for a greater expansion, &quot;Italy today is a great state... on par with the great historic and contemporary states. This is, for me, our main and principal expansion.&quot;

==Japanese approach==
Japan sent a large delegation, headed by the former Prime Minister, Marquis Saionji Kinmochi. It was originally one of the &quot;big five&quot; but relinquished that role because of its slight interest in European affairs. Instead, it focused on two demands: the inclusion of its Racial Equality Proposal in the League&#x27;s Covenant and Japanese territorial claims with respect to former German colonies: Shantung (including Kiaochow) and the Pacific islands north of the Equator, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, the Mariana Islands, and the Carolines.

The former Foreign Minister Baron Makino Nobuaki was &quot;de facto&quot; chief. Saionji&#x27;s role was symbolic and limited because of his history of ill-health. The Japanese delegation became unhappy after it had received only half of the rights of Germany, and it then walked out of the conference.

===Racial equality proposal===

During the negotiations, the leader of the Japanese delegation, Saionji Kinmochi, proposed the inclusion of a &quot;racial equality clause&quot; in the Covenant of the League of Nations on 13 February as an amendment to Article 21:
The equality of nations being a basic principle of the League of Nations, the High Contracting Parties agree to accord as soon as possible to all alien nationals of states, members of the League, equal and just treatment in every respect making no distinction, either in law or in fact, on account of their race or nationality.

The clause quickly proved problematic to both the American and British delegations. Though the proposal itself was compatible with Britain&#x27;s stance of nominal equality for all British subjects as a principle for maintaining imperial unity, there were significant deviations in the stated interests of its dominions, notably Australia and South Africa. Though both dominions could not vote on the decision individually, they were strongly opposed to the clause and pressured Britain to do likewise. Ultimately, the British delegation succumbed to imperial pressure and abstained from voting for the clause.

Meanwhile, though Wilson was indifferent to the clause, there was fierce resistance to it from the American public, and he ruled as Conference chairman that a unanimous vote was required for the Japanese proposal to pass. Ultimately, on the day of the vote, only 11 of the 17 delegates voted in favor of the proposal. The defeat of the proposal influenced Japan&#x27;s turn from co-operation with the Western world, into more nationalist and militarist policies and approaches.

===Territorial claims===
The Japanese claim to Shantung faced strong challenges from the Chinese patriotic student group. In 1914, at the outset of the war, Japan seized the territory that had been granted to Germany in 1897 and seized the German islands in the Pacific north of the equator. In 1917, Japan made secret agreements with Britain, France, and Italy to guarantee their annexation of these territories. With Britain, there was an agreement to support British annexation of the Pacific Islands south of the Equator.

Despite a generally pro-Chinese view by the American delegation, Article 156 of the Treaty of Versailles transferred German concessions in the Jiaozhou Bay, China, to Japan rather than returning sovereign authority to China. The leader of the Chinese delegation, Lu Zhengxiang, demanded a reservation be inserted, before he would sign the treaty. After the reservation was denied, the treaty was signed by all the delegations except that of China. Chinese outrage over that provision led to demonstrations known as the May Fourth Movement. The Pacific Islands north of the equator became a class C mandate, administered by Japan.

==American approach==

Until Wilson&#x27;s arrival in Europe in December 1918, no sitting American president had ever visited the continent. Wilson&#x27;s 1918 Fourteen Points had helped win many hearts and minds as the war ended, not only in America but all over Europe, including Germany, as well as its allies in and the former subjects of the Ottoman Empire.

Wilson&#x27;s diplomacy and his Fourteen Points had essentially established the conditions for the armistices that had brought an end to World War I. Wilson felt it to be his duty and obligation to the people of the world to be a prominent figure at the peace negotiations. High hopes and expectations were placed on him to deliver what he had promised for the postwar era. In doing so, Wilson ultimately began to lead the foreign policy of the United States towards interventionism, a move that has been strongly resisted in some United States circles ever since.

Once Wilson arrived, however, he found &quot;rivalries, and conflicting claims previously submerged.&quot; He worked mostly at trying to influence both the French, led by Georges Clemenceau, and the British, led by David Lloyd George, in their treatment of Germany and its allies in Europe and the former Ottoman Empire in the Middle East. Wilson&#x27;s attempts to gain acceptance of his Fourteen Points ultimately failed; France and Britain each refused to adopt specific points as well as certain core principles.

Several of the Fourteen Points conflicted with the desires of European powers. The United States did not consider it fair or warranted that Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles declared Germany solely responsible for the war. (The United States did not sign peace treaties with the Central Powers until 1921 under President Warren Harding, when separate documents were signed with Germany, Austria, and Hungary respectively.)

In the Middle East, negotiations were complicated by competing aims and claims, and the new mandate system. The United States expressed a hope to establish a more liberal and diplomatic world as stated in the Fourteen Points, in which democracy, sovereignty, liberty and self-determination would be respected. France and Britain, on the other hand, already controlled empires through which they wielded power over their subjects around the world, and aspired to maintain and expand their colonial power rather than relinquish it. Various people, both in Washington and the Middle East, sought American mandates, as they identified the United States as a neutral and non-colonial power. American mandates were considered for Syria, Armenia, and the Ottoman Empire.

In light of the previously secret Sykes–Picot Agreement and following the adoption of the mandate system on the Arab provinces of the former Ottoman Empire, the conference heard statements from competing Zionists and Arabs. Wilson then recommended an international commission of inquiry to ascertain the wishes of the local inhabitants. The idea, first accepted by Great Britain and France, was later rejected, but became the purely-American King–Crane Commission which toured all Syria and Palestine during the summer of 1919 taking statements and sampling opinion. Its report, presented to Wilson, was kept secret from the public until &quot;The New York Times&quot; broke the story in December 1922. A pro-Zionist joint resolution on Palestine was passed by the United States Congress in September 1922.

Though Ottoman intelligentsia were hopeful of the application of Wilsonian idealism in the post-war middle east (especially from point 12 of the Fourteen Points), on 20 March 1919, President Wilson announced his support to detach Istanbul from the Ottoman Empire.

France and Britain tried to appease Wilson by consenting to the establishment of his League of Nations. However, because isolationist sentiment in the United States was strong, and because some of the articles in the League Charter conflicted with the US Constitution, the United States never ratified the Treaty of Versailles or joined the League that Wilson had helped to create to further peace by diplomacy, rather than war, and the conditions that can breed peace.

==Greek approach==
Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos took part in the conference as Greece&#x27;s chief representative. Wilson was said to have placed Venizelos first for personal ability among all delegates in Paris.

Venizelos proposed Greek expansion in Thrace and Asia Minor, which had been part of the defeated Kingdom of Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire; Northern Epirus, Imvros; and Tenedos for the realization of the &quot;Megali Idea&quot;. He also reached the Venizelos-Tittoni agreement with the Italians on the cession of the Dodecanese (apart from Rhodes) to Greece. For the Pontic Greeks, he proposed a common Pontic-Armenian state.

As a liberal politician, Venizelos was a strong supporter of the Fourteen Points and the League of Nations.

==Chinese approach==
The Chinese delegation was led by Lu Zhengxiang, who was accompanied by Wellington Koo and Cao Rulin. Koo demanded Germany&#x27;s concessions on Shandong be returned to China. He also called for an end to imperialist institutions such as extraterritoriality, legation guards, and foreign leaseholds. Despite American support and the ostensible spirit of self-determination, the Western powers refused his claims but instead transferred the German concessions to Japan. That sparked widespread student protests in China on 4 May, later known as the May Fourth Movement, which eventually pressured the government into refusing to sign the Treaty of Versailles. Thus, the Chinese delegation at the conference was the only one not to sign the treaty at the signing ceremony.

==Other nations&#x27; approach==
===All-Russian Government (Whites)===
While Russia was formally excluded from the Conference although it had fought against the Central Powers for three years. However the Russian Provincial Council (chaired by Prince Lvov), the successor to the Russian Constituent Assembly and the political arm of the Russian White movement attended the conference and was represented by the former tsarist minister Sergey Sazonov, who, if the tsar had not been overthrown, would most likely have attended the conference anyway. The Council maintained the position of an indivisible Russia, but some were prepared to negotiate over the loss of Poland and Finland. The Council suggested all matters relating to territorial claims or demands for autonomy within the former Russian Empire be referred to a new All-Russian Constituent Assembly.

===Baltic states===
Delegations from the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, led respectively by Jaan Poska, Jānis Čakste and Augustinas Voldemaras, also participated in the conference, and successfully achieved international recognition of the independence of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

===Ukraine===

Ukraine had its best opportunity to win recognition and support from foreign powers at the conference. At a meeting of the Big Five on 16 January, Lloyd George called Ukrainian leader Symon Petliura an adventurer and dismissed Ukraine as an anti-Bolshevik stronghold. Sir Eyre Crowe, British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, spoke against a union of East Galicia and Poland. The British cabinet never decided whether to support a united or dismembered Russia. The United States was sympathetic to a strong, united Russia, as a counterpoise to Japan, but Britain feared a threat to India. Petliura appointed Count Tyshkevich as his representative to the Vatican, and Pope Benedict XV recognized Ukrainian independence, but Ukraine was effectively ignored.

===Belarus===
A delegation of the Belarusian Democratic Republic, under Prime Minister Anton Łuckievič, also participated in the conference, and attempted to gain international recognition of the independence of Belarus. On the way to the conference, the delegation was received by Czechoslovak President Tomáš Masaryk in Prague. During the conference, Łuckievič had meetings with the exiled foreign minister of Admiral Alexander Kolchak&#x27;s Russian government, Sergey Sazonov, and Polish Prime Minister Ignacy Jan Paderewski.

===Minority rights===
At the insistence of Wilson, the Big Four required Poland to sign a treaty on 28 June 1919 that guaranteed minority rights in the new nation. Poland signed under protest and made little effort to enforce the specified rights for Germans, Jews, Ukrainians, and other minorities. Similar treaties were signed by Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria and later by Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania. Estonia had already given cultural autonomy to minorities in its declaration of independence. Finland and Germany were not asked to sign a minority treaty.

In Poland, the key provisions were to become fundamental laws, which would override any national legal codes or legislation. The new country pledged to assure &quot;full and complete protection of life and liberty to all individuals... without distinction of birth, nationality, language, race, or religion.&quot; Freedom of religion was guaranteed to everyone. Most residents were given citizenship, but there was considerable ambiguity on who was covered. The treaty guaranteed basic civil, political, and cultural rights and required all citizens to be equal before the law and enjoy identical rights of citizens and workers. Polish was to be the national language, but the treaty provided for minority languages to be freely used privately, in commerce, in religion, in the press, at public meetings, and before all courts. Minorities were to be permitted to establish and control at their own expense private charities, churches, social institutions, and schools, without interference from the government, which was required to set up German-language public schools in districts that had been German before the war. All education above the primary level was to be conducted exclusively in the national language. Article 12 was the enforcement clause and gave the Council of the League of Nations the responsibility to monitor and enforce the treaties.

===Caucasus===

The three South Caucasian republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia and the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus all sent a delegation to the conference. Their attempts to gain protection from threats posed by the ongoing Russian Civil War largely failed since none of the major powers was interested in taking a mandate over the Caucasian territories. After a series of delays, the three South Caucasian countries ultimately gained &quot;de facto&quot; recognition from the Supreme Council of the Allied powers but only after all European troops had been withdrawn from the Caucasus, except for a British contingent in Batumi. Georgia was recognized &quot;de facto&quot; on 12 January 1920, followed by Azerbaijan the same day and Armenia on 19 January 1920. The Allied leaders decided to limit their assistance to the Caucasian republics to the supply of arms, munitions, and food.

The Armenian delegation included Avetis Aharonian, Hamo Ohanjanyan, and Armen Garo. The Azerbaijani mission was headed by Alimardan bey Topchubashov and included Mammad Hasan Hajinski, Akbar agha Sheykhulislamov, Ahmet Ağaoğlu and Mahammad Amin Rasulzade, first president of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. The Georgian delegation included Nikolay Chkheidze, Irakli Tsereteli, and Zurab Avalishvili.

===Korea===

After a failed attempt by the Korean National Association to send a three-man delegation to Paris, a delegation of Koreans from China and Hawaii made it there. It included a representative from the Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai, Kim Kyu-sik. They were aided by the Chinese, who were eager for the opportunity to embarrass Japan at the international forum. Several top Chinese leaders at the time, including Sun Yat-sen, told US diplomats that the conference should take up the question of Korean independence. However, the Chinese, already locked in a struggle against the Japanese, could do little else for Korea. Other than China, no nation took the Koreans seriously at the conference because it already had the status of a Japanese colony. The failure of Korean nationalists to gain support from the conference ended their hopes of foreign support.

===Palestine===

After the conference&#x27;s decision to separate the former Arab provinces from the Ottoman Empire and to apply the new mandate-system to them, the World Zionist Organization submitted its draft resolutions for consideration by the conference.
The February 1919 statement included the following main points: recognition of Jewish &quot;title&quot; over the land, a declaration of the borders (significantly larger than in the prior Sykes-Picot agreement), and League of Nations sovereignty under British mandate. An offshoot of the conference was convened at San Remo in 1920, leading to the creation of the Mandate for Palestine, which was to come into force in 1923.

===Assyrians===
Up to 300 000 Assyrians died during the Assyrian genocide in the years before the conference. Several delegations of Assyrians participated to fulfill wishes of a free Assyria. The delegations came from different parts of the world. Syriac Orthodox Bishop of Syria Aphrem Barsoum (b. 1887), later Patriarch of the church, has often been depicted as a leader of the &quot;Assyro-Chaldean delegation&quot;. An Assyrian delegation from the United States was also present, representing the Assyrian National Association in America. A delegation from Constantinople represented the Assyro-Chaldean National Council, formed in 1919 after Syriac-Orthodox, Chaldean Catholics and Syriac Catholics had united and declared their basic political and national unity under the &quot;Assyro-Chaldean&quot; name. There was also one delegation from Caucasia and one from Persia.

===Aromanians===
During the Peace Conference, a delegation of Aromanians participated in order to fulfill autonomist wishes for the Aromanian people in the same vein as the Samarina Republic attempt two years earlier, but failed to accomplish any recognition for the self-rule desires of their people.
==Women&#x27;s approach==
An unprecedented aspect of the conference was concerted pressure brought to bear on delegates by a committee of women, who sought to establish and entrench women&#x27;s fundamental social, economic, and political rights, such as that of suffrage, within the peace framework. Although they were denied seats at the Paris Conference, the leadership of Marguerite de Witt-Schlumberger, the president of the French Union for Women&#x27;s Suffrage, caused an Inter-Allied Women&#x27;s Conference (IAWC) to be convened, which met from 10 February to 10 April 1919.

The IAWC lobbied Wilson and then the other delegates of the Paris Conference to admit women to its committees, and it was successful in achieving a hearing from the conference&#x27;s Commissions for International Labour Legislation and then the League of Nations Commission. One key and concrete outcome of the IAWC&#x27;s work was Article 7 of the Covenant of the League of Nations: &quot;All positions under or in connection with the League, including the Secretariat, shall be open equally to men and women.&quot; More generally, the IAWC placed the issue of women&#x27;s rights at the center of the new world order that was established in Paris.

== Pan-African Congress ==
The first Pan-African Congress, supported by W.E.B. Du Bois, unsuccessfully petitioned the Paris Conference to turn Germany&#x27;s colonies over to an international organization instead of to other colonial powers.

==Historical assessments==
The remaking of the world map at the conferences gave birth to a number of critical conflict-prone contradictions internationally that would become some of the causes of World War II. The British historian Eric Hobsbawm claimed: 

Hobsbawm and other left-wing historians have argued that Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points, particularly the principle of self-determination, were measures that were primarily against the Bolsheviks and designed, by playing the nationalist card, to tame the revolutionary fever that was sweeping across Europe in the wake of the October Revolution and the end of the war: 

The right-wing historian John Lewis Gaddis agreed: &quot;When Woodrow Wilson made the principle of self-determination one of his Fourteen Points his intent had been to undercut the appeal of Bolshevism.&quot;

That view has a long history and can be summarised by Ray Stannard Baker&#x27;s famous remark: &quot;Paris cannot be understood without Moscow.&quot;

The British historian Antony Lentin viewed Lloyd George&#x27;s role in Paris as a major success:

<doc id="295107" wikidata="Q1431295" url="?curid=295107" title="Fairbanks International Airport">
<text>Fairbanks International Airport is a state-owned public-use airport located three miles (5 km) southwest of the central business district of Fairbanks, a city in the Fairbanks North Star Borough of the United States state of Alaska. It is located in the South Van Horn census-designated place. Fairbanks was the smallest city in the United States with regularly scheduled non-stop international flights, as Condor offered weekly flights to Frankfurt during the summer tourist season. Air North is now the only international airline to offer scheduled charters with flights (to Canada).

==History==

===Early years===
The airport opened in 1951 and took over existing scheduled airline traffic to Fairbanks, which had previously used Ladd Army Airfield. Alaska Airlines used Fairbanks as its main hub in the 1950s, with service to Seattle and Portland as well as intrastate service to Anchorage, Nome and other destinations. By 1967, however, the airline shifted its Alaska hub to Anchorage; its Anchorage-Fairbanks service continues to this day. In the mid-1970s, following the development of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, Alaska Airlines and Braniff International offered &quot;interchange service&quot; between Fairbanks and Houston via Anchorage, Seattle and Dallas. In 1982, following airline deregulation, Alaska Airlines and American Airlines began a similar interchange service using Boeing 727s.

Pan American World Airways had also served Fairbanks since 1932. The station was originally opened after the acquisition of Pacific International Airways and used for short-haul services to Juneau, Seattle, Ketchikan, Whitehorse and other destinations. Pan Am intended to use Fairbanks as a stop for service to Asia as early as 1931, but initial difficulty in negotiating landing rights with the Soviet Union, followed by the outbreak of World War II, delayed these plans until decades later. Pan Am service to Fairbanks continued through the opening of FAI until 1965, when the Civil Aeronautics Board terminated Pan Am&#x27;s rights to serve Alaska.

Pan American World Airways eventually used Fairbanks as a stopover for transpacific service from New York and Seattle to Tokyo starting in September 1969. In 1974, Pan Am agreed to transfer its Fairbanks-Seattle service to Western Airlines, and requested that the CAB allow its New York-Tokyo service to be suspended from April 1975. Other carriers such as Japan Airlines and Korean Air began to use Fairbanks as a technical stop for transpacific cargo flights in the late 1970s.

===Development since the 2000s===
Condor started a seasonal route to Frankfurt in May 2001. The inbound flight stopped in Whitehorse, Canada, and the outbound one was nonstop. On October 11, 2009, the airport completed a new terminal and began demolishing the old terminal which was built in 1948. The new terminal is built around the modern TSA standards. In addition to architectural design and better security, the main terminal now has six jet-bridges (up from the former five). The 2,700m2 of custom-unitized curtain wall was designed and supplied by Overgaard Ltd. Hong Kong. The special design incorporates double low-&quot;e&quot; triple glazing. The new building&#x27;s footprint is smaller than the old building.

For the 12-month period ending February 28, 2018, the airport had 119,898 aircraft operations, an average of 328 per day: 58% general aviation, 31% air taxi, 9% scheduled commercial, and 2% military. At that time there were 569 aircraft based at this airport: 91% single-engine, 8% multi-engine, &lt;1% jet and &lt;1% helicopter.

==Facilities==
===Terminal===
The terminal building, situated on the northwest side of the airport, contains eight gates: two for commuter carriers and six for larger carriers.

===Runways===
Fairbanks International Airport covers an area of 3,470 acres (1,404 ha) at an elevation of 439 feet (134 m) above mean sea level. It has four runways:
* Runway 2L/20R: 11,800 by 150 feet (3,597 x 46 m), surface: asphalt
* Runway 2R/20L: 4,510 by 75 feet (1,375 x 23 m), surface: asphalt

==Accidents and incidents==
* On December 30, 1951, Transocean Air Lines Flight 501, a Curtiss C-46 Commando, a cargo flight, crashed on approach to FAI due to not following radio procedures and spatial disorientation. All four occupants were killed. The wreckage was found on January 3, 1952.
* On February 16, 1975, a Pacific Alaska Airlines DC-6, a cargo flight, crashed attempting to return to Fairbanks Int&#x27;l Airport. Three engines lost power after takeoff from runway 10 and crashed 2 km short of runway 19 attempting to return to the airport possibly due to fuel contamination. All three occupants were killed.
* On February 28, 1994, during takeoff for a ferry flight to Miami, a Lockheed L-1011-1 Tristar of Rich International Airways (registered N303EA) experienced a mechanical power loss on the number 3 and number 1 engines and an internal fire on the number 1 engine. The takeoff was aborted and during the taxi back, the fire on the number 1 engine was extinguished. None of the 3 occupants on board were injured.
* On April 23, 2024, approximately six minutes after takeoff, an Alaska Air Fuel DC-4, (registered N3054V), suffered an engine explosion and crashed along the Tanana River 7 miles southwest of Fairbanks. Two occupants were onboard the plane, both were killed.

<text>Bernard Landry (; March 9, 1937 – November 6, 2018) was a Canadian politician who served as the 28th premier of Quebec from 2001 to 2003. A member of the Parti Québécois (PQ), he led the party from 2001 to 2005, also serving as the leader of the Opposition from 2003 to 2005.

==Personal life==
Landry was born on March 9, 1937, in Saint-Jacques, Quebec, (near Joliette), the son of Thérèse Granger and Bernard Landry. Landry was first married to Lorraine Laporte first a lawyer and later a court judge on Quebec justice system with whom he had three children. After his wife&#x27;s death to cancer in 1999, in 2004, he married script writer and former yé-yé singer and actress Chantal Renaud.
Landry was classically trained by the clergy and retained some Latin. A native speaker of French, he also spoke fluent English and Spanish.

Landry received a degree in law from the Université de Montréal, and a degree in economics and finance from Sciences Po Paris. While at the Université de Montréal, he had a small acting role in Denis Héroux&#x27;s student film &quot;Over My Head (Jusqu&#x27;au cou)&quot;.

From September 2005, he was a professor at UQAM in the business strategy department.

On February 9, 2008, Landry hosted the final round of the Finance Quiz at the 2008 Financial Open at UQAM.

Landry died on November 6, 2018, from complications of pulmonary fibrosis at the age of 81. He was given a state funeral at Basilique Notre-Dame de Montréal.

==Politics==
Landry ran unsuccessfully in Joliette in the 1970 election and in Joliette-Montcalm in 1973. He was a practising lawyer and a partner in the Montreal law firm of Lapointe Rosenstein when he was elected to the National Assembly of Quebec in the 1976 general election in Fabre. Under the Parti Québécois government of René Lévesque, he served as Minister of State of Economic Development from February 2, 1977, to March 12, 1981. Re-elected in the riding of Laval-des-rapides at the 1981 general election, he was again Minister of State of Economic Development until September 9, 1982, when he was made Delegate Minister to Exterior Commerce. He was later Minister of International Relations and Exterior Commerce, and Minister of Finance in the same government.

During the 1988 Canadian federal election, Landry backed the Free Trade Agreement. His support, along with Jacques Parizeau played a role in Brian Mulroney&#x27;s dominance in Quebec during the election.

After the defeat of Parti Québécois in the 1985 general election, he taught in the Department of Administrative Sciences at the Université du Québec à Montréal until 1994. After the victory of the PQ in the 1994 general election, the newly elected Premier, Jacques Parizeau, made him his Deputy Premier, a position he held from September 26, 1994, to December 15, 1998.

As finance minister, Landry reduced program expenditures to balance the budget. The PQ and sovereignty lost public support and has not been restored to previous levels since.

It was reported in the Montreal Gazette, and picked up by the New York Times, that Landry spoke disparagingly of immigrants on the night of the 1995 referendum. In an unconfirmed article by The Gazette, an English-language paper in Montreal, it was reported that two employees at the Inter-Continental hotel in the city planned to file a complaint against Mr. Landry with the Quebec Human Rights Commission. Anita Martinez, a night clerk at the hotel, said that Mr. Landry told her, &quot;It was because of you immigrants that the &#x27;no&#x27; won,&quot; and added, &quot;Why is it that we open the doors to this country so you can vote &#x27;no&#x27; &quot; to Quebec sovereignty?. Landry himself firmly denied having ever been either impolite to the two women, nor having ever made the comments regarding immigrants.

Landry became Premier of Quebec on March 8, 2001, following the resignation of Lucien Bouchard. He was a Quebec sovereigntist advocating a supranational confederation of Quebec and Canada, inspired by the institutions of the European Union. As such, he was one of the most faithful followers of René Lévesque and the other sovereignty-associationists.

In 2001, Landry was critical about Quebec receiving an extra $1.5 billion in equalization payments calling it degrading Quebec status and accused Ottawa for short-changing the province for decades by stating &quot;Receiving equalization payments for more than 40 years in a row is clear evidence that the central government failed in redistributing real wealth,&quot;.

During the Parti Québécois leadership race of 2001, Landry criticized the federal government&#x27;s policy of prominently displaying the maple leaf on federal government buildings and programs by saying, &quot;&quot; (Quebec does not prostitute itself for a piece of red cloth). Landry&#x27;s aggressive remarks were widely criticized for insulting the Canadian flag, particularly among English-language media which rendered &quot;chiffon&quot; as &quot;rag&quot;. Landry subsequently apologized but insisted that his words had been mistranslated. Landry&#x27;s opponents used the controversy to undermine his national political cachet.

In 2003, Landry lost the Quebec general election to Jean Charest&#x27;s Quebec Liberal Party. A renowned documentary named &quot;À hauteur d&#x27;homme&quot; about his viewpoint of the election was produced in 2003. At the August 2004 Parti Québécois National Council, after a long period of reflection that began the day after the election, he announced on August 27, 2004, that he would remain president of the party, and lead the PQ to the next election in order to bring Quebec to independence. However, on June 4, 2005, Landry announced he would resign as party leader after gaining 76.2% approval in a leadership confidence vote at a party convention in Quebec City, which he did not consider sufficient support.

After retirement, Landry stayed active in politics as a critic and to encourage young people to be involved in politics.

<text>Rijeka (; ), also known as Fiume (; Fiuman: &quot;Fiume&quot;; ; outdated ), is the principal seaport and the third-largest city in Croatia (after Zagreb and Split). It is located in Primorje-Gorski Kotar County on Kvarner Bay, an inlet of the Adriatic Sea and in 2021 had a population of 107,964 inhabitants. Historically, because of its strategic position and its excellent deep-water port, the city was fiercely contested, especially between the Holy Roman Empire, Italy and Croatia, changing rulers and demographics many times over centuries. According to the 2011 census data, the majority of its citizens are Croats, along with small numbers of Serbs, Bosniaks and Italians.

Rijeka is the main city and county seat of the Primorje-Gorski Kotar County. The city&#x27;s economy largely depends on shipbuilding (shipyards &quot;3. Maj&quot; and &quot;Viktor Lenac Shipyard&quot;) and maritime transport. Rijeka hosts the Croatian National Theatre Ivan pl. Zajc, first built in 1765, as well as the University of Rijeka, founded in 1973 but with roots dating back to 1632 and the local Jesuit School of Theology.

Apart from Croatian and Italian, linguistically the city is home to its own unique dialect of the Venetian language, Fiuman, with an estimated 20,000 speakers among the local Italians, Croats and other minorities. Historically Fiuman served as the main &quot;lingua franca&quot; among the many ethnicities inhabiting the multi-ethnic port city. In certain suburbs of the modern extended municipality the autochthonous population still speaks Chakavian, a dialect of Croatian.

In 2016, Rijeka was selected as the European Capital of Culture for 2020, alongside Galway, Ireland.

==Name==
Historically, Rijeka was called Tharsatica, Vitopolis (), or Flumen () in Latin. The city is called in Croatian, in Slovene, and or in the local dialects of the Chakavian language. It is called in Italian and in Fiuman Venetian. All these names mean &#x27;river&#x27; in their respective languages. Meanwhile, in German the city has been called / (, with the name of the river being derived from Latin ).

==Geography==

Rijeka is located in western Croatia, south-west of the capital, Zagreb, on the coast of Kvarner Gulf, in the northern part of the Adriatic Sea. Geographically, Rijeka is roughly equidistant from Milan (), Budapest (), Munich (), Vienna () and Belgrade (). Other major regional centers such as Trieste (), Venice () and Ljubljana () are all relatively close and easily accessible. The Bay of Rijeka, which is bordered by Vela Vrata (between Istria and the island of Cres), Srednja Vrata (between Cres and Krk Island) and Mala Vrata (between Krk and the mainland) is connected to the Kvarner Gulf and is deep enough (about ) to accommodate large commercial ships. The City of Rijeka lies at the mouth of the river Rječina and in the Vinodol micro-region of the Croatian coast. From three sides Rijeka is surrounded by mountains. To the west, the Učka range is prominent. To the north/north-east there are the Snežnik plateau and the Risnjak massif with the national park. To the east/south-east there is the Velika Kapela range. This type of terrain configuration prevented Rijeka from developing further inland (to the north) and the city mostly lies on a long and relatively narrow strip along the coast. Two important inland transport routes start in Rijeka. The first route runs north-east to the Pannonian Basin. This route takes advantage of Rijeka&#x27;s location close to the point where the Dinaric Alps are the narrowest (about ) and easiest to traverse, making it the optimal route from the Hungarian plain to the sea. It also makes Rijeka the natural harbour for the Pannonian Basin (especially Hungary). The other route runs north-west across the Postojna Gate connecting Rijeka with Slovenia and further through the Ljubljana Gap with Austria and beyond. A third more coastal route runs east-west connecting Rijeka (and—by extension—the Adriatic coastal cities to the south) with Trieste and northern Italy.

==History==


===Ancient and Medieval times===
Though traces of Neolithic settlements can be found in the region, the earliest modern settlements on the site were Celtic Tharsatica (modern Trsat, now part of Rijeka) on the hill, and the tribe of mariners, the Liburni, in the natural harbour below. The city long retained its dual character. Rijeka was first mentioned in the 1st century AD by Pliny the Elder as Tarsatica in his &quot;Natural History&quot; (iii.140). Rijeka (Tarsatica) is again mentioned around AD 150 by the Greek geographer and astronomer Ptolemy in his Geography when describing the &quot;Location of Illyria or Liburnia, and of Dalmatia&quot; (Fifth Map of Europe). In the time of Augustus, the Romans rebuilt Tarsatica as a &quot;municipium&quot; Flumen (MacMullen 2000), situated on the right bank of the small river Rječina (whose name means &quot;the big river&quot;). It became a city within the Roman Province of Dalmatia until the 6th century. In this period the city is part of the Liburnia limes (system of walls and fortifications against raiding Barbarians). Remains of these walls are still visible in some places today.

After the 4th century Rijeka was rededicated to St. Vitus, the city&#x27;s patron saint, as &quot;Terra Fluminis sancti Sancti Viti&quot; or in German &quot;Sankt Veit am Pflaum&quot;. From the 5th century onwards, the town was ruled successively by the Ostrogoths, the Byzantines, the Lombards, and the Avars. The city was burned down in 452 by the troops of Attila the Hun as part of their Aquileia campaign. Croats settled the city starting in the 7th century giving it the Croatian name, &quot;Rika svetoga Vida&quot; (&quot;the river of Saint Vitus&quot;). At the time, Rijeka was a feudal stronghold surrounded by a wall. At the center of the city, its highest point, was a fortress.

In 799 Rijeka was attacked by the Frankish troops of Charlemagne. Their Siege of Trsat was at first repulsed, during which the Frankish commander Duke Eric of Friuli was killed. However, the Frankish forces finally occupied and devastated the castle, while the Duchy of Croatia passed under the overlordship of the Carolingian Empire. From about 925, the town was part of the Kingdom of Croatia, from 1102 in personal union with Hungary. Trsat Castle and the town was rebuilt under the rule of the House of Frankopan. In 1288 the Rijeka citizens signed the Law codex of Vinodol, one of the oldest codes of law in Europe.

In the period from about 1300 to 1466 Rijeka was ruled by a number of noble families, the most prominent of which was the German Walsee family. Rijeka even rivalled Venice when in it was sold by Rambert II Walsee to the Habsburg emperor Frederick III, Archduke of Austria in 1466. It would remain under Austrian Habsburg rule for over 450 years (except for a brief period of French rule between 1809 and 1813) until the end of World War I in 1918 when it was occupied by Croatian and subsequently by Italian irregulars.

===Under Habsburg rule===
Austrian presence on the Adriatic Sea was seen as a threat by the Republic of Venice and during the War of the League of Cambrai the Venetians raided and devastated the city with great loss of life in 1508 and again in 1509. The city did however recover and remain under Austrian rule. For its fierce resistance to the Venetians it received the title of the &quot;most loyal city&quot; (&quot;fidelissimum oppidium&quot;) as well as commercial privileges from the Austrian emperor Maximilian I in 1515. While Ottoman forces attacked the town several times, they never occupied it. From the 16th century onwards, Rijeka&#x27;s present Renaissance and Baroque style started to take shape. Emperor Charles VI declared the Port of Rijeka a free port (together with the Port of Trieste) in 1719 and had the trade route to Vienna expanded in 1725.

On November 28, 1750 Rijeka was hit by a large earthquake. The devastation was so widespread that the city had to be almost completely rebuilt. In 1753, the Austrian Empress Maria Theresa approved the funding for rebuilding Rijeka as a &quot;new city&quot; (&quot;Civitas nova&quot;). The rebuilt Rijeka was significantly different - it was transformed from a small medieval walled town into a larger commercial and maritime city centered around its port.

By order of Maria Theresa in 1779, the city was annexed to the Kingdom of Hungary and governed as &quot;corpus separatum&quot; directly from Budapest by an appointed governor, as Hungary&#x27;s only international port. From 1804, Rijeka was part of the Austrian Empire (Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia after the Compromise of 1867), in the Croatia-Slavonia province.

During the Napoleonic Wars, Rijeka was briefly captured by the French Empire and included in the Illyrian Provinces. During the French rule, between 1809 and 1813, the critically important Louisiana road was completed (named after Napoleon&#x27;s wife Marie Louise). The road was the shortest route from Rijeka to the interior (Karlovac) and gave a strong impulse to the development of Rijeka&#x27;s port. In 1813 the French rule came to an end when Rijeka was first bombarded by the Royal Navy and later re-captured by the Austrians under the command of the Irish general Laval Nugent von Westmeath. The British bombardment has an interesting side story. The city was apparently saved from annihilation by a young lady named Karolina Belinić who - amid the chaos and destruction of the bombardment - went to the English fleet commander and convinced him that further bombardment of the city was unnecessary (the small French garrison was quickly defeated and left the city). The legend of Karolina is warmly remembered by the population even today. She became a folk hero Karolina Riječka (Caroline of Rijeka) and has been celebrated in plays, movies and even in a rock opera.

In the early 19th century, the most prominent economical and cultural leader of the city was Andrija Ljudevit Adamić. Fiume also had a significant naval base, and in the mid-19th century it became the site of the Austro-Hungarian Naval Academy (K.u.K. Marine-Akademie), where the Austro-Hungarian Navy trained its officers.

===Hungarian Crown===
During the Hungarian revolution of 1848, when Hungary tried to gain independence from Austria, Rijeka was captured by the Croatian troops (loyal to Austria) commanded by Ban Josip Jelačić. The city was then annexed directly to Croatia, although it did keep a degree of autonomy.

Giovanni de Ciotta (mayor from 1872 to 1896) proved to be an authoritative local political leader. Under his leadership, an impressive phase of expansion of the city started, marked by major port development, fuelled by the general expansion of international trade and the city&#x27;s connection (1873) to the Austro-Hungarian railway network. Modern industrial and commercial enterprises such as the Royal Hungarian Sea Navigation Company &quot;Adria&quot;, a rival shipping company the Ungaro-Croata (established in 1891) and the Smith and Meynier paper mill (which operated the first steam engine in south-east Europe), situated in the Rječina canyon, producing cigarette paper sold around the world.

The second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century (up to World War I) was a period of great prosperity, rapid economic growth and technological dynamism for Rijeka. Many authors and witnesses describe Rijeka of this time as a rich, tolerant, well-to-do town which offered a good standard of living, with endless possibilities for making one&#x27;s fortune. The Pontifical Delegate Celso Costantini noted in his diary &quot;the religious indifference and apathy of the town&quot;. The further industrial development of the city included the first industrial scale oil refinery in Europe in 1882 and the first torpedo factory in the world in 1866, after Robert Whitehead, manager of the &quot;Stabilimento Tecnico Fiumano&quot; (an Austrian engineering company engaged in providing engines for the Austro-Hungarian Navy), designed and successfully tested the world&#x27;s first torpedo. In addition to the Whitehead Torpedo Works, which opened in 1874, the oil refinery (1882) and the paper mill, many other industrial and commercial enterprises were established or expanded in these years. These include a rice husking and starch factory (one of the largest in the world), a wood and furniture company, a wheat elevator and mill, the Ganz-Danubius shipbuilding industries, a cocoa and chocolate factory, a brick factory, a tobacco factory (the largest in the Monarchy), a cognac distillery, a pasta factory, the Ossoinack barrel and chest factory, a large tannery, five foundries and many others. At the beginning of the 20th century more than half of the industrial capacity in Croatia (which was at that time mostly agrarian) was located in Rijeka.

Rijeka&#x27;s Austro-Hungarian Marine Academy became a pioneering centre for high-speed photography. The Austrian physicist Peter Salcher working in the Academy took the first photograph of a bullet flying at supersonic speed in 1886, devising a technique that was later used by Ernst Mach in his studies of supersonic motion.

Rijeka&#x27;s port underwent tremendous development fuelled by generous Hungarian investments, becoming the main maritime outlet for Hungary and the eastern part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. By 1913–14, the port of Fiume became the tenth-busiest port in Europe. The population grew rapidly from only 21,000 in 1880 to 50,000 in 1910. Major civic buildings constructed at this time include the Governor&#x27;s Palace, designed by the Hungarian architect Alajos Hauszmann. There was an ongoing competition between Rijeka and Trieste, the main maritime outlet for Austria—reflecting the rivalry between the two components of the Dual Monarchy. The Austro-Hungarian Navy sought to keep the balance by ordering new warships from the shipyards of both cities.

During this period the city had an Italian majority. According to the census of 1880, in Rijeka there were 9,076 Italians, 7,991 Croats, 895 Germans and 383 Hungarians. Some historians claim that the city had a Slavic majority at the beginning of the 19th century, because the 1851 census reported a Croatian majority. However, this census is considered not very reliable by Italian historians.
At the last Austro-Hungarian census in 1910, the &quot;corpus separatum&quot; had a population of 49,806 people and was composed of the following linguistic communities:

By religion, the census of 1910 indicates that - from the total of 49,806 inhabitants - there were 45,130 Catholics, 1,696 Jewish, 1,123 Calvinist, 995 Orthodox and 311 Lutheran. The Jewish population expanded rapidly, particularly in the 1870s-1880s, and built a large synagogue in 1907 (which would be destroyed in 1944, during the German occupation, concurrent with the murder of most of the city&#x27;s Jewish residents). On the eve of WWI, there were 165 inns, 10 hotels with restaurants, 17 cafés, 17 jewellers, 37 barbers and 265 tailor shops in Rijeka.

=== World War I ===

World War I put an end to Rijeka&#x27;s &quot;golden era&quot; of peace, stability and rapid economic growth. The city would never quite recover to the same level of prosperity. Initially there was a semblance of normalcy (the city was far from the frontlines), however - a growing part of the male population started to be mobilized by the army and the navy. The city&#x27;s war-related industries continued to work full steam and contributed significantly to the Austro-Hungarian war effort, especially to the navy. The shipyard Ganz-Danubius produced a number of warships and submarines like the U-27-class submarines, the Novara-class cruisers, the large battleship SMS Szent István and others. In total, between the early 1900s and 1918 the city&#x27;s shipyards produced 1 battleship, 2 cruisers, 20 destroyers, 32 torpedo boats and 15 submarines for the navy. Rijeka was also the main center for the production of torpedoes. However, a lot changed with the war becoming a protracted conflict and especially with the Italian declaration of war on Austria-Hungary in May 1915. This opened a frontline only 90 km from the city and caused a pervasive sense of anxiety among the large Italian population. Several hundred Italians, considered disloyal (enemy non-combatants) by the authorities, were deported to camps in Hungary (Tápiósüly and Kiskunhalas), where many died of malnutrition and diseases. The torpedo factory was attacked by the Italian airship &quot;Citta` di Novara&quot; in 1915 (later shot down by Austrian hydroplanes) and suffered damages. As a consequence - most of the torpedo production was moved to Sankt Pölten in Austria, further away from the frontlines. The city was again attacked by Italian airplanes in 1916 and suffered minor damage. The Naval Academy ceased its activities and was converted to a war hospital (the ex-naval academy buildings are still housing the city hospital to this day). On 10 February 1918 the Italian navy raided the nearby bay of Bakar causing little material damage but achieving a significant propaganda effect. As the war dragged on, the city&#x27;s economy and the living standard of the population deteriorated rapidly. Due to a maritime blockade, the port traffic suffered a collapse - from 2,892.538 tons in 1913 (before the war) to only 330.313 tons in 1918. Many factories - lacking manpower and/or raw materials - reduced the production or simply closed. Shortages of food and other basic necessities became widespread. Even public safety became a problem with an increase in the number of thefts, violent incidents and war profiteering. The crisis escalated on October 23, 1918, when the Croatian troops stationed in Rijeka (79th regiment) mutinied and temporarily took control of the city. Amid growing chaos, the Austro-Hungarian empire dissolved a few weeks later, on November 12, 1918, starting a long period of instability and uncertainty for the city.

=== The &quot;Fiume Question&quot; and the Italian-Yugoslav dispute ===


Habsburg-ruled Austria-Hungary&#x27;s disintegration in October 1918 during the closing weeks of World War I led to the establishment of rival Croatian-Serbian and Italian administrations in the city; both Italy and the founders of the new Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) claimed sovereignty based on their &quot;irredentist&quot; (&quot;unredeemed&quot;) ethnic populations.

After a brief military occupation by the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, followed by the unilateral annexation of the former Corpus Separatum by Belgrade, an international force of British, Italian, French and American troops entered the city in November 1918. Its future became a major barrier to agreement during the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. The US president Wilson even proposed to make Rijeka a free city and the headquarters of the newly formed League of Nations.
The main problem arose from the fact that Rijeka was not assigned either to Italy or to Croatia (now Yugoslavia) in the Treaty of London which defined the post-war borders in the area. It remained assigned to Austria-Hungary because - until the very end of WWI - it was assumed that the Austro-Hungarian empire would survive WWI in some form and Rijeka was to become its only seaport (Trieste was to be annexed by Italy). However, once the empire disintegrated, the status of the city became disputed. Italy based its claim on the fact that Italians comprised the largest single nationality within the city (46.9% of the total population). Croats made up most of the remainder and were a majority in the surrounding area. Andrea Ossoinack, who had been the last delegate from Fiume to the Hungarian Parliament, was admitted to the conference as a representative of Fiume, and essentially supported the Italian claims. Nevertheless, at this point the city had had for years a strong and very active Autonomist Party seeking for Rijeka a special independent status among nations as a multicultural Adriatic city. This movement even had its delegate at the Paris peace conference - Ruggero Gotthardi.

===The Regency of Carnaro===

On 10 September 1919, the Treaty of Saint-Germain was signed, declaring the Austro-Hungarian monarchy dissolved. Negotiations over the future of the city were interrupted two days later when a force of Italian nationalist irregulars led by the poet Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio captured the city. Because the Italian government, wishing to respect its international obligations, did not want to annex Fiume, D&#x27;Annunzio and the intellectuals at his side eventually established an independent state, the Italian Regency of Carnaro, a unique social experiment for the age and a revolutionary cultural experience in which various international intellectuals of diverse walks of life took part (like Osbert Sitwell, Arturo Toscanini, Henry Furst, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Harukichi Shimoi, Guglielmo Marconi, Alceste De Ambris, Whitney Warren and Léon Kochnitzky).

Among the many political experiments that took place during this experience, D&#x27;Annunzio and his men undertook a first attempt to establish a movement of non-aligned nations in the so-called League of Fiume, an organisation antithetic to the Wilsonian League of Nations, which it saw as a means of perpetuating a corrupt and imperialist &quot;status quo&quot;. The organisation was aiming primarily at helping all oppressed nationalities in their struggle for political dignity and recognition, establishing links with many movements on various continents, but it never found the necessary external support and its main legacy remains today the Regency of Carnaro&#x27;s recognition of Soviet Russia, the first state in the world to have done so.
The Liberal Giovanni Giolitti became Premier of Italy again in June 1920; this signalled a hardening of official attitudes to D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s &quot;coup&quot;. On 12 November, Italy and Yugoslavia concluded the Treaty of Rapallo, which envisaged Fiume becoming an independent state, the Free State of Fiume, under a government acceptable to both powers. D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s response was characteristically flamboyant and of doubtful judgment: his declaration of war against Italy invited the bombardment by Italian royal forces which led to his surrender of the city at the end of the year, after five days&#x27; resistance (known as Bloody Christmas). Italian troops freed the city from D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s militias in the last days of December 1920. After a world war and additional two years of economic paralysis the city economy was nearing collapse and the population was exhausted.

===The Free State of Fiume===

In a subsequent democratic election the Fiuman electorate on 24 April 1921 approved the idea of a free state of Fiume-Rijeka with a Fiuman-Italo-Yugoslav consortium ownership structure for the port, giving an overwhelming victory to the independentist candidates of the Autonomist Party. Fiume became consequently a full-fledged member of the League of Nations and the ensuing election of Rijeka&#x27;s first president, Riccardo Zanella, was met with official recognition and greetings from all major powers and countries worldwide. Despite many positive developments leading to the establishment of the new state&#x27;s structures, the subsequent formation of a constituent assembly for the state did not put an end to strife within the city. A brief Italian nationalist seizure of power ended with the intervention of an Italian royal commissioner, and another short-lived peace was interrupted by a local Fascist putsch in March 1922 which ended with a third Italian intervention to restore the previous order. Seven months later the Kingdom of Italy itself fell under Fascist rule and Fiume&#x27;s fate was therefore sealed, the Italian Fascist Party being among the strongest proponents of the annexation of Fiume to Italy. The Free State of Fiume thus was to officially become the first country victim of fascist expansionism.

=== The territory of Fiume part of the Kingdom of Italy ===

The period of diplomatic acrimony was closed by the bilateral Treaty of Rome (27 January 1924), signed by Italy and Yugoslavia. With it the two neighbouring countries agreed to partition the territory of the small state. Most of the old Corpus Separatum territory became part of Italy, while a few Croatian/Slovenian-speaking villages to the north of the city were annexed by Yugoslavia. The annexation happened de facto on 16 March 1924, and it inaugurated about twenty years of Italian government for the city proper, to the detriment of the Croatian minority, which fell victim of discrimination and targeted assimilation policies.

The city became the seat of the newly formed Province of Fiume. In this period Fiume lost its commercial hinterland and thus part of its economic potential as it became a border town with little strategic importance for the Kingdom of Italy. However, since it retained the Free Port status and its iconic image in the nation-building myth, it gained many economic concessions and subsidies from the government in Rome. These included a separate tax treatment from the rest of Italy and a continuous inflow of investments from the Italian state (although not as generous as previous Hungarian ones). The city regained a good level of economic prosperity and was much richer than the surrounding Yugoslav lands, but the economic and demographic growth slowed down if compared to the previous Austro-Hungarian period.

===World War II and the German Operational Zone===

At the beginning of World War II Rijeka immediately found itself in an awkward position. The city&#x27;s largest demographic was Italian followed by Croatian constituting most of the remainder, but its immediate surroundings and the city of Sušak, just across the Rječina river (today a part of Rijeka proper) were inhabited almost exclusively by Croatians and part of a potentially hostile power—Yugoslavia. Once the Axis powers invaded Yugoslavia in April 1941, the Croatian areas surrounding the city were occupied by the Italian military, setting the stage for an intense and bloody insurgency which would last until the end of the war. Partisan activity included guerrilla-style attacks on isolated positions or supply columns, sabotage and killings of civilians believed to be connected to the Italian and (later) German authorities. This, in turn, was met by stiff reprisals from the Italian and German military. On 14 July 1942, in reprisal for the killing of four civilians of Italian origin by Partisans, the Italian military killed 100 men from the suburban village of Podhum, resettling the remaining 800 people to concentration camps.

After the surrender of Italy to the Allies in September 1943, Rijeka and the surrounding territories were occupied and annexed by Germany, becoming part of the Adriatic Littoral Zone. Partisan activity continued and intensified. On 30 April 1944, in the nearby village of Lipa, German troops killed 263 civilians in reprisal for the killing of several soldiers during a Partisan attack.

The German and Italian occupiers and their local collaborators deported some 80 percent of the city&#x27;s roughly 500 Jews to Auschwitz. A larger proportion of Rijeka&#x27;s Jewish population was murdered in the Holocaust than that of any other city in Italian territory.

Because of its industries (oil refinery, torpedo factory, shipyards) and its port facilities, the city was also a target of more than 30 Anglo-American air attacks, which caused widespread destruction and hundreds of civilian deaths. Some of the heaviest bombardments happened on 12 January 1944 (attack on the refinery, part of the oil campaign), on 3–6 November 1944, when a series of attacks resulted in at least 125 deaths and between 15 and 25 February 1945 (200 dead, 300 wounded).

The area of Rijeka was heavily fortified even before World War II (the remains of these fortifications can be seen today on the outskirts of the city). This was the fortified border between Italy and Yugoslavia which, at that time, cut across the city area and its surroundings. As Yugoslav troops approached the city in April 1945, one of the fiercest and largest battles in this area of Europe ensued. The 27,000 German and additional Italian RSI troops fought tenaciously from behind these fortifications (renamed &quot;Ingridstellung&quot;—Ingrid Line—by the Germans). Under the command of the German general Ludwig Kübler they inflicted thousands of casualties on the attacking Partisans, which were forced by their superiors to charge uphill against well-fortified positions to the north and east of the city. The Yugoslav commanders did not spare casualties to speed up the capture of the city, fearing a possible English landing in area which would prevent their advance towards Trieste before the war was over. After an extremely bloody battle and heavy losses on the attackers side, the Germans were forced to retreat. Before leaving the city the German troops destroyed much of the harbour area and other important infrastructure with explosive charges. However, the German attempt to break out of the encirclement north-west of the city was unsuccessful. Of the approximately 27,000 German and other troops retreating from the city, 11,000 were killed or executed after surrendering, while the remaining 16,000 were taken as prisoners. Yugoslav troops entered Rijeka on 3 May 1945. The city had suffered extensive damage in the war. The economic infrastructure was almost completely destroyed, and of the 5,400 buildings in the city at the time, 2,890 (53%) were either completely destroyed or damaged.

===Aftermath of World War II===


The city&#x27;s fate was once again solved by a combination of force and diplomacy. Despite insistent requests from the Fiuman government in exile collaboration with the partisans and calls to respect the city-state&#x27;s internationally recognized sovereignty, and despite generous initial promises given by the Yugoslav authorities of full independence and later of extensive autonomy for the city-state (the locals were promised various degrees of autonomy at different moments during the war, most notably the possibility to be a state of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), the city was annexed by Yugoslavia and incorporated as part of the federal state of Croatia. All the many voices of dissent within the population were silenced in the 12 months following the end of the war. The situation created by the Yugoslav forces on the ground was eventually formalized by the 1947 Paris peace treaty between Italy and the Allies on 10 February 1947, despite both the complaints by the last democratically elected government and its president-in-exile Riccardo Zanella and the attempts of the experienced Italian foreign minister Carlo Sforza to uphold the previous Wilsonian plans for a multicultural Free State solution, with a local headquarters for the newly created United Nations. Once the change to Yugoslav sovereignty was formalized, and in particular in the years leading to the Trieste Crisis of 1954, 58,000 of the city&#x27;s 66,000 inhabitants were gradually pushed either to emigrate (they became known in Italian as &quot;esuli&quot; or the &quot;exiled ones&quot; from Istria, Fiume and Dalmatia) or to endure harsh oppression by the new Yugoslav Communist regime. The Yugoslav communist party opted for a markedly Stalinist approach to solving the local ethnic question, in particular after the Autonomist sympathisers gained massive support in the first local elections held on the city&#x27;s territory between 1945 and 1946.

The discrimination and persecution that many inhabitants experienced at the hands of Yugoslav officials, in the last days of World War II and the first years of peace, still remain painful memories for the locals and the &quot;esuli,&quot; and are somewhat of a taboo topic for Rijeka&#x27;s political milieu, which is still largely denying the events. Summary executions of alleged Fascists (often well-known anti-fascists or openly apolitical), aimed at hitting the local intellectual class, the Autonomists, the commercial classes, the former Italian public servants, the military officials and often also ordinary civilians (at least 650 executions of Italians took place after the end of the war) eventually forced most Italophones (of various ethnicities) to leave Rijeka/Fiume in order to avoid becoming victims of a harsher retaliation. The removal was a meticulously planned operation, aimed at convincing the hardly assimilable Italian part of the autochthonous population to leave the country, as testified decades later by representatives of the Yugoslav leadership.
The most notable victims of the political and ethnic repression of locals in this period was the Fiume Autonomists purge hitting all the autonomist figures still living in the city, and now associated in the Liburnian Autonomist Movement. The Autonomists actively helped the Yugoslav partisans in liberating the region from Fascist and Nazi occupation, and, despite receiving various promises of large political autonomy for the city, they were eventually all assassinated by the Yugoslav secret police OZNA in the days leading up to the Yugoslav army&#x27;s victorious march into city and its aftermath.

In subsequent years, the Yugoslav authorities joined the municipalities of Fiume and Sušak and, after 1954, less than one third of the original population of the now united municipalities (mostly what was previously the Croat minority in Fiume and the majority in Sušak) remained in the city, because the old municipality of Fiume lost in these years more than 85% of the original population. The Yugoslav plans for a more obedient demographic situation in RIjeka culminated in 1954 during the Trieste crisis, when the Yugoslav Communist Party rallied many local members to ruin or destroy the most notable vestiges of the Italian/Venetian language and all bilingual inscriptions in the city (which had been legally granted a fully bilingual status after the occupation in 1945), eventually also &#x27;de facto&#x27; (but not &#x27;de jure&#x27;) deleting bilinguilism, except in a handful of selected bilingual schools and inside the Italian Community&#x27;s own building. After the war the local ethnic Italians of Rijeka left Yugoslavia for Italy (Istrian-Dalmatian exodus).

The city was then resettled by immigrants from various parts of Yugoslavia, once more changing heavily the city&#x27;s demographics and its linguistic composition. These years coincided also with a period of general reconstruction and new program of industrialization after the destruction of the war. During the period of the Yugoslav Communist administration between the 1950s and the 1980s, the city became the main port of the Federal Republic and started to grow once again, both demographically and economically, taking advantage of the newly re-established hinterland that had been lacking during the Italian period, as well as the rebuilding after the war of its traditional manufacturing industries, its maritime economy and its port potential. This, paired with its rich commercial history, allowed the city to soon become the second richest (GDP per capita) district within Yugoslavia. However, many of these industries and companies, being based on a socialist planned economic model were not able to survive the move to a market-oriented economy in the early 1990s.

As Yugoslavia broke up in 1991, the former Federal State of Croatia became independent and, in the Croatian War of Independence that ensued, Rijeka became part of the newly independent Croatia. Since then, the city has stagnated economically and its demography has plunged. Some of its largest industries and employers have gone out of business, the most prominent among them being the Jugolinija shipping company, the torpedo factory, the paper mill and many other small or medium manufacturing and commercial companies. Other companies have struggled to remain economically viable (like the city&#x27;s landmark 3. Maj shipyard). The number of people working in manufacturing dropped from more than 80,000 in 1990 to only 5,000 two decades later. Privatization scandals and the large scale corruption which marked Croatia&#x27;s transition from socialism to capitalism as well as several years of war economy played a significant role in the collapse of the city&#x27;s economy during the 1990s and early 2000s. A difficult and uncertain transition of the city&#x27;s economy away from manufacturing and towards an economy based on services and tourism is still in progress.

In 2018, it was announced that, 65 years after the abolition of Italian as the official language of the city, new Croatian-Italian bilingual signs will be placed back in the Fiume part of the modern united municipality.

In 2020, Rijeka was voted the European Capital of Culture alongside Galway, with a planned program including more than 600 events of cultural and social importance.

== Rijeka&#x27;s International Carnival ==

The Rijeka Carnival (Croatian: &quot;Riječki karneval&quot;) is held each year before Lent (between late January and early March) in Rijeka, Croatia. Established in 1982, it has become the biggest carnival in Croatia. Every year there are numerous events preceding the carnival itself. First the mayor of Rijeka gives the symbolic key of the city to Meštar Toni, who is &quot;the maestro&quot; of the carnival, and he becomes the mayor of the city during the carnival, although this is only figuratively. Same day, there is an election of the carnival queen. As all the cities around Rijeka have their own events during the carnival time, Queen and Meštar Toni are attending most of them.

Also, every year the Carnival charity ball is held in the Governor&#x27;s palace in Rijeka. It is attended by politicians, people from sport and media life, as well as a number of ambassadors.

The weekend before the main event there are two other events held. One is Rally Paris–Bakar (after the Dakar Rally). The start is a part of Rijeka called Paris after the restaurant located there, and the end is in city of Bakar, located about south-east. All of the participants of the rally wear masks, and the cars are mostly modified old cars. The other event is the children&#x27;s carnival, held, like the main one, on Rijeka&#x27;s main walkway Korzo. The groups that participate are mostly from kindergartens and elementary schools, including groups from other parts of Croatia and neighboring countries. In 1982 there were only three masked groups on Rijeka&#x27;s main walkway Korzo. In recent years, the international carnival has attracted around 15,000 participants from all over the world organized in over 200 carnival groups, with crowds of over 100,000.

==Demographics==

In the 2021 census, the city proper had a population of 107,964, which included:
Other groups, including Slovenes and Hungarians, formed less than 1% each. The Croatian census recognized two settlements within the City of Rijeka - the city itself with a population of 128,384, and &quot;Bakar&quot; with a population of 240, which is the village of Sveti Kuzam, separate from the neighboring town of Bakar. On 27 February 2014, Rijeka city council passed a decision to annex the settlement (named &quot;Bakar-dio (Sv. Kuzam&quot;)) to the settlement of Rijeka.

There are 34 units of local administration called in Rijeka:

In 1911 the linguistic division of Rijeka was:


The number of Italians in Rijeka decreased drastically following the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus, which occurred from 1943 to 1960.

Boundaries of Rijeka are sometimes extended into the adjoining areas. The former municipality of Rijeka (20th century) consists of other towns and municipalities outside Rijeka city proper, which used to be part of an official union of adjacent settlements that was disbanded in 1995. It includes towns and municipalities of Kastav, Viškovo, Klana, Kostrena, Čavle, Jelenje, Bakar and Kraljevica.

The urban agglomeration of Rijeka includes the former municipality along with the towns and municipalities of Opatija, Lovran, Mošćenička Draga and Matulji.

The metro area of Rijeka is the territory of consolidated expansion. It includes towns and municipalities of Crikvenica, Novi Vinodolski, Vinodolska, Lokve, Fužine, Delnice and Omišalj, which all gravitate towards the City of Rijeka.

The following tables list the city&#x27;s population, along with the population of ex-municipality (disbanded in 1995), the urban and the metropolitan area.

==Main sights==

*Tvornica &quot;Torpedo&quot; (the Torpedo factory). The first European prototypes of a self-propelled torpedo, created by Giovanni Luppis, a retired naval engineer from Rijeka. The remains of this factory still exist, including a well-preserved launch ramp used for testing self-propelled torpedoes on which in 1866 the first torpedo was tested.
*The Croatian National Theatre building. Officially opened in October 1885, the grand theatre building includes work by the famous Venetian sculptor August Benvenuti and ceiling artist Franz Matsch, who collaborated with Ernst and Gustav Klimt.
*&quot;Svetište Majke Božje Trsatske&quot; – the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Trsat. Built above sea level on the Trsat hill during the late Middle Ages, it represents the Guardian of Travellers, especially seamen, who bring offerings to her so she will guard them or help them in time of trouble or illness. It is home to the Gothic sculpture of the Madonna of Slunj and to works by the Baroque painter C. Tasce.
*Trsat Castle, a 13th-century fortress, which offers magnificent vistas from its bastions and ramparts, looking down the Rječina river valley to the docks and the Kvarner Gulf.
*Petar Kružić staircase (or Trsat stairway), which links downtown Rijeka to Trsat. The stairway consists of 561 stone steps and was built for the pilgrims as the way to reach the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Trsat.
*Old gate or Roman arch. At first it was thought that this was a Roman Triumphal Arch built by the Roman Emperor Claudius Gothicus but later it was discovered to be just a portal to the &quot;pretorium&quot;, the army command in late antiquity.
*Rijeka Cathedral, dedicated to St. Vitus.
*Palace Modello designed by Buro Fellner &amp; Helmer and built in 1885.
*Stadion Kantrida, was included on CNN&#x27;s list of the world&#x27;s most iconic and unusual football stadiums in 2011.
*Art installation &quot;Masters&quot;, a site-specific art installation by Czech artist Pavel Mrkus was permanently placed beneath the high ceiling vault on the inner balconies of Rijeka&#x27;s fish market. The installation consists of a video segment - a projection of Mrkus&#x27;s video recorded on the DIMI fishing trawler while fishing in the Kvarnerić waters – and it is accompanied by an audio segment of the sounds of the sea and a fishing boat that can only be heard in the fish market gallery. It is a story that pays homage to those who are never seen here, but without whom there would be no fish on the tables.
*Art installation &quot;Balthazartown Beach&quot;, a site-specific art installation found its place on the Grčevo beach, more commonly known as Pajol or Šestica, located at the very end of Pećine near the Viktor Lenac Shipyard. Under the mentorship of artist Igor Eškinja, students of the Academy of Applied Arts of the University of Rijeka designed a steel sculpture that changes the observer&#x27;s experience of the environment and they created 15 inscriptions on a concrete plateau that encourage everyone to play and are visible only when in contact with water. The artistic process is inspired by the theme of Professor Balthazar, the world-famous and award-winning animated series, in which the scenographer used Rijeka as the primary inspiration in the creation of Balthazartown.

==Climate==
Rijeka has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa by the Köppen climate classification) with warm summers and relatively mild and rainy winters. The terrain configuration, with mountains rising steeply just a few kilometres inland from the shores of the Adriatic, provides for some striking climatic and landscape contrasts within a small geographic area. Beaches can be enjoyed throughout summer in a typically Mediterranean setting along the coastal areas of the city to the east (Pećine, Kostrena) and west (Kantrida, Preluk). At the same time, the ski resort of Platak, located only about from the city, offers alpine skiing and abundant snow during winter months (at times until early May). The Kvarner Bay and its islands are visible from the ski slopes.
Unlike typical mediterranean locations, Rijeka does generally not see a summer drought. Snow is rare (usually three days per year, almost always occurring in patches). There are 20 days a year with a maximum of or higher, while on one day a year the temperature does not exceed . Fog appears in about four days per year, mainly in winter. The climate is also characterized by frequent rainfall. Cold (bora) winds are common in wintertime.



==Transport==


The Port of Rijeka is the largest port in Croatia, with a cargo throughput in 2017 of 12.6 million tonnes, mostly crude oil and refined petroleum products, general cargo and bulk cargo, and 260,337 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). The port is managed by the Port of Rijeka Authority. The first record of a port in Rijeka date back to 1281, and in 1719, the Port of Rijeka was granted a charter as a free port. There are ferry connections between Rijeka and the surrounding islands and cities, but no direct international passenger ship connections. There are coastal lines to Split and onward to Dubrovnik, which operate twice weekly and have international connections.

The city is difficult to get to by air outside of the tourist season. The city&#x27;s own international airport, Rijeka Airport is located on the nearby island of Krk across the Krk Bridge. Buses, with a journey time of approximately 45 minutes, operate from Rijeka city center and nearby Opatija, with a schedule based on the planned arrival and departure times of flights. Handling 200,841 passengers in 2019, the facility is more of a charter airport than a serious transport hub, although various scheduled airlines have begun to service it with a comparatively large number of flights coming from airports in Germany. Most of these flights only operate during the tourist season between approximately May and October. Alternative nearby airports include Pula (around 90 minutes drive from Rijeka), Trieste (around 90 minutes), Ljubljana (around 2 hours), Zagreb (around 2 hours) and Venice (around 3 hours).

Rijeka has efficient road connections to other parts of Croatia and neighbouring countries. The A6 motorway connects Rijeka to Zagreb via the A1, while the A7 motorway, completed in 2004, links Rijeka with Ljubljana, Slovenia, via Ilirska Bistrica and with Trieste, Italy. The A7 acts as the Rijeka bypass motorway and facilitates access to the A8 motorway of the Istrian Y network starting with the Učka Tunnel, and linking Rijeka with Istria. As of August 2011, the bypass is being extended eastwards to the Krk Bridge area and new feeder roads are under construction.

Rijeka is integrated into the Croatian railway network and international rail lines. A fully electrified railway connects Rijeka to Zagreb and beyond towards Koprivnica and the Hungarian border as part of Pan-European corridor Vb. Rijeka is also connected to Trieste and Ljubljana by a separate electrified line that extends northwards from the city. Rijeka has direct connections by daily/night trains to Prague, München, Salzburg, Ljubljana, Bratislava and Brno. Construction of a new high performance railway between Rijeka and Zagreb, extending to Budapest is planned, as well as rail links connecting Rijeka to the island of Krk and between Rijeka and Pula.

=== Bus connections ===
Rijeka Bus Station is connected by regular bus lines with all major Croatian cities such as Zagreb, Osijek, Slavonski Brod, Đakovo, Nova Gradiška, Požega, Vukovar, Gospić, Karlovac, Zadar, Šibenik, Split, Makarska and Dubrovnik. Departures are frequent in the direction of Istria, the islands of Cres, Lošinj, Krk, Rab and Pag and the towns around Crikvenica, Novi Vinodolski and Senj. From international lines, there are regular departures in the direction of Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia.

KD Autotrolej d.o.o. is a carrier of passengers in the area of the City of Rijeka and cities / towns in the suburbs (the so-called Rijeka ring).

==Sports==
The history of Rijeka&#x27;s organised sports started between 1885 and 1888 with the foundation of the Club Alpino Fiumano in 1885, the Young American Cycle Club in 1887 (the first club of this American league to be founded in a foreign land), and the Nautico Sport Club Quarnero in 1888 by the Hungarian minority of the city. Even earlier, in 1873, following the initiative by Robert Whitehead, the first football match to be disputed in today&#x27;s Republic of Croatia territory was played in Rijeka: the Hungarian Railways team and the English engineers-led team of the Stabilimento Tecnico di Fiume (later Torpedo Factory of Fiume). The first football club in Fiume was founded under the name of Fiumei Atletikai Club.

Today, HNK Rijeka is the city&#x27;s main football team, which competes in the Croatian Football League. They were the champions of Croatia in 2016–17. Until July 2015, HNK Rijeka was based at the iconic Stadion Kantrida. With Kantrida awaiting reconstruction, they are based at the newly built Stadion Rujevica, their temporary home in the club&#x27;s new training camp. Additionally, HNK Orijent is based in Sušak and plays in the First Football League (second tier).

Rijeka&#x27;s other notable sports clubs include RK Zamet and ŽRK Zamet (handball), VK Primorje EB (water polo), KK Kvarner (basketball) and ŽOK Rijeka (women&#x27;s volleyball).

Between 1969 and 1990, Rijeka hosted the Yugoslav motorcycle Grand Prix that was part of the Grand Prix motorcycle racing. Rijeka also hosted the 2008 European Short Course Swimming Championships. In over 80 years, LEN had never seen so many records as the number set at &quot;Bazeni Kantrida&quot; (Kantrida Swimming Complex). A total of 14 European records were set, of which 10 were world records, and even 7 were world-best times. This championship also presented a record in the number of participating countries. There were more than 600 top athletes from some 50 European countries. Swimmers from 21 nations won medals, and 40 of the 51 national member Federations of LEN were present in Rijeka.

==In popular culture==
The German western Winnetou movies from the 1960s, based on Karl May novels, were in part filmed on location in the outskirts of Rijeka.

Marvel&#x27;s villain Purple Man originates from this city, and Rijeka has been present in many of the character&#x27;s stories.

The setting of the 1970s cartoon series &quot;Professor Balthazar&quot; was inspired by Rijeka.

The 1980s American TV series &quot;The Winds of War&quot; was in part filmed in Rijeka and the surrounding areas.

A stylised version of Fiume during the 1920s was one of the main settings in the 1992 movie &quot;Porco Rosso&quot; by world acclaimed Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki, as the town in front of which the fantastical &quot;Hotel Adriano&quot; is found and to which it is connected by a boat service taken by the protagonist.

Bruce Sterling&#x27;s November 2016 novel, written in collaboration with Warren Ellis, &quot;Pirate Utopia&quot;, a dieselpunk alternative history, is set in Fiume (now Rijeka) in 1920 during the short-lived Italian Regency of Carnaro.

The TV series &quot;Novine&quot; (&quot;The Paper&quot;), which has been streaming on Netflix since April 2018, is based in Rijeka and the city was used as the main filming location.

In 2019 the movie &quot;The Hitman&#x27;s Wife&#x27;s Bodyguard&quot; with was in part filmed in Rijeka.

Recently Rijeka - with its historic industrial sites, unusual hilly setting, sweeping views and retro architecture - has become a popular location for the filming of TV-advertisements. Examples include advertisements for the Belgian internet provider Telenet, Japanese tire manufacturer Bridgestone, German retail chain DM, Japanese Honda Civic Type R cars, Ukrainian seafood restaurant chain Flagman, Slovenian soft drink brand Cockta, German car manufacturer Mercedes and others.

<text>Centenary University is a private university in Hackettstown, New Jersey, United States. Founded as a preparatory school by the Newark Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1867, Centenary evolved into a Junior College for women and later a coeducational university.

Situated in suburban Warren County, New Jersey, 52 miles west of New York City, 35 miles southeast of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, and 26 miles northeast of Easton, Pennsylvania, the school&#x27;s main campus is identifiable by the Edward W. Seay Administration Building, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
==History==

Centenary University was founded as the Centenary Collegiate Institute (CCI) by what was then known as the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1867. The name was chosen to commemorate the centennial of Methodism in the United States. It was built for $200,000. George H. Whitney, D.D., was president from 1869 to 1895.

Beginning as a coeducational preparatory school, CCI became a girls-only institution in 1910. In 1940, it became a junior college: Centenary Junior College. It would subsequently become Centenary College for Women in 1956 before becoming Centenary College in 1976, a four-year college for women offering associate and bachelor&#x27;s degrees, with men allowed to pursue degrees only during night courses. In 1988, men were allowed to attend full-time. In 1995, master&#x27;s degree programs were introduced. In 2016, Centenary College was granted University status by the New Jersey Secretary of Higher Education.

In 1886, a 19-year-old kitchen worker at CCI named Tillie Smith was &quot;outraged&quot; and murdered in a field just off campus. A janitor at CCI named James Titus was convicted of the crime based on circumstantial evidence strongly influenced by yellow journalism. Authors and historians generally consider this a false conviction, but the debate over the facts continues perennially through dark tourism ghost tours, theatrical performances, books and Weird NJ magazine articles.

On Halloween night, 1899, the original five-story CCI building burned to the ground in a fire. The new building termed &quot;Old Main&quot; (now known as the Seay Building), was designed by architect Oscar Schutte Teale in a Renaissance Beaux Arts style and built on the ruins of the original structure in 1901. Only two buildings survived the fire, the men&#x27;s gymnasium (now the Little Theater of the Seay Building) and the women&#x27;s gymnasium (now the Ferry Building).

In 1957, a student-run college radio station, WNTI, began broadcasting on campus. Eventually becoming an NPR affiliate serving the regional community with an adult album rock format, the FM transmitter was sold to University of Pennsylvania-based WXPN in 2015. As of 2020, a student-run internet radio station operates at WNTI.org.

The Centenary Stage Company, a professional Equity theater, has been operating on campus since 1985. In 1992, a &quot;Women&#x27;s Playwright Series&quot; development program offered grants, workshops, prizes and world premieres for the underserved voice of women in theater. Centenary also offers an intensive musical theater program for intermediate and advanced young performers.

In 1999, Centenary founded the Center for Adult and Professional Studies program. In 2011, the program was renamed the School of Professional Studies.

In 2024 Centenary University and the Ideal Institute of Technology joined forces to offer both vocational training and higher education. This collaboration offers work-based college programs to local residents who may be underserved in their community. 

Additionally, Centenary and The Patrick School (TPS), a private high school known for their nationally ranked basketball program, announced a partnership that relocated TPS to the Hackettstown campus in 2024 with students also having the option to live on campus. TPS alumni include NBA stars Kyrie Irving, Adama Sanogo, and Samuel Dalembert.

<text>Kaiser Motors (formerly [[Kaiser-Frazer]]) Corporation made automobiles at Willow Run, Michigan, United States, from 1945 until 1953. In 1953, Kaiser merged with Willys-Overland to form Willys Motors Incorporated, moving its production operations to the Willys plant at Toledo, Ohio, where the company continued to build automobiles under the Kaiser marque including the Kaiser Darrin until 1955. Their South American operations continued to build passenger cars well up into the 1960s. The company changed its name to Kaiser Jeep Corporation in 1963.

==History==

The Kaiser-Frazer Corporation was established in August 1945 as a joint venture between the Henry J. Kaiser Company and Graham-Paige Motors Corporation. Both Henry J. Kaiser, a California-based industrialist, and Joseph W. Frazer, CEO of Graham-Paige, wanted to get into the automobile business and pooled their resources and talents to do so. Less than a year after Kaiser-Frazer&#x27;s formation, the first Kaiser and Frazer branded automobiles were being produced at the Willow Run, Michigan, headquarters for both Kaiser-Frazer and Graham-Paige. By the end of 1946, over 11,000 cars (total Kaiser and Frazer) were shipped to dealers and distributors, many of which sold to end users. During the summer of 1948, the 300,000th car came off the production line.

In 1950, Kaiser-Frazer began production of a new compact car, the Henry J and ended production of the Frazer automobiles. Both makes were 1951 model year automobiles. In 1952 and 1953, Kaiser-Frazer provided Sears, Roebuck and Company with Allstate-branded automobiles that retailers sold through select Sears Auto Centers. Based on the Henry J models that Kaiser-Frazer dealers were selling, the cars were in the Sears catalog, but the cars could not be purchased by mail order.

At the 1953 New York Auto Show, Kaiser-Frazer announced it would produce a fiberglass-bodied sports car called the &quot;Kaiser-Darrin-Frazer 161&quot;. The car featured a straight six-cylinder engine. It was designed by stylist Howard &quot;Dutch&quot; Darrin, who also did the 1947 and 1948 Kaiser and Frazer as well as the 1951 Kaiser automobiles. The vehicle went into production during January 1954. It was sold as the Kaiser Darrin. Production of the Allstate ended in 1953. The last Henry J automobiles were built in late 1953 as 1954 model year cars. The sports car was in production only during the 1954 model year.

While sales were initially strong because of a car-starved public, the company did not have the resources to survive long-term competition with the &quot;Big Three&quot; domestic automakers. The original Kaiser-Frazer design was distinctive and fresh, but the company could not maintain the price point for long-term success. However, the company&#x27;s problems started as early as 1948. That year, Joseph Frazer resigned as president of Kaiser-Frazer, but stayed in the position as a &quot;lame duck&quot; until April 1949 when Henry J. Kaiser&#x27;s oldest son,Edgar, took Frazer&#x27;s place as president. This was partly because Frazer had warned Kaiser not to tool up to produce 200,000 cars for the 1949 model year, realizing they could not compete against the new cars from the Big Three coming out that year. Kaiser did not heed the warning, saying, &quot;The Kaisers never retrench.&quot; A total of 58,000 cars were sold that year. The Frazer marque was discontinued after the 1951 models. Joseph Frazer remained a sales consultant and vice-chairman of the Kaiser-Frazer board until 1953.

At the 1953 annual stockholders&#x27; meeting, Kaiser-Frazer Corporation&#x27;s name was changed to Kaiser Motors Corporation by stockholder vote. Shortly before the meeting, Kaiser-Frazer&#x27;s Kaiser Manufacturing Corporation division worked out a deal to purchase certain assets (and assume certain liabilities) of the Willys-Overland Corporation, makers of Willys cars and Jeep vehicles. After completing the acquisition, Kaiser Manufacturing Corporation changed its name to Willys Motors, Incorporated. During late 1953 and 1954, Kaiser Motors operations at Willow Run Michigan were closed down or moved to the Willys facility in Toledo, Ohio.

Kaiser-Frazer worked out deals with General Motors to purchase GM Hydramatic automatic transmissions and detuned Rocket 88 engines from Oldsmobile, with deliveries starting in the 1952 model year. The deal was contingent on Olds expanding its Lansing, MI, engine production facility. Still, that expansion was canceled due to military needs for the Korean War. K-F had their own V8 engine development program that ran through 1949 but, as the lead engineers on the team stated to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) they found their work was leading down a &quot;blind alley&quot; and would fail. 

Due to changing market conditions, Frazer cars were not as competitive as luxury and upper-medium priced models. This was similar to the experience of Hudson and Studebaker during the 1950s. The Henry J, while a reasonable idea, was restricted by the terms of a re-capitalization loan the government made to the company in the fall of 1949. Kaiser-Frazer labor agreements resulted in the company paying the highest wages of any American automaker while having a productivity rate of only 60–65% in return. Kaiser tried to resolve its deficiencies with schemes like elaborate designer interiors with upscale dashboards and upholstery. A line of &quot;Traveler&quot; sedans with the trunk connected to the interior of the car was an improvised attempt at marketing a model to compete with the standard station wagon designs.

The last Kaisers were produced in America during the 1955 model year. Close to 760,000 cars were built of all makes and models between May 1946 and September 1955. At the end of 1955, the Henry J. Kaiser Company management team used Kaiser Motors Corporation to create a new holding company encompassing the various Kaiser industrial activities. Kaiser Motors&#x27; name was changed to Kaiser Industries Corporation, and it functioned as a holding company for various Kaiser business holdings, including Willys Motors Incorporated.

While U.S. production of Kaiser and Willys passenger cars ceased in 1955, production of Willys Jeeps in Toledo, Ohio, continued. Kaiser continued automobile production in Argentina under the Industrias Kaiser Argentina (IKA) company established in Santa Isabel, Córdoba and Willys passenger cars moved to Brazil under the Willys-Overland do Brasil company, using the U.S. dies, well into the 1960s.

The company changed its name to Kaiser Jeep in 1963. By 1969, Kaiser Industries decided to leave the auto business, which was sold to American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1970. As part of the transaction, Kaiser acquired a 22% interest in AMC, which it later divested. Included in the sale was the General Products Division, which Kaiser had purchased from Studebaker in 1964 as Studebaker prepared to leave the auto business. AMC renamed the division AM General. The company continues operations and is best known as the manufacturer of the Humvee and civilian Hummer H1.
