<text>Cosmochemistry () or chemical cosmology is the study of the chemical composition of matter in the universe and the processes that led to those compositions. This is done primarily through the study of the chemical composition of meteorites and other physical samples. Given that the asteroid parent bodies of meteorites were some of the first solid material to condense from the early solar nebula, cosmochemists are generally, but not exclusively, concerned with the objects contained within the Solar System.

==History==
In 1938, Swiss mineralogist Victor Goldschmidt and his colleagues compiled a list of what they called &quot;cosmic abundances&quot; based on their analysis of several terrestrial and meteorite samples. Goldschmidt justified the inclusion of meteorite composition data into his table by claiming that terrestrial rocks were subjected to a significant amount of chemical change due to the inherent processes of the Earth and the atmosphere. This meant that studying terrestrial rocks exclusively would not yield an accurate overall picture of the chemical composition of the cosmos. Therefore, Goldschmidt concluded that extraterrestrial material must also be included to produce more accurate and robust data. This research is considered to be the foundation of modern cosmochemistry.

During the 1950s and 1960s, cosmochemistry became more accepted as a science. Harold Urey, widely considered to be one of the fathers of cosmochemistry, engaged in research that eventually led to an understanding of the origin of the elements and the chemical abundance of stars. In 1956, Urey and his colleague, German scientist Hans Suess, published the first table of cosmic abundances to include isotopes based on meteorite analysis.

The continued refinement of analytical instrumentation throughout the 1960s, especially that of mass spectrometry, allowed cosmochemists to perform detailed analyses of the isotopic abundances of elements within meteorites. in 1960, John Reynolds determined, through the analysis of short-lived nuclides within meteorites, that the elements of the Solar System were formed before the Solar System itself which began to establish a timeline of the processes of the early Solar System.

==Meteorites==
Meteorites are one of the most important tools that cosmochemists have for studying the chemical nature of the Solar System. Many meteorites come from material that is as old as the Solar System itself, and thus provide scientists with a record from the early solar nebula. Carbonaceous chondrites are especially primitive; that is they have retained many of their chemical properties since their formation 4.56 billion years ago, and are therefore a major focus of cosmochemical investigations.

The most primitive meteorites also contain a small amount of material (&lt; 0.1%) which is now recognized to be presolar grains that are older than the Solar System itself, and which are derived directly from the remnants of the individual supernovae that supplied the dust from which the Solar System formed. These grains are recognizable from their exotic chemistry which is alien to the Solar System (such as matrixes of graphite, diamond, or silicon carbide). They also often have isotope ratios which are not those of the rest of the Solar System (in particular, the Sun), and which differ from each other, indicating sources in a number of different explosive supernova events. Meteorites also may contain interstellar dust grains, which have collected from non-gaseous elements in the interstellar medium, as one type of composite cosmic dust (&quot;stardust&quot;).

Recent findings by NASA, based on studies of meteorites found on Earth, suggests DNA and RNA components (adenine, guanine and related organic molecules), building blocks for life as we know it, may be formed extraterrestrially in outer space.

==Comets==
On 30 July 2015, scientists reported that upon the first touchdown of the &quot;Philae&quot; lander on comet 67/P surface, measurements by the COSAC and Ptolemy instruments revealed sixteen organic compounds, four of which were seen for the first time on a comet, including acetamide, acetone, methyl isocyanate and propionaldehyde.

==Research==
In 2004, scientists reported detecting the spectral signatures of anthracene and pyrene in the ultraviolet light emitted by the Red Rectangle nebula (no other such complex molecules had ever been found before in outer space). This discovery was considered a confirmation of a hypothesis that as nebulae of the same type as the Red Rectangle approach the ends of their lives, convection currents cause carbon and hydrogen in the nebulae&#x27;s core to get caught in stellar winds, and radiate outward. As they cool, the atoms supposedly bond to each other in various ways and eventually form particles of a million or more atoms. The scientists inferred that since they discovered polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)—which may have been vital in the formation of early life on Earth—in a nebula, by necessity they must originate in nebulae.

In August 2009, NASA scientists identified one of the fundamental chemical building-blocks of life (the amino acid glycine) in a comet for the first time.

In 2010, fullerenes (or &quot;buckyballs&quot;) were detected in nebulae. Fullerenes have been implicated in the origin of life; according to astronomer Letizia Stanghellini, &quot;It&#x27;s possible that buckyballs from outer space provided seeds for life on Earth.&quot;

In August 2011, findings by NASA, based on studies of meteorites found on Earth, suggests DNA and RNA components (adenine, guanine and related organic molecules), building blocks for life as we know it, may be formed extraterrestrially in outer space.

In October 2011, scientists reported that cosmic dust contains complex organic matter (&quot;amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic-aliphatic structure&quot;) that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by stars.

On August 29, 2012, astronomers at Copenhagen University reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, glycolaldehyde, in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the protostellar binary &quot;IRAS 16293-2422&quot;, which is located 400 light years from Earth. Glycolaldehyde is needed to form ribonucleic acid, or RNA, which is similar in function to DNA. This finding suggests that complex organic molecules may form in stellar systems prior to the formation of planets, eventually arriving on young planets early in their formation.

In September 2012, NASA scientists reported that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), subjected to interstellar medium (ISM) conditions, are transformed, through hydrogenation, oxygenation and hydroxylation, to more complex organics—&quot;a step along the path toward amino acids and nucleotides, the raw materials of proteins and DNA, respectively&quot;. Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their spectroscopic signature which could be one of the reasons &quot;for the lack of PAH detection in interstellar ice grains, particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of protoplanetary disks.&quot;

In 2013, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA Project) confirmed that researchers have discovered an important pair of prebiotic molecules in the icy particles in interstellar space (ISM). The chemicals, found in a giant cloud of gas about 25,000 light-years from Earth in ISM, may be a precursor to a key component of DNA and the other may have a role in the formation of an important amino acid. Researchers found a molecule called cyanomethanimine, which produces adenine, one of the four nucleobases that form the &quot;rungs&quot; in the ladder-like structure of DNA. The other molecule, called ethanamine, is thought to play a role in forming alanine, one of the twenty amino acids in the genetic code. Previously, scientists thought such processes took place in the very tenuous gas between the stars. The new discoveries, however, suggest that the chemical formation sequences for these molecules occurred not in gas, but on the surfaces of ice grains in interstellar space. NASA ALMA scientist Anthony Remijan stated that finding these molecules in an interstellar gas cloud means that important building blocks for DNA and amino acids can &#x27;seed&#x27; newly formed planets with the chemical precursors for life.

In January 2014, NASA reported that current studies on the planet Mars by the &quot;Curiosity&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot; rovers will now be searching for evidence of ancient life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic, chemotrophic and/or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable. The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and organic carbon on the planet Mars is now a primary NASA objective.

In February 2014, NASA announced a greatly upgraded database for tracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the universe. According to scientists, more than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated with PAHs, possible starting materials for the formation of life. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets.

<doc id="298449" wikidata="Q2195151" url="?curid=298449" title="Paasikivi–Kekkonen doctrine">
<text>The Paasikivi–Kekkonen doctrine was a foreign policy doctrine established by Finnish President Juho Kusti Paasikivi and continued by his successor Urho Kekkonen, aimed at Finland&#x27;s survival as an independent sovereign, democratic country in the immediate proximity of the Soviet Union.

The principal architect of Finland&#x27;s postwar foreign policy of neutrality was Juho Kusti Paasikivi, who was president from 1946 to 1956. Urho Kekkonen, president from 1956 until 1982, further developed this policy, stressing that Finland should be active rather than passive in its neutrality.

The Paasikivi Society was established in 1958 to promote the doctrine in Finland and abroad. Paasikivi and Kekkonen became Honorary Members of the Society.

== Background ==
Finland and the Soviet Union signed the Paris Peace Treaty in February 1947, which in addition to the concessions of the Moscow Peace Treaty provided for:
* Limiting the size of Finland&#x27;s defense forces,
* Cession to the Soviet Union of the Petsamo area on the Arctic coast,
* Lease of the Porkkala peninsula off Helsinki to the Soviets for use as a naval base for 50 years (it was returned ahead of schedule in 1956),
* Free transit access to this area across Finnish territory, and
* War reparations to the Soviet Union decided to 300 million gold dollars (amounting to an estimated 570 million U.S. dollars in 1952, the year the payments ended).

== Realization ==

In April 1948, Finland signed an Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance with the Soviet Union. Under this mutual assistance pact, Finland was obligated, with the aid of the Soviet Union, if necessary, to resist armed attacks by &quot;Germany or its allies&quot; (i.e., NATO) against Finland or against the Soviet Union &quot;through&quot; Finland. At the same time, the agreement recognized Finland&#x27;s desire to remain outside great-power conflicts. This agreement was renewed for 20 years in 1955, in 1970, and again in 1983. This allowed Finland to retain independence in internal affairs, e.g. a multiparty parliamentary system, and not to join the Eastern Bloc. However, joining NATO or other overt alliance with the West was out of question and foreign policy was often limited.

== Criticism ==
Contemporary Finns often criticized the Paasikivi–Kekkonen doctrine as tending towards a &quot;liturgy&quot; of good relations. Both countries were militarily prepared. However, international trade was active, in the framework of bilateral trade. Furthermore, the policy was heavily tied to the person of President Kekkonen, who consequently exploited his position as a &quot;guarantor of Soviet relations&quot; against political opponents. Outright censorship, official as well as unofficial, was employed for films and other works considered explicitly anti-Soviet, such as &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; or &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot;, although political freedoms were not otherwise coercively limited.

Later criticism has included the following points:
* The Soviet Union did not consider Finland a neutral country, but &quot;striving to be neutral&quot;. Although Kekkonen was largely successful in retaining sovereign power over affairs in Finland, Finland&#x27;s position on international affairs, such as the invasion of Czechoslovakia, was often ambiguous or Soviet-friendly. The 1977 hijacking of a Soviet airliner further exemplifies this; the undue influence of the Soviet ambassador, who would storm a government meeting to make demands, shows that the Finnish government had trouble fending off Soviet interference. The Soviet Union had an unusually large diplomatic mission in Finland, and Kekkonen communicated with the Soviet Union through the KGB station chief rather than by regular diplomatic channels. The Soviets intervened in Finnish politics in various ways, e.g. through the Communist Party of Finland and Soviet-friendly contacts in other parties (e.g. Kekkonen&#x27;s &quot;K-linja&quot; in the Centre Party).
* The Soviet military kept a separate unit in readiness to invade Helsinki from Tallinn in the case of war. The plans, which were fully up-to-date, were left behind in the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Estonia after Estonia regained independence in 1991.
* The policy had little respect in the West. Western foreign policy actors and military personnel either did not know about the policy or assumed it was a failure from the outset. Regarding the former, British military officers were known to have queried how many Soviet troops were in Finland. Regarding the latter, nuclear weapons were trained on targets in Finland, with the assumption that any possible Finnish resistance to a Soviet invasion would be a certain failure.
* There was covert cooperation between the Finnish government and Western intelligence agencies. The CIA could fund the anti-Communist Social Democratic Party, a major, often government-leading party, though it gradually became unusually pro-Soviet beginning in the late 1960s, with many radical leftists holding influential posts among other such parties. There was also military intelligence cooperation, for instance allowing SIGINT flights to probe the Soviet radar network (according to Pekka Visuri) and providing seismic data to detect Soviet nuclear tests.

== Liquidation ==
The Finns responded cautiously in 1990–91 to the decline of Soviet power and the USSR&#x27;s subsequent dissolution. They unilaterally abrogated restrictions imposed by the 1947 and 1948 treaties with the exception of a ban on acquiring nuclear weapons, joined in voicing Nordic concerns over the coup against Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, and gave increasing unofficial encouragement to Baltic independence.

At the same time, by replacing the Soviet-Finnish mutual assistance pact with treaties on general cooperation and trade, Finns put themselves on an equal footing while retaining a friendly bilateral relationship. Finland subsequently boosted cross-border commercial ties and touted its potential as a commercial gateway to Russia. It had reassured Russia that it would not raise claims about the formerly Finnish territory ceded after the Continuation War (though a small but vocal minority of people disagree), and continued to reaffirm the importance of good bilateral relations until Russia–EU relations became increasingly strained due to the Russo-Ukrainian War. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the policy of neutrality was permanently abandoned. On 18 April 2022, Prime Minister Sanna Marin, with the support of both governing and opposition parties, announced a bid to join NATO which resulted in Finland&#x27;s entry to the bloc on 4 April 2023.

<text>A ria (; , feminine noun derived from &quot;río&quot;, river) is a coastal inlet formed by the partial submergence of an unglaciated river valley. It is a drowned river valley that remains open to the sea.

==Definitions==

Typically rias have a dendritic, treelike outline although they can be straight and without significant branches. This pattern is inherited from the dendritic drainage pattern of the flooded river valley. The drowning of river valleys along a stretch of coast and formation of rias results in an extremely irregular and indented coastline. Often, there are naturally occurring islands, which are summits of partly submerged, pre-existing hill peaks. (Islands may also be artificial, such as those constructed for the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel.)

A ria coast is a coastline having several parallel rias separated by prominent ridges, extending a distance inland. The sea level change that caused the submergence of a river valley may be either eustatic (where global sea levels rise), or isostatic (where the local land sinks). The result is often a very large estuary at the mouth of a relatively insignificant river (or else sediments would quickly fill the ria). The Kingsbridge Estuary in Devon, England, is an extreme example of a ria forming an estuary disproportionate to the size of its river; no significant river flows into it at all, only a number of small streams.

The word &quot;&quot; comes from Galician &quot;&quot; which comes from río (river). Rias are present all along the Galician coast in Spain. As originally defined, the term was restricted to drowned river valleys cut parallel to the structure of the country rock that was at right angles to the coastline. However the definition of ria was later expanded to other flooded river valleys regardless of the structure of the country rock.

For a time European geomorphologists considered rias to include any broad estuarine river mouth, including fjords. These are long narrow inlets with steep sides or cliffs, created in a valley carved by glacial activity. In the 21st century, however, the preferred usage of &quot;ria&quot; by geologists and geomorphologists is to refer solely to drowned unglaciated river valleys. It therefore excludes fjords by definition, since fjords are products of glaciation.

* Ireland: Bantry Bay, on the southwest coast of Ireland, is an example of an Irish ria.
* Wales: Milford Haven Waterway in Pembrokeshire is a ria.
* England: The south coast of England is a submergent coastline which contains many rias, including Southampton Water, Poole Harbour, the estuary of the River Medina on the Isle of Wight, the estuaries of the Exe, Teign and Dart, then Kingsbridge Estuary, Plymouth Sound in Devon, and the estuaries of the River Fowey, River Fal and Helford River in Cornwall. On the north coast is the River Camel and the River Taw. In Essex are the River Blackwater and River Crouch.
* Italy: The Fiordo di Furore on the Amalfi Coast in Campania is a ria, despite its name.
* Malta: Grand Harbour and Marsamxett Harbour
* Croatia: Porto Quieto, Lim, Raša, Novsko Ždrilo, Karinsko Ždrilo, Zrmanja, Krka, Morinje, Ploče, Ston, Slano, Zaton.
* Montenegro: The Bay of Kotor
* Turkey: Bosporus, Golden Horn.

===Africa===
* Kenya: Kilindini Harbour, which is a deep channel between Mombasa island and South Coast mainland, is a ria.

===Asia===

* Sanriku Coast: North Japan, east coast of Honshū Island (main island). Sendai city, Miyagi Prefecture and Iwate Prefecture are included.
* Ago Coast in Shima (Mie Prefecture) is a Ria coast, well known for its pearls.
* Seto Inland Sea, separating Honshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku.
* Coasts on western, southern sides of the Korean Peninsula: Rias formed by sea level rising after Ice Age.
* The Chinese east coast, from the Guangdong province (Hong Kong coastlines included) to Shanghai.
* The Musandam Peninsula in Oman, comprising the southern shore of the Strait of Hormuz.

===Oceania===

* Papua New Guinea: Rias formed by eroded volcanic lava flow are found all around the town of Tufi at Cape Nelson, in Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Oro Province.
* Australia: The east coast of Australia features several rias around Sydney, including Georges River, Port Hacking, Broken Bay, and Port Jackson, which includes Sydney Harbour. Further away from Sydney, Port Stephens and the Clyde River estuary are also rias. There are many examples in Western Australia, including the Swan River around Perth and several rivers in the west Kimberley region.
* New Zealand: Rias of various scales abound on the eastern shores of the upper North Island. On the west coast, in contrast, they are fewer but larger. Kaipara Harbour is the country&#x27;s largest, and the Hokianga Harbour, further north, is of historical significance to the native Māori people. The Marlborough Sounds at the northern tip of the South Island form a large network of rias.
* Hawaiʻi: Pearl Harbor on Oʻahu is a ria, with the branches of West Loch, Middle Loch, East Loch, and Southeast Loch formed by the submerged drainages of Waikele, Waiau, Waimalu, and Hālawa streams respectively.

===North America===
* United States: Narragansett Bay, New York Harbor, Delaware Bay, Indian River Bay, the Chesapeake Bay, Albemarle Sound and Pamlico Sound, and Charleston Harbor are rias on the East Coast. Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor in Washington and San Francisco Bay in California on the West Coast are also rias.
* Canada: Charlottetown Harbour, Prince Edward Island

===South America===
* Argentina: Patagonia has the Deseado ria, on the coast of Santa Cruz Province, on the Atlantic Ocean. Also, the &quot;bay&quot; that is Bahía Blanca is a ría.

==Consequences==
The funnel-like shape of rias can amplify the effects of tsunamis, as demonstrated in the seismicity of the Sanriku coast, most recently in the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

<text>The Eurasian curlew or common curlew (Numenius arquata) is a very large wader in the family Scolopacidae. It is one of the most widespread of the curlews, breeding across temperate Europe and Asia. In Europe, this species is often referred to just as the &quot;curlew&quot;, and in Scotland known as the &quot;whaup&quot; in Scots.

==Taxonomy==
The Eurasian curlew was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Scolopax arquata&quot;. It is now placed with eight other curlews in the genus &quot;Numenius&quot; that was introduced by the French ornithologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The genus name &quot;Numenius&quot; is from Ancient Greek νουμήνιος, &quot;noumēnios&quot;, a bird mentioned by Hesychius. It is associated with the curlew because it appears to be derived from &quot;neos&quot;, &quot;new&quot; and &quot;mene&quot; &quot;moon&quot;, referring to the crescent-shaped bill. The species name &quot;arquata&quot; is the Medieval Latin name for this bird, derived from Latin &quot;arcuatus&quot;, &quot;bow-shaped&quot;, and again referring to the shape of the bill.

The English name &quot;curlew&quot; is imitative of the Eurasian curlew&#x27;s call, but may have been influenced by the Old French &quot;corliu&quot;, &quot;messenger&quot;, from &quot;courir &quot;, &quot;to run&quot;. It was first recorded in 1377 in Langland&#x27;s Piers Plowman &quot;Fissch to lyue in þe flode..Þe corlue by kynde of þe eyre&quot;.

Three subspecies are recognised:

* &quot;N. a. arquata&quot;, – breeds in west, north &amp; central Europe
* &quot;N. a. orientalis&quot;, – breeds in west &amp; central Siberia through to Northeast China
* &quot;N. a. suschkini&quot;, – breeds from western Kazakhstan to southwestern Siberia

==Description==
The Eurasian curlew is the largest wader in its range, at in length, with an wingspan and a body weight of . It is mainly greyish brown, with a white back, greyish-blue legs and a very long curved bill. Males and females look identical, but the bill is longest in the adult female. It is generally not possible to recognize the sex of a single Eurasian curlew, or even several ones, as there is much variation; telling male and female of a mated pair apart is usually possible however. The familiar call is a loud &quot;curloo-oo&quot;.

The only similar species over most of the curlew&#x27;s range is the Eurasian whimbrel (&quot;Numenius phaeopus&quot;). The whimbrel is smaller and has a shorter bill with a kink rather than a smooth curve. Flying curlews may also resemble bar-tailed godwits (&quot;Limosa lapponica&quot;) in their winter plumages; however, the latter have a smaller body, a slightly upturned beak, and legs that do not reach far beyond their tail tips. The Eurasian curlew&#x27;s feet are longer, forming a conspicuous &quot;point&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The curlew exists as a migratory species over most of its range, wintering in Africa, southern Europe and south Asia. Occasionally a vagrant individual reaches places far from its normal range, such as Nova Scotia and the Marianas. It is present all year in the milder climates of Ireland and the United Kingdom and its adjacent European coasts.

Reclamation and drainage of marshy fields and moorland, and afforestation of the latter, have led to local decreases, while conversion of forest to grassland in some parts of Scandinavia has led to increases there.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The Eurasian curlew is generally wary. It is highly gregarious outside the breeding season.

===Breeding===
The nest is a bare scrape in meadow or similar habitats. The clutch size of the curlew consists of four eggs which are laid in April or May, and both adults incubate them for four weeks until they begin to hatch. It has been observed that curlews tend to nest close to common kestrels&#x27; nests, as they can offer protection from other predators, such as corvids, even though kestrels also prey on curlew nests.
===Food and feeding===
The Eurasian curlew feeds by probing soft mud for small invertebrates, but will also pick small crabs and earthworms from the surface if the opportunity arises.

=== Predation ===
Eurasian curlews eggs are preyed on by foxes and predatory birds. In addition sheep have been recorded by the BBC nature series Springwatch preying on the eggs.

==Status==
The Eurasian curlew was formerly listed as a species of Least Concern by the IUCN, owing to its expansive range and relatively large population. However, the population of the Eurasian curlew was noticed to be declining at a very rapid rate. Following the evaluation of its population trend, the classification was found to be outdated, and it was consequently promoted to Near Threatened status in 2008. Though it is a common bird, its numbers are noticeably declining, particularly in the United Kingdom and Ireland, which have about a quarter of the global population. In the twenty years up to 2016, the population is estimated to have declined by more than 50% in England and Scotland, more than 80% in Wales, and more than 90% in Ireland. At the end of 2015 it was placed on the United Kingdom&#x27;s red list of most endangered bird species. The curlew is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

Research by scientists at the British Trust for Ornithology suggests that curlew populations in the UK have been negatively affected in areas with high levels of arable farming and afforestation which have reduced its natural habitats of open grasslands.

<text>Miramare Castle (; ; ; ) is a 19th-century castle direct on the Gulf of Trieste between Barcola and Grignano in Trieste, northeastern Italy. It was built from 1856 to 1860 for Austrian Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian and his wife, Charlotte of Belgium, later Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico and Empress Carlota of Mexico, based on a design by Carl Junker.

The castle&#x27;s grounds include an extensive cliff and seashore park of designed by the archduke. The grounds were completely re-landscaped to feature numerous tropical species of trees and plants.

==History==

===Miramare Castle===

Miramare Castle and its park were built by order of Ferdinand Maximilian (1832–1867), of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. In 1850, at the age of eighteen, Ferdinand Maximilian - younger brother of Franz Joseph, Emperor of Austria - came to Trieste with his own younger brother, Archduke Charles. Immediately afterwards he set off on a short cruise in the eastern Mediterranean.
This journey confirmed him in his intention to sail and to get to know the world. In 1852 he was appointed an officer and in 1854 he became Commander in Chief of the Imperial Austrian Navy. He decided to move to Trieste and to have a home built facing the sea and surrounded by a park worthy of his name and rank.

According to tradition, when the archduke was caught in a sudden storm in the Gulf, he took shelter in the little harbour of Grignano and chose a bare rocky spur of limestone origin as the setting for his home. The whole complex, purchased for the first time at the beginning of March 1856, was called &quot;Miramar&quot;, possibly after the name of Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Koháry&#x27;s residence in Pena, Portugal. 

Designed in 1856 by Carl Junker, an Austrian architect, the architectural structure of Miramare was finished in 1860. The style reflects the artistic interests of the archduke, who was acquainted with the eclectic architectural styles of Austria, Germany and England. The craftsman Franz Hofmann and his son, , were entrusted with the furnishing and decorations. Hofmann, who worked in the city of Trieste, was a skilful artisan who was willing to follow Maximilian’s suggestions. Both the artisan and his patron had a similar cultural formation and they were well acquainted with the eclectic tendencies of the time.

The work, steadily supervised by Maximilian, was finished only after his departure in 1864 for Mexico; where after a brief reign as Emperor he was executed in June 1867. Maximilian intended to create an intimate atmosphere in the castle in the area reserved for his family – an area which he wanted to be in contact with nature, reflecting both his own spirit and that of an epoch.
On the ground floor, destined for the use of Maximilian and his wife, Charlotte of Belgium, worthy of note are the bedroom and the archduke&#x27;s office, which reproduce the cabin and the stern wardroom respectively of the frigate &quot;Novara&quot;, the warship used by Maximilian as Commander of the Navy, and which circumnavigated the world between 1857 and 1859; the library, whose walls are lined with bookshelves; and the rooms of the Archduchess with their tapestry of light-blue silk. All the rooms still feature the original furnishings, ornaments, furniture and objects dating back to the middle of the 19th century. Many coats of arms of the Second Mexican Empire decorate the castle, as well as stone ornamentations on the exterior depicting the Aztec eagle.

The first floor includes guest-reception areas and the Throne Room. Of note are the magnificent panelling on the ceiling and walls and the Chinese and Japanese drawing-rooms with their oriental furnishings. Of particular interest is the room decorated with paintings by Cesare Dell&#x27;Acqua (1821-1905), portraying events in the life of Maximilian and the history of Miramare.
Currently, the rooms in the castle are mostly arranged according to the original layout decided upon by the royal couple. A valuable photographic reportage commissioned by the archduke himself made accurate reconstruction possible.

===Castelletto===
After having been commissioned as an officer in the Imperial navy in 1852, Maximilian decided to move to Trieste where he stayed for increasingly longer and more frequent periods. He rented a villa on the slopes of the hill of &quot;San Vito&quot; from &quot;Niccolò Marco Lazarovich&quot; with a clause in the contract that allowed him to make all the modifications he considered necessary. Subsequently, during the completion of Miramare Castle, the archduke had a small castle called the Gartenhaus or &quot;Castelletto&quot; built which reproduced on a smaller scale the façade of the main castle and which he lived in off and on until Christmas 1860.

The &quot;Castelletto&quot;, situated in a panoramic area, faces Grignano on one side and on the other a parterre surrounded by trees and on a clearing in front of greenhouses at the centre of which there is a fountain. Modelled on eclectic forms on a square base with a terrace facing the castle, the tower and the arbour entrance, the Castelletto has a small number of simply furnished rooms. On the ground floor there is a decoration on plaster painted to resemble wood. On the first floor, on the other hand there is a decoration very similar to the one in &quot;Villa Lazarovich&quot; which can be connected to Maximilian’s decision to transfer to the &quot;Castelletto&quot; his own part of the ornaments of the Villa which was his first residence in Trieste. In fact, the rooms in Turkish and German styles and the room decorated with panels of female figures present strong parallels between the two buildings and highlight the artistic tendencies of the time: numerous decorations, walls covered in paintings, many ornaments, heavy curtains and rooms crowded with furniture.

The Castelletto is linked to the history of Maximilian and Charlotte. It was here that Charlotte stayed from the end of 1866 to the summer of 1867, between her return from Mexico and journeying to Belgium. It also housed part of the furnishings of Miramare Castle during the period when the Duke of Aosta stayed there.

===Miramare Park===
Miramare Park, which at one time had no vegetation, and has now a surface area of , stands on a rocky promontory overlooking the Adriatic Sea. The site was planned and arranged by Carl Junker,
according to the wishes of Archduke Maximilian who carefully followed the building of his residence. As far as the botanical aspect was concerned, a gardener, Josef Laube, was called in but was replaced in 1859 by Anton Jelinek, a Bohemian who had taken part in the frigate &quot;Novara&quot;&#x27;s expedition around the world.

The park, on which work began in 1856, represents a classic example of a mixed, artificial implantation of ligneous forest-trees and bushes and it succeeds in blending the charm of a typically Northern environment and a Mediterranean context. In contrast to the Baroque garden, the English one – on which Miramare is modelled – introduces a new relationship with nature, resulting from a different sensibility towards the material world. This is why, when strolling along the paths in the park, you can breathe in an atmosphere that is tightly bound up with the life of its owner and his romantic relationship with nature, which was typical of his epoch.


Before 1856, the park area was bare, with only some shrubs and thorny bushes. Today, on the other hand, there is a group of different species of trees that are, for the most part, of non-European origin or in any case, that are not native to the area. Within a period of ten years, cedars of Lebanon, North Africa and the Himalayas were planted, along with firs and spruces from Spain, cypresses from California and Mexico, various species of pine from Asia and America, to which some exotic specimens, such as the giant sequoia and the ginkgo biloba, were added. Miramare was conceived as a private garden and not as a park.
In fact it does not have a monumental entrance or a driveway up to the castle. It was a garden of wonders, not intended for public use, even though the archduke opened it to the public a few days per week. Watercourses, pools, twisting paths, trees placed according to natural models, some grassy areas, are typical of English gardens. The roughness of the ground favoured the irregular lay-out of the promontory, combining the artificial transformation with the natural environment.

The park is also characterised by the presence of some buildings included in Junker’s project: the &quot;Castelletto&quot; – inhabited off and on by Maximilian and Charlotte – on which work began at the same time as work on the castle; the greenhouses, intended for the growing
of the plants to be placed in the park; the ruins of the chapel dedicated to &quot;Saint Canciano&quot;, in whose apse is preserved a cross made from the wood of the frigate &quot;Novara&quot;, which was laid up in 1899; and lastly a little house, used nowadays as a coffee-shop, the &quot;&quot;Swiss house&quot;, placed at the edge of the swans’ lake.

Until 1954, Miramare was used as the headquarters for German, New Zealand, British and American forces of occupation respectively. Finally in 1955, the complex was reopened to the public under the name Miramare Park, whose management was entrusted to the &quot;Sopraintendenza per i Beni Architettonici ed il Paesaggio e per il Patrimonio Storico, Artistico ed Etnoantropologico&quot; of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region.

Today the gardens play host during the summer season to spectacles such as the musical &quot;Sissi&quot;&quot;, reliving the story of the Empire in its natural setting, and various concerts.

===Miramare Castle’s stables===

Maximilian commissioned the plan for Miramare Castle’s stables, the design of which was undertaken between 1856 and 1860 by the architect Carl Junker. He had already planned all the works to be done in the area of Miramare: the castle, the park and all its access paths, the &quot;Castelletto&quot;, the &quot;Porticciolo&quot; (&#x27;little port&#x27;), the conservatories, the Swiss house and the pavilion at the back of the parterre.

Junker’s sketches set out the planning of the stable’s building, both in its totality and in each part devoted to a specific use.

The building is made up of three parts surrounding a central yard opened to the sea. It is located on the road leading to Trieste, in a sheltered, healthy place at a distance from the castle. It is square. The central section was intended for horses: Junker’s sketches including the location of the animal stalls, lining the bottom perimeter. The two wings, perfectly symmetrical, are sub-divided into three parts: near the stables box-rooms for harness; then accommodations for the staff and, finally, the kitchens, near the sea. The great pavilion at the back was reserved for coaches. Its access on the west side is made up of two main doors (one probably the entrance, the other the exit).

Between the two World Wars, when the castle was inhabited by the Dukes of Aosta, changes were made to the stables.

===Miramare after 1867===


After the death of Maximilian I in Mexico in June 1867 and Charlotte’s departure for Belgium, the castle and the park continued to be a place where the Habsburgs spent short periods.

Already in September 1882 the Emperor Franz Joseph with Empress Elisabeth and the heir to the throne Rudolf with his consort Stéphanie of Belgium, stayed in Miramare during an official visit to Trieste and gave receptions for the notables of the city. In August 1885 the Archduchess Stéphanie stayed there for a few days. Between 1869 and 1896, the Empress Elisabeth is recorded as having stayed there on at least fourteen occasions. On March 22, 1900, Stéphanie of Belgium – Charlotte’s niece and Rudolf’s widow – chose the chapel of the castle for her second marriage to the Hungarian noble Elemér de Lónyay. From March 9 to April 11, 1914, the heir to the throne Archduke Franz Ferdinand lived in the castle with his wife and sons and gave hospitality to the German Emperor William; two months later the archduke was assassinated at Sarajevo. Worthy of note is also the visit of the last Emperor Charles and his wife Zita.

During the First World War all the furniture and works of art belonging to the castle were moved to Vienna and stored in the Schönbrunn and Belvedere Palaces and in the court libraries. At the end of the war the whole territory of Miramare passed under the direct control of the Italian government. Between October 1925 and March 1926, by mutual consent of the two governments, Austria returned all the furnishings in order to make possible the reconstruction of the castle’s original interior. The restoration of the furnishings and rooms, under the direction of the Royal Superintendence, meant that the museum could be opened to the public on March 24, 1929.

Two years later the government assigned Miramare to Duke Amedeo of Aosta, captain of the first air division stationed in Gorizia, who lived there continuously till 1937 when he was appointed viceroy of Ethiopia. The castle was also inhabited off and on by the Duke’s family until the middle of 1943.

Nonetheless, visitors were allowed access to the upper part of the park and, from 1931, to the &quot;Castelletto&quot;, furnished with Archduke Maximilian’s fittings which had not formed part of the Duke of Aosta’s furnishings. Afterwards the castle was used as a school for officers by the German troops who occupied the city. As a result of the opposition of the Gauleiter Friedrich Rainer to the conversion of the castle into Nazi headquarters, the building was saved from possible bombardment. In the meantime, the furnishings had been removed and were kept in various buildings in the city.

At the end of 1945, the New Zealand troops under the command of the General Freyberg entered Trieste and settled in the castle, making many changes to the interior. The British troops followed, and set up the headquarters of XIII Corps in Miramare. Finally the Americans came and the castle served as headquarters for the American garrison Trieste United States Troops (TRUST) from 1947 to October 3, 1954. The Superintendence immediately began the work of restoration of the interior of the castle and the &quot;Castelletto&quot; and the layout of the park. On the basis of drawings and period photographs, wood decorations were restored in the rooms and furniture, furnishings, pictures and tapestries were rearranged.

Finally, in March 1955, the park was reopened free of charge to the public and from June 2 of the same year, Maximilian’s residence was named the Historical Museum of Miramare Castle and entrusted to the &quot;Sopraintendenza per i Beni Architettonici ed il Paesaggio e per il Patrimonio Storico, Artistico ed Etnoantropologico&quot; of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region. Over the years it has become an attraction for thousands of tourists interested in experiencing full immersion in one of the very few examples of European historical residences which have preserved almost entirely their original furnishings and which, still today, transmit the charm of living around the middle of the Nineteenth century.

==Museum==

Visitors to the castle will be able to see the following: Maximilian&#x27;s chambers and those of his consort, Charlotte; the guest rooms; the information room telling the history of the castle and the park&#x27;s construction; the Duke Amedeo of Aosta&#x27;s apartment with furnishings from the 1930s in the Rationalist style. All the rooms still feature the original furnishings, ornaments, furniture and objects dating back to the middle of the 19th century. Particularly noteworthy are the music room where Charlotte used to play the fortepiano, now on show in room VII. In room XIX there are a series of paintings by Cesare dell&#x27;Acqua depicting the history of Miramare. Lastly, visitors may visit the throne room, which was recently restored to its former splendour.

<doc id="298474" wikidata="Q18858" url="?curid=298474" title="Eurasian whimbrel">
<text>The Eurasian or common whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), also known as the white-rumped whimbrel in North America, is a wader in the large family Scolopacidae. It is one of the most widespread of the curlews, breeding across much of subarctic Asia and Europe as far south as Scotland. This species and the Hudsonian whimbrel have recently been split, although some taxonomic authorities still consider them to be conspecific.

==Taxonomy==
The Eurasian whimbrel was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Scolopax phaeopus&quot;. It is now placed with the curlews in the genus &quot;Numenius&quot; that was introduced by the French ornithologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The genus name &quot;Numenius&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;noumenios&quot;, a bird mentioned by Hesychius. It is associated with the curlews because it appears to be derived from &quot;neos&quot;, &quot;new&quot; and &quot;mene&quot; &quot;moon&quot;, referring to the crescent-shaped bill. The specific epithet &quot;phaeopus&quot; is the Medieval Latin name for the bird, from Ancient Greek &quot;phaios&quot;, &quot;dusky&quot; and &quot;pous&quot;, &quot;foot&quot;. The English name &quot;whimbrel&quot; is imitative of the bird&#x27;s call.

Five subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;N. p. islandicus&quot; Brehm, C.L., 1831 – breeds mainly in Iceland, but also in Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and Scotland; winters mainly in West Africa, but ranges from southwestern Europe to Benin and Togo
* &quot;N. p. phaeopus&quot; (European whimbrel) (Linnaeus, 1758) – nominate, breeds from Norway to north central Siberia; winters in Africa and south and southeast Asia
* &quot;N. p. alboaxillaris&quot; Lowe, 1921 – breeds from western Kazakhstan to southwestern Siberia (rare, endangered); winters in south and east Asia
* &quot;N. p. rogachevae&quot; Tomkovich, 2008 – breeds in north central Siberia; winters in east Africa and west India
* &quot;N. p. variegatus&quot; (Scopoli, 1786) – breeds in northeastern Siberia; winters in India to Australia

The Hudsonian curlew (&quot;Numenius hudsonicus&quot;) was formerly considered to be conspecific. The two species were split based on genetic and plumage differences.

==Differences in species==
The common whimbrel was traditionally considered a sub-cosmopolitan bird, breeding in Russia and Canada, then migrating to coasts all around the world to spend the winter. However the North American population of whimbrels was considered distinct enough to be considered a separate species from the common whimbrel. In 2020, the New World population was recognised as a separate species, with the whimbrel in North America being assigned to the binomial name &quot;Numenius hudsonicus&quot;.

Whilst very similar at an initial glance, there are several features that distinguish whimbrel species in the Old and New World. In appearance, the New World species has a more “faded” appearance, with differences in the supercilium and crown. By far the most significant difference may be seen in the lower half of the bird. Whimbrels in Europe and Asia have a primarily white rump that can be seen in flight, while whimbrel in the New World have a rump similar in colour to the rest of the bird - drab brown with dark streaking. As a result, whimbrel on vagrancy trips to North America may be known as the “white-rumped whimbrel”, while whimbrel vagrants from North America to Europe may be known as “Hudsonian whimbrel”.

When the context of their location is known, both species may be simply known as the whimbrel.

== Description ==
The Eurasian whimbrel is a fairly large wader, though mid-sized as a member of the curlew genus. It is in length, in wingspan, and in weight. It is mainly greyish brown, with a white back and rump (subspecies &quot;N. p. phaeopus&quot; and &quot;N. p. alboaxillaris&quot; only), and a long curved beak with a kink rather than a smooth curve. The usual call is a rippling whistle, prolonged into a trill for the song. The only similar common species over most of this bird&#x27;s range are larger curlews. The whimbrel is smaller, has a shorter, decurved bill and has a central crown stripe and strong supercilia.

==Distribution and migration==
The whimbrel is a migratory bird wintering on coasts in Africa, and South Asia into Australasia. It is also a coastal bird during migration. It is fairly gregarious outside the breeding season. It is found in Ireland and the United Kingdom, and it breeds in Scotland, particularly around Shetland, Orkney, the Outer Hebrides as well as the mainland at Sutherland and Caithness.

==Behaviour and ecology ==
===Breeding===
The nest is a bare scrape on tundra or Arctic moorland. Three to five eggs are laid. Adults are very defensive of nesting area and will even attack humans who come too close.

===Food and feeding===
This species feeds by probing soft mud for small invertebrates and by picking small crabs and similar prey off the surface. Before migration, berries become an important part of their diet. It has also been observed taking insects, specifically blue tiger butterflies

==Conservation==
The whimbrel is listed in the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot;. Near the end of the 19th century, hunting on the Eurasian whimbrel&#x27;s migration routes took a heavy toll on its population, which has since recovered. It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List and has been negatively impacted by climate change, habitat destruction and outbreaks of Avian flu to which it is susceptible.

The whimbrel and the Hudsonian curlew are considered to be conspecific.

<text>Baybayin (,) or Sulat Tagalog (), 
also called Basahan () by Bicolanos,
sometimes erroneously referred to as alibata, is a Philippine script widely used primarily in Luzon during the 16th and 17th centuries and prior to write Tagalog and to a lesser extent Visayan languages, Kampampangan, Ilocano, and several other Philippine languages.

Baybayin is an abugida belonging to the family of the Brahmic scripts. Its use was gradually replaced by the Latin alphabet during Spanish rule, though it has seen limited modern usage in the Philippines.
The script is encoded in Unicode as Tagalog block since 1998 alongside Buhid, Hanunoo, and Tagbanwa scripts.
The Archives of the University of Santo Tomas in Manila holds the largest collection of extant writings using Baybayin.

Baybayin has seen increasing modern usage in the Philippines. Today, Baybayin is often used for cultural and aesthetic purposes, such as in art, graduation regalia, tattoos, and logos. It is also featured on the logos of government agencies, Philippine banknotes, and passports. Additionally, there are educational initiatives and workshops aimed at teaching Baybayin to a new generation. Social media has also been instrumental in the increased awareness and interest in Baybayin. Artists, educators, and enthusiasts use these platforms to share tutorials, artworks, and historical facts about the script, sparking interest among younger generations. Bills to recognize the script and revive its use alongside the Latin alphabet have been repeatedly considered by the Congress.

==Terminology==
The term means &quot;to write&quot; or &quot;to spell&quot; in Tagalog. The earliest known use of the word to refer to the script was from the &quot;Vocabulario de la lengua tagala&quot; (1613) by Pedro San Buenaventura as . The word &quot;basahan&quot; was already recorded in a book entitled Vocabulario de la Lengua Bicol by Marcos de Lisboa in 1628, which states it has three vowels and fifteen consonants.
Baybayin is also used colloquially as an umbrella term for the indigenous scripts in the Philippines. However, this has since been discouraged by linguists, who prefer to use the term &quot;suyat&quot; to refer to these pre-Hispanic scripts as a whole.

Historically, the term &quot;alibata&quot; was used synonymously with Baybayin. &quot;Alibata&quot; is a neologism first coined in 1914, possibly under the false assumption that the script was derived from the Arabic script, hence the name. Most modern scholars reject the use of the word &quot;alibata&quot; as incorrect.

==Origins==
The origins of are disputed and multiple theories exist as to its origin.

===Influence of Greater India===

Historically Southeast Asia was under the influence of Ancient India, where numerous Indianized principalities and empires flourished for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam. The influence of Indian culture into these areas was given the term &quot;Indianization&quot;. French archaeologist George Coedes defined it as the expansion of an organized culture that was framed upon Indian originations of royalty, Hinduism and Buddhism and the Sanskrit language. This can be seen in the Indianization of Southeast Asia, Hinduism in Southeast Asia and the spread of Buddhism in Southeast Asia. Indian honorifics also influenced the Malay, Thai, Filipino and Indonesian honorifics. Examples of these include raja, rani, maharlika, and datu, which were transmitted from Indian culture to Philippines via Malays and the Srivijaya empire. Indian Hindu colonists played a key role as professionals, traders, priests and warriors. Inscriptions have proved that the earliest Indian colonists who settled in Champa and the Malay Archipelago, came from the Pallava dynasty, as they brought with them their Pallava script. The earliest inscriptions in Java exactly match the Pallava script. In the first stage of adoption of Indian scripts, inscriptions were made locally in Indian languages. In the second stage, the scripts were used to write the local Southeast Asian languages. In the third stage, local varieties of the scripts were developed. By the 8th century, the scripts had diverged and separated into regional scripts.

Isaac Taylor sought to show that was introduced into the Philippines from the Coast of Bengal sometime before the 8th century. In attempting to show such a relationship, Taylor presented graphic representations of Kistna and Assam letters like g, k, ng, t, m, h, and u, which resemble the same letters in . Fletcher Gardner argued that the Philippine scripts have &quot;very great similarity&quot; with the Brahmi script, which was supported by T. H. Pardo de Tavera. According to Christopher Miller, evidence seems strong for to be ultimately of Gujarati origin; however, Philippine and Gujarati languages have final consonants, so it is unlikely that their indication would have been dropped had been based directly on a Gujarati model.

==== Kawi ====

The Kawi script originated in Java, descending from the Pallava script, and was used across much of Maritime Southeast Asia. The Laguna Copperplate Inscription is the earliest known written document found in the Philippines. It is a legal document with the inscribed date of Saka era 822, corresponding to 21 April 900 AD. It was written in the Kawi script in a variety of Old Malay containing numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin is ambiguous between Old Javanese and Old Tagalog. A second example of Kawi script can be seen on the Butuan Ivory Seal, found in the 1970s and dated between the 9th and 12th century. It is an ancient seal made of ivory that was found in an archaeological site in Butuan. The seal has been declared as a national cultural treasure. The seal is inscribed with the word &quot;Butwan&quot; in stylized Kawi. The ivory seal is now housed at the National Museum of the Philippines. One hypothesis therefore reasons that, since Kawi is the earliest attestation of writing in the Philippines, then may have descended from Kawi.

==== South Sulawesi scripts ====
David Diringer, accepting the view that the scripts of the Malay Archipelago originate in India, writes that the South Sulawesi scripts derive from the Kawi script, probably through the medium of the Batak script of Sumatra. The Philippine scripts, according to Diringer, were possibly brought to the Philippines through the Buginese characters in Sulawesi. According to Scott, &#x27;s immediate ancestor was very likely a South Sulawesi script, probably Old Makassar or a close ancestor. This is because of the lack of final consonants or vowel canceler markers in . South Sulawesi languages have a restricted inventory of syllable-final consonants and do not represent them in the Bugis and Makassar scripts. The most likely explanation for the absence of final consonant markers in is therefore that its direct ancestor was a South Sulawesi script. Sulawesi lies directly to the south of the Philippines and there is evidence of trade routes between the two. must therefore have been developed in the Philippines in the fifteenth century CE as the Bugis-Makassar script was developed in South Sulawesi no earlier than 1400 CE.

==== Cham script ====

 could have been introduced to the Philippines by maritime connections with the Champa Kingdom. Geoff Wade has argued that the characters &quot;ga&quot;, &quot;nga&quot;, &quot;pa&quot;, &quot;ma&quot;, &quot;ya&quot; and &quot;sa&quot; display characteristics that can be best explained by linking them to the Cham script, rather than other Indic abugidas. According to Wade, seems to be more related to other southeast Asian scripts than to Kawi script. Wade argues that the Laguna Copperplate Inscription is not definitive proof for a Kawi origin of , as the inscription displays final consonants, which does not.

==History==
From the material that is available, it is clear that was used in Luzon, Palawan, Mindoro, Pangasinan, Ilocos, Panay, Leyte and Iloilo, but there is no proof supporting that reached Mindanao. It appears that the Luzon and Palawan varieties started to develop in different ways in the 1500s, before the Spaniards conquered what we know today as the Philippines. This puts Luzon and Palawan as the oldest regions where was and is used. It is also notable that the script used in Pampanga had already developed special shapes for four letters by the early 1600s, different from the ones used elsewhere. There were three somewhat distinct varieties of in the late 1500s and 1600s, though they could not be described as three different scripts any more than the different styles of Latin script across medieval or modern Europe with their slightly different sets of letters and spelling systems.

===Early history===
An earthenware burial jar, called the &quot;Calatagan Pot,&quot; found in Batangas is inscribed with characters strikingly similar to , and is claimed to have been inscribed ca. 1300 AD. However, its authenticity has not yet been proven.

Although one of Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s shipmates, Antonio Pigafetta, wrote that the people of the Visayas were not literate in 1521, the had already arrived there by 1567 when Miguel López de Legazpi reported from Cebu that, &quot;They [the Visayans] have their letters and characters like those of the Malays, from whom they learned them; they write them on bamboo bark and palm leaves with a pointed tool, but never is any ancient writing found among them nor word of their origin and arrival in these islands, their customs and rites being preserved by traditions handed down from father to son without any other record.&quot; A century later, in 1668, Francisco Alcina wrote: &quot;The characters of these natives [Visayans], or, better said, those that have been in use for a few years in these parts, an art which was communicated to them from the Tagalogs, and the latter learned it from the Borneans who came from the great island of Borneo to Manila, with whom they have considerable traffic... From these Borneans the Tagalogs learned their characters, and from them the Visayans, so they call them Moro characters or letters because the Moros taught them... [the Visayans] learned [the Moros&#x27;] letters, which many use today, and the women much more than the men, which they write and read more readily than the latter.&quot; Francisco de Santa Inés explained in 1676 why writing was more common among women, as &quot;they do not have any other way to while away the time, for it is not customary for little girls to go to school as boys do, they make better use of their characters than men, and they use them in things of devotion, and in other things that are not of devotion.&quot;

The earliest printed book in a Philippine language, featuring both Tagalog in and transliterated into the Latin script, is the 1593 &quot;Doctrina Christiana en Lengua Española y Tagala&quot;. The Tagalog text was based mainly on a manuscript written by Fr. Juan de Placencia. Friars Domingo de Nieva and Juan de San Pedro Martyr supervised the preparation and printing of the book, which was carried out by an unnamed Chinese artisan. This is the earliest example of that exists today and it is the only example from the 1500s. There is also a series of legal documents containing , preserved in Spanish and Philippine archives that span more than a century: the three oldest, all in the Archivo General de Indias in Seville, are from 1591 and 1599.

 was noted by the Spanish priest Pedro Chirino in 1604 and Antonio de Morga in 1609 to be known by most Filipinos, and was generally used for personal writings and poetry, among others. However, according to William Henry Scott, there were some datus from the 1590s who could not sign affidavits or oaths, and witnesses who could not sign land deeds in the 1620s.

In 1620, &quot;Libro a naisurátan amin ti bagás ti Doctrina Cristiana&quot; was written by Fr. Francisco Lopez, an &quot;Ilocano Doctrina&quot; the first Ilocano baybayin, based on the catechism written by Cardinal Bellarmine. This is an important moment in the history of , because the krus-kudlít was introduced for the first time, which allowed writing final consonants. He commented the following on his decision: &quot;The reason for putting the text of the Doctrina in Tagalog type... has been to begin the correction of the said Tagalog script, which, as it is, is so defective and confused (because of not having any method until now for expressing final consonants - I mean, those without vowels) that the most learned reader has to stop and ponder over many words to decide on the pronunciation which the writer intended.&quot; This krus-kudlít, or virama kudlít, did not catch on among users, however. Native experts were consulted about the new invention and were asked to adopt it and use it in all their writings. After praising the invention and showing gratitude for it, they decided that it could not be accepted into their writing because &quot;It went against the intrinsic properties and nature that God had given their writing and that to use it was tantamount to destroy with one blow all the Syntax, Prosody and Orthography of their Tagalog language.&quot;

In 1703, was reported to still be in use in the &quot;Comintan&quot; (Batangas and Laguna) and other areas of the Philippines.

Among the earliest literature on the orthography of Visayan languages were those of Jesuit priest Ezguerra with his in 1747 and of Mentrida with his in 1818 which primarily discussed grammatical structure. Based on the differing sources spanning centuries, the documented syllabaries also differed in form. 

The Ticao stone inscription, also known as the Monreal stone or Rizal stone, is a limestone tablet that contains characters. Found by pupils of Rizal Elementary School on Ticao Island in Monreal town, Masbate, which had scraped the mud off their shoes and slippers on two irregular shaped limestone tablets before entering their classroom, they are now housed at a section of the National Museum of the Philippines, which weighs 30 kilos, is 11 centimeters thick, 54 cm long and 44 cm wide while the other is 6 cm thick, 20 cm long and 18 cm wide.

===Usage===
Historically, baybayin was used in Tagalog- and to a lesser extent Kapampangan-speaking areas. It spread to the Ilocanos when the Spanish distributed bibles written in baybayin. Pedro Chirino, a Spanish priest and Antonio de Morga noted in 1604 and 1609 that most Filipino men and women could read baybayin. It was also noted that they did not write books or keep records, but did use baybayin for signing documents, for personal notes and messages, and for poetry. During the colonial period, Filipinos began keeping paper records of their property and financial transactions, and would write down lessons they were taught in church. Documents written in the native language and began to play a significant role in the judicial and legal life of the colony.

Traditionally, baybayin was written upon palm leaves with a sharp stylus or on bamboo with a small knife. The curved shape of the letter forms of is influenced by this practice; curved lines straight lines would have torn the leaves. Once the letters were carved into the bamboo, it was wiped with ash to make the characters stand out.

During the era of Spanish colonization, baybayin came to be written with ink on paper using a sharpened quill. Woodblock printed books were produced to facilitate the spread of Christianity. In some parts of the country, such as Mindoro the traditional writing technique has been retained.

===Decline===
Baybayin fell out of use in much of the Philippines under Spanish rule. Learning the Latin alphabet also helped Filipinos to make socioeconomic progress, as they could rise to relatively prestigious positions such as clerks, scribes and secretaries. In 1745, Sebastián de Totanés wrote in his &quot;Arte de la lengua tagala&quot; that &quot;The Indian [Filipino] who knows how to read baybayin is now rare, and rarer still is one who knows how to write [it]. They now all read and write in our Castilian [ie Latin] letters.&quot; Between 1751 and 1754, Juan José Delgado wrote that &quot;the [native] men devoted themselves to the use of our [Latin] writing&quot;. The ambiguity of vowels i/e and o/u, the lack of syllable-final consonants and of letters for some Spanish sounds may also have contributed to the decline of baybayin.

The rarity of pre-Hispanic baybayin texts has led to a common misconception that fanatical Spanish priests must have destroyed the majority native documents. Anthropologist and historian H. Otley Beyer wrote in &quot;The Philippines before Magellan&quot; (1921) that, &quot;one Spanish priest in Southern Luzon boasted of having destroyed more than three hundred scrolls written in the native character&quot;. In fact, historians have been unable to verify Beyer&#x27;s claim, and there is no direct evidence of substantial destruction of documents by Spanish missionaries. Hector Santos has suggested although that Spanish friars may have occasionally burned short documents such as incantations, curses and spells (deemed evil by the church) but rejected the idea that there was any systematic destruction of pre-Hispanic manuscripts. Morrow also notes that there are no recorded instances of pre-Hispanic Filipinos writing on scrolls, and that the most likely reason why no pre-Hispanic documents survived is because they wrote on perishable materials such as leaves and bamboo. There are also no reports of Tagalog written scriptures, as the Filipinos kept their theological knowledge in oral form while using the Baybayin for secular purposes and talismans.

The scholar Isaac Donoso claims that the documents written in the native language and in native scripts played a significant role in the judicial and legal life of the colony and noted that many colonial-era documents written in baybayin still exist in some repositories, including the library of the University of Santo Tomas. He also noted that the early Spanish missionaries did not suppress the usage of the baybayin script but instead may have even promoted it as a measure to stop Islamization, since the Tagalog language was moving from baybayin to Jawi, the Arabized script of Islamized Southeast Asian societies. Paul Morrow also suggests that Spanish friars helped to preserve baybayin by continuing its use even after it had been abandoned by most Filipinos.

==Characteristics==

 is an abugida (alphasyllabary), which means that it makes use of consonant-vowel combinations. Each character or &quot;titik&quot;, written in its basic form, is a consonant ending with the vowel /a/. To produce consonants ending with other vowel sounds, a mark called a &quot;kudlít&quot; is placed either above the character to change the /a/ to an /e/ or /i/, or below for an /o/ or /u/. To write words beginning with a vowel, one of the three independent vowels (a, i/e, o/u). A third kudlít, , called a &quot;sabat&quot; or &quot;krus&quot;, a &quot;virama&quot; removes a consonant&#x27;s inherent &quot;a&quot; vowel, making it an independent consonant. The krus-kudlít virama was added to the original script by the Spanish priest Francisco Lopez in 1620. Later, the pamudpod virama , which has the same function, was added. Beside these phonetic considerations, the script is monocameral and does not use letter case for distinguishing proper names or words starting sentences.



=== Punctuation and spacing ===
 originally used only one punctuation mark (), which was called &quot;Bantasán&quot;. Today uses two punctuation marks, the Philippine single () punctuation, acting as a comma or verse splitter in poetry, and the double punctuation (), acting as a period or end of paragraph. These punctuation marks are similar to single and double danda signs in other Indic Abugidas and may be presented vertically like Indic dandas, or slanted like forward slashes. The signs are unified across Philippines scripts and were encoded by Unicode in the Hanunóo script block. Space separation of words was historically not used as words were written in a continuous flow, but is common today.

=== Alphabetical order ===
In the &quot;Doctrina Christiana&quot;, the letters were ordered without any connection with other similar scripts, except sorting vowels before consonants as:
:&lt;br&gt;a, u/o, i/e; ha, pa, ka, sa, la, ta, na, ba, ma, ga, da/ra, ya, nga, wa.
In Unicode the letters are ordered in a similar way to other Indic scripts, by phonetic class.
: &lt;br&gt;a, i/e, o/u; ka, ga, nga; ta, da, na; pa, ba, ma; ya, ra, la, wa, sa, ha.

===Way of writing===

According to Scott, when e.g. the sign for ba has to be read as be / bi it has a &quot;kaldit&quot; (a small &quot;v&quot; shaped diacritic sign) on the left (or above), if it has to be read as bu / bo the kaldit is on the right (resp. below). The ancient characters of Tagalog and Camarines people had its own character for /r/, in contrast to more common modern Baybayin version and Ilokano Kurdita. In his time the kaldit was called or according to Marcos de Lisboa, author of the earliest dictionary of Bikol.

According to Lisboa, the writing of the old Bikolnons started from the bottom up, writing to the right. However, some scholars such as Ignacio Villamor who have studied the &#x27;basahan&#x27; of pre-Hispanic Filipinos strongly emphasize that they all wrote the scriptures in a straight line starting from left to right, then returning on the left at the beginning, keep writing right.

==Contemporary usage and revival==
A number of legislative bills have been proposed periodically aiming to promote the writing system, among them is the &quot;National Writing System Act&quot; (House Bill 1022/Senate Bill 433).

There are attempts of modernizing Baybayin such as adding letters like R, C, V, Z, F, Q, and X that are not originally on the script in order to make writing modern Filipino words easier such as the word Zambales and other provinces and towns in the Philippines that have Spanish origins.

Baybayin was used in the most current New Generation Currency series of the Philippine peso issued in the last quarter of 2010. The word used on the bills was &quot;Pilipino&quot; ().

It is also used in Philippine passports, specifically the latest e-passport edition issued 11 August 2009 onwards. The odd pages of pages 3–43 have &quot; (&quot;/&quot;Righteousness exalts a nation&quot;) in reference to Proverbs 14:34.

==Derivative scripts==

Bayabin&#x27;s modern descendant scripts surviving modern script are the Tagbanwa script, also known as known as &quot;ibalnan&quot; by the Palawan people, who have adopted it, the Buhid script and the Hanunóo script of Mindoro. The modern Kulitan script is a unique script that employs consonant stacking and is derived from Old Kapampangan, the precolonial Indic script used to write the Kapampangan language, and reformed in recent decades.

<doc id="298486" wikidata="Q733252" url="?curid=298486" title="Barrage balloon">
<text>A barrage balloon is a type of airborne barrage, a large uncrewed tethered balloon used to defend ground targets against aircraft attack, by raising aloft steel cables which pose a severe risk of collision with hostile aircraft, making the attacker&#x27;s approach difficult and hazardous. Early barrage balloons were often spherical. The kite balloon, having a shape and cable bridling that stabilizes the balloon and reduces drag, could be operated at higher wind speeds than a spherical balloon. Some examples carried small explosive charges that would be pulled up against the aircraft to ensure its destruction. Barrage balloons are not practical at higher altitudes due in large part to the cable&#x27;s weight. 

==First World War==
France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom used barrage balloons in the First World War. While the French and German forces developed kite balloons, early British barrage balloons were spherical.

Sometimes, especially around London, several balloons were used to lift a &quot;barrage net&quot; length: a steel cable was strung between the balloons, and more cables hung from it. These nets could be raised to an altitude comparable to the operational ceiling () of the bombers of the time. By 1918 the barrage balloon defences around London stretched for , and captured German pilots expressed great fear of them.

==Second World War==
In 1938, the British Balloon Command was established to protect cities and key targets such as industrial areas, ports, and harbors. Balloons were intended to defend against dive bombers flying at heights up to , forcing them to fly higher and into the range of concentrated anti-aircraft fire: anti-aircraft guns could not traverse fast enough to attack aircraft flying at low altitude and high speed. By the middle of 1940, there were 1,400 balloons, a third over the London area.

While dive-bombing was a devastatingly effective tactic against undefended targets, such as Guernica and Rotterdam, dive-bombers were very vulnerable to attack by fighter aircraft when pulling up after having completed a bombing dive. Due to the effectiveness of the Royal Air Force fighters&#x27; tactic of waiting for a dive bomber to complete its dive and then pouncing when it was pulling up - a moment when it was slow and vulnerable - the use of dive bombers against the UK was discontinued by Nazi Germany. Balloons proved to be of little use against the German high-level bombers with which the dive-bombers were replaced, but continued to be manufactured nonetheless until there were almost 3,000 in 1944. They proved to be effective against the V-1 flying bomb, which usually flew at or lower but had wire-cutters on its wings to counter balloons. 231 V-1s are officially claimed to have been destroyed by balloons.

The British added two refinements to their balloons, &quot;Double Parachute Link&quot; (DPL) and &quot;Double Parachute/Ripping&quot; (DP/R). The former was triggered by the shock of an enemy bomber snagging the cable, causing that section of cable to be explosively released complete with parachutes at either end; the combined weight and drag bringing down the aircraft. The latter was intended to render the balloon safe if it broke free accidentally. The heavy mooring cable would separate as the balloon and fall to the ground under a parachute; at the same time a panel would be ripped away from the balloon causing it to deflate and fall independently to the ground.

The 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion, a Very Low Altitude barrage balloon battalion of the United States Army, participated in the June 1944 Normandy landings, raising barrage balloons on Omaha Beach and Utah Beach. They remained stationed at Normandy until October 1944.

In January 1945, during Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm raids on the Palembang oil refineries, the British aircrews were surprised by the massive use of barrage balloons in the Japanese defences. These were spherical and smaller than the British type. One Grumman Avenger was destroyed, and its crew killed, from striking a balloon cable.

Barrage balloons were partly filled with highly flammable hydrogen. &quot;The top of the balloon was filled with hydrogen, the bottom half was left empty, so when it was put up at a certain height it filled with natural air&quot;, according to Dorothy Brannan, barrage balloon volunteer in Portsmouth, England.

===Power line disruption===
In 1942, Canadian and American forces began joint operations to protect the sensitive locks and shipping channel at Sault Ste. Marie along their common border among the Great Lakes against possible air attack. During severe storms in August and October 1942 some barrage balloons broke loose, and the trailing cables short-circuited power lines, causing some localised disruption to mining and manufacturing. In particular, metals production was disrupted. Canadian military historical records indicate that one of the more serious incidents, known as &quot;The October Incident&quot;, caused an estimated loss of 400 tonnes of steel and 10 tonnes of ferro-alloys. 

As a result, balloons were stored during the winter months and training was improved. Lessons learned from breakaway balloons led to Operation Outward, intentional release of balloons trailing conductive cables to disrupt power supplies on the occupied European mainland.

=== Target identification ===
On the road to Aachen in west Germany in 1944, the British 2nd Tactical Air Force floated barrage balloons along the American First Army sector front line (a.k.a. &quot;bomb line&quot;) to designate the location of friendly troops during the air assault preceding the advance of ground forces, which took Aachen on October 21, 1944. Conversely, during the First Army advance past Aachen to nearby Düren, barrage balloons were floated eastward to mark the location of enemy troops to be bombed.

==Post-war nuclear weapon tests==
After the war, some surplus barrage balloons were used as tethered shot balloons for nuclear weapon tests throughout most of the period when nuclear weapons were tested in the atmosphere. The weapon or &quot;shot&quot; was carried to the required altitude slung underneath the barrage balloon, allowing test shots in controlled conditions at much higher altitudes than test towers. Several of the tests in the Operation Plumbbob series were lifted to altitude using barrage balloons.

<text>Thomas James Churchill (March 10, 1824 – May 14, 1905) was an American soldier and politician who served as the 13th governor of Arkansas from 1881 to 1883. Before that, he was a senior officer of the Confederate States Army who commanded infantry in the Western and Trans-Mississippi theaters of the American Civil War.

Elected as part of the Redeemers coalition that restored former Confederates to office after Radical Republicans were overthrown across the South, Churchill&#x27;s gubernatorial tenure was largely derailed by a financial scandal stemming from his tenure as treasurer. 

==Early life and education==
Thomas James Churchill was born near Louisville, Kentucky. He graduated from St. Mary&#x27;s College in Bardstown in 1844, then studied law at Transylvania University in Lexington. He served during the Mexican–American War, rising to the rank of first lieutenant in the 1st Kentucky Cavalry Regiment. The Mexican Army captured Churchill, who remained a prisoner of war until near the war&#x27;s end. In 1848, Churchill moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, married the daughter of United States Senator Ambrose H. Sevier, and became a planter. Appointed by President James Buchanan, he was a postmaster from September 1857 to March 1861.

His nephew would use part of the family estate at Spring Grove, Kentucky, to construct Churchill Downs.

==American Civil War==

At the start of the American Civil War, Churchill joined the Confederate States Army cavalry as a colonel of the 1st Arkansas Mounted Rifles. His first combat took place at the Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek near Springfield, Missouri. On March 4, 1862, he was promoted to brigadier-general and fought at the Siege of Corinth and soon thereafter took part in the Confederate Heartland Offensive. Churchill played an important role in the Battle of Richmond, commanding a division of men from Texas and Arkansas. Leading his division along a ravine that became known as &quot;Churchill&#x27;s Draw&quot;, he delivered a successful and surprising flanking attack. On February 17, 1864, Churchill was cited as one of three officers to receive special recognition in a Thanks of Confederate States Congress resolution for his actions at Richmond.

During the latter part of 1862, Churchill was transferred back to Arkansas and placed in charge of the fortifications at Arkansas Post. In January 1863, the Post was attacked and seized in the Battle of Arkansas Post by an overwhelming United States Army force under U.S. Maj. Gen. John Alexander McClernand. After his exchange, Churchill served for a brief time in the Army of Tennessee before once again being sent west of the Mississippi, where he continued his service in the Trans-Mississippi Department, commanding a division during the Red River Campaign. He played a significant role in the Battle of Jenkins&#x27; Ferry and was promoted to major-general on March 17, 1865.

==Later life==
Churchill was elected Treasurer of Arkansas in 1873. He was subsequently re-elected in 1875, 1877, and 1879. During the Brooks–Baxter War of 1874, Churchill supported Elisha Baxter and helped enroll volunteers in Baxter&#x27;s militia. Elected governor of Arkansas in 1880, Churchill served until 1883. While governor, he was plagued by allegations of discrepancies in the treasurer&#x27;s account from when he served as state treasurer. A special committee found a shortage of $294,876 ($ in today&#x27;s dollars) in state funds during Churchill&#x27;s tenure as treasurer.

A lawsuit was brought against him, and he was ordered to repay the missing funds. The scandal drew widespread opprobrium, even from the partisan press, and tarnished the image of the Redeemers in Arkansas, who ostensibly were elected to clean up the scandal-ridden Radical Republican state government that had been installed during Reconstruction.

Churchill died in Little Rock and was buried in historic Mount Holly Cemetery with military honors.

<text>Hyderabad State () was a princely state in the Deccan region of south-central India with its capital at the city of Hyderabad. It is now divided into the present-day state of Telangana, the Kalyana-Karnataka region of Karnataka, and the Marathwada region of Maharashtra in India.

The state was ruled from 1724 to 1948 by the Nizam, who was initially a viceroy of the Mughal empire in the Deccan. Hyderabad gradually became the first princely state to come under British paramountcy signing a subsidiary alliance agreement. During the British rule in 1901, the state had a revenue of 4,17,00,000. The native inhabitants of Hyderabad State, regardless of ethnic origin, are called &quot;Mulki&quot; (countryman), a term still used today.

The dynasty declared itself an independent monarchy during the final years of the British Raj. After the Partition of India, Hyderabad signed a standstill agreement with the new dominion of India, continuing all previous arrangements except for the stationing of Indian troops in the state. Hyderabad&#x27;s location in the middle of the Indian Union, as well as its diverse cultural heritage led to India&#x27;s annexation of the state in 1948. Subsequently, Mir Osman Ali Khan, the seventh Nizam, signed an instrument of accession, joining India.

===Early history===
Hyderabad State was founded by Mir Qamar-ud-din Khan who was the governor of Deccan under the Mughals from 1713 to 1721. In 1724, he resumed rule from the Mughal provincial capital of Aurangabad, under the title of &quot;Asaf Jah&quot; (granted by Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah). His other title, &quot;Nizam ul-Mulk&quot; (Order of the Realm), became the title of his position &quot;Nizam of Hyderabad&quot;. By the end of his rule, the Nizam had become independent from the Mughals, and had founded the Asaf Jahi dynasty.

Following the decline of the Mughal power, the region of Deccan saw the rise of the Maratha Empire. The Nizam himself saw many invasions by the Marathas in the 1720s, which resulted in the Nizam paying a regular &quot;Chauth&quot; (tax) to the Marathas. The major battles fought between the Marathas and the Nizam include Palkhed, Rakshasbhuvan, and Kharda. Following the conquest of Deccan by Bajirao I and the imposition of &quot;Chauth&quot; by him, Nizam remained a tributary of the Marathas for all intent and purposes.

In 1763, the Nizam shifted the capital to the city of Hyderabad. From 1778, a British resident and soldiers were installed in his dominions. In 1795, the Nizam lost some of his territories to the Marathas. The territorial gains of the Nizam from Mysore as an ally of the British were ceded to the British to meet the cost of maintaining the British soldiers.

===British suzerainty===

In 1768, the Nizam signed the &quot;Treaty of Masulipatam&quot; ceding the Northern Circars to British. Later in 1779, the Nizams along with Marathas and Hyder Ali Mysore came together and formed an alliance against the British. This resulted in British defeating the alliance and subsequently Nizam in 1788 had to cede Guntur to British. Subsequently the Nizams had to sign various treaties, the most important of this was the signing of Treaty of Subsidiary Alliance under which Nizams had ceded most of the power to the British. Gradually the entire coastal areas were lost to the British and Hyderabad became a landlocked kingdom.
In 1798, Nizam ʿĀlī Khan (Asaf ) was forced to enter into an agreement that put Hyderabad under British protection. He was the first Indian prince to sign such an agreement. (Consequently, the ruler of Hyderabad rated a 23-gun salute during the period of British India.) The Crown retained the right to intervene in case of misrule.

Hyderabad under Asaf Jah II was a British ally in the second and third Maratha Wars (1803–05, 1817–19), Anglo-Mysore wars, and would remain loyal to the British during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (1857–58).

His son, Asaf Jah III Mir Akbar Ali Khan (known as &quot;Sikandar Jah&quot;) ruled from 1803 to 1829. During his rule, a British cantonment was built in Hyderabad and the area was named in his honour, Secunderabad. The British Residency at Koti was also built during his reign by the then British Resident James Achilles Kirkpatrick.

Sikander Jah was succeeded by Asaf Jah IV, who ruled from 1829 to 1857 and was succeeded by his son Asaf Jah V.

==== Asaf Jah V ====
Asaf Jah V&#x27;s reign from 1857 to 1869 was marked by reforms by his Prime Minister Salar Jung I. Before this time, there was no regular or systematic form of administration, and the duties were in the hands of the &quot;Diwan&quot; (Prime Minister), and corruption was thus widespread.

In 1867, the State was divided into five divisions and seventeen districts, and subedars (governors) were appointed for the five Divisions and &quot;talukdars&quot; and &quot;tehsildars&quot; for the districts. The judicial, public works, medical, educational, municipal, and police departments were re-organised. In 1868, &quot;sadr-i-mahrams&quot; (Assistant Ministers) were appointed for the Judicial, Revenue, Police, and Miscellaneous Departments.

Later on, Asaf Jah VI succeeded the position.

==== Asaf Jah VI ====
Asaf Jah VI Mir Mahbub Ali Khan became the Nizam at the age of three years. His regents were Salar Jung I and Shams-ul-Umra III and later on Asman Jah and Viqar-ul-Umra. He assumed full rule at the age of 17 and ruled until he died in 1911. His reign saw the official language of Hyderabad State shift from Persian to Urdu, a change implemented in the 1880s during the short tenure of Prime Minister Salar Jung II.

The Nizam&#x27;s Guaranteed State Railway was established during his reign to connect Hyderabad State to the rest of British India. It was headquartered at Secunderabad Railway Station. The railway marked the beginning of industry in Hyderabad, and factories were built in Hyderabad city.

During his rule, the Great Musi Flood of 1908 struck the city of Hyderabad, which killed an estimated 50,000 people. The Nizam opened all his palaces for public asylum.

He also abolished Sati where women used to jump into their husband&#x27;s burning pyre, by issuing a royal firman.

==== Asaf Jah VII ====
The last Nizam of Hyderabad Mir Osman Ali Khan ruled the state from 1911 until 1948. He was given the title &quot;Faithful Ally of the British Empire&quot;.

The Nizam also established Hyderabad State Bank. Hyderabad was the only independent state in Indian subcontinent that had its currency, the Hyderabadi rupee. The Begumpet Airport was established in the 1930s with formation of Hyderabad Aero Club by the Nizam. Initially, it was used as a domestic and international airport for Nizam&#x27;s Deccan Airways, the earliest airline in British India. The terminal building was created in 1937.

To prevent another great flood, the Nizam also constructed two lakes, namely the Osman Sagar and Himayath Sagar. The Osmania General Hospital, Jubilee Hall, State Library (then known as &quot;Asifia Kutubkhana&quot;) and Public Gardens (then known as &quot;Bagh e Aam&quot;) were constructed during this period.

===After Indian Independence (1947–1948)===

In 1947 India gained independence and Pakistan came into existence. The British left the local rulers of the princely states the choice of whether to join one or the other or to remain independent. On 11 June 1947, the Nizam issued a declaration to the effect that he had decided not to participate in the Constituent Assembly of either Pakistan or India.

However, the Nizams were Muslim ruling over a predominantly Hindu population.
India insisted that the great majority of residents wanted to join India.

The Nizam was in a weak position as his army numbered only 24,000 men, of whom only some 6,000 were fully trained and equipped.

On 21 August 1948, the Secretary-General of the Hyderabad Department of External Affairs requested the President of the United Nations Security Council, under Article 35(2) of the United Nations Charter, to consider the &quot;grave dispute, which, unless settled by international law and justice, is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security&quot;.

On 4 September the Prime Minister of Hyderabad Mir Laiq Ali announced to the Hyderabad Assembly that a delegation was about to leave for Lake Success, headed by Moin Nawaz Jung. The Nizam also appealed, without success, to the British Labour Government and to the King for assistance, to fulfil their obligations and promises to Hyderabad by &quot;immediate intervention&quot;. Hyderabad only had the support of Winston Churchill and the British Conservatives.

At 4 a.m. on 13 September 1948, India&#x27;s Hyderabad Campaign, code-named &quot;Operation Polo&quot; by the Indian Army, began. Indian troops invaded Hyderabad from all points of the compass. On 13 September 1948, the Secretary-General of the Hyderabad Department of External Affairs in a cablegram informed the United Nations Security Council that Hyderabad was being invaded by Indian forces and that hostilities had broken out. The Security Council took notice of it on 16 September in Paris. The representative of Hyderabad called for immediate action by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. The Hyderabad representative responded to India&#x27;s excuse for the intervention by pointing out that the Stand-still Agreement between the two countries had expressly provided that nothing in it should give India the right to send in troops to assist in the maintenance of internal order.

At 5 p.m. on 17 September, the Nizam&#x27;s army surrendered. The Government of Hyderabad resigned, and military governors and chief ministers were appointed by the Nizam at India&#x27;s direction.

On 26 January 1950, India formally incorporated the state of Hyderabad into the Union of India and ended the rule of the Nizams.

=== Hyderabad State (1948–1956) ===

After the incorporation of Hyderabad State into India, M. K. Vellodi was appointed as Chief Minister of the state and Mir Osman Ali Khan became the Rajpramukh on 26 January 1950. He was a Senior Civil servant in the Government of India. He administered the state with the help of bureaucrats from Madras state and Bombay state.

In the 1952 Legislative Assembly election, Burgula Ramakrishna Rao was elected Chief Minister of Hyderabad State. During this time there were violent agitations by some Telanganites to send back bureaucrats from Madras state, and to strictly implement &#x27;Mulki-rules&#x27; (local jobs for locals only), which was part of Hyderabad state law since 1919.

===Dissolution===
In 1956 during the reorganisation of the Indian States based along linguistic lines, the state of Hyderabad was split up among Andhra Pradesh and Bombay state (later Maharashtra) and Karnataka.

On 2 June 2014, the state of Telangana was formed splitting from the rest of Andhra Pradesh state and formed the 29th state of India, with Hyderabad as its capital.

==Government and politics==
===Government===
Wilfred Cantwell Smith states that Hyderabad was an area where the political and social structure from medieval Muslim rule had been preserved more or less intact into modern times. The last Nizam was reputed to be the wealthiest man in the world. He was supported by an aristocracy of 1,100 feudal lords who owned a further 30% of the state&#x27;s land, with some 4 million tenant farmers. The state also owned 50% or more of the capital in all the major enterprises, allowing the Nizam to earn further profits and control their affairs.

Next in the social structure were the administrative and official classes, comprising about 1,500 officials. A number of them were recruited from outside the state. The lower-level government employees were also predominantly Muslim. Effectively, the Muslims of Hyderabad represented an &#x27;upper caste&#x27; of the social structure.

All power was vested in the Nizam. He ruled with the help of an Executive Council or Cabinet, established in 1893, whose members he was free to appoint and dismiss. The government of the Nizam recruited heavily from the North Indian Hindu Kayastha caste for administrative posts. There was also an Assembly, whose role was mostly advisory. More than half of its members were appointed by the Nizam and the rest were elected from a carefully limited franchise. There were representatives of Hindus, Parsis, Christians and Depressed Classes in the Assembly. Their influence was however limited due to their small numbers.

The state government also had a large number of outsiders (called &quot;non-mulkhis&quot;) – 46,800 of them in 1933, including all the members of the Nizam&#x27;s Executive Council. Hindus and Muslims united in protesting against the practice which robbed the locals of government employment. The movement, however, fizzled out after the Hindu members raised the issue of &#x27;responsible government&#x27;, which was of no interest to the Muslim members and led to their resignation.

Various properties and wealth owned by the Nizam as part of Hyderabad State are now succeeded by his descendants, including his grandsons Prince Mukarram Jah, Prince Mufakkam Jah &amp; Prince Shahmat Jah and his great-grandson Himayat Ali Mirza among others. Himayat Ali Mirza, great-grandson of the Nizam, remarked that his stake in the English state sums up to 36% of the total amount. For claiming the total share of £35 million, Nizam&#x27;s great-grandson, Himayat Ali Mirza, reached the London High Court.

===Political movements===
Up to 1920, there was no political organisation of any kind in Hyderabad. In that year, following British pressure, the Nizam issued a &quot;firman&quot; appointing a special officer to investigate constitutional reforms. It was welcomed enthusiastically by a section of the populace, who formed the Hyderabad State Reforms Association. However, the Nizam and the Special Officer ignored all their demands for consultation. Meanwhile, the Nizam banned the Khilafat movement in the State as well as all political meetings and the entry of &quot;political outsiders&quot;. Nevertheless, some political activity did take place and witnessed cooperation between Hindus and Muslims. The abolition of the Sultanate in Turkey and Gandhi&#x27;s suspension of the Non-co-operation movement in British India ended this period of cooperation.

An organisation called Andhra Jana Sangham (later renamed &quot;Andhra Mahasabha&quot;) was formed in November 1921 and focused on educating the masses of Telangana in political awareness. With leading members such as Madapati Hanumantha Rao, Burgula Ramakrishna Rao and M. Narsing Rao, its activities included urging merchants to resist offering freebies to government officials and encouraging labourers to resist the system of &quot;begar&quot; (free labour requested at the behest of state). Alarmed by its activities, the Nizam passed a powerful gagging order in 1929, requiring all public meetings to obtain prior permission. But the organisation persisted by mobilising on social issues such as the protection of &quot;ryots&quot;, women&#x27;s rights, abolition of the devadasi system and purdah, uplifting of Dalits etc. It turned to politics again in 1937, passing a resolution calling for responsible government. Soon afterwards, it split along the moderate–extremist lines. The Andhra Mahasabha&#x27;s move towards politics also inspired similar movements in Marathwada and Karnataka in 1937, giving rise to the &quot;Maharashtra Parishad&quot; and &quot;Karnataka Parishad&quot; respectively.

==Military==
Hyderabad&#x27;s first ruler, Asaf Jah I (r. 1724–1748) was a talented commander and assembled a powerful army that allowed Hyderabad to become one of the preeminent states in southern India. After his death, the military was crippled by the succession wars of his sons. It was restored under Asaf Jah II (r. 1762–1803) who modernised the army. Notable units during his reign included British-trained battalions, the French-trained &quot;Corps Français de Raymond&quot; which was led by Michel Joachim Marie Raymond and fought under the French &quot;Tricolour&quot;, and the Victorious Battalion, an elite infantry unit entirely composed of women.

== Culture ==
=== Symbols ===
==== Coat of arms ====
The coat of arms features the full titles of the Nizam at the bottom, and a dastar

==== Flag ====
Under the leadership of Asaf Jah V the state changed its traditional heraldic flag.
The Asafia flag of Hyderabad. The script along the top reads &quot;Al Azmatulillah&quot; meaning &quot;All greatness is for God&quot;. The bottom script reads &quot;Ya Uthman&quot; which translates to &quot;Oh Osman&quot;. The writing in the middle reads &quot;Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah&quot;

==== Stamps ====

The stamps of the Hyderabad State featured the Golconda Fort, Ajanta Caves, and the Charminar.

== Demographics ==
=== Mulki ===
Mulkis or Mulkhis, are the native inhabitants of the erstwhile Hyderabad State, regardless of ethnic differences. The term was popularly used during the 1952 Mulkhi Agitation (Telangana), which saw protests demanding job reservations for Mulki people, and demanding non-Mulkis to leave.
As per the 1941 Hyderabad State Census, 2,187,005 people spoke Urdu, 7,529,229 people spoke Telugu, 3,947,089 people spoke Marathi, 1,724,180 people spoke Kanarese (Kannada) as native languages. The Hyderabadi Muslim population, including the ruling Asaf Jahi dynasty numbered around 2,097,475 people, while Hindus numbered around 9,171,318 people.

== Architecture ==

The architecture of Hyderabad State is very cosmopolitan, and heavily influenced by European and Islamic styles. The Nizam&#x27;s palaces and several public buildings were built in a distinctive style. The earliest surviving buildings are purely European, examples being the neoclassical British Residency (1798) and Falaknuma Palace (1893). In the early 20th century, the Osmania General Hospital
City College, High Court, and Kacheguda Railway station were designed in the Indo-Saracenic style by Vincent Esch. The Moazzam Jahi Market was also built in a similar style.
==Industries==

Various major industries emerged in various parts of the State of Hyderabad before its incorporation into the Union of India, especially during the first half of the twentieth century. Hyderabad city had a separate power plant for electricity. However, the Nizams focused on industrial development in the region of Sanathnagar, housing several industries there with transportation facilities by both road and rail.

<doc id="298498" wikidata="Q10358989" url="?curid=298498" title="United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1974">
<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 with the song &quot;Long Live Love&quot;, written by Valerie Avon and Harold Spiro, and performed by Olivia Newton-John. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final, after having previously selected the performer internally. In addition, the BBC was also the host broadcaster and staged the event at the Dome in Brighton, after the winner of the , the (CLT) from , opted not to host the event.

==Before Eurovision==
=== &quot;A Song for Europe 1974&quot; ===
The show was held on 23 February 1974 and presented by Jimmy Savile as part of the BBC1 TV series &quot;Clunk, Click... As It Happens&quot;, with Olivia Newton-John selected to perform all of the entries, in part due to the recommendation of her close friend Cliff Richard. Originally, as with 1973, Cilla Black&#x27;s 1974 nine-part BBC series was scheduled to feature the &#x27;Song for Europe&#x27; process, but Black was uncomfortable at promoting another female singer (Newton-John) each week throughout the series&#x27; run and in a rather last minute decision, the BBC arranged to move the process to another show. This necessitated a truncating of the regularly established format of the chosen artist performing one song a week on the given series, so it was planned that Newton-John would perform two songs a week for three weeks once the series started. However, a BBC strike led to the cancellation of the first show, so another revision was needed and Olivia performed three songs a show over two programmes. In the final, her performances were immediately repeated before viewers were asked to cast votes via postcards through the mail to choose the winner. An extremely low postal vote led to &quot;Long Live Love&quot; winning with just 27,387 votes.
=== Chart success ===
The top two songs from the contest were released on single, reaching No. 11 in the UK Singles Chart, the first UK entry since 1966 not to reach the top ten, or indeed, the top four. Newton-John had just signed a new international recording contract with EMI, who released the single in most territories, but it was released on Pye International in the UK as the final commitment of her previously existing contract. All six songs were included on her debut EMI album &quot;Long Live Love&quot; released later in 1974, although these tracks were dropped from the US release &quot;If You Love Me, Let Me Know&quot;. Subsequently, all six songs became available on CD compilations. Newton-John recorded a German version of the winning song and Marion Rung recorded a Finnish version &quot;Kun rakastaa&quot;. Marie Toland and &#x27;Stephanie&#x27; recorded French versions of the winner and several others from the UK selection. Dana, Jimmy Jones and The Dooleys recorded other tracks from the UK final.

==At Eurovision==
&quot;Long Live Love&quot; went on to tie for fourth place in the contest.

The Eurovision Song Contest was broadcast live on BBC 1 with sports presenter David Vine undertaking the television commentary, whilst Terry Wogan returned to providing the radio commentary on BBC Radio 2. British Forces Radio also provided a broadcast with commentary provided by Richard Astbury.

<doc id="298503" wikidata="Q6208831" url="?curid=298503" title="Joe Btfsplk">
<text>Joe Btfsplk is a character in the satirical comic strip &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; by cartoonist Al Capp. The hapless Btfsplk means well, but he is &quot;the world&#x27;s worst jinx&quot; and brings disastrous misfortune to everyone around him. A small, dark rain cloud perpetually hovers over his head to symbolize his bad luck. Btfsplk and his ever-present cloud became one of the most iconic images in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;.

==Background==
Joe&#x27;s first appearance was on July 7, 1940.

One storyline in the early 1970s features him trapping his cloud in a special anti-pollutant jar. Joe becomes romantically involved with a gal for the first time—until her crazed ex-boyfriend shows up to kill him. Joe reluctantly opens the jar and releases his cloud in order to take care of the boyfriend and wistfully realizes that he wasn&#x27;t meant for any other kind of life. As he returns to his normal, loner existence, his cloud once again in tow, he is for the moment satisfied to be who he really is.

In addition to the obvious comic effect, Capp often used Joe Btfsplk as a &quot;deus ex machina&quot; to produce miraculous rescues or to effect plot twists. Joe was later licensed for use in a series of animated TV commercials for Head &amp; Shoulders, a dandruff shampoo.

==Pronunciation==
According to Al Capp, the creator of the character, &quot;btfsplk&quot; is a rude sound. During public lectures, Capp demonstrated this sound by closing his lips, leaving his tongue sticking out, and then blowing out air, which is colloquially called a &quot;raspberry&quot; or Bronx cheer.

<text>The Saisiyat (; Hakka Pha̍k-fa-sṳ: &quot;賽夏族(Sòi-hà-tshu̍k)&quot;), also spelled Saisiat, are an indigenous people of Taiwan. In 2000 the Saisiyat numbered 5,311, which was approximately 1.3% of Taiwan&#x27;s total indigenous population, making them one of the smallest aboriginal groups in the country. The Saisiyat inhabit Western Taiwan, overlapping the border between Hsinchu County and Miaoli County. They are divided into the Northern Branch (Wufong in the mountainous Hsinchu area) and the Southern Branch (Nanzhuang and Shitan in the highlands of Miaoli), each with its own dialect. Their language is also known as Saisiyat.

==Names==
Saisiyat are sometimes rendered as Saiset, Seisirat, Saisett, Saisiat, Saisiett, Saisirat, Saisyet, Saisyett, Amutoura, or Bouiok.

==History==
A series of major conflicts between the Kingdom of Tungning and the Saisiyat people left the Saisiyat decimated and with much of their land in the hands of the Kingdom. The details of the conflicts remain mysterious however historians agree that the outcome was negative for the Saisiyat.

The first Aboriginal victim of the White Terror was Jih Chin-chun, a Saisiyat man executed in 1952.

==Culture==
The Saisiyat people hold a festival called Pasta’ay every two years.

===Saisiat Global Flood Account===
In the ancient times, human beings were created by god and lived in the original land. Then a flood happened suddenly and human beings were dispersed everywhere without knowing what would happen. Then, a man sat on a weaving loom and floated to Airubia Mountain. There was a god called Otspoehobong (Oopenhaboon) on the mountains. The god grabbed the man suddenly. Fearing that the flood would cause human beings to be extinct, the god killed the survivor, pounded his flesh, chanted an incantation, and threw the flesh of the dismembered corpse into the sea. The flesh turned into human beings. They were our ancestors named Siasiat by the god. Then the god cut his intestines and threw into the sea. The intestines turned into human beings. They were the ancestors, of Taiwanese... Then it threw his bones into the sea. The bones also turned into human beings. They were ancestors of the indomitable Atayal people.

<doc id="298505" wikidata="Q7888070" url="?curid=298505" title="United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1975">
<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1975 with the song &quot;Let Me Be the One&quot;, written by Paul Curtis, and performed by The Shadows. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final, after having previously selected the performers internally.

==Before Eurovision==
=== Artist selection ===
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) selected The Shadows to represent the United Kindgdom, after BBC executive Bill Cotton had stated that he specifically wanted a group to sing for Britain in 1975. His choice was met with a negative response by the UK media, the song writing community and the general public. The choice of The Shadows led to calls from the Music Publishers Association for the songwriters and composers to be allowed to select the artist of their choice to perform the songs in future UK selections for Eurovision and the low postal vote persuaded the BBC that a new format was indeed needed. This was inaugurated in 1976. 

=== &quot;A Song for Europe 1975&quot; ===
Members of the group were responsible for two of the six shortlisted songs, causing a further outcry from the music publishers associations. The Shadows performed one song a week for six weeks on the BBC1 series &quot;Lulu&quot;, hosted by Lulu. Uniquely, although the group were seen performing weekly, in fact they only recorded one performance of each of the six songs in December 1974, for a special edition of the series broadcast on 15 February 1975. These performances were then shown individually for the six week period, before being shown back-to-back in the final, followed by an immediate repeat of all six. Viewers cast votes via postcard for their favourite song and the winning entry announced on 22 February was &quot;Let Me Be the One&quot; which received 17,477 votes, the lowest published figure known for a winning song in the UK finals that used either voting by mail or telephone. The winning song was written by Paul Curtis, who won the &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; contest another three times, making him the most successful writer in the history of the British selection process. He also wrote a further 21 songs that reached the British finals. &quot;Let Me Be the One&quot; became the record ninth British entry to place 2nd in the Eurovision Song Contest.
=== Chart success ===
The Shadows released all six songs from the &quot;A Song for Europe 1975&quot; final shortly after the contest on the album &quot;Specs Appeal&quot;. The top two songs were released on single, peaking at No.12 in the UK singles chart, their first hit single since 1967. Gary Benson released his own recording of &quot;Don&#x27;t Throw It All Away&quot;, which had placed 4th in the final, reaching No. 20 in the UK singles chart later in 1975. Amongst others, Olivia Newton-John, Barrington Levy and The Delfonics all released versions of this song. Subsequently, all six songs by The Shadows were made available on CD compilations and re-issues, including an instrumental demo version of &quot;No No Nina&quot; which had placed last in the UK selection. The Dooleys recorded a version of the runner-up &quot;Stand Up Like a Man&quot; and French singer Keeley Hawes recorded a French version of the winner, &quot;Laisse-moi danser tu l&#x27;été&quot;, whilst a Danish version, &quot;Lad mig blive din&quot; was recorded by Eurovision Song Contest 1963 co-winner Grethe Ingmann.

==At Eurovision==
&quot;Let Me Be the One&quot; won the national and went on to come 2nd in the contest.

For the Eurovision Song Contest, broadcast on 22 March 1975, Pete Murray provided the BBC Television commentary, having previously presented the contest for BBC Radio in 1968 and 1969, 1972 and 1973. Terry Wogan once again provided the radio commentary on BBC Radio 2. British Forces Radio had been scheduled to broadcast the contest with commentary provided by Richard Astbury, but technical difficulties prevented the broadcast from going ahead.

<text>La Brea Tar Pits is an active paleontological research site in urban Los Angeles. Hancock Park was formed around a group of tar pits where natural asphalt (also called asphaltum, bitumen, or pitch; &quot;brea&quot; in Spanish) has seeped up from the ground for tens of thousands of years. Over many centuries, the bones of trapped animals have been preserved. The George C. Page Museum is dedicated to researching the tar pits and displaying specimens from the animals that died there. La Brea Tar Pits is a registered National Natural Landmark.

==Formation==
Tar pits are composed of heavy oil fractions called gilsonite, which seep from the earth as oil. Crude oil seeps up along the 6th Street Fault from the Salt Lake Oil Field, which underlies much of the Fairfax District north of Hancock Park. The oil reaches the surface and forms pools, becoming asphalt as the lighter fractions of the petroleum biodegrade or evaporate. The asphalt then normally hardens into stubby mounds, which can be seen in several areas of the park.

This seepage has been happening for tens of thousands of years, during which the asphalt would sometimes form a deposit thick enough to trap animals. The deposit would then become covered with water, dust, and leaves. Animals would wander in, become trapped, and die. Predators would enter to eat the trapped animals and would also become stuck, a phenomenon called a &quot;predator trap&quot;. As the bones of a dead animal sank, the asphalt would soak into them, turning them dark-brown or black in color. Lighter fractions of petroleum evaporated from the asphalt, leaving a more solid substance which then encased the bones. 

Dramatic fossils of large mammals have been extricated, and the asphalt also preserves microfossils: wood and plant remnants, rodent bones, insects, mollusks, dust, seeds, leaves, and pollen grains. Examples of these are on display in the George C. Page Museum. Radiometric dating of preserved wood and bones has given an age of 38,000 years for the oldest known material from the La Brea seeps.

==History==

The Chumash and Tongva people used tar from the pits to build plank boats by sealing planks of California redwood trunks and pieces of driftwood from the Santa Barbara Channel, which they used to navigate the California coastline and Channel Islands.

The Portolá expedition, a group of Spanish explorers led by Gaspar de Portolá, made the first written record of the tar pits in 1769. Father Juan Crespí wrote,

While crossing the basin, the scouts reported having seen some geysers of tar issuing from the ground like springs; it boils up molten, and the water runs to one side and the tar to the other. The scouts reported that they had come across many of these springs and had seen large swamps of them, enough, they said, to caulk many vessels. We were not so lucky ourselves as to see these tar geysers, much though we wished it; as it was some distance out of the way we were to take, the Governor [Portolá] did not want us to go past them. We christened them &quot;Los Volcanes de Brea&quot; [the Tar Volcanoes].
Harrison Rogers, who accompanied Jedediah Smith on his 1826 expedition to California, was shown a piece of the solidified asphalt while at Mission San Gabriel, and noted in his journal, &quot;The Citizens of the Country make great use of it to pitch the roofs of their houses&quot;.

The La Brea Tar Pits and Hancock Park were formerly part of the Mexican land grant of Rancho La Brea. For some years, tar-covered bones were found on the property but were not initially recognized as fossils because the ranch had lost various animals—including horses, cattle, dogs, and even camels—whose bones closely resemble several of the fossil species. Initially, they mistook the bones in the pits for the remains of pronghorn or cattle that had become mired. The original Rancho La Brea land grant stipulated that the tar pits be open to the public for the use of the local Pueblo.

There were originally more than 100 separate pits of tar (or asphaltum) but most of those have been filled in with rock or dirt since settlement, leaving about a dozen accessible from ground level.

In 1886, the first excavation for land pitch in the village of La Brea was undertaken by &quot;Messrs Turnbull, Stewart &amp; co.&quot;. 

===Excavations===

Union Oil geologist W. W. Orcutt is credited, in 1901, with first recognizing that fossilized prehistoric animal bones were preserved in pools of asphalt on the Hancock ranch. In commemoration of Orcutt&#x27;s initial discovery, paleontologists named the La Brea coyote (&quot;Canis latrans orcutti&quot;) in his honor. John C. Merriam of the University of California, Berkeley led much of the original work in this area early in the 20th century. Contemporary excavations of the bones started in 1913. 

In the 1940s and 1950s, public excitement was generated by the preparation of previously recovered large mammal bones. A subsequent study demonstrated the fossil vertebrate material was well preserved, with little evidence of bacterial degradation of bone protein. They are believed to be some 10–20,000 years old, dating from the Last Glacial Period.

On February 18, 2009, George C. Page Museum announced the 2006 discovery of 16 fossil deposits that had been removed from the ground during the construction of an underground parking garage for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art next to the tar pits. Among the finds are remains of a saber-toothed cat, dire wolves, bison, horses, a giant ground sloth, turtles, snails, clams, millipedes, fish, gophers, and an American lion. Also discovered is a nearly intact mammoth skeleton, nicknamed Zed; the only pieces missing are a rear leg, a vertebra, and the top of its skull, which was sheared off by construction equipment in preparation to build the parking structure. These fossils were packaged in boxes at the construction site and moved to a compound behind Pit 91, on Page Museum property, so that construction could continue. Twenty-three large accumulations of tar and specimens were taken to the Page Museum. These deposits are worked on under the name &quot;Project 23&quot;. 

As work for the public transit D Line is extended, museum researchers know more tar pits will be uncovered, for example near the intersection of Wilshire and Curson. In an exploratory subway dig in 2014 on the Miracle Mile, prehistoric objects unearthed included geoducks, sand dollars, and a from a pine tree, of a type now found in Central California&#x27;s woodlands.

==George C. Page Museum== 
In 1913, George Allan Hancock, the owner of Rancho La Brea, granted the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County exclusive excavation rights at the Tar Pits for two years. In those two years, the museum was able to extract 750,000 specimens at 96 sites, guaranteeing that a large collection of fossils would remain consolidated and available to the community. Then in 1924, Hancock donated to Los Angeles County with the stipulation that the county provide for the preservation of the park and the exhibition of fossils found there. 

The George C. Page Museum of La Brea Discoveries, part of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, was built next to the tar pits in Hancock Park on Wilshire Boulevard. It was named for a local philanthropist. Construction began in 1975, and the museum opened to the public in 1977. The area is part of urban Los Angeles in the Miracle Mile District.

The museum tells the story of the tar pits and presents specimens excavated from them. Visitors can walk around the park and see the tar pits. On the grounds of the park are life-sized models of prehistoric animals in or near the tar pits. Of more than 100 pits, only Pit 91 is still regularly excavated by researchers and can be seen at the Pit 91 viewing station. In addition to Pit 91, the one other ongoing excavation is called &quot;Project 23&quot;. Paleontologists supervise and direct the work of volunteers at both sites.

As a result of a design competition in 2019, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County chose Weiss/Manfredi over Dorte Mandrup and Diller Scofidio + Renfro to redesign the park, including by adding a pedestrian walkway framing Lake Pitt, which is long.

The museum is featured prominently in the 1992 cult classic film &quot;Encino Man&quot;, where the title character recollects he was previously a caveman during his exploration of the museum&#x27;s exhibits.

==Heritage site==
In respect of it being the &quot;richest paleontological site on Earth for terrestrial fossils of late Quaternary age,&quot; the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) included the &quot;Late Quaternary asphalt seeps and paleontological site of La Brea Tar Pits&quot; in its assemblage of 100 geological heritage sites around the world in a listing published in October 2022. The organization defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as &quot;a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.&quot;

==Flora and fauna==
Among the prehistoric Pleistocene species associated with the La Brea Tar Pits are Columbian mammoths, dire wolves, short-faced bears, American lions, ground sloths (predominantly &quot;Paramylodon harlani&quot;, with much rarer &quot;Megalonyx jeffersonii&quot; and &quot;Nothrotheriops shastensis)&quot; and the state fossil of California, the saber-toothed cat (&quot;Smilodon fatalis&quot;). Contrary to popular belief, the tar pits don&#x27;t contain dinosaur remains, as these were extinct before the pits formed.

The park is known for producing myriad mammal fossils dating from the Wisconsin glaciation. While mammal fossils generate significant interest, other fossils including fossilized insects and plants, and even pollen grains, are also valued. These fossils help define a picture of what is thought to have been a cooler, moister climate in the Los Angeles basin during the glacial age. Microfossils are retrieved from the matrix of asphalt and sandy clay by washing with a solvent to remove the petroleum, then picking through the remains under a high-powered lens.

Historically, the majority of the mammals excavated from the La Brea deposits had been large carnivores, supporting a hypothesized &quot;carnivore trap&quot; in which large herbivores entrapped in asphalt attracted predators and scavengers which then became entrapped while trying to steal a quick meal. However, new research with an eye towards microfossils has revealed a stunning diversity and abundance of many types of mammals. According to paleontologist Thomas Halliday, &quot;Rancho La Brea Tar Pits... where big herbivores typically get stuck in tar which naturally seeps from the ground, and as a result, you get huge concentrations of just specifically herbivores. You get a herbivorous sample of the ecosystem and very few carnivores, except those that are trying to scavenge on the already dead carcasses that have just got stuck in the tar.&quot;

===Bacteria===
Methane gas escapes from the tar pits, causing bubbles that make the asphalt appear to boil. Asphalt and methane appear under surrounding buildings and require special operations for removal to prevent the weakening of building foundations. In 2007, researchers from UC Riverside discovered that the bubbles were caused by hardy forms of bacteria embedded in the natural asphalt. After consuming petroleum, the bacteria release methane. Around 200 to 300 species of bacteria were newly discovered here.

==Human presence==
Only one human has been found, a partial skeleton of La Brea Woman dated to around 10,000 calendar years (about 9,000 radiocarbon years) BP, who was 17 to 25 years old at death and found associated with remains of a domestic dog, so was interpreted to have been ceremonially interred. In 2016, however, the dog was determined to be much younger in date.

Also, some even older fossils showed possible tool marks, indicating humans active in the area at the time. Bones of saber-toothed cats from La Brea showing signs of &quot;artificial&quot; cut marks at oblique angles to the long axis of each bone were radiocarbon dated to 15,200 ± 800 BP (uncalibrated). If these cuts are in fact tool marks resultant from butchering activities, then this material would provide the earliest solid evidence for human association with the Los Angeles Basin. Yet it is also possible that there was some residual contamination of the material as a result of saturation by asphaltum, influencing the radiocarbon dates.

<doc id="298512" wikidata="Q647710" url="?curid=298512" title="Blaster (computer worm)">
<text>Blaster (also known as Lovsan, Lovesan, or MSBlast) was a computer worm that spread on computers running operating systems Windows XP and Windows 2000 during August 2003.

The worm was first noticed and started spreading on August 11, 2003. The rate that it spread increased until the number of infections peaked on August 13, 2003. Once a network (such as a company or university) was infected, it spread more quickly within the network because firewalls typically did not prevent internal machines from using a certain port. Filtering by ISPs and widespread publicity about the worm curbed the spread of Blaster.

In September 2003, Jeffrey Lee Parson, an 18-year-old from Hopkins, Minnesota, was indicted for creating the B variant of the Blaster worm; he admitted responsibility and was sentenced to an 18-month prison term in January 2005. The author of the original A variant remains unknown.

== Creation and effects ==

According to court papers, the original Blaster was created after security researchers from the Chinese group reverse engineered the original Microsoft patch that allowed for execution of the attack.

The worm spreads by exploiting a buffer overflow discovered by the Polish security research group Last Stage of Delirium in the DCOM RPC service on the affected operating systems, for which a patch had been released one month earlier in MS03-026 (CVE-2003-0352) and later in MS03-039. This allowed the worm to spread without users opening attachments simply by spamming itself to large numbers of random IP addresses. Four versions have been detected in the wild. These are the most well-known exploits of the original flaw in RPC, but there were in fact another 12 different vulnerabilities that did not see as much media attention.

The worm was programmed to start a SYN flood against port 80 of windowsupdate.com if the system date is after August 15 and before December 31 and after the 15th day of other months, thereby creating a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) against the site. The damage to Microsoft was minimal as the site targeted was windowsupdate.com, rather than windowsupdate.microsoft.com, to which the former was redirected. Microsoft temporarily shut down the targeted site to minimize potential effects from the worm.

The worm&#x27;s executable, MSBlast.exe, contains two messages. The first reads:
I just want to say LOVE YOU SAN!!
This message gave the worm the alternative name of Lovesan. The second reads:
billy gates why do you make this possible ? Stop making money
and fix your software!!
This is a message to Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft and the target of the worm.

The worm also creates the following registry entry so that it is launched every time Windows starts:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\ windows auto update=msblast.exe
== Timeline ==
*May 28, 2003: Microsoft releases a patch that would protect users from an exploit in WebDAV that Welchia used. (Welchia used the same exploit as MSBlast but had an additional method of propagation that was fixed in this patch. This method was only used after 200,000 RPC DCOM attacks - the form that MSBlast used.)
*July 5, 2003: Timestamp for the patch that Microsoft releases on the 16th.
*July 16, 2003: Microsoft releases a patch that would protect users from the yet unknown MSBlast. At the same time they also released a bulletin describing the exploit.
*Around July 16, 2003: White hat hackers create proof-of-concept code verifying that the unpatched systems are vulnerable. The code was not released.
*July 17, 2003: CERT/CC releases a warning and suggests blocking port 135.
*July 21, 2003: CERT/CC suggests also blocking ports 139 and 445.
*July 25, 2003: releases information on how to exploit the RPC bug that Microsoft released the July 16 patch to fix.
*August 1, 2003: The U.S. issues an alert to be on the lookout for malware exploiting the RPC bug.
*Sometime prior to August 11, 2003: Other viruses using the RPC exploit exist.
*August 11, 2003: Original version of the worm appears on the Internet.
*August 11, 2003: Symantec Antivirus releases a rapid release protection update.
*August 11, 2003, evening: Antivirus and security firms issued alerts to run Windows Update.
*August 12, 2003: The number of infected systems is reported at 30,000.
*August 13, 2003: Two new worms appear and begin to spread. (Sophos, a variant of MSBlast and W32/RpcSpybot-A, a totally new worm that used the same exploit)
*August 15, 2003: The number of infected systems is reported at 423,000.
*August 16, 2003: DDoS attack against windowsupdate.com starts. (Largely unsuccessful because that URL is merely a redirect to the real site, windowsupdate.microsoft.com.)
*August 18, 2003: Microsoft issues an alert regarding MSBlast and its variants.
*August 18, 2003: The related helpful worm, Welchia, appears on the internet.
*August 19, 2003: Symantec upgrades their risk assessment of Welchia to &quot;high&quot; (category 4).
*August 25, 2003: McAfee lowers their risk assessment to &quot;Medium&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Virus Profile: W32/Lovsan.worm.a&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*August 27, 2003: A potential DDoS attack against HP is discovered in one variant of the worm.
*January 1, 2004: Welchia deletes itself.
*January 13, 2004: Microsoft releases a stand-alone tool to remove the MSBlast worm and its variants.
*February 15, 2004: A variant of the related worm Welchia is discovered on the internet.
*February 26, 2004: Symantec lowers their risk assessment of the Welchia worm to &quot;Low&quot; (category 2).
*March 12, 2004: McAfee lowers their risk assessment to &quot;Low&quot;.
*April 21, 2004: A &quot;B&quot; variant is discovered.
*January 28, 2005: The creator of the B variant of MSBlaster is sentenced to 18 months in prison.

== Side effects ==

Although the worm can only spread on systems running Windows 2000 or Windows XP, it can cause instability in the RPC service on systems running other versions of Windows NT, including Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition. In particular, the worm does not spread in Windows Server 2003 because Windows Server 2003 was compiled with the /GS switch, which detected the buffer overflow and shut the RPCSS process down.

When infection occurs, the buffer overflow causes the RPC service to crash, leading Windows to display the following message and then automatically reboot, usually after 60 seconds.

This was the first indication many users had an infection; it often occurred a few minutes after every startup on compromised machines. A simple resolution to stop countdown is to run the &quot;shutdown /a&quot; command, causing some side effects such as an empty (without users) Welcome Screen. The Welchia worm had a similar effect. Months later, the Sasser worm surfaced, which caused a similar message to appear.

<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1976 with the song &quot;Save Your Kisses For Me&quot;, written by Tony Hiller, Lee Sheriden, and Martin Lee, and performed by Brotherhood of Man. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final titled &quot;A Song for Europe 1976&quot;. The entry eventually won the Eurovision Song Contest.

==Before Eurovision==
=== &quot;A Song for Europe 1976&quot; ===
Following the lowest published figure known for the public vote in the British national finals that used either voting by mail or telephone in 1975 and the BBC&#x27;s choice of The Shadows singing all the shortlisted songs, calls from the Music Publishers Association for the songwriters and composers to be allowed to select the artist of their choice to perform the songs in future British selections for Eurovision led to an &#x27;all-comers&#x27; final being reinstated in 1976. It was a reversion to the format used for the national finals from 1961 to 1963. Twelve songs were chosen by the Music Publisher&#x27;s Association, with the songwriters choosing their own artist.

==== Final ====
The show took place on 25 February 1976 at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Michael Aspel (who had hosted the 1969 UK final) acted as presenter for the event. Fourteen regional juries voted on the songs: Bristol, Bangor, Leeds, Norwich, Newcastle, Aberdeen, Birmingham, Manchester, Belfast, Cardiff, Plymouth, Glasgow, Southampton and London. Each jury ranked the songs 1-12, awarding 12 points for their favourite down to 1 point for their least preferred. The songs were backed by the Alyn Ainsworth Orchestra. &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; was watched in 6.3 million homes (giving it a general viewing figure of 12.6 million viewers), and finishing as the 18th-most watched programme of the week. &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot; won the national final and ultimately went on to win the Eurovision Song Contest itself. Host Michael Aspel did not name any of the jury spokespersons from the UK regions and none of them identified themselves by name, only naming the region they represented. 

Frank Ifield had taken part in the &quot;A Song for Europe 1962&quot; contest in the UK, where he&#x27;d placed second. Polly Brown became the only artist to perform two songs in a multi-artist UK national final. Apart from her solo entry, Brown was also one half of the duo &#x27;Sweet Dreams&#x27;. With a change in line-up, &#x27;Co-Co&#x27; would return in the &#x27; contest, which they would win and go on to represent the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest 1978. The band featured Cheryl Baker who ultimately won Eurovision for the with Bucks Fizz. &#x27;Sunshine&#x27; also returned two years later, also with a different line-up. Hazell Dean would return in the &#x27; contest.


=== Chart success ===
International singing stars Dionne Warwick and Jean Terrell (former lead singer of The Supremes) both recorded and released versions of the song &quot;Do You Believe In Love At First Sight?&quot; despite the song&#x27;s poor placing in the contest. Only the winning song reached the UK singles chart: &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot; became a UK No.1 single, the group had a 2 further UK No.1 singles over the next 18 months. The track was the biggest selling single of 1976 in the UK and the sixth biggest selling for the 1970s in Britain, with sales well in excess of 1 million copies. Globally, the track attained sales of over 6 million, making it the biggest selling winning single in the history of the Eurovision Song Contest.

== At Eurovision ==
By scoring 164 points out of a possible maximum of 204, the UK achieved the highest relative score ever reached under the &quot;Douze Points&quot; voting system inaugurated in the Eurovision Song Contest 1975 and used ever since, with 80.4% of the possible score attained. No song has ever achieved this since, although previously in 1973, Luxembourg&#x27;s winning entry scored 80.6% under a different voting system.

Michael Aspel provided the television commentary for the UK at the Eurovision Song Contest for BBC 1, Terry Wogan once again provided the radio commentary for BBC Radio 2 listeners and Andrew Pastouna provided commentary for British Forces Radio.

==&quot;Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest&quot;==

&quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot; was one of fourteen Eurovision songs selected by fans to compete in the &quot;Congratulations&quot; 50th anniversary special in 2005. In spite of it and another British entry (&quot;Congratulations&quot;) being among the participating songs, as well as the presence of Katrina Leskanich (of the UK&#x27;s victorious 1997 act Katrina and the Waves) as co-host, the United Kingdom did not broadcast &quot;Congratulations&quot; as they felt it wouldn&#x27;t attract enough of an audience. They opted to create their own special, &quot;Boom Bang-a-Bang: 50 Years of Eurovision&quot;, hosted by 1998 host and longtime British commentator Sir Terry Wogan.

The song was drawn to appear thirteenth in the running order, following &quot;Hold Me Now&quot; by Johnny Logan and preceding &quot;My Number One&quot; by Helena Paparizou. At the end of the first round, &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot; was announced as one of the five songs advancing to the final round. It was later revealed that the song finished fifth, scoring 154 points.

&quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot; ultimately finished fifth in the final round, scoring 230 points (including, as in 1976, a maximum 12 from Israel).

<text>Staraya Ladoga (), known as Ladoga until 1704, is a rural locality (a &quot;selo&quot;) in Volkhovsky District of Leningrad Oblast, Russia, located on the Volkhov River near Lake Ladoga, north of the town of Volkhov, the administrative center of the district.

It used to be a prosperous trading outpost in the 8th and 9th centuries. During this period, it was known to the Norse as Aldeigjuborg. It was dominated by Varangians who became known as the Rus&#x27;. For that reason, Staraya Ladoga is sometimes called the first capital of Russia, and is regarded as one of the original centers from which the name &quot;Rus″&quot; spread to other territories inhabited by the East Slavs.

==History==
===Origin===
Dendrochronology suggests that Ladoga was founded in 753. Until 950, it was one of the most important trading ports of Eastern Europe. Merchant vessels sailed from the Baltic Sea through Ladoga to Novgorod and then to Constantinople or the Caspian Sea. This route is known as the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks. An alternative way led down the Volga River along the Volga trade route to the Khazar capital of Atil, and then to the southern shores of the Caspian Sea, all the way to Baghdad. Tellingly, the oldest Arabian Middle Age coin in Europe was unearthed in Ladoga.

===Ladoga under Rurik and the Rurikids===

According to the Hypatian Codex that was created at the end of the 13th century, the legendary Varangian leader Rurik arrived at Ladoga in 862 and made it his capital. Rurik later moved to Novgorod and subsequently his successors moved from there to Kiev where foundations for the powerful state of Kievan Rus&#x27; were laid. There are several huge tumuli, or royal funerary barrows, at the outskirts of Ladoga. One of them is said to be Rurik&#x27;s grave, and another one—that of his successor Oleg. The Heimskringla and other Norse sources mention that in the late 990s Eric Haakonsson of Norway raided the coast and set the town ablaze. Ladoga was the most important trading center in Eastern Europe from about 800 to 900 CE, and it is estimated that between 90% and 95% of all Arab dirhams found in Sweden passed through Ladoga.

Ladoga&#x27;s next mention in chronicles is dated 1019, when Ingigerd of Sweden married Yaroslav of Novgorod. Under the terms of their marriage settlement, Yaroslav ceded Ladoga to his wife, who appointed her father&#x27;s cousin, the Swedish earl Ragnvald Ulfsson, to rule the town. This information is confirmed by sagas and archaeological evidence, which suggests that Ladoga gradually evolved into a primarily Varangian settlement. At least two Swedish kings spent their youth in Ladoga, Stenkil and Inge I, and possibly also King Anund Gårdske.

In the 12th and 13th centuries, Ladoga functioned as a trade outpost of the powerful Novgorod Republic. Later its trade significance declined and most of the population engaged in fishing in the 15th century. After new fortresses such as Oreshek and Korela were constructed in the 14th century further to the west of Ladoga, the town&#x27;s military significance also decreased. Ladoga belonged to Vodskaya Pyatina of the Republic and contained eighty-four homesteads in the 15th century; most of the land belonged to the church. The Novgorodians built there a citadel with five towers and several churches.

===Later history===
After the town of Novaya Ladoga (New Ladoga) was founded in 1704 by Peter the Great, Ladoga became known as Staraya Ladoga and its importance decreased.

==Sights and landmarks==
The heart of Staraya Ladoga is an old fortress where the Ladozhka flows into the Volkhov. In earlier times, it was a strategic site because it was the only possible harbor for sea-vessels that could not navigate through the Volkhov River. The fortress was rebuilt at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries. 
In 1703, Peter the Great founded the town of Novaya Ladoga (New Ladoga) closer to the bank of Lake Ladoga. The ancient fortress thenceforth declined and came to be known as Staraya Ladoga (Old Ladoga), in order to distinguish it from the new town. The reconstruction of one of the towers of Staraya Ladoga&#x27;s fortress was scheduled to be completed in 2010.

The mid-12th-century churches of St. George and of Mary&#x27;s Assumption stand in all their original glory. Inside St. George&#x27;s, some magnificent 12th-century frescoes are still visible. In addition, there is a mid-12th-century church of St. Climent, which stands in ruins.

There is also the Assumption Nunnery/Monastery, and a monastery, dedicated to St. Nicholas which was constructed mainly in the 17th century.
==Culture and art==
Staraya Ladoga&#x27;s barrows, architectural monuments, and romantic views of the Volkhov River have always been drawing attention of Russian painters. There were the artists Ivan Aivazovsky, Orest Kiprensky, Aleksander Orłowski, Ivan Ivanov, Alexey Venetsianov and many others in the 19th century. A future member of the Imperial Academy of Arts and the Peredvizhniki group Vassily Maximov was born and laid to rest there. He portrayed scenes from an everyday life of peasants.

Nicholas Roerich painted his studies there during the summer of 1899. He named this landscape the best of the Russian one. Valentin Serov, Konstantin Korovin, Boris Kustodiev also worked there. Alexander Samokhvalov was in Staraya Ladoga many times in 1924-1926. He took part in the restoration of the St. George&#x27;s Church. That experience gave a great deal to the artist, he wrote. It helped him to understand the effect of joining a monumental painting with the architectural forms. In result of this dwelling in that place painter made his &quot;Staraya Ladoga&quot; (1924) and &quot;Family of Fisherman&quot;(1926, Russian Museum)

In February 1945 the ex-estate of the prince Shakhovskoy was given to Leningrad artists as a base zone for rest and creative work. The restoring works continued 15 years from 1946. But Leningrad artists began to arrive to Staraya Ladoga from 1940s. It became a source of inspiration for Sergei Osipov, Gleb Savinov, Nikolai Timkov, Arseny Semionov and many others for many years.

The House of Creativity «Staraya Ladoga began to operate permanently in the beginning of the 1960s after the finish of the restoration. It was an important center of the art life of Russia for 30 years. Such artists as Evsey Moiseenko, Alexander Samokhvalov, Vecheslav Zagonek, Dmitry Belyaev, Vladimir Ovchinnikov, Boris Ugarov, Boris Shamanov, Vsevolod Bazhenov, Piotr Buchkin, Zlata Bizova, Taisia Afonina, Marina Kozlovskaya, Dmitry Maevsky, Alexander Semionov, Arseny Semionov, Irina Dobrekova, Vladimir Sakson, Gleb Savinov, Elena Zhukova, Sergei Zakharov, Ivan Varichev, Veniamin Borisov, Valery Vatenin, Ivan Godlevsky, Vladimir Krantz, Lazar Yazgur, Irina Dobrekova, Piotr Fomin and many other Leningrad and other regions painters and graphic artists worked there.
In 1970-1980 as the House of Creativity was widening, new buildings were built. They used it a whole-year. A dwelling there for 1–2 months was without any payment for the artists. All commitments on housing, food and travel were taken on by the Art Foundation of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. The paintings created there were exposed in first-rate art exhibitions. It completed the collections of the main museums of Soviet Union and numerous private collections of Russia and abroad. Also it became a base of an extensive collection of painting, graphics and sculpture of the museum “Staraya Ladoga”.

Financing of the House of Creativity stopped at the beginning of the 1990s on the breakup of the USSR and after the liquidation of the Art Foundation. It stopped welcoming artists and was closed.

<text>Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People is a career-spanning retrospective DVD plus bonus EP by American band Primus, released on October 7, 2003. The title was inspired by a crayon-made story book written by guitarist Larry LaLonde&#x27;s son, and the cover depicts a sculpture made by long-time Primus collaborator Lance &quot;Link&quot; Montoya. The DVD features all of the band&#x27;s music videos to date, plus short films and live footage from as far back as 1986, whereas the bonus EP features five new songs written and recorded specifically for this release. When promoting the release, bassist Les Claypool remarked that &quot;It seems of late that bands are adding supplemental DVD material to their album releases to promote record sales. We&#x27;ve done the opposite. We&#x27;ve added a supplemental audio recording of brand new music to an extremely comprehensive DVD of classic visuals.&quot;

&quot;Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People&quot; shows the return of drummer Tim Alexander to the lineup, who had previously left the band in 1996. He joins Claypool and LaLonde in performing on the EP, as well as providing commentary for the DVD. Claypool has claimed that two of the five new songs on the EP were written within the first 45 minutes of the lineup working together again, and &quot;Pilcher&#x27;s Squad&quot; was said to have been written and recorded within a single afternoon. This is also the only Primus release to feature one of the band&#x27;s earliest drummers, Tim &quot;Curveball&quot; Wright, filmed performing &quot;Sgt. Baker&quot;.

==Critical reception==

In his review for AllMusic, Greg Prato predicts that &quot;while hardcore fans will want to hear what Claypool and the boys have been up to lately in the recording studio, the main attraction of &quot;Animals&quot; is its exceptional DVD.&quot; He notes that &quot;early on, it appeared as though Primus was more about songwriting, before later reinventing itself as a Grateful Dead-worshipping outfit that loved to put jamming before songwriting&quot;, and that &quot;fans hoping that Primus would return to streamlined songs will be disappointed, as the band has picked up right where it left off&quot; on the new EP.

<text>Cathair Mór (&quot;the great&quot;), son of Feidhlimidh Fiorurghlas, a descendant of Conchobar Abradruad, was, according to Lebor Gabála Érenn, a High King of Ireland. He took power after the death of Fedlimid Rechtmar. Cathair ruled for three years, at the end of which he was killed by the Luaigne of Tara, led by Conn Cétchathach. The &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; synchronises his reign with that of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (161–180). The chronology of Geoffrey Keating&#x27;s &quot;Foras Feasa ar Éirinn&quot; dates his reign to 113–116, that of the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; to 119–122.

==Genealogy==
According to Foras Feasa ar Éirinn, Cathaoir Mor was a son of Feidhlimidh Fiorurghlas, son of Cormac Gealta Gaoth, son of Nia Corb, son of Cu Corb, son of Mogh Corb, son of Conchubhar Abhradhruadh, son of Fionn File, son of Rossa Ruadh, son of Fearghus Fairrge, son of Nuadha Neacht, son of Seadna Siothbhac, son of Lughaidh Loithfhionn, son of Breasal Breac, son of Fiachaidh Foibhric, son of Oilill Glas, son of Fearadhach Foghlas, son of Nuadha Fullon, son of Ealloit, son of Art, son of Mogh Airt, son of Criomhthann Coscrach, son of Feidhlimidh Foirthriun, son of Fearghus Fortamhail, son of Breasal Breodhamhan, son of Aonghus Ollamh, son of Oilill Bracain, son of Labhraidh Loingseach of the race of Eireamhon.

==Legends==

He is said to have had thirty sons, but only ten of them had children; several medieval dynasties of Leinster traced their ancestors to them. His daughter Cochrann was said to have been the mother of the fenian hero Diarmuid Ua Duibhne.

He features in the saga &quot;Esnada Tige Buchet&quot; (&quot;The Melody of the House of Buchet&quot;). Cathair&#x27;s daughter Eithne Tháebfhota is fostered by a hospitable Leinsterman named Buchet who has many herds of cattle, but Cathair&#x27;s sons so exploit Buchet&#x27;s hospitality that he is left with only one bull and seven cows, and the king, now old and enfeebled, is unable to restrain them. Buchet and his family, including Eithne, are reduced to living in a hut in the forest in Kells, County Meath. Later, when Cormac mac Airt is king, he marries Eithne and restores Buchet&#x27;s fortunes (in other stories the king who marries Eithne is Cathair&#x27;s successor Conn Cétchathach). In another saga, &quot;Fotha Catha Cnucha&quot; (&quot;The Cause of the Battle of Cnucha&quot;), Cathair gives the hill of Almu (Knockaulin, County Kildare) to the druid Nuada son of Aichi. This hill will later be famous as the home of Nuada&#x27;s great-grandson Fionn mac Cumhaill.

<text>Edmund Crispin was the pseudonym of Robert Bruce Montgomery (usually credited as Bruce Montgomery) (2 October 1921 – 15 September 1978), an English crime writer and composer known for his Gervase Fen novels and for his musical scores for the early films in the &quot;Carry On&quot; series.

==Life and work==
Montgomery was born at &quot;Blackwood&quot;, Bois Lane, Chesham Bois, Buckinghamshire, fourth child and only son of Robert Ernest Montgomery (1878-1962) and Marion Blackwood, née Jarvie. His father was principal clerk- formerly secretary to the High Commissioner of India- in the India Office; of Irish birth, his family later settled at Hanwell, in the London Borough of Ealing. Montgomery&#x27;s mother was Scottish, of a family claiming illegitimate descent from Bonnie Prince Charlie. When Montgomery was two years old, his family moved round the corner to &quot;Domus&quot;, a &quot;big house in a rural setting&quot; that was built according to his father&#x27;s instructions.

He was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School and graduated from St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, in 1943, with a BA in modern languages, having for two years been its organ scholar and choirmaster. While there he became friendly with Philip Larkin and Kingsley Amis. From 1943 to 1945 he taught at Shrewsbury School and began writing the first of his detective novels. Montgomery encouraged Larkin&#x27;s writing ambitions, and according to Andrew Motion &quot;by combining a devoted commitment to writing with a huge appetite for drinking and fooling around, he gave Larkin a model of the ways in which art could avoid pretension&quot;.

He first became established under his own name as a composer of vocal and choral music, including &quot;An Oxford Requiem&quot; (1951), but later turned to film work, writing the scores for many British comedies of the 1950s. For the Carry On series he composed six scores (&quot;Sergeant&quot;, &quot;Nurse&quot;, &quot;Teacher&quot;, &quot;Constable&quot;, &quot;Regardless&quot; and &quot;Cruising&quot;), including the original Carry On theme subsequently adapted for later films by Eric Rogers. He also composed the scores to four films in the Doctor film series (&quot;House&quot;, &quot;Sea&quot;, &quot;Large&quot; and &quot;Love&quot;). Montgomery wrote both the screenplay and score of &quot;Raising the Wind&quot; (1961), and his other film scores included &quot;The Kidnappers&quot; (1953), &quot;Raising a Riot&quot; (1955), &quot;Eyewitness&quot; (1956), &quot;The Truth About Women&quot; (1957), &quot;The Surgeon&#x27;s Knife&quot; (1957), &quot;Please Turn Over&quot; (1959), &quot;Too Young to Love&quot; (1959), &quot;Watch Your Stern&quot; (1960), &quot;No Kidding&quot; (1960), &quot;Twice Round the Daffodils&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Brides of Fu Manchu&quot; (1966).

==Detective novels==
Montgomery wrote detective novels and two collections of short stories under the pseudonym Edmund Crispin (taken from a character in Michael Innes&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet, Revenge!&quot;). Nine volumes appeared between 1944 and 1953, starting with &quot;The Case of The Gilded Fly&quot;. The stories feature Oxford don Gervase Fen, who is a professor of English at the university and a fellow of St Christopher&#x27;s College, a fictional institution that Crispin locates next to St John&#x27;s College. Fen is an eccentric, sometimes absent-minded, character reportedly based on his tutor, the Oxford professor W. G. Moore (1905-1978). The whodunit novels have complex plots and fantastic, somewhat unbelievable solutions, including examples of the locked room mystery. They are written in a humorous, literary and sometimes farcical style. They are also among the few mystery novels to break the fourth wall occasionally and speak directly to the audience. Perhaps the best example is from &quot;The Moving Toyshop&quot;, during a chase sequence – &quot;Let&#x27;s go left&quot;, Cadogan suggested. &quot;After all, Gollancz is publishing this book.&quot;

All of the novels contain frequent references to English literature, poetry, and (in particular) music. &quot;Frequent Hearses&quot; and &quot;Swan Song&quot; have a specifically musical backdrop. &quot;Swan Song&quot; (1947) explores the world of opera during rehearsals for a production of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;, while &quot;Frequent Hearses&quot; is set in a film studio, and includes among the characters Napier, a composer of film music. By 1950, when &quot;Frequent Hearses&quot; was published, Montgomery was already busy elsewhere, also establishing himself as a composer of film music.

Crispin is considered by many to be one of the last great exponents of the classic crime mystery. He was inducted into the prestigious Detection Club in 1947.

==Composer==
Bruce Montgomery composed the scores for nearly forty films, including documentaries and thrillers. The &quot;Carry-On Suite&quot;, arranged by David Whittle from the scores of &quot;Carry On Sergeant&quot; (1958), &quot;Carry On Nurse&quot; (1959) and &quot;Carry On Teacher&quot; (1959), provides a representative example, dominated by the main theme, a comedy March. For &quot;Raising the Wind&quot; (1961), Montgomery was responsible for the storyline, screenplay and musical score, also conducting the music and acting as technical advisor.

Although his film work got his music out to a huge audience, the numerous comedy scores in particular stand in stark contrast to Bruce Montgomery&#x27;s concert works and church music with which he started out. These began to appear in the mid-1940s, at the same time his detective novels were appearing under the name Edmund Crispin. An early example is the &quot;Overture to a Fairy Tale&quot; of 1946, first performed in February 1948 by the Torquay Municipal Orchestra. (Montgomery was living at Brixham at the time).

But church music predominates, the culmination being the &quot;Oxford Requiem&quot;, commissioned by the Oxford Bach Choir and first performed at the Sheldonian Theatre on 23 May 1951 (The Sheldonian was also the scene of a crime in his novel &quot;The Moving Toyshop&quot;). He may have been motivated to compose the piece following the death of his close friend and teacher, the organist and composer Godfrey Sampson – thought also to have been the inspiration behind the character Geoffrey Vintner, the organist and friend of Gervase Fen in &quot;Holy Disorders&quot;. &quot;An Oxford Requiem&quot; &quot;is Montgomery’s most considerable achievement to date&quot;, wrote &quot;The Times&quot; reviewer, &quot;and confirms the suspicion that he is a real composer with something of real significance to say&quot;. The choir of St John&#x27;s College, Oxford has recorded the final movement, &#x27;Lord, thou hast been our refuge&#x27;. The &quot;Requiem&quot; was followed by his final major work for chorus, the secular &quot;Venus&#x27; Praise&quot; (1952), a setting of seven sixteenth and seventeenth century English poems.

Even less known are the operas, which include a children&#x27;s ballad opera, &quot;John Barleycorn&quot;, and two intriguing collaborations with his friend Kingsley Amis providing the texts. The first, &quot;Amberley Hall&quot;, was described by Montgomery as &quot;a mildly scandalous burlesque set in England in the 18th century&quot;. The second, &quot;To Move the Passions&quot;, was a ballad opera commissioned for the 1951 Festival of Britain. Both remained unfinished, and Amis complained that Montgomery was too busy &quot;writing filthy film scores and stinking stories for the popular press&quot;.

Of the orchestral concert works, only &quot;Overture to a Fairy Tale&quot; and the Concertino for String Orchestra of 1950 – a substantial three movement piece despite the modest title, and the only purely instrumental work Montgomery ever had published – are generally available as recordings. There are recordings of two concert works derived from film scores: &quot;Scottish Aubade&quot; (from the 1952 documentary film &quot;Scottish Highlands&quot;) and &quot;Scottish Lullaby&quot; (from &quot;The Kidnappers&quot;, 1953). The BBC revived the 1947 comedy overture &quot;Bartholomew Fair&quot; in June 2024.

Philip Lane calls Montgomery &quot;a composer of talent who was perhaps side-tracked, and, not helped by increasing alcoholism, unable to fulfil his full potential. On the other hand, not every composer has their music heard by millions throughout the world, even though not every listener is aware of the composer’s name.&quot;

==Later career==
Montgomery returned to literature at the end of his life, with the final Crispin novel, &quot;The Glimpses of the Moon&quot; (1977). By now, the composer character, Broderick Thouless, is writing &quot;difficult&quot; film music and light concert works rather than the other way round (as it was with Napier in &quot;Frequent Hearses&quot;). Such comic perversity is characteristic of Crispin.

But Montgomery&#x27;s output of music and fiction had all but ceased after the 1950s, although he continued to write reviews of crime novels and science fiction works for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; (praising the early works of both P. D. James and Ruth Rendell). He had always been a heavy drinker, and there was a long gap in his writing during a time when he was suffering from alcohol problems. Otherwise he enjoyed a quiet life (enlivened by music, reading, church-going and bridge) in Totnes, Devon, where he resisted all attempts to develop or exploit the district, and visited London as little as possible. He moved to a new house he had built at Higher Week, a hamlet near Dartington, in 1964. The 1969 short story &quot;We Know You&#x27;re Busy Writing, But We Thought You Wouldn&#x27;t Mind If We Just Dropped in for a Minute&quot; humorously evokes the difficulties of a writer balancing his social and leisure inclinations with the discipline of writing. In 1976 he married his secretary Ann, two years before he died from alcohol-related problems aged 56.

A biography by David Whittle, &quot;Bruce Montgomery/Edmund Crispin: A Life in Music and Books&quot; () was published in June 2007. A previously unpublished novella, featuring Gervase Fen, &quot;The Hours of Darkness,&quot; has been included in the 2019 edition of the annual anthology, &quot;Bodies from the Library&quot;.

==Influence==
Gareth Roberts has said that the tone of his &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel &quot;The Well-Mannered War&quot; was modelled upon Crispin&#x27;s style. He also remarks (of &quot;The Moving Toyshop&quot;): &quot;It&#x27;s more like Doctor Who than Doctor Who.&quot; Christopher Fowler pays homage to &quot;The Moving Toyshop&quot; in &quot;The Victoria Vanishes&quot;, his sixth Bryant &amp; May novel.

<text>CompactFlash (CF) is a flash memory mass storage device used mainly in portable electronic devices. The format was specified and the devices were first manufactured by SanDisk in 1994.

CompactFlash became one of the most successful of the early memory card formats, surpassing Miniature Card and SmartMedia. Subsequent formats, such as MMC/SD, various Memory Stick formats, and xD-Picture Card offered stiff competition. Most of these cards are smaller than CompactFlash while offering comparable capacity and speed. Proprietary memory card formats for use in professional audio and video, such as P2 and SxS, are faster, but physically larger and more costly.

CompactFlash&#x27;s popularity is declining as CFexpress is taking over. As of 2022, both Canon and Nikon&#x27;s newest high end cameras, e.g. the Canon EOS R5, Canon EOS R3, and Nikon Z 9 use CFexpress cards for the higher performance required to record 8K video.

Traditional CompactFlash cards use the Parallel ATA interface, but in 2008, a variant of CompactFlash, CFast was announced. CFast (also known as CompactFast) is based on the Serial ATA interface.

In November 2010, SanDisk, Sony and Nikon presented a next generation card format to the CompactFlash Association. The new format has a similar form factor to CF/CFast but is based on the PCI Express interface instead of Parallel ATA or Serial ATA. With potential read and write speeds of 1 Gbit/s (125 MB/s) and storage capabilities beyond 2 TiB, the new format is aimed at high-definition camcorders and high-resolution digital cameras, but the new cards are not backward compatible with either CompactFlash or CFast. The XQD card format was officially announced by the CompactFlash Association in December 2011.

==Description==
There are two main subdivisions of CF cards, 3.3 mm-thick type I and 5 mm-thick type II (CF2). The type II slot is used by miniature hard drives and some other devices, such as the Hasselblad CFV Digital Back for the Hasselblad series of medium format cameras. There are four main card speeds: original CF, CF High Speed (using CF+/CF2.0), faster CF 3.0 standard and the faster CF 4.0 standard adopted as of 2007.

CompactFlash was originally built around Intel&#x27;s NOR-based flash memory, but has switched to NAND technology. CF is among the oldest and most successful formats, and has held a niche in the professional camera market especially well. It has benefited from both a better cost to memory-size ratio and, for much of the format&#x27;s life, generally greater available capacity than other formats.

CF cards can be used directly in a PC Card slot with a plug adapter, used as an ATA (IDE) or PCMCIA storage device with a passive adapter or with a reader, or attached to other types of ports such as USB or FireWire. As some newer card types are smaller, they can be used directly in a CF card slot with an adapter. Formats that can be used this way include SD/MMC, Memory Stick Duo, xD-Picture Card in a Type I slot and SmartMedia in a Type II slot, as of 2005. Some multi-card readers use CF for I/O as well.

The first CompactFlash cards had capacities of 2 to 10 megabytes. This increased to 64 MB in 1996, 128 MB in 1998, 256 MB in 1999, 512 MB in 2001, and 1 GB in 2002.

==Technical details==
The CompactFlash interface is a 50-pin subset of the 68-pin PCMCIA connector. &quot;It can be easily slipped into a passive 68-pin PCMCIA Type II to CF Type I adapter that fully meets PCMCIA electrical and mechanical interface specifications&quot;, according to compactflash.org. The interface operates, depending on the state of a mode pin on power-up, as either a 16-bit PC Card (0x7FF address limit) or as an IDE (PATA) interface.

Unlike the PC Card interface, no dedicated programming voltages (Vpp1 and Vpp2) are provided on the CompactFlash interface.

CompactFlash IDE mode defines an interface that is smaller than, but electrically identical to, the ATA interface. The CF device contains an ATA controller and appears to the host device as if it were a hard disk. CF devices operate at 3.3 volts or 5 volts, and can be swapped from system to system. CompactFlash supports C-H-S and 28-bit logical block addressing (CF 5.0 introduced support for LBA-48). CF cards with flash memory are able to cope with extremely rapid changes in temperature. Industrial versions of flash memory cards can operate at a range of −45 °C to +85 °C.

NOR-based flash has lower density than newer NAND-based systems, and CompactFlash is therefore the physically largest of the three memory card formats introduced in the early 1990s, being derived from the JEIDA/PCMCIA Memory Card formats. The other two are Miniature Card (MiniCard) and SmartMedia (SSFDC). However, CF did switch to NAND type memory later. The IBM Microdrive format, later made by Hitachi, implements the CF Type II interface, but is a hard disk drive (HDD) as opposed to solid-state memory. Seagate also made CF HDDs.

===Speed===
CompactFlash IDE (ATA) emulation speed is usually specified in &quot;x&quot; ratings, e.g. 8x, 20x, 133x. This is the same system used for CD-ROMs and indicates the maximum transfer rate in the form of a multiplier based on the original audio CD data transfer rate, which is 150 kB/s.

: formula_1

where &quot;R&quot; = transfer rate, &quot;K&quot; = speed rating. For example, 133x rating means transfer rate of: 133 × 150 kB/s = 19,950 kB/s ≈ 20 MB/s.

These are manufacturer speed ratings. Actual transfer rate may be higher, or lower, than shown on the card depending on several factors. The speed rating quoted is almost always the read speed, while write speed is often slower.

====Solid state====
For reads, the onboard controller first powers up the memory chips from standby. Reads are usually in parallel, error correction is done on the data, then transferred through the interface 16 bits at a time. Error checking is required due to soft read errors. Writes require powerup from standby, wear leveling calculation, a block erase of the area to be written to, ECC calculation, write itself (an individual memory cell read takes around 100 ns, a write to the chip takes 1ms+ or 10,000 times longer).

Because the USB 2.0 interface is limited to 35 MB/s and lacks bus mastering hardware, USB 2.0 implementation results in slower access.

Modern UDMA-7 CompactFlash Cards provide data rates up to 145 MB/s and require USB 3.0 data transfer rates.

A direct motherboard connection is often limited to 33 MB/s because IDE to CF adapters lack high speed ATA (66 MB/s plus) cable support. Power on from sleep/off takes longer than power up from standby.

====Magnetic media====
Many hard drives (often referred to by the trademarked name &quot;Microdrive&quot;) typically spin at 3600 RPM, so rotational latency is a consideration, as is spin-up from standby or idle. Seagate&#x27;s 8 GB ST68022CF drive spins up fully within a few revolutions but current drawn can reach up to 350 milliamps and runs at 40-50 mA mean current. Its average seek time is 8 ms and can sustain 9 MB/s read and write, and has an interface speed of 33 MB/s. Hitachi&#x27;s 4 GB Microdrive is 12 ms seek, sustained 6 MB/s.

===Capacities and compatibility===
The CF 5.0 Specification supports capacities up to 128 PiB using 48-bit logical block addressing (LBA). Prior to 2006, CF drives using magnetic media offered the highest capacities (up to 8 GiB). Now there are solid-state cards with higher capacities (up to 512 GB).

As of 2011, solid-state drives (SSDs) have supplanted both kinds of CF drive for large capacity requirements.

====Solid state capacities====
SanDisk announced its 16 GB &quot;Extreme III&quot; card at the photokina trade fair, in September, 2006. That same month, Samsung announced 16, 32 and 64 GB CF cards. Two years later, in September, 2008, PRETEC announced 100 GB cards.

====Magnetic media capacities====
Seagate announced a 5 GB &quot;1-inch hard drive&quot; in June, 2004, and an 8 GB version in June, 2005.

====Use in place of a hard disk drive====
In early 2008, the CFA demonstrated CompactFlash cards with a built in SATA interface. Several companies make adapters that allow CF cards to be connected to PCI, PCMCIA, IDE and SATA connections, allowing a CF card to act as a solid-state drive with virtually any operating system or BIOS, and even in a RAID configuration.

CF cards may perform the function of the master or slave drive on the IDE bus, but have issues sharing the bus. Moreover, late-model cards that provide DMA (using UDMA or MWDMA) may present problems when used through a passive adapter that does not support DMA.

===Reliability===
Original PC Card memory cards used an internal battery to maintain data when power was removed. The rated life of the battery was the only reliability issue. CompactFlash cards that use flash memory, like other flash-memory devices, are rated for a limited number of erase/write cycles for any &quot;block.&quot; While NOR flash has higher endurance, ranging from 10,000 to 1,000,000, they have not been adapted for memory card usage. Most mass storage usage flash are NAND based. NAND flash were being scaled down to 16 nm. They are usually rated for 500 to 3,000 write/erase cycles per block before hard failure. This is less reliable than magnetic media. &quot;Car PC Hacks&quot; suggests disabling the Windows swap file and using its Enhanced Write Filter (EWF) to eliminate unnecessary writes to flash memory. Additionally, when formatting a flash-memory drive, the Quick Format method should be used, to write as little as possible to the device.

Most CompactFlash flash-memory devices limit wear on blocks by varying the physical location to which a block is written. This process is called wear leveling. When using CompactFlash in ATA mode to take the place of the hard disk drive, wear leveling becomes critical because low-numbered blocks contain tables whose contents change frequently. Current CompactFlash cards spread the wear-leveling across the entire drive. The more advanced CompactFlash cards will move data that rarely changes to ensure all blocks wear evenly.

NAND flash memory is prone to frequent soft read errors. The CompactFlash card includes error checking and correction (ECC) that detects the error and re-reads the block. The process is transparent to the user, although it may slow data access.

As a flash memory device is solid-state, it is less affected by physical shock than a spinning disk.

The possibility for electrical damage from upside-down insertion is prevented by asymmetrical side slots, assuming that the host device uses a suitable connector.

====Power consumption and data transfer rate====
Small cards consume around 5% of the power required by small disk drives and still have reasonable transfer rates of over 45 MB/s for the more expensive &#x27;high-speed&#x27; cards. However, the manufacturer&#x27;s warning on the flash memory used for ReadyBoost indicates a current draw in excess of 500 mA.

====File systems====
CompactFlash cards for use in consumer devices are typically formatted as FAT12 (for media up to 16 MB), FAT16 (for media up to 2 GB, sometimes up to 4 GB) and FAT32 (for media larger than 2 GB). This lets the devices be read by personal computers but also suits the limited processing ability of some consumer devices such as cameras.

There are varying levels of compatibility among FAT32-compatible cameras, MP3 players, PDAs, and other devices. While any device that claims FAT32-capability should read and write to a FAT32-formatted card without problems, some devices are tripped up by cards larger than 2 GB that are completely unformatted, while others may take longer to apply a FAT32 format.

The way many digital cameras update the file system as they write to the card creates a FAT32 bottleneck. Writing to a FAT32-formatted card generally takes a little longer than writing to a FAT16-formatted card with similar performance capabilities. For instance, the Canon EOS 10D writes the same photo to a FAT16-formatted 2 GB CompactFlash card somewhat faster than to a same speed 4 GB FAT32-formatted CompactFlash card, although the memory chips in both cards have the same write speed specification. Although FAT16 is more wasteful of disk space with its larger clusters, it works better with the write strategy that flash memory chips require.

The cards themselves can be formatted with any type of file system such as Ext, JFS, NTFS, or by one of the dedicated flash file systems. It can be divided into partitions as long as the host device can read them. CompactFlash cards are often used instead of hard drives in embedded systems, dumb terminals and various small form-factor PCs that are built for low noise output or power consumption. CompactFlash cards are often more readily available and smaller than purpose-built solid-state drives and often have faster seek times than hard drives.

===CF+ and CompactFlash specification revisions===
When CompactFlash was first being standardized, even full-sized hard disks were rarely larger than 4 GB in size, and so the limitations of the ATA standard were considered acceptable. However, CF cards manufactured after the original Revision 1.0 specification are available in capacities up to 512 GB. While the current revision 6.0 works in [P]ATA mode, future revisions are expected to implement SATA mode.

* CompactFlash Revision 1.0 (1995), 8.3 MB/s (PIO mode 2), support for up to 128 GB storage space.
* CompactFlash+ aka CompactFlash I/O (1997)
* CF+ and CompactFlash Revision 2.0 (2003) added an increase in speed to 16.6 MB/s data-transfer (PIO mode 4). At the end of 2003, DMA 33 transfers were added as well, available since mid-2004.
* CF+ and CompactFlash Revision 3.0 (2004) added support for up to a 66 MB/s data transfer rate (UDMA 66), 25 MB/s in PC Card mode, added password protection, along with a number of other features. CFA recommends usage of the FAT32 filesystem for storage cards larger than 2 GB.
* CF+ and CompactFlash Revision 4.0 (2006) added support for IDE Ultra DMA Mode 6 for a maximum data transfer rate of 133 MB/s (UDMA 133).
* CF+ and CompactFlash Revision 4.1 (2007) added support for Power Enhanced CF Storage Cards.
* CompactFlash Revision 5.0 (2010) added a number of features, including 48-bit addressing (supporting 128 petabyte of storage), larger block transfers of up to 32 megabytes, quality-of-service and video performance guarantees, and other enhancements
* CompactFlash Revision 6.0 (November 2010) added UltraDMA Mode 7 (167 MB/s), ATA-8/ACS-2 sanitize command, TRIM and an optional card capability to report the operating temperature range of the card.

===CE-ATA===
CE-ATA is a serial MMC-compatible interface based on the MultiMediaCard standard.

===CFast===

A variant of CompactFlash known as CFast is based on the Serial ATA (SATA) interface, rather than the Parallel ATA/IDE (PATA) bus for which all previous versions of CompactFlash are designed. CFast is also known as CompactFast.

CFast 1.0/1.1 supports a higher maximum transfer rate than current CompactFlash cards, using SATA 2.0 (300 MB/s) interface, while PATA is limited to 167 MB/s using UDMA 7.

CFast cards are not physically or electrically compatible with CompactFlash cards. However, since SATA can emulate the PATA command protocol, existing CompactFlash software drivers can be used, although writing new drivers to use AHCI instead of PATA emulation will almost always result in significant performance gains. CFast cards use a female 7-pin SATA data connector, and a female 17-pin power connector, so an adaptor is required to connect CFast cards in place of standard SATA hard drives which use male connectors.

The first CFast cards reached the market in late 2009. At CES 2009, Pretec showed a 32 GB CFast card and announced that they should reach the market within a few months. Delock began distributing CFast cards in 2010, offering several card readers with USB 3.0 and eSATAp (power over eSATA) ports to support CFast cards.

Seeking higher performance and still keeping a compact storage format, some of the earliest adoptors of CFast cards were in the gaming industry (used in slot machines), as a natural evolution from the by then well-established CF cards. Current gaming industry supporters of the format include both specialist gaming companies (e.g. Aristocrat Leisure) and OEMs such as Innocore (now part of Advantech Co., Ltd.).

The CFast 2.0 specification was released in the second quarter of 2012, updating the electrical interface to SATA 3.0 (600 MB/s). As of 2014, the only product employing CFast 2.0 cards was the Arri Amira digital production camera, allowing frame rates of up to 200 fps; a CFast 2.0 adapter for the Arri Alexa/XT camera was also released.

On 7 April 2014, Blackmagic Design announced the URSA cinema camera, which records to CFast media.

On 8 April 2015, Canon Inc. announced the XC10 video camera, which also makes use of CFast cards. Blackmagic Design also announced that its URSA Mini will use CFast 2.0.

As of October 2016, there are a growing number of cameras, video recorders, and audio recorders that use the faster data rates offered by CFast media.

As of 2017, in the wider embedded electronics industry, transition from CF to CFast is still relatively slow, probably due to hardware cost considerations and some inertia (familiarity with CF) and because a significant part of the industry is satisfied with the lower performance provided by CF cards, thus having no reason to change. A strong incentive to change to CFast for embedded electronics companies using designs based on Intel PC architecture is the fact that Intel has removed native support for the (P)ATA interface a few design platforms ago and the older CPU/PCH generations now have end-of-life status.

=== CFexpress ===

In September 2016, the CompactFlash Association announced a new standard based on PCIe 3.0 and NVMe, CFexpress. In April 2017, the version 1.0 of the CFexpress specification was published, with support for two PCIe 3.0 lanes in an XQD form-factor for up to 2 GB/s.

===Type I and Type II===
The only physical difference between the two types is that Type I devices are 3.3 mm thick while Type II devices are 5 mm thick. Electrically, the two interfaces are the same except that Type I devices are permitted to draw up to 70 mA supply current from the interface, while type II devices may draw up to 500 mA.

Most Type II devices are Microdrive devices (see below), other miniature hard drives, and adapters, such as a popular adapter that takes Secure Digital cards. A few flash-based Type II devices were manufactured, but Type I cards are now available in capacities that exceed CF HDDs. Manufacturers of CompactFlash cards such as Sandisk, Toshiba, Alcotek and Hynix offer devices with Type I slots only. Some of the latest DSLR cameras, like the Nikon D800, have also dropped Type II support.

===Microdrives===

Microdrive was a brand of tiny hard disks—about 25 mm (1 inch) wide—in a CompactFlash Type II package. The first was developed and released in 1999 by IBM, with a capacity of 170 MB. IBM sold its disk drive division, including the Microdrive trademark, to Hitachi in 2002. Comparable hard disks were also made by other vendors, such as Seagate and Sony. They were available in capacities of up to 8 GB but have been superseded by flash memory in cost, capacity, and reliability, and are no longer manufactured.

As mechanical devices, CF HDDs drew more current than flash memory&#x27;s 100 mA maximum. Early versions drew up to 500 mA, but more recent ones drew under 200 mA for reads and under 300 mA for writes. CF HDDs were also susceptible to damage from physical shock or temperature changes. However, CF HDDs had a longer lifespan of write cycles than early flash memories.

The iPod mini, Nokia N91, iriver H10 (5 or 6 GB model), LifeDrive, Sony NW-A1000/3000 and Rio Carbon used a Microdrive to store data.

==Compared to other portable storage==
* CompactFlash cards that use flash memory are more rugged than some hard drive solutions because they are solid-state. (See also Reliability above.) Separately, CompactFlash cards are thicker than other card formats, which may render them less susceptible to breakage from harsh treatment.
* As CompactFlash cards support the IDE/ATA command protocol with the host device, a passive adapter lets them function as the hard disk drive of a personal computer, as described above.
* CompactFlash does not have any built in digital rights management or cryptographic features found on some USB flash drives and other card formats. The absence of such features contributes to the openness of the standard, as card standards with such features may be subject to restrictive licensing agreements.
* The initial CompactFlash specification envisaged a higher maximum capacity than other card formats. For this reason, many early CompactFlash host devices are usable with modern multi-gigabyte memories, where users of other families such as Secure Digital have had to migrate to SDHC and SDXC.
* CompactFlash lacks the mechanical write protection switch that some other devices have, as seen in a comparison of memory cards.
* CompactFlash is physically larger than other card formats. This limits its use, especially in miniature consumer devices where internal space is limited, such as point-and-shoot digital cameras. (An offsetting benefit of larger size is that the card is easier to insert and remove, and harder to misplace.)

==Counterfeiting==
The marketplace for CompactFlash is extensive and includes counterfeits. Off-brand or counterfeit cards may be mislabeled, might not contain the actual amount of memory their controllers report to the host device, and may use types of memory that are not rated for the number of erase/rewrite cycles that the purchaser expects.

==Other devices in the CF form factor==
Since CompactFlash interface is electrically identical to the 16-bit PC Card, the CompactFlash form factor is also used for a variety of Input/Output and interface devices. Many standard PC cards have CF counterparts, some examples include:
* Barcode scanner
* Bluetooth
* Digital Camera
* Ethernet
* GPS
* Magnetic stripe reader
* Microdrive
* Modem and GSM Modem, including GPRS, CDMA2000 and EDGE
* Readers for various other Flash media
* RFID
* Sampler (musical instrument)
* Serial port and USB 1.1 host adapters
* Super VGA display adapter
* Wi-Fi

<doc id="298538" wikidata="Q193319" url="?curid=298538" title="Billie Jean">
<text>&quot;Billie Jean&quot; is a song by the American singer Michael Jackson, released by Epic Records on January 3, 1983, as the second single from his sixth studio album, &quot;Thriller&quot; (1982). It was written and composed by Jackson, produced by Quincy Jones, and co-produced by Jackson. &quot;Billie Jean&quot; blends post-disco, R&amp;B, funk, and dance-pop. The lyrics describe a woman, Billie Jean, who claims that the narrator is the father of her newborn son, which he denies. Jackson said the lyrics were based on groupies&#x27; claims about his older brothers when he toured with them as the Jackson 5.

&quot;Billie Jean&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Black Singles chart within three weeks, and became Jackson&#x27;s fastest-rising number one single since &quot;ABC&quot;, &quot;The Love You Save&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; in 1970, all of which he recorded as a member of the Jackson 5. It was also a number one hit in the UK, Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, Switzerland and Belgium, and reached the top ten in many other countries. &quot;Billie Jean&quot; was one of the best-selling singles of 1983, helping &quot;Thriller&quot; become the best-selling album of all time, and became Jackson&#x27;s best-selling solo single. &quot;Billie Jean&quot; is certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and is one of the best-selling singles of all-time.

Jackson&#x27;s performance of &quot;Billie Jean&quot; on the TV special &quot;Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever&quot; was nominated for an Emmy Award. It introduced a number of Jackson&#x27;s signatures, including the moonwalk, rhinestone glove, black sequined jacket, and high-water pants, and was widely imitated. The &quot;Billie Jean&quot; music video, directed by Steve Barron, was the first video by a black artist to be aired in heavy rotation on MTV. Along with the other videos produced for &quot;Thriller&quot;, it helped establish MTV&#x27;s cultural importance and make music videos an integral part of popular music marketing. The spare, bass-driven arrangement of &quot;Billie Jean&quot; helped pioneer what one critic called &quot;sleek, post-soul pop music&quot;. It also introduced a more paranoid lyrical style for Jackson, a trademark of his later music.

&quot;Billie Jean&quot; was awarded honors including two Grammy Awards and an American Music Award. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it as the No. 2 song for 1983. In a list compiled by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and MTV in 2000, the song was ranked as the sixth greatest pop song since 1963. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at number 58 on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2004, and at number 44 in its 2021 update of the list. The song was also included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. Frequently featured in lists of the best songs of all time, &quot;Billie Jean&quot; was named the greatest dance record of all time by BBC Radio 2 listeners.

==Background==

Jackson said that &quot;Billie Jean&quot; was based on groupies he and his brothers encountered while they performed as the Jackson 5. &quot;They would hang around backstage doors, and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with, and I think I wrote this out of experience with my brothers when I was little. There were a lot of Billie Jeans out there. Every girl claimed that their son was related to one of my brothers.&quot;

According to Jackson&#x27;s biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli, &quot;Billie Jean&quot; was inspired by letters Jackson received in 1981 from a woman claiming he was the father of one of her twins. Jackson, who regularly received letters of this kind, had never met the woman and ignored those claims. However, she continued to send letters stating that she loved him and wanted to be with him, asking how he could ignore his own flesh and blood. The letters disturbed him so much that he began to suffer nightmares.

Eventually, Jackson received a parcel containing a photograph of the fan, a gun, and a letter instructing him to die at a particular time. The fan would do the same once she had killed &quot;their&quot; baby, so they could be together in the &quot;next life&quot;. The Jacksons later discovered that the fan had been sent to a psychiatric hospital.

==Production==
Jackson said he felt &quot;Billie Jean&quot; would be a success as he was writing it: &quot;A musician knows hit material. Everything has to feel in place. It fulfills you and it makes you feel good. That&#x27;s how I felt about &#x27;Billie Jean&#x27;. I knew it was going to be big when I was writing it.&quot; He explained that, hearing it in his head while in his car, he was so absorbed that he did not realize his car had caught fire until a passing motorcyclist informed him.

Jackson disagreed with the producer, Quincy Jones, about the song. According to some reports, Jones felt it was too weak to be included on &quot;Thriller&quot;, but Jones denied this. Jones disliked the demo and did not care for the bassline, and wanted to cut Jackson&#x27;s 29-second introduction. Jackson, however, insisted that it be kept. According to Jones, he conceded when Jackson said it made him want to dance: &quot;And when Michael Jackson tells you, &#x27;That&#x27;s what makes me want to dance&#x27;, well, the rest of us just have to shut up.&quot;

Jones also wanted to change the title to &quot;Not My Lover&quot;, as he believed that people would think the song referred to the tennis player Billie Jean King. Jackson refused to change the title and asked Jones to give him co-producing credits for the track, as he felt that the finished product sounded close to his demo. In addition, Jackson wanted extra royalties. Jones granted him neither and the two fell out for several days.

The American composer Michael Boddicker said that Jackson played the synthesizer part in one take on the Yamaha CS-80 in seven minutes. However, the synthesizer player Bill Wolfer disputed this, saying he played the CS-80 chords on both the demo and the album version, and that Boddicker was misremembering the session: &quot;Everyone who worked with Michael Jackson knows that he didn&#x27;t play keys but a tiny bit, and never played them on a record!&quot; According to Wolfer, the part was his sound design: he programmed it to form a hybrid of brass and string sounds, which had a vocal-like quality. Jackson heard Wolfer experimenting with the sound on the CS-80 during the Triumph Tour with the Jacksons, which he liked and called Wolfer in for.

Bruce Swedien had Jackson sing his vocal overdubs through a six-foot cardboard tube. Jackson&#x27;s lead vocal was performed in one take; he had received vocal training every morning throughout the production of the song. Jazz saxophonist Tom Scott played the lyricon, an electronic wind instrument. Bassist Louis Johnson played his part on every bass guitar he owned, before Jackson settled for a Yamaha bass.

Engineer Bruce Swedien mixed the song 91 times—unusual for Swedien, who usually mixed a song just once. The mixes grew progressively worse, and Jones asked Swedien to listen again to the second mix, which was much better. The second mix was the final version. Instructed by Jones to create a drum sound with &quot;sonic personality&quot; that no one had heard before, Swedien constructed a platform for the drum kit with special elements including a flat piece of wood between the snare and hi-hat. He said: &quot;There aren&#x27;t many pieces of music where you can hear the first three or four notes of the drums, and immediately tell what the piece of music is. But I think that is the case with &#x27;Billie Jean&#x27;—and that I attribute to sonic personality.&quot;

==Composition==

&quot;Billie Jean&quot; blends post-disco, rhythm and blues, funk, and dance-pop. The song opens with a standard drum beat along with a standard hi-hat, and joined two bars later with a cabasa accompanied by a repetitive bassline. Each time it passes through the tonic, the note is doubled by a distorted synth bass. This accompaniment is followed by a repetitive three-note synth, played staccato with a deep reverb. The defining chord progression is then established. Jackson&#x27;s quiet vocals enter, accompanied by a finger-snap, which comes and goes during the verses, as the rhythm and chord progression repeats. Greg Phillinganes, who played keys, said of the song: &quot;&#x27;Billie Jean&#x27; is hot on every level. It&#x27;s hot rhythmically. It&#x27;s hot sonically, because the instrumentation is so minimal, you can really hear everything. It&#x27;s hot melodically ... lyrically [and] vocally. It affects you physically, emotionally, even spiritually.&quot;

According to Jones, Jackson &quot;stole&quot; notes from the Jon and Vangelis song &quot;State of Independence&quot;; Jones had produced Donna Summer&#x27;s cover of the song, and Jackson had sung backing vocals. According to Jon Anderson, &quot;They took the riff and made it funky for &#x27;Billie Jean&#x27; ... So that&#x27;s kinda cool, that cross-pollination in music.&quot; According to Daryl Hall of Hall &amp; Oates, Jackson told him he had taken the &quot;Billie Jean&quot; groove from their 1981 track &quot;I Can&#x27;t Go for That (No Can Do)&quot;. Hall told him &quot;Oh Michael, what do I care? You did it very differently.&quot;

According to &quot;Inside the Hits&quot;, the lyrics refer to the commotion created by Billie Jean on a dance floor. She entices the crowd with a seductive come-on before luring the narrator to her bedroom, through the fragrance of her perfume. Jackson&#x27;s vocal range spanned from a high baritone to a falsetto and he usually wrote melodies to show this range. However, in the verses of &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, his vocals range from a tenor to a low falsetto. A four-note falsetto is showcased in the chorus and, during the last line, Jackson peaks at a full octave. The song is in the key of F minor with a tempo of 117 beats per minute, while the verses are in the key of F dorian. Following the first chorus, a cello-like synth eases in at the beginnings of both the third, and later, the fourth, verses. Upon the announcement that the baby&#x27;s eyes resemble the narrator&#x27;s, a voice laments, &quot;oh no&quot;. This is met with Jackson&#x27;s signature falsetto &quot;hee hee&quot;. The bridge debuts the strings, and holds a pedal tone tonic with the exception of two lines and a chord leading into the chorus. Violins are then played, followed by a four-note minor guitar part. During the guitar part, vocal shouts, screams and laughs are added. Throughout this, the chord progression remains unaltered and is laced with Jackson&#x27;s vocal hiccups. All the musical and vocal elements are then brought together in the final chorus. In the fade, the narrator repeats his denial of fathering Billie Jean&#x27;s child.

==Reception==
On November 30, 1982, &quot;Thriller&quot; was released to critical and commercial success. On January 3, 1983, &quot;Billie Jean&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single; it follows Jackson&#x27;s successful duet with Paul McCartney on &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;. The song reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on March 5, 1983 and stayed there for seven weeks, becoming Jackson&#x27;s biggest solo hit. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it as the No. 2 song for 1983. &quot;Billie Jean&quot; topped the R&amp;B chart within three weeks, and became Jackson&#x27;s fastest-rising number one single since &quot;ABC&quot;, &quot;The Love You Save&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; in 1970, which he recorded as a member of the Jackson 5. It remained at number one for nine weeks on the R&amp;B chart, being preceded by the Gap Band&#x27;s &quot;Outstanding&quot;, before the single was eventually succeeded by George Clinton&#x27;s &quot;Atomic Dog&quot;. &quot;Billie Jean&quot; peaked at number 9 on the Adult Contemporary chart. It was also number one in the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot; topped both the singles and album charts in the same week. This occurred on both sides of the Atlantic simultaneously, a feat very few acts have ever achieved. The song was the third best-selling single of 1983 in the US and ninth in the UK. &quot;Billie Jean&quot; also reached number one in Canada, Switzerland and Belgium, and the top ten in Austria, Italy, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden.

&quot;Billboard&quot; called it a &quot;brilliant piece of writing&quot; and &quot;one of [Jackson&#x27;s] finest performances.&quot; In a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review, Christopher Connelly described &quot;Billie Jean&quot; as a &quot;lean, insistent funk number whose message couldn&#x27;t be more blunt: &#x27;She says I am the one/But the kid is not my son&#x27;&quot;. He added that the track was a &quot;sad, almost mournful song, but a thumping resolve underlies [Jackson&#x27;s] feelings&quot;. &quot;Blender&quot; stated that the song was &quot;one of the most sonically eccentric, psychologically fraught, downright bizarre things ever to land on Top 40 radio&quot;. They added that it was &quot;frighteningly stark, with a pulsing, cat-on-the-prowl bass figure, whip-crack downbeat and eerie multi-tracked vocals ricocheting in the vast spaces between keyboards and strings&quot;. Overall, the magazine described the track as &quot;a five-minute-long nervous breakdown, set to a beat&quot;. &quot;Stylus&quot; said of the song, &quot;It&#x27;s one of the best representations of film noir in pop music, ending with no resolution except a single mother and selfish, careless scumball.&quot; In a review of &quot;Thriller 25&quot;, AllMusic observed that &quot;Billie Jean&quot; was &quot;startling&quot; in its &quot;futuristic funk&quot;. The track also won praise from Jackson biographers. Nelson George stated that Jerry Hey&#x27;s string arrangement added danger to &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, while J. Randy Taraborrelli added that it was &quot;dark and sparse&quot; by Quincy Jones&#x27; production standards.

&quot;Billie Jean&quot; has been recognized with numerous awards and honors. At the 1984 Grammy Awards the song earned Jackson two of a record eight awards; Best R&amp;B Song and Best R&amp;B Male Vocal Performance. It won the Billboard Music Award for favorite dance/disco 12&quot; LP, and the magazine&#x27;s 1980&#x27;s poll named &quot;Billie Jean&quot; as the &quot;Black Single of the Decade&quot;. The American Music Awards recognized the track as the Favorite Pop/Rock Single, while &quot;Cash Box&quot; honored the song with the awards for Top Pop Single and Top Black Single. The track was recognized with the Top International Single award by the Canadian Black Music Awards and awarded the Black Gold Award for Single of the Year. &quot;Billie Jean&quot; has also been awarded for its sales. It won the National Association of Recording Merchandisers Gift of Music award for best-selling single in 1984. By 1989, the standard format single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, for shipments of at least one million units. The digital sales of &quot;Billie Jean&quot; were certified gold in 2005, for shipments of at least 500,000 units. In May 2014, a viral video of a high school-aged teenager imitating Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Motown 25&quot; performance of the song helped the song re-enter the Billboard Hot 100 at number 14, with much of its chart performance was 95% credited to streams of the viral video. On August 29, 2022, the digital sales of &quot;Billie Jean&quot; were certified Diamond in US.

&quot;Billie Jean&quot; enters the &quot;Billboard&quot; Global 200 chart where it peaked at 119 on the issue date October 26, 2024.

==Music video==

MTV initially refused to air the video for &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, as the network&#x27;s executives felt black music did not fit into its &quot;rock&quot;-centered programming at the time. Enraged by their refusal despite Jackson&#x27;s success as a musical artist, Walter Yetnikoff, the president of Jackson&#x27;s record company CBS Records, threatened to expose MTV&#x27;s stance on racial discrimination: &quot;I said to MTV, &#x27;I&#x27;m pulling everything we have off the air, all our product. I&#x27;m not going to give you any more videos. And I&#x27;m going to go public and fucking tell them about the fact you don&#x27;t want to play music by a black guy.&#x27;&quot; MTV relented and premiered the &quot;Billie Jean&quot; music video on March 10, 1983. After the video was aired in heavy rotation, &quot;Thriller&quot; went on to sell an additional 10 million copies. It was one of the first videos by a black artist to be aired regularly by the channel.

Directed by Steve Barron and produced by Gowers Fields Flattery, the video shows a photographer who follows but never catches Jackson, as when photographed Jackson fails to materialize on the developed picture. Jackson dances to Billie Jean&#x27;s hotel room and as he walks along a sidewalk, each tile lights up at his touch. After performing a quick spin, he jumps and lands, freeze framed, on his toes. Upon arrival at the hotel, he climbs the staircase to Billie Jean&#x27;s room, lighting up each step as he touches it and illuminating a burnt-out &quot;Hotel&quot; sign as he passes it. The paparazzo then arrives at the scene and watches as Jackson vanishes under the covers of Billie Jean&#x27;s bed, before the police arrive and arrest him for spying on Billie Jean. As the paparazzo is led away, he drops a tiger-print cloth that Jackson had left behind after polishing his shoe with it earlier in the video. (On both occasions, the cloth briefly transforms into a tiger cub.) Once the street is empty, the paving tiles again light up in sequence, reversing Jackson&#x27;s earlier progress.

Jackson&#x27;s new look for the video, a black leather suit with a pink shirt and a red bow tie, was copied by children around the US. Imitation became so severe that, despite pupil protests, Bound Brook High School forbade students from wearing a single white glove like Jackson had on during the performance of &quot;Billie Jean&quot; at &quot;Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever&quot;.

The short film was inducted into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame in 1992. In a 2005 poll of 31 pop stars, video directors, agents, and journalists conducted by telecommunications company 3, the music video was ranked fifth in their &quot;Top 20 Music Videos Ever&quot;. The video was also ranked as the 35th greatest music video in a list compiled by MTV and &quot;TV Guide&quot; at the millennium. On June 10, 2021, &quot;Billie Jean&quot; became the first 1980s clip by a solo artist to reach 1 billion views on YouTube.

==&quot;Motown 25&quot; performance==

Jackson performed &quot;Billie Jean&quot; on the television special &quot;Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever&quot;, broadcast on May 15, 1983. The special was recorded on March 25 as a celebration of Motown Records&#x27; twenty-fifth anniversary (Motown was launched in 1959). The event featured many popular Motown acts, past and present. Jackson initially refused an invitation to reunite with the Jackson 5 for a performance, but reconsidered after a visit from Motown founder Berry Gordy, whom Jackson respected. Jackson asked to also perform &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, to which Gordy agreed. Following performances by Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, and Mary Wells, the Jacksons sang a medley of their early 1970s hits. Jermaine Jackson was on stage with the group, marking the first time that the original Jackson 5 lineup had performed together since they left Motown in 1975. After the group performed &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot;, they left Michael alone on stage.

Jackson wore black pants, leather penny loafers, a black sequined jacket, and a single white rhinestone glove. He addressed the audience, and then &quot;Billie Jean&quot; started playing. (Jackson lip-synced the entire song, because organizers feared that the evening&#x27;s backing band could not replicate the sound of the recording.) To begin his performance, Jackson snapped a fedora to his head and struck a pose—his right hand on his hat and his left leg bent. During the song&#x27;s instrumental interlude, he executed a move that many believe sealed his status as a pop icon. Jackson glided backwards to perform the moonwalk, before he spun on his heels and landed &quot;en pointe&quot;. It was the first time Jackson had performed the moonwalk in public; he had practiced it in his kitchen prior to the show.

Many, including Jackson biographer Steve Knopper, have speculated that Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Billie Jean&quot; costuming and choreography were specifically inspired by a dance routine performed by Bob Fosse in the 1974 musical film &quot;The Little Prince&quot;. In that film, Fosse, playing &quot;The Snake&quot;, sings the song &quot;A Snake in the Grass&quot; and performs an accompanying dance that Fosse himself choreographed. The dance includes a variety of techniques that seemed to be echoed in Jackson&#x27;s routine, including trademark Fosse elements such as hip thrusts, bent knees, shoulder isolations, jazz hands and kicks, as well a brief moonwalk. Jackson openly acknowledged Fosse as a dance influence, having told Fosse himself that he had amassed a complete home collection of Fosse&#x27;s choreography work in film and television, which he watched frequently. However, Jackson never specifically cited the &quot;Snake in the Grass&quot; routine as an inspiration.

&quot;Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever&quot; was watched by 50 million people and Jackson&#x27;s routine earned him an Emmy nomination. With the performance, Jackson reached a new audience and increased the sales of &quot;Thriller&quot;, which eventually became the best-selling album of all-time. The day after the show aired, Jackson was called by his childhood idol Fred Astaire, who commended him. Another childhood idol, Sammy Davis Jr., had admired Jackson&#x27;s black sequined jacket during the performance and later received it as a gift.

Jackson stated at the time that he was disappointed in his performance; he had wanted to remain on his toes longer than he had. Jackson subsequently said that &quot;Billie Jean&quot; was one of his favorite songs to perform live, but only when he did not have to do it the way he had on &quot;Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever&quot;. &quot;The audience wants a certain thing—I have to do the moonwalk in that spot,&quot; he later said. &quot;I&#x27;d like to do a different version.&quot;

In a Top 100 list compiled by VH1 and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 2000, Jackson&#x27;s performance was ranked as the sixth greatest rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll TV moment. Five years later, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Motown 25&quot; performance as one of the most important pop culture moments in history. &quot;It was a moment that crossed over in a way that no live musical performance ever had. There was a messianic quality to it&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; editor Steve Daly commented. David Moynihan of &quot;NME&quot; wrote in 2009 that &quot;Jackson&#x27;s status as the world&#x27;s biggest superstar was confirmed&quot; by the &quot;Motown 25&quot; performance.

==Pepsi commercials==
In 1984, Pepsi sponsored the Jacksons&#x27; Victory Tour. In return, Michael and his brothers were to star in two commercials for the company. Jackson had reworked &quot;Billie Jean&quot; for the commercial and titled it &quot;Pepsi Generation&quot;. The song was used as the official jingle for the commercials and released as a 7&quot; promo single. The launch of &quot;The Choice of a New Generation&quot; campaign in February 1984 was attended by 1,600 people who were issued with a programme and the 7&quot; single. During the filming of the second commercial, a firework in the rear of the set was prematurely detonated, setting Jackson&#x27;s hair ablaze. The incident necessitated reconstructive surgery. The commercials were premiered at the Grammy Awards, the same night he collected a record eight awards.

==Billie Jean 2008==
Michael Jackson&#x27;s original version of &quot;Billie Jean&quot; was remixed by Kanye West for &quot;Thriller 25&quot;, a 25th anniversary reissue of Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;. Titled &quot;Billie Jean 2008&quot;, the remix garnered a mixed reception; most critics felt that it was impossible to improve upon the original. &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot;″s Tom Ewing stated that the remix would have benefited from a guest verse by West, which &quot;might have added dynamics to the mix&#x27;s clumsy claustrophobia&quot;.

Mike Joseph, in a review of &quot;Thriller 25&quot; for &quot;PopMatters&quot;, described the track listing of the reissue as &quot;pleasant&quot; but that West&#x27;s &quot;lazy&quot; remix was the only exception. He added, &quot;You&#x27;ve been given the opportunity to remix the most iconic single from one of the most iconic albums of all time, and all you can do is stick a drum machine on top of the song&#x27;s original arrangement?&quot;. Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; disliked the removal of the original bassline, and compared it to &quot;putting Bobby Orr on the ice without a hockey stick&quot;. IGN&#x27;s Todd Gilchrist praised West&#x27;s remix and stated that it was a &quot;pretty great track&quot;. He added, &quot;it almost overplays the track&#x27;s originally understated drama, his additions enhance the song and demonstrate that in a contemporary context.&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;Billie Jean&quot; aided &quot;Thriller&quot; in becoming the biggest selling album of all time.

It was popularly believed that &quot;Billie Jean&quot; was an autobiographical song, referring to someone who claimed Jackson was the father of her child. Based on this theory, Lydia Murdock wrote the song &quot;Superstar&quot;, which was a minor hit in 1983, intending this song as a criticism of Jackson&#x27;s purported denial of paternity. Another song referred to as an &quot;answer song&quot; was a rap song by T-Ski Valley. The song &quot;Valley Style&quot; was actually reviewed by James Hamilton in the 30 July issue of &quot;Record Mirror&quot;. He referred to both Lydia Murdock&#x27;s and T-Ski Valley&#x27;s recordings as answer versions to &quot;Billie Jean&quot; but with a question mark for T-Ski Valley&#x27;s rap version.

On his &quot;Late Night&quot; program in the 1980s, host David Letterman often played a recording of a song with the word &quot;chair&quot; replacing &quot;kid&quot; to create the mondegreen &quot;the chair is not my son&quot;.

Frequently listed in magazine polls of the best songs ever made, &quot;Billie Jean&quot; was named the greatest dance record of all time by BBC Radio 2 listeners. In a list compiled by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and MTV in 2000, the song was ranked as the sixth greatest pop song since 1963.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the song at number 58 on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2004. In the 2021 update of the list it had risen to 44. &quot;Billie Jean&quot; was voted number 2 in &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Favourite Number 1 Single&quot;, a British TV program airing on ITV on 21 July 2012. In a similar poll in 2015 the song was voted by the British public as the nation&#x27;s second favorite 1980s number one.

In an interview, Pharrell Williams stated that &quot;Billie Jean&quot; was one of his favorite songs. &quot;It is hard to say if there is a greater song than &#x27;Billie Jean&#x27;. I think there will never be a song like this one again, with this bassline, with this kind of effect, this eternalness, this perfection.&quot; When re-released as part of the &quot;&quot; campaign in 2006, &quot;Billie Jean&quot; charted at No. 11 in the UK. It remained in the top 200 for over 40 weeks and was the most successful reissue by some distance. According to &quot;Thriller 25: The Book&quot; (2008), &quot;Billie Jean&quot; is still in heavy rotation; it receives more than 250,000 spins per week in clubs around the world.

==Other cover versions==
English musician Ian Brown took &quot;Billie Jean&quot; to number 5 on the UK charts in 2000. It was the B-side of &quot;Dolphins Were Monkeys&quot;. Brown said, &quot;I love Jackson. I want to do a Jackson EP with &#x27;Thriller&#x27;, &#x27;Beat It&#x27;, &#x27;Billie Jean&#x27; and &#x27;Rockin&#x27; Robin&#x27; or &#x27;ABC&#x27; on it. Hopefully I&#x27;ll get it done&quot;. Brown later covered &quot;Thriller&quot; on &quot;Golden Gaze&quot;, from his second solo album, &quot;Golden Greats&quot;.

American rock musician Chris Cornell recorded &quot;Billie Jean&quot; for his &quot;Carry On&quot; album in 2007. Cornell said of his cover, &quot;I didn&#x27;t plan on it. It just sort of happened organically. I changed the music quite a bit, I didn&#x27;t touch the lyrics.&quot; He added, &quot;And it&#x27;s not a joke. I took a completely different approach to it, musically.&quot; Cornell had previously performed the song live in Europe, including an acoustic set in Stockholm, Sweden in September 2006. He later said, &quot;I was getting ready to do some acoustic shows on a promotional tour for &quot;Revelations&quot; and I just wanted to have fun with it.&quot; The cover received favorable reviews from critics. MTV noted the &quot;bluesier, more pained and impassioned feel&quot; which stripped away &quot;any pop elements of the original&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the track as &quot;a grim, spooky take&quot; on Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, and added that it was &quot;amusing enough, even if it sounds a lot more like Metallica&#x27;s &#x27;Nothing Else Matters&#x27;&quot;. The newspaper concluded that &quot;Jacko&#x27;s mega hit [survived] the stunt translation&quot;. In 2008, Cornell&#x27;s version was performed live by David Cook on the seventh season of &quot;American Idol&quot;, and this version charted on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 at No. 47.

In 2011, Fall Out Boy frontman Patrick Stump covered the song as part of an a cappella medley of Michael Jackson songs, in which he sang all the parts.

In 2015, Irish musician EDEN released a remix of &quot;Billie Jean&quot; then separately released a cover of the song with his own vocals.

In 2022, a clip from the HBO sports documentary series &quot;Hard Knocks&quot; went viral, where Detroit Lions defensive end Aidan Hutchinson sang the song in front of the team as part of a rookie talent show.

==Mashups and remixes==
In 1983, Italian studio group Club House recorded what would now be known as a mashup of &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and the 1972 Steely Dan song &quot;Do It Again&quot;, titled &quot;Do It Again Medley with Billie Jean&quot;. The song was a top ten hit in Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands. American band Slingshot recorded a note-for-note remake of the song later that same year; this version hit number one on the Billboard Dance/Disco charts.

A DJ named Linx created a mashup of &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and the 1987 Eric B. &amp; Rakim song &quot;I Know You Got Soul&quot; from the original recordings, releasing it in 1997 as &quot;Billie Jean (Got Soul)&quot;. This mashup peaked at number 34 in Sweden.

2manyDJs included a mashup of &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, Soulwax&#x27;s &quot;Saturday&quot; and The Residents&#x27; &quot;Kaw-Liga&quot; in their mix album &quot;As Heard On Radio Soulwax Pt. 2&quot;.

Scottish bhangra group Tigerstyle&#x27;s song &quot;Nachna Onda Nei&quot; includes the backing tracks of both &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and &quot;Under Pressure&quot; by Queen and David Bowie, with new vocals by Kaka Bhaniawala. In April 2008, dance act Signature used &quot;Nachna Onda Nei&quot; on &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; in their audition and again in their final performance.

<text>Intense pulsed light (IPL) is a technology used by cosmetic and medical practitioners to perform various skin treatments for aesthetic and therapeutic purposes, including hair removal, photorejuvenation (e.g. the treatment of skin pigmentation, sun damage, and thread veins) as well as to alleviate dermatologic diseases such as acne. IPL is increasingly used in optometry and ophthalmology as well, to treat evaporative dry eye disease due to meibomian gland dysfunction. The most common use of IPL is in home based hair removal[31], where over one million devices were sold to consumers for hair removal at home in 2022 https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/product/home-ipl-hair-removal-devices-market/?utm_source=chatgpt.com/. 

The technology uses a high-powered, hand-held, computer-controlled linear flashlamp to deliver an intense, visible and near infra-red, broad-spectrum pulse of light, generally in the range of 400 to 1200 nm. Various cut-on filters are commonly used to selectively filter out shorter wavelengths, especially potentially damaging ultraviolet and longer wavelength infra-red light. The resulting light has a spectral range that targets specific structures and chromophores (e.g. melanin in hair, or oxyhemoglobin in blood vessels) that are heated to destruction and reabsorbed by the body. IPL shares some similarities with laser treatments, in that they both use light to heat and induce a biologic effect in their targets. But unlike lasers that use a single wavelength (color) of light which typically matches only one chromophore and hence only treats one condition, IPL uses a broad spectrum that when used with interchangeable filters, allowing it to be used against several conditions. This can be achieved when the IPL technician selects the appropriate filter that matches a specific chromophore.

==Description==
&quot;Intense pulsed light&quot; is the use of intense pulses of non-coherent light over a range of wavelengths from approximately 500 nm to approximately 1200 nm. Linear Xenon flashlamps produce high output bursts of broad spectrum. The flashlamp is typically cooled by water flow in a glass tube concentric with the flashlamp. In addition to its cooling of the flashlamp, the water envelope also filters out longer wavelength infrared light that is heavily absorbed in water and could damage the patient&#x27;s skin that has a high concentration of water. Light generated by the flashlamp is typically coupled to the skin by cooled (in many cases) lightguides which are also used to protect the skin in contact with the device. 

Regulations governing IPL vary by jurisdiction. A distinction is sometimes made between beauty-grade and medical-grade machines, mainly to get around regulations.

IPL was invented in 1992 by Shimon Eckhouse who wrote the first patent describing the technology in detail (US patent No. 5,405,368 filed in 1992 and granted in 1995). The first medical use of IPL was aimed at the treatment of vascular lesions and introduced to the medical market by ESC Medical which was founded by Shimon Eckhouse to develop and commercialize the technology. The first FDA approval of IPL for treatment of vascular lesions was granted to ESC Medical in 1995 with additional FDA clearances for treatment of pigmented lesions and hair removal granted in 1996 and 1997 respectively. Use quickly spread to a variety of medical and cosmetic settings. Treatment is generally safe and effective, but complications can occur, such as hyperpigmentation. The polychromatic light can reach multiple chromophores in human skin: mainly hemoglobin, water, and melanin. This results in selective photothermolysis of blood vessels, pigmented cells, or hair follicles.

==Hair removal==
IPL can reduce hair growth, most effectively in darker, coarser hair. IPL is distinct from laser hair removal which uses coherent monochromatic laser light.

=== Protocol ===
Broad-spectrum light is applied to the surface of the skin, targeting melanin. This light travels through the skin until it strikes the hair shafts or hair follicle. The follicle is usually where the highest concentration of melanin is located. As the light is absorbed, the bulb and most of the hair shaft are heated, destroying the hair-producing papilla. It is also claimed that heat conversion occurs directly in the darker capillaries that bring blood to the follicle.

At any one time, not all hair follicles are &#x27;active&#x27;, and only active hair follicles can be affected by the treatment. &#x27;Inactive&#x27; hair follicles can be treated as they become &#x27;active&#x27; over time. For IPL treatments, an average of 8–10 treatments, 4–6 weeks apart, are required to remove most visible hair.

There is no common treatment protocol, as it depends on the equipment used and patient skin type. The area to be treated should be clean shaven and free of sunburn.

Although IPL treatments will permanently reduce the total number of body hairs, they will not result in a permanent removal of all hair.

Certain skin conditions, health irregularities, and medications can impact whether it is safe for a person to receive a light-based hair removal treatment. Photo-sensitizing medications, or damage to the skin are contraindications to treatment. According to Remington, manufacturer of an IPL device, all IPL and laser devices should only be used on light to medium skin tones, and work best on darker hair.

===Efficacy===
In August 1997, IPL was reported to have permanently removed terminal hair in two patients who underwent multiple treatments to their beards. In October of that year, the first IPL system developed for hair removal and resulted in 60% hair reduction after 12 weeks.

It is important to note that these studies utilized a variety of IPL devices on patients with various hair types, skin types, and targeted skin areas. Thus the results are not directly comparable.

According to the FDA, permanent hair reduction means the &quot;long-term, stable reduction in the number of hairs regrowing after a treatment regime.&quot; In other words, the number of hairs regrowing must be consistently greater than the duration of the complete growth cycle of hair follicles, which varies from four to twelve months by body location. IPL has been found to be much less effective than laser hair removal; however, many patients experience satisfaction with significant hair reduction.

A 2006 article in the journal &quot;Lasers in Medical Science&quot; compared IPL and both alexandrite and diode lasers. The review found no statistical difference in effectiveness, but a higher incidence of side effects with diode laser treatment. Hair reduction after six months was reported as 68.75% for alexandrite lasers, 71.71% for diode lasers, and 66.96% for IPL. Side effects were reported as 9.5% for alexandrite lasers, 28.9% for diode lasers, and 15.3% for IPL. All side effects were found to be temporary and even pigmentation changes returned to normal within six months.

A 2009 study evaluated the rate of hair removal after a second generation IPL source. Results found that patients had 75% hair reduction after four months, and up to 80% after eight months.

==Medical use==

IPL was first developed for vascular conditions. It is at least as effective as pulsed dye lasers and can penetrate deeper with reduced risk of purpura and hyperpigmentation. IPL can also be used for the treatment of dry eye conditions such as meibomian gland dysfunction. IPL can treat pigmented lesions with rapid recovery. Dyschromia can be cleared after repeated sessions. Photoaging treatment has been explored. A series of IPL can be used for facial rejuvenation, improving skin laxity and collagen production. IPL combined with facial injections can be used for dynamic rhytids. Home IPL devices have been developed.

IPL is employed in the treatment of a range of dermatological conditions including photodamage induced dyspigmentation and vascular changes, poikiloderma of Civatte, rosacea, acne vulgaris, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, broken capillaries, telangiectases, vascular lesions (small blood vessels), pigmented lesions (freckles, liver spots, birth marks ), melasma, actinic keratosis, photorejuvenation, basal cell carcinoma, and Bowen&#x27;s disease (squamous cell carcinoma).

<doc id="298544" wikidata="Q7914639" url="?curid=298544" title="Vanessa Feltz">
<text>Vanessa Jane Feltz (born 21 February 1962) is an English television personality, broadcaster, and journalist. She has appeared on various television shows, including &quot;Vanessa&quot; (1994–1998), &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; (1996–1998), &quot;The Vanessa Show&quot; (1999), &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; (2001), &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot; (2003–2005), &quot;This Morning&quot; (2006–present), and &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; (2013).

Feltz presented an early morning radio show on BBC Radio 2 from 2011 to 2022 and also hosted the &quot;Breakfast Show&quot; on BBC Radio London. As of December 2024 Feltz works for LBC.

==Early life==
Vanessa Feltz was born in Islington, London, and grew up in Pine Grove, Totteridge. She has a sister, Julia, who is 3 years her junior. During her broadcasting career, she frequently refers to Totteridge as &quot;the Beverly Hills of North London&quot; and her middle class Jewish background as like &quot;growing up in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;&quot;. Her father, Norman, was in the lingerie business.

Feltz was educated at Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s School for Girls, an independent school in Elstree, Hertfordshire. She then read English at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating with a first-class degree.

==Career==
=== 1980s and 1990s: Early career ===
Feltz was the first female columnist for &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; and later joined the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. She wrote her first book at this time entitled &quot;What Are These Strawberries Doing on My Nipples? I Need Them for the Fruit Salad&quot;.

Feltz replaced Paula Yates on Channel 4&#x27;s morning TV show &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, presenting a regular item where she interviewed celebrities whilst lying on a bed. She has alleged that she was sexually assaulted by Rolf Harris while interviewing him on the programme. In 1997, Feltz was tricked by the spoof TV show &quot;Brass Eye&quot;. She also served as a magistrate from the age of 28, but was asked to stand down when she became recognisable by the defendants from her TV appearances.

She presented the ITV daytime television chat show, &quot;Vanessa&quot;, made by Anglia Television. She moved to the BBC to host a similar show, &quot;The Vanessa Show&quot;, in 1998 in a reported £2.7 million deal. ITV replaced her show with &quot;Trisha&quot;.

In 1999, &quot;The Vanessa Show&quot; suffered from bad publicity as some guests were alleged to have been actors. Despite her having had no involvement in the booking of guests, Feltz was seen to be at fault, and the show was cancelled soon after.

===2000s===
In 2001, Feltz joined the local radio station BBC London 94.9 to present a mid-afternoon phone-in show and it continued to run since then at various times, from 2005 to 2015 at 09.00 to noon. From 2016 it was broadcast from 07.00 to 10.00 Monday to Friday. She hosted her last show for the station on 26 August 2022.

In 2002, she made a cameo appearance in the comedy film &quot;Once Upon a Time in the Midlands&quot;. In May 2003, she was voted 93rd on the list of worst Britons in Channel 4&#x27;s poll of the &quot;100 Worst Britons&quot;.

Feltz&#x27;s other game show appearances include an episode of &quot;Russian Roulette&quot;, hosted by Rhona Cameron.

===2010s===

Feltz returned to the Big Brother house on 3 September 2010 during &quot;Ultimate Big Brother&quot;, the last series to be broadcast on Channel 4. She was evicted from the house on 8 September, two days before the final.

Feltz took on a greater workload of radio and TV presenting in 2011. She took over the BBC Radio 2 &quot;Early Breakfast Show&quot; on 17 January 2011 broadcasting from 05:00 until 06:30 each weekday in the slot formerly occupied by Sarah Kennedy. Writing of her Radio 2 debut, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; radio critic, Gillian Reynolds described Feltz&#x27;s voice as &quot;like lemon tea with honey&quot;. From January 2021, her show was extended by an hour and began at the earlier time of 04:00. She often covered Jeremy Vine&#x27;s news and current affairs show on Radio 2 when Vine was away. During this time her early breakfast show was covered by another presenter, usually Nicki Chapman. Feltz announced on 28 July 2022 that she would leave the show the following day, and Radio 2 after 2 weeks of covering for Jeremy Vine on 26 August.

On 7 March 2011, Channel 5 moved &quot;The Vanessa Show&quot; to an afternoon slot at 14:15 following disappointing ratings for the morning slot. The move allowed Feltz to appear in live editions of her TV show after her morning radio commitments. Ratings eventually improved and a second series of the show was planned to commence in September 2011 but it never went ahead. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s &quot;Media Monkey&quot; blog dubbed Feltz &quot;officially the hardest working woman in broadcasting&quot; due to her weekday broadcasting commitments.

On 7 September 2013, she re-entered the &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; house to take part in a task. She left the house the same day.

In July 2019, the BBC Annual Report recorded that Feltz was one of three women, along with Claudia Winkleman and Zoe Ball, amongst the ten highest paid BBC presenters, with a salary of £355,000.

===2020s===
In January 2024, it was reported that over 2,000 complaints had been made to Ofcom regarding Feltz&#x27;s comments on coeliac disease during an episode of &quot;This Morning&quot;. After a caller said their mother-in-law did not allow them to serve anything but gluten-free food at Christmas dinner, Feltz responded &quot;So she&#x27;s treating coeliac disease as if it&#x27;s a potentially fatal peanut allergy and they can&#x27;t have anything with gluten in the house, which is completely unreasonable.&quot; She later apologised for the comments.

From September 2022 to April 2024, she presented the weekday drivetime show on Talkradio and TalkTV. On 1 May 2024, it was announced Feltz had signed to present a 3pm–6pm show on Saturday afternoons on LBC. In November of the same year, it was announced that Feltz would also present on Sunday afternoons from 3pm to 6pm on the same station.

In May 2024, she appeared on &quot;Late Night Lycett&quot; as a wrestling commentator for a Kamikaze Pro wrestling event. At the end of the show, she wrestled Man Like Dereiss, pinning him to win her debut match.

==Personal life==
Feltz married surgeon Michael Kurer in 1983; they divorced in 2000. 

In December 2006, Feltz became engaged to singer Ben Ofoedu. They originally planned to marry the following year but they remained engaged for many years without marrying. Feltz announced in February 2023 that she and Ofoedu had recently separated.

She has two daughters from her marriage, and four grandchildren. Her elder daughter is Allegra Benitah, a former tax lawyer who is now a television baker and chef.

She lives in St John&#x27;s Wood, London, in a house which was previously owned by Charles Saatchi, and which was featured in Sir John Betjeman&#x27;s documentary &quot;MetroLand&quot; (1973).

<doc id="298546" wikidata="Q478601" url="?curid=298546" title="Tony Wilson">
<text>Anthony Howard Wilson (20 February 1950 – 10 August 2007) was a British record label owner, radio and television presenter, nightclub manager and impresario, and a journalist for Granada Television, the BBC and Channel 4.

As a co-founder of the independent label Factory Records and founder-manager of the Haçienda nightclub, Wilson was behind some of Manchester&#x27;s most successful bands, including Joy Division, New Order, and Happy Mondays. Wilson was known as &quot;Mr Manchester&quot;, dubbed as such for his work in promoting the culture of Manchester throughout his career.

Wilson was portrayed by Steve Coogan in Michael Winterbottom&#x27;s film &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; (2002), and by Craig Parkinson in Anton Corbijn&#x27;s film &quot;Control&quot; (2007).

==Early life==
Wilson was born 20 February 1950 in Hope Hospital, Pendleton, Salford, Lancashire, to Sydney Wilson and Doris Knupfer, and moved to Marple, near Stockport, Cheshire, at the age of five. After passing his Eleven plus exam, Wilson attended De La Salle Grammar School in Weaste Lane, Pendleton, Salford. He developed a love of literature and language, ignited by a performance of &quot;Hamlet&quot; at Stratford upon Avon. Wilson started his professional career in 1968 at the age of 17, working as an English and Drama teacher at Blue Coat School in Oldham. He later graduated with a degree in English from Jesus College, Cambridge.

==Broadcasting career==
After his graduation in 1971, Wilson began as a trainee news reporter for ITN, before moving to Manchester in 1973, where he secured a post at Granada Television. He presented Granada&#x27;s culture, music and events programme, &quot;So It Goes&quot;. Through the 1970s and 1980s he was one of the main anchors on &quot;Granada Reports&quot;, a regional evening news programme, where he worked with Judy Finnigan and Richard Madeley among others. He continued in this line of work even at the height of his success in the music industry.

Wilson reported for ITV&#x27;s current affairs series &quot;World in Action&quot; in the early 1980s and hosted editions of &quot;After Dark&quot;, the UK&#x27;s first open-ended chat show, first on Channel 4 and later BBC Four. Journalist Fergal Kinney wrote in 2021: “His appearances on Channel 4’s freewheeling late-night debate show &quot;After Dark&quot;...are exhilarating, pitched somewhere between a malevolent David Dimbleby and a slightly effete Jonathan Meades.” Paul Morley&#x27;s book &quot;From Manchester with Love: The Life and Opinions of Tony Wilson&quot; quotes Wilson as nearly falling asleep on the programme but waking up to hear one of the guests attacking him for naming his band Joy Division.

In 1988, Wilson hosted &quot;The Other Side of Midnight&quot;, another Granada weekly regional culture slot, covering music, literature and the arts in general. Wilson co-presented the BBC&#x27;s coverage of &quot;The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert&quot; at Wembley Stadium with Lisa I&#x27;Anson in 1992. He hosted the short-lived TV quiz shows &quot;Topranko!&quot; and Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Remote Control&quot; in the 1990s, as well as the Manchester United themed quiz, &quot;Masterfan&quot;, for MUTV.

In 2006 he became the regional political presenter for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Politics Show&quot;. He presented a weekly radio show on Xfm Manchester – &quot;Sunday Roast&quot; – and a show on BBC Radio Manchester. In October he joined Blur bassist Alex James, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; presenter Konnie Huq and previously unknown presenter Emily Rose to host the 21st century version of the 1980s music programme, &quot;The Tube&quot;, for Channel 4 Radio which ran until 2 March 2007. His final music TV show was filmed in December 2006 for Manchester&#x27;s Channel M. Only one episode, entitled &quot;The New Friday&quot;, was recorded before Wilson became ill.

==Music career==

Wilson&#x27;s involvement in popular music stemmed from hosting Granada&#x27;s culture and music programme &quot;So It Goes&quot;. Wilson, who intensely disliked the music scene of the mid-1970s which was dominated by such genres as disco, progressive rock and arena rock, saw the Sex Pistols at Manchester&#x27;s Lesser Free Trade Hall, in June 1976, an experience which he described as &quot;nothing short of an epiphany&quot;. He booked them for the last episode of the first series.

Wilson was the manager of many bands, including A Certain Ratio and the Durutti Column, and was part owner and manager of Factory Records, home of Happy Mondays, Joy Division and New Order – the band managed by friend and business partner Rob Gretton. He also founded and managed the Haçienda nightclub and Dry Bar. The scene was termed &quot;Madchester&quot; in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He made little money from Factory Records or the Haçienda, despite the enormous popularity and cultural significance of both endeavours. 

In 2000, Wilson and his business partners launched an early online music store, Music33.

A semi-fictionalised version of his life and of the surrounding era was made into the film &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; (2002), which stars Steve Coogan as Wilson. After the film was produced, Wilson wrote a novelisation based on the screenplay. He played a minor role (as himself) in the film &quot;A Cock and Bull Story&quot; (2005), in which he interviews Coogan. Wilson also co-produced the Ian Curtis biopic, &quot;Control&quot; (2007), being portrayed on this occasion by Craig Parkinson. 

Wilson was a partner in the annual In the City and Interactive City music festivals and industry conferences, and also F4 Records, the fourth version of Factory Records.

==Politics==
Wilson identified himself as a socialist and refused to pay for private healthcare on principle. Wilson was also an outspoken supporter of regionalism. Along with others including Ruth Turner, he started a campaign for North West England to be allowed a referendum on the creation of a regional assembly, called the &quot;Necessary Group&quot; after a line in the United States Declaration of Independence. Although his campaign was successful, with the British government announcing that a vote would take place, this was later abandoned when North East England voted against the introduction of a regional tier of government. Wilson later spoke at several political events on this subject. He was also known for using Situationist ideas.

==Relationships==
Wilson was married twice, first to Lindsay Reade and then to Hilary Sherlock, with whom he had a son, Oliver, and a daughter, Isabel. In 1990 he started a relationship with Yvette Livesey, a former Miss England and Miss UK, who was his girlfriend until his death in 2007.
Livesey has since co-operated with a biography of Wilson&#x27;s life, called &quot;You&#x27;re Entitled to an Opinion ...&quot;, written by David Nolan and published in 2009.

==Illness==
After Wilson developed renal cancer and had one kidney removed in 2007, doctors recommended he take the drug Sutent. Manchester Primary Care NHS Trust refused to fund the £3,500 per month cost of providing the drug, while patients being treated alongside him at the Christie Hospital and living just a few miles away in Cheshire did receive funding for the medication. A number of Wilson&#x27;s music industry friends, including former Happy Mondays manager Nathan McGough, their current manager Elliot Rashman and TV stars Richard Madeley and Judy Finnegan, formed a fund to help pay for Wilson&#x27;s medical treatment.

Wilson said: &quot;This [Sutent] is my only real option. It is not a cure but can hold the cancer back, so I will probably be on it until I die. When they said I would have to pay £3,500 for the drugs each month, I thought where am I going to find the money? I&#x27;m the one person in this industry who famously has never made any money. I used to say &#x27;some people make money and some make history&#x27;, which is very funny until you find you can&#x27;t afford to keep yourself alive. I&#x27;ve never paid for private healthcare because I&#x27;m a socialist. Now I find you can get tummy tucks and cosmetic surgery on the NHS but not the drugs I need to stay alive. It is a scandal.&quot;

==Death and legacy==

In early 2007, emergency surgery was performed to remove one of Wilson’s kidneys. This forced the postponement of plans to create a Southern Hemisphere version of the In the City festival. Despite the surgery, the cancer progressed and a course of chemotherapy was ineffective. Wilson died of a heart attack in Manchester&#x27;s Christie Hospital on 10 August 2007 aged 57. Following the news of his death, the Union Flag on Manchester Town Hall was lowered to half mast as a mark of respect. 

Probate documents reveal his estate was valued at £484,747 after tax. That figure includes the value of his city centre flat on Little Peter Street. The will, signed by Wilson on 4 July 2007, gave Yvette Livesey, 39, his girlfriend of 17 years, the proceeds from their home. He also left her his share of six businesses. His son Oliver and daughter Isabel shared the rest of his estate.
Wilson’s funeral was at St Mary&#x27;s RC Church, Mulberry Street, Manchester (The Hidden Gem) on 20 August 2007. Among the music, he chose Happy Mondays’ &quot;Bob’s Yer Uncle&quot;. As with everything else in the Factory empire, Wilson&#x27;s coffin was given a Factory catalogue number: FAC 501. He is buried at Southern Cemetery in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester. His black granite headstone, erected in October 2010, was designed by Peter Saville and Ben Kelly, and features a quotation, chosen by Wilson&#x27;s family, from Mrs G Linnaeus Banks&#x27;s 1876 novel &quot;The Manchester Man&quot;, set in Rotis serif font. The quotation reads: &quot;Mutability is the epitaph of worlds/ Change alone is changeless/ People drop out of the history of a life as of a land though their work or their influence remains.&quot;

The main square of the HOME/First Street development in Manchester, which opened in 2015, is named Tony Wilson Place.

In memory of Wilson, a poem was written by Mike Garry and broadcast on the BBC.

<text>In biology, immunity is the state of being insusceptible or resistant to a noxious agent or process, especially a pathogen or infectious disease. Immunity may occur naturally or be produced by prior exposure or immunization.

== Innate and adaptive ==
The immune system has innate and adaptive components. Innate immunity is present in all metazoans, immune responses: inflammatory responses and phagocytosis. The adaptive component, on the other hand, involves more advanced lymphatic cells that can distinguish between specific &quot;non-self&quot; substances in the presence of &quot;self&quot;. The reaction to foreign substances is etymologically described as inflammation while the non-reaction to self substances is described as immunity. The two components of the immune system create a dynamic biological environment where &quot;health&quot; can be seen as a physical state where the self is immunologically spared, and what is foreign is inflammatorily and immunologically eliminated. &quot;Disease&quot; can arise when what is foreign cannot be eliminated or what is self is not spared.

Innate immunity, also known as native immunity, is a semi-specific and widely distributed form of immunity. It is defined as the first line of defense against pathogens, representing a critical systemic response to prevent infection and maintain homeostasis, contributing to the activation of an adaptive immune response. It does not adapt to specific external stimulus or a prior infection, but relies on genetically encoded recognition of particular patterns. 

Adaptive or acquired immunity is the active component of the host immune response, mediated by antigen-specific lymphocytes. Unlike the innate immunity, the acquired immunity is highly specific to a particular pathogen, including the development of immunological memory. Like the innate system, the acquired system includes both humoral immunity components and cell-mediated immunity components.

Adaptive immunity can be acquired either &#x27;naturally&#x27; (by infection) or &#x27;artificially&#x27; (through deliberate actions such as vaccination). Adaptive immunity can also be classified as &#x27;active&#x27; or &#x27;passive&#x27;. Active immunity is acquired through the exposure to a pathogen, which triggers the production of antibodies by the immune system. Passive immunity is acquired through the transfer of antibodies or activated T-cells derived from an immune host either artificially or through the placenta; it is short-lived, requiring booster doses for continued immunity.

The diagram below summarizes these divisions of immunity. Adaptive immunity recognizes more diverse patterns. Unlike innate immunity it is associated with memory of the pathogen.

==History of theories==
For thousands of years mankind has been intrigued with the causes of disease and the concept of immunity. The prehistoric view was that disease was caused by supernatural forces, and that illness was a form of theurgic punishment for &quot;bad deeds&quot; or &quot;evil thoughts&quot; visited upon the soul by the gods or by one&#x27;s enemies. In Classical Greek times, Hippocrates, who is regarded as the Father of Medicine, diseases were attributed to an alteration or imbalance in one of the four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile or black bile). The first written descriptions of the concept of immunity may have been made by the Athenian Thucydides who, in 430 BC, described that when the plague hit Athens: &quot;the sick and the dying were tended by the pitying care of those who had recovered, because they knew the course of the disease and were themselves free from apprehensions. For no one was ever attacked a second time, or not with a fatal result&quot;.

Active immunotherapy may have begun with Mithridates VI of Pontus (120-63 BC) who, to induce active immunity for snake venom, recommended using a method similar to modern toxoid serum therapy, by drinking the blood of animals which fed on venomous snakes. He is thought to have assumed that those animals acquired some detoxifying property, so that their blood would contain transformed components of the snake venom that could induce resistance to it instead of exerting a toxic effect. Mithridates reasoned that, by drinking the blood of these animals, he could acquire a similar resistance. Fearing assassination by poison, he took daily sub-lethal doses of venom to build tolerance. He is also said to have sought to create a &#x27;universal antidote&#x27; to protect him from all poisons. For nearly 2000 years, poisons were thought to be the proximate cause of disease, and a complicated mixture of ingredients, called Mithridate, was used to cure poisoning during the Renaissance. An updated version of this cure, Theriacum Andromachi, was used well into the 19th century. The term &quot;immunes&quot; is also found in the epic poem &quot;Pharsalia&quot; written around 60 BC by the poet Marcus Annaeus Lucanus to describe a North African tribe&#x27;s resistance to snake venom.

The first clinical description of immunity which arose from a specific disease-causing organism is probably &quot;A Treatise on Smallpox and Measles&quot; (&quot;Kitab fi al-jadari wa-al-hasbah, translated 1848) written by the Islamic physician Al-Razi in the 9th century. In the treatise, Al Razi describes the clinical presentation of smallpox and measles and goes on to indicate that exposure to these specific agents confers lasting immunity (although he does not use this term).

Until the 19th century, the miasma theory was also widely accepted. The theory viewed diseases such as cholera or the Black Plague as being caused by a miasma, a noxious form of &quot;bad air&quot;. If someone was exposed to the miasma in a swamp, in evening air, or breathing air in a sickroom or hospital ward, they could catch a disease. Since the 19th century, communicable diseases came to be viewed as being caused by germs/microbes.

The modern word &quot;immunity&quot; derives from the Latin immunis, meaning exemption from military service, tax payments or other public services.

The first scientist who developed a full theory of immunity was Ilya Mechnikov who revealed phagocytosis in 1882. With Louis Pasteur&#x27;s germ theory of disease, the fledgling science of immunology began to explain how bacteria caused disease, and how, following infection, the human body gained the ability to resist further infections.
In 1888 Emile Roux and Alexandre Yersin isolated diphtheria toxin, and following the 1890 discovery by Behring and Kitasato of antitoxin based immunity to diphtheria and tetanus, the antitoxin became the first major success of modern therapeutic immunology.

In Europe, the induction of active immunity emerged in an attempt to contain smallpox. Immunization has existed in various forms for at least a thousand years, without the terminology. The earliest use of immunization is unknown, but, about 1000 AD, the Chinese began practicing a form of immunization by drying and inhaling powders derived from the crusts of smallpox lesions. Around the 15th century in India, the Ottoman Empire, and east Africa, the practice of inoculation (poking the skin with powdered material derived from smallpox crusts) was quite common. This practice was first introduced into the west in 1721 by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. In 1798, Edward Jenner introduced the far safer method of deliberate infection with cowpox virus, (smallpox vaccine), which caused a mild infection that also induced immunity to smallpox. By 1800, the procedure was referred to as vaccination. To avoid confusion, smallpox inoculation was increasingly referred to as variolation, and it became common practice to use this term without regard for chronology. The success and general acceptance of Jenner&#x27;s procedure would later drive the general nature of vaccination developed by Pasteur and others towards the end of the 19th century. In 1891, Pasteur widened the definition of vaccine in honour of Jenner, and it then became essential to qualify the term by referring to polio vaccine, measles vaccine etc.

== Passive immunity ==

Passive immunity is the immunity acquired by the transfer of ready-made antibodies from one individual to another. Passive immunity can occur naturally, such as when maternal antibodies are transferred to the foetus through the placenta, and can also be induced artificially, when high levels of human (or horse) antibodies specific for a pathogen or toxin are transferred to non-immune individuals. Passive immunization is used when there is a high risk of infection and insufficient time for the body to develop its own immune response, or to reduce the symptoms of ongoing or immunosuppressive diseases. Passive immunity provides immediate protection, but the body does not develop memory, therefore the patient is at risk of being infected by the same pathogen later.

=== Naturally acquired passive immunity ===
A fetus naturally acquires passive immunity from its mother during pregnancy. Maternal passive immunity is antibody-mediated immunity. The mother&#x27;s antibodies (MatAb) are passed through the placenta to the fetus by an FcRn receptor on placental cells. This occurs around the third month of gestation. IgG is the only antibody isotype that can pass through the placenta.

Passive immunity is also provided through the transfer of IgA antibodies found in breast milk that are transferred to the gut of a nursing infant, protecting against bacterial infections, until the newborn can synthesize its antibodies. Colostrum present in mothers milk is an example of passive immunity.
=== Artificially acquired passive immunity ===
Artificially acquired passive immunity is a short-term immunization induced by the transfer of antibodies, which can be administered in several forms; as human or animal blood plasma, as pooled human immunoglobulin for intravenous (IVIG) or intramuscular (IG) use, and in the form of monoclonal antibodies (MAb). Passive transfer is used prophylactically in the case of immunodeficiency diseases, such as hypogammaglobulinemia. It is also used in the treatment of several types of acute infection, and to treat poisoning. Immunity derived from passive immunization lasts for only a short period of time, and there is also a potential risk for hypersensitivity reactions, and serum sickness, especially from gamma globulin of non-human origin.

The artificial induction of passive immunity has been used for over a century to treat infectious disease, and before the advent of antibiotics, was often the only specific treatment for certain infections. Immunoglobulin therapy continued to be a first line therapy in the treatment of severe respiratory diseases until the 1930s, even after sulfonamide lot antibiotics were introduced.

===Transfer of activated T-cells===
Passive or &quot;adoptive transfer&quot; of cell-mediated immunity, is conferred by the transfer of &quot;sensitized&quot; or activated T-cells from one individual into another. It is rarely used in humans because it requires histocompatible (matched) donors, which are often difficult to find. In unmatched donors this type of transfer carries severe risks of graft versus host disease. It has, however, been used to treat certain diseases including some types of cancer and immunodeficiency. This type of transfer differs from a bone marrow transplant, in which (undifferentiated) hematopoietic stem cells are transferred.

==Active immunity==
When B cells and T cells are activated by a pathogen, memory B-cells and T- cells develop, and the primary immune response results. Throughout the lifetime of an animal, these memory cells will &quot;remember&quot; each specific pathogen encountered, and can mount a strong secondary response if the pathogen is detected again. The primary and secondary responses were first described in 1921 by English immunologist Alexander Glenny although the mechanism involved was not discovered until later. This type of immunity is both active and adaptive because the body&#x27;s immune system prepares itself for future challenges. Active immunity often involves both the cell-mediated and humoral aspects of immunity as well as input from the innate immune system.

=== Naturally acquired ===

Naturally acquired active immunity occurs as the result of surviving an infection. When a person is exposed to a live pathogen and develops a primary immune response, this leads to immunological memory. Many disorders of immune system function can affect the formation of active immunity, such as immunodeficiency (both acquired and congenital forms) and immunosuppression.

=== Artificially acquired ===
Artificially acquired active immunity can be induced by a vaccine, a substance that contains antigen. A vaccine stimulates a primary response against the antigen without causing symptoms of the disease. The term vaccination was coined by Richard Dunning, a colleague of Edward Jenner, and adapted by Louis Pasteur for his pioneering work in vaccination. The method Pasteur used entailed treating the infectious agents for those diseases, so they lost the ability to cause serious disease. Pasteur adopted the name vaccine as a generic term in honor of Jenner&#x27;s discovery, which Pasteur&#x27;s work built upon.
In 1807, Bavaria became the first group to require their military recruits to be vaccinated against smallpox, as the spread of smallpox was linked to combat. Subsequently, the practice of vaccination would increase with the spread of war.

There are four types of traditional vaccines:
* Inactivated vaccines are composed of micro-organisms that have been killed with chemicals and/or heat and are no longer infectious. Examples are vaccines against flu, cholera, plague, and hepatitis A. Most vaccines of this type are likely to require booster shots.
* Live, attenuated vaccines are composed of micro-organisms that have been cultivated under conditions which disable their ability to induce disease. These responses are more durable, however, they may require booster shots. Examples include yellow fever, measles, rubella, and mumps.
* Toxoids are inactivated toxic compounds from micro-organisms in cases where these (rather than the micro-organism itself) cause illness, used prior to an encounter with the toxin of the micro-organism. Examples of toxoid-based vaccines include tetanus and diphtheria.
* Subunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines are composed of small fragments or pieces from a pathogenic (disease-causing) organism. A characteristic example is the subunit vaccine against Hepatitis B virus.

In addition, there are some newer types of vaccines in use:
* Outer Membrane Vesicle (OMV) vaccines contain the outer membrane of a bacterium without any of its internal components or genetic material. Thus, ideally, they stimulate an immune response effective against the original bacteria without the risk of an infection.
* Genetic vaccines deliver nucleic acid that codes for an antigen into host cells, which then produce that antigen, stimulating an immune response. This category of vaccine includes DNA vaccines, RNA vaccines, and viral vector vaccines, which differ in the chemical form of nucleic acid and how it is delivered into host cells.

A variety of vaccine types are under development; see Experimental Vaccine Types.

Most vaccines are given by hypodermic or intramuscular injection as they are not absorbed reliably through the gut. Live attenuated polio and some typhoid and cholera vaccines are given orally in order to produce immunity based in the bowel.

=== Hybrid immunity ===
Hybrid immunity is the combination of natural immunity and artificial immunity. Studies of hybrid-immune people found that their blood was better able to neutralize the Beta and other variants of SARS-CoV-2 than never-infected, vaccinated people. Moreover, on 29 October 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) concluded that &quot;Multiple studies in different settings have consistently shown that infection with SARS-CoV-2 and vaccination each result in a low risk of subsequent infection with antigenically similar variants for at least 6 months. Numerous immunologic studies and a growing number of epidemiologic studies have shown that vaccinating previously infected individuals significantly enhances their immune response and effectively reduces the risk of subsequent infection, including in the setting of increased circulation of more infectious variants. ...&quot;

== Genetics ==
Immunity is determined genetically. Genomes in humans and animals encode the antibodies and numerous other immune response genes. While many of these genes are generally required for active and passive immune responses (see sections above), there are also many genes that appear to be required for very specific immune responses. For instance, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) is required for defense of tuberculosis in humans. Individuals with genetic defects in TNF may get recurrent and life-threatening infections with tuberculosis bacteria (&quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;) but are otherwise healthy. They also seem to respond to other infections more or less normally. The condition is therefore called &quot;Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease&quot; (MSMD) and variants of it can be caused by other genes related to interferon production or signaling (e.g. by mutations in the genes &quot;IFNG&quot;, &quot;IL12B&quot;, &quot;IL12RB1&quot;, &quot;IL12RB2&quot;, &quot;IL23R&quot;, &quot;ISG15&quot;, &quot;MCTS1&quot;, &quot;RORC&quot;, &quot;TBX21&quot;, &quot;TYK2&quot;, &quot;CYBB&quot;, &quot;JAK1&quot;, &quot;IFNGR1&quot;, &quot;IFNGR2&quot;, &quot;STAT1&quot;, &quot;USP18,&quot; &quot;IRF1&quot;, &quot;IRF8&quot;, &quot;NEMO&quot;, &quot;SPPL2A&quot;).

<text>Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder or REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a sleep disorder in which people act out their dreams. It involves abnormal behavior during the sleep phase with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The major feature of RBD is loss of muscle atonia (i.e., the loss of paralysis) during otherwise intact REM sleep (during which paralysis is not only normal but necessary). The loss of motor inhibition leads to sleep behaviors ranging from simple limb twitches to more complex integrated movements that can be violent or result in injury to either the individual or their bedmates. 

RBD is a very strong predictor of progression to a synucleinopathy (usually Parkinson&#x27;s disease or dementia with Lewy bodies). Melatonin is useful in the treatment of RBD. RBD was first described in 1986.

== Classification ==
RBD is a parasomnia. It is categorized as either idiopathic or symptomatic. &quot;Idiopathic RBD&quot; is the term used when RBD is not associated with another ongoing neurological condition. When it results from an identifiable cause, RBD is referred to as &quot;symptomatic RBD&quot;, and considered a symptom of the underlying disorder.

==Characteristics==
RBD is a sleep disorder characterized by the loss of normal skeletal muscle atonia during REM sleep and is associated with prominent motor activity and vivid dreaming. These dreams often involve screaming, shouting, laughing, crying, arm flailing, kicking, punching, choking, and jumping out of bed. The actions in an episode can result in injuries to oneself or one&#x27;s bedmate. The sleeping person may be unaware of these movements. Dreams often involve violent or aggressive actions, and an attack theme like being chased by people or animals. Because violence in dreams is more likely to be recalled, this could be an artifact of recall bias or selection bias. The individual with RBD may not be aware of having it. When awakened, people may be able to recall the dream they were having, which will match the actions they were performing.

Dream enactment behaviour is a core feature of RBD but is not an exclusive marker of the disorder, therefore a history of recurrent dream enacting behaviour only enough to receive a diagnosis of ‘clinically probable RBD’ and the diagnosis of &#x27;definite RBD&#x27; is only given when there is polysomnography confirmation of complex motor behaviour during REM sleep. When RBD occurs in the absence of any known aetiology of the disorder it is referred to as ‘idiopathic’, however when RBD arises in relation to another neurological disorder or neurodegenerative disease, it is referred to as ‘secondary’ or ‘symptomatic’ RBD.

As the first indication of an underlying neurodegenerative disorder or synucleinopathy, symptoms of RBD may begin years or decades before the onset of another condition. Abnormal sleep behaviors may begin decades before any other symptoms, often as the first clinical indication of another condition.

RBD is a sleep disorder characterized by the loss of normal skeletal muscle atonia during REM sleep and is associated with prominent motor activity and vivid dreaming.

Symptomatic RBD can also be associated with narcolepsy, Guillain–Barré syndrome, limbic encephalitis, and Morvan&#x27;s syndrome.

Other symptoms found in patients with RBD are reduced motor abilities, posture and gait changes, mild cognitive impairment, alterations in the sense of smell, impairments in color vision, autonomic dysfunction (orthostatic hypotension, constipation, urinary problems and sexual dysfunction), and depression.

==Causes==
Rapid eye movement behavior disorder occurs when there is a loss of normal voluntary muscle atonia during REM sleep resulting in motor behavior in response to dream content. It can be caused by adverse reactions to certain drugs or during drug withdrawal; however, it is most often associated with the elderly and in those with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, for example multiple system atrophy and the Lewy body dementias.

The underlying cause of RBD is not well understood, but it is likely that RBD is an early symptom of synucleinopathy rather than a separate disorder. Brainstem circuits that control atonia during REM sleep may be damaged, including those in the pontomedullary brainstem. REM sleep circuits are located in caudal brainstem structures—the same structures that are known to lead to be implicated in the synucleinopathies. Motor deficits like those seen in RBD are known to result from lesions in those circuits.

Risk factors for developing RBD are a family history of acting out dreams, prior head injury, farming, exposure to pesticides, low education level, depression, and use of antidepressants.

RBD may be acute and sudden in onset if associated with drug treatment or withdrawal (particularly with alcohol withdrawal). Antidepressant medications can induce or aggravate RBD symptoms.

== Neuropathology of RBD in PD ==
There are a number of proposed explanations put forth by researchers to try and explain the cognitively impaired phenotype of PD that is linked to RBD. The first is that RBD affects sleep quality/content, which in turn could lead to cognitive dysfunction through various neuronal mechanisms. However, there is not much research support for this idea and there is a lack of association between different sleep disorders, such as insomnia, and cognitive decline in PD.

Another proposed explanation for the increased cognitive decline seen in PDRBD, is due to alterations in neurotransmitter systems. In particular, greater cholinergicdenervation in PD patients with RBD compared to those without. This difference is seen particularly in brain structures like the basal forebrain, an area implicated in both cognition and the regulation of REM sleep and muscle tone through interactions with brainstem nuclei. The increased cholinergic denervation is proposed to appear in the third phase of Braak staging, in which Lewy body pathology in a PD brain appears in the basal forebrain and is thought to cause the reduction in cholinergic neurotransmitters. Thus, cholinergic reduction could play a key role in the pathogenesis of RBD in PD and the cognitive impairment found in these patients, making this a potential marker for a specific cognitive subset of PD. This hypothesis is supported by the amelioration of RBD symptoms through the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, drugs which lead to an increase in cholinergic neurotransmitters in the brain.

A reduction in grey matter volume and cortical thinning, especially in the frontal cortex and inferior parietal lobe of the brain, have also been proposed as the potential cause of PDRBD. Due to the link of cortical and subcortical brain regions in these areas with cognition and REM sleep. The left insular cortex in particular has shown much greater levels of cortical thinning in PDRBD compared to PD without RBD. An area of the brain considered an ‘integrating hub’ of higher-level cognitive processes with social-emotional and sensorimotor functioning. However, there are a lot of inconsistent results within the literature surrounding differences in grey matter volume, and so alterations in brain matter volume are seen as a less reliable neurological marker.

==Diagnosis==
There are two ways to diagnose RBD: by documenting a history of complex, dream-enactment sleep behaviors, or by polysomnography recording of these behaviors along with REM sleep atonia loss.

RBD may be established from clinical interview as well as several validated questionnaires, when sleep studies cannot be performed. Questionnaires such as the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Behavior Disorder Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ), the REM Sleep Behavior Questionnaires – Hong-Kong (RBD-HK), the Mayo Sleep Questionnaire (MSQ) and the Innsbruck REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Inventory are well-validated.

Individuals with RBD may not be able to provide a history of dream enactment behavior, so bed partners are also consulted. The REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Single-Question Screen offers diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in the absence of polysomnography with one question: &quot;Have you ever been told, or suspected yourself, that you seem to &#x27;act out your dreams&#x27; while asleep (for example, punching, flailing your arms in the air, making running movements, etc.)?&quot;

Diagnostic criteria for RBD from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) are:
# Repetition of vocalizations and/or complex motor behaviors during sleep
# Polysomnography (PSG) show that these behaviors occur during REM sleep
# If documentation of these behaviors by PSG is not possible, they must at least be assumed to take place during REM sleep based on records of dream enactment
# REM sleep without atonia (RWA) can be seen in polysomnographic recordings
# Episodes cannot be explained by another mental disorder, sleep disorder, substance abuse or medication

=== Differential ===
Other conditions are similar to RBD in that individuals exhibit excessive sleep movement and potentially violent behavior. Such disorders include non-REM parasomnias (sleepwalking, sleep terrors), periodic limb movement disorder, severe obstructive sleep apnea, and dissociative disorders. Because of the similarities between the conditions, polysomnography plays an important role in confirming RBD diagnosis.

=== Cognitive Phenotype of PD with RBD ===
Amongst research on the link between RBD and PD, a specific cognitive phenotype of PD has emerged. This phenotype is classified as &#x27;diffuse malignant&#x27; and is associated with faster cognitive decline/ more severe cognitive impairment. It has a much poorer prognosis and increases and those with this phenotype have an increased likelihood of going on to develop some form of dementia.

When observing both cross-sectional and longitudinal data regarding RBD and PD, deficits in global cognitive functioning, attention/working memory, language, executive functions, and visuospatial abilities can be seen in patients with RBD and PD (PDRBD); especially in comparison to PD patients without RBD (PD non-RBD). PDRBD show significantly greater annual rates of decline on established cognitive tests such as the MoCA test, and even have an increased likelihood of displaying clinical manifestations that have a strong link to PD dementia, for example visual hallucinations.

Patients with PDRBD report much higher subjective rates of cognitive decline compared to those without RBD and are much more likely to be diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). On average 75%-80% of patients with PDRBD go onto receive a diagnosis of MCI, and then a further 30% develop some form of dementia, within 15–20 years of PD onset.

The difference in overall cognitive decline between PDRBD and PD non-RBD is replicated in studies conducted in many different cultures and remains strong regardless of whether participants are drug naïve or taking some form of dopaminergic treatment to aid with their PD. However, the existence of a unique and specific cognitively impaired profile among PD patients with RBD is still deemed controversial. This is mainly due to methodological limitations among the literature; such as the absence of polysomnography in the diagnosis of RBD, the use of tests with poor sensitivity when measuring cognition and testing for cognitive deficits, as well as small sample sizes. Despite this, many researchers do still advocate for the use of RBD as a premature clinical indicator of PD, which could provide an earlier window for potential preventative treatment of PD.

==Treatment==
RBD is treatable (even when the underlying synucleinopathies are not). Melatonin and clonazepam are the most frequently used, and are comparably effective, but melatonin offers a safer alternative, because clonazepam can produce undesirable side effects. 

Medications that may worsen RBD and should be stopped if possible are tramadol, mirtazapine, antidepressants, and beta blockers.

In addition to medication, it is wise to secure the sleeper&#x27;s environment by removing potentially dangerous objects from the bedroom and either place a cushion around the bed or move the mattress to the floor for added protection against injuries. In extreme cases, an affected individual has slept in a sleeping bag zipped up to their neck, wearing mittens so they cannot unzip it until they awake.

Patients are advised to maintain a normal sleep schedule, avoid sleep deprivation, and keep track of any sleepiness they may have. Treatment includes regulating neurologic symptoms and treating any other sleep disorders that might interfere with sleep. Sleep deprivation, alcohol, certain medications, and other sleep disorders can all increase RBD and should be avoided if possible.

==Prognosis==

Patients with RBD are at risk for sleep-related injury.

Almost 92% of patients with idiopathic RBD will go on to develop a neurodegenerative disorder. The disorders most strongly associated with RBD are the synucleinopathies, particularly Parkinson&#x27;s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and to a lesser extent, multiple system atrophy. Most people with RBD will convert to a synucleinopathy—usually Parkinson&#x27;s disease or dementia with Lewy bodies—within 4 to 9 years from diagnosis of RBD, and 11 to 16 years from onset of symptoms.

== Epidemiology ==
Numerous reports over the past few years have stated the frequent association of synucleinopathies with RBD. RBD prevalence as of 2017 is estimated to be 0.5–2% overall, and 5–13% of those aged 60 to 99. It is more common in males overall, but equally frequent among men and women below the age of 50. This may partially be due to a referral bias, as violent activity carried out by men is more likely to result in harm and injury and is more likely to be reported than injury to male bed partners by women, or it may reflect a true difference in prevalence as a result of genetic or androgenic factors. Typical onset is in the 50s or 60s.

Almost half of those with Parkinson&#x27;s, at least 88% of those with multiple system atrophy, and about 80% of people with Lewy body dementia have RBD. RBD is a very strong predictor of progression to a synucleinopathy (for example, the Lewy body dementias). On autopsy, up to 98% of individuals with polysomnography-confirmed RBD are found to have a synucleinopathy.

In the general population the incidence of RBD is around 0.5%, compared to the prevalence of RBD in PD patients, which has been reported to be between 38% and 60%. The diagnosis and symptom onset of RBD typically precedes the onset of motor or cognitive symptoms of PD by a number of years, typically ranging anywhere from 2 to 15 years prior. Hence, this link could provide an important window of opportunity in the implementation of therapies and treatments, that could prevent or slow the onset of PD.

==History==
In the 1960s and 1970s, Michel Jouvet described brain lesions in cats that led to loss of atonia in REM sleep. Carlos Schenck and Mark Mahowald and their team in Minnesota first described RBD in 1986.

==In animals==

RBD has also been diagnosed in animals, specifically dogs.

<doc id="298549" wikidata="Q2140751" url="?curid=298549" title="Boogiepop Phantom">
<text>is a Japanese anime television series animated by Madhouse, based on the &quot;Boogiepop&quot; light novel series by Kouhei Kadono. The series is directed by Takashi Watanabe, from a screenplay by Sadayuki Murai, with original character designs by the light novel&#x27;s illustrator Kouji Ogata, and sound direction by Yota Tsuruoka. Chronologically, the story follows immediately after the events of the series&#x27;s first volume, &quot;Boogiepop and Others&quot;, while also making references to the prequel sixth volume, &quot;Boogiepop at Dawn&quot;.

==Premise==
The story takes place in an unnamed Japanese city, a month after a pillar of light appeared in the night sky and five years after a string of serial killings. &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot; follows an ensemble cast of characters, mostly high school students, who are witnesses to the incident and its consequences. At the time of the series, high school students have started to disappear again and the blame is placed on Boogiepop, an urban legend who is said to be the personification of Death.

==Structure==
Each episode centers on different characters who sometimes have just a short involvement in the major events of the series. For this reason, many scenes are seen twice, from different perspectives, and some episodes are out of sequence, although there is a slow general time progression. An unusual visual style is employed wherein, for all but the last episode, a much reduced color palette is used in conjunction with a vignette effect. The sound design consists of synthesized avant-garde music carried by a leitmotif in the form of an active sonar pulse. Through the non-linear style of the series, the characters are used to develop the central themes of the series: Change, Escapism, Memory, and Relationships.

&quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot; aired on TV Tokyo from January 5 to March 22, 2000. The series is licensed and distributed in North America and Europe by Right Stuf International.

== Summary ==

Five years before the events of &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot;, Nagi Kirima met and befriended Shinpei Kuroda, an undercover agent of the Towa organization, at the local prefecture&#x27;s hospital. Nagi was hospitalized because she was dying as her body was evolving. Shinpei, upon learning the truth behind Nagi&#x27;s sickness, betrayed the Towa organization and administered a stolen Towa drug to Nagi that saved her life. He was mortally wounded by Towa agents as he fled from the hospital, leaving the drug behind in the process. Touka Miyashita came across Shinpei (as the Towa Agent Scarecrow) and the psychological trauma from seeing the dying man (after being hit by More Murder) created her Boogiepop persona.

The &quot;Boogiepop at Dawn&quot; light novel describes how Dr Kisugi witnessed Nagi&#x27;s remarkable recovery and, through experimentation on rats, learned of the drug&#x27;s powers to grant superhuman abilities, before administering it to herself. The drug changed the doctor into a composite human, granting her the vast increase in physical and mental attributes shared with all composite humans and allowing her to sense the hormones that produce fear and develop a craving for them. At first terrorizing her patients and sampling their blood, she then murdered a number of strong-willed girls to consume the fear they produced at the moment of their death. &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot; shows how Dr Kisugi gave the drug to her patients, claiming it could heal them, and how it worsened their problems and resulted in their evolution. Kirima investigated the murders, and discovered Dr Kisugi was the serial killer. Nagi and Dr Kisugi confronted each other at the hospital, where The Fire Witch was initially overwhelmed by the doctor’s power, but managed to kill her with Boogiepop&#x27;s help.

The &quot;Boogiepop and Others&quot; novel tells of Manticore, an imperfect clone of the alien entity Echoes, created by the Towa Organization five years later. Escaping the laboratory, Manticore killed Minako Yurihara with the intention of assuming her form when it was found by Masami Saotome. Instead of killing Masami, Manticore struck a deal with him. Manticore (as Minako) and Masami experimented with production of Type S, a highly addictive drug that would enslave all its users to their will, while killing students for Manticore&#x27;s consumption. Meanwhile, Echoes escaped from the Towa laboratory in chase of Manticore. The alien met up with Nagi Kirima, who was investigating the recent student disappearances.

Learning they were being pursued, Masami and Manticore set a trap for Echoes and Nagi. Events culminated one evening at Shinyo Academy, when Masami crippled Echoes with poison and killed Nagi, who did not expect Manticore to have a human ally. Manticore chased Echoes as he attempted to escape with Nagi&#x27;s body, and beat him to the verge of death. Manticore and Masami were attacked by Boogiepop, who held Manticore in place while Echoes turned himself into light. The light pierced the sky and destroyed Manticore, with Masami committing suicide by flying into the pillar. Nagi was revived by Echoes before he left the planet.

&quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot; is set one month later and revolves around the consequences of the pillar of light. Echoes&#x27; light inadvertently allowed the memories of that night to continue as holograms, giving rise to a mixed reality where past and present co-exist, and forced the evolution of the citizens, including those who were administered the Towa drug by Dr Kisugi. The series is concerned with these evolved individuals, how evolution affected their lives, and their disappearance after meeting Boogiepop Phantom. The Phantom explains it hid them below the city to save them, and that although their bodies no longer function, their nerves extend across the city so they will keep dreaming until the day the rest of humanity catches up to them.

== Characters ==
 is the urban legend whispered of among the female students of Shinyo Academy. Reputed to be an &quot;Angel of Death&quot; with the appearance of a beautiful boy dressed all in black, who comes with a whistle to take girls away before they turn ugly. Few people know that Boogiepop actually exists, and is the dormant alter ego of Touka Miyashita who rises to the surface when enemies of the world appear. The reaper hides beneath its signature black cloak and hat, and acts in a mechanical and automatic fashion. Straight-faced and to the point, it speaks in an archaic manner, and seems fond of whistling the overture to Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;.

 is an entity born in the electromagnetic field the moment Echoes&#x27; light appeared in the sky. Amongst the memories scattered by the light it could only find Boogiepop&#x27;s attire, but not his face, and so chose the appearance of Minako Yurihara at random. He claims to be Boogiepop, but later renames himself Boogiepop Phantom out of respect for the original. He too confronts the enemies of the world, but has his own agenda in mind.

 was to be Dr. Kisugi&#x27;s next victim, until Boogiepop and the Fire Witch put a stop to the killings. With the knowledge that her life had been in danger, she developed a fascination for criminal and abnormal psychology, and a desire to not let anything occur around her without her knowing. She desperately seeks the truth behind the unexplained happenings in the city, and meddles with forces best left untouched. Kazuko longs to be closer to Nagi Kirima, who seems to know the answers she seeks.

 is a highly evolved being with the ability to draw memories from her surroundings in the form of butterflies of light. She was given the Towa drug by Dr Kisugi as an unborn child, which caused her abilities to develop. The &quot;devil&#x27;s child&quot;, as she was known, was killed by her dying grandmother. Echoes&#x27; light brought Manaka back to life and caused accelerated aging. Her grandmother died soon after. Her insight into people&#x27;s memories makes her aware of Echoes, whom she emulates.

 is another product of Echoes&#x27; light, one who possesses the remnants of Manticore&#x27;s consciousness and the visage of Masami Saotome. No longer the threat it once was, it now preys only on distressed, easy targets. Manticore Phantom seeks a way to sustain himself permanently when he learns that he will be gone once the electromagnetic field returns to its original state.

, the Fire Witch, has made few friends because she knows she is too dangerous for &#x27;normal&#x27; people to associate with. She has a Messiah complex, and seeks to save the world from whatever may threaten it. Her father&#x27;s death and her brief friendship with Shinpei Kuroda motivated Nagi to become a defender of justice. She is very strong both physically and mentally, and uses her abilities and inheritance in her self-appointed mission.

 is a phantom created by Manaka Kisaragi. Born from the memories of Mamoru Oikawa playing the Pied Piper in a school play, it evolved to take on qualities of Akane Kojima&#x27;s fictional character of Poom Poom. By handing out red balloons to people who regret the direction their lives have taken, he takes a manifestation of their childhood hopes and dreams with him to Paisley Park, leaving only an empty shell behind.

 possesses the appearance of an ordinary school girl at Shinyo Academy, but unknowingly suffers from dissociative identity disorder. At the age of twelve, she witnessed the death of Shinpei Kuroda, and the resulting mental trauma gave birth to the alternate personality of Boogiepop. Whenever enemies of the world appear, Boogiepop takes over to do battle. Touka is not aware this is happening, as she deletes her memories of being Boogiepop, and carries all of Boogiepop&#x27;s effects in a Spalding sports bag without realizing it.

== Themes ==

&quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot; is a story that primarily deals with change and how perceptions change as people grow older. The theme of change is represented not only by the ongoing struggle between the Towa organization and the evolved humans, but also by the way the look of the city is changing and through the growth of children into adults. Similar to the theme of change, the concept of moving on and not being stuck in the past is integral to the story as both Boogiepop and Boogiepop Phantom confront Manaka for what they perceive as keeping people stuck in the past. However, the series&#x27; view on change is presented ambiguously, as while the Towa organization seeks to prevent change in the world, it has world domination as its agenda. Boogiepop parallels this dualism as he encourages people to move forward with their lives while hunting down evolved humans thus preventing the possible transformation of society.

Retreat from reality and the consequences of escapism are important themes that play a major role in the series. The image of burning memories to forget them and so escape them is used throughout the latter half of the series to symbolize the theme of escapism. For the characters Misuzu and Yoji, their retreat from reality has devastating consequences: Misuzu enters a despairing insanity after being forced to realize the truth of her reality, while Yoji goes through a mental breakdown as his reality is no longer the fantasy he believed it to be. However, the question as to how people should live their lives goes unanswered by the series. Later on in the series, retreat from reality is revisited in the form of Poom Poom, who represents the ultimate escape from reality into childhood.

Relationships, and the tragedy of loss and misunderstanding inherent within them, are major themes in &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot;. The relationships that the characters Mamoru, Manaka, and Shizue have with their parents highlights the lack of support that children receive from parents who are otherwise busy, and the resulting disconnection between parents and children. With the actions of Poom Poom later in the series the theme of the Pied Piper is explored, as Poom Poom takes away the children because the parents have broken their promise. The message the show leaves the viewer however is positive, as both Manaka and Shizue reconcile with their mothers, and so the parent-child relationship can be saved by open communication and understanding. Another form of relationship is explored through the interaction between Moto and Manticore Phantom, where the physical surrender of Moto, who harbored feelings for Masami, associates the sexual relationship with death.

&quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot; is also a series that is about memory and how memories help define who we are. For most of the characters, their memories of the past and background are crucially important in determining the direction their lives have taken.

&quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot; was conceived as an original story taking place after the events of the novels &quot;Boogiepop and Others &quot; and &quot;Boogiepop at Dawn&quot;. Sadayuki Murai developed the series concept and wrote the screenplay for both the anime and the live-action prequel &quot;Boogiepop and Others&quot;, having previously worked on the script for &quot;Perfect Blue&quot;, a feature film that explored many similar themes. The character designer and key animator Shigeyuki Suga had been a key animator for &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot;, a series with which &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot; is often compared. The reduced brightness and sepia color palette for most of the episodes, added to the anxieties and depressions of the characters, were designed to make the series play like a psychological horror. Production staff later commented that the color scheme was more effective than they had originally intended, and were surprised by how bleak the series turned out.

A mixed media campaign was planned which would have had the live action prequel &quot;Boogiepop and Others&quot; released before the anime series, with the idea that people would watch the anime after seeing the movie, but the release of the film was delayed until after the series had neared the end of its original run, and so this strategy failed.

=== Artistic homages ===
Many homages are made to other works throughout &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot;. In particular, musical references are a characteristic trait of the Boogiepop novels, such as the character Echoes being an allusion to the Pink Floyd song of the same name, which itself is a possible allusion to &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; with its themes of evolution and transcendence. Another possible allusion comes in the form of a sonar-ping sound effect utilized throughout the series. The intro to Echoes was devised from an experiment where the band tried to recreate that particular sound on a grand piano. Further, Towa agent Spooky Electric is a homage to a personality Prince claims to have that encouraged him to write &quot;The Black Album&quot;.

Mythology also plays a large part in &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot;. Two of the main protagonists are said to be &quot;Shinigami&quot;, death deities of Japanese folklore who can take on many forms. &quot;Kitsune&quot; are fox spirits of Japanese folklore, they possess magical powers that increase with age and are capable of assuming human form, with Boogiepop being described as a kitsune by Touka Miyashita&#x27;s parents. The Manticore is named after the man-eater of Persian mythology.

=== Music ===
Yota Tsuruoka was the sound and music director for &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot;. The soundtrack for the series featured many artists and various styles, ranging from Gregorian to electronic. The opening theme song , which was also used as the ending theme for the live action prequel &quot;Boogiepop and Others&quot;, was composed, arranged, and performed by Shikao Suga. Kyoko composed and performed the ending song . The &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot; soundtrack was published by AnimeTrax and released by The Right Stuf International as a two-disc CD on 30 April 2002. The songs &quot;Evening Shower&quot; and &quot;Future Century Secret Club&quot; were not included on the OST with the rest of the soundtrack, but were instead released separately by the artists. &quot;Evening Shower&quot; was published on 8 September 1999, prior to the initial airing of the series, on Shikao Suga’s album &quot;Sweet&quot;, while Kyoko’s &quot;Future Century Secret Club&quot; was initially released as a single of the same name on 9 February 2000, and later as part of an album titled &quot;Under The Silk Tree&quot; on 8 November 2000.

=== Releases ===
Originally broadcast on TV Tokyo from 5 January to 22 March 2000, &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot; was released in Japan on six DVDs subtitled &quot;Evolution&quot; 1-6 with two episodes per disc. The Right Stuf International confirmed on 6 January 2001 that they had licensed the property for release in North America and Europe while ADV Films would handle distribution. The English dub was recorded at Headline Sound Studios and received a 15 rating from the British Board of Film Classification.

The Right Stuf International first showed &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot; at various conventions and festivals such as Anime Expo and Montreal&#x27;s Fantasia Film Festival, before being released in the United States as four bilingual DVDs containing 5.1 and 2.0 Dolby Stereo English and 2.0 Japanese with English subtitle soundtracks from 9 October 2001 until 12 February 2002. A boxed set containing all four &quot;Evolution&quot; DVDs was also released alongside &quot;Evolution&quot; 4. Extras on the discs included ADV previews, original Japanese promotions, producer and character notes, music videos for both the opening and ending songs, a special edit ending sequence, and English language commentaries for each episode. In 2003 The Right Stuf International released a limited edition boxed set containing all four DVDs, the 2-disc &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot; soundtrack and the Boogiepop: Music Inspired By Boogiepop and Others CD, as well as a limited edition &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot; card set and pencil boards, which were available exclusively from The Right Stuf International and Best Buy. &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot; was later released as a thinpak collection in 2006 that also came with the live action &quot;Boogiepop and Others&quot;.

The rights to broadcast the series were acquired by Anime Network, the first time a non-ADV title had been broadcast on that network, with broadcasting beginning from 1 July onwards. TechTV later announced that they would also broadcast the series with the premiere on 28 July 2003. Since then, the rights to broadcast the series have been acquired by Funimation Channel, and the series aired in early 2007.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot; was a hit. The &quot;spooky sepia puzzle&quot; juggles an ensemble cast of characters, each with unique point of view, while revealing tidbits about the larger plot in a nonlinear fashion. Christopher Macdonald of Anime News Network gives special mention to Sadayuki Murai&#x27;s skill as a screenwriter, for being able to keep the viewer engrossed as well as tying all elements and plot threads by the final episode.
But the series&#x27; intricate nature is counterproductive. Its increasingly convoluted plot can discourage people from watching, and viewers not familiar with the &quot;Boogiepop&quot; universe will leave with &quot;more questions than answers&quot;.

The reduced color palette was applauded for highlighting the sense of &quot;mental disease&quot; and &quot;emotional malaise&quot; that affected most of the characters, while the vignette effect allowed the viewer to observe inside the series rather than just watch it. Character designs have been criticized as &quot;bland&quot; but also &quot;realistic&quot; since none of the characters have &quot;outrageous hair styles or colors&quot;. Reviews also recognized that &quot;astute viewers may notice some rather interesting, although not very blatant, differences between the various characters&quot;, and that the &quot;realistic&quot; character designs created a degree of &quot;normalcy&quot; that was important to the story while also helping to draw in the viewer. The audio of the series has been described as &quot;unique&quot; and &quot;incredible&quot;, going beyond what is expected of normal sound design and enhancing the &quot;creepy&quot; atmosphere of the show. Also noted was that the opening and ending songs don&#x27;t appear to fit in well with the mood of the series. The English language track was not as well received as its Japanese counterpart, but still reviewed favorably. In particular, the performance of Jessica Calvello in the English dub was singled out and praised as being her best performance to date.

<text>The Greater Antilles is a grouping of the larger islands in the Caribbean Sea, including Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and Jamaica, together with Navassa Island and the Cayman Islands. Seven island states share the region of the Greater Antilles, with Haiti and the Dominican Republic sharing the island of Hispaniola. Together with the Lesser Antilles, they make up the Antilles, which along with the Lucayan Archipelago, form the West Indies in the Caribbean region of the Americas. 

While most of the Greater Antilles consists of independent countries, Puerto Rico and Navassa Island are unincorporated territories of the United States, while the Cayman Islands are a British Overseas Territory. The largest island is Cuba, which extends to the western end of the island group. Puerto Rico lies on the eastern end, and the island of Hispaniola, the most populated island, is located in the middle. Jamaica lies to the south of Cuba, while the Cayman Islands are located to the west. The state of Florida is the closest point in the U.S. mainland to the Greater Antilles, while the Florida Keys, though not part of the Greater Antilles, is an island group north of Cuba.
== History ==
The word &quot;Antilles&quot; originated in the period before the European conquest of the New World. Europeans used the term &quot;Antillia&quot; as one of the mysterious lands featured on medieval charts, sometimes as an archipelago, sometimes as continuous land of greater or lesser extent, its location fluctuating mid-ocean between the Canary Islands and Eurasia. The first European contact with the Greater Antilles came from Christopher Columbus&#x27; first voyage to the Americas, as he sailed south from the Bahamas, exploring the northeast coast of Cuba and northern coast of Hispaniola. The Spanish began to create permanent settlements on Cuba and Hispaniola. The Atlantic slave trade brought many Africans to the islands. France began to exert influence over Haiti from 1625, dividing Hispaniola into two halves. Neighbouring Jamaica was invaded by the British, defeating the Spanish colonists.

At the beginning of the 16th century, the Spanish began to colonize the island of Puerto Rico. Despite the Laws of Burgos of 1512 and other decrees protecting indigenous populations, some Taíno Indians were forced into an encomienda system of forced labor in the early years of colonization.

The Haitian Revolution was the first and only successful anti-slavery and anti-colonial insurrection by self-liberated slaves; it established the independent nation of Haiti, the first in the Greater Antilles, the Caribbean, and Latin America as a whole. The next nation to achieve independence, the Dominican Republic, was also on Hispaniola, declaring independence from Spain in 1821. It was quickly absorbed by Haiti under the Unification of Hispaniola. 

The Dominican Republic regained independence in 1844 after the Dominican War of Independence. The rest of the Greater Antilles would remain under colonial rule for another hundred years. Along with the Philippines in Asia, Spain transferred possession of Cuba and Puerto Rico to the United States as a result of its loss in the Spanish-American War in 1898, coinciding with the Cuban War of Independence. This was the final loss of Spain&#x27;s territorial possessions in the Americas. U.S. military rule over the island lasted until 1902, when Cuba was granted formal independence.

In 1917, the U.S. Congress passed the Jones–Shafroth Act (popularly known as the Jones Act), granting U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans born on or after April 25, 1898. In 1947, the U.S. Congress passed the Elective Governor Act, signed by President Truman, allowing Puerto Ricans to vote for their own governor. The Cuban Revolution in 1959 established Cuba as the only communist state in the Greater Antilles. Jamaica was granted independence from the U.K in August 1962 becoming the last currently independent state in the Greater Antilles to achieve independence.

== Geography ==

The Greater Antilles comprises four major islands and numerous smaller ones. The island of Cuba is the largest island in the Greater Antilles, in Latin America, and in the Caribbean. It is followed by Hispaniola. Geologically, the Virgin Islands are also part of the Greater Antilles, though politically they are considered part of the Lesser Antilles. With an area of , not counting the Virgin Islands, the Greater Antilles constitute nearly 90% of the land mass of the entire West Indies, as well as over 90% of its population. The remainder of the land belongs to the archipelago of the Lesser Antilles, which is a chain of islands to the east, running north–south and encompassing the eastern edge of the Caribbean Sea where it meets the Atlantic Ocean, as well as to the south, running east–west off the northern coast of South America.

The Lucayan Archipelago is not considered part of the Antilles archipelagos but rather of the North Atlantic.

The islands exist because of the relative motion of the Caribbean Plate and surrounding plates. Obduction has scraped accumulated rock onto the North American plate, islands and intrusions have been formed by volcanism, and the local crust has become deformed in other ways. 

== Demographics ==
The Greater Antilles is considered part of Latin America. With a population of 38 million, it makes up 6% of Latin America&#x27;s total population. The capital of the Dominican Republic, Santo Domingo, with a population of over 2 million, is the largest city in the Greater Antilles. Other large cities include Havana, Port-au-Prince, Kingston and San Juan. The quality of life within the Greater Antilles is similar among Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, whose Human Development Index categorizes them as &quot;high human development&quot;. Cuba, the independent nation with the highest HDI, nevertheless ranks below Puerto Rico and the Cayman Islands, both of which are categorized as &quot;very high&quot;. Haiti is an exception, having the lowest Human Development Index in the Greater Antilles and in all of the Americas at 0.498, which categorizes it as having &quot;Low human development&quot;.

== Languages ==
Languages spoken in the Greater Antilles are mostly colonial languages, along with some Creole influence. Spanish is the main language in Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Haiti has a Creole language, Haitian Creole, as one of its official languages, alongside French. English is the main language in Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, though it is also an official language of Puerto Rico, where it is spoken as a second language. In Jamaica, a Creole language is spoken but carries no official recognition.

<text>Mona Island () is the third-largest island of the Puerto Rican archipelago, after the main island of Puerto Rico and Vieques. It is the largest of three islands in the Mona Passage, the strait between Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, with the others being Monito Island and Desecheo Island. It measures about 7 miles by 4 miles (11 km by 7 km), and lies west of Puerto Rico, of which it is administratively a part. It is one of two islands that make up the Isla de Mona e Islote Monito barrio in the municipality of Mayagüez.

The island is managed under the Mona and Monito Islands Nature Reserve (&quot;Reserva Natural Islas de Mona y Monito&quot;). There are no permanent inhabitants; only rangers and biologists from the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources reside on the island, to manage visitors and take part in research projects. The island, along with Monito, form part of the Mona and Monito Islands National Natural Landmark which recognizes and preserves the islands&#x27; ecosystem as an outstanding example of diversity and natural history. The island is home to a number of endemic species such as the Mona ground iguana and it is an important seabird area.

==History==
===Pre-Columbian history===
Mona Island is believed to have been originally settled by the Taíno since the 12th century or sooner. An archeological excavation during the 1980s discovered many Pre-Columbian objects on the island that helped support historians&#x27; theories of the island&#x27;s first inhabitants. Stone tools found in a rock shelter have been dated to around 3000 BC. Much later the island was settled by the Taínos and remained so until the arrival of the Spanish in the 15th century.

===Colonial period===

On November 19, 1493, during his second voyage to the New World, Christopher Columbus encountered the island now known as Puerto Rico, which the natives called &quot;Borinquen&quot; (or &quot;Borikén&quot;), and which Columbus named &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot; (Saint John the Baptist). Within hours of setting foot in Puerto Rico, Columbus and his ships headed west to Hispaniola, where he expected to meet several crewmembers who had remained behind from his first voyage. As he left Puerto Rico, he reputedly became the first European to sight the island on September 24, 1494, which was claimed for Spain. The name &quot;Mona&quot; derives from the Taíno name &quot;Ámona&quot;, bestowed by the natives in honor of the ruling &quot;Cacique&quot; or chief of the island.

In 1502, Fray Nicolás de Ovando was sent to Isla de la Mona to keep an eye, from a safe distance, on the native revolts occurring in Hispaniola. With a group of 2,000 Spanish settlers, Ovando was left in charge of creating a permanent settlement on the island. Due to its small size and location, the island proved inadequate to accommodate such a large settlement, and food became scarce as shipments from Hispaniola and Puerto Rico were received infrequently.

Juan Ponce de León, who accompanied Columbus on his first two voyages, became the first ruling governor of Puerto Rico.

In 1515, after some wrangling, Ferdinand II was able to reclaim the island from Diego Colón, Viceroy of the Indies. By then, Isla de la Mona was an important point of trade between Spain and the rest of Latin America, as well as a rest stop for the crews of boats carrying slaves. With his possession of the island, King Ferdinand II gave the resident Taínos two options if they wished to continue living on the island: they could work by fishing, making hammocks and cultivating plants, or they could become miners and help in the mining of guano and other minerals. Realizing that mining would require intense labor, the majority of inhabitants chose to work as fishermen and farmers. By accepting this option, they also were exempted from paying imposed taxes, and were able to avoid the hard labor many other natives endured in mines. In time, natives from other neighboring islands were brought to Mona Island to assist with labor.

After the death of Ferdinand II in 1516, ownership of the island was transferred to Cardenal Cisneros. The island changed ownership again in 1520, when Francisco de Barrionuevo became the island&#x27;s new landlord. By 1524, Alonso Manso, bishop of Puerto Rico, had become interested in gaining personal wealth, and he accused Barrionuevo, among others, of various crimes under the Spanish justice system of the time. Because of this situation, Barrionuevo exiled himself to one of Spain&#x27;s colonies in South America, taking many Taínos along with him, and leaving the island practically deserted.

By 1522, ships from other major sea powers such as England, France, and the Netherlands began to arrive at Isla de la Mona to replenish supplies for their transatlantic voyages. The island also provided a refuge from which they, as well as pirates, could attack and plunder Spanish galleons.

In 1561, during an audience held in Santo Domingo, it was recommended that Isla de la Mona should become a part of that colony (which at the time occupied the entirety of Hispaniola). The reasons offered were simply that the island was closer to Santo Domingo (presently the Dominican Republic) than to Puerto Rico, and that it had a small population which could help the colony&#x27;s economy in overall agricultural production. However, the petition was turned down and the island continued to remain politically part of Puerto Rico.

In 1583, the Spanish archbishop of Puerto Rico received royal permission to bring Christianity to Mona Island. However, by this time most Taínos remaining on the island had either died or fled to mainland Puerto Rico due to repeated raiding by European (especially French) ships. From the end of the 16th century up until the mid-19th century the island was largely abandoned by the colonial authorities. It seems to have been sporadically inhabited, although records from this period are somewhat sketchy. It continued to be used as a refuge by pirates and privateers, including the notorious Captain Kidd who hid out there in 1699.

The island&#x27;s circumstances changed in the mid-19th century when it became the site of commercial guano mining operations. Various companies were granted licenses to extract the bat and seagull guano (a valuable fertilizer and key strategic commodity for the production of gunpowder) from the island&#x27;s caves. Mining continued until 1927.

===20th century===

With the 1898 Treaty of Paris, Isla de la Mona, along with the rest of Puerto Rico, was handed to the United States by Spain. The population of Mona Isla was six at the time. Within two years of occupation, the Mona Island Light, left in an unfinished state since the beginning of the Spanish–American War, was completed and began operation. The lighthouse was not, as commonly believed, designed by Gustave Eiffel, but by the Spanish engineer Rafael Ravena in 1886. It was accessible by the Mona Island Tramway from the beach and remained in continuous operation until 1976 when it was replaced by a newer automated light near the center of the island.

On December 22, 1919, the island was declared an &quot;Insular Forest of Puerto Rico&quot;, under the auspices of the U.S. Forest Law No. 22.

During Prohibition the island had a history of smuggling, with its geographic location making it a prime location for rum runners to smuggle rum, bourbon, and other liquor. In 1923, a stash of liquor, drugs, and perfumes, reportedly from the French islands of Martinique and Saint Martin and worth US$75,000, was found in a cave by customs officials.

In 1942, at the height of World War II, a German U-156 submarine fired 30 shells from its deck gun at the southern coast of the island. The crew of the Nazi vessel suspected that Camp Cofresí, a camp that the Civilian Conservation Corps were using as the base of a reforestation effort, could be an unmarked military facility. There were no significant losses, but the incident was one of the few military strikes of the war in the Caribbean, which was also the focus of a German/Italian campaign against Allied resource shipping. Prior to this, the Nazi U-boat had sunk nineteen ships in the region including one named &quot;Del Plata&quot; in Puerto Rican waters. On June 4, 1942, the oil tanker MV &quot;C.O. Stillman&quot; was sunk by the German submarine southwest of Isla de Mona. From 1945 to 1955 Mona Island was leased to the U.S. Air Force as a military exercise area.

Since 1941 the island has also been used for camping and hunting goats and wild boar. In 1960 a small ranger post was established to monitor the island, operated by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources.

In July 1972 the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board, because of growing interest in the development of the islands, made a full scientific assessment of Mona and Monito using a local team of volunteer scientists. A two-volume report with maps of natural and historic features was produced. It evaluated the climate, geology and mineral resources, soils, water resources, archaeology, vegetation, animals and insects, and pelagic life around the island. Shortly thereafter geotechnical and bathymetric studies were conducted by engineering firms to determine the feasibility of using Mona as a deep-water terminal for transferring oil from supertankers to smaller tankers which would continue to the mainland US; this plan was never implemented.

In 1981, the Mona Island Light was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as &quot;Faro de la Isla de la Mona&quot;.

On February 15, 1985, the passenger-cargo ferry ran aground on a reef on the southeastern side of Mona Island. While there were no deaths nor serious injuries, 143 passengers and 72 crew members landed on Mona Island to await rescue. The wreck of the ship was removed from the reef in 1990.

In 1993, the island, inscribed as &quot;Isla de la Mona&quot;, was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. The historic district consists of eight contributing buildings (including the lighthouse), nine prehistoric and historic archaeological sites (including several ceremonial ball courts or &quot;bateyes&quot;), two guano industrial ruins, a roadway and a cistern.

==Geography==

Mona has an area of about and lies west of the main island of Puerto Rico, east of the Dominican Republic, and southwest of Desecheo Island, another island in the Mona Passage.

Mona has been designated an ecological reserve by the Puerto Rican government and is not permanently inhabited. The US census of 2000 reported six housing units, but a population of zero. The island is a barrio of the municipality of Mayagüez, together with Monito Island 3.1 mi (5 km) northwest (&quot;Isla de Mona e Islote Monito barrio&quot;). This is the largest ward of Mayagüez by area, and the only one without permanent population. The total land area of both islands in the barrio is about 21.98 square miles (56.93 km2) (Mona Island 21.924 square miles [56.783 km2] and nearby Monito Island 0.057 square miles [0.147 km2]), and it comprises 28.3 percent of the total land area of the municipality of Mayagüez. Desecheo Island, 30 mi (49 km) to the northeast, is part of Sabanetas barrio.

Mona is a mainly flat plateau surrounded by sea cliffs. It is composed of dolomite and limestone with many caves found throughout. With an arid climate and untouched by human development, many endemic species inhabit the island, such as the Mona ground iguana (&quot;Cyclura cornuta stejnegeri&quot;). Its topography, ecology, and modern history are similar to that of Navassa Island, a small limestone island located in the Jamaica Channel, between Jamaica and Haiti.

=== Caves ===

There are around 200 caves, including , , ,
, , , , , and on Isla de Mona, with thousands of examples of native art, marks and later on, graffiti.

===Climate===
The Isla de Mona has a tropical savanna climate (&quot;Aw&quot; according to the Köppen climate classification), with a dry season and wet season and the temperature being warm year-round. The average annual mean is , an average annual high is and an average annual low is . August, the warmest month, has a mean of and an average high of , while the coolest month, January, has a mean of and an average low of , although February has a lower average low at .

On July 2, 1996, the Isla de Mona recorded a temperature of , which is the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Puerto Rico.

Isla de Mona receives of precipitation annually over 126.5 precipitation days. Due to tropical cyclones, autumn is the wettest season, while winter is the driest. The wettest month is May, which receives of precipitation on average. October has 12.7 precipitation days on average, which is the highest of any month. January is the driest month, receiving , while April has the least precipitation days (8.3).

===Land cover===
Four types of land cover can be identified:

* Cactus (4.35 square miles) (11.27 km2)
* Highland forest (15.55 square miles) (40.28 km2)
* Central Depression forest (0.57 square miles) (1.47 km2)
* Coastal forest (1.46 square miles) (3.77 km2)

===Beaches===

Mona Island hosts a large and increasing hawksbill sea turtle (&quot;Eretmochelys imbricata&quot;) rookery with over 1,500 clutches laid annually on its beaches. The island is recognized as one of the principal sites for hawksbill nesting in the Wider Caribbean and Western Atlantic region, along with Mexico (Yucatán Peninsula beaches), Barbados, Panama (Bocas del Toro), and Brazil.


The only campsites are at &quot;Playa de Pájaros&quot; and &quot;Playa Sardinera&quot;. In addition, Playa Uveros, Pájaros, Playa Mujeres and Playa Brava are important to visitors.

==Mona Island today==
The island presently serves as a retreat for Puerto Ricans and nature enthusiasts from all around the world, and has also become a popular destination for Puerto Rican Boy and Girl Scouts. Due to the islands&#x27; unique topography, ecology and location, Mona, Desecheo and Monito have been nicknamed &quot;The Galápagos Islands of the Caribbean&quot;. Scientists, ecologists, and students have visited Mona Island to explore its distinct ecosystem, which includes the endemic Mona Ground Iguana. The island is also home to many cave drawings that were left behind by the island&#x27;s original inhabitants. Remains of the guano mining industry can also be seen.

An FAA-certified airport that can handle small aircraft was built by the Puerto Rican government. This airport has no ICAO or IATA code. The United States Coast Guard is able to provide transportation with helicopter flights from Rafael Hernández Airport in Aguadilla, to help with medicines and first aid equipment; they also fly whenever an emergency requiring hospitalization occurs. Private and commercial planes require a special permit issued by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources to use the airport&#x27;s facilities.

The most common form of transportation is by private yacht, though commercial excursions are available from Cabo Rojo for small groups of up to twelve people traveling together.

Hunting is permitted in season to control the population growth of non-indigenous species (goats and wild boars) because they can represent a threat to various endangered species. The hunting season usually commences in December and ends in April. Camping is allowed from May through November.

In recent years, the island has become a major drop-off point especially for Dominicans, as well as Haitians and Cubans trying to reach Puerto Rico illegally. As a U.S. Commonwealth, Puerto Rico is seen by many undocumented migrants as a stepping stone to the United States, but they are usually deported immediately.

Due to the island&#x27;s natural and cultural importance there has been interest in seeking world heritage status for Mona as a UNESCO World Heritage Site by the Puerto Rican government.

<text>A hacienda ( or ; or ) is an estate (or &quot;finca&quot;), similar to a Roman &quot;latifundium&quot;, in Spain and the former Spanish Empire. With origins in Andalusia, &quot;haciendas&quot; were variously plantations (perhaps including animals or orchards), mines or factories, with many &quot;haciendas&quot; combining these activities. The word is derived from Spanish &quot;hacer&quot; (to make, from Latin &quot;facere&quot;) and &quot;haciendo&quot; (making), referring to productive business enterprises.

The term &quot;hacienda&quot; is imprecise, but usually refers to landed estates of significant size, while smaller holdings were termed &quot;estancias&quot; or &quot;ranchos&quot;. All colonial &quot;haciendas&quot; were owned almost exclusively by Spaniards and criollos, or rarely by mixed-race individuals. In Argentina, the term &quot;estancia&quot; is used for large estates that in Mexico would be termed &quot;haciendas&quot;. In recent decades, the term has been used in the United States for an architectural style associated with the traditional estate manor houses.

The &quot;hacienda&quot; system of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Guatemala, El Salvador, Mexico, New Granada, and Peru was an economic system of large land holdings. A similar system existed on a smaller scale in the Philippines and Puerto Rico. In Puerto Rico, &quot;haciendas&quot; were larger than &quot;estancias&quot;; ordinarily grew sugar cane, coffee, or cotton; and exported their crops abroad.

==Origins and growth==
&quot;Haciendas&quot; originated during the &quot;Reconquista&quot; of Andalusia in Spain. The sudden acquisition of conquered land allowed kings to grant extensive holdings to nobles, mercenaries, and religious military orders to reward their military service. Andalusian &quot;haciendas&quot; produced wine, grain, oils, and livestock, and were more purely agricultural than what was to follow in Spanish America.

During the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the &quot;hacienda&quot; model was exported to the New World, continuing the pattern of the &quot;Reconquista&quot;. As the Spanish established cities in conquered territories, the crown distributed smaller plots of land nearby, while in areas farther afield, the conquistadores were allotted large land grants which became haciendas and estancias. Haciendas were developed as profit-making enterprises linked to regional or international markets. Estates were integrated into a market-based economy aimed at the Hispanic sector and cultivated crops such as sugar, wheat, fruits and vegetables and produced animal products such as meat, wool, leather, and tallow.

The system in Mexico is considered to have started when the Spanish crown granted to Hernán Cortés the title of Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca in 1529, including the entire present state of Morelos, as well as vast encomienda labor grants. Although haciendas originated in grants to the elite, many ordinary Spaniards could also petition for land grants from the crown. New haciendas were formed in many places in the 17th and 18th centuries as most local economies moved from mining toward agriculture and husbandry.

Distribution of land happened in parallel with the allocation of indigenous people to servitude under the encomienda system. Although the hacienda was not directly linked to the encomienda, many Spanish holders of encomiendas lucratively combined the two by acquiring land or developing enterprises to employ that forced labor. As the crown moved to eliminate encomienda labor, Spaniards consolidated private landholdings and recruited labor on a permanent or casual basis. Eventually, the hacienda became secure private property, which survived the colonial period and into the 20th century.

==Personnel==
In Spanish America, the owner of an hacienda was called the &quot;hacendado&quot; or &quot;patrón&quot;. Most owners of large and profitable haciendas preferred to live in Spanish cities, often near the hacienda, but in Mexico, the richest owners lived in Mexico City, visiting their haciendas at intervals. Onsite management of the rural estates was by a paid administrator or manager, which was similar to the arrangement with the encomienda. Administrators were often hired for a fixed term of employment, receiving a salary and at times some share of the profits of the estate. Some administrators also acquired landholdings themselves in the area of the estate they were managing. 


The work force on haciendas varied, depending on the type of hacienda and where it was located. In central Mexico near indigenous communities and growing crops to supply urban markets, there was often a small, permanent workforce resident on the hacienda. Labor could be recruited from nearby indigenous communities on an as-needed basis, such as planting and harvest time. The permanent and temporary hacienda employees worked land that belonged to the &quot;patrón&quot; and under the supervision of local labor bosses. In some places small scale cultivators or &quot;campesinos&quot; worked small holdings belonging to the hacendado, and owed a portion of their crops to him.

Stock raising was central to ranching haciendas, the largest of which were in areas without dense indigenous populations, such as northern Mexico, but as indigenous populations declined in central areas, more land became available for grazing. Livestock were animals originally imported from Spain, including cattle, horses, sheep, and goats were part of the Columbian Exchange and produced significant ecological changes. Sheep in particular had a devastating impact on the environment due to overgrazing. Mounted ranch hands variously called &quot;vaqueros&quot; and &quot;gauchos&quot; (in the Southern Cone), among other terms worked for pastoral haciendas.

Where the hacienda included working mines, as in Mexico, the &quot;patrón&quot; might gain immense wealth. The unusually large and profitable Jesuit &quot;hacienda&quot; Santa Lucía, near Mexico City, established in 1576 and lasting to the expulsion in 1767, has been reconstructed by Herman Konrad from archival sources. This reconstruction has revealed the nature and operation of the hacienda system in Mexico, its labor force, its systems of land tenure and its relationship to larger Hispanic society in Mexico.

The Catholic Church and orders, especially the Jesuits, acquired vast &quot;hacienda&quot; holdings or preferentially loaned money to the hacendados. As the hacienda owners&#x27; mortgage holders, the Church&#x27;s interests were connected with the landholding class. In the history of Mexico and other Latin American countries, the masses developed some hostility to the church; at times of gaining independence or during certain political movements, the people confiscated the church haciendas or restricted them.

Haciendas in the Caribbean were developed primarily as sugar plantations were dependent on the labor of African slaves imported to the region and staffed by slaves brought from Africa. In Puerto Rico, this system ended with the abolition of slavery on 22 March 1873.

==South American haciendas==
In South America, the &quot;hacienda&quot; remained after the collapse of the colonial system in the early 19th century when nations gained independence. In some places, such as Dominican Republic, with independence came efforts to break up the large plantation holdings into a myriad of small subsistence farmers&#x27; holdings, an agrarian revolution.
In Bolivia, haciendas were prevalent until the 1952 Revolution of Víctor Paz Estenssoro. He established an extensive program of land distribution as part of the Agrarian Reform. Likewise, Peru had haciendas until the Agrarian Reform (1969) of Juan Velasco Alvarado, who expropriated the land from the hacendados and redistributed it to the peasants.

===Chile===
The first haciendas of Chile formed during the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. The Destruction of the Seven Cities following the battle of Curalaba (1598) meant for the Spanish the loss of both the main gold districts and the largest sources of indigenous labour. After those dramatic years the colony of Chile became concentrated in Central Chile which became increasingly populated, explored and economically exploited. Much land in Central Chile was cleared with fire during this period. On the contrary open fields in southern Chile were overgrown as indigenous populations declined due to diseases introduced by the Spanish and intermittent warfare. The loss of the cities meant Spanish settlements in Chile became increasingly rural with the hacienda gaining importance in economic and social matters. As Chilean mining activity declined in the 17th century more haciendas were formed as the economy moved away from mining and into agriculture and husbandry.

Beginning in the late 17th century Chilean haciendas begun to export wheat to Peru. While the immediate cause of this was Peru being struck by both an earthquake and a stem rust epidemic, Chilean soil and climatic conditions were better for cereal production than those of Peru and Chilean wheat was cheaper and of better quality than Peruvian wheat. Initially Chilean haciendas could not meet the wheat demand due to a labour shortage, so had to incorporate temporary workers in addition to the permanent staff. Another response by the latifundia to labour shortages was to act as merchants, buying wheat produced by independent farmers or from farmers that hired land. In the period 1700 to 1850, this second option was overall more lucrative. It was primarily the haciendas of Central Chile, La Serena and Concepción that came to be involved in cereal export to Peru.

In the 19th and early 20th century haciendas were the main prey for Chilean banditry. 20th century Chilean haciendas stand out for the poor conditions of workers and being a backward part of the economy. The hacienda and inquilinaje institutions that characterized large parts of Chilean agriculture were eliminated by the Chilean land reform (1962–1973).

==Other locations==
===Philippines===

In the Philippines, the &quot;hacienda&quot; system and lifestyles were influenced by the Spanish colonisation that occurred via Mexico for more than 300 years, but which only took off in the 1850s at the behest of Nicholas Loney, an English businessman and the British Empire&#x27;s vice-consul in the city of Iloílo. Loney&#x27;s objective, according to Alfred W. McCoy, was the systematic deindustrialisation of Iloílo. This deindustrialisation was to be accomplished through shifting labour and capital from Iloílo&#x27;s textile industry (), the origins of which predate the arrival of the Castilians, to sugar-production on the neighbouring island of Negros. The Port of Iloílo was also opened to the flood of cheaply priced British textiles. These changes had the double effect of strengthening England and Scotland&#x27;s textile industries at the expense of Iloílo&#x27;s and satisfying the growing European demand for sugar.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, attempts to abolish the &quot;hacienda&quot; system in the country through land-reform laws have not been successful. The expiration of the Laurel–Langley Agreement and the resultant collapse of the Negros sugar industry gave President Ferdinand E. E. Marcos the opening to strip the &quot;hacenderos&quot; of their self-appointed roles as kingmakers in national politics. Hopes were short-lived, however, as protests revolving around Hacienda Luisita, as well as massacres and targeted assassinations in the Negros provinces, continue to this day. The opportunity that had earlier arisen was squandered and any significant gains stillborn.

===Puerto Rico===
Haciendas in Puerto Rico developed during the time of Spanish colonization. An example of these was the 1833 Hacienda Buena Vista, which dealt primarily with the cultivation, packaging, and exportation of coffee. Today, Hacienda Buena Vista, which is listed in the United States National Register of Historic Places, is operated as a museum, Museo Hacienda Buena Vista.
The 1861 Hacienda Mercedita was a sugar plantation that once produced, packaged and sold sugar in the &quot;Snow White&quot; brand name. In the late 19th century, Mercedita became the site of production of Don Q rum. Its profitable rum business is today called Destilería Serrallés. The last of such haciendas decayed considerably starting in the 1950s, with the industrialization of Puerto Rico via &quot;Operation Bootstrap&quot;. At the turn of the 20th century, most coffee haciendas had disappeared.

The sugar-based haciendas changed into &quot;centrales azucarelas.&quot; Yet by the 1990s, and despite significant government fiscal support, the last 13 Puerto Rican &quot;centrales azucares&quot; were forced to shut down. This marked the end of haciendas operating in Puerto Rico. In 2000, the last two sugar mills closed, after having operated for nearly 100 years.

An &quot;estancia&quot; was a similar type of food farm. An &quot;estancia&quot; differed from an hacienda in terms of crop types handled, target market, machinery used, and size. An estancia, during Spanish colonial times in Puerto Rico (1508 – 1898), was a plot of land used for cultivating &quot;frutos menores&quot; (minor crops). That is, the crops in such &quot;estancia&quot; farms were produced in relatively small quantities and thus were meant, not for wholesale or exporting, but for sale and consumption locally, where produced and its adjacent towns. Haciendas, unlike estancias, were equipped with industrial machinery used for processing its crops into derivatives such as juices, marmalades, flours, etc., for wholesale and exporting. Some &quot;frutos menores&quot; grown in estancias were rice, corn, beans, batatas, ñames, yautías, and pumpkins; among fruits were plantains, bananas, oranges, avocados, and grapefruits. Most haciendas in Puerto Rico produced sugar, coffee, and tobacco, which were the crops for exporting. Some estancias were larger than some haciendas, but generally this was the exception and not the norm.

<text>Hans Peter Moravec (born November 30, 1948, Kautzen, Austria) is computer scientist and an adjunct faculty member at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, USA. He is known for his work on robotics, artificial intelligence, and writings on the impact of technology. Moravec also is a futurist with many of his publications and predictions focusing on transhumanism. Moravec developed techniques in computer vision for determining the region of interest (ROI) in a scene.

== Career ==
Moravec attended Loyola College in Montreal for two years and transferred to Acadia University, where he received his BSc in mathematics in 1969. He received his MSc in computer science in 1971 from the University of Western Ontario. He then earned a PhD in computer science from Stanford University in 1980 for a TV-equipped robot which was remote controlled by a large computer (the Stanford Cart). The robot was able to negotiate cluttered obstacle courses. Another achievement in robotics was the discovery of new approaches for robot spatial representation such as 3D occupancy grids. He also developed the idea of bush robots.

Moravec joined the newly established Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon in 1980 as a research scientist, becoming research professor in 1995. He has been an adjunct professor at the institute since 2005.

Moravec was a cofounder of Seegrid Corporation of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 2003 which is a robotics company with one of its goals being to develop a fully autonomous robot capable of navigating its environment without human intervention.

He is also somewhat known for his work on space tethers.

==Futurism==

=== Predictions ===
Hans Moravec has made some concrete predictions as to the future of intelligence, by estimating the computational cost (measured in instructions per second) of various operations of human intelligence, and comparing it with the future of computer computational power as predicted by Moore&#x27;s law.

In &quot;When will computer hardware match the human brain&quot; (1998), he estimated that human brains operate at about formula_1 instructions per second, and that, if Moore&#x27;s law continues, a computer with the same speed would cost only 1000 USD (1997 dollars) in mid-2020s, thus &quot;computers suitable for humanlike robots will appear in the 2020s&quot;.

===&quot;Mind Children&quot;===
In his 1988 book &quot;Mind Children&quot;, Moravec outlines Moore&#x27;s law and predictions about the future of artificial life. Moravec outlines a timeline and a scenario in this regard, in that the robots will evolve into a new series of artificial species, starting around 2030–2040.

Moravec also outlined the &quot;neural substitution argument&quot; in &quot;Mind Children&quot;, published 7 years before David Chalmers published a similar argument in his paper &quot;Absent Qualia, Fading Qualia, Dancing Qualia&quot;, which is sometimes cited as the source of the idea. The neural substitution argument is that if each neuron in a conscious brain can be replaced successively by an electronic substitute with the same behavior as the neuron it replaces, then a biological consciousness would be transferred seamlessly into an electronic computer, thus proving that consciousness does not depend on biology and can be treated as an abstract computable process.

===&quot;Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind&quot;===
In &quot;Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind&quot;, published in 1999, Moravec further considers the implications of evolving robot intelligence, generalizing Moore&#x27;s law to technologies predating the integrated circuit, and extrapolating it to predict a coming &quot;mind fire&quot; of rapidly expanding superintelligence.

Arthur C. Clarke wrote about this book: &quot;&quot;Robot&quot; is the most awesome work of controlled imagination I have ever encountered: Hans Moravec stretched my mind until it hit the stops.&quot; David Brin also praised the book: &quot;Moravec blends hard scientific practicality with a prophet&#x27;s far-seeing vision.&quot; On the other hand, the book was reviewed less favorably by Colin McGinn for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. McGinn wrote, &quot;Moravec … writes bizarre, confused, incomprehensible things about consciousness as an abstraction, like number, and as a mere &quot;interpretation&quot; of brain activity. He also loses his grip on the distinction between virtual and real reality as his speculations spiral majestically into incoherence.&quot;

<doc id="298558" wikidata="Q352213" url="?curid=298558" title="Upstream (software development)">
<text>In software development, when software has been forked or uses a chain of libraries/dependencies, upstream refers to an issue that occurs in software related to the chain. It is the direction that is toward the original authors or maintainers of software. It is usually used in the context of a version, a bug, or a patch.

Upstream development allows other distributions to benefit from it when they pick up the future release or merge recent (or all) upstream patches. Likewise, the original authors (maintaining upstream) can benefit from contributions that originate from custom distributions, if their users send patches upstream.

The term also pertains to bugs; responsibility for a bug is said to lie upstream when it is not caused through the distribution&#x27;s porting, non-upstream modification or integration efforts.

== Examples ==
* A patch &quot;sent upstream&quot; is offered to the original authors or maintainers of the software. If accepted, the authors or maintainers will include the patch in their software, either immediately or in a future release. If rejected, the person who submitted the patch will have to maintain his or her own distribution of the author&#x27;s software.
* Upstream repository or source code distribution &quot;version&quot;, which can either be a version-tagged release for which the source code has specifically been packaged, a specific commit, or master (jargon for latest commit). Where custom distributions (such as forks) may have missed out on bugfixes and improvements (maturing of the project tied to the original authors, upstream) as a result of not merging (all) upstream patches. In such cases, the custom distribution may even have been adapted to suit the specific needs and requirements of those using or maintaining it. This is also often seen with dependencies (vendor packages), where the taker just settles with a base version once and tends to stick with it, over time accumulating so many (arbitrary) modifications or non-standard uses in their environment that merging the latest upstream patches into their custom distribution won&#x27;t be possible without major additional work for patch and feature compatibility, and avoiding duplicate patches of bugs that they resolved by themselves (and in their own way) while upstream also has a patch for it. A lot of custom distribution users would still cherry-pick and merge critical upstream patches (such as security vulnerability related).

<doc id="298561" wikidata="Q92576" url="?curid=298561" title="Galaxy Express 999">
<text>is a Japanese manga series. It is written and illustrated by Leiji Matsumoto, later adapted into a number of anime films and television series. It is set in a spacefaring, high-tech future in which humans have learned how to transfer their minds and emotions with perfect fidelity into mechanical bodies, thus achieving practical immortality.

The manga won the Shogakukan Manga Award for shōnen in 1978. The anime series won the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize in 1981.

Matsumoto was inspired to create &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; by the idea of a steam train running through the stars in the novel &quot;Night on the Galactic Railroad&quot; by Kenji Miyazawa.

==Plot==
===Anime and manga===

An impoverished ten-year-old named Tetsuro Hoshino desperately wanted an indestructible machine body, giving him the ability to live forever and have the freedom that the unmechanized do not have. While machine bodies are impossibly expensive, they are supposedly given away for free on the planet Andromeda, the end of the line for the &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot;, a space train that only comes to Earth once a year.

The series begins with Tetsuro and his mother making their way to Megalopolis where they hope to get jobs to pay for passes for the &quot;999&quot;. Along the way, however, Count Mecha and a gang of &quot;human hunters&quot; kill Tetsuro&#x27;s mother. Before she dies, she tells him to continue the journey they started and to get a machine body to live the eternal life she could not. Tetsuro tries to forge on toward the city alone but is quickly overcome by the brutal cold and wind. As he succumbs, he cries out an apology to his mother for failing to fulfill her wish and hopes that in his next life, he will be born as a robot to begin with.

Tetsuro is surprised to awaken by the fireplace in the home of a beautiful woman, Maetel, who is the spitting image of his dead mother. Maetel tells him she had heard the entire incident with a long-range directional microphone she had been idly scanning around the area with. Maetel offers him an unlimited use pass for the &quot;999&quot; if he will be her traveling companion, to which Tetsuro agrees. She provides him with a gun and directs him to the Count&#x27;s residence, telling him that the Count and his henchmen will be too distracted with their revelries to defend themselves against a surprise attack. Tetsuro bursts in on them in their meeting hall and cuts them down with a spray of gunfire. With the Earth police in hot pursuit, Tetsuro and Maetel flee the planet aboard the &quot;999&quot;.

Along the way, Tetsuro has many adventures on many different and exotic planets and meets many kinds of people, both human and alien, living and machine. Increasingly, Tetsuro realizes that a machine body will not fix all of his problems. Most of the machine people he meets regret the decision to give up their humanity.

Eventually, Tetsuro and Maetel reach the Planet Prometheum, the final stop for the &quot;999&quot;. He is shocked by the cruelty and indolence of the machine people there and witnesses a mechanized human committing suicide, an event to which the others react with scoffs and derision. He asks the dying man why he wished to end his life, and is told that eternal life on Prometheum is utterly empty of joy or purpose. When Tetsuro mentions the name of his traveling companion, the man is horrified and tells him that Maetel is the daughter of Queen Prometheum, the supreme ruler of the Machine Empire and that she is thoroughly untrustworthy. Tetsuro is outraged at having been kept in the dark and rushes off to confront Maetel. Maetel is at a loss for words, but a government spokeswoman inserts herself into their conversation and begins giving answers on Maetel&#x27;s behalf. Tetsuro is not impressed and he storms off in a blind fury.

Tetsuro does not understand why he has been betrayed by Maetel, but Maetel has plans of her own and seeks to destroy the mechanized civilization. With the help of her father, Dr. Ban (only named in the film), whose consciousness resides in a pendant she wears around her neck, Maetel destroys her mother and the planet. Afterward, Maetel and Tetsuro return to the penultimate station on the Planet of Bats where Tetsuro tells Maetel his intention to return to Earth and lead it toward a new future.

Maetel, proud of Tetsuro for his decision to reject mechanization, tells him she has something to take care of and that he should board first, but Tetsuro finds a letter from Maetel telling him that it is time for them to part ways. Maetel had secretly boarded the &quot;777&quot; (three-seven), a nearby train, with the intention of &quot;leading another boy to his future&quot;, but it is unclear as to whether or not this means that the Mechanization Empire still exists elsewhere, or if Maetel will lead the boy to some other &quot;future&quot;. The series ends as the trains both depart the Planet of Bats.

===Film versions===
====&quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot;====

The film version of &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; was released in 1979. Maetel and Tetsuro again set out for the home planet of the Mechanized Empire, visiting four planets. Planet Maetel is a mechanized world where machine bodies are made.

Godiego performed the film&#x27;s theme song &quot;The Galaxy Express 999&quot;.

====&quot;Adieu Galaxy Express 999&quot;====
&quot;Adieu Galaxy Express 999&quot; is a 1981 sequel to the film adaptation. &quot;Adieu&quot; presents an entirely new storyline that takes place three years after the destruction of Planet Maetel. The Machine Empire now has even more of a stranglehold over the Galaxy. Rumors are afoot of Maetel becoming its new Queen. Tetsuro, now a fifteen-year-old freedom fighter, is shocked when a messenger brings him news that the &quot;999&quot; is returning and that Maetel wants him to board it. Tetsuro narrowly makes his way to the &quot;999&quot; and departs Earth, now a battlefield.

Although Tetsuro finds that Maetel is not present on the &quot;999&quot;, he does meet Metalmena, a machine woman who has replaced the waitress Claire. Also, a mysterious Ghost Train has been traveling the universe and nearly crashes into &quot;999&quot;. The &quot;999&quot; heads to the planet La Metal, portrayed here as the birthplace of Prometheum and Maetel. Here Tetsuro helps in the resistance, befriending a cat-like teenage boy named Meowdar. While exploring the ruins of an old castle, Tetsuro discovers a portrait of a beautiful, blonde queen who looks very much like Maetel. He learns that it is, in fact, La Metal&#x27;s Queen Prometheum, even though she looks nothing like she did at their last confrontation. As the &quot;999&quot; departs, Maetel finally makes her appearance.

Shortly after leaving La Metal, the &quot;999&quot; is forced to dock at a station where Tetsuro meets a mysterious machine man named Faust. When Tetsuro attacks him, Faust causes Tetsuro to drop into a flashback where he must relive his mother&#x27;s death. The &quot;999&quot; continues to the planet Mosaic, the last stop before Great Andromeda, the capital of the mechanized empire. Here Tetsuro finds the Ghost Train and is nearly killed.

The &quot;999&quot; finally makes its way to Great Andromeda where Faust greets Tetsuro once more. Meanwhile, Maetel travels down to the center of the planet where Prometheum&#x27;s consciousness still exists. Maetel is put in charge of the mechanized empire, just as the rumors said, but again, she intends to put an end to the operations, and attempts to shut Prometheum&#x27;s machinery down. She reveals the horrible truth to Tetsuro that the energy the machine people use is drained from living human beings, and that they were transported there by the Ghost Train. Tetsuro is shocked to find his old friend Meowdar among a pile of dead, drained bodies. Metalmena shows indifference to Meowdar&#x27;s death until Tetsuro reveals the source of the energy she has been existing on. As a patrol of guards comes to arrest the group, Metalmena, disgusted and enraged by what she has learned, attacks and destroys them, apparently at the cost of her own life.

Prometheum proves that she cannot be killed with just the flip of a switch, and all seems hopeless. At about the same time, a space anomaly called &quot;Siren the Witch&quot; approaches Great Andromeda, attracted to its abundant energy and absorbing all machine energy. With Great Andromeda collapsing, the &quot;999&quot; is set to depart, but Tetsuro must face Faust one last time. After dealing Faust with a fatal blow, it is revealed to Tetsuro that Faust is Tetsuro&#x27;s father (in the manga and television series, it is never made clear what became of Tetsuro&#x27;s father). The &quot;999&quot; heads back to La Metal where Maetel and Tetsuro separate for the last time, and &quot;the boy [Tetsuro] becomes a man&quot;.

Two songs were written and performed by Mary MacGregor: &quot;Love Light&quot; and the ending theme &quot;Sayonara&quot; were used for the film. Kumiko Kaori recorded a Japanese version of the ending song.

Helen McCarthy in &quot;500 Essential Anime Movies&quot; called it a &quot;dense, fascinating story&quot;.

===New manga series and &quot;Eternal Fantasy&quot;===
In 1996, Matsumoto began a new &quot;GE999&quot; series, set a year after the original, in which the Earth is destroyed and Tetsuro sets out to discover the source of the &quot;darkness&quot; that threatens all life in the universe.

The film &quot;Galaxy Express 999: Eternal Fantasy&quot; was released in 1998. This film takes place a few years after the events of &quot;Adieu Galaxy Express 999&quot; and is the third film in the anime series, where Maetel and Tetsuro reunite to save the universe again from another evil. It also serves as a link between this film and &quot;The Galaxy Railways&quot;.

The Alfee performed the theme song &quot;Brave Love: Galaxy Express 999 / Beyond the Win&quot;.

Also, space battleship &quot;Yamato&quot;, from the Japanese show of the same name, and the English version of &quot;Star Blazers&quot;, which are both Matsumoto creations, make a cameo appearance.

The manga has been partially published in English by Viz. The film was released by Discotek Media on DVD on October 16, 2012 and Blu-ray in 2020. The latter includes a newly produced English dub by Sound Cadence Studios in Dallas, Texas with a new cast.

===&quot;Maetel Legend&quot; and &quot;Space Symphony Maetel&quot;===

Two-part OVA &quot;Maetel Legend&quot; serves as a prelude for &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; and explains the series&#x27; backstory. Maetel, the protagonist, is the daughter of Queen Prometheum of the Planet La Metal (both from &quot;Queen Millennia&quot;), a wandering planet, and one of the first civilizations to have mechanized their bodies. As Queen Prometheum becomes fearful of the natural decline of her people&#x27;s lifespan on their freezing world, which has fallen out of orbit, she decides to mechanize them all, in order to enable her people to survive the harsh climate. The complete series was released on DVD by Central Park Media.

Following on from &quot;Maetel Legend&quot;, TV series &quot;Space Symphony Maetel&quot; reveals that the newly created machine people of La Metal began to mechanize galaxy after galaxy against the will of many humans, and ended up creating rebellions and revolutions. Maetel is asked to return to La Metal to succeed her mother, only to discover the many hardships her mother has inflicted on the humans.

In this series, Captain Harlock and Emeraldas (Maetel&#x27;s sister) also appear and work together to assassinate Prometheum, along with Maetel. Parallels with &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; are prevalent. Instead of a boy who wants a mechanized body meeting her, she meets a boy who has a grudge against Prometheum and detests being mechanized.

The final lines of dialogue reveal that this is a prequel to the 1979 film &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot;.

===&quot;Galaxy Railways: Letter from the Abandoned Planet&quot;===
This OVA series was released from December 30, 2006, to January 5, 2007 (on SKY PerfectTV!) in Japan. The story takes place between Seasons 1 and 2 of &quot;Galaxy Railways: Crossroad to Eternity&quot;, and presumably after the events of &quot;Galaxy Express 999: Eternal Fantasy&quot;, where the Earth has since been destroyed. The OVAs featured Maetel, Tetsuro, and the Conductor, with their original voice actors from the &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; television series.

For unknown reasons, this series started production earlier than &quot;Galaxy Railways: Crossroad to Eternity&quot;, but was aired much later.

===&quot;Another Story: Ultimate Journey&quot;===
A manga re-telling of the original manga illustrated by Yuzuru Shimazaki began serialization in Akita Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Champion Red&quot; magazine on March 19, 2018. The manga was part of a project celebrating Matsumoto&#x27;s 80th birthday. The future of the manga was unknown due to Leiji Matsumoto&#x27;s death in 2023, but the manga returns in December 2024 after a two-and-a-half-year hiatus.

==Characters==
* : The main character of &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot;, Tetsuro is a poor Earth boy who witnessed his mother die at the hands of Count Mecha. With his mother&#x27;s dying wish being for him to obtain a machine body, Tetsuro embarks on the &quot;Galaxy Express&quot; with Maetel. Tetsuro has also been mentioned in the 2014 &quot;Captain Harlock: Dimensional Voyage&quot; manga.
* : The mysterious blonde woman who accompanies Tetsuro on the &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot;, Maetel is in actuality the daughter of Queen Prometheum, ruler of the mechanized empire. In the film version, Maetel is responsible for bringing youths from around the universe to the mechanized homeworld where they are turned into mechanized human components to serve the mechanized empire, whereas in the television series, she is grooming them to grow up to become generals in her mother&#x27;s imperial military. Maetel is secretly plotting with her father, Dr. Ban (who is contained within the pendant around her neck) to destroy the machine empire, and finally does so (in the film) when it is Tetsuro&#x27;s turn to be turned into a bolt. Maetel&#x27;s soul exists in the body of a human copy, which she occupies until it grows old and she exchanges it for a new one. It is explained in the film version that she occupies a clone of the body of Tetsuro&#x27;s mother, which explains the resemblance between the two.
* : The Conductor is the main crew member of the &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot;. He is an alien being with an invisible body made of gas; only his eyes can be seen while he is wearing his conductor uniform. The Conductor prefers to go &#x27;strictly by the book&#x27; and frequently cites the &quot;Galaxy Express&quot; rule book, but occasionally ends up bending the rules and getting into adventures with Tetsuro and Maetel.
* : The dining car waitress on the &quot;999&quot;, Claire has a machine body made of clear crystal glass. Unlike others who gave up their humanity by choice, Claire was forced into this existence by her vain mother. She works on the &quot;999&quot; in order to save up enough money to buy back her human body, which is stored on Pluto. Claire quickly befriends Tetsuro and sacrifices herself for him when a hallucination taking the guise of his mother tries to pull him out of the train. Her body is shattered, and all that remains is a single glass tear which Tetsuro holds with him as a memento. In the film version, Claire has a somewhat larger role, but suffers the same fate, sacrificing herself for Tetsuro when Prometheum tries to kill him (a machine girl named &quot;Mirai&quot; (&quot;Future&quot;) has this role in the television series). Claire returns to life in both &quot;Eternal Fantasy&quot; and the new &quot;Galaxy Express&quot; manga published by Matsumoto in the 1990s.
* &#x27; and &#x27;: Famous space pirates who are idolized by Tetsuro. Both have only minor cameos in the original manga and television series, but have significantly larger roles in the films and assist in defeating the machine empire.
* : A well known bandit who sneaks aboard the &quot;999&quot; after their stop on the planet Titan. Antares despises machine people for the death of his wife and has many unexploded bullets lodged within his abdomen. He warns Tetsuro to &quot;shoot first, ask questions later&quot;. In the manga and television series he lives in a large home with his many children; in the film he lives on Titan with other bandits and many children orphaned by Count Mecha. In the film version he assists Tetsuro in his quest to kill Count Mecha at the Time Castle, and is killed when the bullets in his body explode after taking multiple shots from the Count.
* : The wealthy machine man who murdered Tetsuro&#x27;s mother. In the manga and television series, he is a minor aristocrat, and is killed by Tetsuro before he leaves Earth. In the film version he appears to have considerably more power, and rules the Time Castle. Acquiring a machine body to get revenge on Count Mecha is Tetsuro&#x27;s primary motivation in the film version, and he accomplishes his goal with the assistance of Antares while on the planet Heavy Melder.
* : Maetel&#x27;s mother, and ruler of the mechanized empire. Once a gentle woman, Prometheum created the machine empire believing it would be good for humanity. Prometheum has considerably difference physical characteristics in each of her appearances, appearing as a humanoid in the television series and film, and a two-faced head in the manga. Prometheum is destroyed with the destruction of Andromeda in the manga and television series, and killed by Claire in the film version. Her spirit occupies the planet Great Andromeda in &quot;Adieu Galaxy Express 999&quot; but perishes when that planet is destroyed by Siren the Witch.

==English-language versions==
In 1980, Roger Corman produced an English-language dub of the first &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; film. The film changed the character names (for example changing Tetsuro to Joey and Harlock to Warlock), and removed approximately 30 minutes of content. Antonia Levi, the author of &quot;Samurai from Outer Space&quot;, said that the edited film, released by New World Pictures, was &quot;heavily edited&quot; and that many &quot;otaku&quot; fans considered it too damaged to watch.

In 1986, Harmony Gold produced rarely seen English dubs of two of the &quot;GE999&quot; television specials, &quot;Galaxy Express 999: Can You Live Like a Warrior?&quot; and &quot;Galaxy Express 999: Can You Love Like a Mother?&quot;

In the late 1980s the TV series only aired with English subtitles on the Nippon Golden Network.

The first film was dubbed into English again in 1996 by Viz, titled &quot;Galaxy Express 999: The Signature Edition&quot;. Released on VHS, this dub was produced by Ocean Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia, and was more true to the source material. Viz also released &quot;Adieu, Galaxy Express 999&quot; subbed and dubbed on VHS. They were never released on R1 DVD by the company. For years, the only official English-language release of &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; material on DVD were a Korean release of the two films which utilizes Viz&#x27;s subtitle scripts. The English dubs of both films were run regularly on the Canadian channel Space in 1997 and 1998. They were also run in a heavily edited form on the American Sci-Fi Channel.

Viz later released five volumes of the second &quot;Galaxy Express&quot; manga, which was the basis for the third film, &quot;Galaxy Express 999: Eternal Fantasy&quot;. The original manga has yet to be officially translated into English.

A subtitled version of the television series was available on IGN&#x27;s Direct2Drive service. The streaming website Crunchyroll began streaming a subtitled version in January 2009.

DVD versions of both &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; and &quot;Adieu, Galaxy Express 999&quot; were released in the United States on June 28, 2011 by Discotek Media. Both DVDs feature the English subbed and dubbed (Viz dub) versions of the films. Discotek also released &quot;Eternal Fantasy&quot; on DVD on October 16, 2012. It is in Japanese only, but with English subtitles. A Blu-ray release with a newly produced English dub was released in 2020. This dub was produced by Sound Cadence Studios in Dallas, Texas with a new cast.

The television series was licensed for a subtitled North American home video release by S&#x27;more Entertainment in 2012 as one their first anime releases.

Discotek Media released three Blu-ray sets for the entire series. They contain a new upscale that preserves more detail and grain, in contrast to Toei Company&#x27;s Blu-ray boxes that showed smeared colors to make the picture look smooth. Discotek&#x27;s first collection, titled &quot;Departure&quot;, which contains episodes 1–39, was released on December 24, 2019, followed by &quot;Layover&quot; on July 28, 2020, which contains episodes 40–76 and includes the TV special &quot;Can You Live Like a Warrior?&quot;, whose Harmony Gold dub has been restored for this release. The third collection &quot;Terminus&quot; was released on September 29, 2020. It contained episodes 77–113 along with TV specials &quot;Eternal Wanderer Emeraldas&quot; and &quot;Can You Love Like a Mother?&quot;, the latter&#x27;s dub also being restored.

==Video games==
The Nintendo DS and PlayStation games were not released outside Japan.
Game designer Fumito Ueda cited &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; as an inspiration behind his video game &quot;Ico&quot; (2001), which was influenced by the manga&#x27;s relationship involving a woman who is a guardian for the young hero as they adventure through the galaxy.

==Appearances in media==
* The anime was referenced in the song &quot;Express 999&quot; by South Korean female group Girls&#x27; Generation from their fourth Korean studio album &quot;I Got a Boy&quot;.
* &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; was mentioned in late Korean idol Sulli&#x27;s song &quot;On the Moon&quot;.
* &quot;Virtua Fighter 3&quot; contains a nod to the show as an Easter egg hidden in one of the game&#x27;s secret stages where upon completing a specific move, a subway train will fly in the background.
* &quot;&quot; has a lot of direct similarities with &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot;, including the concept of a train that travels through space to different planets.

<text>Samuel John &quot;Lightnin&#x27;&quot; Hopkins (March 15, 1912 – January 30, 1982) was an American country blues singer, songwriter, guitarist and occasional pianist from Centerville, Texas. In 2010, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked him No. 71 on its list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time.

The musicologist Robert &quot;Mack&quot; McCormick opined that Hopkins is &quot;the embodiment of the jazz-and-poetry spirit, representing its ancient form in the single creator whose words and music are one act&quot;. He influenced Townes Van Zandt, Hank Williams, Jr., and a generation of blues musicians such as Stevie Ray Vaughan, whose Grammy-nominated song &quot;Rude Mood&quot; was directly inspired by the Texan&#x27;s song &quot;Hopkins&#x27; Sky Hop&quot;. In his own lifetime, Hopkins was one of the initial inductees in 1980 to the Blues Hall of Fame.

Hopkins was born in Centerville, Texas. As a child, he was immersed in the sounds of the blues. He developed a deep appreciation for the music at the age of eight, when he met Blind Lemon Jefferson at a church picnic in Buffalo, Texas. He went on to learn from his distant older cousin, the country blues singer Alger &quot;Texas&quot; Alexander; Hopkins had another cousin, the Texas electric blues guitarist Frankie Lee Sims, with whom he later recorded. Hopkins began accompanying Jefferson on guitar at informal church gatherings. Jefferson reputedly never let anyone play with him except Hopkins, and Hopkins learned much from Jefferson at these gatherings.

In the mid-1930s, Hopkins was sent to Houston County Prison Farm, but why he was imprisoned is unknown. In the late 1930s, he moved to Houston with Alexander in an unsuccessful attempt to break into the music scene there. By the early 1940s, he was back in Centerville, working as a farm hand.

Hopkins took a second shot at Houston in 1946. While singing on Dowling Street in Houston&#x27;s Third Ward, which would become his home base, he was discovered by Lola Anne Cullum of Aladdin Records, based in Los Angeles. She convinced Hopkins to travel to Los Angeles, where he accompanied the pianist Wilson Smith. The duo recorded twelve tracks in their first sessions in 1946. An Aladdin executive decided the pair needed more dynamism in their names and dubbed Hopkins &quot;Lightnin&#x27;&quot; and Wilson &quot;Thunder&quot;.

Hopkins recorded more sides for Aladdin in 1947. He returned to Houston and began recording for Gold Star Records. In the late 1940s and 1950s he rarely performed outside Texas, only occasionally traveling to the Midwest and the East for recording sessions and concert appearances. He performed regularly at nightclubs in and around Houston, particularly on Dowling Street, where he had been discovered by Aladdin. He recorded the hit records &quot;T-Model Blues&quot; and &quot;Tim Moore&#x27;s Farm&quot; at SugarHill Recording Studios in Houston. By the mid- to late 1950s, his prodigious output of high-quality recordings had gained him a following among African Americans and blues aficionados.

In 1959, the blues researcher Robert &quot;Mack&quot; McCormick contacted Hopkins, hoping to bring him to the attention of a broader musical audience engaged in the folk revival. McCormack presented Hopkins to integrated audiences first in Houston and then in California. He made his debut at Carnegie Hall on October 14, 1960, alongside Joan Baez and Pete Seeger, performing the spiritual &quot;Mary Don&#x27;t You Weep&quot;. In 1960, he signed with Tradition Records. The recordings which followed included his song &quot;Mojo Hand&quot; in 1962.

In 1968, Hopkins recorded the album &quot;Free Form Patterns&quot;, backed by the rhythm section of the psychedelic rock band 13th Floor Elevators. Through the 1960s and into the 1970s, he released one or sometimes two albums a year and toured, playing at major folk music festivals and at folk clubs and on college campuses in the U.S. and internationally. He toured extensively in the United States and played a six-city tour of Japan in 1978.

Hopkins was Houston&#x27;s poet-in-residence for 35 years. He recorded more albums than any other blues musician. Hopkins was one of the initial inductees to the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980.

Hopkins died of esophageal cancer in Houston on January 30, 1982, at the age of 69. His obituary in the &quot;New York Times&quot; described him as &quot;one of the great country blues singers and perhaps the greatest single influence on rock guitar players&quot;. Hopkins is buried at Forest Park Lawndale Cemetery in Houston, Texas.

A statue of Hopkins, unveiled in 2003, sits in Crockett, Texas. His Gibson J-160e &quot;hollowbox&quot; is on display at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, and his Guild Starfire at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., both on loan from the Joe Kessler Collection.

==Musical style==

Hopkins&#x27;s style was born from spending many hours playing informally without a backing band. His distinctive fingerstyle technique often included playing, in effect, bass, rhythm, lead, and percussion at the same time. He played both &quot;alternating&quot; and &quot;monotonic&quot; bass styles incorporating imaginative, often chromatic turnarounds and single-note lead lines. Tapping or slapping the body of his guitar added rhythmic accompaniment.

Much of Hopkins&#x27;s music follows the standard 12-bar blues template, but his phrasing was free and loose. Many of his songs were in the talking blues style, but he was a powerful and confident singer. Lyrically, his songs expressed the problems of life in the segregated South, bad luck in love and other subjects common in the blues idiom. He dealt with these subjects with humor and good nature. He often referred to himself as &quot;Po&#x27; Lightnin&#x27;&quot; in his songs when talking about himself or referring to himself as the protagonist of the song. This is also the name of one of his albums. Many of his songs are filled with double entendres, and he was known for his humorous introductions to songs.

Some of his songs were of warning and sour prediction, such as &quot;Fast Life Woman&quot;:

<text>Legal immunity, or immunity from prosecution, is a legal status wherein an individual or entity cannot be held liable for a violation of the law, in order to facilitate societal aims that outweigh the value of imposing liability in such cases. Such legal immunity may be from criminal prosecution, or from civil liability (being subject of lawsuit), or both. The most notable forms of legal immunity are parliamentary immunity and witness immunity. One author has described legal immunity as &quot;the obverse of a legal power&quot;:

==Criticism==
Legal immunities may be subject to criticism because they institute a separate standard of conduct for those who receive them. For example, as one author notes:

==Types==
===Immunity of government leaders===
Many forms of immunity are granted to government leaders to rule over the world, continent, nation, province, urban area and rural area without fear of being sued or charged with a crime for so doing: 
*Sovereign immunity, the prevention of lawsuits or prosecution against rulers or governments without their given consent
*Sovereign immunity in the United States bars suit against federal, state, and tribal governments, which cannot be sued without their consent. Governmental consent to be sued is expressed through legislation as a limited waiver of sovereign immunity 
*Parliamentary immunity, immunity granted to government leaders during their tenure and in the course of their duties
*Speech or Debate Clause, a provision in the United States Constitution that provides immunity to members of Congress for statements made in either house
*Immunity from prosecution (international law), exclusion of elected officials from prosecution under international law
*State immunity, principle of international law that the government of a state is not amenable before the courts of another state

===Immunity of government officials===
*Judicial immunity, the absolute (sovereign) immunity of a judiciary in the course of their official duties
*Qualified immunity, in the United States, sovereign immunity of all government officials and government employees performing tasks as part of the government&#x27;s actions
*Absolute immunity, a type of sovereign immunity for all government officials and government employees that confers total immunity when acting in the course of their duties
*Diplomatic immunity, agreement between sovereign governments to exclude diplomats from local laws because grants of immunity are particularly important in intergovernmental relations, where traditions have arisen to prevent the federal civil servants of a country&#x27;s foreign service cadre from being harassed by their host countries.

Such immunities may be granted by law (statutory or constitutional) or by treaty.

===Immunity of resident citizens of a country participating in the legal process===
*Amnesty law, a law that provides immunity for past crimes
*Spousal privilege, also called spousal immunity, protects a spouse from testifying against the defendant
*Witness immunity, immunity granted to a witness in exchange for testimony

===Immunity of private officials===
*Reporter&#x27;s privilege, a limited First Amendment right many jurisdictions by statutory law or judicial decision have by which journalists may not be prosecuted for protecting their confidential sources from discovery

===Immunity of nonprofit organizations ===
*Charitable immunity, immunity from liability granted to charities in many countries from the 19th century to the mid-20th century

Such immunities may be granted by law or, for witness immunity, by prosecutors or other authorities on a case-by-case basis, commonly as an agreement with the witnesses.

*Rendition (law)

<text>is a 1997 Japanese animated psychological thriller film directed by Satoshi Kon. It is loosely based on the novel by Yoshikazu Takeuchi, with a screenplay by Sadayuki Murai. Featuring the voices of Junko Iwao, Rica Matsumoto, Shiho Niiyama, Masaaki Okura, Shinpachi Tsuji and Emiko Furukawa, the plot follows a member of a Japanese idol group who retires from music to pursue an acting career. As she becomes a victim of stalking by her obsessive fan, gruesome murders take place, and she begins losing her grip on reality. The film deals with the blurring of the line between fantasy and reality, a commonly found theme in Kon&#x27;s other works, such as &quot;Millennium Actress&quot; (2001) and &quot;Paprika&quot; (2006).

== Plot ==
Mima Kirigoe decides to leave the J-pop idol group she is a member of, CHAM!, to become a full-time actress. Many of her fans are dismayed by her change from a clean-cut image, particularly an obsessive fan, Me-Mania, who begins stalking her. Following directions from a fan letter, Mima discovers a website called &quot;Mima&#x27;s Room&quot; comprising public diary entries written from her perspective, recording her daily life and private thoughts in great detail. She confides in her manager, former pop idol Rumi Hidaka, about the site, but Rumi advises her to ignore it.

Mima lands a minor role in the television detective drama &quot;Double Bind&quot;; however, her agent, Tadokoro, lobbies the producers of &quot;Double Bind&quot; and succeeds in securing Mima a larger part, though her new role requires her to film a rape scene. Despite Rumi&#x27;s objections, Mima accepts the role, although filming the scene proves acutely distressing. Between the ongoing stresses of filming &quot;Double Bind&quot;, her lingering regret over leaving CHAM!, and the paranoia she experiences from being stalked, Mima is distressed about her double life and begins to suffer from psychosis. She especially struggles to distinguish real life from her acting pursuits, and is repeatedly visited by an apparition of her former idol self, who claims to be &quot;the real Mima.&quot;

A string of murders is committed, all against people who have been involved in Mima&#x27;s acting career in some respect. Mima finds evidence in her closet suggesting her to be the prime suspect. Her increasing mental instability makes her doubt her own memories and innocence, as she vaguely recalls brutally murdering photographer Murano after he implored her to allow him to take naked photos of her. Mima manages to finish shooting &quot;Double Bind&quot;, the final scene of which reveals that her character killed and assumed the identity of her sister due to trauma-induced dissociative identity disorder. After the filming staff have left the studio, Me-Mania, acting on e-mailed instructions from &quot;the real Mima&quot; to &quot;eliminate the impostor,&quot; corners Mima and attempts to rape and kill her, but Mima bludgeons him with a hammer and escapes. Later, Me-Mania is murdered by &quot;the real Mima&quot; for failing to kill Mima.

Rumi finds Mima backstage and takes her to her home. Mima discovers that Rumi&#x27;s bedroom is a replica of her own, and realizes that Rumi is the one behind &quot;Mima&#x27;s Room,&quot; the serial murders, and the doppelgänger that manipulated Me-Mania. Displeased by Mima retiring from the idol industry, Rumi developed an alternate personality of the &quot;real Mima,&quot; now seeking to destroy and replace her in order to redeem her image. Rumi pursues Mima through the city, culminating in Mima accidentally incapacitating Rumi with a mirror shard during a struggle. Rumi stumbles into the street and the path of an oncoming truck; hallucinating the headlights as stage lights, she smiles and poses instead of moving out of the way, but Mima manages to save her from being run over at the last moment.

Sometime later, Mima, now a well-known actress, visits Rumi in a mental institution. Rumi&#x27;s doctor says Rumi still believes she is a pop idol most of the time. Mima says she has learned a lot from her experiences with Rumi. As Mima leaves the hospital, she overhears two nurses, who recognize her but conclude that she must just be a look-alike, as the real Mima Kirigoe would have no reason to visit a mental institution. As Mima enters her car, she smiles at herself in the rear-view mirror before declaring, &quot;No, I&#x27;m the real thing.&quot;

== Cast ==

The following actors in the English adaptation are listed in the credits without specification to their respective roles: James Lyon, Frank Buck, David Lucas, Elliot Reynolds, Kermit Beachwood, Sam Strong, Carol Stanzione, Ty Webb, Billy Regan, Dari Mackenzie, George C. Cole, Syd Fontana, Sven Nosgard, Bob Marx, Devon Michaels, Robert Wicks and Mattie Rando.

== Production ==

This film was Satoshi Kon&#x27;s first directorial effort.
Masao Maruyama, a producer at Madhouse at the time, appreciated Kon&#x27;s work on the OVA &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; and contacted him to ask if he would be interested in directing in the fall of 1994.
The original author, Yoshikazu Takeuchi, allegedly first planned a live-action film based on his novel. However, due to funding difficulties, it was downgraded to direct-to-video and then direct-to-video animation.
When Kon received the initial offer, it was for an OVA project, so he made &quot;Perfect Blue&quot; as a video animation.
Then, it was decided to be released as a movie in a hurry just before its completion.
This work was originally made as a video animation for a narrow market, so it was expected to disappear as soon as a few people talked about it.
The fact that such a work was treated as a film, invited to many film festivals around the world, and released as a package in many countries was unexpected for those involved.
Psychological horror was not a mainstream genre in Japanese animation, and there was no precedent for it at the time, so it would normally have been rejected.

By the time Kon was offered the job, the title &quot;Perfect Blue&quot; and the content, a story about a B-class idol and a perverted fan had already been set.
He hadn&#x27;t read the original novel and only read the script for the film, which was said to be close to the original, and the script was never used in the actual film.
There is no play-within-a-play in the original story, nor is there a motif of blurring the boundary between dream and reality.
The first plot was a simple splatter/psycho-horror story about an idol girl that is attacked by a perverted fan who cannot tolerate her image change, and there were also many depictions of bleeding, so it was not suitable for Kon who does not like horror or idols.
Kon said that if he were free to make a plan, he would never have thought of such a setting.
This genre was overused, having already been dealt with in various works such as &quot;Se7en&quot;, &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; and &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; and was also something that anime was not good at.
Since most of the works in that genre pursue how perverted or crazy the perpetrators, the murderers, are, Kon focused on &quot;how the inner world of the protagonist, the victim, is broken by being targeted by the stalker&quot; in order to outsmart the audience.
On the other hand, the play within a play, &quot;Double Bind&quot;, is more like a parody than a straight psycho-horror, and he made it with the intention of criticizing Japanese TV dramas that are easily made by imitating Hollywood fads immediately.

Kon decided to take on the role of director because he couldn&#x27;t resist the allure of directing for the first time, and because the original author allowed him to change the story as he liked as long as he kept three things in mind to make the film work: the main character is a B-grade idol, she has a rabid fan (stalker), and it is a horror film.
So he took some elements from the original work, such as the uniquely Japanese existence of idols, the &quot;otaku&quot; fans that surround them, and the stalkers that have become more radical, and came up with as many ideas as possible with the scriptwriter, Sadayuki Murai, with the intention of using them to create a completely new story.
And the film needed a core motif, which had to be found not by the screenwriter or anyone else, but by the director, Kon himself.
So he came up with the motif of two things that should have a &quot;borderline&quot;, such as &quot;dream and reality&quot;, &quot;memory and fact&quot;, and &quot;oneself and others&quot;, becoming borderless and blending together, based on the short film &quot;Magnetic Rose&quot; (from &quot;Memories&quot;), for which he had written a script, and the suspended manga &quot;Opus&quot;. The concept of &quot;memory and fact&quot; in the plot was inspired by the album &quot;Sim City&quot; by Susumu Hirasawa. He said, &quot;This album is like a city that was suddenly created with a high degree of modernity without any evolutionary process. In the meantime, he came up with the idea that &quot;a character more like &#x27;me&#x27; than &#x27;I&#x27;, the protagonist, to the people around &#x27;me&#x27; &quot; is created on the Internet without &#x27;my&#x27; knowledge.
The character is &quot;the past me&quot; for the protagonist, and this &quot;other me&quot; that should have existed only on the Internet has materialized due to external factors (the consciousness of the fans who want the protagonist to be like that) and internal factors (the protagonist&#x27;s regret that she might have been more comfortable in the past). And then the composition that the character and the protagonist herself confronted emerged.
It was only then that he became convinced that this work could be established as his own video work.
Kon decided to interpret the original story above as a story about an idol girl who was broken down by a sudden change in her environment or by a stalker who targets her, and wrote a completely new script with Sadayuki Murai.
Initially, Murai wrote the first draft of the script, and Kon added or removed ideas from it. They spent a lot of time discussing, and many of the ideas came out of that.
Next, Kon wrote all the storyboards, where he also made changes to dialogue and other elements.
The drawing work was also carried out in parallel.

The company that purchased the videogram and television rights to &quot;Perfect Blue&quot; before the film was completed advised the distributor to submit the film to the Fantasia International Film Festival in Montreal, Canada, so that it could be released overseas first.
Since it was his first film, director Kon was still unknown. Therefore, the distributor introduced the film as the first directorial effort of a disciple of Katsuhiro Otomo, the creator of &quot;Akira&quot;, which had already become a hit overseas.
Otomo is credited as a planning collaborator, but he never arranged for the company to ask Kon to direct the film, nor was he involved in the film. However, it seems that Otomo once advised the original author about the circumstances of the animation industry when he was touting around the animation project here and there.
At Fantasia, the film was so well received that a second screening was hurriedly arranged for those who could not see it, and it was eventually voted by the audience as the best international film.
Thanks to that, the distributor began to receive invitations from more than 50 film festivals, including Germany, Sweden, Australia, and South Korea.
The distributor began negotiations with distributors in various European countries and eventually succeeded in selling the film in major markets such as Spanish, French, Italian, English and German-speaking countries prior to its release in Japan.
The distributor was successful in obtaining permission from filmmakers Roger Corman and Irvin Kershner to use their comments in recommending the film free of charge worldwide. As a result, their comments were used on international theater flyers and in worldwide promotions.

Later, there was a rumor that director Darren Aronofsky had purchased the remake rights for &quot;Perfect Blue&quot;. However, when he spoke with Kon in a magazine in 2001, he stated that he had to abandon the purchase of the rights due to various reasons.
He also said that it was a homage to the movie that his movie &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; had the same angles and shots as &quot;Perfect Blue&quot;.

== Analysis ==

In an analysis of &quot;Perfect Blue&quot; and Kon&#x27;s other works, professor Susan Napier states that &quot;&quot;Perfect Blue&quot; announces its preoccupation with perception, identity, voyeurism, and performance – especially in relation to the female – right from its opening sequence. The perception of reality cannot be trusted, with the visual set up only to not be reality, especially as the psychodrama heights towards the climax.&quot; Napier also sees themes related to pop idols and their performances as impacting the gaze and the issue of their roles. Mima&#x27;s madness results from her own subjectivity and attacks on her identity. The ties to Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s work are broken with the murder of her male controllers. &quot;Otaku&quot; describes the film as a &quot;critique of the consumer society of contemporary Japan.&quot;

== Reception and legacy ==

The film was well received critically in the festival circuit, winning awards at the 1997 Fantasia Festival in Montréal, and Fantasporto Film Festival in Portugal.

Critical response in the United States upon its theatrical release was also positive. , the film had an 84% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 55 reviews, with an average score of 7.4/10. The consensus stated, &quot;&quot;Perfect Blue&quot; is overstylized, but its core mystery is always compelling, as are the visual theatrics.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 67 based on 17 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; included the film on its Top 5 Anime film list, &quot;Total Film&quot; ranked &quot;Perfect Blue&quot; twenty-fifth on their list of greatest animated films, and /Film named it the scariest animated film ever. It also made the list for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s best movies never seen from 1991 to 2011. In 2022, &quot;IndieWire&quot; named &quot;Perfect Blue&quot; the twelfth best movie of the 1990s.

Dennis Harvey of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that while the film &quot;ultimately disappoints with its just-middling tension and underdeveloped scenario, it still holds attention by trying something different for the genre&quot;. Hoai-Tran Bui of &quot;/Film&quot; called &quot;Perfect Blue&quot; &quot;deeply violent, both physically and emotionally&quot;, writing that &quot;this is a film that will leave you with profound psychological scars, and the feeling that you want to take a long, long shower&quot;. Bob Graham of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; noted the film&#x27;s ability to &quot;take the thriller, media fascination, psychological insight and pop culture and stand them all on their heads&quot; via its &quot;knowing, adult view of what seems to be a young-teenage paradise.&quot; Writing for Anime News Network, reviewer Tim Henderson described the film as &quot;a dark, sophisticated psychological thriller&quot; with its effect of &quot;over-obsession funneled through early Internet culture&quot; and produces a &quot;reminder of how much celebrity fandom has evolved in only a decade&quot;. Reviewing the 2019 GKIDS Blu-ray release, Neil Lumbard of Blu-ray.com heralded &quot;Perfect Blue&quot; as &quot;one of the greatest anime films of all time&quot; and &quot;a must-see masterpiece that helped to pave the way for more complex anime films to follow,&quot; while Chris Beveridge of &quot;The Fandom Post&quot; noted &quot;this is not a film one can watch often overall, nor should you, but when you settle into it you put everything else away, turn down the lights, and savor an excellent piece of filmmaking.&quot;

American performer Madonna incorporated clips from &quot;Perfect Blue&quot; into a remix of her song &quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot; as a video interlude during her Drowned World Tour in 2001.

American filmmaker Darren Aronofsky acknowledged the similarities in his 2010 film &quot;Black Swan&quot;, but denied that &quot;Black Swan&quot; was inspired by &quot;Perfect Blue&quot;; his previous film &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; features a remake of the bathtub scene from &quot;Perfect Blue&quot;. A re-issued blog entry mentioned Aronofsky&#x27;s film &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; as being among Kon&#x27;s list of films he viewed for 2010. In addition, Kon blogged about his meeting with Aronofsky in 2001.

== Other media ==

Seven Seas Entertainment obtained the English-language publication rights for the 1991 novel &quot;Perfect Blue: Complete Metamorphosis&quot; in April 2017. They released them in February and April 2018, respectively.

<doc id="298572" wikidata="Q963003" url="?curid=298572" title="Thurston Dart">
<text>Robert Thurston (&quot;Bob&quot;) Dart (3 September 1921 – 6 March 1971) was an English musicologist, conductor and keyboard player. Along with Nigel Fortune, Oliver Neighbour and Stanley Sadie, he was one of Britain&#x27;s leading musicologists of the post-World War II generation. From 1964 until his death he was King Edward Professor of Music at the University of London, based at King&#x27;s College London.

== Early life ==
Dart was born on 3 September 1921 in Surbiton, then part of Surrey. His father, Henry Thurston Dart, a merchant&#x27;s clerk, married his mother, Elizabeth Martha Orf in 1915. He attended Hampton Grammar School and sang in the choir at Hampton Court. There he encountered Edmund Fellowes, who gave him encouragement.

A student at the Royal College of Music in London 1938–9, Dart went on to study mathematics at University College, Exeter, being awarded an external BA degree from the University of London in 1942, and in the same year qualified with ARCM status. He then served as a Junior Scientific Officer statistician and researcher in the RAF, working on operational research, until 1945. He was in the strategic bombing Planning Unit under Air Vice Marshal Basil Embry.

Dart was injured in a plane crash in Calais in November 1944, and while convalescing from his injuries at a nursing home in Swanley, he first met Neville Marriner. After leaving the RAF, he studied for a year 1945–6 on a grant with the Belgian musicologist . A further early teacher and influence was Arnold Goldsbrough, a founder of the ensemble that later became the English Chamber Orchestra.

== Academic career ==
Dart returned to England in 1946 as research assistant to Henry Moule, a music lecturer at the University of Cambridge. In 1947 he was appointed assistant lecturer in music in the university, subsequently having posts as lecturer (1952) and professor (1962), and was a Fellow of Jesus College.

During this time, Dart was an effective British supporter of early music revival, in part through his influence on those who went on to form such groups as the Early Music Consort of London: he lent its founder David Munrow, then reading English at Pembroke College, a crumhorn. He taught conductor/musicologist Christopher Hogwood of the Academy of Ancient Music. He taught the conductor John Eliot Gardiner, after Gardiner had left Cambridge, who was also studying with George Hurst.

Philip Brett has been described as &quot;Dart&#x27;s star pupil&quot;. He worked as an undergraduate on the music manuscripts in the collection of Edward Paston, providing provenances and attributions of some pieces to William Byrd. Dart involved him in part of his extensive editorial work of revision of books by Edmund Fellowes. 

In 1964 Dart was appointed King Edward Professor of Music at the University of London, based at King&#x27;s College London. According to Denis Arnold, his reason for leaving Cambridge was the conservatism in its approach to music education. Among his students there was Peter Holman. Michael Nyman, another of his students at King&#x27;s, wrote in 1972 that Dart &quot;finally realised his vision of a musical education freed from the pointless strangulation of a system still obsessed with harmony and counterpoint.&quot;

==Musician==
As a versatile historical performer, Dart was a successor in the United Kingdom to Arnold Dolmetsch. A continuo player, he made numerous appearances on the harpsichord; he was also a conductor. He performed with the Boyd Neel Orchestra, and when in 1955 Neel moved to Canada, he became its artistic director. The ensemble, renamed Philomusica of London, performed works from Dart&#x27;s own editions. He resigned his post with it in 1959.

During the 1950s Dart participated in annual concerts featuring four harpsichordists, the three others being George Malcolm, Denis Vaughan and Eileen Joyce. Ultimately Valda Aveling replaced Joyce. Their instruments at this point were modern. Dart and Malcolm were later among those trying replica period harpsichords.

===Recordings===
* &quot;Music for Three, Four or Five Harpsichords&quot; (EMI, 1956): a recording, of the harpsichord ensemble with the Pro Arte Orchestra under Boris Ord. It included Bach&#x27;s Concerto for Four Harpsichords, an arrangement after Vivaldi; also &quot;Variations on a Theme of Mozart&quot; by George Malcolm.

Among the early historically informed recordings of the Brandenburg Concertos were those Dart made with the Philomusica of London (1958–9), with a single instrument assigned to each part. He later worked with Neville Marriner on a recording of the Brandenburg Concertos and the four Orchestral Suites. For the instrumentation of the fourth concerto, he had argued that the enigmatic instruction &quot;fiauti d&#x27;echo&quot; written by Bach meant a type of flageolet, used to train caged birds to sing. This interpretation was contentious. The Marriner-Dart recording used sopranino recorders. Nicolaus Harnoncourt has used the less unorthodox treble recorder in F4. 

Dart made many harpsichord, clavichord and organ recordings, especially for the L&#x27;Oiseau-Lyre label. Louise Hanson-Dyer, founder of the label, was his patron for early keyboard and orchestral pieces. In all Dart made around 90 recordings.

==Death==
Dart died from stomach cancer in London on 6 March 1971. He was unmarried.

==Works==
Dart&#x27;s book &quot;The Interpretation of Music&quot; (London, 1954), was influential and led to further research into performance. He also wrote numerous articles on aspects of musical sources, performance and interpretation. He was a major contributor to the &quot;Musica Britannica&quot; volumes. He left an unfinished biography of John Bull.

He served as editor of the Galpin Society &quot;Journal&quot; from 1947 to 1954. As secretary of &quot;Musica Britannica&quot; from 1950 to 1965, he saw 34 volumes through the press. He also oversaw the re-editing of the multi-volume series by Edmund Fellowes on William Byrd and the English madrigalists.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Source Materials and the Interpretation of Music: A Memorial Volume to Thurston Dart&quot; was published in 1981, edited by Ian Bent.

In 1996 the Thurston Dart Professorship of Music was established at King&#x27;s College London.

<doc id="298573" wikidata="Q313353" url="?curid=298573" title="Vladislav Ardzinba">
<text>Vladislav Ardzinba (, ; 14 May 1945 – 4 March 2010) was an Abkhaz historian and politician who served as the first &quot;de facto&quot; president of Abkhazia. Ardzinba led Abkhazia to &quot;de facto&quot; independence in the 1992–1993 War with Georgia, but its &quot;de jure&quot; independence from Georgia remained internationally unrecognised during Ardzinba&#x27;s two terms as President from 1994 to 2005. His government orchestrated ethnic cleansing of Georgian civilians in Abkhazia in 1993.

A noted specialist in Hittitology, he was a member of the first parliament to be elected democratically in the Soviet Union in 1989.

==Early life and career==
Vladislav Ardzinba was born in the village of Lower Eshera, Sukhumi District, Abkhaz ASSR, Georgian SSR, Soviet Union. After graduating from the Historical Department of the Sukhumi Pedagogical Institute, Ardzinba studied at the Tbilisi State University where he received a doctoral degree. He then worked for eighteen years in Moscow specialising in ancient Middle Eastern civilizations under Yevgeniy Primakov, then head of the Institute of Oriental Studies in Moscow, and later Russian foreign and Prime Minister. He then returned to Sukhumi and he served there as the director of the Abkhazian Institute of Language, Literature and History from 1987 until 1989, when he was elected a Deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union from Gudauta. From there, he was involved closely with national issues, including Abkhazia, and quickly emerged as one of the most active proponents of the Abkhaz secessionist cause. While a deputy to the USSR Supreme Soviet, Ardzinba forged close ties with the hardliners in Moscow, particularly with the parliamentary chairman Anatoly Lukyanov and other members of the hardline communist groups in Moscow that were responsible for the August 1991 coup attempt.

==Role in the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict==
He was a member of the first parliament to be elected democratically in the Soviet Union in 1989.

On 4 December 1990, Ardzinba was elected Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Abkhazia. Ardzinba, who was a charismatic but excitable figure popular among the Abkhaz, was believed by Georgians to have helped to instigate the violence of July 1989. Ardzinba managed to consolidate his power relatively quickly and reneged on pre-election promises to increase the representation of Georgians in Abkhazia&#x27;s autonomous structures; since then, Ardzinba tried to rule Abkhazia relatively single-handedly, but avoided, for the time being, overt conflict with the central authorities in Tbilisi. In mid-1991, he negotiated and accepted the Georgian concession on the reform of the electoral law that granted the Abkhaz wide over-representation in the Supreme Soviet. However, Ardzinba created the Abkhazian National Guard that was mono-ethnically Abkhaz, and initiated a practice of replacing ethnic Georgians in leading positions with Abkhaz. As the Georgian-Abkhaz tensions rose, Ardzinba&#x27;s rhetoric mounted, as he claimed in late July 1992 that &quot;Abkhazia is strong enough to fight Georgia.&quot;

In August 1992, a Georgian military force ousted Ardzinba and his group from Sukhumi when Abkhazian militants seized government buildings. They took shelter in Gudauta, a home to the Soviet-era Russian military base. Ardzinba benefited from his contacts with the Russian hardliner circles and military leaders to garner critical support in the war against the Georgian government.

==Presidency==
After the hostilities ended in 1994 and the bulk of the Georgian population was forced out of Abkhazia, the Abkhazian parliament elected Ardzinba to the presidency, a move that was condemned by Georgia and the United Nations as illegal. He won the first direct polls on 3 October 1999, without an opponent and was re-elected as president of Abkhazia. He installed an autocratic regime and remained politically untouchable until his health seriously deteriorated in 2003. He once stated that independence from Georgia is not negotiable, and he has tried to align the state with Russia, whose political and economic support was essential to the republic. As a leader of the Abkhaz side he met the two successive Russian presidents, Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin, as well as a President of Georgia, Eduard Shevardnadze.

Under his rule, human rights records were extremely poor as most of the pre-war Georgian population of Abkhazia were deprived the right to return, and those who remained were subjected to systematic ethnic cleansing. Ardzinba aroused some further criticism from the international community after issuing a decree banning Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in 1995.

During the last years of his presidency Ardzinba faced criticism for both failing to bring stability to Abkhazia and his increasingly low public profile. He had not appeared in public since 2002. As a result, the role of governing the state had been increasingly left to Prime Minister Raul Khajimba.

He had been in extremely poor health and underwent treatment in Moscow for some time. Despite increasing calls from the opposition (particularly the Amtsakhara movement) for him to resign he had stated that he would finish his term, which was supposed to end in October 2004, but in fact did not end until 12 February 2005, due to disputes over the election of his successor. There were also calls for him to be impeached. However, although the Abkhaz Constitution allows for impeachment, the process would likely have not been completed before the end of his term, so no serious steps were taken to bring it about. He was unable to run for a third term due to constitutional restrictions, and it is unlikely that his health would have enabled him to do so even if this was allowed.

He was replaced by Sergei Bagapsh, the winner of the presidential election of 12 January 2005 held one month after the contested 2004 election.

==Death==
By 2010, Ardzinba&#x27;s health was in decline and had been for some time. Ardzinba died on 4 March 2010, at the age of 64. He was in the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow at the time. He had been escorted there the previous week. The cause of death was not released to the public. He is survived by his wife and daughter. The President of Abkhazia, Sergei Bagapsh, paid tribute: &quot;His service to the Abkhaz people was boundless&quot;. Three days of mourning were declared in Abkhazia in remembrance of Ardzinba.

<text>John Selden Roane (January 8, 1817April 7, 1867) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the fourth Governor of Arkansas from 1849 to 1852. Prior to this he commanded the Arkansas Mounted Infantry Regiment following the death of Colonel Archibald Yell at the Battle of Buena Vista. Roane also served as a senior officer of the Confederate States Army who commanded infantry in the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War.

==Early life and career==
John Selden Roane was born in Wilson County, Tennessee, and educated at Cumberland College, which at the time was located in Princeton, Kentucky. He migrated to the new state of Arkansas in 1837, studied law, and was admitted to the bar. He was Prosecuting Attorney for the 2nd Judicial District of Arkansas from 1840 to 1842, a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1842 to 1844, and the fourth Governor of Arkansas from 1849 to 1852.

==Mexican War==
At the outbreak of the Mexican War, Roane was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel of the Arkansas Mounted Infantry Regiment, succeeding to command when Colonel Archibald Yell was mortally wounded repelling the charge of the Mexican lancers at the Battle of Buena Vista. Roane was officially appointed Colonel on February 28, 1847. He was known to be jealous of the honor of his state and once challenged Albert Pike to a duel over what he perceived as derogatory statements made about the regiment&#x27;s actions in the war. The duel was fought, but neither combatant was injured.

==American Civil War==
On March 20, 1862, Roane was appointed to the grade of brigadier-general in the Confederate States Army. After most Confederate troops were moved from Arkansas across the Mississippi River, he was placed in charge of the defense of Arkansas. At this time Arkansas was nearly defenseless; and Roane, with the newly appointed commander of the Trans-Mississippi District (also known as Department Number Two), Major-General Thomas Hindman, cobbled together a reasonable defensive force. Roane took part in numerous battles within the Trans-Mississippi Theater, including the battles of Whitney&#x27;s Lane and Prairie Grove.

==Personal life==
On February 1, 1855, Roane married Mary Kim Smith (1833–1907) of Dallas, Arkansas.

==Later life==
Roane died in Jefferson County, Arkansas, and is buried at Oakland Cemetery, Little Rock.

<text>Titus Oates (15 September 1649 – 12/13 July 1705) was an English priest who fabricated the &quot;Popish Plot&quot;, a supposed Catholic conspiracy to kill King Charles II.

==Early life==
Titus Oates was born at Oakham in Rutland. His father Samuel (1610–1683), of a family of Norwich ribbon-weavers, was a graduate of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and became a minister who moved between the Church of England (sometime rector of Marsham, Norfolk) and the Baptists; he became a Baptist during the English Civil War, rejoining the established church at the Restoration, and was rector of All Saints&#x27; Church at Hastings (1666–74).

Oates was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School and other schools. At Cambridge University, he entered Gonville and Caius College in 1667 but transferred to St John&#x27;s College in 1669; he left later the same year without a degree. A less than astute student, he was regarded by his tutor as &quot;a great dunce&quot;, although he did have a good memory. At Cambridge, he also gained a reputation for homosexuality and a &quot;Canting Fanatical way&quot;.

By falsely claiming to have a degree, he gained a licence to preach from the Bishop of London. On 29 May 1670 he was ordained as a priest of the Church of England. He was vicar of the parish of Bobbing in Kent, 1673–74, and then curate to his father at All Saints&#x27;, Hastings. During this time Oates accused a schoolmaster in Hastings of sodomy with one of his pupils, hoping to get the schoolmaster&#x27;s post. However, the charge was shown to be false and Oates himself was soon facing charges of perjury, but he escaped jail and fled to London. In 1675 he was appointed as a chaplain of the ship in the Royal Navy. Oates visited English Tangier with his ship, but was accused of buggery, which was a capital offence, and spared only because of his clerical status. He was dismissed from the Navy in 1676.

In August 1676, Oates was arrested in London and returned to Hastings to face trial for his outstanding perjury charges, but he escaped a second time and returned to London. With the help of the actor Matthew Medbourne he joined the household of the Catholic Henry Howard, 7th Duke of Norfolk as an Anglican chaplain to those members of Howard&#x27;s household who were Protestants. Although Oates was admired for his preaching, he soon lost this position.

On Ash Wednesday in 1677 Oates was received into the Catholic Church. Oddly, at the same time he agreed to co-author a series of anti-Catholic pamphlets with Israel Tonge, whom he had met through his father Samuel, who had once more reverted to the Baptist doctrine.

He is described by John Dryden in &quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot; (published 1681) thus—
==Contact with the Jesuits==
Oates was involved with the Jesuit houses of St Omer in France and the Royal English College at Valladolid in Spain. He was admitted to the training course for the priesthood in Valladolid through the support of Richard Strange, head of the English Province, despite a lack of basic competence in Latin and later claimed, falsely, that he had become a Catholic Doctor of Divinity. His ignorance of Latin was quickly exposed, and his frequently blasphemous conversation, and his attacks on the British monarchy, shocked both his teachers and the other students. Thomas Whitbread, the new Provincial, took a much firmer line with Oates than had Strange and, in June 1678, expelled him from St Omer.

When he returned to London, he rekindled his friendship with Israel Tonge. Oates claimed that he had pretended to become a Catholic to learn about the secrets of the Jesuits and that, before leaving, he had heard about a planned Jesuit meeting in London.

==Fabricating the Popish Plot==

Oates and Tonge wrote a lengthy manuscript that accused the Catholic Church authorities in England of approving the assassination of Charles II. The Jesuits were supposed to carry out the task. In August 1678, King Charles was warned of this alleged plot against his life by the chemist Christopher Kirkby, and later by Tonge. Charles was unimpressed, but handed the matter over to one of his ministers, Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby; Danby was more willing to listen and was introduced to Oates by Tonge.
The King&#x27;s Privy Council questioned Oates. On 28 September, Oates made 43 allegations against various members of Catholic religious orders—including 541 Jesuits—and numerous Catholic nobles. He accused Sir George Wakeman, Queen Catherine of Braganza&#x27;s doctor, and Edward Colman, the secretary to Mary of Modena, Duchess of York, of planning to assassinate Charles.

Although Oates may have selected the names randomly, or with the help of the Earl of Danby, Colman was found to have corresponded with a French Jesuit, Father Ferrier, who was confessor to Louis XIV, which was enough to condemn him. Wakeman was later acquitted. Despite Oates&#x27;s unsavoury reputation, his confident performance and superb memory made a surprisingly good impression on the council. When he named &quot;at a glance&quot; the alleged authors of five letters supposedly written by leading Jesuits, the council were &quot;amazed&quot;. As Kenyon remarks, it is surprising that it did not occur to the Council that this was useless as evidence if Oates had written all the letters himself.

Others whom Oates accused included William Fogarty, Archbishop Peter Talbot of Dublin, Samuel Pepys MP, and John Belasyse, 1st Baron Belasyse. With the help of Danby, the list grew to 81 accusations. Oates was given a squad of soldiers and he began to round up Jesuits, including those who had helped him in the past.

On 6 September 1678, Oates and Tonge approached an Anglican magistrate, Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, and swore an affidavit before him detailing their accusations. On 12 October, Godfrey disappeared, and five days later his dead body was found in a ditch at Primrose Hill; he had been strangled and run through with his own sword. Oates subsequently exploited this incident to launch a public campaign against the &quot;Papists&quot; and alleged that the murder of Godfrey had been the work of the Jesuits.

On 24 November 1678, Oates claimed the Queen was working with the King&#x27;s physician to poison the King. Oates enlisted the aid of &quot;Captain&quot; William Bedloe, who was ready to say anything for money. The King personally interrogated Oates and caught him out in a number of inaccuracies and lies. In particular, Oates unwisely claimed to have had an interview with the Regent of Spain, Don John, in Madrid: the King, who had met Don John at Brussels during his Continental exile, pointed out that Oates&#x27;s hopelessly inaccurate description of his appearance made it clear that he had never seen him. The King ordered his arrest. However, a few days later, with the threat of a constitutional crisis, Parliament forced the release of Oates, who soon received a state apartment in Whitehall and an annual allowance of £1,200.

Oates was heaped with praise. He asked the College of Arms to check his lineage and produce a coat of arms for him and subsequently received the arms of a family that had died out. Rumours surfaced that Oates was to be married to a daughter of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury.

After nearly three years and the execution of at least 15 innocent men, opinion began to turn against Oates. The last high-profile victim of the climate of suspicion was Oliver Plunkett, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, who was hanged, drawn and quartered on 1 July 1681. William Scroggs, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, began to declare more people innocent, as he had done in the Wakeman trial, and a backlash against Oates and his Whig supporters took place.

==Aftermath==

On 31 August 1681, Oates was told to leave his apartments in Whitehall, but he remained undeterred and even denounced the King and his Catholic brother, the Duke of York. He was arrested for sedition, sentenced to a fine of £100,000 and imprisoned.

When the Duke of York acceded to the throne in 1685 as James II, he had Oates retried, convicted and sentenced for perjury, stripped of clerical dress, imprisoned for life, and to be &quot;whipped through the streets of London five days a year for the remainder of his life&quot;. Oates was taken from his cell wearing a hat with the text &quot;Titus Oates, convicted upon full evidence of two horrid perjuries&quot; and put into the pillory at the gate of Westminster Hall (now New Palace Yard), where passers-by pelted him with eggs. The next day he was pilloried in London and the third day was stripped, tied to a cart, and whipped from Aldgate to Newgate. On the next day, he was whipped from Newgate to Tyburn.

The presiding judge at his trial was Judge Jeffreys, who stated that Oates was a &quot;shame to mankind&quot;, despite the fact he himself had helped to condemn innocent people on Oates&#x27;s perjured evidence. Jeffreys recognised that evidence admitted in the second perjury trial had not been believed in a previous trial when sworn in contradiction to Oates&#x27;s own evidence, and regretted that evidence now freshly presented had not been available, particularly at the trials of Ireland and of the five Jesuits (at the latter of which he presided) as, &quot;it might have saved some innocent blood&quot;. So severe were the penalties imposed on Oates that it has been suggested by among others Thomas Babington Macaulay that the aim was to kill him by ill-treatment, as Jeffreys and his fellow judges openly regretted that they could not impose the death penalty in a case of perjury.

Oates spent the next three years in prison. In 1689, upon the accession of the Protestant William of Orange and Mary, he was pardoned and granted a pension of £260 a year, but his reputation did not recover. The pension was later suspended, but in 1698 was restored and increased to £300 a year. Oates died on 12 or 13 July 1705, by then an obscure and largely forgotten figure.

==In popular culture==

Francis Barlow made a comic strip about the Popish Plot and Oates in c. 1682 named &quot;A True Narrative of the Horrid Hellish Popish Plot&quot;, which is generally considered the earliest example of a signed balloon comic strip.

Oates was played by Nicholas Smith in the 1969 BBC TV serial &quot;The First Churchills&quot;. In &quot;Charles II: The Power and The Passion&quot; (2003), Eddie Marsan played Oates.

<text>In agriculture and horticulture, a beetle bank is a form of biological pest control. It is a strip, preferably raised, planted with grasses (bunch grasses) and/or perennial plants, within a crop field or a garden, that fosters and provides habitat for beneficial insects, birds, and other fauna that prey on pests.

== Usage ==
Beetle banks are typically made up from plants such as sunflowers, &quot;Vicia faba&quot;, &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot;, coriander, borage, &quot;Muhlenbergia&quot;, &quot;Stipa&quot;, and buckwheats (&quot;Eriogonum spp.&quot;). Beetle banks are used to reduce or replace the use of insecticides, and can also serve as habitat for birds and beneficial rodents. For example, insects such as &quot;Chrysoperla carnea&quot; and the Ichneumon fly can prey on pests. The concept was developed by the Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust in collaboration with the University of Southampton.

Other important benefits can be providing habitat for pollinators and endangered species. If using local native plants, endemic and indigenous flora and fauna restoration ecology is supported.

== History of the term ==
According to a March 2005 draft entry for the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the term first came into use in the early 1990s, with published examples including the August 22, 1992 issue of the &quot;New Scientist&quot; and an October 12, 1994 reference in &quot;The Guardian&quot; society section:
:‘Beetle banks’, a recent initiative by the Game Conservancy Trust, would also help encourage ground-nesting birds while creating cover for aphid-eating bugs with more pay-off in savings on aphicides.

<text>Georges-Augustin Bidault (; 5 October 189927 January 1983) was a French politician. During World War II, he was active in the French Resistance. After the war, he served as foreign minister and premier on several occasions. He apparently joined the Organisation armée secrète; however he always denied his involvement.

==Early life==
Bidault was born in Moulins, Allier. He studied in the Sorbonne and became a college history teacher. In 1932 he helped to found the Catholic Association of French Youth and the left-wing anti-fascist newspaper &quot;l&#x27;Aube&quot;. He had a column in the paper and, among other things, protested against the Munich Agreement in 1938.

==World War II==

After the beginning of the Second World War he joined the French army. He was captured during the Fall of France and was imprisoned briefly. After his release in July 1941, he became a teacher at the Lycée du Parc in Lyon and joined the &quot;Liberté&quot; group of French Resistance that eventually merged with the group &quot;Combat&quot;. Jean Moulin recruited him to organize a covert press and the &quot;Combat&quot; covert newspaper.

For his work in the resistance, he was helped by his private administrative assistant Laure Diebold.

Bidault, inter alia along with other people well known, was imprisoned by the Spanish in an Internment camp at Miranda de Ebro.

Bidault participated in the forming of the Conseil National de la Résistance and, after the Gestapo captured Moulin, he became its new president. In 1944 he formed a Resistance Charter that recommended an extensive post-war reform program. After the liberation of Paris he represented the Resistance in the victory parade. Charles de Gaulle appointed him as a foreign minister of his provisional government on 25 August. He was the initiator of the society Popular Republican Movement (MRP).

He was chief of the French delegation to the San Francisco Conference, which established the UN, from April to June 1945. At the conference, France succeeded in gaining a permanent seat on the Security Council.

==Fourth Republic==
On 4 January 1946, Bidault married Suzanne Borel, the first French woman to be employed as a diplomat. The same year he served as foreign minister in Félix Gouin&#x27;s provisional government. On 19 June 1946, the National Constituent Assembly elected him as president of the provisional government. His government, formed on 15 June, was composed of socialists, communists and Bidault&#x27;s own MRP. In social policy, Bidault&#x27;s government was notable for passing important pension and workman&#x27;s compensation laws. An act of 22 August 1946 extended coverage of family allowances to practically the entire population, while a law of October 1946 provided that insurance of occupation risks &quot;would henceforth be mandatory and that such insurance would be granted by the Social Security that had been created in 1945.&quot; In August 1946, an Act was passed that made provision for two days&#x27; holiday a month up to a maximum of 24 working days for young persons between the ages of 14 and 18 and for one-and-a-half days&#x27; a month up to a maximum of 18 working days for those aged between 18 and 21. In addition, an Act was passed on 11 October 1946 that introduced occupational medical services.

Bidault later became foreign minister once again. The government held elections for the National Assembly on 29 November after which Bidault resigned. His successor was Léon Blum.

Bidault served various French governments, first as foreign minister for Paul Ramadier and Robert Schuman. In April 1947 he endorsed Ramadier&#x27;s decision to expel the Communists from his government. Bidault had recently been to Moscow and was disturbed by the Soviet regime; he believed an agreement with Stalin was impossible. In 1948, weapons valued at 153 million francs were donated to Israel by the French government, in accordance with a secret agreement approved by Bidault. Bidault&#x27;s reasons for this are unclear, albeit he had been very concerned about the possibility of a Jordanian takeover of Jerusalem. Deputy Chief of Staff General Henri Coudraux, who was involved in the operation, told a 1949 inquiry that France had &quot;reached a secret agreement with the Irgun, which promised it advantages if it were to come into power [in Israel].&quot; A significant portion of the weapons and the ammunition were later destroyed in the Altalena Affair. 

In 1949 he became the President of the Council of Ministers (premier) but his government lasted only 8 months. During his last term as premier, a law of February 1950 that regulated collective bargaining, and included a guarantee of the right of workers to strike. The same law required the government to fix minimum wages for agriculture and for industry. In Henri Queuille&#x27;s governments in 1950–1951 he had the office of deputy prime minister and for René Pleven and Edgar Faure also the post of defense minister.

In 1952 Bidault became honorary president of MRP. On 1 June 1953 President Vincent Auriol assigned him to form his own government but the National Assembly refused to give him the official mandate on 10 June. In 1953 Bidault became a presidential candidate but withdrew after the second round.

Bidault was foreign minister during the siege of the French garrison at Dien Bien Phu from March to May 1954. He protested to the Red Cross that the Viet Minh were shooting at clearly marked French medical evacuation flights, killing some of the evacuees. The ongoing fighting in Indochina had exhausted him; he was described by American secretary of state John Foster Dulles as &quot;a deeply harassed man&quot; and later by a historian as &quot;on the verge of a nervous breakdown&quot;. Caught between his desires to end the war and to maintain French rule over its colonies, he vacillated between pressing the war, perhaps by asking the Americans for air support, or seeking a negotiated solution. Bidault stated that John Foster Dulles (then Secretary of State of United States) offered France two atomic bombs in 1954.

==Fifth Republic==
In April 1958 Bidault again became premier but did not form a cabinet and helped form the conservative society Christian Democratic Movement. He also endorsed De Gaulle&#x27;s presidency after the beginning of the Algerian War of Independence.

In 1961 Bidault became President of the Executive Council of the society Rally for French Algeria and opposed De Gaulle&#x27;s policy of Algerian independence. He established his own National Resistance Council within the far-right paramilitary organization OAS (Organisation armée secrète). In June 1962 he was accused of conspiring against the state and deprived of his parliamentary immunity. He left for exile in Brazil. In 1967 he relocated to Belgium and in 1968 returned to France after benefiting from an amnesty.

In his political memoirs, Bidault stated that he was never involved with the OAS, and was not qualified to give any precise information about its deeds.

When the Front national was founded in October 1972 by members of Ordre nouveau, he participated but resigned from the organisation a few days later.

Bidault died of a stroke in Cambo-les-Bains in January 1983.

<text>Charles Delestraint (12 March 1879 – 19 April 1945) was a French Army lieutenant general and member of the French Resistance during World War II. He also befriended Charles de Gaulle. Delestraint was killed by the Gestapo in 1945.

==Early life==
He was born in Biache Saint-Waast, Pas-de-Calais.

==Military career==

===World War I===
Delestraint was captured early during World War I and spent the remainder of it as a prisoner of war.

===Interwar Period===
After the war he remained in the army where he was a proponent for the use of armoured forces.

===World War II===
Delestraint retired in 1939 but was recalled to service after the outbreak of World War II. During the Battle of France, on 3 June 1940, he led the armoured counterattack against Germans in Abbeville.

===In the Resistance===
After the surrender of France on 25 June, he retired to Bourg-en-Bresse where Henri Frenay recruited him into the French Resistance. Delestraint began to organize resistance in Lyon. He clandestinely visited Charles de Gaulle in London and agreed to lead the Armée Secrète. He returned to France on 24 March 1943. However, he was arrested by the Gestapo on 9 June and interrogated by Klaus Barbie. He was taken as special prisoner (Nacht und Nebel) to Natzweiler-Struthof and then to the Dachau concentration camp, where he was executed on 19 April, only a few days before the camp was liberated and the war ended.

<doc id="298589" wikidata="Q463367" url="?curid=298589" title="Henri Frenay">
<text>Henri Frenay Sandoval (11 November 1905 – 8 August 1988) was a French military officer and French Resistance member, who served as minister of prisoners, refugees and deportees in Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s Provisional Government of the French Republic.

== Early life and education ==
Henry Frenay was born in Lyon, France, on 11 November 1905, into a Catholic family with a military tradition, and staunch right-wing and anti-communist beliefs. Frenay would later say of his youth, &quot;without knowing, I belonged to a French right-wing, traditionalist, poor, patriotic and
paternalistic tradition.” His father was a soldier, who was awarded the Legion of Honour in 1912 and served in the First World War, by the end of which he had reached the rank of lieutenant colonel. 

He was educated at the Lycée Ampère in Lyon and later studied Germanic languages at the university of Strasbourg in 1938, writing a dissertation on the German minority in Polish Upper Silesia. 

== Military career ==
In 1924, at the age of 19, and having attended a preparatory class at the Lycée du Parc, Frenay enrolled at Saint Cyr, graduating in 1926. In 1933, having served abroad in the army for multiple years in Germany and Syria, he returned to France, specifically to Hyères in south-east France, where he was assigned to the 3rd Alpine Infantry Brigade. He reached the rank of captain in 1934 and studied at the École Supérieure de Guerre in 1935.

At the outbreak of World War II, Frenay rejoined the French army and was assigned to the Maginot Line as a staff officer. On 13 June 1940, the 43rd Army Corps, to which he was deployed at the time, was ordered to retreat, and Frenay was taken prisoner by the German army four days later in Vosges. He managed to escape from a POW camp in Alsace on 27 June 1940, and reached the Zone libre on 15 July, heading to Marseille, where he quickly became aware of the severity of France&#x27;s situation.

== Resistance ==
Having been warned of the Nazi ideological plans very early on through meetings organised by Berty Albrecht, and convinced that France would recover from its defeat, Frenay set out in August 1940 to gather the beginnings of a network around himself and Albrecht. This network, the Mouvement de Libération Nationale (MLN), was the first historical movement of internal resistance in France. Originally, the resistance&#x27;s goal was not to fight the Vichy Regime. Frenay, a military man, saw Pétain as a former Marshal who had led France during the Great War and was consequently willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, hoping that he was playing a double game, preparing for the salvation of France in one way or another. 

As a Resistance member, Frenay also became an editor of underground newspapers such as &quot;Vérités&quot; (Truths).

In July 1941, Frenay met with former Prefect Jean Moulin, who had been dismissed by the Vichy Regime in November 1940 due to his Radical, republican ideals and sought to find out the size of the internal resistance movements in France on the orders of General de Gaulle. Frenay, trusting de Gaulle, trained Moulin and introduced him to the Resistance. In November 1941, Frenay had a hand in the formation of the Combat group.

In January 1942, Frenay met with Moulin again following the latter&#x27;s return from London, where he had been charged with unifying the French Resistance and rallying it to de Gaulle. He continued to met with Moulin frequently until 1943, though the two often disagreed on many matters, with Frenay believing that Moulin favoured pro-Soviet movements over his own, though in reality Moulin had been tasked by de Gaulle to separate the political conflict from the military resistance, with the belief that Free France, the French government in exile in London and later in Algiers, should carry out the political function under his leadership. Frenay, on the other hand, believed that the Resistance should be its own, autonomous political movement that created new post-war institutions and did not simply welcome back the old parties and associated networks, citing the failure of the party system under the Third Republic.

In February 1942, to obtain the release of militants from the &quot;Zone Libre&quot;, Frenay twice met with Henri Rollin, head of the Direction de la surveillance du territoire, then the Minister of the Interior of Vichy France, Pierre Pucheu, who suggested that Frenay should connect his movements to the French secret services, a suggestion which Frenay rejected. During a third meeting with Rollin and members of Pucheu&#x27;s cabinet, Frenay stormed down. Nevertheless, these meetings led to the release of several Resistance fighters.

In the &quot;Zone Libre&quot;, Frenay sought to take military control of the French Resistance, when the three largest movements in the Zone (Francs-Tireurs et Partisans, Libération-sud and Combat) merged, which led to discussions with de Gaulle and Moulin, subsequently leading to the forming of the Conseil National de la Résistance, which, despite his leading involvement, Frenay distrusted and generally kept his own group, Combat, as separate from as possible.

When the Gestapo captured Moulin in June 1943, Frenay fled to Algiers. In November 1943, he met Charles de Gaulle, who appointed him as a minister of prisoners, refugees and deportees. Frenay, due to his major role in the internal Resistance, had desired a more important role in the Ministry of the Interior, but the differences of opinion between him and de Gaulle led to Frenay obtaining this lower ranking position. 

== Post war ==
After the war, Frenay retained his role as minister of prisoner, refugees and deportees until 21 October 1945, during which time he helped organise the return of 1,330,000 prisoners, refugees and deportees from the Allied Zone to France and their reintegration back into national life. 

Frenay was a passionate supporter of the post-war moves to European unity. He took part in the Hague Congress in 1948, which created the European Movement. From 1950 to 1954, Frenay was President of the Union of European Federalists. He resigned his presidency after the rejection by France of the European Defense Community (EDC). It was at this time that he definitively broke with General de Gaulle over the latter&#x27;s opposition to European integration. Frenay retired from political life and became a businessman. He published his autobiography, &quot;The Night Will End: Memoirs of a Revolutionary&quot; in 1976, which notably criticised Moulin and de Gaulle as reckless.

== Personal life ==
In 1934, Frenay met and fell in love with Berty Albrecht, a Protestant feminist and anti-fascist, twelve years his senior and married, albeit separated from her husband. Through her, he met German, anti-Nazi refugees and came to be interested in Nazism, consequently discovering the threat it posed through reading Mein Kampf. Their relationship continued until 1942, during which time they worked together on the underground newspapers. Albrecht was eventually captured by SS Officer Klaus Barbie in 1943, in a trap likely intended to draw out Frenay, and became a martyr of the resistance, committing suicide to avoid revealing information under torture.

In 1942, Frenay met Chilina Ciosi (1909–1997), head doctor of a clinic in Font-Romeu and head of a Resistance transit route to Spain. She gave birth to a child on 6 October 1943. To avoid endangering the mother and child, their son was declared &quot;of unknown father and mother&quot; and placed in a nursery until the end of the conflict. Frenay and Ciosi married after the war, on 25 November 1946.

Frenay died at Porto-Vecchio, Corsica, on 8 August 1988. Then President, and former resistant, François Mitterrand issued a eulogy following Frenay&#x27;s death, and across France streets have been named after him, including a square in Paris in the 12th arrondissement.

<text>Blackburn Rovers Football Club is a professional football club based in Blackburn, Lancashire, England, which competes in the , the second level of the English football league system. They have played home matches at Ewood Park since 1890. The club&#x27;s motto is &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;By Skill and Hard Work&quot; in Latin. They have a long-standing rivalry with nearby club Burnley, with whom they contest the East Lancashire derby.

Blackburn Rovers was founded in 1875, becoming a founding member of The Football League in 1888. They won five FA Cup finals in the 19th century: 1884, 1885, 1886, 1890 and 1891. The team was crowned English League champions in 1911–12 and 1913–14, then won a sixth FA Cup in 1928. They were relegated for the first time in 1936, but returned to the top-flight as Second Division champions in 1938–39. Relegated in 1948, Rovers secured promotion again in 1957–58, but were relegated in 1966 and again in 1971. Blackburn won the Third Division title in 1974–75, and were again promoted in 1979–80 after suffering relegation the previous year. They won the Full Members&#x27; Cup in 1987.

In 1992, Rovers gained promotion to the new Premier League via the play-offs, a year after being taken over by local entrepreneur Jack Walker, who installed Kenny Dalglish as manager. In 1994–95, Rovers became Premier League champions. Relegated four seasons after being crowned champions, they secured promotion at the end of the 2000–01 season, and won the 2002 Football League Cup Final the following year. They spent eleven successive seasons in the Premier League, but were relegated in 2012 and again into the third tier in 2017. Blackburn secured promotion out of League One at the end of the 2017–18 season.

==History==

===Early years===


The club was founded following a meeting, at the Leger Hotel, Blackburn, on 5 November 1875. The meeting was organised by two young men, namely John Lewis and Arthur Constantine, two old-boys of Shrewsbury School. The purpose of the meeting was &quot;to discuss the possibility of forming a football club to play under Association rules&quot;. The first match played by Blackburn Rovers took place in Church, Lancashire on 18 December 1875 and was a 1–1 draw.

On 28 September 1878, Blackburn Rovers became one of 23 clubs to form the Lancashire Football Association. On 1 November 1879 the club played in the FA Cup for the first time, beating the Tyne Association Football Club 5–1. Rovers were eventually put out of the competition in the third round after suffering a heavy 6–0 defeat by Nottingham Forest.

On 25 March 1882 the club won through to the final of the FA Cup against the Old Etonians. Blackburn Rovers was the first provincial team to reach the final, but the result was a 1–0 defeat by the Old Etonians.

Rovers finally won the FA Cup on 29 March 1884 with a 2–1 victory over the Scottish team Queen&#x27;s Park. The same teams played the FA Cup final again the next season, with Blackburn Rovers again emerging victorious, with a 2–0 score. Rovers repeated this success yet again the next season, winning the final replay 2–0 against West Bromwich Albion. For this three-in-a-row of FA Cup victories, the club was awarded a specially commissioned silver shield.

The 1885–86 season was the birth of the legal professional footballer, and Blackburn Rovers spent £615 on player wages for the season.

===Football League commences===
Blackburn Rovers were founder members of the Football League in 1888.

Blackburn Rovers again reached the FA Cup final on 29 March 1890 at the Kennington Oval. The club claimed the trophy for the fourth time, by beating Sheffield Wednesday a hefty 6–1 with left forward William Townley scoring three goals and becoming the first player to achieve a hat-trick in the FA Cup final.

The 1890–91 season saw Blackburn Rovers win the FA Cup for the fifth time against Notts County with a 3–1 victory. During the 1897–98 season the club were relegated but were elected back into the first division at the Football League&#x27;s AGM along with Newcastle United. The season marked the beginning of Bob Crompton&#x27;s 45-year association with the club, as a player and later an FA Cup-winning manager.

===Early 20th century===
Blackburn Rovers continued to struggle during the early years of the 20th century, but the results began a gradual improvement. Major renovations were made to Ewood Park: in 1905 the Darwen End was covered at a cost of £1680 and the new Nuttall Stand was opened on New Year&#x27;s Day 1907. During the first three decades of the 20th century, Blackburn Rovers were still considered a top side in the English league. They were First Division champions in 1911–12 and 1913–14, and F.A Cup winners in 1927–28 with a 3–1 victory against Huddersfield Town, but the F.A Cup win was their last major trophy for nearly 70 years.

===Mid 20th century===

Blackburn Rovers maintained a respectable mid-table position in the First Division until they were finally relegated (along with Aston Villa) from the top flight (for the first time since the foundation of the league) in the 1935–36 season.

When the league resumed after the war, Blackburn Rovers were relegated in their second season (1947–48). At this time the tradition of burying a coffin began. The club remained in the second division for the following ten years. After promotion in 1958, they again returned to the mid-table position they had occupied in the earlier part of the century. During this time, they seldom made a serious challenge for a major trophy – although they did reach the 1960 FA Cup Final when managed by Scot Dally Duncan. Rovers lost this game 3–0 to Wolverhampton Wanderers after playing most of the game with only 10 men on the field following an injury to Dave Whelan, who broke a leg.

There were brief hopes of a return to glory in the 1963–64 season, when a remarkable 8–2 away win over West Ham United in east London on Boxing Day took them to the top of the league. Their lead of the league was short-lived, and they finished the season some way down the table, as the title was seized by a Liverpool side who would record a further 12 league titles over the next 26 years, while Blackburn&#x27;s fortunes took a very different route. They were relegated from the First Division in 1966 and began a 26-year exile from the top division.

===1970s and 1980s===
During the 1970s, Blackburn Rovers bounced between the Second and Third Divisions, winning the Third Division title in 1975, but never mounted a challenge for promotion to the First Division despite the efforts of successive managers to put the club back on track, and fell back into the Third Division in 1979. They went up as runners-up in the Third Division in 1980 and, save for one season in League One in 2017–18, have remained in the upper two tiers of the English league ever since. A second successive promotion was nearly achieved the following year, but the club missed out on goal difference, and promotion-winning manager Howard Kendall moved to Everton that summer. Kendall&#x27;s successor, Bobby Saxton only managed mid-table finishes for the next three seasons, then nearly achieved promotion in the 1984–85 season, but a poor finish the following year (just one place above relegation) followed by an abysmal start to the 1986–87 season cost Saxton his job.

Saxton was replaced by Don Mackay, who steered them to a decent finish that season and also victory in the Full Members Cup. In the following three seasons Mackay re-established Rovers as promotion contenders, but they fell just short of promotion each time; the closest they came was in 1988–89 reached the Second Division play-off final in its last season of the home-away two-legged format – but lost to Crystal Palace. A defeat in the 1989–90 Second Division playoff semi-finals brought more frustration to Ewood Park, but the following season saw the club taken over by local steelworks owner and lifelong supporter Jack Walker (1929–2000).

===1990s===
Following the Walker takeover Rovers finished 19th in the Second Division at the end of the 1990–91 season, but the new owner had made millions of pounds available to spend on new players and appointed Kenny Dalglish as manager in October 1991. Rovers secured promotion to the new FA Premier League at the end of 1991–92 season as play-off winners, ending 26 years outside the top flight.

Rovers made headlines in the summer of 1992 by paying an English record fee of £3.5million for the 22-year-old Southampton and England centre forward Alan Shearer. After finishing fourth in 1992–93 and runners-up in 1993–94, they went on to win the Premier League title in 1994–95. The title chase went down to the last game of the season, but despite Rovers losing to Liverpool they edged out rivals Manchester United to win the championship.

Kenny Dalglish moved upstairs to the position of Director of Football at the end of the Premier League winning season, and handed over the reins to his assistant Ray Harford. Blackburn Rovers made a poor start to the 1995–96 season, and found themselves in the bottom half for most of the first half of the season. Rovers also struggled in the Champions League and finished bottom of their group with just four points.

A poor start to the 1996–97 Premier League campaign saw Harford resign in late October with the club bottom of the division, having failed to win any of their first ten games. Relegation looked a real possibility, just two seasons after winning the league. After an abortive attempt to bring in Sven-Göran Eriksson as manager, long-serving coach Tony Parkes took over as manager for the rest of the campaign, narrowly steering the side to survival. That summer, the manager&#x27;s job was taken by Roy Hodgson, who joined the club from Internazionale. UEFA Cup football was secured with a 6th-place finish. Rovers made a poor start to the 1998–99 campaign and Hodgson was sacked in December less than an hour after a 2–0 home defeat by bottom side Southampton, a result that locked Rovers in the relegation zone. He was replaced as manager by Brian Kidd. Kidd failed to save Rovers from relegation.

===2000s===

In 1999–2000 Rovers began the season as promotion favourites, but with the club hovering just above the Division One relegation zone Brian Kidd was sacked in October and replaced in March by Graeme Souness. Jack Walker died just after the start of the 2000–01 season, and the club dedicated its promotion challenge in memory of their benefactor. Fittingly, they returned to the Premier League after a much improved season, finishing second behind Fulham.

In 2001–02, record signing Andy Cole was bought in for £8million, and Rovers won their first-ever League Cup by beating Tottenham Hotspur 2–1 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Cole scoring the winner in the 69th minute. The following season Rovers finished sixth to qualify for the UEFA Cup for the second season running. Souness left just after the start of 2004–05 to take charge at Newcastle, and he was replaced by Welsh national coach Mark Hughes. Hughes secured Rovers&#x27; Premier League survival for the 2004–05 season as well as an FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal, with Rovers finishing 15th once again. He led the team to sixth the following season and Rovers&#x27;s third European qualification in five years.

Rovers reached the semi-final of the 2006–07 FA Cup, but lost to Chelsea in extra time, and finished that season&#x27;s league in tenth, qualifying for the Intertoto Cup, which led to a short run in the 2007–08 UEFA Cup. In May 2008, Mark Hughes left Blackburn Rovers for the vacancy at Manchester City. He was replaced by Paul Ince, whose first job was to persuade some of the wantaway players to stay. with Archie Knox coming in as his assistant. Ince&#x27;s time in charge started well, but following a run of eleven games without a win he was sacked in December 2008. Sam Allardyce was appointed as Ince&#x27;s replacement and in 2009–10 he led the team to a tenth-place finish and a League Cup semi-final.

===2010 onwards===
In November 2010, the Indian company V H Group bought Blackburn Rovers under the name of Venky&#x27;s London Limited for £23 million. The new owners immediately sacked manager Sam Allardyce and replaced him with first-team coach Steve Kean, initially on a temporary basis, but by January 2011 he had been awarded a full-time contract until June 2013. Kean&#x27;s appointment was shrouded in controversy since his agent Jerome Anderson had earlier played a major role in advising Venky&#x27;s during the takeover of the club in the preceding months.

In December 2011, Blackburn Rovers posted an annual pre-tax loss of £18.6m for the year ending 30 June 2011. Despite this, the owners of Blackburn Rovers provided assurances over the continued funding of the club, even if they were relegated.

On 7 May 2012, Blackburn were relegated to the Championship after being defeated at home by Wigan Athletic in the penultimate game of the season, ending eleven years in the Premier League. At the start of the 2012–2013 season, Kean was given a chance by the owners to win promotion and kept his job as the manager. Ultimately though, pressure from the supporters who had been calling for the manager&#x27;s removal for months resulted in his resignation as manager on 29 September 2012.

On 7 May 2017, Blackburn were relegated to League One. On 24 April 2018, the club were promoted back to the second tier with a 1–0 win at Doncaster Rovers.

In recent years, they have finished 15th (2018–2019), 11th (2019–2020), 15th (2020–2021), 8th (2021–2022), and 7th (2022–2023) in the Championship.

In the 2023–2024 season, Blackburn narrowly avoided relegation on the final matchday, finishing in 19th place after a 2–0 win against title winners Leicester City, their lowest finish since their promotion back to the Championship in 2018.

==Managerial history==
==Colours==

Unlike most teams, Blackburn Rovers have only ever had one design to their home kit. The distinctive blue and white halved jersey is widely acknowledged as the &quot;town colour&quot;. Although the design has remained the same, the side in which the colours fall has often changed. Blue has resided on the wearers left since 1946; prior to this, the blue and white often switched order almost yearly.

Blackburn Rovers&#x27; first kit is uncertain. The 1905 book; Book of Football by Jonathan Russell describes Blackburn Rovers&#x27; first kit as a white jersey with Maltese Cross on the wearers left breast, Trousers and a blue and white skull cap. The Maltese Cross notorious with the public schools in which the founders of the club were educated. In contrast an account from the &quot;Blackburn Standard&quot; on 6 January 1894 accounts the first kit as navy blue and white quartered jersey (quartered accounting for the shirts four panels front and back), white knickers and navy hose. This account is much more synonymous with the kit today. Photographic evidence from 1878 shows the team in Blue and white halved (quartered) jerseys, white shorts and blue socks, complete with blue and white cap and Maltese Cross.

==Badge==

Through its history the club has adopted four badges as its crest; the Maltese Cross, the towns coat of arms, Lancashire Rose and the present day Blackburn Rovers Badge. From 1875 to approximately 1882 The Maltese Cross was present on the club&#x27;s first ever home kit and was worn by both the Shrewsbury and Malvern school teams. Two former Malvernians and two former Salopians played in that first team, so there is a clear link with these public schools.

During FA Cup finals it is tradition for the club to adopt the town&#x27;s coat of arms as their badge. This tradition has carried through all eight FA Cup finals the club has been a part of all the way to their last FA Cup final against Woverhampton Wanderers in 1960.

From roughly 1882 and excluding cup finals the club did not use a badge until 1974. In this year the club opted for an embroidered Lancashire Rose with the club&#x27;s initials &quot;B.R.F.C.&quot; below. This badge lasted unchanged for 15 years until it was 1989 due to visibility issues of the dark red rose on the dark blue of the shirt.

From 1989 to the present day the current Blackburn Rovers badge has been used. It has encompassed the previous badge in a newer design for the Lancashire Red Rose. Circling the rose is the team name &quot;Blackburn Rovers F.C.&quot; and the date in which the club was founded &quot;1875&quot;. At the base of the badge is the club motto, &quot;Arte Et Labore&quot; which translated means, &quot;by skill and by labour&quot;. This motto has been taken from the town motto which was adopted in 1852.

==Grounds==
===Oozehead Ground 1875–1877===
Rovers first home ground was a field at Oozehead on Preston New Road to the north west of the town. This field was farmland and was owned by a local farmer; when Blackburn Rovers weren&#x27;t using the field it was used to graze cows. In the centre of the field was a large watering hole, which on match days was covered with timber and turf.

===Pleasington Cricket Ground 1877===
Due to the rough conditions at Oozehead, the committee felt an established sports ground would be best to play on. Therefore, during the 1877 season they acquired the use of Pleasington&#x27;s cricket ground to the south west of the town. Play stopped on this ground after Henry Smith of Preston North End died of a heart attack whilst playing.

===Alexandra Meadows 1877–1881===
Still adopting cricket grounds, the committee acquired the use of the East Lancashire Cricket Club&#x27;s ground in the centre of the town, Alexandra Meadows. Sources differ as to the date of the first match played by Rovers at Alexandra Meadows. A programme from Clitheroe F.C. states that Clitheroe was the first team to beat Blackburn at Alexandra Meadows on 17 November 1877. Other sources indicate that the first match took place on 2 January 1878 with a Blackburn victory against Partick Thistle. It was on this ground Blackburn Rovers played for the first time under artificial light against Accrington on 4 November 1878.

===Leamington Road 1881–1890===
Due to the increasing demand in football in the area and in particular for Blackburn Rovers the committee felt that a private ground was more fitting. Therefore, in 1881 the club moved to Leamington Road, Blackburn Rovers&#x27; first purpose built ground including a 700-person capacity seated grandstand, costing £500. The first game played at this ground was held on 8 October 1881 against Blackburn Olympic resulting in a 4–1 win for Rovers. Whilst at Leamington Road and under James Fielding the club won three FA Cups and was inaugurated into the Football League as a founding Member in 1888. Despite the club&#x27;s success, they left Leamington Road due to an increase in lease costs.

===Ewood Park 1890–present===
Built in April 1882 as Ewood Bridge. The ground was an all purpose sporting venue hosting football, athletics and dog racing. The Blackburn Rovers committee felt this was the ideal venue for the club after having already played numerous games there in 1882. The first game played at the new Ewood Park ground was on 13 September 1890 against Accrington, the 0–0 draw was viewed by 10,000 people and on 31 October 1892 artificial lights were installed. Ewood sits on the bank of the River Darwen in Blackburn, Lancashire.

====1913 terrorist incident====

An attempt was made to destroy the ground in 1913. As part of the suffragette bombing and arson campaign, suffragettes carried out a series of bombings and arson attacks nationwide to publicise their campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage. In November 1913, suffragettes attempted to burn down Ewood Park&#x27;s grandstand but were foiled. In the same year, suffragettes succeeded in burning down Arsenal&#x27;s then South London stadium, and also attempted to burn down Preston North End&#x27;s ground. More traditionally male sports were targeted in order to protest against male dominance.

==Supporters and rivalries==
Blackburn Rovers supporters have formed several support clubs related to the team, and almost all of them are partially focused on making trips to Ewood Park easier. Rovers home games were well attended as a percentage of the Blackburn population throughout the 2000s with average attendances of around 25,000, equal to roughly a quarter of Blackburn&#x27;s population (approximately 100,000). The supporters&#x27; long-running fanzine is called &quot;4,000 Holes&quot;.

Clement Charnock and his brother Harry were Blackburn Rovers fans who introduced football into Russia in the 1880s.

Blackburn&#x27;s primary rivals are Burnley, with whom they contest the East Lancashire derby. Other rivalries for Rovers include Preston North End, Bolton Wanderers and Wigan Athletic, all by proximity.

<text>Procaine is a local anesthetic drug of the amino ester group. It is most commonly used in dental procedures to numb the area around a tooth and is also used to reduce the pain of intramuscular injection of penicillin. Owing to the ubiquity of the trade name Novocain (without the &quot;e&quot; in the original German patent) or Novocaine (with the &quot;e&quot; in the US patent), in some regions, procaine is referred to generically as novocaine. It acts mainly as a sodium channel blocker. Today, it is used therapeutically in some countries due to its sympatholytic, anti-inflammatory, perfusion-enhancing, and mood-enhancing effects.

Procaine was first synthesized in 1905, shortly after amylocaine. It was created by the chemist Alfred Einhorn who gave the chemical the trade name Novocain, from the Latin &quot;nov-&quot; (meaning &quot;new&quot;) and &quot;-caine&quot;, a common ending for alkaloids used as anesthetics. It was introduced into medical use by surgeon Heinrich Braun.

Prior to the discovery of amylocaine and procaine, cocaine was a commonly used local anesthetic. Einhorn wished his new discovery to be used for amputations, but for this surgeons preferred general anesthesia. Dentists, however, found it very useful.

==Pharmacology==

The primary use for procaine is as an anaesthetic.

Aside from its use as a dental anesthetic, procaine is used less frequently today, since more effective (and hypoallergenic) alternatives such as lidocaine (Xylocaine) exist. Like other local anesthetics (such as mepivacaine, and prilocaine), procaine is a vasodilator, thus is often coadministered with epinephrine for the purpose of vasoconstriction. Vasoconstriction helps to reduce bleeding, increases the duration and quality of anesthesia, prevents the drug from reaching systemic circulation in large amounts, and overall reduces the amount of anesthetic required. As a dental anesthesic, for example, more novocaine is needed for root canal treatment than for a simple filling. Unlike cocaine, a vasoconstrictor, procaine does not have the euphoric and addictive qualities that put it at risk for abuse.

Procaine, an ester anesthetic, is metabolized in the plasma by the enzyme pseudocholinesterase through hydrolysis into para-amino benzoic acid (PABA), which is then excreted by the kidneys into the urine.

A 1% procaine injection has been recommended for the treatment of extravasation complications associated with venipuncture, steroids, and antibiotics. It has likewise been recommended for treatment of inadvertent intra-arterial injections (10 ml of 1% procaine), as it helps relieve pain and vascular spasm.

Procaine is an occasional additive in illicit street drugs and is presented and sold usually as cocaine or heroin. 

==Adverse effects==
Application of procaine leads to the depression of neuronal activity. The depression causes the nervous system to become hypersensitive, producing restlessness and shaking, leading to minor to severe convulsions. Studies on animals have shown the use of procaine led to the increase of dopamine and serotonin levels in the brain. Other issues may occur because of varying individual tolerance to procaine dosage. Nervousness and dizziness can arise from the excitation of the central nervous system, which may lead to respiratory failure if overdosed. Procaine may also induce weakening of the myocardium leading to cardiac arrest.

Procaine can also cause allergic reactions causing individuals to have problems with breathing, rashes, and swelling. Allergic reactions to procaine are usually not in response to procaine itself, but to its metabolite PABA. Allergic reactions are in fact quite rare, estimated to have an incidence of 1 per 500,000 injections. About one in 3000 white North Americans is homozygous (i.e. has two copies of the abnormal gene) for the most common atypical form of the enzyme pseudocholinesterase, and do not hydrolyze ester anesthetics such as procaine. This results in a prolonged period of high levels of the anesthetic in the blood and increased toxicity.

However, certain populations in the world such as the Vysya community in India commonly have a deficiency of this enzyme.

==Synthesis==
Procaine can be synthesized in two ways. 

#The first consists of the direct reaction of the 4-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester with 2-diethylaminoethanol in the presence of sodium ethoxide. 
#The second is by oxidizing 4-nitrotoluene to 4-nitrobenzoic acid, which is further reacted with thionyl chloride, the resulting acid chloride is then esterified with 2-diethylaminoethanol to give Nitrocaine. Finally, the nitro group is reduced by hydrogenation over Raney nickel catalyst.

<doc id="298601" wikidata="Q19451" url="?curid=298601" title="Bolton Wanderers F.C.">
<text>Bolton Wanderers Football Club ( ) is a professional football club based in Bolton, Greater Manchester, England, which competes in League One, the third level of the English football league system.

Formed in 1874, it was a founding member of the Football League in 1888. The club won the Second Division title in 1908–09, and the FA Cup in 1923, the &quot;White Horse Final&quot;, 1926, 1929 and 1958. Bolton were relegated in 1964 and again in 1971, but regained their top-flight status after winning the Third Division title in 1972–73 and then the Second Division title in 1977–78, but three relegations left them in the fourth tier by 1987. Promotion out of the Fourth Division was secured in 1987–88, and they lifted the Football League Trophy in 1989 after being beaten finalists in 1986.

Promotions in 1992–93 and 1994–95 saw them reach the Premier League. Bolton won the First Division title in 1996–97, but were unable to survive more than one season in the Premier League until Sam Allardyce returned them to the top-flight with victory in the 2001 First Division play-off final. Bolton then spent eleven consecutive seasons in the Premier League, reaching the 2004 League Cup final and the knock-out stages of the UEFA Cup twice. Two relegations in five years left them in League One by 2016, and though they won promotion in 2016–17, severe financial difficulties saw the club enter administration in 2019 after relegation back into the third tier was confirmed. Facing possible EFL expulsion and probable extinction, the club was acquired by new owners. Relegated to the fourth tier in 2020, they won promotion out of League Two in the 2020–21 season and the EFL Trophy in the 2022–23 season.

From 1895 to 1997, the club played at Burnden Park, after moving from their original home at Pike&#x27;s Lane. Since 1997, Bolton have played home matches at what was originally named the Reebok Stadium, today the Toughsheet Community Stadium. They have spent 73 seasons in the top flight without winning the title, more than any other club.

==History==
===Early history (1877–1929)===
The club was founded by the Reverend Joseph Farrall Wright, Perpetual curate of Christ Church Bolton, and Thomas Ogden, the schoolmaster at the adjacent church school, in 1874 as Christ Church F.C. It was initially run from the church of the same name on Deane Road, Bolton, on the site where the Innovation factory of the University of Bolton now stands. The club left the location following a dispute with the vicar, and changed its name to Bolton Wanderers in 1877. The name was chosen as the club initially had a lot of difficulty finding a permanent ground to play on, having used three venues in its first four years of existence.

Bolton were one of the 12 founder members of the Football League, which formed in 1888. At the time Lancashire was one of the strongest footballing regions in the country, with 6 of the 12 founder clubs coming from within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire. Having remained in the Football League since its formation, Bolton have spent more time in the top flight (Premier League/old First Division) than out of it.

In 1894 Bolton reached the final of the FA Cup for the first time, but lost 4–1 to Notts County at Goodison Park. A decade later they were runners-up a second time, losing 1–0 to local rivals Manchester City at Crystal Palace on 23 April 1904.

The period before and after the First World War was Bolton&#x27;s most consistent period of top-flight success as measured by league finishes, with the club finishing outside the top 8 of the First Division on only two occasions between 1911–12 and 1927–28. In this period Bolton equalled their record finish of third twice, in 1920–21 and 1924–25, on the latter occasion missing out on the title by just 3 points (in an era of 2 points for a win).

On 28 April 1923, Bolton won their first major trophy in their third final, beating West Ham United 2–0 in the first ever Wembley FA Cup final. The match, famously known as The White Horse final was played in front of over 127,000 supporters. Bolton&#x27;s centre-forward, David Jack scored the first ever goal at Wembley Stadium. Driven by long-term players Joe Smith in attack, Ted Vizard and Billy Butler on the wings, and Jimmy Seddon in defence, they became the most successful cup side of the twenties, winning three times. Their second victory of the decade came in 1926, beating Manchester City 1–0 in front of over 91,000 spectators, and the third came in 1929 as Portsmouth were beaten 2–0 in front of nearly 93,000 fans.

In 1928, the club faced financial difficulties and was forced to sell David Jack to Arsenal to raise funds. Despite the pressure to sell, the agreed fee of £10,890 was a world record, more than double the previous most expensive transfer of a player.

===Top flight run and cup success (1929–1958)===
From 1935 to 1964, Bolton enjoyed an uninterrupted stay in the top flight – regarded by fans as a golden era – spearheaded in the 1950s by Nat Lofthouse. The years of the Second World War saw most of the Wanderers&#x27; playing staff see action on the front, a rare occurrence within elite football, as top sportsmen were generally assigned to physical training assignments, away from enemy fire. However, 15 Bolton professionals, led by their captain Harry Goslin, volunteered for active service in 1939, and enlisted in the 53rd (Bolton) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery. By the end of the war, 32 of the 35 pre-war professionals saw action in the British forces. The sole fatality was Goslin, who had by then risen to the rank of Lieutenant and was killed by shrapnel on the Italian front shortly before Christmas 1943. 53rd Bolton Artillery took part in the Battle of Dunkirk and also served in the campaigns of Egypt, Iraq and Italy. Remarkably, a number of these soldiers managed to carry on playing the game in these theatres of war, taking on as &#x27;British XI&#x27; various scratch teams assembled by, among others, King Farouk of Egypt in Cairo and Polish forces in Baghdad.

On 9 March 1946, the club&#x27;s home was the scene of the Burnden Park disaster which, at the time, was the worst tragedy in British football history. 33 Bolton Wanderers fans were crushed to death, and another 400 injured, in an FA Cup quarter-final second leg tie between Bolton and Stoke City. There was an estimated 67,000-strong crowd crammed in for the game, though other estimates vary widely, and a further 15,000 had been locked out when it became clear the stadium was full. The disaster led to Moelwyn Hughes&#x27;s official report, which recommended more rigorous control of crowd sizes.

In 1953, Bolton played in one of the most famous FA Cup finals of all time – The Stanley Matthews final of 1953. Bolton lost the game to Blackpool 4–3 after having had a 3–1 lead. Blackpool were victorious thanks to the skills of Matthews and the goals of Stan Mortensen.

Bolton Wanderers have not won a major trophy since 1958, when two Lofthouse goals saw them overcome Manchester United in the FA Cup final in front of a 100,000 crowd at Wembley Stadium. The closest they have come to winning a major trophy since then is finishing runners-up in the League Cup, first in 1995 and again in 2004.

===Few highs and many lows (1958–1995)===
While Bolton finished fourth the following season, the next 20 years proved to be a fallow period. The club suffered relegation to the Second Division in 1963–64, and were then relegated again to the Third Division for the first time in their history in 1970–71. This stay in the Third Division lasted just two years before the club were promoted as champions in 1972–73. Hopes were high at Burnden Park in May 1978 when Bolton sealed the Second Division title and gained promotion to the First Division. However, they only remained there for two seasons before being relegated.

Following relegation in 1980, Bolton signed up talented striker Brian Kidd, as they prepared to challenge for a quick return to the First Division. Kidd scored a hat-trick in his third game for Bolton, a 4–0 win over Newcastle United in the league, but the rest of the season was a struggle as Bolton finished close to the relegation places. By the end of the 1981–82 season, Bolton were no closer to promotion and had lost several key players including Peter Reid and Neil Whatmore. The following season Bolton were relegated to the Third Division after losing 4–1 at Charlton Athletic on the final day.

Despite a new-look, much younger team, and an 8–1 win over Walsall, Bolton&#x27;s best league win for 50 years, Bolton failed to win promotion in the 1983–84 season, and remained in the Third Division for another three seasons. In 1986, Nat Lofthouse was appointed President of the football club, a position he would hold until his death on 15 January 2011. At the end of the 1986–87 season, Bolton Wanderers suffered relegation to the Fourth Division for the first time in their history, but won promotion back to the Third Division at the first attempt. The club won the Sherpa Van Trophy in 1989, defeating Torquay United 4–1. During the 1990–91 season, Bolton were pipped to the final automatic promotion place by Southend United and lost to Tranmere Rovers in the play-off final, but they failed to build on this and the following season saw the club finish 13th.

The early 1990s saw Bolton gain a giant-killing reputation in cup competitions. In 1993, Bolton beat FA Cup holders Liverpool 2–0 in a third round replay at Anfield, thanks to goals from John McGinlay and Andy Walker. The club also defeated higher division opposition in the form of Wolverhampton Wanderers (2–1) that year before bowing out to Derby County. Bolton also secured promotion to the second tier for the first time since 1983. In 1994 Bolton again beat FA Cup holders, this time in the form of Arsenal, 3–1 after extra time in a fourth round replay, and went on to reach the quarter-finals, bowing out 1–0 at home to local rivals (and then Premiership) Oldham Athletic. Bolton also defeated top division opposition in the form of Everton (3–2) and Aston Villa (1–0) that year.

===Return to the top flight and venture into Europe (1995–2012)===
Bolton reached the Premiership in 1995, thanks to a 4–3 victory over Reading in the Division One play-off final. Reading took a 2–0 lead before a Keith Branagan penalty save in the 42nd minute changed the course of the game. Bolton scored two late goals to take the game to extra time, scoring twice more before a late Reading consolation. The same year Bolton progressed to the League Cup final, but were defeated 2–1 by Liverpool. Bolton were bottom for virtually all of the 1995–96 Premiership campaign and were relegated as they lost their penultimate game 1–0 to Southampton.

The club won promotion back to the Premiership at the first attempt, after a season in which they achieved 98 league points and 100 goals in the process of securing the Division One championship, the first time since 1978 that they had finished top of any division. That season also marked the club&#x27;s move from Burnden Park to the new Reebok Stadium, the last game at the stadium being a 4–1 win over Charlton Athletic.

Bolton were relegated on goal difference at the end of the 1997–98 Premiership campaign. They finished on the same number of points as Everton, whom they had faced in the first competitive match at the new Reebok Stadium. That game finished 0–0, but the failure to award a goal scored by Gerry Taggart for the Whites meant that they did not gain the additional point which, at the end of the seasion, would have kept them up. The following season, they reached the 1999 Division One play-off final but lost 2–0 to Watford.

In 2000, Bolton reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, Worthington Cup and play-offs but lost on penalties to Aston Villa, 4–0 on aggregate to Tranmere Rovers and 7–5 on aggregate to Ipswich Town respectively. In 2000–01 Bolton were promoted back to the Premiership after beating Preston North End 3–0 in the play-off final.

Bolton struggled during the following two seasons, but survived in the Premiership. The 2001–02 season began with a shock victory as they destroyed Leicester 5–0 at Filbert Street. They followed that win with two more, over Middlesbrough and Liverpool, to go top of the top flight table for the first time since 1891. Despite a 2–1 win away at Manchester United, becoming the first team since the formation of the Premiership to come from behind and win a league game at Old Trafford, Bolton went into a deep slump during the middle of the season and needed a Fredi Bobic hat-trick against Ipswich Town to survive. Despite losing the final three games, 16th place was secured. The 2002–03 season began with a poor start and, despite another win away at Manchester United, they were bottom until a 4–2 win against Leeds United at Elland Road. Despite suffering from a lack of consistency, Bolton achieved the results needed and secured survival in a final day 2–1 victory over Middlesbrough.

Bolton reached the League Cup final in 2004, but lost 2–1 to Middlesbrough. Nevertheless, the club finished eighth in the league, at the time the highest finish in their Premiership history.

In 2005, Bolton finished sixth in the league, thus earning qualification for the UEFA Cup for the first time in their history. The following season, they reached the last 32 but were eliminated by French team Marseille as they lost 2–1 on aggregate. Between 2003–04 and 2006–07, Bolton recorded consecutive top-eight finishes, a record of consistency bettered only by the big four of Chelsea, Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal. Towards the end of the 2006–07 season, long-serving manager Sam Allardyce departed the club, stating that he was taking a sabbatical, but he was hired shortly thereafter as manager of Newcastle United. Allardyce later cited a lack of ambition on the part of the club&#x27;s board for his departure. In January 2007, he had unsuccessfully sought financial backing to push the club towards Champions League qualification.

The 2007–08 season saw Bolton survive with a 16th-place finish, their safety being confirmed on the final day of the season, as they went on an unbeaten run for their final five games, as well as getting to the last sixteen of the UEFA Cup. Former assistant manager Sammy Lee replaced Allardyce as manager, but a poor start to the season saw him replaced by Gary Megson. During the European run, Bolton gained an unexpected 2–2 draw against former European champions Bayern Munich, as well as becoming the first English team to beat Red Star Belgrade in Belgrade. They also defeated Atlético Madrid on aggregate before being knocked out by Sporting Lisbon.

Bolton broke their record transfer fee with the signing of Johan Elmander from Toulouse on 27 June 2008, in a deal which cost the club a reported £8.2 million and saw Norwegian striker Daniel Braaten head in the opposite direction. Megson was replaced part-way through the 2009–2010 season by former Wanderers striker Owen Coyle, after Megson endured a difficult relationship with the fans. In the 2010–11 FA Cup, Bolton progressed all the way to the semi-finals, but were beaten 5–0 by Stoke at Wembley, with the match being described as &quot;a massive anti-climax&quot;.

The following season began as the previous one had ended with just one win and six defeats, their worst start since the 1902–03 season when they were relegated. On 17 March 2012, manager Owen Coyle travelled to the London Chest Hospital with Fabrice Muamba who had suffered from a cardiac arrest whilst playing against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane in a FA Cup match. Muamba stayed in a critical condition for several weeks and Coyle was widely praised for the manner in which he represented the club during the period. That 13 May, Bolton were relegated to the Championship by one point on the last day of the season after drawing 2–2 with Stoke City.

===Return to the Championship (2012–2018)===
The 2012–13 Championship season started badly for Bolton, with only three wins in ten league matches and a second round exit from the League Cup following a loss at Crawley Town. As a result of poor performances leaving them in 16th place, Bolton sacked Coyle on 9 October 2012, replacing him with Crystal Palace&#x27;s Dougie Freedman. They finished in seventh place, losing out on a play-off place to Leicester City on goal difference. The 2013–14 began with a trip to Turf Moor, in celebration of the 125th anniversary of the Football League. Freedman was fired after a torrid run of results at the beginning of the 2014–2015 season; he was replaced by former Celtic manager Neil Lennon, who promptly won his first game in charge 1–0 away at Birmingham.

In December 2015, Bolton, who were £172.9 million in debt, were handed a winding-up petition from HM Revenue and Customs over unpaid taxes, and a transfer embargo for the following month&#x27;s window. Much of this debt owed to former owner Eddie Davies was confirmed to have been written off in March 2018, to assist with the club&#x27;s potential sale prospects. After ending a 17-game winless run, Lennon, who had been investigated by the club due to allegations about his personal life, said that the club had &quot;been through hell&quot;. On 18 January 2016, the club avoided an immediate winding-up order after their case was adjourned until 22 February to give it time to either close a deal with a potential buyer or raise sufficient short-term funds from asset sales. The club was said to owe HM Revenue and Customs £2.2m. The financial situation had improved as a takeover bid by Dean Holdsworth&#x27;s Sports Shield was successful in March 2016. Lennon was removed from his position for the final few games of the season, replaced by Academy manager Jimmy Phillips. On 9 April 2016, Bolton lost 4–1 away at Derby County to confirm their relegation to the third tier for the first time since 1993.

Under new manager Phil Parkinson, Bolton won promotion from League One at the first time of asking with a second-place finish. On 14 September 2017, the board announced that the embargo was over. Bolton started their first season back in the Championship poorly, only earning their first victory in October. Their form improved mid-season, however going into the final round of fixtures Bolton were in the relegation zone, needing a win to stand a chance of securing survival. They achieved this to finish 21st, narrowly avoiding relegation, having fought back from 2–1 down to win 3–2 at home against Nottingham Forest in the last ten minutes of their final match of the season.

===Relegation and financial crisis (2018–2019)===
Throughout the 2018–19 Championship season Bolton faced financial difficulties. On 12 September 2018, Bolton reached an agreement with their main creditor BluMarble Capital Ltd over an unpaid loan, avoiding administration and a points deduction from the EFL. Bolton were served a winding-up order on 27 September 2018 after failing to make a payment to HM Revenue and Customs. This was the fourth such petition the club had faced in the previous 14 months. After the collapse of the permanent signing of on-loan striker Christian Doidge, Forest Green Rovers commenced legal action over lost earnings. In February 2019, Bolton were again issued a winding-up petition by HMRC which was subsequently adjourned until the end of the season as their search for a new owner continued. The match against Brentford on 26 April was called off by the English Football League 16 hours before kick off after Bolton&#x27;s players, supported by the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association, refused to play until they had received their unpaid wages; the EFL awarded the win to Brentford. The Bolton Whites Hotel, owned by Ken Anderson, was also issued with a winding-up petition in March 2019 (it closed on 1 May and went into administration on 14 May). The team was relegated to League One in April after a 23rd-place finish.

In May 2019, the club went into administration due to a £1.2m unpaid tax bill, incurring a 12-point penalty for the 2019–2020 season. Fildraw (former owner Eddie Davies&#x27; trust fund) appointed administrators from insolvency firm David Rubin and Partners. A 17 July statement from the Bolton players said that no-one at the club had been paid by owner Ken Anderson for 20 weeks, the training ground had no potable drinking water nor hot water for showers. Pre-season friendlies were cancelled as Bolton could not give assurances about fielding a competitive team.

Anderson failed to find a buyer before the start of the season, and Bolton started their opening League One game on 3 August at Wycombe Wanderers with only three contracted senior outfield players, and lost 2–0. A week later, Bolton fielded its youngest ever side, with an average age of 19, in a goalless home draw against Coventry City. Manager Phil Parkinson expressed concern about the welfare of the youth players used in all of Bolton&#x27;s games, leading Bolton to postpone the game against Doncaster Rovers on 20 August but without informing either Doncaster or the EFL.
Parkinson and assistant Steve Parkin resigned the following day, with academy manager Jimmy Phillips taking interim charge. On 26 August, it was announced that the takeover by Football Ventures had fallen through one day before the EFL deadline, potentially risking the club going into liquidation. After Bolton failed to meet that deadline, the suspension of its notice of withdrawal from the EFL was lifted; however, the club was not immediately expelled from the EFL – it was given until 12 September 2019 to meet all outstanding requirements of the League&#x27;s insolvency policy.

===Under new ownership (2019–)===
On 28 August, Bolton announced that the club&#x27;s sale to Football Ventures (Whites) Limited had been completed, with the administrator paying tribute to the Eddie Davies Trust and their legal team, and criticising Ken Anderson who had &quot;used his position as a secured creditor to hamper and frustrate any deal that did not benefit him or suit his purposes.&quot; Days later, Keith Hill was announced as the new club manager. He signed nine players before the transfer deadline closed, and his first win came on 22 October, 2–0 against Bristol Rovers, Bolton&#x27;s first win in 22 matches.

On 21 November 2019, Bolton were handed a five-point deduction, suspended for 18 months, and fined £70,000, half of which was suspended for 18 months, for failure to fulfil two fixtures (against Brentford and Doncaster). The points would not be deducted if Bolton fulfilled all fixtures during the 18-month period. An EFL appeal against what it saw as a &quot;lenient&quot; penalty was rejected by an arbitration panel in January 2020. On 9 June 2020, the EFL League One decided to end the 2019–20 season early due to the COVID-19 pandemic, causing bottom club Bolton Wanderers to go down to the fourth tier of English football for the first time since 1988 and only the second time in their history. Following relegation, the club announced that Keith Hill and assistant David Flitcroft would leave the club when their contracts expired at the end of June. Barrow manager Ian Evatt was appointed Hill&#x27;s successor on 1 July 2020. Despite being in 17th place after 24 matches, Bolton orchestrated an impressive season turnaround under Evatt. They completed the 2020–21 League Two season in third place after a 4–1 win against Crawley Town on the final day – enough to secure automatic promotion to League One – and early in the 2021–22 season settled debts with unsecured creditors to remove the threat of a 15-point deduction.

In January 2022, it was confirmed that the club had received an emergency loan from The Future Fund, a financial support scheme set up during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was subsequently converted into shares of the club, with around 8% of shares now owned by the British Business Bank, an economic development bank developed and run by HM Government.

On 2 April 2023, Bolton won the 2023 EFL Trophy final 4–0 against Plymouth Argyle. The following year, Evatt also led Wanderers to the 2024 EFL League One play-off final on 18 May, where they were beaten 2–0 by Oxford United. However, Bolton struggled in the 2024–25 season and Evatt left the club in January 2025, being replaced by Steven Schumacher.

==Colours and badge==

Bolton Wanderers&#x27; home colours are white shirts with navy and red trim, traditionally worn with navy shorts and white socks. Their away kits have been varied over the years, with navy kits and yellow kits among the most popular and common. Bolton did not always wear a white kit; in 1884 they wore white with red spots, leading to the club&#x27;s original nickname of &quot;The Spots&quot;. The traditional navy blue shorts were dispensed with in 2003, in favour of an all-white strip, but they returned in 2008. The club had previously experimented with an all-white kit in the 1970s.

The Bolton Wanderers club badge consists of the initials of the club in the shape of a ball, with a red scroll and Lancashire rose underneath. The current badge is a reimagining of one designed in 1975; this was replaced in 2001 by a badge which retained the recognisable initials but controversially exchanged the scroll and rose for blue and red ribbons. The re-design has been welcomed by fans as the red rose returned to the badge and those who saw the ribbons as a poor choice. The original club badge was the town crest of Bolton, a key feature of which was the Elephant and Castle motif with the town motto – Supera Moras meaning &quot;Overcome Delays&quot;. This feature has been reincorporated on the back of some more recent club shirts which was seen as a nice touch by some.

The club&#x27;s nickname of &quot;The Trotters&quot; has several claimed derivations; that it is simply a variation on &quot;Wanderers&quot;, that it is an old local term for a practical joker, or that one of the grounds used before the club settled at Pikes Lane resided next to a piggery, causing players to have to &quot;trot&quot; through the pig pens to retrieve the ball if it went over the fence.

==Grounds==

When the club was first founded, Christ Church had a nomadic existence, playing at a number of locations in the area. The club, which had by then been renamed Bolton Wanderers, started playing regularly at Pike&#x27;s Lane in 1881. Spending £150 on pitch improvements, season tickets cost a guinea. They played here for fourteen years until the tenancy expired and they moved to Burnden Park.

Situated in the Burnden area of Bolton, approximately one mile from the centre of the town, the ground served as the home of the town&#x27;s football team for 102 years. In its heyday, Burnden Park could hold up to 70,000 supporters but this figure was dramatically reduced during the final 20 years of its life. A section of The Embankment was sold off in 1986 to make way for a new Normid superstore. At this time, Bolton were in a dire position financially and were struggling in the Football League Third Division, so there was a low demand for tickets and the loss of part of the ground gave the Bolton directors good value for money.

By 1992 the club&#x27;s directors had decided that it would be difficult to convert Burnden Park into an all-seater stadium for a club of Bolton&#x27;s ambition, as the Taylor Report required all first- and second-tier clubs to do. A decision was made to build an out of town stadium in the town of Horwich, with the eventual location chosen 5 miles due west of the town centre. The stadium opened in August 1997, as a modern, all-seater stadium with a capacity of around 29,000. In recognition of the club&#x27;s former ground the stadium stands on &quot;Burnden Way&quot;. It has four stands, though the lower-tier seating is one continuous bowl. It was originally known as the &quot;Reebok Stadium&quot; after long-time team sponsor, Reebok. This was initially unpopular with many fans, as it was considered impersonal, and that too much emphasis was being placed on financial considerations. This opposition considerably lessened since the stadium was built. In April 2014, the stadium was renamed as part of a four-year deal with new sponsors Macron sportswear. When this deal came to an end in August 2018 the stadium was again renamed, this time as the University of Bolton Stadium. In 2023, a new record-breaking stadium naming rights deal was announced with Bolton-based recyclable building products manufacturer Toughsheet, leading the stadium to be renamed the Toughsheet Community Stadium.

In 2014 the club established Bolton Wanderers Free School at the stadium, a sixth form offering sports and related courses for 16 to 19-year-olds. However, this was later closed in 2017 due to low pupil numbers which deemed it &#x27;not financially viable&#x27;.

==Rivalries and supporters==
Bolton Wanderers Supporters&#x27; Association (BWSA) is the official supporters&#x27; association of Bolton Wanderers Football Club. The Supporters&#x27; Association was formed in 1992, on the initiative of a fan, Peter Entwistle. Later that year the Directors of the football club, satisfied that the Association had proven itself to be organised and responsible, officially recognised Bolton Wanderers Supporters&#x27; Association as the club&#x27;s supporters&#x27; group.

In 1997, shortly after the move from Burnden Park to the Reebok Stadium, the BWSA accepted the invitation from the football club to hold its monthly meetings at the new stadium. The Toughsheet Community Stadium has continued to be their venue ever since. In the year 2000, the Association expanded significantly when its invitation to affiliate was accepted by Bolton Wanderers supporters groups in other parts of Britain, and also by groups around the world. All of these foreign groups have come on board to become independent, but integral, parts of the official Bolton Wanderers supporters&#x27; family. Requests for affiliated status continue to be received regularly from other places around the world where Wanderers fans find themselves gather together.

Historically Bolton&#x27;s traditional rivals were near neighbours Bury, though due to limited league meetings and Bury&#x27;s expulsion from the Football League in August 2019 the rivalry has lessened considerably. The club also has traditional rivalries with fellow Lancashire clubs Blackburn Rovers, Burnley and Preston North End, as all three sides are separated by less than 20 miles and are all founder members of the Football League. More recently, Bolton have developed an enmity with Wigan Athletic, whose fans generally regard Bolton as their main rivals. Wigan eventually became known as Bolton biggest rivals, and crowd trouble marred the 16 October 2021 meeting between the two clubs. A study in 2021 found that the Bolton/Wigan rivalry was the most competitive in all of English Football history, with both teams having an identical record against each other at the time.

According to a survey conducted in August 2019 entitled &#x27;The League of Love and Hate&#x27;, Bolton supporters named Manchester United, Blackburn Rovers, Wigan Athletic, Oldham Athletic and Bury as their biggest rivals.

==Ownership and finances==
The holding company of Bolton Wanderers F.C. is Burnden Leisure Ltd, a private company limited by shares. Burnden Leisure was previously a public company traded on the AIM stock exchange until its voluntary delisting in May 2003 following Eddie Davies&#x27;s takeover. The club itself is 100% owned by Burnden Leisure; businessman Davies owned 94.5% of the shares, with the remaining stakes held by over 6,000 small shareholders with less than 0.1% holding each. After Bolton exited the Premier League, Davies revoked his investment into the club. This led to published debts of almost £200m and brought the club very close to being wound up over unpaid tax bills owed to HMRC. As a gesture of his goodwill and as incentive to sell the club, Davies promised to wipe over £125m of debt owed to him when the club was sold, which wiped a significant proportion of debt the club owed.

In March 2016, Sports Shield, a consortium led by Dean Holdsworth, bought Davies&#x27; controlling stake; a year later, Holdsworth shareholding in Sports Shield was bought out by Ken Anderson. Under Anderson, financial difficulties dogged the club, with player strikes, further winding up orders and financial disputes with other creditors. These culminated in the club (Burnden Leisure Ltd) going into administration in May 2019, and, with the club&#x27;s future ownership unresolved, being threatened with expulsion from the EFL in August 2019. On 28 August, the club was sold to Football Ventures (Whites) Ltd despite opposition from Ken Anderson.

In January 2022, it was confirmed that the club had received an emergency loan from The Future Fund, a financial support scheme set up during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was subsequently converted into shares of the club, with around 8% of shares now owned by the British Business Bank, an economic development bank developed and run by HM Government.

===Sponsorship===
Bolton Wanderers had a long-established partnership with sporting goods firm Reebok, which was formed in the town. Between 1997 and 2009 this partnership encompassed shirt sponsorship, kit manufacture and stadium naming rights. The combined shirt sponsorship (1990–2009) and kit manufacture (1993–2012) deals covering 22 years represent the longest kit partnership in English football history. The stadium&#x27;s naming rights were held by Reebok from its opening in 1997 until 2014.

Bolton&#x27;s kit manufacturer from the 2014–15 season changed to Italian sportswear brand Macron, who also became stadium name sponsors for four years. In August 2018, the stadium naming rights went to the University of Bolton in an undisclosed deal. From 1 July 2023 it became known as the Toughsheet Community Stadium.
