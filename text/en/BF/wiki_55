<text>The Ford Thunderbird is a personal luxury car manufactured and marketed by Ford Motor Company for model years 1955 to 2005, with a hiatus from 1998–2001.

Ultimately gaining a broadly used colloquial nickname, the &quot;T-Bird&quot;, Ford Introduced the model as a two-seat convertible, subsequently offering it variously in a host of body styles including as a four-seat hardtop coupe, four-seat convertible, five-seat convertible and hardtop, four-door pillared hardtop sedan, six-passenger hardtop coupe, and five-passenger pillared coupe — before returning in its final generation, again as a two-seat convertible.

At its inception, Ford targeted the two-seat Thunderbird as an upscale model. The 1958 model year design introduced a rear seat and arguably marked the expansion of a market segment that came to be known as &quot;personal luxury cars&quot;, positioned to emphasize comfort and convenience over handling and high-speed performance.

==Overview==
The Thunderbird entered production for model year 1955, marketed as an upscale, &quot;sporty&quot; two-seat convertible rather than as a sports car, per se — averting direct competition with the Chevrolet Corvette. With the 1958 introduction of second row seating, the Thunderbird led a new market segment, the so-called &quot;personal luxury car.&quot; Subsequent generations became successively larger until the line was downsized, first in 1977, again for 1980, and once again in 1983. 

By the 1990s, the Thunderbird&#x27;s core market, the large two-door coupe, had fallen almost completely out of favor. Production ended with model year 1997, resuming for model years 2002-2005 as a smaller two-passenger convertible.

From its introduction in 1955 to its termination in 2005, production reached over 4.4 million.

==Development==
A smaller two-seater sports roadster, named the Vega, was developed in 1953 at the request of Henry Ford II. The completed one-off generated interest at the time, but had meager power, European looks, and a correspondingly high cost, so it never proceeded to production. The Thunderbird was similar in concept but was more American in style, more luxurious, and less sport-oriented.

Credit for the development of the original Thunderbird is given to Lewis Crusoe, a former GM executive lured out of retirement by Henry Ford II; George Walker, chief stylist and a Ford vice president; Frank Hershey, chief stylist for the Ford Division; Bill Boyer, designer for the Body Development Studio, who became the manager of the Thunderbird Studio in the spring of 1955; and Bill Burnett, chief engineer. Ford Designer William P. Boyer was the lead stylist on the original 1955 two-seater Thunderbird and also had input in the following series of Thunderbirds that included the 30th Anniversary Edition. Hershey&#x27;s participation in the creation of the Thunderbird was more administrative than artistic. Crusoe and Walker met in France in October 1951. Walking in the Grand Palais in Paris, Crusoe pointed at a sports car and asked Walker, &quot;Why can&#x27;t we have something like that?&quot; Some versions of the story claim that Walker replied by telling Crusoe, &quot;Oh, we&#x27;re working on it&quot; ... although if anything existed at the time beyond casual dream-car sketches by members of the design staff, records of it have never come to light.

Walker promptly telephoned Ford&#x27;s HQ in Dearborn and told designer Frank Hershey about the conversation with Crusoe. Hershey took the idea and began working on the vehicle. The concept was for a two-passenger open car, with a target weight of , a Ford Y-block Interceptor V8 based on the forthcoming overhead-valve Ford engine slated for 1954 model year introduction, and a top speed over . Crusoe saw a painted clay model on May 18, 1953, which corresponded closely to the final car; he gave the car the go-ahead in September after comparing it with current European trends. After Henry Ford II returned from the Los Angeles Auto Show (Autorama) in 1953, he approved the final design concept to compete with the then-new Corvette.

The name was not among the thousands proposed, including rejected options such as Apache (the original name of the P-51 Mustang), Falcon (owned by Chrysler at the time), Eagle, Tropicale, Hawaiian, and Thunderbolt. A Ford stylist who had lived in the southwest submitted the Thunderbird name, a reference to the mythological thunderbird, a supernatural bird of great power and strength of the North American indigenous people.

At the time, Ernest Breech, then chairman of Ford Motor Company, was a member of the Thunderbird Country Club in Rancho Mirage, California. According to club lore, he asked its permission to use the name, which was granted.

==Generations==
===First generation (1955–1957)===

The Ford Thunderbird was introduced in February 1953 as a response to Chevrolet&#x27;s new sports car, the Corvette, which was publicly unveiled in prototype form just a month before. Under rapid development, the Thunderbird went from idea to prototype in about a year, being unveiled to the public at the Detroit Auto Show on February 20, 1954. It was a two-seat design available with a detachable fiberglass hardtop and a folding fabric top.

Production of the Thunderbird began on September 9 of that year, with the car beginning sales as a 1955 model on October 22, 1954. Though sharing some design characteristics with other Fords of the time such as single circular headlamps and tail lamps, and modest tail fins, the Thunderbird was sleeker in shape and featured a hood scoop and a speedometer not available on other Fords. It used mechanical components from mass-market Ford models. The Thunderbird&#x27;s wheelbase frame was a shortened version used in other Fords and the standard Y-block V8 came from Ford&#x27;s Mercury division.

Though inspired by and positioned directly against the Corvette, Ford advertised the Thunderbird at launch as a &quot;personal car of distinction&quot; and put a greater emphasis on the car&#x27;s comfort and convenience features rather than its inherent sportiness.

The Thunderbird sold exceptionally well in its first year, outselling the Corvette by more than 23-to-one in 1955 with 16,155 Thunderbirds sold against 700 Corvettes.

With the Thunderbird considered a success, few changes were made to the car for the 1956 model year. The most notable change was moving the spare tire to a Continental-style rear bumper to make more storage room in the trunk and a new 12-volt electrical system. The addition of the weight at the rear caused steering issues. Among the few other changes were new paint colors, the addition of standard circular porthole windows in the fiberglass roof to improve rearward visibility (with a delete option), and a Y-block V8 rated at when mated to a three-speed manual transmission or when mated to a &quot;Ford-O-Matic&quot; three-speed automatic transmission; this transmission featured a &quot;low gear&quot;, which was accessible manually via the gear selector. When in Drive, it was a two-speed automatic transmission (similar to Chevrolet&#x27;s Powerglide). Low gear could also be accessed with a wide-open throttle. In 1956, Ford also added its new Lifeguard safety package.

The Thunderbird was revised for 1957 with a reshaped front bumper, a larger grille and tailfins, and larger tail lamps. The instrument panel was heavily restyled with round gauges in a single pod, and the rear of the car was lengthened, allowing the spare tire to be positioned back in the trunk. The V8 became the Thunderbird&#x27;s standard engine, and was rated at an increased . Other, more powerful versions of this V8 were available, including one with two four-barrel Holley carburetors (VIN code &quot;E&quot;), and another with a Paxton supercharger rated at (VIN code &quot;F&quot;). Though Ford was pleased to see sales of the Thunderbird rise to a highest ever 21,380 units for 1957, company executives felt the car could do even better, leading to a substantial redesign of the car for 1958.

===Second generation (1958–1960)===

Although the 1955–57 Thunderbird was a success, Ford executives—particularly Robert McNamara—were concerned that the car&#x27;s position as a two-seater limited its sales potential. As a result, the car was redesigned as a four-seater for 1958.

Despite being released mid-model year, the new Thunderbird began a sales momentum previously unseen with the car, selling 200,000 units in three years, four times that of the three-year two-seat model run. This success spawned a new market segment, the personal luxury car. It was the first individual model line (as opposed to an entire brand&#x27;s line) to earn &quot;Motor Trend&quot; &quot;Car of the Year&quot; honors.

It was offered in both hardtop and convertible body styles, although the latter was not introduced until June 1958, five months after the release of the hardtop. The new Thunderbird was considerably larger than the previous generation, with a longer wheelbase to accommodate the new back seat. The increased size also increased the car&#x27;s weight by . Along with a new, more rigid unibody construction was new styling, including quad headlights, more prominent tailfins, a bolder chrome grille, and a larger, though nonfunctional, hood scoop. The engine was the new FE V8, available with a three-speed manual or automatic transmissions. The mid-1958 model year sales were 37,892 units, an increase of 16,000 over the previous year.

For 1959, the Thunderbird featured a new grille and a newly optional MEL V8 engine. Sales increased to 67,456 units.

For the 1960 model year, the grille was again redesigned along with minor styling changes. A new option was a manually operated sunroof for hardtop models. The dual-unit round taillights featured on the 1958 and 1959 were changed to triple-units. Sales increased again, with 92,843 sold in 1960.
===Third generation (1961–1963)===

The Thunderbird was redesigned for 1961 with styling that gave the car a futuristic bullet-like body-side appearance. A new engine, the FE V8, was the standard and only engine initially offered in the Thunderbird. It was rated at and was mated to a three-speed automatic transmission. The new Thunderbird was well received, with 73,051 sold for 1961.

The car was 1961&#x27;s Indianapolis 500 pace car and was featured prominently in US President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s inaugural parade, who appointed Ford executive Robert McNamara as secretary of defense. It also benefitted from product placement, notably on the popular television series &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;.

A vinyl-roofed Landau option with simulated S-bars was added to the Thunderbird for 1962 as was a Sports Roadster package for convertible models. The Sports Roadster included 48-spoke Kelsey-Hayes-designed wire wheels and a special fiberglass tonneau cover for the rear seats, which gave the car the appearance of a two-seat roadster like the original Thunderbird. The Sports Roadster package was slow-selling due to the high price of the package and the complexity of the tonneau cover.

Newly optional for 1962 was a version of the V8 equipped with three two-barrel Holley carburetors. For 1963 only, The engine was only available in cars equipped with factory air conditioning.

Few other changes were made to the Thunderbird for 1963, as Ford prepared to introduce a new version for 1964. A horizontal styling line was added that ran from the front of the car back through the door. Small diagonal chrome bars were added in this area on the door. Alternators rather than generators were a new feature on all 1963 Thunderbirds.

===Fourth generation (1964–1966)===


For 1964, the Thunderbird was restyled in favor of a more squared-off appearance, which was mostly evident when viewing the car from the side or rear. Hinting at its roots in the previous generation of Thunderbird, the new model retained a similar grille design with quad headlights and a wheelbase. As before, the new Thunderbird continued to be offered in hardtop, convertible, and landau versions. The FE V8 continued as the standard engine. It was paired with a three-speed automatic transmission. For 1965, sequential turn signals were added, flashing the individual segments of the broad, horizontal tail lights from inside to outside. Also new for 1965 were standard front disc brakes.

The 1966 model received a new egg crate-style grille and a single-blade front bumper. Its restyled rear bumper included new full-width taillamps. The standard V8 equipped with a single four-barrel carburetor was rated at , and a FE V8 became the top power option. This was the last year for the convertible until the &quot;retro&quot; models of 2002–05.
===Fifth generation (1967–1971)===
1967–1969
From 1958 through 1966, the Thunderbird had remained fundamentally the same in concept as a two-door coupe/convertible with two rows of seating. The 1967 model year introduction by Lincoln-Mercury of the similarly configured Mercury Cougar, the most luxurious of the flood of &quot;pony cars&quot; to follow the wildly successful mid-1964 introduction of the Ford Mustang but still considerably less expensive than the Thunderbird, created a challenge to its market positioning. To combat this, the fifth generation Thunderbird was upsized, and a four-door option was added.

The new Thunderbird was no longer unibody, but a body-on-frame construction. The convertible was discontinued in favor of an optional four-door hardtop coupe with suicide doors and a very wide C-pillar. It received simulated landau bars to help minimize its visual mass. A new front end included a full-width grille and hidden headlights.

1970–1971
The 1970 model year Thunderbird continued with the same platform and many of the same parts and styling cues from the 1967 through 1969 models, such as the sequential turn signals incorporated into the full-width tail lamps. The most noticeable change was in the front grille, where a prominent projection somewhat resembling a bird&#x27;s beak was added on the centerline, in line with long, angular lines in the hood. The T-bird was offered in coupe or new models.

The 1971 Thunderbird was mostly a carry-over from the 1970 model as Ford prepared to release a new, larger Thunderbird for 1972. It was also the last year to offer a four-door.

===Sixth generation (1972–1976)===

The sixth generation of the Thunderbird debuted in the fall of 1971 as a 1972 model. With a wheelbase, an overall length of (growing to by 1974), and a curb weight of (over when equipped with an optional V8), it was the largest Thunderbird ever produced by Ford. It continued to share the assembly line with the Lincoln Continental Mark series, as it had since the debut of the Mark III in 1968. 

Matching the large size of the car were large engines, including the previous generation’s standard V8 and the optional V8, which became standard after 1973. Though offering two of the largest displacement V8 engines ever installed in a production vehicle by Ford, the car&#x27;s considerable weight combined with low power output caused by restrictive emissions technology resulted in modest performance. Fuel efficiency was corresponding poor.

The big Thunderbirds were initially popular, with sales peaking at over 87,000 units in 1973 in spite of the 1973 oil crisis, but sales had slumped to less than 43,000 by 1975. Sales had a small uptick to almost 53,000 units for 1976, but increasing fuel prices and ever more stringent federal emissions standards led to a downsized vehicle the following year.
===Seventh generation (1977–1979)===

Reflecting the rising demand for more fuel-efficient cars, the model year 1977 Thunderbird was shifted to the smaller wheelbase chassis shared with the 1972–76 Ford Torino and its replacement, the LTD II, which also debuted for 1977. At only 1.2 inches shorter (217.7 vs 218.9) than the 1973-1976 models of the sixth generation, it still looked large to the eye, and was. As a continuation of the 1974–1976 Ford Elite, this generation Thunderbird represented Ford&#x27;s effort to compete in the high-volume second-tier personal luxury car market occupied by the Pontiac Grand Prix and Chevrolet Monte Carlo.

Along with being shorter, the car was lighter, although height and width were relatively unchanged. A substantial component of the weight reduction was in the drivetrain, where a small-block V8 replaced the big-block V8s of previous years. The standard engine outside California was the Windsor V8, while the larger 351M and  and T-tops were available as options along with the 351W. In California, the 351 was the standard engine, and the 400 was optionally available. For the first time, a wide, fixed &quot;B&quot; pillar was used, reflecting Detroit&#x27;s discontinuation of the pillarless hardtop body designs. However, the door window glass remained frameless.

In 1978, Ford offered the &quot;Diamond Jubilee Edition&quot; to commemorate the company&#x27;s 75th year as an auto manufacturer. This option package virtually doubled the standard price of the car to almost US$12,000. It included every option available except for a moonroof and engine block heater. A similar &quot;Heritage&quot; option package was available for 1979. Though this generation was the most successful ever, with over 955,000 units produced in its three-year run, ongoing fuel-efficiency and emissions concerns caused Ford to downsize the Thunderbird further for 1980.
===Eighth generation (1980–1982)===

Reflecting a further industry-wide adoption of smaller vehicle designs in the interest of improved fuel efficiency and emissions compliance, the Thunderbird was downsized again for 1980. Even more squarish, it rode on the compact Ford Fox platform, which had first appeared only two years prior as the basis for the Ford Fairmont. Compared to the previous Torino-based Thunderbird&#x27;s large wheelbase and overall length, the new Thunderbird lost of wheelbase and in overall length.

Frameless door glass was discontinued in favor of a chrome-trimmed metal frame. The combination of a low-output Windsor V8 base engine and a C5 three-speed transmission with 2.26 rear gears resulted in dismal acceleration. The optional , Windsor V8, coupled with the optional AOD automatic overdrive transmission and optional 3.45 rear-end ratio, showed only moderate improvement. The heritage of the Thunderbird as a performance personal luxury car was completely lost.

Reinforcing this reality, a six-cylinder engine was made available for the first time in the Thunderbird&#x27;s history in 1981, the aptly named, thoroughly anemic, Thriftpower Six first introduced by the manufacturer in 1963.

For the 1982 model year, the straight-six was replaced with a more modern V6, the 3.8 L Essex, as the Thunderbird&#x27;s standard engine. The V8 was optional.

At 288,638 units produced between 1980 and 1982, the eighth generation of the Thunderbird had a sales average under 100,000 units a year. This, however, tapered off drastically after the first year, whereas the previous generation had achieved sales records for three consecutive years.

===Ninth generation (1983–1988)===

Seeking to reverse the sales slide of the 1980–1982 models and revitalize the Thunderbird&#x27;s appearance, Ford executed a significant redesign for 1983. Though still based on the Fox body, it featured a radically sleeker, more aerodynamic body and a slightly shorter wheelbase of . Power, however, remained limited, with the 3.8 L Essex V6 and the V8 being carried over from the previous generation. The 302 gained CFI electronic fuel injection in 1983, and the V6 in 1984 for US models, 1985 for Canadian models (which was in turn replaced by multipoint fuel injection on the V8 in 1986 and the V6 in 1988). All-new, and a Thunderbird first, was a turbocharged 2.3 L OHC four-cylinder engine featured in the 1983 Thunderbird Turbo Coupe. The engine initially was rated at , but by 1985, power was increased to . Another first was the availability of a five-speed manual transmission with the turbocharged four. In 1983, the higher trim model was the Heritage; this was renamed the Elan in 1984. Also, a Fila-branded model was introduced. In 1985, a special 30th Anniversary edition was available, with special Medium Regatta Blue Metallic paint, special graphics, and trim.

For 1987, the Thunderbird received a significant refresh, complete with new sheet metal and a revised front fascia with aerodynamic composite headlamps. Mechanically, the car was little changed. The V6 models carried over port fuel injection from 1986, while the Turbo Coupe&#x27;s turbocharged four-cylinder engine gained an intercooler, increasing output to and 240 lb of torque.

===Tenth generation (1989–1997)===
In late 1988, for the 1989 model year, a completely redesigned Thunderbird was introduced, along with the similar Mercury Cougar. The new Thunderbird was developed on Ford&#x27;s MN12 (mid-sized North American Project 12) platform, which had been in development since 1984. Featuring a 9-inch (229 mm) longer wheelbase than the previous-generation Thunderbird and a four-wheel independent suspension, the car offered better handling and ride quality.

Only two engines were originally available—naturally aspirated and supercharged versions of the Essex V6. The naturally aspirated standard engine produced , while the &quot;Super Coupe&quot; model received a supercharged and intercooled version rated at .

The 35th anniversary of the Thunderbird was released in 1989, for the 1990 model year. The Super Coupe was available with a black-and-silver two-tone paint Anniversary Edition with Anniversary floor mats, a car cover, a pen, a poster, and a few other anniversary collectible items.

A V8, marketed as the &quot;5.0&quot; was added in 1990, for the 1991 model year. Power ranged between the standard and supercharged versions of the 3.8 L V6. 

In 1993, the 1994 model year Thunderbird received a substantial refresh, including stylistic changes inside and out and mechanical enhancements. In particular, the small block V8 was replaced with Ford&#x27;s new Modular 4.6 L OHC V8. The Super Coupe&#x27;s supercharged V6 produced more power and torque.

===Eleventh generation (2002–2005)===

For model year 2002, after a five-year hiatus, the Thunderbird returned for its eleventh generation, returning to a two-passenger convertible body style. Along with its revived layout, the 2002 Thunderbird combined many design elements of the first generation with the minimalist styling of the third generation convertibles. A predominant feature of the removable hardtop was the circular window (from the 1956-1957 versions). 

The eleventh-generation Thunderbird uses the Ford DEW platform also used by the Lincoln LS sedan (and the Jaguar S-Type); the Ford Mustang is loosely based on it. Though sharing no body panels with its sedan counterparts, the Thunderbird shared some visible components with the LS (instrument panel, steering wheel, and other trim pieces). As with the LS V8, the Thunderbird was powered by a Jaguar DOHC 3.9 L AJ-30 V8, producing and of torque; the engine was paired with a Ford-designed 5R55N 5-speed automatic. For 2003, the AJ30 became the AJ35 following the addition of variable valve timing and electronic throttle control; output increased to and of torque. The 5-speed automatic received optional &quot;SelectShift&quot; manual shifting control. 

With sales dropping significantly after its first model year, Ford discontinued the eleventh-generation Thunderbird after the 2005 model year; the final vehicle was manufactured on July 1, 2005. As of current production, Ford has not returned the model line to sale in any form. 

==Convertible models==
Alongside the original two-seat Thunderbirds of 1955-1957, the Thunderbird was offered as a soft-top convertible from 1958 through 1966. The model shared its convertible top retraction mechanism with the Ford Skyliner retractable-hardtop convertible and would also be shared the 1960s Lincoln Continental convertible. When the top was stowed, the rear-hinged trunklid was raised in order for the forward edge of the trunklid to serve as a metal boot cover. Though the hydraulically-powered design reduced available trunk space, the metal top boot negated the need for a separate cover. Unlike hardtop models that used a conventional key-secured, forward-hinged design, the convertibles combined the trunk opening and closing within the convertible top operating system.

The Skyliner-derived design could present challenges for troubleshooting a convertible top malfunction. The system consists of solenoids, relays, limit switches, electric motors, and a hydraulic pump/reservoir, as well as several hydraulic directional valves and cylinders. While the hydraulic system is not often a cause for trouble, electrical relays are known to fail. Malfunction of any of the numerous relays, motors, or limit switches prevents the convertible system from completing the cycle.

For 1962 through 1964, the Ford offered convertible Thunderbirds with a rare &quot;Sports Roadster&quot; option, with a fiberglass tonneau cover over the rear seat offering the appearance of a two-seat car; the Sports Roadster packaged was sometimes combined with even rarer options including higher-performance engines and wire-spoke wheels. 

==NASCAR==

Thunderbirds first made inroads into NASCAR racing in the 1959 season. The combination of the second-generation body style and the newly available 430 CID V8 took drivers Curtis Turner, Johnny Beauchamp, &quot;Tiger&quot; Tom Pistone, and Cotton Owens to victory lane. In the 1960 season, most teams returned to using the conventional full-sized Ford body style, and the T-Bird made only sporadic appearances through the rest of the 1960s, with no additional wins.

Beginning in 1977, Thunderbird-bodied racecars replaced the Torino as Ford&#x27;s primary body style in NASCAR, starting a trend of luxury coupe-type body styles (eventually the 1981 Imperial would also be seen racing) being used as a sheet-metal source on the race track. Bobby Allison won 13 races with this car driving for owner Bud Moore in the 1977 through 1980 seasons, though the cars looked boxy and un-aerodynamic. During 1981–1997, the downsized and aerodynamically clean Thunderbirds were successful in NASCAR stock car racing before they were replaced by Taurus-based bodies in 1998. The 1983- through 1988-bodied exceeded 200 mph and in one case during a qualifying session set the record of the fastest lap in stock car history at 44.998 seconds with an average speed of at Talladega Superspeedway, a record that still stands. Bill Elliott and Davey Allison, in particular, were successful with the cars, with Elliott winning the 1988 championship. Alan Kulwicki also won the championship in 1992 in a car nicknamed &quot;Underbird&quot;, for his underdog status as a driver. The last time a Thunderbird was used in the Cup Series was when Billy Standridge failed to qualify for the 1999 Daytona 500.

<doc id="301005" wikidata="Q754941" url="?curid=301005" title="Marcionism">
<text>Marcionism was an early Christian dualistic belief system that originated with the teachings of Marcion of Sinope in Rome around 144 AD. Marcion was an early Christian theologian, evangelist, and an important figure in early Christianity. He was the son of a bishop of Sinope in Pontus. About the middle of the 2nd century (140–155) he traveled to Rome, where he joined the Syrian Gnostic Cerdo.

Marcion preached that the benevolent God of the Gospel who sent Jesus Christ into the world as the savior was the true Supreme Being, different and opposed to the malevolent Demiurge or creator god, identified with the Hebrew God of the Old Testament. He considered himself a follower of Paul the Apostle, whom he believed to have been the only true apostle of Jesus Christ.

Marcion&#x27;s canon, possibly the first Christian canon ever compiled, consisted of eleven books: a gospel, which was a shorter version of the Gospel of Luke, and ten Pauline epistles. Marcion&#x27;s canon rejected the entire Old Testament, along with all other epistles and gospels of what would become the 27-book New Testament canon, which during his life had yet to be compiled. Pauline epistles enjoy a prominent position in the Marcionite canon, since Paul was considered by Marcion to be Christ&#x27;s only true apostle.

Marcionism was denounced by its opponents as heresy and written against by the early Church Fathers – notably by Tertullian in his five-book treatise &quot;Adversus Marcionem&quot; (&quot;Against Marcion&quot;), in about 208. Marcion&#x27;s writings are lost, though they were widely read and numerous manuscripts must have existed. Even so, many scholars say it is possible to reconstruct and deduce a large part of ancient Marcionism through what later critics, especially Tertullian, said concerning Marcion.

==History==
According to Tertullian and other writers of early proto-orthodox Christianity, the movement known as Marcionism began with the teachings and excommunication of Marcion around 144. Marcion was reportedly a wealthy shipowner, the son of a bishop of Sinope of Pontus, Asia Minor. He arrived in Rome c. 140, soon after Bar Kokhba&#x27;s revolt. The organization continued in the East for some centuries later, particularly outside the Byzantine Empire in areas which later would be dominated by Manichaeism.

===Schism within Marcionism===
By the reign of emperor Commodus (180–192), Marcionism was divided into various opinions with various leaders; among whom was Apelles, whom Rhodo describes as: &quot;... priding himself on his manner of life and his age, acknowledges one principle, but says that the prophecies are from an opposing principle, being led to this view by the responses of a maiden by name Philumene, who was possessed by a demon&quot;. However, &quot;others, among whom were Potitus and Basilicus, held to two principles, as did Marcion himself. Others consider that there are not only two, but three natures. Of these, Syneros was the leader and chief.”

In early 3rd century, a splinter group of Marcionites was established by Prepon the Assyrian, who claimed the existence of an intermediate spiritual entity between the good and evil gods.

==Teachings==
The premise of Marcionism is that many of the teachings of Christ are incompatible with the actions of the God of the Old Testament. Focusing on the Pauline traditions of the Gospel, Marcion felt that all other conceptions of the Gospel, and especially any association with the Old Testament religion, was opposed to, and a backsliding from, the truth. He further regarded the arguments of Paul regarding law and gospel, wrath and grace, works and faith, flesh and spirit, sin and righteousness, death and life, as the essence of religious truth. He ascribed these aspects and characteristics as two principles, the righteous and wrathful God of the Old Testament, who is at the same time identical with the creator of the world, and a second God of the Gospel who is only love and mercy.

Marcionites held that the God of the Hebrew Bible was inconsistent, jealous, wrathful and genocidal, and that the material world he created was defective, a place of suffering; the God who made such a world is a bungling or malicious demiurge.

In Marcionite belief, Jesus was not a Jewish Messiah, but a spiritual entity that was sent by the Monad to reveal the truth about existence, thus allowing humanity to escape the earthly trap of the demiurge. Marcion called God &#x27;the Stranger God&#x27;, or &#x27;the Alien God&#x27; in some translations, as this deity had not had any previous interactions with the world, and was wholly unknown. See also the Unknown God of Hellenism and the Areopagus sermon.

Various popular sources count Marcion among the Gnostics, but as the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (3rd ed.)&quot; puts it, &quot;it is clear that he would have had little sympathy with their mythological speculations&quot; (p. 1034). In 1911 Henry Wace stated:

A primary difference between Marcionites and Gnostics was that the Gnostics based their theology on &quot;secret wisdom&quot; (as, for example, Valentinius who claimed to receive the &quot;secret wisdom&quot; from Theudas who received it direct from Paul) of which they claimed to be in possession, whereas Marcion based his theology on the contents of the Letters of Paul and the recorded sayings of Jesus—in other words, an argument from scripture, with Marcion defining what was and was not scripture. Also, the Christology of the Marcionites is thought to have been primarily Docetic, denying the human nature of Jesus. This may have been due to the unwillingness of Marcionites to believe that Jesus was the son of both God the Father and the demiurge. Scholars of Early Christianity disagree on whether to classify Marcion as a Gnostic: Adolf von Harnack does not classify Marcion as a Gnostic, whereas G. R. S. Mead does. Harnack argued that Marcion was not a Gnostic in the strict sense because Marcion rejected elaborate creation myths, and did not claim to have special revelation or secret knowledge. Mead claimed Marcionism makes certain points of contact with Gnosticism in its view that the creator of the material world is not the true deity, rejection of materialism and affirmation of a transcendent, purely good spiritual realm in opposition to the evil physical realm, the belief Jesus was sent by the &quot;True&quot; God to save humanity, the central role of Jesus in revealing the requirements of salvation, the belief Paul had a special place in the transmission of this &quot;wisdom&quot;, and its docetism. According to the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica article on Marcion:

Marcionism shows the influence of Hellenistic philosophy on Christianity, and presents a moral critique of the Old Testament from the standpoint of Platonism. According to Harnack, the sect may have led other Christians to introduce a formal statement of beliefs into their liturgy (see Creed) and to formulate a canon of authoritative Scripture of their own, thus eventually producing the current canon of the New Testament.

Marcion is believed to have imposed a severe morality on his followers, some of whom suffered in the persecutions. In particular, he refused to re-admit those who recanted their faith under Roman persecution; see also Lapsi (Christian).

==Marcionite canon==
Tertullian claimed Marcion was the first to separate the &quot;New Testament&quot; from the &quot;Old Testament&quot;. Marcion is said to have gathered scriptures from Jewish tradition, and juxtaposed these against the sayings and teachings of Jesus in a work entitled the &quot;Antithesis&quot;. Besides the &quot;Antithesis&quot;, the Testament of the Marcionites was also composed of a &quot;Gospel of Christ&quot; which was Marcion&#x27;s version of Luke, and that the Marcionites attributed to Paul, that was different in a number of ways from the version that is now regarded as canonical. It seems to have lacked all prophecies of Christ&#x27;s coming, as well as the Infancy account, the baptism, and the verses were more terse in general. It also included ten of the Pauline epistles, in the following order: Galatians, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Romans, 1 Thessalonians, 2 Thessalonians, Laodiceans, Colossians, Philemon, Philippians.

Marcion&#x27;s Apostolikon did not include the Pastoral epistles or the Epistle to the Hebrews. According to the Muratorian canon, it included a Marcionite pseudo-Paul&#x27;s epistle to the Alexandrians and an epistle to the Laodiceans. The contents of this Marcionite Epistle to the Laodiceans are unknown. Some scholars equate it with the Epistle to the Ephesians, because the latter originally did not contain the words &#x27;in Ephesus&#x27;, and because it is the only non-pastoral Pauline epistle missing from the Marcionite canon, suggesting Laodiceans was simply Ephesians under another name. The Epistle to the Alexandrians is not known from any other source; Marcion himself appears to have never mentioned it.

In bringing together these texts, Marcion redacted what is perhaps the first New Testament canon on record, which he called the Gospel and the Apostolikon, which reflects his belief in the writings of Jesus and the apostle Paul respectively. An English language reconstruction of the content of the Evangelion and Apostolikon attested in Patristic sources was published by Jason David BeDuhn in 2013.

The Prologues to the Pauline Epistles (which are not a part of the text, but short introductory sentences as one might find in modern study Bibles), found in several older Latin codices, are now widely believed to have been written by Marcion or one of his followers. Harnack makes the following claim:

Conversely, several early Latin codices contain Anti-Marcionite Prologues to the Gospels.

=== Comparison ===
==Reaction to Marcion by early Christians==

According to a remark by Origen (&quot;Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew&quot; 15.3), Marcion &quot;prohibited allegorical interpretations of the scripture&quot;. Tertullian disputed this in his treatise against Marcion.

Tertullian, along with Epiphanius of Salamis, also charged that Marcion set aside the gospels of Matthew, Mark and John, and used Luke alone. Tertullian cited Luke 6:43–45 (&quot;a good tree does not produce bad fruit&quot;) and Luke 5:36–38 (&quot;nobody tears a piece from a new garment to patch an old garment or puts new wine in old wineskins&quot;), in theorizing that Marcion set about to recover the authentic teachings of Jesus. Irenaeus claimed,

Tertullian also attacked this view in &quot;De Carne Christi&quot;.

Polycarp, according to Irenaus in his work, &quot;Adversus Haereses,&quot; had an encounter with Marcion:

Hippolytus reported that Marcion&#x27;s phantasmal (and Docetist) Christ was &quot;revealed as a man, though not a man&quot;, and did not really die on the cross. However, Ernest Evans, in editing this work, observes:

==Islamic accounts==
The Arabic name for Marcionism, &quot;marqiyūniyya&quot;, is attested to by several historical sources of the Islamic Golden Age which appear to reveal that a meager Marcionite community continued to exist in the Near East into the tenth century. For example, the Christian writer Thomas of Margā states that, at the end of the eighth century, the metropolitan of Gēlān and Daylam, Shuwḥālīshōʿ, travelled into the remote parts of his see, preaching &quot;among the pagans, Marcionites and Manichaeans.&quot; In a similar way, the tenth-century Muslim bibliographer Ibn al-Nadīm goes so far as to claim that the Marcionites are &quot;numerous in Khurāsān&quot; and that there &quot;they practice openly, like the Manichaeans.&quot; Although information about the Khorasanite Marcionites is not related in any other historical source, Ibn al-Nadīm nevertheless also quotes a &quot;reliable informant&quot; (&quot;thiḳa&quot;), &quot;whom he says had seen Marcionite books and who reported that their script resembled that of the Manichaeans.&quot;

Those medieval Muslim writers who specialized in the study of foreign religions often presented Marcionite theology accurately. For example, al-Masʿūdī (d. 956) states that the Marcionites taught &quot;two principles, good and evil, and justice is a third (principle) between the two,&quot; which, according to de Blois, are clear references to the Marcionite belief in &quot;the good god, evil matter, and the just god.&quot; In the majority of cases, the Islamic references to Marcionism are really references to what has been termed &quot;Neo-Marcionism,&quot; a sub-branch of the sect that seems to have lived in Khorasan in the tenth century. The classical Muslim thinkers rejected all types of Marcionite theology as deviations from the truth, and some thinkers, such as Ibn al-Malāḥimī (d. c. 1050) wrote polemics against them as others did against Nicene Christianity. This did not, however, prevent many of the same thinkers from studying the Marcionites from an anthropological or sociological point of view, as is evident from Ibn al-Malāḥimī&#x27;s extended reference to the customs of the Marcionites.

==Further scholarship==

In &quot;Lost Christianities&quot;, Bart Ehrman contrasts the Marcionites with the Ebionites as polar ends of a spectrum with regard to the Old Testament. Ehrman acknowledges that many of Marcion&#x27;s ideas are very close to what is currently known as &quot;Gnosticism&quot;, especially his rejection of the Jewish God, his rejection of the Old Testament, and his rejection of the material world, and his elevation of Paul as the primary apostle. There were early Christian groups, such as the Ebionites, which did not accept Paul&#x27;s writings as a part of their canon. Ehrman asserts that Marcion likely &quot;hated Jews and everything Jewish&quot;.

Robert M. Price considers the Pauline canon a single collection of epistles despite the problem which is caused by a lack of knowledge as to how they were collected, when they were collected, who collected them and sent copies of them to the various churches. Price has investigated several historical scenarios and reached the conclusion that Marcion was the first person in recorded history who is known to have collected Paul&#x27;s writings and sent copies of them to various churches together as a canon. He summarizes,

David Trobisch argues that the evidence which is revealed by comparison of the oldest manuscripts of Paul’s letters proves that several epistles had previously been assembled as an anthology which was published separate from the New Testament, and as a whole, this anthology was then incorporated into the New Testament. Trobisch also argues that Paul was the assembler of his own letters for publication.

<text>The gunwale () is the top edge of the hull of a ship or boat.

Originally the structure was the &quot;gun wale&quot; on a sailing warship, a horizontal reinforcing band added at and above the level of a gun deck to offset the stresses created by firing artillery. Over time it remained as a valuable stiffener mounted inboard of the sheer strake on commercial and recreational craft. In modern boats, it is the top edge of the hull where there is usually some form of stiffening, often in the form of traditional wooden boat construction members called the &quot;inwale&quot; and &quot;outwale&quot;.

On a canoe, the gunwale is typically the widened edge at the top of its hull, reinforced with wood, plastic or aluminum, to carry the thwarts. 

On a narrowboat or canal boat, the gunwale is synonymous with the side deck—a narrow ledge running the full length of the craft.

<text>Mushroom hunting, mushrooming, mushroom picking, mushroom foraging, and similar terms describe the activity of gathering mushrooms in the wild. This is typically done for culinary use, although medicinal and psychotropic uses are also known. The practice is popular throughout most of Eurasia and Australia, as well as in temperate regions of Canada and the United States.

== Identifying mushrooms ==
Morphological characteristics of the caps of mushrooms are essential for correct visual mushroom identification. Numerous field guides on mushrooms are available and recommended to help distinguish between safe and edible mushrooms, and the many poisonous or inedible species.

A common mushroom identification technique is the spore print, in which a mushroom is placed on a surface and spores are allowed to fall underneath. This technique is often used by mycologists and mushroom hunters distinguish identify the genus of a specimen and differentiate between similar-looking species.

Knowing where and when to search for mushrooms is an important identification skill that takes practice. Most mushroom species require specific conditions. For example, some species only grow at the base of a certain type of tree. Finding a desired species known to grow in a certain particular region can be challenging.
=== Difficult-to-distinguish species ===

The term &quot;little brown mushroom&quot; (LBM) refers to any of a large number of small, dull-coloured agaric species, with few uniquely distinguishing characteristics. As a result, LBMs typically range from difficult to impossible for mushroom hunters to identify. Experienced mushroom hunters may discern more subtle identifying traits that help narrow the mushroom down to a particular genus or group of species, but exact identification of LBMs often requires close examination of microscopic characteristics plus a certain degree of familiarity or specialization in that particular group.

Additionally, &quot;Boring ubiquitous mushroom&quot; (BUM) describes groups of difficult to identify larger agarics, many of which are in the genus &quot;Hebeloma&quot;. &quot;Just another Russula&quot; (JAR) can refer to any species of &quot;Russula&quot; that is common or difficult to identify. &quot;Yet another Mycena&quot; (YAM) describes any of the many &quot;Mycena&quot; species that are common, nondescript, or difficult to identify.

== Regional importance ==
Mushroom hunting is popular throughout most of Europe, Asia and Australia, as well as in temperate regions of Canada and the United States.
*British enthusiasts enjoy an extended average picking season of 75 days compared to just 33 in the 1950s.
*In Japan, particular mushroom types are hunted, with particular importance given to delicacies such as the Matsutake mushroom.
*In Slavic countries and Baltic countries, mushroom picking is a common family activity. “The Russians go absolutely bananas for fungus. Mushrooming is a commonplace tradition there, not the hallowed turf of the academic or connoisseur.” After a heavy rain during the mushroom season whole families often venture into the nearest forest, picking bucketfuls of mushrooms, which are cooked and eaten for dinner upon return (most often in omelettes with eggs or fried in butter) or alternatively dried or marinated for later consumption. In Southern Lithuania mushroom hunting is considered a &quot;national sport&quot;. They even host a Mushroom Festival (&quot;Grybų šventė&quot;) in Varėna including a mushroom hunting championship.
*In the U.S., mushroom picking is popular in the Appalachian area and on the west coast from San Francisco Bay northward, in northern California, Oregon and Washington, and in many other regions.

=== Radiation ===
Nuclear fallout from the Chernobyl disaster is an important issue concerning mushroom picking in Europe. Due to the wide spread of their mycelium, mushrooms tend to accumulate more radioactive caesium-137 than surrounding soil and other organisms. State agencies (e.g. Bellesrad in Belarus) monitor and analyze the degree of radionuclide accumulation in various wild species of plants and animals. In particular, Bellesrad claims that Svinushka (&quot;Paxillus&quot; ssp.), Maslenok (&quot;Suillus&quot; ssp.), Mohovik (&quot;Xerocomus&quot; ssp.), and Horkushka (&quot;Lactarius rufus&quot;) are the worst ones in this respect. The safest one is Opyonok Osyenniy (&quot;Armillaria mellea&quot;). This is an issue not only in Poland, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia: the fallout also reached western Europe, and until recently the German government discouraged people gathering certain mushrooms.

<text>Stanley Tookie Williams III (December 29, 1953 – December 13, 2005) was an American gangster who co-founded and led the Crips gang in Los Angeles. He and Raymond Washington formed an alliance in 1971 that established the Crips as Los Angeles&#x27; first major African-American street gang. During the 1970s, Williams was the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Crips and the prominent crime boss in South Los Angeles.

Williams&#x27;s activities with the Crips ended in 1979 when he was arrested for the murder of four people during two robberies. Convicted of the murders in 1981 and sentenced to death, he spent over two decades on death row until he was executed by lethal injection in 2005. The highly publicized trial of Williams and extensive appeals for clemency sparked debate on the status of the death penalty in California.

== Early years ==
Williams was born on December 29, 1953, in Shreveport, Louisiana. He was christened Stanley Tookie Williams III but was usually called by his middle name Tookie (pronounced ). His father abandoned the family when Williams was one year old. In 1959, Williams moved with his mother, Louisiana Williams, to Los Angeles, California and settled in the city&#x27;s South Central area.

As Williams&#x27; mother worked several jobs to support them, Williams was a latchkey kid and often engaged in mischief on the streets. He recalled that, as a child, he would make some money from &quot;the hustlers&quot;: &quot;These hustlers would bet on just about anything—even who could spit, urinate, or throw a rock the farthest. I have witnessed cockfights, cricket fights, fish fights, and pay-per-view street fights among individuals between six and fifty years of age. Older hustlers would bet on children to fight&quot;.

Williams said that he was often paid a couple dollars after dogfights to take care of the injured dogs. Williams was also occasionally paid to participate in these street fights as a young man. 

By the time Williams was a teenager he had gained a reputation in South Central&#x27;s West Side as a vicious street fighter. Williams was expelled from George Washington Preparatory High School and denied entry by several other high schools in the South Central area because he was &quot;intimidating&quot;. 

Tookie was sent to Los Padrinos and then to Central Juvenile Hall for the first time after the formation of the Crips, charged with a robbery at Clifton&#x27;s restaurant which he denied participating in.

==Gang activity==
In the late 1960s, juvenile crime increased in South Central as older gangs disbanded to join the Black Power Movement, most notably as part of the Black Panther Party, initially to protect black people from police brutality and corruption in the Los Angeles Police Department. Increasingly violent youth gangs formed in their place, which Williams initially despised as predatory. Because of his viciousness and willingness to fight older youths, Williams earned the respect of many gangsters on the West Side. These gangs were mostly small-time neighborhood cliques that operated independently from each other and therefore leadership was not chosen but determined naturally. At age fifteen, Williams was invited into a small West Side clique after he befriended a local teenager, Donald &quot;Doc/Sweetback&quot; Archie. Williams soon earned the clique&#x27;s respect after beating up one of their members for insulting his mother. Williams became the unofficial leader of this clique as his violent reputation began to spread across South Central.

In 1969, aged 15, Williams was arrested in Inglewood for car theft and was sent to the Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Downey. While doing time at the detention center, Williams was introduced to Olympic weightlifting by the facility&#x27;s gym coach, which would spark an interest in bodybuilding. By his release from custody in early 1971, aged 17, Williams was physically bigger and stronger. According to Williams, upon his release from custody the review board asked him what he planned to do after being released, to which he replied &quot;being the leader of the biggest gang in the world.&quot;

Shortly after his release from prison, Williams was approached by Raymond Washington at Washington Preparatory High School after hearing of Williams through a mutual friend of both young men. The friend had informed Washington of Williams&#x27; toughness and his willingness to fight members of larger, more established street gangs such as the L.A. Brims and the Chain Gang. According to Williams&#x27; account of the meeting, what struck him about Washington was that, besides being incredibly muscular, he and his cohort were dressed similar to Williams and his clique, wearing leather jackets with starched Levi&#x27;s jeans and suspenders. Washington was from South Central&#x27;s East Side, where he was a prominent gangster similar to Williams, and proposed they use their influence in their respective regions to form the larger Crips street gang. The purpose for creating the gang initially was to eliminate all street gangs and create a &quot;bull force&quot; neighborhood watch in South Central. Williams said: &quot;We started out—at least my intent was to, in a sense, address all of the so-called neighboring gangs in the area and to put, in a sense—I thought &#x27;I can cleanse the neighborhood of all these, you know, marauding gangs.&#x27; But I was totally wrong. And eventually, we morphed into the monster we were addressing.&quot; 

Williams stated he founded the Crips not with the intention of eliminating other gangs, but to create a force powerful enough to protect local black people from racism, corruption and brutality at the hands of the police. At the time of the Crips&#x27; initial formation there were only three Crip sets: Washington&#x27;s East Side Crips (later called East Coast Crips), Williams&#x27; West Side Crips (later the Eight Tray Gangster Crips), and the Compton Crips, led by a teenager named Mac Thomas. Williams formed the West Side Crips using his own influence, having befriended many clique leaders and street thugs on the West Side. Washington, Williams and Thomas went on an aggressive and violent recruitment campaign throughout the black ghettos of Los Angeles, where they challenged the leaders of other gangs to one-on-one street fights. This process resulted in most gangs agreeing to join the Crips, and they were converted from small independent cliques into subgroups (&quot;sets&quot;) of a gang within the larger gang. The Crips quickly became the biggest street gang in South Central by both numbers and territory, however, numerous gangs still resisted losing their independence. These hold-out gangs formed a similar alliance to combat the Crips&#x27; influence, branding themselves as the Bloods, and would become their fiercest rivals. Williams&#x27; former rivals, the L.A. Brims and the Chain Gang, joined the Blood alliance and became The Brims and The Inglewood Family Bloods, respectively.

As leader of the West Side Crips, Williams became the archetype of the new wave of Los Angeles gang members that would engage in random acts of violence against rival gang members and innocent people alike. Williams and his best friend, Curtis &quot;Buddha&quot; Morrow, would noticeably participate in these activities, striking fear into both street criminals and the residents of South Central, Watts, Inglewood, and Compton. Williams&#x27; violent acts became legendary in southern Los Angeles&#x27; criminal underworld as on numerous occasions criminal charges brought against him ended in disarray, and prosecutors were unable to convict him due to lack of evidence.

== Crips leader ==

Soon after the foundation of the Crips, other leaders were either murdered or incarcerated and Williams became regarded as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader. In 1974, Raymond Washington was arrested for 2nd degree robbery and served two years in prison in Tracy. Raymond was soon murdered after his release from prison. On February 23, 1973, Curtis &quot;Buddha&quot; Morrow was shot to death in South Central following a petty argument. Mac Thomas was murdered under mysterious circumstances in the mid-1970s. Williams began to live an ironic double life in which he worked as an anti-gang youth counselor in Compton while also serving as the overboss for one of the largest gangs in Los Angeles. Williams would work as a counselor and study sociology at Compton College during working hours, then spend his free time participating in numerous violent attacks against the Bloods.

In 1976, Williams was wounded in a drive-by shooting while sitting on the porch of his house in Compton. The shooting was committed by members of the Bloods, who shot at Williams from their car as he was letting his dog out for a walk in the evening. Attempting to avoid getting hit, Williams dove to the ground from the porch, but was shot in both of his legs. Williams was told by doctors that he would never walk again, but after a nearly year-long process of physical rehabilitation and an intense workout regimen, he ultimately regained his ability to walk. After the shooting, Williams re-developed a substance abuse problem when he began smoking PCP. Williams had begun dabbling in street drugs around the age of twelve, and as a preteen befriended a neighborhood pimp who, in return for performing errands for him, would reward Williams with money and drugs, particularly Quaaludes, barbiturates (then known as &quot;Red Devils&quot;) or marijuana. Williams&#x27; personal life began to unravel: his maternal grandmother, with whom he was very close, died in 1976. He lost his counseling job in 1977 after being implicated in a robbery that was committed by two youths from a group home that Williams supervised. He was denied an opportunity to compete in an amateur bodybuilding contest after it was discovered that he was a gang leader (Williams would later appear on the popular 1970s NBC game show &quot;The Gong Show&quot;, performing a posedown routine). Eventually his gangster lifestyle was beginning to take a mental toll on him, which included a brief stay in the psychiatric ward of a hospital after Williams experienced a bad trip while high on PCP. With each of these setbacks Williams increasingly found himself using PCP and supported his drug habit by intimidating and robbing drug dealers in South Central.

==Murder convictions==

In 1981, Williams was convicted of four counts of murder committed in two of three separate incidents. Williams always maintained his innocence, though subsequent court reviews concluded that there was no compelling reason to grant a retrial.

The prosecution stated that Williams met with a man identified in court documents only as &quot;Darryl&quot; late on Tuesday evening, February 28, 1979. 

Williams introduced Darryl to friends of his, Alfred &quot;Blackie&quot; Coward and to Bernard &quot;Whitie&quot; Trudeau, and a short time after the initial meeting, Darryl, driving a brown station wagon and accompanied by Williams and Coward drove to the home of James Garret. Williams frequently stayed and kept some possessions at Garret&#x27;s home, including a 12-gauge shotgun, and after about 10 minutes inside, Williams returned with the shotgun. Williams, Darryl and Coward then went to the home of Tony Sims in Pomona, where they discussed possible locations to obtain money through robbery. 

Later, they went to another residence where Williams left the others and returned with a .22-caliber pistol, and placed it in the station wagon. Darryl and Williams entered the station wagon, Coward and Sims entered another vehicle, and then embarked on the freeway. Both vehicles exited the freeway at California State Route 72 (Whittier Boulevard). The first incident occurred at a nearby Stop-N-Go supermarket, where Darryl and Sims, at the request of Williams, entered the store with the apparent intention of robbing it. Darryl was carrying the .22 pistol that Williams had deposited in the station wagon earlier, and also had a rifle in the trunk of the car, along with two semi-automatic handguns. The clerk at the Stop-N-Go market, Johnny Garcia, had just finished mopping the floor when he observed a station wagon and the four men at the door to the market. Two of the men entered the market and one of the men went down an aisle, while the other approached Garcia asking for a cigarette. Garcia gave the man a cigarette and lit it for him. After approximately three to four minutes, the men left the market without carrying out the planned robbery.

The prosecution stated that next Coward and Sims followed Williams and Darryl to the 7-Eleven market located at 10437 Whittier Boulevard in Whittier. The store clerk, 26-year-old Albert Lewis Owens, was sweeping the store&#x27;s parking lot at 7:42 p.m. when Darryl and Sims entered the 7-Eleven. Owens put the broom and dustpan he was using on the hood of his car and entered the store to serve them, and was followed in by Williams and Coward. As Darryl and Sims walked to the counter area to take money from the cash register, Williams walked behind Owens, pulled the shotgun from under his jacket and told Owens to &quot;shut up and keep walking&quot;. 

While pointing the shotgun at Owens&#x27; back, Williams directed him to a back storage room and ordered him to lie down. Coward said that he next heard the sound of a round being chambered into the shotgun, then heard a shot and glass breaking, followed by two more shots. Williams had shot at a security monitor and then killed Owens, shooting him twice in the back at point-blank range as he lay prone on the storage room floor.

The next incident occurred at the Brookhaven Motel located at 10411 South Vermont Avenue in South Central Los Angeles, which was run by 76-year-old Yen-Yi Yang and his wife, 63-year old Tsai-Shai C. Yang, their daughter, 43-year-old Yu-Chin Yang Lin, and their son, Robert. The Yangs were immigrants from Taiwan, and Yu-Chin had recently joined them in the United States to run the hotel. According to the prosecutors, at approximately 5:00 a.m. on March 11, 1979, Williams entered the Brookhaven Motel lobby and then broke down the door that led to the private office. Inside the office, Williams shot Yen-Yi, Tsai-Shai, and Yu-Chin. All would die of the injuries they sustained. He then emptied the cash register and fled the scene. Robert, asleep with his wife in their bedroom at the motel, was awakened by the sound of somebody breaking down the door to the motel&#x27;s office. Shortly thereafter he heard a female scream, followed by gunshots. Robert entered the motel office and found that his mother, his sister, and his father had all been shot, and the cash register was empty. The forensic pathologist testified that Yen-Yi Yang suffered two close range shotgun wounds, one to his left arm and abdomen, and one to the lower left chest. Tsai-Shai also received two close range wounds, one to the tailbone, and the other to the front of the abdomen, entering at the navel. Yu-Chin Yang Lin was shot once in the upper left face area at a distance of a few feet. Witnesses testified that Williams referred to the victims in conversations with friends as &quot;Buddha-heads&quot;.

==Trial==
Williams was convicted in 1981 of all four murders with aggravating circumstances on each count of felony murder (robbery) as well as multiple murder in the case of the Brookhaven event. The jury also convicted him of robbery in both cases, and found that he personally used a firearm in the commission of the crimes. The jury returned a verdict of Guilty, and the judge sentenced him to death.

From the beginning of his sentence, Williams maintained his innocence regarding the four murders, alleging prosecutorial misconduct, exclusion of exculpatory evidence, ineffective assistance of counsel, biased jury selection, and the misuse of jailhouse and government informants. Williams claimed that the police found &quot;not a shred of tangible evidence, no fingerprints, no crime scenes of bloody boot prints. They didn&#x27;t match my boots, nor eyewitnesses. Even the shotgun shells found conveniently at each crime scene didn&#x27;t match the shotgun shells that I owned.&quot; However, the prosecution&#x27;s firearms expert, a sheriff&#x27;s deputy, testified during trial that the shotgun shell recovered from the Brookhaven Motel crime scene matched test shells from the shotgun owned by Stanley Williams. No second examiner verified his findings, and the defense claimed this expert&#x27;s methodology was &quot;junk science at best&quot;. Williams&#x27; gun was found in the home of a couple with whom he occasionally stayed. According to the District Attorney, the husband was undergoing sentencing for receiving stolen property and tried for extortion. Williams&#x27; lawyers have claimed that the District Attorney quashed a murder investigation in exchange for their testimony. The two shells recovered from the 7-Eleven crime scene were consistent with shells fired from this gun, with no exclusionary markings. The shell recovered from the Brookhaven Motel crime scene was conclusively matched to Williams&#x27; weapon &quot;to the exclusion of all other firearms.&quot;

Critics claim that although he renounced gangs and apologized for his role in co-founding the Crips, Williams continued to associate with Crips members in prison. However, when contacted about Williams&#x27; alleged ongoing gang activity, Los Angeles Police Department spokeswoman April Harding said there was no evidence of his gang leadership. Opponents also pointed out that he received a significant amount of money from outside sources. They stated that people who appreciate Williams&#x27; work sent him money. &quot;It&#x27;s as simple as that,&quot; said Williams&#x27; spokeswoman Barbara Becnel.

The prosecution had removed three black people from serving as jurors in Williams&#x27; trial. Williams&#x27; lawyers claimed that he was convicted by a jury that had no African-Americans, one Latino, one Filipino-American, and 10 White Americans. The District Attorney provided proof, however, in the form of a death certificate and the affidavit of another juror, that juror #12, William James McLurkin, was black. The defense responded that, contrary to the affidavit, McLurkin did not appear black. They maintain that the trial record indicates that &quot;none of the lawyers, and particularly the prosecutor, thought Mr. McLurkin was black&quot;, according to additional evidence in a November 2005 petition for clemency. According to the clemency petition, in his closing arguments, prosecuting District Attorney Robert Martin described Williams as a &quot;Bengal tiger in captivity in a zoo&quot; and said that the jury needed to imagine him in his natural &quot;habitat&quot;, which was like &quot;going into the back country, into the hinterlands.&quot; In a radio interview, Martin insisted that the analogy was not meant to be racial, and instead was a metaphor to the fact that Williams appeared in court dressed in business attire much like an animal in a zoo appears more docile than it would be in the wild. In the Court of Appeal summary of the case, Williams stated that various jurors misconstrued as a threat a question that he asked defense counsel at the close of the guilt phase. The trial record shows that after the jurors returned their guilty verdicts, Williams said, &quot;Sons of bitches&quot; in a voice sufficiently loud that the court reporter included it in the trial transcript. On the day that the jury began its penalty-phase deliberations, an alternate juror reported to the bailiff that he was going to get all of them. Three separate alternate jurors denied hearing Williams make such a comment to the judge.

Williams became inmate CDC# C29300 at San Quentin State Prison in northern California, and spent 6 years in solitary confinement in the late 1980s for multiple assaults on guards and fellow inmates. According to a classification report found on page 8 of filings by his lawyers during the clemency proceedings dated August 5, 2004, Williams had no violations since that time.

In October 1988, Williams was stabbed in the neck and seriously injured by Tiequon Cox in San Quentin State Prison.

==Appeals==
Williams appealed his conviction in the state courts and filed a petition in the federal courts for &quot;habeas corpus&quot; relief. The State courts affirmed the conviction, and the lower federal court denied the &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition. In 2001, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit heard Williams&#x27; appeal from the lower federal court, and the appellate court denied Williams&#x27; appeal in 2002, but noted that the federal courts were not his only forum for relief and that he could request clemency from the Governor of California. In late 2005, a campaign began to urge Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to grant clemency for Williams in consideration of his work as an anti-gang activist, with thousands of people signing online petitions calling for Schwarzenegger to commute the death sentence. In early November 2005, Williams&#x27; attorneys filed his formal petition for executive clemency, as well as a motion to obtain new evidence. (See below for the full text of the documents filed in these proceedings.) California opposed the clemency petition through the office of the Los Angeles County District Attorney, who along with the Los Angeles Police Department and other law enforcement groups, disputed that Williams had reformed. They stated that he refused to inform officials about other gang members or the tactics and communication methods that the gangs used, as Williams said he did not want to be a &quot;snitch&quot;. The clemency petition emphasized the theme of Williams&#x27; redemption and rehabilitation rather than his claim of actual innocence. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; writer Bob Egelko doubted this method, based on the courts handling the appeals, and quoted Austin Sarat, professor of law and politics at Amherst College and author of &quot;Mercy on Trial&quot;, a book about compassion: Sarat said that actual innocence is &quot;about the only ground in which governors grant clemency in the modern period... I know of no case in which a death row inmate has been spared (solely) based on post-conviction rehabilitation.&quot;

On December 8, 2005, Governor Schwarzenegger held a clemency hearing at a one-hour, closed-door meeting, where a crowd consisting of both supporters of Williams and proponents of capital punishment congregated outside the California State Capitol in Sacramento. Schwarzenegger described the decision whether to grant clemency as &quot;the toughest thing when you are governor, dealing with someone&#x27;s life.&quot; While the clemency petition was pending before the governor, Williams filed further appeals in the courts. On November 30, 2005, the California Supreme Court, in a 4–3 decision, refused to reopen Williams&#x27; case. On December 11, 2005, the California Supreme Court denied Williams&#x27; request for a stay of execution. Supporters of Williams also made another plea directly to Governor Schwarzenegger to stay the execution.

Also during this period, the media, community organizations, and relatives of the victims were speaking out. In mid-November 2005, talk show hosts John and Ken of &quot;the John and Ken Show&quot; on Clear Channel&#x27;s KFI radio in Los Angeles started a &quot;Tookie Must Die (For Killing Four Innocent People)&quot; hour on their show daily until the execution of Williams. During the hour, they interviewed advocates of both sides of the issue and expressed their support for the impending execution. Many anti-death penalty and civil rights organizations around the country organized activist campaigns to stop the execution, including the Campaign to End the Death Penalty, the NAACP, A.N.S.W.E.R., and others. Williams&#x27;s friend, co-author, and political collaborator, Barbara Becnel, helped to spearhead much of the organizing. Celebrities also joined to stop the execution, including Snoop Dogg, who appeared at a clemency rally wearing a shirt advertising the Save Tookie website and performed a song he had written for Williams. Jamie Foxx, noting that Williams&#x27; execution date was his birthday, publicly stated that the only birthday present he wanted was clemency for Williams. Other prisoners were also involved in activism to save Williams&#x27;s life, including Tony Ford, whose death sentence in a disputed case was indefinitely stayed, who helped organize a prison strike in Texas protesting the execution. On November 29, 2005, the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California announced that more than 175,000 Californians had signed a petition requesting the temporary suspension of executions in California until the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice could complete its study, due for December 31, 2007. The &quot;California Moratorium on Executions Act&quot;, A.B.1121, was scheduled to have its first hearing in January 2006. Press conferences and rallies in more than a dozen California cities called for a halt to all executions. They asked Governor Schwarzenegger to commute Williams&#x27; death sentence to life without parole.

On December 8, 2005, Lora Owens, the stepmother of Albert Owens, made a statement expressing her opinion of Stanley Williams: &quot;I think he [Williams] is the same cold-blooded killer that he was then and he would be now if he had the opportunity again.&quot; Owens&#x27; two daughters, who were 8 and 5 years old when their father was murdered, also opposed clemency and recalled that they were shocked when they had learned that their father&#x27;s murderer was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. By contrast, on December 9, 2005, Linda Owens, Albert Owens&#x27; widow, stated support of Williams&#x27; efforts to bring an end to gang violence and his call for peace between gangs: &quot;I, Linda Owens want to build upon Mr. Williams&#x27; peace initiative. I invite Mr. Williams to join me in sending a message to all communities that we should all unite in peace. This position of peace would honor my husband&#x27;s memory and Mr. Williams&#x27; work.&quot;

On December 12, 2005, Governor Schwarzenegger denied clemency for Williams. In his denial, Governor Schwarzenegger cited the following:
*&quot;The possible irregularities in Williams&#x27; trial have been thoroughly and carefully reviewed by the courts, and there is no reason to disturb the judicial decisions that uphold the jury&#x27;s decisions that he is guilty of these four murders and should pay with his life.&quot;
*The basis of his request for clemency is the &quot;personal redemption Stanley Williams has experienced and the positive impact of the message he sends,&quot; yet &quot;it is impossible to separate Williams&#x27; claim of innocence from his claim of redemption.&quot;
*&quot;Cumulatively, the evidence demonstrating Williams is guilty of these murders is strong and compelling … there is no reason to second guess the jury&#x27;s decision of guilt or raise significant doubts or serious reservations about Williams&#x27; convictions and death sentence.&quot;
*&quot;Williams has written books that instruct readers to avoid the gang lifestyle and to stay out of prison … [h]e has also … tried to preach a message of gang avoidance and peacemaking … [i]t is hard to assess the effect of such efforts in concrete terms, but the continued pervasiveness of gang violence leads one to question the efficacy of Williams&#x27; message.&quot;
*&quot;The dedication of Williams&#x27; book &quot;Life in Prison&quot; casts significant doubt on his redemption... the mix of individuals on [the dedication] list is curious … [b]ut the inclusion of George Jackson on the list defies reason and is a significant indicator that Williams is not reformed and that he still sees violence and lawlessness as a legitimate means to address societal problems.&quot;
*&quot;Is Williams&#x27; redemption complete and sincere, or is it just a hollow promise? Stanley Williams insists he is innocent, and that he will not and should not apologize or otherwise atone for the murders of the four victims in this case. Without an apology and atonement for these senseless and brutal killings, there can be no redemption. In this case, the one thing that would be the clearest indication of complete remorse and full redemption is the one thing Williams will not do.&quot;

Governor Schwarzenegger summarized by basing his denial of clemency on the &quot;totality of circumstances&quot;. On the same day that Schwarzenegger denied Williams clemency, Jonathan Harris, a New York counsel with Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt &amp; Mosle LLP, filed a response summarizing new evidence of innocence. It included reference to an affidavit by Gordon Bradbury von Ellerman attesting to belief in Williams&#x27; innocence. Dated December 10, it states that he called the NAACP on December 8 after reading in the &quot;Daily Breeze&quot; that his cellmate, George Oglesby, had testified against Williams. He states that he had observed Oglesby receive police reports on Williams and others. Mr. Oglesby told Von Ellerman that he was using the documents to testify against Williams and others &quot;to gain a reduction or eliminate charges against him.&quot; Von Ellerman also observed Oglesby copying from samples of Williams&#x27; handwriting to &quot;create incriminating documents that would appear to be written by Mr. Williams.&quot; Prosecutors had cited handwritten notes written by Williams about an escape plan that involved the killing of a bus driver and another accomplice.

==Execution==

On December 13, 2005, sixteen days away from his 52nd birthday, after exhausting all forms of appeal, Williams was executed by lethal injection at San Quentin State Prison. &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported thousands of protesters outside, most of whom were seeking clemency for Williams. He was the 12th person to be executed by the state of California following the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court decision of &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot;. Williams provided no last words to the prison warden, but in an interview on WBAI Pacifica radio hours before the execution, he stated:

Witnesses described the mood in the execution chamber as somber, and Williams showed no resistance as he was led into the execution chamber. After Williams was strapped to the gurney, he struggled against the straps holding him down to look up at the press gallery behind him, and to exchange glances with his supporters. Williams&#x27;s advocate and editor Barbara Becnel was also a witness to his execution. In the epilogue of Williams&#x27;s reprinted memoir, &quot;Blue Rage, Black Redemption&quot;, Becnel reported that prior to Williams&#x27;s arrival in the death chamber, he had promised her that &quot;he would find a way to lift his head and smile at me at some point during his execution, no matter what was being done to him. And that is exactly what he did.&quot; Williams then rested his head on the gurney while medical technicians began inserting needles in his veins although CNN reported the staff had difficulty inserting the needles and the usually short process took almost 20 minutes. &quot;Contra Costa Times&quot; reporter John Simerman added, &quot;They had some trouble with the second I.V., which was in the left arm… Williams, at one point, grimaced or looked almost out of frustration…at the difficulty there…He had his glasses on the whole time. He kept them on, and he kept looking…&quot; With a look of frustration on his face, Williams angrily asked the technicians, &quot;You guys doing that right?&quot; A female guard whispered to him, and a second guard patted Williams&#x27;s shoulder as if to comfort him. Williams shed one silent tear but otherwise showed no emotion as he was executed. Members of Albert Owens&#x27; family who witnessed the execution were described as stony-faced; however, Lora Owens appeared very upset, according to MSNBC anchor Rita Cosby.

Kevin Fagan, a reporter for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, wrote a detailed description of the execution:

This is the sixth one I have seen here at San Quentin, and I have to say this was very different. The most notable thing was that Williams had supporters at the back of the room... Mrs. Becnel was among them, I understand. We could see them, and throughout the last part of the execution—or preparing him when he was still conscious, they gave what looked like black power salutes several times to him, one man and two women. And most strikingly at the end of the execution, as those three were heading out, they yelled, &#x27;The State of California just killed an innocent man!&#x27; which is the first time I ever heard any outburst in the death chamber there.

After Williams was pronounced dead at 12:35 a.m. PST (08:35 UTC), several reporters who witnessed the execution held a news conference.

==Funeral and aftermath==
Williams&#x27;s spokeswoman and co-author Barbara Becnel said shortly after Williams&#x27;s death that she is &quot;now on a mission&quot; to obtain justice for Stanley Tookie Williams. Williams directed Becnel to receive his body and Becnel began making the funeral arrangements.

Becnel reacted to Williams&#x27;s execution by saying, &quot;We are going to prove his innocence, and when we do, we are going to show that Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is, in fact, himself a cold blooded murderer.&quot;

Williams&#x27;s body was laid out for viewing on December 19, 2005, and drew 2,000 mourners. A memorial service was held in Los Angeles on December 20, 2005, where Becnel read his final wishes. Williams&#x27;s funeral filled the 1,500-seat Bethel AME Church and drew a wide variety of people from current gang members to celebrities and religious leaders. On June 25, 2006, Barbara Becnel and Williams&#x27; longtime friend, Shirley Neal, sprinkled his ashes into a lake in Thokoza Park in the city of Soweto, South Africa as Williams had wished.

At his funeral, the last words of Williams echoed from a tape played to mourners, whom he asked to spread a message to loved ones:


Rapper Snoop Dogg, himself a Crip, recited a poem to mourners about the execution:

In his birth nation of Austria, Schwarzenegger faced backlash over the execution on December 19 from left-wing councillors in Graz, who announced that they were seeking to strip him of his Austrian citizenship. Schwarzenegger sent a letter to Graz on December 19 demanding his name to be removed from a stadium that had borne his name since 1997. He also wrote that he was revoking his permission for Graz to use his name in any advertising campaigns that promote the city. On December 26, Schwarzenegger&#x27;s name was removed from the stadium.

==Personal life==
Williams-Taylor talked to her ex-husband by phone that day. &quot;He was great. He said he was at peace with himself and proud of his son&quot;, according to Leslie Fulbright, a staff writer for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. Travon is a married father who owns a home and works for a social services agency in the Los Angeles area, said Barbara Becnel, Stanley Williams&#x27; co-author.

Travon was the only family member who spoke at the funeral. He &quot;brought the church to its feet&quot; when he promised to teach Schwarzenegger about redemption. He said, &quot;I feel it&#x27;s my duty to go on a worldwide campaign to show that redemption is real,&quot; he said.

<text>Raymond Lee Washington (August 14, 1953August 9, 1979) was an American gangster, known as the founder of the Crips gang in Los Angeles. Washington formed the Crips as a minor street gang in the late 1960s in South Los Angeles, becoming a prominent local crime boss. In 1971, Washington formed an alliance with Stanley &quot;Tookie&quot; Williams, establishing the Crips as the first major African-American street gang in Los Angeles, and served as one of the co-leaders. In 1974, Washington was convicted of robbery and received a five-year prison sentence, during which his leadership and influence in the Crips declined.

On August 9, 1979, Raymond Washington was murdered in a drive-by shooting shortly after his release from prison.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Raymond Lee Washington was born in Los Angeles, California, on August 14, 1953, the youngest of four sons to Violet Samuel and Reginald Cecil Washington. His parents separated when he was two years old, and he was raised by his mother and stepfather. He grew up on East 76th Street, between Wadsworth Avenue and Central Avenues in Los Angeles&#x27; South Central. Washington had a half-brother, Derard S. Barton, from his mother&#x27;s second marriage. Although Raymond Lee Washington was raised mostly by his mother and stepfather, he was still as close as it was possible to be close to his father&#x27;s brother, Willard D. Washington, who worked for the United States Department of Interior as an analytical chemist from 1959-1968 and as a forensic chemist for the ATF from 1968-1990.

According to neighbors of Washington, he developed an affinity for fist-fighting as an adolescent, and was constantly in trouble with the Los Angeles Police Department for various offenses. Washington&#x27;s mother is quoted as saying, &quot;Raymond was a good kid when he was a boy. Raymond didn&#x27;t go out of his way to fight or do anything bad, but if someone came to him, he would protect himself. And he was well built. He tried to protect the community and keep the bad guys out. But after a while, every time I looked up, the police were coming to the house looking for Raymond.&quot; Some neighbors remembered Washington differently: Lorrie Griffin Moss, who resided across the street from Washington on E 76th Street, said, &quot;I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of good to say about Raymond. Raymond was a bully. A muscular bully. He wouldn&#x27;t let anybody from outside our neighborhood bother us. He would bother us. Raymond could be very mean.&quot; A friend stated that Washington was a good football player, but never participated as a member of school sports team due to his poor grades. Washington was repeatedly expelled from schools resulting in frequent transfers, attending Locke High School, John C. Fremont High School, an alternative school attached to Washington Preparatory High School, and Fairfax High School in the Fairfax District near West Hollywood.

===Gang involvement===
In the late 1960s, there was an increase in youth crime in Los Angeles, particularly in and around South Central&#x27;s Watts neighborhood. Crime was especially prevalent in the three housing projects located in Watts, known as &quot;the Bricks&quot;: Imperial Courts, Nickerson Gardens, and Jordan Downs, where violent street robberies were common among adolescent criminals. Older African-American street gangs in South Central, like the Slausons, the Businessmen, and the Gladiators, had been ended by activist groups such as the Black Panther Party and the US Organization. The absence of the old gangs saw numerous new youth gangs begin to form in their place, including the Sportsmans Park, New House Boys, Acey Ducey, and Chain Gang, on West Side.

Washington, a native of the East Side in his early teens during the rise of the gangs, joined a local street gang called The Avenues, led by another teenager named Craig Munson. At age 15, Washington beat up Munson&#x27;s younger brother in a fist fight after discovering Munson had put a gun to his older brother, Reggie Washington. After the fight, Washington and one of his other older brothers, Ronald Joe, confronted Munson on the corner of E 81st Street and Avalon Boulevard. According to former gang members who knew Washington at the time, he was subsequently beaten up by Craig Munson in retaliation for his younger brother&#x27;s beating, and Washington left The Avenues. In late 1969, Washington organized his own gang called the Baby Avenues, recruiting a group of other neighborhood youths in South Central. The Baby Avenues wanted to emulate a gang of older youths called The Avenue Boys, which had been active since 1964 on Central Avenue.

====Unification of South Central gangs====

In 1971, Washington approached Stanley &quot;Tookie&quot; Williams, a similar gang leader from South Central&#x27;s West Side who used his reputation as a fist fighter to unite gangs under his control, at Washington Preparatory High School where both were attending. Washington had heard of Williams through a mutual friend, who had informed Washington of Williams&#x27; toughness and his willingness to fight members of larger, more established street gangs such as the L.A. Brims and the Chain Gang. According to Williams&#x27; account of the meeting, what struck him about Washington was that, besides being incredibly muscular, he and his cohort were dressed similar to Williams and his clique, wearing leather jackets with starched Levi&#x27;s jeans and suspenders. Washington proposed to Williams they form a confederation of the gangs under their influence in their respective areas along with another teenage gang leader called Mac Thomas in Compton, to form a single large street gang. The proposal would see Williams&#x27; gangs adopt the Crip branding and would be allied with other Crip gangs outside of the West Side, but would retain ultimate leadership in the East Side. Williams accepted Washington&#x27;s proposal, uniting the West Side gangs under his influence as the West Side Crips.

The Crips quickly established themselves as the largest street gang in Los Angeles, with increasing numbers and territory as their influence spread across low-income black neighborhoods. Washington, Williams and Thomas effectively held a monopoly on criminal activity in these areas, and became the dominant crime bosses. Street gangs that had resisted being absorbed into the Crips soon formed their own confederate alliance, the Bloods, to protect their independence and their interests in the criminal market. The founding of the Bloods sparked an instant rivalry between the new large gangs that saw a surge in violent crime in Los Angeles, as neighboring Crip and Blood sets began using increasing violence to fight over territory and personal feuds. With the rise of media coverage, which put these new violent gangs on the front page, soon many disaffected black youths were running to join the Crips, many without ever being contacted by gang leaders. One story at the time stated:

Within a few years, much of the original Crip leadership were either imprisoned or dead. On February 23, 1973, Curtis &quot;Buddha&quot; Morrow, a close friend of Tookie Williams and a high-ranking Crip enforcer, was shot to death in South Central following a petty argument. Mac Thomas was murdered under mysterious circumstances in the mid-1970s.

==Robbery conviction==
In 1974, 21-year-old Washington was arrested for second-degree robbery and sentenced to five years&#x27; imprisonment at the Deuel Vocational Institution in Tracy, becoming the first Crip to be incarcerated there. Washington was unpopular among the prison population as he began to recruit young African-American inmates into the Crips, much to the disapproval of established black prison groups like the Black Muslims and the Black Guerrilla Family. According to a former inmate who was housed at Deuel with Washington, the Black Muslims and the Black Guerrilla Family were aware of the spread of the Crips in Los Angeles, and warned Washington that they would not tolerate the formation of Crips in the prison. Washington faced another problem while serving time at Deuel: as the Crips murdered rival gang members on the streets of Los Angeles, inmates at Deuel who were relatives of victims held Washington responsible for their deaths. Greg &quot;Batman&quot; Davis, a friend of Washington and an original Crips member, stated &quot;People in the prisons was losing their loved ones on the streets and because Raymond was the founder of the Crips, they blamed him for it. And since Raymond was the only Crip up there (at Deuel) at the time, they were trying to kill him.&quot;

In 1976, Washington paroled from prison and returned to Los Angeles. Reportedly, Washington was shocked to discover that the violent war between the Crips, Bloods, and Hispanic gangs had escalated to the point that fighting using firearms, as opposed to fist fighting, was now normal. Over the next few months, Washington became disillusioned with the Crips as the gang committed more violent and senseless crimes, with new recruits seeking to build their reputations. Since Washington&#x27;s imprisonment, the organization had totally broken down into loosely-affiliated decentralized sets that often fought each other, as the Crips&#x27; original leadership had disappeared. Tookie Williams, the last remaining original Crips leader, served as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader during Washington&#x27;s imprisonment. Williams had been injured in a drive-by shooting in 1976, and developed a growing addiction to PCP that caused his authority to wane until he was arrested for four counts of homicide shortly before Washington was murdered. According to law enforcement, former gang members and close friends, Washington had decided that the Crips needed to be brought back under one umbrella organization to stop infighting, and then to work towards a truce with the Bloods. Upon realizing he no longer held influence in the gang, Washington started to distance himself from the Crips.

==Death==

Around 10:00 p.m. on Thursday, August 9, 1979, five days before his 26th birthday, Washington was murdered in a drive-by shooting on the corner of East 64th Street and South San Pedro Street in South Central Los Angeles, and was rushed to Morningside Hospital where he died while undergoing emergency surgery. No suspects have been arrested, and Washington&#x27;s murder remains unsolved. It was reported that Washington was hanging out on the corner when a car pulled up and the unidentified occupants called him over to the car. Washington&#x27;s associates, as well as the police, were aware he would never walk up to cars of people that he did not know, and most likely knew the occupants of the vehicle as he told an acquaintance that he knew them. Washington engaged in a brief conversation with them before the occupant in the passenger seat drew a sawed-off shotgun and shot him in the gastrointestinal tract and abdomen.

<text>Iliya Pavlov Naydenov (; August 6, 1960 – March 7, 2003) was a Bulgarian mobster. A banker, financier and philanthropist, he was the leader and founder of Multigroup organization and G-13. Throughout his career, he established close ties with members of the Committee for State Security(CSS) and founded Multigroup, an organization infamous for its nefarious activities such as money laundering, extortion, fraud, illegal car purchases and contract killings. Iliya Pavlov also played a critical role during the transition of Bulgaria from Socialism to Democracy by taking advantage of the privatization of the previously state-owned industries. His business conglomerates would buy up the enterprises at record-low prices and either sell them or let them go bankrupt. In this way, Pavlov managed to accumulate a great fortune and was even ranked the eighth richest man in Central and Eastern Europe by the Polish magazine Wprost in 2002. He was said to be worth $US1.5 billion. He was married to Darina Pavlova, who inherited his fortune after his murder.

==Death==
Pavlov was shot outside his office with a single bullet to the heart by a sniper and died instantly. The day before his death, he had testified in the trial of the accused murderers of Andrey Lukanov, Bulgaria&#x27;s first prime minister after the fall of communism who died in 1996. Pavlov had claimed that he had no conflict with Lukanov.

No one has been charged in Pavlov&#x27;s murder and while several possible theories have been put forth the motive is unknown. A previous attempt on Pavlov&#x27;s life was made in 1997 when a bomb destroyed his car. He was not in it at the time.

In 2010 Pavlov&#x27;s sister, Slavka Naydenova, and her 8-year-old son were murdered in Dale City, Virginia. A Russian-American woman who was the wife of Naydenova&#x27;s ex-husband pleaded guilty to the murders. The motive was jealousy.

==Sports career==
Pavlov was a former Bulgarian wrestling champion who graduated from the National Sports Academy in Sofia.

<doc id="301018" wikidata="Q881301" url="?curid=301018" title="David Pryor">
<text>David Hampton Pryor (August 29, 1934 – April 20, 2024) was an American politician who served as a representative for Arkansas&#x27;s 4th congressional district from 1966 until 1973 and as a senator from Arkansas from 1979 until 1997. A member of the Democratic Party, Pryor also served as the 39th Governor of Arkansas from 1975 to 1979 and was a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1960 to 1966. He served as the acting chairman of the Arkansas Democratic Party from 2008 to 2009, following Bill Gwatney&#x27;s assassination.

==Early life==
David Hampton Pryor was born in Camden, the seat of Ouachita County in southern Arkansas, to William Edgar Pryor and the former Susan Pryor (). Both had deep roots in Arkansas; the marriage &#x27;united two of the pioneer families of Arkansas&#x27;. William Pryor moved to Camden from Holly Springs in 1923 and started selling cars. By 1933, he had bought the partners out of the business and become sole owner of Edgar Pryor Inc, a well-known Chevrolet dealership in the area. The family was also involved in the civic, religious, and political life of Camden, with W.E. serving as Ouachita County Sheriff from 1939 to 1942.

Pryor was a third generation Ouachita County resident. He attended public schools in Camden, attended Henderson State Teacher&#x27;s College in Arkadelphia, and graduated from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville in 1957. Pryor was founder and publisher of the &quot;Ouachita Citizen&quot; from 1957 to 1960. He graduated from law school at the University of Arkansas in 1964 and was admitted to the bar that same year.

==Political career==
Pryor first won elected office representing Ouachita County in the Arkansas House of Representatives in 1960. Seated as a member of the 63rd Arkansas General Assembly, Pryor would win reelection to the seat in 1962 and 1964.

In 1966, Pryor was elected to Congress following a vacancy that year after U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed fellow Democrat Oren Harris to a federal judgeship. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1972, instead challenging longtime U.S. Senator John L. McLellan in the Democratic Primary. Pryor lost to McLellan in a runoff by less than 20,000 votes.

Pryor entered the 1974 Democratic Gubernatorial Primary when Governor Dale Bumpers declined a third term to successfully challenge Senator J. William Fulbright. Pryor narrowly avoided a runoff in the primary, defeating former governor Orval Faubus and Lt. Governor Bob C. Riley, then easily besting Arkansas Republican Party Executive Director Ken Coon in the General Election. Pryor was reelected in 1976, gaining 66 percent of the vote in the Democratic Primary against former Razorback football great Jim Lindsey, and 86 percent in November against a token Republican. He served as Governor of Arkansas from January 14, 1975 to January 3, 1979. Navigating a difficult economy from the 1974–76 recession, Pryor appointed banker and future governor Frank D. White as his economic development director.

He declined a third term in order to seek McLellan&#x27;s former seat in 1978 (the senator died in 1977) and faced two congressmen: Jim Guy Tucker and Ray Thornton in the Democratic Primary. Pryor advanced to a runoff with Tucker, and defeated the central Arkansas congressman by 12 points. He defeated a Republican and Independent opponents in the General Election with 76 percent of the vote.

In 1984, in spite of the Ronald Reagan landslide, Pryor defeated central Arkansas Congressman Ed Bethune in a race dominated by national GOP money backing Bethune. In 1990, Pryor defeated a write-in candidate; no other Democrat or Republican filed. He retired in 1996 and was replaced by Republican congressman Tim Hutchinson.

===U.S. Senate===
Pryor served as chairman of the Committee on Aging. Pryor was known for his advocacy for the aged and for promoting taxpayer rights. During his tenure, he was secretary of the Democratic Conference, third in the Senate Democratic Leadership.

In 2000 Pryor became Director of the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He served as dean of the Clinton School of Public Service in Little Rock from 2004 to 2006. In June 2006, President George W. Bush nominated Pryor to the board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and in September of that year he was confirmed by the Senate for a six-year term. As he had done occasionally in the past, Pryor taught a political science course at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville during the Fall 2008 term.

==Post-Senate career==
His son is former United States Senator Mark Pryor, a Democrat who held the same seat from 2003 until 2015.

In 2004, Pryor was one of the five-member board of directors of the Clinton Foundation.
Pryor briefly returned to politics, when he served as chairman of the Arkansas Democratic Party following the assassination of Bill Gwatney.

==Personal life==
In 1957, Pryor married Barbara Jean Lunsford, who at the time was a 19 year old freshman at the University of Arkansas. Unable to tolerate the stresses of public life, she briefly lived away from her family from 1975 to 1977, while her husband was governor. During that time, she took various university courses and had trouble finding a job, and she eventually moved back into the governor&#x27;s mansion after completing her rest.

Pryor had quadruple bypass surgery performed by Dr. Tamim Antaki at UAMS Medical Center on October 11, 2006. He had suffered a heart attack the previous day. His recovery was satisfactory and he was released from the hospital on October 17, 2006.

On July 13, 2020, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson announced at a press briefing about the COVID-19 pandemic in the state that Pryor and his wife Barbara tested positive for the disease with Pryor hospitalized at UAMS in Little Rock and his wife under home quarantine.

Pryor died at his home in Little Rock, on April 20, 2024, at the age of 89.

<doc id="301022" wikidata="Q889875" url="?curid=301022" title="Legio I Parthica">
<text>Legio I Parthica (Latin for &quot;1st Parthian Legion&quot;) was a legion of the Imperial Roman army founded in AD 197 by the emperor Septimius Severus (r. 193–211) for his forthcoming war against Parthia. The legion&#x27;s presence in the Middle East is recorded until the early 5th century.

The legions I, II, and III &quot;Parthica&quot; were levied by Septimius Severus for his campaign against the Parthian Empire. After the success of this campaign, with Septimus Severus capturing Mesopotamia (modern day Iraq), I and III &quot;Parthica&quot; remained in the region, in the camp of Singara (Sinjar, Iraq), in Mesopotamia, to prevent subsequent rebellions and to guard the eastern provinces from attacks from the Parthian Empire. II &quot;Parthica&quot; was transferred to the Alban mountain near Rome, where it served as Rome&#x27;s strategic reserve. 

It is likely the first &quot;Parthica&quot; took part in expeditions in the third century, including expedition led by Severus&#x27;s son, the emperor Caracalla, and the war waged by Severus Alexander against the Sasanian Persian empire. 

Legionaries from I &quot;Parthica&quot; were usually sent to other provinces, namely Lycia and Cyrenaica.

In 360, I &quot;Parthica&quot; unsuccessfully defended its camp against a Sasanid attack; after the defeat, the legion was moved to Nisibis (modern Turkey), where it remained until the city was surrendered by emperor Jovian to the Sassanid Persians in 363. After that, the legion was moved to Constantina, where it is last mentioned in the 5th century.

The legion emblem was the centaur.

<text>Silphium (also known as laserwort or laser; Ancient Greek: , ) is an unidentified plant that was used in classical antiquity as a seasoning, perfume, aphrodisiac, and medicine.

It was an essential item of trade from the ancient North African city of Cyrene, and was so critical to the Cyrenian economy that most of their coins bore a picture of the plant. The valuable product was the plant&#x27;s resin, called in Latin , lasarpicium or &quot;laser&quot; (the words &quot;Laserpitium&quot; and &quot;Laser&quot; were used by botanists to name genera of aromatic plants, but the silphium plant is not believed to belong to these genera).

The exact identity of silphium is unclear. It was claimed to have become extinct in Roman times. It is commonly believed to be a relative of giant fennel in the genus &quot;Ferula&quot;. The extant plant &quot;Thapsia gummifera&quot; has been suggested as another possibility. Another theory is that it was simply a high quality variety of asafoetida, a common spice in the Roman Empire. The two spices were considered the same by many Romans including the geographer Strabo.

Silphium was considered invaluable by all who held it. The BBC reports that the plant was sung about in Roman poems and songs, who considered it equivalent to its weight in gold. Historically, Pliny the Elder blamed silphium&#x27;s valuation on &quot;tax-farmers,&quot; and Julius Caesar directly registered silphium as &quot;1500 pounds of laser&quot; in the Roman treasury.

==Identity and extinction==

The identity of silphium is highly debated. Without a surviving sample, no genetic analysis can be made. It is generally considered to belong to the genus &quot;Ferula&quot;, as an extinct or living species. The currently extant plants &quot;Thapsia gummifera&quot;, &quot;Ferula tingitana&quot;, &quot;Ferula narthex&quot;, &quot;Ferula drudeana&quot;, and &quot;Thapsia garganica&quot; have been suggested as possible identities. &quot;Ferula drudeana&quot;, an endemic species found in Turkey, is a candidate for silphium based on similarity of appearance in descriptions and production of a spice-like gum-resin with supposedly similar properties to silphium. However, &quot;F. drudeana&quot; belongs to a lineage from the southern Caspian Sea region, with no known connection to Eastern Libya.

Theophrastus mentioned silphium as having thick roots covered in black bark, about one cubit (48 cm) long, with a hollow stalk, similar to fennel, and golden leaves, like celery.
The disappearance of silphium is considered the first extinction of a plant or animal species in recorded history. The cause of silphium&#x27;s supposed extinction is not entirely known but numerous factors are suggested. Silphium had a remarkably narrow native range, about , in the southern steppe of Cyrenaica (present-day eastern Libya). Overgrazing combined with overharvesting have long been cited as the primary factors that led to its extinction. However, recent research has challenged this notion, arguing instead that desertification in ancient Cyrenaica was the primary driver of silphium&#x27;s decline.

Another theory is that when Roman provincial governors took over power from Greek colonists, they over-farmed silphium and rendered the soil unable to yield the type that was said to be of such medicinal value. Theophrastus wrote in &quot;Enquiry into Plants&quot; that the type of &quot;Ferula&quot; specifically referred to as &quot;silphium&quot; was odd in that it could not be cultivated. He reports inconsistencies in the information he received about this, however. This could suggest the plant is similarly sensitive to soil chemistry as huckleberries which, when grown from seed, are devoid of fruit.

Similar to the soil theory, another theory holds that the plant was a hybrid, which often results in very desired traits in the first generation, but second-generation can yield very unpredictable outcomes. This could have resulted in plants without fruits, when planted from seeds, instead of asexually reproducing through their roots.

Pliny reported that the last known stalk of silphium found in Cyrenaica was given to Emperor Nero &quot;as a curiosity&quot;.

==Ancient medicine==
Many medical uses were ascribed to the plant. It was said that it could be used to treat cough, sore throat, fever, indigestion, aches and pains, warts, and all kinds of maladies.
Hippocrates wrote:
When the gut protrudes and will not remain in its place, scrape the finest and most compact silphium into small pieces and apply as a cataplasm.

The plant may also have functioned as a contraceptive and abortifacient.

==Culinary uses==

Silphium was used in Graeco-Roman cooking, notably in recipes presented in Apicius. Some historians have suggested that its use, particularly in the North African region of its origin, was extensive:Not quite as ubiquitous as liquamen, but just as necessary in the Roman kitchen, was the herb silphium...Life in Cyrenaica revolved around [silphium] to such an extent that the dramatist Antiphanes, in the fourth century BC, made one of his characters groan: &quot;I will not sail back to the place from which we were all carried away, for I want to say goodbye to all—horses, silphium, chariots, silphium stalks, steeple-chasers, silphium leaves, and silphium juice!&quot;Long after its claimed extinction, silphium continued to be mentioned in lists of aromatics copied one from another, until it makes perhaps its last appearance in the list of spices that the Carolingian cook should have at hand— (&quot;A short list of condiments that should be in the home&quot;)—by a certain &quot;Vinidarius&quot;, whose excerpts of &quot;Apicius&quot; survive in one 8th-century uncial manuscript. Vinidarius&#x27;s dates may not be much earlier.

==Hieroglyphs and symbols for silphium==
The Minoans probably used silphium as the visual reference for the hieroglyph &quot;psi&quot; (), meaning &quot;plant.&quot; It resembles a central shoot flanked by two stalks. Minoan fetishes with this geometry are known as psi and phi type figurines, and are also designed for their letter-like shape. This glyph developed into the modern greek psi (Ψ).

Egyptian hieroglyphs for Libyan silphium have also been documented in archeological publications as a balm ingredient that must be dehulled and which produces a sap. In one record, it appears similar to the hieroglyph for branch (𓆱) written to be read from left-to-right.
There has been some speculation about the connection between silphium and the traditional heart shape (♥). Silver coins from Cyrene of the 6th–5th centuries BCE bear a similar design, sometimes accompanied by a silphium plant, and is understood to represent its seed or fruit. Some plants in the family Apiaceae, such as &quot;Heracleum sphondylium&quot;, have heart-shaped indehiscent mericarps (a type of fruit).Contemporary writings help tie silphium to sexuality and love. Silphium appears in Pausanias&#x27; &quot;Description of Greece&quot; in a story of the Dioscuri staying at a house belonging to Phormion, a Spartan:

Silphium as &quot;laserpicium&quot; makes an appearance in a poem () of Catullus to his lover Lesbia (though others have suggested that the reference here is instead to silphium&#x27;s use as a treatment for mental illness, tying it to the &quot;madness of love&quot;).

==Heraldry==
In the Italian military heraldry, (&quot;Silphium of Cyrenaica, smoothly cut and printed in gold; in blazon: &quot;silphium or of Cyrenaica&quot;&quot;) is the symbol granted to units that distinguished themselves in the Western Desert Campaign in North Africa during World War II.

==In popular culture==
Characters in Lindsey Davis&#x27;s 1998 historical crime novel &quot;Two for the Lions&quot; travel from Rome to North Africa in search of Silphium.

<text>Legio XXX Ulpia Victrix (&quot;Trajan&#x27;s Victorious Thirtieth Legion&quot;) was a legion of the Imperial Roman army. Their emblems were the gods Neptune and Jupiter and the Capricorn. &quot;Ulpia&quot; is Trajan&#x27;s own &quot;gens&quot;, while the cognomen &quot;Victrix&quot; means &quot;victorious,&quot; and it was awarded after their valiant behaviour in the Dacian Wars. The legion was active until the disbandment of the Rhine frontier in the beginning of the 5th century.

== History ==
It was founded in AD 100 by the emperor Trajan for service in the Dacian Wars.

The legion&#x27;s first base camp was in the province of Dacia in the Danube frontier. It is likely that at least some of its legionaries took part in the Parthian campaigns of Trajan. In 122 they were moved to &quot;Colonia Ulpia Traiana&quot; (modern Xanten) in Germania Inferior, where they remained for the following centuries. Their main tasks were public construction and police affairs. 

In the 2nd century and the beginning of the 3rd century, units of the XXX &quot;Ulpia Victrix&quot; were allocated in Parthia, as well as Gaul, Mauretania and other Roman provinces, due to the peaceful situation in Germania Inferior. They fought in Antoninus Pious&#x27; campaigns in Mauritania.

In the civil war of 193, XXX &quot;Ulpia Victrix&quot; supported Septimius Severus, who granted them the title of Pia Fidelis (&quot;faithful and loyal&quot;).

The legion was used by Emperor Alexander Severus in his 235 campaign against the Sassanids. Later the legion would be involved in Alexander Severus&#x27; campaign on the Rhine Frontier. It was almost certainly involved in Gallienus&#x27;s wars against the Franks in the 250s. L. Petronius Taurus Volusianus was &quot;Primus Pilus&quot; of the legion at this time. It supported the Gallic Empire of Postumus (260–274) and suffered great losses when Aurelian overthrew Tetricus I in a bloody battle at the Catalaunian Fields in 274.

With the re-organization of the Roman Army (Constantius I Chlorus), the legions guarding the border lost their importance to the comitatus, the main, cavalry-based army behind the limes. The collapse of the Rhine frontier after 408–410 marked the end of the legion&#x27;s history.

<text>Legio XV Primigenia (Fortune&#x27;s Fifteenth Legion&quot;) was a legion of the Imperial Roman army. &quot;Primigena&quot; (&quot;firstborn&quot;) was one of the nicknames accorded to the Roman goddess Fortuna. &quot;Primigenia&quot; is an adjective, meaning &quot;of Primigena&quot;. 

It was originally levied by the emperor Caligula in 39 AD, to aid in the Germanic campaigns and was stationed in the Rhine frontier until 70, when it was destroyed during the Batavian rebellion.

== Deployment ==

After its initial campaigns (along the Rhine), XV &quot;Primigenia&quot; was stationed in Moguntiacum (Mainz). In 43, the redeployment of units following the Roman invasion of Britain leads the XV &quot;Primigenia&quot; to Xanten, in a camp shared with the V &quot;Alaude&quot;. In 47 both legions were involved in the war against the Frisians and in the construction of Corbulo&#x27;s canal in the Rhine.

During the Year of the Four Emperors (68–69), XV &quot;Primigenia&quot; and the other German border legions supported the claim of Vitellius to the throne, first against Galba and afterwards against Otho. When Vespasian was finally acclaimed undisputed emperor, the legions XV &quot;Primigenia&quot; and V &quot;Alaudae&quot; returned to Castra Vetera (Xanten camp), where the Batavian rebellion was already in progress. 

== Defeat ==

Both legions were besieged in their winter camp in 69 by a rebel army commanded by Civilis. They finally surrendered in 70 due to hunger and left the camp in orderly fashion under promises of safe conduct. However, the rebels chased the legions and killed the surviving legionaries.

<text>Daucus carota, whose common names include wild carrot, European wild carrot, bird&#x27;s nest, bishop&#x27;s lace, and Queen Anne&#x27;s lace (North America), is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to temperate regions of the Old World and was naturalized in the New World.

Domesticated carrots are cultivars of a subspecies, &quot;Daucus carota&quot; subsp. &quot;sativus&quot;.

==Description==


The wild carrot is a herbaceous, somewhat variable biennial plant that grows between tall, and is roughly hairy, with a stiff, solid stem. The leaves are tripinnate, finely divided and lacy, and overall triangular in shape. The leaves are long, bristly and alternate in a pinnate pattern that separates into thin segments. The flowers are small and dull white, clustered in flat, dense umbels. The umbels are terminal and about wide. They may be pink in bud and may have a reddish or purple flower (the &quot;ruby&quot;) in the centre of the umbel. The lower bracts are three-forked or pinnate, which distinguishes the plant from other white-flowered umbellifers. As the seeds develop, the umbel curls up at the edges, becomes more congested, and develops a concave surface. The fruits are small, dry, bumpy, oval and flattened, with short styles and hooked spines, as well as protective hairs surrounding it. The fruit has two mericarps, or bicarpellate. The endosperm of the fruit grows before the embryo. The dried umbels detach from the plant, becoming tumbleweeds. The function of the tiny red flower, coloured by anthocyanin, is to attract insects. The flowers bloom from May to September.

Similar in appearance to the deadly poison hemlock, &quot;D.carota&quot; is distinguished by a mix of tripinnate leaves, fine hairs on its solid green stems and on its leaves, a root that smells like carrots, and occasionally a single dark red flower in the center of the umbel. Hemlock is also different in tending to have purple mottling on its stems, which also lack the hairiness of the plain green Queen Anne&#x27;s lace (wild carrot) stems. Both plants have been spread into North America by European settlers and have become common wildflowers; &quot;Daucus carota&quot; is often known as Queen Anne&#x27;s lace there. Anne, Queen of Great Britain is the Queen Anne for whom the plant is named. It is so called because the inflorescence resembles lace, prominent in fine clothing of the day; the red flower in the center is said to represent a droplet of blood where Queen Anne pricked herself with a needle when she was making the lace.
===Function of the dark central floret===
The function of the central dark floret of &quot;D. carota&quot; has been subject to debate since Charles Darwin speculated that they are a vestigial trait. It has been suggested that they have the adaptive function of mimicking insects, thus either discouraging herbivory, or attracting pollinators by indicating the presence of food or opportunities for mating. One study in Portugal found that the dark florets contributed to visitation by the varied carpet beetle, &quot;Anthrenus verbasci&quot;, and that higher numbers of dark florets correlated with increased visitation, whereas inflorescences without dark florets had fewer visits. Replacing the dark florets with one or more freeze-killed &quot;A. verbasci,&quot; who are similar to the florets in size and shape produced similar results to those observations of inflorescences with intact florets.

== Taxonomy ==
The carrot was first officially described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 work &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;. In 2016, an international team sequenced the full genome of &quot;Daucus carota&quot;.

===Subspecies===
Cultivated carrot&#x27;s only parent is &quot;Daucus carota&quot;.

Both domestic and wild carrot are from the same species, &quot;Daucus carota&quot; L. There are several subspecies of &quot;D. carota&quot; that have evolved to different climates and atmospheres. Two examples of these subspecies are specifically from the Netherlands. &quot;D. carota&quot; subsp. &quot;sativus&quot; has roots that can be a wide range of colors. It has a thicker root and sweeter taste. The whorl of barbs above the spine on the vallecular ridges of the mericarp of &quot;D. carota&quot; subsp. &quot;sativus&quot; mature very well. &quot;D. carota&quot; subsp. &quot;carota&quot; has white roots that do not vary in color and, unlike &quot;D. carota&quot; subsp. &quot;sativus&quot;, has a thin root, bitter taste and are not edible. The middle umbellet of &quot;D. carota&quot; subsp. &quot;carota&quot; is not well developed (unlike in &quot;D. carota&quot; subsp. &quot;sativus&quot;) and the color of the flower can vary from red to deep purple.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Native to temperate regions of Europe and southwest Asia, the plant was spread to North America and Australia.

The plant is commonly found along roadsides and in unused fields. It thrives best in sun to partial shade.

== Toxicity ==
Skin contact with the foliage of &quot;Daucus carota&quot;, especially wet foliage, can cause skin irritation in some people. It may also have a mild effect on horses.

The compound falcarinol is naturally found in &quot;Daucus carota&quot; for protection against fungal diseases. Lab tests show the compound to be toxic to mice and the water flea &quot;Daphnia magna.&quot; Normal consumption of carrots has no toxic effect in humans.

== Uses ==
Like the cultivated carrot, the &quot;D. carota&quot; root is edible while young, but it quickly becomes too woody to consume. The flowers are sometimes battered and fried. The leaves and seeds are also edible.

&quot;D. carota&quot; bears a close resemblance to poison hemlock, and the leaves of the wild carrot may cause phytophotodermatitis, so caution should also be used when handling the plant. The seeds and flowers have been used as a supposed method of contraception and an abortifacient for centuries, but scientific research has not confirmed any such effects and there is no evidence of safety. If used as a dyestuff, the flowers give a creamy, off-white color.

&quot;D. carota&quot;, when freshly cut, will draw or change color depending on the color of the water in which it is held. This effect is only visible on the &quot;head&quot; or flower of the plant. Carnations also exhibit this effect. This occurrence is a popular science demonstration in grade school.

===Beneficial weed===
This beneficial weed can be used as a companion plant to crops. Like most members of the umbellifer family, it attracts wasps to its small flowers in its native land; however, where it has been introduced, it attracts very few wasps. In northeast Wisconsin, when introduced with blueberries it did succeed in attracting butterflies and wasps. This species is also documented to boost tomato plant production when kept nearby, and it can provide a microclimate of cooler, moister air for lettuce, when intercropped with it. However, the states of Iowa, Michigan, and Washington have listed it as a noxious weed, and it is considered a serious pest in pastures. It persists in the soil seed bank for two to five years.

===Taste===
Several different factors can cause the root of a carrot to have abnormal metabolites (notably 6-methoxymellin) that can cause a bitter taste in the roots. For example, carrots have a bitterer taste when grown in the presence of apples. Also, ethylene can easily produce stress, causing a bitter taste.

==Culture==
===History through artwork===
The history of &quot;Daucus carota&quot; and its cultivation in different parts of the world can be traced back through historical texts and artwork. Paintings from the 16th and 17th century, for example, that are of maids in a market or farmers&#x27; most recent crops can provide information on carrots&#x27; history. Studying such paintings shows that yellow or red roots were cultivated in Turkey, North Africa, and Spain. Orange roots were cultivated in 17th century Netherlands.

===References in poetry===
&quot;&quot; is the title and subject of a poem by William Carlos Williams published in the 1921 collection titled &quot;Sour Grapes.&quot;

<text>Joe Edward Purcell (July 29, 1923 – March 5, 1987) was an American politician and attorney who served as Acting Governor of Arkansas for six days in 1979. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 45th Attorney General of Arkansas from 1967 to 1971 and the 13th Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas from 1975 to 1981.

In 1974, Purcell was elected to the lieutenant governorship; he handily defeated Republican Leona Troxell of Rose Bud in White County, a former associate of the late Governor Winthrop Rockefeller. He was reelected as Arkansas Lieutenant Governor in 1976 and 1978 under David Pryor and Bill Clinton. He served as Acting Arkansas Governor for six days in 1979, having filled the unexpired term of Pryor, who had been elected to the United States Senate.

Purcell was twice a candidate for the governorship. In 1970, he was considered the leading challenger to former governor Orval Faubus and ran second to Faubus throughout the primary race, but was edged out of a runoff berth by less than 500 votes by Charleston attorney Dale Bumpers, who went on to defeat Faubus and then Republican Governor Winthrop Rockefeller in the general election. Purcell was Bumpers&#x27; choice to chair the Arkansas Democratic Party, a position which he held from 1970 to 1973. His chief task as party chair was to purge followers of presidential candidate George Wallace of Alabama and former gubernatorial nominee James D. Johnson from the party ranks and to limit the influence of the Faubus-era &quot;Old Guard&quot; faction. He entered the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 1982 and surprisingly edged out former congressman Jim Guy Tucker for a runoff berth with former governor Bill Clinton. Purcell lost the Democratic nomination to Clinton in a runoff, 46 to 54 percent.

<text>The Associated Press Stylebook (generally called the AP Stylebook), alternatively titled The Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law, is a style and usage guide for American English grammar created by American journalists working for or connected with the Associated Press journalism cooperative based in New York City. The &quot;Stylebook&quot; offers a basic reference to American English grammar, punctuation, and principles of reporting, including many definitions and rules for usage as well as styles for capitalization, abbreviation, spelling, and numerals.

The first publicly available edition of the book was published in 1953. The first modern edition was published in August 1977 by Lorenz Press. Afterwards, various paperback editions were published by different publishers, including, among others, Turtleback Books, Penguin&#x27;s Laurel Press, Pearson&#x27;s Addison-Wesley, and Hachette&#x27;s Perseus Books and Basic Books. Recent editions are released in several formats, including paperback and flat-lying spiral-bound editions, as well as a digital e-book edition and an online subscription version. Additionally, the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; also provides English grammar recommendations through social media, including Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, and Instagram.

From 1977 to 2005, more than two million copies of the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; have been sold worldwide, with that number climbing to 2.5 million by 2011. Writers in broadcasting, news, magazine publishing, marketing departments and public relations firms traditionally adopt and apply AP grammar and punctuation styles.

==Organization==
The &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; is organized into sections:

;Business Guidelines
:A reference section for reporters covering business and financial news including general knowledge of accounting, bankruptcy, mergers, and international bureaus. For instance, it includes explanations of five different chapters of bankruptcy.

;Sports Guidelines and Style
:Includes terminology, statistics, organization rules and guidelines commonly referenced by sports reporters, such as the correct way to spell and use basketball terminology like half-court pass, field goal and goal-tending.

;Guide to Punctuation 
:A specific guide on how to use punctuation in journalistic materials. This section includes rules regarding hyphens, commas, parentheses, and quotations.

;Briefing on Media Law
:An overview of legal issues and ethical expectations for those working in journalism, including the difference between slander and libel. Slander is spoken; libel is written.

;Photo Captions
:The simple formula of what to include when writing a photo caption, usually called a cutline in newspapers.

;Editing Marks
:A key with editing symbols to assist the journalist with the proofreading process.

;Digital Security
:A guide to protect journalists, their work, sources, online accounts, and avoid online harassment.

;Bibliography
:This provides second reference materials for information not included in the book. For example, it says to use &quot;Webster&#x27;s New World College Dictionary&quot; as a reference after the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; for spelling, style, usage and foreign geographic names.

==Title==
From 1909, when the first company-wide stylebook-like guide was released internally under the title: &quot;The Associate Press Rules Regulations and General Orders&quot;, and until 1953, the stylebook was published under different titles including, among others, &quot;Instructions for Correspondents of the Associated Press&quot;, &quot;The Associated Press. Regulations Traffic Department&quot;, &quot;A Guide for Filing Editors. The Associated Press&quot;, &quot;A Guide for Foreign Correspondents. The Associated Press&quot;, &quot;A Guide for Writers. The Associated Press&quot;, &quot;The AP Copy Book&quot;, and &quot;AP Writing Handbook&quot;.

By the end of WWII, pressures from a growing number of non-journalistic business sectors, already referencing copied or confiscated copies of the guide for years, greatly increased the stylebook&#x27;s demand. The first publicly available edition of &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; was published in 1953 under the title &quot;The Associated Press Style Book&quot;. Since 1953, the stylebook has been published under different titles, including &quot;Writing for The AP&quot;; &quot;AP Stylebook&quot;; and &quot;The Associated Press Stylebook and Libel Manual&quot;.

Some journalists have referred to &quot;The AP Stylebook&quot; as the &#x27;journalist bible&#x27;.

In 2000, the guide was renamed &quot;The Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law&quot; and the paperback edition has been published under this title since then. Some editions, such as the spiral-bound and e-book editions, use the shorter title &quot;The Associated Press Stylebook&quot; on their covers.

==History==
The Associated Press organization was first created in 1846. The first company-wide AP &quot;guide&quot; did not cover English grammar. It was more of a brochure with 24 pages of various titles and corporate structures of the Associated Press organization and was first published in 1900 under the title &quot;The Associated Press&quot;.

Although a formal English grammar style guide did not exist across the organization through the 1800s, individual bureaus were known to have maintained similar internal style guides as early as the late 1870s. The first corporate-wide style guide, with a complete reference to American English words and grammar, was released in 1909, under the title: &quot;The Associate Press Rules Regulations and General Orders&quot;.

By the early 1950s the publication was formalized into the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; and became the leading professional English grammar reference by most member and non-member news bureaus throughout the world. Due to growing demand by non-member journalists and writers working in public-facing corporate communications, the AP published their first official &quot;stylebook&quot; for the general public in 1953 under the title &quot;Associated Press Style Book&quot;; the first publication focused on &quot;where the wire set a specific style&quot;. For nearly a quarter century it assumed its reader had a &quot;solid grounding in language and a good reference library&quot; and thus omitted any guidelines in those broader areas. In 1977, prompted by AP Executive News Editor Lou Boccardi&#x27;s request for &quot;more of a reference work&quot;, the organization started expanding the book and in 1977 produced a book that was different in a few fundamental regards. Firstly, The structure was changed and entries were organized in alphabetical order so that users could find what they need in a timely manner. Secondly, in 1977 the book was published for the first time by a 3rd party publisher – Lorenz Press. Thirdly, in 1977, United Press International and AP cooperated to produce stylebooks for each organization based on revisions and guidelines jointly agreed to by editors of both &quot;UPI Stylebook&quot; (Bobby Ray Miller) and &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; (Howard Angione). In 1982, Eileen Alt Powell, a co-editor of &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; 1980 edition, stated that: 

In 1989, Norm Goldstein became the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; lead editor, a job he held until the 2007 edition. After publishing the final edition under his editorship, Goldstein commented on the future of the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot;″s section on name references: 

After Norm Goldstein stepped down as lead editor in 2007, in bibliographical records for all subsequent editions starting from 2008 lead editors&#x27; names are usually not explicitly called out and the author is simply referred to as &quot;Associated Press&quot; or &quot;AP Editors&quot;. In 2009 and 2011 the &quot;Stylebook&quot; was released as an app called &quot;AP Stylebook Mobile&quot; edition for iOS and BlackBerry, respectively, however it was later discontinued in 2015 in favor of users simply accessing the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; online edition through their desktop or mobile browsers. In March 2019 AP created an &quot;Archived AP Stylebooks&quot; section on its apstylebook.com website where anyone can access previous versions of the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; starting from 1900 &quot;brochure on AP corporate structure&quot; and all the way to 1977 edition.

The first Spanish AP stylebook was created in 2012, after requests from the AP Mexico City bureau and others to develop such a stylebook. The bureau at the time was looking for ways to expand into Latin America while bridging the language barrier. In 2013 the AP Spanish Stylebook came into fruition and is now available to everyone. The Spanish AP stylebook is also referred to as the &quot;Manual de Estilo&quot;.

The most recent print edition is the 2020–2022 &quot;AP Stylebook&quot;, available spiral-bound directly from AP, and as a perfect-bound paperback sold by Basic Books. Creation of &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; has been helmed by lead editor Paula Froke since 2016. In early 2023, the stylebook attracted attention for suggesting that &quot;the French&quot; could be an offensive term in a tweet promoting people-first language; there was considerable mockery of the suggestion, and the AP subsequently retracted it.

After American president Donald Trump issued Executive Order 14172 to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the &#x27;Gulf of America&#x27;, the Associated Press style recommended both names were to be used, as &quot;Mexico, as well as other countries and international bodies, do not have to recognize the name change&quot;, and &quot;the Gulf of Mexico has carried that name for more than 400 years. Following this, Associated Press journalists were prevented from covering several events in the White House, due to the news agency&#x27;s use of the &#x27;Gulf of Mexico&#x27; name. The White House then banned the Associated Press indefinitely from the Oval Office and Air Force One due to their reporting over the gulf&#x27;s name.

==Influence on American English==
The influence of the AP and similar news service styles has reached beyond the news writing community. Many other North American sectors disseminating information to the public began to adopt news styles as early as the late 1800s. Many other sectors now also have developed their own similar style guides and also continue to reference the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; for general American grammar, more than any other style guide available.

== Edition ==
=== Edition number: English edition ===
The first publicly available English edition of the book was released in 1953. However, all editions prior to 1977 are not included in the editions count and the first modern edition is considered to be the August 1977 edition released for the first time by Lorenz Press. The latest, 2020 version, is the 55th edition and can be used until 2022. The Associated Press has reduced the frequency in print publication due to the popularity of the online version of the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot;. The print version is expected to be available, unless otherwise stated, biennially.

=== Edition number: Spanish edition ===
Due to the rising influence of the Spanish language worldwide, in November 2012 Associated Press added, in addition to American English, its first ever Spanish edition of its stylebook. The Spanish edition is separate from the English edition and has a different website, as well as Twitter and Facebook accounts. Unlike the English edition which currently has both online and print versions, the Spanish edition only has an online edition. The Spanish edition does not have an &#x27;edition number&#x27; since it only exists as an online service.

==Revision process==
From 1980 to 1984 the English edition was updated biennially; then from 1985 to 2020, the English edition was updated annually, usually in May, at which time edits and new entries were added to keep the stylebook up to date with technological and cultural changes. As of the middle of 2024, the most recent edition is the 2024-2026 edition (57th edition).

In 2005, dozens of new or revised entries were added, including &quot;Sept. 11&quot;, &quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot;, &quot;FedEx&quot; and &quot;Midwest region&quot;.

In 2008, about 200 new or revised entries were added, including &quot;iPhone&quot;, &quot;anti-virus&quot;, &quot;outsourcing&quot;, &quot;podcast&quot;, &quot;text messaging&quot;, &quot;social networking&quot;, &quot;high-definition&quot; and &quot;Wikipedia&quot;.

In 2009, about 60 new or revised entries were added, including &quot;Twitter&quot;, &quot;baba ghanoush&quot; and &quot;texting&quot;.

In 2013, about 90 new or revised entries were added, including &quot;Benedictine&quot;, &quot;Grand Marnier&quot;, &quot;madeleine&quot; and &quot;upside-down cake&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Journalistic usage of &quot;illegal immigrant&quot; was no longer sanctioned. The use of ‘illegal’ to describe a person became regulated. The decision was part of a wider AP move away from labeling people. 

In 2018 AP Stylebook included a chapter on polling and surveys. Recommends the use of &quot;birthing people&quot;and &quot;pregnant people&quot;, which was clarified in 2022. 

In 2019, about 200 new or revised entries were added, including &quot;budtender&quot;, &quot;deepfake&quot; and &quot;cryptocurrency&quot;.
AP Style recommended removal of the hyphen in Asian-American, African-American, or Irish-American as common microaggression for more than a century. 

The 2020–2022 edition was released on May 21, 2020. About 90 new or revised technology-related entries were added, including &quot;internet privacy&quot;, &quot;digital wallet&quot; / &quot;mobile wallet&quot;, &quot;smart devices&quot;, and &quot;lidar&quot;. A new chapter was added about digital security for journalists. AP stylebook moved to capitalized Black and lowercase white.

The 2022–2024 edition includes more than 300 new and revised entries, including a new chapter on &quot;inclusive storytelling&quot;, &quot;where possible&quot; usage of &quot;they/them/their&quot; singular pronouns, revised guidance on the use of the term &quot;female&quot;, immigration and new entries for &quot;critical race theory&quot;, &quot;anti-vaxxer&quot;. A controversial change was referring to X as &quot;X, formerly known as Twitter&quot;. Cautions use of the word &quot;female&quot; in the context of describing women, as some people object to emphasizing biology and reproductive capacity.

The 2024–2026 edition includes a new criminal justice chapter.

<doc id="301055" wikidata="Q5179539" url="?curid=301055" title="Cowboy Mouth">
<text>Cowboy Mouth is an American band based in New Orleans, Louisiana known for fusing alternative rock with album-oriented rock, roots rock, and jam band influences. Formed in 1992, the band saw early mainstream success in the 1990s, including the hit single &quot;Jenny Says&quot;. After disappointing album sales in 2000, they were dropped by their label, but the band has succeeded since then by focusing on live performances and independent-label releases. In 2011, the band was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.

==History==
The band name &quot;Cowboy Mouth&quot; — taken from an early play by Sam Shepard and Patti Smith — usually means &quot;One with a loud and raucous voice&quot;. The nucleus of the band formed in the 1990s, and they have become a powerhouse live act whose performances have been likened to &quot;a religious experience&quot;.

After initially releasing independent albums, in 1996 Cowboy Mouth signed with MCA Records, who released &quot;Are You with Me?&quot;. &quot;Jenny Says&quot;, an existing song that the band re-recorded on &quot;Are You With Me?&quot;, was released as a single. &quot;Jenny Says&quot; reached #26 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart and #33 on the Billboard Alternative Rock chart, making it the band&#x27;s biggest hit. The band released additional records, but their label dropped them after 2000&#x27;s &quot;Easy&quot; failed to meet their label&#x27;s sales expectations. Undeterred by the lack of a major label, the band continued producing albums and releasing them through independent labels through the 2000s and to the present day.

Some of their most popular songs include &quot;Love Of My Life&quot;, &quot;Everybody Loves Jill&quot; (where the audience throws red spoons on stage), &quot;Easy,&quot; &quot;Disconnected&quot;, &quot;How Do You Tell Someone&quot;, and &quot;Jenny Says&quot;. They also perform a version of &quot;Born to Run&quot; on the &quot;Light of Day&quot; tribute album to Bruce Springsteen, a version of &quot;The Pusher&quot; on the soundtrack to &quot;Half Baked&quot;, and several of their own songs on the soundtrack to the 1995 film &quot;The Underneath&quot; (two of which they perform onscreen in the film). Their single &quot;This Much Fun&quot; from their 2006 album &quot;Voodoo Shoppe&quot; is featured in the trailer for the Disney animated feature &quot;Meet the Robinsons&quot;.

They maintain a very active touring schedule, primarily through the United States. The album &quot;Voodoo Shoppe&quot; is in part a tribute to city of New Orleans, Louisiana in the wake of the devastation of Hurricane Katrina — in particular, the tracks &quot;Home,&quot; a defiant vow to rebuild the city, and &quot;The Avenue&quot;, an emotional plea for the continued vibrance of the city. &quot;The Avenue&quot; features the lyrics &quot;Because the marching bands will roll/I&#x27;ll find my city in my soul/Because I plan on growing old on the avenue,&quot; a reference to watching Mardi Gras parades on New Orleans&#x27; famed St. Charles Avenue. A portion of the album was recorded with producer Mitch Allan and features engineers Stewart Cararas and Danny Kadar at their studio Paradigm Park Studios in New Orleans. Just seven months after the record&#x27;s completion the studio suffered the wrath of Hurricane Katrina. They performed &quot;The Avenue&quot; on Mardi Gras Day 2006 live on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;. The album also features the song &quot;Joe Strummer&quot;, a semi-tribute to the late Clash frontman. The band released its first full-length live DVD, &quot;The Name of the Band Is Cowboy Mouth&quot;, on November 20, 2007. The DVD, which was recorded in front of a packed house at the Roxy On Sunset in Hollywood, CA during the summer of 2007, features much of the band&#x27;s classic material like &quot;Light it on Fire&quot; as well as some songs to be released on the band&#x27;s new album, &quot;Fearless&quot;, in September 2008. Among the new songs of the DVD set, &quot;Kelly Ripa&quot; was released in a very different studio version as a single on iTunes in early March 2008 followed by an appearance and performance on the &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot; television show on March 13, 2008.

On May 14, 2011, during a performance at Bon Ton Louisianne in Houston, Texas, Cowboy Mouth was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame.

<text>The Henotikon ( or in English; Greek &quot;henōtikón&quot; &quot;act of union&quot;) was a christological document issued by Byzantine emperor Zeno in 482, in an unsuccessful attempt to reconcile the differences between the supporters of the Council of Chalcedon and the council&#x27;s opponents (Non-Chalcedonian Christians). It was followed by the Acacian schism.

== History ==
In 451, the Council of Chalcedon settled christological disputes by condemning both Monophysitism, held by Eutyches, and Nestorianism. However, large sections of the Eastern Roman Empire, especially in Egypt, but also in Palestine and Syria, held miaphysite views. In order to restore unity, the Patriarch of Constantinople, Acacius, devised an irenic formula, which Emperor Zeno promulgated without the approval of a synod of bishops. The &quot;Henotikon&quot; endorsed the condemnations of Eutyches and Nestorius made at Chalcedon and explicitly approved the twelve anathemas of Cyril of Alexandria, but avoided any definitive statement on whether Christ had one or two natures, attempting to appease both sides of the dispute.

This act failed to satisfy either side. All sides took offence at the Emperor openly dictating church doctrine, although the Patriarch of Antioch was pressured into subscribing to the &quot;Henotikon&quot;. When Patriarch John I of Alexandria refused, the Emperor had him expelled and instead recognized the Miaphysite Peter Mongos, who accepted the &quot;Henotikon&quot;. However, other miaphysites abandoned Mongos and were thenceforth called &quot;Akephaloi&quot; (headless ones), since they had lost their leader. After two years of prevarication and temporizing by Acacius, Pope Felix III of Rome condemned the act and excommunicated Acacius (484), although this was largely ignored in Constantinople, even after the death of Acacius in 489.

Zeno died in 491. His successor Anastasius I was sympathetic to the monophysites, and accepted the &quot;Henotikon&quot;. However, Anastasius&#x27;s position was at odds with the predominantly Chalcedonian population of Constantinople, and Vitalian, a Chalcedonian general, attempted to overthrow him in 514. Anastasius then attempted to heal the schism with Pope Hormisdas, but this failed when Anastasius refused to recognize the excommunication of the now deceased Acacius. Vitalian tried to overthrow the emperor a second time, but he was defeated by loyal officers.

The schism caused by the &quot;Henotikon&quot; was officially settled in 519 when Emperor Justin I recognized the excommunication of Acacius and reunited the Chalcedonian churches. However, the then-Patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch still embraced miaphysitism, and their churches came to be known in modern times as the Oriental Orthodox Churches. Meanwhile, the incident did nothing to mend the growing rift between the churches of Constantinople and Rome, which would lead in later centuries to the East-West Schism.

<text>White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) is a United States Army military testing area and firing range located in the US state of New Mexico. The range was originally established in 1941 as the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range, where the Trinity test site lay at the northern end of the Range, in Socorro County near the towns of Carrizozo and San Antonio. It then became the White Sands Proving Ground on 9July 1945. 

White Sands National Park founded in the 1930s is located within the range.

==Significant events==
*The missile range was originally established in 1941 as the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range.
*On 16 July 1945, the first atomic bomb (code named Trinity) was test detonated at Trinity Site near the northern boundary of the range, seven days after the White Sands Proving Ground was officially established, near the towns of Carrizozo and San Antonio. ().
*After the conclusion of World War II, 100 long-range German V-2 rockets that were captured by U.S. military troops were brought to WSMR. Of these, 67 were test-fired between 1946 and 1951 from the White Sands V-2 Launching Site. (This was followed by the testing of American rockets, which continues to this day, along with testing other technologies.)
* On 15 May, 1947, a V-2 rocket fired from WSMR veered off course and landed northeast of Alamogordo, New Mexico. 
* Exactly two weeks later, on May 29, 1947, a modified V-2 sounding rocket veered off course and crashed on top of a rocky knoll about south of the Juárez business district, leaving a deep by wide crater. 
* On 11 July 1970, the United States Air Force launched an Athena sounding rocket, equipped with re-entry vehicle V-123-D, from the Green River Launch Complex in Utah. While its intended target was inside of WSMR, the rocket instead flew south and impacted south of the Mexican border in the Mapimi Desert in the northeastern corner of the Mexican state of Durango.
*On 30 March 1982 NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle Columbia landed on the Northrop Strip at WSMR as the conclusion to mission STS-3. This was the only time that NASA used WSMR as a landing site for the space shuttle.

==Geography==

As the largest military installation in the United States, WSMR encompasses almost including parts of Doña Ana, Otero, Socorro, Sierra, and Lincoln counties in southern New Mexico. 

===Nearby military bases===
Holloman Air Force Base borders WSMR to the east; and WSMR borders the McGregor Range Complex at Fort Bliss to the south (southeast Tularosa Basin and on Otero Mesa) making them contiguous areas for military testing.

===Nearby cities===
WSMR is located between Las Cruces, New Mexico to the west, Alamogordo, New Mexico 40 miles to the east, and Chaparral, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas to the south.

===National park and wildlife refuge===
White Sands National Park and the San Andres National Wildlife Refuge are federally-protected natural areas contained within the borders of WSMR.

==Transportation==
===Major highways===
New Mexico State Road 213 enters the range from the south from Chaparral, New Mexico and terminates at U.S. Highway 70, which traverses the southern part of the range in a west-northeast direction and is subject to periodic road closures during test firings at the range. U.S. Highway 380 runs east-west along the northern edge of WSMR between San Antonio and Carrizozo, and is also subject to periodic closures during test firings. New Mexico State Road 525 provides access from U.S. Highway 380 to the north end of WSMR near Stallion Army Airfield.

===Nearby airports===
El Paso International Airport is the nearest airport with regularly scheduled commercial flights. There have been no regularly scheduled commercial passenger flights from Las Cruces International Airport since 25 July 2005, when Westward Airways ceased operations; general aviation, New Mexico Army National Guard (4 UH-72 Lakota Helicopters), private charters and CAP, among others, still use the airport. Regularly scheduled commercial flights are also available at the Albuquerque International Sunport, which is located 200 miles north of White Sands Missile Range&#x27;s main base, but is closer to the northern test ranges than El Paso.

==National Historic Landmarks==
On 21 December 1965, the Trinity Site, selected in November 1944 for the Trinity nuclear test conducted on 16 July 1945, was designated a National Historic Landmark district, and added to the National Register of Historic Places on 15 October 1966. 
*The White Sands V-2 Launching Site used for a V-2 static test firing on 15 March 1946, and for the first US V-2 launch on 16 April 1946, received landmark designation on 3 October 1985.

==Current operations==

The White Sands Test Center, headquartered at the WSMR post area, has branches for manned tactical systems and electromagnetic radiation, and conducts missile testing and range recovery operations. &quot;WSMR Main Post&quot; includes several smaller areas such as the housing area, golf course, &quot;Navy Area&quot;, and &quot;Technical Area&quot; The WSMR Museum offers tours and exhibits including a V-2 rocket returned in May 2004 after restoration. The White Sands Missile Range Hall of Fame inducts members such as the first range commander, Colonel Harold Turner (1945–1947), in 1980. A recreational shooting range just inside the &quot;El Paso gate&quot; on the south is outside of the Post Area.

The 1972 DoD Centers for Countermeasures (CCM) evaluates precision guided munitions and other devices in electronic counter- and counter-countermeasures environments. Other operations on WSMR land include the Launch Abort Flight Test Complex for the Pad Abort-1, the White Sands Launch Complex 37 built for Nike Hercules tests, the White Sands Launch Complex 38 built for Nike Zeus tests with Launch Control Building now used for Patriot missile firings, the North Oscura Peak facility of the Air Force Research Laboratory Directed Energy Directorate, and the 1963 NASA White Sands Test Facility&#x27;s ground station for Tracking and Data Relay Satellites, and the SDO ground station with two antennas.

<text>&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (), sometimes translated in English as &quot;The Little Sea Maid&quot;, is a fairy tale written by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen. Originally published in 1837 as part of a collection of fairy tales for children, the story follows the journey of a young mermaid princess who is willing to give up her life in the sea as a mermaid to gain a human soul.

The original story has been the subject of multiple analyses by scholars such as Jacob Bøggild and Pernille Heegaard, as well as the folklorist Maria Tatar. These analyses cover various aspects of the story, from interpreting the themes to discussing why Andersen chose to write a tragic story with a happy ending. It has been adapted to various media, including musical theatre, anime, ballet, opera, and film. There is also a statue portraying the mermaid in Copenhagen, Denmark, where the story was written and first published.

==Plot==
The Little Mermaid lives in an underwater kingdom with her father, the Sea King, her paternal grandmother, and her five older sisters, each one of them born a year apart. Fascinated by the world above the sea, and human beings, The Little Mermaid keeps a statue of a human boy in her garden in the palace.

When a mermaid turns fifteen, she is permitted to swim to the surface for the first time to catch a glimpse of the world above. When the six mermaids become old enough, each of them visits the upper world one at a time every year. As each returns, the Little Mermaid listens to their various descriptions of the world inhabited by human beings. The elder sisters soon become jaded of the world above and are content to remain below the sea.

When the Little Mermaid&#x27;s turn comes, she rises up to the surface, watches a birthday celebration being held on a ship in honor of a prince, and falls in love with him from a distance. A violent storm then hits, sinking the ship, and the Mermaid saves the prince from drowning. She delivers him unconscious to the shore near a temple. Here, the Mermaid waits until a young woman from the temple and her ladies-in-waiting find him. The prince never sees the Little Mermaid or even realizes that it was she who had originally saved his life.

The Mermaid asks her grandmother if humans can live forever. Her grandmother explains that humans have a much shorter lifespan than mermaids (around 300 years), but that they have an eternal soul that lives on in heaven, while mermaids turn to sea foam at death and cease to exist.

The Mermaid, longing for the prince and an eternal soul, visits the Sea Witch who lives in a dangerous part of the ocean, surrounded by a forest of polyps, mud, and whirlpools. The Witch helps her by offering a potion that gives her legs in exchange for her voice (her tongue), as the Mermaid has the most enchanting voice in the world. The Witch says that once the Mermaid becomes a human, she will never be able to return to the sea. Consuming the potion will make her feel as if a sword is being passed through her body. When she recovers, she will have human legs and will be able to dance as no human has ever danced before; however, the pain of losing her tail will never leave her: she will constantly feel as if she is walking on sharp knives, and her feet will bleed terribly. Moreover, she will obtain a soul only if she wins the prince&#x27;s love and marries him, for then a part of his soul will flow into her. Otherwise, at dawn on the first day after he marries someone else, the Mermaid will die with a broken heart and dissolve into sea foam upon the waves.

After agreeing to the arrangement, the Mermaid swims up to the surface near the prince&#x27;s castle and drinks the potion. The liquid feels like a sword piercing her body and she passes out on the shore, naked. She is found by the prince, who is mesmerized by her beauty and grace, soon discovers that she is mute. Most of all, he likes to see her dance, and she dances for him despite suffering excruciating pain with every step. Soon, the Mermaid becomes the prince&#x27;s favorite companion and accompanies him on many of his outings. He confides in her his deepest thoughts and feelings but does not fall in love with her.

When the prince&#x27;s parents encourage him to marry the neighboring princess in an arranged marriage, he tells the Mermaid that he will not because he does not love the princess. He goes on to say that he can only love the young woman from the temple, whom he believes rescued him. It turns out that the princess from the neighboring kingdom was the temple woman, as she was sent to the temple for her education. The prince declares his love for her, and the royal wedding is announced at once.

The marriage is celebrated aboard a wedding ship, and the Mermaid&#x27;s heart breaks. She despairs, thinking of the death that awaits her, but before dawn, her sisters rise out of the water and bring her a dagger that the Witch has given them in exchange for their beautiful hair. If the Mermaid kills the prince and lets his blood drip on her feet, she will become a mermaid once more, all her suffering will end, and she will live out her full life in the ocean with her family. However, the Mermaid cannot bring herself to kill the sleeping prince lying with the princess, and she throws the dagger and herself off the ship into the water just as dawn breaks.

Her body dissolves into foam, but instead of ceasing to exist, she turns into a luminous and ethereal earthbound spirit, a daughter of the air. While ascending into the atmosphere, she is greeted by other daughters, who say that she has become like them because she strove with all her heart to obtain an immortal soul.

Because of the Mermaid&#x27;s sacrifice, she is given a chance to do good deeds for all her lifespan. She will receive her soul and rise up into Heaven when her lifespan ends.

==Publication==
&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was written by Hans Christian Andersen in 1836 and first published by C.A. Reitzel in Copenhagen on 7 April 1837 in &quot;Fairy Tales Told for Children. First Collection.&quot; (), a collection of nine fairy tales by Hans Christian Andersen.

The story was republished on 18 December 1849 as a part of &quot;Fairy Tales. 1850&quot; (), and again on 15 December 1862 as a part of the first volume of &quot;Fairy Tales and Stories&quot; ().

==Critical response==

The ending with the mermaid&#x27;s death and resurrection caused debate and critique. On the fact that children are told that their good behavior will help the mermaid earn her soul more quickly, but their bad behavior will add days to her time of service, P. L. Travers, author of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; and noted folklore commentator, wrote, &quot;a year taken off when a child behaves; a tear shed and a day added whenever a child is naughty? Andersen, this is blackmail. And the children know it and say nothing. There&#x27;s magnanimity for you.&quot;

Other scholars like Jacob Bøggild and Pernille Heegaard notice the ending&#x27;s shift away from tragedy as well. They point out that the events leading up to the mermaid&#x27;s death should culminate in tragedy, but that the sudden twist allows the narrative to finish on a hopeful success. Bøggild and Heegaard argue that this disjointed ending was not the result of Andersen&#x27;s sentimentality and religious beliefs—to which have been attributed his choice to stray from the tragic path in the rest of the narrative. Rather, a conscious choice for ambiguity stemmed from Andersen&#x27;s skepticism towards idealized physical and religious symbols.

However, other critics including Søren Baggesen and James Massengale have argued that the ending is not tacked on, but is a natural part of the story&#x27;s structure as a religious narrative. The working title of the story was &quot;Daughters of the Air&quot;, which are spirits who, as Andersen conceived them, can earn souls by doing three hundred years&#x27; worth of good deeds. At the end of the story, one of these spirits explains to the Little Mermaid that they do as many good things for humankind as they are able so that, at the end of those years, they can receive an immortal soul and &quot;take part in the happiness of mankind&quot;. The spirits also explain that because the Little Mermaid refused to kill the Prince and has spent so much time in pain while still doing good things for men, she has &quot;raised [herself] to the spirit-world&quot; and can participate in the three hundred years of good deeds alongside the Daughters of the Air.

Andersen was influenced by &quot;Undine&quot;, another story of a mermaid gaining a soul through marriage, but felt that his ending was an improvement. In 1837, shortly after completing his manuscript, Andersen wrote to a friend, &quot;I have not, like de la Motte Fouqué in &quot;Undine&quot;, allowed the mermaid&#x27;s acquiring of an immortal soul to depend upon an alien creature, upon the love of a human being. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s wrong! It would depend rather much on chance, wouldn&#x27;t it? I won&#x27;t accept that sort of thing in this world. I have permitted my mermaid to follow a more natural, more divine path.&quot; Andersen was concerned that the story&#x27;s meanings would appeal best to adults, but wrote in the foreword to &quot;Fairy Tales Told for Children,&quot; &quot;I dare presume, however, that the child will also enjoy it and that the denouement itself, plainly considered, will grip the child.&quot;

==Themes and interpretations==

In Maria Tatar&#x27;s &quot;The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales&quot;, the transformation of the little mermaid from sea creature to mermaid in human form, and then to a creature of the air, is believed to reflect Andersen&#x27;s constant engagement with mutability and changes in identity. Tatar also suggests that the Little Mermaid did not give up everything for love alone. Tatar&#x27;s interpretation of the tale is one that presents a rare heroine with an investigative curiosity which is shown through the mermaid&#x27;s fascination with the unknown, the forbidden, and her intent on broadening her horizons from the start. Even before she sees the prince, she displays an intense longing to visit the world above the sea through her actions such as: arranging the flowers in her garden into the shape of the sun, listening to her grandmother and sisters&#x27; stories of the surface, and peeking in through the window of the prince&#x27;s cabin during his birthday celebrations. Tatar argues that the mermaid wants, above all, to explore the world and discover things that are beyond what she already knows. The world above seems larger than her own and holds a greater range of possibilities to exercise her adventurous spirit. This is demonstrated in some versions of the story when the prince has a page boy&#x27;s costume made for her so that she may ride on horseback and explore the land with him. Here, her willingness to cross-dress implies a willingness to transcend gender boundaries and take risks to be able to see the world. Tatar feels this also comments on Andersen&#x27;s interests in changes in identity.

In her analysis, Virginia Borges concludes that the story contains a theme about love and self-sacrifice and the dangers of accepting abuse or inconsiderate treatment in the name of love.

Alienation, or feeling like an outsider, is also a theme of the tale. The Little Mermaid feels isolated throughout the story and struggles to find her place in the world. She feels that she does not belong in the world under the sea and is disconnected from her own people, but she does not belong in the human world either, where she constantly suffers agonising pain and is treated as an animal or an amusement by the prince. 

Some readers may consider the story to be a cautionary tale, suggesting that people should love what they already have, lest they lose it forever. The Little Mermaid has a beautiful home under the sea and a loving family, yet recklessly abandons them to embark on an ill-fated quest to win the love of a man who never loves her in return. The Little Mermaid&#x27;s endeavours to earn an immortal soul through the love of a prince are fraught with suffering from the beginning: she is constantly racked with horrific pain from losing her tail; the prince regards her as a plaything rather than a love interest; and on the evening of his wedding before the sun rises, the Little Mermaid laments the home and family she has left behind. She was warned by the Sea Witch that once she became a human, she would never be able to return to her home and she would die the day after the prince married someone else, but the Little Mermaid was heedless of the consequences and thus her home and family were lost to her as a result. 

Susan White interprets the story as the difficult passage of the girl into the order of speech and social symbolism (power, politics, and agency) which is symbolically understood as masculine.

The artist Pen Dalton has made use of Laura Mulvey&#x27;s interpretation of fetishism in art to link &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; to the wearing of fetishistic clothes, and obsessive cosmetic surgery with masculine fears of loss.

The American writer Rictor Norton, in &quot;My Dear Boy: Gay Love Letters through the Centuries&quot;, and the German scholar Heinrich Detering, in &quot;Das offene Geheimnis&quot; (The Open Secret), theorize that &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was written as a love letter by Hans Christian Andersen to Edvard Collin. This is based on a letter Andersen wrote to Collin, upon hearing of Collin&#x27;s engagement to a young woman, around the same time that the Little Mermaid was written. Andersen wrote &quot;I languish for you as for a pretty Calabrian wench ... my sentiments for you are those of a woman. The femininity of my nature and our friendship must remain a mystery.&quot; Andersen also sent the original story to Collin. Norton interprets the correspondence as a declaration of Andersen&#x27;s homosexual love for Collin and describes &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; as an allegory for Andersen&#x27;s life.

==Adaptations==
===NBC television series===

In 1958, NBC began airing a new television show titled &quot;Shirley Temple&#x27;s Storybook&quot;, an American children&#x27;s anthology series that was hosted and narrated by actress Shirley Temple. The series features adaptations of fairy tales like Mother Goose and other family-oriented stories performed by well-known actors. The first season of sixteen black-and-white and colored episodes aired on NBC between 12 January 1958, and 21 December 1958, as &quot;Shirley Temple&#x27;s Storybook&quot;. Thirteen episodes of the first season re-ran on ABC beginning on 12 January 1959. The second season of twenty-five color episodes aired on NBC as &quot;The Shirley Temple Show&quot; between 18 September 1960, and 16 July 1961 in much the same format that it had under its original title.

The show aired their adaptation of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; on 5 March 1961 as episode 22 during the show&#x27;s second season. Shirley Temple herself played the mermaid. Unlike the original story, the mermaid does not give up her voice to become human, but she still fails to win the prince&#x27;s heart when he falls in love with the princess who found him. In the end, when she cannot bring herself to kill the prince with the dagger, she prepares to throw herself into the sea. Neptune himself intervenes and says that for her selfless act, she has earned the right to become a mermaid again and rejoin her family, giving the story a happy ending.

===Soviet feature film===

This 1976 Russian feature film was directed by Vladimir Bychkov and starred Viktoriya Novikova as the mermaid. The story is set in the 13th century. The mermaid saves the prince from drowning, after other mermaids mesmerize the sailors into crashing their ship onto the rocks. The prince is saved by a local princess under whose care he recovers. The mermaid seeks to marry the prince. A traveling handyman tries to help the mermaid in her love. He finds a local witch who changes her tail into legs in exchange for her hair. The prince marries the local princess and the mermaid is destined to die on the same day. The traveling handyman challenges the prince to a fight and is killed. His sacrifice spares the mermaid from death and her soul becomes eternal.
===Faerie Tale Theatre===

Filmed in 1987, this installment of Shelley Duvall&#x27;s Faerie Tale Theatre gives the Little Mermaid the name &quot;Pearl.&quot; She lives under the sea with her father the king and her three older sisters.

On her twenty-first birthday, she goes to the surface and sees a prince on a ship and falls in love with him while singing to him from the sea. Later, when the ship catches fire and the prince is thrown into the sea, Pearl rescues him and brings him to shore. There, she revives him and they kiss though he is not fully conscious and for him it is as a dream. Pearl must return to the sea before he is fully awake.

Pearl tells her family what happened and that she&#x27;s in love with a mortal. They try to talk her out of it, but instead she goes to see the Sea Witch- who also tries to talk her out of it. Pearl is determined. She exchanges her voice for legs. If she cannot win the prince&#x27;s love, she will turn into sea foam the morning after he weds another.

Meanwhile the prince, still on the beach where Pearl brought him, is found by a princess of a neighboring kingdom, Amelia. The prince transfers his feelings of love for Pearl onto her, believing she is his rescuer, and they begin a courtship that they find each of their fathers had hoped would happen so they could conjoin their kingdoms.

The prince and Amelia are out walking when they come across Pearl, naked and newly-legged, on the shore. They bring her into the castle and learn she&#x27;s mute, but charming.

Pearl and the Prince kiss, but he apologizes. Eventually Amelia tells the Prince she knows Pearl is in love with him and asks him to speak to her. The Prince asks Pearl and she indicated to him it&#x27;s true. The Prince tells her he loves her, but is not in love with her, and that he is marrying Amelia. Pearl is heartbroken.

After The Prince weds Amelia, Pearl&#x27;s sisters come to the surface and announce they&#x27;ve traded their hair to the sea witch in exchange for a dagger. Pearl must use it to kill the Prince and let his blood drip on her feet. Then, she will become a mermaid again and can go on living as she was.

Pearl takes the dagger but cannot go through with it because she loves the Prince too much. Her body then disappears as expected but because she was pure of heart she did not disappear into sea foam but instead became a spirit of the air and watched over the royal couple for the rest of their long, happy lives.

===Disney&#x27;s animated film===
 Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; is a 1989 American animated musical fantasy romance film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and distributed by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution. Loosely based on the original tale, the 1989 Disney film tells the story of a mermaid princess named Ariel, who dreams of becoming human, especially after falling in love with a human prince named Eric. Written, produced, and directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, with music by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman (who also served as a co-producer), the film features the voices of Jodi Benson, Christopher Daniel Barnes, and Pat Carroll among others.

&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was originally planned as part of one of Walt Disney&#x27;s earliest feature films, a proposed package film featuring vignettes of Hans Christian Andersen tales. Development started in the late 1930s but was delayed due to various circumstances. In 1985, Ron Clements became interested in a film adaptation of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; while he was serving as a director on &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; (1986). Clements discovered the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale while browsing through a bookstore. Believing the story provided an &quot;ideal basis&quot; for an animated feature film and keen on creating a film that took place underwater, Clements wrote and presented a two-page treatment of &quot;Mermaid&quot; to Disney CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, who approved of the idea for possible development the next day. While in production in the 1980s, the staff by chance found the original story and visual development work done by Kay Nielsen for Disney&#x27;s proposed 1930s Andersen feature. Many of the changes made by the staff in the 1930s to Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s original story were coincidentally the same as the changes made by Disney writers in the 1980s.

In 2023, the 1989 film was adapted into a live-action remake.

==Pop culture==
===&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; statue===

A statue of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; sits on a rock in the Copenhagen harbor in Langelinie. This small and unimposing statue is a Copenhagen icon and tourist attraction.

The statue was commissioned in 1909 by Carl Jacobsen, son of the founder of Carlsberg, after he had been fascinated by a ballet based on the fairy tale. The sculptor Edward Eriksen created the statue, which was unveiled on 23 August 1913. His wife, Eline Eriksen, was the model for the body. Ellen Price, the ballerina who danced the Little Mermaid in the 1909 Royal Danish Ballet production, was the model for the head and face. The statue has been severely vandalized several times.

In May 2010, it was moved from its Copenhagen harbor emplacement for the first time ever, for transport to Expo 2010 in Shanghai, where it remained until 20 November 2010.

===&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; statue in the Principality of Monaco===
A statue of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; looks out over Larvotto beach in Monaco. She was created in 2000 by Kristian Dahlgard, with several layers of metal, in homage to the Danes who live in Monaco and for the late Prince Rainier III to mark the 50th year of his reign.

<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Ernst Paulus (23 September 1890 – 1 February 1957) was a German &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (Field Marshal) during World War II who is best known for his surrender of the German 6th Army during the Battle of Stalingrad (July 1942 to February 1943). The battle ended in disaster for the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; when Soviet forces encircled the Germans within the city, leading to the ultimate death or capture of most of the 265,000-strong 6th Army, their Axis allies, and collaborators.

Paulus fought in World War I and saw action in France and the Balkans. He was considered a promising officer; by the time World War II broke out, he had been promoted to major general. Paulus took part in the invasions of Poland and the Low Countries, after which he was named deputy chief of the German Army General Staff. In that capacity, Paulus helped plan the invasion of the Soviet Union. 

In 1942, Paulus was given command of the 6th Army. He led the drive to Stalingrad but was cut off and surrounded in the subsequent Soviet counter-offensive. Adolf Hitler prohibited attempts to break out or capitulate, and the German defense was gradually worn down. Paulus surrendered in Stalingrad on 31 January 1943, the same day on which he was informed of his promotion to field marshal by Hitler. Hitler expected Paulus to take his own life, repeating to his staff that there was no precedent of a German field marshal being captured alive.

While in Soviet captivity during the war, Paulus became a vocal critic of the Nazi regime and joined the Soviet-sponsored National Committee for a Free Germany. In 1953, Paulus moved to East Germany, where he worked in military history research. He lived out the rest of his life in Dresden.

==Early life==
Paulus was born in Guxhagen and grew up in Kassel, Hesse-Nassau, the son of a treasurer. He tried, unsuccessfully, to secure a cadetship in the Imperial German Navy and briefly studied law at Marburg University.

Many English-language sources and publications from the 1940s to the present day give Paulus&#x27;s family name the prefix &quot;von&quot;. For example: Mark Arnold-Forster&#x27;s &quot;The World At War&quot;, companion volume to the documentary of the same name, Stein and Day, 1973, pp. 139–142; other examples are Allen and Muratoff&#x27;s &quot;The Russian Campaigns of 1941–1943&quot;, published in 1944 and Peter Margaritis (2019). This is incorrect, as Paulus&#x27;s family was never part of the nobility and Antony Beevor refers to his &quot;comparatively humble birth&quot; .

==World War I==
After leaving university without a degree, Paulus joined the 111th Infantry Regiment as an officer cadet in February 1910. On 4 July 1912, he married a Romanian, Constance Elena Rosetti-Solescu, the sister of a colleague who served in the same regiment. When World War I began, Paulus&#x27;s regiment was part of the thrust into France, and he saw action in the Vosges and around Arras in the autumn of 1914. After a leave of absence due to illness, he joined the &quot;Alpenkorps&quot; as a staff officer, serving in France, Romania and Serbia. By the end of the war, he was a captain.

==Interwar period==
After the armistice ending Germany&#x27;s involvement in World War I, Paulus was a brigade adjutant with the &quot;Freikorps&quot;. He was chosen as one of only 4,000 officers to serve in the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, the defensive army that the Treaty of Versailles had limited to 100,000 men. He was assigned to the 13th Infantry Regiment as a company commander at Stuttgart. He served in various staff positions for over a decade (1921–33). In the 1920s, as part of the military cooperation between the Weimar Republic and the Soviet Union to evade the restrictions of Versailles, Paulus presented guest lectures in Moscow.

Later, Paulus briefly commanded a motorized battalion (1934–35). In October 1935, he was made chief of staff at Panzer Troop Command. This was a new formation under the direction of Oswald Lutz, which directed the training and development of the &quot;Panzerwaffe&quot; (&quot;armored forces&quot;) of the German army.

==World War II==

In February 1938, Paulus was appointed &quot;Chef des Generalstabes&quot; to General Heinz Guderian&#x27;s new XVI Army Corps, which replaced Lutz&#x27;s command. Guderian described him as &quot;brilliantly clever, conscientious, hard working, original and talented&quot;; but Guderian had severe doubts about Paulus&#x27;s decisiveness and toughness, and his lack of command experience. Paulus remained in that post until May 1939, when he was promoted to major general and became chief of staff for the German Tenth Army, with which he saw service in the invasion of Poland. The unit was renamed the Sixth Army and engaged in the spring offensives of 1940 through the Netherlands and Belgium. Paulus was promoted to lieutenant general in August 1940. The following month he was named deputy chief of the German General Staff (Oberquartiermeister I). In that role he helped draft the plans for the invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa.

===Eastern Front and Stalingrad===

In November 1941, after the German Sixth Army&#x27;s commander, Field Marshal Walter von Reichenau, Paulus&#x27;s patron, became commander of the entire Army Group South, Paulus, who had never commanded a larger unit than a battalion, was promoted to &quot;General der Panzertruppe&quot; and appointed commander of the Sixth Army. However, Paulus took over his new command only on 20 January, six days after the sudden death of Reichenau, leaving him on his own and without the support of his more experienced sponsor.

Paulus led the drive on Stalingrad that summer. His troops fought Soviet forces defending Stalingrad for over three months in increasingly brutal urban warfare. In November 1942, when the Soviet Red Army launched a massive counter-offensive, Operation Uranus, Paulus found himself surrounded by an entire Soviet army group. Paulus did not request to evacuate the city when the counter-offensive began.

Paulus followed Adolf Hitler&#x27;s orders to hold his positions in Stalingrad under all circumstances, despite the fact that he was completely surrounded by strong Soviet forces. Operation Winter Storm, a relief effort by Army Group Don under Field Marshal Erich von Manstein, was launched in December. Following von Manstein&#x27;s orders, Paulus prepared to break out of Stalingrad. In the meantime, he kept his army in fixed defensive positions. Manstein told Paulus that the relief would need assistance from the Sixth Army, but the order to initiate the breakout never came. Paulus remained firm in obeying the orders he had been given. Manstein&#x27;s forces were unable to reach Stalingrad on their own and their efforts were eventually halted due to Soviet offensives elsewhere on the front.

Kurt Zeitzler, the newly appointed chief of the Army General Staff, eventually got Hitler to allow Paulus to break out—provided he continue to hold Stalingrad, an impossible task.

For the next two months, Paulus and his men fought on. However, the lack of food and ammunition, the equipment losses, and the deteriorating physical condition of the German troops gradually wore down the German defense. With the new year, Hitler promoted Paulus to colonel general.

About resisting capitulation, according to Adam, Paulus stated: 

====Crisis====
On 7 January 1943, General Konstantin Rokossovsky, commander of the Red Army on the Don front, called a cease-fire and offered Paulus&#x27; men generous surrender terms: normal rations, medical treatment for the ill and wounded, permission to retain their badges, decorations, uniforms and personal effects. As part of his communication, Rokossovsky advised Paulus that he was in an impossible situation. Paulus requested permission from Hitler to surrender. Even though it was obvious the Sixth Army was in an untenable position, the German Army High Command rejected Paulus&#x27;s request, stating, &quot;Capitulation out of the question. Every day that the army holds out longer helps the whole front and draws away the Russian divisions from it.&quot;

After a Soviet offensive overran the last emergency airstrip in Stalingrad on 25 January, the Soviet command again offered Paulus a chance to surrender. Paulus radioed Hitler once again for permission. Telling Hitler that collapse was &quot;inevitable,&quot; Paulus stressed that his men were without ammunition or food, and he was no longer able to command them. He also said that 18,000 men were wounded and were in immediate need of medical attention. Once again, Hitler rejected Paulus&#x27;s request out of hand, and ordered him to hold Stalingrad to the death. On 30 January, Paulus informed Hitler that his men were only hours from collapse. Hitler responded by showering a raft of field promotions by radio on Paulus&#x27; officers to build up their spirits and bolster their will to hold their ground. Most significantly, he promoted Paulus to field marshal. In deciding to promote him, Hitler noted that there was no known record of a Prussian or German field marshal ever having surrendered. The implication was clear: Paulus was to commit suicide. Hitler implied that if Paulus allowed himself to be taken alive, he would shame Germany&#x27;s military history.

====Capitulation====
Paulus and his staff surrendered on the morning of 31 January 1943. The events of that day were recorded by Colonel Wilhelm Adam, one of Paulus&#x27; aides and an adjutant in the XXIII Army Corps, in his personal diary:


On 2 February 1943, the remainder of the Sixth Army capitulated. Upon finding out about Paulus&#x27;s &quot;surrender&quot;, Hitler flew into a rage and vowed never to appoint another field marshal again. (In fact, he went on to appoint another seven field marshals during the last two years of the war.) Speaking about the surrender of Paulus, Hitler told his staff:

Paulus, a Roman Catholic, was opposed to suicide. During his captivity, according to General Max Pfeffer, Paulus said, &quot;I have no intention of shooting myself for this Bohemian corporal.&quot; Paulus also forbade his soldiers from standing on top of their trenches in order to be shot by the enemy.

Shortly before surrendering, Paulus sent his wedding ring back to his wife on the last plane departing his position. He had not seen her since 1942 and would not see her again, as she died in 1949 while he was still in captivity.

==After Stalingrad and post-war era==

At first, Paulus refused to collaborate with the Soviets. However, after the attempted assassination of Hitler on 20 July 1944, he became a vocal critic of the Nazi regime, joining the Soviet-sponsored National Committee for a Free Germany which appealed to Germans to surrender. In response, Germany put his wife as well as his daughter Olga von Kutzschenbach into &quot;Sippenhaft&quot;. He later acted as a witness for the prosecution at the Nuremberg Trials. He was allowed to move to the German Democratic Republic in 1953, two years before the repatriation of the remaining German POWs.

During the Nuremberg Trials, Paulus was asked about the Stalingrad prisoners by a journalist. He told the journalist to tell the wives and mothers that their husbands and sons were well. However, of the 91,000 German prisoners taken at Stalingrad, half had died on the march to Siberian prison camps, and nearly as many died in captivity; only about 6,000 survived and returned home.

After his return to the German Democratic Republic in 1953, Paulus gave a talk in Berlin on 2 July 1954 in the presence of Western journalists, titled &quot;On the vital issues of our nation&quot;. In it, he paid respect to the memory of General Heinz Guderian, who had died a little over a month previously, and criticized the political leaderships of the German Empire and Nazi Germany for causing the defeats of the German Army in both world wars:

He also criticized United States foreign policy as aggressive and called for a reconciliation between the Germans and the French:

Finally, he supported former German Chancellor Heinrich Brüning&#x27;s appeal for a betterment of relations between West Germany and the Eastern Bloc, agreed with Brüning&#x27;s criticism of West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer&#x27;s overtly pro-American policy, and expressed his hope for a German reunification:

From 1953 to 1956, Paulus lived in Dresden, East Germany, where he worked as the civilian chief of the East German Military History Research Institute. In late 1956, he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and became progressively weaker. He died a few months later, in Dresden, on 1 February 1957, aged 66. As part of his last will and testament, his body was transported to Baden-Baden, West Germany, to be buried at the (main cemetery) next to his wife.

<text>Kumaragupta I was Gupta emperor from 415 until his death in 455. A son of the Gupta king Chandragupta II and Queen Dhruvadevi, he seems to have maintained control of his inherited territory, which extended from Gujarat in the west to Bengal region in the east.

Kumaragupta performed an Ashvamedha sacrifice, which was usually performed to prove imperial sovereignty, although no concrete information is available about his military achievements. Based on the epigraphic and numismatic evidence, some modern historians have theorized that he may have subdued the Aulikaras of central India and the Traikutakas of western India. The Nalanda mahavihara was possibly built during his reign.

The Bhitari pillar inscription states that his successor Skandagupta restored the fallen fortunes of the Gupta family, which has led to suggestions that during his last years, Kumaragupta suffered reverses, possibly against the Pushyamitras or the Hunas. However, this cannot be said with certainty, and the situation described in the Bhitari inscription may have been the result of events that happened after his death.

== Early life ==

Kumaragupta was a son of the Gupta emperor Chandragupta II and Queen Dhruvadevi. Chandragupta&#x27;s last inscription is dated c. 412 CE, while Kumaragupta&#x27;s earliest inscription is dated c. 415 CE (year 96 of the Gupta era). Therefore, Kumaragupta must have ascended the throne in or shortly before 415 CE.

Kumaragupta bore the titles &quot;Maharajadhiraja&quot;, &quot;Parama-bhattaraka&quot;, and &quot;Paramadvaita&quot;. He also adopted the title Mahendraditya, and his coins call him by several variants of this name, including Shri-Mahendra, Mahendra-simha, and Ashvamedha-Mahendra. Shakraditya, the name of a king mentioned in Buddhist texts, may also have been the title of Kumaragupta (see #Religion section).

== Reign ==

Kumaragupta had inherited a large empire built upon the conquests of his father Chandragupta II and his grandfather Samudragupta. No concrete information is available about his military achievements. The inscriptions issued during his reign have been discovered in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Bangladesh; an inscription of his son has been discovered in Gujarat. In addition, his garuda-inscribed coins have been discovered in western India, and his peacock-inscribed coins have been discovered in the Ganges valley. This suggests that he was able to maintain control over the vast territory that he inherited. Thus, even if his reign was militarily uneventful, he must have been a strong ruler for being able to maintain a stable government in a large empire, as indicated by epigraphic and numismatic evidence.

There are some indications that Kumaragupta&#x27;s reign was not devoid of wars and disturbances. For example, he worshipped the war god Karttikeya, and his gold coins suggest that he performed the Ashvamedha ceremony which was used by ancient kings to prove their sovereignty. However, since there is no concrete information available about any military conquest by him, it is not certain if this performance is indicative of any conquests.

=== Possible south-western conquests ===

Kumaragupta&#x27;s coins have been found in present-day Maharashtra, which was located to the south-west of the core Gupta territory. These include 13 coins from Achalpur, and a hoard of 1395 silver coins from Samand in Satara district. His coins discovered from south Gujarat resemble the coins issued by the Traikutaka dynasty, which ruled this region. This has led to suggestions that Kumaragupta defeated the Traikutakas.

=== Possible annexation of Dashapura ===

The 423 CE Mandsaur inscription mentions a line of kings whose name ends with -varman, who probably had their capital at Dashapura (modern Mandsaur). The inscription describes one of these kings, Nara-varman, as an &quot;Aulikara&quot;, which seems to have been the dynasty&#x27;s name. The inscription describes a guild of silk-weavers who had migrated from the Lata region of present-day Gujarat to Dashapura. It then abruptly moves away from this topic and mentions &quot;while Kumaragupta was ruling the whole earth&quot;. It further states that a sun temple was built in c. 436 CE during the reign of Nara-varman&#x27;s grandson Bandhu-varman: it was later destroyed or damaged by other kings, and the guild had it repaired it in c. 473 CE.

According to one theory, Bandhuvarman ruled Dashapura as a feudatory of Kumaragupta I, the subject of this article. However, historian R. C. Majumdar argues that the &quot;Kumaragupta&quot; referred to in the inscription is the later king Kumaragupta II. According to Majumdar&#x27;s theory, the temple was built in c. 436 CE when Bandhuvarman ruled as a sovereign, and was repaired in c. 473 CE during the reign of Kumaragupta II. Bandhuvarman&#x27;s grandfather Naravarman and his father Vishvavarman seem to have been independent rulers, because none of the three inscriptions issued during their reigns refer to a Gupta overlord. Therefore, according to Majumdar, irrespective of who the &quot;Kumaragupta&quot; mentioned in the Mandsaur inscription is, the Dashapura area seems to have been annexed to the Gupta empire sometime after this inscription was issued, that is, during c. 424-473 CE. Majumdar theorizes that the Dashapura region was annexed to the Gupta empire during the reign of Kumaragupta I, either through military conquest or diplomacy.

=== Other possible campaigns ===

Some coins of Kumaragupta&#x27;s coins depict him as a rhinoceros-slayer, which some scholars such as Tej Ram Sharma see as possible evidence of his successes against the king of Kamarupa in present-day Assam, where the Indian rhinoceros is abundant. Another category of his coins portray him as a tiger-slayer, which according to historian H. C. Raychaudhuri, may allude to his incursions of the territory to the south of the Narmada River, where tigers are abundant. However, historian S. R. Goyal dismisses both of these coin-based theories as fanciful.

== Administration ==

Epigraphic evidence suggests that Kumaragupta ruled his empire through governors (Uparikas), who bore the title &quot;Maharaja&quot; (&quot;great king&quot;), and administered various provinces (Bhuktis). The districts (vishayas) of the provinces were administered by district magistrates (Vishyapatis), who were supported by an advisory council comprising:

* the town president or mayor (Nagara-Shreshtin)
* the representative of the merchant guild (Sarthavaha)
* the chief of the artisan guild (Prathama-Kulika)
* the chief of the guild of writers or scribes (Prathama-Kayastha)

Ghatotkacha-gupta (not to be confused with his ancestor Ghatotkacha) governed the Eran region during Kumaragupta&#x27;s reign. His c. 435-436 inscription suggests that he was a member of the Gupta royal family, probably a son or younger brother of Kumaragupta. He is most probably same as the Ghatotkacha-gupta mentioned in a seal found at Vaishali, and the Ghatotkacha-gupta who is known to have issued a gold coin. He may have assumed independence for a short period, possibly after the death of Kumaragupta.

Chirata-datta ruled the Pundravardhana-bhukti (province) in present-day Bengal as a subordinate of Kumaragupta. His known dates range from c. 443 to c. 447 (years 124-128 of the Gupta era).

The 436 CE Karamdanda inscription mentions Prithivishena, who was initially &quot;mantrin&quot; and &quot;kumaramatya&quot; (minister) of Kumaragupta I, and later became his &quot;mahabaladhikrita&quot; (general). His father Shikharasvamin had served Chandragupta II as a &quot;mantrin&quot; and &quot;kumaramatya&quot;.

Kumaragupta seems to have established diplomatic relations with the Liu Sung emperors of China, as suggested by visits of Chinese delegations to India, and the exchange of an Indian envoy.

== Personal life ==

Kumaragupta had at least two sons: Skandagupta and Purugupta. The inscriptions of Skandagupta, who became the next king, do not mention the name of his mother, in a departure from the tradition. Purugupta was the son of &quot;Mahadevi&quot; (queen) Anantadevi. Historian R. N. Dandekar theorizes that Anantadevi was a Kadamba princess, as the Talagunda pillar inscription suggests that the Kadamba king Kakusthavarman established a matrimonial alliance with the Guptas.

The Bihar stone pillar inscription of Skandagupta suggests that Kumaragupta also married the sister of one of his ministers. As mentioned above, Ghatotkacha-gupta (not to be confused with the earlier king Ghatotkacha) was probably a son or younger brother of Kumaragupta.

The Chinese traveler Xuanzang mentions Budhagupta after king Shakraditya (identified as Kumaragupta I by some scholars) while naming the patrons of the Nalanda monastery. Based on this, historian R. K. Mukherjee theorizes that Budhagupta was also a son of Kumaragupta I. However, the epigraphic evidence makes it clear that Budhagupta was a son of Kumaragupta II, not Kumaragupta I.

== Religion ==
Epigraphic evidence indicates that various faiths including Shaivism, Vaishnavism, Buddhism, and Jainism, flourished during Kumaragupta&#x27;s reign. He constructed several Buddhist monasteries at Nalanda. Kumaragupta&#x27;s silver coins describe him as a devotee of the god Vishnu (&quot;parama-bhagavata&quot; or &quot;bhagavata&quot;). His gold, silver, and copper coins feature Vishnu&#x27;s vahana Garuda. He was also a devotee of the war god Karttikeya (also known as Skanda): his coins feature Karttikeya seated on a peacock. He named his son Skandagupta after the god, and his own name &quot;Kumara&quot; appears to have been based on another name of the god.

According to the Buddhist writers Xuanzang (7th century) and Prajnavarman (8th century), the University at Nalanda was established by a king called Shakraditya. Modern scholars identify king Shakraditya with Kumaragupta based on the following points:

* &quot;Shakra&quot; and &quot;Mahendra&quot; are names of the Indian deity Indra, and Kumaragupta bore the title Mahendraditya.
* The earlier Chinese traveler Faxian, who toured India during 400-411 CE does not mention the existence of any monastery at Nalanda, which was located near other places visited by him, such as Pataliputra and Gaya. The omission of such an important Buddhist site in University can be explained by the assumption that the monastery in Nalanda was established after 411 CE, during the reign of Kumaragupta.

Xuanzang mentions Budhagupta (a successor of the later king Kumaragupta II) after Shakraditya: he states the monastery was enriched by the endowments of the kings Shakraditya, Budhagupta, Tathagatagupta, and Baladitya. This casts some doubt on the identification of Shakraditya with Kumaragupta I.

== Last years ==

The earliest known regnal date of Kumaragupta&#x27;s son Skandagupta is c. 455 CE (year 136 of the Gupta era). This proves that Kumaragupta&#x27;s reign ended in or before this year. Historian V. A. Smith read the dates on some of Kumaragupta&#x27;s coins as c. 455 CE (years 134 and 135 of the Gupta era), based on which modern scholars theorize that Kumaragupta ruled until 455 CE. However, numismatist P. L. Gupta has disputed Smith&#x27;s reading, and has dated the end of Kumaragupta&#x27;s reign to c. 450 CE.

According to one theory, the later years of Kumaragupta&#x27;s reign were not peaceful. This theory is based on the c. 448 CE Mankuwar Buddha inscription issued during Kumaragupta&#x27;s reign, and the Bhitari pillar inscription of Skandagupta:

* The Bhitari inscription states that Skandagupta defeated his enemies and re-established the &quot;ruined fortunes&quot; of his family when his father died, and then visited his mother whose &quot;eyes were full of tears of joy&quot;. The enemies mentioned in the inscriptions include the Pushyamitras or the Hunas; an alternative interpretation reads &quot;yudhyamitras&quot; (a generic term for enemies) instead of Pushyamitras.
* The Mankuwar Buddha inscribed with &quot;year 129 in the reign of Great King Kumaragupta&quot; (448 CE, at the end of the reign of Kumaragupta) only uses the feudatory title &quot;Maharaja&quot; (, &quot;Great King&quot;) for Kumaragupta instead of the imperial title &quot;Maharajadhiraja&quot; (&quot;Great King of Kings&quot;). This has led to suggestions that he suffered reverses in the later part of his reign, possibly against the Pushyamitras or the Hunas.

However, it cannot be said with certainty that Kumaragupta faced trouble during his last years. For example, it is possible that the drafter of the Man Kuwar inscription used a wrong title simply because of carelessness or ignorance. Thus, it is possible that the troubles referred to in the Bhitari inscription occurred &quot;after&quot; Kumaragupta&#x27;s death: these troubles probably resulted from a disputed succession to the throne, and caused a civil war. However, this is a mere conjecture, and according to another theory, the situation described in the Bhitari inscription may have been the result of a Huna invasion. This theory is based on the Junagadh inscription which suggests that Skandagupta defeated the mlechchhas (foreigners, possibly the Hunas) before c. 455 CE. It is also possible that both of these theories are true: Skandagupta may have been dispatched to the frontier to check a Huna invasion; meanwhile, Kumaragupta died in the capital, leading to a succession dispute.

According to one theory, Kumaragupta&#x27;s sons Skandagupta and Purugupta may have been involved in a succession dispute. Another possibility is that Purugupta - the son of the chief queen - was a minor at the time of Kumaragupta I&#x27;s death, because of which Skandagupta - the son of a junior queen - ascended the throne. Skandagupta succeeded Kumaragupta, and was succeeded by Purugupta, whose descendants became the subsequent kings.

== Coinage ==

Among the Gupta kings, Kumaragupta issued the largest varieties of coins. His 628 coins in the Bayana hoard belong to 14 different types.

The varieties of his coins include the following:

* Archer type: Similar to the archer-type coins of Chandragupta II. The reverse legend reads &quot;Shri-Mahendrah&quot;. The coins appear in several varieties, with different obverse legends:
** &quot;Mahdrajadhiraja-Shri-Kumdraguptah&quot; (&quot;King of kings, the illustrious Kumaragupta&quot;)
** &quot;Gunesho mahitalam jayati Kumarah&quot; (&quot;Prominent in merit Kumara conquers the world&quot;)
** &quot;Vijitavanir avanipatih Kumaragupto divam jayati&quot; (&quot;King Kumaragupta who has conquered the earth wins heaven&quot;)
** &quot;Jayati mahitalam Shri-Kumaraguptah&quot; (&quot;The illustrious Kumaragupta conquers the earth&quot;)
** &quot;Jayati mahitalam Shri-Kumaraguptah sudhanvi&quot; (&quot;The excellent archer, the illustrious Kumaragupta conquers the earth&quot;)
** &quot;Parama-rajadhiraja-Shri-Kumaragupta&quot; (&quot;The illustrious Kumaragupta, the highest king of kings&quot;)
* Horseman type: Similar to the horseman-type coins of Chandragupta II, but the reverse of some of these coins features a new image, that of a goddess feeding a peacock, with the legend &quot;Ajita-Mahendrah&quot; (&quot;Undefeated Mahendra&quot;). The coins appears in several sub-types, with different obverse legends:
** &quot;Prithvital-ambarashashi Kumaragupto jayaty-ajitah&quot; (&quot;The moon in the firmament of the earth, the invincible Kumaragupta is victorious&quot;)
** &quot;Jayati nripo ribhir-ajitah&quot; (&quot;Victorious is the king who is never defeated by the enemies&quot;)
** &quot;Kshitipatir-ajito vijayi Kumaragupto divam jayati&quot; (&quot;The unconquered and victorious king Kumaragupta wins the heaven&quot;)

** &quot;Prithvi-taleshvarendrah Kumaragupto jayaty-ajitah&quot; (&quot;The lord of the rulers of this earth, the invincible Kumaragupta is victorious&quot;)
* Swordsman type: A new type introduced by Kumaragupta. Bears an image of the king holding the sword, with a garuda emblem, and the legend &quot;Gamavajitya sucharitaih Kumaragupto divam jayati&quot; (&quot;Having conquered the earth, Kumaragupta wins the heaven by his meritorious deeds&quot;). The obverse depicts goddess Lakshmi sitting on a lotus, and bears the legend &quot;Shri-Kumaraguptah&quot;.
* Lion-slayer type: Similar to the lion-slayer-type coins of Chandragupta II. The reverse bears the legend &quot;Shri-Mahendrasimhaah&quot; or &quot;Simha-Mahendrah&quot;. The coins appear in several sub-types, with different obverse legends:
** &quot;Kshitipatir-ajita-Mahendrah Kumaragupto divam jayati&quot; (&quot;Kumaragupta, unconquered Mahendra, the lord of earth, wins heaven&quot;)
** &quot;Kumaragupto vijayi simha-Mahendro divam jayati&quot; (&quot;The victorious Kumaragupta, lion-like Mahendra, wins the heaven&quot;&quot;)

** &quot;Sakshadiva Narasimho simha-Mahendro jayatyanisham&quot; (&quot;Narasimha, as it were incarnate, the lion-like Mahendra is ever victorious&quot;)
* Tiger-slayer type: Similar to the tiger-slayer-type coins of his grandfather Samudragupta. The reverse side of Kumaragupta&#x27;s coins feature a new image: that of a goddess standing on a crocodile, and feeding a peacock. The obverse legend reads &quot;Shriman vyaghra-bala-parakramah&quot; (&quot;The glorious [king] whose prowess is like that of a tiger&quot;. The reverse legend reads &quot;Kumaraguptodhiraja&quot;.
* Elephant-rider: Shows the king riding a caparisoned elephant using a goad, with an attendant holding an umbrella over his head. The legend reads &#x27;Kshataripu-Kumaragupto rajatrata jayati ripun&quot; (&quot;Kumaragupta, who has destroyed his enemies and protects [subordinate] kings, is victorious over his foes.&quot; The reverse features goddess Lakshmi standing on a lotus, with the legend &quot;Shri-Mahendragajah&quot; (&quot;The elephant of the illustrious Mahendra&quot;).
* Elephant-rider lion-slayer type: Similar to the elephant-rider type, but the king is shown holding a dagger to slay a lion in front of the elephant. The reverse is also similar, but the goddess holds an indistinct object in her hand, which a peacock is looking at. The reverse legend reads &quot;Simhanihnata Mahendragajah&quot; (&quot;The elephant of king Mahendra, destroyer of lion&quot;).
* Rhinoceros-slayer (Khadgatrata) type: This gold coin is unique to Kumaragupta, and shows the king riding a horse and attacking a rhinoceros with his sword. The legend reads &quot;khadgatrata Kumaragupto jayaty-anisham&quot; (&quot;Ever victorious is the lord Kumaragupta, who is saviour of rhinoceroses&quot;). The reverse shows goddess Ganga, with a female attendant holding a chhatra (umbrella). The goddess stands on an elephant-headed crocodile, which holds a lotus stalk in its trunk. The reverse legend reads &quot;Shri-Mahendrakhadga&quot; (&quot;The illustrious Mahendra [saviour of] rhinoceros&quot;).
* Ashvamedha-type: Similar to the Ashvamedha-type coins of Samudragupta. The legend is unclear, but historian A. S. Altekar has read it as &quot;Devo jitashatruth Kumaragupto dhiraja&quot; (&quot;King Kumaragupta, the supreme lord, who has conquered his enemies&quot;). The reverse legend reads &quot;Shri-Ashvamedha-Mahendrah&quot;.
* Karttikeya type: Shows the god Karttikeya, who is also known as &quot;Kumara&quot;. The legend is unclear: Altekar has read it as &quot;Jayati svagunair-guna Mahendra-Kumarah&quot; (&quot;Victorious is Mahendra-Kumara by his own merits&quot;). The obverse shows the king feeding a peacock, who is the vahana (mount) of the god, with the legend &quot;Shri-Mahendra Kumarah&quot;.
* Chhatra-type: Similar to the chhatra-type coins of Chandragupta II. The obverse legend begins with &quot;Jayati mahitalam&quot;; the rest of it is lost. The reverse legend reads &quot;Shri-Mahendraditya&quot;.
* Apratigha-type: The obverse depicts a man (possibly the king) flanked by a man on his left and a woman in vitarka mudra on his right. The vertical legends beside the central figure read &quot;Kumara&quot; and &quot;guptah&quot;; there is a circular legend which is unclear. The reverse shows the goddess Lakshmi sitting on a lotus, with the legend &quot;Apratighah&quot; (&quot;unconquered&quot;).
* Lyrist type: Similar to the lyrist-type coins of Samudragupta; shows the king sitting on a couch and playing a lute. The legend reads &quot;Maharajadhiraja-Shri-Kumaraguptah&quot;. The reverse shows a woman sitting on a couch and holding a flower, with the legend &quot;Shri-Kumaragupta&quot;.
* King and queen-type: Similar to the coins of Chandragupta I. The obverse shows king presenting a bunch of flowers to the queen, with an unclear legend. The reverse shows a goddess seated on a lion, with the legend &quot;Shri-Kumaraguptah&quot;.

Some repoussé coins discovered at Khairatal have also been attributed to Kumaragupta by earlier scholars. These coins depict a garuda with outstretched wings and legend &quot;Mahendraaditya&quot;. The other side is blank. It is likely that these coins were not issued by Kumaragupta or any other Gupta ruler.

== Inscriptions ==

At least 18 inscriptions from Kumaragupta&#x27;s reign are available. All of these inscriptions were issued by private individuals rather than the Gupta royals, and most of them aim to record religious matters. Nevertheless, they provide valuable historical information, such as a genealogy of the Gupta kings, dates, locations of places in the Gupta empire, and names of royal officers. The earliest extant Gupta inscriptions from the Bengal region were issued during Kumaragupta&#x27;s reign.

An inscription on a figure of a yaksha from Mathura in the reign of Kumaragupta has been dated to 432 CE, and a pedestal (with no king&#x27;s name on it, but presumably from Kumaragupta&#x27;s reign) has been dated to 432 CE.

<doc id="301076" wikidata="Q862867" url="?curid=301076" title="Taste bud">
<text>Taste buds are clusters of taste receptor cells, which are also known as gustatory cells. The taste receptors are located around the small structures known as papillae found on the upper surface of the tongue, soft palate, upper esophagus, the cheek, and epiglottis. These structures are involved in detecting the five elements of taste perception: saltiness, sourness, bitterness, sweetness and savoriness (umami). A popular assumption assigns these different tastes to different regions of the tongue; in actuality, these tastes can be detected by any area of the tongue. Via small openings in the tongue epithelium, called taste pores, parts of the food dissolved in saliva come into contact with the taste receptors. These are located on top of the taste receptor cells that constitute the taste buds. The taste receptor cells send information detected by clusters of various receptors and ion channels to the gustatory areas of the brain via the seventh, ninth and tenth cranial nerves.

On average, the human tongue has 2,000–8,000 taste buds. The average lifespan of these is estimated to be 10 days.

==Types of papillae==
The taste buds on the tongue sit on raised protrusions of the tongue surface called papillae. There are four types of lingual papillae; all except one contain taste buds:
* Fungiform papillae - as the name suggests, these are slightly mushroom-shaped if looked at in longitudinal section. These are present mostly at the dorsal surface of the tongue, as well as at the sides. Innervated by facial nerve.
* Foliate papillae - these are ridges and grooves towards the posterior part of the tongue found at the lateral borders. Innervated by facial nerve (anterior papillae) and glossopharyngeal nerve (posterior papillae).
* Circumvallate papillae - there are only about 10 to 14 of these papillae on most people, and they are present at the back of the oral part of the tongue. They are arranged in a circular-shaped row just in front of the sulcus terminalis of the tongue. They are associated with ducts of Von Ebner&#x27;s glands, and are innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve.
*Filiform papillae - the most numerous type but do not contain taste buds. They are characterized by increased keratinisation and are involved in the mechanical aspect of providing abrasion.

== Cell composition ==
The bud is formed by at least two main kinds of cells: supporting cells and gustatory cells. The &quot;supporting (sustentacular cells)&quot; are mostly arranged like the staves of a cask, and form an outer envelope for the bud. Some, however, are found in the interior of the bud between the gustatory cells. The &quot;gustatory (taste) cells&quot;, which are chemoreceptors, occupy the central portion of the bud; they are spindle-shaped, and each possesses a large spherical nucleus near the middle of the cell. The peripheral end of the cell terminates at the gustatory pore in a fine hair filament, the gustatory hair. The central process passes toward the deep extremity of the bud, and there ends in single or varicosities. The nerve fibrils after losing their medullary sheaths enter the taste bud, and end in fine extremities between the gustatory cells; other nerve fibrils ramify between the supporting cells and terminate in fine extremities; these, however, are believed to be nerves of ordinary sensation and not gustatory. 

Salt, sweet, sour and umami tastes cause depolarization of the taste cells, although different mechanisms are applied. Bitter causes an internal release of Ca2+, no external Ca2+ is required.

=== Type I taste bud cell ===
The type I taste bud cells make up about half of the cells in the taste buds, express ion channels and have, apparently, glia-like functions. In electronic microscopy they show up as electron-dense. They are considered to have heterogeneous gene expression patterns. 

=== Type II taste bud cell ===
The type II taste bud cells make up about another third of the cells in the taste bud and express G-protein coupled receptors that are associated with chemoreception. They usually express either type 1 or type 2 taste receptors, but one cell might detect different stimuli, such as umami and sweetness.

<doc id="301078" wikidata="Q888421" url="?curid=301078" title="Sid McMath">
<text>Sidney Sanders McMath (June 14, 1912October 4, 2003) was a U.S. marine, attorney and the 34th governor of Arkansas from 1949 to 1953. In defiance of his state&#x27;s political establishment, he championed rapid rural electrification, massive highway and school construction, the building of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, strict bank and utility regulation, repeal of the poll tax, open and honest elections, and broad expansion of opportunity for black citizens in the decade following World War II.

McMath remained loyal to President Harry S. Truman during the &quot;Dixiecrat&quot; rebellion of 1948, campaigning throughout the South for Truman&#x27;s re-election. As a former governor, McMath led the opposition to segregationist Governor Orval Faubus following the 1957 Little Rock school crisis. He later became one of the nation&#x27;s foremost trial lawyers, representing thousands of injured persons in precedent-setting cases and mentoring several generations of young attorneys. At the time of his death, he was the earliest-serving former governor.

==Early life==

Sidney Sanders McMath was born in a dog-trot log cabin on the old McMath home place near Magnolia, Columbia County, Arkansas, the son of Hal Pierce and Nettie Belle Sanders McMath. His paternal grandfather, Columbia County Sheriff Sidney Smith McMath, grand nephew of his martyred Goliad namesake, had himself been killed in the line of duty the previous year, leaving a pensionless widow and eight children, Hal being the eldest. After years of wrangling horses and bad-luck wildcatting in the Southwest Arkansas oil fields, Hal McMath moved his family by wagon to Hot Springs in June 1922. There, he sold the last of his horses and took a job as a barber. Nettie went to work as a manicurist and for the Malco movie theater as a ticket vendor. Sid and his sister, Edyth, attended Hot Springs public schools, where the boy excelled in boxing and drama and became an Eagle Scout while shining shoes and hawking newspapers to supplement the family&#x27;s meager income. He was elected president of his class each of his high school years, the last of which he won the state Golden Gloves welterweight boxing title. He attended Henderson State College and the University of Arkansas, where he was elected president of the student body. He was a member of the Arkansas Pershing Rifles military fraternal organization, Blue Key, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon. He graduated from the university&#x27;s School of Law in 1936.

McMath received a reserve ROTC commission as a second lieutenant in the Marines upon graduation from college. During World War II he served with the Marines after voluntarily returning to active duty in 1940. Assigned to train officer candidates at Quantico, Virginia, he was promoted to captain, then to major, and in 1942 he was ordered to American Samoa in command of the combined forces jungle warfare school. From late 1942 to early 1944, he led the 3rd Marine Regiment in battle as operations officer and acting CO in the Pacific Theatre, including New Georgia, Vella Lavella, Guadalcanal and Bougainville, during which he directed the Battle of Piva Forks, the pivotal action, single-handedly rallying troops pinned down by enemy mortar and machine-gun fire. He received a battlefield promotion to lieutenant colonel and was awarded the Silver Star and Legion of Merit. The citation for the former, personally signed by Admiral W.F. &quot;Bull&quot; Halsey, lauded McMath&#x27;s &quot;extraordinary heroism ... and disregard for his own safety above and beyond the call of duty [which] was an inspiration to the officers and men who observed him.&quot; Shortly afterward, McMath was stricken with malaria and filariasis and hospitalized for several months in New Zealand and San Diego. He then served in the Marine Corps headquarters in Washington, D.C. planning an amphibious invasion of the Japanese home islands. Lt. Col. McMath was discharged from active duty in December 1945.

He resumed his activity with the Marine Corps Reserve following his tenure as governor and commanded VTU 8–14 in Little Rock until 1964. He held the office of National President of the 3d Marine Division Association 1960–61.

Following his promotion to brigadier general in June 1963, with date of rank from July 1962, he performed active service as assistant commanding general, Marine Corps Base, Camp Pendleton, California, in the summer of 1963; assistant commanding general, Landing Force Training Unit, Pacific, at Coronado, California, in the summer of 1964; assistant division commander, 2nd Marine Division, FMF, at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, in the summer of 1965; president, Marine Corps Reserve Policy Board, USMC, in the summer of 1966, and in addition served at Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, including the 3rd Marine Amphibious Force in Vietnam. He was promoted to major general on November 7, 1966. In 1967, the general served as assistant deputy commander, Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic, during the summer training period. He served a second brief Reserve tour in Vietnam, with the 3rd Marine Division, in 1969.

In 1967, he helped found the Marine Corps JROTC at Catholic High School for Boys in Little Rock, Arkansas, which became one of the top JROTC units in the nation.

==Early political career==
In early 1946, McMath and other veterans returning from World War II banded together to fight corruption in the Hot Springs city government, which was dominated by illegal gambling interests. Hot Springs at the time was a national gambling mecca frequented by organized crime figures from Chicago, New York City, and other metropolitan areas. Casinos flourished, and hotels advertised the availability of prostitutes. Mobsters maintained political control by purchasing and holding hundreds of poll tax receipts, often in the names of deceased or fictitious persons, which would be used to cast multiple votes in different precincts. Law enforcement officers were on the payroll of the local &quot;organization&quot; headed by longstanding Mayor Leo McLaughlin. A former sheriff who attempted to have the state&#x27;s anti-gambling laws enforced was murdered in 1937; no one was ever charged with the killing. McMath headed a &quot;GI Ticket&quot;, which, except for McMath himself, was defeated in the Democratic primary election. However, the others resigned from the party and ran again as independents in the 1946 general election after McMath persuaded a federal judge to toss out the fraudulent poll tax receipts. Most won their offices. Among them were noted combat aviators Earl T. Ricks and I.G. Brown who were elected as mayor and sheriff, respectively.

McMath served as prosecuting attorney for the 18th Judicial District (Garland and Montgomery Counties) starting in 1947. The newly-installed GI officials, led by McMath, shut down the casinos and other rackets and a grand jury indicted many owners, pitchmen, and politicians, including the former mayor. With the development of Las Vegas in the years afterward, Hot Springs lost its premier gaming status. A casino revival during the administration of Governor Orval Faubus (1955–1967) was ended in 1967 by Republican governor Winthrop Rockefeller (1967–1971).

==Governor of Arkansas==

After success as a prosecutor, McMath in 1948 won a close Democratic gubernatorial primary runoff election against conservative Jack Holt, a former state attorney general. Holt accused McMath of &quot;selling out to the Negro vote.&quot; McMath then defeated the Republican Charles R. Black of Corning, Arkansas in the general election.

McMath entered office January 11, 1949, as the nation&#x27;s youngest governor. He was easily reelected in 1950 over his immediate predecessor, Benjamin Travis Laney of Camden, who attacked McMath for having supported Truman in 1948 when Laney and many other southern Democrats bolted the Democratic party over its civil rights plank. The walk-outs switched their allegiance to Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who ran as a &quot;Dixiecrat&quot;. McMath wrested control of the Arkansas party from Laney. He campaigned vigorously across the region and was credited by Truman with helping to save most of the South for the Democratic column, providing the electoral margin for a stunning upset victory. The two developed a lifelong friendship; McMath was mentioned early as a possible vice-presidential choice in 1952.

McMath&#x27;s administration focused on infrastructure improvements, including the extensive paving of farm-to-market and primary roads &quot;to get Arkansas out of the mud and the dust&quot;, rural electrification, and the construction of a medical center in the capital city. McMath supported anti-lynching statutes and appointed African-Americans to state boards for the first time. His administration consolidated hundreds of small school districts and built the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (financed with a two-cent tax on cigarettesa significant innovation). McMath worked tirelessly, often clandestinely, with Dr. Lawrence Davis, Sr. to save the state&#x27;s all-black college, Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical, &amp; Normal, now the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff. McMath also reformed the state&#x27;s mental health system and increased the minimum wage.

McMath was elected by the governors of other petroleum producing states to chair the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, which sought to improve pricing structures and broaden federal support for fossil fuel exploration. He was elected chairman of the Southern Governor&#x27;s Conference. McMath invited muckraking &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot; editor Harry Ashmore to speak to the governors. His topic was the waste of scarce public funds in maintaining separate school systems for white and black pupils.

==Defeat for third term and U.S. Senate==
McMath ran afoul of the energy and other extractionist sectors who had long dominated Arkansas politics, but for whom McMath was not a compliant agent. These included Arkansas Power &amp; Light, headed by utility magnate C. Hamilton Moses; wealthy bankers and bond dealers; piney woods timber companies; the Murphy Oil conglomerate and its retainers; and old-family planters in the Mississippi Delta. All feared that McMath&#x27;s progressive politics would increase labor costs and break up the sharecropping farm economy. The utility feared the loss of territory to rural electric cooperatives. These interests put aside their differences to work in concert to defeat McMath&#x27;s bid for a third term in the 1952 election. McMath ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1954 and again for governor in 1962, with primarily the same opposition united against him—although, by 1962, Moses had been displaced by bond and gas tycoon W.R. &quot;Witt&quot; Stephens of Stephens Inc. as principal kingmaker. In the 1962 race, McMath came within 500 votes of forcing Governor Orval Faubus, who had once been his executive secretary and highway director, into a runoff. McMath&#x27;s voting base among the working class was neutralized by the $2 poll tax (roughly $50 in 2014 dollars) which had to be paid a year before an election, effectively disenfranchising thousands of those voters. McMath strove in vain to repeal the tax, which remained a relic of Jim Crow until the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1964.

==Trial law practice==
Following his 1952 defeat, McMath returned to the practice of law and over the next half-century became one of the leading consumer trial attorneys in the United States. His cases set a broad range of legal precedents, including the first million-dollar personal injury verdict in a U.S. District Court (for an injured Arkansas River barge crewman, in 1968), a woman&#x27;s right to recover for the loss of her husband&#x27;s consortium (an element of damage previously limited to men), manufacturers&#x27; responsibility for harm caused by defective products and negligent advertising encouraging their misuse, the chemical industry&#x27;s liability for crop and environmental damage, drug companies&#x27; responsibility for fatal vaccine reactions in children, gun dealers&#x27; fault for the negligent sale of firearms, and the right of workers to sue third-party suppliers for job injuries. He and his partner Henry Woods, who had served as his gubernatorial chief of staff and later was appointed U.S. District Judge, became nationally known for their effective use of powerful demonstrative evidence, such as detailed models of accident scenes and the human anatomy. In 1976, he was elected president of the International Academy of Trial Lawyers, a select group of 500 of the world&#x27;s most distinguished barristers, taking office February 22, 1977, at the group&#x27;s annual convention in Nairobi, Kenya.

McMath&#x27;s courtroom victories were all the more remarkable for being won in an era of &quot;blue ribbon&quot; juries handpicked by commissioners, themselves selected by state court judges beholden to insurance defense law firms from whom they received thousands of dollars in non-reportable (and non-refundable) campaign contributions for re-election races in which few were ever opposed. Factory workers, blacks, union members, ordinary laborers, and other wage earners were often excluded from panels which were heavily weighted with bank and insurance company employees, mid-level managers, realtors, small business owners, salaried professionals, country club members and others hostile to claimants. Federal court juries were somewhat more diverse, but U.S. district judges, invariably former corporate counsel, had broader powers to dismiss cases summarily, overturn verdicts, and to withhold evidence favorable to the plaintiff—rulings which often occurred, necessitating lengthy appeals before some cases could be fully tried. Many did not survive this gauntlet.

McMath wrote a memoir, &quot;Promises Kept&quot; (University of Arkansas Press, 2003, ) detailing his rural upbringing, public schooling, family tragediesincluding the death of his first wife, Elaine, during the war and the shooting to death of his father, who had become an enraged alcoholic, by his second wife, Anne, in 1947as well as his years of military service and as governor. The Arkansas Historical Association awarded the autobiography its 2003 John G. Ragsdale Prize as the year&#x27;s most outstanding historical work. In April 2006 the book was awarded the Booker T. Worthen Medal for literary excellence by the Arkansas Library System. An appendix discusses McMath&#x27;s more significant cases from the citizen&#x27;s point of view. These include &quot;Franco v. Bunyard&quot;, which held gun merchants liable for negligently selling a pistol to escaped convicts who kidnapped and murdered store clerks; &quot;Fitzsimmons v. General Motors&quot;, which pioneered the rule of consumer induced misuse through seductive advertising (the first of three &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; Trans Am cases handled by the firm in which it was shown that clips and outtakes from scofflaw motion pictures were spliced by GM into TV commercials aimed at adolescent males); &quot;Miller v. Missouri Pacific Ry. Co.&quot;, which established a woman&#x27;s right to sue for the loss of her husband&#x27;s society, companionship and sexual relations; &quot;Brinegar v. San Ore Construction Co.&quot;, a landmark admiralty case; &quot;Harrod v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.,&quot; and Work v. Tyson Foods, Inc. and many other actions resulting in multimillion-dollar recoveries for farmers and homeowners whose crops and groundwater were poisoned by defective pesticides and poultry effluent. The Harrod case involved the issue of whether tomato crops had been damaged by cold weather or by du Pont&#x27;s fungicide, Benlate, which plaintiffs contended was contaminated with the weed killer, Atrazine. Bruce McMath, lead counsel at trial, successfully confronted rumors that his clients&#x27; claims were dishonest by openly asking jurors on voir dire, &quot;How many of you have ever cheated on your taxes?&quot; The synopsis of the case in &quot;Promises Kept&quot; is written from the perspective of plaintiffs&#x27; attorneys and stresses their contention that du Pont had intentionally contaminated their product, a claim vehemently denied by the defense.

Members of McMath&#x27;s firm founded in 1983 the Nursing Home Malpractice Litigation Group of the American Trial Lawyers Association. The group provides logistical and research support for local attorneys in custodial abuse cases.

In 1991, McMath and his firm proposed suit against tobacco companies to recover Medicaid funds spent caring for smokers. Rejected by Arkansas authorities, who had close ties to tobacco lobbyists and law firms, the idea was used by Florida, Mississippi, and Minnesota, which won billion dollar-settlements. Forty-six other states soon brought their own claims. Texas recovered $18 billion in a Texarkana federal court claim which Arkansas officials refused to join. Arkansas finally concluded a $60 million per year tag-along settlement in 1999. These, and the federal government&#x27;s own recoveries which followed in their wake will eventually exceed $1 trillion, representing the largest public interest litigation result in American legal history.

==Later life==

Sid McMath remained active into his 90s, continuing to speak at Arkansas schools and events, particularly at his first alma mater, Henderson State University, whose faculty established a history and political science lecture series in his honor, and at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, to whose scholarship fund he was a substantial contributor. He also supported local civic organizations, including the Union Rescue Mission, the Scottish Rite Masons (who awarded him its highest honor of the Grand Cross), and the Lions World Services for the Blind, whose training school in Little Rock he completed in 1999 following the loss of his vision due to macular degeneration. A video commercial featuring McMath has been aired nationally by the school in recent years. McMath was elected president of the Third Marine Division Association and in 1994 he narrated &quot;The Battle of Bauxite&quot;, a television documentary recounting the story of the miners who excavated thousands of tons of aluminum ore from pits near Bauxite, Arkansas, which was used for military aircraft production during World War II. Aluminum workers and their families were among his most ardent supporters during his many campaigns. McMath taught a senior Bible study class for 26 years at Little Rock&#x27;s Pulaski Heights United Methodist Church, with emphasis on the Old Testament prophets.

==Death==
McMath died at his home in Little Rock on Saturday, October 4, 2003. He had been released from a hospital stay on the previous Wednesday after being treated for severe dehydration, malnourishment, and an irregular heartbeat. He is survived by his third wife, Betty Dorch Russell McMath, three sons: Sandy, Phillip, and Bruce McMath; two daughters, Melissa Hatfield and Patricia Bueter; ten grandchildren and one great-grandchild. His first wife and childhood sweetheart, Elaine Braughton McMath, died at Quantico, Virginia in 1942. His second wife, of 49 years, Anne Phillips McMath, died at Little Rock in 1994. Following the death of Strom Thurmond, he became the earliest-serving former governor. After his death, the title was passed on to Delaware governor Elbert N. Carvel, who was inaugurated one week after McMath.

McMath was given a full military funeral by a U.S. Marine Corps Honor Guard. He lay in state for a day in the state Capitol rotunda, following which his closed, flag-draped coffin was transported by motorcade to Pulaski Heights United Methodist Church in Little Rock for services attended by more than 2,000 persons. He was eulogized by former governor David Pryor as, &quot;the best friend Arkansas ever had.&quot; The ceremony included hymns by the combined Methodist and the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff Vespers choirs, concluding with &quot;Onward, Christian Soldiers.&quot; Following the firing of a salute by the Honor Guard, McMath was interred at Pinecrest Memorial Cemetery in Saline County, Arkansas, a few yards from a survey marker denoting the geographical center of the state.

Sid McMath Avenue in Little Rock is named for him, and in December 2004 the Central Arkansas Library System dedicated a new branch in his honor. A statue of McMath, waving his trademark Panama campaign hat, was commissioned by the library from sculptor Bryan Massey. It was unveiled September 26, 2006, as the centerpiece of a sculpture plaza and nature trail. In December 2006, Electric Cooperatives of Arkansas announced the presentation of the first Sidney S. McMath Award for Outstanding Leadership and Courage by a Public Official to U.S. representative Marion Berry (D-Ark). Former congressmen Mike Ross (D-Ark) and John Paul Hammerschmidt (R-Ark) have also received the award. Henderson State University has established the Sidney S. McMath Pre-Law Lecture Series Fellowship and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences recently received a $1 million private endowment for the Sidney S. McMath professorship in public health. On September 19, 2012, UAMS dedicated a life-sized painting of McMath above a plaque paying tribute to him as &quot;Founder of the College of Nursing&quot;, &quot;Founder of the College of Pharmacy&quot; and &quot;Founder of the University of Arkansas Medical Center.&quot; The Governor Sidney Sanders McMath Memorial Scholarship for an Outstanding Pre-Law Junior was established at Southern Arkansas University by the Columbia County Democratic Central Committee on April 5, 2008. Lions World Services for the Blind presents an annual Sidney McMath Award for a Lifetime of Outstanding Public Service. The Arkansas Prosecuting Attorneys Association, in conjunction with Henderson State University, presents an annual Sid McMath Sword of Justice award to the district attorney who best exemplifies courage and tenacity in that office. The former governor&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Promises Kept&quot;, posthumously was awarded the Arkansas Historical Association&#x27;s highest accolade, the John G. Ragsdale Prize. In April 2006 it received the Booker T. Worthen Medal for literary excellence from the Central Arkansas Library System. The week of June 14, 2012, McMath&#x27;s 100th birthday, was celebrated with a &quot;Centennial Salute&quot; by the library whose Butler Center, with Henderson State University, presented public lectures by 24 historians, educators and community leaders on various aspects of McMath&#x27;s political, legal and military careers. The symposium was chaired by Dr. Michael Pierce, associate professor of southern history at the University of Arkansas and editor of the Arkansas Historical Quarterly, and Dr. C. Fred Williams, chair emeritus of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock Department of History. Presentations were videotaped and archived by the David and Barbara Pryor Center for Oral History. Little Rock&#x27;s Main Post Office was renamed in McMath&#x27;s honor on June 7, 2013, by Special Act of Congress signed by President Obama. There is no plaque or other memorial in Hot Springs, Arkansas, mentioning McMath or the GI reform movement he led.

==Legacy==

===Historical reputation===

In a 1999 opinion poll of political science professors, McMath placed fourth on a list of top Arkansas governors of the 20th century. However, in a December 2003 forum of historians and journalists sponsored by the Old State House Museum in Little Rock, there was a consensus that McMath&#x27;s historic highway and school building programs, his early commitment to civil rights, particularly his support of U.S. President Harry S Truman in the 1948 presidential election against Dixiecrat Strom Thurmond, the abolition of the so-called &quot;white primary&quot; in Arkansas (1949), the opening of the state&#x27;s medical and law schools to African-Americans (Fall 1948, but only after Governor-elect McMath&#x27;s express approval), his championship of rural electrification and his relentless opposition to segregationist Governor Orval Faubus, a former McMath ally (Faubus had served as McMath&#x27;s director of highways), during the 1957 Little Rock Central High School desegregation turmoil and throughout Faubus&#x27;s subsequent nine years in office, could well result in his elevation by future historians to first placenot only among Arkansas governors, but among all southern governors of the time.

During the Little Rock Integration Crisis, McMath called upon U.S. president Dwight D. Eisenhower to take over the Arkansas National Guard if Faubus misused it to obstruct the implementation of federal court orders.

&quot;Sid McMath might have laid legitimate claim to have been the most courageous and far-sighted Southern leader of the 20th century&quot;, wrote &quot;Arkansas Times&quot; columnist Ernest Dumas on October 10, 2003. &quot;What separated McMath from every other leader of that grim time in the South was courage, the moral as well as physical variety.&quot;

Concluded Dumas: &quot;[T]he real test of courage was how he handled the defining issue of the century for every Southern political leader. [I]n a field crowded by frenzied men trying to outdo each other in their zeal to keep the Negro in his place, McMath deplored race-baiting. ... Had onejust one!major elected Southern official broken ranks on civil rights, early on, before the racist opposition began to metastasize, history might have been so different. The tragedy of Faubus and Fulbright was that they lacked the courage to do so. The tragedy of Sid McMath was that corporate vengeance denied him the opportunity to do what they would not.&quot;

George Arnold, Northwest Arkansas opinion editor of the &quot;Arkansas Democrat-Gazette&quot;, observed in a March 2004 column that, &quot;If [McMath] had been able to take Arkansas further down the path to modernization and racial harmony, Arkansas history would have been quite different. Arkansas paid a big price when the public utilities muscled him out of office. [It is] still paying.&quot; See Further Reading, below, for continued utility pricing disparity in Arkansas compared to neighboring states.

Harry Ashmore, whose &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot; editorials during the Little Rock school crisis won dual Pulitzer Prizes for him and the paper, wrote in an April 1977 book review that, &quot;McMath&#x27;s ... return to active politics in the Faubus era was pro bono, an act of integrity undertaken when he knew the chances of winning were slight and the personal cost would be high. [O]ne who did not always see eye to eye with him could say of Sid McMath: &#x27;He was there when the people needed him and didn&#x27;t know it. He is a far better man than any of those who came out ahead of him at the polls.&#x27;&quot;

The &quot;Arkansas Democrat-Gazette&quot;, in an October 7, 2003 editorial (&quot;Greatness Passed This Way&quot;) written by editorial page editor Paul Greenberg, himself a recipient of the Pulitzer Prize, lauded McMath as, &quot;[T]he greatest [man] of his eraand of a few others.&quot;

&quot;Sid McMath&quot;, the newspaper said, &quot;never believed in testing the political winds before speak[ing] out for principle. He remained a true, old-fashioned Harry Truman Democrat even as that breed gradually disappeared. When others in the party argued that America could safely co-exist with evil, Sid McMath knew betterand said so. He also knew there are far worse things than losing electionslike winning them for the wrong reasons ... He would not accept the expansion of evil in the world, no matter how inevitable that was said to be by distinguished statesmen at the time. Instead he would defy itand urge others to join him.&quot;

The belatedness of McMath&#x27;s recognition as one of the South&#x27;s great political leaders has undoubtedly been due to lingering detraction from an ersatz &quot;highway scandal&quot; (see below) contrived by opponents to defeat his 1952 re-election bid as well as his steadfast support of a tough anti-communist foreign policy throughout the Cold War, including the Vietnam War (in which he served two short reserve tours), which McMath, while condemning its micromanagement by the Johnson and Nixon administrations, saw as a critical holding action necessary to give the emerging nations of the Asian rim, most of whom were fending off their own communist insurgencies, time to build market economies and some form of democracy. In &quot;Promises Kept&quot; he suggests that this goal was in fact achieved, in spite of the 1975 North Vietnamese victory over the south, which McMath saw as pyrrhic in light of the subsequent collapse of the Soviet empire and the emergence of the rest of Southeast Asia as a free-trading powerhouse.

Nevertheless, these views, presented in scores of speeches to school, civic and veterans&#x27; groups, were bitterly resented by many of McMath&#x27;s erstwhile supporters, particularly academics, editorial writers and liberal activists (including some members of his own law firm, who left on this account), for whom an aggressive Cold War stance became heresy during the late 1960s onwardindeed, until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In spite of his towering credentials as a social and economic progressive, many of these persons never forgave McMath for his anti-communist, national defense positions, mentioning him, if at all, in detraction or with condescension and omitting him altogether from lists of historical notables. The former governor&#x27;s stances on these questions (and the anathema with which he came to be held by liberal elites) contrasted sharply with those of popular Arkansas Senator William Fulbright, who, as chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations vigorously opposed a hardline policy toward the Soviet Union generally and the U.S. commitment to South Vietnam in particular.

McMath&#x27;s grit (some would say stubbornness) in the face of sustained unpopularity and virtually certain defeat at the polls, when compromise with his opponents might have assured his survival &quot;to fight another day&quot;, has caused some commentators to question his commitment to a political career rather than to a valiant but naive Arthurian chivalryor perhaps a fatalistic resignation. However, one participant at a Southern Arkansas University forum on McMath held November 3, 2003 in Magnolia, Arkansas put it another way: &quot;When Sid McMath stood for civil rights in the 1940s and 1950s he stood virtually alone among the South&#x27;s political leaders, most of whom were waving the bloody shirt. By the 1970s every Southern pol was supporting full citizenship for African-Americans. It was by then politically correct. But for McMath, it took unprecedented courage. And in fact it later cost him whatever chance he had to salvage his political career. He certainly deserves a chapter in the next &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;. He was a true hero, not only to the South, but also to the Nation. He ranks with John Peter Altgeld [of Illinois], James Stephen Hogg [of Texas] and Robert M. La Follette [of Wisconsin] as the greatest of the American state governors. His stands on principle undoubtedly denied him a genuine chance to contend for the presidency. His life can be summed up in one word: Valor.&quot;

===Political legacy===

Sid McMath served barely six years in public office, only four as governor. He left behind no powerful political organization or claque of partisans. Gambling in Hot Springs, though subdued from its brazen heyday, returned sporadically for another 20 years. Every Arkansas home eventually would have been wired for electricityalthough up to a decade later and under AP&amp;L monopoly pricing rather than lower Co-op rates. The Interstate highway system was mostly completed through Arkansas by 1980tying into the thousands of miles of farm-to-market roads built or begun by McMath. National repeal of the poll tax was achieved by Constitutional Amendment, the adoption of which was enhanced by the support of a few Southern moderates, including McMath. The Civil Rights acts of the 1960s and changing cultural attitudes ultimately improved, but did not end, discrimination against African-Americans. More problematical is whether President Truman would have won re-election had the Laney forces prevailed and Arkansas and the majority of the remaining Southern and Border states gone for the Dixiecrat Thurmond, thus throwing the election to the Republican candidate, Thomas E. Dewey, or into the U.S. House of Representatives, where mischief deal-making by vested interests, particularly the tidelands oil lobby who were among Thurmond&#x27;s primary contributors, would have shadowed any result. The support of McMath and a handful of other stalwarts was almost certainly determinative. And although McMath was not successful in his decade-long contest with Faubus, his vigorous, reasoned opposition during those years of upheaval may well have foreclosed a more violent outcome. It can be said with near certainty that without McMath&#x27;s foresight and perseverance, Arkansas AM&amp;N would not have survived and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences would not have become the world-renowned institution that it is today.

Whatever fame McMath once had fled well before his death. In recent years he sometimes had to spell his name for bank tellers, reservations clerks, state employeesonce even for a newspaper reporter. He accumulated no great wealth, owning at the end a modestly upscale condominium and a small residual interest in his law firm. The latter, though no longer occupying the field alone, remains the state&#x27;s premier personal injury practice. Ironically, some of its significant cases are referred by competitors, many of whom appear amongst the swarms of television, internet, billboard and yellow page advertisements directed at &quot;victims&quot; and the &quot;hurt&quot; now common throughout America.

A key to McMath&#x27;s ultimate legacy may be found in the memory of those who knew him, if only for a time. &quot;You always left Sid McMath with the feeling, not that you had been with someone important, but that you were important, that your life had been uplifted&quot;, Arkansas Circuit Judge John Norman Harkey has said of McMath. &quot;Sid took your cares away. He refreshed your spirit. No matter how down you were before, he made you want to charge back into the battle, but with a smile, knowing, by gosh, we can really win this thing. And we did win.&quot; But, of course, McMath did not always win. A stock remark he would offer following a loss was, &quot;The bastards know they&#x27;ve been in a fight. You have to let them know you&#x27;re not afraid to leave your blood on the courtroom floor. I&#x27;ve left a lot of blood on the courtroom floor.&quot;

There was also the matter of honor, the upholding of which by a public officer amidst great tumult and peril (and against the most persuasive and enticing Machiavellian temptation to do otherwise), and at the risk not only of one&#x27;s career and personal fortune but, in the darkest days, of one&#x27;s life and those of his loved ones—may prove to be McMath&#x27;s singular legacy. Once a noted collegiate thespian, McMath on occasion would recite lines dealing with honor from roles in which he had acted (or aspired to act) in his youth. He was high-school cast in &quot;The Valiant&quot; and as Hamlet, Romeo and Henry V at university. But among his favorites, which he had not played but often wished he had done, was the lead in Rostand&#x27;s &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, a work he knew practically by heart, particularly the closing scene, in which the grenadier is dying alone except for his beloved Roxanne, to whom he confides that his paucity of means and acclaim, and his unconsummated loveall are nothing beside his intact honor, &quot;and that is ... my white ... plume.&quot;

===Political image===

McMath&#x27;s standing has been enhanced by contemporary re-examinations of his administration&#x27;s extraordinary accomplishments, given the poverty and parsimony of the era. These included the use of an unprecedented bond issue to secure the paving of more hard surface roads than all previous administrations combined (and more than those paved by any other Southern state during the period), taxing cigarettes to build the state&#x27;s medical college, a policy of openness and inclusion toward African-Americans generally and a concerted public school improvement program, including a reduction of the number of school districts from 1,753 to 425a measure begun by others but heartily endorsed by McMath in the 1948 general election and rigorously enforced by his administration after passage under the leadership of Dr. A.B. Bonds Jr., one of the country&#x27;s top young educators, a former training director for the Atomic Energy Commission, and a native Arkansan whom McMath persuaded to return to the state as director of the Department of Education.

Most important was McMath&#x27;s politically fatal but ultimately successful war against Middle South Utilities (now Entergy Corporation), the then-dominant political force in state politics, which operated locally as Arkansas Power &amp; Light (a subsidiary of Entergy) Co. (AP&amp;L). The corporation and its affiliates opposed the extension of Rural Electrification Administration (REA)-generated electrical power to rural areas, which its directors and chief shareholders saw as a captive territory for AP&amp;L&#x27;s own eventual expansion. Fewer than half of Arkansas farm homes had electricity in 1948. REA-affiliated cooperatives, however, guided by Harry L. Oswald, for 32 years their Arkansas general manager and a fervent McMath loyalist, were able to open service to those areas by 1956 as the result of co-op-enabling legislation, including authorization for the building of steam generating plants, which was enacted by Congress in large part at McMath&#x27;s behest.

Middle South led the combination that defeated McMath in his 1952 re-election bid and in his 1954 effort to unseat then-Senator John L. McClellan. McClellan, who maintained a lucrative law practice with Middle South&#x27;s chairman C. Hamilton Moses, referred to the REA co-ops as &quot;communistic&quot; during the campaign, which was conducted at the height of the &quot;red scare&quot; heightened by U.S. senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s claims of communist influence in the Truman administration. McClellan was the ranking member of the Army-McCarthy subcommittee, whose hearings were televised live during the lead-up to the election. Liberal senators Hubert Humphrey, Stuart Symington, and others, as well as Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson, signed newspaper ads supporting McClellan. Moses had similarly partnered with McClellan&#x27;s predecessor, Joe T. Robinson, who prior to his death in 1937 had used his considerable power as Senate majority leader to divert the New Deal&#x27;s showcase Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) public electricity generating project away from the Arkansas River, the basin for which it was originally proposed. Moses, who had supported McMath in 1948 but had since cooled toward him, brought AP&amp;L&#x27;s entire board of directors to the governor&#x27;s office just before the 1952 candidate filing deadline to lobby McMath against the building of the initial steam generating plant, at Ozark, Arkansas. They promised to aid McMath&#x27;s third-term re-election bid, in spite of past differences, if he would withdraw his support for the plant. The governor heard the businessmen out but reaffirmed his commitment to Co-op power. Shortly afterward, four heavily AP&amp;L-funded gubernatorial candidates filed against McMath, one of whom, Chancery Judge Francis Cherry of Jonesboro, defeated him in the August primary run-off during which Cherry hosted a round-the-clock radio &quot;talkathon&quot; lambasting &quot;the McMath Highway Scandal&quot;. (See below.) Cherry was elected in November but served only one term, being defeated by Faubus in the 1954 run-off.

McClellan narrowly defeated McMath in the 1954 senatorial race, an election now generally recognized to have been marked by widespread fraud. For example, record numbers of black voters, for whom McMath had only five years before secured the right to vote in Democratic primaries, were trucked to the polls (usually plantation stores or gin offices) in Eastern Arkansas by McClellan supporters among the planters of that region who held their workers&#x27; poll tax receipts and recorded how they voted. McMath lost some of those precincts by better than 9 to 1 margins as election officials in Lee, Crittenden, Phillips, Mississippi, Desha and Chicot counties delayed completion of vote counts for a full day after the election—allegedly to see how many more fraudulent votes McClellan needed to win without a run-off.

AP&amp;L&#x27;s (and McClellan&#x27;s) enmity toward McMath did not end with his defeat in the senatorial election. Nine years later, when President John F. Kennedy suggested McMath&#x27;s possible appointment as a replacement Secretary of the Interior, McClellan quickly used his special relationship with Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, a former counsel to the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the U.S. Senate Committee on Government Operations, of which McClellan had become chairman in 1955, to nip the idea in the bud. A similar suggestion in 1964 by then-President Lyndon Johnson met the same fate. Some of McMath&#x27;s most stalwart support was from organized labor, whose abuses, particularly by national leaders of the Teamsters, were a focus of the committee&#x27;s investigations in the late 1950s. No Arkansas union members or officials, however, figured prominently in these probes.

Allegations of corruption in McMath&#x27;s highway department, brought by a grand jury dominated by utility minions, were eventually proven unfounded in three separate proceedings. Two grand juries returned no indictments, but a third on which several Middle South managers served returned three, each alleging shakedowns of highway contractors for campaign contributions. All of the accused were acquitted. There was no allegation of personal wrongdoing by McMath. However, the assertions against his administration dogged him for the rest of his life and &quot;Promises Kept&quot; includes a chapter in which McMath refutes the charges and chastises his opponents for abusing the judicial system to fabricate them. The former governor&#x27;s October 22, 1954 sworn statement before the U.S. Senate committee investigating monopoly influence over the distribution of the nation&#x27;s electrical power, in which he recounts Middle South-AP&amp;L&#x27;s manipulation of the Arkansas &quot;Highway Audit Commission&quot; and the grand jury process, warrants inclusion in any anthology of significant state papers of the 20th century. The truthfulness of McMath&#x27;s testimony describing in detail this use of raw corporate power to defeat reform and destroy the reformer was never disputed, and no rebuttal was offered. See Further Reading, below.

McMath opposed the &quot;Southern Manifesto&quot;, a March 1956 pronouncement of 19 U.S. senators, including Fulbright and McClellan, and 81 congressmen from former Confederate states decrying the Supreme Court&#x27;s 1954 desegregation ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; as: &quot;[C]ontrary to the Constitution ... creating chaos and confusion ... destroying the amicable relations between the white and Negro races ... plant[ing] hatred and suspicion [and an] explosive and dangerous condition [which is being] inflamed by outside meddlers&quot; The document encouraged public officials to use &quot;all lawful means&quot; to thwart the enforcement of the ruling. According to McMath at the time, &quot;This [manifesto] only serves to encourage demagogues to set fires of racial hatred that could consume our people.&quot;

It was this Congressional manifesto, McMath laments in &quot;Promises Kept&quot;, that gave Faubus the impetus and political cover to call out the National Guard in September 1957 to bar the entry of nine black students to Little Rock Central High School. &quot;Emboldened by this support&quot;, McMath wrote, &quot;Faubus played his racial card.&quot; McMath strenuously opposed this action as well as Faubus&#x27; closure of the public schools the following year rather than obey federal court desegregation orders.

McMath counseled President Dwight D. Eisenhower against the use of regular U.S. Army troops, suggesting instead that the U.S. Marshals Service be used to enforce the court&#x27;s orders. However, this advice was not accepted, and paratroopers from the elite 101st Airborne Division were sent to Little Rock after Eisenhower nationalized the Guard and disbanded it. The soldiers forced the admission of &quot;The Little Rock Nine&quot;, as the black students became known, but the troops&#x27; presence, as McMath foretold, stirred states-rights sentiment to a frenzy, made Faubus a hero to a majority of Arkansas voters, and ensured his re-election to a record six terms in officeeach time, ironically, with an increasing percentage of the African-American vote, of which he garnered more than 80% in the 1964 Democratic primary.

McMath became the acknowledged leader of the Faubus opposition and supported insurgent gubernatorial candidates in the 1958 and 1960 Democratic primaries. His law firm was often referred to as resembling &quot;a South American government in exile.&quot; McMath, himself, finally ran against Faubus in 1962 under the slogan, &quot;Let&#x27;s get Arkansas Moving Again.&quot; He placed second in a field of five, splitting the black vote with Faubus, while running on a platform of fresh business investment (many firms had fled the state during the years of racial strife or avoided it altogether), stricter regulation of gas and electric utility pricing, and the charging of interest on state revenues, which were held in private banks interest free but which the banks then loaned out at standard commercial ratesa windfall bankers justified as a &quot;fee&quot; for keeping the state&#x27;s funds. Faubus narrowly avoided a runoff when Marvin Melton, a Jonesboro banker widely seen as the second strongest challenger after McMath, was persuaded by Faubus operatives (who suggested that state funds could be withdrawn from his bank and questions raised about his selling of allegedly inflated insurance company stock) to quit the race.

The 1962 election cemented the ascendancy of &quot;Witt&quot; Stephens, Faubus&#x27; primary financial backer, as the state&#x27;s undisputed kingmaker. Stephens&#x27; banks held the lion&#x27;s share of state funds. His Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company charged Arkansas homeowners (whom Stephens contemptuously referred to as &quot;the biscuit cookers&quot;) the highest residential rates by volume in the Southwest, thanks to Faubus&#x27; complaisant Public Service Commission—an advantage that continues today. (See Further Reading, below.) Additionally, Stephens&#x27; brokerage firm handled most state bond issues during the 12-year Faubus reign. The Stephens empire today controls more than one hundred billion dollars in investments. &quot;Stephens, Inc&quot;, its brokerage arm, was until recently the largest off-Wall Street securities trading firm in the United States. A sign of its political cloutand warinessis the firm&#x27;s portfolio of newspaper and other communication holdings, the second largest in Arkansas after the Palmer-Hussman chain, which operates the only statewide newspaper and a spawn of local dailies. Between them, the two interests control, directly or through subsidiaries or associates, more than two-thirds of the state&#x27;s famously quiescent print and broadcast media.

Many of McMath&#x27;s staunchest supporters turned out in 1966 for Winthrop Rockefeller in his successful bid to become the state&#x27;s first GOP governor since Reconstruction. Rockefeller soundly defeated the Democratic nominee, an avowed segregationist supreme court justice, Jim Johnson.

The 1966 election was the first full general election cycle since the repeal of the poll tax and passage of the Voting Rights Act. These developments accelerated an already growing shift in influence over black voters from white bosses toward African-American clergy, due in part to the gradual displacement of plantation labor by mechanized agriculture, swelling the unemployment and welfare rolls. Rockefeller&#x27;s campaign took full advantage of this dynamic by wooing hundreds of black ministers with church improvement contributions and cash get-out-the-vote payments, setting a precedent for future candidates of both parties and considerably raising the cost of electioneering. Some ministers, themselves locally elected officials, hire out as &quot;consultants&quot; to congressional and gubernatorial candidates, often renting their church buildings and vehicles to a campaign and hiring congregants as canvassers and drivers. Early-voting laws now permit even Sunday balloting, facilitating the busing of entire congregations to polling places after services. In some instances, the churches themselves are designated as early voting precincts. Funding this cornucopia of &quot;walking around money&quot;, which can exceed $1 million per election cycle for each major statewide candidate, has substantially increased the power of the state&#x27;s corporate vested interests, whose large bundled and PAC contributions, many from lawyers, managers, and agents of out-of-state parents and affiliates, as well as from international labor union political action funds, are critical in meeting such demanding overhead. Bundling has become even more critical given individual donation limits imposed following Watergate and subsequent scandals. When rising front-end charges for television advertising (essential for reaching white voters but to which African-American voters are largely unresponsive) are added, Arkansas campaign expenditures, per voter, are among the nation&#x27;s highest.

The Rockefeller administration resumed and expanded the post-war reforms begun by McMath, particularly with regard to civil rights, which, borne on a national tide of rejection of bigotry as public policy, resulted not merely in blacks ceasing to be excluded from public services but able, in significant part, to control their allocation through the franchiseusually by bloc voting for Democratic candidates, but always as a credible threat against any racist isolate. Rather than altering the status quo with some 18% to 22% of the vote statewide (40% to 60% in some counties), blacks have been absorbed into it through disproportionate hiring as lower level public employees and as low wage &quot;associates&quot; of mega-retailing enterprises, poultry processing emporia, tertiary health and casualty insurers, the utility monopolies and other concerns buoyed by the state&#x27;s parochial, right-to-work economy.

Bereft of Rockefeller&#x27;s eleemosynary capacity or McMath&#x27;s disdain for barony, later administrations have comfortably reconciled themselves to the exigencies of this quaint realpolitik. Although Faubus died a pariah in 1994, the example of his agility in placating a credulous electorate, now multiracial, with a veneer of populism and dashes of largesse, while simultaneously accommodating the forces of extractionwhom Sid McMath illustriously, if momentarily, challenged half-a-century agoremains the guidepost for political survival in 21st century Arkansas.

Key&#x27;s classic, &quot;Southern Politics in State and Nation&quot; (Alfred Knopf Co., 1949; University of Tennessee Press, 1984, , and various subsequent editions), and sources and materials cited in those publications.

McMath&#x27;s successful opposition to the Dixiecrats and his key regional role in President Truman&#x27;s 1948 upset re-election victory is recounted by Arkansas Supreme Court Justice Robert L. Brown in &quot;Defining Moments: Historic Decisions by Arkansas Governors&quot; (University of Arkansas Press, 2011).

McMath&#x27;s own account, &quot;Promises Kept&quot;, (University of Arkansas Press, 2003) contains a wealth of primary source material including, in addition to the author&#x27;s personal recollections, photocopies of correspondence exchanged between him and President Truman and others. Citations in the Appendix refer readers interested in the details of some of McMath&#x27;s more significant cases to state and federal appellate court reporters and to law review case notes and articles. However, due to their sheer number, many cases are not cited and some citations contain typographical errors. Online and back-issue index searches of Arkansas Reports, Southwestern Reporter, Federal Reports, Federal Supplement, the &quot;ATLA Law Reporter&quot; (formerly the &quot;NACCA Law Journal&quot;), &quot;TRIAL&quot; magazine, Matthew Bender&#x27;s &quot;Art of Advocacy&quot; series (particularly Baldwin, &quot;The Art of Direct Examination&quot;), the &quot;Arkansas Law Review&quot;, &quot;UALR Law Review&quot;, &quot;Inside Litigation&quot;, &quot;Westlaw&quot; and &quot;Lexis&quot; would assist the reader in developing a more complete list of McMath&#x27;s cases, their correct citations, and commentary. Indeed, one could trace the development of the American common law of torts over the second half of the 20th century with a chronological analysis of reported (or law-reviewed) cases in which the plaintiff was represented by McMath or a member of his firm. A rich source of historical and trial practice commentary would be the video archives of the School of Trial and Appellate Advocacy, Hastings College of the Law, University of California, San Francisco, the nation&#x27;s earliest sustained CLE program and the model for many that followed, which McMath and Woods were instrumental in founding and on whose visiting faculty they or members of their firm served from its inception in 1971 until its closure in 2001.

McMath&#x27;s historical impact on the practice of law is surveyed by six authors, among them two federal judges, in &quot;A Tribute to Governor Sidney S. McMath&quot;, &quot;UALR Law Review&quot;, Vol. 26, pp 515–542 (Spring 2004).

McMath&#x27;s 3-year struggle to secure funding for the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and his key role in opening the school to African-American students is discussed at length by Dr. W. David Baird, chair of the Department of History, Oklahoma State University, in his extensive &quot;Medical Education in Arkansas, 1879–1978&quot;, (Memphis State University Press, 1979).

U.S. District Judge Henry Woods, McMath&#x27;s partner of 27 years, was a prolific legal writer and his articles on their cases occasionally appeared in the &quot;Arkansas Law Review&quot;. Woods&#x27; treatise, &quot;Comparative Fault&quot; (Lawyers Publishing Co., 3d Ed. 1996) is the hornbook authority on that area of injury law. His papers, including personal letters and memoranda on a variety of matters dating from McMath&#x27;s governorship through their years of practice together, were donated in 1998 to the special collections section of the University of Arkansas library in Fayetteville.

For an intimate family portrait and a behind-the-scenes narrative, see &quot;First Ladies of Arkansas: Women of Their Times&quot;, by Anne McMath, (August House, 1989). &quot;A Ribbon and a Star&quot; (Henry Holt, Inc., 1945) is an eyewitness memoir of the Bougainville campaign by one of McMath&#x27;s staff officers, Capt. John Monks Jr., written immediately after the engagement. Monks later became a noted playwright and film producer. For a colorful local history of Hot Springs, Arkansas during the McLaughlin period, including the mayor&#x27;s 1947 indictment and trial, see &quot;Leo &amp; Verne: The Spa&#x27;s Heyday&quot;, by Orval Allbritton, with a foreword by McMath, (Garland County Historical Society, 2003). For other perspectives, see P.H. Ramsey, &quot;A Place at the Table: Hot Springs and the GI Revolt&quot;, &quot;Arkansas Historical Quarterly&quot;, Vol. 49, No. 4 (Winter 2000); &quot;Vapors&quot; by David Hill (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, ISBN 9781250086112, NY 2020); &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Town: Hot Springs During the Gangster Era,&quot; by Philip Leigh (Shotwell Publishing Co., ISBN 9781947660052, Columbia, SC 2018); and &quot;Hot Springs: From Capone to Costello (Images of America)&quot;, by Robert K. Raines, Arcadia Publishing Co., Charleston, SC 2021).

McMath&#x27;s testimony before the U.S. Senate Anti-Monopoly Subcommittee on October 22, 1954, dealing with the Highway Audit Commission and subsequent grand jury charges and trials may be found in the Congressional Record for that date. It is also replicated at the Sid McMath web site at www.mcmathlaw.com. The McMath-Faubus relationship is noted in &quot;Faubus: Life and Times of an American Prodigal&quot;, by Roy Reed, (University of Arkansas Press, 1997). The results of continuing utility influence over rate regulation in Arkansas may be seen by comparing regional pricing. For example, the Natural Gas Price Reports of the Energy Information Administration reveal that for the period ending July 1, 2005 Arkansans paid $19.23 per —more than $3.00 greater than the average price charged residents of all six neighboring states. Mississippi residents paid $12.85, those in Louisiana, $15.79, and Texas homeowners, $15.97.

Articles and notes in the &quot;Arkansas Historical Quarterly &quot; dealing with McMath or his administration are found in Volumes 6, 9, 11, 12, 15, 21, 25, 26, 30, 37, 39, 40, 43, 44, 47, 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 57, and 59 of that publication. Shortly after his first inauguration, McMath candidly discussed his political thinking and legislative goals in a widely syndicated interview with Joseph Driscoll, national correspondent for the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;. See &quot;Sidney McMath, New Governor of Arkansas, Wants Civil Rights Protected by States&quot;, on page 1-B of that paper&#x27;s Sunday, January 23, 1949 edition.

Certain of the former governor&#x27;s personal and public papers, including Elaine Braughton McMath&#x27;s 1940–1942 diary, numerous letters (including an immense volume of correspondence between McMath and his sons while they were serving in the Marines and traveling overseas), several oversized volumes of news cuttings, recordings of 1940s stump speeches and radio interviews, 1950s and later television footage, a 30-minute June 1962 campaign film, &quot;A Man for Arkansas&quot;, shot by 4-time Academy Award-winning documentary producer Charles Guggenheim, the James Woods&#x27; monograph, and a 60-minute June 2000 AETN television interview with McMath by former governor David Pryor, as moderator, are held by the historical records section of the University of Arkansas Library in Fayetteville. The Henderson State University Library in Arkadelphia retains others. Photographs, films, flags, uniforms, campaign ribbons, medals and citations from McMath&#x27;s Marine Corps service are kept at the Arkansas Military Museum, the Old State House Museum, and the Sidney S. McMath Memorial Public Library, all in Little Rock. Readers are also referred to the Harry S. Truman Library in Independence, Missouri and the U.S. Marine Corps archives in Quantico, Virginia, St. Louis, Missouri and Washington, D.C.

<text>Vatican Hill (; ; ) is a hill in Rome, located on the right bank (west side) of Tiber river, opposite to the traditional seven hills of Rome. The hill also gave the name to Vatican City. It is the location of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

==Etymology==
The ancient Romans had several opinions about the derivation of the Latin word &quot;Vaticanus&quot;. Varro (1st century BC) connected it to a &quot;Deus Vaticanus&quot; or &quot;Vagitanus&quot;, a Roman deity thought to endow infants with the capacity for speech evidenced by their first wail (&quot;vagitus&quot;, the first syllable of which is pronounced in Classical Latin). Varro&#x27;s rather complicated explanation relates this function to the tutelary deity of the place and to the advanced powers of speech possessed by a prophet (&quot;vates&quot;), as preserved by the later antiquarian Aulus Gellius:
We have been told that the word &quot;Vatican&quot; is applied to the hill, and the deity who presides over it, from the &quot;vaticinia&quot;, or prophecies, which took place there by the power and inspiration of the god; but Marcus Varro, in his book on &quot;Divine Things&quot;, gives another reason for this name. &quot;As Aius,&quot; says he, &quot;was called a deity, and an altar was built to his honour in the lowest part of the new road, because in that place a voice from heaven was heard, so this deity was called &quot;Vaticanus&quot;, because he presided over the principles of the human voice; for infants, as soon as they are born, make the sound which forms the first syllable in &quot;Vaticanus&quot;, and are therefore said &quot;vagire&quot; (to cry) which word expresses the noise which an infant first makes&quot;.
St. Augustine, who was familiar with Varro&#x27;s works on ancient Roman theology, mentions this deity three times in &quot;The City of God&quot;.

&quot;Vaticanus&quot; is more likely to derive in fact from the name of an Etruscan settlement, possibly called &quot;Vatica&quot; or &quot;Vaticum&quot;, located in the general area the Romans called &quot;vaticanus ager&quot;, &quot;Vatican territory&quot;. If such a settlement existed, however, no trace of it has been discovered. The consular &quot;fasti&quot; preserve a personal name &quot;Vaticanus&quot; in the mid-5th century BC, of unknown relation to the place name.

&quot;Vaticanus Mons&quot; (or &quot;Vaticanus Collis&quot;) was most often a name in Classical Latin for the Janiculum. Cicero uses the plural form &quot;Vaticani Montes&quot; in a context that seems to include the modern Vatican Hill and the Monte Mario and the Janiculan hill.

The &quot;Ager Vaticanus&quot; or &quot;Campus Vaticanus&quot; was originally a level area between the &quot;Vaticanus Mons&quot; and the Tiber. During the Republican era, it was an unwholesome site frequented by the destitute. Caligula and Nero used the area for chariot exercises, as at the Gaianum, and renewal was encouraged by the building of the Circus of Nero, also known as the &quot;Circus Vaticanus&quot; or simply the &quot;Vaticanum&quot;. The location of tombs near the &quot;Circus Vaticanus&quot; is mentioned in a few late sources.

The Vaticanum was also the site of the &quot;Phrygianum&quot;, a temple of the Magna Mater goddess Cybele. Although secondary to this deity&#x27;s main worship on the Palatine Hill, this temple gained such fame in the ancient world that both Lyon, in Gaul, and Mainz, in Germany called their own Magna Mater compounds &quot;Vaticanum&quot; in imitation. Remnants of this structure were encountered in the Seventeenth Century reconstruction of St. Peter&#x27;s Square.

&quot;Vaticanus Mons&quot; came to refer to the modern Vatican Hill as a result of calling the whole area the &quot;Vatican&quot; &quot;(Vaticanum)&quot;. Christian usage of the name was spurred by the martyrdom of St. Peter there. Beginning in the early 4th century AD, construction began on the Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica over a cemetery that is the traditional site of St. Peter&#x27;s tomb. Around this time, the name &quot;Vaticanus Mons&quot; was established in its modern usage, and the Janiculum hill was distinguished from it as the &quot;Ianiculensis Mons&quot;.

Another cemetery nearby was opened to the public on 10 October 2006 to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the Vatican Museums.

==Christian history==
The Vatican Hill was included within the city limits of Rome during the reign of Pope Leo IV, who, between 848 and 852, expanded the city walls to protect St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica and the Vatican. Thus, Vatican Hill has been within the walls and city limits of Rome for over 1100 years. Until the Lateran Treaties in 1929 it was part of the Rione of Borgo.

Before the Avignon Papacy (1305–1378), the headquarters of the Holy See were located at the Lateran Palace. After the Avignon Papacy the church administration moved to Vatican Hill and the papal palace was (until 1871) the Quirinal Palace, upon the Quirinal Hill. Since June 1929, part of the Vatican Hill is the site of the State of the Vatican City. However, the cathedral of the Bishop of Rome, the Pope, is not St. Peter&#x27;s in the Vatican, but Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano, which is extra-territorially linked, as indicated in the Lateran Pacts signed with the Italian state in February 1929, with the Holy See.

<text>Jacob van Artevelde (; c. 1290 – 17 or 24 July 1345), sometimes written in English as James van Artvelde, also known as The Wise Man and the Brewer of Ghent, was a Flemish statesman and political leader.

==Biography==

Jacob Van Artevelde was born in Ghent of a wealthy commercial family. He married twice and amassed a fortune in the weaving industry. He rose to prominence during the early stages of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Fearful that hostilities between France and England would hurt the prosperity of Ghent, he entered political life in 1337. He set up an alliance with Bruges and Ypres (later the Four Members) in order to show neutrality. Van Artevelde gained control of the insurrection against Louis I, the Count of Flanders who had abandoned his father&#x27;s anti-French policies. Louis I was forced to flee to France, while van Artevelde served as captain general of Ghent from that time until his death.

Flemish relations with England had traditionally been good, due to wool and textile trade. Neutrality was eventually broken, and the towns took the side of the English in 1340. In that year, van Artevelde persuaded the federation to recognise King Edward III of England as sovereign of France and overlord of Flanders.

Flemish trade and industry flourished under van Artevelde&#x27;s semi-dictatorial rule. In 1345, however, rumours that he planned to recognise the son of Edward III, the Black Prince, as count of Flanders, suspicion of embezzlement, and the excommunication by the Pope caused a popular uprising in Ghent, and van Artevelde was killed by an angry mob.

His son Philip van Artevelde later took up the Flemish cause and died in the Battle of Roosebeke in 1382.

==In fiction==
Artevelde is a supporting character in &quot;Les Rois maudits&quot; (&quot;The Accursed Kings&quot;), a series of French historical novels by Maurice Druon. He was portrayed by Christian Barbier in the 1972 French miniseries adaptation of the series.

<text>Connie Douglas Reeves (September 26, 1901 – August 17, 2003) was believed to be America&#x27;s oldest cowgirl.

She was the oldest member of the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame, and one of the first women to study law at a University of Texas School of Law. One of Reeves most notable quotes was &quot;Always saddle your own horse&quot;, which Liz Smith once suggested in her gossip column was &quot;not a bad motto, even if you are just getting into your Mercedes.&quot; In 1998, the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum awarded Reeves the Chester A. Reynolds Memorial Award for her contributions to the Western way of life. She was one of only two women to have earned the award; the other being Mollie Taylor Stevenson Jr., founder of the American Cowboy Museum.

==Early history==
Reeves was born in Eagle Pass, Texas to William and Ada ( Wallace) Douglas. She received her undergraduate degree in speech from Texas Woman&#x27;s University. She enrolled in the University of Texas School of Law in Austin, but was forced to withdraw and get a job to help her family during the hard economic times of the Great Depression. Reeves taught at Thomas Jefferson High School in San Antonio, where she started the &quot;Lassos&quot;, the first girl’s drill team or pep squad which is still active. She also worked part-time as a riding instructor at a local stable. She grew up around horses and was quoted as saying that she sat on a horse before she could sit up by herself.

In 1936, she joined the equestrian program at Camp Waldemar in Hunt where she taught horseback riding to girls for 67 years. It is estimated that she taught 30,000 girls how to ride at the camp.

Reeves met her husband Jack at the camp and the couple married in 1942. They also managed of ranch land owned by former President Lyndon B. Johnson where they raised sheep and cattle for more than forty years. Jack Reeves died in 1985.

==Recognition==

She was elected to the Cowgirl Hall of Fame in 1997, and rode in the parade to honor the Hall when it moved to new headquarters in Fort Worth in 2002. She was over 100 years old at the time.

==Death==
On August 5, 2003, Reeves was riding her favorite horse Dr Pepper, a spirited 28-year-old paint. According to a report by camp director, Meg Clark, the horse threw Reeves over its head. She suffered a broken neck from the fall, but was not paralyzed. The Associated Press reported that she died of cardiac arrest. Reeves had suffered several injuries over the past few years of her life, including a fractured thigh that resulted from a kick by the same horse.

Her autobiography, &quot;I Married a Cowboy: Half Century with Girls &amp; Horses at Camp Waldemar&quot;, was published in 1995. Her motto was, &quot;Always saddle your own horse.&quot;

<text>James Ford Cairns (4 October 191412 October 2003) was an Australian politician who was prominent in the Labor movement through the 1960s and 1970s, and was briefly Treasurer and the fourth deputy prime minister of Australia, both in the Whitlam government. He is best remembered as a leader of the movement against Australian involvement in the Vietnam War, for his affair with Junie Morosi and for his later renunciation of conventional politics. He was also an economist, and a prolific writer on economic and social issues, many of them self-published and self-marketed at stalls he ran across Australia after his retirement.

==Early days==

James Ford Cairns was born in Carlton, then a working-class suburb of Melbourne, the son of a clerk. He grew up on a dairy farm north of Sunbury. His father went to the World War I as a lieutenant in the Australian Imperial Forces, but became disillusioned with the war and lost his respect for Britain. He did not return to Australia. Following the war he essentially deserted his family, and he traveled to Africa where he committed suicide after a stay of six or seven years. Many years later, Cairns informed Gough Whitlam that he had long believed that his father had been killed in World War I, but that he was eventually told the truth of his father&#x27;s desertion.

Cairns attended Sunbury State School and later Northcote High School, where he completed his Leaving Certificate. Though life during the Depression was difficult with his mother having to work to provide for the family, and with himself having to make a three-hour daily commute by train, he was a good student, making his name at Northcote High School due to entering the school&#x27;s broad jump championship and winning it easily with a jump of twenty feet and two inches, his competitors producing jumps of sixteen to seventeen feet.

In 1933 Cairns joined the Police Force to have more time for athletics. He soon became a detective and gained notoriety working in a special surveillance team known as &quot;the dogs&quot; shadowing squad, where he was involved in a number of dramatic arrests. While working, he studied at night and completed an economics degree at the University of Melbourne. He was the first Victorian policeman to hold a tertiary degree. In 1939 he married Gwen Robb (died 2000), whose two sons he adopted.

Cairns left the police in 1944. Thereafter he was employed, successively, as a tutor and lecturer in the Army and as a senior lecturer in economic history, at the University of Melbourne. He was a knowledgeable economist and was considered a socialist. In 1946 he applied to join the Communist Party, but was rejected.

Following this rejection, Cairns joined the Labor Party (ALP) and became active in its left wing. The Victorian division of the ALP had by this time been infiltrated by the mostly Catholic &quot;Groupers&quot;, associated with Archbishop Mannix and B. A. Santamaria, and Cairns was a leading opponent of this group.

In 1955, when the federal Labor leader, H. V. Evatt, attacked the Groupers and brought on a major split in the Labor Party, Cairns sided with Evatt. At the 1955 election, he stood for the House of Representatives for the working-class seat of Yarra, held by the leading Grouper, Stan Keon. In what Cairns has been quoted as saying was &quot;... the most active and intense and vigorous election campaign that&#x27;s ever been run in Australia&quot;, Cairns was elected and held Yarra until 1969, when it was abolished at a redistribution. He then shifted to Lalor in Melbourne&#x27;s western suburbs. The seat had been in Labor hands since its creation in 1949, but had been taken by Liberal Mervyn Lee in 1966, as part of that year&#x27;s pro-Liberal landslide. However, a redistribution wiped out Lee&#x27;s majority and gave Labor a notional majority of six per cent. Rather than face almost certain defeat, Lee made an unsuccessful bid for the seat of Bendigo. This proved prescient, as Cairns easily won Lalor with a healthy swing.

==Leading left-winger==

In Canberra, Cairns became a leader of the left. He was a highly effective debater and was soon feared and disliked by ministers in the Liberal government of Robert Menzies, although his personal dealings with Menzies himself, who nearly always felt a healthy respect for an intelligent and principled adversary, were more cordial than might have been expected. Cairns was also disliked by many in his own party, who saw him as an ideologue whose political views were too left-wing for the Australian electorate. Like many Labor figures of his generation, Cairns spent most of his best years in opposition due to the Coalition&#x27;s unbroken run in government from 1949 to 1972.

Nevertheless, Cairns&#x27; abilities could not be denied. He completed his doctorate in economic history in 1957, and by the 1960s he was among the Labor Party&#x27;s leading figures. At this time he also lectured on Marxist and socialist history, and taught free seminars in Melbourne for working people who were unable to afford tertiary education. His first overseas trip, which he took place at this time to the US and Asia, had a great effect on him.

Early in 1967, the septuagenarian Arthur Calwell retired as Labor leader, and Cairns contested the leadership, but lost to Gough Whitlam. The following year, when Whitlam briefly offered his resignation as part of his fight against the left wing of the party, Cairns again contested the leadership. Although he again failed to win, the margin was much smaller than in the previous year, and if four ALP parliamentarians had changed their minds, Cairns would have been successful. Whitlam appointed Cairns as shadow minister for trade and industry. By this time, Cairns, like other left-wing firebrands of his generation such as Clyde Cameron and Tom Uren, strongly supported Whitlam, as they were sober enough to realise Labor would never win power again without policies that appealed to the middle class.

One of the reasons Cairns did not become leader of the Labor Party was that in the late 1960s and early 1970s his main focus was not on parliamentary politics but on leading the mass movement against the Vietnam War, to which the Menzies government had committed combat troops in 1965, and against conscription for that war. Until about 1968, most Australians supported the war. Whitlam himself was cautious about publicly committing the ALP to an explicitly anti-war stance. Opposition to Australia&#x27;s role in Vietnam was led by the Communist Party and the trade unions. After 1968, however, non-communist opposition grew, and Cairns came to see the anti-war movement as a moral crusade. During the election year of 1969, a group of men broke into Cairns’ home, assaulted him and seriously injured his wife.

In 1968, the psychiatrist John Diamond conducted a series of in-depth, psychologically probing interviews with Cairns. The interviews, which were recorded on audiotape, have been described as &quot;politically unique&quot; by one of Cairns&#x27; biographers. They were initiated by the department of Political Science at Monash University, which was interested in researching the psychological motivations of politicians, but Cairns then continued them privately with Diamond over the course of a year, finding them to be &quot;a voyage of self-discovery.&quot; Another of Cairns&#x27; biographers, Paul Strangio, had noted how, in his interview technique, Diamond successfully &quot;managed to penetrate his subject’s emotional defences.&quot;

In May 1970, Cairns, as chair of the Vietnam Moratorium Campaign, led an estimated 100,000 people in a &quot;sit-down&quot; demonstration in the streets of Melbourne. This was the largest protest in Australia until it was overtaken by the anti-Iraq war protests in February 2003. Similar protests of proportionate size took place simultaneously in other Australian cities. The predicted violence did not occur and the moral force of the, mainly young, protesters had a major effect on Australian attitudes to the war.

==Cairns in Government==
At the December 1972 election, Whitlam led the Labor Party into government for the first time in 23 years, and Cairns became Minister for Overseas Trade and Minister for Secondary Industry. He had by now shed much of his socialist ideology of earlier years, though he was still a strong believer in state planning. He got along surprisingly well with the heads of industry, although critics said this was because he was sympathetic to their requests for government assistance. During his time as Minister for Trade and Minister for Secondary Industry, Cairns undertook a number of overseas trade visits. The most successful of his overseas visits was to China which resulted in an increase in Australian trade with China from 200 million dollars before the visit to 1,000 million dollars a year after his visit. After the 1974 election, Cairns was elected Deputy Leader of the Labor Party, defeating Lance Barnard 54 votes to 42, and thus became Deputy Prime Minister.

In June, ‘’The Bulletin’’ magazine published a leaked Australian Security Intelligence Organisation document which gave a controversial, highly political view of Cairns. The political fallout from the leak led the government to act on its 1974 election policy to establish the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security.

In December 1974, Whitlam appointed Cairns as Treasurer. This was the high-point of Cairns&#x27; political career. On Christmas Day 1974, while Whitlam was overseas, Cyclone Tracy devastated the city of Darwin, and Cairns as Acting Prime Minister impressed the nation with his sympathetic and decisive leadership. It was during this period, however, that Cairns hired Junie Morosi as his principal private secretary, and he soon began a relationship with her which would eventually help ruin his career.

Australia&#x27;s already severe economic problems worsened during 1975, and Cairns had few answers to the new phenomenon of stagflation, the combination of high unemployment and high inflation that followed the 1973 oil crisis. Overseas finance ministers, especially in Britain and Europe, faced the same problems at this time, but as few Australians were exposed to the foreign media, the economic credibility of the Whitlam administration suffered.

==Loans affair==
In late 1974, in an attempt to raise funds for large capital works projects (such as drilling for gas on the north-west shelf between Australia and Timor and constructing a pipeline for transporting the gas down to Eastern Australia), senior ministers Rex Connor and Lionel Murphy, along with Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, began to consider arrangements to borrow approximately US$4,000 million petrodollars from the Middle East. The plan was to use the services of an intermediary, Pakistani banker Tirath Khemlani. Cairns first became aware of what was to become known as the &quot;Loans Affair&quot; three days after being appointed Treasurer, on 13 December 1974, when he entered at the end of a meeting of the Labor Party federal executive at the Lodge, the official residence of the Prime Minister in Canberra. Whitlam explained the situation and asked that Cairns co-sign approval for the loan. Cairns did so, noting to Whitlam that the state premiers should be informed of the loan (this did not occur). Subsequently, Sir Frederick Wheeler, Secretary of the Treasury (the head of Cairns&#x27; department) and other members of staff advised Cairns that Khemlani was of questionable character. In his capacity as Acting Prime Minister during Gough Whitlam&#x27;s overseas trip covering late 1974 to early 1975, Cairns arranged a meeting at the Reserve Bank in Canberra attended by various senior officials, including Lionel Murphy and Rex Connor. Connor&#x27;s authority to borrow the loan was cancelled as a result of the meeting. Whitlam returned from overseas on 19 January 1975 and on 27 January 1975, Connor&#x27;s authority to borrow the loan was reinstated without consultation with Cairns, who found out after the fact. A short time later, when Cairns was about to visit the United States in an official capacity, his staff informed him that if the issue of the Khemlani loan were not dealt with, it would most likely overshadow his visit. This, plus Cairns&#x27; pre-existing reservations about the loan, prompted him to discuss the issue once again with Whitlam, who then agreed that Connor&#x27;s dealings with Khemlani should come to an end. Cairns delivered the news to Connor at Whitlam&#x27;s request. Connor was later dismissed by Whitlam for continuing his unauthorised business communications with Khemlani. Whitlam moved Cairns from Treasury to the Environment ministry.

Cairns&#x27; political undoing began with an incident that is often conflated with the Connor/Khemlani dealings but was essentially separate. In 1974, Cairns was introduced by Robert Menzies to George Harris, a Melbourne businessman and president of the Carlton Football Club. Harris had offered to secure loan funds for the Australian government, and in March 1975 Cairns signed a letter agreeing to a 2.5% commission. When Cairns gave a misleading statement in June to Parliament that he had not authorised any such commission, many blamed the disorganised state of Cairns’ office. Cairns claimed that he had signed the letter in question unknowingly while signing a batch of fifty or so letters and that it was not an uncommon practice for politicians to sign letters that they had little or no memory of signing. Ironically, opposition politicians, including Malcolm Fraser and a number of his ministers, spoke out in defence of Cairns, agreeing that they too signed letters of which they had little or no memory. However, since Cairns had signed the letter, Whitlam dismissed him from the ministry on 2 July 1975. Cairns has since stated that he felt there were ulterior motives at play on the part of Gough Whitlam; namely that Whitlam wished to be rid of Cairns because Cairns did not agree with a policy of economic rationalism and that Whitlam felt that Cairns was a threat to his leadership.

==Cairns and Morosi==
In late 1974 Cairns met Junie Morosi who had worked for Al Grassby and Lionel Murphy. Morosi greatly admired Cairns from having read his academic writings and she introduced Cairns to the work of Wilhelm Reich, opening his mind to the relevance of human psychology as it related to social change. Cairns decided to offer Morosi a position as his principal private secretary and the pair began an affair.

On 2 December 1974, the media reported Cairns&#x27; employment offer to Morosi. The reports highlighted Morosi&#x27;s lack of public service experience, past business failures, her physical beauty and pointed out that she had often been seen dining in Canberra with senior Cabinet ministers. As a result, Cairns and Morosi announced that she would not take Cairns&#x27; offer of employment. The Liberal Opposition called for a senate inquiry. An investigation found there was no evidence of impropriety on the part of Morosi or of no preferential treatment being given to Morosi. On 13 December, it was reported that Morosi would accept Cairns&#x27; offer of employment.

During the Australian Labor Party&#x27;s National Conference in February 1975, Cairns gave an interview to a reporter in which he spoke of &quot;a kind of love&quot; for Morosi, reigniting the controversy. The press continued to speculate about the affair. During the 1975 National Conference, a photographer hid in a tree and waited while Morosi, her husband, Cairns, and his wife were having breakfast on a balcony. This photographer took a photo just when Cairns’ wife left the balcony and with Morosi&#x27;s husband out of shot. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; ran the picture of Cairns and Morosi the next day with the headline &quot;Breakfast with Junie&quot;. Allegations were made in the House and the Senate. Accusations of misconduct were made by a variety of institutions.

In 1982, Morosi took 2UE and The Daily Mirror to court on defamation charges, with both Cairns and Morosi denying the accusations of sexual impropriety and corruption. In the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Cairns denied under oath having had a sexual relationship with Morosi. The jury in that case found that the article in question did contain &quot;an imputation&quot; that Cairns was &quot;improperly involved with his assistant, Junie Morosi, in a romantic or sexual association&quot;, but that this statement was not defamatory. Cairns did not receive compensation, although Morosi did.

On ABC radio in September 2002, Cairns admitted for the first time that he had a sexual relationship with Junie Morosi. Four years earlier, referring to his decision to employ Morosi and the ensuing media storm that it created — Cairns said that &quot;looking back over it, it was a mistake on my part&quot;.

==Aftermath==

In 1977 Cairns retired from Parliament. He devoted the next portion of his life to the Counterculture movement, to which he had been introduced by Morosi. He sponsored a series of Down to Earth conference-festivals, known as ConFests, at various rural locations, and was photographed taking part in Counterculture inspired activities, such as meditation. In 1979, Cairns severed his formal links with the Down to Earth organizers. Cairns kept in contact with Morosi and the two remained friends.

Cairns was subject to a great deal of media ridicule for these activities, but displayed his usual firm conviction about the rightness of his causes. In his later years he lived at Narre Warren East near Melbourne. He sold his books outside suburban markets, where he would talk about politics, history or his life.

In 1983, Cairns made an unsuccessful run for the Senate as an independent and won 0.5% of the vote.
Although he had not resigned from the ALP when he made his independent Senate run, the Labor Party did not expel him and remained a party member until he let his party membership lapsed in 1991 but rejoined the party in 1996.

In 2000 he was made a Life Member of the Labor Party. Cairns died of bronchial pneumonia, aged 89, in October 2003. He was accorded a State Funeral at St John&#x27;s Anglican Church in Toorak.

==Personal life==
Cairns married Gwen Robb in 1939. He adopted Robb&#x27;s two sons by her previous marriage, Barry and Phillip when they were 4 and 5 years old respectively. Cairns claimed no religious affiliation. In a 1998 interview, he said: &quot;I have never believed myself to be anything that I can attach a name to. I was not a Christian. I did not regard myself as a humanist or a socialist. I was something: what I am, and it did not have a name&quot;.

<doc id="301107" wikidata="Q4470056" url="?curid=301107" title="Harriette Wilson">
<text>Harriette Wilson (2 February 1786 – 10 March 1845) was an English courtesan and writer. The author of &quot;The Memoirs of Harriette Wilson: Written by Herself&quot; (1825), she was a famed Regency era courtesan who became the mistress of the Earl of Craven at the age of 15. Later in her career, she went on to have formal relationship arrangements with the Duke of Wellington and other prominent people.

== Early life ==
Harriette Dubouchet&#x27;s birth at 2 Carrington Street, in Shepherd Market, Mayfair, London, was recorded in the parish register of St George, Hanover Square. Her father kept a small shop with his wife, Amelia, &quot;née&quot; Cook. Her father is said to have assumed the surname of Wilson about 1801.

One of the fifteen children of Swiss John James Dubouchet (or &quot;De Bouchet&quot;), Wilson was one of four sisters in the family who pursued careers as courtesans. Her sisters Amy, Fanny and Sophia also became courtesans. In her memoir, Wilson claims that Amy sets a poor example for the others, introducing them to their licentious reputations and careers:

We were all virtuous girls when Amy, one fine afternoon, left her father&#x27;s house and sallied forth, like Don Quixote, in quest of adventures. The first person who addressed her was one Mr. Trench; a certain short-sighted, pedantic man, whom most people know about town. I believe she told him that she was running away from her father. All I know for certain is that, when Fanny and I discovered her abode, we went to visit her, and when we asked her what on earth had induced her to throw herself away on an entire stranger whom she had never seen before, her answer was, &quot;I refused him the whole of the first day; had I done so the second he would have been in a fever.&quot;

As the sisters grew more sophisticated in their sexual and social prowess, Harriette began to observe how her eldest sister challenged her. Amy was &quot;often surnamed one of the Furies,&quot; as Wilson writes. Amy bore the Duke of Argyll&#x27;s child later in her life. The duke was one of Harriette&#x27;s former lovers, demonstrating one example of Amy &quot;stealing&quot; her younger sister&#x27;s clients. Fanny, in contrast, remained a close friend to Wilson and is described as agreeable. The youngest sister, Sophia, married respectably into the aristocracy, becoming the bride of Lord Berwick at age 17.

== Career ==
Wilson began her career at the age of fifteen, becoming the mistress of William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven, 7th Baron Craven. Among her other lovers with whom she had financial arrangements was Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, who reportedly commented &quot;publish, and be damned&quot; when informed of her plans to write her memoirs. Wilson even attracted George IV&#x27;s attention, who claimed he would &quot;do anything to suppress what Harriette had to reveal of [his mistress] Lady Conyngham&quot;.

Wilson makes a claim in her memoir about Frederick Lamb, 3rd Viscount Melbourne, assaulting her. She attributes his violent act toward her to the jealousy that she had become acquainted with the Duke of Argyll and a lover, a Lord Ponsonby. According to her account, Lamb attacked her because she refused him. For obvious reasons, most politicians with whom she had relationships paid high sums to keep their interactions with her private.

Her decision to publish was partly based on the broken promises of her lovers to provide her with an income in her older age. &quot;The Memoirs of Harriette Wilson, Written By Herself,&quot; first published in 1825, is celebrated for the opening line: &quot;I shall not say how and why I became, at the age of fifteen, the mistress of the Earl of Craven.&quot; It was reprinted by the Navarre Society in 1924, as was a follow-up title &quot;Paris Lions and London Tigers&quot; (1825) with an introduction by Heywood Hill in 1935, although how much of this latter title was the work of Harriette Wilson herself is debatable.

== Legacy ==
Despite modern speculations that Wilson was mistress to the Prince George, Prince of Wales, there is no evidence of such in her memoir. She records a time when, while still serving as a courtesan to Lord Craven, she writes a letter to the Prince of Wales: &quot;I am told that I am very beautiful, so perhaps you would like to see me.&quot; She speculates that the response from the prince requesting her visit arrives via Colonel Thomas. Indignant that the prince would request she travel to meet him, she responds:

SIR,— To travel fifty-two miles this bad weather, merely to see a man, with only the given number of legs, arms, fingers, &amp;c., would, you must admit, be madness in a girl like myself, surrounded by humble admirers who are ever ready to travel any distance for the honour of kissing the tip of her little finger; but, if you can prove to me that you are one bit better than any man who may be ready to attend my bidding, I&#x27;ll e&#x27;en start for London directly. So, if you can do anything better in the way of pleasing a lady than ordinary men, write directly: if not, adieu, Monsieur le Prince.

Wilson&#x27;s clients were politically associated with the Prince of Wales, but in her memoir she does not record meeting or bedding him. However, it is said that &quot;Wilson reminds us that the long-term mistress of the Prince of Wales, having been promised £20,000 which never materialised, died a pauper.&quot; Wilson might not have met the man or bedded him, but she was aware that the Prince of Wales, like the many other politicians, did not ultimately financially support their courtesans—and her memoir represents this controversial failing of English officeholders.

<doc id="301108" wikidata="Q271839" url="?curid=301108" title="Pan-American Highway">
<text>The Pan-American Highway is a vast network of roads that stretches approximately 30,000 kilometers (about 19,000 miles) from Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, in the northernmost part of North America to Ushuaia, Argentina, at the southern tip of South America. It is recognized as the longest road in the world and serves as a significant overland route connecting multiple countries across the Americas.

The highway traverses through 14 countries in total, including Canada, the United States, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia. Notably, no official road in the U.S. or Canada is designated as part of the Pan-American Highway; it officially begins at the U.S.-Mexico border in Nuevo Laredo. A significant interruption in the highway is the Darién Gap, a dense rainforest area between Panama and Colombia. No road traverses the Darien Gap to connect the two countries for traffic, and although ferries previously carried vehicles around the gap to service this need, no car carrying ferries have operated there in recent decades. The primary alternative is to ship a car by cargo ship from one country to the other.

==Concept of the highway==
The highway was built in stages. The first, not long after one could drive across the United States on a paved road, was the highway from Laredo, Texas, to Mexico City. The second stage was the Inter-American Highway to Panama City; previously there were no roads, and little commerce between most Central American countries. There was no road between Costa Rica and Panama until, concerned about access to the Panama Canal in a war situation, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began a highway in 1941.

The third stage, which has not been completed and may never be, continues onward to the southern tip of South America at Tierra del Fuego National Park, near Ushuaia, Argentina. Both Panama and Colombia, as well as environmentalists, are opposed to building a highway through the Darién Gap that separates the two continents.

A Cuban proposal that was not carried out was to include a &quot;circuito del Caribe&quot; (Caribbean circuit). This would have expanded the highway to Puerto Juárez, Mexico (Cancún), and from there by ferry to Pinar del Río, Cuba, from there by road to Havana, and by ferry again to Key West, Florida, and the Overseas Highway. The deterioration of relations between Cuba and the U.S. after the Cuban Revolution of 1959 ended talk of this project.

==Development and construction==

The concept of an overland route from one tip of the Americas to the other was originally proposed as a railroad. In 1884 the U.S. Congress passed a law with a plan to build an inter-American rail system. This was discussed at the First Pan-American Conference in 1889; however, construction never started. It was abandoned in concept after the independence of Panama in 1903, when work on the canal began.

The concept of building a highway, rather than a railroad, emerged at the Fifth International Conference of American States in 1923, after the automobile and other vehicles had begun to replace railroads for both passenger and goods transportation. The first conference regarding construction of the highway occurred on October 5, 1925.

Finally, on July 29, 1937, in the latter years of the Great Depression, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Canada, and the United States signed the &quot;Convention on the Pan-American Highway&quot;, whereby they agreed to achieve speedy construction, by all adequate means. Thirteen years later, in 1950, Mexico became the first Latin American country to complete its portion of the highway.

No single route in the United States (except in Alaska) has been designated, much less marked, as the U.S. portion of the Pan-American Highway. However, I-25 is labeled as the Pan-American freeway in states such as New Mexico and Colorado. According to the federal Department of Transportation, the Interstate Highway System is the United States&#x27; section of the highway. In Canada the highway is not marked. Much of the highway in Latin America is marked as or .

==Countries served==
The Northern Pan-American Highway travels through 14 countries, including in Central America:
* Canada (CANAMEX Corridor unofficial)
* United States (Interstate Highway System official)
* Mexico
* Guatemala
* El Salvador
* Honduras
* Nicaragua
* Costa Rica
* Panama
The Southern Pan-American Highway travels through five countries:
* Colombia
* Ecuador
* Peru
* Chile
* Argentina
Important spurs also connect with four other South American countries:

* Bolivia
* Brazil
* Paraguay
* Uruguay

==Northern section==

===Alaska===
The Alaska Highway through Alaska, Yukon and British Columbia is commonly considered a &quot;de facto&quot; northerly extension of the Pan-American Highway, which continues further north with the Dalton Highway in Alaska. With this route, the Pan-American Highway begins in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska near Deadhorse. Traveling south, the route follows the length of the Dalton Highway (Alaska Route 11) changing to Alaska Route 2, the Alaskan portion of the Alaska Highway, near Fairbanks, Alaska. From Fairbanks, the route follows Alaska Route 2 southeast to the Canada–United States border southeast of Northway, Alaska, and adjacent to the Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge.

===Canada===
In Canada, no particular road has been officially designated as the Pan-American Highway. The National Highway System, which includes but is not limited to the Trans-Canada Highway, is the country&#x27;s only official inter-provincial highway system. However, several Canadian highways are a natural extension of several key American highways that reach the Canada–US border. British Columbia Highway 97 and Highway 2 to Alberta both pick up where the southern end of the Alaska highway leaves off. Highway 97 becomes U.S. Route 97 at the Canada–US border. British Columbia Highway 99 provides an alternate route from Highway 97 just north of Cache Creek; it runs through Whistler and Vancouver before ending at the Canada–US border at the north end of Interstate 5 in Washington state, the beginning of the official Pan-American route south of British Columbia. Meanwhile, Alberta Highway 2 runs south and east to Alberta Highway 3 leading into Lethbridge, then south on Alberta Highway 4 to the Canada–US border, where it becomes Interstate 15 in Montana. This is the first official stretch of the Pan-American Highway south of the Alberta route, both of which are also part of the CANAMEX Corridor.
==== Yukon ====
Crossing the border into Canada, Alaska Highway 2 turns into Yukon Highway 1. The first significant settlement along the way is Beaver Creek, Yukon. At Haines Junction, where it meets Yukon Highway 3, Yukon Highway 1 turns east toward Whitehorse, the capital of the Yukon Territory.

Through most of Whitehorse, Yukon Highway 2 and Yukon Highway 1 share an alignment. Yukon Highway 1 cuts southeast toward Marsh Lake, Yukon while Yukon Highway 2 cuts south to Skagway, Alaska. Eventually, Yukon Highway 1 intersects with Yukon Highway 8 and Yukon Highway 7 at Jake&#x27;s Corner, Yukon; the Pan-American Highway continues on Yukon 1 east-northeast from this junction.

At Johnson&#x27;s Crossing, Yukon Highway 1 meets Yukon Highway 6 and travels southeast through Teslin, Yukon. The Pan-American Highway continues on Yukon 1 as it crosses over into British Columbia (B. C.). After several miles, the Highway reenters the Yukon (once again as Highway 1) and continues southeast of Watson Lake until it, once again, enters British Columbia as B.C. Highway 97.

==== British Columbia ====
After travelling about past the British Columbia–Yukon border, the Pan-American Highway reaches the first settlement in British Columbia at Lower Post. After travelling about east, the highway &quot;once again&quot; re-enters the Yukon for roughly . The Highway then re-enters British Columbia (as BC 97) for the final time. The Pan-American Highway continues south to southeast through a long uninhabited stretch until it passes through the villages of Fireside and Coal River, then runs east parallel to the Liard River.

The Pan-American Highway continues on B.C. Highway 97 as it passes through Toad River Post, and then Summit Lake, which is nested between Stone Mountain and Mount Saint George. Further down the road, B.C. Highway 97 intersects with B.C. Highway 77; the Pan-American Highway continues along B.C. 97 east to Fort Nelson.

From Fort Nelson, the Highway travels south for about until it reaches Fort St. John. It continues on B.C. Highway 97 southeast for another to reach the end of the Alaska Highway at Dawson Creek.

==== Alberta ====
After B.C Highway 97, the unofficial route becomes Alberta Highway 43. In approximately , Highway 43 enters into the first settlement Demmitt. For about , Highway 43 goes into Grande Prairie. At Clairmont, Highway 43, turns to Alberta Highway 2, Highway 43 goes left. Highway 43 goes for before reaching Edmonton. The unofficial route turns 2 ways, one way goes to Lloydminster, Minneapolis, and Dallas and merges with the second way. The second way goes to Calgary and the US border.

===Contiguous United States===
In 1966, the U.S. Federal Highway Administration designated the entire Interstate Highway System as part of the Pan-American Highway System, but this has not been expressed in any of the official interstate signage. Of the many freeways that make up this very comprehensive system, several are notable because of their mainly north–south orientation and their links to the main Mexican route and its spurs, as well as to key routes in Canada that link to the Alaska Highway.

These include the following:

* Interstate 5 runs north from San Diego, California, to Blaine, Washington, then links indirectly with British Columbia Highway 99 north of the Canada–US border. A technically direct link between the same interstate and the U.S. Route 97 system can be found near Weed, California. US Route 97 runs northeast then north through Oregon and Washington from this junction, and becomes BC Highway 97 at the border with Canada.
* Interstate 15 links San Diego with Alberta Highway 2 that eventually crosses into British Columbia and ends at the southern terminus of the Alaska Highway. Interstate 8 provides an east–west link from San Diego to Interstate 10 near Phoenix, Arizona. The latter continues to Tucson and links with Interstate 19, which becomes a spur of the Pan-American highway through Mexico at the Nogales border crossing.
* Interstate 25 runs north from Interstate 10 at Las Cruces, New Mexico, to Interstate 90 in Buffalo, Wyoming. This route has no direct extension into Canada but links indirectly to Interstate 15. Interstate 25 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, was named the Pan-American Freeway, as an extension of Highway 45, the Mexican spur linking El Paso to the original route along highway 85 north of Mexico City. This portion of I-25 largely follows the historic Camino Real, and thus serves a culturally significant portion of the Pan American system. Like I-15, the complete route of Interstate 25 is an official northerly continuation toward Alberta, where Highway 2 provides a direct but unofficial Canadian link to the Alaska Highway. 
* Interstate 35 is a northerly continuation of the original Pan-American highway following Mexican Federal Highway 85. It extends from Laredo, Texas to the Canada–United States border north of Duluth, Minnesota, with a spur, Interstate 29, that leads farther west toward Winnipeg, Manitoba. The section of Interstate 35 in San Antonio, Texas is referred to as the Pan Am Expressway by locals. I-35 is a northerly continuation of Mexico Highway 85, the original official Mexican route, ending in Duluth, Minnesota, where Minnesota State Highway 61 continues to the Canada–US border near Thunder Bay, Ontario. This route was first proposed in a 1932 bill introduced in the U.S. Congress. The Trans-Canada Highway provides a link from Winnipeg and Thunder Bay to Alberta and the Alaska Highway, but it is not officially part of the Pan-American Highway.
* U.S. Route 81 is claimed to be part of the Pan American Highway from Wichita, Kansas, to Watertown, South Dakota, where it runs separately from Interstate 29.
* An additional route only partially complete is Interstate 69, which will eventually run northeasterly from the Laredo Nuevo Laredo border crossing to the Windsor-Quebec City Corridor in Canada, where the route becomes unofficial.

===Related North American highways===

Several North American routes have names that make no direct reference to the Pan-American Highway, in part because some sections follow highways that are not up to full freeway standard.

* The CANAMEX Corridor is designated from Mexico City to the western United States from Arizona to Montana, and continues north into western Canada. Although lacking any official status for the Pan American Highway in Canada, this is the only official North American highway that runs through Canada, the U.S., and Mexico to link the Alaska Highway with the Pan-American Highway at Mexico City. Unlike corresponding Pan American routes in the American southwest, the Canamex Highway bypasses San Diego by using several non-interstate highways to provide a shortcut from I-15 at Las Vegas, Nevada to I-10 at Phoenix, Arizona for traffic accessing I-15 from the Nogales border crossing.
* The CanAm Highway follows Interstate 25 from El Paso to U.S. Route 85 north of Denver, Colorado, then continues into the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, following parts of provincial highways 35, 39, 6, 3, and 2 in succession before terminating at La Ronge. This route was first proposed during the 1920s but was never properly promoted nor developed. A section of the CanAm in southern Saskatchewan has deteriorated to the point where it is no longer a paved highway.
* The NAFTA Superhighway tag has been unofficially used in connection with Interstate 35 from Laredo, Texas to the Canadian border; there it downgrades to a non-freeway route ending at Thunder Bay, Ontario. A spur follows Interstate 29 to the border, where it also downgrades to an arterial highway that extends to Winnipeg, Manitoba. The NAFTA highway sometimes unofficially includes Interstate 69, which is mostly complete from western Kentucky to the Canada–US border at Port Huron, Michigan. In Canada, Ontario Highway 402 and other freeways in the Windsor-Quebec City Corridor can be considered a northeastward extension of this version of the NAFTA superhighway. To the southwest, from western Kentucky to the Mexican border, there is no single superhighway yet completed. Pending completion of I-69, the main highway links to Mexico follow parts of US routes 45 and 51 from Kentucky to western Tennessee, I-155 into Missouri, parts of Interstates 55 and 40 from Missouri to Arkansas, and I-30 to the Texas stretch of I-35 that continues to the Mexican border at Laredo, Texas. The section of I-69 to be completed south of Kentucky is expected eventually to continue southwestward to the Texas Gulf Coast. It will have a spur linking to the original Pan-American route through Mexico to Laredo, and additional branches extending to the Mexican spurs that cross the border at Pharr, Texas, and Brownsville, Texas.

===Mexico===
The official route of the Pan-American Highway through Mexico (where it is known as the Inter-American Highway) starts at Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas (opposite Laredo, Texas), and goes south to Mexico City along Mexican Federal Highway 85.

An alternative route begins at the border crossing between San Diego, California and Tijuana, Baja California. Interstate 5 in the United States connects to Mexican Federal Highway 1 at the busiest international border crossing in the world. The Pan-American Highway continues south to Mexico City along two separate routes; historic Mexican Federal Highway 1 and toll Mexican Federal Highway 1D via Baja California Peninsula or Mexican Federal Highway 2 via the mainland.

The Pan-American Highway (as Mexico Highway 85D) enters Mexico City, but downtown Mexico City can be bypassed using Mexico Highway 136 (a divided limited-access route) and Mexico Highway 115, which reconnects to Mexico Highway 95D south of the Mexican Federal District.

Later branches were built to the border as follows:

* Nogales spur – Mexican Federal Highway 15 from Mexico City
* El Paso spur – Mexican Federal Highway 45 from Highway 85 north of Mexico City to Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua
* Eagle Pass spur – unknown, possibly Mexican Federal Highway 57 from Mexico City to Piedras Negras, Coahuila
* Pharr spur – Mexican Federal Highway 40 from Monterrey to Reynosa, Tamaulipas
* Brownsville spur – Mexican Federal Highway 101 from Ciudad Victoria to Matamoros, Tamaulipas

From Mexico City to the border with Guatemala, the highway follows Mexican Federal Highway 190. In the inaugural Carrera Panamericana road race, organized by the Mexican government, the terminus of this southern route was said to be at Ciudad Cuauhtémoc, Chiapas, at the Guatemalan border.

Specifically, as the Pan-American Highway continues south of Mexico City, it runs through the city of Cuernavaca about south of the Mexican capital. Here, the Pan-American Highway heads east along Federal Highway 190 through the state of Puebla; for about , it is a limited-access divided highway. The route then reverts to an undivided highway and enters the state of Oaxaca. From Huajuapan de León to the Oaxaca state capital of Oaxaca is about .

From the city of Oaxaca, the Highway continues southeast as Mexico Highway 190 for about to the village of Juchitán de Zaragoza. The Pan-American Highway is now in southern Mexico, which is a combination of small mountains, hills, and jungles. It is another to the border with the state of Chiapas where the Highway crosses the Continental Divide. From the Oaxaca-Chiapas state border, it is to the Chiapas state capital of Tuxtla Gutiérrez. The Highway then crosses the Mexico-Guatemala border at Ciudad Cuauhtémoc.

===Central America===

The Pan-American (or Inter-American) highway passes through the Central American countries with the highway designation of CA-1 (Central American Highway 1). Belize was supposedly included in the route at one time, after it switched to driving on the right. Prior to independence, as British Honduras, it was the only Central American country to drive on the left side of the road.

====Guatemala====
Upon crossing into Guatemala, Mexico Highway 190 becomes Central America Highway 1 and continues for about from the border village of La Mesilla to the city of Huehuetenango near the Maya ruins of Zaculeu. The Pan-American Highway crosses the Continental Divide again, and into the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes mountains.

From Huehuetenango to Chimaltenango is roughly with Mayan ruins at Iximché, just north of Tecpán Guatemala. From Chimaltenango, it is about to Guatemala City, the capital and largest city in Central America.

From Guatemala City to Cuilapa is about and another to Jutiapa. The highway continues as CA Highway 1 and approaches the border with El Salvador. It is to the border crossing at San Cristobal Frontera.

In Guatemala, the Pan-American highway passes through 10 departments, including The Department Of Guatemala, where it passes through Guatemala City.

====El Salvador====
El Salvador is the smallest country (by area) along the route of the Pan-American Highway. After crossing into El Salvador at Candelaria de la Frontera, the Inter-American Highway continues on toward Santa Ana as Central America Highway 1. From the border crossing to Santa Ana is about .

From Santa Ana it is about to San Salvador, El Salvador&#x27;s capital and largest city. At Nueva San Salvador, the highway passes near the Volcano de San Salvador.

From San Salvador to Cojutepeque is about ; following the highway southeast to San Miguel is about . From San Miguel to the El Salvador-Honduras border is about .

In El Salvador, the highway also passes through the cities of, Santa Tecla, Antiguo Cuscatlán, and San Martín.

====Honduras====
The highway crosses the border into Honduras at El Amatillo near Nacaome ( from border). Just past Nacaome is a highway traveling north to Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras. Traveling south, it is to Choluteca, the fourth-largest city in Honduras. From Choluteca to the border crossing, just past San Marcos de Colón, is about . The Pan-American Highway&#x27;s total distance in Honduras is about .

====Nicaragua====
From Honduras, it passes into Nicaragua at El Espino, passing through the Nicaraguan cities of Somoto, Estelí, Sebaco, Managua, Jinotepe, and Rivas before entering Costa Rica at Peñas Blancas.

From the crossing at the Honduras-Nicaragua border, the highway continues as Central America Highway 1 to the town of Ocotal, about . From Ocotal to Estelí is about , and on to the village of Sébaco is about . At this point, the Inter-American Highway turns from southeast to south towards Ciudad Darío, which is from Sébaco. From Ciudad Dario to the village of San Benito is .

From San Benito, it is about to the Nicaraguan capital and largest city of Managua, on the shores of Lake Managua. From Managua south to the town of Jinotepe is about , and Jinotepe to the town of Rivas is about . Around this area the Highway is in view of Lake Nicaragua, which is the largest lake in Central America. From Rivas to the Nicaragua-Costa Rica border is about .

====Costa Rica====
In Costa Rica, the Pan-American Highway is known as (Inter-American Highway) and is composed of two segments Carretera Interamericana Norte (Route 1) and Carretera Interamericana Sur (Route 2).

It passes through Liberia, San José, Cartago, Pérez Zeledón, Palmares, Neily, before crossing into Panama at Paso Canoas.

The highest point in the entire Pan-American Highway occurs at the Cerro de la Muerte (Death Hill) in the Carretera Interamericana Sur segment, at .

An alternative route used by cross country buses and freight transportation that avoids crossing through the Greater Metropolitan Area and Cerro de la Muerte, is by taking Route 23 in Puntarenas canton from Route 1, then Route 27 and Route 34, and taking Route 2 in Osa canton.

After entering Costa Rica, the Highway separates two national parks, the Santa Rosa National Park to the west and Guanacaste National Park to the east. From the Nicaragua-Costa Rica border to the town of Liberia is about . In the region of Costa Rica, the Pan-American Highway runs just west of the Cordillera de Guanacaste (Guanacaste Mountains), which includes the active volcanoes of Rincón de la Vieja and Miravalles. While travelling through Costa Rica north of San Jose, the highway route is known as Costa Rica Highway 1 instead of CA Highway 1. From San Jose south to Panama, the highway route is known as Costa Rica Highway 2.

Liberia to the town of Barranca is from Barranca, the Cordillera de Tilarán (Tilarán Mountains) can be seen from the Inter-American Highway. The Tilarán range includes Arenal, one of the world&#x27;s most active volcanoes. From Barranca, the highway heads east across the mountains and the Continental Divide once again. From Barranca, it is roughly to the town of Alajuela.

After Alajuela the Cordillera Central (Central Mountains) come into view from the Inter-American Highway. The Central Mountains include four large volcanoes--Poás, Barva, Irazú and Turrialba. From Alajuela to San José is about 

San José is the capital and largest city in Costa Rica. Leaving San José, the Inter-American Highway winds its way roughly southeast. From San José to San Isidro de El General is about 

From San Isidro, the Cordillera de Talamanca (Talamanca Mountains) rise up from the rain forest canopy. The Talamanca range, which is non-volcanic, includes Cerro Chirripó, Costa Rica&#x27;s highest mountain peak at . From San Isidro to Palmar Sur is roughly , and Palmar Sur to the Costa Rica-Panama border is about 91.9 km (57.1 mi).

====Panama====

From the Costa Rica-Panama border to La Concepción, the highway length is approximately , from La Concepción to David the distance is . The highway enters Panama traveling generally from west to east.

David, the capital of the Chiriqui Province, is located about north of the town of Pedregal and the Gulf of Chiriquí. From David, the highway travels east about to Tolé. From Tolé to the town of Santiago the distance is approximately . About halfway to Santiago, the Pan-American Highway crosses over the San Pablo river.

From Santiago to Aguadulce, the Pan American Highway travels , where it reenters the tropical lowlands. From Aguadulce to Penonomé it stretches about . This section of highway crosses the Santa María river.

From Penonomé, the highway travels southeast, then northeast, then roughly north in a loop as it avoids crossing into Panama&#x27;s Central Mountains. From Penonomé to La Chorerra the distance is , while from La Chorerra, the distance is to Balboa just west of Panama City.

Panama City is the capital and largest city in Panama. Before entering the city, the Pan-American Highway crosses over the Panama Canal on the Centennial Bridge, From Panama City, the Highway turns northeast. From Panama City to Chepo the highest is roughly , from Chepo to Cañita is another .

At the village of Cañita is the old terminus of the northern route of the Pan-American Highway. The highway continues another past Cañita to the village of Yaviza, a village near the junction of the Tuira and Chucunaque rivers. It is here that officially Pan- American Highway ends. Southeast of here is the virtually impenetrable Darién Gap, a stretch of rugged, mountainous jungle terrain. It is now being extended 6 km to Pinogana, which will include a bridge over the Chucunaque River. The road had formerly ended at Cañita, Panama, north of its current end.

United States government funding was particularly significant to complete the high-level Bridge of the Americas over the Panama Canal, during the years when the canal was administered by the United States.

==Darién Gap==

The Pan-American Highway is interrupted between Panama and Colombia by a stretch of marshland known as the Darién Gap. The highway terminates at Turbo, Colombia, and Yaviza, Panama. Because of swamps, marshes, and rivers, construction would be very expensive. One can cross through on foot, but it is both very difficult and very dangerous.

Efforts have been made for decades to eliminate the gap in the Pan-American highway, but have been controversial. Planning began in 1971 with the help of United States funding, but this was halted in 1974 after concerns raised by environmentalists. Another effort to build the road began in 1992, but by 1994 a United Nations agency reported that the road, and the subsequent development, would cause extensive environmental damage. The Embera-Wounaan and Kuna have also expressed concern that the road could bring about the potential erosion of their cultures.

The Darién Gap has challenged adventurers for many years. A 1962 expedition with three Chevrolet Corvair rear-engine cars and two support trucks completed the trip south from Chicago through to the Colombian border. A 1971–72 British expedition from Alaska to Argentina attempted to transit the Gap with two standard production Range Rovers, supported by a team of Land Rovers. They barely succeeded in thrashing a passage through the extreme terrain. In 1979, a team led by Mark Smith drove standard production CJ7-model Jeeps from South to North, traversing the Gap with difficulty. In 1984, Loren and Patty Upton made the first &quot;all land&quot; vehicle crossing of the Gap using a 1966 Jeep CJ-5 named Sand Ship Discovery. It took months of slogging, winching, chopping, and digging their way through the inhospitable jungles of the Darién Gap.

One proposed option to bridge the gap is a short ferry link from Colombia to a new ferry port in Panama, with an extension of the existing Panama highway that would complete the highway without violating these environmental concerns. However, past attempts to operate such a service have ended in failure.

==Southern section==
===Colombia and Venezuela===
The southern part of the highway begins in Turbo, Colombia, from where it follows Colombia Highway 62 to Medellín. On Google Maps, the beginning of the highway is at a marker at the end of a road built out to a place along the proposed extended highway in the flatlands 11 miles from the Atrato River and 20 miles frm the main highway called &quot;El Cuarenta&quot; or &quot;Lomas Aisladas&quot; (&quot;Isolated hills&quot;), which has a marker &quot;Inicio del tramo sur de la carretera Panamericana&quot; (&quot;Start of the southern section of the Pan-American Highway&quot;). At Medellín, Colombia Highway 56 leads to Bogotá, but Colombia Highway 25 turns south for a more direct route. Colombia Highway 40 is routed southwest from Bogotá to join Highway 25 at Zarzal. Highway 25 continues all the way to the border with Ecuador.

Travelers along the Inter-American Highway portion of the Pan-American Highway in Panama can take a ferry from Panama City to the port of Buenaventura, which is 115 km northwest of Cali. Cali represents a major junction between Buenaventura and two northern spurs of the Pan-American Highway that connect from northern Colombia and Venezuela.

The main route of the Pan-American Highway in Colombia (starting from the northeast) begins just east of Cúcuta, the capital city of the department of Norte de Santander. The highway follows Colombia Route 55 for 63 km from Cúcuta to Pamplona, where it shifts to Colombia Route 66 for 45 km to reach the border with the department of Santander.

From the department border, Route 66 continues southwest for 50 km toward Bucaramanga, state capital of Santander located on a plateau in the Cordillera Oriental. From Bucaramanga, the Pan-American Highway switches from Route 66 to Colombia Route 45A, which it follows south by southwest to the town of Barbosa. This 203-km stretch on Route 45A is a toll road. Approximately 26 km of this stretch of highway enters the department of Boyacá and reenters Santander between Vado Real and Guepsa. From Barbosa, the Pan-American Highways switches from Route 45A to Colombia Route 62 and immediately reenters Boyacá towards Tunja, the state capital of Boyacá.

A 53-km stretch of highway connects Barbosa with Tunja, an important agriculture and mining center in the region. The Pan-American Highway switches routes again in Tunja, returning to Colombia Route 55 on its way to Cundinamarca and the national capital, Bogotá. The stretch of highway from Tunja to the departmental border with Cundinamarca is 54 km and is a toll road. From the Cundinamarca departmental line, the highway continues another 26 km without tolls before becoming a toll road again. From that point, the highway reaches Bogotá in 52 km. 

In Bogotá, the highway crosses from the north to the southwest portion of the city, switching from Route 55 to Colombia Route 40. Continuing as a toll road from Bogotá, it travels for 128 km through Fusagasugá to the departmental border with Tolima.

From the Tolima departmental border, the highway continues as a toll road for another 16 km to El Espinal. It travels west and after another 37 km, reaches the city of Ibagué. From Ibagué to the Quindío departmental border near La Linea is about 77 km.

Upon crossing into Quindío, Colombia Route 40 continues westward for another 4 km before reaching Calarcá, where Route 40 splits into two spurs. One enters Armenia. The spurs rejoin about 18 km southwest of Calarcá at the town of Club Campestre. From Club Campestre, it covers another 16 km until reaching the Valle del Cauca departmental border.

From the border, the Pan-American Highway travels 26 km to the town of La Paila, where it crosses Colombia Route 25. At this junction, the two routes merge and become a toll road for 61 km from that point to Buga. At Buga, Route 40 splits west toward the city of Buenaventura and the Pacific Ocean; the Pan-American Highway continues south on Route 25 for another 42 km until arriving near Palmira. From Palmira, the highway continues southwest for 23 km, where it reaches the large city of Cali. From Cali to the Cauca departmental border is 19 km.

The highway continues south along Route 25 throughout its length in the department of Cauca. After 50 km, the highway becomes a toll road at Santander de Quilichao until reaching Santander de Quilichao and Popayán after 74 km. It continues generally southwest from Popayán; reaching Mojarras after 135 km. At Mojarras, Route 25 splits into two spurs; the western spur is preferred for traveling south toward the Nariño departmental border. From Mojarras to the departmental border near Remolino is 36 km.

From the Nariño departmental border, the highway continues south as Route 25. From the border to the city of Pasto is 84 km. From Pasto to the national border between Colombia and Ecuador near Ipiales is 82 km. The Pan American crosses the border at the Rumichaca Bridge.

==== Simón Bolívar Highway ====
Another route, known as the Simón Bolívar Highway, runs from Bogotá (Colombia) to La Guaira (Venezuela). It begins by using Colombia Highways 55 &amp; 66 all the way to the border with Venezuela. From there it uses Venezuela Highway 1 to Caracas and Venezuela Highway 9 to its end at La Guaira.

The road ends at Venezuela Highway 9 in Güiria, a small town in the state of Sucre just west of Trinidad along the Gulf of Paria coastline. From Güiria, the highway winds west towards the town of Yaguaraparo.

Once the highway reaches Yaguaraparo, on the southern portion of the Paria Peninsula along the Gulf of Paria, Highway 9 continues west for approximately to the towns of Casanay and Pantoño.

Upon reaching Casanay, the highway crosses Venezuela Highway 10, a major north–south highway. From Casanay and neighboring Pantoño, it continues west, paralleling the Gulf of Cariaco. The highway crosses Secondary Highway 2 at Villa Frontado, which travels south into the state of Monagas. The distance from Casanay to Cumaná is about . From Cumaná, the road travels southwest approximately 65 km to the border with the state of Anzoátegui.

After crossing into Anzoátegui, it almost immediately enters the city of Barcelona.
Travelling from Barcelona and nearby Puerto La Cruz, the highway continues westward. For about 47 km, it becomes a limited-access expressway, returning to a two-lane highway at Puerto Píritu. The highway travels another 62 km reaches the border with the state of Miranda at the town of Boca de Uchire. This portion includes a short run through the &quot;llanos&quot;, or Venezuelan savannas.

About 34 km west of Boca de Uchire, the highway starts climbing up the Cordillera Central, in the Andes mountains. Highway 9 begins here to move further away from the Caribbean Sea coastline. From Boca de Uchire to El Guapo the distance is 65 km; from El Guapo to Caucagua adds 59 km.

At Caucagua, the Pan-American Highway crosses Venezuela Highway 12. Highway 9 continues through the Cordillera Central. After about 21 km, the highway becomes a limited-access expressway for 32 km west towards the Caracas metropolitan area and the Venezuelan Federal District.

Maracay is the capital city of Aragua state in central Venezuela. It was officially established on March 5, 1701, by Bishop Diego de Baños y Sotomayor in the valleys of Tocopio and Tapatapa (what is known today as the central valley of Aragua) in northern Venezuela. From Maracay the highway extends about 44 km to Valencia, passing San Joaquin and near Cuacara en route to the city.

Valencia is the capital city of Carabobo state. In Valencia, the highway shifts northwest and passes through mountains that are part of the Sistema Coriano. The distance between Valencia and the small town of El Palito on the Caribbean Sea is approximately 40 km. At El Palito, the road joins with Venezuela Highway 3 for 10 km, then splits off at Morón. The distance from Morón to the state border with Yaracuy state and the village of Guaremal is about 20 km.

From Guaremal to San Felipe, the major city in Yaracuy, is about 26 km. The city itself is located on a route adjacent to Highway 1. The road runs 73 km from San Felipe to the state border with Lara (located just past the town of Cambural). The distance from the border to Barquisimeto is about 16 km.

From Barquisimeto, Highway 1 continues roughly west, then southwest (at around Agua Salada) for 147 km to the state line with Trujillo, near El Empedrado.

Once in the state of Trujillo (near the town of Parajá), the Pan-American Highway continues in a southwest direction; it does not travel through the state capital city of Trujillo but connects to Trujillo by way of state highways 3 and 1. The highway&#x27;s length in this state is about 111 km.

The highway enters Mérida state near Arapuey. As in Trujillo, the highway does not travel through the major population centers, of which the largest is Mérida. Highway 1 connects to Mérida via an 88 km stretch of Mérida state highway 4. The highway covers 104 km in Mérida.

Upon entering the state of Táchira, the high extends about 58 km from the border to the junction with Venezuela Highway 6. From the junction to the city of San Cristóbal the distance is 44 km, although there is a separate expressway that parallels the Pan-American Highway along this stretch. From San Cristóbal to the Venezuela-Colombia border, near San Antonio de Táchira, the distance is 32 km.

===Peru, Ecuador and Chile===

Ecuador Highway 35 runs the whole length of the country.Ecuador Highway 35, the &quot;Troncal de la Sierra&quot; (Highland&#x27;s Road), is commonly known to Ecuadorians as &quot;La Panamericana&quot; and forms Ecuador&#x27;s contribution to the project. It connects cities and towns from the Sierra region, from Tulcán at the north (border with Colombia), passing through Quito, the country&#x27;s capital, to the southern border with Peru. Part of this highway is a toll-road administered by Panavial, a private concessionary. The road condition is quite good, but it mostly goes through mountains and it has some bad trails around the province of Cañar (center of the country), making it a fairly dangerous road to drive on.

The Ecuadorian portion begins at the Colombian border in Carchi province and almost immediately enters the city of Tulcán, the capital of Carchi province. From Tulcán, the road continues south for 125 km, reaching Ibarra. From Ibarra, the highway continues south for 115 km until reaching Quito. From Quito, the highway continues south for 89 km next reaching Latacunga.

From Latacunga, the Pan-American Highway continues south for 47 km to Ambato. From Ambato, the road continues south for 52 km to Riobamba. Azogues is the capital of Cañar Province. From Azogues the road becomes six lanes wide (three north, three south) built in 1995, until it reaches Cuenca.

From north of the city the Pan-American Highway takes the name of Avenida Circunvalación Sur (Avenue South Ring) until exiting to the south, where it shrinks to two lanes (one north, one south) enlarged in 2009 until reaching Loja.

Peru Highway 1 carries the Pan-American Highway all the way through Peru to the border with Chile. The northern terminus of the highway is located in Aguas Verdes (Tumbes Region) at the border with Ecuador. Starting in this point, the highway is known as &quot;Carretera Panamericana Norte&quot; (&quot;North Pan-American Highway&quot;) until it reaches a point located in central Lima, the country&#x27;s capital.

From this point south the highway is called &quot;Carretera Panamericana Sur&quot; (&quot;South Pan-American Highway&quot;), until it reaches the southern border, located in the Santa Rosa Border Post (36 km south of Tacna, the highway&#x27;s closest major city), in the Tacna Region at the border with Chile.

From Lima to Cañete 148 km

In Chile, the highway follows Chile Route 5 south to (Llaillay), a point north of Santiago, where the highway splits into two parts, one of which goes through Chilean territory to Puerto Montt, where it splits again, to Quellón on Chiloé Island, and to its continuation as the &quot;Carretera Austral&quot;. The other part goes east along Chile Route 60, which goes through the Andes to the Christ the Redeemer Tunnel, inside the Los Libertadores Pass. The Chilean-Argentinian border is located in the middle of the tunnel.

=== Argentina and Paraguay ===


In Argentina, the Argentina National Route 7 starts in the Christ the Redeemer tunnel, and continues to Buenos Aires, the end of the main highway. The highway network also continues south of Buenos Aires along Argentina National Route 3 towards the city of Ushuaia in Tierra del Fuego. Another branch, from Buenos Aires to Asunción in Paraguay, heads out of Buenos Aires on Argentina National Route 9. It switches to Argentina National Route 11 at Rosario, which crosses the border with Paraguay right at Asunción. Other branches probably exist across the center of South America.

===Brazil and Uruguay===

A continuation of the Pan-American Highway to the Brazilian cities of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro uses a ferry from Buenos Aires to Colonia in Uruguay and Uruguay Highway 1 to Montevideo. Uruguay Highway 9 and Brazil Highway 471 route to near Pelotas, from where Brazil Highway 116 leads to Brazilian main cities.

===Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana===

The highway does not have official segments to Belize, Guyana, Suriname (there known in ), and French Guiana, nor to any of the island nations in the Americas. However, highways from Venezuela link to Brazilian Trans-Amazonian highway that provides a southwest entrance to Guyana, route to the coast, and follow a coastal route through Suriname to French Guiana.

==West Indies section==

Plans have been discussed for including the West Indies in the Pan American Highway system. According to these, a system of ferries would be established to connect terminal points of the highway. Travelers would then be able to ferry from Key West to Havana, drive to the eastern tip of Cuba, ferry to Haiti, drive through Haiti and the Dominican Republic, and ferry again to Puerto Rico. Included in this system would also be a ferry from the western tip of Cuba to the Yucatán Peninsula. Mexico has already surveyed a route which will run across the Yucatán, Campeche, and Chiapas to San Cristobal de Las Casas, on the Pan American Highway.
(&quot;The Pan American Highway System&quot; by Travel Division Pan American Union, Washington D.C. October 1947)

==Art and culture==

Travel writer Tim Cahill wrote a book, &quot;Road Fever&quot;, about his record-setting 24-day drive from Ushuaia in the Argentine province of Tierra del Fuego to Prudhoe Bay in the U.S. state of Alaska with professional long-distance driver Garry Sowerby, much of their route following the Pan-American Highway.

In the British motoring show &quot;Top Gear&quot;, the presenters drove on a section of the road in their off-road vehicles in the Bolivian Special.

In 2003, Kevin Sanders, a long-distance rider, broke the Guinness World Record for the fastest traversal of the highway by motorcycle in 34 days.

In 2018, British cyclist Dean Stott, who had planned on riding the length of the Americas in 110 days to set a new Guinness World Record, completed the journey in just under 100 days, riding south-to-north, breaking the record, set by Mexico&#x27;s Carlos Santamaría Covarrubias in 2015, by 17 days. Stott was inspired to push the timetable after learning that he and his wife had been invited to the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, and would have missed the event had he stuck to his original schedule. Stott&#x27;s record lasted just a couple of months, as Austrian endurance cyclist Michael Strasser, riding north-to-south, broke the record with a time of 84 days, 11 hours and 50 minutes (July 23 – October 16, 2018).

In 2024, American endurance cyclist Bond Almand IV broke Strasser&#x27;s record, riding north-to-south in 75 days, 17 hours, and 55 minutes (August 31 – November 15, 2024).

<text>Fluid replacement or fluid resuscitation is the medical practice of replenishing bodily fluid lost through sweating, bleeding, fluid shifts or other pathologic processes. Fluids can be replaced with oral rehydration therapy (drinking), intravenous therapy, rectally such as with a Murphy drip, or by &quot;hypodermoclysis&quot;, the direct injection of fluid into the subcutaneous tissue. Fluids administered by the oral and hypodermic routes are absorbed more slowly than those given intravenously.

==By mouth==

Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is a simple treatment for dehydration associated with diarrhea, particularly gastroenteritis/gastroenteropathy, such as that caused by cholera or rotavirus. ORT consists of a solution of salts and sugars which is taken by mouth. For most mild to moderate dehydration in children, the preferable treatment in an emergency department is ORT over intravenous replacement of fluid.

It is used around the world, but is most important in the developing world, where it saves millions of children a year from death due to diarrhea—the second leading cause of death in children under five.

==Intravenous==


Similar precaution should be taken in administration of resuscitation fluid as to drug prescription. Fluid replacement should be considered as part of the complex physiological in the human body. Therefore, fluid requirements should be adjusted from time to time in those who are severely ill.

In severe dehydration, intravenous fluid replacement is preferred, and may be lifesaving. It is especially useful where there is depletion of fluid both in the intracellular space and the vascular spaces.

Fluid replacement is also indicated in fluid depletion due to hemorrhage, extensive burns and excessive sweating (as from a prolonged fever), and prolonged diarrhea (cholera).

During surgical procedures, fluid requirement increases by increased evaporation, fluid shifts, or excessive urine production, among other possible causes. Even a small surgery may cause a loss of approximately 4 ml/kg/hour, and a large surgery approximately 8 ml/kg/hour, in addition to the basal fluid requirement.

The table to the right shows daily requirements for some major fluid components. If these cannot be given enterally, they may need to be given entirely intravenously. If continued long-term (more than approx. 2 days), a more complete regimen of total parenteral nutrition may be required.

===Types===
Resuscitation fluid can be broadly classified into: albumin solution, semisynthetic colloids, and crystalloids.

The types of intravenous fluids used in fluid replacement are generally within the class of volume expanders. Physiologic saline solution, or 0.9% sodium chloride solution, is often used because it is isotonic, and therefore will not cause potentially dangerous &quot;fluid shifts&quot;. Also, if it is anticipated that blood will be given, normal saline is used because it is the only fluid compatible with blood administration.

Blood transfusion is the only approved fluid replacement capable of carrying oxygen; some oxygen-carrying blood substitutes are under development.

Lactated Ringer&#x27;s solution is another isotonic crystalloid solution and it is designed to match most closely blood plasma. If given intravenously, isotonic crystalloid fluids will be distributed to the intravascular and interstitial spaces.

Plasmalyte is another isotonic crystalloid.

Blood products, non-blood products and combinations are used in fluid replacement, including colloid and crystalloid solutions. Colloids are increasingly used but they are more expensive than crystalloids. A systematic review found no evidence that resuscitation with colloids, instead of crystalloids, reduces the risk of death in patients with trauma or burns, or following surgery.

===Maintenance===
Maintenance fluids are used in those who are currently normally hydrated but unable to drink enough to maintain this hydration. In children isotonic fluids are generally recommended for maintaining hydration. Potassium chloride and dextrose should be included. The amount of maintenance IV fluid required in 24 hours is based on the weight of the patient using the Holliday-Segar formula. For weights ranging from 0 to 10 kg, the caloric expenditure is 100 cal/kg/day; from 10 to 20 kg the caloric expenditure is 1000 cal plus 50 cal/kg for each kilogram of body weight more than 10; over 20 kg the caloric expenditure is 1500 cal plus 20 cal/kg for each kilogram more than 20. More complex calculations (e.g., those using body surface area) are rarely required.

===Procedure===
It is important to achieve a fluid status that is good enough to avoid low urine production. Low urine output has various limits, and varies for children, infants, and adults (see low urine production). The Parkland formula is not perfect and fluid therapy will need to be titrated to hemodynamic values and urine output.

The speed of fluid replacement may differ between procedures. For example, the planning of fluid replacement for burn patients is based on the Parkland formula (4mL Lactated Ringers X weight in kg X % total body surface area burned = Amount of fluid ( in ml) to give over 24 hours). The Parkland formula gives the minimum amount to be given in 24 hours. Half of the volume is given over the first eight hours after the time of the burn (not from time of admission to hospital) and the other half over the next 16 hours. In dehydration, 2/3 of the deficit may be given in 4 hours, and the rest during approximately 20 hours.

==Clinical uses==
===Septic shock===
Fluid replacement in patients with septic shock can be divided into four stages as shown below:
* Resuscitation phase - The goal of this phase is to correct the hypotension. Intravenous crystalloid is the first choice of therapy. Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends 30 ml/kg fluid resuscitation in this phase. Earlier fluid resuscitation is associated with improved survival. Mean arterial pressure should be targeted at more than 65 mmHg. Meanwhile, for early goal directed therapy (EGDT), fluids should be administered within the first six hours of septic shock until central venous pressure (CVP) reaches between 8 and 12 mmHg, with improvement of blood lactate levels, central venous oxygen saturation &gt; 70%, and urine output ≥ 0.5 ml/kg/hour. Higher mean arterial pressures can be used in patients with chronic hypertension in order to reduce the usage of renal replacement therapy. However, if fluid replacement is inadequate in raising blood pressure, then vasopressor have to be used. However, there is no definite timing of starting vasopressors. Initiation of vasopressors within the first hour of sepsis can lead to poor organ perfusion and poor organ function. Late initiation of vasopressor can lead to organ damage and increase the risk of death. Frequent monitoring of fluid status of the patient is required to prevent fluid overload.
* Optimisation phase - In this phase, the goal is to increase the oxygen delivery to tissues in order to meet the oxygen demands of the tissues. Oxygen delivery can be improved by increasing stroke volume of the heart (through fluid challenge), haemoglobin concentration (through blood transfusion), and arterial oxygen saturation (through oxygen therapy). Fluid challenge is the procedure of giving large amounts of fluid in a short period of time. However, 50% of patients do not respond to fluid challenge. Additional fluid challenges only causes fluid overload. However, there is no gold standard on determining the fluid responsiveness. Among other ways of determining the fluid responsiveness and the end point of fluid resuscitation are: Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2), passive leg raising test, ultrasound measurements of pulse pressure variation, stroke volume variation, and respiratory variations at superior vena cava, inferior vena cava and internal jugular vein.
* Stabilisation phase - In this stage, the tissue perfusion starts to stabilise and the need of fluid or vasopressors starts reducing. Additional fluid challenges can be given only for those who are responsive. Maintenance fluid can be stopped if the perfusion status is adequate.
* Evacuation phase - In this phase, the goal is to remove excessive fluids from those who achieved adequate tissue perfusion. Negative fluid balance is associated with decreased risk of death. However, there is no consensus regarding the optimal timing for fluid removal and risk of reduced perfusion following fluid removal is also inconclusive. A reasonable approach is to begin fluid restriction when the tissue perfusion is adequate, and consider diuretic treatment for those with clinical evidence of fluid overload and positive fluid balance. According to Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial (FACTT Trial) protocol, those who with mean arterial pressure of more than 60 mmHg, vasopressor free for more than 12 hours, with adequate urine output can be given furosemide to target central venous pressure less than 4 mmHg and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) of less than 8 mmHg. The levels of Brain natriuretic peptide can also be used to guide fluid removal.

=== Acute kidney injury ===
Sepsis accounts for 50% of acute kidney injury patients in (intensive care unit) (ICU). Intravenous crystalloid is recommended as the first line therapy to prevent or to treat acute kidney injury (AKI) when compared to colloids as colloids increases the risk of AKI. 4% human albumin may be used in cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis as it can reduce the rate of kidney failure and improve survival. However, fluid overload can exacerbate acute kidney injury. The use of diuretics does not prevent or treat AKI even with the help of renal replacement therapy. The 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines stated that diuretics should not be used to treat AKI, except for the management of volume overload. In acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), conservative fluid management is associated with better oxygenation and lung function with less prevalence of dialysis in the first 60 days of hospitalization when compared with liberal fluid management.

=== Surgery (perioperative fluid therapy) ===
Managing fluids during major surgical procedures is an important aspect of surgical care. The goal of fluid therapy is to maintain fluid and electrolyte levels and restore levels that may be depleted. Intravenous fluid therapy is used when a person cannot control their own fluid intake and it can also reduce nausea and vomiting. Goal-directed fluid therapy is a perioperative strategy in which the person is administered fluids continuously and the amount of fluids given are based on the person&#x27;s physiological and haemodynamic (blood flow) measurements. A second approach to fluid management during surgical procedures is called perioperative restrictive fluid therapy, also known as near-zero or zero-balance perioperative fluid approach; this approach recommends lower amounts of fluids during surgery, replacing fluids when the person is low (basal fluid requirements) or loses fluid due to a surgical procedure or bleed. The effectiveness of goal-directed fluid therapy compared to restrictive fluid therapy is not clear as evidence comparing both approaches have very low certainty.

==Fluid overload==
Fluid overload is defined as an increase in body weight of over 10%. Aggressive fluid resuscitation can lead to fluid overload which can lead to damage of multiple organs: cerebral oedema, which leads to delirium; pulmonary oedema and pleural effusion, which lead to respiratory distress; myocardial oedema and pericardial effusion, which lead to impaired contractility of the heart; gastrointestinal oedema, which leads to malabsorption; hepatic congestion, which leads to cholestasis and acute kidney injury; and tissue oedema, which leads to poor wound healing. All these effects can cause disability and death, and increase in hospitalisation costs.

Fluid overload causes cardiac dilation, which leads to increased ventricular wall stress, mitral insufficiency and leads to cardiac dysfunction. Pulmonary hypertension can lead to tricuspid insufficiency. Excess administration of fluid causes accumulation of extracellular fluid, leading to pulmonary oedema and lack of oxygen delivery to tissues. The use of mechanical ventilation in such case can cause barotrauma, infection, and oxygen toxicity, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Fluid overload also stretches the arterial endothelium, which causes damage to the glycocalyx, leading to capillary leakage and worsens the acute kidney injury.

==Other treatments==
Proctoclysis, an enema, is the administration of fluid into the rectum as a hydration therapy. It is sometimes used for very ill persons with cancer. The Murphy drip is a device by means of which this treatment may be performed.

<doc id="301116" wikidata="Q6849343" url="?curid=301116" title="Mike Yarwood">
<text>Michael Edward Yarwood (14 June 1941 – 8 September 2023) was an English impressionist, comedian and actor. He was one of Britain&#x27;s top-rated entertainers, regularly appearing on television from the 1960s to the 1980s.

==Early life==
Michael Edward Yarwood was born on 14 June 1941 in Bredbury, Cheshire. After leaving secondary modern school, he worked as a messenger and then a salesman at a garment warehouse. He played football as a child and tried out for the professional team Oldham Athletic. Later he was a director of Stockport County Football Club.

His showbiz career started after a talent show at a pub in Dukinfield in which he was the runner-up. This encouraged him to tour the circuit of pubs and working men&#x27;s clubs in Northern England. His breakthrough into television was then as a warm-up man on &quot;Comedy Bandbox&quot; – a revue which was a proving ground for British comedians at that time.

==Career==

===London Palladium===
Yarwood appeared on British television shows in the 1960s and 1970s. Before his various eponymous BBC television series, he worked for the ITV franchise holder ATV, and for Thames Television after he left the BBC. Yarwood owed his initial success to the &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot; variety spectacular, on which he first appeared in 1964. His appearance coincided with the senior political career of Labour Party leader and Prime Minister Harold Wilson, whom Yarwood impersonated.

===The &quot;Cotton Crew&quot; at the BBC===
Yarwood&#x27;s career peaked during the 1970s when he was one of a stable of stars under the BBC head of light entertainment Bill Cotton, alongside Bruce Forsyth, Dick Emery, Morecambe and Wise, Val Doonican and the Two Ronnies – all performers who started their careers on ITV during the preceding decade. By the late 1970s, some of them had left the BBC and returned to ITV.

At their peak, Yarwood&#x27;s BBC TV shows regularly attracted 18 million viewers. The shows included a varied mix of comic sketches, guest musicians, and a closing song sung by Yarwood (introduced by the line &quot;and this is me&quot;, which became the title of his first autobiography).

The &quot;Mike Yarwood Christmas Show&quot; on BBC1 in 1977 was watched by 21.4 million people and was the highest-rated British television programme of that year. The show remains one of the most-watched television programmes, other than news and sport, in British history.

Both Yarwood and Morecambe and Wise signed up with Thames Television, Morecambe and Wise in 1978 and Yarwood in 1982, with mixed results; Morecambe and Wise fared better than Yarwood and their ratings remained relatively high.

===Impressions===
Among the other prominent personalities Yarwood portrayed were:

* Eddie Waring – rugby league commentator
* Brian Clough – football manager
* Robin Day – BBC political interviewer
* Magnus Pyke – TV science presenter
* Alf Garnett – Warren Mitchell&#x27;s character from &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;
* Columbo – Peter Falk&#x27;s American detective in the series of the same name
* Frank Spencer – the comic creation of sitcom actor Michael Crawford
* Ted Heath – Wilson&#x27;s Conservative Party rival

Using colour-separation overlay and video editing, Yarwood frequently staged set pieces in which he appeared as several characters at the same time using pre-recorded segments.

Yarwood&#x27;s performance as Harold Wilson became his trademark. He also included Prince Charles as one of his regular impressions.

Yarwood&#x27;s characterisations also created catchphrases that came to be identified with famous figures, even if they never actually used them. However, the two most famous were spoken by the people he caricatured. &quot;Silly Billy&quot;, spoken by his caricature of Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey, was used by Healey to describe strikers. It has been said that Yarwood invented the phrase &quot;I mean that most sincerely, folks&quot; for his caricature of &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; presenter Hughie Green, although Green has said he came up with the phrase himself, acknowledging that he used it so that &quot;the impersonators had something to hang on to&quot;.

===Later career===
Yarwood was the subject of a &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; special, presented by Eamonn Andrews on 31 May 1978. A behind-the-scenes documentary called &quot;Mike Yarwood: This is His Life&quot; was made six years later, also featuring Andrews, alongside contributions from Bruce Forsyth, David Frost and Harold Wilson.

Yarwood&#x27;s Thames TV show was cancelled at the end of 1987, and he concentrated on stage work. Subsequent attempts to resurrect his television career failed, although he did make an appearance on the satirical show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; in November 1995.

In the mid-1990s, Yarwood had the chance to return to the stage as prime minister John Major, but failed to re-establish himself before Major&#x27;s premiership ended. He claimed that one of the difficulties in impersonating John Major and Tony Blair was that they were &quot;nice guys&quot;. His career prematurely ended owing to anxiety problems, precipitating stage fright and two collapses on stage.

In 2003, Yarwood made a rare public appearance at the Albany comedy club in London, at the invitation of Bob Monkhouse. It was to be Monkhouse&#x27;s last show, which was filmed for a proposed TV documentary, but ended up airing in December 2016 as a one-off special for BBC Four.

In 2021, Yarwood&#x27;s Christmas shows were licensed from Fremantle/Thames by That&#x27;s TV to broadcast the shows as part of its festive offering, alongside other programmes such as &quot;The Kenny Everett Video Show&quot;, &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; and &quot;Beadle&#x27;s About&quot;, which had not been seen in full on a British television channel in more than 20 years.

==Personal life==
Yarwood was married to the dancer Sandra Burville from 8 November 1969 until 1985. They had two daughters, Charlotte and Clare.

In May 1976, Yarwood was appointed an OBE in Harold Wilson&#x27;s retirement honours list. He collected the insignia at Buckingham Palace on 8 December that year. 

In October 1999, Yarwood underwent treatment for depression at the Priory Clinic in Roehampton, London.

From 2007, Yarwood lived alone in Weybridge, Surrey.

In 2021 it was reported that he was a resident of Brinsworth House, a residential and nursing retirement home for theatre and entertainment professionals in Twickenham, west London.

Yarwood died on 8 September 2023, at the age of 82.

<text>Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport is a public airport six miles (10 km) east of downtown Amarillo, in Potter County, Texas, United States. The airport was renamed in 2003 after NASA astronaut and Amarillo native Rick Husband, who died in the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster in February of that year.

==History==
===Early years===
The first recorded landing of aircraft in Amarillo occurred on 27 April 1918, when two Army Signal Corps planes, commanded by a Lt. R. Gray, landed in a pasture located in the 500 block of N. Polk. They refueled at the corner of NE 4th and N. Polk, before taking off again. In 1919, pilot-mechanics Fred W. Hinds and Jack Hiller, stationed at Call Field, flew W.K. Whipple to the same pasture. Whipple met with Porter Whaley, the head of Amarillo&#x27;s Board of City Development, about starting an aviation company. The result was the Panhandle Air Service and Transportation Co.

Panhandle Aerial Service and Transportation Co. was based at Amarillo&#x27;s first aerodrome, Bivins Field, which started operation on 1 January 1920. Located in the Bivins Addition of southwest Amarillo, the two runways now form North and South Julian Boulevard. The company was financed by H.E. Fuqua and Lee Bivins, which included building a $30,000 six-plane hangar located near 15th and Crockett. The operation eventually moved to the north of Amarillo, west of the current Ross Rogers Municipal Golf Course. In 1928, the field was renamed Bivins-English Field, when Harold English took over management.

The City of Amarillo opened a municipal airport, referred to as &quot;Old Muny&quot; or &quot;Old Municipal Airport&quot;, on 29 May 1929, located 4 miles west of the current Amarillo International Airport. Western Air Express air service was inaugurated here on 1 June 1929. Charles Lindbergh and wife were in attendance. Old Muny closed in 1951.

Also in 1929, Bivins-English Field was relocated further 7 miles east of Amarillo on Highway 60, and renamed English Field. Amarillo Airport Corporation, formed by Harold English and Thornton Oxnard, had bought out Lee Bivins&#x27; interest. Western Air Express had merged to become TWA and moved operations from Old Muny to English Field in 1930. Southern Air Transport soon followed. By 1935, Braniff Airways was also operating from English Field. In the winter of 1937 a fire destroyed the hangar, administration building, and cafe. Operations continued though, and English Field was rebuilt between in 1939–43, which included paved runways and taxiways when the city took over in 1941.

===Historical airline service===
Western Air Express began passenger airline service to Amarillo on June 1, 1929 with an eastbound flight to Wichita and Kansas City and a westbound flight to Albuquerque and Los Angeles. In mid 1930, these routes for Western Air Express were merged with Transcontinental Air Transport to become Transcontinental and Western Air (TWA) and Amarillo became a stop on a coast-to-coast service between Los Angeles and New York City using Ford Trimotor aircraft. The airline&#x27;s timetable stated this transcontinental flight could be accomplished in 36 hours with an &quot;overnight hotel stop&quot; being made in each direction on a routing of Los Angeles – Kingman, Ariz. – Winslow, Ariz. – Albuquerque – Amarillo – Wichita – Kansas City – St. Louis – Indianapolis – Columbus, Ohio – Pittsburgh – Philadelphia – New York City (via Newark Airport). In 1934 TWA upgraded its service using Douglas DC-2 aircraft which were then upgraded to Douglas DC-3s in 1937. Transcontinental &amp; Western Air changed its name to Trans World Airlines (still keeping the TWA letters) in 1946 and, by 1950, began using much larger four-engine Lockheed Constellation aircraft at Amarillo. In 1955 TWA partnered with Braniff International to operate an interchange flight between San Francisco and Houston stopping in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Amarillo, and Dallas, Amarillo being the junction point for the interchange. In 1964 TWA began operating the first jet aircraft through Amarillo which included the Boeing 707, Boeing 727, and the Convair 880. Most eastbound flights first stopped at Wichita and continued onto Kansas City, St. Louis, Chicago, and New York. Westbound flights first stopped at Albuquerque then continued to Los Angeles. Nonstop service to Phoenix was added in 1970. After airline deregulation was passed in late 1978, TWA added nonstop flights to Kansas City, St. Louis, and Las Vegas while dropping service to Albuquerque. All TWA service to Amarillo was discontinued on December 15, 1982.

Southern Air Transport (1929) initiated service on an Amarillo – Wichita Falls – Dallas route in 1929. The company was one of many airlines merged to become American Airways in 1930. American continued the route to Dallas until late 1933. The American Airways name was later changed to American Airlines and service returned to Amarillo in 1981

Western Air Express briefly returned to Amarillo in 1933 operating a route to Dallas as well as a route to Pueblo, Colorado Springs, and Denver, Colorado.

Dallas-based Long &amp; Harman Air Lines began service in 1934 with a route from Amarillo to Dallas making stops in Wichita Falls and Fort Worth. In 1935, Long &amp; Harman, and the route to Amarillo, were acquired by Braniff Airways. This route made Amarillo an important crossroads center as passengers traveling on TWA from Los Angeles and Albuquerque could connect with Braniff flights to Dallas. By 1945 Braniff introduced a new route from Denver to Memphis with stops at Colorado Springs, Pueblo CO, Amarillo, Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Muskogee OK, Fort Smith AR, and Little Rock. In 1952 an interchange agreement was made with Eastern Airlines which extended the Denver-Memphis service onto Miami, Florida by linking with Eastern&#x27;s route from Memphis to Miami, stopping in Birmingham, Atlanta, and Orlando. In 1955 an interchange flight was also operated with TWA on a San Francisco – Los Angeles – Las Vegas – Amarillo – Dallas – Houston routing. By the 1960s, many of the stops on the Denver – Memphis route, including Pueblo and Muskogee, had been eliminated as well as the stops on the Amarillo-Dallas route although some flights to Dallas began stopping in Lubbock, Texas. In the 1970s the flights to Denver and Oklahoma City were discontinued and Amarillo was no longer included on the interchange route to Miami. All Braniff service ended on May 12, 1982 when the carrier declared bankruptcy and shut down. Over the years Braniff operated a variety of aircraft at Amarillo including the Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior, Douglas DC-3, Convair 240, and Lockheed L-188 Electra. By 1968 Braniff International had introduced jet service to Amarillo with the Boeing 727-100, Boeing 727-200, and British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven jets.

Pioneer Air Lines, a local service airline, began service in 1945 as &quot;Essair&quot; with a route from Amarillo to Houston Hobby Airport, stopping in Plainview, Lubbock, Abilene, San Angelo, and Austin, Texas. In 1948 the carrier had changed its name to Pioneer and a new route to El Paso began with stops in Clovis, Roswell, and Las Cruces, New Mexico. The El Paso route was discontinued in 1950 and Pioneer merged into Continental Airlines in 1955 which retained operating the route to Houston. Pioneer operated Douglas DC-3 and Martin 2-0-2 aircraft.

Continental Airlines began its service to Amarillo upon merging with Pioneer Air Lines in 1955 and acquiring the route to Houston. By 1959, nonstop service to Dallas was added along with one-stop flights via Lubbock. Continental operated Douglas DC-3, Convair 340, and Vickers Viscount prop aircraft during this time. The carrier added jet service in the late 1960s beginning with the Douglas DC-9-10 followed by the Boeing 727-200 on the following routes: Amarillo-Lubbock-Midland-San Angelo-Houston Intercontinental Airport, Amarillo-Lubbock-Midland-El Paso-Los Angeles, and Amarillo-Lubbock-Dallas. All service was discontinued in 1977 but would return in late 1982 when Continental merged with Texas International Airlines.

Central Airlines, a local service airline, began Amarillo service in 1950 with a route to Dallas and Fort Worth making stops in Tulsa and ten other communities in Texas and Oklahoma. In 1956 the carrier added new routes to Denver and Wichita, each making several stops, and new nonstop service to Oklahoma City was added by 1961. Central operated Douglas DC-3, Convair 240, and Convair 600 aircraft. In 1967 Central merged into Frontier Airlines which retained its routes from Amarillo.

Frontier Airlines (1950–1986) began Amarillo service upon merging with Central Airlines in 1967 and retaining that carriers routes. Service was scaled back over the next few years and by 1974 Frontier was only operating a Denver-Colorado Springs-Pueblo-Lamar CO-Amarillo-Oklahoma City-Tulsa-Fort Smith-Little Rock-Memphis route which was essentially the route that Braniff began in the mid-1940s. Frontier operated Convair 580 aircraft and all service was discontinued in 1981.

Trans-Texas Airways, also a local service airline, began service from Amarillo to Houston in 1963 with stops in Lubbock, Abilene, and Austin. Douglas DC-3, Convair 240, and Convair 600 aircraft were used. In 1969 the carrier changed its name to Texas International and began operating Douglas DC-9-10 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jets to Dallas with a stop in Wichita Falls, Nonstops jets also began to Denver and to San Antonio, continuing to Houston. The original route to Houston with prop aircraft had been discontinued. Nonstop flights to Dallas were added in 1973 and a flight to Clovis, Roswell, and Hobbs, New Mexico was briefly operated with a Convair 600. In 1974 the Houston flights began stopping in Lubbock and Austin rather than San Antonio. The Dallas flights ended in 1981 and a nonstop flight to Austin was added in 1982 shortly before all service ended when Texas International merged into Continental Airlines in late 1982.

Southwest Airlines began operating nonstop Boeing 737-200 service to Dallas Love Field in 1978. Service to Albuquerque and Phoenix was added in 1982 and nonstop flights to Las Vegas were added in 1996. The Albuquerque/Phoenix flights ended in 2009 and Southwest has continually upgraded their aircraft with later versions of the Boeing 737 including the Boeing 737-300 and Boeing 737-700.

American Airlines returned service to Amarillo in 1981 with Boeing 727-100, Boeing 727-200, Fokker 100 and McDonnell Douglas MD-80 mainline jets operating nonstop to Dallas/Fort Worth. During the 1990s American began converting some flights to American Eagle prop aircraft and later to regional jets. Most of American&#x27;s service today is operated by American Eagle. American Eagle operated a nonstop flight to Phoenix for a short time in 2018 and 2019.

Continental Airlines briefly returned to Amarillo following its merger with Texas International in 1982 but ended less than a year later when the airline declared bankruptcy. Continental used Douglas DC-9-10 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 nonstops to Austin and Denver as well as one stop DC-9 service to Houston Intercontinental airport. Continental service returned in 1988 with flights to Denver operated by commuter airlines as Continental Express however these Denver flights ended in early 1995. In 1998 Continental returned for a fourth time with regional jet flights to Houston operated by ExpressJet Airlines as Continental Express. Continental merged into United Airlines in 2012 and now United Express operates the nonstop flights to Houston.

Delta Air Lines served Amarillo beginning in 1982 with Boeing 737-200 nonstops to Dallas/Fort Worth as well as one-stop flights via Lubbock. In 1993, the DFW service was changed to Delta Connection using prop aircraft and switching to regional jets several years later. Delta Connection service to/from DFW ended in 2005. In 2010, Delta Connection carrier Pinnacle Airlines operated three daily nonstop flights from Amarillo to Memphis aboard 50-seat regional jets, but this service was reduced to one daily flight in December 2010 and eliminated altogether in March 2011.

Aspen Airways began service to Amarillo in 1983 with flights to Denver and Lubbock using Convair 580 prop aircraft. These flights were upgraded to British Aerospace BAe 146-100 jet aircraft in 1985 and Aspen began operating as United Express on behalf of United Airlines in 1986. All service ended in 1990 when Aspen went out of business.

United Express service to Denver began in 1986 and has been operated by a variety of commuter and regional airlines using prop aircraft and regional jets. The Denver service ended in 2002 but returned in 2011 with all regional jets. Upon the merger of United and Continental Airlines in 2012, new United Express service was added with nonstop service to Houston.

ViaAir briefly operated nonstop service to Austin in late 2018 and early 2019 using Embraer 145 regional jets.

Several independent commuter airlines have also served Amarillo including Air Midwest, Trans Central Airlines, Excellair, and Great Lakes Airlines.

===Airline terminal and airport name change===
In 1952 the airport name changed to Amarillo Air Terminal. After the adjacent Amarillo Air Force Base was deactivated in 1968 a portion became part of Amarillo Air Terminal. The primary instrument runway, built for the USAF Strategic Air Command base, at is among the longest commercial runways in the United States and is still used for military training. During the mid-1970s the airport was used for jet training by (then) West German national airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG.

New terminal buildings were opened on 12 September 1954, and 17 May 1971. By 1976, the airport had also become a US Customs port of entry, becoming Amarillo International Airport.

The original English Field terminal building was converted in 1997 to a museum maintained by the Texas Aviation Historical Society. This museum lost its lease with the City of Amarillo and is now located in buildings southeast of the main runway, formally known as Attebury Grain. The name of the original airfield is memorialized in the English Fieldhouse, a local restaurant located adjacent to the general aviation terminal.

In 2003 the airport terminal building was rededicated to NASA astronaut Rick Husband, the commander of mission STS-107 of the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; and an Amarillo native. Husband and his crew were killed when the &quot;Columbia&quot; disintegrated upon re-entry on February 1, 2003.

The terminal building underwent a $52.2 million renovation that was designed by the firms Reynolds, Smith &amp; Hills and Shiver Megert and Associates and completed in 2011.

===Amarillo Field/Amarillo Army Airfield (1942–1946)===
In the midst of WW II, Col. Edward C. Black was transferred from his command of Sheppard Field, and ordered to activate an Air Corp Technical School ten miles east of Amarillo, next to English Field. The purpose of the center was to train Flying Fortress mechanics and technicians. Black established his headquarters in the Amarillo Building and construction started on 20 April. The new site was designated Amarillo Field on 26 May. Over 25,000 trees and shrubs were planted and grass sown in an attempt to control soil erosion and dust clouds. The field was manned on 2 September; students arrived on 3 September; Black&#x27;s HQ staff moved in on 6 September; and instruction started on 7 September. Brig. Gen. Julian B. Haddon assumed command on 22 October and held an open house for Amarillo residents on 11 November, Armistice Day, with over 40,000 attending. On 2 December the name was changed to Amarillo Army Air Field. The first class of students graduated on 23 December, with Maj. Gen Jacob Fickel in attendance. Basic training was added in May 1943, training Army Air Forces personnel in the fundamentals of soldiering.

Though most students entered the training without any mechanical training, but the 76-day primary course, followed by a 36-day specific course, ensured they were experts upon graduating. Classes were in session around the clock. Students became familiar with mechanics tools, and the structure of the B-17, which included a B-17 cutaway, and a complete B-17 composed of parts from five different previously scrapped airplanes. In addition, aircraft instruments, hydraulic systems, electrical systems, aircraft engines, and fuel systems repair and replacement are covered, including complete engine overhaul. This was in addition to regular military drill and calisthenics. Students were allowed one day off per week.

B-29 flight engineer training started in 1944. This was the first AAF aircraft requiring such a crew member. The engine control panel was located behind the pilot, and the engineer adjusted the throttle, fuel mixture, supercharger, and propeller pitch for each engine. In addition, the flight engineer computed the aircraft range, fuel consumption, engine performance, weight and balance, and airworthiness. Aircraft mechanics were trained in either the B-29, or the B-17. After 10 May 1945, only B-29 training was offered.

The base was established in April 1942 as a basic training centre and technical school for flight engineers as part of the Fourth Technical Training District and the first students began training there in September 1942. In mid-October 1945 all training stations were transferred to the Eastern Technical Training Command which was redesignated Technical Training Command. The base was closed on 30 June 1946.

===Amarillo Air Force Base (1951–1968)===

With the start of the Korean War, the USAF turned to Amarillo once again as a location for technical training. On 1 March 1951 the Air Training Command activated Amarillo Air Force Base as a technical training base to provide jet airplane and engine mechanic training. The 3320th Technical Training Wing was established to oversee these training operations. Jet aircraft available for training mechanics included an F-89, an F-86F, and three B-47s.

In 1958, Amarillo AFB offered a general course on guided missiles. On 1 January 1959, the 3320th Technical Training Wing was redesignated as the Amarillo Technical Training Center, and on 15 July, a field training squadron was established. In 1961, base buildings were modernized, and in 1962, courses for the F/RF-4C were prepared. In 1964, a reserve medical unit was established at the base.

In early 1965, ATC announced plans to close its training operations at Amarillo AFB, and transfer the base to the Air Defense Command. Amarillo&#x27;s 29 technical courses would be transferred to other bases. However, emergency expansion of basic military training (BMT), as the result of the Vietnam War, meant the continued use of Amarillo as a training facility. Recruits began arriving on 18 February 1966, and the six-week BMT continued until November 1968.

On 10 February 1966, an airman basic died from an outbreak of spinal meningitis at Lackland Air Force Base. As a consequence of the precautionary limited training at Lackland, ATC organized the 3330th Basic Military Training School, and assigned it to the Amarillo Training Technical Center as a second BMT school. Also active at Amarillo was the 3334th BMTS, which graduated its last class, Flight 388, in November 1968. However, the 3320th Retraining Group was relocated to Lowry AFB in 1967.

On 5 January 1959, Strategic Air Command (SAC) established the 4128th Strategic Wing at Amarillo Air Force Base assigned it to the 47th Air Division. In July 1959 the 4128th Strategic Wing was assigned to the 810th Air Division. The wing became operational on 1 February 1960 when the 718th Bombardment Squadron, consisting of 15 B-52s moved to Amarillo. On 1 July 1962 the wing was reassigned to the 22d Air Division. On 1 February 1963 the 4128th was replaced by reactivated 461st Bombardment Wing, Heavy (461st BW), which assumed its mission, personnel and equipment.

The 461st Bombardment Wing was activated at Amarillo AFB on 1 February 1963, absorbing the inactivated 4128th Strategic Wing. Trained to maintain heavy bombardment proficiency with the B-52, the wing maintained combat proficiency until 21 January 1968, when the last B-52 was transferred. The 909th Air Refueling Squadron&#x27;s KC-135s were assigned to the wing from 1 April 1963 until 25 June 1966. The wing&#x27;s B-52s and crews participated in Operation Arc Light combat operations from 18 January until 4 July 1967, while on a temporary duty assignment to Andersen Air Force Base. On 25 March 1968, the wing was inactivated. Wing commanders included Col. William R. Calhoun, Jr., Col. John B. Paine, Col. Charles D. Lewis, and Col. William H. Hill.

Closure of the base was postponed from 30 June 1968 until the end of the year, while ATC released property. On 1 April, 1,784 acres and seven buildings were released to the city of Amarillo. On 1 July facilities were released for civilian use, including those for Bell Helicopter, and Texas A&amp;M University&#x27;s technical training institute. Technical training courses ended on 27 August, and BMT ended on 11 December. Remaining Amarillo Technical Training Center functions ceased on 31 December 1968, and the base was placed in inactive status on 1 January 1969. The base was finally transferred to civilian control on 16 February 1971.

Gen. William Lecel Lee served as the base commander from 1956 until 1962.

<text>The 1940 Tacoma Narrows Bridge, the first bridge at this location, was a suspension bridge in the U.S. state of Washington that spanned the Tacoma Narrows strait of Puget Sound between Tacoma and the Kitsap Peninsula. It opened to traffic on July 1, 1940, and dramatically collapsed into Puget Sound on November 7 of the same year. The bridge&#x27;s collapse has been described as &quot;spectacular&quot; and in subsequent decades &quot;has attracted the attention of engineers, physicists, and mathematicians&quot;. Throughout its short existence, it was the world&#x27;s third-longest suspension bridge by main span, behind the Golden Gate Bridge and the George Washington Bridge.

Construction began in September 1938. From the time the deck was built, it began to move vertically in windy conditions, so construction workers nicknamed the bridge &quot;Galloping Gertie&quot;. The motion continued after the bridge opened to the public, despite several damping measures. The bridge&#x27;s main span finally collapsed in winds on the morning of November 7, 1940, as the deck oscillated in an alternating twisting motion that gradually increased in amplitude until the deck tore apart. The violent swaying and eventual collapse resulted in the death of a cocker spaniel named &quot;Tubby&quot;, as well as inflicting injuries on people fleeing the disintegrating bridge or attempting to rescue the stranded dog.

Efforts to replace the bridge were delayed by US involvement in World War II, as well as engineering and finance issues, but in 1950, a new Tacoma Narrows Bridge opened in the same location, using the original bridge&#x27;s tower pedestals and cable anchorages. The portion of the bridge that fell into the water now serves as an artificial reef.

The bridge&#x27;s collapse had a lasting effect on science and engineering. In many physics textbooks, the event is presented as an example of elementary forced mechanical resonance, but it was more complicated in reality; the bridge collapsed because moderate winds produced aeroelastic flutter that was self-exciting and unbounded: for any constant sustained wind speed above about , the amplitude of the (torsional) flutter oscillation would continuously increase, with a negative damping factor, i.e., a reinforcing effect, opposite to damping. The collapse boosted research into bridge aerodynamics-aeroelastics, which has influenced the designs of all later long-span bridges.

==Design and construction==

Proposals for a bridge between Tacoma and the Kitsap Peninsula date at least to the Northern Pacific Railway&#x27;s 1889 trestle proposal, but concerted efforts began in the mid-1920s. The Tacoma Chamber of Commerce began campaigning and funding studies in 1923. Several noted bridge engineers were consulted, including Joseph B. Strauss, who went on to be chief engineer of the Golden Gate Bridge, and David B. Steinman, later the designer of the Mackinac Bridge. Steinman made several Chamber-funded visits and presented a preliminary proposal in 1929, but by 1931 the Chamber had cancelled the agreement because Steinman was not working hard enough to obtain financing. At the 1938 meeting of the structural division of the American Society of Civil Engineers, during the construction of the bridge, with its designer in the audience, Steinman predicted its failure.

In 1937, the Washington State legislature created the Washington State Toll Bridge Authority and appropriated $5,000 (equivalent to $ today) to study the request by Tacoma and Pierce County for a bridge over the Narrows.

From the start, financing of the bridge was a problem: Revenue from the proposed tolls would not be enough to cover construction costs; another expense was buying out the ferry contract from a private firm running services on the Narrows at the time. Nonetheless, there was strong support for the bridge from the United States Navy, which operated the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, and from the United States Army, which ran McChord Field and Fort Lewis near Tacoma.

Washington State engineer Clark Eldridge produced a preliminary tried-and-true conventional suspension bridge design, and the Washington State Toll Bridge Authority requested $11 million (equivalent to $ million today) from the federal Public Works Administration (PWA). Preliminary construction plans by the Washington Department of Highways had called for a set of trusses to sit beneath the roadway and stiffen it.

However, &quot;Eastern consulting engineers&quot; — by which Eldridge meant Leon Moisseiff, the noted New York bridge engineer who served as designer and consultant engineer for the Golden Gate Bridge — petitioned the PWA and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) to build the bridge for less. Moisseiff and Frederick Lienhard, the latter an engineer with what was then known in New York as the Port Authority, had published a paper that was probably the most important theoretical advance in the bridge engineering field of the decade.

Their theory of elastic distribution extended the deflection theory that was originally devised by the Austrian engineer Josef Melan to horizontal bending under static wind load. They showed that the stiffness of the main cables (via the suspenders) would absorb up to one-half of the static wind pressure pushing a suspended structure laterally. This energy would then be transmitted to the anchorages and towers. Using this theory, Moisseiff argued for stiffening the bridge with a set of plate girders rather than the trusses proposed by the Washington State Toll Bridge Authority. This approach meant a slimmer, more elegant design, and also reduced the construction costs as compared with the Highway Department&#x27;s design proposed by Eldridge. Moisseiff&#x27;s design won out, inasmuch as the other proposal was considered to be too expensive. On June 23, 1938, the PWA approved nearly $6 million (equivalent to $ million today) for the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. Another $1.6 million ($ million today) was to be collected from tolls to cover the estimated total $8 million cost ($ million today).

Following Moisseiff&#x27;s design, bridge construction began on November 23, 1938. Construction took only nineteen months, at a cost of $6.4 million ($ million today), which was financed by the grant from the PWA and a loan from the RFC.

The Tacoma Narrows Bridge, with a main span of , was the third-longest suspension bridge in the world at that time, following the George Washington Bridge between New Jersey and New York City, and the Golden Gate Bridge, connecting San Francisco with Marin County to its north.

Because planners expected fairly light traffic volumes, the bridge was designed with two lanes, and it was just wide. This was quite narrow, especially in comparison with its length. With only the plate girders providing additional depth, the bridge&#x27;s roadway section was also shallow.

The decision to use such shallow and narrow girders proved the bridge&#x27;s undoing. With such minimal girders, the deck of the bridge was insufficiently rigid and was easily moved about by winds; from the start, the bridge became infamous for its movement. A mild to moderate wind could cause alternate halves of the centre span to visibly rise and fall several feet over four- to five-second intervals. This flexibility was experienced by the builders and workmen during construction, which led some of the workers to christen the bridge &quot;Galloping Gertie&quot;. The nickname soon stuck, and even the public (when the toll-paid traffic started) felt these motions on the day that the bridge opened on July 1, 1940.

==Attempt to control structural vibration==
Since the structure experienced considerable vertical oscillations while it was still under construction, several strategies were used to reduce the motion of the bridge. They included:
* attachment of tie-down cables to the plate girders, which were anchored to 50-ton concrete blocks on the shore. This measure proved ineffective, as the cables snapped shortly after installation.
* addition of a pair of inclined cable stays that connected the main cables to the bridge deck at mid-span. These remained in place until the collapse but were also ineffective at reducing the oscillations.
* Finally, the structure was equipped with hydraulic buffers installed between the towers and the floor system of the deck to damp longitudinal motion of the main span. The effectiveness of the hydraulic dampers was nullified, however, because the seals of the units were damaged when the bridge was sand-blasted before being painted.

The Washington State Toll Bridge Authority hired Frederick Burt Farquharson, an engineering professor at the University of Washington, to make wind tunnel tests and recommend solutions to reduce the oscillations of the bridge. Farquharson and his students built a 1:200-scale model of the bridge and a 1:20-scale model of a section of the deck. The first studies concluded on November 2, 1940—five days before the bridge collapse on November 7. He proposed two solutions:
* To drill holes in the lateral girders and along the deck so that the airflow could circulate through them (in this way reducing lift forces).
* To give a more aerodynamic shape to the transverse section of the deck by adding fairings or deflector vanes along the deck, attached to the girder fascia.
The first option was not favored, because of its irreversible nature. The second option was the chosen one, but it was not carried out, because the bridge collapsed five days after the studies were concluded.

==Collapse==

On November 7, 1940, at around 9:45 a.m. PST, especially strong winds caused the bridge to sway wildly from side to side. At least two vehicles were on the bridge at the time – a delivery truck driven by Ruby Jacox and Arthur Hagen, employees of Rapid Transfer Company, and a vehicle driven by Leonard Coatsworth, editor at &quot;The News Tribune&quot;. The truck tipped over due to the swaying, while the car lost control and began to slide from side to side. Jacox, Hagen, and Coatsworth exited their respective vehicles and got off of the bridge on foot. Coatsworth&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s dog Tubby was left inside the car.

Coatsworth later described his experience.

Traffic was stopped to prevent additional vehicles from entering the bridge. Howard Clifford, a photographer for the &quot;Tacoma News Tribune&quot;, walked onto the bridge to try to save Tubby, but was forced to turn back when the span began to break apart in the center. At approximately 11:00 a.m., the bridge collapsed into the strait.
Coatsworth received $814.40 (equivalent to $ today) in reimbursement from the Washington State Toll Bridge Authority for his car and its contents, including Tubby the cocker spaniel.

===Film of collapse===

The collapse was filmed with two cameras by Barney Elliott and by Harbine Monroe, owners of The Camera Shop in Tacoma, including the unsuccessful attempt to rescue the dog. Their footage was subsequently sold to Paramount Pictures, which duplicated it for newsreels in black-and-white and distributed it worldwide to movie theaters. Castle Films also received distribution rights for 8 mm home video. In 1998, &quot;The Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. This footage is still shown to engineering, architecture, and physics students as a cautionary tale.

Elliott and Monroe&#x27;s footage of the construction and collapse was shot on 16 mm Kodachrome film, but most copies in circulation are in black and white because newsreels of the day copied the film onto 35 mm black-and-white stock. There were also film-speed discrepancies between Monroe&#x27;s and Elliot&#x27;s footage, with Monroe filming at 24 frames per second and Elliott at 16 frames per second. As a result, most copies in circulation also show the bridge oscillating approximately 50% faster than real time, due to an assumption during conversion that the film was shot at 24 frames per second rather than the actual 16 fps.

Another reel of film emerged in February 2019, taken by Arthur Leach from the Gig Harbor (westward) side of the bridge, and one of the few known images of the collapse from that side. Leach was a civil engineer who served as toll collector for the bridge, and is believed to have been the last person to cross the bridge to the west before its collapse, trying to prevent further crossings from that side as the bridge became unstable. Leach&#x27;s footage (originally on black-and-white film but then recorded to video cassette by filming the projection) also includes Leach&#x27;s commentary at the time of the collapse.

==Inquiry==

Theodore von Kármán, the director of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory and a world-renowned aerodynamicist, was a member of the board of inquiry into the collapse. He reported that the State of Washington was unable to collect on one of the insurance policies for the bridge because its insurance agent had fraudulently pocketed the insurance premiums. The agent, Hallett R. French, who represented the Merchant&#x27;s Fire Assurance Company, was charged and tried for grand larceny for withholding the premiums for $800,000 worth of insurance (equivalent to $ million today). The bridge was insured by many other policies that covered 80% of the $5.2 million structure&#x27;s value (equivalent to $ million today). Most of these were collected without incident.

On November 28, 1940, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Hydrographic Office reported that the remains of the bridge were located at geographical coordinates , at a depth of .

=== Federal Works Agency Commission ===
A commission formed by the Federal Works Agency studied the collapse of the bridge. The board of engineers responsible for the report were Othmar Ammann, Theodore von Kármán, and Glenn B. Woodruff. Without drawing any definitive conclusions, the commission explored three possible failure causes:
* Aerodynamic instability by self-induced vibrations in the structure
* Eddy formations that might be periodic
* Random effects of turbulence, that is the random fluctuations in velocity of the wind.

===Cause of the collapse===

The original Tacoma Narrows Bridge was the first to be built with girders of carbon steel anchored in concrete blocks; preceding designs typically had open lattice beam trusses underneath the roadbed. This bridge was the first of its type to employ plate girders (pairs of deep I-beams) to support the roadbed. With the earlier designs, any wind would pass through the truss, but in the new design, the wind would be diverted above and below the structure. Shortly after construction finished at the end of June (opened to traffic on July 1, 1940), it was discovered that the bridge would sway and buckle dangerously in relatively mild windy conditions that are common for the area, and worse during severe winds. This vibration was transverse, one-half of the central span rising while the other lowered. Drivers would see cars approaching from the other direction rise and fall, riding the violent energy wave through the bridge. However, at that time the mass of the bridge was considered sufficient to keep it structurally sound.

The failure of the bridge occurred when a never-before-seen twisting mode occurred, from winds at . This is a so-called torsional vibration mode (which is different from the transversal or longitudinal vibration mode), whereby when the left side of the roadway went down, the right side would rise, and vice versa, i.e., the two halves of the bridge twisted in opposite directions, with the centre line of the road remaining still (motionless). This vibration was caused by aeroelastic fluttering.

 Fluttering is a physical phenomenon in which several degrees of freedom of a structure become coupled in an unstable oscillation driven by the wind. Here, unstable means that the forces and effects that cause the oscillation are not checked by forces and effects that limit the oscillation, so it does not self-limit but grows without bound. Eventually, the amplitude of the motion produced by the fluttering increased beyond the strength of a vital part, in this case the suspender cables. As several cables failed, the weight of the deck transferred to the adjacent cables, which became overloaded and broke in turn until almost all of the central deck fell into the water below the span.

====Resonance (due to Von Kármán vortex street) hypothesis====
The bridge&#x27;s spectacular destruction is often used as an object lesson in the necessity to consider both aerodynamics and resonance effects in civil and structural engineering. Billah and Scanlan (1991) reported that, in fact, many physics textbooks (for example Resnick et al. and Tipler et al.) wrongly explain that the cause of the failure of the Tacoma Narrows bridge was externally forced mechanical resonance. Resonance is the tendency of a system to oscillate at larger amplitudes at certain frequencies, known as the system&#x27;s natural frequencies. At these frequencies, even relatively small periodic driving forces can produce large amplitude vibrations, because the system stores energy. For example, a child using a swing realizes that if the pushes are properly timed, the swing can move with a very large amplitude. The driving force, in this case the child pushing the swing, exactly replenishes the energy that the system loses if its frequency equals the natural frequency of the system.

Usually, the approach taken by those physics textbooks is to introduce a first order forced oscillator, defined by the second-order differential equation

where , and stand for the mass, damping coefficient and stiffness of the linear system and and represent the amplitude and the angular frequency of the exciting force. The solution of such ordinary differential equation as a function of time represents the displacement response of the system (given appropriate initial conditions). In the above system resonance happens when is approximately formula_1, i.e., formula_2 is the natural (resonant) frequency of the system. The actual vibration analysis of a more complicated mechanical system — such as an airplane, a building or a bridge — is based on the linearization of the equation of motion for the system, which is a multidimensional version of equation (). The analysis requires eigenvalue analysis and thereafter the natural frequencies of the structure are found, together with the so-called &quot;fundamental modes&quot; of the system, which are a set of independent displacements and/or rotations that specify completely the displaced or deformed position and orientation of the body or system, i.e., the bridge moves as a (linear) combination of those basic deformed positions.

Each structure has natural frequencies. For resonance to occur, it is necessary to have also periodicity in the excitation force. The most tempting candidate of the periodicity in the wind force was assumed to be the so-called vortex shedding. This is because bluff (non-streamlined) bodies — like bridge decks — in a fluid stream produce (or &quot;shed&quot;) wakes, whose characteristics depend on the size and shape of the body and the properties of the fluid. These wakes are accompanied by alternating low-pressure vortices on the downwind side of the body, the so-called Kármán vortex street or von Kármán vortex street. The body will in consequence try to move toward the low-pressure zone, in an oscillating movement called vortex-induced vibration. Eventually, if the frequency of vortex shedding matches the natural frequency of the structure, the structure will begin to resonate and the structure&#x27;s movement can become self-sustaining.

The frequency of the vortices in the von Kármán vortex street is called the Strouhal frequency formula_3, and is given by

Here, stands for the flow velocity, is a characteristic length of the bluff body and is the dimensionless Strouhal number, which depends on the body in question. For Reynolds numbers greater than 1000, the Strouhal number is approximately equal to 0.21. In the case of the Tacoma Narrows,  was approximately and was 0.20.

It was thought that the Strouhal frequency was close enough to one of the natural vibration frequencies of the bridge, i.e., formula_4, to cause resonance and therefore vortex-induced vibration.

In the case of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, this appears not to have been the cause of the catastrophic damage. According to Farquharson, the wind was steady at and the frequency of the destructive mode was 12 cycles/minute (0.2 Hz). This frequency was neither a natural mode of the isolated structure nor the frequency of blunt-body vortex shedding of the bridge at that wind speed, which was approximately 1 Hz. It can be concluded therefore that the vortex shedding was not the cause of the bridge collapse. The event can be understood only while considering the coupled aerodynamic and structural system that requires rigorous mathematical analysis to reveal all the degrees of freedom of the particular structure and the set of design loads imposed.

Vortex-induced vibration is a far more complex process that involves both the external wind-initiated forces and internal self-excited forces that lock on to the motion of the structure. During lock-on, the wind forces drive the structure at or near one of its natural frequencies, but as the amplitude increases this has the effect of changing the local fluid boundary conditions, so that this induces compensating, self-limiting forces, which restrict the motion to relatively benign amplitudes. This is clearly not a linear resonance phenomenon, even if the bluff body has linear behaviour, since the exciting force amplitude is a nonlinear force of the structural response.

====Resonance vs. non-resonance explanations====
Billah and Scanlan state that Lee Edson in his biography of Theodore von Kármán is a source of misinformation: &quot;The culprit in the Tacoma disaster was the Karman vortex street.&quot;

However, the Federal Works Administration report of the investigation, of which von Kármán was part, concluded that

A group of physicists cited &quot;wind-driven amplification of the torsional oscillation&quot; as distinct from resonance:

To some degree the debate is due to the lack of a commonly accepted precise definition of resonance. Billah and Scanlan provide the following definition of resonance &quot;In general, whenever a system capable of oscillation is acted on by a periodic series of impulses having a frequency equal to or nearly equal to one of the natural frequencies of the oscillation of the system, the system is set into oscillation with a relatively large amplitude.&quot; They then state later in their paper &quot;Could this be called a resonant phenomenon? It would appear not to contradict the qualitative definition of resonance quoted earlier, if we now identify the source of the periodic impulses as &quot;self-induced&quot;, the wind supplying the power, and the motion supplying the power-tapping mechanism. If one wishes to argue, however, that it was a case of &quot;externally forced linear resonance&quot;, the mathematical distinction ... is quite clear, self-exciting systems differing strongly enough from ordinary linear resonant ones.&quot;

== Link to the Armistice Day blizzard ==
The weather system that caused the bridge collapse went on to cause the 1940 Armistice Day Blizzard that killed 145 people in the Midwestern United States:

==Fate of the collapsed superstructure==
Efforts to salvage the bridge began almost immediately after its collapse and continued into May 1943. Two review boards, one appointed by the federal government and one appointed by the state of Washington, concluded that repair of the bridge was impossible, and the entire bridge would have to be dismantled and an entirely new bridge superstructure built. With steel being a valuable commodity because of the involvement of the United States in World War II, steel from the bridge cables and the suspension span was sold as scrap metal to be melted down. The salvage operation cost the state more than was returned from the sale of the material, a net loss of over $350,000 ().

The cable anchorages, tower pedestals and most of the remaining substructure were relatively undamaged in the collapse, and were reused during construction of the replacement span that opened in 1950. The towers, which supported the main cables and road deck, suffered major damage at their bases from being deflected towards shore as a result of the collapse of the mainspan and the sagging of the sidespans. They were dismantled, and the steel sent to recyclers.

===Preservation of the collapsed roadway===

The underwater remains of the highway deck of the old suspension bridge act as a large artificial reef, and these are listed on the National Register of Historic Places with reference number 92001068.

The Harbor History Museum has a display in its main gallery regarding the 1940 bridge, its collapse, and the subsequent two bridges.

===A lesson for history===
Othmar Ammann, a leading bridge designer and member of the Federal Works Agency Commission investigating the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, wrote:

Following the incident, engineers took extra caution to incorporate aerodynamics into their designs, and wind tunnel testing of designs was eventually made mandatory.

The Bronx–Whitestone Bridge, which is of similar design to the 1940 Tacoma Narrows Bridge, was reinforced shortly after the collapse. Fourteen-foot-high (4.3 m) steel trusses were installed on both sides of the deck in 1943 to weigh down and stiffen the bridge in an effort to reduce oscillation. In 2003, the stiffening trusses were removed and aerodynamic fiberglass fairings were installed along both sides of the road deck.

A key consequence was that suspension bridges reverted to a deeper and heavier truss design, including the replacement Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1950), until the development in the 1960s of box girder bridges with an airfoil shape such as the Severn Bridge, which gave the necessary stiffness together with reduced torsional forces.

== Replacement bridge ==

Because of shortages in materials and labor as a result of the involvement of the United States in World War II, it took 10 years before a replacement bridge was opened to traffic. This replacement bridge was opened to traffic on October 14, 1950, and is long, longer than the original bridge. The replacement bridge also has more lanes than the original bridge, which only had two traffic lanes, plus shoulders on both sides.

Half a century later, the replacement bridge exceeded its traffic capacity, and a second, parallel, suspension bridge was constructed to carry eastbound traffic. The suspension bridge that was completed in 1950 was reconfigured to carry only westbound traffic. The new parallel bridge opened to traffic in July 2007.

<text>Corpus Christi International Airport is west of Corpus Christi, in Nueces County, Texas. It opened in 1960, replacing Cliff Maus airport at , where the Lozano Golf Center is now located.

The airport&#x27;s six-gate Hayden Wilson Head Terminal, designed by Gensler, opened on November 3, 2002, with a theme of &quot;When the Sun Meets the Sea.&quot;

The Corpus Christi International Airport has tried to attract airline service from Mexico. In 1974, Texas International Airlines was flying Douglas DC-9-10s between Corpus Christi and Mexico City via McAllen, TX, and DC-9s twice a week to Tampico and Veracruz via McAllen in 1975. In 1967, Mexicana de Aviacion Douglas DC-6s flew direct to Mexico City via Monterrey three days a week.

With the arrival of the Chautauqua Airlines operating United Express flights with Canadair CRJ200 regional jets via a code sharing agreement with United Airlines (with Chautauqua operating a number of United Express flights into the airport at the time), the airline established a crew base with about 75 pilots and flight attendants in Corpus Christi. However, Chautauqua then closed this crew base in November 2008 with the airline ceasing to operate United Express flights from Corpus Christi. In May 2016, all United Express flights at Corpus Christi were being operated by Mesa Airlines with Embraer ERJ-175 regional jets or by ExpressJet with Embraer ERJ-145 regional jets.

The Dallas Love Field-Corpus Christi nonstop route operated by Southwest Airlines began on August 10, 2019, with one daily round-trip flight between the cities each Saturday. Southwest last flew the route nonstop in 1986, until 2024, when the flight was reinstated seasonally from June 8, 2024, to August 3, 2024.

Corpus Christi International Airport is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2023-2027, in which it is categorized as a non-hub primary commercial service facility.

==Facilities==
The Corpus Christi International Airport covers at an elevation of . It has two asphalt runways: 13/31 is and 18/36 is .

In 2017, the airport had 97,012 aircraft operations, an average of 266 per day: 66% military, 18% general aviation, 8% air taxi, and 8% commercial airline. In April 2020, there were 65 aircraft based at this airport: 28 single-engine, 24 multi-engine, 9 jets, 3 helicopters, and 1 glider.

American Airlines August 2017 schedules listed all of its nonstop service to Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) being operated by American Eagle with Canadair CRJ-900s flown by Mesa Airlines. Earlier in 2017, American was operating a daily McDonnell Douglas MD-80 flight which then discontinued; daily McDonnell Douglas MD-80 mainline service operated by American then resumed in the summer of 2018.

All Southwest Airlines flights at Corpus Christi are flown with various Boeing 737 models; Southwest is the only airline to serve Corpus Christi with year-round mainline jet service while American Airlines (AA) and United Airlines (UA) operate seasonal mainline jet flights, AA to Dallas/FortWorth, and UA to Houston/IAH.

The United Airlines May 2, 2016 flight status listings show all United Express flights to Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport on Mesa Airlines Embraer ERJ-175s or ExpressJet Embraer ERJ-145s at the time. On June 7, 2018, United Airlines began flying daily Airbus A319 mainline jet service to Houston (IAH); however, this service was later suspended and is now flown once again by United Express.

==Past airline service==

Braniff International Airways, Eastern Air Lines, Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) and Trans-Texas Airways (predecessor of Texas International Airlines) all served Corpus Christi&#x27;s old and new airports over the years.

In 1935, Braniff Lockheed Model 10 Electras flew Brownsville - Corpus Christi - San Antonio - Austin - Waco - Fort Worth - Dallas Love Field. In 1940, a Braniff Douglas DC-3 flew Brownsville - Corpus Christi - San Antonio - Austin - Fort Worth - Dallas Love Field - Oklahoma City - Ponca City, OK - Wichita - Kansas City - Chicago.

Eastern arrived at Corpus Christi in April 1939 with direct DC-3 flights from New York Newark Airport via a number of enroute stops with this service connecting to Pan Am&#x27;s flight to Mexico City. In 1958, Eastern Convair 440s flew Brownsville - Corpus Christi - Houston Hobby - Beaumont/Port Arthur - Lake Charles - Lafayette - Baton Rouge - New Orleans - Mobile - Pensacola - Montgomery - Birmingham - Atlanta.

Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) was flying Douglas DC-3s between Houston and Mexico City via Corpus Christi in 1947 with a daily roundtrip routing of Houston Hobby Airport (HOU) - Corpus Christi - Brownsville - Tampico - Mexico City with the airline having a name for this international service, being the &quot;Sun Ray Clipper&quot;. According to the November 1, 1947 Pan Am system timetable, the southbound &quot;Sun Ray Clipper&quot; flight overnighted in Mexico City and then operated continuing service the next day on a southbound routing of Mexico City - Guatemala City, Guatemala - Managua, Nicaragua - San Jose, Costa Rica - Balboa, Panama with return northbound service from Balboa to Houston via Corpus Christi being operated on the same routing in reverse with an overnight stop being made in Mexico City as well. However, Pan Am was no longer serving Corpus Christi by 1950 although the airline would return to the airport with jet service by the mid-1980s.

Trans-Texas Airways (TTa) arrived in 1950; in 1952, its Douglas DC-3s flew a multi-stop routing of Brownsville - Harlingen - McAllen - Alice - Corpus Christi - Beeville - Victoria - Houston. By 1963, most TTa flights to the airport were operated with Convair 240s direct to Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, Fort Worth, Harlingen, McAllen, and Victoria; TTa DC-3s also flew a routing of Corpus Christi - San Antonio - San Angelo - Midland/Odessa - Pecos - El Paso. By 1969, TTa had changed its name to Texas International Airlines, which continued to serve Corpus Christi with McDonnell Douglas DC-9 jet service

Scheduled jets arrived in the spring of 1965: Eastern Boeing 727-100s nonstop to Houston Hobby Airport and Braniff International BAC One-Elevens nonstop to both Houston Hobby Airport and San Antonio with the Braniff jet service continuing on to Dallas. In 1965, the primary runway was just 5600 feet long. In 1966, Braniff was operating Lockheed L-188 Electra propjets on a routing of Corpus Christi - Houston Hobby Airport - Dallas Love Field - Oklahoma City - Wichita - Kansas City - Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport. Also in 1966, Trans-Texas Airways introduced nonstop Douglas DC-9-10 jet service to Houston Hobby Airport in addition to Convair 600 turboprop flights nonstop to Houston, San Antonio, and Harlingen. In 1968, TTa was operating nonstop DC-9 jet service to both Harlingen and Houston Hobby Airport.

In 1966-67 Mexicana de Aviacion, a Mexican-based air carrier, was operating Douglas DC-6 propliners on nonstop international service to Monterrey, Mexico three days a week with this flight then continuing on to Mexico City.

Following its name change from Trans-Texas Airways (TTa), in 1974 Texas International Airlines was operating daily DC-9 jet service between Corpus Christi and Mexico City via McAllen as well as direct DC-9 flights to Denver and Salt Lake City via Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH) or San Antonio. Also in 1974, three airlines were operating nonstop jet service to Houston (IAH): Braniff Boeing 727-100s and 727-200s, Eastern Boeing 727-200s, and Texas International Douglas DC-9-10s with Braniff 727s also flying nonstop to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW).

The February 1, 1976 Official Airline Guide (OAG) lists Eastern Boeing 727-200s from Corpus Christi nonstop to New Orleans and also nonstop to Houston with both flights continuing on to Atlanta. Also in 1976, Braniff was operating three direct Boeing 727 flights a day to Chicago O&#x27;Hare, all via Dallas/Fort Worth. The same year, Texas International DC-9s flew direct to Los Angeles (LAX) via stops in Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth, Midland/Odessa, Roswell, NM, and Albuquerque.

Southwest Airlines began serving Corpus Christi on March 1, 1977, as an intrastate airline and in 1979 was operating six Boeing 737-200s a day nonstop to Houston Hobby Airport (HOU); it also flew nonstop to Dallas Love Field on weekends. In 1979, Braniff had ended nonstop service to Houston but was flying four nonstop 727s a day to Dallas/Fort Worth while Eastern 727s and Texas International DC-9s still flew nonstop to Houston Intercontinental (IAH). In 1981, Eastern McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s flew nonstop to Atlanta.

In 1982, Braniff International went out of business while Texas International was merged into Continental Airlines. American Airlines arrived in 1981; in 1983, American Boeing 727-100s and 727-200s flew nonstop to Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) with a total of three flights a day with an American 727-200 also flying to DFW via a stop in Austin. Continental had four daily 727 and DC-9 nonstops to Houston Intercontinental (IAH) while Pan Am Express operated by Emerald Air via a code sharing agreement with Pan Am operated three Douglas DC-9-10s a day to IAH. By 1984, Austin-based Emerald Air was operating as an independent carrier with up to ten DC-9 jet and Fairchild Hiller FH-227 turboprop departures a day nonstop to Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW), Houston (IAH), and McAllen.

United Airlines arrived in 1984 but then pulled out in 1987; in 1985, United was operating two direct flights a day to Denver with both services making a stop in Austin with Boeing 727-100s and 727-200s being flown on the route. United would return to Corpus Christi following its merger with Continental Airlines.

Pan Am returned to Corpus Christi in 1985 but then discontinued its flights in 1986; its Boeing 727-200s first operated Corpus Christi - Dallas/Fort Worth - New York Kennedy Airport (JFK) service with the airline subsequently operating Corpus Christi - Houston Intercontinental - Washington Dulles Airport (IAD) flights. Also in 1985, Eastern was operating a daily Boeing 727-200 service on a routing of Corpus Christi - San Antonio - Atlanta - New York LaGuardia Airport - Montreal; however, Eastern had pulled out of Corpus Christi by 1987.

In 1989, American Airlines had five daily McDonnell Douglas MD-80 nonstops to Dallas/Fort Worth while Continental and Continental Express were operating a total of six nonstops a day to Houston Intercontinental (Continental with Boeing 727-100s, 727-200s and Douglas DC-9-10s, and Continental Express with Britt Airways ATR 42s) while Southwest was flying eight nonstops a day to Houston Hobby with Boeing 737-200s and 737-300s.

Delta Air Lines arrived in 1990. In 1991, Delta had three Boeing 737-200s a day nonstop to its Dallas/Fort Worth hub, while American, and American Eagle had a total of seven nonstops a day to DFW, American with MD-80s and American Eagle with Saab 340s. In 1993, Delta turned its Corpus Christi-Dallas/Fort Worth service over to Delta Connection flown by Atlantic Southeast Airlines ATR 72s and Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia turboprops operated via a code sharing agreement with Delta while American was operating Fokker 100 jets to DFW until 1995-96 when American Eagle ATR 72 turboprops took over. In 1999, Delta Connection operated by Atlantic Southeast Airlines Canadair CRJ-200 regional jets were flying nonstop to Atlanta. Also in 1999, Continental was operating one mainline jet flight a day to Houston Intercontinental (IAH) while Continental Express flying nine nonstops a day to Houston (IAH) with Embraer ERJ-145 regional jets and ATR 42 turboprops. In 2010 Continental merged with United Airlines and the Continental Express service from Corpus Christi then began to be operated as United Express.

In 1970, Rio Airways, which was operating as an independent commuter air carrier at the time, was based in Corpus Christi where it operated a hub with nonstop service to the Texas cities of Austin, Brownsville, Houston, Laredo, McAllen and San Antonio flown with Beechcraft 99 turboprops.

<text>City of Colorado Springs Municipal Airport , simply known as Colorado Springs Airport, is a city-owned public civil-military airport southeast of downtown Colorado Springs, in El Paso County, Colorado, United States. It is the second busiest commercial service airport in the state after Denver International Airport. Peterson Space Force Base, which is located on the north side of runway 13/31, is a tenant of the airport.

==History==

In 1927 the airport opened on east of the city, with two gravel runways. For the first ten years several small airlines operated a mail route from Cheyenne, Wyoming, to Pueblo, Colorado, with stops at Denver and Colorado Springs. These airlines only occasionally carried passengers. In 1937, Continental Airlines began service between Denver and El Paso, Texas, with stops at Colorado Springs, Pueblo, Las Vegas, New Mexico, Santa Fe, and Albuquerque. In 1943 Braniff Airways began service on a Denver-Colorado Springs-Pueblo-Amarillo route. At Amarillo, flights would continue onto Dallas and Houston or onto Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Little Rock, and Memphis. The first municipal terminal was built in 1942 in an art deco style. Soon after the terminal was built the field was taken over by the military in the months preceding World War II. After the war, the city regained control.

In 1966 a new terminal was built on the west side of the runways, just east of Powers Boulevard. This terminal expanded by the 1980s, with a six gate addition. By 1991 the airport had three wide runways, one long, making it the longest runway in Colorado until 16R/34L, a runway, opened at Denver International Airport in September 2003. In 1991 the city approved a new terminal, two miles east of the former terminal, in the south-center part of the airport. The terminal opened on October 22, 1994 with 12 gates; it was designed by the Van Sant Group and cost $140 million. In the 1990s a second, five-gate concourse was added on the east side of the main terminal.

In 1996, the 1941 passenger terminal, two hangars, and a caretaker residence — by that time all located on Peterson Air Force Base — were inscribed on the National Register of Historic Places. They form the campus of the Peterson Air and Space Museum.

From the 1980s to the present day, the airport has tried to expand service. The largest number of passengers was nearly 5 million in 1996 when now-defunct Western Pacific Airlines had a hub at COS (Western Pacific moved the hub to Denver International Airport in late 1996). Their timetable for 15 June shows 33 daily departures to 20 airports between the west coast and Newark and Washington Dulles. Frontier Airlines added and dropped various routes from Colorado Springs throughout the 2010s. Southwest Airlines announced in October 2020 that they would begin serving the airport in 2021. Southwest conducted their first flights in March 2021, which has since bolstered the airport&#x27;s commercial traffic.

In May 2021, the airport began a pavement rehabilitation project, closing runway 17R/35L for remodeling. The upgrades include new asphalt, lighting, and navigation equipment. The airport announced in November 2021 that the main concourse (gates 1–12) will undergo a $10–$20 million renovation and will be completed in 3 to 5 years. The concourse was completed in 1994 and has not been renovated since then. The design has become outdated, prompting airport officials to renovate. On March 1, officials announced that COS will receive a $6 million grant to complete the planned renovation. Construction will start in the summer of 2023.

In March 2022, the Colorado Springs Airport released a plan to expand the airport, with plans to double the number of gates from 12 to 24, relocate the control tower, and consolidate other airport services.

In 2024, because of its high elevation, it was used by Boeing for high altitude tests.

==Facilities==
The airport covers and has three paved runways: 17L/35R, long, 17R/35L, and 13/31, .

=== Location and access ===
The airport is located on the east side of Colorado Springs, accessible by Milton E. Proby Parkway via Powers Boulevard/SH 21. Milton E. Proby Parkway loops through the airport running north to the terminal, with exits to long and short term parking and rental car return, and eventually splits into an upper departures drop-off area and lower arrivals pick-up area east of the terminal. The road converges again on the west side of the terminal and runs south, joined by access roads, parking lot exits, and rental car exits. There is also an exit to return to the terminal via the northbound airport entrance.

Milton E. Proby Parkway also provides access to other airport facilities and tenants, including a Northrop Grumman building and an Amazon distribution center via Peak Innovation Parkway.

Powers Boulevard/SH 21, a primary expressway in El Paso County, runs west of the airport and provides easy access to general and private aviation hangars, maintenance facilities (including the SkyWest hangar), and FBOs (Cutter Aviation, , and the J.H.W. Hangar Complex). The expressway also provides north-south access to the Colorado Springs and Falcon (via Highway 24) region.

===Terminal and gate information===
Colorado Springs Airport has one terminal with two concourses. However, only one, the larger concourse housing gates 1–12, has ever been put to commercial use; the second concourse (called the Western Pacific Airlines concourse) contains gates 14–18 (there is no gate 13) and is now mainly used for meetings. Access between the concourses requires leaving the secure area, walking through the main terminal and down a long hallway. There is no public access to these gates. With the announcement of the addition of 12 gates onto the existing terminal, the airport plans to demolish gates 14–18, as they are nearing the end of their useful life.

=== Transportation ===

==== Shuttles and buses ====
The airport is serviced by Colorado Springs&#x27; public transportation system, Mountain Metropolitan Transit. Service from private transportation, such as Groome Transportation, is also available.

==== Rental vehicles ====
Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, Enterprise, Hertz, and National Car Rental provide on-airport car rentals. The rental car check in counters are located on the lower level outside of the secured area, across from baggage claim.

*On March 3, 1991, United Airlines Flight 585, a Boeing 737-291 flying from Peoria, Illinois, to Colorado Springs via Denver, crashed on final approach to Colorado Springs Runway 35 after a rudder malfunction caused the aircraft to roll over and dive, killing all 25 on board.
*On December 21, 1997, a Beechcraft King Air operated by Aviation Charter flying in from Minneapolis St. Paul International Airport impacted terrain at Colorado Springs Airport in fog during a missed instrument landing system (ILS) approach. Both passengers on board were Northwest Airlines mechanics being flown in to repair a Northwest Airlines aircraft at COS. The pilot and one passenger were killed; the other passenger sustained serious injuries.
*On April 16, 2018, a fire broke out on the airport&#x27;s roof. There were no casualties, but the event resulted in the airport being closed for a single day.
*On April 15, 2021, a Learjet 35A operated by &quot;Med Air Inc&quot; suffered substantial damage on landing at COS because of the flight crew&#x27;s improper decision to continue the unstabilized approach, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and impact with the runway during landing. All 4 occupants survived, but the right wing suffered major damage and the aircraft was written off.

<text>Benjamin Travis Laney, Jr. (November 25, 1896January 21, 1977), was an American businessman who served as the 33rd governor of Arkansas from 1945 to 1949.

==Life and career==
Laney was born in Camden, where he attended Ouachita County public schools but never graduated from high school. He was, however, admitted in 1915 to Hendrix College, a liberal arts institution in Conway.

His studies were interrupted by World War I. Laney entered the United States Navy in 1918 and served until the end of the war.

In 1924, Laney earned a degree from the University of Central Arkansas (then known as Arkansas Teacher&#x27;s College), also in Conway. He also took graduate courses from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Laney owned a drugstore in Conway, dealt in real estate, and had interests in cotton gins, feed, and banking. Oil was discovered on Laney&#x27;s farm near Camden. He was hence called &quot;Business Ben&quot; because of his varied business interests.

Laney was elected mayor of Camden in 1935 and served until 1939. In 1944, he successfully ran for governor. In the Democratic primary, Laney polled 70,965 votes (38.6 percent), compared to J. Bryan Sims&#x27;s 63,454 (34.5 percent), and former U.S. Representative David D. Terry&#x27;s 49,685 (27 percent). Sims declined to pursue a party runoff election, and Laney was declared the Democratic nominee. He then overwhelmed the Republican nominee, Harley C. Stump of Stuttgart, 186,401 (86 percent) to 30,422 (14 percent). Stump had also run unsuccessfully in 1940 against Carl E. Bailey.

During the Laney administration, the Public Utilities Commission was formed and funds were appropriated for a stadium to be built in Little Rock. Plans were also formed for the construction of an official Governor&#x27;s Mansion. Laney successfully ran for reelection in 1946. He defeated J. M. Malone in the primary, having polled 125,444 votes, or 64.6 percent of the total. Laney then overwhelmed the Republican W. T. Mills, 128,029 (84.1 percent) to 24,133 (15.9 percent) in the gubernatorial general election. Three Republicans gained seats in the Arkansas House of Representatives, having represented Madison, Newton, and Searcy counties.

Laney sat out a gubernatorial term and unsuccessfully attempted to regain office in 1950, but he failed to unseat the more liberal Democratic incumbent, Sidney Sanders McMath. McMath received 298,559 votes (64 percent) to Laney&#x27;s 112,651 (34.4 percent). Despite having previously served two terms, Laney campaigned against McMath under the slogan, &quot;Re-Elect Ben Laney Governor, For a Second Time.&quot; 

In 1948, Laney was a top choice to serve as the Dixiecrat presidential nominee. At first, he balked and told reporters he would not attend the breakaway convention. However, he changed his mind and made the trip to Birmingham, Alabama. Then he hesitated again and remained in his hotel room. He did not attend the convention and formally withdrew his name from consideration before the nomination was made. The nomination ultimately fell to Strom Thurmond, then the governor of South Carolina.

Laney was a delegate to the 1969 Arkansas Constitutional Convention.

Laney died of a heart attack in Magnolia, the seat of Columbia County south of Camden. He is interred at Camden Memorial Cemetery in Camden, alongside his wife, the former Lucille Kirtley (1906–1992).

<doc id="301149" wikidata="Q650205" url="?curid=301149" title="McAllen Miller International Airport">
<text>McAllen International Airport is an international airport serving McAllen, Mission and the surrounding Lower Rio Grande Valley region of Texas in the United States. It is located within the City of McAllen in Hidalgo County. 

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2025–2029 categorized it as a small hub &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport. In 2023, MFE ranked as the 133rd busiest airport in the United States, with 513,770 enplanements. Passenger enplanements at the airport grew 13.43% between 2022 and 2023. MFE is the busiest airport in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, followed by Valley International Airport in Harlingen,then by Brownsville/South Padre Island International Airport in Brownsville.

==Runways==
McAllen International Airport covers 370 acres (150 ha) at an elevation of 107 feet (33 m). It has two asphalt runways: 14/32 is 7,120 by 150 feet (2,170 x 46 m) and 18/36 is 2,639 by 60 feet (804 x 18 m). In November 2015, runway 13/31 was redesignated 14/32 and an EMAS, engineered materials arrestor system, was installed at the runway 14 approach end.

In the updated 20-year Master Plan for MFE, runway 14/32 will be extended to 10,000 ft and a parallel runway will be added. An expanded cargo apron will be on the south side of the airport.

Runway 14/32 is the primary runway, used by all the airlines and most of the business flights. 3,000 feet will likely be added to Runway 14/32 to allow larger aircraft (Moultan, 2012). Runway 18/36 does not intersect Runway 14/32 so controllers can use both runways if needed. The departure end of Runway 18 is about 1/3 of the way down Runway 14/32, so traffic on final for Runway 36 must be cautious of traffic using Runway 14/32. Class D airports are airports that are less congested but they still have a control tower. This Class D airport has a simple layout and taxiways extend the full length of each runway. Both runways are asphalt and are in good condition. The terminal is easy for all traffic to reach from either runway, but aircraft on runway 14/32 have to cross runway 18/36 to reach the fixed-base operator (FBO). The runways form a V. The terminal, tower, cargo facility, border patrol, and the U.S. Customs apron are all centrally located on the field, easy to access from either runway. On the west side of Runway 18/36, there are multiple hangars, the fixed-base operator, and the fire station. In case of an accident on Runway 14/32, fire and rescue personnel would have to cross Runway 18/36, one possible issue of the layout at MFE.

==Facilities==
The airport has one terminal with six gates. In early 2006, Gate 5 opened on the main concourse due to the arrival of Delta Connection.

In 2008, a terminal capacity study assessed the future needs of the airport and possible terminal expansion to include eight gates, a larger ticketing/office area, and a TSA security area queue. Paid parking at the airport began on November 15, 2007, with the economy, long-term and short-term lots. A revised terminal expansion project with one additional gate, larger passenger waiting areas, expansion of the TSA screening areas, and other facility modifications began in March 2012.

In the year ending October 31, 2018, the airport had 56,613 aircraft operations, an average of 155 per day: 62% general aviation, 17% military, 15% commercial airline and 6% air taxi. In December 2019, 105 aircraft were based at this airport: 49 single-engine, 21 multi-engine, 17 jet, 11 helicopter and 7 military.

==Expansion==

In March 2012, the airport underwent expansion, completed in 2014. Funding was from grants combined from the FAA and the TSA.

The following are planned:
*Addition of 52,000 square feet
*Adding space for new explosives screening unit, bringing the total to three
*Expanding the terminal and adding space for another gate
*Adding space for the Transportation Security Administration
*Sterilizer and steam generator (required for some international flights)
*Replacement of HVAC central plant equipment

The project includes construction of a one-story building addition of about 7,400 square feet at the west end of the terminal building for a checked baggage screening facility and expanded outbound baggage handling system; renovation of about 11,200 square feet at the east end of the terminal building for public lobby improvements, expanded passenger security screening checkpoint, tenant office improvements, and concessions. It includes a two-story addition of about 33,000 square feet at the south end of the terminal building for aircraft boarding gates with passenger boarding bridges, passenger holdrooms, public lobbies, restrooms, concessions, airline operations, and mechanical and electrical equipment rooms; renovation of about 5,000 square feet at the south end of the terminal building for aircraft boarding gate and passenger holdroom improvements. It includes the replacement of HVAC central plant equipment and refurbishment of five existing passenger boarding bridges. Work includes replacement of portions of the aircraft apron as required for building construction, underground utilities work, and apron drainage, and pavement marking and striping for aircraft positions and service vehicle lanes.

Starting in 2027, the airport will undergo an additional expansion of roughly 70,000 square feet adding 4 more gates for a total of 10. A multi story parking garage will be in the works as well with an additional luggage carousel and baggage claim technology adding a total of 3.
==Ground transportation==
Metro McAllen route 4 picks up at Bicentennial and Wichita at the front of the airport, towards stops in downtown McAllen, including McAllen Central Station.

==Airlines and destinations==
;Airlines
American Airlines and United Airlines summer 2015 timetables show main line jets to McAllen while their codesharing partners, American Eagle (Mesa Airlines) and United Express (Mesa Airlines), flew regional jets. American operates Airbus A319s and Boeing 737-800s while American Eagle flies Bombardier CRJ-900s. United flies Airbus A319s, Airbus A320s, Boeing 737-700s and 737-900ERs with United Express flying Bombardier CRJ-700s, Embraer ERJ-135s, Embraer ERJ-145s and Embraer ERJ-175s.

Allegiant Air flights are Airbus A319s and Airbus A320s.

;Destinations
The following airlines operate scheduled passenger service from the airport:

==Current and recent air service==
MFE is the busiest airline airport in the Rio Grande Valley. The airport is also served by all three global alliances, SkyTeam, Star Alliance, and Oneworld. MFE lost its only international flight in September 2007 – a daily Continental Express flight to Mexico City. Mexican air carrier Aeromar operated nonstop service from the airport to the capital of Mexico. After less than one year, it was announced that MFE would lose its only non-stop flight to Los Angeles (LAX), operated by Delta Connection partner ExpressJet Airlines, at the end of 2007; however, Allegiant Air currently flies a seasonal nonstop McAllen to LAX with several flights a week. In December 2007, it was announced that Delta Connection would pull out of McAllen on January 6, 2008, ending its two flights a day from MFE to Atlanta, operated by Delta Connection partner Atlantic Southeast Airlines. In March 2009, Delta, through its wholly owned subsidiary Northwest Airlines, began flying MFE to Memphis on Northwest Airlink partner Pinnacle Airlines. Northwest Airlines had previously flown MFE to its Memphis hub starting in 2004. Following the completion of the merger of Northwest into Delta in 2010, the Memphis hub was eventually shut down although Delta continues to serve MEM.

On September 7, 2010, Delta Connection partner Atlantic Southeast Airlines (ASA) resumed service to MFE essentially taking over the non-stop MFE–MEM route from Pinnacle Airlines. On May 1, 2011, Delta Connection partner ASA began non-stop service from MFE to ATL and ended service from MFE to MEM (flights from MFE to ATL were then operated by ExpressJet following the merger of this regional airline with Atlantic Southeast). This route was discontinued on May 1, 2012.

On May 24, 2009, Allegiant Air began bi-weekly, non-stop service to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), in addition to non-stop service to Orlando Sanford International Airport (SFB) twice a week, and non-stop service to Las Vegas McCarran International Airport (LAS) five times a week. On August 15, 2009, Allegiant announced that it would end service from MFE to LAX; Allegiant later reinstated service and flies non-stop to LAX seasonally from early June to late August.

==Past service==

Trans-Texas Airways (TTa) and successor Texas International Airlines (TI) served the airport for over 32 years and was the only air carrier to do so for many years. In 1949, Trans-Texas 21-seat Douglas DC-3s flew Brownsville - Harlingen - McAllen - Laredo - Carrizo Springs/Crystal City - Eagle Pass - Uvalde - San Antonio - Beeville - Victoria - Houston and back;
TTa also flew direct to El Paso. In 1963, Trans-Texas flights to McAllen were all Convair 240s flying direct to Austin, Corpus Christi, Dallas Love Field, Fort Worth (via now closed Greater Southwest International Airport), Houston, Laredo, Longview, TX, San Antonio, Shreveport, Tyler, TX and Victoria; In 1968 Convair 600s were on all TTa flights from the airport. Jets arrived in 1969; in 1970 Texas International Douglas DC-9-10s flew non-stop to Houston Intercontinental Airport and Corpus Christi and direct to Dallas Love Field. In July 1970 TI was flying McAllen - Harlingen - Houston Intercontinental Airport - Dallas Love Field - Midland/Odessa - Roswell, NM - Albuquerque - Los Angeles, and Convair 600s flew non-stop to Houston and direct to Austin and San Antonio. In 1978, Texas International was all-jet with Douglas DC-9-10s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s nonstop to Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW), Houston (IAH) and San Antonio and direct to Albuquerque, Austin, Denver, Lafayette, LA, Lubbock and New Orleans. In 1980, TI flew nonstop DC-9s to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, Dallas Love Field, and Houston Intercontinental Airport.

==International air service==

On January 11, 2012, Mexican air carrier Aeromar announced it would commence non-stop service to Mexico City beginning in mid-March. Aeromar was the only airline offering international non-stop service from the airport, flying ATR 42 or ATR 72 turboprops on its Mexico City route. On March 18, 2021, Aeromar announced twice a week, non-stop service to Monterrey initiating April 22, 2021. On February 15, 2023, Aeromar ceased all operations.

Trans-Texas Airways (TTa) began flights to Mexico from the airport in 1967; in 1968, TTa had ten non-stop Convair 600s a week to Monterrey and direct six days a week to Tampico and Veracruz via Harlingen. In 1969, Trans-Texas changed its name to Texas International Airlines and, in 1970, was flying daily Douglas DC-9-10s nonstop to Monterrey with a routing of Dallas Love Field (DAL) - Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH) - Harlingen - McAllen - Monterrey. In 1974, Texas International DC-9s were flying nonstop to Mexico City via a routing of Dallas/Fort Worth - Houston Intercontinental - Corpus Christi - McAllen - Mexico City but no longer flew non-stop to Monterrey. In 1975, Texas International was flying non-stop DC-9s from the airport to both Tampico and Veracruz twice a week with these flights continuing on to Mexico City and then non-stop from Mexico City back to McAllen. By the late 1970s, Texas International was no longer flying from the airport to Mexico although the airline was continuing to fly DC-9s non-stop to both Houston and Dallas/Fort Worth.

In 1982 Texas International merged into Continental Airlines and service to Mexico resumed. Texas International initially operated as an independent air carrier; the June 1, 1982 Continental (CO) / Texas International (TI) joint timetable lists non-stop DC-9s twice a day from the airport to Mexico City and non-stop DC-9s four times a week to Guadalajara. By the end of 1983 Continental had pulled out of the airport. Continental returned to McAllen in the mid-1980s with nonstop DC-9s to Houston Intercontinental, and nonstop MD-80s to Mexico City by the mid 1990s. In the mid-2000s Continental had turned over its Mexico City flight to regional codesharing partner Continental Express operated by ExpressJet, flying a daily Embraer ERJ-145 to MEX. This service ended later.

McAllen was served by Aeromexico partner Aerolitoral via a codesharing agreement during the mid-1990s. In 1994 Aerolitoral was flying up to four non-stops a day to Monterrey with Fairchild Swearingen Metroliners continuing direct to Chihuahua, Leon, San Luis Potosi, Tampico or Villahermosa.

==Past jet service==

After merging with Texas International Airlines in 1982, Continental Airlines began serving McAllen, mainly non-stop to its hub at Houston Intercontinental Airport. Continental flew Boeing 727-100s, 727-200s, 737-300s, 737-500s, 737-800s, 757-200s, Douglas DC-9-10s, McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s and MD-80s to McAllen. Continental also flew one-stop direct service to Atlanta, Chicago (ORD), Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW), Kansas City, Miami, New Orleans, Pensacola, Seattle and Tampa. In 1994, the airline was flying MD-80s direct to Anchorage, Alaska via Houston and Seattle. Continental merged with United Airlines in 2010.

In 1982, Austin-based Emerald Air (United States) operated Pan Am Express service in Texas via an agreement with Pan Am and flew two Douglas DC-9-10 flights a day to Houston Intercontinental Airport and San Antonio. By 1984, Emerald Air was serving McAllen independently with up to eleven departures a day, all DC-9s. Emerald was flying non-stop to Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston Intercontinental, San Antonio and Corpus Christi, and one-stop to Austin. This airline went out of business in 1985.

Muse Air and successor TranStar Airlines served McAllen in the mid 1980s. In 1985, Houston-based Muse Air was operating up to five departures a day non-stop to its hub at Houston Hobby Airport with McDonnell Douglas DC-9-50s, all continuing direct to Dallas Love Field. Muse Air was acquired by Southwest Airlines which changed the Muse Air name to TranStar, and continued independently with nonstop DC-9-50s to Houston Hobby and one-stop to Dallas Love Field. TranStar went out of business in 1987.

American Airlines began serving the airport about January 1991. In 1991, American had three daily McDonnell Douglas MD-80s to its Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) hub and, by 1995, was flying four daily Fokker 100s to DFW. In 2007, American had up to four nonstop MD80s a day to Dallas/Fort Worth. AA had one-stop MD-80s to Atlanta, El Paso, Oakland, and Raleigh/Durham. American and regional affiliate American Eagle continue to serve the airport.

Trans World Airlines (TWA) also served McAllen. In 2001, TWA McDonnell Douglas MD-80s flew nonstop to Austin and one-stop to its St. Louis hub. By the end of 2001, Trans World Airlines had merged into American Airlines.

Delta Connection operated by Atlantic Southeast Airlines flew to Delta&#x27;s Atlanta hub. In 2007, Delta Connection had two nonstops a day to ATL with Canadair CRJ-200s for Delta Air Lines in a codesharing agreement. This service ended in 2012. Prior to the merger of Northwest Airlines with Delta in 2010, Northwest DC-9s flew nonstop to its Memphis hub in 2004, followed by Northwest Airlink nonstops to MEM on codesharing partner Pinnacle Airlines Canadair CRJ-200s in 2009.

==Past commuter airlines==

In the late 1970s, Tejas Airlines flew Fairchild Swearingen Metroliners nonstop to San Antonio.

McAllen was served by Austin-based Conquest Airlines from the late 1980s to the mid 1990s; in 1989, it flew Beechcraft 1900Cs nonstop to San Antonio. By 1994, Conquest was flying nonstop to Austin, Laredo and San Antonio and one-stop to Tyler, TX, all on Metroliners.

<text>Władysław Stefan Komar (11 April 1940 – 17 August 1998) was a Polish shot putter, actor and cabaretist. Competing in three Summer Olympics between 1964 and 1972, he won the gold medal at the Munich Games in 1972 with a throw of 21.18 metres. His nickname was &quot;King Kong&quot; Komar as attributed to a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article.

His personal bests in the shot put were 21.19 metres outdoors (Warsaw 1974) and 20.32 metres indoors (Grenoble 1972), both being national records during his career.

==Early life==
Władysław Komar was born in Kaunas, Lithuania on 11 April 1940 to Władysław Komar-Zabożyński and Wanda Jasińska. As a Polish noble family they owned a mansion in Rogówek (Lithuanian: Raguvėlė). Both of his parents were athletes – his father competed for Lithuania as Vladas Komaras at the 1934 European Athletics Championships in the high jump and 110 metres hurdles; his mother was a shot putter, who set a national record in the early 1930s. During World War Two the family moved to Gulbiny (Lithuanian: Didieji Gulbinai). His father, who during the war helped the Polish anti-German resistance movement, the Home Army, was murdered in 1944 in Glitiškės by a group of Ypatingasis būrys militia.
After the entrance of the Red Army in 1945 young Wladysław escaped with his mother and older sister to Warsaw as the mother feared they might get sent to Siberia by the Soviets like many former land owners. They first travelled through Białystok to Warsaw before his being placed in an orphanage near Poznań, in Western Poland. In 1953, after graduating from primary school by the orphanage, his mother brought him to live with her in Warsaw.

==Boxing career==
The first sport that Komar took up was amateur boxing, which he started practising in 1955 and competed in the heavyweight category. He went as far as representing his country at the under-20 level. His last fight was in a junior team match against Italy in 1959 when he was knocked out by Giorgio Masteghin in the first round. After that he got convinced to switch to athletics although initially he also practised rugby and handball.

==Athletics career==
At the beginning of his athletics career he also competed in the high jump and decathlon. He even set a Polish record in the latter in 1963. Komar&#x27;s major championships debut came at the 1962 European Championships in Belgrade where he finished fourth behind compatriot Alfred Sosgórnik. In February next year he threw 18.60 metres, his first national record. In June 1964, he improved the national record to 19.50 metres, just 6 centimetres shy of the European record. This result made him one of the favourites for the October Olympic Games held in Tokyo, however, he only managed ninth place with 18.20 metres. In 1966 he set the Polish indoor record of 19.20 metres and later that year the outdoor record of 19.61. Afterwards he competed at his second European Championships in Budapest where he managed the bronze.

At his third Olympic Games, in Munich, he won the shot put competition throwing 21.18 metres, just one centimetre further than the American George Woods and four ahead of East Germans, Briesenick and Gies.

==After retirement==
Komar later became an actor, appearing in more than ten films, including &quot;Kazimierz Wielki&quot; (1976), Soviet &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; (1986), Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Pirates&quot; (1986), as well as &quot;Magnat&quot; (1987) and &quot;Kiler&quot; (1997).

He took part in the professional wrestling show, organised by a former Polish Olympic wrestler, Andrzej Supron, which toured the Soviet Union in 1989 and 1990.

==Death==
He died on 17 August 1998 in a car crash coming back from an athletics meeting in Międzyzdroje together with another Olympic gold medallist, pole vaulter Tadeusz Ślusarski. The car they hit was driven by another athlete, former sprinter, Jarosław Marzec, who died several days later. A memorial athletics meeting in their name is held every year in Międzyzdroje.

==Personal life==
Władysław Komar was married twice. His first wife, Małgorzata Spychalska (b. 1942), was a daughter of Marian Spychalski, a prominent Polish communist politician. They divorced in 1973.
With his second wife Maria (1950–2008), a former volleyball player, he had one son Mikołaj (b. 1977) who went on to become a photographer.
