<text>Leicester City Football Club is a professional football club based in the city of Leicester, East Midlands, England. The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football, following promotion from the 2023–24 EFL Championship as league champions.

The club was founded in 1884 as Leicester Fosse F.C, and became known as Leicester City in 1919. They moved to Filbert Street in 1891, were elected to the Football League in 1894 and moved to the nearby King Power Stadium in 2002.

Leicester City have won five major honours, including one Premier League, one FA Cup and three League Cups. They have also won the FA Community Shield twice, in 1971 and 2021. The club&#x27;s 2015–16 Premier League title win attracted global attention, and they became one of seven clubs to have won the Premier League since its inception in 1992. Prior to this, Leicester&#x27;s highest league finish was second place in the top flight in 1928–29.

The club has competed in seven European campaigns to date, reaching the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals in 2016–17 and UEFA Europa Conference League semi-finals in 2021–22. They have played in the FA Cup final five times, winning their first title in 2021. Leicester won the League Cup in 1964, 1997 and 2000 respectively, and were finalists in 1964–65 and 1998–99.

==History==

===Founding and early years (1884–1949)===
Formed in 1884 by a group of old boys of Wyggeston School as &quot;Leicester Fosse&quot;, the club joined The Football Association (FA) in 1890. Before moving to Filbert Street in 1891, the club played at five different grounds, including Victoria Park south-east of the city centre and the Belgrave Road Cycle and Cricket Ground. The club also joined the Midland League in 1891, and were elected to Division Two of the Football League in 1894 after finishing second. Leicester&#x27;s first Football League game was a 4–3 defeat at Grimsby Town, with a first League win the following week, against Rotherham United at Filbert Street. The same season also saw the team&#x27;s largest win to date, a 13–0 victory over Notts Olympic in an FA Cup qualifying game. In 1907–08 the club finished as Second Division runners-up, gaining promotion to the First Division, the highest level of English football. However, the club was relegated after a single season which included the team&#x27;s record defeat, a 12–0 loss against Nottingham Forest.

In 1919, when league football resumed after World War I, Leicester Fosse ceased trading due to financial difficulties. The club was reformed as &quot;Leicester City Football Club&quot;, particularly appropriate as the borough of Leicester had recently been given city status. Following the name change, the club enjoyed moderate success in the 1920s; under the management of Peter Hodge, who left in May 1926 to be replaced two months later by Willie Orr, and with record goalscorer Arthur Chandler in the side, they won the Division Two title in 1924–25 and recorded their second-highest league finish in 1928–29 as runners-up by a single point to The Wednesday. However, the 1930s saw a downturn in fortunes, with the club relegated in 1934–35 and, after promotion in 1936–37, another relegation in 1938–39 would see them finish the decade in Division Two.

===Post-World War II (1949–2000)===
Leicester reached the FA Cup final for the first time in their history in 1949, losing 3–1 to Wolverhampton Wanderers. The club, however, was celebrating a week later when a draw on the last day of the season ensured survival in Division Two. Leicester won the Division Two championship in 1954, with the help of Arthur Rowley, one of the club&#x27;s most prolific strikers. Although they were relegated from Division One the next season, under Dave Halliday they returned in 1957, with Rowley scoring a club record 44 goals in one season. Leicester remained in Division One until 1969, their longest period in the top flight.

Under the management of Matt Gillies and his assistant Bert Johnson, Leicester reached the FA Cup final on another two occasions, but lost in both 1961 and 1963. As they lost to double winners Tottenham Hotspur in 1961, they were England&#x27;s representatives in the 1961–62 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. In the 1962–63 season, the club led the First Division during the winter. Thanks to a sensational run of form on icy and frozen pitches, the team became nicknamed the &quot;&quot;Ice Kings&quot;&quot; and eventually finished fourth, the club&#x27;s best post-war finish. Gillies guided Leicester to their first piece of silverware in 1964, when Leicester beat Stoke City 4–3 on aggregate to win the League Cup for the first time. Leicester also reached the League Cup final the following year but lost 3–2 on aggregate to Chelsea. Gillies and Johnson received praise for their version of the &quot;whirl&quot; and the &quot;switch&quot; system, a system that had previously been used by the Austrian and Hungarian national teams. After a bad start to the season, Matt Gillies resigned in November 1968. His successor Frank O&#x27;Farrell was unable to prevent relegation, but the club reached the FA Cup final in 1969, losing to Manchester City 1–0.

In 1971, Leicester were promoted back to the First Division, and won the Charity Shield for the first time. Due to double winners Arsenal&#x27;s commitments in European competition, Second Division winners Leicester were invited to play FA Cup runners-up Liverpool, beating them 1–0 thanks to a goal by Steve Whitworth. Jimmy Bloomfield was appointed for the new season, and his team remained in the First Division for his tenure. Leicester reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1973–74.

Frank McLintock, a noted player for seven years for Leicester in a successful period from the late 1950s to the mid-1960s, succeeded Bloomfield in 1977. On 19 March 1977, Winston White became Leicester&#x27;s first black player in an away game at Stoke City. The club was relegated at the end of that season and McLintock resigned. Jock Wallace resumed the tradition of successful Scottish managers (after Peter Hodge and Matt Gillies) by steering Leicester to the Second Division championship in 1980. Wallace was unable to keep Leicester in the First Division, but they reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1982. Under Wallace, one of City&#x27;s most famous home-grown players, Gary Lineker, emerged into the first-team squad. Leicester&#x27;s next manager was Gordon Milne, who achieved promotion in 1983. Lineker helped Leicester maintain their place in the First Division, but was sold to Everton in 1985; two years later Leicester were relegated, having failed to find a suitable replacement to partner Alan Smith, who was sold to Arsenal after Leicester went down.

Milne left in 1986 and was replaced in 1987 by David Pleat, who was sacked in January 1991 with Leicester in danger of relegation to the Third Division. Gordon Lee was put in charge of the club until the end of the season. Leicester won their final game of the season, which guided them clear of relegation to the third tier of the Football League.

Brian Little took over in 1991 and by the end of the 1991–92 season Leicester had reached the playoff final for a place in the new Premier League, but lost to Blackburn Rovers by way of a penalty from former Leicester striker Mike Newell. The club also reached the playoff final the following year, losing 4–3 to Swindon Town, having come back from 3–0 down. In 1993–94, Leicester were promoted from the playoffs, beating Derby County 2–1 in the final. Little quit as Leicester manager the following November to take charge at Aston Villa, and his successor Mark McGhee was unable to save Leicester from finishing second-from-bottom in the 1994–95 season.

McGhee left the club unexpectedly in December 1995, while Leicester were top of the First Division, to take charge of Wolverhampton Wanderers. McGhee was replaced by Martin O&#x27;Neill. Under O&#x27;Neill, Leicester qualified for the 1996 Football League play-offs and beat Crystal Palace 2–1 in the final through a 120th-minute Steve Claridge goal to gain promotion to the Premier League. Following promotion, Leicester established themselves in the Premier League with four successive top ten finishes. O&#x27;Neill ended Leicester&#x27;s 33-year wait for a major trophy, winning the League Cup twice, in 1997 and 2000, and Leicester were runners-up in 1999. Thus, the club qualified for the UEFA Cup in 1997–98 and 2000–01, the club&#x27;s first European competition since 1961. In June 2000, O&#x27;Neill left Leicester City to take over as manager of Celtic.

=== Decline in the early 21st century (2000–2008) ===
Martin O&#x27;Neill was replaced by former England under-21 coach Peter Taylor. During this time, one of Leicester&#x27;s European appearances ended in a 3–1 defeat to Red Star Belgrade on 28 September 2000 in the UEFA Cup. Leicester began well under Taylor&#x27;s management, topping the Premier League for two weeks in the autumn and remaining in contention for a European place for most of the campaign, before a late-season collapse dragged them down to a 13th-place finish.

Taylor was sacked after a poor start to the 2001–02 season, and his successor Dave Bassett lasted just six months before being succeeded by his assistant Micky Adams, the change of management being announced just before relegation was confirmed. Leicester won just five league matches all season.

Leicester moved into the new 32,314-seat Walkers Stadium at the start of the 2002–03 season, ending 111 years at Filbert Street. Walkers, the Leicester-based crisp manufacturers, acquired the naming rights for a ten-year period. In October 2002, the club went into administration with debts of £30 million. Some of the reasons were the loss of TV money (ITV Digital, itself in administration, had promised money to First Division clubs for TV rights), the large wage bill, lower-than-expected fees for players transferred to other clubs and the cost of the new stadium. Adams was banned from the transfer market for most of the season, even after the club was rescued with a takeover by a consortium led by Gary Lineker. Adams guided Leicester to the runners-up spot in Division One and automatic promotion back to the Premier League with more than 90 points. However, Leicester lasted only one season in the top flight and were relegated to the newly labelled Championship, previously known as Division One.

When Adams resigned as manager in October 2004, Craig Levein was appointed boss. This would prove to be an unsuccessful period and after 15 months in charge, Levein was sacked, having failed to get The Foxes anywhere near the promotion places. Assistant manager Rob Kelly took over as caretaker manager, and after winning three out of four matches, was appointed to see out the rest of the season. Kelly steered Leicester to safety and in April 2006 was given the manager&#x27;s job on a permanent basis.

In October 2006, ex-Portsmouth chairman Milan Mandarić was quoted as saying he was interested in buying the club, reportedly at a price of around £6 million, with the current playing squad valued at roughly £4.2 million. The takeover was formally announced on 13 February 2007. On 11 April 2007, Rob Kelly was sacked as manager and Nigel Worthington appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season. Worthington saved the club from relegation, but was not offered the job on a permanent basis. On 25 May 2007, the club announced former Milton Keynes Dons manager Martin Allen as their new manager with a three-year contract. Allen&#x27;s relationship with Mandarić became tense and after only four matches, Allen left by mutual consent on 29 August 2007. On 13 September 2007, Mandarić announced Gary Megson as the new manager of the club, citing Megson&#x27;s &quot;wealth of experience&quot; as a deciding factor in the appointment. However, Megson left on 24 October 2007 after only six weeks in charge, following an approach made for his services by Bolton Wanderers. Mandarić placed Frank Burrows and Gerry Taggart in the shared position as caretaker managers until a professional manager was appointed.

On 22 November, Ian Holloway was appointed manager, and he became the first Leicester manager in over 50 years to win his first league match in charge, beating Bristol City 2–0. However, this success did not last, and Leicester were relegated from the Championship at the end of the 2007–08 season. Holloway left by mutual consent after less than a season at the club, being replaced by Nigel Pearson.

===Rise back to Premier League and change of ownership (2008–2015)===
The 2008–09 campaign was Leicester&#x27;s first season outside the top two levels of English football, but they hit this nadir only seven years before becoming the 2015–16 Premier League champions – one of the fastest rises to the top of the English football league system. Following relegation to the third tier the previous season, Leicester returned to the Championship at the first attempt in 2008–09, finishing as champions of League One after a 2–0 win at Southend United, with two matches in hand. The 2009–10 season saw Leicester&#x27;s revival under manager Nigel Pearson continue, as the club finished fifth and reached the Championship play-offs in their first season back in the second tier. Though coming from 2–0 down on aggregate, away to Cardiff City, to briefly lead 3–2, they eventually lost to a penalty shoot-out in the play-off semi-final. At the end of the season, Pearson left Leicester to become the manager of Hull City, claiming he felt the club seemed reluctant to keep him, and that Paulo Sousa had been the club&#x27;s guest at both play-off games, hinting at a possible replacement. On 7 July 2010, Sousa was confirmed as Pearson&#x27;s replacement.

In August 2010, following agreement on a three-year shirt sponsorship deal with duty-free retailers the King Power Group, Mandarić sold the club to Thai-led consortium Asian Football Investments (AFI), fronted by King Power Group&#x27;s Vichai and his son Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha. Mandarić, an investor in AFI, was retained as club chairman. On 1 October 2010, after a poor start that saw Leicester bottom of the Championship with only one win out of the first nine league matches, Paulo Sousa was sacked by the club with immediate effect. Two days later, Sven-Göran Eriksson, who had been approached by the club after the 6–1 loss to then bottom-of-the-table Portsmouth two weeks earlier, was appointed as his replacement, signing a two-year contract with the club. On 10 February 2011, Vichai, part of the Thai-based Asia Football Investments consortium, was appointed new chairman of the club after Mandarić left in November to take over Sheffield Wednesday.

Leicester were viewed as one of the favourites for promotion in the 2011–12 season, but on 24 October 2011, following an inconsistent start with the Foxes winning just 5 out of their first 13 matches, Eriksson left the club by mutual consent. Three weeks later, Nigel Pearson returned to the club as Eriksson&#x27;s successor. Pearson would go on to lead The Foxes to a sixth-place finish in the 2012–13 season, ensuring Leicester were in the Championship play-offs. However, Leicester lost the playoff semi-final 3–2 on aggregate to Watford after Manuel Almunia made a double save from an Anthony Knockaert late penalty and Troy Deeney scored at the other end following a swift counterattack.

In 2014, Leicester&#x27;s march up the league system hit a breakthrough. Their 2–1 home win over Sheffield Wednesday, combined with losses by Queens Park Rangers and Derby County, allowed Leicester City to clinch promotion to the Premier League after a ten-year absence. Later that month, a win at Bolton Wanderers saw Leicester become champions of the 2013–14 Championship, a joint record 7th second-tier title.

Leicester started their first season in the Premier League since 2004 with a good run of results in their first five league matches, starting with a 2–2 draw on the opening day against Everton. The Foxes then claimed their first Premier League win since May 2004, with a 1–0 win at Stoke City. On 21 September 2014, Leicester went on to produce one of the greatest comebacks in Premier League history, beating Manchester United 5–3 at King Power Stadium. They made Premier League history by becoming the first team to beat Manchester United from a two-goal deficit since the league&#x27;s launch in 1992.

During the 2014–15 season, a dismal run of form saw the team slip to the bottom of the league table with only 19 points from 29 matches. By 3 April 2015, they were seven points adrift from safety. This could have brought a sudden end to Leicester&#x27;s seven-year rise, but seven wins from their final nine league matches meant The Foxes finished the season in 14th place with 41 points. They finished the season with a 5–1 thrashing of relegated Queens Park Rangers, and Leicester&#x27;s upturn in results was described as one of the Premier League&#x27;s greatest escapes from relegation. They also became only the third team in Premier League history to survive after being bottom at Christmas (the other two being West Bromwich Albion in 2005 and Sunderland in 2014), and no team with fewer than 20 points from 29 matches had previously stayed up.

===Premier League champions, FA Cup winners, relegation and promotion (2015–present)===
On 30 June 2015, Nigel Pearson was sacked, with the club stating &quot;the working relationship is no longer viable.&quot; The sacking was linked to a number of public relations issues involving Pearson throughout the season, with the final straw involving his son James&#x27; role in a &quot;racist sex tape&quot; made by three Leicester reserve players in Thailand during a post-season goodwill tour. Leicester reacted by appointing former Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri as their new manager for the new 2015–16 Premier League season. Despite an initially sceptical reaction to Ranieri&#x27;s appointment, the club made an exceptional start to the season. Striker Jamie Vardy scored 13 goals over 11 consecutive matches from August to November, breaking Ruud van Nistelrooy&#x27;s Premier League record of scoring in 10 consecutive matches. On 19 December, Leicester defeated Everton 3–2 at Goodison Park to top the Premier League on Christmas Day, having been bottom exactly 12 months earlier. A 2–0 victory at Sunderland on 10 April, coupled with Tottenham Hotspur&#x27;s 3–0 win over Manchester United, ensured Leicester&#x27;s qualification for the UEFA Champions League for the first time in their history.

Leicester won the Premier League on 2 May 2016 after Tottenham lost a 2–0 lead against Chelsea, drawing 2–2 at the &quot;Battle of Stamford Bridge&quot;. Bookmakers thought Leicester&#x27;s victory was so unlikely that Ladbrokes and William Hill offered odds of 5,000–1 for it at the start of the season, which subsequently resulted in the largest payout in British sporting history with total winnings of £25 million. A number of newspapers described Leicester&#x27;s title win as the greatest sporting shock; multiple bookmakers including Ladbrokes and William Hill had never paid out at such long odds for any sport. One book was titled &quot;The Unbelievables&quot;, a spin-off harking back to Arsenal&#x27;s undefeated team &quot;The Invincibles&quot;. The scale of the surprise title victory attracted global attention for the club and the city of Leicester. &quot;The Economist&quot; declared it would be &quot;pored over for management lessons.&quot; Several commentators viewed it as an inspiration to other clubs and fundamentally transforming expectations.

Leicester became known for their counterattacking style of play, &quot;incredible pace in the areas it is most essential&quot; and defensive solidarity. Former boss Nigel Pearson was credited by pundits and fans as having laid the foundations for Leicester&#x27;s title winning season. Reacting to the title win, then executive chairman of the Premier League Richard Scudamore said:

Leicester, while performing well in the UEFA Champions League, struggled domestically during 2016–17, spending much of the first few months in the bottom half of the Premier League table. In December 2016, Ranieri was awarded coach of the year and Leicester team of the year at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year. However, on 23 February 2017, Ranieri was dismissed due to the club&#x27;s continuing poor form, resulting in them being only one point above the relegation zone. The sacking was met with significant upset and anger from sections of the media, with Gary Lineker calling the sacking &quot;very sad&quot; and &quot;inexplicable&quot;, while Manchester United manager José Mourinho blamed it on &quot;selfish players&quot;. Rumours began emerging some days later that players had been meeting with the owners to discuss Ranieri&#x27;s sacking without Ranieri knowing, which sparked widespread outrage over social media, but these were never proven. Craig Shakespeare took over as caretaker manager, and in his first match in charge, Leicester won 3–1 against 5th placed Liverpool. In his second match as caretaker, Shakespeare led Leicester to another 3–1 victory over Hull City. Following those two results, it was decided on 12 March 2017 that Shakespeare would become manager until the end of the season.

The 2016–17 campaign was also the first season in 15 years that Leicester qualified for European football. Leicester were placed in Group G of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League, alongside Porto, Copenhagen and Club Brugge. In their inaugural Champions League campaign, they went undefeated in their first five matches to progress to the knockout stages as group winners. &quot;The Foxes&quot; then faced La Liga club Sevilla in the round of 16 and defeated the Spanish side 2–0 on the night, and 3–2 on aggregate to advance to the quarter-finals. There they faced Atlético Madrid, and drew 1–1 in the second leg, but lost 2–1 on aggregate after losing 1–0 in the first leg. This put an end to Leicester&#x27;s 2016–17 European campaign, and they finished as Champions League quarter-finalists. Despite the loss, Leicester remained unbeaten at home in the 2016–17 Champions League.

Craig Shakespeare, having impressed during his caretaker spell, was appointed full-time on a three-year contract. However, following a poor start to the season he was sacked in October 2017 after four months officially in charge, with Leicester in 18th place in the table. He was replaced by former Southampton boss Claude Puel on 25 October 2017. By Christmas, Leicester were in 8th place in the Premier League and finished 9th at the end of the season.

On 27 October 2018, a Leonardo AW169 helicopter carrying chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and four others malfunctioned and crashed outside the club&#x27;s stadium, shortly after taking off from the pitch. This followed a home match against West Ham United, and all five people on board the helicopter died. One year later, The Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha Memorial Garden officially opened on 27 October 2019, before The Khun Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha Statue was unveiled on 4 April 2022, which would have been Srivaddhanaprabha&#x27;s 64th birthday.

Leicester suffered a poor run of results in 2019 which included four successive home defeats, and following a 4–1 home defeat to Crystal Palace, manager Claude Puel was sacked on 24 February 2019 with the club in 12th place. Former Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was appointed as his replacement, and the club finished the season again in 9th place.

The 2019–20 season started with the team picking up 38 points from their first 16 matches, which included a record eight-game winning streak from 19 October to 8 December. On 25 October 2019, Leicester recorded a 0–9 away win at Southampton, the joint-largest win in Premier League history and the largest away win in English top-flight history. In the same season, the club reached the semi-final stage of the League Cup but lost out to Aston Villa over two legs. Despite being in the top four for most of the season, Leicester suffered a drop-off in form at the end of the season, winning only two of their nine games following the resumption of league play due to the coronavirus pandemic. Three defeats in their last four matches saw them slide into fifth, the second-highest Premier League finish in their history, securing a place in the UEFA Europa League for the following season.

On 15 May 2021, Leicester City won the FA Cup for the first time (having lost all of their previous four finals), securing a second major trophy in the space of five years; Youri Tielemans scored the only goal against Chelsea at Wembley Stadium. The club also went on to win the 2021 FA Community Shield on 7 August 2021, the second in their history. After finishing 5th again in the 2020–21 Premier League, Leicester qualified for the Europa League for the second consecutive year. In their 2021–22 UEFA Europa League campaign, Leicester came third in their group and were transferred to the newly established UEFA Europa Conference League. They went on to reach their first European semi-final, losing to eventual winners AS Roma over two legs. In the Premier League, the club finished in 8th place.

The club&#x27;s finances were heavily impacted by the COVID pandemic, with the parent company King Power International Group being in the travel retail (DF&amp;TR) sector. During the 2022 summer transfer window, Leicester were restricted in their spending amid concerns over breaching Financial Fair Play regulations. In addition to this, the previous summer saw the club spent more than £50 million on new players without selling a key player for profit. This dramatically increased their wages-to-turnover ratio, and failure to qualify for European football in the preceding season (2021–22) was also a factor in reduced spending during the summer of 2022. At the same time, the club were also continuing to balance investment in infrastructure, to better compete with the Premier League&#x27;s &#x27;big six&#x27; in the long term.

Brendan Rodgers left the club on 2 April 2023, after four years in charge, with ten games remaining and the team in the relegation zone. Dean Smith was appointed as his replacement until the end of the season. On 28 May, despite a 2–1 home win over West Ham United, Leicester City were relegated as a consequence of Everton&#x27;s 1–0 home victory over AFC Bournemouth. This ended the club&#x27;s nine-year stint in the Premier League, making them only the second former Premier League champions to be relegated from the league since it began in 1992–93, following Blackburn Rovers in 1998–99.
On 16 June 2023, Enzo Maresca was appointed as the club&#x27;s new manager ahead of the 2023–24 EFL Championship season. Leicester went on to make their best start to a league season, and the best since the league became known as the Championship in 2004–05. They were promoted back to the Premier League as champions at the first attempt. This was also their eighth second tier title which is a record for the division.

==Club identity==


The club&#x27;s traditional home colours of royal blue shirts, white shorts and either white or blue socks have been used for the team&#x27;s kits throughout most of its history. In more recent times, the club have alternated between either white or blue shorts.

An image of a fox was first incorporated into the club crest in 1948. Since 1992, the club&#x27;s badge has featured a fox&#x27;s head overlaid onto a cinquefoil similar to the one used on the coat of arms of Leicester.

The club&#x27;s stadium move in 2002 prompted some changes to the crest, and the design has since evolved further. For the 2009–10 season, the club&#x27;s 125th anniversary year, a special edition crest was worn on the home and away kits. For this season&#x27;s away kit, there was also a return to the first colours worn by the club (originally Leicester Fosse), albeit with black shorts as opposed to the original white. This kit returned once again for the 2023–24 season, having also featured during the 2004–05 season.

In 1941, the club adopted the playing of the &quot;Post Horn Galop&quot; at home matches, to signal both teams entering the pitch. To the present day, the tune is usually played live on the pitch for the first half, while a modern version of the tune is played over the PA system for the second half. The club also play a modern version of their anthem &quot;When You&#x27;re Smiling&quot; before kick-off on home matchdays, with the connection to the song dating back to the late 1970s. &quot;Foxes Never Quit&quot; is the club&#x27;s motto, with these words placed above the tunnel inside the stadium.

===Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors===
Source:

Since 2018, Leicester City&#x27;s kit has been manufactured by German sportswear company Adidas. Previous manufacturers have included Bukta (1972–76, 1990–92), Admiral (1976–79, 1983–88), Umbro (1979–83), Scoreline (1988–90), Fox Leisure (1992–2000), Le Coq Sportif (1999–2005), JJB (2005–07), Jako (2007–09), Joma (2009–10), Burrda (2010–12) and Puma (2012–18).

The club&#x27;s current main shirt sponsor is BC.GAME. The first sponsorship logo to appear on a Leicester shirt was that of Ind Coope in 1983. British snack food manufacturer Walkers Crisps are the club&#x27;s official snack partner. Walkers Crisps have held a long association with the club, sponsoring their shirts from 1987 to 2001 and the stadium from 2002 to 2011. Other sponsors have included John Bull (1986–87), LG (2001–03), Alliance &amp; Leicester (2003–07), Topps Tiles (2007–09), Loros (2009–10), King Power (2010–21, 2023–24), Tourism Authority of Thailand (2020–21) and FBS (2021–23). Siam Commercial Bank became the club&#x27;s first sleeve sponsor, and the deal was valid for the 2017–18 season. Since the 2018–19 season, the sleeve sponsor has been Bia Saigon.

==Stadium and training ground==

In their early years, Leicester played at numerous grounds, but have only played at two since they joined the Football League. When first starting out, they played on a field by Fosse Road, hence the original club name Leicester Fosse. They moved from there to Victoria Park, and subsequently to Belgrave Road. Upon turning professional the club moved to Mill Lane. After eviction from Mill Lane the club played at the County Cricket ground while seeking a new ground. The club secured the use of an area of land by Filbert Street and moved there in 1891.

Some improvements by noted football architect Archibald Leitch occurred in the Edwardian era, and in 1927 a new two-tier stand was built, nicknamed &quot;the Double Decker&quot;, which would persist until the ground&#x27;s closure in 2002. With the exception of the addition of compulsory seating, the ground saw no further development until 1993, when the Main Stand was demolished and replaced by the new Carling Stand. The addition of the new stand, while the rest of the ground had been untouched since the 1920s, led manager Martin O&#x27;Neill to joke that he used to &quot;lead new signings out backwards&quot; so they only saw the Carling Stand.


The club moved away from Filbert Street in 2002, to a new 32,500-capacity all-seater stadium located less than 300 yards away. The site&#x27;s address, Filbert Way, retains a link with the club&#x27;s former home. The first match hosted at the stadium was a 1–1 friendly draw against Athletic Bilbao, Bilbao&#x27;s Tiko scored the first goal at the stadium and Jordan Stewart became the first Leicester player to score. The first competitive match was a 2–0 victory against Watford.

The stadium was known as the Walkers Stadium until 2011 in a sponsorship deal with Leicester-based food manufacturers Walkers. On 19 August 2010, it emerged that the new owners King Power wanted to rename the stadium King Power Stadium, and had plans to increase the capacity to 42,000 should Leicester secure promotion. On 5 July 2011, it was announced that the Walkers Stadium would now be known as King Power Stadium.

The stadium currently has an all-seated capacity of 32,262, with plans formally approved in December 2023 to extend this to 40,000. In 2020, the club moved into a new state-of-the-art training complex in the Leicestershire village of Seagrave, described as being &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most advanced training facilities.&quot; The club&#x27;s former training ground Belvoir Drive now serves as the training ground for Leicester City Women.

==Rivalries, support and hooliganism==
The club&#x27;s main rivals are Nottingham Forest, Derby County and Coventry City. Lesser rivalries also exist with Chelsea and more recently Tottenham Hotspur. Leicester were widely considered to be Nottingham Forest&#x27;s main rivals prior to the mid-1970s. However, when Brian Clough was appointed as Forest manager in 1975, much to the dismay of Derby fans, the rivalry between Forest and Derby quickly intensified. The Leicester-Forest rivalry is however, still prominent on the border of both cities, and on the border of both counties (Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire).

The origin of the club&#x27;s anthem &quot;When You&#x27;re Smiling&quot;, sung by supporters at home and away matches, dates back to the late 1970s with a modern version of the tune currently played before kick-off on home matchdays. Like many other clubs in English football, Leicester have had links to hooliganism. In England and Wales, Leicester were listed as the second most violent football club in August 2000, and averaged the fifth highest number of hooligans at matches between 2019 and 2023. During the 2022–23 and 2023–24 seasons, the club were ranked third and fourth respectively for football banning orders.

==Managerial history==
Leicester City&#x27;s current manager is Ruud van Nistelrooy. Nigel Pearson and Peter Hodge have both had two separate spells in charge of the club. Dave Bassett also had a second spell as caretaker manager after his spell as permanent coach. Up until Peter Hodge was hired after World War I, the club had no official manager. A nominal role of secretary/manager was employed, though the board and the selection committee took control of most team affairs. It was Hodge who instated a system at the club for the manager having complete control over player and staff recruitment, team selection, and tactics. Though Hodge was originally also titled &quot;secretary/manager&quot; he has retrospectively been named as the club&#x27;s first official &quot;manager.&quot;

==Records and statistics==

Graham Cross holds the record for the most Leicester appearances, with the defender playing 600 games between 1960 and 1976, increased from 599 following the club&#x27;s decision to incorporate the 1971 Charity Shield into official records. However, Adam Black holds the record for the most appearances in the league with 528 between 1920 and 1935.

Striker Arthur Chandler is currently the club&#x27;s all-time record goal scorer, netting 273 in his 12 years at the club; he also found the net in 8 consecutive matches in the 1924–25 season. The most goals managed in a single season for the club is 44 by Arthur Rowley, in the 1956–57 season. The fastest goal in the club&#x27;s history was scored by Matty Fryatt, when he netted after just nine seconds against Preston North End in April 2006.

Jamie Vardy broke the Premier League record by scoring in 11 consecutive Premier League games, scoring 13 in the process during the 2015–16 Premier League season. Vardy&#x27;s goal at Sunderland on 10 April 2016 saw him become the first Leicester player since Gary Lineker in 1984–85 to score 20 top flight goals for the club, having already become Leicester&#x27;s highest Premier League scorer in a single season, ultimately finishing with 23 and the Premier League Golden Boot for the season.

The record transfer fee paid by Leicester for a player was in the region of £32-to-40 million for midfielder Youri Tielemans from AS Monaco. The highest transfer fee received for a Leicester player was approximately £80 million from Manchester United for Harry Maguire; at the time of the transfer this was the eleventh-highest-ever fee, the highest-ever move between two English teams, and the highest-ever for a defender.

The club&#x27;s record home attendance is 47,298, for a fifth-round FA Cup match against Tottenham Hotspur at Filbert Street in 1928. The current record home attendance at the current stadium is 32,242, for a Premier League match against Sunderland on 8 August 2015. The highest-ever attendance for a non-competitive football match at King Power Stadium stands at 32,188, for a pre-season friendly against Real Madrid on 30 July 2011.

Leicester&#x27;s highest league finish is first in the Premier League in 2015–16. The club currently holds the all-time record for second tier titles with eight.

Leicester&#x27;s longest unbeaten run in the league was between 1 November 2008 and 7 March 2009, in which the team remained unbeaten for 23 games on their way to the League One title. The club&#x27;s longest run of consecutive victories in league football is currently nine, which the team achieved between 21 December 2013 and 1 February 2014 in the EFL Championship.

In the 2015–16 season, Leicester achieved many new club records in what &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described as &quot;one of the most astonishing league titles of all-time&quot;. They recorded the fewest losses in any of the club&#x27;s previous Premier League seasons, the fewest away defeats in any top-flight season, and the most consecutive wins in the top flight. Those consecutive victories came against Watford, Newcastle United, Crystal Palace, Southampton and Sunderland. Coincidentally, Leicester kept a record of five straight clean sheets against each of the same five opponents. The King Power Stadium&#x27;s home crowds in 2015–16 saw their team beaten just once in the Premier League all season.

Leicester made their UEFA Champions League debut in the 2016–17 season, their fourth appearance in European football. The club became the third English team to win on their Champions League debut, after Manchester United in 1994 and Newcastle United in 1997. They also became the first English team to win away on their Champions League debut, and win all three of their opening games in the competition. Leicester are currently the first and only team in Champions League history to keep clean sheets in each of their opening four games in the competition. In March 2017, the club became the 50th to reach the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals.

On 25 October 2019, the Leicester team set the record for the highest margin of away victory in English top-flight history, defeating Southampton 9–0 at St Mary&#x27;s Stadium. In doing so they also tied the record for the highest margin of victory in Premier League history, equalling Manchester United&#x27;s 9–0 home victory over Ipswich Town in 1995. As a result, Leicester City hold the all-time top tier records for the biggest defeat, biggest away win, and highest-scoring draw.

In the 2023–24 EFL Championship season, the club made its best start to a league season, and the best in the competition&#x27;s history (since being known as the Championship). During this period, the club also set a new record of six straight away wins, matched the all-time record of nine consecutive league wins home and away, and went four home matches without conceding for the first time since 1973.

==League history==

Since their election to the Football League in 1894, Leicester City have spent all but one season within the top two tiers of English football. During the 2008–09 season, they played in League One, the third tier of English football, after the club&#x27;s relegation from the Championship in the previous season. However, the club made an instant return to the second tier and were promoted as 2008–09 League One champions.

<text>Middlesbrough Football Club ( ) is a professional association football club based in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire. They compete in the EFL Championship, the second level of the English football league system. Nicknamed the Boro, they were formed in 1876 and are the 11th oldest football league club in England and Wales. The club have played at the Riverside Stadium since 1995, having previously played at Ayresome Park for 92 years, from 1903 to 1995.

Middlesbrough were one of the founding members of the Premier League in 1992, and have spent all but two seasons of their entire history as a professional club competing within the top two tiers of English football. Their highest league finish to date was third place in the top flight in the 1913–14 season. The outbreak of the First World War stunted their push for a first top division title, though the club pushed again during the inter-war years, finishing fourth in the 1938–39 season before the Second World War halted the English leagues and again prevented a push for a first title. The club came within minutes of folding in 1986 before they were saved by a consortium led by board member and later chairman Steve Gibson. A remarkable recovery saw the club immediately earn back to back promotions to the top division in the 1986-87 and 1987-88 seasons. The club were runners-up in the FA Cup and League Cup in 1997 while also being relegated following a controversial 3-point deduction, and losing another League Cup final the following season. Under Steve McClaren, the club won the League Cup in 2004, its first major silverware, and reached the 2006 UEFA Cup final. The club has played one Premier League season since relegation in 2009.

Middlesbrough is the only major professional football club in the greater Teesside area (the 14th biggest urban area in England), the Tees Valley, and the county of North Yorkshire (the largest county in England by area). The club has regional rivalries with the two closest major clubs, Newcastle United (the Tyne–Tees derby) and Sunderland (the Tees–Wear derby).

The club&#x27;s traditional kit is red with white detailing, often in the form of a white chest band. The home shorts and sock colours have interchangeably been shifted between red and white, complementing the red shirt that was adopted in 1899. The various crests throughout the club&#x27;s history, the most recent of which was adopted in 2007, incorporate a lion rampant.

==History==

===Formation and early years (1876–1914)===

Middlesbrough were formed in 1876, and won the FA Amateur Cup in 1895 and again in 1898. The club turned professional in 1889, but reverted to amateur status in 1892. They turned professional permanently in 1899. After three seasons, they won promotion to the First Division, where they would remain for the next .

In 1903, the club moved to Ayresome Park, their home for the next . In 1905, the club sanctioned the transfer of Alf Common for £1,000, a record fee. In the same year, Tim Williamson became the first Middlesbrough player to play international football.

Over these early years in the top flight, their form fluctuated greatly, rising to sixth in 1907–08 before dropping to 17th two seasons later. The club rose to their highest league finish to date, third, in 1913–14. The First World War soon intervened, and football was suspended.

===Ups and downs (1914–1966)===
Before league football resumed, Middlesbrough won the Northern Victory League, but the team were unable to maintain their previous form and finished the 1919–20 season in mid-table. They remained in the First Division for the next few seasons, but were relegated in 1923–24 after finishing bottom, 10 points adrift of their nearest rivals. Three seasons later, they won the Division Two title. During that season, debutant George Camsell, who had signed from Third Division North side Durham City the previous season, finished with a record 59 league goals, which included nine hat-tricks. He would continue as top scorer for each of the next 10 seasons. Middlesbrough&#x27;s tenure back in the top flight lasted only one season, and the club were relegated. They were promoted at the first attempt in 1928–29, winning another Second Division title. The club remained in the First Division until 1954.
The decade before the Second World War saw the emergence of Wilf Mannion and George Hardwick, both of whom would go on to become England internationals in the years ahead. Middlesbrough climbed to fourth in the last full season before the war, and were expected to challenge for the title the following season, but the war intervened. After the war, the club was unable to recover the form of the previous seasons before the war, hovering around mid-table and exiting in the early rounds of the FA Cup. Soon after the war, the team began to falter, and were relegated in 1953–54. This was the start of a 20-year spell outside the top division, but this was the spell too that saw the emergence of one of the club&#x27;s top goalscorers, Brian Clough, who scored 204 goals in 222 games, before he left for Sunderland. On 6 May 1950 they were represented by a Black player for the first time, Jamaican-born Lindy Delapenha making his debut in an away game against Fulham on that date. In total he went on to make 270 appearances, scoring 92 goals, before he left for Mansfield Town after the 1957/58 season. Over that period, Middlesbrough maintained reasonable progress in the Second Division, but were never serious contenders for promotion. After a fourth-place finish in 1962–63, the club endured a steady decline and were relegated to the Third Division for the first time in their history in 1966.

===Resurgence, &#x27;Charlton&#x27;s Champions&#x27;, and financial crisis (1966–1994)===
New manager Stan Anderson returned the club to the second flight at the first attempt. Middlesbrough would not finish below ninth during the next six seasons in the Second Division, finishing 4th (just outside the top three promotion winning places at the time) on three of those occasions.

In 1973, Jack Charlton took over as manager and guided the team back to the top flight. A team led on the pitch by Willie Maddren and Bobby Murdoch, and including a young Graeme Souness, ensured promotion as early as 23 March 1974, and with eight games of the season left, they became runaway champions, finishing with a league record 65 points (based on the 2 points for a win format). After a very promising start to their first campaign back in the first division Bob Paisley, manager of eventual runners up Liverpool, tipped Middlesbrough as favourites to win the league, however they ultimately fell short finishing seventh. Middlesbrough won their first silverware as a professional side in the 1975–76 season, lifting the Anglo-Scottish Cup in its inaugural season after a two-legged final win over Fulham.

In 1979, John Neal made the club&#x27;s first international signing, with Boško Janković arriving from Željezničar Sarajevo.

The club experienced severe financial difficulties during the mid-1980s. Middlesbrough were dropping down the table, and finished 19th in the 1984–85 season. In April 1986, the club had to borrow £30,000 from the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association (PFA) to pay wages. The final game of the season saw Middlesbrough relegated to the Third Division again. That summer, the club called in the Provisional Liquidator, and, shortly afterwards, the club was wound up and the gates to Ayresome Park were padlocked. Without the £350,000 capital required for Football League registration, a new rule, the club risked folding permanently. Steve Gibson, however, a member of the board at the time, brought together a consortium, and with 10 minutes to spare before the deadline they completed their registration with the Football League for the 1986–87 season. Following the registration came both a change of club crest and a change of the official company name to Middlesbrough Football and Athletic Club (1986) Ltd.

Over the next two seasons, Middlesbrough gained successive promotions into Division Two and then into Division One, the latter being the first and only time a second-tier side directly relegated a first tier side through the English Football League play-offs. The next season however, they came straight back down to Division Two, and with it came the then British transfer record move of Gary Pallister to Manchester United for £2.3 million. Following promotion again, Middlesbrough became one of the founding members of the FA Premier League when it was launched in the 1992–93 season.

===Bryan Robson years (1994–2001)===
Player-manager Bryan Robson, from Manchester United, took charge in 1994. Following promotion to the Premier League Middlesbrough made high-profile purchases like Brazilian international Juninho and previous season&#x27;s Champions League final goalscorer and Italian international Fabrizio Ravanelli. A difficult 1996–97 season, however, was compounded by a deduction of three points imposed just after Christmas as punishment for the club&#x27;s failure to fulfil a fixture against Blackburn Rovers, which ultimately resulted in relegation.&lt;ref name=&quot;PremierLeague96/97&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Without the points deduction imposed by the FA Premier League despite the club having taken advice from the Premier League themselves prior to calling off the match, the club would have had enough points to avoid the drop. At the same time, the club reached both the League and FA Cup finals for the first time, but lost both games. Despite being in the second tier, they were again runners-up in the League Cup final the next year.

Despite losing high-profile players Ravanelli and Juninho due to relegation, Middlesbrough were promoted back to the Premier League at the first attempt, in 1998. The following season saw them settle well and they had a 12-game unbeaten run midway through 1998–99, including a 3–2 win at Old Trafford in January during which they took a 3–0 lead; it was Manchester United&#x27;s only home defeat during their treble-winning season. Middlesbrough continued to stay secure in mid-table the following season, thanks mainly to the goals of Hamilton Ricard and the signings of prominent players such as Paul Ince and Christian Ziege. In 2000–01, they had a brief relegation scare that was solved with the arrival of Terry Venables as co-manager, and a 3–0 win away at Arsenal in April was the team&#x27;s best result. The trend of buying high profile European-based players continued with the acquisitions of Christian Karembeu and Alen Bokšić. Bryan Robson left the club before the start of 2001–02 season, having served as manager for seven years.

===Return to top flight and venture into Europe (2001–2009)===

After Venables decided not to take on the role of full time manager, in June 2001 Manchester United assistant coach Steve McClaren was appointed to replace Robson.

In his first season, McClaren led Middlesbrough to a respectable 12th place league finish and an FA Cup semi final, narrowly losing 1–0 to Arsenal. A slight improvement in the league saw the club finish 11th the following season. The 2003–04 season saw the club again finish 11th in the league, but much more significantly win a first major trophy by beating Bolton Wanderers 2–1 in the League Cup final. The League Cup win also ensured that Middlesbrough would qualify for Europe – the UEFA Cup – for the first time – the following season, where they reached the last 16 of the competition.
UEFA Cup qualification was achieved for the second consecutive year after a 1–1 away draw with Manchester City on the final game of the season. The match concluded with a dramatic last minute late penalty save by goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer which saw Middlesbrough finish above City in 7th place and qualify for Europe again.

Middlesbrough enjoyed one of its most successful cup campaigns to date in the 2005-2006 season. Domestically the club reached the League Cup quarter final and the FA Cup semi final, losing out to a late goal in a 1–0 loss to West Ham at Villa Park. The club also reached the 2006 UEFA Cup final following two miraculous last minute comebacks from 3–0 down on aggregate in the quarter and semi finals against FC Basel and Steaua Bucharest respectively, however ultimately fell short losing 4–0 to Sevilla in the final in Eindhoven. McClaren&#x27;s teams featured local youth players such as Stewart Downing, Adam Johnson and James Morrison as well as experienced international players such as forward trio Yakubu, Mark Viduka and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, and midfielder Gaizka Mendieta. Middlesbrough fielded the youngest starting 11 (average age 20) in the final Premier League game in the 2005–06 season, against Fulham. Nine players were teenagers – all English – and two more came on as substitutes.

Following the European Cup final loss, McClaren left to manage the England national team, and captain Gareth Southgate took over as manager. Despite not having the coaching qualifications, he was allowed by the Premier League board to continue after receiving special dispensation. Southgate led the club to a 12th-placed finish and an FA Cup quarter final in his first season as manager. In the subsequent 2007-2008 season, Middlesbrough again made the FA Cup quarter final, but despite being 2nd favourites to win the cup ahead of their quarter final home tie to Championship side Cardiff City, Middlesbrough lost the tie and eventually finished 13th in the league, beating Manchester City 8–1 on the final day.

In January 2008, the club broke its record transfer fee, paying £13.6 million for Brazilian international striker Afonso Alves. The club was relegated to the Championship at the end of the 2008–09 season in 19th place.

===Decline, brief revival and relegation (2009–2017)===
Middlesbrough sacked Gareth Southgate as manager in October 2009, when Southgate&#x27;s team were one point from leading the Championship, and replaced him with Gordon Strachan. At the time of Southgate&#x27;s dismissal, Boro were fourth in the Championship but their form under Strachan declined and they finished mid-table. On 18 October 2010, Strachan resigned and was later replaced by Tony Mowbray. Following a poor run of form at the start of the 2013–14 campaign, Mowbray left the club with immediate effect on 21 October.

Aitor Karanka, a former assistant coach at Real Madrid to José Mourinho, became the new Middlesbrough manager. He became the first non-British manager at the club, and led Boro to a 12th-place finish. In Karanka&#x27;s first full season in charge, Middlesbrough finished fourth and thus qualified for the 2015 Football League play-offs. After defeating Brentford 5–1 on aggregate in the semi-final, the club lost 2–0 to Norwich City at Wembley Stadium in the final. The following 2015/16 season ended in dramatic fashion. The final match of the ordinary season was a head to head between 2nd placed Boro and 3rd placed Brighton &amp; Hove Albion at The Riverside. Boro required 1 point from the match to finish above Brighton in second place and secure automatic promotion. After taking a first half lead, they were pegged back, but ultimately held on for the draw, securing promotion back to the Premier League.

Middlesbrough sacked Karanka in March 2017 following a poor run of form, and the team were relegated in 19th place, after just one season back in the top flight. The team won only 5 league games, and scored 27 goals, the lowest in the league.

===Return to the Championship (2017–present)===
The club appointed former Leeds United manager Garry Monk as manager in the off-season. Expectations at the club were high, having spent close to £50 million in the transfer window on player purchases, in order to mount an immediate promotion challenge back to the Premier League. Monk left in December, with Middlesbrough ninth in the Championship, and Tony Pulis was appointed as his replacement. Pulis led the side to finish 5th in the table, however, they lost in the play-off semi-finals to Aston Villa. In the following season, Pulis looked to secure the play-offs once again, but a poor finish to the season caused them to finish 7th and miss out on the play-offs by one point.

When Pulis&#x27;s contract was not extended, he was replaced by former Middlesbrough defender and first team coach, Jonathan Woodgate on 14 June 2019 on a three-year contract. Woodgate was sacked with the club only outside of the relegation zone on goal difference with eight games left of the 2019–20 season, and Neil Warnock was appointed as his replacement on the same day. Warnock ensured survival from relegation, securing safety on the final day of the season and a 17th-place finish. On 6 November 2021, Middlesbrough parted company with Warnock, who was replaced by Chris Wilder the following day. After 11 months in charge, Wilder was sacked with the club in 22nd position.

Former Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick was appointed as his successor and led Boro to a fourth-place finish, but lost in the play-off semi-finals against Coventry City. On 26 May 2023, the club officially became affiliated with the women&#x27;s team. In the 2023–24 season, Middlesbrough reached the semi-finals of the League Cup for the first time since 2004. Despite defeating Chelsea in the first leg, Middlesbrough would lose 6–2 on aggregate.

Unless promotion is secured in the 2024/25 season, Middlesbrough will suffer their longest consecutive spell outside of the top flight of English football for over 50 years, and the second longest in the clubs entire history (after the 20 years from 1955 to 1975)

==Colours and crest==

Middlesbrough&#x27;s original home kit upon election to the Football League in 1899 was a white home shirt with red shorts, and they did not adopt their colours of blue and white until later that season. Previous kits included a white shirt with a red and white polka dotted collar from around 1889. The Middlesbrough kit has remained broadly the same since 1899; a red shirt with white detailing, with shorts and socks of either red or white. The distinctive broad white stripe across the chest was introduced by Jack Charlton in 1973 (following an attempt to change the home shirt to a Leeds United-style white shirt), and brought back for a one-off in 1997–98, and, then again, for the 2000–01 and 2004–05 seasons due to popular demand. The club subsequently announced in December 2007 that the club would allow fans to decide via an online and text vote whether the white band should return for the following season. On 8 January 2008, the club announced that, with 77.4% of voters voting in its favour, the white band would return to the home kit, and that fans would choose the final shirt appearance from a selection of three designs, of which the winner was announced on 7 May 2008.

The Middlesbrough crest has gone through four changes since the formation of the club. Initially, the badge was simply the town of Middlesbrough&#x27;s crest with a red lion instead of a blue lion in order to fit in with the club&#x27;s colours. Following the adoption of the white band on the shirts in 1973, only the red lion remained with the letters &quot;M.F.C&quot; underneath in red. This was further adapted following the reformation of the club in 1986 to a circular crest with the lion in the middle and the words &quot;Middlesbrough Football Club 1986&quot; around the circle in order to reflect this new era. In 2007, Middlesbrough changed their crest again, this time with the lion inside a shield and the words &quot;Middlesbrough Football Club 1876&quot; underneath. The club&#x27;s chairman Steve Gibson stated that the intention was to reflect the club&#x27;s long history and not just their post-liquidation status.

===Kit information===

Middlesbrough&#x27;s first sponsor in 1980 was Datsun Cleveland on a two-year deal. Further two-year deals continued until Dickens was the sponsor for the 1994–95 season only. From 1995 to 2002, the club was sponsored by mobile phone service Cellnet, followed by two years with mobile retailer Dial-a-Phone. Online casino 888.com (2004–07) and satellite navigation company Garmin (2007–10) followed. In 2010–11, the club had several temporary sponsors including pawnbrokers Ramsdens, who then became permanent sponsors and signed a five-year deal in 2013. At its end, 32Red became the sponsors. Early in Ramsdens&#x27; sponsorship in March 2011, the company ceded its advertising space to Marie Curie Cancer Care for two games.

Italian manufacturers Erreà made Middlesbrough&#x27;s kits from 1994 to 2009, when the role was taken up by Adidas, who had previously made the kits from 1979 to 1983. Danish company Hummel, which had made the kits from 1984 to 1987 during the club&#x27;s winding up and rebirth, secured the contract again in 2018. Erreà returned in 2022.

==Stadiums==

After formation in 1876, and with the club still amateurs, Middlesbrough&#x27;s first two years of football were played at Albert Park in Middlesbrough. After seeing the damage being caused by players and supporters, the Park Committee ordered the club to find an alternate venue. The club moved to Breckon Hill, behind the former Middlesbrough College longlands site, after agreeing to rent the land from its owner. However, two years later in 1880, the owner increased the rent and the club decided to move. They moved into the Linthorpe Road ground in 1882, home at the time of Middlesbrough Cricket Club. The cricket club departed in 1893–94 to move to the Breckon Hill field, and Middlesbrough Football Club became sole users of the ground.

With the club&#x27;s growing size, and entry to the Football League, they had to move to a new ground in 1903, Ayresome Park. It was designed by Archibald Leitch and would be the club&#x27;s home for the next 92 years, having also been chosen as one of the stadia for the 1966 FIFA World Cup. Following the Taylor Report in 1990, the ground either needed modernising or the club needed a new stadium. The club decided on the latter, and moved out at the end of the 1994–95 season. Ayresome Park was used as a training ground during 1995–96, before it was demolished in 1997 and a housing estate built in its place. Since the 1990s, the club trains at a £7 million complex at Rockliffe Park, in Hurworth, on the outskirts of Darlington.

The Riverside Stadium, named by the supporters of the club after a vote, became the club&#x27;s home in 1995. It was the first stadium to be built in line with the Taylor Report&#x27;s recommendations on all-seater stadiums for clubs in the top two divisions of the English football league system. It was originally a 30,000-seater stadium, constructed at a cost of £16 million, before it was expanded in 1998 to a capacity of 35,100 for an extra £5 million.

Since then, several reorganisations of the Riverside Stadium have taken place. At the start of the 2013–14 season, away fans were moved from behind the goal in the South stand to the South East corner, while home fans were situated behind both goals to help create a better atmosphere inside the stadium. A giant TV screen was also installed at the back of the South-East corner, replacing the older style scoreboards attached to the North and South stand roofs. For the start of the 2016–17 season (and a return to the Premier League), the club had to improve the stadium&#x27;s broadcasting facilities and floodlighting in order to meet Premier League requirements. The club also took this opportunity to move the main camera gantry to the back of the East stand, so that it faced the main West stand. As of the 2017–18 season, the stadium capacity is 34,742.

==Supporters==
Middlesbrough&#x27;s average historic attendance is the 16th highest of all the clubs in England and Wales.

Traditionally, supporters come from Middlesbrough itself and towns in the immediate area. As of May 2001, Middlesbrough had one of the highest proportions in Britain of locally-born season ticket holders at 80%, and one of the highest proportions of female fans at 20%. A survey at the start of the 2007–08 season found Middlesbrough supporters were the seventh-loudest set of fans in the Premier League. Middlesbrough Official Supporters Club, which features its own team in the local football league, has links with supporters&#x27; clubs across the globe. The largest supporters&#x27; clubs include the Official Supporters&#x27; Club, the Middlesbrough Disabled Supporters&#x27; Association, Yarm Reds, Red Faction and Middlesbrough Supporters South.

For Middlesbrough supporters, their main rivals are Newcastle United (with whom they contest the Tyne–Tees derby), followed by Sunderland (with whom they contest the Tees–Wear derby), and also, according to a planetfootball.com&#x27;s 2004 survey, Leeds United.

The nickname &quot;Smoggies&quot; was first used as a derogatory term by opposing supporters; it relates to the industrial air pollution – smog – that used to hang over the town, but it was later used by Middlesbrough fans in a somewhat self-deprecating manner, before finally being adopted as a badge of pride by supporters of the club. An example of this can be seen on the banners carried to away games stating &quot;Smoggies on Tour&quot;. Middlesbrough fans received praise from UEFA Chief Executive Lars-Christer Olsson after their behaviour during the 2005–06 UEFA Cup campaign. He commented that: Middlesbrough fans also received praise from Cleveland Police for their behaviour in previous rounds, particularly in the light of aggravation prior to and during the match at Roma.

==Media relations==
Middlesbrough was the first football club in the world to launch its own TV channel – Boro TV. The first broadcasts were tied to the club&#x27;s first ever major cup final appearance in 1997, a full year ahead of Manchester United&#x27;s MUTV, which still claims to be the first in the world. The channel was the brainchild of then NTL marketing director, Peter Wilcock. The programme became synonymous with former Middlesbrough player Bernie Slaven and radio commentator Alastair Brownlee, who proved to be as popular on TV as they were on radio. Its programmes were not live initially but were pre-recorded and hosted by local radio/TV broadcaster &amp; Boro fan, Dave Roberts. In August 2001, Boro TV claimed another first when it became the first English football club to broadcast time-delayed full-match footage of their league games on its own channel. Boro TV ran through NTL cable television until July 2005. The club then began to show match highlights through a subscription-based scheme on its official website.

Middlesbrough&#x27;s official matchday programme, &quot;Redsquare&quot;, was &quot;Programme Monthly&#x27;s&quot; 2006–07 Programme of the Year. There are numerous other fanzines available, most notably &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot;, formed in September 1988 following Bruce Rioch&#x27;s quote to Tony Mowbray, stating &quot;If I had to go to the moon I&#x27;d want him by my side&quot;.

==Community==
Middlesbrough Football Club in the Community (MFCIC) was founded in 1996 by club chairman Steve Gibson and is one of the largest community-based football schemes in the United Kingdom. It is run separately from the football club, but receives support from both the club in terms of providing players, staff, stadium facilities and PR for articles in the matchday programme and other publications, as well as support from other local organisations. In 2012, MFCIC was relaunched as MFC Foundation. The Foundation aims to use the club&#x27;s profile to deliver sport, health, education and inclusion projects in vulnerable and disadvantaged communities across Teesside. Since 1996, the Foundation has delivered 20,000 qualifications, engaged over 500,000 people and invested £25 million in local communities to tackle inequality and disadvantage.

Since 2002, the club and MFCIC have also run the Middlesbrough Enterprise Academy, a scheme which helps local children improve their entrepreneurial skills and increase their awareness of business planning and finance. In March 2008, plans were announced by the Premier League to roll out the scheme nationally amongst all Premier League clubs.

It was announced in December 2007 that Middlesbrough football club had carried out more community work during 2006–07 than any other Premier League club, rising from second place the previous year, with the club making 318 appearances – almost twice the Premier League average of 162. They were in the top two for community appearances again in 2007–08, with 374 – a 17% increase on the previous season.

Middlesbrough&#x27;s mascot is Roary the Lion. The club runs Roary&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Charity Fund, which purchases items for local children&#x27;s charities.

In 2009, steel producer Corus Group announced the possibility that it would mothball its Teesside plant, with up to 4,000 employees and contractors facing redundancy, after a consortium of steel magnates walked away from a 10-year deal. Middlesbrough Football Club helped with the &quot;Save Our Steel&quot; campaign by hosting dozens of steel workers and their families as they marched around the ground, promoted the campaign via the stadium&#x27;s PA system, scoreboards and in matchday programmes, while players wore T-shirts during warm-ups promoting the campaign. Chairman Steve Gibson said:

<doc id="298604" wikidata="Q44987" url="?curid=298604" title="Doc Holliday">
<text>John Henry Holliday (August 14, 1851 – November 8, 1887), better known as Doc Holliday, was an American dentist, gambler, and gunfighter who was a close friend and associate of lawman Wyatt Earp. Holliday is best known for his role in the events surrounding and his participation in the gunfight at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona. He developed a reputation as having killed more than a dozen men in various altercations, but modern researchers have concluded that, contrary to popular myth-making, Holliday killed only one to three men. Holliday&#x27;s colorful life and character have been depicted in many books and portrayed by well-known actors in numerous movies and television series.

At age 20, Holliday earned a degree in dentistry from the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery. He set up practice in Griffin, Georgia, but he was soon diagnosed with tuberculosis, the same disease that had claimed his mother when he was 15 and his sister before his birth, having acquired it while tending to his mother&#x27;s needs. Hoping the climate in the American Southwest would ease his symptoms, he moved to that region and became a gambler, a reputable profession in Arizona in that day. Over the next few years, he reportedly had several confrontations. He saved Wyatt Earp&#x27;s life during a saloon confrontation in Texas, and they became friends. In 1879, he joined Earp in Las Vegas, New Mexico, and then rode with him to Prescott, Arizona, and then Tombstone. While in Tombstone, local members of the outlaw Cochise County Cowboys repeatedly threatened him and spread rumors that he had robbed a stagecoach. On October 26, 1881, Holliday was deputized by Tombstone city marshal Virgil Earp. The lawmen attempted to disarm five members of the Cowboys near the O.K. Corral on the west side of town, which resulted in the famous shootout.

Following the Tombstone shootout, Virgil Earp was maimed by hidden assailants while Morgan Earp was killed. Unable to obtain justice in the courts, Wyatt Earp took matters into his own hands. As the recently appointed deputy U.S. marshal, Earp formally deputized Holliday, among others. As a federal posse, they pursued the outlaw Cowboys they believed were responsible. They found Frank Stilwell lying in wait as Virgil boarded a train for California, and Wyatt Earp killed him. The local sheriff issued a warrant for the arrest of five members of the federal posse, including Holliday. The federal posse killed three other Cowboys during late March and early April 1882, before they rode to the New Mexico Territory. Wyatt Earp learned of an extradition request for Holliday and arranged for Colorado Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin to deny Holliday&#x27;s extradition. Holliday spent the few remaining years of his life in Colorado. He died of tuberculosis in his bed at the Hotel Glenwood at age 36.

== Early life and education ==

Holliday was born in Griffin, Georgia, to Henry Burroughs Holliday and Alice Jane (McKey) Holliday. He was of English and Scottish ancestry. His father served in the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War (as a major in the 27th Georgia Infantry). When the Mexican–American War ended, Henry brought home an adopted son named Francisco. Holliday was baptized at the First Presbyterian Church of Griffin in 1852. In 1864, his family moved to Valdosta, Georgia, where his father would be elected mayor and his mother would die of tuberculosis on September 16, 1866. The same disease killed his adopted brother. Three months after his wife&#x27;s death, his father married Rachel Martin.

Holliday attended the Valdosta Institute, where he received a classical education in rhetoric, grammar, mathematics, history, and languages—principally Latin, but some French and Ancient Greek.

In 1870, 19-year-old Holliday left home for Philadelphia. On March 1, 1872, at age 20, he received his Doctor of Dental Surgery degree from the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery (now part of the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine). Holliday graduated five months before his 21st birthday, so the school held his degree until he turned 21, the minimum age required to practice dentistry.

== Adulthood ==
===Career===

Holliday moved to St. Louis, Missouri, so he could work as an assistant for his classmate, A. Jameson Fuches, Jr. Less than four months later, at the end of July, he relocated to Atlanta, where he joined a dental practice. He lived with his uncle and his family so he could begin to build up his dental practice. A few weeks before Holliday&#x27;s birthday, dentist Arthur C. Ford advertised in the Atlanta papers that Holliday would substitute for him while Ford was attending dental meetings.

=== Fight in Georgia ===
There are disputed rumors that Holliday was involved in a shooting on the Withlacoochee River, Georgia, in 1873. The earliest mention is by Bat Masterson in a profile of Doc he wrote in 1907. According to that story, when Holliday was 22, he went with some friends to a swimming hole on his uncles&#x27; land, where they discovered it was occupied by a group of black U.S. Army soldiers who were in the area as part of the federal government&#x27;s occupying forces in the South.

Susan McKey Thomas, the daughter of Doc&#x27;s uncle Thomas S. McKey, said her father told her: &quot;They rode in on the Negroes in swimming in a part of the Withlacoochee River that &quot;Doc&quot; and his friends had cleared to be used as their swimming hole. The presence of the Negroes in their swimming hole enraged &quot;Doc,&quot; and he drew his pistol, shooting over their heads to scare them off.&quot; Papa said, &quot;He shot over their heads!&quot;

According to Masterson&#x27;s story, Holliday leveled a double-barreled shotgun at them, and when they exited the swimming hole, killed two of the youths. Some family members thought it best that Holliday leave the state, but other members of Holliday&#x27;s family dispute those accounts. Researcher and historian Gary Roberts searched for contemporary evidence of the event for many months without success. Allen Barra, an author who focuses on Wyatt Earp, also searched for evidence corroborating the incident and found no credibility in Masterson&#x27;s story.

=== Diagnosis of tuberculosis ===
Shortly after beginning his dental practice, Holliday was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He was given only a few months to live, but was told that a drier and warmer climate might slow the deterioration of his health. After Dr. Ford&#x27;s return in September, Holliday left for Dallas, Texas, the &quot;last big city before the uncivilized Western Frontier&quot;.

=== Move to Dallas ===
When he arrived in Dallas, Holliday partnered with a friend of his father&#x27;s, Dr. John A. Seegar. They won awards for their dental work at the Annual Fair of the North Texas Agricultural, Mechanical and Blood Stock Association at the Dallas County Fair. They received all three awards: &quot;Best set of teeth in gold&quot;, &quot;Best in vulcanized rubber&quot;, and &quot;Best set of artificial teeth and dental ware.&quot; Their office was located along Elm Street, between Market and Austin Streets. They dissolved the practice on March 2, 1874. Afterward, Holliday opened his own practice over the Dallas County Bank at the corner of Main and Lamar Streets.

With coughing spells at inopportune times from his tuberculosis, his dental practice slowly declined. Meanwhile, Holliday found he had some skill at gambling and he soon relied on it as his principal income source. On May 12, 1874, Holliday and 12 others were indicted in Dallas for illegal gambling. He was arrested in Dallas in January 1875 after trading gunfire with a saloon keeper, Charles Austin, but no one was injured and he was found not guilty. He moved his offices to Denison, Texas, but after being fined for gambling in Dallas, he left the state.

=== Heads farther west ===
Holliday headed to Denver, Colorado, following the stage routes and gambling at towns and army outposts along the way. During the summer of 1875, he settled in Denver under the alias &quot;Tom Mackey&quot; and found work as a faro dealer for John A. Babb&#x27;s Theatre Comique at 357 Blake Street. He got into an argument with Bud Ryan, a well-known and tough gambler. They drew knives and fought and Holliday left Ryan seriously wounded.

Holliday left when he learned about gold being discovered in Wyoming. On February 5, 1876, he arrived in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He found work as a dealer for Babb&#x27;s partner, Thomas Miller, who owned the Bella Union Saloon. In the autumn of 1876, Miller moved the Bella Union to Deadwood, South Dakota (site of the gold rush in the Dakota Territory), and Holliday went with him.

In 1877, Holliday returned to Cheyenne, then Denver, and eventually to Kansas, where he visited an aunt. When he left Kansas, he went to Breckenridge, Texas, where he gambled. On July 4, 1877, after a disagreement with gambler Henry Kahn, Holliday beat him repeatedly with his walking stick. Both men were arrested and fined, but Kahn was not finished. Later that same day, he shot and seriously wounded the unarmed Holliday. On July 7, the &quot;Dallas Weekly Herald&quot; incorrectly reported that Holliday had been killed. His cousin, George Henry Holliday, moved west to help him recover.

Once healed, Holliday relocated to Fort Griffin, Texas. While dealing cards at John Shanssey&#x27;s saloon, he met Mary Katharine &quot;Big Nose Kate&quot; Horony, a dance hall woman and occasional prostitute. &quot;Tough, stubborn, and fearless&quot;, she was educated, but chose to work as a prostitute because she liked her independence. She is the only woman with whom Holliday is known to have had a relationship.

== Befriends Wyatt Earp ==
In October 1877, outlaws led by &quot;Dirty&quot; Dave Rudabaugh robbed a Santa Fe Railroad construction camp in Kansas. Rudabaugh fled south into Texas. Wyatt Earp was given a temporary commission as deputy U.S. marshal. Earp left Dodge City, following Rudabaugh over to Fort Griffin, a frontier town on the Clear Fork of the Brazos River. Earp went to the Bee Hive Saloon, the largest in town and owned by John Shanssey, whom Earp had met in Wyoming when he was 21. Shanssey told Earp that Rudabaugh had passed through town earlier in the week, but he did not know where he was headed. Shanssey suggested Earp ask gambler Doc Holliday, who had played cards with Rudabaugh. Holliday told Earp that he thought Rudabaugh was headed back to Kansas. Earp sent a telegram to Ford County Sheriff Bat Masterson that Rudabaugh might be headed back in his direction.
After about a month in Fort Griffin, Earp returned to Fort Clark and in early 1878, he went to Dodge City, where he became the assistant city marshal, serving under Charlie Bassett. During the summer of 1878, Holliday and Horony also arrived in Dodge City, where they stayed at Deacon Cox&#x27;s boarding house as Dr. and Mrs. John H. Holliday. Holliday sought to practice dentistry again, and ran an advertisement in the local paper:

According to accounts of the following event, reported by Glenn Boyer in &quot;I Married Wyatt Earp&quot;, Earp had run two cowboys, Tobe Driscall and Ed Morrison, out of Wichita earlier in 1878. During the summer, the two cowboys—accompanied by another two dozen men—rode into Dodge and shot up the town while galloping down Front Street. They entered the Long Branch Saloon, vandalized the room, and harassed the customers. Hearing the commotion, Earp burst through the front door and before he could react, a large number of cowboys were pointing their guns at him. In another version, there were only three to five cowboys. In both stories, Holliday was playing cards in the back of the room and upon seeing the commotion, drew his weapon and put his pistol at Morrison&#x27;s head, forcing him and his men to disarm, rescuing Earp from a bad situation. No account of any such confrontation was reported by any of the Dodge City newspapers at the time. Whatever actually happened, Earp credited Holliday with saving his life that day, and the two men became friends.

== Other known confrontations ==

Holliday was still practicing dentistry from his room in Fort Griffin, Texas, and in Dodge City, Kansas. In an 1878 Dodge newspaper advertisement, he promised money back for less than complete customer satisfaction. However, this was the last known time that he worked as a dentist. He gained the nickname &quot;Doc&quot; during this period.

Holliday reportedly engaged in a gunfight with a bartender named Charles White. Miguel Otero, who would later become governor of New Mexico Territory, said he was present when Holliday walked into the saloon with a cocked revolver in his hand and challenged White to settle an outstanding argument. White was serving customers at the time and took cover behind a bar, then started shooting at Holliday with his revolver. During the fight, Holliday shot White in the scalp. However, there are no contemporaneous newspaper reports of the incident.

Bat Masterson reportedly said that Holliday was in Jacksboro, Texas, and got into a gunfight with an unnamed soldier whom Holliday shot and killed. Historian Gary L. Roberts found a record for a Private Robert Smith who had been shot and killed by an &quot;unknown assailant&quot; on March 3, 1876, but Holliday was never linked to the death.

== Move to New Mexico ==

Holliday developed a reputation for his skill with a gun, as well as with the cards. A few days before Christmas in 1878, Holliday and Horony arrived in Las Vegas, New Mexico. The 22 hot springs near the town were favored by individuals with tuberculosis for their alleged healing properties. Doc opened a dental practice and continued gambling as well, but the winter was unseasonably cold and business was slow. The New Mexico Territorial Legislature passed a bill banning gambling within the territory with surprising ease. On March 8, 1879, Holliday was indicted for &quot;keeping [a] gaming table&quot; and was fined $25. The ban on gambling combined with extremely low temperatures persuaded him to return to Dodge City for a few months.

In September 1879, Wyatt Earp resigned as assistant marshal in Dodge City. Accompanied by his common-law wife Mattie Blaylock, his brother Jim, and Jim&#x27;s wife Bessie, they left for Arizona Territory. Holliday and Horony returned to Las Vegas where they met again with the Earps. The group arrived in Prescott in November.

=== Royal Gorge War ===

In Dodge City, Holliday joined a team being formed by Deputy U.S. Marshal Bat Masterson. Masterson had been asked to prevent an outbreak of guerrilla warfare between the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&amp;RGW), which were vying to be the first to claim a right-of-way across the Royal Gorge, one of the few natural routes through the Rockies that crossed the Continental Divide. Both were striving to be the first to provide rail access to the boom town of Leadville, Colorado. Royal Gorge was a bottleneck along the Arkansas, too narrow for both railroads to pass through, and with no other reasonable access to the South Park area. Doc remained there for about two and a half months. The federal intervention prompted the so-called &quot;Treaty of Boston&quot; to end the fighting. The D&amp;RGW completed its line and leased it for use by the Santa Fe. Holliday took home a share of a $10,000 bribe paid by the D&amp;RGW to Masterson to give up their possession of the Santa Fe roundhouse and returned to Las Vegas where Horony had remained.

=== Builds saloon in Las Vegas ===

The Santa Fe Railroad built tracks to Las Vegas, New Mexico, but bypassed the city by about a mile. A new town was built up near the tracks and prostitution and gambling flourished there. On July 19, 1879, Holliday and John Joshua Webb, former lawman and gunman, were seated in a saloon. Former U.S. Army scout Mike Gordon tried to persuade one of the saloon girls, a former girlfriend, to leave town with him. She refused and Gordon left the building &quot;shouting obscenities&quot;, followed by Holliday. Gordon fired a shot at Holliday and subsequently &quot;Gordon died&quot; the day after. The next day, Holliday paid $372.50 to a carpenter to build a clapboard building to house the Doc Holliday&#x27;s Saloon with John Webb as his partner. While in town, he was fined twice for keeping a gambling device, and again for carrying a deadly weapon.

== Move to Arizona Territory ==

It appeared Holliday and Horony were settling into life in Las Vegas when Wyatt Earp arrived on October 18, 1879. He told Holliday he was headed for the silver boom going on in Tombstone, Arizona Territory. Holliday and Horony joined Wyatt and his wife Mattie, as well as Jim Earp and his wife and stepdaughter, and they left the next day for Prescott, Arizona Territory. They arrived within a few weeks and went straight to the home of Constable Virgil Earp and his wife Allie. Holliday and Horony checked into a hotel and when Wyatt, Virgil, and James Earp with their wives left for Tombstone, Holliday remained in Prescott, where he thought the gambling opportunities were better. Sometime in spring of 1880, Holliday and Kate Horony separate, with Horony leaving for Globe. Holliday left Prescott in the spring of 1880 to return to Las Vegas and resolve old legal and business matters. He was back by June of that year. Upon his return, Holliday lived in a boarding house, located at 100 N. Montezuma St., which was owned by temperance leader Richard Elliott. Arizona Secretary of State, and acting governor, John Gosper, also lived there. Although there is no indication Holliday practiced, in the June 1880 census he listed his profession as &#x27;dentist&#x27;. One of two known photographs of Holliday was taken in Prescott, by photographer D.F. Mitchell (the other photo is Holliday&#x27;s dental school graduation photo). 

Holliday finally joined the Earps in Tombstone in September 1880. Some accounts report that the Earps sent for Holliday for assistance with dealing with the outlaw Cowboys. Holliday quickly became embroiled in the local politics and violence that led up to the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in October 1881.

=== Accused in stagecoach robbery ===

Holliday and Horony had many fights. After a particularly nasty, drunken argument, Holliday kicked her out. County Sheriff Johnny Behan and Milt Joyce, both members of the Ten Percent Ring, saw an opportunity and exploited the situation. They plied Horony with more liquor and suggested to her a way to get even with Holliday. She signed an affidavit implicating Holliday in an attempted robbery and murder of passengers aboard a Kinnear and Company stage coach on March 15, 1881, carrying US$26,000 in silver bullion ().

Bob Paul, who had run for Pima County sheriff and was contesting the election he lost due to ballot stuffing, was working as the Wells Fargo shotgun messenger. He had taken the reins and driver&#x27;s seat in Contention City because the usual driver, a well-known and popular man named Eli &quot;Budd&quot; Philpot, was ill. Paul was riding in Philpot&#x27;s place as shotgun when three cowboys stopped the stage between Tombstone and Benson, Arizona, and tried to rob it.

Paul fired his shotgun and emptied his revolver at the robbers, wounding a cowboy, later identified as Bill Leonard, in the groin. Philpot and passenger Peter Roerig, riding in the rear dickey seat, were both shot and killed.
Holliday was a good friend of Leonard, a former watchmaker from New York. Based on the affidavit sworn by Horony, Judge Wells Spicer issued an arrest warrant for Holliday. Rumors flew that Holliday had taken part in the shooting and murders.

Later that day Holliday returned, drunk, to Joyce&#x27;s saloon. He insulted Joyce and demanded his firearm back. Joyce refused and threw him out, but Holliday came back carrying a revolver and started firing. Joyce pulled out a pistol and Holliday shot the revolver out of Joyce&#x27;s hand, putting a bullet through his palm. When Joyce&#x27;s bartender, Parker, tried to grab his gun, Holliday wounded him in the toe. Joyce picked up his pistol and pistol-whipped Holliday, knocking him out. Holliday later pleaded guilty to assault and was fined.

The Earps found witnesses who could attest to Holliday&#x27;s location elsewhere at the time of the stagecoach murders, and a sober Horony confessed that Behan and Joyce had influenced her to sign a document she did not understand. With the cowboy plot revealed, Spicer freed Holliday. The district attorney dismissed the charges, labeling them &quot;ridiculous&quot;. Holliday gave Horony some money and put her on a stage out of town.

=== Gunfight at the O.K. Corral ===
On October 26, 1881, Virgil Earp was both a deputy U.S. marshal and Tombstone&#x27;s city police chief. He received reports that cowboys with whom they had had repeated confrontations were armed in violation of the city ordinance that required them to deposit their weapons at a saloon or stable soon after arriving in town. The cowboys had repeatedly threatened the Earps and Holliday. Fearing trouble, Virgil temporarily deputized Holliday and sought backup from his brothers Wyatt and Morgan. Virgil retrieved a short coach gun from the Wells Fargo office and the four men went to find the cowboys.

On Fremont Street, they ran into Cochise County Sheriff Behan, who told them or implied that he had disarmed the cowboys. To avoid alarming citizens and lessen tension when disarming the cowboys, Virgil gave the coach gun to Holliday so he could conceal it under his long coat. Virgil Earp took Holliday&#x27;s walking stick. The lawmen found the cowboys in a narrow 15- to 20-ft-wide lot on Fremont Street, between Fly&#x27;s boarding house and the Harwood house. Holliday was boarding at Fly&#x27;s house and he possibly thought they were waiting there to kill him.

Different witnesses offered varying stories about Holliday&#x27;s actions. Cowboys&#x27; witnesses testified that Holliday first pulled out a nickel-plated pistol he was known to carry, while others reported he first fired a longer, bronze-colored gun, possibly the coach gun. Holliday killed Tom McLaury with a shotgun blast in the side of his chest. Holliday was grazed by a bullet possibly fired by Frank McLaury who was on Fremont Street at the time. He supposedly challenged Holliday, yelling, &quot;I&#x27;ve got you now!&quot; Holliday is reported to have replied, &quot;Blaze away! You&#x27;re a daisy if you have.&quot; McLaury died of shots to his stomach and behind his ear. Holliday may have also wounded Billy Clanton.

One analysis of the fight gives credit to either Holliday or Morgan Earp for firing the fatal shot at McLaury on Fremont Street. Holliday may have been on McLaury&#x27;s right and Morgan Earp on his left. McLaury was shot in the right side of the head, so Holliday is often given credit for shooting him. However, Wyatt Earp had shot McLaury in his torso earlier, a shot that alone could have killed him. McLaury would have turned away after having been hit and Wyatt could have placed a second shot in his head. A 30-day-long preliminary hearing found that the Earps and Holliday had acted within their duties as lawmen, although this did not pacify Ike Clanton.

=== Earp Vendetta Ride ===
The situation in Tombstone soon grew worse when Virgil Earp was ambushed and permanently injured in December 1881. Following that, Morgan Earp was ambushed and killed in March 1882. Several Cowboys were identified by witnesses as suspects in the shooting of Virgil Earp on December 27, 1881, and the assassination of Morgan Earp on March 19, 1882. Additional circumstantial evidence also pointed to their involvement. Wyatt Earp had been appointed deputy U.S. marshal after Virgil was maimed. He deputized Holliday, Warren Earp, Sherman McMaster, and &quot;Turkey Creek&quot; Jack Johnson.

After Morgan&#x27;s murder, Wyatt Earp and his deputies guarded Virgil Earp and Allie on their way to the train for Colton, California where his father lived, to recuperate from his serious shotgun wound. In Tucson, on March 20, 1882, the group spotted an armed Frank Stilwell and reportedly Ike Clanton hiding among the railroad cars, apparently lying in wait with the intent to kill Virgil. Frank Stilwell&#x27;s body was found at dawn alongside the railroad tracks, riddled with buckshot and gunshot wounds. Wyatt said later in life that he killed Stilwell with a shotgun.

Tucson Justice of the Peace Charles Meyer issued arrest warrants for five of the Earp party, including Holliday. On March 21, they returned briefly to Tombstone, where they were joined by Texas Jack Vermillion and possibly others. On the morning of March 22, a portion of the Earp posse including Wyatt, Warren, Holliday, Sherman McMaster, and &quot;Turkey Creek&quot; Johnson rode about east to Pete Spence&#x27;s ranch to a wood cutting camp located off the Chiricahua Road, below the South Pass of the Dragoon Mountains. According to Theodore Judah—who witnessed events at the wood camp—the Earp posse arrived around 11:00 a.m. and asked for Spence and Florentino &quot;Indian Charlie&quot; Cruz. They learned Spence was in jail and that Cruz was cutting wood nearby. They followed the direction Judah indicated and he soon heard a dozen or so shots. When Cruz did not return the next morning, Judah went looking for him and found his body full of bullet holes.

=== Gunfight at Iron Springs ===

Two days later, Earp&#x27;s posse traveled to Iron Springs, located in the Whetstone Mountains, where they expected to meet Charlie Smith, who was supposed to be bringing $1,000 cash from their supporters in Tombstone. With Wyatt and Holliday in the lead, the six lawmen surmounted a small rise overlooking the springs. They surprised eight cowboys camping near the springs. Wyatt Earp and Holliday left the only record of the fight. Curly Bill recognized Wyatt Earp in the lead and immediately grabbed his shotgun and fired at Earp. The other Cowboys also drew their weapons and began firing. Earp dismounted, shotgun in hand. &quot;Texas Jack&quot; Vermillion&#x27;s horse was shot and fell on him, pinning his leg and wedging his rifle underneath. Lacking cover, Holliday, Johnson, and McMaster retreated.

Earp returned Curly Bill&#x27;s gunfire with his own shotgun and shot him in the chest, nearly cutting him in half according to Earp&#x27;s later account. Curly Bill fell into the water by the edge of the spring and lay dead.

The Cowboys fired a number of shots at the Earp party, but the only casualty was Vermillion&#x27;s horse, which was killed. Firing his pistol, Wyatt shot Johnny Barnes in the chest and Milt Hicks in the arm. Vermillion tried to retrieve his rifle wedged in the scabbard under his fallen horse, exposing himself to the Cowboys&#x27; gunfire. Doc Holliday helped him gain cover. Wyatt had trouble re-mounting his horse because his cartridge belt had slipped down around his legs.

Wyatt&#x27;s long coat was shot through by bullets on both sides. Another bullet struck his boot heel and his saddle horn was hit as well, burning the saddle hide and narrowly missing Wyatt. He was finally able to get on his horse and retreat. McMaster was grazed by a bullet that cut through the straps of his field glasses.

=== Earp and Holliday part company ===

Holliday and four other members of the posse were still faced with warrants for Stilwell&#x27;s death. The group elected to leave the Arizona Territory for New Mexico Territory and then on to Colorado. Wyatt and Holliday, who had been fast friends, had a serious disagreement and parted ways in Albuquerque. According to a letter written by former New Mexico Territory Governor Miguel Otero, Wyatt and Holliday were eating at Fat Charlie&#x27;s The Retreat Restaurant in Albuquerque &quot;when Holliday said something about Earp becoming &#x27;a damn Jew-boy.&#x27; Earp became angry and left...&quot;

Earp was staying with a prominent businessman, Henry N. Jaffa, who was also president of New Albuquerque&#x27;s Board of Trade. Jaffa was Jewish, and based on Otero&#x27;s letter, Earp had, while staying in Jaffa&#x27;s home, honored Jewish tradition by touching the &quot;mezuzah&quot; upon entering his home. According to Otero&#x27;s letter, Jaffa told him, &quot;Earp&#x27;s woman was a Jewess.&quot; Earp&#x27;s anger at Holliday&#x27;s ethnic slur may indicate that the relationship between Josephine Marcus and Wyatt Earp was more serious at the time than is commonly known. Holliday and Dan Tipton arrived in Pueblo, Colorado, in late April 1882.

== Arrives in Colorado ==

On May 15, 1882, Holliday was arrested in Denver on the Tucson warrant for murdering Frank Stilwell. When Wyatt Earp learned of the charges, he feared his friend Holliday would not receive a fair trial in Arizona. Earp asked his friend Bat Masterson, then chief of police of Trinidad, Colorado, to help get Holliday released. Masterson drew up bunco charges against Holliday.

Holliday&#x27;s extradition hearing was set for May 30. Late in the evening of May 29, Masterson sought help getting an appointment with Colorado Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin. He contacted E.D. Cowen, capital reporter for the &quot;Denver Tribune&quot;, who held political sway in town. Cowen later wrote, &quot;He submitted proof of the criminal design upon Holliday&#x27;s life. Late as the hour was, I called on Pitkin.&quot; His legal reasoning was that the extradition papers for Holliday contained faulty legal language and that there was already a Colorado warrant out for Holliday—including the bunco charge that Masterson had fabricated. Pitkin was persuaded by the evidence presented by Masterson and refused to honor Arizona&#x27;s extradition request.

Masterson took Holliday to Pueblo, where he was released on bond two weeks after his arrest. Holliday and Wyatt met in June 1882 in Gunnison. And he was able to see his old friend Wyatt one last time in late winter of 1886, where they met in the lobby of the Windsor Hotel there. Sadie Marcus described the skeletal Holliday as having a continuous cough and standing on &quot;unsteady legs.&quot;

=== Death of Johnny Ringo ===

On July 14, 1882, Holliday&#x27;s long-time enemy Johnny Ringo was found dead in a low fork of a large tree in West Turkey Creek Valley near Chiricahua Peak, Arizona Territory. He had a bullet hole in his right temple and a revolver was found hanging from a finger of his hand. A coroner&#x27;s inquest officially ruled his death a suicide; but according to the book &quot;I Married Wyatt Earp&quot;, which author and collector Glenn Boyer claimed to have assembled from manuscripts written by Earp&#x27;s third wife, Josephine Marcus Earp, Earp and Holliday traveled to Arizona with some friends in early July, found Ringo in the valley, and killed him. Boyer refused to produce his source manuscripts, and reporters wrote that his explanations were conflicting and not credible. &quot;New York Times&quot; contributor Allen Barra wrote that the book &quot;is now recognized by Earp researchers as a hoax&quot;. A variant of the story, popularized in the movie &quot;Tombstone&quot;, holds that Holliday stepped in for Earp in response to a gunfight challenge from Ringo, and shot him.

Evidence is unclear as to Holliday&#x27;s exact whereabouts on the day of Ringo&#x27;s death. Records of the District Court of Pueblo County, Colorado, indicate that Holliday and his attorney appeared in court in Pueblo on July 11, and again on July 14 to answer charges of &quot;larceny&quot;; but a writ of capias was issued for him on the 11th, suggesting that he may not have been in court that day. The &quot;Pueblo Daily Chieftain&quot; reported that Holliday was seen in Salida, Colorado, on July 7, more than from where Ringo&#x27;s body was found, and then in Leadville on July 18. Holliday biographer Karen Holliday Tanner noted that there was still an outstanding murder warrant in Arizona for Holliday&#x27;s arrest, making it unlikely that he would choose to re-enter Arizona at that time.
=== Hired by James Kyner ===

Toward the end of the 1880s, railroad contractor James H. Kyner hired Doc Holliday to motivate the proprietors of dozens of gambling and saloon tents to leave the forty-one-mile stretch of railroad line that he and another contractor were constructing between Glenwood Springs and Aspen. Drunkenness of the workers boozing it up at the saloon tents was causing trouble and there were too many for Kyner to want to deal with the problem himself.

Kyner had heard that a gunman named Doc Holliday had been hired before by a group of men who wanted to drive off others who had staked claims to the same nearby coal deposit that they were claiming, which gave him the idea of hiring Holliday to make his troublemakers leave. Kyner was staying at the Glenwood Hotel and when Holliday was pointed out to him one day, he initiated a discussion about it. Without hesitation, Holliday told Kyner he could do it for $250.

Kyner was later told by several men that every saloon and gambling tent along that line had disappeared, except one that was in a draw a half mile from the line. He met Holliday the next evening and asked &quot;What luck?&quot;. Holliday replied &quot;Oh, they moved,&quot; and without another word Kyner paid him the $250.

=== Shooting of William J. &quot;Billy&quot; Allen ===

Holliday&#x27;s last known confrontation took place in Hyman&#x27;s saloon in Leadville, Colorado, in 1884. Down to his last dollar, he had pawned his jewelry, and then borrowed $5 () from William J. &quot;Billy&quot; Allen. Allen was a bartender and special officer at the Monarch Saloon (and a former policeman), which enabled Allen to carry a gun and make arrests within the Monarch saloon. When Allen repeatedly demanded he be re-paid by August 19 &quot;or else&quot;, Holliday could not comply and was afraid. Doc knew that Allen usually stopped by Hyman&#x27;s saloon when he was finished at the Monarch, so Doc planned to confront Allen at Hyman&#x27;s on August 19. On his way to Hyman&#x27;s, Doc bumped into Marshall Harvey Faucett and explained his situation. Faucett informed Doc that Allen couldn&#x27;t carry a weapon outside the Monarch. Faucett testified later that Doc replied, &quot;I&#x27;ll get a shotgun and shoot him on sight,&quot; showing his intent. Faucett then went to the Monarch to warn Allen, but Allen had already left for Hyman&#x27;s. Doc went on to Hyman&#x27;s where he stashed a gun near the door under the bar and waited for Allen to appear. As Allen left the Monarch, Cy Allen (one of the Monarch&#x27;s proprietors) &quot;warned him against hunting up Holliday just then. Billy Allen answered there would be no trouble and, with a careless air, walked out&quot; towards Hyman&#x27;s.

When Allen came through Hyman&#x27;s door, Doc reached under the bar, grabbed his gun, and shot at Allen; the first shot missed Allen and slammed into the door frame. &quot;Startled, Allen spun on his heel, intending to flee, but tripped over the threshold and pitched forward, landing on his hands and knees. The ex-policeman scrambled to get to his feet. Holliday leaned over the cigar case and, almost on top of the man who’d been the hunter only seconds earlier, fired again. This shot hit its mark. The bullet tore into Allen’s right arm from the rear about halfway between the shoulder and the elbow and passed clear through, severing an artery in its flight. Jolted upright, Allen stumbled outside. He staggered against the wall of Dave May’s clothing store next door. By now he was in shock and bleeding freely, and he fainted into the arms of an onlooker.&quot; Allen’s main artery was sewn up by Dr. F. F. D&#x27;Avignon and he survived, although his arm was always “funny” afterward.

Doc Holliday was arrested and put on trial. During the trial, &quot;the preponderance of testimony at Holliday’s hearing went to show that Allen was not armed (no gun was ever found), but by then the overriding Western credo of &#x27;no duty to retreat&#x27; had won the day with public sentiment. &#x27;No duty to retreat&#x27; was a belief, enacted in the laws of several states, that a man who was without blame for provoking a confrontation was not obliged to flee from his assailant but was free to stand his ground regardless of the consequences.&quot; He claimed self-defense, noting that Allen outweighed him by and he feared for his life. On March 28, 1885, the jury acquitted Holliday.
Holliday spent his remaining days in Colorado. After a stay in Leadville, he suffered from the high altitude. He increasingly depended on alcohol and laudanum to ease the symptoms of tuberculosis, and his health and his skills as a gambler began to deteriorate.

== Final days and death ==
In 1887, prematurely gray and badly ailing, Holliday made his way to the Hotel Glenwood, near the hot springs of Glenwood Springs, Colorado. He hoped to take advantage of the reputed curative power of the waters, but the sulfurous fumes from the spring might have done his lungs more harm than good. As he lay dying, Holliday is reported to have asked the nurse attending him for a shot of whiskey. When she told him no, he looked at his bootless feet, amused. The nurses said that his last words were, &quot;This is funny.&quot; He always figured he would be killed someday with his boots on. Holliday died at 10 a.m. on November 8, 1887. He was 36. Wyatt Earp did not learn of Holliday&#x27;s death until two months afterward. Kate Horony later said that she attended to him in his final days, and one contemporary source appears to corroborate her claim. He died from tuberculosis.

=== Memorial service ===

The &quot;Glenwood Springs Ute Chief&quot; of November 12, 1887, wrote in its obituary that Holliday had been baptized in the Catholic Church. This was based on correspondence written between Holliday and his cousin, Sister Mary Melanie, a Catholic nun. No baptismal record has been found in either St. Stephen&#x27;s Catholic Church in Glenwood Springs or at the Annunciation Catholic Church in nearby Leadville. 

Holliday&#x27;s mother had been raised a Methodist and later joined a Presbyterian church (her husband&#x27;s faith), but objected to the Presbyterian doctrine of predestination and re-converted to Methodism publicly before she died, saying that she wanted her son John to know what she believed. Holliday himself was later to say that he had joined a Methodist church in Dallas. At the end of his life, Holliday had struck up friendships with both a Catholic priest, Father E.T. Downey, and a Presbyterian minister, Rev. W.S. Randolph, in Glenwood Springs. When he died, Father Downey was out of town, and so Rev. Randolph presided over the burial at 4 p.m. on the same day that Holliday died. The services were reportedly attended by &quot;many friends&quot;.

=== Burial ===

Holliday is buried in Linwood Cemetery overlooking Glenwood Springs. Since Holliday died in November, the ground might have been frozen. Some modern authors such as Bob Boze Bell speculate that it would have been impossible to transport him to the cemetery, which was only accessible by a difficult mountain road, or to dig a grave because the ground was frozen. Author Gary Roberts located evidence that other bodies were transported to the Linwood Cemetery at the same time of the month that year. Contemporary newspaper reports explicitly state that Holliday was buried in the Linwood Cemetery, but the exact location of his grave is uncertain. Though there is no official evidence of this, some claim that Holliday&#x27;s father, Major Henry Holliday, a man of means and influence, had his son exhumed and re-buried in Griffin&#x27;s Oak Hill Cemetery.

== Public reputation ==

Holliday maintained a fierce persona, as was sometimes needed for a gambler to earn respect. He had a contemporary reputation as a skilled gunfighter which modern historians generally regard as accurate. Tombstone resident George W. Parsons wrote that Holliday confronted Johnny Ringo in January 1882, telling him, &quot;All I want of you is ten paces out in the street.&quot; Ringo and he were prevented from a gunfight by the Tombstone police, who arrested both. During the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Holliday initially carried a shotgun and shot at and may have killed Tom McLaury. Holliday was grazed by a bullet fired by Frank McLaury and shot back. After Virgil was maimed in a January ambush, Holliday was part of a federal posse led by Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp who guarded him on his way to the railroad in Tucson. There they found Frank Stilwell apparently waiting for the Earps in the rail yard. A warrant for Holliday&#x27;s arrest was issued after Stilwell was found dead with multiple gunshot wounds. Holliday was part of Earp&#x27;s federal posse when they killed three other outlaw Cowboys during the Earp Vendetta Ride. Holliday reported that he had been arrested 17 times, four attempts had been made to hang him, and that he survived ambush five times.

=== Character ===
Throughout his lifetime, Holliday was known by many of his peers as a tempered, calm, Southern gentleman. In an 1896 article, Wyatt Earp said: &quot;I found him a loyal friend and good company. He was a dentist whom necessity had made a gambler; a gentleman whom disease had made a vagabond; a philosopher whom life had made a caustic wit; a long, lean blonde fellow nearly dead with consumption and at the same time the most skillful gambler and nerviest, speediest, deadliest man with a six-gun I ever knew.&quot;

In a newspaper interview, Holliday was once asked if his conscience ever troubled him. He is reported to have said, &quot;I coughed that up with my lungs, years ago.&quot;

Bat Masterson had several contacts with Holliday over his lifetime and the two men developed a dislike for each other. They tolerated each other only as friends of Wyatt Earp. Masterson wrote in an article about Holliday, 

Masterson wrote that Holliday was quick to go for his gun when threatened.

=== Stabbings and shootings ===

Much of Holliday&#x27;s violent reputation was nothing but rumors and self-promotion. However, he showed great skill in gambling and gunfights. His tuberculosis did not hamper his ability as a gambler and as a marksman. Holliday was ambidextrous.

No contemporaneous newspaper accounts or legal records offer proof of the many unnamed men whom Holliday is credited with killing in popular folklore. The only men he is known to have killed are Mike Gordon in 1879; probably Frank McLaury and Tom McLaury in Tombstone; possibly Frank Stilwell in Tucson; and William Allen in Colorado. Some scholars argue that Holliday may have encouraged the stories about his reputation, although there is no evidence he did.

In a March 1882 interview with the &quot;Arizona Daily Star&quot;, Virgil Earp told the reporter:

=== Arrests and convictions ===

Biographer Karen Holliday Tanner found that Holliday had been arrested 17 times before his 1881 shootout in Tombstone. Only one arrest was for murder, which occurred in an 1879 shootout with Mike Gordon in New Mexico, for which he was acquitted. In the preliminary hearing following the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Judge Wells Spicer exonerated Holliday&#x27;s actions as those of a duly appointed lawman. In Denver, the Arizona warrant against Holliday for Frank Stilwell&#x27;s murder went unserved when the governor was persuaded by Trinidad Chief of Police Bat Masterson to release Holliday to his custody for bunco charges.

Among his other arrests, Holliday pleaded guilty to two gambling charges, one charge of carrying a deadly weapon in the city (in connection with the argument with Ringo), and one misdemeanor assault and battery charge (for his shooting of Joyce and Parker). The others were all dismissed or returned as &quot;not guilty.&quot;

=== Alleged murder of Ed Bailey ===

Wyatt Earp recounted one event during which Holliday killed a fellow gambler named Ed Bailey. Earp and his common-law wife Mattie Blaylock were in Fort Griffin, Texas, during the winter of 1878, looking for gambling opportunities. Earp visited the saloon of his old friend from Cheyenne, John Shannsey, and met Holliday at the Cattle Exchange. The story of Holliday killing Bailey first appeared nine years after Holliday&#x27;s death in an 1896 interview with Wyatt Earp that was published in the &quot;San Francisco Enquirer&quot;. 

According to Earp, Holliday was playing poker with a well-liked local man named Ed Bailey. Holliday caught Bailey &quot;monkeying with the dead wood&quot; or the discard pile, which was against the rules. According to Earp, Holliday reminded Bailey to &quot;play poker&quot;, which was a polite way to caution him to stop cheating. When Bailey made the same move again, Holliday took the pot without showing his hand, which was his right under the rules. Bailey immediately went for his pistol, but Holliday whipped out a knife from his breast pocket and &quot;caught Bailey just below the brisket&quot; or upper chest. Bailey died and Holliday, new to town, was detained in his room at the Planter&#x27;s Hotel.

In Stuart Lake&#x27;s best-selling biography, &quot;Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal&quot; (1931), Earp added to the story. He is quoted as saying that Holliday&#x27;s girlfriend, &quot;Big Nose Kate&quot; Horony, devised a diversion. She procured a second pistol from a friend in town, removed a horse from its shed behind the hotel, and then set fire to the shed. Everyone but Holliday and the lawmen guarding him ran to put out the fire, while she calmly walked in and tossed Holliday the second pistol. 

However, no contemporary records have been found of either Bailey&#x27;s death or of the shed fire. In addition, Horony denied that Holliday killed &quot;a man named Bailey over a poker game, nor was he arrested and locked up in another hotel room.&quot; She laughed at the idea of &quot;a 116-pound woman, standing off a deputy, ordering him to throw up his hands, disarming him, rescuing her lover, and hustling him to the waiting ponies.&quot;

Author and Earp expert Ben Traywick doubts that Holliday killed Bailey. He found no contemporary newspaper articles or court records to support the story. He found evidence to support that Holliday was being held in his hotel room under guard, but for &quot;illegal gambling&quot;, and that the story of Horony starting a fire as a diversion to free him was true. The story about Bailey as told in &quot;San Francisco Enquirer&quot; interview of Earp was likely fabricated by the writer. Years later, Earp wrote:

== Photos of Holliday ==

Three photos of unknown provenance are often reported to be of Holliday, some of them supposedly taken by C.S. Fly in Tombstone, but sometimes reported to have been taken in Dallas. Holliday lived in a rooming house in front of Fly&#x27;s photography studio. Many persons share similar facial features, and the faces of people who look radically different can look similar when viewed from certain angles. Because of this, most museum staff, knowledgeable researchers, and collectors require provenance or a documented history for an image to support physical similarities that might exist. Experts rarely offer even a tentative identification of new or unique images of famous people based solely on similarities shared with other known images.
== Legacy ==
Doc Holliday is one of the most recognizable figures in the American Old West, but he is most remembered for his friendship with Wyatt Earp and his role in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Holliday&#x27;s friendship with the lawman has been a staple of popular sidekicks in American Western culture, and Holliday himself became a stereotypical image of a deputy and a loyal companion in modern times. He is typically portrayed in films as being loyal to his friend Wyatt, whom he sticks with during the duo&#x27;s greatest conflicts, such as the Gunfight at the OK Corral and Earp&#x27;s vendetta, even with the ensuing violence and hardships that they both endured. Together with Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday has become a modern symbol of loyalty, brotherhood and friendship.

The home of Doc Holliday’s uncle is marked with a historical marker located in Fayetteville, Georgia.

A life-sized statue of Holliday and Earp by sculptor Dan Bates was dedicated by the Southern Arizona Transportation Museum at the restored Historic Railroad Depot in Tucson, Arizona, on March 20, 2005, the 122nd anniversary of the killing of Frank Stilwell by Wyatt Earp. The statue stands at the approximate site of the shooting on the train platform.

&quot;Doc Holliday Days&quot; are held yearly in Holliday&#x27;s birthplace of Griffin, Georgia. Valdosta, Georgia, held a Doc Holliday look-alike contest in January 2010, to coincide with its sesquicentennial celebration.

Tombstone, Arizona, also holds an annual Doc Holli-Days, which started in 2017 and celebrates the gunfighter-dentist on the 2nd weekend of August each year. Events include gunfights, a parade, and a Doc Holliday look-alike contest. Val Kilmer, who played Doc in 1993&#x27;s &quot;Tombstone&quot;, was the grand marshal in 2017 and Dennis Quaid, who played Doc in 1994&#x27;s &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;, was the grand marshal in 2018.

== In popular culture ==
Holliday was nationally known during his life as a gambler and gunman. The shootout at the O.K. Corral is one of the most famous frontier stories in the American West and numerous Western TV shows and movies have been made about it. Holliday is usually a prominent part of the story.

<text>King&#x27;s Highway 407, commonly referred to as Highway 407 and colloquially as the &quot;four-oh-seven&quot;, is a tolled 400-series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. Comprising a privately leased segment and a publicly owned segment, the route spans the entire Greater Toronto Area (GTA) around the city of Toronto, travelling through the suburbs of Burlington, Oakville, Mississauga, Brampton, Vaughan, Markham, Pickering, Whitby, and Oshawa before ending in Clarington, north of Orono. At 151.4 km long, it is the fourth-longest expressway in Ontario&#x27;s 400-series network, after Highways 417, 400, and 401. The segment between Burlington and Brougham in Pickering is leased to and operated by the 407 ETR Concession Company Limited and is officially known as the 407 Express Toll Route (407 ETR). It begins at the junction of the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) and Highway 403 in Burlington and travels across the GTA to Brock Road in Pickering. East of Brock Road, the tollway continues east as Highway 407 (referred to as Highway 407 East during development to distinguish it from 407 ETR), a toll route operated by the provincial government, for , to Highway 35/115 in Clarington. The route interchanges with nine freeways: the QEW, Highway 403, Highway 401, Highway 410, Highway 427, Highway 400, Highway 404, Highway 412, and Highway 418. Highway 407 is an electronically operated toll highway; there are no toll booths along the route. Distances are calculated automatically using transponders or automatic number-plate recognition, which are scanned at entrance and exit portals.

Highway 407 was planned in the late 1950s as a freeway bypassing the Toronto segment of Highway 401, the busiest highway in North America. However, construction did not begin until 1987. During the early 1990s, the provincial government proposed tolling the highway to alleviate a revenue shortfall. The central sections of Highway 407 opened in 1997, and the remaining sections were built quickly over the following four years, with the final segment opening in mid-2001. Despite being included in the 400-series network, the Highway 407 ETR section is not considered part of the provincial highway network as it is now privately operated. The segment is operated privately under a 99-year lease agreement signed with the Conservative provincial government, which was sold in 1999 for about C$3.1 billion to a consortium of Canadian and Spanish investors operating under the name 407 International Inc. The privatization of the Highway 407 ETR section has been the source of significant criticism, especially regarding increases in tolls, plate denial, and false charges. In addition, the safety of segments built after the sale of the freeway has been called into question.

Phase 1 of a provincially owned and tolled extension of the route, known solely as Highway 407 (not Highway 407 ETR), opened to traffic from Brock Road in Pickering to Harmony Road in Oshawa on June 20, 2016. Included as part of this extension was the construction of a tolled north–south link between Highways 401 and 407, known as Highway 412. Phase 2 later extended the provincially owned portion of Highway 407 to Highway 35 / Highway 115 in Clarington. This construction was completed in two stages, with Phase 2A opening on January 2, 2018, as a extension to Taunton Road, and Phase 2B opening on December 9, 2019, as a extension to Highway 35 and Highway 115. Included as part of this extension was the construction of another tolled north–south link between Highways 401 and 407, known as Highway 418.

Unusually, the highway does not reach or pass through any of its three control cities: Hamilton, Toronto, or Peterborough. Hamilton is accessed by following either the QEW or Highway 403 beyond its western terminus in Burlington. Toronto proper is bypassed but is used as a control city due to the similar sizes of the suburban municipalities the highway passes through in York and Peel Regions, and control cities are not shown at street entrances in these regions, as is the case for freeways passing through Toronto. In the east, Peterborough is reached by briefly following the Highway 35/Highway 115 concurrency north and then continuing northeast on Highway 115 alone.

== Route description ==
Highway 407 is a controlled-access highway that encircles the GTA, passing through Burlington, Oakville, Mississauga, Brampton, Vaughan, Markham, Pickering, Whitby, Oshawa, and Clarington, as well as travelling immediately north of Toronto. Although the general public felt that tolling made the highway a luxury rather than fulfilling its original purpose of relieving traffic on Highway 401, Highway 407 ETR had average daily trip counts of over 350,000 vehicles in June 2014. The 407 ETR is contractually responsible for maintaining high traffic levels as justification for increasing tolls, but conducts its own traffic studies. Despite increased usage, parallel roads that Highway 407 was intended to supplement continue to grow congested, forcing the MTO to revisit costly widening projects of Highway 401 and the QEW.

Highway 407 was designed with aesthetics and environmental concerns in mind, featuring landscaped embankments, 79 storm drainage ponds, and a curb and gutter system. Unlike most Ontario highways, it features concrete pavement as opposed to top-coated asphalt. Because of this, the high-mast lighting along the urban portions of the route features fewer luminaires than asphalt-surfaced freeways.

=== Burlington–Vaughan ===
Highway 407 begins in Burlington within Halton Region at the Freeman Interchange between Highway 403 and the QEW, from which it branches off northward. The six-lane route passes under Brant Street, Upper Middle Road, and Guelph Line (Halton Regional Road 1) before it interchanges with Dundas Street (Halton Regional Road 5, formerly Highway 5). It briefly enters green space as it curves gently to the northeast, avoiding the nearby Niagara Escarpment. The route is crossed by Walkers Line, east of which residential subdivisions line the south side and green space lines the north. At an interchange with Appleby Line (Halton Regional Road 20), the highway straightens and travels parallel to Dundas Street before passing over Bronte Creek and under the Canadian National Railway&#x27;s (CN) Halwest Subdivision.
East of Bronte Creek, Highway 407 enters an agricultural area, interspersed with woodlots. It enters Oakville at the Tremaine Road (Halton Regional Road 22) overpass, then gradually swerves to the north as it encounters an interchange with Bronte Road (Halton Regional Road 25, formerly Highway 25). The route crosses Sixteen Mile Creek just north of Glenarchy Conservation Area, then travels parallel to the creek for several kilometres. It swerves north after an interchange with Neyagawa Boulevard, near the hamlet of Glenarchy. After diverging from the creek, it curves northeast, parallel to and north of Burnhamthorpe Road, where it interchanges with Trafalgar Road (Halton Regional Road 3). Highway 407 then encounters Highway 403, where it curves sharply to the northwest, while Highway 403 curves from the southeast to the northeast; resulting in both highways meeting and deflecting at a 90° angle and not crossing each other.

Now travelling parallel to and immediately west of the Halton–Peel regional boundary and Oakville–Mississauga city limits, the six-lane Highway 407 progresses northwest alongside a power transmission corridor, with residential areas to the east and farmland to the west. The route continues as such northwest to Highway 401, passing under Lower Base Line and Eglinton Avenue and interchanging at Britannia Road and Derry Road before crossing the Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s (CP) Galt Subdivision. At Highway 401, the route makes a sharp curve to the northeast, while interconnecting ramps weave across both freeways over several kilometres. It enters Peel Region at the Winston Churchill Boulevard (Peel Regional Road 19) overpass and follows another power transmission corridor just north of the Brampton–Mississauga boundary.
Highway 407 swerves east and encounters an interchange with Mississauga Road (Peel Regional Road 1) just prior to crossing the Credit River and the Orangeville Brampton Railway, after which it enters the urban GTA. After passing interchanges with Mavis Road (Peel Regional Road 18) and Hurontario Street (formerly Highway 10), the route encounters Highway 410 at another sprawling interchange located over Etobicoke Creek. Over the next , the route nudges northward into Brampton, interchanging with Dixie Road (Peel Regional Road 4) and Bramalea Road and meeting another CN railway line, before crossing Steeles Avenue (Peel Regional Road 15). Highway 407 curves back to the northeast as it interchanges with Airport Road (Peel Regional Road 7) and passes beneath another CN line, before encountering the final interchange in Peel Region at Goreway Drive. It crosses the West Humber River and former Highway 50 in Claireville Conservation Area before curving east into Vaughan, in York Region.

=== Vaughan–Pickering ===

Immediately after crossing into Vaughan, Highway 407 encounters the first of three large interchanges with other 400-series highways in York Region. The Highway 427 interchange is a four-level partial stack located just north of Steeles Avenue in Vaughan and adjacent to the 407 ETR Concession Company offices. The interchange features weaved ramps which connect to former Highway 27, located just to the east. The route continues eastward, parallel to and between Steeles Avenue and Highway 7. It dives through the Humber River valley alongside a CN line and along the northern border of Thackeray Conservation Lands, passing beneath a CP line. After an interchange with Pine Valley Drive (York Regional Road 57), the route becomes sandwiched between the industrial lands of the Pine Valley Business Park and the Emery Creek Corporate Park. A partial interchange with Weston Road (York Regional Road 56) lies just west of the large four-level stack interchange with Highway 400, the only of its kind in Canada. An interchange with Jane Street (York Regional Road 55) is interwoven into the east side of the Highway 400 interchange, below which pass the tunnels of the Line 1 Yonge–University subway, with the Highway 407 station (with its large commuter parking lot and GO Transit bus terminal serving the highway corridor) located to the south.
Still travelling alongside a power transmission corridor, Highway 407 crosses a complex rail wye which provides access to the CN freight yards to the north. After interchanging with Keele Street (York Regional Road 6), the route gently curves northward, passing under the CN Newmarket Subdivision, which carries the GO Transit Barrie Line and crossing the Don River. It curves back eastward as it interchanges with Dufferin Street (York Regional Road 53), travelling adjacent to and south of Highway 7. After interchanges with Bathurst Street (York Regional Road 38) and Yonge Street (York Regional Road 1), Highway 407 crosses the CN Bala Subdivision, which carries the GO Transit Richmond Hill Line. After an interchange with Bayview Avenue (York Regional Road 34), the highway swerves south and enters Markham. A partial interchange with Leslie Street (York Regional Road 12) precedes the third and final large freeway–freeway junction at Highway 404.

East of Highway 404, the freeway travels generally parallel to the Rouge River. It interchanges with Woodbine Avenue (York Regional Road 8) and Warden Avenue (York Regional Road 65), east of which the route travels alongside a CN line and crosses the GO Transit Unionville Line. Highway 407 continues straight eastward into a residential area, interchanging with Kennedy Road (York Regional Road 3), McCowan Road (York Regional Road 67), and Markham Road (York Regional Road 68), where it crosses the river and diverges from both the CN line and power transmission corridor. The route interchanges with Ninth Line (York Regional Road 69) and Donald Cousens Parkway (York Regional Road 48) before exiting the urban GTA and curving northeast over a CP line and into Rouge Park.
Until the opening of the first phase of 407E in June 2016, the final interchange along Highway 407 was with York–Durham Line (York/Durham Regional Road 30), the boundary between York Region and Durham Region as well as Markham and Pickering.

The route curves eastward, then crosses West Duffins Creek north of the community of Whitevale, south of the future Pickering Airport and the planned community of Seaton. Sandwiched between farm fields, the highway is crossed by North Road, before interchanging with Whites Road (formerly Sideline 26), an interchange which opened in February 2021.
Highway 407 ended just south of Brougham at a signalized intersection with Brock Road (Durham Regional Road 1) until the end of 2015, where it continued eastward as Highway 7. A new interchange has been built in conjunction with the provincially maintained and tolled extension, Highway 407E, which was constructed east of this point, and ties in with the current freeway, eliminating the at-grade intersection.

=== Pickering–Clarington ===

Immediately east of Brock Road, drivers enter the provincially operated portion of the highway. Right before Brock Road, the freeway turns northeast. After interchanging with Brock Road, the freeway is crossed by Highway 7 and Sideline 14 before it slowly eases due east. The freeway is flanked by farmland is then crossed by Westney Road, Salem Road, where there is a maintenance depot, and Kinsale Road, before interchanging with Lake Ridge Road, which forms the border between Pickering and Whitby. Immediately east of Lake Ridge Road, the freeway meets with Highway 412 at a large Y-interchange.

Highway 407 then curves southeast to bypass the town of Brooklin. It is crossed by Highway 7 once again before interchanging with Highway 12/Baldwin Street and Thickson Road. The freeway becomes parallel with a hydro line briefly. The freeway once again curves northeast, crossing the Whitby/Oshawa border, passing over Thornton Road and Winchester Road before interchanging with Simcoe Street and Harmony Road. The freeway then curves sharply southeast, crossing under the hydro lines it was just parallel to, crossing Winchester Street for the last time, and crossing the Oshawa/Clarington border. The freeway then is crossed by Langmaid Road and Concession Road 6 before turning due east and interchanging with Enfield Road. The freeway passes south of the hamlet of Solina before meeting Highway 418 at another large Y-interchange.

Highway 407 then jogs north of the hamlet of Hampton before interchanging with Bowmanville Avenue. The freeway is crossed by Middle Road, Liberty Street, and Bethesda Road before it turns slightly northeast. The freeway interchanges with Darlington-Clarke Townline with a B4 Parclo interchange, which is the last interchange on the freeway. The freeway then crosses Leskard Road and Best Road, before ending at Highway 35/115 with a modified trumpet interchange.

Both Phase 1 of the 407 East Extension, as far as Harmony Road in Oshawa and Highway 412 opened to traffic on June 20, 2016. Phase 2A of the 407 East Extension, as far as Taunton Road in Clarington opened to traffic on January 2, 2018. Both Phase 2B of the 407 East Extension, as far as Highway 35 and Highway 115 in Clarington and Highway 418 opened to traffic on December 9, 2019.

== Tolls ==

Similar to most other toll highways, Highway 407 features no toll booths. Rather, a system of cameras and transponders allows for automatic toll collection. It was one of the first highways to exclusively use open road tolling. Highway 407 is otherwise designed as a normal freeway; interchanges connect directly to crossroads. A radio antenna detects when a vehicle with a transponder enters and exits the highway, calculating the toll rate. For vehicles without a transponder, an automatic license plate recognition system is used. In both cases, monthly statements are mailed to users. The automatic plate recognition system is linked to several provincial and U.S. state motor vehicle registries. Toll rates are set by the 407 ETR and the Province of Ontario for their respectively owned sections. However, the province set out limitations in the 407 ETR lease contract for maintaining traffic volumes to justify toll rates. Despite this, rates have increased annually against the requests of the provincial government, resulting in several court battles and the general public regarding the route as a luxury.

=== Plate denial ===
As part of the contractual agreement with the government, the MTO is required to deny licence plate validation stickers to drivers who have an outstanding 407 ETR bill over 125 days past due. This process was temporarily halted in February 2000 due to numerous false billing claims. Following a decision by the Ontario Divisional Court on November 7, 2005, the Ontario Registrar of Motor Vehicles was ordered to begin denying the validation or issue of Ontario licence plates and vehicle permits for 407 ETR users who have failed to pay owed fees. On November 22, 2005, the MTO announced that it would appeal the decision but would begin to deny plates until the appeal was decided. On February 24, 2006, the Ontario Court of Appeals denied the government leave to appeal the 2005 decision. As a result, plate denial remains in place.

=== Rates ===
* Users of both 407 ETR and Highways 407E/412/418 only receive one bill, with trips on each highway specified. 
* 407 ETR transponders are compatible with Highways 407E, 412, 418.

==== 407 ETR ====
: &quot;All dollar amounts listed are Canadian dollars. EB = eastbound, WB = westbound&quot;
The rate rose for tolls in 2019 and again in 2020. On December 31, 2019, it was announced that the highway would have seasonal toll rates.

As of February 1, 2020, the base tolls for driving on the 407 ETR are as follows:
* Starting February 1, 2018, there are 4 zones: 1 from QEW/403 to 401, 2 from 401 to 427, 3 from 427 to 404 and 4 from 404 to 407E (Brock Rd.)
* The toll rate that applies to a specific trip is determined by the time at which a vehicle enters the highway.
* Off-peak rates are in effect 19:00–06:00 Monday to Friday except public holidays, and 19:00–11:00 Saturday, Sunday, and holidays.
* Midday weekday rates are in effect 10:00–14:30, Monday to Friday except for holidays.
* Midday weekend/holiday rates are in effect 11:00–19:00, Saturday, Sunday, and holidays.
* Peak period rates are in effect 06:00–07:00, 09:00–10:00, 14:30–15:30 and 18:00–19:00, Monday to Friday except for public holidays.
* Peak hours rates are in effect 07:00–09:00 and 15:30–18:00, Monday to Friday except for public holidays.
*Heavy goods vehicles and lorries are assessed a minimum toll regardless of the length of their trip.
: * Light goods vehicles without transponders are assessed an additional video toll. Motorcycles are not charged a video toll because there is rarely a suitable place to mount a transponder.
: ** Heavy-duty vehicles are legally required to have transponders in order to use the highway; offenders may be penalized under the Highway Traffic Act.

==== Provincially operated section ====

To compensate for opening delays, tolling of both the Highway 407 extension and Highway 412 did not commence until February 2017. The tolls also applied to Highway 418 when first opened in December 2019. On April 5, 2022, Highways 412 and 418 became toll-free, but the tolls on the 407 East Extension remained. As of June 1, 2019, the following tolls applied for motorists using this section of the 407. The rate stayed the same in 2018 and rose in 2019:
* All end times displayed are rounded up to the nearest minute for simplicity (i.e. 06:00 is actually 5:59:59) 
* The toll rate that applies to a specific trip is determined by the time a vehicle enters the highway.
* Heavy goods vehicles and lorries are assessed a minimum toll regardless of the length of their trip: $3.00 off peak, $5.00 during peak hours. 
* As seen above, the cost of using the provincially owned tollways is less than that of using the 407 ETR.
* Light vehicles without transponders may be assessed an additional video toll.
* Vehicles weighing over 5,000 kilograms are divided into two categories: Heavy Single Units and Heavy Multiple Units. Heavy Multiple Unit Vehicles are charged two or three time the passenger rate, depending on vehicle size.
* All Heavy Unit vehicles are legally required to have transponders in order to use the highways; offenders may be penalized under the Highway Traffic Act. 

== Financial ==

=== Lease ownership ===
As of September, 2024 and unchanged since 2019, ownership of the 407 ETR Concession Company Limited (&quot;407 ETR&quot;), the operator and manager of the highway, is as follows:
* Indirectly owned subsidiaries of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board: 50.01%
* Cintra Global S.E., a subsidiary of Spanish firm Ferrovial S.A.: 43.23%
* AtkinsRéalis Canada Inc.: 6.76%

=== Revenue and profit ===
The concession has been called a &quot;cash cow&quot; for SNC-Lavalin, while local media has commented on the &quot;huge jump&quot; or &quot;soar&quot; in profits.

=== Market Valuation ===
The highway&#x27;s initial construction cost was pegged at $1.5 billion. The toll concession was sold for $3.1 billion.

In 1998, MPP E. J. Douglas Rollins claimed that the province had as much as $104 billion invested in the highway.

On October 5, 2010, the Canada Pension Plan announced that an agreement had been reached with the highway&#x27;s owners to purchase a 10% stake for $894 million. This implied a value of close to $9 billion for the highway in its then-current state.

In April 2019, SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. announced the sale of a 10.01% share of the highway to the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS) for $3.25 billion, implying a $32.5 billion valuation of the highway. After the sale, SNC-Lavalin would own only 6.76% of the highway. In August 2019, a court approved the sale of SNC-Lavalin&#x27;s 10% stake to CPPIB instead of to OMERS.

== History ==

=== Planning and initial construction ===
Although the construction of Highway 407 did not begin until 1987, planning for the bypass of Highway 401 north of Toronto began in the late 1950s. Concepts for the new &quot;dual highway&quot; first appeared in the 1959 plan for Metropolitan Toronto. Land adjacent to several hydro corridors was acquired for the future freeway in the 1960s, but sat vacant as the Ontario Department of Highway (predecessor to the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO)) opted instead to widen Highway 401 to a twelve-lane collector-express system. The Highway 401 expansion project was considered a success and construction of Highway 407 was shelved for almost thirty years. The plan was revisited in the mid-1980s as congestion in Toronto pushed roads beyond capacity. In 1986, Premier David Peterson was given a helicopter tour of the city during rush-hour; construction of the highway was announced soon thereafter, and began in 1987.

The Ontario government&#x27;s normal process for highway construction was not possible given the financial constraints of the recession of the early 1990s. The Peterson government sought out private sector partnerships and acquired innovative electronic tolling technology. Two firms bid on the project, with the Canadian Highways International Corporation being selected as the operator of the highway.
Financing for the highway was to be paid by user tolls lasting 35 years, after which it would return to the provincial system as a toll-free 400-series highway. The succeeding government of Bob Rae announced on March 31, 1995, that the corridor reserved for Highway 403 between Burlington and Oakville would instead be built as a western extension of Highway 407.

The first segment of Highway 407, between Highway 410 and Highway 404, was ceremonially opened to traffic on June 7, 1997; no tolls were charged for a month to allow motorists to test-drive the freeway. Several other sections were well underway at this point. A extension westwards to Highway 401 was opened just months later on December 13, 1997.
That section was connected with Highway 403 to the south on September 4, 1998,
with a temporary two lane ramp connecting to Trafalgar Road.
In the east, an extension to Markham Road, at what was then the southern terminus of Highway 48, was completed in early 1998. However, due to the protest of local residents and officials concerning traffic spill-off (a scenario revisited with the extension to Oshawa), the freeway was opened only as far as McCowan Road on February 18.
The short segment from McCowan Road to Markham Road remained closed for over a year, as locals feared the funneling of traffic onto Main Street, which is named Markham Road south of the freeway. Both Markham and McCowan were widened to four lanes between Highway 407 and Steeles Avenue at this time. This did not alleviate concerns, but on June 24, 1999, the extension opened to continued protest regardless.

In 2000, the 407 consortium had planned to extend the four lane highway by 16 kilometres eastward from Markham to Brock Road in Pickering by the end of the following year.

The 16 kilometre segment of Highway 407 from Markham to Brock Road in Pickering opened on August 24, 2001.

=== Privatization and original extensions ===
When Mike Harris was elected Premier in 1995 on his platform of the Common Sense Revolution, the Ontario government faced an $11 billion annual deficit and a $100 billion debt. Seeking to balance the books, a number of publicly owned services were privatized over the following years. Although initially spared, Highway 407 was privatized quickly in the year leading up to the 1999 provincial elections. It was leased to a conglomerate of private companies for $3.1 billion. The Ontario-based corporation, known as 407 International Inc., was initially owned by the Spanish multinational Ferrovial through its subsidiary Cintra Infraestructuras (61.3%), the Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin (22.6%), and CDP Capital (16.1%). The 99-year lease agreement granted the consortium unlimited control over the highway and its tolls, dependent on traffic volume; however, the government maintains the right to build a transport system within the highway right-of-way. The highway has since been described as a &quot;value generating monster&quot; and &quot;cash cow&quot; for SNC-Lavalin and one of the &quot;worst financial missteps&quot; by any government in Ontario&#x27;s history.

When purchased, the highway travelled from the junction of Highway 403 in Mississauga to Markham Road in Markham. Extensions westward to the QEW and eastward to Highway 7 and Brock Road in Pickering were constructed by the corporation, as mandated in the lease agreement. The western extension, from Highway 403 southwest to the QEW, was not part of the original Highway 407 concept in 1987; rather, the corridor was originally intended to connect the Hamilton and Mississauga sections of Highway 403. Highway 407 was originally slated to assume the temporary routing for Highway 403 along the Mississauga-Oakville boundary to end at the QEW. However, the Bob Rae led Ontario government altered these plans in 1995, and the corporation constructed this section quickly upon obtaining the lease. Sections opened throughout the middle of 2001: between Neyagawa Boulevard and Highway 403 on June 17; between Bronte Road and Neyagawa Boulevard on June 29; between Dundas Street and Bronte Road on July 18; and between the Freeman Interchange and Dundas Street on July 30. In the east, a final extension between Markham Road and Highway 7 opened a month later on August 30.

=== Highway 407 East project ===
A provincially operated long extension to the 407 ETR, known as Highway 407 East (or 407E) during planning, began construction in 2012, with the project undertaken in two separate phases. Phase 1 was opened on June 20, 2016, consisting of a extension to Harmony Road in Oshawa, as well as the Highway 412. The extension was free of tolls until February 1, 2017. Phase 2A, which opened on January 2, 2018, added a extension to Taunton Road at the future Highway 418 interchange. Phase 2B, which opened on December 9, 2019, added a extension to Highway 35 and Highway 115, as well as the Highway 418.

An environmental assessment (EA) to analyze the proposed extension was undertaken in the early 2000s. The assessment also included studies of the two north–south connectors. A preferred route was announced in June 2007, and the EA was completed in June 2009. On March 6, 2007, as part of the FLOW initiative, the Government of Canada and the Province of Ontario confirmed the extension of the 407 to Highway 35 and Highway 115 in Clarington, including the connector highways, with an announced completion date of 2013.
On January 27, 2009, the provincial government announced that the extension would be a tolled highway but owned by the province and with tolls set by the province. The announcement also indicated that the province expected to issue a Request for Proposals later in the year.
The contract, which is valued at $1.6 billion and includes construction and operation of the highway, was eventually awarded to the same consortium that owns 407 ETR.
On June 9, 2010, the MTO approved the extension as far east as Simcoe Street in Oshawa, announcing plans to phase construction of the extension. Local residents and politicians rejected the plan, as had happened with the section between McCowan Road and Markham Road. A motion was proposed in the Ontario Legislature to build the full extension in one project, but failed to pass. Instead, a compromise was issued on March 10, 2011: the first phase would extend Highway 407 to Harmony Road in Oshawa by 2015, including Highway 412; the second phase would then complete the extension to Highway 35 / 115 by 2020, including Highway 418. This timeline was confirmed by Premier Dalton McGuinty on May 24, 2012, and construction began in the first quarter of 2013.

In early December 2015, it was announced that contractor delays would push the opening of the first phase from December 18 to the spring of 2016.
The extension did not open until the morning of June 20, 2016, in the last hours of Spring 2016.

On December 9, 2019, the final portion of the 407 East highway, the section of the highways east of and all of Ontario Highway 418 opened to the public, marking the end of the 407 East project. The final portion was originally projected to be completed in 2020. Unlike when the extension originally opened, tolling started immediately on the final portion. The highway now extends east to Ontario Highway 115, providing more options for people living in and around Peterborough to get into Toronto and the western part of the Greater Toronto Area.

=== Since completion ===
Between 2018 and 2019, Highway 407 was widened between Markham Road and Brock Road. The first project, widening the highway to 6 lanes between York-Durham Line and Brock Road, began in Spring 2018 and was completed in August 2018. The second project, which widened the highway to 8 lanes between Markham Road and York-Durham Line, was completed in September 2019.

There are currently plans for multiple new interchanges, as well as reconstruction of the ramps with route 401 to serve route 413.

== Controversies ==

Highway 407 ETR has been the subject of several controversies over its two decades of existence.

=== Privatization ===
The privatization of the road, the toll rate increases, and the 99-year lease period have been widely criticized.
* The original plan was for the tolls to end after the construction cost was paid off, probably after about 35 years; there is no indication that the private owners will eliminate the tolls.
* Although Premier Mike Harris promised that tolls would not rise by more than 30 percent, they have risen by over 200 percent by 2015, from about 10 cents to over 30 cents per kilometre.
* There have been criticisms and lawsuits arising from plate denial issues.
* Another criticism is that taxpayers did not receive a fair price for the highway: In 2002, just three years after the original sale for C$3.1 billion, Macquarie Infrastructure Group, an Australian investment firm, estimated that the highway was worth four times the original price. By 2019, the estimated value had risen to C$30 billion.

* Both the length of the lease agreement and the fact that the road is controlled by private corporations mean that decisions about the road and the tolls are made with less accountability to the public. The Harris government failed to put any restrictions on toll increases (as long as the road attracted a certain volume of cars). As a result, commuters in the densely populated GTA will have no protection against rising tolls on the highway for the entire 99-year term of the lease.

=== Safety concerns and PEO report ===
Cost-saving measures and ensuing safety concerns resulted in an independent Ontario Provincial Police investigation shortly before the opening of the freeway. An expert panel of engineers, assembled by the Professional Engineers Ontario, released a report outlining concerns regarding the decreased loop ramp radii and the lack of protective guardrails along sharp curves, in addition to the lack of a concrete median barrier to separate the two travel directions. However, it was also argued that the large grass median was sufficient to prevent crossover collisions, given that Highway 410 has a similar median.

=== Toll rate approval ===
The Ontario provincial government has quarrelled with 407 ETR over toll rates and customer service but is largely tied down by the lease contract. On February 2, 2004, the government notified 407 ETR that it was considered to be in default of the contract because of 407 ETR&#x27;s decision to raise toll rates without first obtaining provincial clearance. The court&#x27;s initial decision sided with 407 ETR: on July 10, 2004, an independent arbitrator affirmed that 407 ETR has the power to raise toll rates without first consulting the government. The government filed an appeal of this decision but was overruled by an Ontario Superior Court decision released on January 6, 2005; however, a subsequent ruling by the Ontario Court of Appeal on June 13, 2005, granted the government permission to appeal the decision.

Around the same time, the government also faced off against 407 ETR in court regarding plate denial.

Members of the public have accused the 407 ETR of predatory billing practices, including false billing and continued plate denial after bankruptcy. In 2016, after a four-year legal battle, consumers won an $8 million class action lawsuit.

=== Comparative toll rates ===
The 407 ETR and Cobequid Pass Toll Highway (Trans Canada Highway in Nova Scotia) are the only two toll highways (not counting toll bridges on highways) in Canada.

Some other toll rates are:
* New York State Niagara Thruway, exit 1 to exit 20B, approx. 30 km, US$1 cash, about C$1.33, or about $0.044 per km (2019)
* Cobequid Pass Toll Highway in Nova Scotia, flat rate $4 cash, for approximately 25 km of highway, or about $0.16 per km (2019)
* Chicago Skyway $0.28 per km (2012)
* Fort Bend Parkway Toll Road in Texas $0.13 per km (2012)
* I-25 HOV Express Lanes in Colorado $0.357 per km (2012)

== Future ==
The future town of Seaton is currently under development with the release of development lands in Durham north of the Gatineau Hydro Corridor and west of Brock Road. This development originally included the proposed Pickering Airport, slated for construction in 2020, however, in January 2025 the Federal Government officially cancelled all plans for the Pickering Airport. Interchanges with future extensions of Rossland Road (at the current North Road overpass, near Whitevale) and Whites Road (currently Sideline 26) will be built as part of the large road network planned for the development.

In the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario&#x27;s 2025 re-election campaign, Premier Doug Ford said that a re-elected Progressive Conservative government would remove tolls from the provincially-owned portion of the highway.

<doc id="298607" wikidata="Q3115973" url="?curid=298607" title="Great North Eastern Railway">
<text>Great North Eastern Railway, often referred to as GNER, was a train operating company in the United Kingdom, owned by Sea Containers, that operated the InterCity East Coast franchise on the East Coast Main Line between London, Yorkshire, North East England and Scotland from April 1996 until December 2007.

During March 1996, Sea Containers was awarded the franchise to operate the East Coast services; it begin operations on 28 April 1996. Initially receiving a favourable reception, the company brought in several service alterations and innovations, including the leasing of Class 373 &quot;Regional Eurostars&quot; along with the refurbishment of the InterCity 225 fleet. However, GNER&#x27;s reputation and passenger numbers were both hit by a pair of derailments during the early 2000s, the Hatfield rail crash and the Great Heck rail crash. Plans to procure a fleet of tilting trains based on the Pendolino were mooted by the company, but were discarded amid a protracted and complex refranchising process.

During March 2005, the Strategic Rail Authority awarded the East Coast franchise to GNER for a second time; however, the terms for this second franchise period were financially demanding, seeing the withdrawal of subsidies and enactment of charges to the British Government. Concerns over the viability of such payments, as well as the general financial condition of Sea Containers were well-founded, with the latter entering bankruptcy in November 2006. Following its inability to fulfil agreed payments, GNER was stripped of the franchise during December 2006, although it continued to run services on the route for another year via a management contract. The final northbound GNER train was the 20:30 London King&#x27;s Cross – Newcastle on 8 December 2007; the company was replaced by the new franchisee National Express East Coast one day later.

==History==
===Background and early years===
The creation of the Great North Eastern Railway (GNER) is closely associated with the privatisation of British Rail that was enacted during the mid 1990s; as a result of new government policies, railway operations were to be operated by various private sector companies working under a franchise arrangement. Accordingly, the InterCity East Coast franchise was one such franchise created to take over operations of the East Coast Main Line (ECML) from British Rail. According to industry periodical &quot;Rail&quot;, the East Coast franchise was commonly viewed as one of the better franchises to bid for, as the ECML had been electrified only a few years before hand and was being served by the newest intercity stock in British Rail&#x27;s inventory, the InterCity 225; the line also had a well-established reputation for its high-speed services.

Accordingly, numerous private companies submitted bids to the Office for Passenger Rail Franchising. One such firm was the Bermuda-based transport and container leasing company Sea Containers, whose bid was announced as the winner during March 1996, leading to a seven-year franchise upon the East Coast being awarded to their newly-created subsidiary GNER. The initials &quot;GNER&quot; were reminiscent of the historic London and North Eastern Railway (LNER, no relation to the current train operating company), the company that operated the route before being nationalised as part of British Railways in 1948. Additionally, the name combined the initials of two of the LNER&#x27;s predecessor companies, the Great Northern Railway (GNR), who had built King&#x27;s Cross station, and the Great Eastern Railway (GER). GNER made further links to the past companies by adopting a dark-blue livery with red trimming lines for its trains, similar to that used by the GER, and using a Victorian coat of arms-style crest on their trains.
The company&#x27;s image was professionally designed by Vignelli Associates, an Italian design house; it was responsible for the train liveries and interiors, staff uniforms and overall corporate identity. Their website states &quot;The Great North Eastern Railway logo emphasises the NE. The train has a new livery, dark blue with a bright red stripe containing all necessary information. It has a crest, a required tradition, and sober interiors for both first and tourist class.&quot;

Operations commenced on 28 April 1996. From its onset, GNER&#x27;s management had pledged to bring about substantial changes and improvements upon the ECML. Amongst its franchise promises was that the train mileage operated in the 1995/1996 period would be initially maintained for period of two years, along with a stated ambition to increase it in the long term; furthermore, all existing rolling stock would undergo refurbishment, and that all trains would feature an onboard buffet and trolley service. The stations of the route were also to receive improvement packages; these were typically focused on improving access and security alike, while neighbouring car parks were also expanded wherever reasonable to do so.

During January 1997, Sea Containers Chairman James Sherwood announced that GNER intended to procure a pair of two new-build tilting trains; these were claimed to enable the London-Edinburgh journey to be reduced to only 3 hours and 30 minutes, in part achieved via their increased maximum speed of 140mph (225kmh). While GNER&#x27;s Chief Executive Christopher Garnett stated that he expected the delivery of these new trains within two years, an order having been reportedly placed during October 1997, no such tilting trains were ever introduced appear. The original fleet would be supplemented by additional rolling stock to bolster capacity; such stock included the one-off Class 89 locomotive and a number of Class 373 &quot;Regional Eurostars&quot;.

Within its first few years of operation, GNER had succeeded at increasing the speed of the fastest scheduled service in Great Britain, the London-York route having a reported average speed of 112mph at its fastest. According to Rail magazine, the operator&#x27;s customer service was frequently praised, while passengers also warmed received its promises of an increased quality of onboard catering. During May 2000, the leased &quot;Regional Eurostar&quot; fleet was properly introduced to GNER service, facilitating the inclusion of additional London to York services in a new timetable; however, unlike the Intercity 225, the Eurostars were restricted to a maximum speed of 110mph to reduce excessive wear on the overhead wiring.

===Into the new century===
GNER&#x27;s operations were greatly affected by a pair of accidents during the early 2000s. On 17 October 2000, the Hatfield crash occurred with the high speed derailment of an Intercity 225 set, which was primarily caused by the failure of a rail that had been poorly maintained. The incident had deeply affected GNER’s business, not only due to a significant drop in confidence amongst its passengers but the rapid enactment of many emergency speed restrictions imposed by the national infrastructure company Railtrack. The incident was compounded, just as business seemed to recovering, when another serious accident involving GNER occurred on 28 February 2001. The Selby rail crash involved a Newcastle–London service that had derailed after striking a Land Rover that had driven off the M62 motorway; the GNER train was shortly after hit by a Freightliner train, compounding the incident and death toll alike. Although GNER was blameless in both incidents, the travelling public were shaken; by March 2001, the revenue of long-distance operators had declined by an average of 21 per cent.

By this point, the future franchising arrangements of the East Coast route were already being examined. During March 2000, the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority announced that two companies, Sea Containers and Virgin Rail Group, had been shortlisted to bid for the next franchise. GNER&#x27;s submission had included its plan to purchase a fleet of 25 tilting trains, similar to the British Rail Class 390 Pendolinos then being introduced on the West Coast Main Line; this were envisioned to feature multiple types of propulsion, being divided between electric and diesel-powered examples so that they could serve all of the franchise&#x27;s destinations. In part due to the complexity of the evaluation process and issues with the tender itself, the selection process ground to a halt.

However, in January 2002, the Strategic Rail Authority announced that the refranchising process had been scrapped and that a two-year extension had been awarded to Sea Containers, extending GNER&#x27;s franchise period to April 2005. During October 2004, the Strategic Rail Authority issued the Invitation to Tender for the InterCity East Coast franchise to the four shortlisted bidders, Danish State Railways/English Welsh &amp; Scottish, First, GNER and Virgin Rail Group. The bidding process was described as being highly competitive, several of the bidders were reportedly determined to dislodge the incumbent GNER.

In March 2005, the Strategic Rail Authority awarded the franchise to GNER for seven years, with a three-year extension based on targets being met, starting on 1 May 2005. The terms of the new franchise had considerable differences from that of the original period; instead of GNER receiving subsidies for its operations, it would be instead paying the British state for the privilege of doing so; there was reportedly concerns over the financial viability of such an arrangement from the onset. In order to meet these payments, GNER assumed passenger numbers would increase by around 30 per cent across the life of the franchise, reaching around 20 million by 2015.

===Rising competition and financial issues===
In May 2006, it was revealed that GNER&#x27;s parent company Sea Containers was in financial difficulties, and was rumoured to be bordering on insolvency. Questions were raised as to whether GNER could continue operating should its parent company cease trading. The company rejected this assertion, stating that its lines of credit and financial activities were &quot;ring-fenced&quot; away from Sea Containers, and therefore a cessation of services for this reason was impossible. It did not however stop speculation from rival TOCs (principally First) and Virgin Rail Group that they would be keen to rebid for the ECML franchise if it were put back out to tender. In July 2006, rumours began circulating that Sea Containers would be prepared to sell GNER in an effort to stave off resorting to Chapter 11 proceedings to secure itself from its creditors.

During July 2006, the High Court rejected GNER&#x27;s judicial review over the Office of Rail Regulation&#x27;s decision to allow rival train operating company Grand Central to operate trains along part of the ECML, – and in particular its right to call at York, one of the principal (and lucrative) stops on the ECML. GNER had made its application partly on the basis that &#x27;open-access&#x27; train operators are not required to meet the same fixed costs for accessing Network Rail&#x27;s infrastructure as train operating companies running services under a contract or &#x27;franchise&#x27; with the Department for Transport. GNER&#x27;s case failed principally because the High Court determined that not only did European law permit the Rail Regulator to establish a charging regime for open-access operators which was different from the one which applies to franchised operators (such as GNER), in this case not imposing a fixed charge on open-access operators, but that if he had not done so, he would have been acting illegally because of the very different conditions under which open-access operators and franchised operators get access to the network. The High Court (Mr Justice Sullivan) refused GNER permission to appeal.

That same month, GNER announced that its chief executive officer, Christopher Garnett, was to step down, having occupied that position since Sea Containers had originally been awarded their first franchise. Amid growing industry speculation that Sea Containers was working towards a &quot;financial restructuring&quot;, the company&#x27;s President and Chief Executive Bob Mackenzie was named as Garnett&#x27;s successor. The firm&#x27;s problems were further fuelled by GNER&#x27;s poor profitability, which had been linked to the company&#x27;s overbidding for the franchise coupled to what proved to be crippling premium repayments to the government. The company blamed the effects of the 7/7 terrorist attacks, increased electricity prices, and increased competition from low-cost airlines for the decline in passenger numbers. It also faced a growing challenge from the revitalised West Coast services operated by Virgin Trains. The company attempted to address the problem by waiving booking fees on internet sales, cutting staff numbers, and raising fares and car-parking charges where the market could bear it. In a press interview in September 2006, GNER&#x27;s ex-chief Christopher Garnett hinted at a bleak future for GNER and the franchising system, claiming that the trend among TOCs to overbid for the renewal of franchises would result in a financially unsustainable railway.

In October 2006, Sea Containers filed for bankruptcy protection under the US Chapter 11 process, therefore allowing the company to continue trading while it sorted out its finances. However, this meant that the company was unable to fulfil its guarantees in respect to its GNER subsidiary, greatly increasing the risk exposure of the latter&#x27;s operations.

===Demise and transfer===
During December 2006, the Department for Transport announced its intention to strip Sea Containers of its franchise; this was reportedly due to the company&#x27;s financial issues and having been overbid. Despite this announcement, GNER continued to operate the franchise under a management contract, which was extendable for up to two years, while the Department for Transport undertook the selection of a new franchisee.

In February 2007, the Department for Transport announced that Arriva, FirstGroup, National Express and Virgin Rail Group had been shortlisted to lodge bids for the franchise. In April 2007, it was announced that GNER had a 10% stake in the bid lodged by Stagecoach &amp; Virgin. In August 2007, the Department for Transport awarded the franchise to National Express, and GNER&#x27;s services transferred to National Express East Coast on 9 December 2007.

==Services==

GNER&#x27;s principal routes were from London King&#x27;s Cross to Leeds and Edinburgh Waverley.

From Edinburgh Waverley, selected services continued on to Motherwell and Glasgow Central, Inverness, or Aberdeen. From Leeds, some trains ran to and from Bradford Forster Square, Skipton, and Harrogate.

One service per day also ran to and from Hull via Selby. Other towns and cities served by GNER trains included Stevenage, Peterborough, Grantham, Newark, Retford, Doncaster, Wakefield, Shipley, Keighley, Horsforth, Brough, York, Northallerton, Darlington, Durham, Newcastle, Morpeth, Alnmouth (for Alnwick), Berwick-upon-Tweed, Dunbar, Motherwell, Inverkeithing, Kirkcaldy, Leuchars, Arbroath, Montrose, Stonehaven, Falkirk, Stirling, Perth, Pitlochry, Kingussie, and Aviemore.

===Principal routes===

====London-Leeds====

The service between King&#x27;s Cross and Leeds was generally hourly, with trains serving most main intermediate stations. With the completion of the Allington Chord, near Grantham, having increased track capacity, GNER began to operate a full half-hourly service throughout the day on this route in May 2007.

====London-Newcastle-Edinburgh====
A half-hourly service between King&#x27;s Cross and Newcastle operated for most of the day, departing from London on the hour and the half-hour. The &#x27;top of the hour&#x27; departures continued through to Edinburgh (with the 10:00 keeping the traditional name &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot;); some of these ran on to either Glasgow Central, Aberdeen or Inverness.
These trains generally ran as limited-stop expresses between London and Newcastle: all trains called at York, and most at Peterborough and Darlington, though afternoon and evening departures from King&#x27;s Cross ran non-stop to Doncaster or York. The trains leaving King&#x27;s Cross on the half-hour generally terminated at Newcastle and served other intermediate stations such as Grantham, Newark, Retford, Doncaster and Durham as well as Peterborough, York, and Darlington.

====London-Glasgow====
GNER operated ten trains per day between King&#x27;s Cross and Glasgow. With the upgrade of the West Coast Main Line (WCML) between London Euston and Glasgow to 125 mph completed, GNER could no longer compete with Virgin Trains on this route in terms of journey times (5hrs 30mins compared to the new 4hrs 25min time on the WCML), but they did provide a link from Glasgow to Newcastle and York and a secondary route for use when the WCML was closed for engineering work.

===Minor routes===

====London/Leeds-Aberdeen====

There were three trains per day each way between King&#x27;s Cross and Aberdeen, the journey time being just over seven hours. There was also one service per day arriving at Aberdeen from Leeds. These services were operated using a diesel InterCity 125 because the Edinburgh to Aberdeen line and the section of the Cross Country Route between Leeds and York are not electrified.

====London-Inverness====
A daily service operated between King&#x27;s Cross and Inverness, named the &quot;Highland Chieftain&quot;, a journey taking just over 8 hours. The service was operated using a diesel InterCity 125, as the line north of Edinburgh is not electrified.

====London-Hull====
GNER ran the &quot;Hull Executive&quot; from Hull Paragon to London King&#x27;s Cross, with one morning journey down to London and one evening journey up to Hull. The service was operated by a diesel InterCity 125, as the line to Hull is not electrified. More regular services between London King&#x27;s Cross and Hull Paragon were operated by Hull Trains.

====London-Bradford====

There were two trains per day between London and Bradford Forster Square. These were extensions of the King&#x27;s Cross–Leeds services and were operated using an electric InterCity 225. Some of these services were also operated using a Class 89 electric locomotive, Mark 4 coaches and a DVT until 2001.

====London-Skipton====
There was a morning train from Skipton and Keighley to King&#x27;s Cross with an early evening return. As with the Bradford trains, this was an extension to the Leeds–London service. Though the line to Skipton is electrified throughout, the GNER service to/from the town operated using a diesel InterCity 125 because the electrical infrastructure on the Leeds-to-Skipton line at the time was unable to provide sufficient power to support an InterCity 225 alongside the existing electric local services.

====London-Harrogate====
There was a Monday-Saturday morning departure from Harrogate to King&#x27;s Cross. However, there was no return journey so passengers were required to change at Leeds or York on to Northern Rail services to Harrogate. This service was operated using a diesel InterCity 125 as the line to Harrogate is not electrified.

The Saturday running of this service was the week&#x27;s only GNER southbound service from Leeds not to call at Wakefield Westgate. This service departed from Leeds and took the Selby line to join the East Coast Main Line at Hambleton.

==Rolling stock==
At the beginning of operations in April 1996, GNER inherited a fleet of InterCity 125 High Speed Train sets made up of Class 43 power cars and Mark 3 carriages, and InterCity 225 sets made up of Class 91 locomotives and Mark 4 carriages and Driving Van Trailers. It continued to operate both types throughout its time operating the franchise.

One early, and particularly low cost, means of expanding GNER&#x27;s fleet was the purchase of the Class 89 prototype electric locomotive 89001. After being repaired at a reported cost of £100,000 and repainted in GNER livery, it went into revenue-earning service in March 1997, being primarily used on services from London King&#x27;s Cross to Leeds and Bradford Forster Square. 89001 had to be withdrawn from service in October 2000 due to technical problems, but its brief service life had helped alleviate GNER&#x27;s shortage of traction due to reliability issues.

By 2000, it was clear that GNER&#x27;s Class 91 fleet was in need of refurbishment to address reliability issues, thus the company made arrangements to lease alternative traction as a stop-gap measure. Between May 2000 and December 2005, GNER leased a number of Class 373 &quot;Regional Eurostars&quot; from Eurostar. In GNER service, the fleet was operated for services between London and York, and later Leeds, but had to be restricted to a maximum speed of between Grantham and Doncaster because of problems with the overhead wire and pantograph interface. Furthermore, as a consequence of gauging restrictions, the Eurostars were not permitted to operate north of York to Newcastle, Glasgow or Edinburgh. During November 2005, it was announced that, following their refurbishment, the InterCity 225 fleet would displace the Eurostars.

The InterCity 225s were refurbished by Bombardier Transportation between 2003–2005, the programme was named &quot;Project Mallard&quot; in honour of the LNER steam locomotive. They boasted re-designed interiors and new features such as Wi-Fi and electric sockets at every seat pair.

GNER bought twelve Mark 3 sleeping carriages with the intention of converting them to passenger carriages to lengthen HSTs. However, this programme was cancelled when GNER was able to lease other Mark 3s that were released by Virgin CrossCountry after this operator withdrew its HSTs. One commitment for the new franchise awarded in 2005 was to upgrade all of its HSTs to the same standards as the InterCity 225s. The Class 43 power cars were overhauled by Brush Traction in Loughborough, their Paxman Valenta engines replaced with MTU 16V4000 units. To operate increased services to Leeds, GNER leased two former Midland Mainline HSTs from May 2007. 

English, Welsh &amp; Scottish Railway provided strategically-placed rescue locomotives, originally Class 47s and later Class 67s. EWS also provided Class 90s to cover for Class 91s; one was repainted in GNER livery but not dedicated to the franchise.

The HSTs were allocated to Craigentinny Depot in Edinburgh and the InterCity 225s to Bounds Green Depot in London. Lighter maintenance and servicing were carried out at Neville Hill Depot in Leeds and Heaton Depot in Newcastle.

During the late 1990s, GNER announced plans to purchase a pair of two tilting trains, based on Italian Pendolino technology. This ambition was expanded in the early 2000s when, as part of a refranchising bid, GNER stated that its planned to purchase a fleet of 25 tilting trains, similar to the British Rail Class 390 Pendolinos then being introduced on the West Coast Main Line; this were envisioned to feature multiple types of propulsion, being divided between electric and diesel-powered examples so that they could serve all of the franchise&#x27;s destinations. However, the tender and bid alike were abandoned, and no such trains were ever introduced.

<text>A state of emergency is a situation in which a government is empowered to put through policies that it would normally not be permitted to do, for the safety and protection of its citizens. A government can declare such a state before, during, or after a natural disaster, civil unrest, armed conflict, medical pandemic or epidemic or other biosecurity risk.

== Relationship with international law ==
Under international law, rights and freedoms may be suspended during a state of emergency, depending on the severity of the emergency and a government&#x27;s policies.

==Use and viewpoints==
Democracies use states of emergency to manage a range of situations from extreme weather events to public order situations. Dictatorial regimes often declare a state of emergency that is prolonged indefinitely for the life of the regime, or for extended periods of time so that derogations can be used to override human rights of their citizens usually protected by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). In some situations, martial law is also declared, allowing the military greater authority to act. In other situations, emergency is not declared and de facto measures taken or decree-law adopted by the government. Nicole Questiaux (France) and Leandro Despouy (Argentina), two consecutive United Nations Special Rapporteurs, have recommended to the international community to adopt the following &quot;principles&quot; to be observed during a state or de facto situation of emergency: Principles of Legality, Proclamation, Notification, Time Limitation, Exceptional Threat, Proportionality, Non-Discrimination, Compatibility, Concordance and Complementarity of the Various Norms of International Law (cf. &quot;Question of Human Rights and State of Emergency&quot;, E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/19, at Chapter II; see also &quot;état d&#x27;exception&quot;).

Article 4 to the ICCPR, permits states to derogate from certain rights guaranteed by the ICCPR in &quot;time of public emergency&quot;. Any measures derogating from obligations under the Covenant, however, must be to only the extent required by the exigencies of the situation, and must be announced by the State Party to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The European Convention on Human Rights and American Convention on Human Rights have similar derogatory provisions. No derogation is permitted to the International Labour Conventions.

Some, such as political theorist and Nazi Party member Carl Schmitt, have argued that the power to decide the initiation of the state of emergency defines sovereignty itself. In &quot;State of Exception&quot; (2005), Giorgio Agamben criticized this idea, arguing that the mechanism of the state of emergency deprives certain people of their civil and political rights, producing his interpretation of &quot;homo sacer&quot;.

=== Graduation ===
In many democratic states there are a selection of legal definitions for specific states of emergency, when the constitution of the State is partially in abeyance depending on the nature of the perceived threat to the general public. In order of severity these may include:
* Martial law: when civil rights are severely restricted by the imposition of military force within a sovereign state, for example during a period of extreme threat of invasion or actual hostilities by foreign forces
* State of siege: when the civil rights of specified persons or groups such as political activists are likely to be curtailed, for example to prevent an insurrection or organized acts of treason by suspected agents provocateurs
* Civil emergency: dealing with disaster areas and requiring the deployment of extraordinary resources to contain dangerous situations such as natural disasters or extensive malicious property damage such as may occur during rioting or by arson. As well as regular emergency services, sometimes military forces may be assigned to deliver aid under especially dangerous conditions or to prevent looting

=== Abuse ===
The state of emergency can be abused by being invoked. An example would be to allow a state to suppress internal opposition without having to respect human rights. An example was the August 1991 attempted coup in the Soviet Union (USSR) where the coup leaders invoked a state of emergency; the failure of the coup led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

Derogations by states having ratified or acceded to binding international agreements such as the ICCPR, the American and European Conventions on Human Rights and the International Labor Conventions are monitored by independent expert committees, regional Courts and other State Parties.

== Law in selected countries ==

=== Albania ===
The Constitution of Albania grants only the Parliament of Albania the power to declare a state of emergency, based on the advice of the government. The state of emergency can last for up to 60 days, and may be extended by the parliament for no more than 90 days.

The Albanian Armed Forces are only permitted to intervene if the civil police have been unable to restore order. During a state of emergency, articles 15 (inviolability of constitutional rights), 18 (equality before the law), 19 (right to citizenship), 20 (protection of minority rights), 21 (right to life), 24 (freedom of conscience and religion), 25 (right to not be subjected to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment), 29 (prohibition of ex post facto law), 30 (innocence before being proven guilty), 32 (rights during a criminal proceeding), 32 (self-incrimination), 34 (double jeopardy), 39.1 (prohibition of expulsion of
nationals), 41 (right to property and related rights), 42 (due process clause), 43 (right to appeal), 48 (right to complain to public bodies), 54 (special protection of children, pregnant women, and new mothers), and 55 (right to healthcare from the state and equality of health services) of the constitution may not be limited.

If a natural disaster is declared, articles 37 (inviolability of the residence), 38 (right to choose residence), 41.4 (right to fair compensation for expropriation), 49 (right to freely choose your profession), 51 (right to strike) may be limited. The state of a natural disaster is distinct from that of a national emergency.

During a state of emergency, the parliament may not be dissolved, a new president may not be elected, elections for local government bodies or referendums may not be held, and the Constitution, the electoral code, and the extraordinary measures law may not be changed. The constitution requires proportionality with regards to the level of risk and requires the government to work to re-establish the conditions for the normal functioning of the state as soon as possible.

=== Argentina ===
The Constitution of Argentina, which has been amended several times, has always allowed for a state of emergency (literally &quot;estado de sitio&quot;, &quot;state of siege&quot;), to be declared if the constitution or the authorities it creates are endangered by internal unrest or foreign attack. This provision was much abused during dictatorships, with long-lasting states of siege giving the government a free hand to suppress opposition. The American Convention on Human Rights (Pacto de San José de Costa Rica), adopted in 1969 but ratified by Argentina only in 1984 immediately after the end of the National Reorganization Process, restricts abuse of the state of emergency by requiring any signatory nation declaring such a state to inform the other signatories of its circumstances and duration, and what rights are affected.

=== Australia ===

State-of-emergency legislation differs in each state of Australia. With regard to emergency management, regions (usually on a local government area basis) that have been affected by a natural disaster are the responsibility of the state, until that state declares a State of Emergency where access to the Federal Emergency Fund becomes available to help respond to and recover from natural disasters. A State of Emergency does not apply to the whole state, but rather districts or shires, where essential services may have been disrupted.

On 18 March 2020, a nationwide human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia owing to the risks to human health posed by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, after the National Security Committee met the previous day. The &quot;Biosecurity Act 2015&quot; specifies that the governor-general of Australia may declare such an emergency if the Health Minister is satisfied that &quot;a listed human disease is posing a severe and immediate threat, or is causing harm, to human health on a nationally significant scale&quot;. This gives the Minister sweeping powers, including imposing restrictions or preventing the movement of people and goods between specified places, and evacuations. The &quot;Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) Declaration 2020&quot; was declared by the Governor-General, David Hurley, under Section 475 of the Act.

==== New South Wales ====
In New South Wales, the NSW Premier can, pursuant to the &quot;State Emergency and Rescue Management Act 1989&quot;, declare a state of emergency due to an actual or imminent occurrence (such as fire, flood, storm, earthquake, explosion, terrorist act, accident, epidemic or warlike action) which endangers, or threatens to endanger, the safety or health of persons or animals in the State, or destroys or damages, or threatens to destroy or damage, property in the State, or causes a failure of, or a significant disruption to, an essential service or infrastructure. The Premier declared a state of emergency on 11 November 2019 in response to the 2019–2020 New South Wales bushfires. It was the fifth time that a state of emergency had been declared in that state since 2006 and it lasted for seven days. Subsequent declarations were made on 19 December for a further seven days, and again on 2 January 2020. In NSW, the 2019–2020 bushfire season resulted in 26 deaths, destroyed 2,448 homes, and burnt .

==== Victoria ====
In Victoria, the Victorian Premier can declare a state of emergency under the &quot;Public Safety Preservation Act 1958&quot; if there is a threat to employment, safety or public order. A declared state of emergency allows the Premier to immediately make any desired regulations to secure public order and safety. The declaration expires after 30 days, and a resolution of either the upper or lower House of Parliament may revoke it earlier. However, these regulations expire if Parliament does not agree to continue them within seven days.

The Premier (or a delegate) may operate or prohibit operation of any essential service, such as transport, fuel, power, water or gas, under the &quot;Essential Services Act 1958&quot;.

If there is an emergency which the Premier, after considering the advice of the relevant Minister and the Emergency Management Commissioner, is satisfied constitutes or is likely to constitute a significant and widespread danger to life or property in Victoria, the Premier, pursuant to the &quot;Emergency Management Act 1986&quot;, may declare a state of disaster to exist in the whole or in any part or parts of the State. The state of disaster addresses matters beyond public health issues and is intended to deal with emergencies such as natural disasters, explosions, terrorism or sieges, and it can also be used to deal with &#x27;a plague or an epidemic&#x27;.

The &quot;Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008&quot; gives the Chief Health Officer extensive powers to take action &#x27;to investigate, eliminate or reduce public health risks&#x27;, including power to detain, restrict the movement of or prevent entry of any person in the emergency area, &quot;and to give any other direction that the authorized officer considers is reasonably necessary to protect public health.&quot;

=== Brazil ===
The current constitution of Brazil allows the president to declare two states, in order to &quot;preserve or establish peace and order, threatened by grave and imminent institutional instability or severe natural disasters&quot;.

The first, and less severe state is the &quot;state of defense&quot; (&quot;estado de defesa&quot;, in Portuguese), while a more severe form is the &quot;state of siege&quot; (&quot;estado de sítio&quot;).

In a &quot;state of defense&quot;, the federal government can occupy and use any public building or demand any service as it sees fit. It may suppress secrecy of correspondence and freedom of assembly as necessary, as long as it specifies a defined region and time period.

If president finds the &quot;state of defense&quot; insufficient, it might decree a &quot;state of siege&quot;. This state further reduces civil liberties, removing freedom of movement, allowing for search without consent or warrant, and seizure of any assets the government deems necessary. The government may also intervene and direct the function of any company.

To balance this far-reaching powers, the National Congress of Brazil has to convene and approve the state in ten days or it is automatically cancelled. Further, the state of siege has to be revised by the congress every 30 days, unless it was raised as response to a war, in which case the government is free to set it to last until the end of the war.

Since the end of the military dictatorship in 1985, and the formation of the sixth Brazilian Republic, neither state has ever been raised.

=== Canada ===

The federal government of Canada can use the Emergencies Act to invoke a state of emergency. A national state of emergency automatically expires after 90 days, unless extended by the Governor-in-Council. There are different levels of emergencies: Public Welfare Emergency, Public Order Emergency, International Emergency, and War Emergency.

The Emergencies Act replaced the War Measures Act in 1988. The War Measures Act was invoked three times in Canadian history, most controversially by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau during the 1970 October Crisis, and also by Prime Minister Robert Borden during World War I (from 1914 to 1920, against threat of Communism during the Revolutions of 1917–1923) and by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King during World War II (from 1942 to 1945, against perceived threat from Japanese Canadians following Imperial Japan&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor).

Under the current Emergency Act a state of emergency can also be declared by provincial, territorial, and municipal governments. In addition Canada&#x27;s federal government and any of its provincial governments can suspend, for five years at a time, Charter rights to fundamental freedoms in section 2, to legal rights in sections 7 through 14, and to equality rights in section 15 by legislation which invokes the notwithstanding clause, section 33, and therefore emergency powers can effectively be created even without using the Emergency Act.

Provincial governments can also invoke states of emergency, and have done to respond to at least 12 incidents during the 21st century.

The first usage of the Emergencies Act was invoked by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on 14 February 2022 in response to the Freedom Convoy 2022 protests that occupied the capital of Ottawa. The Canadian House of Commons voted to approve the invocation 185–151 with support from the Liberal Party and the New Democratic Party and opposition from the Conservative Party and the Bloc Québécois. Prime Minister Trudeau previously considered invoking it at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, but faced unanimous disapproval from all thirteen provincial and territorial premiers at the Council of the Federation.

=== Egypt ===

Egyptians lived under an Emergency Law (Law No. 162 of 1958) from 1967 to 2012, except for an 18-month break in 1980 and 1981. The emergency was imposed during the Six-Day War, and reimposed following the assassination of President Anwar Sadat. The law was continuously extended every three years since 1981. Under the law, police powers were extended, constitutional rights suspended and censorship was legalized. The law sharply circumscribed any non-governmental political activity: street demonstrations, non-approved political organizations, and unregistered financial donations were formally banned. Some 17,000 people were detained under the law, and estimates of political prisoners run as high as 30,000. The emergency rule expired on 31 May 2012, and was put back in place in January 2013.

Following the 2013 coup d&#x27;état, the Egyptian interim president announced a one-month state of emergency across the country on 14 August 2013 and ordered the Egyptian Armed Forces to help the Interior Ministry enforce security. The announcement made on state TV followed deadly countrywide clashes between supporters of deposed President Mohamed Morsi and the security forces.

=== Ethiopia ===
A six-month state of emergency was issued by the Ethiopian government on 2 November 2021, following the rebel advance during the Tigray war, which went into effect 5 November 2021.

=== France ===
Three main provisions concern various kind of &quot;state of emergency&quot; in France: Article 16 of the Constitution of 1958 allows, in time of crisis, &quot;extraordinary powers&quot; to the president. Article 36 of the same constitution regulates &quot;state of siege&quot; (&quot;état de siège&quot;). Finally, the Act of 3 April 1955 allows the proclamation, by the Council of Ministers, of the &quot;state of emergency&quot; (&quot;état d&#x27;urgence&quot;). The distinction between article 16 and the 1955 Act concerns mainly the distribution of powers: whereas in article 16, the executive power basically suspend the regular procedures of the Republic, the 1955 Act permits a twelve-day state of emergency, after which a new law extending the emergency must be voted by the Parliament of France. These dispositions have been used at various times: three times during the Algerian War (in 1955, 1958 and 1961), in 1984 during violent pro-independence revolts in New Caledonia, during the 2005 riots, and following the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks. Since then, 9 years later on 15 May 2024, deadly riots have prompted France to declare a state of emergency in New Caledonia.

=== Germany ===

The Weimar Constitution (1919–1933) allowed states of emergency under Article 48 to deal with rebellions. Article 48 was often invoked during the 14-year life of the Weimar Republic, sometimes for no reason other than to allow the government to act when it was unable to obtain a parliamentary majority.

After 27 February 1933, Reichstag fire, an attack blamed on the communists, Adolf Hitler declared a state of emergency using Article 48, and then had President Paul von Hindenburg sign the Reichstag Fire Decree, which suspended some of the basic civil liberties provided by the Weimar Constitution (such as habeas corpus, freedom of expression, freedom of the speech, the freedom to assemble or the privacy of communications) for the whole duration of the Third Reich. On 23 March, the Reichstag enacted the Enabling Act of 1933 with the required two-thirds majority, which enabled Chancellor Adolf Hitler and his cabinet to enact laws without legislative participation. The Weimar Constitution was never actually repealed by Nazi Germany, but it effectively became inoperable after the passage of the Enabling Act. These two laws implemented the &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot;, the Nazis&#x27; institution of totalitarianism.

In the postwar Federal Republic of Germany the &quot;Emergency Acts&quot; state that some of the basic constitutional rights of the Basic Law may be limited in case of a State of Defence, a state of tension, or an internal state of emergency or disaster (catastrophe). These amendments to the constitution were passed on 30 May 1968, despite fierce opposition by the so-called &quot;extra-parliamentary opposition&quot; (see German student movement for details).

=== Hong Kong SAR (China) ===
During a state of war or turmoil which threatens national security or unity, and which the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress believes is beyond the control of the local government, the Standing Committee can invoke Article 18 of the Hong Kong Basic Law and declare a &quot;State of Emergency&quot; in Hong Kong; thus, the Central People&#x27;s Government can selectively implement national laws not normally allowed in Hong Kong. Deployment of troops from the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison under the &quot;Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on Garrisoning the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region&quot; can happen.

The Chief Executive of Hong Kong along with the Executive Council can prohibit public gatherings, issue curfew orders, prohibit the movement of vessels or aircraft, delegate authority, and other listed powers, under &quot;Cap. 245 Public Order Ordinance&quot;.

Although the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison may not interfere in internal Hong Kong affairs, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government may invoke Article 14 of the Hong Kong Basic Law and request permission of the Central People&#x27;s Government to have the garrison assist in &quot;maintenance of public order or disaster relief&quot;.

Since 1997, a State of Emergency has never been declared. However, emergency measures have been used in varying degrees over the years during British rule and after the establishment of the Special Administrative Region. A few notable mentions are as follow:
* Seamen&#x27;s strike of 1922 – Enactment of the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, 1922 within one day on 28 February 1922
* Canton-Hong Kong strike 1925 – with involvement of police and soldiers from multiple nations
* Anti-Japanese riot of 1931 – with involvement of Hong Kong Police and British Armed Forces
* Hong Kong 1956 riots – with involvement of British Armed Forces and Hong Kong Police
* Hong Kong 1966 riots – with involvement of British Armed Forces and Hong Kong Police
* Hong Kong 1967 Leftist Riots – with involvement of British Armed Forces and Hong Kong Police
* Hong Kong 1981 riots – with involvement of Hong Kong Police
* 2005 WTO Conference Protests – with involvement of Hong Kong Police and anti-globalization protesters led by Hong Kong People&#x27;s Alliance on WTO from 148 countries
* 2014 Hong Kong protests – with involvement of Hong Kong Police
* 2016 Mong Kok civil unrest – with involvement of Hong Kong Police
* 2019–20 Hong Kong protests – with involvement of Hong Kong Police

On 4 October 2019, Carrie Lam, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong S.A.R., invoked Section 2(1) of the Emergency Regulations Ordinance implemented since 1922 and last amended by the Legislative Council in 1999, which allow the government to implement the new, Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation. The new regulation forbid public assembly participants from wearing masks or obscure faces during such events without reasonable excuses. The permitted excuses are: pre-existing medical or health reasons, religious reasons, and if the person uses the face covering for physical safety while performing an activity connected with their profession or employment. Any person defying the new regulation face possible criminal prosecution. The government&#x27;s motive in doing so is to end months of social unrest and riots, however, did not declare a &quot;State of Emergency&quot;. The new regulation took effect at 00:00 HKT on 5 October 2019. Offenders risked a maximum of one-year imprisonment or a fine of HK$25,000 (US$3,200).

The High Court of Hong Kong denied an application for a judicial injunction of the anti-mask law, on the same night shortly before the new regulation took effect. A subsequent attempt by pro-democrats to halt the new regulation also failed, however, the court recommended a judicial review at a later date.

On 18 November 2019, the High Court ruled the &quot;Cap. 241 Emergency Regulations Ordinance&quot; is &quot;incompatible with the Basic Law&quot;, however, the court &quot;leaves open the question of the constitutionality of the ERO insofar as it relates to any occasion of emergency.&quot; The court also held the ordinance meets the &quot;prescribed by law&quot; requirement. However, the court deemed s3(1)(b), (c), (d) and s5 of the regulation do not meet the proportionality test as they impose restrictions on fundamental rights that goes beyond what is necessary in furthering its intended goals.

On 22 November 2019, the High Court made the following remark:Nevertheless, we recognize that our Judgment is only a judgment at first instance, and will soon be subject to an appeal to the Court of Appeal. In view of the great public importance of the issues raised in this case, and the highly exceptional circumstances that Hong Kong is currently facing, we consider it right that we should grant a short interim suspension order so that the respondents may have an opportunity to apply to the Court of Appeal, if so advised, for such interim relief as may be appropriate. Accordingly, we shall grant an interim temporary suspension order to postpone the coming into operation of the declarations of invalidity for a period of 7 days up to the end of 29 November 2019, with liberty to apply.On 26 November 2019, the High Court announced hearing for the government appeal against the judgement is on 9 January 2020.

On 27 November 2019, the Court of Appeal extended the interim suspension of the judgment until 10 December 2019.

On 10 December 2019, the Court of Appeal refused to suspend the &quot;unconstitutional&quot; ruling by the Court of First Instance on the anti-mask regulation. As scheduled, a full hearing will commence on 9 January 2020.

=== Hungary ===

According to the Hungarian Constitution, the National Assembly of Hungary can declare state of emergency in case of armed rebellion or natural or industrial disaster. It expires after 30 days, but can be extended. Most civil rights can be suspended, but basic human rights (such as the right to life, the ban of torture, and freedom of religion) cannot.

During state of emergency, the Parliament cannot be disbanded.

=== Iceland ===
The Icelandic constitution provides no mechanism for the declaration of war, martial law nor state of emergency.

=== India ===
The State of Emergency can be proclaimed by the President of India, when they perceive grave threats to the nation, albeit through the advice of the Union Council of Ministers. Part XVIII of the Constitution of India gives the President the power to overrule many provisions, including the ones guaranteeing fundamental rights to the citizens of India

In India, a state of emergency was declared twice:

# Between 26 October 1962 to 10 January 1968 during the Sino-Indian War—the security of India having been declared &quot;threatened by external aggression&quot;.
# Between 3 December 1971 to 21 March 1977 originally proclaimed during the Indo-Pakistani War, and later extended on 25 June 1975, along with the third proclamation—the security of India having been declared &quot;threatened by external aggression&quot; and by &quot;internal disturbances&quot;.

The first internal State of Emergency, popularly known as the Emergency, was declared by the then President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed on advice of then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi. The provisions of the Constitution allows the Prime Minister to rule by decree.

=== Ireland ===
In Ireland declaring a state of &quot;national emergency&quot; involves Article 28.3.3° of the 1937 Constitution of Ireland, which states that:
In addition, during a &quot;war or armed rebellion&quot;, military tribunals may try civilians, and the Defence Forces are not bound by habeas corpus.

The First Amendment of the Constitution of 1939 allows an emergency to be declared during wars in which the state is a non-belligerent, subject to resolutions by the houses of the Oireachtas. By the 2nd Amendment of 1941, an emergency ends, not automatically when the war does, but only by Oireachtas resolutions. The 21st Amendment of 2002 prevents the reintroduction of capital punishment during an emergency.

The first amendment was rushed through the Oireachtas after the outbreak of the Second World War, in which the state remained neutral. Immediately after, the required resolution was passed, in turn enabling the passage of the Emergency Powers Act 1939 (EPA), which granted the government and its ministers sweeping powers to issue statutory orders termed &quot;Emergency Powers Orders&quot; (EPOs). (The period in Ireland was and is referred to as &quot;The Emergency&quot;.) The EPA expired in 1946, although some EPOs were continued under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act 1946 until as late as 1957. Rationing continued until 1951.

The 1939 state of emergency was not formally ended until a 1976 resolution, which also declared a new state of emergency in relation to the Troubles in Northern Ireland and in particular the recent assassination of the British ambassador to Ireland, Christopher Ewart Biggs. The Emergency Powers Act 1976 was then passed to increase the Garda Síochána powers to arrest, detain, and question those suspected of offences against the state. President Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh referred the bill under Article 26 of the Constitution to the Supreme Court, which upheld its constitutionality. The referral was condemned by minister Paddy Donegan as a &quot;thundering disgrace&quot;, causing Ó Dálaigh to resign in protest. The 1976 EPA expired after one year, but the state of emergency persisted until 1995, when as part of the Northern Ireland peace process it was rescinded as a &quot;confidence building measure&quot; to satisfy physical force republicans after the Provisional IRA&#x27;s 1994 ceasefire.

The Offences against the State Act does not require a state of emergency under Article 28.3.3°. Part V of the Act, which provides for a non-jury Special Criminal Court (SCC), is permitted under Article 38.3.1°. Part V is activated by a declaration from the government that it is &quot;necessary to secure the preservation of public peace and order&quot;, and it can be rescinded by vote of Dáil Éireann. Provision for internment is similarly activated and rescinded (originally by Part VI of the 1939 act, later by Part II of a 1940 amending act). Parts V and VI were both activated during the Second World War and the IRA&#x27;s late 1950s Border Campaign; Part V has been continually active since 1972.

Several official reviews of the Constitution and the Offences Against the State Acts have recommended a time limit within which the operation of Article 28.3.3° or Article 38.3.1° must either be explicitly renewed by resolution or else lapse.

=== Israel ===
The Israeli state of emergency, authorized by the Emergency Defence Regulations, is older than the state itself, having been passed under the British Mandate for Palestine in 1945. A repeal was briefly considered in 1967 but cancelled following the Six-Day War. The regulations allow Israel, through its military, to control movements and prosecute suspected terrorists in occupied territories, and to censor publications that are deemed prejudicial to national defense.

=== Italy ===
In Italy, the state of emergency planned by the legal system is implemented by the Council of Ministers, without the need of a parliamentary vote, due to the Law n. 225 of 1992 on Civil Protection. Moreover, the Article 120 of the Constitution provides that the government can exercise &quot;substitute powers&quot; of local authorities in typically situations: to protect the legal or economic unity of the state, in case of violation of supranational laws and to face a serious danger for safety and public safety. For other emergency, such as a war, a parliamentary vote is required to give extraordinary powers to the government.

The Parliament of Italy can also give extraordinary powers to the government in case of health emergency, as it occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when the Parliament approved a state of emergency from 31 January 2020 to 31 December 2021, thanks to what the government can implement administrative acts, without the approval of the Parliament.

=== Macau SAR (China) ===
The Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress can declare a state of emergency and deploy troops from the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Macau Garrison under the Article 14 of Macau&#x27;s Basic Law on the defence of the Macau Special Administrative Region.

Since 1999 no emergency measure have been enacted. Prior to 1999 emergency measures have been used for 1 major incident:
* 12-3 incident (1966) – with martial law invoked and involvement of Portuguese troops

=== Malaysia ===

In Malaysia, if the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (Monarch) is satisfied that a grave emergency exists whereby the security, or the economic life, or public order in the Federation or any part thereof is threatened, he may issue a Proclamation of Emergency making therein a declaration to that effect.

A state of emergency was declared by the then-colonial government of Britain from 1948 until 1960 to deal with an insurgency of communists led by Chin Peng.

States of emergency were also declared during the &quot;Konfrontasi&quot; in 1962, the 1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis and the 1977 Kelantan Emergency.

When a race riot broke out on 13 May 1969, a state of emergency was declared.

Amid severe haze on 11 August 2005, a state of emergency was announced for the world&#x27;s 13th-largest port, Port Klang and the district of Kuala Selangor after air pollution there reached dangerous levels (defined as a value greater than 500 on the Air Pollution Index or API).

Thierry Rommel, the European Commission&#x27;s envoy to Malaysia, told Reuters by telephone on 13 November 2007 (the last day of his mission) that, &quot;Today, this country still lives under (a state of) emergency.&quot; Although not officially proclaimed as a state of emergency, the Emergency Ordinance and the Internal Security Act had allowed detention for years without trial.

On 23 June 2013, a state of emergency was declared by government for Muar and Ledang, Johor as severe Southeast Asian haze that pushed the air pollution index to above 750. This was the first time in years that air quality had dipped to a hazardous level with conditions worsening as dry weather persisted and fires raged in Sumatra.

On 12 January 2021, a nationwide state of emergency was declared by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Abdullah of Pahang in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia, at the request of Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin. The state of emergency is planned to end on 1 August 2021. The declaration included the suspension of parliament and elections, and came amid political instability. On 25 February 2021, Yang di-Pertuan Agong announced that the parliament can be convened during the state of emergency.

=== Maldives ===

A state of emergency was declared on 26 December 2004, following the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami. The resulting tsunamis caused extensive damage to the country&#x27;s infrastructure, cutting off communications from large swathes of the nation, decimating islands and forcing the closure of a number of resorts due to the damage.

On 5 February 2018, a state of emergency was declared by Maldives&#x27;s President Abdulla Yameen for 15 days and ordered security forces into the Supreme Court of the Maldives and arrested former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and the Chief Justice of the Maldives.

=== Namibia ===
Namibia last declared a state of emergency due to an ongoing drought in 2016.

=== New Zealand ===
The Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 gives the New Zealand Government and local-body councils the power to issue a state of emergency, either over the entire country or within a specific region. This may suspend ordinary work and essential services if need be. States of emergency in New Zealand expire on the commencement of the seventh day after the date of a declaration unless extended. However, the Minister of Civil Defence or a local mayor may lift a state of emergency after an initial review of a region&#x27;s status.
* In 1951, the First National Government issued emergency regulations in response to that year&#x27;s waterfront dispute.
* On 23 February 2011 at 11.28 am the Minister of Civil Defence John Carter declared the first state of national emergency (for a civil-defence emergency) in New Zealand&#x27;s history in response to the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. A local state of emergency was declared by mayors of Christchurch City, Selwyn District and Waimakariri District following 4 September 2010 Canterbury earthquake.
* On 25 March 2020 at 12.21 pm, the Minister for Civil Defense Peeni Henare declared a state of national emergency in response to the total cases of COVID-19 reaching 205. Combined with an epidemic notice issued under the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006, the state of emergency declaration enabled authorities to close most premises in New Zealand and enforce a nationwide lockdown. This also provided access to special powers to combat COVID-19, including powers of requisition and closing roads and restricting movement. Director of Civil Defence Emergency Management Sarah Stuart-Black said these powers sat alongside other powers to ensure essential services could stay up and running. The state of national emergency was renewed four times, to last for a total of five weeks.
* On 14 February 2023 at 8:43 am, the Minister for Civil Defense Kieran McAnulty declared a state of national emergency in response to Cyclone Gabrielle reaching New Zealand and causing flooding and evacuations.

=== Nigeria ===
In Nigeria, a state of emergency is usually declared in times of great civil unrest. In recent years, it has specifically been implemented in reaction to terrorist attacks on Nigerians by the Islamic terrorist group Boko Haram.

On 14 May 2013, Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency for the entire northeastern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa. A more limited state of emergency had been declared on 31 December 2011 in parts of Yobe, Borno, Plateau and Niger states. This earlier declaration included the temporary shutdown of the international borders in those regions.

=== Pakistan ===

In Pakistan, a state of emergency was declared five times in its history:
* In 1958 by President Iskander Mirza
* In 1969 by President General Yahya Khan
* In 1977 by President General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq
* In 1998 by President Muhammad Rafiq Tarar
* In 2007 by President General Pervez Musharraf

The first three were regarded as the imposition of direct martial law.

=== Philippines ===
There are several situations that calls for various levels of government action in the Philippines. The constitution alludes to these:
* State of war: Declared by Manuel L. Quezon in 1941 after the United States&#x27; entry during World War II and lead to its occupation by Japanese forces.
* State of martial law: Six declarations in history (1896, 1898, 1944–45, 1972–1981, 2009 and 2017–2019)

These are not specified in the constitution, but were nevertheless declared at least once:
* State of rebellion: Last declared in 2003 due to the Oakwood mutiny
* State of emergency: Last two declarations were in 2006 and 2016–2023.
* State of public health emergency: Last declared in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines.
* State of calamity: Last national declaration was in 2020–21 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines and later, the outbreak of African swine fever virus in several provinces and regions of the country, as well as Super Typhoon Odette (Rai). Local governments are also permitted to declare local states of calamity in their areas hit by natural and man-made disasters.

=== Portugal ===

The current Constitution of Portugal empowers the President of the Republic to declare a state of siege () or a state of emergency () in part or the entirety of the Portuguese territory, only in cases of actual or imminent aggression by foreign forces, serious threats to or disturbances of the democratic constitutional order, or public disasters.

Such declarations allow the entities that exercise sovereignty from suspending the exercise of some of the constitutionally defined rights, freedoms and guarantees, so that the public authorities can take the appropriate and strictly necessary measures for the prompt restoration of constitutional normality; the Constitution, however, sets a temporal limit for these states of emergency (no more than fifteen days, even though renewal is possible) and forbids any suspension of the right to life, to personal integrity, to personal identity, to civil capacity and citizenship, the non-retroactivity of criminal law, the right to a fair trial, or the freedom of conscience and religion. They also may not affect the constitutionally-defined competences and mode of operation of the entities that exercise sovereignty. The Assembly of the Republic may not be dissolved while a state of siege or a state of emergency is in force, nor can the Constitution itself be subject to amendment.

Before declaring a state of siege or a state of emergency, the President is required to consult with the Government and request authorisation to do so from the Assembly of the Republic.

During the Third Portuguese Republic, the only two times such states of exceptional suppression of constitutional provisions were declared were during the failed left-wing coup d&#x27;état of 25 November 1975 (state of siege, within the confines of the Lisbon Military Region), and during the COVID-19 pandemic (state of emergency, in the entirety of the Portuguese territory).

Within the remit of the basic law of civil protection services (), the prime minister can, through a Resolution of the Council of Ministers and without the need of parliamentary approval or presidential promulgation, decree a situation of calamity (). Lesser exceptional statuses, the situation of contingency () and the situation of alert () in descending order of importance, can also be set in motion by other civil protection authorities or Mayors. These three situations allow for some extraordinary measures and special restrictions, but not the suspension of constitutional rights and freedoms.

=== Poland ===
In Poland, the institution of the state of emergency was absorbed by the institution of martial law in the years 1952–1983 in the constitutional regulations. According to the provisions of the Constitution of 1997 (Articles 228 et seq.), A state of emergency may be introduced by the president at the request of the Council of Ministers for a specified period of time, but not longer than 90 days, in part or throughout the territory of the country, if the security of the state, the security of citizens or public order has been threatened. The President may extend this state only once (for a period not longer than 60 days) with the consent of the Sejm. During the state of emergency and within 90 days from its end, the Constitution and electoral regulations may not be changed, and the Sejm may not be dissolved; there are also no national elections or referendums. In the event of the expiry of the term of office of the President, the Sejm and the Senate, or local self-government bodies, they are appropriately extended.

=== Romania ===

In Romania, there are two types of states of emergency, each designed for a different type of situation.
* State of alert (&quot;Stare de alertă&quot; in Romanian): Non-military, can be enforced by a prefect. Roadblocks are enforced. Any utilitarian vehicle or equipment can be temporarily used by the state, without any restriction. Evacuation is not mandatory, unless extreme circumstances apply. Only EMS, Police and firefighting personnel are required to intervene. This situation can be enforced in case of natural disasters or civil unrest.
* State of emergency (&quot;stare de urgentă&quot; in Romanian): Can only be enforced by the President of Romania with approval from Parliament. The military becomes the upper form of control in the country (under the rule of the president). The civilian population is subject to strict regulations, imposed by the type of emergency. All private and public non-crucial activities are suspended. Essential services might be disrupted. This situation can be enforced in case of extreme circumstances, such as a war.
* Special zone of public safety (&quot;Zonă specială de siguranță publică&quot; in Romanian): Administrative, can be enforced by local police. This implies installation of road check-points and higher numbers in police and gendarmes/ riot police presence, patrolling the area. There is also a ban that restricts the right to travel for people in the area; any vehicle and individual transiting the zone are subject to screening.

The most well-known event in which the state of emergency has been enforced was because of 1977 Vrancea earthquake.

The last instance in which the &quot;special zone of public safety&quot; was enforced was on 8 December 2013, in Pungești, Vaslui following civil unrest in Pungești from Chevron&#x27;s plans to begin exploring shale-gas in the village. According to police officials, the special security zone will be maintained as long as there is conflict in the area that poses a threat to Chevron&#x27;s operations. This special security zone has faced domestic and international criticism for alleged human-rights abuses.

=== Russia ===
=== Sierra Leone ===
Sierra Leone declared, on 7 February 2019, a State of Emergency due to ongoing rape and sexual violence in the country. On 24 March 2020, a 12-month state of emergency was declared by (Rtd) Brigadier Julius Madaa Bio due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Singapore===
Article 150(1) of the Constitution of Singapore allows the President of Singapore to declare a state of emergency in the event of a security or economic threat and must notify Parliament as soon as practicable under Article 150(3). A state of emergency would last for six months under Article 150(6). With the repeal of the Emergency (Essential Powers) Act in 2021, only the powers granted by the Constitution are allowed to be exercised in an event of an emergency.

====Special Emergency Powers (1964-2021)====
When Singapore was in Malaysia, the Malaysian Federation declared a State of Emergency in September 1964. It conferred upon the Federal King special powers during a State of Emergency such as creating offenses and prescribing penalties among others. When Singapore gained independence in 1965, that ordinance was enacted as the Emergency (Essential Powers) Act conferring those powers on the President. These powers were repealed effective the 1st day of March 2021.

====History of Emergency====
In response to the Malayan Communist Party (MCP)&#x27;s murder of three British planters in Perak on 16th June 1948, Sir Edward Gent, the British High Commissioner of Malaya declared a State of Emergency to the whole of Perak and Johore. This emergency was extended to the whole of Malaya on the 18th of June, and six days later, Singapore came under a State of Emergency. The emergency officially ended on 31st July 1960, 12 years since its declaration, and when Singapore was a self-governing state rather than a colony during which the emergency was imposed in the first place. 

The subsequent time Singapore experienced a State of Emergency was when it was declared in 1964, when race riots broke out in July and in September. This time, Singapore was a state in the Malaysian Federation. Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman declared a State of Emergency under the provisions of the Malaysian Constitution. This was the period when Ordinance 30 of 1964 was enacted conferring upon the Federal King special powers. This ordinance would become known as the Emergency (Essential Powers) Act and would be adopted by Singapore when it gained independence. The Act would remain in force for close to 57 years, until 2021.

While the British and the Malaysian Federal authorities have declared a State of Emergency in Singapore, no Singaporean government, thus far, has declared a State of Emergency since the country&#x27;s independence in 1965. This is due to the Singaporean government&#x27;s reliance on the Internal Security Act of 1960 and other targeted legislation to deal with security threats.

=== South Africa ===

States of emergency in South Africa are governed by section 37 of the Constitution and by the State of Emergency Act, 1997. The president may declare a state of emergency only when &quot;the life of the nation is threatened by war, invasion, general insurrection, disorder, natural disaster or other public emergency&quot; and if the ordinary laws and government powers are not sufficient to restore peace and order. The declaration is made by proclamation in the &quot;Government Gazette&quot; and may only apply from the time of publication, not retroactively. It can only continue for 21 days unless the National Assembly grants an extension, which may be for at most three months at a time. The High Courts have the power, subject to confirmation by the Constitutional Court, to determine the validity of the declaration of a state of emergency.

During a state of emergency the President of South Africa has the power to make emergency regulations &quot;necessary or expedient&quot; to restore peace and order and end the emergency. This power can be delegated to other authorities. Emergency measures can violate the Bill of Rights, but only to a limited extent. Some rights are inviolable, including amongst others the rights to life and to human dignity; the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of race, sex or religion; the prohibition of torture or inhumane punishment; and the right of accused people to a fair trial. Any violation of a constitutional right must be strictly required by the emergency. Emergency measures may not indemnify the government or individuals for illegal actions. They may impose criminal penalties, but not exceeding three years&#x27; imprisonment. They may not require military service beyond that required by the ordinary laws governing the defence force. An emergency measure may be disapproved by the National Assembly, in which case it lapses, and no emergency measure may interfere with the elections, powers or sittings of Parliament or the provincial legislatures. The courts have the power to determine the validity of any emergency measure.

The constitution places strict limits on any detention without trial during a state of emergency. A friend or family member of the detainee must be informed, and the name and place of detention must be published in the &quot;Government Gazette&quot;. The detainee must have access to a doctor and a legal representative. The detainee must be brought before a court within at most ten days, for the court to determine whether the detention is necessary, and if not released may demand repeated review every ten days. At the court review the detainee must be allowed legal representation and must be allowed to appear in person. The provisions on detention without trial do not apply to prisoners of war in an international conflict; instead they must be treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions and other international law.

=== Spain ===
In Spain, there are three degrees of state of emergency (&quot;estado de emergencia&quot; in Spanish): &quot;alarma&quot; (alarm or alert), &quot;excepción&quot; (exception[al circumstance]) and &quot;sitio&quot; (siege). They are named by the constitution, which limits which rights may be suspended, but regulated by the &quot;Ley Orgánica 4/1981&quot; (Organic Law).

On 4 December 2010, the first state of alert was declared following the air traffic controllers strike. It was the first time since the Francisco Franco&#x27;s regime that a state of emergency was declared. The second state of alert was declared on 14 March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The third state of alert was declared before the end of October 2020 given the difficulties to control the spread of said pandemic.

=== Sri Lanka ===
In Sri Lanka, the president is able to proclaim emergency regulations under the &quot;Public Security Ordinance&quot; in the constitution in order to preserve public security and public order; suppression of mutiny, riot or civil commotion; or maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community. These regulations last for one month unless confirmed otherwise by Parliament.

=== Switzerland ===
According to Art. 185 of the Swiss Federal Constitution The Federal Council (Bundesrat) can call up in their own competence military personnel of maximum 4000 militia for three weeks to safeguard inner or outer security (called Federal Intervention or Federal Execution, respectively). A larger number of soldiers or of a longer duration is subject to parliamentary decision. For deployments within Switzerland the principle of subsidiarity rules: as a first step, unrest has to be overcome with the aid of cantonal police units.

=== Syria ===
An emergency prevailed in Syria from 1963, following the Ba&#x27;athist coup d&#x27;état, to 2011. Originally predicated on the conflict with Israel, the emergency acted to centralize authority in the presidency and the national security apparatus while silencing public dissent. The emergency was terminated in response to protests that preceded the Syrian Civil War. Under the 2012 constitution, the president may pass an emergency decree with a 2/3 concurrence of his ministers, provided that he presents it to the People&#x27;s Assembly for constitutional review.

=== Trinidad and Tobago ===

Sections 7 though 12 of the Constitution set out the legal basis for declaring that a state of emergency exists. The president, under the advice of the prime minister, may make a proclamation that a &quot;state of public emergency&quot; exists if:

* &quot;A public emergency has arisen as a result of the imminence of a state of war between Trinidad and Tobago and a foreign state,
* A public emergency has arisen as a result of the occurrence of any earthquake, hurricane, flood, fire, outbreak of pestilence or of infectious disease, or other calamity whether similar to the foregoing or not,
* Action has been taken, or is immediately threatened, by any person, of such a nature and on so extensive a scale, as to be likely to endanger the public safety or to deprive the community or any substantial portion of the community of supplies or services essential to life.&quot; (ss. 8 (2)).

Upon declaring that a state of emergency exists, the President may make regulations to deal with the situation at hand. The regulations can even infringe upon the rights enshrined within sections 4 and 5 of the Constitution (e.g. freedom of speech, freedom of movement, etc.) but only to such extent as such constitutional encroachments are &quot;reasonably justifiable for the purpose of dealing with the situation that exists during that period.&quot; (ss. 7 (3)). Once the President has declared that a state of emergency exists, the initial duration of that proclamation is 15 days, unless revoked sooner. The state of emergency can then be extended for up to three months by a simple majority vote of the House of Representatives and can be extended by a further three months by a three-fifths majority vote of the House of Representatives and must also be passed in the Senate.

A state of emergency was declared in 1970 during the Black Power Revolution by then Prime Minister Eric Williams. During the attempted state coup by the Jamaat al Muslimeen against the NAR government of the then Prime Minister A. N. R. Robinson in 1990, a state of emergency was declared during the coup attempt and for a period after the coup.

On 4 August 1995, a state of emergency was declared to remove the Speaker of the House Occah Seapaul by Prime Minister Patrick Manning during a constitutional crisis. The government had attempted to remove the speaker via a no-confidence motion, which failed. The state of emergency was used to remove the speaker using the emergency powers granted.

On 22 August 2011 at 8:00 pm, Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar announced a state of emergency in an attempt to crack down on the trafficking of illegal drugs and firearms, in addition to gangs. The decision of the President, George Maxwell Richards, to issue the proclamation for the state of emergency was debated in the country&#x27;s Parliament as required by the Constitution on 2 September 2011 and passed by the required simple majority of the House of Representatives.

=== Turkey ===

Since the foundation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 the military conducted three &quot;coups d&#x27;état&quot; and announced martial law. Martial law between 1978 and 1983 was replaced by a state of emergency that lasted until November 2002.
The latest state of emergency was declared by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on 20 July 2016 following a failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016 by a faction of the country&#x27;s armed forces. It was lifted on 18 July 2018.

=== United Kingdom ===

In the United Kingdom, only the British Sovereign, on the advice of the Privy Council, or a Minister of the Crown in exceptional circumstances, has the power to introduce emergency regulations under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, in case of an emergency, broadly defined as war or attack by a foreign power, terrorism which poses a threat of serious damage to the security of the UK, or events which threaten serious damage to human welfare or the environment of a place in the UK. The duration of these regulations is limited to thirty days, but may be extended by Parliament.
A state of emergency was last invoked in 1974 by Prime Minister Edward Heath in response to increasing industrial action.

The act grants wide-ranging powers to central and local government in the event of an emergency. It allows the modification of primary legislation by emergency regulation, with the exception of the Human Rights Act 1998 and Part 2 of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004.

=== United States ===

The United States Constitution implicitly provides some emergency powers in the article about the executive power:
* Congress may authorize the government to call forth the militia to execute the laws, suppress an insurrection or repel an invasion.
* Congress may authorize the government to suspend consideration of writs of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; &quot;when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.&quot;
* Felony charges may be brought without presentment or grand jury indictment in cases arising &quot;in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger.&quot;
* A state government may engage in war without Congress&#x27;s approval if &quot;actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.&quot;

Aside from these, many provisions of law exist in various jurisdictions, which take effect only upon an executive declaration of emergency; some 500 federal laws take effect upon a presidential declaration of emergency. The National Emergencies Act regulates this process at the federal level. It requires the President to specifically identify the provisions activated and to renew the declaration annually so as to prevent an arbitrarily broad or open-ended emergency.
Presidents have occasionally taken action justified as necessary or prudent because of a state of emergency, only to have the action struck down in court as unconstitutional.

A state governor or local mayor may declare a state of emergency within their jurisdiction. This is common at the state level in response to natural disasters. The Federal Emergency Management Agency maintains a system of assets, personnel and training to respond to such incidents. For example, on 10 December 2015, Washington state Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency due to flooding and landslides caused by heavy rains.

The 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act allows the government to freeze assets, limit trade and confiscate property in response to an &quot;unusual and extraordinary threat&quot; to the United States that originates substantially outside of it. As of 2015 more than twenty emergencies under the IEEPA remain active regarding various subjects, the oldest of which was declared in 1979 with regard to the government of Iran. Another ongoing national emergency, declared after the September 11 attacks, authorizes the president to retain or reactivate military personnel beyond their normal term of service.

In 2020, it was common for states to enact a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Because the Defense Resources Act contain numerous Titles or individual national emergency laws, it provides an important framework. In American film and popular culture, American views on what to expect during national emergencies can include prominent Cold War television programs such as &quot;The Day After&quot;, which aired on ABC in November 1983.

Officials under President Ronald Reagan briefed Congress on the Act in 1983. The briefing explained several emergency actions Congress might approve in a grave national crisis such as the nuclear war scare depicted in The Day After. Upon approval by Congress, the Act would have authorized the president to issue orders putting forth wage and price controls, censorship and commandeering of private property. The present legal status of these matters is not clear.

<text>Johnny the Homicidal Maniac (often abbreviated JtHM) is the first comic book by Jhonen Vasquez. The series tells the story of a young man named Johnny “Nny” C. as he explores the psychological and possibly supernatural forces which compel him to commit a string of murders with which he always seems to get away. &quot;JtHM&quot; began as a comic strip in the 1990s, then ran under alternative comics publisher Slave Labor Graphics as a limited series of seven issues, later collected in the trade paperback &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac: Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;. The series produced three spin-offs: &quot;Squee!&quot;, &quot;I Feel Sick&quot; and &quot;Fillerbunny&quot;.

==Creation==
Vasquez started drawing in kindergarten. He attended Mount Pleasant High School, where he took a part in a contest to design the cardinal as a school&#x27;s mascot. Vasquez submitted an entry, but the judges rejected it. On the back of a preliminary drawing for the contest, he drew his first sketch of the character he would later name Johnny C. Vasquez&#x27;s high school&#x27;s student newspaper published a number of comic strips titled &quot;Johnny the Little Homicidal Maniac&quot;. Vasquez says the character originated as a personal avatar who could carry out his own revenge fantasies. Comic book artist and filmmaker Rob Schrab makes the same observation. However, Vasquez later distanced himself from the character, saying that Johnny should not be mistaken for an author surrogate. Vasquez also created Happy Noodle Boy while attending Mount Pleasant as a way to stop his girlfriend from asking him to draw comics for her.

In the early 1990s, &quot;Carpe Noctem&quot;, a magazine about the goth subculture, published several one-page strips featuring Johnny, now called &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot;. Though he never planned to create comic books, Vasquez submitted samples of his artwork to alternative comics publisher Slave Labor Graphics. Between August 1995 and January 1997, the publisher released a series of seven full-length issues based on the character. Vasquez describes the production process for &quot;Johnny&quot; as a &quot;mess&quot; and a &quot;spew&quot;. As Vasquez worked on the comic, he prepared less and less, foregoing outlines and sketches and writing dialogue as he inked. Vasquez wishes that he had taken more time to plan the series, and feels that the quality of the dialogue suffered from his haphazard approach.

A photograph of one of Vasquez&#x27;s friends, Leah England, serves as the middle of a portrait collection on the cover of the second issue of &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot;. England also gave Vasquez the inspiration for a filler strip about a child who was dangerously afraid of losing sight of his mother, as well as the &quot;Meanwhile...&quot; strip in the second issue. The two were discussing an event that had happened to a cheerleader, and thinking up the worst excuse possible.

Jhonen based Psychodoughboy and Mr. Eff on two real Styrofoam Pillsbury Doughboy display figures that he found and painted. He created Nailbunny as he was drawing the first page on which the character appears. Vasquez modeled for himself while drawing the characters.

Vasquez intended a tapeworm named Scolex to be one of Johnny&#x27;s voices, but the character never made it into the finished series. Vasquez now uses Chancre Scolex as a pen name for &quot;Everything Can Be Beaten&quot; and his LiveJournal.

Like many alternative comics, and other Slave Labor Graphics titles, &quot;Johnny&quot; is creator-owned. By September 1996, Vasquez announced in his introduction to the sixth issue of &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot; that he had reached sufficient success in his artistic career to be able to quit his day-job and devote himself full-time to his art.

As his comics moved from dedicated comic book shops into shopping malls, Vasquez bemoaned the attendant change in his audience. Vasquez created his own animated series &quot;Invader Zim&quot;, and became uncomfortable with younger fans of &quot;Zim&quot; reading &quot;Johnny&quot;, because of the violence depicted.

==&quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;==

&quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac: Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, a trade paperback released by Slave Labor Graphics in July 1997, collected the series. Slave Labor also released a hardcover version of the collection. Rob Schrab provides a foreword. The trade paperback includes a &quot;Gallery of Ancient Horrors&quot; that features a few strips previously published in the Mount Pleasant High School newspaper and &quot;Carpe Noctem&quot;, as well as some strips previously unpublished, all with commentary by Vasquez. The paperback also introduces some new supplementary materials such as sketches, an issue-by-issue synopsis, character profiles, and a fictional interview with Vasquez, but leaves out many of the filler strips from the original series.

The cover of the trade paperback features the logo &quot;Z?&quot;, meaning &quot;question sleep&quot;. &quot;Z?&quot; appears frequently throughout Vasquez&#x27;s work and Question Sleep is the name of his official website. &quot;Z?&quot; is a reference to insomnia, a condition from which several of his characters suffer.

==Spin-offs==
&quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot; spawned two spin-offs: a four-issue series titled &quot;Squee!&quot;, and a double-shot titled &quot;I Feel Sick&quot;. The trade paperback release of &quot;Squee!&quot;, titled &quot;Squee&#x27;s Wonderful Big Giant Book of Unspeakable Horrors&quot;, includes the filler strips left out of &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;. Johnny makes cameo appearances at the end of &quot;Squee!&quot; and in the second issue of &quot;I Feel Sick&quot;. Vasquez also maintains a Twitter account from the perspective of Johnny.

==Style==
The comic is high-contrast black and white with stylized and geometric cartoon characters. Graphical perspective is often very loose. The panel borders are jagged, and certain strips have messages hidden in the complex designs of the borders. Many of the characters are thin nearly to the point of being stick figures. Several of the characters, including Johnny, wear T-shirts with expressive messages that change from panel to panel. Vasquez often breaks the fourth wall with side comments to talk about the book, its audience, or himself. The speech balloons change with the moods of the characters. For example, Johnny&#x27;s word balloons grow thorns when he becomes angry.

==Main characters==
===Johnny &quot;Nny&quot; C.===
The series focuses on Johnny C., a man who elaborately slaughters anyone who irritates him. He drains his victims of blood to paint over a wall in his house to prevent a monster from escaping. He is and . He likes stars, the emotionless function of insects, watching people get abducted by aliens, Cherry &#x27;FizWiz&#x27;, Cherry &#x27;Brain-Freezies&#x27;, all kinds of movies, Fruity Pops, the moon, little chubby babies, pop rocks and soda, and drawing Happy Noodle Boy. He dislikes humidity, sleep, the physical and mental need for &quot;anything&quot;, being abducted by aliens, people who&#x27;ve &quot;GOTTA HAVE A SMOKE!&quot;, certain words (such as &quot;wacky&quot;), losing his mind, Satan&#x27;s attitude and getting shot in the head (or just using a gun in general).

Minus a tongue-in-cheek passage describing Johnny&#x27;s origins stemming from the murder of his parents by an &quot;evil man&quot;, his backstory and life before the events of the comic are deliberately kept vague.

Todd Casil (known as &quot;Squee&quot; due to the noise that he makes when frightened) is a young boy who lives in the house next to Johnny. Neither of his parents care for him, especially his father, who works countless hours at a dead end job and leads a miserable life after raising Squee. While his parents are not outright abusive or even neglectful, his mother is heavily implied to be a drug addict of some sort, and his father has no qualms blaming Squee for all of his own personal failures, a trait Johnny picked up on and seemingly detests--Johnny thus becomes a sort of &quot;guardian&quot; for Squee, offering to blind his father for revenge, and saving him from a child molester. Despite this, Squee seems to be the only main human character aside from Johnny who is aware of his crimes, and thus is deathly afraid of him. Squee&#x27;s only friend is a small teddy bear named Shmee. Shmee tells Squee in a dream that he is a &quot;trauma sponge&quot;, all of his fears and nightmares are &quot;contained&quot; in Shmee. Squee is also friends with Satan&#x27;s son, with whom he attends school. Squee has his own series called &quot;Squee!&quot;, which was later collected in the TPB Squee&#x27;s &quot;Wonderful Big Giant Book Of Unspeakable Horrors&quot;.

==Setting==
The series is set in the mid-1990s in an unspecified, fictional city. Decaying urban streets, shadowed back alleys and filthy convenience stores serve as the series’ backdrop. Crumbling and covered with litter and graffiti, everything is in a state of bleak decay, overlit by the neon signs of trashy consumer capitalism.

Johnny lives in a decrepit, single-story house with the street address 777. The house has an extensive labyrinth of tunnels underneath. Johnny uses the subterranean rooms as dungeons and torture chambers, as well as a storage place for corpses, though he also buries the remains of his victims. The tunnels also provide him with a network to various locations, such as his neighbor Squee&#x27;s residence. Johnny perceives the layout of the house as constantly changing, though he does not state if this shifting is the result of the supernatural forces at work within the house or his own psychosis, though in a later issue, when two of his prisoners escape, it is revealed that the house is, in fact, a supernatural entity that does not obey the laws of physics. Johnny states that he found the house and moved in some time ago. He also constructed an unidentified flying object landing pad on the roof. Throughout the series, there is no case where the authorities or the police are looking for Johnny, and they seem unaware of his existence.

A later part of the story takes place in the afterlife. After accidentally shooting himself, Johnny journeys first to Heaven and then to Hell, and both turn out to have more in common with Earth than he expected.

==Synopsis==
The story is told in vignettes that reflect Johnny&#x27;s disjointed mental state. Vasquez leaves unexplained which events in the story are objective and which are subjective, and provides no back-story about Johnny&#x27;s origins.

The series begins when a boy named Todd (later nicknamed Squee by Johnny, for the noises he makes when scared) wakes in the middle of the night to find Johnny in the bathroom of his family&#x27;s new house. After a confrontation with Squee&#x27;s teddy bear, Shmee, Johnny leaves, informing Squee that they are neighbors. Later, Johnny goes on a rampage with a spork in a &quot;Taco Hell&quot; restaurant, incited by an elderly patron referring to him as &quot;wacky&quot;. Following the slaughter, Johnny watches its coverage on the news. Later, Johnny captures and kills a patient and calm man named Edgar Vargas after discussing with the philosophy of murder with him, as well as explaining his mysterious need to collect blood to paint a wall in his house, and later kills a beautiful woman after contemplating over their &quot;internal ugliness&quot;. He goes on a date with Devi, a cashier, and has a mental breakdown where he attempts to stab and kill her when he gives into his fear of losing his happiness, but Devi brutally beats Johnny and escapes. Sometime afterward, he kills everyone in his least favorite coffee shop, and kills a convenience store clerk over the inability to purchase a slushee. Johnny realizes there may be a supernatural force preventing him from being brought to justice for his murders. He and the sentient floating head, &quot;Nailbunny&quot;, journey through the seemingly endless basement of his house and discuss the nature of Johnny&#x27;s psychosis, realizing the various forces at play with his mind. Johnny alludes to the mysterious evil force kept behind a wall, which needs to be kept from escaping through continuously repainting the wall with the fresh blood of his victims, as the urges of Eff Boy, one of two Doughboys who are psychically empowered by the entity behind the wall, and who wishes to keep it from escaping so that it cannot reclaim him. This is contrasted by Psycho-Doughboy, who urges Johnny to kill himself so that the seal will break, releasing his &quot;master&quot; from behind the wall. While journeying through the underground of his home, Johnny kills a cockroach named Mr. Samsa (after Gregor Samsa, the main character of Franz Kafka&#x27;s short story &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;). Johnny also rigs a robotic arm and handgun to shoot him if he were to answer the phone if someone calls, further flaunting his belief in his own immortality. When Devi calls him on the advice of a friend (as seen in an earlier scene), Johnny answers out of curiosity and is shot in the head immediately after resolving not to kill himself. Around this time, a pair of his victims escape from the bloody wall as a formless monstrosity breaks free, and reality itself seems to be erased.

Eventually, Johnny&#x27;s soul arrives in Heaven, where he meets St. Peter, who becomes physically ill with all that Johnny has done throughout his life. With him distracted, Johnny enters Heaven and meets a demon woman named Damned Elise who gives Johnny a tour. Johnny starts a massive psychic battle when he discovers that the souls in Heaven are immortal and have mental powers which includes the ability to explode people&#x27;s heads. Later on in the tour, Johnny is brought before God, who is a lazy, obese man sitting in a chair in a state of exhaustion. Johnny starts a tirade that ends with Elise sending him to Hell. Johnny meets Señor Diablo, who gives Johnny a tour of the underworld and reveals that Johnny is a &quot;flusher&quot; or &quot;waste lock&quot;, a creature chosen to concentrate the spiritual byproducts generated by humans into a specific object or point in space, in this case the wall in Johnny&#x27;s house. As Johnny died, the wall unleashed the built-up negative energy, in the process destroying the universe, which was then restored. Johnny instantly despises Hell as he interacts with the obsessively negative and selfish citizens, and is sent back to life by Senior Diablo. Later on Earth, Johnny is unsure if he really died or if he experienced some kind of hallucination, and he resolves to become emotionless in order to retain his control over himself. When a copycat killer named &quot;Jimmy&quot; pays Johnny a visit and confesses to several murders and a rape, Johnny eviscerates him out of pure disgust. Afterward, Johnny visits Squee and tells him that he should look out for himself, otherwise he may become as mentally damaged as Johnny himself. The series ends with Johnny sitting on a cliff overlooking the city, writing in his diary, with the hopes that he will be &quot;as cold as the moonlight&quot; that touches the diary&#x27;s pages.

==Filler strips==
&quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot; features several filler strips, which, for the most part, have nothing to do with the main storyline. &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac: Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; collects &quot;Happy Noodle Boy&quot;, &quot;Public Service Announcement&quot;, and &quot;Anne Gwish&quot; while &quot;Squee&#x27;s Wonderful Big Giant Book of Unspeakable Horrors&quot; includes &quot;Wobbly-Headed Bob&quot;, &quot;Meanwhile...&quot;, and &quot;True Tales of Human Drama&quot;.

===Happy Noodle Boy===

There is also a comic within a comic in the form of &quot;Happy Noodle Boy&quot;, written and drawn by Johnny himself.

===Public Service Announcement===
In a few issues, there are &quot;Public Service Announcement&quot; strips that parody television public service announcements on topics such as teen pregnancy and substance abuse.

===Anne Gwish===

Anne Gwish is a young goth woman that has her own strip in the later part of the series. Her name is a pun on the word &quot;anguish.&quot; Her storyline is completely unrelated to Johnny&#x27;s, though she lives in the same fictional universe. The strips featuring her are largely a satire on the goth subculture.

===Wobbly-Headed Bob===

Wobbly-Headed Bob lives in a separate fictional universe from the main storyline, one inhabited by anthropomorphic animals who, with the exception of Bob, live in a state of innocence and bliss. In contrast, Bob is a who believes himself to be the most intelligent person in the world, and the only one who understands the true nature of reality, which he sees in entirely pessimistic terms. His extreme negativity leaves him isolated and depressed. He overwhelms anyone he meets with his despair and often causes them to either commit suicide or flee from him in horror.

===Meanwhile...===
In one &quot;Meanwhile...&quot; strip, a group of piñatas come to life to exact revenge on a girl whose birthday party claimed one of their own. In another, two ancient gods of war possess a pair of grade school crossing guards to reenact an epic battle. In yet another, a naïve goth teenager, a character who also appears in &quot;I Feel Sick&quot;, dreams of becoming a sexy vampire like those found in &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot;, but transforms instead into a vampire more like Count Orlok. In one of the more infamous &quot;Meanwhile...&quot; strips, a nervous man on a date with Devi D. tries to conceal his explosive diarrhea. In an act of self-insertion, Jhonen Vasquez himself appears in other &quot;Meanwhile...&quot; strips.

===True Tales of Human Drama===
The strips titled &quot;True Tales of Human Drama&quot; tell stories about things such as a baby exploding, a plane crashing into a bus full of boy scouts, and a man blowing something out of his nose so horrible that a priest commands him to jump off a building.

==Reception==
On 5 April 2008, &quot;Wizard&quot; placed the third issue of &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot; at number 151 in its rundown of the 200 greatest comics since the magazine started in July 1991.

==Merchandise==
Over the years, Slave Labor Graphics has sold &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot; merchandise such as clothing, posters, and toys. Slave Labor released a Spooky squeeze toy, first shown in &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot; #4, as part of its promotion for &quot;I Feel Sick&quot;. Several years ago, a mug based on the design of the wall monster with the Question Sleep logo was under development.

<doc id="298614" wikidata="Q7920311" url="?curid=298614" title="Ventricular action potential">
<text>In electrocardiography, the ventricular cardiomyocyte membrane potential is about −90 mV at rest, which is close to the potassium reversal potential. When an action potential is generated, the membrane potential rises above this level in five distinct phases.

# Phase 4: Resting membrane potential remains stable at ≈−90 mV.
# Phase 0: Rapid depolarisation, shifting the voltage to positive. Specialised membrane proteins (voltage-gated sodium channels) in the cell membrane selectively allow sodium ions to enter the cell. This causes the membrane potential to rise at a rate of about 300 V/s. As the membrane voltage rises (to about 40 mV) sodium channels close due to a process called inactivation.
# Phase 1: Rapid repolarisation.
# Phase 2: Plateau, the longest phase, approximately 100ms.
# Phase 3: Rapid repolarisation, which returns the membrane potential to resting potential.

The Na+ channel opening is followed by inactivation. Na+ inactivation comes with slowly activating Ca2+ channels at the same time as a few fast K+ channels open. There is a balance between the outward flow of K+ and the inward flow of Ca2+ causing a plateau of length in variables. The delayed opening of more Ca2+-activated K+ channels, which are activated by build-up of Ca2+ in the sarcoplasm, while the Ca2+ channels close, ends the plateau. This leads to repolarization.

The depolarization of the membrane allows calcium channels to open as well. As sodium channels close calcium provides current to maintain the potential around 20 mV. The plateau lasts on the order of 100 ms. At the time that calcium channels are getting activated, channels that mediate the transient outward potassium current open as well. This outward potassium current causes a small dip in membrane potential shortly after depolarization. This current is observed in human and dog action potentials, but not in guinea pig action potentials.

Repolarization is accomplished by channels that open slowly and are mostly activated at the end of the action potential (slow delayed-rectifier channels) and channels that open quickly but are inactivated until the end of the action potential (rapid delayed rectifier channels). Fast delayed rectifier channels open quickly but are shut by inactivation at high membrane potentials. As the membrane voltage begins to drop the channels recover from inactivation and carry current.

<text>San Gimignano (; named after St. Geminianus) is a small walled medieval hill town in the province of Siena, Tuscany, north-central Italy. Known as the Town of Five Towers, San Gimignano is famous for its medieval architecture, unique in the preservation of about a dozen of its tower houses, which, with its hilltop setting and encircling walls, form &quot;an unforgettable skyline&quot;. Within the walls, the well-preserved buildings include notable examples of both Romanesque and Gothic architecture, with outstanding examples of secular buildings as well as churches. The Palazzo Comunale, the Collegiata and Church of Sant&#x27; Agostino contain frescos, including cycles dating from the 14th and 15th centuries. The &quot;Historic Centre of San Gimignano&quot; is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The town also is known for saffron, the dry aged and saffron infused &quot;Golden Ham&quot;, pecorino cheese and its white wine, Vernaccia di San Gimignano, produced from the ancient variety of Vernaccia grape grown on the sandstone hillsides of the area.

== Territory ==
The municipality of San Gimignano extends for 138 km² and is located on a hill in Val d&#x27;Elsa. The altitude difference is between a minimum of 64 meters a.s.l. in the plain of the river Elsa near Certaldo at a maximum of 631 meters in the area of Cornocchio.

==History==

In the 3rd century BC a small Etruscan village stood on the site of San Gimignano. Chroniclers Lupi, Coppi and Pecori relate that during the Catiline conspiracy against the Roman Republic in the 1st century, two patrician brothers, Muzio and Silvio, fled Rome for Valdelsa and built two castles, Mucchio and Silvia (now San Gimignano). The name of Silvia was changed to San Gimignano in 450 AD after Bishop Geminianus, the Saint of Modena, intervened to spare the castle from destruction by the followers of Attila the Hun. As a result, a church was dedicated to the saint, and in the 6th and 7th centuries a walled village grew up around it, subsequently called the &quot;Castle of San Gimignano&quot; or Castle of the Forest because of the extensive woodland surrounding it. From 929 the town was ruled by the bishops of Volterra.

In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance era, it was a stopping point for Catholic pilgrims on their way to Rome and the Vatican, as it sits on the medieval Via Francigena. The city&#x27;s development was also improved by the trade of agricultural products from the fertile neighbouring hills, in particular saffron, used in both cooking and dyeing cloth and Vernaccia wine, said to inspire popes and poets.

In 1199, the city made itself independent of the bishops of Volterra and established a , and set about enriching the commune with churches and public buildings. However, the peace of the town was disturbed for the next two centuries by conflict between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, and family rivalries within San Gimignano. This resulted in competing families building tower houses of increasingly greater heights. Towards the end of the Medieval period, there were 72 tower houses in number, up to 70 metres (230 feet) tall. The rivalry was finally restrained when the local council ordained that no tower was to be taller than that adjacent to the Palazzo Comunale.
While the official patron is Saint Geminianus, the town also honours Saint Fina, known also as Seraphina and Serafina, who was born in San Gimignano 1238 and whose feast day is 12 March. The Chapel of Santa Fina in the Collegiate Church houses her shrine and frescos by Ghirlandaio. The house said to be her home still stands in the town.

On 8 May 1300, San Gimignano hosted Dante Alighieri in his role as ambassador of the Guelph League in Tuscany.

The city flourished until 1348, when it was struck by the Black Death that affected all of Europe, and about half the townsfolk died. The town submitted to the rule of Florence. Initially, some Gothic palazzi were built in the Florentine style, and many of the towers were reduced to the height of the houses. There was little subsequent development, and San Gimignano remained preserved in its medieval state until the 19th century, when its status as a touristic and artistic resort began to be recognised.

==Description==

The city is on the ridge of a hill with its main axis being north/south. It is encircled by three walls and has at its highest point, to the west, the ruins of a fortress dismantled in the 16th century. There are eight entrances into the city, set into the second wall, which dates from the 12th and 13th centuries. The main gates are Porta San Giovanni on the ridge extending south, Porta San Matteo to the north west and Porta S. Jacopo to the north east. The main streets are Via San Matteo and Via San Giovanni, which cross the city from north to south.
At the heart of the town are four squares: the Piazza Duomo, on which stands the Collegiate Church; the Piazza della Cisterna, the Piazza Pecori and the Piazza delle Erbe. To the north of the town is another significant square, Piazza Agostino, on which stands the Church of Sant&#x27; Agostino. The locations of the Collegiate Church and Sant&#x27; Agostino&#x27;s and their piazzas effectively divide the town into two regions.

==Main sights==
The town of San Gimignano has many examples of Romanesque and Gothic architecture, which may be distinguished from each other by their round and pointed arches, respectively. As well as churches and medieval fortifications, there are examples of Romanesque secular and domestic architecture. A particular feature which is typical of the region of Siena is that the arches of openings are depressed, with doorways often having a second low arch set beneath a semi-circular or pointed arch. Both Romanesque and Gothic windows sometimes have a bifurcate form, with two openings divided by a stone mullion under a single arch. A 1:100 recreation of the city in the 14th century is housed in the SanGimignano1300 museum.

===Squares===
====Piazza della Cisterna====
This Piazza, entered from Via San Giovanni, is the main square of the town. It is triangular in shape and is surrounded by medieval houses of different dates, among them some fine examples of Romanesque and Gothic palazzos. At the centre of the piazza stands a well which was the main source of water for the town&#x27;s residents. The structure dates from 1346. Although much of it has been renewed in the late 20th century, parts of the paving date from the 13th century.

====Piazza Duomo====
This piazza is to the north of Piazza della Cisterna and is connected by a passage adjacent to an open loggia. To the west, at the top of the square, stands the Collegiate Church, reached by a broad flight of steps. The name of the square would seem to imply that this church was at one time a cathedral, but although it was perhaps planned, this was not the case. Other important buildings on the square include the Palazzo Comunale and the Palazzo Podesta, the house of the mayor. The Palazzo Podesta is distinguished by its huge arched loggia.

===Towers===

While in other cities, such as Florence, most or all of their towers have been brought down by wars, catastrophes, or urban renewal, San Gimignano has managed to conserve fourteen towers of varying heights, for which it is known internationally.
* Campanile della Collegiata
* Torri degli Ardinghelli 
* Torre dei Becci
* Torre Campatelli
* Torre Chigi (1280) 
* Torre dei Cugnanesi 
* Torre del Diavolo
* Torre Ficherelli or Ficarelli
* Torre Grossa (1311), 
* Torre di Palazzo Pellari
* Casa-torre Pesciolini
* Torre Pettini
* Torre Rognosa, 
* Torri dei Salvucci

===Churches===
There are many churches in the town: the two main ones are the &quot;Collegiata&quot;, formerly a cathedral, and &quot;Sant&#x27;Agostino&quot;, housing many artworks from early Italian renaissance artists.

The Pieve di Santa Maria at Cèllole, a village in the municipality, is a Romanesque rural church with a baptistery.

===Civic buildings===
The Communal Palace, once seat of the podestà, is currently home of the town gallery, with works by Pinturicchio, Benozzo Gozzoli, Filippino Lippi, Domenico di Michelino, Pier Francesco Fiorentino and others. From Dante&#x27;s Hall in the palace, access may be made to a &quot;Maesta&quot; fresco by Lippo Memmi, as well as the &quot;Torre del Podestà&quot; or &quot;Torre Grossa&quot;, 1311, which stands high.

==Culture==
San Gimignano is the birthplace of the poet Folgore da San Gimignano (1270–1332).

A fictionalised version of San Gimignano is featured in E. M. Forster&#x27;s 1905 novel, &quot;Where Angels Fear to Tread&quot; as Monteriano.

M. C. Escher&#x27;s 1923 woodcut &quot;San Gimignano&quot; depicts the celebrated towers.

Franco Zeffirelli used San Gimignano as a stand-in for the town of Assisi in his 1972 Saint Francis of Assisi biopic &quot;Brother Sun, Sister Moon&quot;. Most of the &quot;Assisi&quot; scenes were filmed here.

&quot;Tea with Mussolini&quot;, a 1999 drama about the plight of English and American expatriate women in Italy during World War II, was filmed in part in San Gimignano. The frescoes that the women save from being destroyed during the German Army&#x27;s withdrawal are inside the Duomo, the town&#x27;s main church. The account of this episode is, to a large extent, fictional, because, although there are reports of intended retribution against the town, there is no evidence of a plan to destroy the churches. However, the reference to risk of cultural destruction is historic, as the Allies bombed the area for ten days.

In the 2005 novel &quot;The Broker&quot; by John Grisham, Joel Backman takes his second of three wives on vacation in Italy to keep her from divorcing him. They rent a 14th-century monastery near San Gimignano for a month.

A 15th-century version of the town is featured in the 2009 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed II&quot;.

==Municipal government==

San Gimignano is headed by a mayor (&#x27;) assisted by a legislative body, the &#x27;, and an executive body, the &#x27;. Since 1995 the mayor and members of the &#x27; are directly elected together by resident citizens, while from 1945 to 1995 the mayor was chosen by the legislative body. The &#x27; is chaired by the mayor, who appoints others members, called &#x27;. The offices of the &#x27; are housed in a building usually called the &#x27; or &quot;&quot;.

Since 1995 the mayor of San Gimignano is directly elected by citizens, originally every four, then every five years. The current mayor is Andrea Marrucci (PD), elected on 26 May 2019 with the 70.3% of the votes and re-elected on 9 June 2024 with 84.9% of the votes.

==Demographic evolution==
==International relations==
San Gimignano is twinned with:
* Český Krumlov, Czech Republic
* Meersburg, Germany
* Mestia, Georgia

<text>A studio orchestra is an orchestra that exists only for the purpose of studio recording. That is, it does not perform in public concerts or for audiences generally. Studio orchestras are typically run by movie and television studios to produce film and television soundtrack recordings. Nearly all easy listening orchestras are studio orchestras. Some famous easy listening studio orchestras are the 101 Strings, the Living Strings, and the Hollyridge Strings. In pop music of the 1960s, studio orchestras were commonly assembled by record producers and songwriters like Phil Spector, Brian Wilson, and Burt Bacharach.

<doc id="298618" wikidata="Q1739455" url="?curid=298618" title="Pickering Nuclear Generating Station">
<text>Pickering Nuclear Generating Station is a Canadian nuclear power station located on the north shore of Lake Ontario in Pickering, Ontario. It is one of the oldest nuclear power stations in the world and Canada&#x27;s third-largest, with eight CANDU reactors. Since 2003, two of these units have been defuelled and deactivated, with two additional units being taken offline as of 2025. The remaining four produce about 11% of Ontario&#x27;s power and employ 3,000 workers.

A single 1.8 MWe wind turbine, named the OPG 7 commemorative turbine, was installed on the site of the generating station until October 2019, when it was dismantled.

==Reactor codification==

The reactors can be classified as follows:

PICKERING A
* PICKERING A 1 (Safe Shutdown state)
* PICKERING A 2 (Safe Shutdown state, defuelled)
* PICKERING A 3 (Safe Shutdown state, defuelled)
* PICKERING A 4 (Safe Shutdown state)

PICKERING B
* PICKERING B 5
* PICKERING B 6
* PICKERING B 7
* PICKERING B 8

==Construction==

The site was once Squires Beach located west of Duffins Creek. The facility was constructed in stages between 1965 and 1986 by the provincial Crown corporation, Ontario Hydro, with significant completion of Station A scheduled for 1971. In April 1999, Ontario Hydro was split into five component Crown corporations with Ontario Power Generation (OPG) taking over all electricity generating stations. OPG continues to operate the Pickering station.

==Operation==
The Pickering station is a large multi-unit nuclear facility, comprising six operating CANDU nuclear reactors with a total output of 3,114 MW when all units are on line, and two non-operating units with a total output of 1,030 MW currently shut down in safe storage. The facility is connected to the North American power grid via numerous 230 kV and 500 kV transmission lines.

The facility was operated as two distinct stations, Pickering A (Units 1 to 4) and Pickering B (Units 5 to 8) until 2011. While primarily administrative in nature, the division was not wholly artificial, as there are some distinct differences in design between the two groups of stations. (Example: The Pickering A units employ a moderator dump as a shutdown mechanism, a feature not found in Pickering B, which instead uses what is called an over-poisoned reaction guaranteed shutdown.) There are, however, a number of systems and structures in common between the two stations; the most notable of these is the shared vacuum building, a negative pressure containment system. The operation of Pickering A and B was unified in 2010, to reduce costs now that Pickering A Units 2 and 3 are shut down in safe storage.

==Partial shutdown==
On December 31, 1997 the four Pickering A reactors, along with the remaining three units at Bruce A, were shut down by Ontario Hydro for safety reasons and placed in lay-up. Specific to Pickering A, four years earlier the AECB had required mandatory upgrades to the safe shutdown system be completed by the end of 1997, which differed from that at the other three plants. Pickering A featured a moderator dump as its 2nd shutdown system, and this was deemed too slow compared to the poison injection system that later plants used, including Pickering B. Ontario Hydro committed to the refit and restart project, but it underwent long delays and large cost over-runs.

=== Safety System Refit ===
Often called a refurbishment, the return to service of Pickering A units 1 and 4 did not involve refurbishing the reactor cores, which involves replacing the calandria tubes, pressure tubes, feeders and end fittings. The main scope of work was the upgrading of the secondary safe shutdown system as well as some maintenance. Instead of retrofitting the poison injection found at the other plants, the least cost option was to add more shutdown rods and then split them into separate, independent groups. This was deemed sufficient by the AECB, despite acknowledging that this does not in fact constitute a fully independent fast acting secondary safe shutdown system.

=== Return to service ===
Premier Mike Harris asked former federal energy Minister Jake Epp to study and make recommendations on the problems with the Pickering restart. The review panel was established in May 2003.

Unit 4 was refitted and then restarted in Sept. 2003. The election of the Ontario Liberal Party in October 2003 delayed action on the Epp report. In late 2003, the new government fired the top three executives of OPG for botching the Unit 4 restoration, which was years late and millions of dollars over budget.

Mr. Epp and the Pickering A Review Panel released their report in December 2003, which acknowledged the large cost over-runs and delays, attributing blame to bad management. The Epp Review estimated the cost of restarting the remaining three reactors at $3 – 4 billion and supported the continuation of the project.

The government of Dalton McGuinty appointed Epp to the Ontario Power Generation Review headed by John Manley to examine the future role of Ontario Power Generation (OPG) in the province&#x27;s electricity market, examine its corporate and management structure, and decide whether the public utility should proceed with refurbishing three more nuclear reactors at the Pickering nuclear power plant. The report recommended proceeding with the restart of Pickering “A” reactors 1, 2, and 3, sequentially. The report argued that the restart of units 2 and 3 would be contingent on whether “OPG will be able to succeed at the Unit 1 project.&quot;

The McGuinty government accepted the OPG Review Committee&#x27;s recommendation and allowed the refit and restart of reactor 1.

The anti-nuclear group Sierra Club of Canada criticized the 2004 OPG Review Committee report for not attributing any blame to the problems of nuclear technology, noting that there were no energy or environmental experts appointed to the panel.

Numerous changes in executive-level staff and project management strategy were made for the follow-on project to refit Unit 1. The experience with the return to service of Pickering A Unit 1 was significantly different from Unit 4, with a much tighter adherence to schedule and budget. In August 2005, the OPG Board of Directors announced that Units 2 and 3 would not be returned to service due to specific technical and cost risks surrounding the material condition of these two units. Unit 1 was returned to service in November 2005.

==Electrical Output==
The graph represents the annual electricity generation at the site (A and B combined) in GWh.

As of the end of 2023, the total lifetime output of the facility was 972,252 GWh.

==Costs==
=== Construction Costs ===
Ontario Hydro estimated the construction cost for the four Pickering &quot;A&quot; units at $508 million in 1965. Actual cost was $716 million (in 1973 dollars). Adjusted for inflation, the $508 million estimate in 1973 dollars is $698 million, a 2.6% overrun.

The 1974 estimated cost for the four Pickering &quot;B&quot; units was $1.585 billion. Final cost was $3.846 billion (1986 dollars). Adjusted for inflation, the $1.585 billion estimate in 1986 dollars is $4.082 billion, putting Pickering B under budget.

=== Safety Refit Costs ===
According to Ontario&#x27;s FAO, the cost for refitting and restarting the Pickering A units deviated significantly from projections.
- Pickering Unit 4 was slated to cost $460 million and ultimately ended up costing $1.25 billion.
- Pickering Unit 1 was slated to cost $210 million and ultimately ended up costing $1.00 billion.

However, the figure presented by the FAO for Unit 1 doesn&#x27;t align with that provided by Ontario Energy Minister, Dwight Duncan, who indicated that Pickering Unit 1 would cost $900 million, putting the completed project much closer to budget. This is supported by OPG stating that the project was completed on time and on budget.

==Waste==
The used nuclear fuel and some refurbishment waste generated by the plant sits on-site at the Pickering Waste Management Facility. All operational low and intermediate-level waste is transported to OPG&#x27;s Western Waste Management Facility at the Bruce nuclear site near Kincardine, Ontario. OPG has proposed the construction and operation of a deep geologic repository for the long-term storage of low and intermediate level waste on lands adjacent to the Western Waste Management Facility. The Nuclear Waste Management Organization is currently seeking a site for a potential repository for the used fuel from all Canadian nuclear reactors.

==Records==
On October 7, 1994, Pickering Unit 7 set the world record for continuous runtime at 894 days, a record that stood for 22 years. It was surpassed by Heysham 2 unit 8 in 2016, a facility located in the UK, owned by EDF. This was subsequently surpassed by OPG&#x27;s Darlington plant with Unit 1 running 1,106 consecutive days.
- In 2019, Pickering set a site capacity factor record of 87.07%, producing 23.6TWh and putting it roughly on-par with the much newer Darlington and Bruce facilities.

==Future==

In January 2016, the Province of Ontario approved plans to pursue continued operation of the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station to 2024. The extension was intended to ensure sufficient base load electricity was available during refurbishment of the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station and the initial Bruce Nuclear refurbishments. By 2016, OPG had begun planning for the end of commercial operations at the generating station, including the potential repurposing of the Pickering site location.

OPG will begin the longer term decommissioning process if refurbishment is not pursued. The first step in the long-term decommissioning process is to layup the reactors and place them into safe storage. Pickering staff will have future employment opportunities placing the Pickering units in a safe storage state, at the Darlington refurbishment and operations, or at the potential new build at Darlington.

In September 2022, the Province of Ontario announced that it supported an extension of Pickering&#x27;s operation from 2024 to 2026. Simultaneously, it announced that it had requested OPG to update feasibility studies on the potential refurbishment of the four units of Pickering B. In its announcement, the Province stated that continued operation of the station would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 2.1 megatonnes in 2026, as well as increasing the North American supply of cobalt-60, a medical isotope.

In August 2023, the OPG Board of Directors agreed with and authorized the submission of the feasibility assessment for the refurbishment of the Pickering B plant to the province as well as to proceed with preliminary planning and preparation activities for the project. This feasibility report was given to the Minister of Energy in January 2024 but was not released to the public because it could harm the &quot;economic or other interests of Ontario.”

On January 30, 2024, the Minister of Energy, Todd Smith, announced that the Government of Ontario would be investing in the refurbishment of the four Pickering B reactors that date back to the early 1980s. The refurbishment is expected to be complete by the mid 2030s and should extend the life of the plant by at least another 30 years.

On October 1, 2024 at 11PM, Pickering 1 was removed from service as planned, as part of the A plant shutdown process.

On December 31, 2024, at 12PM, Pickering 4 was removed from service, the final step in the A plant shutdown process.

==Incidents==

A serious incident occurred on 1 August 1983. Pressure tube G16 in the Pickering A Unit 2 reactor developed a 2 metre long split. The reactor was safely shut down and the damage investigated. The cause was found to be the mis-location of annulus gas spacer springs which allowed the hot pressure tube to sag and touch the inside of the cold calandria tube leading to hydrogen enrichment of the cooler areas. This created a series of small cracks which linked up and caused the long rupture. There was some local fuel damage and the reactor was safely shut down by the operators with no increase in radioactive emissions. The eventual resolution was Large Scale Fuel Channel Replacement and all the pressure tubes were replaced in all Pickering A reactors. The new pressure tubes were supported by an improved design of the annulus gas spacer springs. Since then, careful monitoring of the location of the annulus gas spacer rings has been a significant part of routine reactor inspections.

On December 10, 1994 there was a loss of coolant accident. It is said to be the most serious accident in Canadian history (June 2001) by The Standing Senate Committee on Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources. The Emergency Core Cooling System was used to prevent a meltdown.

In 1995 and 1996, the AECB noted many safety concerns with the plant, and the generating station was shut in 1997 after peer reviews describing poor safety practices at the plant became public. An Independent, Integrated Performance Assessment report noted that Pickering stations A and B were cited for breaking regulation 15 times and having 13 fires for the year. &quot;Also of concern was the high failure rate of persons being tested for positions as nuclear operators. At Pickering A only 65% of those taking the test passed, while at Pickering B the rate was just 56%.&quot;

On March 14, 2011, there was a leak of 73 cubic metres of demineralized water into Lake Ontario from a failed pump seal. There was negligible risk to the public according to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission.

=== 2020 nuclear incident alert ===

On January 12, 2020 at 7:24 a.m. ET, an emergency alert was issued via Alert Ready on all radio stations, television stations, television providers, and wireless networks in the province of Ontario, containing an advisory of an unspecified &quot;incident&quot; that had been reported and was being addressed at the plant. The alert stated that no immediate action was required for those within of the plant. Approximately 40 minutes later, OPG issued a statement via Twitter that the alert had been sent in error, and a second emergency alert was issued at around 9:10 a.m. with a similar message cancelling the previous alert.

Solicitor General Sylvia Jones stated that the alert was accidentally issued during a &quot;routine training exercise&quot; by Ontario&#x27;s emergency operations centre. The incident prompted criticism from government officials, including MPP Peter Tabuns, Pickering mayor Dave Ryan, and Toronto mayor John Tory.

The false alarm also prompted renewed interest in preparedness for actual nuclear accidents: OPG reported a surge in the sales of potassium iodide kits via its &quot;Prepare to Be Safe&quot; website between January 12 and 13, increasing from its monthly average of 100 to 200, to over 32,000. The website is applicable for those who live within of the plant; per Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) requirements, OPG is required to distribute these pills to all residences within of a nuclear facility.

<doc id="298622" wikidata="Q6596" url="?curid=298622" title="Gorizia">
<text>Gorizia (; ), colloquially known in Slovenia as &#x27;old Gorizia&#x27; to distinguish it from Nova Gorica (, ; ; ), is a town and (municipality) in northeastern Italy, in the autonomous region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia. It is located at the foot of the Julian Alps, bordering Slovenia. It is the capital of the Regional decentralization entity of Gorizia and is a local center of tourism, industry, and commerce. Since 1947, a twin town of Nova Gorica has developed on the other side of the modern-day Italy–Slovenia border. The region was subject to territorial dispute between Italy and Yugoslavia after World War II: after the new boundaries were established in 1947 and the old town was left to Italy, Nova Gorica was built on the Yugoslav side. The two towns constitute a conurbation, which also includes the Slovenian municipality of Šempeter-Vrtojba. Since May 2011, these three towns have been joined in a common trans-border metropolitan zone, administered by a joint administration board.

The name of the town comes from the Slovene word &#x27;little mountain&#x27;, which is a common toponym in Slovene-inhabited areas.

== History ==

=== Middle Ages ===
Originating as a watchtower or a prehistoric castle controlling the fords of the Isonzo River, Gorizia first emerged as a small village not far from the former Via Gemina, the Roman road linking Aquileia and Emona (modern Ljubljana). The name &quot;Gorizia&quot; was recorded for the first time in a document dated April 28, 1001, in which Holy Roman Emperor Otto III donated the castle and the village of &quot;Goriza&quot; to the Patriarch of Aquileia John II and to Count Verihen Eppenstein of Friuli. The document referred to Gorizia as &quot;the village known as &quot;Goriza&quot; in the language of the Slavs&quot; (&quot;Villa quae Sclavorum lingua vocatur Goriza&quot;).
Count Meinhard of the Bavarian &quot;Meinhardiner&quot; noble lineage, with possessions around Lienz in Tyrol, is mentioned as early as 1107; as a &quot;vogt&quot; of the Patriarchate of Aquileia he was enfeoffed with large estates in the former March of Friuli, including the town of Gorizia, and as early as 1127 called himself &quot;Graf von Görz&quot;, Count of Gorizia. In the late 13th century, the House of Gorizia emerged as one of the most important noble houses in the Holy Roman Empire.
The borders of the County changed frequently in the following three centuries due to frequent wars with Aquileia and other counties, and also to the subdivision of the territory in two main nuclei: one around the upper Drava river with the center in Lienz, the other around Gorizia itself. Between the 12th century and early 16th century, the town served as the political and administrative center of this essentially independent County of Gorizia, which at the height of its power comprised the territory of the present-day regions of Goriška, southeast Friuli, the Karst Plateau, central Istria, western Carinthia and East Tyrol, and the Windic March with Bela Krajina.

From the 11th century, the town had two different layers of development: the upper castle district and the village beneath it. The first played a political-administrative role and the second a rural-commercial role. The name of the central square, known to this day in both languages as Travnik or Traunig (&quot;meadow&quot;, in Slovene), testifies to this period.

In the late 15th century, the city rights were expanded to the lower town.

=== Habsburg rule ===
In 1500, the dynasty of the Counts of Gorizia died out and their County passed to Austrian Habsburg rule, after a short occupation by the Republic of Venice in the years 1508 and 1509. Under Habsburg dominion, the town spread out at the foot of the castle. Many settlers from northern Italy moved there and started their commerce. Gorizia developed into a multi-ethnic town, in which Friulian, German and Slovene were spoken.

In mid-16th century, Gorizia emerged as a center of Protestant Reformation, which was spreading from the neighboring northeastern regions of Carniola and Carinthia. The prominent Slovene Protestant preacher Primož Trubar also visited and preached in the town. By the end of the century, however, the Catholic Counter-Reformation had gained force in Gorizia, led by the local dean Johann Tautscher, who later became bishop of Ljubljana. Tautscher was also instrumental in bringing the Jesuit order to the town, which played a role in the education and cultural life in Gorizia thereafter.

Gorizia was at first part of the County of Gorizia and since 1754, the capital of the Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca. In ecclesiastical matters, after the suppression of the Patriarchate of Aquileia in 1751, the Archdiocese of Gorizia was established as its legal successor on the territory of the Habsburg monarchy. Gorizia thus emerged as a Roman Catholic religious center. The archdiocese of Gorizia covers a large territory, extending to the Drava River to the north and the Kolpa to the east, with the dioceses of Trieste, Trento, Como and Pedena subject to the authority of the archbishops of Gorizia. A new town quarter developed around the Cathedral where many treasures from the Basilica of Aquileia were transferred. Many new villas were built conveying to the town the typical late Baroque appearance, which characterized it up to World War I. A synagogue was built within the town walls, too, which was another example of Gorizia&#x27;s relatively tolerant multi-ethnic nature.

During the Napoleonic Wars, Gorizia was incorporated to the French Illyrian Provinces between 1809 and 1813. After the restoration of the Austrian rule, the Gorizia and its county were incorporated in the administrative unit known as the Kingdom of Illyria. During this period, Gorizia emerged as a popular summer residence of the Austrian nobility, and became known as the &quot;Austrian Nice&quot;. Members of the former French ruling Bourbon family, deposed by the July Revolution of 1830, also settled in the town, including the last Bourbon monarch Charles X who spent his last years in Gorizia. Unlike in most neighboring areas, the revolutionary spring of nations of 1848 passed almost unnoticed in Gorizia, thus reaffirming its reputation of a calm and loyal provincial town.
In 1849, the County of Gorizia was included in the Austrian Littoral, along with Trieste and Istria. In 1861, the territory was reorganized as the Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca and granted regional autonomy. At that time, Gorizia was a multi-ethnic town; Italian and Friulian, Slovene and German were all spoken in the town center, while in the suburbs Slovene and Friulian prevailed. Although some tensions between the Italian-Friulian and the Slovene population existed, the town continued to maintain a relatively tolerant climate in which both Slovene and Italian-Friulian cultures flourished.

On the eve of World War I, Gorizia had around 31,000 inhabitants and was the third-largest city in the Austrian Littoral, following Trieste and Pula (Pola). Another 14,000 people lived in the suburbs, making it one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the Alpe-Adria area, ahead of Klagenfurt, Maribor, Salzburg, Bozen or Trento. Within the city limits, about 48% of the population spoke Italian or Friulian as their first language, while 35% were Slovene speakers. In the suburbs, the Slovene speaking population prevailed, with 77% versus 21% Italian/Friulian speakers.

=== World War I ===

Gorizia was not on the frontline during the first 10 months of World War I, but the first Gorizian victim of the war occurred as early as August 10, 1914, when Countess Lucy Christalnigg was shot by Landsturmer guards while driving her car on a mission for the Austrian Red Cross.

Italy entered World War I on the Allied side and conflict with Austria-Hungary began on May 24, 1915. The hills west of Gorizia soon became the scene of fierce battles between the Italian and Austro-Hungarian armies. The town itself was seriously damaged and most of its inhabitants had been evacuated by early 1916. The Italian Army occupied Gorizia during the Sixth Battle of the Isonzo in August 1916, with the front line moving to the eastern outskirts of the town. With the Battle of Caporetto in October and November 1917, when the Central Powers pushed the Italians back to the Piave River, the town returned to Austro-Hungarian control.

After the Battle of Caporetto, Gorizia became the focus of three competing political camps: the unified Slovene nationalist parties that demanded a semi-independent Yugoslav state under the House of Habsburg, the Friulian conservatives and Christian Socialists who demanded a separate and autonomous Eastern Friuli within an Austrian confederation, and the underground Italian irredentist movement working for unification with Italy. At the end of World War I, in late October 1918, the Slovenes unilaterally declared an independent State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, while the Friulians continued to demand an autonomous region under Habsburg rule. Gorizia became a contested town. In early November 1918, it was occupied by Italian troops again, who immediately dissolved the two competing authorities and introduced their own civil administration.

=== Kingdom of Italy ===
In the first years of Italian administration, Gorizia was included in the Governorate of the Julian March (1918–1919). In 1920, the town and the whole region became officially part of Italy. The autonomous County of Gorizia and Gradisca was dissolved in 1922, and in 1924 it was annexed to the Province of Udine (then called the Province of Friuli). In 1927 Gorizia became a provincial capital within the Julian March administrative region. During the fascist regime, all Slovene organizations were dissolved, and the public use of Slovene was prohibited. Underground Slovene organizations, with an anti-Fascist and often irredentist agenda, such as the militant insurrectionist organization TIGR, were established as a result. Many Slovenes fled to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and to South America, especially to Argentina. Many of these emigrants became prominent in their new environments. Very few Slovene-speaking intellectuals and public figures decided to stay in the town, and those few who did, like the writer France Bevk, were subject to persecution.

The town, heavily damaged during World War I, was rebuilt in the 1920s according to the plans laid out by the local architect Max Fabiani. Several rationalist buildings were built during this period, including some fine examples of Fascist architecture. The borders of the town were expanded, absorbing the suburbs of Salcano (Solkan), Podgora, Lucinico, and San Pietro di Gorizia (Šempeter pri Gorici), as well as the predominantly rural settlements of Vertoiba (Vrtojba), Boccavizza (Bukovica) and Sant&#x27;Andrea (Štandrež). According to the Italian census of 1921, the expanded town had around 47,000 inhabitants, among whom 45.5% were native Slovene, 33% Italian (mostly Venetian), and 20.5% Friulian speakers.

Benito Mussolini visited the town twice: in 1938 and in 1942.

After the Italian armistice in September 1943, the town was shortly occupied by the Slovene partisan resistance, but soon fell under Nazi German administration. Between 1943 and 1945 it was incorporated into the Operational Zone Adriatic Littoral. The town was briefly occupied by the Yugoslav Army in May and June 1945. With the arrival of the Yugoslav partisans in Gorizia in May 1945, a fierce repression began against the opponents, or potential opponents of the regime. At least 1,048 Italian civilians and military disappeared. According to some historians, many of the killings and violence suffered by the Italian ethnic group in Gorizia (and the rest of Friuli and Venezia Giulia) by the Yugoslav army were perpetrated as part of an ethnic cleansing practiced by Tito. Soon the administration was transferred to the Allies, who ruled the town for more than two years, amidst fierce ethnic and political turmoil.

=== Postwar partition and return to Italy ===
On September 15, 1947, the town was assigned to Italy. Several peripheral districts of the municipality of Gorizia (Solkan, Pristava, Rožna Dolina, Kromberk, Šempeter pri Gorici, Vrtojba, Stara Gora, Ajševica, Volčja Draga, Bukovica, and Vogrsko) were handed over to the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia, together with the vast majority of the former Province of Gorizia. Around a half of the prewar area of the municipality of Gorizia, with an approximate 20% of the population, was annexed to Yugoslavia. The national border was drawn just off the town center, essentially just to the west of the Bohinj Railway line, putting Gorizia into a peripheral zone. Several landmarks of the town, such as the Kostanjevica Monastery (), Kromberk Castle (, the Sveta Gora () pilgrimage site, the old Jewish cemetery, and the northern railway station, were on the Yugoslav side of the border. In 1948, the authorities of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia (with president Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s special support) started building a new town called Nova Gorica () on their side of the border.

From the late 1940s onward, Gorizia gave refuge to thousands of Istrian Italians that had fled the regions annexed to Yugoslavia. Many of those settled in the town and had a role in shaping its postwar national and political identity.

Though a border city, Gorizia was only in part crossed by the border with Yugoslavia. Some important old buildings once belonging to Gorizia were included in the Yugoslav territory: these include the old railway station of the Transalpina line that connected Trieste to Villach, as well as to the town landmarks. Although the situation in Gorizia was often compared with that of Berlin during the Cold War, Italy and Yugoslavia had good relations regarding Gorizia. These included cultural and sporting events that favoured the spirit of harmonious coexistence that remained in place after Yugoslavia broke up in 1991.

With the breakup of Yugoslavia, the frontier remained as the division between Italy and Slovenia until the implementation of the Schengen Agreement by Slovenia on December 21, 2007.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Gorizia has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). The town is located at the confluence of the Isonzo and Vipava Valleys. It lies on a plain overlooked by the Gorizia Hills. Sheltered from the north and from the east by a mountain ridge, Gorizia is completely protected from the cold bora wind, which affects the rest of the neighboring areas. The town thus enjoys an exceptionally mild climate throughout the year, making it a popular resort town.

== Main sights ==
* The castle, built within the medieval walls, was once the seat of the administrative and judiciary power of the county. It is divided into the Corte dei Lanzi (with foundings of a high tower demolished in the 16th century), the Palazzetto dei Conti (13th century) and the Palazzetto Veneto. The Lanzi were the armed guards, the term being an Italian form of Landsknecht. The palatine chapel, entitled to Saint Bartholomew houses canvases of the Venetian school of painting and traces of Renaissance frescoes. There is also a Museum of the Goritian Middle Ages.
* The cathedral (originally erected in the 14th century), like many of the city&#x27;s buildings, was almost entirely destroyed during World War I. It has been rebuilt following the forms of the 1682 edifice, a Baroque church with splendid stucco decoration. A Gothic chapel of San Acatius is annexed to the nave.
* The church of Gorizia of St. Ignatius of Loyola, built by the Jesuits in 1680–1725. It has a single nave with precious sculptures at the altars of the side chapels. In the presbytery Christoph Tausch painted a &quot;Glory of St. Ignatius&quot; in 1721.
* The &quot;Palazzo Attems Petzenstein&quot; (19th century), designed by Nicolò Pacassi.
* Saint Roch&#x27;s Church.
* &quot;Palazzo Cobenzl&quot;, today seat of the archbishops.
* The Counts of Lantieri&#x27;s house, which housed emperors and popes in its history.
* The &quot;Palazzo Coronini Cronberg&quot;, including an art gallery.
* Transalpina railway square, divided by an international border.
* The Department of International and Diplomatic Sciences of the University of Trieste, hosted in the &quot;Seminario Minore&quot;, is an academic course in foreign affairs.
* Oslavia War Memorial

== Border crossings ==
The Italy-Slovenia border runs by the edge of Gorizia and Nova Gorica and there are several border crossings between the cities. The ease of movement between the two parts of town has depended very much on the politics of both countries, ranging from strict controls to total free movement since December 21, 2007, when Slovenia joined the Schengen area.

Designated border crossings are (Gorizia-Nova Gorica):
* Casa Rossa-Rožna Dolina: main international crossing checkpoint
* Via San Gabriele-Erjavčeva ulica: previously only for local traffic with passes, nearest crossing to Nova Gorica center
* Via del Rafut-Pristava: previously only for local traffic with passes
* San Pietro (Via Vittorio Veneto)/Šempeter pri Gorici (Goriška ulica)
* Transalpina Square: open pedestrian square dissected by the border that was once fenced. The square was never an official crossing and signboards were erected to prohibit people from crossing the square from one side to the other
* The major highway crossing at Sant&#x27;Andrea-Vrtojba is located nearby to the south of the city.

== Historical demography ==
The chart shows the historical development of the population of Gorizia from the late 18th century to the eve of World War I, according to official Austrian censuses. The figures show the population of the municipality of Gorizia in the boundaries of the time. The criteria for the definition of the ethnical structure were changing over the years: in 1789, only the religious affiliation of the population was taken into account; in 1869 the ethnic affiliation was also recorded, with Jews counted as a separate category; in 1880 the category of ethnicity was replaced by the mother tongue, and from 1890 to 1910 only the &quot;language of everyday communication&quot; () was recorded. After 1869, the Jews were only recorded as a religious community, under the official category of &quot;Israelites&quot;. The data below refer to the population within the current borders of the city:

== Culture and education ==
Although the majority of the population identifies with the Italian culture, Gorizia is a center of Friulian and Slovene culture. Before 1918, the trilingual Gorizia Grammar School was one of the most important educational institutions in the Slovene Lands and for the Italians in the Austrian Littoral.

Nowadays, Gorizia hosts several important scientific and educational institutions. The University of Trieste, the University of Udine and the University of Nova Gorica all have part of their campuses and faculties located in Gorizia.

Gorizia is also the site of a choral competition, the &quot;C. A. Seghizzi&quot; International Choir Competition, which is a member of the European Grand Prix for Choral Singing.

== Religion ==

The majority of the population of Gorizia is of Roman Catholic denomination. The town is the seat of the Archbishop of Gorizia, who was one of the three legal descendants of the Patriarchate of Aquileia (along with the Patriarchate of Venice and the Archdiocese of Udine). Between mid-18th century and 1920, Gorizia was thus the center of a Metropolitan bishopric that comprised the Dioceses of Ljubljana, Trieste, Poreč-Pula and Krk. Religious figures who lived and worked in Gorizia during this period include Cardinal Jakob Missia, Bishop Frančišek Borgia Sedej, theologians Anton Mahnič and Josip Srebrnič, and the Franciscan friar and philologian Stanislav Škrabec.

There are many important Roman Catholic sacral buildings in the area, among them the sanctuaries of Sveta Gora (&quot;Holy Mountain&quot;) and the Kostanjevica Monastery, both of which are now located in Slovenia.

Until 1943, Gorizia had a Jewish community; most of its members were murdered in the Holocaust. A Lutheran community exists in Gorizia.

<text>Marine Corps Base Quantico (commonly abbreviated MCB Quantico) is a United States Marine Corps installation located near Triangle, Virginia, covering nearly of southern Prince William County, Virginia, northern Stafford County, and southeastern Fauquier County. Used primarily for training purposes, MCB Quantico is known as the &quot;Crossroads of the Marine Corps&quot;.

Quantico Station is a census-designated place (CDP) in Prince William and Stafford counties in the U.S. state of Virginia, used by the Census Bureau to describe base housing. The population was 4,452 at the 2010 census.

The U.S. Marine Corps&#x27; Combat Development Command, which develops strategies for U.S. Marine combat and makes up most of the community of over 12,000 military and civilian personnel (including families), is based here. It has a budget of around $300 million and is the home of the Marine Corps Officer Candidates School. The Marine Corps Research Center at Quantico pursues equipment research and development, especially telecommunications, for the Marine Corps. The Marine Corps Brig, a military prison, was also located at Quantico, until its closure on 31 December 2011 and its subsequent demolition.

The FBI Academy, the principal research and training facility of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the principal training facility for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the United States Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID) are also located on the base.

In 2001, the base was designated as part of the Quantico Marine Corps Base Historic District by the National Register of Historic Places. This district includes 122 buildings, two landscapes, a sculpture, and a water tower located within the Mainside area of the base. The contributing properties with separate entries include Tennessee Camp, Camp French, Commanding General&#x27;s Quarters, and Rising Hill Camp.

==History==

===Before the establishment of the Marine base===
The Quantico base is close to the Potomac River. The area was originally inhabited by the Patowomacks (Algonquian) in the 16th century. The name &quot;Quantico&quot; is presumed to come from a Native American term, and has been translated to mean &quot;by the large stream&quot;. Accounts show that the area was first visited by European explorers in the summer of 1608 with settlement beginning later that year.

After the start of the 18th century, the area became popular because of tobacco trade in Aquia Harbor. Because traveling on muddy roads in those days was slow, many villages sprang up along the river and its inlets. Additionally, the area was a bustling stopping point on the north–south routes between New York and Florida.

Early settlements and plantations rooted along the flatlands bordering the Potomac. The hills west of the river remained essentially uninhabited until the early 18th century. Prince William County was organized in 1731, when the &quot;Quantico Road&quot; was also opened. This road gave vital access from the western part of the county to this area. By 1759, the road stretched across the Blue Ridge Mountains into the Shenandoah Valley.

The first military presence at Quantico came during the American Revolutionary War, when the Quantico Creek village became a main naval base for the Commonwealth of Virginia&#x27;s 72-vessel fleet on which many state militia served.

The land was first visited by the Marine Corps in 1816, when a group of Marines traveling by ship to Washington were stopped when their vessel was halted by ice in the Potomac, forcing them to debark and march to the town of Dumfries, Virginia. Here they met a young Captain Archibald Henderson who lived close by. A generous-natured man, Henderson hired a wagon for them and sent them on their way.

During the American Civil War, control of the Potomac River became very important to the armies of both sides. The Confederates picked the Quantico Creek area on the Potomac to set up gun batteries. This enabled them to make full use of several points where their artillery could reach anything on the water, thus deterring Union use of the water highway. One of these sites included Shipping Point, the present day site of the Marine Corps Systems Command. Another site is Tennessee Camp, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.

While battles took place in Manassas, Virginia and Fredericksburg, Virginia, the gun positions around Quantico were used until the end of the war. After a 12-day battle at the Spotsylvania Courthouse where the Union lost about 25,000 soldiers, the war moved out of the Quantico area.

Following the war, railroads became an integral part of transportation in Virginia. In 1872, the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad was formed when several railroads north and south met at Quantico Creek. This railroad still runs through the base and is used daily.

The village came to be called &quot;Quantico&quot; and was built by the Quantico Company. This was the start of a thriving tourist and fishing town that would later be encompassed by Marine Corps Base Quantico.

===Establishing the base===

Prior to the base&#x27;s establishment, the land was owned by the Town of Quantico. Around the start of the 20th century, the Quantico Company was formed on Quantico Creek. By the beginning of the twentieth century, Quantico was being advertised as a recreational day trip. The Quantico Company promoted the town as a tourist and excursion center, and brought in tourists from Washington and Richmond by the steamer St. Johns and trains using the RF&amp;P railroad lines and depot developed at Quantico in 1872. A beach was developed with dressing rooms and refreshment stands. In one week in 1916, Quantico was visited by 2,600 visitors who came by steamer or train.

By 1916, the Quantico Company began advertising Quantico as &quot;The New Industrial City,&quot; and pushed for industry to come to the area. At the same time, the Quantico Shipyards were established on Hospital Point (the land that formerly held the Naval Medical Clinic but is now home to Marine Corps Systems Command) to build ocean freighters and oil tankers. With growing tensions of war in Europe, the construction of U.S. Navy ships was a major money-maker for the Quantico Shipyards. While the Town of Quantico was rapidly growing as a fishing village, excursion center and a shipbuilding center in early 1917, the town was not large or significant, and was suffering many financial difficulties.

Around the same time, Major General George Barnett, then Commandant of the Marine Corps, sent a board to find possible sites for a new Marine Corps base in the Washington, D.C., vicinity.

In 1917, Marine Barracks, Quantico was established on the land currently occupied by today&#x27;s base. Marine Barracks personnel consisted of 91 enlisted men and four officers. Thousands of Marines were trained here during World War I. The Commanding General&#x27;s Quarters was built in 1920 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. By 1920, the Marine Corps schools were founded, as Colonel Smedley Butler put it, &quot;to make this post and the whole Marine Corps a great university&quot;. These schools eventually developed into today&#x27;s Marine Corps University. Virtually all Marine officers receive their basic training here, as well as enlisted technicians from many different disciplines. Around the same time, as a part of these schools, a football team was established at the base, playing as a college football team. Until its disbanding in 1972, the team played against various NCAA Division I college teams, as well as teams from other military installations.

The first Marine Aircraft Wing was developed at Quantico, as well as the Corps&#x27; first helicopter squadron, Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the first helicopter squadron to provide rapid transportation for Presidents of the United States (&quot;Marine One&quot;). It continues that mission today.

In 1934, Amphibious Warfare Doctrine, along with special amphibious landing crafts for World War II were developed here. These Amphibious Warfare techniques, developed in the years before World War II, made victory possible in the Pacific theater. Quantico trained over 15,000 USMC and other service officers in these techniques.

In 1942, over were purchased by the federal government and added to Quantico, making up what is now the base west of Interstate 95. The expansion was needed for additional range and maneuver training areas during World War II.

In 1987, the Marine Corps Development and Education Command here was changed to the Marine Corps Combat Development Command.

On the night of 21 March 2013, a Marine opened fire killing two other Marines before killing himself.

In 2015, the base held first Department of Defense organized Warrior Games.

==Units and commands==
The Corps&#x27; Combat Development Command, which develops strategies for Marine combat and makes up most of the community of over 12,000 military and civilian personnel (including families) is based here. It has a budget of around $300 million and is the home of the Marine Corps Officer Candidates School. The Marine Corps Research Center at Quantico pursues equipment research and development, especially telecommunications, for the Marine Corps. The Marine Corps Brig, a military prison, was formerly located at Quantico.

The base was designated as part of the Quantico Marine Corps Base Historic District by the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. This district includes 122 buildings, two landscapes, a sculpture, and a water tower located within the Mainside area of the base. The contributing properties with separate entries include Tennessee Camp, Camp French, Commanding General&#x27;s Quarters, and Rising Hill Camp.

It is the site of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command and Marine Helicopter 1 HMX-1. HMX-1 was the first helicopter squadron to provide rapid transportation of U.S. Presidents, a mission they have continued to carry out to the present day.

A replica of the United States Marine Corps War Memorial, depicting the 2nd U.S. flag-raising on Iwo Jima, stands at the entrance to the base. (The original memorial stands at the north end of Arlington National Cemetery.)

Larson Gym opened in December 1953 in a former aircraft hangar built in the 1930s. It had a seating capacity of 2,000 and was named for Colonel Swede Larson, a former United States Naval Academy football player and coach. In later years, the Marine Corps Museum used the facility for restoring aircraft and the Quantico Marine Corps Band used it for practicing. It was demolished about 2018 after the Barber Fitness Center was opened.

Marine Corps Base Quantico and the Potomac River surround the town of Quantico. Access to the town is possible only through the base, the Amtrak train station, or from the river.

==Geography==
Quantico Station is located at (38.501951, −77.305962).
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 8.1 square miles (21.1 km2), of which, 7.2 square miles (18.5 km2) of it is land and 1.0 square miles (2.6 km2) of it (12.27%) is water.

The name &quot;Quantico Station&quot; is most often used to designate the train station in Quantico, Virginia where commuters use the Virginia Railway Express.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 6,571 people, 1,389 households, and 1,351 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 918.9 people per square mile (354.8/km2). There were 1,645 housing units at an average density of 230.0/sq mi (88.8/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 73.25% White, 16.01% African American, 0.46% Native American, 2.15% Asian, 0.15% Pacific Islander, 3.91% from other races, and 4.08% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 9.37% of the population.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $41,429, and the median income for a family was $41,288. Males had a median income of $24,478 versus $20,676 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $14,563. About 5.5% of families and 5.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.1% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.

==Education==
The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA), which serves as the school district for the installation, operates two schools on the base.

The Crossroads Elementary School facility was scheduled to open in Spring 2016. It had a cost of $47 million. It has a two-story media center and a rooftop environmental science center, patio, and garden. The facility uses natural light and heating from geothermal sources. In 2015 the &quot;Star-Tribune&quot; described it as &quot;state-of-the-art school design&quot;. It replaced Ashurst, Burrows, and Russell elementary schools.

Quantico Middle High School is the other facility.

In 1919 a 1-8 school opened, though high school students had to attend school in the District of Columbia or in Fredericksburg and Occoquan in Virginia. In the 1930s the high school program opened, and enrollment was over 300 in 1940. The school was renamed Quantico Post School the following year, with groundbreaking and dedication of a new building on 22 July of that year and the subsequent year&#x27;s 6 January. Russell Elementary opened in 1953.

University of Maryland Global Campus has a facility at MCB Quantico.

<text>Gandria is both a quarter of the city of Lugano in the Swiss canton of Ticino, and a village on the northern shore of Lake Lugano, which forms the core of that quarter. Until 2004, the quarter of Gandria was an independent municipality, joining with Lugano in that year.

The quarter of Gandria includes the rural slopes surrounding the village and stretching along the lakeside from the neighboring quarter of Castagnola-Cassarate to the border with Italy. It also includes the slopes on the opposite, (southern) side of the lake around the small settlement of Cantine di Gandria, that are accessible only by boat or on foot.

The historically protected center of the village of Gandria, which is also not accessible by car, attracts visitors from all over the world. While roads now reach the outskirts of the village, many of these visitors arrive by boat services on the lake. It is also possible to walk from Lugano to Gandria and back to Lugano via a footpath, now branded the &quot;Olive path&quot;, which passes plantations of olive trees and offers views of the Lake of Lugano.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
The first lasting human traces on the immediate area around Gandria come from the iron-age people of the Celts (as of 550 B.C.). A large stone (Sasso della Predescia) carved with mysterious signs, probably used for Celtic religious purposes, is located within hiking distance. Many modern locations nearby have Celtic names. Gandria sits at the base of Mt. Brè, which means “mountain” in Celtic.
The name of the Lake of Lugano in Italian, Ceresio, could be derived from the Celtic word keresios, a reference to a god of fertility who is always pictured with the antlers of a deer – the lake’s resemblance to the prongs of an antler can be more easily imagined when viewed from above. 
Rome conquered the region in 196 B.C. Tombs and artifacts from the neighbouring villages of Castagnola and Brè are testimonials to the Roman presence. Present-day Gandria, however, was not yet inhabited.

=== First settlement ===
“Gandrio” is first mentioned in archives from the bishop of Como in 1237. At the time, the village was located halfway up Mt. Bré – the ruins are still visible today along the trail to the Sasso della Predescia.

In the 14th century, a new settlement was established along the lake in the present-day site. Eventually the upper part of the village was abandoned, perhaps due to fire, perhaps due to the advantages of living near the lake. Gandria was only accessible by boat and steep trails, locals had to be self-sufficient. In addition to gardening and raising livestock, they benefited from the lake’s abundant fish.

=== Olives, silk and smuggling ===
Until the unusually hard winter of 1709 killed most of the olive trees, Gandria was known for its olive oil. In recent years, olive trees have been replanted and information panels posted along a scenic lakeside trail to Lugano (Sentiero dell’olivo).

In 1856 silk production began in Gandria, using leaves from local mulberry trees to feed the silkworms. Because of the difficult-to-control border, the area around Gandria became infamous for smuggling. Cigarettes, meat and alcohol were especially profitable due to high Swiss customs duties. (A notable item at the Swiss Customs Museum is a confiscated “submarine” used to smuggle salami).

The year 1935 was the beginning of a new era for Gandria, as tunnels and a new road above the lake shore connected the village to Lugano and Italy.

=== Merger with Lugano ===
In 2004, the municipality of Gandria merged with the city of Lugano. Since Gandria became a part of Lugano, needed infrastructure projects have been carried out, including a sewage treatment plant that went on line in August 2010. Work to place electrical lines underground is ongoing.

== Sights ==
=== Church of Saint Vigilio ===
The Church of Saint Vigilio in Gandria was completed in 1463. The oldest part is the gray, unfinished wall facing the lake, adorned with memorials from well-known local families. The baroque facades were completed in the 1870s. Behind the altar of the church is a large oil painting by Giovanni and Giuseppe Torricelli that shows the martyrdom of Saint Vigilio, a bishop of Trento in Italy, who was stoned to death by pagan shepherds.

The connection with Gandria comes from local artisans who worked on the construction of the cathedral in Trento, and were presumably impressed by the patron saint. The Torricelli brothers also painted scenes in the house of local architect Vigilio Rabaglio, who achieved fame by designing the Bourbon royal palace in Segovia in Spain. An archeological guide to the area notes that stones with Celtic bowl-shaped indentations, carried there by villagers in past centuries, can be seen in the walls and on doorsteps around the Church of San Vigilio.

=== Swiss Customs Museum ===

On the opposite side of the lake to Gandria village, but still within the Gandria quarter, is the Swiss Customs Museum. This was once a border post on the adjacent border with Italy, but now forms part of the Swiss National Museum. The museum covers the history of smuggling in the area, and the work of customs officers to counteract it. In a modern context, it covers the work of the Swiss Federal Customs Administration and the Swiss Border Guard.

== An international village ==

Today, Gandria is a mix of tradition and modernity. Many of 200 inhabitants who live there year-round are from families that go back for many generations. Others have arrived from various cantons of Switzerland as well as countries as diverse as Colombia, Germany, Haiti, Italy, Nicaragua, Palestine and the United States. Most people work in the nearby financial center of Lugano, although there is a tradition of architects, musicians, painters, ceramic makers and other artists in the village.

== Transport ==

Gandria village and its surrounding areas are connected to Lugano, and to Italy, by the main road that runs along the northern shore of Lake Lugano. This passes above the village centre, which, by virtue of its extremely narrow streets and steep gradients, is inaccessible to vehicles. In addition to the higher level road, it is also possible to walk from Gandria to Lugano and other surrounding villages via the publicly maintained lakeside &quot;Olive Path&quot; hewn into the rock in 1936.
A boat service between Gandria and other towns on the lake is provided by the Società Navigazione del Lago di Lugano (SNL) and is regular. The same company also operates a bus service between Gandria and Lugano.

The portion of Gandria on the south side of the lake, around Cantine di Gandria and the Swiss Customs Museum, has no roads. The shore-side footpath, which links the area to Caprino, is subject to rockfalls and not recommended for the inexperienced walker. The SNL provide several crossings a day from Gandria village (and central Lugano) to piers at both the Cantine di Gandria and the Customs Museum.

<doc id="298640" wikidata="Q899133" url="?curid=298640" title="Takeda Pharmaceutical Company">
<text>The is a Japanese multinational pharmaceutical company. It is the third largest pharmaceutical company in Asia, behind Sinopharm and Shanghai Pharmaceuticals, and one of the top 20 largest pharmaceutical companies in the world by revenue (top 10 following its merger with Shire). The company has over 49,578 employees worldwide and achieved US$19.299 billion in revenue during the 2018 fiscal year. The company is focused on oncology, rare diseases, neuroscience, gastroenterology, plasma-derived therapies and vaccines. Its headquarters is located in Chuo-ku, Osaka, and it has an office in Nihonbashi, Chuo, Tokyo. In January 2012, Fortune Magazine ranked the Takeda Oncology Company as one of the 100 best companies to work for in the United States. As of 2015, Christophe Weber was appointed as the CEO and president of Takeda.

== History ==
=== Founding and initial acquisitions (1781–2010) ===
Takeda Pharmaceuticals was founded in 1781, and was incorporated on January 29, 1925.

One of the firm&#x27;s mainstay drugs is Actos (pioglitazone), a compound in the thiazolidinedione class of drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It was launched in 1999.

In February 2005, Takeda acquired San Diego, California, based Syrrx, a company specializing in high-throughput X-ray crystallography, for US$270 million.

In February 2008, Takeda acquired the Japanese operations of Amgen and rights to a dozen of the California biotechnology company&#x27;s pipeline candidates for the Japanese market. In April, Takeda acquired Millennium Pharmaceuticals of Cambridge, Massachusetts, a company specializing in cancer drug research, for US$8.8 billion. The acquisition brought in Velcade, a drug indicated for hematological malignancies, as well as a portfolio of pipeline candidates in the oncology, inflammation, and cardiovascular therapeutic areas. Millennium now operates as an independent subsidiary. In May, the company licensed non-exclusively the RNAi technology platform developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, creating a potentially long-term partnership between the companies.

=== Further expansion and research (2011–present) ===
In September 2011, Takeda acquired Nycomed for €9.6 billion.

In May 2012, Takeda purchased Brazilian pharmaceutical company Multilab for R$540 million. In June, Takeda announced it would acquire URL Pharma, then run by the founder&#x27;s son Richard Roberts, for US$800 million.

In September 2014, Takeda announced it would team up with BioMotiv to identify and develop new compounds over a five-year period, worth approximately US$25 million. On 30 September 2014, Takeda announced it would expand a collaboration with MacroGenics, valued up to US$1.6 billion. The collaboration focused on the co-development of the preclinical autoimmune compound MGD010. MGD010 is a therapy which targets the B-cell surface proteins CD32B and CD79B, and is indicated for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

In 2015, Takeda sold its respiratory drugs business to AstraZeneca for $575 million (about £383 million), which included roflumilast and ciclesonide. On November, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Ixazomib developed by Takeda for use in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple myeloma after at least one prior therapy.

In December 2016, the company spun out its neuroscience research division into Cerevance, a joint venture along with Lightstone Ventures.

In February 2017, Takeda acquired Ariad Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion, expanding the company&#x27;s oncology and hematology divisions.

In January 2018, the company acquired stem cell therapy developer TiGenix for up to €520 million ($632 million).

In January 2019, Takeda acquired Shire for more than . In October, Takeda announced it had sold a portfolio of over-the-counter and prescription medicines in the Middle East and Africa to Swiss pharmaceuticals company Acino International for more than $200 million.

In January 2020, Takeda announced a research partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to advance discoveries in artificial intelligence and health. The MIT-Takeda Program is housed in the MIT Jameel Clinic, and is led by Professor James J. Collins, with a steering committee led by Professor Anantha P. Chandrakasan, dean of the MIT School of Engineering, and Anne Heatherington, senior vice president and head of Data Sciences Institute (DSI) at Takeda. In March 2020, Takeda announced that it has entered into an exclusive agreement to divest a portfolio of non-core products in Latin America to Hypera S.A. for a total value of $825 million.

In March 2021, the company announced it would acquire Maverick Therapeutics, Inc. and its two major programs TAK-186 (MVC-101) in trials for the treatment of EGFR-expressing tumours and TAK-280 (MVC-280) for use in the treatment of patients with B7H3-expressing tumors. In October, they acquired GammaDelta Therapeutics and its gamma delta (γδ) T cell immunotherapy programme.

In January 2022, Takeda announced it would exercise its option to acquire Adaptate Biotherapeutics and its antibody-based γδ T cell technology, reuniting Adaptate and its former parent company, GammaDelta Therapeutics, in a single organisation. In December of the same year, the company announced it would acquire Nimbus Lakshmi, Inc. and its lead compound NDI-034858 which is an allosteric TYK2 inhibitor, from Nimbus Therapeutics, LLC for up to $6 billion.

In February 2024, Takeda Pharmaceutical gained approval from the FDA for Eohilia, the first oral approval for allergic inflammation of the esophagus for patients 11 years and older. At the time of the announcement, the treatment Dupixent from Sanofi and Regeneron was the only alternative. 

In May 2024, Takeda announced it would be laying off 641 employees based in Massachusetts between July 2024 and March 2025 as part of a restructuring. It was expected to affect 495 people based in Cambridge and 146 people in Lexington.

=== TAP Pharmaceuticals (1977–2008) ===

In 1977, Takeda first entered the U.S. pharmaceutical market by developing a joint venture with Abbott Laboratories called TAP Pharmaceuticals. Through TAP Pharmaceuticals Takeda and Abbott launched blockbuster drugs Lupron (leuprorelin), in 1985, then Prevacid (lansoprazole), in 1995.

In 2001, TAP&#x27;s illegal marketing of Lupron resulted in both civil and criminal charges by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Illinois attorney general for federal and state medicare fraud. TAP was fined $875 million, then reported as the largest pharmaceutical settlement in history.

In March 2008, Takeda and Abbott Laboratories announced plans to conclude their 30-year-old joint venture, TAP Pharmaceuticals. The split resulted in Abbott acquiring U.S. rights to Lupron and the drug&#x27;s support staff. Takeda received rights to Prevacid and TAP&#x27;s pipeline candidates. The move also increased Takeda&#x27;s headcount by 3,000 employees.

== Divestments ==
In May 2019, Takeda sold its Xiidra dry-eye drug business to Novartis for $5.3 billion, $3.4 billion upfront and up-to $1.9 billion in sales milestones.

In November 2019, Takeda entered an agreement to sell its over-the-counter and prescription drugs businesses in Russia, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan to Stada Arzneimittel for $660 million.

In June 2020, Takeda announced that it was divesting 18 over-the-counter and prescription drugs marketed in the Asia-Pacific region to South Korea&#x27;s Celltrion in a deal worth $278 million.

Also in 2020, Takeda sold TachoSil to Corza Health, Inc. for €350 million.

== Locations ==
Takeda operates two primary bases in Japan in Osaka and Tokyo. Its United States subsidiary is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and all Global Operations outside Japan and the U.S. are based in Opfikon (Zurich), Switzerland.
The company maintains research and development sites in Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom and Singapore, with manufacturing facilities across the globe.

== Lawsuits ==
In April 2015 Takeda agreed to pay a settlement of $2.37 billion to an estimated 9,000 people who submitted claims alleging that pioglitazone was responsible for giving them bladder cancer. The company said the decision is expected to resolve the “vast majority” of these cases. Takeda will put the money into a settlement fund if 95 percent of plaintiffs agree to the accord, according to which each claimant would get an average $267,000. However, the exact amount for each plaintiff will be evaluated based on cumulative dosage, extent of injuries and history of smoking. In 2014, a plaintiff was awarded $9 billion in punitive damages after a federal court found Takeda hid the cancer risks of their diabetes medicine, but the amount was later reduced to $26 million by a judge who deemed the charge excessive.

== Public–private engagement ==

=== Activism ===
Takeda is a corporate partner of Human Rights Campaign, a large LGBT advocacy organization.

<text>Googlebot is the web crawler software used by Google that collects documents from the web to build a searchable index for the Google Search engine. This name is actually used to refer to two different types of web crawlers: a desktop crawler (to simulate desktop users) and a mobile crawler (to simulate a mobile user).

== Behavior ==

A website will probably be crawled by both Googlebot Desktop and Googlebot Mobile. However starting from September 2020, all sites were switched to mobile-first indexing, meaning Google is crawling the web using a smartphone Googlebot. The subtype of Googlebot can be identified by looking at the user agent string in the request. However, both crawler types obey the same product token (useent token) in robots.txt, and so a developer cannot selectively target either Googlebot mobile or Googlebot desktop using robots.txt.

Google provides various methods that enable website owners to manage the content displayed in Google&#x27;s search results. If a webmaster chooses to restrict the information on their site available to a Googlebot, or another spider, they can do so with the appropriate directives in a robots.txt file, or by adding the meta tag codice_1 to the web page. Googlebot requests to Web servers are identifiable by a user-agent string containing &quot;Googlebot&quot; and a host address containing &quot;googlebot.com&quot;. 

Currently, Googlebot follows HREF links and SRC links. There is increasing evidence Googlebot can execute JavaScript and parse content generated by Ajax calls as well. There are many theories regarding how advanced Googlebot&#x27;s ability is to process JavaScript, with opinions ranging from minimal ability derived from custom interpreters. Currently, Googlebot uses a web rendering service (WRS) that is based on the Chromium rendering engine (version 74 as on 7 May 2019). Googlebot discovers pages by harvesting every link on every page that it can find. Unless prohibited by a nofollow-tag, it then follows these links to other web pages. New web pages must be linked to from other known pages on the web in order to be crawled and indexed, or manually submitted by the webmaster.

A problem that webmasters with low-bandwidth Web hosting plans have often noted with the Googlebot is that it takes up an enormous amount of bandwidth. This can cause websites to exceed their bandwidth limit and be taken down temporarily. This is especially troublesome for mirror sites which host many gigabytes of data. Google provides &quot;Search Console&quot; that allow website owners to throttle the crawl rate.

How often Googlebot will crawl a site depends on the crawl budget. Crawl budget is an estimation of how typically a website is updated. Technically, Googlebot&#x27;s development team (Crawling and Indexing team) uses several defined terms internally to take over what &quot;crawl budget&quot; stands for. Since May 2019, Googlebot uses the latest Chromium rendering engine, which supports ECMAScript 6 features. This will make the bot a bit more &quot;evergreen&quot; and ensure that it is not relying on an outdated rendering engine compared to browser capabilities. 

== Mediabot ==
&quot;Mediabot&quot; is the web crawler that Google uses for analyzing the content so Google AdSense can serve contextually relevant advertising to a web page. Mediabot identifies itself with the user agent string &quot;Mediapartners-Google/2.1&quot;.

Unlike other crawlers, Mediabot does not follow links to discover new crawlable URLs, instead only visiting URLs that have included the AdSense code. Where that content resides behind a login, the crawler can be given a log in so that it is able to crawl protected content.

== Inspection Tool Crawlers==
&quot;InspectionTool&quot; is the crawler used by Search testing tools such as the Rich Result Test and URL inspection in Google Search Console. Apart from the user agent and user agent token, it mimics Googlebot.

A guide to the crawlers was independently published. It details four (4) distinctive crawler agents based on Web server directory index data - one (1) non-chrome and three (3) chrome crawlers.

<doc id="298647" wikidata="Q454833" url="?curid=298647" title="Scott McCloud">
<text>Scott McCloud (born Scott McLeod; June 10, 1960) is an American cartoonist and comics theorist. His non-fiction books about comics, &quot;Understanding Comics&quot; (1993), &quot;Reinventing Comics&quot; (2000), and &quot;Making Comics&quot; (2006), are made in comic form.

He became established as a comics creator in the 1980s as an independent superhero cartoonist and advocate for creator&#x27;s rights. He rose to prominence in the industry beginning in the 1990s for his non-fiction works about the medium; he has advocated for the use of new technology in the creation and distribution of comics.

==Early life==
McCloud was born in 1960 in Boston the youngest child of Willard Wise (a blind inventor and engineer) and Patricia Beatrice McLeod. He grew up mostly in Lexington, Massachusetts. He decided he wanted to be a comics artist in 1975, during his junior year in high school.

He attended an illustration program at Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York and graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1982.

==Career==
===Fiction===

During his high school years, he collaborated on comics with his schoolmate Kurt Busiek, who since has had a career as a successful comics writer. While still teenagers, the two of them along with fellow teenagers Christopher Bing, a 2001 Caldecott Medal winner, and Richard Howell created the first licensed Marvel/DC crossover comic &quot;Pow! Biff! Pops!&quot;, a one-shot sold in conjunction with a 1978 Boston Pops performance of comics-themed music.

While working as a production artist at DC Comics, McCloud created the light-hearted science fiction/superhero comic book series &quot;Zot!&quot; in 1984, in part as a reaction to the increasingly grim direction that superhero comics were taking in the 1980s. His other print comics include the 1986 black and white comic &quot;Destroy!!&quot; (a deliberately over-the-top, oversized single-issue comic book, intended as a parody of formulaic superhero fights), the 1998 graphic novel &quot;The New Adventures of Abraham Lincoln&quot; (done with a mixture of computer-generated and manually drawn digital images), 12 issues of DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Superman Adventures&quot; in the late 1990s, the 2005 three-issue series &quot;Superman: Strength&quot;, and the 2015 graphic novel &quot;The Sculptor&quot;.

In June, 2024, Raina Telgemeier announced a new book co-authored with McCloud, &quot;The Cartoonists Club&quot;, to be published in April 2025 by Scholastic&#x27;s Graphix imprint.

===Creator&#x27;s Bill of Rights===
McCloud was the principal author of the Creator&#x27;s Bill of Rights, a 1988 document with the stated aim of protecting the rights of comic book creators and helping aid against the exploitation of comic artists and writers by corporate work-for-hire practices. The group which adopted the Bill included artists Kevin Eastman, Dave Sim, and Stephen R. Bissette. The Bill included twelve rights; two of them are &quot;The right to full ownership of what we fully create,&quot; and &quot;The right to prompt payment of a fair and equitable share of profits derived from all of our creative work.&quot;

===24-hour comic===
In 1990, McCloud coined the idea of a 24-hour comic: a complete 24-page comic created by a single cartoonist in 24 consecutive hours. It was a mutual challenge with cartoonist Steve Bissette, intended to compel creative output with a minimum of self-restraining contemplation. Thousands of cartoonists have since taken up the challenge, including Neil Gaiman; Kevin Eastman, co-creator of &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;; Dave Sim, who published some of his work from this challenge in &quot;Cerebus the Aardvark&quot;; and Rick Veitch, who used it as a springboard for his comic &quot;Rarebit Fiends&quot;.

=== Non-fiction about comics ===

In the early 1990s, McCloud began creating a series of three books about the medium and business of comics, presented in comic form. The first one was &quot;Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art&quot;, published in 1993 and which established him as a popular comics theorist, described as the &quot;Aristotle of comics&quot; and the &quot;Marshall McLuhan of comics&quot;. The book was a wide-ranging exploration of the definition, history, vocabulary, and methods of the medium of comics; it is widely cited in academic discussions of the medium.

In 2000, McCloud published &quot;Reinventing Comics: How Imagination and Technology Are Revolutionizing an Art Form&quot;, in which he outlined twelve &quot;revolutions&quot; taking place, that he argued would be keys to the growth and success of comics as a popular and creative medium. He returned to focus on the medium itself in 2006 with &quot;Making Comics: Storytelling Secrets of Comics, Manga, and Graphic Novels&quot;, an instructional guide to the process of producing comics, which he followed with a promotional lecture tour (with his family) of all 50 U.S. states and parts of Europe.

In November 2022, McCloud was working on a third draft of layouts for an upcoming book on visual communication. He has described the book as &quot;a preposterously ambitious full color project covering the evolution and biology of vision, principles of visual perception, demonstrations of how visual elements behave in the mind&#x27;s eye; best practices for clarity, explanation, and effective rhetoric; and some personal reflections on [my] family&#x27;s experiences with blindness.&quot;

=== Technology ===
Beginning in the late 1990s, McCloud was an early advocate of micropayments. He was an adviser to BitPass, a company which provided an online micropayment system. He helped launch it with the publication of &quot;The Right Number&quot;, an online graphic novella priced at a quarter for each chapter.

Among the techniques he explores is the &quot;infinite canvas&quot; permitted by a web browser, allowing panels to be spatially arranged in ways not possible in the finite, two-dimensional, paged format of a physical book. Google commissioned him in 2008 to create a comic serving as the press release introducing their web browser Chrome.

== Personal life ==
McCloud lives in Newbury Park, California. In 1988, he married Ivy Ratafia; they had two daughters together. Ivy died in a car accident in April 2022.

<text>The Reformed Church in America (RCA) is a mainline Reformed Protestant denomination in Canada and the United States. It has about 82,865 members. From its beginning in 1628 until 1819, it was the North American branch of the Dutch Reformed Church.

The RCA is a founding member of the National Council of Churches, the World Council of Churches (WCC), Christian Churches Together, and the World Communion of Reformed Churches (WCRC). Some parts of the denomination belong to the National Association of Evangelicals, the Canadian Council of Churches, and the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada. The denomination is in full communion with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Presbyterian Church (USA), and United Church of Christ and is a denominational partner of the Christian Reformed Church in North America.

==Names==
The Reformed Church in America is sometimes colloquially referred to as the Dutch Reformed Church in America, or simply as the Dutch Reformed Church when an American context has already been provided. In 1819, it incorporated as the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church. The current name was chosen in 1867.

==History==
===17th century===

The early settlers in the Dutch colony of New Netherland first held informal meetings for worship. 

In 1628, Jonas Michaelius organized the first Dutch Reformed congregation in New Amsterdam, now New York City, called the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church, now The Collegiate Churches of New York. During Dutch rule, the RCA was the established church of the colony and was under the authority of the classis of Amsterdam. The Brookville Reformed Church remains one of the oldest churches in America. 

===18th century===
Even after the English captured the colony in 1664, all Dutch Reformed ministers were still trained in the Netherlands. Services in the RCA remained in Dutch until 1764.

In 1747, the church in the Netherlands had given permission to form an assembly in North America; in 1754, the assembly declared itself independent of the classis of Amsterdam. This American classis secured a charter in 1766 for Queens College (now Rutgers University) in New Jersey. In 1784 John Henry Livingston was appointed as professor of theology, marking the beginning of the New Brunswick Theological Seminary.

The Dutch-speaking community, including farmers and traders, prospered in the former New Netherlands, dominating New York City, the Hudson Valley, and parts of New Jersey while maintaining a significant presence in southeastern Pennsylvania, southwestern Connecticut, and Long Island.

In the early 18th century nearly 3,000 Palatine German refugees came to New York. Most worked first in English camps along the Hudson River to pay off their passage, paid by Queen Anne&#x27;s government, before they were allowed land in the Schoharie and Mohawk Valleys. They created numerous German-speaking Lutheran and Reformed churches, such as those at Fort Herkimer and German Flatts. Thousands more immigrated to Pennsylvania in the 18th century. They used German as the language in their churches and schools for nearly 100 years, and recruited some of their ministers from Germany. By the early 20th century, most of their churches had joined the RCA.

During the American Revolution, a bitter internal struggle broke out in the Dutch Reformed church, with lines of division following ecclesiastical battles that had gone on for twenty years between the &quot;coetus&quot; and &quot;conferentie&quot; factions. One source indicates that defections may have occurred as early as 1737. 

&quot;Desolation pervaded many of the churches, whereas prior to 1737 good order was maintained in the churches, and peace and a good degree of prosperity were enjoyed. ...But in 1754, the Coetus of the previous year, having recommended the changing of the Coetus into a Classis with full powers, the opposition became violent, and the opponents were known as the Conferentie.&quot;A spirit of amnesty made possible the church&#x27;s survival after the war. The divisiveness was also healed when the church sent members on an extensive foreign missions program in the early 19th century.

In 1792, the classis adopted a formal constitution; and in 1794 the denomination held its first general synod. Following the American Civil War, in 1867 it formally adopted the name &quot;Reformed Church in America&quot;. In the nineteenth century in New York and New Jersey, ethnic Dutch descendants struggled to preserve their European standards and traditions while developing a taste for revivalism and an American identity.

===19th century===

Some members owned slaves, the most famous of the slaves being Sojourner Truth, and the church did not support abolitionism. In rural areas, ministers preached in Dutch until about 1830–1850, then switched to English, at the same time finally dropping the use of many traditional Dutch clothing and customs. Although some ministers favored revivals, generally the church did not support either the First or the Second Great Awakenings, which created much evangelical fervor.

Dutch language use faded thereafter until the new wave of Dutch immigration in the mid-19th century. This revived use of the language among Dutch descendants and in some churches.

===Midwestern United States===
Immigration from the Netherlands in the mid-19th century led to the expansion of the RCA into the Midwestern United States. In 1837, Pastor Abram D. Wilson and his wife Julia Evertson Wilson from New Jersey established the first Dutch Reformed church west of the Allegheny Mountains in Fairview, Illinois. Hope College and Western Theological Seminary were founded in Holland, Michigan, Central College in Pella, Iowa, and Northwestern College in Orange City, Iowa. In the 1857 Secession, a group of more conservative members in Michigan led by Gijsbert Haan separated from the RCA. They organized the Christian Reformed Church in North America (CRC), and other churches followed. In 1882 another group of congregations left for the CRC, mirroring developments in the church in the Netherlands.

===Post-World War II===
After 1945, the RCA expanded into Canada, which was the destination of a large group of Dutch emigrants. Between 1949 and 1958, the RCA opened 120 churches among non-Dutch suburban communities, appealing to mainline Protestants. It was a charter member of the Presbyterian Alliance, the Federal Council of Churches, and the World Council of Churches.

=== Recent decline ===
Like most other mainline denominations, the RCA has had a declining membership during the last thirty years. In 2024, the total membership was less than 84,000, down from 196,308 in 2018, from 220,000 in 2016, from 300,000 in 2000, and 360,000 in 1980.

Due to differences related to the adoption of the Belhar Confession, the removal of the conscience clauses related to the ordination of women, and place of LGBTQ people in the church, a number of congregations have left the RCA to join the Presbyterian Church in America, which is more conservative on these issues. For largely the same reasons, about 100 churches separated (with 65 making the matter public originally) from the denomination and formed the Alliance of Reformed Churches (the denomination now has roughly 200 churches), Twelve churches formed the Reformation Canada Network, and 5 formed the Kingdom Network (which currently has 24 churches).

==Beliefs==
The RCA confesses several statements of doctrine and faith. These include the historic Apostles&#x27; Creed, Nicene Creed, and Athanasian Creed; the traditional Reformed Belgic Confession, the Heidelberg Catechism (with its compendium), the Canons of Dort, and the Belhar Confession.

===Life issues===
The RCA opposes euthanasia. The report of the Commission on Christian Action, issued in 1994, states, &quot;What Christians say about issues of morality ought to be and usually is a reflection of their fundamental faith convictions. There are at least three of these convictions that appear especially relevant to the question of whether it is acceptable for Christians to seek a physician&#x27;s assistance in committing suicide in the midst of extreme suffering./ A fundamental conviction Christians have is that they do not belong to themselves. Life, despite its circumstances, is a gift from God, and each individual is its steward... Contemporary arguments for the &#x27;right&#x27; to assistance to commit suicide are based on ideas of each individual&#x27;s autonomy over his or her life. Christians cannot claim such autonomy; Christians acknowledge that they belong to God... Christians yield their personal autonomy and accept a special obligation, as the first answer of the Heidelberg Catechism invites people to confess: &#x27;I am not my own, but belong—body and soul, in life and in death—to my faithful Savior, Jesus Christ&#x27; (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&amp;A 1)... A decision to take one&#x27;s own life thus appears to be a denial that one belongs to God./ A second conviction is that God does not abandon people in times of suffering... Christians express their faith in God&#x27;s love by trusting in God&#x27;s care for them. A decision to end one&#x27;s life would appear to be a cessation of that trust... Suffering calls upon people to trust God even in the valley of the shadow of death. It calls on people to let God, and not suffering, determine the agenda of their life and their death./ A third conviction is that in the community of God&#x27;s people, caring for those who are dying is a burden Christians are willing to share. Both living and dying should occur within a caring community, and in the context of death, Christian discipleship takes the form of caring for those who are dying./ This is an era when many people find legislating morality a questionable practice. Should Christians promote legislation which embodies their conclusions about the morality of physician-assisted suicide?... If Christians are to be involved in debating laws regulating assisted suicide, it will be out of a concern for the health and well-being of society... As a society, there is no common understanding that gives any universal meaning to &#x27;detrimental&#x27;. In humility, Christians can simply acknowledge this, and proceed...to share our own unique perspectives, inviting others to consider them and the faith that gives them meaning.&quot;

The Reformed Church also condemns the death penalty. The General Synod in 2000 expressed seven reasons why the Church opposes it:

* Capital punishment is incompatible with the Spirit of Christ and the ethic of love. The law of love does not negate justice, but it does nullify the motives of vengeance and retribution by forcing us to think in terms of redemption, rehabilitation, and reclamation. The Christ who refused to endorse the stoning of the woman taken in adultery would have us speak to the world of compassion, not vengeance.
* Capital punishment is of doubtful value as a deterrent. The capital punishment as a deterrent argument assumes a criminal will engage in a kind of rational, cost-benefit analysis before he or she commits murder. Most murders, however, are crimes of passion or are committed under the influence of drugs or alcohol. This does not excuse the perpetrator of responsibility for the crime, but it does show that in most cases capital punishment as a deterrent won&#x27;t work.
* Capital punishment results in inequities of application. Numerous studies since 1965 have shown that racial factors play a significant role in determining whether or not a person receives a sentence of death.
* Capital punishment is a method open to irremediable mistakes. The increasing number of innocent defendants being found on death row is a clear sign that the process for sentencing people to death is fraught with fundamental errors—errors which cannot be remedied once an execution occurs.
* Capital punishment ignores corporate and community guilt. Such factors may diminish but certainly do not destroy the responsibility of the individual. Yet society also bears some responsibility for directing efforts and resources toward correcting those conditions that may foster such behavior.
* Capital punishment perpetuates the concepts of vengeance and retaliation. As an agency of society, the state should not become an avenger for individuals; it should not presume the authority to satisfy divine justice by vengeful methods.
* Capital punishment ignores the entire concept of rehabilitation. The Christian faith should be concerned not with retribution, but with redemption. Any method which closes the door to all forgiveness, and to any hope of redemption, cannot stand the test of our faith.

The General Synod resolution expressed its will &quot;to urge members of the Reformed Church in America to contact their elected officials, urging them to advocate for the abolition of capital punishment and to call for an immediate moratorium on executions.&quot;

The RCA is generally opposed to abortion. The position of the General Synod, stated in 1973 and later affirmed, has been that &quot;in principle&quot; abortion &quot;should not be practiced at all&quot;, but in a &quot;complex society&quot; of competing evils there &quot;could be exceptions&quot;. However, abortion should never be chosen as a matter of &quot;individual convenience&quot;. The church personnel should promote &quot;Christian alternatives to abortion&quot;, and church members are asked to &quot;support efforts for constitutional changes&quot; to protect the unborn.

===Homosexuality===
Since 1978 the General Synod has made a number of statements on homosexuality. Homosexual acts are considered sinful and &quot;contrary to the will of God&quot;. But homosexuals are not to be blamed for their condition. The church must affirm civil rights for homosexuals while it condemns homosexual behavior (1978). The church must seek to lift the homosexual&#x27;s &quot;burden of guilt&quot;, recognizing that homosexuality is a &quot;complex phenomenon&quot; (1979). The church should encourage &quot;love and sensitivity towards such persons as fellow human beings&quot; (1990). In 1994 the Synod condemned the humiliation and degradation of homosexuals and confessed that many members had not listened to the &quot;heartfelt cries&quot; of homosexual persons struggling for &quot;self-acceptance and dignity.&quot; While calling for compassion, patience, and loving support toward those who struggle with same-sex desires, the 2012 General Synod determined that it is a &quot;disciplinable offense&quot; to advocate for homosexual behavior or provide leadership for a service of a same-sex marriage. The following year, however, the General Synod essentially rescinded this statement and rebuked the 2012 delegates for demonstrating &quot;a lack of decorum and civility,&quot; and usurping constitutional authority. In 2014, the General Synod recommended that the Commission on Church Order begin the process of defining marriage as heterosexual. However, in 2015, the General Synod approved a process for studying a way &quot;to address the questions of human sexuality&quot;. Also in 2015, Hope College in Michigan, affiliated with the RCA, officially provided benefits to employees&#x27; same-sex spouses though the school continues to maintain a statement on sexuality that espouses a traditional definition of marriage.

Additionally, a number of congregations and classes have voted to publicly affirm LGBT members, including the Classis of New Brunswick and the Classis of Schenectady. Several of those congregations, including congregations dually affiliated with the RCA and United Church of Christ, perform same-sex marriages. &quot;Some RCA churches have gay pastors, but their ordination is from other denominations&quot;. On 5 May 2017, the United Church of Christ and Reformed Church in America congregations that support LGBT inclusion announced the formation of an association for dually-affiliated congregations.

In April 2016, a working committee of the RCA developed a report on human sexuality. The report offers different options, for review by the General Synod, and includes the option to define marriage as between a man and woman or to define marriage as between two persons thus allowing same-gender marriages. Of these options, General Synod 2016 voted to define marriage as &quot;man/woman&quot;. However, that vote needed to receive the support of 2/3 of the classes and be ratified again in 2017.

In March 2017, the proposal to define marriage as &quot;man/woman&quot; did not receive the necessary votes from 2/3 of the classes, and, as a result, it did not pass. On 12 June 2017, the General Synod voted for a &quot;recommendation [which] says, &#x27;faithful adherence to the RCA&#x27;s Standards, therefore, entails the affirmation that marriage is between one man and one woman.&#x27;&quot; Also, in 2017, a classis in the RCA ordained the first openly gay and married pastor who had declared himself as such when he began the ordination process.

In 2021, the RCA&#x27;s General Synod voted in favor of a plan to allow congregations to leave the denomination, with their properties, and to allow remaining RCA congregations to choose their policy on LGBTQ clergy and same-sex marriages with some supporting same-sex marriages and some opposing.

===Women&#x27;s ordination===
The RCA first admitted women to the offices of deacon and elder in 1972 and first ordained women in 1979. By 1980 the General Synod of the RCA amended the Book of Church Order (BCO) to clarify their position on women&#x27;s ordination, including amending the language of Part I, Article 1, Section 3 of the BCO from &quot;persons&quot; to &quot;men and women&quot;.

In 1980, the RCA added a conscience clause to the BCO stating, &quot;If individual members of the classis find that their consciences, as illuminated by Scripture, would not permit them to participate in the licensure, ordination or installation of women as ministers of the Word, they shall not be required to participate in decisions or actions contrary to their consciences, but may not obstruct the classis in fulfilling its responsibility to arrange for the care, ordination, and installation of women candidates and ministers by means mutually agreed on by such women and the classis&quot; (Part II, Article 2, Section 7).

In 2012, by a vote of 143 to 69, the General Synod of the RCA voted to remove the conscience clauses. However, the vote by the General Synod had to be approved by a majority of the classes (a classis serving the same function as a presbytery). Eventually, 31 classes voted in favor of removal, with 14 voting to retain them, and the vote was ratified at the RCA&#x27;s 2013 General Synod.

==Polity==
The RCA has a presbyterian polity where authority is divided among representative bodies: consistories, classes, regional synods, and the General Synod. The General Synod meets annually and is the representative body of the entire denomination, establishing its policies, programs, and agenda. Measures passed at General Synod are executed and overseen by the General Synod Council. Council members are appointed by the General Synod. A General Secretary oversees day-to-day operations. The Rev. Eddy Alemán, D. Min., was installed as the General Secretary at the 2018 General Synod.

The Constitution of the RCA consists of three parts: the Liturgy, the Government, and the Doctrinal Standards. The Government, along with the Formularies and the By-laws of the General Synod, are published annually in a volume known as &quot;The Book of Church Order&quot;.

;Certification agencies
*Students who do not attend or receive their Master of Divinity degree from one of the two seminaries operated by the RCA are certified and credentialed for ministry in the RCA through the Ministerial Formation Certification Agency in Paramount, California.

==Ecumenical relations==
Through a document known as &quot;A Formula of Agreement&quot;, the RCA has full communion with the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the United Church of Christ, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The relationship between the United Church of Christ and the RCA has been the subject of controversy within the RCA, particularly a resolution by the UCC General Synod in 2005 regarding homosexuality. The ELCA&#x27;s affirmation of the ordination of homosexuals as clergy in 2009 prompted some RCA conservatives to call for a withdrawal from the &quot;Formula of Agreement&quot;. In 2012 RCA discussed its own position regarding homosexuality. The two denominations undertook a dialogue and in 1999 produced a document discussing their differences (PDF).

Along with their &quot;Formula of Agreement &quot;partners, the RCA retains close fellowship with the Christian Reformed Church in North America (CRC). In 2005 the RCA and CRC voted to allow for the exchange of ministers. Faith Alive Christian Resources, the CRC&#x27;s publishing arm, is also used by the RCA and in 2013 published a joint hymnal for use in both denominations. The two denominations have also collaborated on various other ministry ventures, voted to merge pension plans in 2013 in conformity with the Affordable Care Act, and plan to hold back-to-back General Synods at Central College in Pella, Iowa, in 2014.

<text>The United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (UPCUSA) was the largest branch of Presbyterianism in the United States from May 28, 1958, to 1983. It was formed by the union of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA), often referred to as the &quot;Northern&quot; Presbyterian Church, with the United Presbyterian Church of North America (UPCNA), a smaller church of Covenanter-Seceder tradition at a conference in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in May 1958. Vigorous ecumenical activity on the part of PCUSA leaders led to this merger, something of a reunion of two long-separated branches of the larger Presbyterian family deriving from the British Isles.

==Background==
Between 1937 and 1955, both the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, and the United Presbyterian Church of North America had been looking to merge with Reformed Churches. The PCUSA had discussed a merger with the Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS), as well as with the Episcopal Church. Both denominations had also been in contact with the Reformed Church in America, as well as the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church.

==History==
By the time of the merger, the PCUSA had churches in all 50 states, while the heaviest concentration of UPCNA congregations could be found in Western Pennsylvania and parts of Ohio. One institutional expression of the union was the consolidation of two nearby seminaries into the new Pittsburgh Theological Seminary.

As had been customary for centuries, the UPCUSA originally held solely to the Westminster Confession of Faith and catechisms. But, one of the details of the 1958 merger was to revise the Westminster Confession. Realizing that the task of revising the Westminster Confession was too much of a burden and potentially divisive, the commission developed a new confession. Known as the Confession of 1967, it was heavily influenced by neo-orthodoxy. The commission also added several other confessional standards to what was called the Book of Confessions.

Furthermore, the UPCUSA revised its ordination vows. Prior to 1967, the ordination vows required an affirmative to this question: &quot;Do you sincerely receive and adopt the Confession of Faith and Catechisms of this Church as containing the system of doctrine taught in Holy Scripture?&quot; After 1967, the ordination vows read: &quot;Do you sincerely receive and adopt the essential tenets of the Reformed Faith as expressed in the confession of our church as authentic and reliable expositions of what Scripture leads us to believe and do, and will you be instructed and led by those confessions as you lead the people of God?&quot; Despite strong opposition from conservative evangelicals, much of which dovetailed with their hostility toward the denomination&#x27;s perceived focus on social action that the Confession of 1967 in particular appeared to endorse, nine-tenths of the presbyteries approved the new documents.

==Social stances and ecumenism==
Generally speaking, the UPCUSA, especially its leadership, was a strong supporter of progressive causes, such as civil rights and feminism. Eugene Carson Blake, who served as the stated clerk of the UPCUSA from 1954 until 1966, was particularly active in the civil rights movement, including partaking in the August 28, 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, with Martin Luther King Jr. The following year, the UPCUSA took an unprecedented step in electing Edler Garnet Hawkins (1908-1977), an African American, who had served as pastor of St. Augustine Presbyterian Church, as moderator, a position which he filled until 1970. However, despite the progressive views of many members, a scandal erupted in 1970 and 1971 when the denomination gave $25,000 to defend the Black Panthers and $10,000 to the Angela Davis Defense Fund. Katie Cannon was ordained on April 24, 1974, in Shelby, North Carolina, by the Catawba Presbytery, in the Synod of Catawba, becoming the first African-American woman to be ordained in the UPCUSA.

==Ecumenical endeavors==
In December 1960, UPCUSA stated clerk, Eugene Blake, preached a sermon at Grace Cathedral [Episcopal Church] in San Francisco, in which he laid down the plan for uniting UPCUSA, The Methodist Church (USA), the Episcopal Church and the United Church of Christ. Following Blake&#x27;s lead, the 1961 General Assembly sent invitations to the Presbyterian Church in the United States, the Methodists, the Episcopalians, and the United Church of Christ, beginning what was called the “Consultation on Church Union,” but would be eventually renamed the “Churches of Christ Uniting”. The UPCUSA was also part of both the National Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches, the latter of which Blake would become the General Secretary of in 1966.

==Controversies and departures==
Despite being the largest Presbyterian body in the United States, controversies and schisms would soon shake the UPCUSA, which would lead to the exodus of several well-known congregations and members.

In keeping with the practice of the PC-USA (which the PC-USA had begun in 1956) the UPCUSA continued the ordination of women. When the union between the UPCNA and the PC-USA occurred in 1958, it was understood that the new denomination would permit, but not require female ministers However, in 1974, Walter W. Kenyon, a student at the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, informed his presbytery that, while he would be willing to work with female ministers, or not impede their ordination, he would not participate in their installation. While his ordination was narrowly approved, it was overturned by the Permanent Judicial Commission of the General Assembly the following year, with the commission stating that it was the denomination&#x27;s responsibility to refuse ordination to those who did not theologically accept the ordination of women, as the General Assembly had no power to grant the presbytery an exception to an already explicit constitutional provision. Furthermore, in 1979, the General Assembly ruled that all congregations must elect both men and women to the office of ruling elder. The ruling resulted in an exodus of approximately forty congregations, including Tenth Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, which would eventually realign with the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod.

In 1976, the New York Presbytery petitioned the General Assembly asking for advice over what to do about a candidate who was a homosexual, yet who was otherwise qualified for ministry. A task force was assigned and came back with the proposal that the question should be up to the discretion of the presbyteries. However, after lobbying from the Presbyterians United for Biblical Concerns, the majority report was rejected by the General Assembly, which voted overwhelmingly to affirm instead that “unrepentant homosexual practice does not accord with the requirements of ordination as set forth in the &quot;Book of Church Order&quot;.&quot;

Another controversy rocked the UPCUSA when the National Capital Union presbytery voted to receive a minister by the name of Mansfield Kaseman, a move that was upheld by the 1981 General Assembly. Ordained in the United Church of Christ, Kaseman declined to affirm straightforwardly the deity of Christ, His sinless nature and the bodily resurrection. This case resulted in a further wave of departures from the UPCUSA, including those who founded the Evangelical Presbyterian Church, along with longtime Pittsburgh Seminary professor John Gerstner.

==Reunion of the UPCUSA and the PCUS==
As the UPCUSA continued its more liberal shift, talks had begun regarding a merger between the UPCUSA and the Presbyterian Church in the United States, who had split from the main Presbyterian Church in the United States of America in 1861 due to the Civil War. Initially committed to “Old School” Presbyterianism, the PCUS had been beginning a shift towards liberalism in the 1950s and 1960s, including allowing the ordination of women in 1964.

While there had been a failed attempt to merge the UPCUSA and the PCUS in 1954, there had been increased cooperation between the two denominations, including joint foreign mission boards, a new hymnal in 1955, union presbyteries in 1968, and in 1970, the so-called “Plan of Union” was drafted. With the December 1973 creation of the National Presbyterian Church, which would soon be renamed the Presbyterian Church in America, which led to an exodus of conservatives from the PCUS, plans for union accelerated, and were also hastened, albeit less decisively, by the creation of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church by conservatives leaving the UPCUSA in 1981.

In 1983, the vote was finally held regarding the merger, with a unanimous 151 presbyteries in the UPCUSA affirming it, and the PCUS affirming it 53 to 8. On June 10, 1983, the first General Assembly was held for the new denomination, which would be called the Presbyterian Church (USA).

==Notable members==
Prominent leaders and theologians from the period included Eugene Carson Blake, Robert McAfee Brown, Lloyd John Ogilvie, William Sloane Coffin, and David H. C. Read. Among its members was President Dwight Eisenhower.

<doc id="298658" wikidata="Q57468" url="?curid=298658" title="Prince Louis of Battenberg">
<text>Louis Alexander Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Milford Haven (24 May 185411 September 1921), formerly Prince Louis Alexander of Battenberg, was a British naval officer and German prince related by marriage to the British royal family.

Although born in Austria, and brought up in Italy and Germany, Louis enrolled in the British Royal Navy at the age of fourteen. Queen Victoria and her son the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) occasionally intervened in his career: the Queen thought that there was &quot;a belief that the Admiralty are afraid of promoting Officers who are Princes on account of the radical attacks of low papers and scurrilous ones&quot;. However, Louis welcomed assignments that provided opportunities for him to acquire the skills of war and to demonstrate to his superiors that he was serious about his naval career. Posts on royal yachts and tours arranged by Queen Victoria and Prince Edward actually impeded his progress, as his promotions were perceived as undeserved royal favours.

After a naval career lasting more than forty years, in 1912 Louis was appointed First Sea Lord, the professional head of the British naval service. With the First World War looming, he took steps to ready the British fleet for combat, but his background as a German prince forced his retirement once the war began, when anti-German sentiment was running high. He changed his name and relinquished his German titles, at the behest of King George V, in 1917. The King made Louis Marquess of Milford Haven.

Louis married Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. They had four children: Alice, Louise, George, and Louis. Louise later became Queen of Sweden, while the younger Louis served as First Sea Lord, like his father, from 1954 to 1959. The Marquess and Marchioness of Milford Haven were the maternal grandparents of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

==Early life==

Louis Alexander of Battenberg was born in Graz, Styria, on 24 May 1854, the eldest son of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine by his morganatic marriage to Countess Julia von Hauke. Because of his morganatic parentage, Louis did not inherit his father&#x27;s rank in the Grand Duchy of Hesse; and, from birth, his style of &quot;Illustrious Highness&quot; and title of Count of Battenberg instead derived from the rank given to his mother at the time of her marriage. On 26 December 1858, he automatically became &quot;His Serene Highness&quot; Prince Louis of Battenberg when his mother was elevated to Princess of Battenberg with the style of &quot;Serene Highness&quot;, by decree of her husband&#x27;s brother, Louis III, Grand Duke of Hesse.

Shortly after Louis&#x27;s birth, his father was stationed with the Austro-Hungarian Army in Northern Italy during the Second Italian War of Independence. Louis&#x27;s early years were spent either in the north of Italy or at Prince Alexander&#x27;s two houses in Hesse, the castle of Heiligenberg in Jugenheim, and the Alexander Palace in Darmstadt. Because his mother spoke French to him and he had an English governess, he grew up trilingual.

Among the visitors entertained at Heiligenberg were Battenberg&#x27;s relations, the Russian imperial family and his cousin, Prince Louis of Hesse. Influenced by his cousin&#x27;s wife, Princess Alice, a daughter of Queen Victoria, and by Prince Alfred, another of Queen Victoria&#x27;s children, Battenberg became a naturalised British subject and joined the Royal Navy on 3 October 1868 at age fourteen. He was admitted by the Board of Admiralty without the production of a medical certificate, which was contrary to the usual regulation. He had been found medically unfit &quot;on account of small, flat chest, slight lateral curvature of the spine and defective vision&quot;, but was allowed to join so as not to disappoint the Queen. He was entered as a naval cadet aboard , Nelson&#x27;s old flagship, then used as a permanently moored receiving ship.

In January of the following year, the Prince and Princess of Wales cruised the Mediterranean and Black Seas in the frigate ; and the Prince of Wales requested that Louis be appointed to the vessel, before his training was complete. As part of the same tour, Louis accompanied them on a visit to Egypt, where they visited the construction site of the Suez Canal. As was traditional, the Khedive, Isma&#x27;il Pasha, bestowed honours on the party, with Louis receiving the Medjidie (4th Class); in April, he received the Osmanie (4th Class) from the Ottoman Sultan.

==Early naval career==
Louis returned to Britain in May 1869. In June he joined , the flagship of the North America and West Indies Station, becoming a midshipman in October. From June to September 1870 he took leave in Germany, coinciding with the Franco-Prussian war, but he spent the next three-and-a-half years in the Americas (Bermuda and Halifax, Nova Scotia), where his tour of duty served to make up for the training he had missed while posted with the Prince of Wales on the &quot;Ariadne&quot;. Returning to Europe in early 1874, he was placed on the books of at Portsmouth, and passed the sub-lieutenant&#x27;s examinations—gaining the best marks ever recorded at seamanship and joint best-ever at gunnery.

In 1875, again at the invitation of the Prince of Wales, he joined , which conducted the Prince on an official tour of India, 1875–76. Louis sketched some of the events of the tour and his drawings were published in the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;. He was promoted to lieutenant on 15 May 1876. The Prince asked Louis to stay with him at Marlborough House for the summer of 1876, but wishing to gain further experience at sea, Louis instead accepted an offer to join Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, as a lieutenant on board . In addition to acting as the Duke&#x27;s equerry, Louis continued his naval duties. He did not enjoy the position, as the Duke was rather touchy and Louis&#x27;s cabin was infested with rats, one of which he caught with his bare hands as it ran across his chest as he lay in bed. The &quot;Sultan&quot; toured the Mediterranean from July 1876.

In late February–early March 1878, Louis was still serving on the &quot;Sultan&quot; as it lay in the Bosphorus during the Russo-Turkish War. He was criticised for visiting his brother, Prince Alexander, who was serving with the Russian forces, but an investigation cleared both Louis and Alexander, as well as Prince Alfred, of any wrongdoing. For the next two years Louis served on and on the Royal Yacht, , but in October 1879 he refused further service on the Royal Yacht, saying it was damaging his professional career, and requested half-pay until he could be given an active duty. On 17 February 1880 he, his father, and Tsar Alexander II witnessed an explosion at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, when Stephen Chalturin unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate the Tsar with dynamite beneath the great dining room.

On 24 August 1880, Louis was posted to , the flagship of the Flying Squadron, which included on which Princes Albert Victor and George were serving. The ship sailed to South America, South Africa, Australia, Fiji, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Singapore and the Dutch East Indies, before returning to South Africa in April 1882. Seven months after Louis left Britain on the voyage, actress Lillie Langtry allegedly bore him an illegitimate daughter, Jeanne Marie. Langtry was also a one-time mistress of the Prince of Wales. Jeanne Marie&#x27;s parentage was never completely verified, but Louis made a financial settlement nonetheless.

From South Africa the &quot;Inconstant&quot; sailed to St Helena, and the Cape Verde Islands, where the squadron received orders to proceed to Gibraltar, and from there to Malta and Egypt to take part in the Anglo-Egyptian War. On 11 July 1882, Alexandria was bombarded and in the next two weeks Louis served in the Flying Squadron delivering shells and ammunition to the battle fleet, and then as a guard to the Khedive at Ras Al Teen Palace. He was decorated with the Egypt War Medal by Queen Victoria personally.

In November 1882, he left the &quot;Inconstant&quot;, spent Christmas in Darmstadt, and in March the following year visited his younger brother, Prince Alexander, in Bulgaria. Alexander had been made Sovereign Prince of Bulgaria in 1879 with the approval of Europe&#x27;s Great Powers. Louis accompanied his brother on a state visit to Turkey, and then on a tour of Cyprus and the Holy Land with the Turkish navy, during which Louis was appalled at the lack of seamanship—the Turkish captains were unable to navigate and had to hug the coast so as not to get lost; when they did leave the coast they became so disoriented that they were unable to steer for Jaffa. On its return journey the ship on which they had travelled ran aground.

==Marriage and family==
In September 1883, Queen Victoria appointed him to her yacht, . On 30 April 1884 at Darmstadt in the presence of the Queen, Prince Louis married her granddaughter, Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine. His wife was the eldest daughter of Queen Victoria&#x27;s second daughter Princess Alice and Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse. Through the Hesse family, Prince and Princess Louis of Battenberg were first cousins once removed. They had known each other since childhood, and invariably spoke English to each other. As wedding presents Louis received the British Order of the Bath and the Star and Chain of the Hessian Order of Louis.

Louis and Victoria had four children:

In 1885, one of Louis&#x27;s younger brothers, Prince Henry of Battenberg, married Princess Beatrice, the youngest child of Queen Victoria, and took up residence with the Queen in Britain so that Beatrice could continue to serve as her mother&#x27;s companion and personal secretary.

==Commander==
On his penultimate day aboard the Queen&#x27;s yacht, 30 August 1885, Louis was promoted to the rank of commander. The next four years were spent in the shore establishments and on half-pay, on HMS &quot;Cambridge&quot;, very briefly at Milford Haven in August 1886, and on board in the Mediterranean. Irish nationalist Member of Parliament (MP) Willie Redmond and Liberal MP Charles Conybeare both questioned Battenberg&#x27;s appointment to &quot;Dreadnought&quot; in the British House of Commons. Conybeare asked, &quot;What special qualifications have entitled a foreigner to be promoted over the heads of some 30 British officers?&quot; First Lord of the Admiralty Lord George Hamilton said, &quot;Captain Stephenson, who commands the &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, applied for Prince Louis of Battenberg to fill the appointment. I may add that another officer who is about to command a large iron-clad in the Mediterranean has made a similar application.&quot; He added that 22 commanders junior to Battenberg held similar appointments, and that Battenberg was a naturalised British subject. Another Liberal MP, Edward Pickersgill, backed up by Conybeare and Irish nationalist Charles Tanner, questioned the propriety of Battenberg&#x27;s appointment to the Navy in 1868, given Battenberg&#x27;s failure to get the required medical certificate, and suggested that he only got in the Navy because of royal favour.

On 3 October 1889, Battenberg was appointed to his first independent command, , a torpedo-cruiser, which saw service in the Red Sea.

==Captain==
On 31 December 1891, Prince Louis was promoted to the rank of captain. At the beginning of the following year, he was appointed naval advisor to the inspector-general of fortifications. His role was to act as a liaison between the navy and the army in order to ensure a co-ordinated defence. Traditionally, there was a great deal of friction between the two services, but Louis exercised his social skills in the role, leading Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, to write to him, &quot;You have produced a mutual feeling of goodwill and unanimity which I have always wished to see established, and which, by your tact and sound judgement, you have brought about to the fullest extent.&quot;

In 1892, Battenberg invented the Battenberg Course Indicator, a relative velocity analogue computer device used by seamen to determine course and speed to steer for changes of position between ships.

By February 1894 his role was further developed when he was appointed joint secretary of the naval and military committee on defence, which was later renamed the Committee of Imperial Defence. Louis captained in the Mediterranean Fleet from October 1894 to May 1897 and in the Channel Fleet from June 1897. His careful study of both naval and military defence, as well as its interaction, led to his appointment as assistant director of the Naval Intelligence in June 1899. He used his relationships with the royal houses of Europe to gather intelligence on the naval fleets of other nations, which he passed on to the Admiralty in full and detailed reports. He became an aide-de-camp to the Queen in 1897, a post he would retain under both King and King.

He commissioned the newly built battleship on 10 September 1901, and served as its captain for a year in the Mediterranean, during which he spectacularly defeated a larger opposing force in a naval exercise. When the Second-in-Command of the Mediterranean Fleet, Rear-Admiral Burges Watson, died suddenly in late September 1902, Louis was temporarily appointed 2nd class Commodore with added responsibilities. In November of the same year he was appointed as Director of Naval Intelligence, an apt posting for a man whom First Lord of the Admiralty the Earl of Selborne described as &quot;the cleverest sailor I have met yet&quot;. The outgoing Director, Rear-Admiral Reginald Custance, had been Battenberg’s superior at the Naval Intelligence Department a few years earlier and tried to prevent Battenberg’s promotion to succeed him.

==Admiral==
He was promoted to rear admiral on 1 July 1904, in which year his family connections to the royal courts of Europe helped resolve the Dogger Bank incident peacefully. The following February, he was given command of the Second Cruiser Squadron, with as his flagship. During a successful two years the squadron visited Greece, Portugal, Canada, and the United States, where the American press commented favourably on Prince Louis&#x27;s courtesy, unassuming manner and democratic nature. After two years at the head of the Second Cruiser Squadron, and further visits to Spain (where his niece Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg was Queen), he was appointed second-in-command of the Mediterranean Fleet as acting vice-admiral with as his flagship.

After less than six months in post his flag was transferred to the battleship in August 1907. The following year, he was promoted to vice-admiral, and appointed as Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet. Historian Andrew Lambert described Battenberg as a sea-going admiral as &quot;more cerebral than the average, although somewhat lazy. The [fleet] exercises had a greater sense of realism, reflecting the latest thinking on weapons and strategy.&quot; In 1909, he published a translation of Commander Vladimir Semenoff&#x27;s &quot;Rasplata&quot; (&quot;The Reckoning&quot;), a memoir of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, and witnessed the first crossing of the English Channel by air by Louis Blériot. He was appointed as commander of the newly constituted Third and Fourth Divisions of the Home Fleet two years later. The years immediately preceding this appointment were marred by disagreements between Admirals Sir John Fisher and Lord Charles Beresford over the direction of the navy and the imposition of reforms. Louis largely supported Fisher&#x27;s modernising efforts, although he disapproved of his methods, and as a result Fisher&#x27;s opponents attempted to prevent Louis&#x27;s promotions.

==Sea Lord==
Fisher recommended Louis as First Sea Lord in 1911: &quot;He is the most capable administrator in the Admirals List &quot;by a long way&quot;&quot;, but elements of the British press were against his appointment on the grounds that he was a German. Horatio Bottomley said it was &quot;a crime against our Empire to trust our secrets of National Defence to any alien-born official&quot;. In December 1911, Louis did return to the Admiralty but as Second rather than First Sea Lord. As Second Sea Lord, Louis pushed through improvements in working conditions for the ratings, and created an Admiralty War Staff that would prepare the navy&#x27;s plans in case of war. He was promoted to full admiral on 13 July 1912.
However, almost a year to the day later, on 8 December 1912, Battenberg assumed the post of First Sea Lord in succession to Admiral Sir Francis Bridgeman. Military historian Hew Strachan contends that Battenberg &quot;lacked Fisher&#x27;s dogmatism. Not the least of his attractions to Churchill [the First Lord] was his malleability. The combination of frequent change and weak appointees Wilson, Bridgeman and Battenberg] ensured that the professional leadership of the Royal Navy lost its direction in the four years preceding the war. Power now lay with the service&#x27;s civilian head ... Winston Churchill.&quot; Late in 1913 Battenberg (according to draft notes in Churchill&#x27;s papers) gave what historian Nicholas Lambert describes as &quot;uncharacteristically fierce resistance&quot; to Churchill&#x27;s suggestion of appointing his former superior Reginald Custance to the post of Chief of Naval War Staff (Doveton Sturdee was appointed instead). Jack Sandars, Arthur Balfour’s former political secretary, at one point recorded that his many sources at the Admiralty complained of Battenberg’s subservience to Churchill and that his nickname was &quot;Quite Concur&quot; after the words which he often wrote on Churchill’s memos.

As First Sea Lord, Battenberg was responsible to the First Lord for the readiness of the fleet and the preparation of naval strategy, as well as the development of a scheme for state insurance of merchant vessels in times of war, which was to prove essential in preventing prohibitive insurance rates that would have stifled British trade.

On the eve of the World War, Churchill and Battenberg made the crucial decision to cancel the scheduled dispersal of the British fleet following practice manoeuvres, to preserve the Royal Navy&#x27;s battle readiness. In the view of Andrew Lambert, &quot;While Churchill planned to recall Fisher if war broke out, he missed the chance to prevent war that might have been provided by drafting him earlier. No Cabinet advised by Fisher would have made such a blundering, incompetent, disastrous response to the July [1914] Crisis. The British trumpet gave a very uncertain note in July [1914], allowing the Germans to delude themselves that Britain might be neutral ... the contrast in habits between the energy and enthusiasm of the young First Lord and the lackadaisical habits of the First Sea Lord Prince Louis of Battenberg made Fisher&#x27;s recall all but inevitable.&quot;

Upon the outbreak of war, gout began to cause Battenberg considerable pain, and the naval staff he had set up did not function as well as it ought to have done. On 6 August 1914 Battenberg and the French Deputy Chief of Staff of the Navy Antoine Schwerer signed a convention in London on the division of responsibilities between the two navies. The convention confirmed the terms of the Entente Cordiale, and placed France in command of all naval operations in the Mediterranean. Malta and Gibraltar would both be treated as French naval bases. In the event that Austria entered the war France would act against its naval forces, and would at minimum prevent them passing the Strait of Otranto.

Anti-German sentiment rose among the British public, in newspapers, and in elite gentlemen&#x27;s clubs, where resentment was inflamed by Admiral Lord Charles Beresford despite Churchill&#x27;s remonstrances. Driven by public opinion, Churchill asked Prince Louis to resign as First Sea Lord on 27 October 1914. When acceptance of Battenberg&#x27;s resignation was delayed by the King&#x27;s opposition to the appointment of Fisher in his place, Louis wrote to Churchill, &quot;I beg of you to release me. I am on the verge of breaking down &amp; I cannot use my brain for anything.&quot; On 13 November he wrote to Churchill&#x27;s Naval Secretary, Rear-Admiral Horace Hood, &quot;It was an awful wrench, but I had no choice from the moment it was made clear to me that the Government did not feel themselves strong enough to support me by some public pronouncement&quot;. Churchill later told George Riddell (Diary 29 April 1915) that Battenberg had been &quot;very lethargic&quot;. He was also critical of Doveton Sturdee &quot;not a good Chief of Staff. He is a good fighting admiral but not a clever man.&quot;

His resignation was announced amid an outpouring of appreciation from politicians and naval comrades. Battenberg had written to Churchill on 28 October, &quot;What I shd (sic) value above all else is to be admitted to the Privy Council&quot;. The King later swore Louis in as a Privy Councillor in a public show of support. Labour party politician and trade union leader J. H. Thomas wrote to &quot;The Times&quot;: &quot;I desire to express my extreme regret at the announcement that Prince Louis of Battenberg has, by his resignation, pandered to the most mean and contemptible slander I have ever known ... I was simply astounded to hear the base suggestions and rumours current, and I am afraid that his action will simply be looked upon as a triumph for the mean and miserable section of people, who, at a time of national trial, is ever ready to pass a foul lie from lip to lip without a tittle of evidence&quot;. Admiral of the Fleet Lord John Hay thought that the &quot;ingeniously propagated lies&quot; originated from Germany.

Prince Louis held no official post for the remainder of the war and lived in retirement at Kent House on the Isle of Wight. He occupied his time in writing a comprehensive encyclopaedia on naval medals published in three large volumes, which became the standard reference work on the subject. His naval career had been characterised by industry, invention and intellect; he introduced mechanical calculators to compute navigations and a cone signalling apparatus. Although assured that he would be returned to command post-war, on 9 December 1918 the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Rosslyn Wemyss, wrote to Prince Louis informing him that he would not be employed again and suggested that he might retire in order to facilitate the promotion of younger officers. Prince Louis agreed, and he officially retired on 1 January 1919 &quot;at [his] own request&quot;, shortly before reaching the mandatory retirement age of 65.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADM 196/38&quot;&gt;ADM 196/38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoption of the surname Mountbatten==
During the war, persistent rumours that the British Royal Family must be pro-German, given their dynastic origins and many German relatives, prompted the King to abandon his subsidiary German dynastic titles and adopt an English surname. At the behest of the King, Louis relinquished the title Prince of Battenberg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse, along with the style of &quot;Serene Highness&quot;, on 14 July 1917. At the same time, Louis anglicised his family name, changing it from &quot;Battenberg&quot; to &quot;Mountbatten&quot;, having considered but rejected &quot;Battenhill&quot; as an alternative. On 7 November, the King created him &quot;Marquess of Milford Haven, Earl of Medina, and Viscount Alderney&quot; in the peerage of the United Kingdom. He was offered a dukedom by George V, but declined as he could not afford the lavish lifestyle expected of a duke.

The King&#x27;s British relatives in the Teck, Schleswig-Holstein, and Gleichen families underwent similar changes. Louis&#x27;s wife ceased to use her own title of Princess of Hesse and became known as the Marchioness of Milford Haven. His three younger children ceased to use their princely titles and assumed courtesy titles as children of a British marquess; his eldest daughter, Princess Alice, had married into the Greek Royal Family in 1903, and never had occasion to use the surname Mountbatten. However, her only son, Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, adopted the name when he became a British subject in 1947.

While the transition in names and titles was being effected, Louis spent some time at the home of his eldest son, George. After anglicising his surname to &quot;Mountbatten&quot; and becoming Marquess of Milford Haven, Louis wrote in his son&#x27;s guestbook, &quot;Arrived Prince Hyde, Departed Lord Jekyll&quot;.

==Final years and death==
During the war, two of Lord Milford Haven&#x27;s sisters-in-law (Empress Alexandra Feodorovna and Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna) were killed by the Bolsheviks in Russia. Eventually, in January 1921, after a long and convoluted journey, the body of Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna was interred in Jerusalem in the presence of Milford Haven and his wife.

In 1919, the Milford Havens had to give up their home, Kent House, for financial reasons. He sold his collection of naval medals. All of his financial investments in Russia were seized by the Bolsheviks and his German property became valueless with the collapse of the mark. He sold Heiligenberg Castle, which he had inherited from his father, in 1920.

Milford Haven was appointed Military Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB), to add to the Civil one he already held, in recognition of his service to the Royal Navy in the 1921 New Year Honours, and was specially promoted by Order in Council to the rank of Admiral of the Fleet on the Retired List, dated 19 August. A few days later he joined , the ship on which his son Louis was serving, for a week at the invitation of the captain Dudley Pound. It was his last voyage; he died at 42 Half Moon Street, Piccadilly, London in the annexe of the Naval and Military Club on 11 September 1921 of heart failure following influenza. After a funeral service at Westminster Abbey, his remains were buried at St. Mildred&#x27;s Church, Whippingham, on the Isle of Wight.

The marquess&#x27;s elder son, George Mountbatten, who had received the courtesy title Earl of Medina, succeeded him as 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven. Louis&#x27;s younger son, styled Lord Louis Mountbatten after 1917, served in the Royal Navy, became First Sea Lord like his father, was the last Viceroy of India, and was created Earl Mountbatten of Burma in 1947.

<text>The Tasman Spirit was a Greek registered oil tanker. The tanker was launched in February 1979 and was formerly called the &quot;Mabini&quot; and &quot;Kenko&quot;.

== &quot;Tasman Spirit&quot; oil spill ==
On July 27, 2003, she ran aground near the city of Karachi whilst on approach to the Port of Karachi. Over the next few days more than 33,000 tons of oil spilled into the Arabian Sea in what is considered by some to be the largest environmental disaster in Pakistan&#x27;s history. Cracks began to appear on the ship&#x27;s hull on August 13 and the ship began to break up. By August 17, the ship had split into two, releasing some 12,000 tons of its light crude oil cargo into the Arabian Sea. According to the IUCN 16 kilometres of coastline has been polluted.

The ship&#x27;s insurer offered 10 million rupees (about $180,000 US dollars in 2003) in compensation to the Karachi port authorities, and agreed to pay all cleaning expenses.

<text>Simply Red are an English soul and pop band formed in Manchester in 1985. Band leader, singer and songwriter Mick Hucknall was the only original member left by the time Simply Red initially disbanded in 2010. They have released thirteen studio albums, from &quot;Picture Book&quot; (1985) through &quot;Time&quot; (2023), all of which have peaked within the top ten on the UK Albums Chart; with the albums &quot;A New Flame&quot; (1989), &quot;Stars&quot; (1991), &quot;Life&quot; (1995) and &quot;Blue&quot; (1998), along with their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1996) album, reaching number one. Their 1991 album &quot;Stars&quot; is one of the best-selling albums in the United Kingdom.

The group released ten songs that have reached the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart, including &quot;Stars&quot;, the Fugees-assisted &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;The Air That I Breathe&quot; and &quot;Sunrise&quot;, with the single &quot;Fairground&quot; peaking atop the UK Singles Chart. Their singles &quot;Holding Back the Years&quot; and &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Know Me by Now&quot; both reached number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

At the 1992 and 1993 Brit Awards, they received the award for Best British Group. They have received three Grammy Award nominations, including one for Best New Artist in 1987. Their version of &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Know Me by Now&quot; won songwriters Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff the Grammy Award for the Best R&amp;B Song. The band re-formed in 2015. Simply Red have sold over 50 million albums.

==History==
===1977–1984: The Frantic Elevators===
Hucknall was in a punk group called The Frantic Elevators, whose seven-year run produced limited releases on local labels and ended in 1984 upon critical acclaim for their final single, &quot;Holding Back the Years&quot;.

===1985–1988: Formation and early success===
After the demise of The Frantic Elevators, Hucknall linked up with manager Elliot Rashman. By early 1985, Hucknall and Rashman had assembled a band of local session musicians and begun to attract record-company attention. The group went under a number of names: &quot;World Service&quot;, &quot;Red And The Dancing Dead&quot;, &quot;Just Red&quot; (after Hucknall&#x27;s nickname &quot;Red&quot;, denoting his hair colour) but Hucknall decided it would sound better with the addition of the word &#x27;Simply&#x27;. The band&#x27;s name is also linked to Hucknall&#x27;s allegiance to being a supporter of Manchester United, as the club&#x27;s home shirt colour is red.

The initial Simply Red line-up consisted of Mick Hucknall (vocals), David Fryman (guitar), Tony Bowers (bass), Fritz McIntyre (keyboards and vocals), Tim Kellett (brass and live backing vocals) and Chris Joyce (drums). Bowers and Joyce had both previously been members of post-punk bands The Durutti Column and The Mothmen; Kellett had also been a member of The Durutti Column, though not at the same time as Bowers and Joyce.

Simply Red signed a contract with Elektra in 1985, but after recording one track (&quot;Red Box&quot;), Fryman left the group and was replaced by guitarist Sylvan Richardson, billed as &#x27;Sylvan&#x27;.

&quot;Red Box&quot; would eventually see release in 1985 as a B-side to the group&#x27;s first single, &quot;Money&#x27;s Too Tight (to Mention)&quot;, a cover of a soul song originally recorded by The Valentine Brothers. &quot;Money&#x27;s Too Tight (to Mention)&quot; gained international success, reaching the UK and Irish Top 20, then later the American, French and Dutch Top 30, and the Italian Top 5. It was included on their debut album, &quot;Picture Book&quot;, also released in 1985.

Several low-charting singles would follow for the band. Among the comparative flops was a re-recording of the Frantic Elevators&#x27; &quot;Holding Back the Years&quot;, done up in a new soul-ballad style arrangement. Released as Simply Red&#x27;s third single in 1985, the track initially placed outside the UK Top 50. However, upon being re-released in 1986, &quot;Holding Back the Years&quot; became a major hit, peaking at #1 in Ireland, #2 in the UK, #3 in the Netherlands, #20 in Italy and later #1 in the United States.

Simply Red&#x27;s second album, 1987&#x27;s &quot;Men and Women&quot;, saw the band adopting bowler hats and colourful suits instead of their earlier ragamuffin look. As well, the introspection and social commentary of their debut album was replaced by a blue-eyed soul sound with funk influences. Veteran Motown songwriter Lamont Dozier co-authored two tracks with Hucknall for the album—these tracks were credited to &#x27;Hucknall/Dozier/Hucknall&#x27; in the original album credits, in homage to the famous Motown writing team of Holland-Dozier-Holland.

The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;The Right Thing&quot; was another international hit, charting in the top 40 throughout Europe and North America. Several follow-up singles also met with modest success in the UK and elsewhere.

===1989–1995: Peak years===
Guitarist Richardson left after the release of &quot;Men and Women&quot; and was replaced by Brazilian Heitor Pereira (billed as Heitor TP). Saxophonist Ian Kirkham, who joined the group during the &quot;Picture Book&quot; tour in 1986 and played on &quot;Men and Women&quot;, became an official member.

With their third album &quot;A New Flame&quot; in 1989, Simply Red adopted a yet more mainstream popular sound aimed for commercial rather than critical success, typified by their cover of Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes&#x27; pop classic &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Know Me by Now&quot;, which became their second U.S. #1 hit, and one of the biggest singles of the year internationally; and their greatest success to that point.

Hucknall was by this time an international superstar, being photographed with models and Hollywood celebrities. This seemed to harm the band&#x27;s coherence as a unit, with Hucknall declaring in 1991 that Simply Red was &quot;essentially a solo project&quot;. The rhythm section of Bowers and Joyce left around this time; they were replaced by bassist Shaun Ward (ex-Floy Joy and Everyday People) and drummer Gota Yashiki (often billed as just Gota).

The band&#x27;s career peaked in late 1991 with the release of &quot;Stars&quot;, which became the best-selling album for two years running in Europe and the UK (though notably had less chart success in the US than their previous albums, still earning however a gold certification). The album spun off five top 40 singles in the UK, and the singles &quot;Something Got Me Started&quot; and &quot;Stars&quot; were also significant chart hits throughout all of Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. After the tour, Tim Kellett left to form dance band Olive.

After touring and promoting &quot;Stars&quot; for two years, Simply Red returned in 1995 with &quot;Fairground&quot; (at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in Blackpool), a dance-influenced track prominently featuring a sample from Zki &amp; Dobri&#x27;s Goodmen project. A massive radio hit, &quot;Fairground&quot; went on to become the band&#x27;s first and only UK #1. Its parent album &quot;Life&quot; sold more than a million copies in the UK alone, making it the fourth-biggest seller of the year. By this time, the band was officially Hucknall, McIntyre, Pereira, Kirkham, and new backing vocalist Dee Johnson. Guest musicians (including Sly &amp; Robbie) filled in on drums and bass. For the subsequent live shows, Simply Red were joined by new recruits&#x27; Steve Lewinson on bass, Velroy Bailey on drums, and second backing vocalist Sarah Brown.

===1996–2000===
McIntyre, the only original remaining band member aside from lead singer Hucknall, left the group after the &quot;Life&quot; album, as did Pereira. From that time in 1996, Simply Red was essentially a trade name for Hucknall and a bevy of session musicians, which would vary from track to track (and gig to gig) as needed, although all post-1996 Simply Red albums and live shows did include contributions from sax player Ian Kirkham. Returning drummer Gota Yashiki (co-producing several album tracks) and backing vocalists Dee Johnson and Sarah Brown were also frequently involved with the band&#x27;s later recordings and shows, as was new keyboardist/co-producer Andy Wright.

East West Records issued the compilation album &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; in 1996, reportedly against Hucknall&#x27;s wishes. The album featured one new track, a cover of the 1973 Aretha Franklin hit &quot;Angel&quot; which was co-produced with The Fugees (who also served as backing musicians). Released as a single, &quot;Angel&quot; reached #4 in the UK.

1998 saw the release of the cover-heavy &quot;Blue&quot;, which produced four UK top 40 singles, including the top 10 hits &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; and &quot;The Air That I Breathe&quot;. The follow-up album, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Love and the Russian Winter&quot;, was a relative disappointment, spawning two minor hits that failed to break the top 10.

Simply Red were dropped from their label, East West Records in April 2000. Hucknall subsequently set up the website Simplyred.com to handle releases of new recordings; the new label/website venture proved to be quite successful, many of the band&#x27;s Simplyred.com releases selling and charting almost as well as their earlier recordings.

===2003–2010: Re-establishment as a band and disbanding===
Between 2003 and its disbandment in 2010, the band&#x27;s core members were Mick Hucknall (lead vocals), Ian Kirkham (saxophone/EWI/keyboards), Dave Clayton (keyboards), Kenji Suzuki (guitar), Kevin Robinson (trumpet/flugelhorn/percussion), Steve Lewinson (bass guitar) and Pete Lewinson (drums). These musicians featured on Simply Red&#x27;s shows as well as on albums, though in the studio, they were often augmented or replaced by session musicians. From 2003 to 2008, Dee Johnson (backing vocals), Sarah Brown (backing vocals), John Johnson (trombone/percussion) and Chris De Margary (saxophone/flute) also continued to be in the band and have appeared on albums and tours.

On 24 March 2003, the band released &quot;Home&quot;, a mixture of original songs and covers, including a version of The Stylistics&#x27; &quot;You Make Me Feel Brand New&quot;, which hit UK #7. The album went Double Platinum in the United Kingdom, Gold in Canada, and Platinum in Europe. It featured two other hit singles: &quot;Sunrise&quot; (#7 UK) and &quot;Fake&quot; (#21 UK).

On 13 October 2005, followed &quot;Simplified&quot;, mainly an album of stripped-down versions of their classic hits. The single &quot;Perfect Love&quot; made it to number 30 on the UK chart, the band&#x27;s final top 30 placing.

On 12 March 2007, the band released its tenth (and, at that time, proclaimed final) studio album, &quot;Stay&quot;. This was preceded by the single from that album, &quot;So Not Over You&quot;, released on 5 March 2007, which would peak at #34 in the UK. Follow-up single &quot;Stay&quot; (released on 28 May 2007) peaked at #36 UK, and was the band&#x27;s final placing in the UK top 100 (although they would release several non-charting singles in the following years).

On 19 May 2008, Hucknall released his first solo album, &quot;Tribute to Bobby&quot;. The backing musicians on the solo album were virtually the same group of musicians he had been working with as &quot;Simply Red&quot; for the last few years.

Hucknall announced that the name Simply Red would be retired after a farewell tour which started in early 2009 and ended in 2010.
Simply Red&#x27;s final concert took place at the O2 Arena in London on 19 December 2010. The concert was shown live at cinemas throughout the UK.

===2014–2015: &quot;Big Love&quot; and 30th anniversary reunion tour===
On 3 November 2014, Simply Red announced that they would be reforming in Autumn 2015 for a 30th anniversary European tour, the &quot;Big Love Tour 2015&quot;. The tour debuted on 20 October 2015 in Odense, Denmark, went on in 2016 as the &quot;Big Love Tour 2016&quot; and ended on 26 August 2016 at the Summerdays Festival in Arbon, Switzerland, performing the following month an ultimate show on 10 September 2016 at the BMW Festival Night in Munich, Germany. The line-up for the reunion tour was the same as Simply Red&#x27;s last formation with the exception of Roman Roth replacing Pete Lewinson as the drummer.

On 19 April 2015, the band announced that they would be releasing a new studio album (also) named &quot;Big Love&quot;, containing 12 new tracks. The new album was released on 29 May 2015.

===2016–2018: &quot;Stars 25th anniversary tour and Symphonica In Rosso&quot;===
On 11 November 2016, Simply Red embarked in Dublin, Ireland on the &quot;25 Years of Stars Live&quot; tour, celebrating the 25th anniversary of the release in September 1991 of &quot;Stars&quot; by playing live on stage the entire album in its original running order (while the second half of the show featured hits and classic Simply Red songs). The debut date in Ireland was followed by a 10-date UK leg starting on 13 November in Liverpool, England, and ending on 27 November at The O2 in London.

In 2017, they announced they would be headlining at the annual Symphonica In Rosso event on 25, 26 and 28 October. A live album of the concert, &quot;Symphonica in Rosso – Live at Ziggo Dome, Amsterdam&quot;, was released on 23 November 2018. The live album debuted and peaked at number 58 on the UK Albums Chart.

===2019–2023: &quot;Blue Eyed Soul&quot;===
The band&#x27;s twelfth studio album, &quot;Blue Eyed Soul&quot;, was released on 8 November 2019. It debuted at number six on the UK Albums Chart, selling nearly 10,000 copies in its first week.

To support the album Simply Red announced concert dates for 2021 around the UK and Europe. However, these were postponed to 2022 and 2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On 22 October 2022, Simply Red released their first remix album, &quot;Simply Red Remixed Vol. 1 (1985–2000)&quot;.

===2023: &quot;Time&quot;===

On 2 March 2023 Simply Red announced the release of their thirteenth studio album, &quot;Time&quot;, for 26 May 2023. The first unveiled track from the album is &quot;Earth in a Lonely Space&quot;, which was already released as a single on 18 May 2021. The lead single, &quot;Better with You&quot;, was released on 2 March 2023, accompanying the album&#x27;s official announcement. Although the band&#x27;s long-time keyboardist Dave Clayton has recorded some parts for &quot;Time&quot; and has even played &quot;Better with You&quot; with Simply Red during the final shows of 2022, Clayton&#x27;s decision to leave the group after almost 20 years (with hopes of being able to spend more time with his family) was announced by the time that the year of 2022 was over. In the months leading up to the release of the &quot;Time&quot; album, Simply Red have released two further singles - &quot;Shades 22&quot; and &quot;Just Like You&quot; - on 31 March 2023 and 27 April 2023 respectively. In addition, the band announced an intimate album launch show for 5 June 2023 at the O2 Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London; this was their only UK performance in 2023. Also, at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush show, Mick Hucknall officially introduced Gary Sanctuary to the fans, as Simply Red&#x27;s new keyboard player.

<text>Michael James Hucknall (born 8 June 1960) is an English singer and songwriter. Hucknall achieved international fame in the 1980s as the lead singer and songwriter of the soul-influenced pop band Simply Red, with whom he enjoyed a 25-year career and sold over 50 million albums. Hucknall was described by Australian music magazine &quot;Rhythms&quot; as &quot;one of the truly great blue-eyed soul singers&quot;, while &quot;Q&quot; credited him with &quot;the most prodigious voice this side of Motown&quot;.

==Early life==
Hucknall, born at Saint Mary&#x27;s Hospital, Manchester, on 8 June 1960, was an only child. His mother abandoned the family when he was three; the upheaval caused by this event inspired him to write &quot;Holding Back the Years&quot;, which would become one of Simply Red&#x27;s biggest and best-known hits. He was brought up in Denton by his father, Reginald (1935–2009), a barber in Stockport. According to Hucknall he had a happy childhood until the age of 10, when he began to clash with his father &quot;because there was no woman to act as referee&quot;. 

Hucknall attended Audenshaw School, before continuing his education at Tameside College and Manchester Polytechnic&#x27;s School of Art, where he was a fine art student: whilst at art school he lived in Hulme. It would not be until the mid-1990s that he would reconnect with his mother, Maureen, who was by then living in the US city of Dallas. As of a 2008 interview, he had only seen her twice since she left. He is of Irish ancestry from his mother, whose father was from County Offaly, along with his paternal grandmother. His maternal grandmother was Jewish.

== Music career ==

Hucknall was among the people present at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester in June 1976 where the Sex Pistols were playing. His interest in the music scene led to the launch of his career in the late 1970s, when he was part of the band Frantic Elevators. The Frantic Elevators released four singles, including a version of &quot;Holding Back the Years&quot;, which he later recorded with Simply Red.

As lead singer and core member of Simply Red, he became the identifiable face of the band. His face and long curly red hair were featured prominently on album artwork and in videos.

In 1997, Hucknall won an Outstanding Achievement award from the Music of Black Origin Awards (MOBO Awards) despite being white.

Hucknall is one of the founders of the reggae label Blood and Fire.

In October 2007, on David Jensen&#x27;s show on the Gold network, he announced Simply Red would split in 2009. In 2008, he released his first solo album &quot;Tribute to Bobby&quot;, a tribute to the blues musician Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland.

In October 2009, Hucknall appeared at a charity performance as vocalist for a re-formed version of Faces, replacing Rod Stewart. In October 2011, he was awarded with a BASCA Gold Badge award in recognition of his contribution to music.

In October 2012, he released &quot;American Soul&quot;, a collection of his favourite music re-recorded with his vocals.

== Political activism and views ==
Hucknall was active in politics as a prominent celebrity supporter of the Labour Party during the New Labour era. In 1997, he declared his support for the party at that year&#x27;s general election – which it won by a landslide under the leadership of Tony Blair to return to government after 18 years in opposition. In 1998, Hucknall was named in a list of those who donated more than £5,000 to the party. In 2003, Hucknall backed Blair&#x27;s stance on the Iraq War, stating he had &quot;more respect for Blair than ever&quot; and pointed out that British critics of the war were lucky to be living in a country where they could express their opinions. Hucknall said in 2008 that his conscience prevented him from donating to the party again because of the war, although he would still vote for them.

Hucknall has been strongly critical of more recent Labour leaders: after the 2015 general election, he said that Ed Miliband &quot;veer(ed) close to Marxism&quot; and that the electorate had acted &quot;with collective wisdom&quot; by defeating Labour in favour of electing a Conservative government, which he described as &quot;the inheritor of the Blairite mantle&quot;. The following year he described Jeremy Corbyn as a &quot;shabby, spineless coward&quot; for what he regarded as an insufficiently strong commitment to the Remain campaign for the 2016 Brexit referendum. Hucknall publicly declared he would not vote for Labour ahead of the 2017 general election and 2019 general election, and that he had ended his longstanding support for the party, citing Corbyn&#x27;s stance on antisemitism. In 2019, he described himself as &quot;politically homeless.&quot;

Hucknall has said that derogatory references to his red hair are a form of bigotry.

Hucknall was a guest on the panel for the BBC&#x27;s political discussion series &quot;Question Time&quot;, broadcast on 27 March 2014, and declared his support for same-sex marriage.

==Personal life==
Hucknall and his wife Gabriella Wesberry married in 2010 at the 16th-century Forter Castle in Glenisla, Perthshire, Scotland. Their daughter Romy True Hucknall was born in June 2007.

Hucknall spends a considerable amount of time in Ireland, where he purchased the Glenmore Estate near the village of Cloghan, County Donegal, with bandmate Chris De Margary. Hucknall and De Margary are keen fishermen. They operate a fishing and hunting tourism business from the estate. In March 2014, Hucknall settled a hunting and fishing rights lawsuit, ongoing for five years, with a neighbour in Ireland. As the case opened in 2009, Judge O&#x27;Hagan had instructed both sides to go away and talk about reaching an agreement or else it would drag on for years.

Hucknall co-owns Ask Property Development, a company that constructs city squares and public buildings.

Hucknall spends time in Catania, Sicily, where he produces wines under the label &quot;Il Cantante&quot; (The Singer).
===Football===
Hucknall is a football fan and a supporter of Manchester United. His song &quot;We&#x27;re in This Together&quot; was the competition anthem of the 1996 UEFA European Football Championship and he performed it at its opening and closing ceremonies.

<text>The Cymru Premier, known as the JD Cymru Premier for sponsorship reasons, is the national football league of Wales. It has both professional and semi-professional status clubs and is at the top of the Welsh football league system. It was founded in 1992, as the first league representing all of Wales. Prior to 2002, the league was known as the League of Wales (LoW), but changed its name as part of a sponsorship deal to the Welsh Premier League. The league was rebranded as the Cymru Premier for the 2019–20 season. Though formed relatively recently, the league contains some of the oldest clubs in world football. Eleven current or former members of the league were founded in the 1870s or 1880s, with many more formed before the end of the 19th century. The vast majority of its clubs are still owned and run by the local community or by people from the area. 

It operates on a promotion and relegation system with Tier 2 of the Welsh football league system, the Cymru North and Cymru South leagues. The Cymru Premier League is currently contested by 12 teams, with each team playing each other home and away during the first phase. At the end of this period the league splits into two divisions, with the top 6 teams going on to the Championship Conference, and the bottom 6 teams into the Play-Off Conference. Each team playing each other a further two times, home and away, with the champion being decide by the team with the most points in the Championship Conference, and the lowest two teams in Play-Off Conference relegated. Seasons usually run from August to May, with each team playing 32 matches in total. It is due to expand to 16 teams in 2026-27 and with a changed format.

Cymru Premier is currently ranked 49th in the UEFA coefficients based on the performances by teams in European competition over the past 5 years, giving 4 of its teams opportunities in European football qualifiers.

The current champions are TNS who won the league for the 16th time in the 2023-24 season. Seven teams have won the competition since its inception: TNS (16), Barry Town United (7), Bangor City (3), Connah&#x27;s Quay Nomads (2), Rhyl (2). Llanelli (1) and Cwmbran Town (1). As of the 2024-25 season 42 clubs have participated in Wales&#x27; top flight league.

==Formation==
=== Original League ===
The league was formed in October 1991 by Alun Evans, Secretary General of the Football Association of Wales (FAW), as he believed that the Welsh international football team was under threat from FIFA. The FAW, along with the other three home nations&#x27; associations (The Football Association, Irish Football Association and Scottish Football Association), had a permanent seat on the International Football Association Board (IFAB) and it was thought that many FIFA members were resentful of this and pressing for the four unions to unite into one combined side for the whole of the United Kingdom.

The new league was formed for the 1992–93 season, and officially launched on 15 August 1992. At the time, despite the FAW being a FIFA and UEFA member it had not previously organised a national league, only the Welsh Cup. 

On its formation the league consisted of a number of teams previously playing in regional leagues across Wales, plus a small number of clubs that had been playing in the English league system. Because of historically poor north–south transport links through mountainous mid-Wales (although these have improved in the post World War II years), it was sometimes easier for Welsh clubs to travel east–west to play football, so some Welsh clubs looked east to England for competitors. Teams in Wales that had played in the English leagues included Aberdare Athletic, Cardiff City, Merthyr Town, Newport County, Swansea City and Wrexham. Many semi-professional sides in Wales also played in both the Welsh and English football league system at different points in their history; Bangor City were founder members of the North Wales Coast League in 1893 and the Welsh National League in 1921, before the Alliance Premier League (now the National League) in 1979 and reached the FA Trophy final in 1984. They transferred back once again to the Welsh system and the new League of Wales in 1992.

While the league itself is relatively young, many of its clubs are among the oldest in the world, having played in North, Mid and South Wales regional leagues since the 19th century. A number of the current members of the league are over 100 years older than the league itself. Many more of the leagues clubs current and ex-clubs were formed before 1900. The current oldest member is Newtown, formed in 1875. 

=== Further recruitment ===
The formation of the League of Wales saw the start of a bitter dispute between the Football Association of Wales (FAW) and those non-League clubs who wanted to remain part of the English football pyramid. The &#x27;Irate Eight&#x27;, as they were dubbed, consisted of Bangor City, Barry Town, Caernarfon Town, Colwyn Bay, Merthyr Tydfil, Newport, Newtown and Rhyl. At the time, Cardiff City, Swansea City and Wrexham were playing in The Football League, and the FAW decided to allow those teams to continue to play in the English system, although they continued to compete in the Welsh Cup for a few more seasons. The success of these clubs in the Welsh Cups meant that they frequently competed in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup despite the fact that Wrexham had never played above the Second Division and Swansea had spent just two seasons in the First Division during the early 1980s, while Cardiff had been semi-regular members of the First Division from the 1920s up to 1962.

Prior to the inaugural season, Bangor City, Newtown and Rhyl agreed to play in the League of Wales. However, as Rhyl&#x27;s application to join the league was late, they were placed in the second level of the pyramid system. Because of FAW sanctions, the remaining five clubs were forced to play their home matches in England. Following a season in exile at Worcester City, five became four, as Barry Town joined the Welsh pyramid in time for the 1993–94 season.

A court ruling in 1995 allowed the remaining four clubs to return to Wales to play their home matches while still remaining within the English system; despite this victory, Caernarfon Town decided to join the League of Wales for the 1995–96 season. Colwyn Bay continued in the English pyramid for a further 24 years before transferring to the Welsh pyramid in 2019, leaving only two of the Irate Eight remaining - Newport County, who won promotion to the Football League in 2013, and Merthyr Town, the successor club to Merthyr Tydfil following its liquidation in 2010. In 2008, Wrexham were relegated from the Football League and after an absence of 15 years, returned through automatic promotion at the end of the 2022–23 season.

Conversely, in 1996 now-defunct English team Oswestry Town were accepted by the League of Wales and currently The New Saints are based in Oswestry (having moved from Llansantffraid, Powys in 2007). Another English club, Chester City, whose stadium sits on the England–Wales border, applied to join the Welsh Premier League after being expelled from the Football Conference in 2010 but were wound up almost immediately afterwards (their successor team, Chester F.C., opted to reapply within the English system).

=== Renewed calls to recruit Welsh teams ===
Welsh football teams that currently play in the English football system include: Cardiff City and Swansea City (both in the EFL Championship), Wrexham (EFL League One), Newport County (EFL League Two), and Merthyr Town (Southern League Premier Division South).

Some have called for all Welsh teams to be recruited into Cymru Premier, but in particular the lower ranked Merthyr Town as they are in the English non-league setup.

An online poll by &quot;Y Clwb Pêl-droed&quot; on Twitter found 56.7% in favour of Merthyr Town joining the Welsh football system.

=== Future ===
In April 2024, the Football Association of Wales released a six-year strategic plan to enhance league&#x27;s competitiveness and announcing a multi-million euro investment in the league and its teams. The plans included increasing the number of teams competing in the league, revamping the competition format, and introducing Friday night league play.

In September 2024, the FAW confirmed the new league format would start in the 2026/27season and would consist of 16 teams each playing each other home and away before being split into three tiers of six, four and six clubs. The top six in the table will play each other once more, with the club topping the table after Matchday 35 crowned champions. Teams finishing second through sixth qualify for the end of season European qualification play-offs. Clubs ranked seventh through tenth will play each other once more, with the club placing seventh after Matchday 33 receiving the final play-off spot for European qualification. The remaining teams ranked eleventh and below will also play each other once more. At the end of Matchday 35, the two lowest clubs will be automatically relegated, while the club in 14th will compete in the relegation play-off with the qualifiers from Cymru South and Cymru North to play in the next season Cymru Premier.

==Structure==

===Promotion and relegation===
Clubs are promoted to the Cymru Premier from the Cymru North in the north/ central Wales and the Cymru South in the south/ central Wales. Clubs who finish as champions of the feeder leagues, or as runners-up if the champions decide not to seek promotion, are promoted subject to an application for membership being received and accepted and the stadium and infrastructure safety criteria of the Cymru Premier being met.

No teams were promoted to the Welsh Premier League following the 2005–06 season. However, Cardiff Grange Quins, who finished bottom of the Welsh Premier League resigned leaving the league to operate with an odd number of clubs for 2006–07.

Eighteen clubs competed in the Welsh Premier League for the 2007–08 season as both Neath Athletic (Welsh Football League Division One) and Llangefni Town (Cymru Alliance) were promoted whilst Cwmbran Town were relegated to Welsh Football League Division One.

For 2008–09, Prestatyn Town played in the Welsh Premier League for the first time after promotion from the Cymru Alliance, whilst Llangefni Town were relegated to the Cymru Alliance after only one season.

The 2009–10 season saw Bala Town promoted to the Welsh Premier League after they won the Cymru Alliance in 2008–09. They replaced Caernarfon Town who were relegated to the Cymru Alliance.

At the end of the 2009–10 season, due to league restructuring Connah&#x27;s Quay, Porthmadog, Welshpool Town, Caersws and Cefn Druids were relegated to the Cymru Alliance league. Rhyl were also relegated to the Cymru Alliance, despite finishing 6th in the Welsh Premier League, as they failed to meet the financial criteria required to gain the Welsh Premier League domestic licence. No teams were promoted to the Welsh Premier League from the feeder leagues.

===League restructure for 2010–11 season===
The 18 Welsh Premier League clubs met on 13 April 2008 and voted to support a restructuring proposal put forward by Welsh Premier League secretary John Deakin which would replace the single Welsh Premier League with a First and Second Division with 10 teams in each Division for the 2010–11 season. A further proposal was accepted that the Football Association of Wales should take full control of the Welsh Premier League and the existing Company, &#x27;Football League of Wales Limited&#x27; should be dissolved. These proposals were forwarded to the Football Association of Wales for their consideration.

In June 2009 the clubs voted to accept an alternative proposal to reduce the premier League from 18 clubs to 12 for the 2010–11 season onwards.

==Current structure==

The season is split into two phases, and concludes with an end of season Playoff to determine Wales&#x27; fourth European side for the following year.

===Phase 1===

Phase 1 runs from MD1 in August through to MD22 in mid-January. Each team plays the other sides in the league twice, once at home and once away, making a total of twenty-two games.

After the conclusion of Phase 1, the league splits in two, with the top six teams forming the Championship Conference, and the bottom six teams forming the Playoff Conference. All points accumulated by teams in Phase 1 are brought forward into Phase 2.

===Phase 2===

Phase 2 then runs from MD23 at the start of February through to MD32 at the end of April. Each side plays the other five in their conference twice more, home and away, to bring up a total of thirty-two games played.

The side finishing top of the Championship Conference after thirty-two games is the League Champion, and will qualify for the UEFA Champions League. To date six teams have won the title in twenty-six seasons.

The Runners-Up in the Championship Conference qualify automatically for the UEFA Europa Conference League, whilst the remaining teams qualify for the end of season European Playoffs.

The bottom two sides in the Playoff Conference are relegated. Meanwhile, the side finishing top of the Playoff Conference (seventh place in the league table) advances to the European Playoffs.

Note that sides in the Playoff Conference can finish no higher in the table than seventh.

===European Playoffs===

The five teams finishing in 3rd–7th contest the end of season European Playoffs. 6th host 7th in a Quarter-Final, with the winner travelling to the 3rd placed side for the first Semi-Final, whilst 4th host 5th in the other.

The winners then meet at the ground of the highest ranked side in the Final, with the winner qualifying for the UEFA Europa Conference League.

If one of the five teams has already qualified for Europe by winning the JD Welsh Cup, then the remaining four sides will contest the Playoffs directly from the Semi-Final stage.

If one of the top two sides wins the JD Welsh Cup, then the third placed side will automatically take up a UEFA Europa Conference League spot. The remaining four sides will then contest the Playoffs directly from the Semi-Final stage.

In seasons where the league&#x27;s UEFA Coefficient has been amongst the lowest five, meaning only The Cup Winners and Runners Up are eligible for the UEFA Conference League, the playoffs will be contended for a spot in the Scottish Challenge Cup instead.

==European competition==
The champions of the Cymru Premier qualify, along with the champions of every European domestic league, for the UEFA Champions League. The second and third placed teams (Depending on who wins the JD Welsh Cup) qualifies for the first qualifying round of the UEFA Europa Conference League. The teams in places 3/4 to 7 then play-off for the third Europa Conference League spot.
A place in the first qualifying round of the Europa Conference League is also awarded to the winners of the Welsh Cup. If the winners of the Welsh Cup have already qualified for Europe via their league placing (i.e., finishing in the top two and winning the Cup), or if the Welsh Cup winners have finished in a playoff position, then the remaining four sides contest the playoff.

Results in Europe have been mixed – some notable successes, such as Barry Town&#x27;s run to the first round proper of the UEFA Cup, drawing 3–3 with Aberdeen at Jenner Park, Bangor City&#x27;s win over FC Sartid of Yugoslavia and Barry&#x27;s 3–1 victory over FC Porto in the UEFA Champions League (albeit losing 3–9 on aggregate), stand alongside some heavy defeats, such as The New Saints&#x27; 12–1 aggregate defeat to Amica Wronki of Poland.

In August 2024 The New Saints became the first club from Wales&#x27; top flight to enter the group stage of a European competition, when they beat FK Panevezys 3–0 on aggregate to qualify for the UEFA Conference League.

As of October 2024 the Cymru Premier is ranked 49th out of 55 members by the UEFA coefficient, having risen from 52nd the previous year.

== Media coverage ==
For the first four seasons of the league&#x27;s existence, its results were not featured on the Press Association&#x27;s vidiprinter service and consequently had not appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Final Score&quot; or Sky&#x27;s &quot;Soccer Saturday&quot;. The PA added the league&#x27;s results at the start of the 1996–97 season, which was also when the PA began providing the results for the Northern Irish league.

Since the start of the 2007–08 season goals and results from the league have appeared on the Press Association vidiprinter service. Prior to this only the full-time score had been displayed although the half time score had also been shown from around 2000. &quot;Final Score&quot; continues to include the Cymru Premier results as part of their classified football results sequence and for a while &quot;Soccer Saturday&quot; also included the WPL results but has not done so in recent seasons, and in 2013, Sky Sports removed the league from its vidiprinter as part of a major reduction in the number of competitions that it featured on its vidiprinter service.

On television, brief highlights from one of the day&#x27;s games were featured on BBC Wales&#x27; sports results programme &quot;Wales on Saturday&quot; whilst the BBC also provided a 30-minute highlights programme for Welsh-language broadcaster, S4C, entitled &quot;Y Clwb Pêl-droed&quot;. When the corporation lost the international broadcast rights to BSkyB at the end of the 2003/4 season, S4C won the secondary rights package which included highlights of the national team and all domestic rights. &quot;Sgorio&quot; took over the &quot;Clwb Pêl-droed&quot; slot previously produced by the BBC and in 2010/11 the half-hour highlights programme was dropped in favour of one live game per week. S4C broadcasts in Wales and throughout the rest of the UK via digital satellite with an interactive option for English-language commentary available via digital satellite.

As of the 2018/19 season, S4C show one live game per matchweek from either the league, Welsh Cup or Scottish Challenge Cup if a Welsh team is involved. They also stream all live televised matches on the Sgorio Facebook page, as well as streaming an additional ten per season from these competitions exclusively online.

Weekly highlights of all league games are shown on S4C on a Monday night at 17:30, and thereafter on Sgorio&#x27;s social media and YouTube channels.

The advent of the League has brought increased media coverage for its member clubs, notably from the &quot;Western Mail&quot; and &quot;Daily Post&quot;, as well as local press.

== Clubs ==
Of the 20 clubs that played in the inaugural season of the League of Wales, ten have since been relegated yet to return, with one, Ebbw Vale, folding in 1998. For a list of all clubs past and present see List of Cymru Premier clubs. For a list of winners and runners-up of the Cymru Premier since its inception, and top scorers for each season, see List of Welsh football champions.

Only two clubs have played in every season League of Wales/Cymru Premier since its inception. These two clubs are Aberystwyth Town and Newtown.

<text>The Witwatersrand (, ; ; locally the Rand or, less commonly, the Reef) is a , north-facing scarp in South Africa. It consists of a hard, erosion-resistant quartzite metamorphic rock, over which several north-flowing rivers form waterfalls, which account for the name Witwatersrand, meaning &#x27;white water ridge&#x27; in Afrikaans. This east-west-running scarp can be traced with only one short gap, from Bedfordview (about west of O.R. Tambo International Airport) in the east, through Johannesburg and Roodepoort, to Krugersdorp in the west (see the diagram at left below).

The scarp forms the northern edge of a plateau (or ridge) which rises about above the surrounding plains of the Highveld. A number of picturesque Johannesburg suburbs, including Observatory, Linksfield Ridge and Upper Houghton are located along the scarp, overlooking the rest of northern Johannesburg with views up to the Magaliesburg (although locals refer to segments of the scarp using area-specific names, such as &quot;Linksfield Ridge&quot;, &quot;Parktown Ridge&quot; or Observatory Ridge). The entire plateau-like structure is also often called the Witwatersrand. The plateau&#x27;s elevation above sea-level is between .

The Witwatersrand plateau forms a continental divide, with the run-off to the north draining into the Indian Ocean via the Crocodile and Limpopo rivers, while the run-off to the south drains via the Vaal into the Orange River and ultimately into the Atlantic Ocean.

Because of the extraordinary quantities of gold that have been extracted from the Witwatersrand rocks, the South African currency was named the &quot;rand&quot; in 1961 upon the declaration of the republic.

&quot;Witwatersrand&quot; and &quot;the Rand&quot; are names for the conurbation that developed along the range, although the terms are falling into disuse and &quot;Witwatersrand&quot; was the &quot;W&quot; in &quot;PWV&quot; (Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging), the initial name of Gauteng province. In this context, it has lent its name to institutions including the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits University) and the defunct Rand Afrikaans University (RAU, now part of the University of Johannesburg), and to towns and regions such as the East Rand, West Rand and Randburg.

==Geology==
The Witwatersrand plateau consists of a layer of mainly sedimentary rocks laid down over a period of about 260 million years, starting approximately 2.97 billion years ago. The entire series of rocks, known as the &quot;Witwatersrand Supergroup&quot;, consists of very hard erosion resistant quartzites, banded ironstones and some marine lava deposits, interspersed with softer, more easily eroded tillites, mudstones and conglomerates. The oldest rocks (laid down 2.97 billion years ago) form the northern scarp of the Witwatersrand plateau; the youngest (laid down 2.71 billion years ago) are those that form the southern edge of the plateau.
Gold is found in the conglomerate strata of the younger members of the Supergroup, locally referred to as banket. The abundance of this gold is without a natural equal anywhere else in the world. Over have been mined from these rocks since this precious metal was first discovered here in 1886. This accounts for approximately 22% of all the gold that is accounted for today.

Not all the conglomerates contain gold, and of those that do (known as &quot;reefs&quot; by the miners), the gold is not uniformly distributed throughout the layer, but tends to occur in streaks, where the pebbles that make up the conglomerate are larger than elsewhere. Here the gold is associated with other minerals, especially iron pyrite and uraninite, as well as carbon rich materials such as kerogen, or bitumen, which occurs in small balls less than in size, called &quot;flyspeck carbon&quot;, or as continuous layers about thick. The gold-bearing conglomerates occur chiefly in the upper, younger layers of the Witwatersrand Supergroup of rocks, on the southern side of the Witwatersrand plateau.

The Witwatersrand Supergroup strata which reach the surface in Johannesburg dip downwards to the south at an angle of about 30°. From there on they are almost everywhere, with very few exceptions (see below), covered by younger rocks. Gold mining in these buried portions of the Witwatersrand Supergroup is sometimes carried out at depths of below the surface.

===Witwatersrand Basin===


The Witwatersrand Basin is a largely underground geological formation which surfaces in the Witwatersrand. It holds the world&#x27;s largest known gold reserves and has produced over , which represents about 22% of all the gold accounted for above the surface. The basin straddles the old provinces of Transvaal and the Orange Free State, and consists of a 5000–7000 m thick layer of Archean, mainly sedimentary rocks laid down over a period of about 260 million years, starting about 3 billion years ago. The entire series of rocks, known as the &quot;Witwatersrand Supergroup&quot; consists of quartzites, banded ironstones, mudstones, tillites, conglomerates and some marine lava deposits. Most of the basin is deeply buried under younger rocks, but outcrops occur in Gauteng, the Free State, as well as in some of the surrounding Provinces. The outcrop in Gauteng forms the Witwatersrand ridge, from which the basin and its rocks derive their name. It was on the southern portion of this ridge that gold was first discovered on the farm Langlaagte in 1886, 5 km west of Johannesburg. Since this gold was embedded in a conglomerate, it was first assumed that this was alluvial gold in an old riverbed, that had been tilted as a result of earth movements. However, when it was found that, traced downdip, the conglomerate was not merely developed for the narrow width of a river, but continued in depth, there came the realisation that this conglomeratic zone was part of a sedimentary succession. The conglomerate was quickly traced east and westward for a total continuous distance of to define what became known as the &quot;Central Rand Gold Field&quot;.

It has since been established that the rocks that make up the Witwatersrand Ridge dip downwards and southwards to form the largely underground &quot;Witwatersrand Basin&quot; which covers an elliptical area with a long major axis from Evander in the north-east to Theunissen in the south-west, and wide stretching from Steynsrus in the south-east to Coligny in the north-west, with a small subsidiary basin at Kinross. Gold occurs only along the northern and western margins of this basin, but not in a continuous band. The gold-bearing rocks are limited to six sites where Archean rivers from the north and west formed fan deltas, with many braided channels, before flowing into the &quot;Witwatersrand Sea&quot; to the south, where the earlier sediments that form the older rocks of the Witwatersrand Supergroup had been deposited. Some of these gold bearing fan deltas are now at depths of below the surface.
Although many of the older mines, around Johannesburg, are now nearly exhausted, the Witwatersrand Basin still produces most of South Africa&#x27;s gold and much of the total world output. Silver, uranium, and iridium are recovered as gold-refining by-products.

===Geological origin===
The Witwatersrand basin was created during the Archean Eon, and is therefore amongst the oldest geological structures on Earth. It was laid down in two stages, over the course of 260 million years starting just short of 3 billion years ago. The first phase, lasting 60 million years, consisted of sedimentary deposits in a shallow sea, conveniently named the &quot;Witwatersrand Sea&quot;. The resulting 2500–4500 m thick layer of sediments is termed the &quot;West Rand Group&quot; of Witwatersrand rocks. The second phase, which lasted for 200 million years, followed on from the first phase, with on-land deposits, resulting from the retreat of the Witwatersrand Sea, leaving a wide almost flat coastal plain over which rivers from the north formed wide braided river deltas, into some of which rich deposits of gold were deposited. The resulting 2500 m thick layer of rock is termed the &quot;Central Rand Group&quot;. The &quot;West Rand Group&quot; and &quot;Central Rand Group&quot; of rocks together form the &quot;Witwatersrand Supergroup&quot;, the full horizontal extent of which is termed the Witwatersrand Basin.



 There were no continents during the early stages of the Archean Eon, but island arcs did form. It was the coalescence of several of these island arcs that led to the formation of the Kaapvaal Craton, one of the first microcontinents to form on Earth about 3.9 billion years ago. Its size and position relative to Southern Africa today are indicated in the diagram on the left. About 3 billion years ago local cooling of the underlying asthenosphere caused subsidence of the south eastern portion of this microcontinent below sea level. The floor of this newly formed &quot;Witwatersrand sea&quot; consisted of smoothly eroded granites. Sandy sediments brought in by rivers from the north started being deposited on the granite about 2.97 billion years ago. This sandy layer eventually became compressed to form the Orange Grove Quartzite, the lowermost layer of the Witwatersrand Supergroup. This quartzite layer can be seen lying on its granite base in Johannesburg, where it forms a 56 km long east–west ridge over which several rivers running to the north form waterfalls, giving rise to the name Witwatersrand, which in Afrikaans means &quot;Ridge of White Waters&quot;.
 
There was no free oxygen in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere until about 2 billion years ago, before the appearance and sufficient development of photosynthesizing cyanobacteria. The oxygen produced by these microorganisms rapidly reacted with, amongst others, Fe2+ ions dissolved in water, precipitating insoluble red iron oxide (hematite). For various reasons, the sedimentation of the fine grain mud was affected by cyclic episodes with more or less precipitation of iron oxides. The result was alternating red and beige layers of mud which, when consolidated, became banded ironstones.

As the sea deepened, finer grained and muddy sediments accumulated. Changing geographical conditions resulted in the accumulation of a wide variety of sediments, ranging from mud, to sand, to gravel, and banded ironstones. Tillite deposits, dating from 2.95 billion years ago, are indicative of the first glaciation episodes on earth. Within 60 million years, up to 4500 m of sediment had accumulated on the granite base, to become the &quot;West Rand Group&quot; of rocks that contribute over 60% of the total thickness of the Witwatersrand Supergroup.

Uplifting of the north of the Kaapvaal Craton, in addition to orogenesis (mountain formation), towards the end of the deposition of the &quot;West Rand Group&quot; of sediments caused the Witwatersrand sea to retreat. The area of the craton on top of which Johannesburg is now situated, became a vast riverine plain, which extended along the entire northern and western shoreline of the shrunken sea, in an arc extending from Evander in the east, through Johannesburg, Carletonville and then southwards to Klerksdorp and Welkom in the south-west. The rivers formed braided deltas with many interlacing, slow flowing channels where all the heavy materials brought down from the mountains were deposited: large pebbles, and heavy minerals, such as gold, iron pyrite, and uraninite. The gold was in its free elemental form. Cyanobacteria grew in relative abundance in these mineral rich waters. The kerogen, or bitumen, that is found in association with the gold deposits almost certainly represents what remains of these Archean photosynthesizing micro-organisms.

It is clear that for the next 200 million years the flood plain was repeatedly inundated, sometimes eroded, and sediments re-deposited. The result was a 2500 m thick layer of rock that is termed the &quot;Central Rand Group&quot;, which together with the &quot;West Rand Group&quot;, forms the &quot;Witwatersrand Supergroup&quot;. It is the younger Central Rand Group that contains most of the gold bearing conglomerates, locally referred to as banket, that are today of great economic importance.

The &quot;Central Rand Group&quot; of deposits was brought to an abrupt end by massive outpourings of lava, which form the Ventersdorp lavas which erupted 2.715 billion years ago. The cause of these lava outpourings is a matter of speculation. It might be related to the collision of the Kaapvaal Craton with the Zimbabwe Craton, eventually to become knitted together to form a single continental unit.
A final event that had a major impact on the geology of the Witwatersrand Basin and its exposure in the Johannesburg region, was a massive meteor impact 110 km to the south-west of Johannesburg 2.02 billion years ago. The impact was close to the present village of Vredefort, which has given its name to the geological remnant of this immense event: the Vredefort Dome. Not only are the remains of this impact among the oldest on Earth, but it is also one of the largest meteor impacts to have left its imprint on present-day Earth geology. A meteor 10–15 km across created a 300 km diameter crater, distorting all the rock strata within that circle. Johannesburg is just within the outer edge of this impact crater. In the immediate vicinity of the impact all the subterranean strata were uplifted and upturned, so that Witwatersrand rocks are exposed in an arc 25 km away from the impact centre. There are no gold deposits in these outcrops. The meteor impact, however, lowered the Witwatersrand basin inside the crater. This protected it from erosion later on; but, possibly more importantly, bringing it to the surface close to the crater rim, near Johannesburg. In fact, apart from the Witwatersrand outcrops (i.e. where these rocks are exposed at the surface) in the immediate vicinity of the Vredefort Dome, virtually all the other outcrops occur in an arc approximately 80–120 km from the centre of the impact crater, to the west, north-west, north and north-east. Thus, it is possible that if it had not been for the Vredefort asteroid strike 2 billion years ago, humanity would either never have discovered the rich gold deposits beneath the Southern African surface, or they would have been eroded away during the uninterrupted removal of a several kilometres thick layer of deposits from the surface of the Southern African Plateau in the relatively recent geological past: i.e. the past 150 million years, but especially during the last 20 million years.

===Gold origin===
The vast majority of the Earth&#x27;s gold and other heavy metals are locked up in the earth&#x27;s core. Evidence from tungsten isotope studies indicates that most gold in the crust is derived from gold in the mantle which resulted from a meteorite bombardment some 3.9 billion years ago (i.e., at approximately the time that the Kaapvaal Craton formed). The gold bearing meteorite events occurred millions of years after the segregation of the Earth&#x27;s core.
The gold in the Witwatersrand Basin area was deposited in Archean river deltas having been washed down from surrounding gold-rich greenstone belts to the north and west. Rhenium-osmium isotope studies indicate that the gold in those mineral deposits came from unusual 3 billion year old mantle-derived intrusions known as komatiite, present in the greenstone belts.

==Consequences of mining the ancient Witwatersrand rocks==

Apart from the obvious hollowing out of the rocks below southern Johannesburg, causing unpredictable sinkholes, surface instabilities and earth tremors, the bringing to the surface of rocks that had been laid down in oxygen-free conditions had unforeseen effects. Iron pyrite (FeS2), which is relatively plentiful in the gold ores of the Witwatersrand, oxidises to insoluble ferric oxide (Fe2O3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Thus, when mine waste comes into contact with oxygenated rainwater, sulfuric acid is released into the ground water. Acid mine drainage, as the phenomenon is called, has become a major ecological problem, because it dissolves many of the heavy elements, such as the uranium, cadmium, lead, zinc, copper, arsenic and mercury found in the mine dumps, facilitating their passage into surface water and ground water. The tailings ponds contain an average of 100 mg/kg of U3O8, and uranium levels are measureable in human hair.

Sulfuric acid also erodes concrete and cement structures, resulting in structural damage to buildings and bridges.

==History==
Although gold had been discovered in various locations in South Africa, such as Barberton and Pilgrim&#x27;s Rest, as well as at several sites near the Witwatersrand, these were alluvial concentrates in contemporary rivers, or in quartz veins, in the form that gold had always been found elsewhere on earth. When George Harrison, probably accompanied by George Walker, found gold on the farm Langlaagte, west of what would become the city of Johannesburg, in an outcrop of conglomerate rocks, in February 1886, they assumed that this was alluvial gold in an old riverbed, that had been tilted as a result of earth movements. However, when it was found that, traced downdip, the conglomerate was not merely developed for the narrow width of a river, but continued in depth, there came the realisation that this conglomeratic zone was part of a sedimentary succession. Harrison had stumbled on the Main Reef conglomerate (part of the &quot;Johannesburg Subgroup&quot; of rocks — see illustration above). The conglomerate was quickly traced east and westward for a total continuous distance of to define what became known as the &quot;Central Rand Gold Field&quot;.

Harrison declared his claim to the government of the Zuid Afrikaanse Republiek (ZAR), and in September 1886 President Paul Kruger issued a proclamation declaring nine farms public mining diggings, starting on 20 September 1886. This heralded the historic Witwatersrand Gold Rush. Harrison is believed to have sold his claim for less than £10 before leaving the area, and he was never heard from again.

Harrison&#x27;s original Zoekers&#x27; (in English: seekers&#x27;, or prospectors&#x27;) Claim No 19 was declared a national monument in 1944, and named Harrison&#x27;s Park. The park is on the busy Main Reef Road, immediately west of Nasrec Road.
In 1887 Cecil John Rhodes registered &quot;The Gold Fields of South Africa&quot; in London, South Africa&#x27;s first mining house, with a capital of . His brother Thomas was the first chairman.

<text>A gondola lift is a means of cable transport and type of aerial lift which is supported and propelled by cables from above. It consists of a loop of steel wire rope that is strung between two stations, sometimes over intermediate supporting towers. The cable is driven by a bullwheel in a terminal, which is typically connected to an engine or electric motor. It is often considered a &quot;continuous system&quot; since it features a haul rope which continuously moves and circulates around two terminal stations. In contrast, an aerial tramway operates solely with fixed grips and simply shuttles back and forth between two end terminals.

The capacity, cost, and functionality of a gondola lift will differ dramatically depending on the combination of cables used for support and haulage and the type of grip (detachable or fixed). Because of the proliferation of such systems in the Alps, the and are also used in English-language texts. The systems may also be referred to as cable cars.

==History==

The Kohlerer-Bahn opened on June 29, 1908, in Bolzano, South Tyrol, the first modern aerial enclosed cable car solely for passenger service.

==Types==

===Passenger lift===

In some systems the passenger cabins, which can hold between two and fifteen people, are connected to the cable by means of spring–loaded grips. These grips allow the cabin to be detached from the moving cable and slowed in the terminals, to allow passengers to board and disembark. Doors are almost always automatic and controlled by a lever on the roof or on the undercarriage that is pushed up or down. Cabins are driven through the terminals either by rotating tires, or by a chain system. To be accelerated to and decelerated from line speed, cabins are driven along by progressively swifter (or slower) rotating tires until they reach line or terminal speed. On older installations, gondolas are accelerated manually by an operator. Gondola lifts can have intermediate stops that allow for uploading and downloading on the lift. Examples of a lift with three stops instead of the standard two are the Village Gondola, the Excalibur Gondolas at Whistler Blackcomb and the Skyride at Alton Towers.

In other systems the cable is slowed intermittently to allow passengers to disembark and embark the cabins at stations, and to allow people in the cars along the route to take photographs, such as Lebanon&#x27;s Téléférique which offers an exceptional view to the Mediterranean, the historical Jounieh Bay and the pine forest at the 80% slope which this gondola lift goes over. Such a system is called &quot;pulse cabin&quot; and usually several cabins are loaded simultaneously.
Open-air gondolas, or cabriolets as commonly called, are fairly uncommon and are quite primitive because they are exposed to the elements. Their cabins are usually hollow cylinders, open from chest height up, with floors and roof covers. They are usually used as village gondolas and for short distances. Examples are at Mont Tremblant Resort in Quebec, Canada, and at Blue Mountain Ski Resort (summer only, in the winter it is converted to a six person high-speed chairlift.) in Ontario, Canada, The Canyons Resort in Park City, Utah, Mountain Creek, and the new Village Cabriolet at Winter Park Resort in Colorado. Open-air gondolas can also come in a style similar to that of pulse gondolas, like the Village Gondola at Panorama Ski Resort, British Columbia.

The first gondola built in the United States for a ski resort was at the Wildcat Mountain Ski Area. It was a two-person gondola built in 1957 and serviced skiers until 1999. The lift was later demolished in 2004. The lift and its cabins were manufactured by a former Italian lift company: Carlevaro-Savio. One of the longest gondola rides in the world, Gondelbahn Grindelwald-Männlichen, is in the Bernese Oberland in Switzerland and connects Grindelwald with Männlichen.

==== Urban transport ====
In recent years, gondola lifts are finding increased usage in urban environments. Cable cars used for urban transit include the Metrocable in Medellín, Colombia and the TransMiCable in Bogotá, Colombia; Aerovia in Guayaquil, Ecuador; Portland Aerial Tram in Portland, Oregon, United States; Roosevelt Island Tramway in New York City, New York, United States; Metrocable in Caracas, Venezuela; Trolcable in Mérida, Venezuela; Cable Aéreo in Manizales, Colombia; Mi Teleférico in La Paz, Bolivia; Mexicable in the State of Mexico, Mexico; Teleférico de Santo Domingo; Yenimahalle-Şentepe teleferik in Ankara, Turkey; Maçka and Eyüp Gondolas in Istanbul; the London cable car in London, England; Nizhny Novgorod Cableway, Russia. The Metrocable systems in Medellin and Caracas are fully integrated with the public transit network which provides passengers the ability to seamlessly transfer to the local metro lines, whereas the network in La Paz, the largest in the world, forms the backbone of the city&#x27;s public transit system itself.

Disney Skyliner is a gondola-lift service, which opened on September 29, 2019, at Walt Disney World in central Florida. The system uses multiple lines and has five stations, and it connects Epcot and Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios with one another and with several Disney-owned and -operated resort hotels.

In terms of urban gondola systems for the future, TransLink in Metro Vancouver has proposed to build a gondola up Burnaby Mountain to Simon Fraser University in an announcement in September 2010. The project was sidelined in 2014, but was revived in 2017.

In late 2012, a widespread aerial gondola system was proposed for Austin, Texas, in an effort to expand mass transit options in the rapidly growing city. The proposal was rejected by the local transit agency in 2017.

A proposed gondola system in Montreal was ultimately rejected by the Old Port of Montreal.

===Ropeway conveyor===

A ropeway conveyor or material ropeway is essentially a subtype of gondola lift, from which containers for goods rather than passenger cars are suspended.

Ropeway conveyors are typically found around large mining concerns, and can be of considerable length. The COMILOG Cableway, which ran from Moanda in Gabon to Mbinda in the Republic of the Congo, was over in length. The Kristineberg-Boliden ropeway in Sweden had a length of .

In Eritrea, the Italians built the Asmara-Massawa Cableway in 1936, which was long. The Manizales - Mariquita Cableway (1922) in Colombia was 73 km long.

Conveyors can be powered by a wide variety of forms of power sources: electric motors, internal combustion engines, steam engines, or gravity. Gravity is particularly common in mountainous mining concerns, and directly employed; the weight of loaded down-going containers pulling the returning empties back up the slope. Gravity can also be used indirectly, where running water is available; a waterwheel is powered by gravity acting on water, and is used to power the cable.

===Bicable and tricable gondola lifts===

Conventional systems where a single cable provides both support and propulsion of the cabins are often called monocable gondola lifts. Gondola lifts which feature one stationary cable (known as the &#x27;support&#x27; rope), and one haul rope are known as bicable gondola lifts, while lifts that feature two support ropes and one haul rope are known as tricable gondola lifts. Famous examples of bicable gondola lifts include the Ngong Ping 360 in Hong Kong, the Singapore Cable Car, and the Sulphur Mountain Gondola in Banff, Canada. This system has the advantage that the stationary cable&#x27;s strength and properties can be tailored to each span, which reduces costs. They differ from aerial tramways, as these consist only of one or two usually larger cabins moving back and forth, rather than circulating. Bicable and tricable systems provide greater lateral stability compared with monocable systems, allowing the system to operate in higher cross-winds.

== List of accidents ==
The National Ski Areas Association reports 0.138 fatalities per 100 million miles transported compared to 1.23 for cars.

* October 22, 1979: one person was killed and 17 other injured when two gondolas fell from the &quot;Swiss Sky Ride&quot; at the Texas State Fair. Winds gusting to caused three cars to collide and two fell on midway games below the cable.
* January 29, 1983: seven people were killed in the Singapore Cable Car disaster when two cabins plunged into the sea after the cableway was hit by a Panamanian-registered oil rig being towed.
* September 5, 2005: nine people died and ten were injured when a concrete block was accidentally dropped by a construction helicopter in Sölden, Austria. Hundreds had to be evacuated from the lift.
* March 2, 2008: a man fell out of a gondola in Chamonix and died, perhaps after he and one of his friends leaned on and broke the plexiglass window.

<doc id="298682" wikidata="Q890069" url="?curid=298682" title="Body integrity dysphoria">
<text>Body integrity dysphoria (BID), also referred to as body integrity identity disorder (BIID), amputee identity disorder or xenomelia, and formerly called apotemnophilia, is a rare mental disorder characterized by a desire to have a sensory or physical disability or feeling discomfort with being able-bodied, beginning in early adolescence and resulting in harmful consequences. BID appears to be related to somatoparaphrenia. People with this condition may refer to themselves as transabled, but the term is controversial.

==Signs and symptoms==
BID is a rare, infrequently studied condition in which there is a mismatch between the mental body image and the physical body, characterized by an intense desire for amputation or paralysis of a limb, usually a leg, or to become blind or deaf. In some cases, the person can have a sense of sexual arousal connected with the desire for loss of a limb, movement, or sense.

Some become somewhat more comfortable with their own bodies by using prostheses and other tools to help their dysphoria, such as using a wheelchair or by blocking their vision or hearing. Some people with BID have reported to the media or by interview with researchers that they have resorted to self-amputation of a &quot;superfluous&quot; limb by, for example, allowing a train to run over it or otherwise damaging it so severely that surgeons will have to amputate it. However, the medical literature records few cases of self-amputation apart from that of cricket historian Rowland Bowen, who self-amputated one of his legs below the knee in 1968.

To the extent that generalizations can be made, people with BID appear to start to wish for amputation when they are young, between eight and twelve years of age, and often knew a person with an amputated limb when they were children; however, people with BID tend to seek treatment only when they are much older. People with BID seem to be predominantly male, and while there is no evidence that sexual preference is relevant, there does seem to be a correlation with BID and a person having a paraphilia; there appears to be a weak correlation with personality disorders. Family psychiatric history does not appear to be relevant, and there does not appear to be any strong correlation with the site of the limb or limbs that the person wishes they did not have, nor with any past trauma to the undesired limb.

==Causes==
As of 2014 the cause was not clear and was a subject of ongoing research.
However a small sample of people with body integrity dysphoria connected to their left leg have had MRI scans that showed less gray matter in the right side of their superior parietal lobule. The amount of gray matter missing was correlated to the strength of the patients&#x27; desire to remove their leg.

==Diagnosis==
In the ICD-11, BID is included under the category &quot;Disorders of bodily distress or bodily experience&quot;. It is &quot;characterised by an intense and persistent desire to become physically disabled in a significant way (e.g. major limb amputee, paraplegic, blind), with onset by early adolescence accompanied by persistent discomfort, or intense feelings of inappropriateness concerning current non-disabled body configuration. The desire to become physically disabled results in harmful consequences, as manifested by either the preoccupation with the desire (including time spent pretending to be disabled) significantly interfering with productivity, with leisure activities, or with social functioning (e.g. person is unwilling to have close relationships because it would make it difficult to pretend) or by attempts to actually become disabled have resulted in the person putting his or her health or life in significant jeopardy. The disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder, by a Disease of the Nervous System or by another medical condition, or by Malingering.&quot; A diagnosis of gender dysphoria must be ruled out.

===Classification===
Prior to the release of the ICD-11, the diagnosis of BID as a mental disorder was controversial. There was debate about including it in the DSM-5, and it was not included; it was also not included in the ICD-10. It has been included in the ICD-11, which reached a stable version in June 2018, as &#x27;Body integrity dysphoria&#x27; with code 6C21.

==Treatment==
There is no evidence-based treatment for BID; there are reports of the use of cognitive behavioral therapy and antidepressants.

The ethics of surgically amputating the undesired limb of a person with BID are difficult and controversial.

==Prognosis==
Outcomes of treated and untreated BID are not known; there are numerous case reports that amputation permanently resolves the desire in affected individuals.
==History==
Apotemnophilia was first described in a 1977 article by psychologists Gregg Furth and John Money as primarily sexually oriented. In 1986 Money described a similar condition he called acrotomophilia; namely, sexual arousal in response to a partner&#x27;s amputation. Publications before 2004 were generally case studies. The condition received public attention in the late 1990s after Scottish surgeon Robert Smith amputated limbs of two otherwise healthy people who were desperate to have this done.

In 2004 Michael First published the first clinical research in which he surveyed fifty-two people with the condition, a quarter of whom had undergone an amputation. Based on that work, First coined the term &quot;body integrity identity disorder&quot; to express what he saw as more of an identity disorder than a paraphilia. After First&#x27;s work, efforts to study BID as a neurological condition looked for possible causes in the brains of people with BID using neuroimaging and other techniques. Research provisionally found that people with BID were more likely to want removal of a left limb than right, consistent with damage to the right parietal lobe; in addition, skin conductance response is significantly different above and below the line of desired amputation, and the line of desired amputation remains stable over time, with the desire often beginning in early childhood. This work did not completely explain the condition, and psychosexual research has been ongoing as well.
