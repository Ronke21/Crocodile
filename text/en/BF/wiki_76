<text>Twister is a 1996 American disaster film directed by Jan de Bont, and written by Michael Crichton and Anne-Marie Martin. It was produced by Crichton, Kathleen Kennedy, and Ian Bryce, with Steven Spielberg, Walter Parkes, Laurie MacDonald, and Gerald R. Molen serving as executive producers. The film stars an ensemble cast that includes Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton, Jami Gertz, and Cary Elwes. It follows a group of storm chasers trying to deploy a tornado research device during a severe outbreak in Oklahoma.

&quot;Twister&quot; was released in theaters on May 10, 1996 by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States and Canada and internationally by Universal Pictures through United International Pictures, and grossed $495.7 million worldwide, becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 1996; it sold an estimated 54.7 million tickets in the United States. It received generally positive reviews from critics and received Academy Award nominations for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound. It is notable for being among the first films to be released on DVD in the United States. A sequel, &quot;Twisters&quot;, was released on July 19, 2024.

== Plot ==
On an Oklahoma farm in 1969, young Jo Harding, her parents, and their dog take shelter from an F5 tornado that destroys their farm and kills Jo&#x27;s father as he tries to secure their cellar door. Twenty-seven years later, Jo is a tornado-obsessed meteorologist leading a team of storm chasers. Her estranged husband, Bill, an ex-storm chaser turned TV weatherman, travels to Oklahoma with his fiancée Melissa to obtain Jo&#x27;s signature on their divorce papers.

Jo shows Bill the realized &quot;Dorothy&quot;, a device containing hundreds of small weather sensors that he conceptualized. Dorothy could revolutionize tornado research and potentially provide an earlier storm-warning system, but the device must be deployed dangerously close to a tornado to work. Jo&#x27;s team rushes off to chase a developing storm with her failing to sign the papers, forcing Bill and Melissa to follow. Bill soon learns that Jonas Miller, a rival storm chaser and former colleague with corporate funding, has stolen his idea for his own Dorothy-like device, Dot3, with plans to deploy it first and claim credit for its design. Enraged, Bill agrees to accompany Jo and the team for one day to launch Dorothy. 

As the team pursues a developing tornado, Bill drives Jo&#x27;s truck into a ditch, attempting to get in front of the damage path. However, the tornado strengthens into an F2, and after destroying a barn, it corners the truck in front of a bridge. Jo and Bill shelter under the bridge as the tornado destroys the vehicle and one of the four Dorothy prototypes. With more storms developing, Bill leads the team in his own truck, and chases a high-end F2 tornado. They encounter Jonas&#x27;s team just as Bill predicts a change in the tornado&#x27;s path and diverts their course. The team follows the F2 now with a group of waterspouts on Kaw Lake, and one of them develops another vortex, which spins the truck around before disappearing. Jo and Bill are elated by the thrill, but Melissa becomes traumatized in the process.

The team visits Jo&#x27;s Aunt Meg in nearby Wakita for rest and food. Dusty, a member of Jo&#x27;s team, tells stories about Bill&#x27;s crazy past career as a storm chaser to Melissa, but Bill claims that he had killed his old personality. The team then scrambles to chase a developing twister that had just been forming. Jo and Bill intercept an F3 with unpredictable movements, and it soon knocks over powerlines that crush Dorothy II. With the truck damaged, Bill forces them to retreat, but Jo undergoes an emotional breakdown over the failure, and unloads about her motivations and her father&#x27;s death. Bill admits his feelings for Jo, unaware that Melissa is overhearing them through the CB radio.

The team overnights in Fairview to repair their vehicles, while Jo signs the papers. A nocturnal F4 wedge tornado unexpectedly appears, and it forces the team and others into a garage pit near a drive-in theater for protection. The tornado destroys the garage and two team vehicles as the result of tossed debris, and injures several people before proceeding toward Wakita. Before the team rush there, Melissa ends her and Bill&#x27;s relationship, encouraging him to reunite with Jo. The town&#x27;s storm sirens provide little warning time ahead of the tornado, which leaves Wakita in ruins and flattens Aunt Meg&#x27;s house, though the team is able to rescue Aunt Meg. 

The National Severe Storms Laboratory forecasts that a potentially record-breaking tornado will form the next day. Inspired by Aunt Meg&#x27;s wind-vane sculptures, Bill and Jo add aluminum &quot;wings&quot; to the last two Dorothy prototype sensors, making them more aerodynamic. True to the forecast, a mile-wide F5 tornado forms the next day, and the team pursues it. Bill and Jo attempt to place Dorothy III in its path; however, the device is knocked over and destroyed by an airborne tree. Meanwhile, Jonas attempts to deploy Dot3, ignoring Bill and Jo&#x27;s warnings that the tornado is changing direction and headed straight at them. The tornado sweeps Jonas&#x27;s truck away, killing him and his driver. With the last remaining Dorothy affixed to the truck bed, Bill and Jo drive directly at the tornado, then jump out, sacrificing Bill&#x27;s truck to ensure that Dorothy IV can release its probes into the wedge. The gamble is successful, as Dorothy IV&#x27;s probes provide immediate scientific data, but without their truck, Jo and Bill are forced to run as the tornado shifts toward them. Inside a nearby pumphouse, they strap themselves to deep pipes. As the building rips away, the F5&#x27;s core passes over them. After the tornado dissipates, the team celebrate their success and Jo and Bill reconcile.

== Production ==
=== Development and writing ===
&quot;Twister&quot; was produced by Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Amblin Entertainment, with financial backing from Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures. In return, Warner Bros. was given the North American distribution rights, while Universal&#x27;s joint-venture distribution company, United International Pictures (UIP), obtained international distribution rights. The pitch was not a script, but a proof of concept clip of the visual effects by Industrial Light &amp; Magic, done entirely in computer-generated imagery and featuring a pickup truck driving towards a tornado pulling up a tractor, with one of its tires snapping off and smashing through the truck&#x27;s windshield. ILM assigned Stefen Fangmeier to be the effects supervisor for his experience with tornadoes, having helped create simulations while working with storm chasers in the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.

Spielberg himself was originally attached to direct the project, and directors such as James Cameron, John Badham, Tim Burton, and Robert Zemeckis were also in talks to helm the film before Jan de Bont signed on to &quot;Twister&quot; after leaving &quot;Godzilla&quot; due to creative differences. De Bont was invited by Spielberg after the success of directorial debut &quot;Speed&quot;, which was released in 1994, following a long career as a director of photography, and described the project as &quot;a Grimm fairy tale where the monster comes out of dark clouds&quot;. Michael Crichton and his wife and co-author, Anne-Marie Martin, were paid $2.5 million for a screenplay, which started being written in January 1994. Crichton said the two bases for the script were a PBS documentary about storm chasers and the plot of romantic comedy &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;, where a newspaper editor and his ex who is engaged to another man do one last job together. Two screenwriters would later sue the studios claiming &quot;Twister&quot; was taken from their ideas: Daniel Perkins, whose script &quot;Tornado Chasers&quot; dealt with the military harnessing tornadoes as weapons and settled for an undisclosed amount; and Stephen B. Kessler, author of a script about storm chasers in Oklahoma called &quot;Catch the Wind&quot;, and whose case was eventually dismissed. Dorothy was inspired by TOTO, an instrumented barrel-shaped device used to research tornadoes in the 1980s. De Bont pushed to make the dialogue &quot;very energized&quot; to reflect the excitement experienced by storm chasers, adding that the dialogue &quot;gets very stilted very quickly&quot; if it is not &quot;moving forward and energized in the same pattern as the action&quot;, while encouraging the cast to improvise their lines. He also attempted to reduce the amount of establishing scenes and exposition &quot;that makes a movie almost immediately less interesting&quot; while feeling that &quot;things will explain themselves as you keep watching&quot;, but the studio insisted on it. For the explanatory moments there was a focus on the character of Melissa, serving as an audience surrogate given she had no experience with storm chasing.

Helen Hunt was de Bont&#x27;s first choice to play Jo Harding, and while the studio was reluctant because of her lack of big movie roles, he insisted, considering her a good actress who could deliver the physical demands of the role. Hunt initially was uninterested, declaring that &quot;I just didn’t know what I could really contribute acting-wise&quot;, but changed her mind after having lunch with de Bont and Spielberg at Amblin&#x27;s offices. Tom Hanks read for the part of Bill Harding but passed on the film and suggested that Paxton try for the role. De Bont wanted the storm chaser crew to resemble the ones he met during pre-production, a team of University of Oklahoma grad students. The National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Oklahoma worked closely with the production, training the crew on weather safety, allowing the actors to visit their facilities and go along on a tornado chase, and providing consultations on the script that included discarding an impossible tornado that would last a day and a half to instead go for an outbreak of tornadoes, which could strike at any place at any time, in any location, and with different magnitudes.

=== Filming ===
The production was plagued with problems; Joss Whedon was brought in to rewrite the script through the early spring of 1995. When Whedon contracted bronchitis, Steven Zaillian was brought in to work on revisions. Whedon later returned and worked on revisions through the start of shooting in May 1995, then left the project after he got married. Two weeks into production, Jeff Nathanson was flown to the set and worked on the script until principal photography ended. Among the changes, Hunt complained that Jo and Melissa&#x27;s interactions were &quot;sort of catty with each other&quot;, prompting her to tell the producers “That’s not gonna be fun to play or to watch. I’m not sure if I want to do that.” After the Oklahoma City bombing occurred on April 19, 1995, filming of &quot;Twister&quot; was suspended while the cast and crew worked with relief efforts.

Filming was to originally take place in California, but De Bont insisted the film be shot on location in Oklahoma. Shooting occurred all over the state; several scenes, including the opening scene where the characters meet each other, and the first tornado chase in the Jeep pickup, were filmed in Fairfax and Ralston, Oklahoma. The scene at the automotive repair shop was filmed in Maysville and Norman. The waterspout scenes were filmed on Kaw Lake near Kaw City. The drive-in scene was filmed at a real drive-in theater in Guthrie, though some of the scene, such as Melissa&#x27;s hotel room, was filmed in Stillwater near the Oklahoma State University campus. Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1980 film &quot;The Shining&quot; was played during the sequence.

The real town of Wakita – serving as the hometown of Lois Smith&#x27;s character, Meg, in the film – was used during filming, and a section of the older part of town was demolished for the scene, showing the aftermath of the F4 tornado that devastates the town. This location was selected after scouts discovered leftover debris from a major hailstorm that occurred two years earlier in June 1993. Most of the residents signed up as extras and were paid $100 per day. Additional scenes and B-roll were filmed near Ponca City and Pauls Valley, among several other smaller farm towns across the state. However, due to changing seasons that massively transformed the look of Oklahoma&#x27;s topography, filming was moved to Iowa. The climactic scene with the F5 tornado was almost entirely shot around Eldora, Iowa, with the cornfield the characters run through located near Ames.

Halfway through filming, both Paxton and Hunt were temporarily blinded by bright electronic lamps used to make the sky behind the two actors look dark and stormy. Paxton remembers that &quot;these things literally sunburned our eyeballs. I got back to my room, I couldn&#x27;t see&quot;. To solve the problem, a Plexiglas filter was placed in front of the beams. The actors took eye drops and wore special glasses for a few days to recuperate. After filming in a particularly unsanitary ditch (for the first tornado chase scene, in which Bill and Jo are forced to shelter from an approaching F1 tornado under a short bridge), Hunt and Paxton needed hepatitis shots. During the same sequence, Hunt repeatedly hit her head on a low wooden bridge, and was so exhausted from the demanding shoot that she stood up quickly and struck her head on a beam. During one stunt in which Hunt opened the door of a vehicle speeding through a cornfield, she momentarily let go of the door and it struck her on the side of the head. Some sources claim she received a concussion in the incident. De Bont said, &quot;I love Helen to death, but you know, she can be also a little bit clumsy&quot;. She responded, &quot;Clumsy? The guy burned my retinas, but I&#x27;m clumsy ... I thought I was a good sport. I don&#x27;t know ultimately if Jan chalks me up as that or not, but one would hope so&quot;. Jo and Bill inside the F5 tornado was filmed by rolling the set in a gimbal so the ground stood in the ceiling as Hunt and Paxton hung from a metal bar, with the footage then being flipped upside down to appear as if they were being sucked upwards by the storm.

Bad weather was frequent during production, with hailstorms, lightning, floods, and mud. Some crew members, feeling that De Bont was &quot;out of control&quot;, left the production five weeks into filming. The camera crew led by Don Burgess claimed De Bont &quot;didn&#x27;t know what he wanted till he saw it. He would shoot one direction, with all the equipment behind the view of the camera, and then he&#x27;d want to shoot in the other direction right away and we&#x27;d have to move [everything] and he&#x27;d get angry that we took too long ... and it was always everybody else&#x27;s fault, never his&quot;. De Bont claims that they had to schedule at least three scenes every day because the weather changed so often, and &quot;Don had trouble adjusting to that&quot;.

When De Bont, in a fit of rage, knocked over a camera assistant who missed a cue into a ditch and refused to apologize, Burgess and his crew walked off the set, much to the shock of the cast. They remained in place for one more week until Jack N. Green&#x27;s crew agreed to replace them. Following the incident, Spielberg angrily flew down to Oklahoma to admonish De Bont for his behavior. Two days before principal filming ended, Green was injured when a hydraulic house set (used in the scene in which Jo and Bill rescue Meg and her dog Mose from her destroyed home in Wakita), designed to collapse on cue, was mistakenly activated with him inside it. A rigged ceiling hit him in the head and injured his back, requiring him to be hospitalized. De Bont took over as his own director of photography for the remaining shots.

Because overcast skies were not always available, De Bont had to shoot many of the film&#x27;s tornado-chasing scenes in bright sunlight, requiring Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) to more than double its original plan for 150 &quot;digital sky-replacement&quot; shots. Principal photography was originally given a deadline to allow Hunt to return to film the fourth season of her NBC sitcom &quot;Mad About You&quot;, but when shooting ran over schedule, series creator and actor Paul Reiser agreed to delay the show&#x27;s production for two and a half weeks so &quot;Twister&quot; could finish filming. De Bont insisted on using multiple cameras, which led to the exposure of of film, compared to the usual maximum of . The crew used a Boeing 707 airplane engine and smaller fans to generate wind throughout the film. Pickup trucks followed the actors&#x27; vehicles to throw debris, including ice pieces to simulate hail, made with an ice machine imported from a neighbor state as Oklahoma lacked them. Ford Motor Company tried to get the 1997 F-150 as the main vehicle of the movie, but were beaten by Chrysler and their Dodge Ram. Five Rams were provided, one of which was a prototype to be used in scenes where the vehicle suffered extensive damage, and the trucks went through 20 windshields as they were broken by the flying debris. Chrysler also provided eight Dodge Caravan minivans. The scene where a tornado drops tractors in the way of the protagonists&#x27; truck was achieved by dropping the combines from helicopters onto the road, and filming with longer lenses to make the distance seem very close when they were actually away.

=== Post-production ===
De Bont claimed that &quot;Twister&quot; cost close to $70 million, of which $2–3 million went to the director. Last-minute reshoots in March and April 1996 (to clarify a scene about Jo as a child) and overtime requirements in post production and at ILM, are thought to have raised the budget to $90 million.

During post-production of &quot;Twister&quot;, Spielberg took over directing duties on &quot;Minority Report&quot; instead of &quot;The Haunting&quot;, which ultimately was directed by de Bont.

The tornadoes in the film were created with computer animation. Particle system expert Habib Zargarpour used the software Dynamation to develop the basis for the digital tornadoes, consisting of millions of tiny particles that made up a spinning, fast-moving funnel cloud, which Zargarpour compared to packing together little scoops of ice cream. To compose the sound effects of these twisters, De Bont had recorded a variety of combined sound effects, including lion roars, tiger growls, camel moans, and jet-engine wooshes. Other special effects that were animated with CGI included telephone poles, trees, trucks, tractors, and whole houses. The CGI cow was built from a CGI zebra from the 1995 film &quot;Jumanji&quot;.

== Release ==
=== Theatrical ===
Originally, &quot;Twister&quot; was set to be released on May 17, 1996. Warner eventually made the decision to push forward its release date to May 10, 1996, in order to avoid competition with Paramount&#x27;s &quot;&quot; two weeks later. The premiere took place at the AMC Penn Square 10, then known as General Cinema Theatres at Penn Square Mall in Oklahoma City a day prior on May 9, 1996. Jan de Bont, Bill Paxton, and Helen Hunt were at the mall for interviews. The film would go on to receive a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America due to &quot;intense depiction of very bad weather&quot;. On August 30, 2024, &quot;Twister&quot; was re-released in theaters nationwide in 4DX, along with &quot;Twisters&quot; for one week only.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Twister&quot; was released on LaserDisc and VHS by Warner Home Video on October 1, 1996. It was the division&#x27;s first home video release to be THX certified. A widescreen VHS release became available at the same time. There is a message by James Lee Witt, the then-head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) at the end of the film. By November 1996, it topped the number one spot in &quot;Billboard&quot;″s top sales. The film was released on DVD on March 25, 1997, and was the first feature film to be released on the DVD format. The DVD release occurred eleven days before &quot;Twister&quot; made its United States pay-cable debut on HBO on April 5, 1997. &quot;Twister&quot; was then released on VHS by MCA/Universal Home Video through CIC Video in the UK on March 10, 1997, and July 14, 1997.

The film was re-released on DVD on June 6, 2000. Special features on this release include an audio commentary by Jan de Bont and Stefen Fangmeier to listen throughout the film, behind-the-scenes footage, trailers and a Van Halen music video. Eight years later on May 6, 2008, a two-disc special edition DVD and Blu-ray were released. An HD DVD was then released on May 27, becoming one of the last HD DVDs to be ever released.

The film was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment with a new Dolby Atmos audio mix on July 9, 2024 and also a double feature Blu-Ray and DVD with &quot;Twisters&quot; by the film’s international distributor, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, on October 22.

=== Soundtracks ===
&quot;Twister&quot; featured both a traditional orchestral film score composed by Mark Mancina, and a soundtrack of rock-music singles, many of which were exclusive releases for the film. Both the soundtrack and the orchestral score featured an instrumental theme song (&quot;Respect the Wind&quot;) composed and performed for the film by Alex (his only recording outside of Van Halen) and Eddie Van Halen. The film&#x27;s music was released on CD and cassette tape formats.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Twister&quot; opened on May 10, 1996, earning $41.1 million from 2,414 total theaters during its opening weekend, and ranked in the number-one spot at the North American box office, beating both &quot;The Craft&quot; and &quot;The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs&quot;. Upon its release, the film topped &quot;The Birdcage&quot; to have the biggest 1996 opening. At that time, it had the sixth-largest opening weekend of any film, behind &quot;The Lion King&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, and &quot;Batman Forever&quot;. Moreover, the film had the largest May opening weekend, dethroning both &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot; and &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. The success of &quot;Twister&quot; helped the blockbusters of May officially begin the summer season. Similar openings would follow, such as that of &quot;Deep Impact&quot; in 1998 and &quot;The Mummy&quot; in 1999. Two years later in 2001, &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; set a new precedent for the frame by unleashing an opening weekend of $68.1 million. Then in 2002, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; took the summer starter films to the next level with its $114.8 million opening weekend.

During its second weekend, &quot;Twister&quot; managed to top &quot;Flipper&quot; with an additional $37 million. It was ranked as the second-highest-grossing second weekend at the time, after &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. The film suffered only a 10% second-weekend drop, making it the smallest decline for a non-holiday film. For 15 years, &quot;Twister&quot; held that record until it was surpassed by DreamWorks&#x27; &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; in 2011. By May 21, it reached the $100-million mark. Not too long after, the number-one spot was taken by &quot;&quot;, putting &quot;Twister&quot; into second place. Like its predecessor, the film also had the largest May opening weekend. It went on to hold this record until 1997, when it was taken by &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;. As for &quot;Twister&quot;, it continued to stay in second place while beating out &quot;Dragonheart&quot;. When &quot;The Rock&quot; was released that June, the film was put into third place. It then approached $200 million by June 19, becoming the first film to do so since &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. &quot;Twister&quot; fell into fifth place shortly after the releases of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; and &quot;Eraser&quot;. After &quot;Independence Day&quot; was released in July, the film crossed over &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; to become the 13th-highest domestic grossing film of all time. It continued to dominate the box office, especially during the Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia.

After 12 weeks of release, the film had earned $231.3 million and had become 12th-highest domestic grosser, surpassing &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. &quot;Twister&quot; went on to earn a total of $241.7 million at the North American box office, and a worldwide total of $494.5 million during its theatrical run. It became the second-highest-grossing film of 1996, behind &quot;Independence Day&quot;, and was the 10th-highest-grossing film in history at the time of its release, making it the most successful Warner Bros. film release, surpassing &quot;Batman&quot;. In 2001, &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot; broke &quot;Twister&quot;″s record for being the highest-grossing Warner Bros. film of all time.

In China, &quot;Twister&quot; was the second-highest-grossing Hollywood film in the country, behind &quot;True Lies&quot;, making a total gross of .

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Twister&quot; holds an approval rating of 67% based on 141 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;A high-concept blockbuster that emphasizes special effects over three-dimensional characters, &quot;Twister&quot;″s visceral thrills are often offset by the film&#x27;s generic plot.&quot; On Metacritic, the film had a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars out of four and wrote, &quot;As drama, &quot;Twister&quot; resides in the Zone. It has no time to waste on character, situation, dialogue and nuance. The dramatic scenes are holding actions between tornadoes. As spectacle, however, &quot;Twister&quot; is impressive. The tornadoes are big, loud, violent and awesome, and they look great&quot;. In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin wrote, &quot;Somehow &quot;Twister&quot; stays as up-tempo and exuberant as a roller-coaster ride, neatly avoiding the idea of real danger&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;B&quot; rating, and Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, &quot;Yet the images that linger longest in my memory are those of windswept livestock. And that, in a teacup, sums up everything that&#x27;s right, and wrong, about this appealingly noisy but ultimately flyaway first blockbuster of summer&quot;. In his review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Kenneth Turan wrote, &quot;But the ringmaster of this circus, the man without whom nothing would be possible, is director De Bont, who now must be considered Hollywood&#x27;s top action specialist. An expert in making audiences squirm and twist, at making us feel the rush of experience right along with the actors, De Bont choreographs action and suspense so beautifully he makes it seem like a snap.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Richard Schickel wrote, &quot;when action is never shown to have deadly or pitiable consequences, it tends toward abstraction. Pretty soon you&#x27;re not tornado watching, you&#x27;re special-effects watching&quot;. In his review for the &quot;Washington Post&quot; Desson Howe wrote, &quot;it&#x27;s a triumph of technology over storytelling and the actors&#x27; craft. Characters exist merely to tell a couple of jokes, cower in fear of downdrafts and otherwise kill time between tornadoes&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
== Legacy ==
On May 24, 1996, a tornado destroyed Screen No. 3 at the Can-View Drive-In, a drive-in theater in Thorold, Ontario, which was scheduled to show &quot;Twister&quot; later that evening, in a real-life parallel to a scene in the film in which a tornado destroys a drive-in during a showing of the film &quot;The Shining&quot;. The facts of this incident were exaggerated into an urban legend that the theater was actually playing &quot;Twister&quot; during the tornado.

On May 10, 2010, the 14th anniversary of the film&#x27;s U.S. release, a tornado struck Fairfax, Oklahoma, destroying the farmhouse where numerous scenes in &quot;Twister&quot; were shot. J. Berry Harrison, the owner of the home and a former Oklahoma state senator, commented that the tornado appeared eerily similar to the fictitious one in the film. He had lived in the home since 1978.

Following the film&#x27;s release, the number of meteorological majors in the United States increased by about 10 percent in the late 1990s. The University of Oklahoma, which collaborated with production, in particular saw its meteorology program double from 225 enrolled to 450, and a grant from Universal Studios allowed development of a mobile radar. Universal also funded the NSSL meteorologists to go on a mobile tour in the eastern half of the country, staging safety presentations at science museums in a dozen major cities. Storm chasing increased even as a recreational activity, with tourism companies creating &quot;chase tours&quot;. Bill Paxton later narrated storm chaser Sean Casey&#x27;s 2011 documentary &quot;Tornado Alley&quot;. After the death of Paxton in February 2017, hundreds of storm chasers and users of the Spotter Network used their markers to spell out his initials across the states of Texas, Kansas, and Oklahoma in tribute to Paxton, citing that the movie was the inspiration for many of them to pursue storm chasing and meteorology.

A &quot;Twister&quot; museum in Wakita, Oklahoma, where many of the particularly destructive scenes of the movie were shot, contains various memorabilia and artifacts related to the film.

== In other media ==
=== Pinball ===

On April 3, 1996, Sega Pinball released &quot;Twister&quot;, a pinball machine themed to the film. It features modes including Canister Multiball, Chase Multiball, Multibull, and more.

===Theme park attraction===

&quot;Twister&quot; was used as the basis for the attraction &quot;Twister...Ride It Out&quot; at Universal Studios Florida, which features filmed introductions by Paxton and Hunt. The attraction opened on May 4, 1998, and closed on November 1, 2015, to make way for &quot;Race Through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;. In the windows of the New York facade lies a tribute to &quot;Twister...Ride it Out&quot; with references to the film and Paxton.

=== Book tie-in ===
The film&#x27;s original screenplay, written by Crichton and then-wife Anne Marie Martin, was released as a mass-market paperback in conjunction with the film.

== Sequel ==

In June 2020, a remake was announced to be in development from the original film&#x27;s international distributor, Universal Pictures, with Joseph Kosinski in early negotiations to serve as director. Frank Marshall and Sara Scott were set to serve as producers on the project. Around the same time, Hunt had pitched a direct-sequel to the original film, with a script she co-authored with Daveed Diggs and Rafael Casal. She had intended to serve as director in addition to reprising her starring role in the cast, but the studio ultimately passed on their script. She said in an interview, &quot;I tried to get it made, with Daveed [Diggs] and Rafael [Casal] and me writing it, and all Black and brown storm chasers, and they wouldn&#x27;t do it. I was going to direct it... We could barely get a meeting, and this is in June of 2020 when it was all about diversity. It would have been so cool&quot;.

After Steven Spielberg read the script by Mark L. Smith, his enthusiasm contributed to getting the project green-lit. In October 2022, it was announced that the project was officially titled &quot;Twisters&quot;, and Lee Isaac Chung was hired to direct. The project is a joint-venture production between Universal, Warner Bros., and Amblin, with Universal handling US and Canadian distribution and Warner handling worldwide distribution. The film was released July 10, 2024.

<doc id="303935" wikidata="Q528648" url="?curid=303935" title="La Pléiade">
<text>La Pléiade () was a group of 16th-century French Renaissance poets whose principal members were Pierre de Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay and Jean-Antoine de Baïf. The name was a reference to another literary group, the original Alexandrian Pleiad of seven Alexandrian poets and tragedians (3rd century B.C.), corresponding to the seven stars of the Pleiades star cluster. 

==Major figures==
Notable members of &quot;La Pléiade&quot; consisted of the following people:
* Pierre de Ronsard
* Joachim du Bellay
* Jean-Antoine de Baïf

The core group of the French Renaissance &quot;Pléiade&quot;—Pierre de Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay and Jean-Antoine de Baïf—were young French poets who met at the Collège de Coqueret, where they studied under the famous Hellenist and Latinist scholar Jean Dorat; they were generally called the &quot;Brigade&quot; at the time. Ronsard was regarded as the leader of the &quot;Brigade&quot;, and remained the most popular and well-known poet of the group. The Pléiade&#x27;s &quot;manifesto&quot; was penned by Joachim du premiere Bellay (&quot;&quot; 1549). In it, Du Bellay detailed a literary program of renewal and revolution. The group aimed to break with earlier traditions of French poetry (especially Marot and the &quot;grands rhétoriqueurs&quot;), and, maintaining that French (like the Tuscan of Petrarch and Dante) was a worthy language for literary expression, to attempt to ennoble the French language by imitating the Ancients.

To this end du Bellay recommended vernacular innovation of Greek and Roman poetic forms, emulation of specific models, and the creation of neologisms based on Greek and Latin. Among the models favoured by the Pléiade were Pindar, Anacreon, Alcaeus and other poets of the Greek Anthology, as well as Virgil, Horace and Ovid. The ideal was not one of slavish imitation, but of a poet so well-versed in the entire corpus of Ancient literature (du Bellay uses the metaphor of &quot;digestion&quot;) that he would be able to convert it into an entirely new and rich poetic language in the vernacular. For some of the members of the Pléiade, the act of the poetry itself was seen as a form of divine inspiration (see Pontus de Tyard for example), a possession by the muses akin to romantic passion, prophetic fervour or alcoholic delirium.

The forms that dominate the poetic production of these poets are the Petrarchan sonnet cycle (developed around an amorous encounter or an idealised woman) and the Horatian/Anacreontic ode (of the &quot;wine, women and song&quot; variety, often making use of the Horatian &quot;carpe diem&quot; topos - life is short, seize the day). Ronsard also tried early on to adapt the Pindaric ode into French and, later, to write a nationalist verse epic modelled on Homer and Virgil (entitled the &quot;Franciade&quot;), which he never completed. Throughout the period, the use of mythology is frequent, but so too is a depiction of the natural world (woods, rivers).

==Minor figures==
Minor figures also associated with this term include the following:
* Pontus de Tyard
* Étienne Jodelle
* Rémy Belleau
* Jacques Pelletier du Mans
* Jean de la Péruse
* Guillaume des Autels

==Use of the term==
The use of the term &quot;Pléiade&quot; to refer to the group the French poets around Ronsard and Du Bellay is much criticised. In his poems, Ronsard frequently made lists of those he considered the best poets of his generation, but these lists changed several times. These lists always included Ronsard, du Bellay, de Baïf, Pontus de Tyard and Étienne Jodelle; the last two positions were taken by Rémy Belleau, Jacques Pelletier du Mans, Jean de la Péruse, or Guillaume des Autels. In a poem in 1556 Ronsard announced that the &quot;Brigade&quot; had become the &quot;Pléiade&quot;, but apparently no one in Ronsard&#x27;s literary circle used the expression to refer to himself, and use of the term stems principally from Huguenot poets critical of Ronsard&#x27;s pretensions (Ronsard was a polemicist for the royal Catholic policy). This use was finally consecrated by Ronsard&#x27;s biographer Claude Binet, shortly after the poet&#x27;s death. Some modern literary historians reject the use of the term, as it gives precedence to Ronsard&#x27;s poetic ideas and minimises the diversity of poetic production in the French Renaissance.

==Notes==
* &quot;La Pléiade&quot;, or more correctly &quot;La Bibliothèque de la Pléiade&quot;, is also the name of a prestigious leather-bound Bible-paper collection of works in French (literature, history, etc.) published by the Éditions Gallimard publishing house.

<text>The Alcântara Space Center (, CEA), former known as &quot;Alcântara Launch Center&quot; (,) is a space center and launching facility of the Brazilian Space Agency in the city of Alcântara, located on Brazil&#x27;s northern Atlantic coast, in the state of Maranhão. It is operated by the Brazilian Air Force (). The CEA is the closest launching base to the equator. This gives the launch site a significant advantage in launching geosynchronous satellites, an attribute shared by the Guiana Space Centre.

Construction of the base began in 1982. The first launch occurred on February 21, 1990, when the sounding rocket Sonda 2 XV-53 was launched. On August 22, 2003, the explosion of the third VLS-1 (XV-03) killed 21 people.

The facility is in a strong position for launching satellites into geosynchronous orbits, according to British astrophysicist, Jonathan McDowell. As such, there are plans to launch several international rockets from Alcântara. In 2003 contracts were signed to launch Ukrainian Tsyklon-4 and Israeli Shavit rockets, thought these may have later been launched from their home countries in Ukraine and Israel. In addition there are further plans to launch the Russian Proton rocket. 

In the beginning of 2018, Brazilian government offered the possibility to use the spaceport to several U.S. companies. The company Virgin Orbit, was selected to fly their LauncherOne rocket from Alcântara in the first half of 2023.

== Construction ==
Construction of the Alcântara Space Center began in 1982, as the Brazilian Space Agency&#x27;s existing rocket range at Barreira do Inferno Launch Center was being overtaxed by growing demand for launch capacity. In 2020, the government of Brazil announced their plan to expand the base by more than 12,000 hectares.

=== Controversies ===
The construction of the space center was controversial, as the site for the center was located on several quilombos, settlements inhabited largely by descendants of escaped slaves in Brazil. In 1980, Brazil&#x27;s military government forcibly relocated more than 300 families to inland villages away from the coast to make way for the center. This heavily disrupted their traditional livelihood of fishing and led to multiple cases of malnutrition among the residents. 

Human rights concerns over the displacement of locals were reported on during the center&#x27;s planned expansions in 2001 and 2021, with residents and activists lobbying the government to halt expansions to prevent more communities from being displaced. In 2023, the Brazilian government issued a public apology to the quilombolas and offered reparations.

==Public-private partnership==
Companies based in Alcântara as of 2021, with the objective of orbital and sub-orbital launches, for commercial purposes or in partnership with the Brazilian government:

*C6 Launch
* Hyperion Rocket Systems
* OrionAST
* Innospace
As of August 2021, the Brazilian government established Ordinance No. 698, a regulation that follows the FAA 14 CFR part 450 standard, which deals with launch and re-entry licenses in order to follow the world standard in space activities.

===Agreement between Brazil and the U.S.===
In 2019, Brazil and the U.S. signed an agreement, with the objective of preventing unauthorized access or transfer of U.S. technologies related to the launches from Alcântara.

==Structures==
* Engine preparation facilities (&quot;Preparação de Propulsores - PPP&quot;)
* Payload preparation facilities (&quot;Preparação de Carga Útil - PPCU&quot;)
* Liquid-fuel loading facilities (&quot;Preparação de Carregamento de Propelentes - PCPL&quot;)
* Universal launch tower
* Mobile Integration Tower (&quot;TMI - Torre Móvel de Integração&quot;): 33x10x13m, 380tons. Used for assembly of the VLS rockets.
* Control center (&quot;Prédio de Controle Avançado - CASAMATA&quot;).
* 2600m runway

==List of launchpads==
The Alcântara launch pads include:
* VLS Pad (with Mobile Integration Tower - TMI) 
* MRL Pad (general sounding rocket pad) 
* &quot;Universal&quot; pad for rockets up to 10 tons 
* A newly built pad to support Innospace&#x27;s launches

<doc id="303944" wikidata="Q434905" url="?curid=303944" title="Edward Everett">
<text>Edward Everett (April 11, 1794 – January 15, 1865) was an American politician, Unitarian pastor, educator, diplomat, and orator from Massachusetts. Everett, as a Whig, served as U.S. representative, U.S. senator, the 15th governor of Massachusetts, minister to Great Britain, and United States secretary of state. He also taught at Harvard University and served as its president.

Everett was one of the great American orators of the and Civil War eras. He was the featured orator at the dedication ceremony of the Gettysburg National Cemetery in 1863, where he spoke for over two hoursimmediately before President Abraham Lincoln delivered his famous two-minute Gettysburg Address.

The son of a pastor, Everett was educated at Harvard, and briefly ministered at Boston&#x27;s Brattle Street Church before taking a teaching job at Harvard. The position included preparatory studies in Europe, so Everett spent two years in studies at the University of Göttingen, and another two years traveling around Europe. At Harvard he taught ancient Greek literature for several years before starting an extensive and popular speaking career. He served ten years in the United States Congress before winning election as Governor of Massachusetts in 1835. As Governor he introduced the state Board of Education, the first of its type in the nation. In 1831, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

After being narrowly defeated in the 1839 election, Everett was appointed Minister to Great Britain, serving until 1845. He next became President of Harvard, a job he quickly came to dislike. In 1849, he became an assistant to longtime friend and colleague Daniel Webster, who had been appointed Secretary of State. Upon Webster&#x27;s death Everett served as Secretary of State for a few months until he was sworn in as U.S. Senator from Massachusetts. In the later years of his life, Everett traveled and gave speeches all over the country. He supported efforts to maintain the Union before the Civil War, running for Vice President on the Constitutional Union Party ticket in 1860. He was active in supporting the Union effort during the war and supported Lincoln in the 1864 election.

==Early life and education==

Edward Everett was born on April 11, 1794, in Dorchester, Massachusetts (then independent from Boston), the fourth of eight children, to the Reverend Oliver Everett and Lucy Hill Everett, the daughter of Alexander Sears Hill. His father, a native of Dedham, Massachusetts, was a descendant of early colonist Richard Everett, and his mother&#x27;s family also had deep colonial roots. His father had served as pastor of New South Church, retiring due to poor health two years before Everett was born. He died in 1802, when Edward was eight, after which his mother moved the family to Boston. He attended local schools, and then a private school of Ezekiel Webster. During this time Ezekiel&#x27;s brother Daniel sometimes taught classes; Everett and Daniel Webster would later form a close friendship. His sister was Sarah Preston Hale.

Everett attended Boston Latin School in 1805, and then briefly Phillips Exeter Academy, where his older brother Alexander Hill Everett was teaching. At the age of 13, he was admitted to Harvard College. In 1811, at age 17, he graduated as the valedictorian of his class. Unlike some of the other students at the time, Everett was an earnest and diligent student who absorbed all of what was taught. While a student, he was a member of the Porcellian Club, and of the Hasty Pudding Club.

==Pastor and student==
Uncertain what to do next, Everett was encouraged by his pastor, Joseph Stevens Buckminster of the Brattle Street Church, to study for the ministry. This Everett did under the tutelage of Harvard President John Thornton Kirkland, earning his MA in 1813. During this time in particular he developed a facility for working with both the written and spoken word. The Reverend Buckminster died in 1812, and Everett was immediately offered the post at the Brattle Street Church on a probationary basis after his graduation, which was made permanent in November 1813. Everett dedicated himself to the work, and became a highly popular Unitarian preacher. Listeners wrote of his &quot;florid and affluent fancy&quot;, and his &quot;daring imagery&quot;, while one critic wrote what would become a common criticism of his speaking style: &quot;[Everett] spoke like some superior intelligence, discoursing to mortals of what they ought to feel and know, but as if [he] himself were too far exalted to require such feelings, and such knowledge himself.&quot; Everett, over the year he served in the pulpit, came to be disenchanted with the somewhat formulaic demands of the required oratory, and with the sometimes parochial constraints the congregation placed on him.
The workload also took its toll on young Everett, who around this time acquired the nickname &quot;Ever-at-it&quot;, which would be used throughout his life. For a change of pace, Everett traveled to Washington, D.C., where he visited with Daniel Webster and other Federalist Party luminaries from Massachusetts. In late 1814 Everett was offered a newly endowed position as professor of Greek literature at Harvard. The position came with authorization to travel for two years in Europe, and Everett readily accepted. He was formally invested as a professor in April 1815. Everett was also elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815.

Everett made his way across western Europe, visiting London and the major Dutch cities en route to the German city of Göttingen. There he entered the university, where he studied French, German, and Italian, along with Roman law, archaeology, and Greek art. He was a disciplined student, but he and George Ticknor, with whom he had traveled, were also quite sociable. Everett noted that they were viewed by many at the university as curiosities, and were often the focus of attention. He was granted a Ph. D in September 1817, which he believed to be the first such degree awarded to an American.

During his sojourn at Göttingen, Everett traveled to see other German cities, including Hanover, Weimar, Dresden, and Berlin. He received permission from Harvard to extend his time in Europe, and spent two more years traveling across the continent (from Constantinople and the Black Sea to Paris), visiting the major cities of the continent before returning to the United States in 1819. Among those he met in England were the Prussian diplomat Wilhelm von Humboldt, an influential architect of the Prussian education system, and William Wilberforce, a leading English abolitionist. While in Constantinople Everett acquired a number of ancient Greek texts which are now in the Harvard archives.

==Teacher, writer, and speaker==

Everett took up his teaching duties later in 1819, hoping to implant the scholarly methods of Germany at Harvard and bring a generally wider appreciation of German literature and culture to the United States. For his Greek class he translated Philipp Karl Buttmann&#x27;s Greek lexicon. Among his students were future Speaker of U.S. House of Representatives Robert Charles Winthrop, presidential son and future U.S. Representative Charles Francis Adams, and future philosopher and essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson had first heard Everett speak at the Brattle Street Church, and idolized him. He wrote that Everett&#x27;s voice was &quot;of such rich tones, such precise and perfect utterance, that, although slightly nasal, it was the most mellow and beautiful and correct of all instruments of the time.&quot;

In 1820 Everett was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. That year he became editor of the &quot;North American Review&quot;, a literary magazine to which he had contributed articles while studying in Europe. In addition to editing he made numerous contributions to the magazine, which flourished during his tenure and reached a nationwide audience. He was also instrumental in expanding Harvard&#x27;s collections of German language works, including grammars, lexicons, and a twenty-volume edition of the collected works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, whom Everett had visited in Weimar and whose works he championed on the pages of the &quot;Review&quot;.
Everett began his public speaking career while he taught at Harvard, which combined with his editorship of the &quot;Review&quot; to bring him some national prominence. He preached at a service held in the United States Capitol that brought him wide notice and acclaim in political circles. In 1822, he delivered a series of lectures in Boston on art and antiquities. The series was well attended, and he repeated it in subsequent years. He made a major speech in December 1823 advocating American support of the Greeks in their struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire. This subject was adopted by Daniel Webster, who also made it the subject of a speech in Congress. (Everett&#x27;s support for Greek independence made him something of a hero in Greece, and his portrait hangs in the National Gallery in Athens.) This collaboration between Webster and Everett was the start of a lifelong political association between the two men.

Everett delivered speeches commemorating the opening battles of the American Revolution in Concord, Massachusetts in 1825 and Lexington, Massachusetts in 1835.

==Marriage and children==
On May 8, 1822, Everett married Charlotte Gray Brooks (1800–1859), a daughter of Peter Chardon Brooks and Ann Gorham, who like Everett were of old New England lineage. Brooks had made a fortune in a variety of business endeavors, including marine insurance, and would financially support Everett when he embarked on his career in politics. Everett would also become associated through the Brooks family with John Quincy Adams&#x27; son Charles Francis Adams, Sr., who married Charlotte&#x27;s sister Abigail.

The Everetts had a happy and fruitful marriage, producing six children who survived infancy:
# Anne Gorham Everett (1823–1843)
# Charlotte Brooks Everett (1825–1879); married Captain Henry Augustus Wise USN
# Grace Webster Everett (1827–1836)
# Edward Brooks Everett (1830–1861); married Helen Cordis Adams
# Henry Sidney Everett (1834–1898); married Katherine Pickman Fay
# William Everett (1839–1910); U.S. Representative from Massachusetts

==Early political career==

Everett had decided as early as 1821 that he was not interested in teaching. On August 26, 1824, Everett gave an unexpectedly significant speech at Harvard&#x27;s Phi Beta Kappa Society that would alter his career trajectory. Publicity for the event was dominated by the news that the Marquis de Lafayette, the French hero of the American Revolution, would be in attendance, and the hall was packed. The subject of Everett&#x27;s speech was &quot;Circumstances of the Favorable Progress of Literature in America&quot;. He pointed out that America&#x27;s situation as an expanding nation with a common language and a democratic foundation gave its people a unique and distinctive opportunity for creating truly American literature. Unfettered by Europe&#x27;s traditions and bureaucracy, Americans could use the experiences of settling the west to develop a new style of intellectual thought.

The crowd reacted with lengthy applause, and not long afterward an informal non-partisan caucus nominated Everett as its candidate for the United States House of Representatives. Other political factions also endorsed his candidacy, and he was easily elected in the November 1824 election. He had expected to continue teaching at Harvard while serving, but was informed by its Board of Overseers that he had been dismissed because of the election victory. He took this news well, even agreeing to refund to the college the costs of his European travels. He continued to remain associated with Harvard, joining the Board of Overseers in 1827 and serving for many years.

===United States representative===
The political situation in the country was quite fluid in the late 1820s. The Federalist Party had collapsed, and the victorious Democratic-Republican Party had become diffuse, resulting in political factionalism in place of party affiliation. Everett was associated with the &quot;National Republican&quot; faction of John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay. He supported Clay&#x27;s &quot;National System&quot;—which called for protective tariffs, internal improvements, and a national bank—and the interests of Massachusetts&#x27; propertied class. Everett was re-elected to four additional terms as a National Republican, serving until 1835. The National Republicans formally became the Whig Party in 1834.

In Congress Everett sat on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and on the Committee on Libraries and Public Buildings, both of which he chaired in his last term. Since he was already well known to President Adams, he was a frequent guest at the White House, and came to champion the president&#x27;s agenda in the House. He supported tariff legislation that protected Massachusetts&#x27; growing industrial interests, favored renewal of the charter of the Second Bank of the United States, and opposed the Indian Removal Act.
Everett&#x27;s most controversial action in Congress took place relatively early during his tenure there. In 1826 Congress debated a Constitutional amendment to alter the way the president was elected, so that Congress would not be required to decide (as it had in the 1824 election). Rising in opposition to the amendment on March 9, 1826, Everett delivered a three-hour speech in which he generally opposed the need to amend the Constitution. However, he also expounded on the issue of slavery, noting that &quot;the New Testament says &#x27;Slaves obey your masters&#x27;&quot;, and accepting the document even though it contained the Three-Fifths Compromise. Of slavery itself, Everett said, &quot;domestic slavery is not, in my judgement, to be set down as an immoral and irreligious institution,&quot; and vowed he would &quot;see [North America] sunk in the bottom of the ocean, before I would see any part of this fair America converted into a continental Hayti.&quot;

Reaction to this speech was highly critical, and Everett was attacked by political friends and foes for this apparent endorsement of slavery. He attempted to justify his statements by pointing out that he rejected the slave trade and the act of kidnapping someone into slavery, but this did not mitigate the damage, and he was heavily criticized for it in the Massachusetts press. Everett would be dogged by the speech for the rest of his political career.

===Governor of Massachusetts===
Everett retired from Congress in 1835, after deciding that he did not really like the rough-and-tumble nature of the proceedings in the House. He had been offered the nomination for governor of Massachusetts by the Anti-Masonic Party in 1834; although he was known to be against secret societies like the Freemasons, he refused, and supported Whig John Davis for governor that year. Davis won the election, which was held in November 1834. In February 1835, the state legislature elected Davis to the United States Senate. In an arrangement brokered in part by Daniel Webster, Everett was promised the Whig nomination for governor (a move that upset Lieutenant Governor Samuel Turell Armstrong, who also sought the nomination). Everett easily defeated the perennial Democratic Party candidate, Marcus Morton, in November 1835. He was re-elected by comfortable margins in the three following years, all facing Morton.

In 1836 he was elected a member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts.

One of the most notable achievements of Everett&#x27;s tenure was the introduction of a state board of education to improve school quality and the establishment of &quot;normal schools&quot; for the training of teachers. Based on details of the Prussian education system which Everett had learned about, this groundbreaking accomplishment would be emulated by other states. The state Board of Education was established in 1837, with reformer Horace Mann as its secretary. The state&#x27;s first normal school opened in Lexington the next year (it afterward moved to Framingham and is now known as Framingham State University).
Other accomplishments during Everett&#x27;s tenure include the authorization of an extension of the railroad system from Worcester to the New York state line, and assistance in the quieting of border tensions between Maine and the neighboring British (now Canadian) province of New Brunswick. Massachusetts was involved in this dispute because, as part of Maine&#x27;s separation from the state in 1820, it retained ownership of public lands in the disputed area. The border issue had been simmering for some years, but tensions rose substantially in the late 1830s as both sides pushed development activity into the disputed area, and the United States refused to accept a mediation proposal made by the Dutch king. In 1838 Everett proposed to President Martin Van Buren that a special commission be established to address the issue.

Abolitionism and temperance were two issues that became more politically prominent during Everett&#x27;s tenure, and both of those matters, as well as Whig indifference, would play a role in his defeat in the 1839 election. The abolitionist Liberty Party began to take shape in 1838, and the ill-timed passage of a temperance law banning the sale of less than of alcohol would drive popular support away from the Whigs in 1839. The election, held November 11, 1839, was so close that the results were scrutinized by the (Whig-dominated) legislature when it met in January 1840. A joint legislative committee reported that Morton received exactly one-half the votes cast, sufficient to secure his victory. (One vote less for Morton would have resulted in the Whig legislature deciding the election.) Everett refused to contest the results despite calls from the party to do so; he wrote, &quot;I am willing to let the election go.&quot;

==Diplomatic service==

After leaving office, Everett traveled in Europe with his family for several months. When the Whigs, led by William Henry Harrison, won the 1840 presidential election, Everett was appointed Ambassador to Great Britain at the recommendation of his friend Daniel Webster, who had been appointed Secretary of State. Everett was at first charged with handling the northeast border issues he first encountered as governor. A new British administration, friendlier to the United States than the previous one, sent Lord Ashburton to Washington to negotiate directly with Webster, and Everett&#x27;s role was reduced to acquiring documents from British records, and pressing the American case to the Foreign Office. In this role Everett was instrumental in acquiring and distributing a map that vindicated the United States from accusations that it had cheated Britain out of land in the 1842 Webster–Ashburton Treaty.

Another major issue between the countries was the seizure of American ships by British naval forces interdicting the slave trade off the coast of Africa. Owners of ships accused but acquitted of complicity in the trade filed claims to recover their losses with the British government, and Everett, as ambassador, advanced these cases. In this he was generally successful, given the friendly British stance. One aspect of the slave trade interdiction proposed by Everett found its way into the treaty negotiated by Webster: the stationing of an American squadron off the coast of Africa to cooperate with the British effort. The issue of slaving-related seizures caused some friction at home, especially after Webster was replaced as Secretary of State by a succession of Southern politicians. Everett in particular had to school John C. Calhoun on the diplomatic ramifications of pursuing claims after slaves mutinied aboard a ship plying the American coast and sailed it to the Bahamas.

Everett rebuffed several offers for other diplomatic posts proffered by Webster, who was unhappy serving under Tyler and apparently sought the UK ambassadorship as a way to distance himself from the unpopular president; Webster eventually resigned in 1843. Everett remained at his post until 1845, when after the accession of James K. Polk to the presidency he was replaced by Democrat Louis McLane. His last months in the post were occupied with the Oregon boundary dispute, which was eventually resolved by McLane along lines negotiated by Everett.

==Harvard presidency==
Even before his departure from London, Everett was being considered as a possible successor to Josiah Quincy as President of Harvard. Everett returned to Boston in September 1845 to learn that the Overseers had offered him the post. Although he had some misgivings, principally due to some of the tedious aspects of the job and difficult matter of maintaining student discipline, he accepted the offer, and entered into his duties in February 1846.

The three years he spent there were extremely unhappy. Everett found that Harvard was short of resources, and that he was not popular with the rowdy students. One of his most notable achievements was the expansion of Harvard&#x27;s academic programs to include a &quot;school of theoretical and practical science&quot;, then known as the Lawrence Scientific School. On April 15, 1848, he delivered the eulogy for John Quincy Adams, who had died two months earlier while serving in the House of Representatives.

Everett&#x27;s unhappiness with the post was apparent early on, and by April 1847 he was negotiating with Harvard&#x27;s overseers about the conditions of the job. These talks were ultimately unfruitful, and Everett, on the advice of his doctor, resigned the post in December 1848. He had been suffering for sometime from a number of maladies, some of them prostate-related. In the following years, his health would become increasingly fragile. He was somewhat rejuvenated by a visit to the springs at Sharon Springs, New York.

==Secretary of state and U.S. senator==
When the Whigs won the 1848 national election and returned to power in 1849, Everett returned to politics. He served as an aide to Daniel Webster, who President Millard Fillmore appointed Secretary of State. When Webster died in October 1852, Fillmore appointed Everett, apparently at Webster&#x27;s request, to serve as Secretary of State during the remaining lame-duck months of his administration. In this post Everett drafted the official letter that accompanied the Perry Expedition to Japan, reversed Webster&#x27;s claim denying Peruvian sovereignty over the guano-rich Lobos Islands, and refused to engage the United States in an agreement with the United Kingdom and France to guarantee Spanish control of Cuba. Although he stated that the Fillmore administration had no interest in annexing Cuba, he made it clear that the U.S. did not want to foreclose the option by engaging in an essentially political alliance, and reinforced the notion that the U.S. saw Cuba as its concern and not a matter for outside interference.

While he was still serving as secretary of state, Everett was approached by Massachusetts Whig leaders about running for the United States Senate. He was elected by the state legislature, and took the office on March 4, 1853. In the Senate he sat on the Foreign Relations Committee, and on the Committee on Territories. He was opposed to the extension of slavery in the western territories, but was concerned that the radical Free Soil Party&#x27;s hardline stance would result in disunion. The aloofness that characterized Everett&#x27;s style in the pulpit decades before remained in evidence during these years. At President Pierce&#x27;s White House socials, wrote one observer, Everett seemed as &quot;cold-blooded and impassible, bright and lonely as the gilt weather-cock over the church in which he officiated ere he became a politician.&quot;

Everett opposed the 1854 Kansas–Nebraska Act, which allowed the territories to choose whether to allow slavery by popular vote, calling it a &quot;horrible&quot; and &quot;detested&quot; bill. However, because of his health he missed a critical vote on the bill, departing the chamber during a debate that ended up lasting all night. This angered Massachusetts anti-slavery interests, who sent him a strongly-worded petition to submit to the Senate. Because of his distaste for the more extreme elements in the abolition debate, Everett&#x27;s speech in support of the petition was weak, for which he was further criticized. The rancor of the situation greatly upset Everett, and he submitted his resignation letter on May 12, 1854, after only a little more than one year into his six-year term, once again citing poor health.

==Last years==

Free of political obligations, Everett traveled the country with his family, giving public speeches. One cause he took up was the preservation of George Washington&#x27;s home at Mount Vernon. Over several years in the mid-1850s he toured, speaking about Washington whom he compared favorably to Frederick the Great and the Duke of Marlborough. Not only did Everett donate the proceeds from this touring (about $70,000), he also refused to deduct his travel expenses. He also agreed to write a weekly column for the &quot;New York Ledger&quot; in exchange for a $10,000 gift to the Mount Vernon Ladies&#x27; Association. These columns were eventually bound and sold as the &quot;Mount Vernon Papers&quot;.

Everett was disheartened by the sectional divisions between the Northern and Southern states during the late 1850s. In 1859 he was the keynote speaker at an anti-John Brown rally that filled Faneuil Hall to capacity.

The 1860 election threatened to produce a national crisis, with pro-slavery Southerners splitting the Democratic Party and threatening secession if a Republican were to be elected president. A group of conservative ex-Whigs organized the Constitutional Union Party, which claimed as its sole principle the preservation of the Union. Supporters of Everett put his name forward as a candidate for president, but the party ended up nominating John Bell, and Everett for vice president. Everett reluctantly accepted the post, but did not campaign very much. The Bell–Everett ticket received only 39 electoral votes, all from Southern states.

In the wake of the election of Abraham Lincoln, seven, later eleven Southern states began seriously debating secession. Everett was an active participant in advancing the unsuccessful Crittenden Compromise in a last-ditch attempt to avoid war during the early months of 1861. When the American Civil War broke out in April 1861, he became an active supporter of the Union cause. He did not at first think highly of Lincoln, but came to support him as the war progressed. In 1861 and 1862 Everett toured the Northern states, lecturing on the causes of the war, and also wrote on behalf of the Union cause for the &quot;New York Ledger&quot;. Proposals were put forward that Everett serve as a roving ambassador in Europe to counter Confederate diplomatic initiatives, but these were never brought to fruition.
In November 1863, when Gettysburg National Cemetery was dedicated, Everett, by then widely renowned as the finest orator in the country, was invited to be the featured speaker. In his two-hour formal oration he compared the Battle of Gettysburg to battles of antiquity such as Marathon, and spoke about how opposing sides in previous civil wars (such as the War of the Roses and the Thirty Years&#x27; War) were able to reconcile their differences afterward. Everett&#x27;s oration was followed by the now far more famous Gettysburg Address of President Lincoln. For his part, Everett was deeply impressed by the concise speech and wrote to Lincoln noting &quot;I should be glad if I could flatter myself that I came as near to the central idea of the occasion, in two hours, as you did in two minutes.&quot; In the 1864 election, Everett supported Lincoln, serving as a presidential elector from Massachusetts for the Republicans.

==Death==

On January 9, 1865, at the age of 70, Everett spoke at a public meeting in Boston to raise funds for the southern poor in Savannah. At that meeting he caught a cold, which turned into pneumonia four days later, after he had testified for three hours in a civil dispute concerning property he owned in Winchester, Massachusetts. Everett wrote a letter to the publishers N. A. &amp; R. A. the morning of his death, in which he said: &quot;I have been very ill.&quot; He died in Boston on January 15, and was interred at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge.

==Legacy==

Edward Everett Square, near his birthplace in Dorchester, is named for him. It is the intersection of Columbia Road, Massachusetts Avenue, East Cottage Street and Boston Street. A marker is placed near where his birthplace stood, and a statue of Everett stands near the square in Richardson Park. Everett&#x27;s name appears on the facade of the Boston Public Library&#x27;s McKim Building, which he helped found, serving for twelve years as president of its board. His name was also given to his nephew, Edward Everett Hale, as well as Hale&#x27;s grandson, the actor Edward Everett Horton.

Everett, Massachusetts, separated from Malden in 1870, was named in his honor, as was the borough of Everett, Pennsylvania, and Mount Everett in western Massachusetts. Elementary schools in Dorchester and in Lincoln, Nebraska are named for him, as was a school in St. Cloud, Minnesota that was torn down in 1887. Everett donated 130 books to St. Cloud, beginning the community&#x27;s first library.
The Edward Everett House, located at 16 Harvard Street in Charlestown, was designated as a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 1996.

==In popular culture==
* In the 2015 documentary film &quot;The Gettysburg Address&quot;, Edward Everett is portrayed by actor Ed Asner.
* In the 1992 alternate history novel &quot;The Guns of the South&quot; by Harry Turtledove, Edward Everett runs as the running mate to George McClellan&#x27;s Independent campaign in the 1864 presidential election. The ticket comes in last in the popular votes but third in the electoral votes. They win 7.1% of the popular vote with 287,749 votes and get 10 electoral votes from the states of Delaware and New Jersey.

<text>Stephanie Marie McMahon Levesque ( ; ; born September 24, 1976) is an American businesswoman and retired professional wrestler. She is known for her various roles within WWE between 1998 and 2023.

The daughter of Vince and Linda McMahon, she is a fourth-generation wrestling promoter as a member of the McMahon family. She began working for WWE at age 13, modeling merchandise for various catalogs. McMahon began appearing regularly on-air for WWE (then WWF as the World Wrestling Federation) in 1999 as a part of a storyline with The Undertaker. After a brief on-screen relationship with Test, McMahon was engaged to Triple H – whom she married both on-screen and later in real life – which resulted in the McMahon-Helmsley faction storyline. She has held the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship once. In 2001, she was the on-screen owner of Extreme Championship Wrestling during The Invasion. The following year, she was the general manager of SmackDown, but stopped appearing regularly on television after an &quot;I Quit&quot; match with her father.

After making only sporadic appearances for several years, McMahon began appearing regularly on Raw in 2008 as their general manager before disappearing once again. She returned to regular on-air appearances in 2013, this time under the gimmick of an unctuous, judgmental, bullying owner along with on-screen chief operating officer Triple H. They became a power couple and formed the stable The Authority, making what were often shady decrees while claiming only to be concerned for &quot;what&#x27;s best for business&quot;, all the while romanticizing each other in the process with public displays of affection. McMahon wrestled her final in-ring match at WrestleMania 34 in April 2018, after which she continued to focus on executive roles within the company.

McMahon&#x27;s business career began as an account executive for the WWF offices in New York, before becoming the company&#x27;s head writer and director of creative writing. In 2006, she was promoted to senior vice president of creative writing. A year later, she became the executive vice president of creative. From 2013 to 2022, McMahon served as the company&#x27;s chief brand officer. In July 2022, McMahon was briefly named the CEO, the chairwoman, and later was named co-CEO of WWE alongside Nick Khan, following her father&#x27;s retirement due to previous accusations of sex trafficking and harassment inside WWE, including allegations of hush money. She then resigned from WWE in January 2023 following her father&#x27;s return to the company.

== Early life ==
Stephanie Marie McMahon was born in Hartford, Connecticut, on September 24, 1976, to professional wrestling promoters Vince and Linda McMahon. She has an older brother, Shane. McMahon and her family are Irish American, and she has expressed pride of her Irish heritage. During a WWE live event in Dublin in 2004, she revealed that her family originally came from County Clare. Her great-grandfather, Jess McMahon, was born to Irish parents who had emigrated from Galway to New York City during the 1870s.

Soon after McMahon&#x27;s birth, her family moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, where she attended Greenwich Country Day School through her elementary years. She started working for World Wrestling Federation (WWF) at the age of 13 as a model for merchandise catalogs. After graduating from Greenwich High School in 1994, McMahon attended Boston University. She graduated in 1998 with a Bachelor of Science in communications. She became a full-time employee at the WWF post-graduation.

== Business career ==
=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE ===
==== Early positions ====
McMahon entered the World Wrestling Federation (WWF/E) as a model for the WWF&#x27;s sales and merchandise department, but started her WWF business career as an account executive for the WWF offices in New York. In her early years with the company, she did reception work, creative design, television production, and acted as a ring performer. In November 2000, McMahon became head writer of the company, replacing Chris Kreski. After spending time as the director of creative writing, a job she had by 2002, she was promoted to Senior Vice President of Creative Writing in 2006.

==== Executive Vice President ====

McMahon was promoted to executive vice president of Creative in 2007. She was responsible for overseeing the creative process (storylines) for all television and pay-per-view programming. She oversaw all aspects of talent management and branding, live event booking and marketing, and all social and digital media properties.

As executive vice-president of Creative, McMahon was able to spearhead the upbringing of the WWE app, which has been downloaded over 20 million times. She was also able to launch a huge partnership with the USO metropolitan Washington, the social media company Tout, and was able to partner with Yahoo to bring WWE content. Stephanie also led WWE&#x27;s Creative coalition for their Anti Bullying Campaigns.

==== Chief brand officer ====

On December 4, 2013, WWE announced the promotion of McMahon to chief brand officer, where she will lead efforts to further enhance WWE&#x27;s brand reputation among key constituents including advertisers, media, business partners, and investors. She will also serve as the lead ambassador of WWE and work with business units to support key growth initiatives. She will also lead WWE&#x27;s targeted youth and moms marketing programs.

McMahon&#x27;s new position enabled her to spearhead the continued partnership with General Mills&#x27; Totino&#x27;s brand.

On February 5, 2014, McMahon along with CMO and CRO Michelle Wilson announced a partnership between WWE and KaBOOM! to build a playground for WWE&#x27;s annual WrestleMania week in Louisiana. McMahon earned a combined salary of over $775,000 between her corporate role and as an on-screen talent in 2013. She also owns over $77 million in WWE stock.

On April 15, 2014, during WWE&#x27;s annual Business Partners Summit, McMahon confirmed that a new WWE logo would debut the night after WWE SummerSlam, although it was already showing up on WWE products like the WWE Network and &quot;NXT&quot;.

On August 5, at the Needham fireside conference, McMahon alongside her husband Triple H, and WWE Chief strategy and financial officer George Barrios, discussed the Creative side of WWE, the WWE Network, and the difference between WWE and UFC.

On May 19, 2022, McMahon tweeted that she would be taking a leave of absence from the majority of her responsibilities at WWE. She stated that she looked forward to returning to the company in the near future and was taking time off to focus on family.

==== Interim Chairwoman and CEO ====

On June 17, 2022, amidst an investigation by WWE&#x27;s board of directors into reported &quot;hush money&quot; paid to a former employee by Vince McMahon following an affair, McMahon stepped down as chairman and CEO of WWE and was replaced by his daughter, Stephanie McMahon Levesque, as the interim chairwoman and CEO of WWE.

==== Chairwoman and Co-CEO ====
On July 22, 2022, Vince McMahon announced his retirement from WWE and named McMahon Levesque the company&#x27;s new chairwoman and Co-CEO (alongside Nick Khan). Triple H then replaced Vince McMahon as Head of WWE creative. On January 10, 2023, McMahon Levesque resigned as Co-CEO of WWE and from the company, following her father Vince McMahon&#x27;s return to the company as executive chairman.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE ===
==== McMahon-Helmsley Era (1999–2001) ====
In early 1999, at the suggestion of WWF writer Vince Russo McMahon debuted as the innocent and friendly daughter of Vince McMahon during an on-screen storyline involving Vince and The Undertaker. The Undertaker stalked and abducted McMahon at the end of the April pay-per-view, which culminated in him almost marrying her in the middle of the ring the next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, before being rescued by Stone Cold Steve Austin.

McMahon then began an on-screen relationship with wrestler Test, which led to a rivalry between him and her older brother Shane. After Test defeated Shane at SummerSlam in a &quot;Love Her Or Leave Her Match&quot;, McMahon and Test went on to team together in a match on September 20, 1999, with the couple defeating Jeff Jarrett and Debra. The couple were eventually engaged, but during the in-ring ceremony, Triple H showed a video which revealed that he had drugged McMahon and taken her to Las Vegas, Nevada, where they were married in a drive-through ceremony. McMahon seemed to abhor Triple H at first, but at the inaugural Armageddon event, after Triple H defeated her father in a No Holds Barred Match, left with him after embracing. McMahon confronted Vince the next night on &quot;Raw&quot; and revealed the wedding was a planned event, which was a revenge plot against her father for the aforementioned kidnappings, thus turning her heel for the first time in her career.

In late 1999, with Vince McMahon absent as a result of injuries inflicted upon him by Triple H at the Armageddon pay-per-view, Triple H and McMahon became the on-screen owners of the WWF, a period known as the &quot;McMahon-Helmsley Era&quot; (slightly different from the modern era of &quot;The Authority&quot;) and dominated by the McMahon-Helmsley Faction. Triple H held the WWF Championship and McMahon held the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship after defeating champion Jacqueline with the help of Tori and D-Generation X on the March 28 episode of SmackDown! McMahon successfully defended her title against Lita on &quot;SmackDown&quot; on June 6 and 16. McMahon reconciled with her father and brother at WrestleMania 2000 when they helped Triple H defend his title against The Rock, leaving Linda McMahon as the only fan-favorite in the McMahon family.
In mid-2000, a love triangle storyline began featuring McMahon, Triple H and Kurt Angle. The storyline continued at Unforgiven when Triple H defeated Angle with a &quot;Pedigree&quot; following a low blow from McMahon, proving her loyalty to him. McMahon later became Angle&#x27;s manager and was in his corner when he defeated The Rock for the WWF Championship at No Mercy. The alliance was short-lived, however, as after The Rock performed his &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; maneuver on McMahon at No Mercy, Triple H attacked Angle, considering it his fault that McMahon was hurt due to her managing Angle at the time. On the August 21, 2000, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon lost the WWF&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Championship to Lita despite the interferences from Angle and Triple H after special referee, The Rock, performed a spinebuster on McMahon.

The internal disputes between the McMahons led to Linda McMahon being in a comatose and wheel-chair bound state due to the stress of being asked for a divorce by Vince, who took the opportunity to have a public affair with Trish Stratus. McMahon briefly feuded with Stratus, defeating her at No Way Out. Over the next few weeks, Vince made it clear that he favored McMahon over Stratus, allowing McMahon to bully and verbally abuse Stratus. At WrestleMania X-Seven, Shane McMahon defeated Vince in a street fight. During the match, Stratus slapped Vince and chased Stephanie from ringside, apparently upset with Vince&#x27;s constant misogynistic treatment of her.

==== The Invasion and divorce from Triple H (2001–2002) ====
McMahon later revealed that she had purchased Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and intended to bankrupt the WWF (in reality, the ownership of ECW assets at this time was highly disputed), along with her brother Shane, who had become the on-screen owner of World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and the two rosters merged to form a &quot;supergroup&quot; known as The Alliance.

Her team The Alliance consisting of her brother Shane, former WCW Champion Booker T, Rob Van Dam, Kurt Angle and Stone Cold Steve Austin were defeated by Team WWF consisting of The Undertaker, Kane, Big Show, Chris Jericho and The Rock at Survivor Series in a five-on-five, Winner Takes All elimination match. The night after The Alliance was defeated, Shane and Stephanie were banished from WWF television. McMahon returned in January 2002 when Triple H made a comeback as a fan-favorite, but the good couple began having problems, as McMahon began acting like a nagging and clingy wife.

As part of the storyline, the couple &quot;divorced&quot; after McMahon claimed to be pregnant to trick Triple H into renewing their marital vows. Triple H later discovered that she was lying though and left her at the altar during the renewal ceremony. As a result, after Triple H won the Royal Rumble, McMahon appointed herself as the special guest referee in a match between Kurt Angle and Triple H at No Way Out with Triple H&#x27;s WrestleMania Undisputed WWF Championship shot on the line. Though Angle won thanks to McMahon&#x27;s biased officiating, Triple H defeated him the next night to regain his title shot. McMahon then aligned herself with former enemy, Chris Jericho. Despite interference by McMahon, Jericho lost to Triple H at WrestleMania X8 on March 17. On the March 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jericho and McMahon lost to Triple H in a Triple Threat match for the Undisputed Championship, with the stipulation that, if McMahon was pinned, she would be forced to leave the WWF. In the match, McMahon came within a one count of becoming the first female WWE Champion in a pin on Jericho, but was ultimately pinned by Triple H.

==== SmackDown! general manager (2002–2003) ====
On July 18, 2002, McMahon returned to the WWE (formerly WWF until a lawsuit from the World Wildlife Fund) as the general manager of SmackDown!. In contrast to her McMahon-Helmsley era villain character, McMahon became a fan favorite, as she began to favor fan favorite wrestlers at that time. She feuded with Raw general manager Eric Bischoff. On the October 31 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; at a Halloween party, McMahon and Bischoff shared a kiss while McMahon was dressed as a witch and Bischoff was disguised as her father underneath a mask. McMahon was given credit for the return of the WWE United States Championship and for the creation of the WWE Tag Team Championship. She was also credited with signing Hulk Hogan back to &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, which caused friction between herself and her father.

In the summer of 2003, Vince McMahon began to resent Stephanie&#x27;s attempts to stop him from pursuing an affair with Sable. In a controversial segment of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, John Cena requested that Stephanie rip Sable&#x27;s top off and that he be allowed to slap Stephanie&#x27;s buttocks; she agreed to it and he slapped her buttocks, after which she went backstage, fought Sable, and ripped Sable&#x27;s top off briefly exposing Sable&#x27;s breasts on air. The feud culminated in the controversial first ever father-daughter &quot;I Quit&quot; match at No Mercy. McMahon was accompanied by her mother, the CEO of WWE Linda McMahon, and Sable accompanied Vince in their match. McMahon lost when Linda, at ringside threw in a towel on her behalf because Vince did not release a choke he had on her with a lead pipe. As a result of losing the match, McMahon was forced to step down as SmackDown! general manager. The match was made to write Stephanie out of storylines as she was marrying Paul &quot;Triple H&quot; Levesque that week.

==== Sporadic appearances (2005–2007) ====
McMahon returned as a villainess once again on October 3, 2005, for &quot;Raw Homecoming&quot;, where she confronted Stone Cold Steve Austin and received a Stunner. On October 10, 2005, she, along with her father and, in a surprise twist, her mother fired &quot;Raw&quot; announcer Jim Ross.

A visibly pregnant McMahon also returned on the March 6, 2006, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, approaching Shawn Michaels backstage and claiming to have abdominal pains. When Michaels left to get her some water, McMahon pulled out an unmarked substance out of her brassiere and poured it into his bottle of water. This substance caused him to become groggy during his match against Shane later in the night, which he lost as a result. McMahon also appeared at the WWE Hall of Fame induction ceremony on April 1, 2006, and in a backstage vignette with her immediate family at WrestleMania 22.

McMahon returned during a backstage segment in April 2007 at WrestleMania 23, visiting her father before his &quot;Battle of the Billionaires&quot; match. After her father returned to &quot;Raw&quot; after faking his own death, McMahon publicly revealed that her father had an illegitimate child, who was among the WWE roster. On the taped edition of &quot;Raw&quot; that aired September 3, 2007, McMahon, along with her mother Linda and her brother Shane, made several appearances to confront Mr. McMahon about the child, who was later revealed to be Hornswoggle, turning into a fan favorite. On &quot;Raw&#x27;s 15 Year Anniversary&quot; episode, she appeared along with Shane in a segment—also involving her husband Triple H and Hornswoggle—which ended with her kissing her real life husband Triple H, to humiliate her father on &quot;Raw&quot;.

==== Raw general manager (2008–2009) ====

After the severe injuries sustained by Vince on the June 23, three-hour edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Shane appeared requesting for the Raw Superstars to stand together during what was a &#x27;turbulent time&#x27;. Shane&#x27;s plea was ignored, and subsequently, for the next two weeks, McMahon and Shane urged the superstars to show solidarity. The following week, Shane announced Mike Adamle as their choice to be the new Raw general manager.

After Adamle stepped down as general manager, McMahon soon became in charge of the brand and (reignited her feud) by having altercations with Chris Jericho in the following weeks, which involved her firing him (although he was later reinstated). After her father Vince returned, the family began a feud with Randy Orton, who began the storyline by punting Vince in the head. After a few weeks of feuding, Orton and his alliance, The Legacy, punted Shane in the head and performed an RKO on McMahon. Following the attack, he was chased out of the ring by Triple H, her real-life husband. The rivalry among Orton, the Legacy and the McMahons heated up when Orton attacked and kissed Stephanie. Triple H and the Legacy&#x27;s rivalry continued at WrestleMania 25, where Triple H defended the WWE Championship against Orton. The following month, Orton won the championship at Backlash. After Backlash, McMahon left Raw and took a hiatus from WWE television.

==== Sporadic appearances (2010–2013) ====
McMahon appeared on the November 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in a pre-taped segment, where she dreamt that Vince awoke from a coma after his doctor, played by actor and one-time WWE employee Freddie Prinze Jr., informed him that his wife Linda had invested millions in her campaign as she runs for senate. Vince&#x27;s heart rate elevated more and more as Prinze informed him on what was &quot;wrong&quot; with WWE since he went into a coma. After beginning to feel better, Vince realizes that he has a serious case of &quot;the runs&quot;, in which he gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom, in which he is covered in campaign signs, that block his backside. McMahon suddenly wakes up from her dream and asks her husband, Triple H (off-screen and voice work only), if Vince was still in a coma, in which Triple H replies &quot;Yeah, he&#x27;s in a coma. I&#x27;m pretty sure he&#x27;s brain dead.&quot;; McMahon responds by saying &quot;Thank God,&quot; and then lays back down.

McMahon made an appearance as a guest speaker at the WrestleMania XXVII Press Conference. Several months later, she appeared in a backstage segment at SummerSlam to wish CM Punk luck in his match. Upon offering to shake his hand, Punk declined and insulted her: &quot;I would, but... I know where that hand&#x27;s been.&quot; The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon appeared backstage with CM Punk and threatened him: &quot;...in the end, people always get what they deserve.&quot;

On July 23, 2012, McMahon made an appearance on the 1000th episode of &quot;Raw&quot; where she confronted and then slapped Paul Heyman to convince him to accept a match between Brock Lesnar and Triple H at SummerSlam. On April 6, 2013, McMahon inducted former on-screen rival Trish Stratus into the WWE Hall of Fame.

On June 3, 2013, McMahon made an appearance to reveal her decision not to allow Triple H to compete that night. On the June 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon confronted new Divas Champion AJ Lee. On the July 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon fired Vickie Guerrero from the position of Raw Managing Supervisor when the WWE Universe voted &quot;Failed&quot; during Guerrero&#x27;s job evaluation.

==== The Authority (2013–2015) ====
On the August 19 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon turned heel when she interrupted Daniel Bryan and supported the actions of her husband at SummerSlam the previous night, telling Bryan that he wasn&#x27;t suitable to be the face of the company. Later in the night McMahon stood beside Triple H and her father as they celebrated Randy Orton&#x27;s WWE Championship Coronation, during which Daniel Bryan was attacked by The Shield and subsequently by Orton. In November 2013, McMahon signed a three-year performer&#x27;s contract with the WWE, confirming her as a regular on its programming. She and Triple H continued to rule the company as a controlling &quot;power couple&quot; dubbed The Authority. Swearing that their actions were &quot;best for business&quot;, the pair belittled and punished any talent that went against their ideology, and formed a particular vendetta against Daniel Bryan. McMahon was at ringside when Triple H lost to Bryan at WrestleMania XXX.

In June 2014, as part of the ongoing storyline with Bryan, McMahon threatened to fire his wife Brie Bella if Bryan did not relinquish the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, which forced Brie to quit before slapping McMahon in the face. On the June 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Roman Reigns spiked the coffee Vickie Guerrero gave to McMahon, causing Stephanie to throw up on Vickie and leave with Triple H to the hospital. Vickie later gave Reigns a chance in the battle royal, which he would win. On the June 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Vickie lost in a pudding match against McMahon with her job on the line, after interference by Alicia Fox, Layla and Rosa Mendes. Vickie ultimately lost the match and was fired; however, she got her retribution over McMahon by throwing her into the mud pool. After Brie quit, McMahon put Brie&#x27;s sister Nikki in several handicap matches as punishment. Brie returned to television on the July 21 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, appearing in the crowd leading to a confrontation between the two. McMahon was (kayfabe) arrested and charged with assault and battery, because she slapped Brie, who was not a (kayfabe) WWE employee. The following week, McMahon granted Brie her job back and a match at SummerSlam against her to get Brie to drop the lawsuit. On the August 4 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, after their contract signing, McMahon pedigreed both twins. At SummerSlam, Nikki turned on Brie, allowing Stephanie to hit a pedigree on Brie having Stephanie win her first pay per view match in over 10 years.

On the October 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, after John Cena, the No. 1 contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, rejected an offer to join the Authority, Triple H announced a Traditional Survivor Series tag team elimination match, with a team representing the Authority facing a team captained by Cena. On the November 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Vince McMahon announced that if Team Authority loses at Survivor Series, the Authority will be ousted from power. During the match, Triple H tried to get the last member of Team Cena, Dolph Ziggler, eliminated by attacking two referees and placing Seth Rollins (who was also the final member of Team Authority) on top of Ziggler and calling crooked referee Scott Armstrong into the ring to make the count; however, the debuting Sting came out and attacked Armstrong and Triple H, giving Team Cena the win and thus disbanding The Authority. Stephanie and Triple H appeared on the episode of &quot;Raw&quot; after Survivor Series stating that without them the company would be driven to the ground. They were then escorted out of the arena by the returning Daniel Bryan and only to be insulted by Mr.McMahon for letting him down and the McMahon family before exiting the arena. On the December 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Authority was brought back in power by John Cena, and she and her husband entered and stepped on the entrance ramp celebrating their return with a glass of champagne and a kiss. Stephanie and Triple H then proceeded to fire Erick Rowan, Ryback and Dolph Ziggler.

On the July 13, 2015, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Stephanie interrupted Team Bella (The Bella Twins and Alicia Fox) to introduce Becky Lynch, Charlotte, and then-NXT Women&#x27;s Champion Sasha Banks, calling for a &quot;revolution&quot; in the WWE Divas division. While Lynch and Charlotte allied with Paige, Banks would ally with Tamina and Naomi, leading to a brawl between the three teams.

On the February 22, 2016, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Mr. McMahon presented the &quot;Vincent J. McMahon Legacy of Excellence&quot; award to Stephanie. Before she could start her acceptance speech, Shane McMahon returned for the first time since 2009 and demanded to gain control of &quot;Raw&quot;, claiming The Authority was running the company to the ground. Mr. McMahon accepted the offer, only if he won one more match. Shane accepted, and Mr. McMahon announced he would wrestle at WrestleMania 32 against The Undertaker inside Hell in a Cell. On the post-WrestleMania episode of &quot;Raw&quot; on April 4, Mr. McMahon opened the show to announce that his returning son, Shane, would run &quot;Raw&quot; for one night only. However, Shane continued to run &quot;Raw&quot; due to &quot;overwhelming fan support&quot; until the April 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, when Stephanie returned to announce that Mr. McMahon would decide who&#x27;d permanently control &quot;Raw&quot; at Payback. Mr. McMahon announced that both Stephanie and Shane would run &quot;Raw&quot; together on a permanent basis, thus disbanding The Authority.

==== Raw Commissioner (2016–2018) ====
On the July 11 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Mr. McMahon announced Stephanie as the commissioner of the Raw brand, while Shane was named commissioner of SmackDown for them to compete against each other in the upcoming reestablished brand extension. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Stephanie appointed Mick Foley as the Raw general manager. The next week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Stephanie and Mick Foley announced the WWE Universal Championship would be the main championship on &quot;Raw&quot;.

On the October 11 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Commissioner Shane McMahon and general manager Daniel Bryan challenged Raw to three traditional Survivor Series elimination matches – involving each brand&#x27;s best five male wrestlers, best five female wrestlers, and best five tag teams, respectively. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Raw Commissioner Stephanie accepted the challenge. On the November 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Stephanie invited both Shane and Bryan to appear on the following week&#x27;s &quot;Raw&quot; to address the interpromotional matches, which Shane and Bryan accepted. During this meeting, each commissioner and general manager touted the reasons why their respective brand was better and eventually called out their respective male teams. In the ensuing battle, Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins of Team Raw stood tall at the end. At Survivor Series, Team SmackDown defeated Team Raw, On the March 20 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Foley was fired as Raw general manager for his actions. In April, Stephanie was written out of the storyline after being pushed accidentally through a table at WrestleMania 33 by Triple H, and did not appear on WWE TV for many months. However, McMahon made a one-off appearance after Kevin Owens assaulted her father on the September 12 edition of &quot;SmackDown&quot;.
McMahon returned to Raw on the October 30, 2017, episode, confronting Raw general manager Kurt Angle regarding Shane and the Smackdown roster&#x27;s attack on the Raw roster at the end of the previous week&#x27;s Raw, naming him team captain for Raw at the Survivor Series pay-per-view, warning him that if Raw is not victorious over Smackdown at the pay-per-view, she was considering dismissing him from being Raw general manager. On the December 18 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, after a six-woman tag team match between the team of Sasha Banks, Bayley, and Mickie James and Absolution (Paige, Mandy Rose, and Sonya Deville) ended in disqualification and a brawl ensued with the rest of the Raw women&#x27;s roster (Alicia Fox, Asuka, Nia Jax, Dana Brooke, and Raw Women&#x27;s Champion Alexa Bliss), Raw Commissioner Stephanie came out and the brawl stopped. Stephanie recapped the leaps that women&#x27;s wrestling had taken the past few years, going from a revolution to the evolution of women&#x27;s wrestling, including the first-ever women&#x27;s Hell in a Cell match, the first-ever women&#x27;s Money in the Bank ladder match, and women main eventing &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot;. She then announced the first-ever women&#x27;s Royal Rumble Match for the 2018 Royal Rumble with the winner receiving a match at WrestleMania 34 for either the Raw Women&#x27;s Championship or SmackDown Women&#x27;s Championship.

==== Sporadic appearances (2018–present) ====

Upon the signing of Ronda Rousey, McMahon embarked on a feud with her, leading to a mixed tag-team match at WrestleMania 34 against Rousey and Kurt Angle with her husband, Triple H as her partner. This was McMahon&#x27;s first match since SummerSlam (2014) and her first-ever WrestleMania match. At the event, her team was defeated when she tapped out to Rousey&#x27;s armbar. Following this loss, Stephanie would begin making only sporadic appearances on TV.

On the July 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon returned to announce a match between Kevin Owens and Braun Strowman at the August 19 SummerSlam Pay Per View. The match was created with a stipulation that if Strowman loses the match in any way, he loses his Money in the Bank contract to Owens. On that same episode, McMahon also announced the upcoming all-women Evolution Pay Per View. On the September 24 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Stephanie returned as a face for the first time since 2013 when she told Baron Corbin about the lack of leadership he had been doing and if he doesn&#x27;t improve that she would bring back Kurt Angle from vacation.
She also returned on the &quot;1000th Episode of SmackDown&quot; on Truth TV.

On the November 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon returned to rally Team Raw at the Survivor Series and confronted Braun Strowman to make the business proposition that if Team Raw is victorious, she promised him to have a match with Baron Corbin and a Universal Championship rematch against Brock Lesnar.

On April 15, 2019, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon turned heel once again by supporting her brother&#x27;s actions against The Miz&#x27;s father and also insulting the fans by saying Kurt Angle had his last match, telling them to get over it and also insulting the Montreal crowd.
She was then seen as a more neutral character, appearing very sporadically. She announced the draft picks during the 2019 WWE Draft, and introduced the live broadcast of WrestleMania 36. On May 19, 2022, McMahon announced a leave of absence from the company, stating that she wished to spend time with her family. On June 17, 2022, Stephanie McMahon was announced as the interim chairwoman and CEO following an investigation by the board of directors into allegations of sexual misconduct towards her father, Vince McMahon. On July 22, 2022, upon her appointment as the permanent chairwoman of WWE following her father Vince&#x27;s retirement, she returned on the following episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; to thank the fans for their support on social media.

On January 10, 2023, McMahon announced her resignation from WWE upon her father&#x27;s return as chairman of the company.

At WrestleMania XL, Stephanie made an unannounced return at the start of the show on Night 2 to welcome all fans in attendance. This was her first appearance since her father&#x27;s resignation as chairman of the newly formed TKO Group Holdings, formed between the merger of the WWE and UFC in September 2023, amidst the controversial sex trafficking scandal involving a former WWE employee. She then announced the draft picks during the 2024 WWE Draft in late April 2024.

At SummerSlam in August 2024, Stephanie was in attendance at ringside among the fans watching the event. In the post-event press conference, Triple H confirmed that she is not currently in a position within the company but is not ruling out a return.

In a radio interview with &quot;Opie and Anthony&quot; in 2004, Levesque claimed he began dating McMahon after being apart from his previous girlfriend, Joanie &quot;Chyna&quot; Laurer, for some time, despite Laurer&#x27;s claims his relationship with McMahon began while they were still together. After their marriage, Stephanie took her husband&#x27;s surname and legally changed her middle name to McMahon. The couple have three daughters together: Aurora Rose (born 2006), Murphy Claire (born 2008), and Vaughn Evelyn (born 2010).

<text>Oskar Emil von Hutier (27 August 1857 – 5 December 1934) was a German general during the First World War. He served in the German Army from 1875 to 1919, including war service. 

During the First World War, he commanded the army that took Riga in 1917. The following year he was transferred to the Western Front to participate in Operation Michael that year. He is frequently but mistakenly credited with having created the stormtrooper tactics of small, rapid forces, which he employed to great effect during the Michael offensive. These tactics had been developed by other officers on the Western Front before he was reassigned there.

After retiring from the Army in 1919, Hutier presided over the German Officers&#x27; League until his death on 5 December 1934. He was among leaders who contended that the Army had been betrayed by enemies at home.

==Biography==
Oskar von Hutier was born in Erfurt on 27 August 1857, in the Prussian Province of Saxony. His family had a long tradition of military service; his grandfather served in the French Army and his father, Cölestin von Hutier, rose to the rank of colonel in the Prussian Army. Hutier was commissioned into the German Army in 1874 and attended the Prussian Military Academy beginning in 1885. There, he gained the attention of the General Staff, on which he subsequently served. He served as the &quot;Oberquartiermeister&quot; in 1911.

Hutier married Fanni Ludendorff, and had three children. Their son Oskar was seriously wounded at the Battle of Verdun in 1916.

===World War I===

Hutier spent the first year of the First World War as a divisional commander in France. There, he commanded the 1st Guards Infantry Division in the Second Army. He commanded the unit during the First Battle of the Marne, and remained on the Western Front until April 1915, when he was transferred to the Eastern Front. There, on 4 April, he took command of the XXI Corps of the Tenth Army. He briefly commanded the Army Detachment D from 2 January to 22 April in 1917. On 22 April, he was promoted to &quot;General der Infanterie&quot; (General of the Infantry) and placed in command of the Eighth Army.

On 3 September 1917, Hutier, commanding the Eighth Army, ended the two-year siege of the Russian city of Riga. He moved his troops to an unexpected sector in the Russian lines, and using a heavy bombardment prepared by Georg Bruchmüller and a surprise crossing of the Dvina River, took the city. The tactics he employed—surprise and encirclement—were essentially standard German Army doctrine; his infantry attacked in company-strength skirmish lines after crossing the River Dvina, much as they would have done in 1914. He followed this success with Operation Albion, an amphibious assault (the only successful one of the war) that seized Russian-held islands in the Baltic Sea. Hutier was awarded the Pour le Mérite by Kaiser Wilhelm II for seizing Riga. His success there also impressed General Erich Ludendorff, who transferred Hutier to the Western Front in 1918.

After arriving on the Western Front, Hutier was placed in command of the newly formed Eighteenth Army. In March 1918, during Operation Michael at the start of the German spring offensive, Hutier employed the new infiltration tactics that had been developed over the preceding three years on the Western Front. He hammered the British Fifth Army, advancing some 40 miles along the Somme River toward Amiens in the span of fifteen days. Hutier&#x27;s forces captured around 50,000 prisoners; Hutier was awarded the Oak Leaves to accompany his Pour le Mérite for this victory. A contemporary French magazine credited Hutier with creating these infiltration tactics, which relied on small, flexible forces that moved rapidly, calling them &quot;Hutier tactics&quot;, though he had had no significant role in developing them.

Later in June, Hutier directed an offensive toward Noyon, which made initial gains but broke down in the face of stiff Allied resistance. For the rest of the war, Hutier&#x27;s Eighteenth Army fought on the defensive while the Allies launched a strategic counter-offensive that culminated in Germany&#x27;s total defeat by November.

===Later life===
Following the Armistice in November 1918, Hutier marched his Army back to Germany, where he was greeted as a hero. He retired from the army in 1919. Like his overall commander and cousin, Ludendorff, Hutier long maintained that the German Army had not been defeated in the field, but was &quot;stabbed in the back&quot; by domestic enemies on the home front. Hutier served as president of the German Officers&#x27; League from 1919 to shortly before his death in Berlin on 5 December 1934, at the age of 77.

<text>The Keg is a Canadian-owned chain of steakhouse restaurants and bars operating in both Canada and the United States. The first location, originally named &quot;The Keg and Cleaver&quot; restaurant was founded in 1971 by George Tidball in North Vancouver, British Columbia. By February 2018, The Keg had expanded to 160 locations in Canada and the United States, when Canadian food industry giant Cara Operations (now known as Recipe Unlimited) purchased the chain for $200 million, from then owners David Aisenstat (49%) and Fairfax Financial (51%). The chain is also recognized as The Keg Steakhouse + Bar.

==History==
The company was founded in 1971 in North Vancouver, British Columbia as &quot;The Keg &#x27;n Cleaver&quot; by George Tidball at one small, downstairs location in a former industrial building in the Moodyville area of lower Lonsdale. Today it operates in nine provinces (excluding only Prince Edward Island) and five American states.

The Keg purchased some historic properties, refurbishing them and turning them into restaurants. Examples of this are the Keg Mansion in Toronto, and the Keg Manor at the Maplelawn Estate in Ottawa. The Downtown Winnipeg location opened in 1975 as The Keg and Cleaver in the former Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company Garage on Garry Street, where it still operates today. Other notable heritage restorations are the Keg in Kamloops, British Columbia, which was a CN Station; and in New Westminster, British Columbia, formerly the city&#x27;s CPR station. The Old Strathcona location, restored and opened in Edmonton, Alberta three years after Tidball opened the first Keg. It was originally built in 1912 as the Scona Apartments and Scona Garage, one of the earliest automobile sales and service locations in that city. This location has since closed. 
==Operations==
The Keg&#x27;s financial and physical operations have been managed by David Aisenstat for a number of years. The restaurants operated as Keg Restaurants Ltd. (KRL), with Aisenstat involved in selling to the British firm Whitbread PLC in 1987. In 1997, Aisenstat arranged financing a purchased 100% of KRL back from Whitbread.

In 2002, KRL created the Keg Royalties Income Fund, sold through a public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange, trading as . The Fund owns the trademarks and intellectual property of &quot;The Keg&quot;, and receives an annual royalty of 4% of gross sales for restaurant locations in the Royalty Pool. KRL kept a 99-year license to use the name &quot;The Keg&quot;; it also provided management services to The Keg Royalties Income Fund at no cost as part of its long-term royalty and licensing agreement. The Fund&#x27;s creation presented the first opportunity for the public to trade in any portion of The Keg group of companies, which were previously fully private.

On February 4, 2014, Aisenstat sold 51% of his private holdings in The Keg to Fairfax Financial, a publicly traded Canadian holding company.

On January 23, 2018, it was announced that Canadian food industry giant Cara Operations was purchasing KRL for $200 million. The deal closed in February 2018, with Fairfax Financial and David Aisenstat sharing $105 million plus 3.8 million Cara subordinate voting shares. Aisenstat joined Cara&#x27;s board of directors and assumed executive oversight of the higher-end brands within the 19 restaurant chains then held by Cara. Cara also announced that the acquisition had prompted the company to change its own name, confirming on May 10, 2018 that it would be renamed Recipe Unlimited Corporation.

<doc id="303951" wikidata="Q44430" url="?curid=303951" title="Vince McMahon">
<text>Vincent Kennedy McMahon (; born August 24, 1945) is an American businessman and former professional wrestling promoter. McMahon, along with his later-estranged wife Linda, is a co-founder of the modern WWE, the world&#x27;s largest professional wrestling promotion. Outside of professional wrestling McMahon has occasionally ventured into promoting other sports; his projects have included the World Bodybuilding Federation and the XFL football league. He is the owner of Alpha Entertainment.

McMahon graduated from East Carolina University with a degree in business in 1968, and began his tenure in professional wrestling as a commentator for WWE (then called the World Wide Wrestling Federation or WWWF) for most of the 1970s. He bought the company from his father, Vincent J. McMahon, in 1982 and almost monopolized the industry, which previously operated as separate entities across the United States. This led to the development of the annual event WrestleMania, which became one of the world&#x27;s most successful professional wrestling events. WWE then faced industry competition from World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in the 1990s before purchasing and absorbing WCW in 2001. WWE also purchased the assets of the defunct Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in 2003.

McMahon appeared on-screen for WWE from 1969 until 2022, initially as a personable play-by-play commentator. In 1997, he adopted the character of Mr. McMahon, portrayed as an irascible, villainous, swaggering tyrant who obsessed over maintaining control of his wrestling company and often growled the catchphrase &quot;you&#x27;re fired!&quot; when dismissing an employee. Under the villainous Mr. McMahon gimmick, he competed in wrestling matches and became a one-time WWE Champion, a one-time ECW Champion, a Royal Rumble winner, and a multi-time pay-per-view headliner.

Following claims of hush-money agreements McMahon paid over affairs with former WWE employees, McMahon stepped down as CEO and chairman of WWE in June 2022, pending the conclusion of an internal investigation. He was replaced by his daughter, Stephanie McMahon. The following month, McMahon announced his retirement from WWE, but his return to WWE as executive chairman was confirmed in January 2023. That April, Endeavor Group Holdings announced a merger between WWE and Zuffa, owner of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) mixed martial arts promotion; McMahon served as the executive chairman of the new merged company, TKO Group Holdings (TKO). McMahon was fined over $1.7 million by the Securities and Exchange Commission from undisclosed hush money payments. McMahon later resigned from TKO in January 2024 after allegations of sex trafficking and sexual assault. McMahon is currently under a federal probe.

== Early life ==
McMahon was born in Pinehurst, North Carolina, on August 24, 1945, to Victoria (née Hanner; 1920–2022) and Vincent James McMahon (1914–1984), who left the family when McMahon was still a baby and took McMahon&#x27;s older brother Roderick James McMahon III (1943–2021) with him. McMahon did not meet his father until the age of 12. McMahon&#x27;s paternal grandfather was the boxing promoter Roderick James &quot;Jess&quot; McMahon, whose parents were Irish immigrants from County Galway.

His paternal grandmother, Rose Davis, was also of Irish descent. McMahon was raised under the name Vinnie Lupton and spent the majority of his childhood living with his mother and various stepfathers. He later claimed that one of his stepfathers, Leo Lupton, beat his mother and attacked him when he tried to protect her; he said of the experience, &quot;It is unfortunate that [Lupton] died before I could kill him. I would have enjoyed that.&quot; He graduated in 1964 from Fishburne Military School in Waynesboro, Virginia, where he reportedly struggled due to dyslexia.

== Business career ==
=== Early business dealings ===

McMahon first met the promoter for Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC), his father, Vincent J. McMahon, when 12. At that point, McMahon became interested in following in his father&#x27;s professional wrestling footsteps and often accompanied him on trips to Madison Square Garden. McMahon wanted to be a wrestler, but his father did not allow him, explaining that promoters did not appear on the show and should stay apart from their wrestlers.

In 1968, McMahon graduated from East Carolina University with a business degree and after a nondescript career as a traveling salesman, he was eager to assume a managerial role in his father&#x27;s World Wide Wrestling Federation promotion. In 1969, McMahon made his debut as a ring announcer for the WWWF&#x27;s &quot;All-Star Wrestling&quot;. In 1971, he was assigned to a small territory in Maine, where he promoted his first card. He later became the play-by-play commentator for television matches after replacing Ray Morgan in 1971, a role he regularly maintained until November 1997.

In the 1970s, McMahon became a prominent force in his father&#x27;s company and, over the next decade, assisted his father in tripling TV syndication. The younger McMahon was also behind the Muhammad Ali versus Antonio Inoki match of 1976. He pushed for the renaming of the company to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1979.

On February 21, 1980, McMahon officially founded Titan Sports and the company&#x27;s headquarters were established in South Yarmouth, Massachusetts, using the now-defunct Cape Cod Coliseum as a home base for the company. McMahon then became chairman of the company and his wife, Linda, became the &quot;co-chief executive&quot;. In 1982, Titan acquired control of the CWC from McMahon&#x27;s ailing father (who died in May 1984) and his partners.

==== Purchase of the WWF and 1980s wrestling boom ====
When he purchased the WWF in 1982, professional wrestling was a business run by regional promotions. Various promoters understood that they would not invade each other&#x27;s territories, as this practice had gone on undeterred for decades. The National Wrestling Alliance became the governing body for all the regional territories across the country and as far away as Japan. McMahon had a different vision of what the industry could become. In 1983, the WWF split from the NWA again (it had left the NWA in 1963 but rejoined in 1971).

He began expanding the company nationally by promoting in areas outside of the company&#x27;s Northeast U.S. stomping grounds and by signing talent from other companies, such as the American Wrestling Association (AWA). In 1984, he recruited Hulk Hogan to be the WWF&#x27;s charismatic new megastar, and the two quickly drew the ire of industry peers as the promotion began traveling and broadcasting into rival territories. McMahon, who still also fronted as the WWF&#x27;s squeaky clean babyface announcer, created &quot;The Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Wrestling Connection&quot; by incorporating pop music stars into wrestling storylines.

As a result, the WWF was able to expand its fanbase into a national mainstream audience as the promotion was featured heavily on MTV programming. On March 31, 1985, he ran the first WrestleMania at Madison Square Garden, available on closed-circuit television in various markets throughout the United States. McMahon&#x27;s success of birthing WrestleMania in the 1980s had a significant impact on the 1980s professional wrestling boom during the Golden Age Era.

During the late 1980s, McMahon shaped the WWF into a unique sports entertainment brand that reached out to family audiences while attracting fans who hadn&#x27;t paid attention to pro wrestling before. By directing his storylines toward highly publicized supercards, McMahon capitalized on a fledgling revenue stream by promoting these events live on pay-per-view television. In 1987, the WWF reportedly drew 93,173 fans to the Pontiac Silverdome (which was called the &quot;biggest crowd in sports-entertainment history&quot;) for WrestleMania III, which featured the main event of Hulk Hogan vs. André the Giant.

==== Business decline and the Attitude Era ====

In 1993, the company entered the New Generation Era, one of McMahon&#x27;s toughest times since taking over the company as business went up and down with various projects in the company.

After struggling against Ted Turner&#x27;s World Championship Wrestling (WCW), McMahon cemented the WWF as the preeminent wrestling promotion in the late 1990s when initiating a new brand strategy that eventually returned the WWF to prominence. Sensing a public shift toward a more hardened and cynical fan base, McMahon redirected storylines toward a more adult-oriented model. The concept became known as &quot;WWF Attitude&quot; and McMahon commenced the new era when manipulating the WWF Championship away from Bret Hart at Survivor Series (now known as the &quot;Montreal Screwjob&quot;). McMahon announced the beginning of the Attitude Era on the December 15th, 1997 episode of Monday Night Raw, where McMahon stated &quot;This is a conscious effort on our part to &#x27;open the creative envelope&#x27;, in order to entertain in a more contemporary manner, extends far beyond the strict confines of sports presentation into the wide open environment of broad based entertainment. We borrow from such programs niches like soap-operas and others widely accepted forms of television entertainment and tired of the same old simplistic theory of &#x27;good guys versus bad guys&#x27;. Surely the era is definitely, passe. Therefore, we’ve embarked on a far more innovative and contemporary creative campaign, that is far more invigorating and extemporaneous than ever before&quot;.

McMahon, who, for years, had downplayed his ownership of the company and was mostly known as a commentator, became involved in WWF storylines as the evil Mr. McMahon, who began a legendary feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin, who challenged his authority. As a result, the WWF suddenly found itself back in national pop-culture, drawing millions of viewers for its weekly &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; broadcasts, which ranked among the highest-rated shows on cable television. In October 1999, McMahon led the WWF in an initial public offering of company stock. Also, during the Attitude Era, the company embraced this period by incorporating foul language, graphic violence, and controversial stipulations such as Bra and Panties matches.

==== Monday Night War and acquisition of WCW and ECW ====
On June 24, 1999, McMahon appeared on the &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; show and said he viewed Ted Turner as his rival, stating &quot;All I&#x27;ll say about Ted is he&#x27;s a son-of-a-bitch, other than that, he&#x27;s probably not a bad guy, but I don&#x27;t like him at all&quot;.

McMahon later came out victorious against Ted Turner&#x27;s World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in the television ratings in the Monday Night War after an initial 84-week television ratings loss to WCW and afterward acquired the fading WCW from Turner Broadcasting System on March 23, 2001, with an end to the Monday Night War. On April 1, 2001, Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) filed for bankruptcy leaving WWF as the last major wrestling promotion at that time. McMahon later acquired the assets of ECW on January 28, 2003.

In September 2020, professional wrestling promoter, WWE Hall of Famer, and former WCW president Eric Bischoff revealed that during this period of the Monday Night War in television ratings battles between WWE and WCW &quot;Vince was petitioning a lot for Ted. He was trying to embarrass Ted, trying to create some anxiety with the shareholders of Turner Broadcasting. Vince was trying to create some unrest and anxiety by being very, very critical about WCW&quot; and &quot;whenever you&#x27;d see blood in WCW, Vince would write these letters from the king&#x27;s court to Ted criticizing him, and WCW, and the health and welfare of the talent by saying it&#x27;s gross, it&#x27;s crap, and all this. And then he&#x27;d turn around and do the same thing a month later. None of us took any of those letters very seriously, and it was pretty obvious what Vince was trying to do. We all just chuckled about it&quot;.

In a conference call in 2021, McMahon described the &quot;situation where &#x27;rising tides&#x27; because that was when Ted Turner was coming after us with all of Time Warner&#x27;s assets as well&quot;.

==== World Wildlife Fund lawsuit: WWF becomes WWE ====
On May 5, 2002, World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. announced that it would be changing both its company name and the name of its wrestling promotion to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) after the company had lost a lawsuit initiated by the World Wildlife Fund over the WWF trademark. The name change officially occurred the following day on May 6. Although mainly caused by the ruling in favor of the World Wildlife Fund regarding the &quot;WWF&quot; initialism, the company noted it provided an opportunity to emphasize its focus on entertainment.

==== Ruthless Aggression Era and transition to PG rating ====

Shortly after its name change, WWE transitioned into its Ruthless Aggression Era; McMahon officially referred to the new era as &quot;Ruthless Aggression&quot; on June 24, 2002. This period still featured many similar elements of its predecessor the Attitude Era, including the levels of violence, sex, and profanity, but there was less politically incorrect content, and a further emphasis on wrestling was showcased.

In July 2008, all WWE programs shifted to TV-PG ratings. McMahon also stated that the Attitude Era of the late 1990s and early 2000s was the result of competition from WCW and forced the company to &quot;go for the jugular&quot;. Due to WCW&#x27;s demise in 2001, McMahon says that they &quot;don&#x27;t have to&quot; appeal to viewers in the same way and that during the &quot;far more scripted&quot; PG Era, WWE could &quot;give the audience what they want in a far more sophisticated way&quot;. McMahon also stated that the move to PG cut the &quot;excess&quot; of the Attitude Era and &quot;ushered in a new era of refined and compelling storytelling&quot;. McMahon also had the most say in the WWE company&#x27;s creative direction. The move into the PG Era made the promotion more appealing to corporate sponsors.

On April 7, 2011, McMahon&#x27;s company ceased using the full name World Wrestling Entertainment and henceforth referred to itself solely as WWE, making the latter an orphan initialism. This was said to reflect WWE&#x27;s global entertainment expansion away from the ring with the ultimate goal of acquiring entertainment companies and putting a focus on television, live events, and film production. WWE noted that their new company model was put into effect with the relaunch of &quot;Tough Enough&quot;, being a non-scripted program (contrary to the scripted nature of professional wrestling) and with the launch of the WWE Network (at the time scheduled to launch in 2012; later pushed back to 2014). The legal name of the company remained World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. for the time.

==== Competition with AEW ====

In 2019, Tony Khan&#x27;s All Elite Wrestling (better known as AEW) emerged as the second largest professional wrestling promotion in the market after WWE, and during a conference call on July 25, 2019, McMahon announced a new direction for WWE where he stated that it would &quot;be a bit edgier, but still remain in the PG environment&quot;. In another conference call on July 29, 2021, McMahon stated that he doesn&#x27;t consider AEW competition and that he was &quot;not so sure what their investments are as far as their talent is concerned&quot;. &quot;WWE NXT&quot; and &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot; competed in the Wednesday Night Wars, from October 2, 2019, to April 7, 2021, which ended with &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot; emerging victorious and &quot;NXT&quot; moving to Tuesday nights. This eventually led WWE to revamp &quot;NXT&quot; with major changes to &quot;NXT 2.0&quot; starting from the September 14, 2021, episode.

==== Resignation and retirement ====
McMahon voluntarily stepped down as chairman and CEO of WWE on June 17, 2022, pending an internal investigation, with his daughter Stephanie McMahon being named the interim CEO and interim chairwoman of the WWE. McMahon continued to oversee WWE creative and content development. On July 22, Vince McMahon officially announced his retirement from WWE and named his daughter Stephanie McMahon, the company&#x27;s new permanent chairwoman and co-CEO (alongside Nick Khan). Triple H then replaced Vince McMahon as Head of WWE creative.

==== TKO executive chairman and second resignation ====
It was announced on January 6, 2023, by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that McMahon was planning a return to WWE as executive chairman, ahead of upcoming media rights negotiations in 2024 and also to explore a potential sale of the company. On January 6, WWE published a filing with the SEC, appointing Vince McMahon by himself, George Barrios and Michelle Wilson back to the WWE Board of Directors. On January 10, McMahon assumed the role of executive Chairman of the WWE. On April 3, Endeavor Group Holdings announced a deal under which WWE would merge with the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) to form a new publicly traded company trading under the symbol &quot;TKO&quot;. Endeavor will hold a 51% stake in TKO, with WWE&#x27;s shareholders having a 49% stake, valuing WWE at $9.3 billion. McMahon will serve as the executive chairman of TKO and oversee the new company&#x27;s WWE and UFC divisions. Upon completion of the deal, McMahon was expected to personally own 34% of TKO Group.

The merger between WWE and UFC as TKO was completed on September 12, 2023, with WWE and UFC continuing to operate as separate divisions of TKO by focusing on professional wrestling and mixed martial arts respectively. On October 15, it was announced that Endeavor Group Holdings CEO Ari Emanuel made the call to remove McMahon from WWE creative power and then granted the responsibility to Triple H to drive 99.9% of the creative moving forward. As a result, McMahon is no longer involved in the WWE creative direction of the company.

On January 26, 2024, one day after a report about alleged sexual assaults committed by McMahon was published by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Deadline&quot; confirmed that McMahon had resigned from TKO. In a statement, he said the decision was made &quot;out of respect for the WWE Universe, TKO, shareholders, and business partners.&quot;

In March 2024, McMahon filed to sell $411.95 million worth of TKO stock amidst allegations of sexual assault, following a previous sale of shares worth $670.3 million in November. McMahon, who resigned from the TKO board earlier due to a lawsuit alleging abuse and sexual exploitation, owns approximately 15 million shares of TKO Group&#x27;s Class A shares after the recent transactions.

=== Other business dealings ===

In 1979, Vince and Linda purchased the Cape Cod Coliseum and the Cape Cod Buccaneers of the Atlantic Coast Hockey League. In addition to pro wrestling and hockey, they began selling out rock concerts (including Van Halen and Rush) in non-summer months, traditionally considered unprofitable due to lack of tourists. This venture led the McMahons to join the International Association of Arena Managers, learning the details of the arena business and networking with other managers through IAAM conferences, which Linda later called a great benefit to WWE&#x27;s success.

In 1990, McMahon founded the World Bodybuilding Federation organization, which folded in 1992.

In 2000, McMahon again ventured outside the world of professional wrestling by launching the XFL, a professional American football league. The league began in February 2001, with McMahon making an appearance at the first game, but folded after one season due to low television ratings. This wasn&#x27;t until January 25, 2018, when he announced its resurrection. The league filed for bankruptcy on April 13, 2020.

In February 2014, McMahon helped launch an over-the-top streaming service called the WWE Network.

In 2017, McMahon established Alpha Entertainment, a separate entity from WWE.

=== Charity work ===
Vince and Linda McMahon donated over $8 million in 2008, giving grants to the Fishburne Military School, Sacred Heart University, and East Carolina University. &quot;Nonprofit Quarterly&quot; noted the majority of the McMahons&#x27; donations were toward capital expenditures. In 2006, they paid $2.5 million for construction of a tennis facility in Ebensburg, Pennsylvania. The McMahons have supported the Special Olympics since 1986, first developing an interest through their friendship with NBC producer Dick Ebersol and Susan Saint James, who encouraged them to participate.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== WWE and predecessors (1969–2024) ===
==== Commentator (1969–1997) ====

Before the evolution of the Mr. McMahon character, McMahon appeared as a commentator on television. His executive role was not publicized to maintain the illusion of wrestling&#x27;s staged story lines, or kayfabe. While McMahon did publicly identify himself as the owner of the WWF outside of WWF programming, on television his ownership of the WWF was considered an open secret through the mid-1990s. Jack Tunney was portrayed as the president of WWF instead of McMahon.

In 1969, McMahon began appearing on untelevised WWWF events as a ring announcer. McMahon made his commentary debut in 1971 when he replaced Ray Morgan after Morgan had a pay dispute with McMahon&#x27;s father, Vincent J. McMahon, shortly before a scheduled television taping. The elder McMahon let Morgan walk instead of giving in to his demands and needed a replacement on the spot, offering it to his son. For the younger McMahon, it was also somewhat of a compromise, as it allowed him to appear on television. McMahon wanted to be a wrestler but his father did not let him, explaining that promoters did not appear on the show and should stay apart from their wrestlers.

McMahon eventually became the regular play-by-play commentator and maintained that role until November 1997, portraying himself originally as mild-mannered and diplomatic until 1984. In addition to matches, McMahon hosted other WWF shows, and introduced WWF programming to TBS on Black Saturday, upon the WWF&#x27;s acquisition of Georgia Championship Wrestling and its lucrative Saturday night timeslot. McMahon sold the time slot to Jim Crockett Promotions after the move backfired on him. He eventually acquired JCP&#x27;s successor company, World Championship Wrestling, from AOL Time Warner in 2001. At the 1987 Slammy Awards, McMahon performed in a musical number and sang the song &quot;Stand Back&quot;. The campy &quot;Stand Back&quot; video has since resurfaced several times over the years as a running gag between McMahon and any face wrestler he is feuding with at that particular time, and was included on the 2006 &quot;McMahon&quot; DVD.

As a commentator, McMahon was a babyface &quot;voice of the fans&quot;, a contrast to the heel color commentator, usually Jesse Ventura, Bobby Heenan or Jerry Lawler. While most of McMahon&#x27;s on-screen physicality took place under his &quot;Mr. McMahon&quot; persona later in his career, he was involved in physical altercations on WWF television several times as a commentator or host. First, in 1977, when he and Arnold Skaaland were struck from behind by Captain Lou Albano, as part of a kayfabe &quot;Manager Of the Year&quot; storyline, when Albano was disgruntled over losing to Skaaland.

In 1985, Andre the Giant grabbed him by the collar during an interview on &quot;Tuesday Night Titans&quot;. Andre had become irritated at McMahon&#x27;s questions regarding his feud with Big John Studd and their match at the first WrestleMania. On the September 28, 1991, episode of &quot;WWF Superstars of Wrestling&quot;, when Roddy Piper mistakenly hit him with a folding chair aimed at Ric Flair (requiring McMahon to be taken out of the arena on a stretcher), and again on the November 8, 1993, episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, when Randy Savage hurled him to the floor in an attempt to attack Crush after McMahon attempted to restrain him.

McMahon can be seen screaming at medics and WWF personnel during the May 26, 1990, episode of &quot;WWF Superstars of Wrestling&quot;, after Hulk Hogan was attacked by Earthquake during a segment of &quot;The Brother Love Show&quot;, when Hogan was not moved out of the arena quickly enough.

==== Creation of the Mr. McMahon character (1996–1997) ====

Throughout late 1996 and into 1997, McMahon slowly began to be referred to as the owner on WWF television while remaining as the company&#x27;s lead play-by-play commentator. On the September 23, 1996 &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, Jim Ross delivered a worked shoot promo during which he ran down McMahon, outing him as chairman and not just a commentator for the first time in WWF storylines. This was followed up on the October 23 &quot;Raw&quot; with Stone Cold Steve Austin referring to then-WWF President Gorilla Monsoon as &quot;just a puppet&quot; and that it was McMahon &quot;pulling all the strings&quot;. The March 17, 1997 &quot;WWF Raw Is War&quot; is cited by some as the beginning of the Mr. McMahon character, as after Bret Hart lost to Sycho Sid in a steel cage match for the WWF Championship, Hart engaged in an expletive-laden rant against McMahon and WWF management. This rant followed Hart shoving McMahon to the ground when he attempted to conduct a post-match interview. McMahon, himself, returned to the commentary position and nearly cursed out Hart before being calmed down by Ross and Lawler.

McMahon largely remained a commentator after the Bret Hart incident on &quot;Raw&quot;. On September 22, 1997, on the first-ever &quot;Raw&quot; to be broadcast from Madison Square Garden, Bret&#x27;s brother Owen Hart was giving a speech to the fans in attendance. During his speech, Stone Cold Steve Austin entered the ring with five NYPD officers following and assaulted Hart. When it appeared Austin would fight the officers, McMahon ran into the ring to lecture him that he could not physically compete; at the time, Austin was recovering from a broken neck after Owen Hart botched a piledriver in his match against Austin at SummerSlam. After telling McMahon that he respects the fact that he and the WWF cared, Austin attacked McMahon with a Stone Cold Stunner, leaving McMahon in shock. Austin was then arrested on charges of trespassing, assault, and assaulting a police officer. This marked the beginning of the Austin-McMahon rivalry.

At Survivor Series in 1997, Bret Hart defended his WWF Championship against long-time rival Shawn Michaels in the main event. During the match, Michaels applied Hart&#x27;s signature submission maneuver The Sharpshooter on Hart. Though Hart did not submit, McMahon ordered the referee to ring the bell, thus screwing Hart out of the title and making Michaels the champion and making McMahon turn heel for the first time on WWF television. This incident was subsequently dubbed the &quot;Montreal Screwjob&quot;. Following the incident, McMahon left the commentary table for good (Jim Ross replaced McMahon as lead commentator) and the Mr. McMahon character began.

==== Feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin (1997–1999) ====
In December 1997 on &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, the night after D-Generation X: In Your House, McMahon talked about the behavior and attitude of Stone Cold Steve Austin, such as Austin having assaulted WWF Commissioner Sgt. Slaughter and commentators such as Jim Ross and McMahon himself. Mr. McMahon demanded that Austin defend his Intercontinental Championship against The Rock in a rematch. As in the previous match, Austin used his pickup truck as a weapon against The Rock and the Nation of Domination gang. Austin decided to forfeit the title to The Rock, but instead, Austin gave The Rock a &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot; and knocked McMahon off the ring ropes.

During the storyline between Austin and Michaels, McMahon involved Mike Tyson, who joined D-Generation X (DX). During the WrestleMania XIV main event, Mike Tyson turned on Shawn Michaels and assisted Austin in becoming WWF Champion. After Austin won the title, McMahon sent Dude Love to defeat Austin at and Over the Edge: In Your House, where Austin retained. By employing the services of The Undertaker and Kane, McMahon set up a triple threat match for the WWF Championship between Austin, The Undertaker, and Kane at , in which The Undertaker and Kane could only win by pinning Austin. At Breakdown, Austin lost the title after he was pinned simultaneously by The Undertaker and Kane, neither of whom became champion.

The following night on &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, McMahon attempted to announce a new WWF Champion. He held a presentation ceremony and introduced The Undertaker and Kane. After saying that both deserved to be the WWF Champion, Austin drove a Zamboni into the arena and attacked McMahon before police officers stopped him, and arrested him. Because The Undertaker and Kane both failed to defend McMahon from Austin, McMahon did not name a new champion, but instead made a match at Judgment Day: In Your House between The Undertaker and Kane with Austin as the special referee. This prompted The Undertaker and Kane to attack Mr. McMahon, injuring his ankle because he gave them the finger behind their backs.

At Judgement Day, there was still no champion crowned as Austin declared himself the winner after counting a double pinfall three count for both men. McMahon ordered the WWF Championship to be defended in a 14-man tournament named Deadly Games at Survivor Series in 1998. McMahon made sure that Mankind reached the finals because Mankind had visited McMahon in the hospital after McMahon was sent to the hospital by The Undertaker and Kane. He also awarded Mankind the WWF Hardcore Championship due to his status as a hardcore wrestling legend. Originally, McMahon was acting as he if he was helping out Mankind during the match.

At one point, The Rock turned his attention to McMahon. McMahon turned on Mankind after a screwjob, as The Rock had caught Mankind in the Sharpshooter. Mankind had not submitted but McMahon ordered the referee to ring the bell, thus giving The Rock the WWF Championship. This was a homage to the &quot;Montreal Screwjob&quot; that occurred one year earlier. McMahon referred to The Rock as the &quot;Corporate Champion&quot; thus forming the corporation with his son Shane and The Rock.

At Rock Bottom: In Your House, Mankind defeated The Rock to win the WWF Championship after The Rock passed out to the Mandible Claw. McMahon, screwed Mankind once again by reversing the decision and returning the belt to his chosen champion, The Rock. McMahon participated in a &quot;Corporate Rumble&quot; on the January 11, 1999 &quot;Raw&quot; as an unscheduled participant, but was eliminated by Chyna.

McMahon restarted a long-running feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin when, in December 1998, he made Austin face The Undertaker in a Buried Alive match with the Royal Rumble qualification on the line. Austin defeated The Undertaker with help from Kane. McMahon had put up $100,000 to anyone who could eliminate Austin from the Royal Rumble match. At Royal Rumble, thanks to help from the corporation&#x27;s attack on Austin in the women&#x27;s bathroom during the match. Austin and McMahon went under the ropes, not over them as the Royal Rumble rules require for elimination to occur, along with the &#x27;Shawn Michaels Rule&#x27;, in which both feet must touch the floor after going over the top rope.

The Rock distracted Austin, and McMahon lifted Austin over the top rope from behind, winning the match and earning a title shot at WrestleMania XV against the WWF Champion The Rock. He turned down his spot, and WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels awarded it to Austin, which infuriated McMahon. Austin decided to put his title shot on the line against McMahon so he could get a chance to fight Vince at In Your House: St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre in a steel cage match. During the match, Big Show — a future member of the Corporation — interrupted, making his WWF debut. He threw Austin through the side of the cage thus giving him the victory.

The Corporation started a feud with The Undertaker&#x27;s new faction the &quot;Ministry of Darkness&quot;, which led to a storyline introducing McMahon&#x27;s daughter Stephanie. Stephanie played an &quot;innocent sweet girl&quot; who was kidnapped by The Ministry twice. The first time she was kidnapped, she was found by Ken Shamrock on behalf of McMahon in a basement of the stadium. The second time she was kidnapped, The Undertaker attempted to marry her whilst she was forcefully tied to the Ministry&#x27;s crucifix, but she was saved by Steve Austin. This angle saw a brief friendship develop between McMahon and Austin, cooling their long-running feud.

McMahon became a member of the short-lived stable The Union, during May 1999. McMahon&#x27;s son Shane merged the corporation with The Undertaker&#x27;s Ministry of Darkness to form the Corporate Ministry. On the June 7 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, McMahon was revealed as the &quot;Higher Power&quot; behind the Corporate Ministry. This not only reignited McMahon&#x27;s feud with WWF Champion Austin but also caused a kayfabe disgusted Linda and Stephanie McMahon to give their 50% share of the WWF to Austin.

At King of the Ring, Vince and Shane defeated Austin in a handicap ladder match to regain control of the WWF. While CEO, Austin had scheduled a WWF Championship match, to be shown on &quot;Raw is War&quot; after King Of The Ring. During the match, Austin defeated The Undertaker once again to become the WWF Champion. At Fully Loaded, Austin was again scheduled for a first blood match against The Undertaker. If Austin lost, he would be banned from wrestling for the WWF Championship again; if he won, Vince McMahon would be banned from appearing on WWF television. Austin defeated The Undertaker, and McMahon was banned from WWF television.

McMahon returned as a face in the fall of 1999 and won the WWF Championship in a match against Triple H, thanks to outside interference from Austin on the September 16 &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. He vacated the title on the following Monday&#x27;s &quot;Raw is War&quot; because he was not allowed on WWF television because of the stipulations of the Fully Loaded contract he signed. Austin reinstated him in return for a WWF title shot. Over the next few months, McMahon and Triple H feuded, with the linchpin of the feud being Triple H&#x27;s storyline marriage to Stephanie McMahon. The feud culminated at Armageddon in 1999; McMahon faced Triple H in a No Holds Barred match which McMahon lost. Afterward, Stephanie turned on him, revealing her true colors. McMahon, along with his son Shane, then disappeared from WWF television, unable to accept the union between Triple H and Stephanie. This left Triple H and Stephanie in complete control of the WWF.

==== McMahon-Helmsley Faction (2000–2001) ====
McMahon returned to WWF television on the March 13, 2000 &quot;Raw Is War&quot; helping The Rock win his WWF title shot back from the Big Show. He also attacked Shane McMahon and Triple H. Two weeks later, McMahon and The Rock defeated Shane McMahon and The Big Show in a tag team match with help from special guest referee Mankind. At WrestleMania 2000 on April 2, Triple H defended the WWF Championship in a Fatal Four-Way Elimination match in which each competitor had a McMahon in his corner. Triple H had his wife Stephanie McMahon who was also the WWF Women&#x27;s Champion in his corner, The Rock had Vince McMahon in his corner, Mick Foley had Linda McMahon in his corner, and Big Show had Shane in his corner. After Big Show and Foley were eliminated, Triple H and The Rock were left. Although Vince was in The Rock&#x27;s corner, he turned on The Rock after hitting him with a chair, turning heel for the first time since his feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin, which helped Triple H win the match and retain his title. This began the McMahon-Helmsley Era.
At King of the Ring on June 25, McMahon, Shane, and WWF Champion Triple H took on The Brothers of Destruction (The Undertaker and Kane) and The Rock in a six-man tag team match for the WWF Championship. This match stipulated that whoever made the scoring pinfall would become the WWF Champion. McMahon was pinned by The Rock. McMahon was then absent from WWF television until late 2000. On the December 4 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, McMahon questioned the motives of WWF Commissioner Mick Foley and expressed concern of the well-being of the six superstars competing in the Hell in a Cell match at Armageddon on December 10. On the December 18 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, McMahon faced Kurt Angle in a non-title match which was fought to no contest when Mick Foley interfered and attacked both men. After the match, both men beat Foley and McMahon fired him.

McMahon then began a public extramarital affair with Trish Stratus, much to the disgust of his daughter, Stephanie. On the February 26, 2001 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon and Stephanie humiliated Trish by dumping sewage on her, with McMahon adding that Stephanie will always be &quot;daddy&#x27;s little girl&quot; and Trish was only &quot;daddy&#x27;s little toy&quot;. McMahon and Stephanie then aligned together against Shane, who&#x27;d returned and had enough of Vince&#x27;s actions in recent months.

At WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1, McMahon lost to Shane after Linda—who had been emotionally abused to the point of a nervous breakdown; the breakdown was caused after Vince demanded a divorce on the December 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;; the breakdown left her helpless as she was deemed unable to continue being CEO of the WWF at the time, giving Vince 100% authority; finally, she was heavily sedated, in the storyline—hit Vince with a low blow.

On the same night, McMahon allied with Stone Cold Steve Austin, helping him defeat The Rock to gain another WWF Championship. The two, along with Triple H, allied. Austin and Triple H put The Rock out of action with a brutal assault and suspension; this was done so The Rock could film &quot;The Scorpion King&quot;. Austin and Triple H held all three major WWF titles at the same time. The alliance was short-lived, due to an injury to Triple H and a business venture by McMahon.

==== WCW/ECW Invasion and the brand extension (2001–2005) ====
McMahon purchased long-time rival promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in March from AOL Time Warner and signed many wrestlers from WCW. This marked the beginning of the Invasion storyline, in which the former WCW wrestlers regularly fought matches against the WWF wrestlers. On the July 9 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, some extremists as well as several former ECW wrestlers on the WWF roster, joined with the WCW wrestlers to form The Alliance. Stone Cold Steve Austin joined the Alliance, along with Shane and Stephanie McMahon. Vince McMahon led Team WWF thus turning face. At Survivor Series on November 18, Team WWF defeated Team Alliance in a Survivor Series elimination match to pick up the victory and end the Invasion storyline.

Following the collapse of The Alliance, McMahon created the &quot;Vince McMahon Kiss My Ass Club&quot;, also known as the &quot;Mr. McMahon Kiss My Ass Club&quot;, which consisted of various WWE individuals being ordered to kiss his buttocks in the middle of the ring, usually with the threat of suspension or firing if they refused reverting to a heel. The club was originally proclaimed closed by The Rock after McMahon was forced to kiss Rikishi&#x27;s buttocks on an episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. In November, Ric Flair returned to WWF after an eight-year hiatus declaring himself the co-owner of the WWF, which infuriated McMahon. The two faced each other at the Royal Rumble on January 20, 2002, in a Street Fight which Flair won. Due to their status as co-owners, McMahon became the owner of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; while Flair became the owner of &quot;Raw&quot;. On the June 10 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon defeated Flair to end the rivalry and become the sole owner of WWE.

On the February 13, 2003 &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, McMahon tried to derail the return of Hulk Hogan after a five-month hiatus but was knocked out by Hogan and received a running leg drop. At No Way Out on February 23, McMahon interfered in Hogan&#x27;s match with The Rock. Hogan hit The Rock with a running leg drop and went for the pin, but the lights went out. When the lights came back on, McMahon came to the ringside to distract Hogan. Sylvain Grenier, the referee, gave The Rock a chair, which he then hit Hogan with. He ended the match with a Rock Bottom to defeat Hogan. This led to McMahon facing Hogan in a match at WrestleMania XIX on March 30, which McMahon lost in a Street Fight. McMahon then banned Hogan from the ring but Hogan returned under the gimmick of &quot;Mr. America&quot;. McMahon tried to prove that Mr. America was Hogan under a mask but failed at these attempts. Hogan later quit WWE and at which point McMahon claimed that he had discovered Mr. America was Hulk Hogan and &quot;fired&quot; him.

McMahon asked his daughter Stephanie to resign as SmackDown! General Manager on the October 2 &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Stephanie refused to resign and this set up an &quot;I Quit&quot; match between the two. At No Mercy on October 19, McMahon defeated Stephanie in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match when Linda threw in the towel. Later that night, he helped Brock Lesnar retain the WWE Championship against The Undertaker in a Biker Chain match. This started a rivalry between McMahon and The Undertaker. At Survivor Series on November 16, McMahon defeated The Undertaker in a Buried Alive match with help from Kane.

==== Various feuds (2005–2013) ====
He began a feud with Eric Bischoff in late 2005, when he decided that Bischoff was not doing a good job as general manager of &quot;Raw&quot; turning face again. He started &quot;The Trial of Eric Bischoff&quot; where McMahon served as the judge. Bischoff ended up losing the trial; McMahon &quot;fired&quot; him, and put him in a garbage truck before it drove away. Bischoff stayed gone for months. Almost a year later on &quot;Raw&quot; in late 2006, Bischoff was brought out by McMahon&#x27;s executive assistant Jonathan Coachman so that he could announce the completion of his book &quot;Controversy Creates Cash&quot;. Bischoff began blasting remarks at McMahon, saying that he was fired &quot;unceremoniously&quot; as the &quot;Raw&quot; General Manager, that there would be no McMahon if not for Bischoff&#x27;s over-the-top rebellious ideas, and that D-Generation X was nothing but a rip off of the New World Order.
On the December 26, 2005 &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon personally reviewed Bret Hart&#x27;s DVD. Shawn Michaels came out and he also started talking about Hart. McMahon replied, &quot;I screwed Bret Hart. Shawn, don&#x27;t make me screw you&quot;. At the 2006 Royal Rumble, when Michaels was among the final six remaining participants after eliminating Shelton Benjamin, McMahon&#x27;s entrance theme music distracted Michaels, allowing Shane McMahon to eliminate him. On the February 27 &quot;Raw&quot;, Michaels was knocked unconscious by Shane. When Michaels&#x27; former Rockers tag team partner Marty Jannetty came to the rescue of Michaels, he was forced to join McMahon&#x27;s &quot;Kiss My Ass Club&quot;. On &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXXII&quot;, Michaels faced Shane in a Street Fight. McMahon screwed Michaels while Shane had Michaels in the Sharpshooter. Michaels had not submitted, but McMahon ordered the referee to ring the bell, giving Shane the victory (another Montreal Screwjob reference). At WrestleMania 22, Vince McMahon faced Michaels in a No Holds Barred match. Despite interference from the Spirit Squad and Shane, McMahon was unable to beat Michaels. At Backlash, Vince McMahon and his son Shane defeated Michaels and &quot;God&quot; (characterized by a spotlight) in a No Holds Barred match.

On the May 15 &quot;Raw&quot;, Triple H hit Shane with a sledgehammer meant for Michaels. The next week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Triple H had another chance to hit Michaels with the object but he instead whacked the Spirit Squad. For a few weeks, McMahon ignored Michaels and began a rivalry with Triple H by forcing him to join &quot;Kiss My Ass Club&quot; (Triple H hit McMahon with a Pedigree instead of joining the club) and pitting him in a gauntlet handicap match against the Spirit Squad. Michaels saved Triple H and the two reformed D-Generation X (DX). This led to a feud between the McMahons and DX, throughout the following summer. He also with the Spirit Squad teaming with Shane lost to Eugene by disqualification on July 10. At SummerSlam in 2006, the McMahons lost to DX in a tag team match despite interference by Umaga, Big Show, Finlay, Mr. Kennedy, and William Regal. The McMahons also allied themselves with the ECW World Champion Big Show. At Unforgiven, the McMahons teamed up with The Big Show in a Hell in a Cell match to take on DX. Despite their 3-on-2 advantage, the McMahons lost again to DX thus ending the rivalry.

In January 2007, McMahon started a feud with Donald Trump, which was featured on major media outlets. Originally Trump wanted to fight McMahon himself but they came to a deal: both men would pick a representative to wrestle at WrestleMania 23 in a Hair vs. Hair match. The man whose wrestler lost would have his head shaved bald. After the contract signing on &quot;Raw&quot;, Trump pushed McMahon over the table in the ring onto his head after McMahon provoked Trump with several finger pokes to the shoulders. Later at a press conference, McMahon, during a photo opportunity, offered to shake hands with Trump but retracted his hand as Trump put out his. McMahon went on to fiddle with Trump&#x27;s tie and flick Trump&#x27;s nose. This angered Trump as he then slapped McMahon across the face. McMahon was then restrained from retaliating by Trump&#x27;s bodyguards and Bobby Lashley, Trump&#x27;s representative. At WrestleMania 23, McMahon&#x27;s representative (Umaga) lost the match. As a result, McMahon&#x27;s hair was shaved bald by Trump and Lashley with the help of Steve Austin, who was the special guest referee of the &quot;Battle of the Billionaires&quot; match.

McMahon then began a rivalry with Lashley over his ECW World Championship. At Backlash, McMahon pinned Lashley in a 3-on-1 handicap match teaming up with his son Shane and Umaga to win the ECW World Championship. At Judgment Day, McMahon defended his ECW World Championship against Lashley again in a 3-on-1 handicap match. Lashley won the match as he pinned Shane after a Dominator but McMahon said that he was still the champion because Lashley could only be champion if he could beat him. McMahon finally lost the ECW World Championship to Lashley at One Night Stand in a Street Fight despite interference by Shane and Umaga.
On June 11, 2007, WWE aired a segment at the end of &quot;Raw&quot; that featured McMahon entering a limousine moments before it exploded. The show went off-air shortly after, and WWE.com reported the angle within minutes as though it were a legitimate occurrence, proclaiming that McMahon was &quot;presumed dead&quot;. Although this was the fate of the fictional &quot;Mr. McMahon&quot; character, no harm came to the actual person; the &quot;presumed death&quot; of McMahon was part of a storyline. WWE later acknowledged to CNBC that he was not truly dead. The June 25 &quot;Raw&quot; was scheduled to be a three-hour memorial. Due to the actual death of Chris Benoit, the show opened with McMahon standing in an empty arena, acknowledging that his reported death was only of his character as part of a storyline. This was followed by a tribute to Benoit that filled the three-hour timeslot. McMahon appeared the next night on &quot;ECW on Sci Fi&quot; in which after acknowledging that a tribute to Benoit had aired the previous night, he announced that there would be no further mention of Benoit due to the circumstances becoming apparent and that the ECW show would be dedicated to those that had been affected by Benoit&#x27;s murder-suicide.
On the August 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the Mr. McMahon character returned and started a storyline where he had an illegitimate long-lost child, who was revealed as Hornswoggle on the September 10 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. In February 2008, after months of &quot;tough love&quot; antics toward Hornswoggle, John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield revealed that Hornswoggle was not McMahon&#x27;s son but Finlay&#x27;s. It turned out that the scam was thought up by Shane, Stephanie and Linda McMahon, along with Finlay. On the June 2 &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon announced that starting the next week, he would give away US$1 million live on &quot;Raw&quot;. Fans could register online, and each week randomly selected fans would receive a part of the $1 million. McMahon&#x27;s Million Dollar Mania lasted just three weeks and was suspended after the 3-hour Draft episode of &quot;Raw&quot; on June 23. After giving away $500,000, explosions tore apart the &quot;Raw&quot; stage, which fell and collapsed on top of McMahon. On June 30, Shane addressed the WWE audience before &quot;Raw&quot;, informing the fans that his family had chosen to keep his father&#x27;s condition private. He also urged the WWE roster to stand together during what he described as a &quot;turbulent time&quot;. The McMahons made several requests to the wrestlers for solidarity, before finally appointing Mike Adamle as the new general manager of &quot;Raw&quot; to restore order to the brand.
On the January 5, 2009 &quot;Raw&quot;, Chris Jericho told Stephanie McMahon that McMahon would be returning to &quot;Raw&quot; soon. The following week, Jericho was (kayfabe) fired from WWE by Stephanie. On the January 19 &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon returned, as a face, and supported his daughter&#x27;s decision on Jericho, but Stephanie rehired him. Randy Orton then came out and assaulted McMahon after harassing Stephanie. McMahon returned on the March 30 &quot;Raw&quot; with his son, Shane, and son-in-law Triple H to confront Orton. The night after WrestleMania 25, McMahon appeared on &quot;Raw&quot; to announce Orton would not receive another championship opportunity at Backlash, but compete in a six-man tag team match with his Legacy stablemates against Triple H, Shane McMahon and himself. &quot;Raw&quot; General Manager Vickie Guerrero made the match for the WWE Championship. Orton then challenged McMahon to a match that night, in which Legacy assaulted him, and Orton also hitting him with the RKO. After being assisted by Triple H, Shane and a returning Batista, McMahon announced Batista would replace him in the match at Backlash. On the June 15 &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon announced that he had sold the &quot;Raw&quot; brand to businessman Donald Trump. The next week, during the &quot;Trump is Raw&quot; show, McMahon bought the brand back from Trump. On the June 29 &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon announced that every week, a celebrity guest host would control &quot;Raw&quot; for the night. He soon appeared on &quot;SmackDown&quot;, putting Theodore Long on probation for his actions.

On August 24 &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon had a birthday bash which was interrupted by The Legacy, and competed in a six-man tag team match with his long-time rival team D-X, in which they won after the interference of John Cena. He continued to appear on &quot;SmackDown&quot;, making occasional matches and reminding Long that he was still on probation. On the November 16 &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon was called out by guest host Roddy Piper, who wanted a match with McMahon that night in Madison Square Garden. McMahon declined and announced his retirement from in-ring competition. On the January 4, 2010 &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon, once again a heel, confronted special guest host Bret &quot;The Hitman&quot; Hart for the (televised) first time since the Montreal Screwjob at Survivor Series 1997, to bury the hatchet from the above-mentioned Montreal Screwjob. The two appeared to finally bury the hatchet, but after shaking hands, Vince kicked Hart in the groin and left the arena to a loud chorus of boos and the crowd chanting &quot;You screwed Bret! You screwed Bret!&quot;.

A match was then booked between the two at WrestleMania XXVI, which saw Hart defeat McMahon in a No Holds Barred Lumberjack match. On the May 31 &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon returned to congratulate Hart on becoming the new Raw General Manager. On the June 22 &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon fired Hart for not dealing with &quot;NXT&quot; season one rookies, known as The Nexus. That same night, he announced the new general manager would be anonymous and make decisions via emails, which would be read by Michael Cole. The general manager&#x27;s first decision was McMahon to be the guest referee for a WWE Championship match that night between John Cena and Sheamus. The match was interrupted by The Nexus who then attacked McMahon. McMahon appeared in a segment on the November 1 &quot;Raw&quot;, in a coma from the attack by The Nexus. He woke up and his doctor (Freddie Prinze Jr.) explained what had happened since he had been out. The scene transitioned to Stephanie McMahon waking up, revealing it was all a dream.

In early 2011, McMahon once again stepped away from WWE storylines to focus on both his corporate and backstage duties. By the spring of 2011 McMahon had returned to WWE programming. On the June 27, 2011, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, CM Punk made a scathing on-air speech criticizing WWE and McMahon about the way WWE was run. McMahon suspended Punk but reinstated him at the behest of Punk&#x27;s Money in the Bank opponent, WWE Champion John Cena. At Money in the Bank, McMahon and Vice President of Talent Relations John Laurinaitis interfered on Cena&#x27;s behalf but Punk was ultimately successful and walked out of the company with the championship. On the following &quot;Raw&quot;, Triple H returned and, on behalf of WWE&#x27;s board of directors, fired McMahon from his position of running &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot;, though leaving him chairman of the board. Triple H then announced he had been designated chief operating officer of WWE. McMahon returned on the October 10 &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, firing Triple H from running &quot;Raw&quot;, stating the board of directors had called Triple H a financial catastrophe, and that WWE employees had voted no confidence in him the previous week. He subsequently appointed Laurinaitis as the interim general manager of &quot;Raw&quot;.

On June 11, 2012, McMahon returned to give a job evaluation to John Laurinaitis. After a conflict with Cena and Big Show that saw McMahon accidentally knocked out by Big Show, McMahon declared that if Big Show lost his match at No Way Out, Laurinaitis would be fired. Cena defeated Big Show in a steel cage match, and McMahon fired Laurinaitis. McMahon announced AJ Lee as &quot;Raw&quot; new general manager at &quot;Raw 1000&quot; and made Booker T SmackDown&#x27;s new general manager on August 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;. After CM Punk interrupted him on the October 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he challenged Punk to a match, threatening to fire him if he declined. The match did not officially start, but McMahon held his own in a brawl with Punk until Punk attempted the GTS. Ryback and Cena interfered and McMahon ultimately booked Punk in a match with Ryback at Hell in a Cell.

During the buildup for the 2013 Royal Rumble, McMahon told CM Punk that if The Shield interfered in his match with The Rock, Punk would forfeit the WWE Championship. During the match, the lights went out and The Rock was attacked by what appeared to be The Shield, leading to The Rock&#x27;s loss. McMahon came out and restarted the match at The Rock&#x27;s request and The Rock won the championship from Punk. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, while conducting a performance review on Paul Heyman, he was assaulted by the returning Brock Lesnar, who attacked him with the F-5. According to WWE.com, McMahon broke his pelvis and required surgery. Vince sought revenge on Heyman and faced him in a street fight on the February 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, but Lesnar again interfered, only for Triple H to interfere as well, setting up a rematch between Lesnar and Triple H at WrestleMania 29.

==== The Authority (2013–2017) ====
From June 2013, members of the McMahon family began to dispute various elements of the control of WWE, such as the fates of Daniel Bryan, and of &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot; general managers Brad Maddox and Vickie Guerrero. After Triple H and Stephanie created The Authority, McMahon celebrated Randy Orton&#x27;s victory at with them, but stepped aside from his on-screen authority role in early 2014 to evaluate Triple H and Stephanie&#x27;s control of the company.

McMahon returned on the November 3, 2014, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, making a stipulation that if Team Cena had defeated Team Authority at Survivor Series, The Authority would be removed from power. Team Cena won the match, but McMahon gave John Cena the option to reinstate The Authority. McMahon returned on the December 14, 2015, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, aligning himself with The Authority, by confronting Roman Reigns over his attack on Triple H at the pay-per-view. McMahon granted Reigns a rematch for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship against Sheamus, with the stipulation that if he failed to win the championship he would be fired. During the match, McMahon interfered on Sheamus&#x27; behalf but was attacked by Reigns, who then pinned Sheamus to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. On the December 28 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon was arrested for assaulting an NYPD officer and resisting arrest after a confrontation with Roman Reigns. McMahon made himself special guest referee in Reigns&#x27; rematch against Sheamus on the January 4, 2016, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where Reigns won after McMahon was knocked out and another referee made the decision. With his plan foiled, McMahon retaliated by announcing after the match that Reigns would defend his title at the Royal Rumble against 29 other men in the Royal Rumble match, which was won by Triple H.

On the February 22, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon presented the first-ever &quot;Vincent J. McMahon Legacy of Excellence&quot; Award to Stephanie before being interrupted Shane McMahon, who returned to WWE for the first time in over six years, confronting his father and sister, and claiming that he wanted control of &quot;Raw&quot;. This led to Vince book Shane against The Undertaker at WrestleMania 32 in a Hell in a Cell match with the stipulation that if Shane won, he would have full control of &quot;Raw&quot; and The Undertaker would be banned from competing in any future WrestleMania. On the April 4 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon gloated about Shane&#x27;s loss at WrestleMania the previous night, before Shane came out, accepted his defeat and said goodbye, leading McMahon to allow Shane to run that nights show, after feeling upstaged by his son. After Shane ran &quot;Raw&quot; for the rest of April, at Payback, McMahon announced Shane and Stephanie had joint control. On the April 3, 2017, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon returned to announce Kurt Angle as the new Raw General Manager and the upcoming Superstar Shake-up. On September 5, it was announced that McMahon would make an appearance on the September 12 episode of &quot;SmackDown Live&quot;. At the end of that night as a face, McMahon confronted Kevin Owens, who was unhappy about Vince&#x27;s son Shane attacking him the week before, which resulted in Shane being suspended. McMahon was furious about the heinous words regarding his family, and how Owens was not respectful, and how he planned to prosecute everybody who wronged him. McMahon warned him that his lawsuit would result in him being fired, but McMahon has the cash to deal with that empty threat. This prompted Owens to say Shane put his hands on him, but McMahon said he suspended Shane for not finishing off Owens. Shane was then reinstated to face Owens at the &quot;Hell in a Cell&quot; pay-per-view. Owens then attacked McMahon, leaving him lying in the ring. Even with several referees present, Owens continued to attack McMahon, and splashed down on him from atop one of the ring posts, resulting in McMahon being (kayfabe) injured. Stephanie McMahon also returned to help her father, as he was attended to by WWE officials.

==== Sporadic appearances and retirement (2018–2022) ====
On January 22, 2018, McMahon returned on &quot;Raw 25 Years&quot; to address the WWE Universe, only to later turn on them by calling them &quot;cheap&quot; turning heel once again. He was later confronted, and stunnered, by Stone Cold Steve Austin. On March 12, McMahon made an appearance in a backstage segment with Roman Reigns, announcing that Reigns would be suspended for his recent actions. On SmackDown 1000 McMahon returned as face once again after dancing on TruthTV. McMahon returned once again to WWE television on the December 17, 2018, episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, accompanied by his son Shane, daughter Stephanie McMahon, and his son-in-law Triple H, promising to shake things up as they admitted they weren&#x27;t performing as well as they should have. McMahon announced that the four of them would now &quot;run&quot; both &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown Live&quot; collectively. In early 2019, McMahon entered in the feud between Daniel Bryan and Kofi Kingston, not letting that latter receive a WWE championship match at WrestleMania.

McMahon returned to WWE television on the April 24, 2020, episode of &quot;Friday Night SmackDown&quot;, in celebration of Triple H&#x27;s 25th anniversary in WWE. He also appeared at Survivor Series introducing The Undertaker to the ring during his retirement celebrations, and in night 1 of WrestleMania 37 on April 10, 2021, to welcome the fans back in person at the Raymond James Stadium after a year of halting live events due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On the November 22, 2021, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon held an investigation to find out who stole Cleopatra&#x27;s Egg, a gift given to him by The Rock the previous night at Survivor Series. Later that night, Austin Theory revealed that he had stolen the Egg. McMahon rewarded Theory a WWE Championship match against Big E in the main event for &quot;showing intestinal fortitude&quot;, and over the next several months, McMahon gave career advice to Theory. In addition to being Theory&#x27;s mentor leading up to WrestleMania 38, he also promised Seth Rollins a match against a mystery opponent of his choosing. At WrestleMania 38, after Pat McAfee defeated Austin Theory, McMahon was challenged to an impromptu match by McAfee, which McMahon accepted, and in which McMahon defeated McAfee. This was McMahon&#x27;s first match in 12 years, as well as McMahon&#x27;s first win at WrestleMania. Following the match, Stone Cold Steve Austin interrupted McMahon and Theory celebrating the win and gave them both Stone Cold Stunners. McMahon made his last appearance on WWE programming on the June 27, 2022, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, introducing the returning John Cena on the 20th anniversary of his debut. In July 2022, McMahon retired from WWE.
=== United States Wrestling Association (1993) ===
While the Mr. McMahon character marked the first time that McMahon had been portrayed as a villain in WWF, in 1993, McMahon was engaged in a feud with Jerry Lawler as part of a cross-promotion between the WWF and the United States Wrestling Association (USWA). As part of the angle, McMahon sent various WWF wrestlers to Memphis to dethrone Lawler as the &quot;king of professional wrestling&quot;. This angle marked the first time that McMahon physically interjected himself into a match, as he occasionally tripped and punched at Lawler while seated ringside. During the angle, McMahon was not acknowledged as the owner of the WWF.

The feud was not acknowledged on WWF television, as the two continued to provide commentary together (along with Randy Savage) for the television show &quot;Superstars&quot;. The feud also helped build toward Lawler&#x27;s match with Bret Hart at SummerSlam. The peak of the angle came with Tatanka defeating Lawler to win the USWA Championship with McMahon gloating at Lawler while wearing the championship belt. This storyline came to an abrupt end when Lawler was accused of raping a young girl in Memphis, and he was dropped from the WWF. He returned shortly afterward, as the girl later stated that the rape accusations were lies.

== Professional wrestling style and persona ==

McMahon&#x27;s on-screen persona is known for his throaty exclamation of &quot;You&#x27;re fired!&quot;, and his &quot;power walk&quot;, an exaggerated strut toward the ring, swinging his arms and bobbing his head from side to side in a cocky manner. According to Jim Cornette, the power walk was inspired by one of McMahon&#x27;s favorite wrestlers as a child, Dr. Jerry Graham. The Fabulous Moolah claims in her autobiography that &quot;Nature Boy&quot; Buddy Rogers was the inspiration for the walk. According to composer Jim Johnston, the idea behind his theme song, &quot;No Chance in Hell&quot;, was &quot;He&#x27;s got the power, the money, and ..., he was pretty much the only game in town. ... Rather than a song about one man, I wanted it to be about &#x27;The Man.&#x27;&quot;

== Legacy in wrestling ==

Vince McMahon is often described as the most influential person in professional wrestling history and for having had a large impact on television and American culture. ESPN reporter Shaun Assael claimed that: &quot;As a TV pioneer, he went from selling costumed super-heroes like Hulk Hogan to dark anti-heroes like Steve Austin. He helped give birth to reality television by making himself a central character, and he launched The Rock into a movie career. No one in television can match his longevity. Few have his instincts for what sells.&quot;

Scott Hammond of &quot;VultureHound&quot; magazine praised the legacy of McMahon&#x27;s successes, from Hulkamania and WrestleMania being essential to the 1980s wrestling boom, to defeating WCW in the Monday Night Wars. His daughter, Stephanie McMahon, credits him for creating the term &quot;sports entertainment&quot; and publicly acknowledging wrestling&#x27;s predetermined nature, while Thom Loverro of &quot;The Washington Times&quot; ascribes McMahon with shaping reality television and American politics with sports entertainment. Television executive Dick Ebersol considers McMahon to be the best partner he has worked with and believes he has impacted American culture.

McMahon&#x27;s close friend and former on-screen rival, ex-U.S. president Donald Trump, praised McMahon, stating: &quot;People love this stuff, and it&#x27;s all because of Vince McMahon and his vision.&quot; Promoter and former WWF manager Jim Cornette called McMahon &quot;the most successful promoter ever&quot;, stating: &quot;If you could cross a genius with P. T. Barnum and [Trump], you would get the love child that would be Vince McMahon.&quot; Tony Khan, the promoter of rival promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW), considers McMahon to be one of his idols, while former WCW President Eric Bischoff describes him as &quot;brilliant&quot;.

Arn Anderson calls McMahon a &quot;marketing genius&quot; for attracting women and children to the product, but says it came at the expense of &quot;the bell-to-bell action&quot;, which is the reason most wrestlers got into the business. Cornette stated that older wrestlers dislike him for &quot;breaking the code&quot; by acknowledging that wrestling is predetermined, that fans who only watched during the Attitude Era will remember him well and that he will be criticized by modern fans for being &quot;an old man ... [that presides] over a bland, boring product&quot;. Although Hammond praised McMahon for his successes from the 1980s through the 2000s, he wrote that, &quot;from seemingly listening to the fans and pushing the talent that got the biggest reaction to just listening to himself, McMahon has therefore taken many wrong turns in recent years&quot;.

Jon Moxley, who wrestled for WWE as Dean Ambrose, left WWE in favor of then-upstart AEW because of WWE&#x27;s creative process in 2019 and singled out McMahon for being the problem. WWE recorded record annual profits into the 2020s, which &quot;MarketWatch&quot; reported had come at the cost of &quot;A diminished roster and less-than-inspiring story lines&quot;; by 2022, Bryan Alvarez of &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; commented that wrestling had declined in popularity due to the dwindling viewership since McMahon purchased WCW. An article in &quot;Variety&quot; also blamed McMahon for the continuous decrease in ratings over the years and urged investors to hold him accountable. Other criticisms of McMahon include Arn Anderson and Bret Hart commenting that McMahon has minimized tag team wrestling, while Assael also writes that &quot;Steroids will always be a part of [his] legacy&quot; because of his legal trial and the controversies that arose in the aftermath of Chris Benoit&#x27;s death.

The Undertaker has praised McMahon, referring to Vince as &quot;a caring human being, not the monster that people think that he is, I&#x27;ve never taken for granted the special opportunity he gave me, If Vince feels like there&#x27;s still something there, I have a place on the roster, then I had no problem doing it&quot;. Jim Ross has stated that &quot;People misunderstand Mr. McMahon and Vince McMahon. It&#x27;s a lot easier to bitch at somebody and knock them as Mr. McMahon than understand the human being that is Vince McMahon.&quot;

Drew McIntyre, Kurt Angle, Dwayne Johnson and John Cena praise him as being a father figure to them. Stone Cold Steve Austin says that he loves and respects McMahon, despite a previous acrimonious relationship at times. Chris Jericho has praised McMahon stating &quot;he&#x27;s set in his ways of doing things and they&#x27;re very successful&quot;, while Seth Rollins praised his ideas and longevity and Roman Reigns described him as a &quot;provider and a protector&quot; and said that he and his coworkers are grateful for him.

On September 25, 2024, Netflix released a documentary series detailing aspects of McMahon&#x27;s legacy, including his business impact and controversies, titled &quot;Mr. McMahon&quot;.

== Steroid supplier trial ==

In November 1993, McMahon was indicted in federal court after a steroid controversy engulfed the promotion and thus temporarily ceded control of the WWF to his wife Linda. The case went to trial in 1994, where McMahon was accused of distributing steroids to his wrestlers. One prosecution witness was Kevin Wacholz, who had wrestled for the company in 1992 as &quot;Nailz&quot; and who had been fired after a violent confrontation with McMahon. Wacholz testified that McMahon had ordered him to use steroids, but his credibility was called into question during his testimony as he made it clear he &quot;hated&quot; McMahon. In July 1994, the jury acquitted McMahon of the charges.

On July 6, 2021, production was announced on a new scripted television series called &quot;The United States of America vs. Vince McMahon&quot; centered around the case. The series is produced by a partnership of &quot;WWE Studios and Blumhouse Television&quot; and executive produced by McMahon and Kevin Dunn, WWE Executive Producer and Chief of Global Television Distribution.

== Sexual misconduct allegations ==
=== Rita Chatterton ===
On April 3, 1992, Rita Chatterton, a former referee noted for her stint as Rita Marie in the WWF in the 1980s and for being the first female referee in the WWF (possibly the first in professional wrestling history), made an appearance on Geraldo Rivera&#x27;s show &quot;Now It Can Be Told&quot;. She alleged that on July 16, 1986, McMahon tried to force her to perform oral sex on him in his limousine; when she refused, he raped her. Former wrestler Leonard Inzitari corroborated Chatterton&#x27;s allegation in a 2022 interview in &quot;New York Magazine&quot;.

Chatterton filed a sexual abuse lawsuit against McMahon in December 2022. McMahon settled the lawsuit involving Chatterton that month, with his attorney stating that he maintains his innocence but settled to &quot;avoid the cost of litigation&quot;. People familiar with the matter reported that McMahon agreed to a multimillion-dollar settlement with Chatterton. Though the exact sum of the settlement payment was not publicly disclosed, it has been acknowledged Chatterton sought $11.75 million in damages in her lawsuit.

=== 2006 and 2011 tanning bar incidents ===
McMahon was accused of sexual harassment by a worker at a tanning bar in Boca Raton, Florida, on February 1, 2006. McMahon was accused of showing nude photos of himself to her as well as groping and attempting to kiss the worker. At first, the charge appeared to be discredited because McMahon was in Miami for the 2006 Royal Rumble at the time. It was soon clarified that the alleged incident was reported to police on the day of the Rumble, but actually took place the day before. On March 25, it was reported that no charges would be filed against McMahon as a result of the investigation.

A separate tanning spa worker, who alleged that McMahon sexually assaulted her in California in 2011, filed a lawsuit against McMahon in December 2022.

=== Hush-money settlements and nondisclosure agreements ===
The WWE board, which McMahon controlled, began investigating a $3 million hush-money settlement that McMahon paid over an alleged affair with a former employee of the company in April 2022. The investigation also revealed other nondisclosure agreements related to misconduct claims by other women in the company against McMahon and executive John Laurinaitis, totaling $12 million. By October 2022, the WWE had disclosed $19.6 million in unrecorded payments McMahon made to settle sexual misconduct claims between 2006 and 2022.

In June 2022, McMahon stepped down as CEO and chairman of WWE, but continued to oversee content development. He later announced his retirement on July 22, 2022, only to return six months later. In January 2024, after reports on the sexual assault accusations by Janel Grant, McMahon resigned again, resigning from WWE parent company TKO.

On January 10, 2025, it was announced that McMahon was fined over $1.7 million by the Securities and Exchange Commission from undisclosed hush money payments, dated back from 2019 to 2022, handed out to two women while he was with the WWE.

=== Janel Grant ===
In January 2024, a lawsuit was filed by Janel Grant, a former employee at WWE global headquarters between 2019 and 2022. Grant alleged that McMahon had coerced her into a sexual relationship and, along with the WWE executive John Laurinaitis and a WWE wrestler who was also a former UFC fighter, sexually trafficked her, and repeatedly sexually assaulted her during 2020–2021. Grant alleged that she was subjected to &quot;extreme cruelty and degradation&quot; by McMahon, including being defecated upon during a sexual encounter. Grant stated that McMahon had agreed to pay her $3 million in 2022 in return for a NDA, but stopped paying after only $1 million had been paid following the initial public emergence of the sexual misconduct allegations the same year. One day after the report of the claims, on January 26, &quot;Deadline&quot; confirmed that McMahon had resigned from TKO. In a statement, McMahon denied the allegations, and said the decision was made &quot;out of respect for the WWE Universe, TKO, shareholders, and business partners&quot;.

On May 30, Grant agreed to &quot;stay her case&quot; against McMahon for six months at the request of the Department of Justice, who were launching an investigation into the McMahon allegations.

=== John Laurinaitis ===
On February 1, 2024, John Laurinaitis, former WWE executive and a co-defendant in the Janel Grant sex trafficking suit, released a statement through his attorney that accused McMahon of sexual misconduct. Laurinaitis, through his attorney, accused McMahon of holding &quot;power&quot; and &quot;control&quot; over him and of making &quot;dictatorial sexual demands with repercussions if not met.&quot;

=== Federal sexual assault and trafficking investigation ===
On February 2, 2024, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that federal authorities in New York had launched an investigation into sexual assault and sex trafficking allegations made against McMahon. Federal agents had previously executed a search warrant for McMahon&#x27;s phone and delivered a subpoena to him for documents related to any allegation of &quot;rape, sex trafficking, sexual assault, commercial sex transaction, harassment or discrimination&quot; against current or former WWE employees. The individuals named in the grand jury subpoena included a WWE contractor who was allegedly sent unsolicited nude photos and sexually harassed by McMahon, a former WWE wrestler who said McMahon coerced her into giving him oral sex, former WWF referee Rita Chatterton, who McMahon reportedly reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with after an allegation of sexual assault, a spa manager who said McMahon assaulted her at a Southern California resort, and a former WWE employee who alleged the head of talent relations at the company at the time, John Laurinaitis, demoted her after she ended a sexual relationship with him.

== Personal life ==
=== Family ===

McMahon married Linda Edwards on August 26, 1966, in New Bern, North Carolina. The two met in church when she was 13 and he was 16; at that time, he was known as Vinnie Lupton, using his stepfather&#x27;s surname. They were introduced by his mother. At some point prior to 2022, the two separated, but did not get a divorce.

Vince and Linda McMahon have two children together: Shane, who left WWE in 2010 and returned in 2016, and Stephanie, who continued to be active in a backstage role and onscreen from the 1990s until resigning in 2023. The two also have six grandchildren: Shane and his wife, Marissa Mazzola, have three sons named Declan, Kenyon, and Rogan, while Stephanie and her husband, Paul &quot;Triple H&quot; Levesque, have three daughters named Aurora, Murphy, and Vaughn.

=== Wealth ===
As of 2006, McMahon has a $12 million penthouse in Manhattan, New York; a $40 million mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut; a $20 million vacation home; and a 47-foot sports yacht named &quot;Sexy Bitch&quot;. His wealth has been noted at $1.1 billion, backing up WWE&#x27;s claim he was a billionaire for 2001, although he was reported to have since dropped off the list between 2002 and 2013. In 2014, McMahon had an estimated net worth of $1.2 billion. On May 16, 2014, McMahon&#x27;s worth dropped to an estimated $750 million after his WWE stock fell $350 million due to a price drop following disappointing business outcomes. In 2015, McMahon returned to the list with an estimated worth of $1.2 billion. In 2018, his net worth reached $3.6 billion.

=== Politics ===
Vince and Linda McMahon have donated to various Republican Party causes, including $1 million in 2014 to federal candidates and political action committees, such as Karl Rove&#x27;s American Crossroads and the research and tracking group America Rising. The McMahons have donated $5 million to Donald Trump&#x27;s former charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation.

<text>William Paxton (May 17, 1955 – February 25, 2017) was an American actor and filmmaker. He starred in films such as &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986), &quot;Near Dark&quot; (1987), &quot;Tombstone&quot; (1993), &quot;True Lies&quot; (1994), &quot;Apollo 13&quot; (1995), &quot;Twister&quot; (1996), &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; (1998), and &quot;A Simple Plan&quot; (1998). He had supporting roles in &quot;Weird Science&quot; (1985), &quot;Edge of Tomorrow&quot; (2014), and &quot;Nightcrawler&quot; (2014).

Paxton starred in the HBO drama series &quot;Big Love&quot; (2006–2011), for which he earned three Golden Globe Award nominations during the show&#x27;s run. He was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for portraying Randall McCoy in the History Channel miniseries &quot;Hatfields &amp; McCoys&quot; (2012).

== Early life ==

Paxton was born in Fort Worth, Texas, on May 17, 1955, the son of Mary Lou (&quot;née&quot; Gray; 1926–2016) and John Lane Paxton (1920–2011). His mother was a Catholic who raised him and his siblings in her faith. His father was a businessman, lumber wholesaler, museum executive, and (during his son&#x27;s career) an occasional actor, notably appearing in Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; films as Bernard Houseman and alongside Paxton in &quot;A Simple Plan&quot; (1998). His great-great-grandfather was Elisha Franklin Paxton (1828–1863), a brigadier general in the Confederate Army during the Civil War who was killed commanding the Stonewall Brigade at the Battle of Chancellorsville.

Paxton is distantly related to actress Sara Paxton and was the great-nephew of Mary Paxton Keeley, a prominent journalist and close friend of Bess Truman. At the age of eight, he was in the crowd when President John F. Kennedy emerged from the Hotel Texas in Fort Worth on the morning of his assassination on November 22, 1963. Photographs of Paxton being lifted above the crowd are on display at the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas. He later co-produced the film &quot;Parkland&quot; about the assassination. He graduated from Arlington Heights High School in Fort Worth in 1973, after which he studied at Richmond College in London, alongside his old high-school friend Danny Martin. There, they met fellow Texas native Tom Huckabee, with whom they made Super 8 short films for which they built their own sets. One of Paxton&#x27;s first lead roles was in Huckabee&#x27;s experimental film &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain&quot;. Paxton subsequently moved to Los Angeles, where he worked in props and art departments and as a parking valet at the Beverly Hills Hotel. After being rejected by film schools in Southern California, he switched his ambitions from directing to acting.

== Career ==
=== Acting and filmmaking ===

Among Paxton&#x27;s earliest roles were as a mortuary assistant in &quot;Mortuary&quot; (1983), a minor role as a punk in &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984), a minor role as a bartender in &quot;Streets of Fire&quot;, a supporting role as the lead protagonist&#x27;s bullying older brother Chet Donnelly in John Hughes&#x27;s &quot;Weird Science&quot; (1985), and Private William Hudson in &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986).

He directed several short films, including the music video for Barnes &amp; Barnes&#x27;s novelty song &quot;Fish Heads&quot;, which aired during &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;″s low-rated 1980–81 season and was in heavy rotation during the early days of Canadian music channel MuchMusic. He was cast in a music video for the 1982 Pat Benatar song &quot;Shadows of the Night&quot; in which he appeared as a Nazi radio officer.

In 1981, Paxton worked in the movie &quot;Stripes&quot; as a soldier, in the bar scene with John Candy and Bill Murray.

He worked alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger in &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984) and in &quot;Commando&quot; (1985), as well as in &quot;True Lies&quot; (1994), which reunited him with James Cameron. He reunited with Cameron on &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986). His performance in the latter film as Private Hudson earned him the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor.

He also appeared in &quot;Weird Science&quot; (1985). In 1987, Paxton played the most psychotic of the vampires, Severen, in Kathryn Bigelow&#x27;s critically acclaimed neo-Western horror film, &quot;Near Dark&quot;.
In 1990, Paxton appeared in &quot;Predator 2&quot; (1990). He collaborated with James Cameron again on &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), which was the highest-grossing film of all time at its release. In his other roles, Paxton played Morgan Earp in &quot;Tombstone&quot; (1993), Fred Haise in &quot;Apollo 13&quot; (1995), Bill Harding in &quot;Twister&quot; (1996), and lead roles in dark dramas such as &quot;One False Move&quot; (1992) and &quot;A Simple Plan&quot; (1998). In 1990, he co-starred with Charlie Sheen and Michael Biehn in &quot;Navy Seals&quot;.

Paxton also appeared in &quot;Indian Summer&quot; (1993) and &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; (1998). After 2000, he appeared in &quot;U-571&quot; (2000), &quot;Vertical Limit&quot; (2000), &quot;Frailty&quot; (2001), &quot;Broken Lizard&#x27;s Club Dread&quot; (2004), &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; (2004), &quot;Edge of Tomorrow&quot; (2014) and &quot;Nightcrawler&quot; (2014).

Paxton directed the feature films &quot;Frailty&quot; (2001), in which he also starred, and &quot;The Greatest Game Ever Played&quot; (2005). Four years after appearing in &quot;Titanic&quot;, he joined Cameron on an expedition to the wreck of the &quot;Titanic&quot;. A film about this trip, &quot;Ghosts of the Abyss&quot;, was released in 2003. He also appeared in the music video for Limp Bizkit&#x27;s 2003 song &quot;Eat You Alive&quot; as a sheriff. In addition, Paxton also played a character in both &quot;Spy Kids 2&quot; and &quot;Spy Kids 3-D&quot;.

Paxton starred in “A Bright Shining Lie” (HBO 1998), an American war drama television film written and directed by Terry George, based on Neil Sheehan&#x27;s 1988 book of the same name and the true story of John Paul Vann&#x27;s experience in the Vietnam War.

His highest-profile television performances received much positive attention, including his lead role in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Big Love&quot; (2006–2011), for which Paxton received three Golden Globe Award nominations. He also received positive reviews for his performance in the History Channel&#x27;s miniseries &quot;Hatfields &amp; McCoys&quot; (2012), for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award alongside co-star, Kevin Costner.

In 2014, he played the role of the villainous John Garrett in &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;, and a supporting role in &quot;Edge of Tomorrow&quot; (2014). He starred alongside Jon Bernthal, Rose McGowan and John Malkovich as a playable character in the 2014 video game &quot;Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare&quot; (downloadable &quot;Exo Zombies&quot; mode). Paxton starred as General Sam Houston in the Western miniseries &quot;Texas Rising&quot; for The History Channel in 2015.
In February 2016, Paxton was cast as Detective Frank Rourke for &quot;Training Day&quot;, a crime-thriller television series set 15 years after the events of the eponymous 2001 movie. It premiered a year later. His final film appearance was in &quot;The Circle&quot; (2017), released two months after his death.

=== Music ===

In 1982, Paxton and his friend Andrew Todd Rosenthal formed a new wave musical band called Martini Ranch. The band released its only full-length album, &quot;Holy Cow&quot;, in 1988 on Sire Records. The album was produced by Devo member Bob Casale, and featured guest appearances by two other members of that band. The music video for the band&#x27;s single &quot;Reach&quot; was directed by James Cameron. In 2018, his performances as Peter &quot;Coconut Pete&quot; Wabash in &quot;Broken Lizard&#x27;s Club Dread&quot; were released posthumously on the album &quot;Take Another Hit: The Best of Coconut Pete&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Paxton married Kelly Rowan in 1979 and they divorced a year later. He later met Louise Newbury on the Number 37 bus in Twickenham, London, where she was a student, and they were married in 1987. They lived in Ojai, California, and had two children: son James (b. 1994), who also became an actor, and daughter Lydia (b. 1997).

== Death and lawsuit ==
In early 2017, Paxton stated in an interview on &quot;WTF with Marc Maron&quot; that he had a damaged aortic heart valve, resulting from rheumatic fever that he contracted as a child. On February 14, 2017, he underwent open-heart surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles to repair the damaged valve and correct an aortic aneurysm. A day later, he underwent an emergency second surgery to repair a damaged coronary artery. His condition deteriorated over the following 10 days, and he died of a stroke on February 25 at the age of 61. He was cremated and his ashes were buried at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park of Hollywood Hills.

One year after Paxton&#x27;s death, his family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Ali Khoynezhad, the surgeon who performed his operation, alleging that Khoynezhad used &quot;high-risk and unconventional&quot; methods and that he was not present in the operating room when Paxton developed complications such as ventricular dysfunction, tachycardia, and a compromised right coronary artery, which they claim contributed to the coronary artery damage that necessitated a second surgery and ultimately led to Paxton&#x27;s death. The case was set for trial in Los Angeles Superior Court in March 2022. In February 2022, Paxton&#x27;s family reached a partial settlement with General Anesthesia Specialists Partnership for $1 million. In August 2022, the case was settled against Cedars-Sinai and Khoynezhad under undisclosed terms.

== Tributes ==
=== Public figures ===
Many dozens of filmmakers and actors across the entertainment spectrum paid tribute to Paxton in the aftermath of his death.

On February 26, 2017, while introducing the annual &quot;In Memoriam&quot; segment at the 89th Academy Awards the day after Paxton&#x27;s death, a visibly emotional Jennifer Aniston paid tribute to him. His &quot;Big Love&quot; co-star Chloë Sevigny remembered him as &quot;one of the less cynical, jaded people [she&#x27;d] ever met in the business&quot; and said, &quot;He believed in entertainment being transportive and transformative. He believed in the magic of what we can bring to people. That was really a gift that he gave to me.&quot; The television show &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; paid tribute at the end of its season-four episode &quot;What If...&quot;, and a number of storm chasers paid tribute to his role in &quot;Twister&quot; by spelling out his initials &quot;BP&quot; via the Spotter Network.

=== Films ===
The 2017 film &quot;Call Me by Your Name&quot; was dedicated to Paxton&#x27;s memory. The film&#x27;s producer, Peter Spears, explained that his husband Brian Swardstrom, who was also Paxton&#x27;s best friend and agent, once visited the set with Paxton during filming and befriended the film&#x27;s director Luca Guadagnino, who ultimately decided to dedicate the film &quot;in loving memory of Bill Paxton&quot;. Close friend and frequent collaborator James Cameron wrote a tribute in an article for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, detailing their 36-year friendship and expressing regret over the projects they would not be able to make together. The 2019 John Travolta film &quot;The Fanatic&quot;, which co-starred Paxton&#x27;s son James, was dedicated to Paxton. James would later play a younger version of Paxton&#x27;s S.H.I.E.L.D. character in the final season, which served as a tribute to his role in the show. Cameron&#x27;s 2022 film, &quot;&quot; was dedicated to the memory of Paxton as well as to James Horner, who previously worked with Cameron on &quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;Titanic&quot; and the first&quot; Avatar&quot;. Paxton worked with both Cameron and Horner on the former two films. Cameron had hoped to cast Paxton in the Avatar sequels before his death.

<doc id="303961" wikidata="Q1780267" url="?curid=303961" title="Mother (video game series)">
<text>(known as EarthBound outside Japan) is a video game series that consists of three role-playing video games: &quot;Mother&quot; (1989), known as &quot;EarthBound Beginnings&quot; outside Japan, for the Family Computer; &quot;Mother 2&quot; (1994), known as &quot;EarthBound&quot; outside Japan, for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System; and &quot;Mother 3&quot; (2006) for the Game Boy Advance.

Written by Shigesato Itoi, published by Nintendo, and featuring game mechanics modeled on the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series, &quot;Mother&quot; is known for its sense of humor, originality, and parody. The player uses weapons and psychic powers to fight hostile enemies, which include animated everyday objects, aliens and brainwashed people. Signature elements of the series include a lighthearted approach to the plot, battle sequences with psychedelic backgrounds, and the &quot;rolling HP meter&quot;: player health ticks down like an odometer rather than instantly being subtracted, allowing the player to take preventative action, such as healing or finishing the battle, before the damage is fully dealt. While the franchise is popular in Japan, in the Anglosphere it is best associated with the cult following behind &quot;EarthBound&quot;.

While visiting Nintendo for other business, Itoi approached Shigeru Miyamoto about making &quot;Mother&quot;. When approved for a sequel, Itoi increased his involvement in the design process over the five-year development of &quot;EarthBound&quot;. When the project began to flounder, producer and later Nintendo president Satoru Iwata rescued the game. &quot;EarthBound&quot; English localizers were given great liberties when translating the Japanese game&#x27;s cultural allusions. The American version sold poorly despite a multimillion-dollar marketing budget. &quot;Mother 3&quot; was originally slated for release on the Nintendo 64 and its 64DD disk drive accessory, but was cancelled in 2000. Three years later, the project was reannounced for the Game Boy Advance alongside a rerelease of &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;Mother 2&quot; in the combined cartridge &quot;Mother 1 + 2&quot;. &quot;Mother 3&quot; abandoned the 3D graphics progress for a 2D style, and became a bestseller upon its release. &quot;EarthBound&quot; was rereleased for the Wii U Virtual Console in 2013, and &quot;Mother&quot; received its English-language debut for the same platform in 2015, retitled &quot;EarthBound Beginnings&quot;. In 2022, Nintendo released &quot;Mother 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; to their Nintendo Switch Online service. &quot;Mother 3&quot; later came to the service exclusively in Japan in 2024.

&quot;EarthBound&quot; is widely regarded as a video game classic, and is included in multiple top-ten lists. In absence of continued official support for the series, members of the &quot;EarthBound&quot; fan community organized online to advocate for further series releases through petitions and fan art. Their projects include a full fan translation of &quot;Mother 3&quot;, a full-length documentary, and fangame attempts. Ness, the protagonist of &quot;EarthBound&quot; and Lucas, the protagonist of &quot;Mother 3&quot;, received exposure from their inclusion in all five entries of the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. Other &quot;Mother&quot; series locations and characters have made appearances in the fighting games.

== Gameplay ==
The series is known for its combination of humorous and emotionally evocative tones. Itoi wanted to tell &quot;Mother 3&quot; through a technique that swapped the active player-character, which he first attempted in &quot;EarthBound&quot;. The two games also share similar visual styles, both with psychedelic battle backgrounds and cartoonish art. While &quot;Mother 3&quot; music is both similar in tone to its predecessors and completely new, it features similar sound effects. &quot;EarthBound&quot; characters such as Mr. Saturn recur, and &quot;RPGamer&quot; wrote that &quot;Mother 3&quot; final chapter is &quot;full of blatant links&quot; between the games of the series. &quot;Mother&quot; also shares similarities with its sequel, such as the game save option through phoning Ninten&#x27;s father, an option to store items with Ninten&#x27;s sister at home, and an automated teller machine for banking money. Additionally, the members of the party follow behind the protagonist on the overworld screen in the first two games. Ninten&#x27;s party members in &quot;Mother&quot; are analogous to those of &quot;EarthBound&quot; in style and function.

While &quot;Mother&quot; battles were triggered through random encounters, &quot;EarthBound&quot; and early &quot;Mother 3&quot; shared battle scene triggers, where physical contact with an enemy in the overworld began a turn-based battle scene shown in the first-person. Apart from &quot;Mother 3&quot; rhythm and combo battle mechanic, the two game&#x27;s battle systems are similar. &quot;Mother 3&quot; also retains the &quot;rolling HP meter&quot; of &quot;EarthBound&quot; (where health ticks down like an odometer such that players can outrun the meter to heal before dying/fainting) but removes the feature where experience is automatically awarded before battles against much weaker foes. Recurring through the series is its signature &quot;SMAAAASH&quot; text and sound, which show when the player registers a critical hit.

Some characters are present in multiple entries of the series, such as Giygas, Mr. Saturn, and Pokey/Porky. Giygas is the primary antagonist in both &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;EarthBound&quot;. The alien creature&#x27;s emotional complexity deviates from genre norms. Giygas shows internal conflict in &quot;Mother&quot; and has no appearance but as an &quot;indescribable&quot; force in &quot;EarthBound&quot; final boss battle. In both final battles, Giygas is defeated through love and prayer instead of through a tour de force of weaponry, unlike the endings of other period games. Nadia Oxford wrote for IGN that nearly two decades later, &quot;EarthBound&quot; final fight against Giygas continues to be &quot;one of the most epic video game standoffs of all time&quot; with noted emotional impact. This battle&#x27;s dialogue was based on Itoi&#x27;s recollections of a traumatic scene from the Shintoho film &quot;The Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty&quot; that he had accidentally seen in his childhood. Oxford wrote for &quot;1UP.com&quot; that Itoi intended to show the alien&#x27;s yearning for love in &quot;a manner ... beyond human understanding&quot;. Despite &quot;EarthBound&quot; and &quot;Mother 3&quot; dissimilar settings, the Mr. Saturn fictional species appear in similar Saturn Valleys in both games. The Mr. Saturn look like an old man&#x27;s head with feet, a large nose, and bald except for a single hair with a bow. Though they are a technologically advanced and peaceful species with a pureness of heart, they are under constant attacks from encroaching enemies. Nadia and David Oxford of &quot;1UP.com&quot; considered the Mr. Saturn to be aliens despite their human-like and fleshy appearance, as described a piece arguing the central theme of aliens in the &quot;Mother&quot; series. They compared the Mr. Saturn to Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s Tralfamadorian alien species. Finally, Pokey begins as Ness&#x27;s child neighbor who &quot;cowers&quot; and &quot;refuses to fight&quot; in &quot;EarthBound&quot;, but grows into a &quot;vicious control freak with no regard for human life&quot;, Porky, by the end of the series&#x27; &quot;Mother 3&quot;.

=== Music ===

The soundtracks for &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;EarthBound&quot; were composed by Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka. The &quot;Mother&quot; soundtrack was likened by &quot;RPGFan&quot; reviewer Patrick Gann to compositions by the Beatles and for children&#x27;s television shows. He found the lyrics &quot;cheesy and trite&quot; but appreciated the &quot;simple statements&quot; in &quot;Eight Melodies&quot; and the &quot;quirky and wonderful&quot; &quot;Magicant&quot;. The &quot;Mother&quot; soundtrack contains several tracks later used in subsequent series games. When Suzuki and Tanaka were unavailable to commit to &quot;Mother 3&quot; soundtrack, Itoi chose Shogo Sakai for his experience with and understanding of the series. Sakai worked to make the music feel similar to previous entries in the series. Kyle Miller of &quot;RPGFan&quot; wrote that the game retained the quirkiness of the previous soundtracks in the series despite the change in composers. He felt that the second half of the album, which included reinterpreted &quot;classics&quot; from the series, to be its strongest. RPGamer&#x27;s Jordan Jackson too found that the music was &quot;just as catchy as previous games&quot; despite being &quot;almost completely new&quot;. Luke Plunkett of &quot;Kotaku&quot; credited Suzuki&#x27;s background outside of games composition as a rock star and film scorer for making the music of &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;EarthBound&quot; &quot;so distinct and memorable&quot; as &quot;a synthesized tribute to 20th-century pop music&quot;.

== Development ==
=== &quot;Mother&quot; ===

While visiting Nintendo for other work, celebrity copywriter Shigesato Itoi pitched to the company&#x27;s lead designer, Shigeru Miyamoto, his idea for a role-playing game set in modern times. The contemporary setting worked against role-playing genre norms, and while Miyamoto liked the idea, he was hesitant until Itoi could show full commitment to the project. Itoi reduced his workload, formed a team, and began development in Ichikawa, Chiba. Nintendo tried to accommodate Itoi&#x27;s ideal work environment to feel more like an extracurricular club of volunteers. Itoi wrote the game&#x27;s script. The game, titled &quot;Mother&quot;, was developed by Ape, published by Nintendo, and released in Japan on July 27, 1989, for the Famicom (known as the Nintendo Entertainment System outside Japan). The game was slated for an English-language localization as &quot;Earth Bound&quot;, but was abandoned when Nintendo chose to focus on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System instead. Years later, the complete localization was recovered by the public and distributed on the Internet, where it became known as &quot;EarthBound Zero&quot;. &quot;Mother&quot; received its English language debut in June 2015 as &quot;EarthBound Beginnings&quot; for the Wii U Virtual Console.

&quot;Mother&quot; is a single-player role-playing video game set in a &quot;slightly offbeat&quot;, late 20th-century United States (as interpreted by Itoi). Unlike its Japanese role-playing game contemporaries, &quot;Mother&quot; is not set in a fantasy genre. The player fights in warehouses and laboratories instead of in dungeons and similar fantasy settings, and battles are fought with baseball bats and psychic abilities instead of swords and magic. &quot;Mother&quot; follows the young Ninten as he uses psychic powers to fight hostile, formerly inanimate objects and other enemies. The game uses random encounters to enter a menu-based, first-person perspective battle system.

=== &quot;EarthBound&quot; ===
&quot;Mother 2&quot; was made with a development team different from that of the original game, and most of its members were unmarried and willing to work through nights on the project. Itoi again wrote the game&#x27;s script and served as a designer. The game&#x27;s five-year development exceeded time estimates and came under repeated threat of cancellation. It was in dire straits until producer Satoru Iwata joined the team. &quot;Mother 2&quot; was developed by Ape and HAL, published by Nintendo, and released in Japan&#x27;s Super Famicom on August 27, 1994. The game was translated into English for North American audiences whereupon it became the only &quot;Mother&quot; series game to be released in North America until the later localization of &quot;Mother&quot; as &quot;EarthBound Beginnings&quot;. The localizers were given liberties to translate the Japanese script&#x27;s cultural allusions to Western audiences as they pleased, and symbolism was also modified between the versions to adapt to Western sensitivities. To avoid confusion about the series&#x27; numbering, its English title was changed to &quot;EarthBound&quot;, and was released on June 5, 1995, for the North American Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

Although Nintendo spent about $2 million on marketing, the American release was ultimately viewed as unsuccessful within Nintendo. &quot;EarthBound&quot; was released when role-playing games were not popular in the United States, and visual taste in role-playing games was closer to &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. &quot;EarthBound&quot;″s atypical &quot;this game stinks&quot; marketing campaign was derived from the game&#x27;s unusual humor and included foul-smelling scratch and sniff advertisements. &quot;1UP.com&quot; called the campaign &quot;infamously ill-conceived&quot;. Between the poor sales and the dwindling support for the Super NES, the game did not receive a European release.

The &quot;Mother&quot; series titles are built on what Itoi considered &quot;reckless wildness&quot;, where he would offer ideas that encouraged his staff to contribute new ways of portraying scenes in the video game medium. He saw the titles foremost as games and not &quot;big scenario scripts&quot;. Itoi has said that he wanted the player feel emotions such as &quot;distraught&quot; when playing the game. The game&#x27;s writing was intentionally &quot;quirky and goofy&quot; in character, and written in the Japanese kana script so as to give dialogue a conversational feel. Itoi thought of the default player-character names when he did not like his team&#x27;s suggestions. Many of the characters were based on real-life personalities. Itoi sought to make the game appeal to populations that played games less, such as girls.

&quot;Earthbound&quot;&#x27;s story is a continuation of &quot;Mother&quot;&#x27;s, featuring many of the same antagonists and monsters. By default, the player starts as a young boy named Ness, who finds that the alien force Giygas ( ) has enveloped the world in hatred and consequently turned animals, humans, and objects into malicious creatures. Buzz Buzz, a bee from the future, instructs Ness to collect melodies in a Sound Stone to preemptively stop the force. While visiting the eight Sanctuaries where the melodies are held, Ness meets three other kids named Paula, Jeff, and Poo—&quot;a psychic girl, an eccentric inventor, and a ponytailed martial artist&quot;, respectively—who join his party. Along the way, Ness encounters the cultists of Happy Happy Village, the zombie-infested Threed, the Winters boarding school, and the kingdom of Dalaam. When the Sound Stone is filled, Ness visits Magicant alone, a surreal location in his mind where he fights his dark side. Upon returning to Eagleland, he prepares to travel back in time to fight Giygas in a battle known for its &quot;feeling of isolation, ... incomprehensible attacks, ... buzzing static&quot; and reliance on prayer.

&quot;EarthBound&quot; plays as a Japanese role-playing game modeled on &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. The game is characterized by its contemporary, satirical Western world setting and its unconventional characters, enemies, and humor. Examples of the game&#x27;s humor include untraditional enemies such as &quot;New Age Retro Hippie&quot; and &quot;Unassuming Local Guy&quot;, snide dialogue, frequent puns, and fourth wall-breaking. The game also plays self-aware pranks on the player, such as the existence of the useless ruler and protractor items that players and enemies can unsuccessfully try to use nonetheless.

=== &quot;Mother 3&quot; ===

In 1996, &quot;Mother 3&quot; (&quot;EarthBound 64&quot; in North America), was announced. It was slated for release on the 64DD, a disk drive expansion peripheral for the Nintendo 64. Itoi&#x27;s expansive ideas during development led the development team to question whether fans would still consider the game part of the series. The game entered development hell and struggled to find a firm release date and in 2000, despite its level of completion, was later cancelled altogether with the commercial failure of the 64DD.

The project was reannounced three years later as &quot;Mother 3&quot; for the Game Boy Advance alongside a combined &quot;Mother 1 + 2&quot; cartridge for the same handheld console. Itoi had been working on porting &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;Mother 2&quot; to the Game Boy Advance, and based on encouragement what he predicted to be further pressure, decided to release &quot;Mother 3&quot;. The new &quot;Mother 3&quot; abandoned the Nintendo 64 version&#x27;s 3D graphics, but kept its plot. The game was developed by Brownie Brown and HAL Laboratory, published by Nintendo, and released in Japan on April 20, 2006, whereupon it became a bestseller. It did not receive a North American release on the basis that it would not sell.

&quot;&quot; was released in Japan on June 20, 2003. The combined cartridge contains both &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;EarthBound&quot;. &quot;Mother&quot; uses the extended ending of the unreleased English language prototype, but is still only presented in Japanese.

Unlike earlier games in the series, &quot;Mother 3&quot; is presented in chapters. When the Pig Mask Army starts a forest fire and imposes police state-like conditions on a &quot;pastoral forest village&quot;, a father, Flint, ventures out to protect his family (twin sons Lucas and Claus and wife Hinawa), but the rest of the world is eventually implicated in the plot. Lucas, the game&#x27;s hero, does not become prominent until the fourth chapter. Along with his dog, a neophyte thief, and a princess, Lucas fulfills a prophecy of a &quot;chosen one&quot; pulling Needles from the Earth to wake a sleeping dragon and determine the fate of the world. The game features a lighthearted plot, with characters such as &quot;partying ghosts&quot; and &quot;talking rope snakes&quot;.

&quot;Mother 3&quot;, much like its predecessors, is a single-player role-playing video game played with two buttons: one for starting conversations and checking adjacent objects, and another for running. The game updates the turn-based &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;-style battle system with a &quot;rhythm-action mechanic&quot;, which lets the player take additional turns to attack the enemy by chaining together up to sixteen taps in time with the background music. Apart from this, the battle system and &quot;rolling HP meter&quot; (where health ticks down like an odometer such that players can outrun the meter to heal before dying) are similar to &quot;EarthBound&quot;.

=== Future of the series ===
Around &quot;Mother 3&quot; 2006 release, Itoi stated that he had no plans to make &quot;Mother 4&quot;, which he has reaffirmed repeatedly. Itoi has said that, of the three, he had the strongest drive to create the first &quot;Mother&quot; video game, and that it was made for the players. He made the second game as an exploration of his personal interests, and wanted to run wild with the third. While reflecting on &quot;Mother 3&quot; 2000 cancellation, Itoi recounted the great efforts the team made to tell small parts of the story, and felt this was a core theme in the series&#x27; development.

In the absence of continued support for the series, an &quot;EarthBound&quot; fan community coalesced at Starmen.net with the intent to have Nintendo of America acknowledge their interest in &quot;Mother&quot; series. They drafted petitions for English language releases and created a full-color, 270-page anthology of fan art. Upon &quot;little&quot; response from Nintendo, they localized &quot;Mother 3&quot; by themselves and printed a &quot;professional quality strategy guide&quot; through Fangamer, a video game merchandising site that spun off from Starmen.net. &quot;The Verge&quot; cited the effort as proof of the fan base&#x27;s dedication. Other fan efforts include &quot;EarthBound, USA&quot;, a full-length documentary on Starmen.net and the fan community, and &quot;Oddity&quot;, a fan-produced sequel to the &quot;Mother&quot; series that went into production when Itoi definitively &quot;declared&quot; that he was done with the series.

IGN described the series as neglected by Nintendo in North America, as &quot;Mother 1&quot;, &quot;Mother 1+2&quot;, and &quot;Mother 3&quot; were not released outside Japan. Despite this, Ness&#x27;s recurrence in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series signaled favorable odds for the future of the &quot;Mother&quot; series. IGN and &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; readers anticipated a rerelease of &quot;EarthBound&quot; on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console upon its launch in 2006, but it did not materialize. A Japanese rerelease was announced in 2013 for the Wii U Virtual Console as part of a celebration of the anniversaries of the NES and &quot;Mother 2&quot;. North American and European releases for the same platform followed, with Nintendo president Satoru Iwata crediting fan interest on the company&#x27;s Miiverse social platform. The game was a &quot;top-seller&quot; on the Wii U Virtual Console, and &quot;Kotaku&quot; users and first-time &quot;EarthBound&quot; players had an &quot;overwhelmingly positive&quot; response to the game. Simon Parkin wrote that the game&#x27;s rerelease was a &quot;momentous occasion&quot; as the return of &quot;one of Nintendo&#x27;s few remaining lost classics&quot; after 20 years. In an interview in late November 2015, Shigesato Itoi has once again denied plans to create a &quot;Mother 4&quot;, despite fan feedback.

== Reception ==
In &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;, Christian Donlan wrote that the &quot;Mother&quot; series is a &quot;massive RPG franchise&quot; in Japan comparable to that of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, though it does not enjoy the same popularity in the West. IGN described the series as neglected by Nintendo in North America, which only received one of the three &quot;Mother&quot; releases. Donlan added that the series&#x27; oddities did not lend towards Western popularity. RPGamer&#x27;s Jordan Jackson noted that the series is &quot;known for its wacky sense of humor, originality, and its very young protagonists&quot;, and &quot;Kotaku&quot; Luke Plunkett said that the games were distinct from all other video games in that they stirred &quot;genuine emotion in players beyond ... &#x27;excited&#x27; and &#x27;afraid with a &quot;charming&quot;, &quot;touching&quot;, and &quot;tragic&quot; story, which he credited to its creators&#x27; pedigrees from outside the video game industry.

&quot;Mother&quot; was the sixth best-selling game of 1989 in Japan, where it sold about 400,000 copies. It received a &quot;Silver Hall of Fame&quot; score of 31/40 from Japanese magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot;. Critics noted the game&#x27;s similarities with the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series and its simultaneous &quot;parody&quot; of the genre&#x27;s tropes. They thought the game&#x27;s sequel, &quot;EarthBound&quot;, to be very similar and a better implementation of &quot;Mother&quot; gameplay ideas, overall. Reviewers also noted the game&#x27;s high difficulty level and balance issues. &quot;USgamer&quot; Jeremy Parish said that &quot;Mother&quot; script was &quot;as sharp as &quot;EarthBound&quot;&quot;, but felt that the original&#x27;s game mechanics were subpar, lacking the &quot;rolling HP counter&quot; and non-random encounters for which later entries in the series were known. Parish wrote earlier for &quot;1UP.com&quot; that in comparison to &quot;EarthBound&quot;, &quot;Mother&quot; is &quot;worse in just about every way&quot;, and important less for its actual game and more for the interest it generated in video game emulation and the preservation of unreleased games.

&quot;EarthBound&quot; sold about 440,000 copies worldwide, with approximately 300,000 sold in Japan and about 140,000 in the United States. It originally received little critical praise from the American press, and sold poorly in the United States: around 140,000 copies, as compared to twice as many in Japan. &quot;Kotaku&quot; described &quot;EarthBound&quot; 1995 American release as &quot;a dud&quot; and blamed the low sales on &quot;a bizarre marketing campaign&quot; and graphics &quot;cartoonish&quot; beyond the average taste of players. Multiple reviewers described the game as &quot;original&quot; or &quot;unique&quot; and praised its script&#x27;s range of emotions, humor, cheery and charming ambiance, and &quot;real world&quot; setting, which was seen as an uncommon choice. Since its release, the game&#x27;s English localization has found praise, and later reviewers reported that the game had aged well.

Prior to its release, &quot;Mother 3&quot; was in the &quot;top five most wanted games&quot; of &quot;Famitsu&quot; and at the top of the Japanese preordered game charts. It sold around 200,000 units in its first week of sales in Japan, and was one of Japan&#x27;s top 20 bestselling games for the first half of 2006. In comparison, the 2003 &quot;Mother 1 + 2&quot; rerelease sold around 278,000 copies in Japan in its first year, and a reissue &quot;value selection&quot; of the cartridge sold 106,000 copies in Japan in 2006. &quot;Mother 3&quot; received a &quot;Platinum Hall of Fame&quot; score of 35/40 from &quot;Famitsu&quot;. Reviewers praised its story (even though the game was only available in Japanese) and graphics, and lamented its 1990s role-playing game mechanics. Critics also complimented its music. Jackson said that the game was somewhat easier than the rest of the series and somewhat shorter in length.

== Legacy ==
The series has a legacy as both &quot;one of Japan&#x27;s most beloved&quot; and the video game cognoscenti&#x27;s &quot;sacred cow&quot;, and is known for its long-lasting, resilient fan community. At one point leading up to &quot;Mother 3&quot; release, the series&#x27; &quot;Love Theme&quot; played as music on hold for Japan Post. Similarly, the Eight Melodies theme used throughout the series has been incorporated into Japanese elementary school music classrooms. Donlan of &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot; wrote that &quot;EarthBound&quot; is &quot;name-checked by the video gaming cognoscenti more often than it&#x27;s actually been played&quot;.

Critics consider &quot;EarthBound&quot; a &quot;classic&quot; or &quot;must-play&quot; among video games. The game was included in multiple top 50 games of all time lists, including that of &quot;Famitsu&quot; readers in 2006 and IGN readers in 2005 and 2006. IGN ranks the game 13th in its top 100 SNES games and 26th among all games for its in-game world, which was &quot;distinct and unforgettable&quot; for its take on Americanism, unconventional settings, and 1960s music. And Gamasutra named it one of its 20 &quot;essential&quot; Japanese role-playing games. The rerelease was Justin Haywald of &quot;GameSpot&quot; game of the year, and &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; Virtual Console game of the year. &quot;GameZone&quot; said it &quot;would be a great disservice&quot; to merely call &quot;EarthBound&quot; &quot;a gem&quot;. In the United Kingdom, where &quot;EarthBound&quot; had been previously unreleased, &quot;GamesTM&quot; noted how it had been &quot;anecdotally heralded as a retro classic&quot;. IGN&#x27;s Scott Thompson said the game was &quot;the true definition of a classic&quot;. &quot;Kotaku&quot; wrote that the game was content to make the player &quot;feel lonely&quot;, and, overall, was special not for any individual aspect but for its method of using the video game medium to explore ideas impossible to explore in other media.

Multiple critics wrote that &quot;Mother 3&quot; was one of the best role-playing games for the Game Boy Advance. &quot;GamePro&quot; Jeremy Signor listed it among his &quot;best unreleased Japanese role-playing games&quot; for its script and attention to detail. Video game journalist Tim Rogers posited that &quot;Mother 3&quot; was &quot;the closest games have yet come to literature&quot;. There are no plans for an official &quot;Mother 4&quot;.

The series, and specifically &quot;EarthBound&quot;, is known for having a cult following that developed over time well after its release. Colin Campbell of &quot;Polygon&quot; wrote that &quot;few gaming communities are as passionate and active&quot; as &quot;EarthBound&quot;, and &quot;1UP.com&quot; Bob Mackey wrote that no game was as poised to have a cult following. Starmen.net hosted a &quot;Mother&quot; 25th Anniversary Fanfest in 2014 with a livestream of the game and plans for a remixed soundtrack. Later that year, fans released a 25th Anniversary Edition ROM hack that updated the game&#x27;s graphics, script, and gameplay balance. &quot;The Verge&quot; cited the two-year-long &quot;Mother 3&quot; fan translation as proof of the fan base&#x27;s dedication, and Jenni Lada of &quot;TechnologyTell&quot; called it &quot;undoubtably one of the best known fan translations in existence&quot;, with active retranslations into other languages. Frank Caron of &quot;Ars Technica&quot; said that the fan translation&#x27;s &quot;massive undertaking ... stands as a massive success&quot;, and that &quot;one cannot even begin to fathom&quot; why Nintendo would not release their own English localization.

=== &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; ===
&quot;EarthBound&quot; Ness became widely known due to his later appearance in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. He appeared in the original &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; and its sequels: &quot;Melee&quot;, &quot;Brawl&quot;, &quot;3DS/Wii U&quot;, and &quot;Ultimate&quot;. In Europe, which did not see an original &quot;EarthBound&quot; release, Ness is better known for his role in the fighting game than for his original role in the role-playing game. He returned in the 2001 &quot;Melee&quot; with &quot;EarthBound&quot; Mr. Saturn, which could be thrown at enemies and otherwise pushes items off the battlefield. &quot;Melee&quot; has an unlockable Fourside level based on the &quot;EarthBound&quot; location.

When &quot;Melee&quot; was in development, Ness was not supposed to return as a playable character and would have been replaced by Lucas, the main character of &quot;Mother 3&quot;. However, &quot;Mother 3&quot; original Nintendo 64 release was cancelled, though it was later successfully revived as a project for the Game Boy Advance. As a result, Ness was featured in Melee instead of Lucas.

Ness was later joined by &quot;Mother 3&quot; Lucas in &quot;Brawl&quot;, and both characters returned in &quot;3DS/Wii U&quot; and &quot;Ultimate&quot;. Players can fight in the &quot;3DS&quot; Magicant stage, which features clips from the &quot;Mother&quot; series in its background.

<text>William Kavanaugh Oldham (May 20, 1865 – May 6, 1938) was the Acting Governor of the U.S. state of Arkansas for six days in 1913.

Oldham was born in Richmond, Kentucky and educated at Central University, also in Richmond. He moved to Pettus, Arkansas in Lonoke County in 1885 and became a successful cotton farmer.

He was elected to the Arkansas House of Representatives in 1907. He served as a member of the Arkansas Senate from 1911 to 1913, and was selected as president of the Senate in 1913.

When Governor Joseph Taylor Robinson resigned from office on March 8, 1913, Oldham became acting governor of Arkansas. When the legislative session ended on March 13, the Arkansas Senate elected Junius Marion Futrell as the new president pro tempore, but Oldham refused to agree that Futrell was the new acting governor; the dispute was settled by the Arkansas Supreme Court on March 24, in favor of Futrell.

Oldham retired from public service and returned to farming. He later served as chairman of the state Cotton Reduction Committee.

William K. Oldham died in Pettus, Arkansas and is buried at the Oakland-Fraternal Cemetery in Little Rock, Arkansas.

==Family==
Oldham was the brother-in-law of James Philip Eagle (1837–1904), governor of Arkansas 1889–1893, who married Oldham&#x27;s sister Mary Kavanaugh Oldham in 1882. His younger brother Kie Oldham (1869–1916) served as James Eagle&#x27;s private secretary while he was governor, curated an important collection of documents about Arkansas&#x27; Civil War history, and was a prominent lawyer, working primarily as an advocate for Native American tribes. Kie also served in the Arkansas state senate, in 1907 and 1908–9; in 1907 Kie and William were both in the legislature, representing the same county as representative and senator, respectively.

Oldham married Lillian Munroe (1870–1957) in 1894; they had two children, William Kavanaugh Oldham II (1896–1950) and Lillian Oldham (b. circa 1898).

<doc id="303966" wikidata="Q527052" url="?curid=303966" title="George Murphy">
<text>George Lloyd Murphy (July 4, 1902 – May 3, 1992) was an American actor and politician. Murphy was a song-and-dance leading man in many big-budget Hollywood musicals from 1930 to 1952. He was the president of the Screen Actors Guild from 1944 to 1946, and was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1951. Murphy served from 1965 to 1971 as U.S. Senator from California, the first notable American actor to be elected to statewide office in California, predating Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who each served two terms as governor. He is the only United States Senator represented by a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early life==
Murphy was born in New Haven, Connecticut, of Irish Catholic extraction, the son of Michael Charles &quot;Mike&quot; Murphy, athletic trainer and coach, and the former Nora Long. He was educated at Trinity-Pawling School, Peddie School and Yale University in his native New Haven.

== Career ==

=== Film ===

In movies, Murphy was known as a song-and-dance man and appeared in many big-budget musicals such as &quot;Broadway Melody of 1938&quot; (1937), &quot;Broadway Melody of 1940&quot; (1940) and &quot;For Me and My Gal&quot; (1942). He made his movie debut shortly after talking pictures had replaced silent movies in 1930, and his career continued until he retired as an actor in 1952, at the age of 50. During World War II, he organized entertainment for American troops.

In 1951, he was awarded an honorary Academy Award. He was never nominated for an Oscar in any competitive category. On March 14, 1951, he hosted the first ever Eddie Awards for American Cinema Editors.

He was the president of the Screen Actors Guild from 1944 to 1946. He was also a vice president of Desilu Productions and of the Technicolor Corporation. He was director of entertainment for presidential inaugurations in 1953, 1957 and 1961.

=== United States Senator === 

Murphy entered politics in 1952 by joining the leadership of the California Republican Party, having also directed the entertainment for the Eisenhower-Nixon inauguration that same year.

In 1964, he was elected as a Republican to the Senate, having defeated Pierre Salinger, the former presidential press secretary in the Kennedy White House, who had been appointed several months earlier to serve the remainder of the late Clair Engle&#x27;s unexpired term. Murphy served from January 1, 1965, to January 1, 1971. He took his seat two days early, when Salinger resigned to allow Murphy to gain an edge in seniority; Murphy was then appointed by Democratic Governor Pat Brown to serve the remaining two days of Salinger&#x27;s term. (In turn, Murphy resigned two days before his term expired, extending the same courtesy to his successor.)

Murphy was in demand for a time to assist other Republican candidates seeking office. In 1966, he hosted a fundraising dinner in Atlanta, for U.S. Representative Howard &quot;Bo&quot; Callaway, the first Republican candidate for Governor of Georgia since Reconstruction. In the election, Callaway outpolled Democrat Lester Maddox, but did not get a majority, and the state legislature elected Maddox.

In 1967 and 1968, Murphy was the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. During his Senate term, Murphy developed throat cancer, and part of his larynx had to be removed. For the rest of his life, he was unable to speak above a whisper.

Murphy voted in favor of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as well as the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968.

In 1970, Murphy ran for re-election; he was challenged by Democratic U.S. Representative John V. Tunney, the son of famed heavyweight boxing champion Gene Tunney. Murphy&#x27;s surgery and staunch support for the lingering Vietnam War worked against him, as did reports that he had continued to receive a salary from Technicolor after taking office. Despite Governor Ronald Reagan’s 7% Re-election victory in the concurrent gubernatorial election, Murphy lost his seat to Tunney by a vote of 3,496,558 (54%) to 2,877,617 (44%). Tunney&#x27;s successful Senate race in 1970 was reportedly the inspiration for the 1972 Robert Redford film &quot;The Candidate&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Murphy was married to his ballroom dancing partner, Juliette &quot;Julie&quot; Henkel-Johnson, from December 18, 1926, until her death, in 1973. They had two children: Dennis Michael Murphy and Melissa Elaine Murphy.

He was married to Bette Blandi from 1982 until his death in 1992; she died in 1999.

Murphy subsequently moved to Palm Beach, Florida, where he died at the age of 89, from leukemia.

==Legacy==
Murphy&#x27;s move from the screen to California politics paved the way for the successful transitions of actors such as Ronald Reagan and later Arnold Schwarzenegger. Reagan once famously referred to George Murphy as his own &quot;John the Baptist&quot;.

Fellow Republicans praised Murphy&#x27;s ability to speak at fundraising dinners and so consequently backed his bid to become the chairman of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee.

During his tenure in the Senate, Murphy created the candy desk by placing a supply of confectionery on his desk on the U.S. Senate floor. After 1971, the candy-desk duties were bequeathed to a string of successors; as of 2023, the keeper of the candy desk is Indiana Republican Todd Young.

Murphy was the subject of a song by Tom Lehrer included on his album &quot;That Was the Year That Was&quot; with the same name, which criticized Murphy&#x27;s comments about Mexicans working in the US.

<text>Theodore Joans (July 4, 1928 – April 25, 2003) was an American beatnik, surrealist, painter, filmmaker, collageist, jazz poet and jazz trumpeter who spent long periods of time in Paris while also traveling through Africa. His complex body of work stands at the intersection of several avant-garde artistic streams. He was the author of more than 30 books of poetry, prose, and collage; among them &quot;Black Pow-Wow&quot;, &quot;Beat Funky Jazz Poems&quot;, &quot;Afrodisia&quot;, &quot;Jazz is Our Religion&quot;, &quot;Double Trouble&quot;, &quot;WOW&quot; and &quot;Teducation&quot;. In 2001 he was the recipient of Before Columbus Foundation&#x27;s American Book Awards Lifetime Achievement Award.

In visual art, Joans is best known for creating a more than 30-foot-long chain of drawings and collages on dot matrix printer computer paper called &quot;Long Distance Exquisite Corpse&quot; (1976-2003), an extended exquisite corpse of 132 invited contributors, including Paul Bowles, Breyten Breytenbach, William S. Burroughs, Mário Cesariny, Barbara Chase-Riboud, Bruce Conner, Laura Corsiglia, Bill Dixon, Allen Ginsberg, David Hammons, Stanley William Hayter, Dick Higgins, Konrad Klapheck, Alison Knowles, Michel Leiris, Malangatana, Roberto Matta, Octavio Paz, Larry Rivers, James Rosenquist, Wole Soyinka, Dorothea Tanning and Cecil Taylor. 

Joans&#x27;s motto was: &quot;Jazz is my religion and Surrealism my point of view&quot;. 

==Biography==
Joans was born in Cairo, Illinois, as Theodore Jones. His parents worked on the riverboats that plied the Ohio River and the Mississippi River. He played the trumpet and was an avid jazz aficionado, following Bop as it developed, and continued to espouse jazz of all styles and eras throughout his life. Growing up in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Louisville, Kentucky, he earned a degree in fine arts from Indiana University where he encountered and translated Andre Breton’s 1924 &quot;Surrealist Manifesto&quot; by using a French dictionary before moving in 1951 to New York City, changing his surname from Jones to Joans and entering the bohemian artistic scene. Joans became friends with Beat Generation writer Jack Kerouac and, for a while, was a room mate with the jazz musician Charlie Parker. During that time Joans painted in a rather Abstract Expressionist style he called &quot;Jazz Action Painting&quot; and he wrote and read his poetry, developing a personal style of oral delivery he called &quot;Jazz Poetry&quot;. He became a participant in the Beat Generation scene in Greenwich Village and was a contemporary and friend of Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Leroi Jones (later known as Amiri Baraka), Gregory Corso, Diane Di Prima, Bob Kaufman, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, among many others. Joans&#x27; bohemian costume balls and rent parties became rather well known, as they were photographed by Fred McDarrah and Weegee. 

Choosing to lead an increasingly expatriate artist&#x27;s life, Joans became involved in the intelligentsia around the Surrealism art movement after meeting Joseph Cornell and later becoming close to his childhood painter-hero Salvador Dalí in Paris before breaking with him. Joans had moved to Paris in the 1960s and was welcomed into the Surrealist circle of André Breton and by James Baldwin. He learned the French language and frequented the café Les Deux Magots in Saint Germain des Prés where he received mail and other messages. He remained mostly in Paris until the mid-1990s, spending his summers in Europe and winters in Timbuktu in Mali. Joans also became active in African studies and traveled extensively throughout the African continent, frequently on foot, over many decades between periods of living in Europe and North America. As publisher John Calder noted, &quot;Joans adapted himself to the lifestyles of artists in Harlem and Greenwich Village, the London of the 1950s and 60s, the Paris of the 60s to the 90s, as well as to those of other European cities and Timbuktu, where he spent many winters.&quot; From the 1960s onward, Joans had a house in Tangier, Morocco, and then in Timbuktu. While he ceased playing the trumpet, he maintained a jazz sensibility in the reading of his poems and frequently collaborated with musicians. He continued to travel and maintained an active correspondence with a host of creative individuals, among them Langston Hughes, Michel Leiris, Aimé Césaire, Robert Creeley, Jake Lamar, James Baldwin, Jayne Cortez, Stokely Carmichael, Ishmael Reed, Paul Bowles, Franklin and Penelope Rosemont. Many letters between Joans and these and others are collected at the Bancroft Library of the University of California Berkeley, while the University of Delaware houses his correspondence with Charles Henri Ford. Joans was also a close correspondent/participant of the Chicago Surrealist Group.

Joans&#x27; painting &quot;Bird Lives&quot; hangs in the De Young Museum in San Francisco. He was also the originator of the &quot;Bird Lives&quot; urban legend and graffiti street art in and about New York City after the death of Charlie Parker in 1955. Joans visual art work spans Max Ernst-like collages, assemblage, paintings and drawings; including many resulting from the collaborative surrealist game of Cadavre Exquis. The rhinoceros is a frequent subject in his work. He also created short Super 8 films.

Joans often satirized American middle-class values in poems such as &quot;Playmates&quot;. A strong and cruel humorous streak is apparent in his work when depicting the white bourgeoisie and their philistine attitudes, particularly around racial prejudice. His poems and art often explored social/racial issues from the perspective of his experiences of a black minority member within a white majority society. During the early 1980s, he was a writer in residence in Berlin under the auspices of the DAAD (Deutsche Akademische Austauschdienst) program. He also was a contributor of jazz essays and reviews to magazines such as &quot;Coda&quot; and &quot;Jazz Magazine&quot;. His autobiographical text &quot;Je Me Vois&quot; appeared in the &quot;Contemporary Authors Autobiographical Series&quot;, Volume 25, published by Gale Research. 

His work has been included in numerous anthologies, including &quot;The Poetry of the Negro, 1746–1970&quot; (1970), edited by Langston Hughes and Arna Bontemps (1970), &quot;A Broadside Treasury&quot;, edited by Gwendolyn Brooks (1971), and &quot;For Malcolm&quot;, edited by Dudley Randall and Margaret Taylor Goss Burroughs (1973). More recent publications on Joans include the anthology &quot;Teducation&quot; and &quot;Our Thang&quot;, a collection of his poems and paintings by his friend Laura Corsiglia.

In the late 1990s Joans relocated from Europe to Seattle before moving to Vancouver, British Columbia, between travels, until his death. Joans died in Vancouver, due to complications from diabetes. He fathered 10 children: Daline Jones-Weber of San Leandro (named after Salvador Dalí), Ted Jones of Santa Monica, Teresa Jordan of Whittier, JeanneMarie Jones of Rialto, Robert Jones of Long Beach, Lars Jones of Oslo, Norway, Thor Jones of Oslo, Norway, Russell Jones of Scotland, Sylvia Jones and Yvette Jones-Johnson.

<doc id="303977" wikidata="Q12059382" url="?curid=303977" title="Half sovereign">
<text>The half sovereign is a British gold coin denominated at one-half of a pound sterling. First issued in its present form in 1817, it has been struck by the Royal Mint in most years since 1980 as a collector&#x27;s and bullion piece.

The half sovereign was originally introduced in 1544 during the reign of Henry VIII but the issue was discontinued after 1604. In 1817, as part of the Great Recoinage, half sovereigns and sovereigns were reintroduced. Until it was discontinued as a currency coin in 1926, the half sovereign was struck in most years and circulated widely. In addition to being coined in London, it was struck at the colonial mints in Australia and South Africa. Exacting standards made it difficult to strike, and it was considered for elimination in the 1880s despite its popularity.

Production of half sovereigns continued until 1926 and, apart from special issues for coronation years, was suspended until 1980. Since then it has been struck for sale by the Royal Mint, although it does not circulate. In addition to the portrait of the reigning monarch, the coin features in most years an image of Saint George and the dragon, designed by Benedetto Pistrucci, first used on the sovereign in 1817 and the half-sovereign in 1893.

== English coin (1544–1604) ==

Henry VII () revitalised England&#x27;s economy following the War of the Roses. In 1489, he introduced the sovereign gold coin, which he valued at twenty shillings. Before the new denomination, the only gold coins being issued were angels and half angels.

Henry VII left a large treasury – the modern equivalent of about £375 million – to his successor Henry VIII (). The inherited wealth was dissipated due to Henry VIII&#x27;s extravagant lifestyle and the war expenses needed to maintain a claim over France. These expenses led to the repeated debasement of the currency over the younger Henry&#x27;s reign.
The half sovereign was introduced as part of Henry&#x27;s third issue of coins, in 1544, debasing the coinage still further. The coin depicts a crowned King Henry sitting in his chair of state, holding his orb and sceptre on the obverse, while the reverse features a royal shield containing the arms of France and England, supported by a lion and a dragon. Henry&#x27;s titles as king surround the designs on both sides, and HR (Henricus Rex, or Henry the King) appears at the bottom of the reverse design.

The new coin continued to be struck in the reign of Henry&#x27;s son and successor, Edward VI (), initially with the designs of the previous reign, and later with a depiction of Edward seated in the chair of state.

The half sovereign was struck again under James I ( in England) beginning in 1603, and features a portrait of the king on the obverse, and a crowned shield on the reverse. The shield of arms featured on James I&#x27;s coinage features the lions of England in the first quarter, that of Scotland in the second, the harp of Ireland in the third quarter and the fleurs-de-lis of France in the fourth. The legend on the coin proclaims James king of England, Scotland, Ireland and France, while the reverse legend reads &quot;EXVRGAT DEVS DISSIPENTVR INIMICI&quot; which translates as &quot;Let God arise and let His enemies be scattered&quot; from Psalms 68:1. The letters I and R, for IACOBIS REX (James the King) flank the shield. These half sovereigns were only issued in very small numbers. In 1604, James I reduced the weight of gold coinage, and renamed sovereigns and half sovereigns as unites and half unites, in honour of his uniting the two kingdoms on the island of Great Britain. The renamed half sovereign was thereafter replaced by the half guinea.

==British coin (1817 to present)==
=== Origin===

During the Napoleonic Wars, large amounts of gold left Britain, and worn guineas and bank notes were used for currency. After the final defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo (1815), Parliament, by the Coinage Act 1816, placed Britain officially on the gold standard, with the pound to be defined as a given quantity of gold. Almost every speaker in the parliamentary debate supported having a coin valued at twenty shillings, rather than continuing to use the guinea, valued at twenty-one shillings. One reason for the introduction of gold coinage based on the sovereign was that its value, equal to one pound sterling, was more convenient than the guinea. Nevertheless, the Coinage Act did not specify which coins the Mint should strike.

A committee of the Privy Council recommended gold coins of ten shillings, twenty shillings, two pounds and five pounds be issued, and this was accepted by George, Prince Regent on 3August 1816. The twenty-shilling piece was named a sovereign, with the resurrection of the old name possibly promoted by antiquarians with numismatic interests. The modern sovereign featuring the well-known design by the Italian sculptor, Benedetto Pistrucci, of St George slaying the dragon was proclaimed as currency in 1817, and minting commenced later that year. The new half sovereign instead bore a reverse design depicting a shield, engraved by William Wyon, possibly based on a design by Pistrucci, though the numismatic scholar, Howard Linecar, stated that Wyon was also responsible for the modelling.

The shield was a new version of the royal arms, bearing the quartered arms of England, Scotland and Ireland, with the Hanoverian arms surmounted by a royal crown. The kings of Britain also ruled Hanover between 1714 and 1837; the arms of Hanover depicted the armorial bearings of Brunswick, Lüneburg and Celle. According to the Royal Mint&#x27;s historian, Kevin Clancy, in his book on the sovereign&#x27;s history: 
The half sovereign, proclaimed legal tender on 10 October 1817, became the smallest gold coin in regular use. The first issues of the half sovereign, depicting the bust of George III (), were issued dated 1817, 1818 and 1820, with none dated 1819, a year in which few sovereigns were struck. Few gold coins were issued in 1819 because of a proposal that gold should be retained in the Bank of England and only issued in ingots worth £233, a plan which did not succeed.

=== 1820–1837 ===
The first type of half sovereign minted during the reign of George IV () features his portrait engraved by Pistrucci wearing a laurel wreath on the obverse and an ornately garnished crowned shield on the reverse which was designed by Jean Baptiste Merlen. This initial reverse, issued in 1821, was quickly withdrawn due to its similarity in size and appearance to the sixpence, meaning that the sixpence could more easily be gilded and passed off as a half sovereign.

The next time the half sovereign was struck, in 1823, it featured a plainer version of the shield on the reverse, designed by Merlen, and Pistrucci&#x27;s portrait of George. This version was also struck in 1824 and 1825. The king was dissatisfied with his portrayal, and Pistrucci&#x27;s bust design was replaced beginning with some 1825 coins with an engraving by Wyon, based on a work by Francis Chantrey. Pistrucci had refused to copy Chantrey&#x27;s work, and he had no further involvement with designing coinage. Changes were made to the reverse, which was given a more ornate version of the shield, and this was struck every year through 1829. The half sovereigns struck in 1829 were probably dated 1828, but one 1829 half sovereign is known, in the collection of the Ashmolean Museum. This was one of several coins struck by the Royal Mint in 1891 from original dies to supply the Bodleian Library with pieces to fill gaps in its collection. The George and dragon reverse vanished after 1825 from the sovereign, not to be seen again on it until 1871.

Half sovereigns were not issued for circulation during the reign of William IV () until 1834, though proof coins were issued in 1831. They were issued as well in 1835, 1836 and 1837. The obverse features a barehead bust of William IV, which was engraved by William Wyon from a model by Chantrey. The reverse is similar to the later George IV issues, with a crowned shield and mantle on the reverse which was modelled and engraved by Merlen. The 1834 issue had a reduced diameter, 17.9 mm (most half sovereigns measure 19.4 mm in diameter), though no change was made to the weight or fineness. It is possible that the diameter was reduced so that tools and dies for the Maundy fourpence could be used for the half sovereign. Mint ledgers from this reign record that £60,000 or 120,000 half sovereigns dated 1834 were recalled due to their similarity to the discontinued seven shilling or third guinea pieces. Some 1836 and 1837 half sovereigns are known with a slightly different obverse, apparently taken from the obverse dies for the sixpence. This may have been due to an error by the Royal Mint. It being a common fraud to gild a sixpence to pass it as a half sovereign, beginning in William&#x27;s reign, the sixpence carried a statement of its value.

=== Victoria (1837–1901) ===
Queen Victoria came to the throne in 1837 and reigned until 1901; the first half sovereigns of her reign were issued in 1838. The first series of Victorian half sovereigns (1838 to 1886) feature William Wyon&#x27;s portrait of a youthful Victoria on the obverse, and a shield reverse by Merlen with the Hanoverian arms omitted as Victoria, as a woman, could not become the monarch of Hanover. Struck at the Royal Mint in London every year from 1838 to 1885, excepting 1881 and 1882 (the mint was under renovation in the latter year), there are a number of variations over time generally dealing with the size of Victoria&#x27;s head, the position and size of the legends and date on the coin, and whether a die number (used by the Royal Mint to track die wear) is included on the reverse. Some variations were intentionally introduced by the Royal Mint, according to Sir John Craig in his history of it, &quot;to titillate the numismatists&quot;.

Gold was discovered in Australia in 1851, leading to requests from colonial officials that a branch of the Royal Mint be established there. After the Sydney Mint opened in 1855, half sovereigns were struck beginning in 1855. Half sovereigns struck at Sydney from 1855 to 1866 were not of the same design as struck in London, but, as the Royal Mint feared that they would not be struck to the same standard, stated their origin at the Sydney Mint as part of the design, and were not legal tender in Britain. Dies for these issues were prepared at London. As trust grew, the Australian coins were accepted as legal tender, and, beginning in 1871, Sydney used the same shield design as did London. The Melbourne Mint opened in 1873, and struck half sovereigns the same year. The Perth Mint opened in 1899, and first struck half sovereigns in 1900. The colonial mints used dies prepared in London and transported by ship, which included mint marks on the reverse for the issues that were otherwise identical to those struck in London: S for Sydney, M for Melbourne and P for Perth. In addition to the series struck whilst a branch of the Royal Mint, the modern Perth Mint has struck half sovereigns (with face value A$15) using the early Australian design, though with an inscription denoting their origin at the Perth Mint.

Despite the fact that the half sovereign saw more use in circulation than the sovereign, in the 1880s, there were efforts to abolish it and replace it with silver coinage. While the sovereign was a world-wide trade coin, the half sovereign stayed mostly in Britain, and had to be struck to exacting standards, which resulted in 45 per cent of newly-struck half sovereigns being melted at the mint. This made it expensive to coin, the more so because the government did not profit from seignorage on gold coinage, as it did on silver coinage, and so the government discouraged the use of the half sovereign. In 1884, the Gladstone government proposed to reduce the gold content of the half sovereign by a tenth; though this effort failed, a later chancellor of the exchequer, Lord Randolph Churchill, described the half sovereign as &quot;that profligate little coin&quot;. Nevertheless Sir Charles Fremantle, deputy master of the mint, stated in 1874 that the half sovereign was the most convenient part of the change given for a sovereign.
The efforts to use silver in place of gold resulted in the 1887 introduction of the double florin, but that coin lasted only four years. Also in 1887, a new obverse was given to the silver and gold coinage, including the half sovereign. The coins were introduced in the year of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee and dubbed the Jubilee coinage; the obverse was designed by Joseph Boehm. The reverse featured another version of the shield (the ensigns armorial of the United Kingdom), this one garnished and surmounted by a crown. The reverse design was engraved by Leonard Charles Wyon. The sixpence of the Jubilee coinage bore no written denomination and was the same size as (and resembled) the half sovereign; amid a flurry of fraud from those who gilded it, the new sixpence had to be withdrawn.

Churchill&#x27;s successor as chancellor, George Goschen, was slow to decide whether to discontinue the half sovereign, and eventually decided against it. Nevertheless, Goschen was no supporter of the half sovereign, and none were struck at the Royal Mint&#x27;s facility at Tower Hill between June 1887 and February 1890. No half sovereigns were struck at any mint in 1888, and only Sydney struck them in 1889. In February 1890, Goschen, in his budget statement, took pride in having temporarily curtailed what he described as &quot;the most expensive coin in the world&quot;.

Boehm&#x27;s obverse design showing Victoria wearing a crown that was deemed undersized proved controversial, and the Royal Mint was determined to replace it as soon as possible. An advisory committee on the design of coins was appointed, which recommended using Pistrucci&#x27;s George and Dragon design for the sovereign on the half sovereign. For the obverse, a new design depicting a veiled bust of Victoria by Thomas Brock was used. First used in 1893, coins bearing it have become known as the Old Head coinage. Pistrucci&#x27;s initials, BP, are not found on the Old Head half sovereign; Richard Lobel, in &quot;Coincraft&#x27;s Standard Catalogue of English and UK Coins&quot;, commented, &quot;how the egotistical Italian, who spelled his name in full on the 1818 crown, would have hated that!&quot; Half sovereigns with Brock&#x27;s obverse and the Pistrucci reverse continued to be struck until 1901, the year of the queen&#x27;s death.

=== 1902–1953===
The first half sovereigns during Edward VII&#x27;s reign () were issued in 1902 and the series continued until 1910. The coin features a bare head bust of Edward VII by George William de Saulles on the obverse and the George and dragon reverse. Coins were minted in London, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. The initial reverse was modified during 1904 to restore Pistrucci&#x27;s initials to his design and make slight modifications elsewhere. Half sovereigns dated 1904 with the original design were struck at London and Perth; the modified version, with initials, was used at all four mints during that year. Beginning in 1908, the Ottawa branch of the Royal Mint (later the Royal Canadian Mint) struck sovereigns as it was obliged to do on request as a branch of the Royal Mint, mostly for export. Sovereigns and half sovereigns, though legal tender in Canada, did not circulate much. There were no strikings of half sovereigns at Ottawa.
After Edward&#x27;s death in 1910, half sovereigns featuring the new king, George V (), with an obverse designed by Bertram Mackennal and the Pistrucci reverse, were first issued in 1911 and continued until 1915 at London. The final years before the start of the First World War in 1914 saw large circulation of sovereigns and half sovereigns, and during the final days of the July Crisis that led up to war, many members of the public exchanged banknotes for gold. Once war began, paper currency of ten shillings and of one pound were quickly issued to take the place of the two gold coins, and although there was no formal suspension of gold payments, the government promoted the view that to ask for payment in gold was unpatriotic. Nevertheless, production of gold coins at the colonial mints continued, mostly for export. Production of half sovereigns at Australian mints continued until 1920, though only a few were struck after 1916, all at Perth.

The 1918-P half sovereign is unusual because there was no record of half sovereigns being struck in Perth that year, and they were most likely produced in 1919 and 1920, and then exported to an uncertain fate, as relatively few are known. There were coinages at Pretoria (mint mark SA), the only half sovereign issues from there, in 1923, 1925 and 1926. Although the 1923-SA was a proof-only issue, the Pretoria Mint produced the 1925 and 1926 issues for local circulation as mine owners insisted on paying workers in gold. These issues bearing the portrait of George V were the last half sovereigns struck for circulation.

The half sovereign was not included in the sets of pattern coins prepared in 1936 for the reign of Edward VIII (), unlike the sovereign, double sovereign and five-pound piece, for which pattern coins exist. Half sovereigns bearing a bare head bust of George VI () by Humphrey Paget on the obverse and the St George reverse, were struck in 1937 with a plain edge as part of the tradition to strike all denominations as part of a proof set in a new monarch&#x27;s coronation year. They were struck again for that purpose for George&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth II (), with a portrait by Mary Gillick, in Elizabeth&#x27;s coronation year of 1953, but these were not for public sale, only for the royal and national collections. Use of Pistrucci&#x27;s design continued on the reverse.

=== Collector and bullion coin (since 1980) ===

Although it no longer circulated, the sovereign had been issued as a bullion coin beginning in 1957, and with special-quality proof coins issued from 1979. The Royal Mint realised there was a market for sovereign coins and began to sell them to collectors at well over face or bullion value. In 1980, the first Elizabeth II half sovereigns available to the public were issued, in proof quality, and in 1982, the first half sovereigns sold as bullion coins. Both issues carried the second coinage portrait of Elizabeth II, by Arnold Machin on their obverses, with the Pistrucci design as the reverse. Proof half sovereigns with the Machin obverse were also struck dated 1983 and 1984.

From 1985 to 1997, except in 1989, half sovereigns in proof condition with the third coinage portrait of Elizabeth, by Raphael Maklouf, were struck. Many of these were issued in four-piece gold proof sets with the sovereign, double sovereign and five-pound piece. In 1989, a special design by Bernard Sindall for the 500th anniversary of the sovereign coin was struck in all four denominations. Sindall adapted a design showing an enthroned Queen Elizabeth II that he had originally proposed for the Silver Jubilee crown of 1977 for the obverse, and placed a crowned shield atop a double rose for the reverse.

The fourth coinage portrait of Elizabeth, by Ian Rank-Broadley, appeared on half sovereigns from 1998 to 2015. The coins were initially only in proof, but from 2000, were also made available as bullion coins. Special designs for the reverse were substituted for Pistrucci&#x27;s for Elizabeth II&#x27;s Golden Jubilee in 2002 (by Timothy Noad, depicting a crowned shield within a wreath), in 2005 (a more modern interpretation of the George and dragon, also by Noad), and in 2012 for Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee (another modern interpretation of the George and dragon, by Paul Day). In 2009, in conjunction with an attempt to restore Pistrucci&#x27;s design for the sovereign as closely as possible to what he originally intended, the half sovereign was modified to resemble what it had looked like when the George and dragon was first placed on the coin in 1893. This entailed the loss of Pistrucci&#x27;s initials, which remained absent in 2010 but were restored in 2011. Sovereigns which are legal tender in Britain were produced in India with the permission of the Royal Mint from 2013 with mint mark I; half sovereigns were struck there in 2014.

Beginning with some proof 2015 issues, and continuing with bullion issues in 2016, the fifth coinage portrait of Elizabeth II, by Jody Clark was substituted on the half sovereign&#x27;s obverse. Proof half sovereigns dated 2016 featured an obverse with a different portrait of Queen Elizabeth by James Butler in honour of the queen&#x27;s 90th birthday. For the 200th anniversary of the modern sovereign in 2017, proof half sovereigns featured a design evocative of the 1817 sovereign, with Pistrucci&#x27;s design contained within a Garter, and bullion issues bore a privy mark with the number 200 marking the anniversary.

In 2022, the Royal Mint struck half sovereigns with a reverse design by Noad showing an interpretation of the Royal Arms. This design, used for the sovereign and its multiples and fractions, was to mark the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II. Later in the year, following the death of Elizabeth II, the Royal Mint issued memorial coins in the sovereign range, including the half sovereign, featuring an interpretation of the Royal Arms by Clark as the reverse, and for the obverse, the first coinage portrait of Elizabeth&#x27;s successor, Charles III (), by Martin Jennings. Half sovereigns were issued in 2023, marking the coronation of Charles III, with a crowned bust of the king by Jennings on the obverse and with the Pistrucci design on the reverse. For 2024, Jennings&#x27; uncrowned portrait of Charles was paired with Pistrucci&#x27;s reverse on each of the five sovereign denominations struck in proof, from the quarter sovereign to the five-pound piece. For 2025, Pistrucci&#x27;s reverse was used on some coins, with others featuring Jean Baptiste Merlen&#x27;s Royal Arms reverse, first used on the sovereign in 1825, for its 200th anniversary.

<doc id="303984" wikidata="Q1420541" url="?curid=303984" title="X-No-Archive">
<text>X-No-Archive, also known colloquially as xna, is a newsgroup message header field used to prevent a Usenet message from being archived in various servers.

==Origin==
The need for X-No-Archive began when DejaNews debuted in 1995. DejaNews was the first large-scale commercial attempt to archive the Usenet news feed, and several newsgroup participants were concerned about privacy rights and about the possibility that their messages could be re-posted through DejaNews in the future. DejaNews addressed these concerns by announcing that it would not archive Usenet messages containing the X-No-Archive header field.

==How it works==
X-No-Archive was designed to follow the standard message header protocol, RFC 1036 and RFC 977, used in existing newsgroups. In addition to the standard header fields used in all newsgroup messages (including &quot;Path:, From:, Subject:,&quot; and &quot;Date:&quot;), news reader software allows a user to add optional fields to a header. According to RFC 822, these additional fields are prefixed with the label X- so that they can be ignored by news servers and newsreaders. The phrase &quot;No Archive&quot; was coined as a way to state &quot;Do not archive this message,&quot; and the X- prefix was added to complete the term &quot;X-No-Archive.&quot;

The proper field to prevent a message from being archived is: X-No-Archive: Yes (abbreviated as &quot;XNAY&quot;).

Some software systems also do not archive if the first line in the body of the message contains this text. This is useful for those users who cannot change the header of messages they send out. If the X-No-Archive field is set to &quot;No&quot;, or the field is absent, a Usenet archive will not recognize a prohibition on archiving the message.

==Newsreader software programs==
When DejaNews was purchased by Google, Google continued to honor the X-No-Archive directive. Other newsgroup archiving services have also followed in DejaNews&#x27; footsteps, though the decision not to archive X-No-Archive messages has been entirely voluntary.

Many popular newsreader and posting software programs, such as Forté Agent, include, as a standard option, the ability to insert an X-No-Archive field into messages at the user&#x27;s request.

Mozilla Thunderbird has the ability to insert custom fields into the header of both email and Usenet messages. This feature must be manually enabled by editing the mailnews.js file (instructions are included in the .js file). However, custom fields are not automatically inserted into messages by Thunderbird - the user must add them manually to each message as desired.

==Mail archive software==
GNU Mailman supports XNA; archiving is suppressed for any value of X-No-Archive

Gmane suppresses archiving for X-No-Archive: yes

The online service mail-archive.com supports X-No-Archive: yes

<doc id="303988" wikidata="Q313594" url="?curid=303988" title="Kirsan Ilyumzhinov">
<text>Kirsan Nikolayevich Ilyumzhinov (born 5 April 1962) is a Russian oligarch, administrator and politician. He was President of the Republic of Kalmykia in the Russian Federation from 1993 to 2010, and was president of FIDE, the chess international governing body, from 1995 to 2018. He has also been at the forefront of promoting chess in schools in Russia and overseas. He is the founder of Novy Vzglyad publishing house.

He has been an honorary president of the former Kalmykian FC Uralan.

==Personal life==
Ilyumzhinov was born in Elista, Kalmykia. His parents were subject to the Kalmyk deportations of 1943 when the entire Kalmyk population was deported to Siberia – Kirsan&#x27;s own family had an impeccable record fighting the Germans (he was named after a great-uncle who served in the Red Army during the Russian Civil War and committed suicide after having been ordered to execute large numbers of captured Whites). He grew up in Elista, after the Kalmyks were allowed to return following Stalin&#x27;s death. From a young age he became interested in chess, and he won the Kalmykian national chess championship in 1976 at the age of 14. From 1979 to 1980 Ilyumzhinov worked as a mechanic-fitter at the Zvezda plant in Elista. After serving two years with the Soviet Army, he returned to the plant as a mechanic for a year, and then studied at the Moscow State Institute of Foreign Relations from 1983 to 1989. Between 1989 and 1990 he was a sales manager for the Soviet-Japanese automobile company &quot;Liko-Raduga&quot; in Moscow, and from 1990 until 1993 he was President of SAN Corporation in Moscow. Ilyumzhinov acquired his wealth with the emergence of the private sector which followed the collapse of the USSR. Kirsan was married to Danara Ilyumzhinova (&quot;née&quot; Davashkina) and they have one son, David. Ilyumzhinov also has two brothers, Sanal and Vyacheslav.

He is now married for the third time. Third wife since July 27, 2021 — Diana Dmitrievna Ilyumzhinova (&quot;née&quot; Gurova)

In addition to his native Kalmyk and Russian, he is fluent in English, Japanese, and speaks a little Korean, Mongolian and Chinese.

=== UFO experience ===
Ilyumzhinov has drawn worldwide attention for claiming that in September 1997 he was taken from his flat by aliens and travelled in their spaceship, visiting another planet. He claims three of his staff searched his flat during this, failing to find him, and could not explain how he then reappeared in his bedroom an hour later. A &quot;Chess Notes&quot; feature article by Edward Winter provides a comprehensive collection of Ilyumzhinov&#x27;s own words on his alleged encounters with aliens. These claims brought Ilyumzhinov a lot of media attention both in Russia and internationally and have been instrumental in making him better known outside the chess world.

==Political career==
On 12 April 1993, Ilyumzhinov was elected as the first president of the Republic of Kalmykia, and remained president until 2010. Soon after his election, Ilyumzhinov introduced presidential rule, concentrating power in his own hands. He called early elections on 15 October 1995 and was re-elected unopposed, this time for a 7-year term. He won re-election in 2002. Ilyumzhinov&#x27;s election platform for the presidency of Kalmykia included promising voters $100 each and a mobile phone for every shepherd—much of the population of Kalmykia living from agriculture. He once campaigned under the slogan &quot;a wealthy president is a safeguard against corruption.&quot; He also pledged to introduce what he called an &quot;economic dictatorship&quot; in the republic, as well as to continue to promote chess in Kalmykia, in Russia and to the wider world. After his re-election in 1995, Ilyumzhinov reportedly told a journalist from the Russian daily Izvestia, &quot;Irrespective of what I tell people, I give them instructions on a subconscious level, a code. I do the same thing when I communicate with Russian citizens from other regions. I am creating around the republic a kind of extra-sensory field and it helps us a lot in our projects.&quot;

Ilyumzhinov has spent millions of dollars on chess and supporting religion. He built a Catholic church after a visit with Pope John Paul II. He says has also built a mosque, a synagogue, 22 Orthodox churches, and 30 Buddhist temples. Chess was made a compulsory subject in the first three years of elementary school—the only place in the world where this is the case. The region now has numerous champions. The 14th Dalai Lama has visited Kirsan Ilyumzhinov on many occasions and has blessed a number of the temples in Elista, as well as Kalmyk Buddhist temples overseas. Ilyumzhinov denies persistent accusations of diverting the republic&#x27;s resources for his own use and of suppressing media freedom. In 2004, police dispersed a small number of demonstrators who demanded his resignation. When Australian journalist Eric Campbell interviewed people in Elista about Ilyumzhinov, he found that many were happy that he had managed to gain widespread attention for Kalmykia through chess, although one was slightly critical of the money invested in chess projects.

On 8 June 1998, Larisa Yudina, a publisher of an opposition newspaper, was stabbed to death in Elista. Both people convicted in the murder were Kalmykian government aides, and one was an advisor to Ilyumzhinov. One other person was acquitted by offering evidence to help in the conviction. Ilyumzhinov denied any involvement with the murder; the incident was investigated by the local and the Russian authorities. On 24 October 2010 Ilyumzhinov retired as Head of Kalmykia, being replaced by Alexey Orlov. On 12 June 2011, Ilyumzhinov appeared in public in Tripoli alongside the then-embattled, since overthrown and executed, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, after having played a game of chess with him.

=== United States sanctions ===
On 25 November 2015, the United States Department of the Treasury named him a Specially Designated National &quot;for materially assisting and acting for or on behalf of the Government of Syria, Central Bank of Syria, Adib Mayaleh, and Batoul Rida.&quot; Due to these sanctions, on 6 December 2015, Ilyumzhinov withdrew from any legal, financial and business operations of FIDE until such time as he is removed from the list. Despite this, on 12 February 2018, UBS announced they would be closing all FIDE bank accounts.

==FIDE career==
In November 1995, Ilyumzhinov became President of the International Chess Federation, investing a large amount of his private fortune into the game. He has been enthusiastic about attracting international tournaments to Kalmykia, and many grandmasters have done so. His flamboyant plans to build an extravagant Chess City in the republic led to protests by some people, but have been praised by others for generating good publicity. The 1996 match between Gata Kamsky and Anatoly Karpov was originally scheduled to be played in Baghdad, but was moved to Elista due to the international reaction.

In other developments during that time, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov encountered opposition from rivals in the European chess federations, the U.S., and Canada. Some of these managed to a special meeting in Utrecht, Netherlands, on 27–28 April. The meeting called for equal treatment for Kamsky and Karpov, the restoration of the traditional FIDE cycle of qualifying contests leading to the world title match, and a shake-up in FIDE. To reinforce this reformation the Utrecht partners supported a candidate to challenge Ilyumzhinov at the FIDE Congress that took place alongside the Chess Olympiad. The candidate was Jaime Sunye Neto, a grandmaster from Brazil. Ilyumzhinov was successful in mustering support from the Third World and from Russia, and he won the election 87–46. There was no restoration of the traditional qualifying cycle, and Ilyumzhinov&#x27;s own preference for a $5 million knockout contest for the world&#x27;s top 100 players was deferred from December 1996 until December 1997, with no definite sponsor announced.

In the summer of 1998, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov announced his possible candidacy for the Russian presidency. This coincided with Anatoly Karpov being critical of the annual knockout FIDE world title system. Karpov argued that his contract with FIDE stipulated that the winner of the 1998 Karpov-Anand match would hold the title for two years. Karpov&#x27;s successful advocacy of his rights led to the cancellation of a planned world title knockout series in Las Vegas, Nevada, later in that year. Since Karpov had an unsuccessful year, apart from his match against Anand, and he was unable to resist the plan that he would have to enter this knockout, whenever it came to be organized, at a far earlier stage.

Ilyumzhinov managed to persuade the 140 member countries of FIDE to take part in the main team event of the year, the Chess Olympiad, scheduled to start in late September 1998, in Elista. However the event started late due to the failure to complete the new venue in time. In the end, it attracted 110 teams to the main event, a Swiss system contest shortened to 13 rounds to allow for the delay.

On 2 June 2006, Ilyumzhinov was re-elected as FIDE President by a margin of 96–54 against his opponent Bessel Kok. In an October 2006 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article Garry Kasparov, who backed a rival to Ilyumzhinov, criticized Ilyumzhinov FIDE&#x27;s leadership stating: &quot;(Ilyumzhinov) has created a vertical column of power that would be familiar to any observer of Russia today.&quot; Nigel Short, the British grandmaster who also supported Kirsan&#x27;s rival for the leadership of FIDE, joined Kasparov&#x27;s misgivings at Ilyumzhinov&#x27;s victory.

On 29 September 2010, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov was reelected as President of FIDE defeating his rival, Anatoly Karpov decisively – winning this election by 95 votes to 55. However, there were bitter accusations of cheating and corruption about the voting system with CJ de Mooi, the president of the English Chess Federation, saying: &quot;This was a farce of a vote...There wasn&#x27;t even a pretence of fairness and free speech.&quot;

In 2014, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov was reelected as President of FIDE after defeating Garry Kasparov, winning 110–61.

On his 20th anniversary as FIDE president in November 2015, Ilyumzhinov listed his major achievements as: recognition of chess as a sport, unification of the world chess championship, stable financial situation of FIDE, complete FIDE calendar, the number of people playing chess increased more than ten times, the FIDE family has substantially increased, and development of women&#x27;s chess. In an interview on the same occasion, he mentioned that while not currently aspiring to become FIFA president, he might well become a candidate in the future, saying &quot;I have a vision of how to make football still more popular and cleanse the organisation of corruption, like we did it with FIDE.&quot;

Due to OFAC sanctions, on 6 December 2015, Ilyumzhinov withdrew from any legal, financial and business operations of FIDE until such time as he is removed from the OFAC list but he remains in control of FIDE. In a subsequent interview, he said the USA sanctions were either a mistake or a provocation, with his lawyers planning to file a US$50 billion lawsuit, based on their estimated damages. Previously in June 2014, Ilyuzmhinov had noted that his name was floating around concerning sanctions regarding Ukraine.

On 27 March 2017, FIDE stated through its website that Ilyumzhinov had announced his resignation, and that the extraordinary meeting will be held next month to review and accept the resignation. Ilyumzhinov later denied his resignation in Russian media, as did his assistant when contacted by Chess.com; FIDE executive director Nigel Freeman replied that Ilyumzhinov had verbally resigned during the Presidential Board Meeting in Athens, and called an Extraordinary Presidential Board Meeting to discuss the issue. At the meeting, it was confirmed that Ilyumzhinov had not formally resigned, however he was criticized for making misleading statements to the media.

In May 2018, Chessdom.com reported Ilyumzhinov to have applied for the new FIDE election with a virtual candidate on his ticket called &quot;Glen Stark&quot;.

On 13 July 2018, the FIDE ethics commission sanctioned Kirsan Ilyumzhinov for violating the FIDE code of ethics. The FIDE president, who was banned from &quot;holding any position&quot; effectively for six months, initially announced his intentions to fight this decision. However, shortly after, he desisted from running for a new term as FIDE President.

After having been in office for 23 years, since 1995, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov was finally ousted, clearing the path for a successor. The Greek Georgios Makropoulos, who had been General Secretary since 1990 and number two in the organization under Kirsan&#x27;s presidency, was the first to announce his ticket. He was followed by the Englishman Nigel Short, a world title contender in the World Chess Championship 1993 against Garry Kasparov. The last to announce his candidacy was Arkady Dvorkovich, who had served as Russian deputy prime minister and was also a member of the supervisory board of the Russian Chess Federation. Dvorkovich was also one of the chief organizers of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. In the elections, held in Batumi (Georgia) in October 2018, Dvorkovich won by 103 votes to 78 against Makropoulos, thus becoming FIDE&#x27;s 7th President in history.

<doc id="303990" wikidata="Q1716166" url="?curid=303990" title="Mercer's theorem">
<text>In mathematics, specifically functional analysis, Mercer&#x27;s theorem is a representation of a symmetric positive-definite function on a square as a sum of a convergent sequence of product functions. This theorem, presented in , is one of the most notable results of the work of James Mercer (1883–1932). It is an important theoretical tool in the theory of integral equations; it is used in the Hilbert space theory of stochastic processes, for example the Karhunen–Loève theorem; and it is also used in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space theory where it characterizes a symmetric positive-definite kernel as a reproducing kernel.

== Introduction ==
To explain Mercer&#x27;s theorem, we first consider an important special case; see below for a more general formulation.
A &quot;kernel&quot;, in this context, is a symmetric continuous function

:formula_1

where formula_2 for all formula_3.

&quot;K&quot; is said to be a positive-definite kernel if and only if

:formula_4

for all finite sequences of points &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; of [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] and all choices of real numbers &quot;c&quot;1, ..., &quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot;. Note that the term &quot;positive-definite&quot; is well-established in literature despite the weak inequality in the definition. 

The fundamental characterization of stationary positive-definite kernels (where formula_5) is given by Bochner&#x27;s theorem. It states that a continuous function formula_6 is positive-definite if and only if it can be expressed as the Fourier transform of a finite non-negative measure formula_7:

:formula_8

This spectral representation reveals the connection between positive definiteness and harmonic analysis, providing a stronger and more direct characterization of positive definiteness than the abstract definition in terms of inequalities when the kernel is stationary, e.g, when it can be expressed as a 1-variable function of the distance between points rather than the 2-variable function of the positions of pairs of points.

Associated to &quot;K&quot; is a linear operator (more specifically a Hilbert–Schmidt integral operator when the interval is compact) on functions defined by the integral

:formula_9

We assume formula_10 can range through the space
of real-valued square-integrable functions &quot;L&quot;2[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]; however, in many cases the associated RKHS can be strictly larger than &quot;L&quot;2[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]. Since &quot;TK&quot; is a linear operator, the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of &quot;TK&quot; exist.

Theorem. Suppose &quot;K&quot; is a continuous symmetric positive-definite kernel. Then there is an orthonormal basis
{&quot;e&quot;i}i of &quot;L&quot;2[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] consisting of eigenfunctions of &quot;T&quot;&quot;K&quot; such that the corresponding
sequence of eigenvalues {λ&quot;i&quot;}&quot;i&quot; is nonnegative. The eigenfunctions corresponding to non-zero eigenvalues are continuous on [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] and &quot;K&quot; has the representation

:formula_11

where the convergence is absolute and uniform.

== Details ==
We now explain in greater detail the structure of the proof of
Mercer&#x27;s theorem, particularly how it relates to spectral theory of compact operators.

* The map &quot;K&quot; ↦ &quot;T&quot;&quot;K&quot; is injective.
* &quot;T&quot;&quot;K&quot; is a non-negative symmetric compact operator on &quot;L&quot;2[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;]; moreover &quot;K&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;) ≥ 0.

To show compactness, show that the image of the unit ball of &quot;L&quot;2[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] under &quot;T&quot;&quot;K&quot; is equicontinuous and apply Ascoli&#x27;s theorem, to show that the image of the unit ball is relatively compact in C([&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;]) with the uniform norm and &quot;a fortiori&quot; in &quot;L&quot;2[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;].

Now apply the spectral theorem for compact operators on Hilbert
spaces to &quot;T&quot;&quot;K&quot; to show the existence of the
orthonormal basis {&quot;e&quot;i}i of
&quot;L&quot;2[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;]

:formula_12

If λi ≠ 0, the eigenvector (eigenfunction) &quot;e&quot;i is seen to be continuous on [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;]. Now

:formula_13

which shows that the sequence

:formula_14

converges absolutely and uniformly to a kernel &quot;K&quot;0 which is easily seen to define the same operator as the kernel &quot;K&quot;. Hence &quot;K&quot;=&quot;K&quot;0 from which Mercer&#x27;s theorem follows.

Finally, to show non-negativity of the eigenvalues one can write formula_15 and expressing the right hand side as an integral well-approximated by its Riemann sums, which are non-negative
by positive-definiteness of &quot;K&quot;, implying formula_16, implying formula_17.

== Trace ==
The following is immediate:

Theorem. Suppose &quot;K&quot; is a continuous symmetric positive-definite kernel; &quot;T&quot;&quot;K&quot; has a sequence of nonnegative
eigenvalues {λi}i. Then

:formula_18

This shows that the operator &quot;T&quot;&quot;K&quot; is a trace class operator and

:formula_19

== Generalizations ==
Mercer&#x27;s theorem itself is a generalization of the result that any symmetric positive-semidefinite matrix is the Gramian matrix of a set of vectors.

The first generalization replaces the interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] with any compact Hausdorff space and Lebesgue measure on [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] is replaced by a finite countably additive measure μ on the Borel algebra of &quot;X&quot; whose support is &quot;X&quot;. This means that μ(&quot;U&quot;) &gt; 0 for any nonempty open subset &quot;U&quot; of &quot;X&quot;.

A recent generalization replaces these conditions by the following: the set &quot;X&quot; is a first-countable topological space endowed with a Borel (complete) measure μ. &quot;X&quot; is the support of μ and, for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;, there is an open set &quot;U&quot; containing &quot;x&quot; and having finite measure. Then essentially the same result holds:

Theorem. Suppose &quot;K&quot; is a continuous symmetric positive-definite kernel on &quot;X&quot;. If the function κ is &quot;L&quot;1μ(&quot;X&quot;), where κ(x)=K(x,x), for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;, then there is an orthonormal set
{&quot;e&quot;i}i of &quot;L&quot;2μ(&quot;X&quot;) consisting of eigenfunctions of &quot;T&quot;&quot;K&quot; such that corresponding
sequence of eigenvalues {λi}i is nonnegative. The eigenfunctions corresponding to non-zero eigenvalues are continuous on &quot;X&quot; and &quot;K&quot; has the representation

:formula_11

where the convergence is absolute and uniform on compact subsets of &quot;X&quot;.

The next generalization deals with representations of &quot;measurable&quot; kernels.

Let (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, μ) be a σ-finite measure space. An &quot;L&quot;2 (or square-integrable) kernel on &quot;X&quot; is a function

:formula_21

&quot;L&quot;2 kernels define a bounded operator &quot;T&quot;&quot;K&quot; by the formula

:formula_22

&quot;T&quot;&quot;K&quot; is a compact operator (actually it is even a Hilbert–Schmidt operator). If the kernel &quot;K&quot; is symmetric, by the spectral theorem, &quot;T&quot;&quot;K&quot; has an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. Those eigenvectors that correspond to non-zero eigenvalues can be arranged in a sequence {&quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot;}&quot;i&quot; (regardless of separability).

Theorem. If &quot;K&quot; is a symmetric positive-definite kernel on (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, μ), then

:formula_23

where the convergence in the &quot;L&quot;2 norm. Note that when continuity of the kernel is not assumed, the expansion no longer converges uniformly.

==Mercer&#x27;s condition==
In mathematics, a real-valued function &quot;K&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) is said to fulfill Mercer&#x27;s condition if for all square-integrable functions &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) one has

:formula_24

===Discrete analog===
This is analogous to the definition of a positive-semidefinite matrix. This is a matrix formula_25 of dimension formula_26, which satisfies, for all vectors formula_27, the property
:formula_28.

===Examples===
A positive constant function
:formula_29
satisfies Mercer&#x27;s condition, as then the integral becomes by Fubini&#x27;s theorem 
:formula_30
which is indeed non-negative.

<text>The University of Akureyri ( , regionally also ) was founded in 1987 in the town of Akureyri in the northeastern part of Iceland. It is today a school of Humanities and Social science, and a school of Health, Business and Natural science. Over 2800 students attended the university in the autumn semester of 2024, around half of them through flexible learning, making the university the largest provider of distance education in the country. The University of Akureyri coordinates with other Icelandic Universities to operate the University Centre of the Westfjords (Háskólasetur Vestfjarða) located in Ísafjörður, which operates two master&#x27;s degrees, one in Coastal and Marine Management and the other in Marine Innovation. Additionally, The University of Akureyri coordinates with other Nordic Universities for the West Nordic Studies and Polar Law Masters programs.

==History==
The University was established in 1987 when the health sciences and industrial management studies began. The first rector was Haraldur Bessason. Staff were four people in total and the number of students 31. Two classrooms in the local sports center were used as classrooms. In 1988, the library was officially added to the school. Two months after the library was added, the Student Center opened. The first class to graduate was in 1989, and consisted of 10 industrial management students. On January 4, 1990, the Faculty of Fisheries was established. The first master&#x27;s degree students graduated February 26, 2000. These students pursued a master&#x27;s degree in nursing. A new chancellor took over from Þorsteinn Gunnarsson on July 1, 2009 after 15 years in office, Stefán B. Sigurðsson. In autumn 2017, HA became a fully-fledged university offering education at all levels of university studies when it received authorization to offer doctoral studies. The first doctoral students enrolled at the school at the end of 2018, and the first doctoral defense at the school took place in autumn 2022. 

==Campus==

The main building, called &quot;Sólborg&quot; is a series of interconnected sections built in numerous phases since 1967. The University received its current residence in 1995. A new research and development building called &quot;Borgir&quot; was opened in 2004.

Teaching is conducted in two buildings at the University of Akureyri campus (Norðurslóð) called Sólborg and Borgir. The university campus area is centrally located in Akureyri.

Other facilities include a cafeteria, and a wellness and exercise centre.

===Library===
The university library is located at Sólborg, where there are facilities for reading and computer use. It is a research library and it tailors its purchases of material mostly according to the requirements of the University faculties and the research conducted at the University. Students have access to the reading rooms at all hours.

==Polar Law ==

Polar Law studies are offered every other year at the University of Akureyri (UNAK), Iceland. They are unique and have been the first of their kind since they were launched in 2008, alongside the annual Polar Law Symposia, hosted in the past by UNAK and other partner universities in the Arctic and worldwide (https://www.polarlaw.is/en/polar-law-symposium), and the Yearbook of Polar Law that follows the symposia and publishes highly topical and peer-reviewed articles related to Polar Law (https://brill.com/display/serial/POLA).

Within the Polar Law Programme, the following paths can be taken: a 120 ECTS programme leading to an MA degree; a 90 ECTS programme leading to an LL.M. degree; a 60 ECTS study at master level leading to a Graduate diploma; and individual courses in Polar law leading to a certificate. All courses in Polar Law are taught in English.

Course topics include Arctic and Antarctic law and policy, Indigenous Peoples rights and cultures, economies, industries and natural resource governance in the Polar regions, law of the sea, and international environmental law at the Poles. They are taught by experienced scholars and practitioners from UNAK and other national and international partner universities and research institutions, all of them specialized in the field of Polar Law.

==Research==
Most research is done by academic members of the staff in the university&#x27;s Research and Development Center. In addition, there are other research institutes:
*Research and Development Centre of UNAK
*Research Centre on Children&#x27;s Literature
*Research Centre for Health Science at UNAK
*The Icelandic Tourism Research Centre
*Centre of School Development at UNAK
*Research Centre Against Violence
*Fisheries Science Centre

Arctic Issues

UNAK&#x27;s policy emphasizes on being progressive in teaching and research that meets international standards. Emphasis is placed on teaching and research related to Icelandic society and economy, as well as fields related to Arctic issues.

UNAK is an international university where standards of research and teaching are international. UNAK emphasizes greatly on the importance to cooperate with universities in the North and is one of the founding members of the University of the Arctic, collaborative network of universities in the North. The University of the Arctic links together universities and organizes student exchange program (North2North), thematic networks, joint degree etc. UNAK&#x27;s policy with the emphasis on Arctic issues has created uniqueness for the university which is now both domestically and abroad recognized for teaching and research in disciplines related to the North.

The University of Akureyri is also a founding partner of the Icelandic Arctic Cooperation Network.
The main purpose of The Icelandic Arctic Cooperation Network is to increase the visibility and understanding of the Arctic and activities working towards the northern Iceland. The CEO of the network, Embla Eir Oddsdóttir, has for many years worked on projects and studies relating to the Arctic.

Conferences

The University of Akureyri Research and Development Centre (RHA) offers services for organizing conferences, meetings or conventions in partnership with professionals. RHA has good experience in organizing such events both domestically and abroad.

==External Relations==

===International Students===
Each year the school receives many exchange students. These students come through one of four exchange programs:
*Nordplus
*Erasmus
*North2North
*Bilateral agreement between universities
Through these programs, students can come as guest students. This occurs when a student attends the university for a short period of time, but there is no formal co-operation between universities. Not only do students travel, but so do teachers. Through the Erasmus program, teachers have travelled to co-operating universities and given lectures. This exchange of teachers has taken place in many countries including: the United Kingdom, Denmark, Latvia, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, and France.

Agreement with Western Kentucky University

Western Kentucky University (WKU), the University of Akureyri (UNAK) and the Icelandic Arctic Cooperation Network (IACN) signed an academic and research agreement that solidifies the North Atlantic Climate Change Collaboration (NAC3) project.

The innovative agreement signed by the academic and research partners will center on academic exchanges and joint course offerings, research initiatives, capacity building, economic development activities, and service-learning. The NAC3 project aims to focus on academic exchange, course development and collaborative research in the areas of climate change, climate literacy, health and wellness, ocean dynamics, sustainability, informal public education, economic development, technology exchange, and water resources, among others. (Additional information about the project is available at www.wku.edu/iceland)

==University Centre of the Westfjords==

The University Centre, also known as Háskólasetur Vestfjarða in Icelandic was founded at the University level in 2005 in Ísafjörður. The Centre employees 10 full-time permanent staff members as well as hosting 50 members of staff for research and teaching. The University Centre operates distance learning for 100 students in the Westfjords region of Iceland as well as two master&#x27;s degrees programs, them being Coastal and Marine Management and Marine Innovation. In addition to these programs, the Centre hosts a variety of summer Icelandic courses. Programs at the University Centre, particularly the Coastal &amp; Marine Management program have been increasingly attracting a diverse group of international students. In 2010, 120 applicants applied, 45 were accepted and 20 enrolled. 14 percent of these students were Icelandic and the others from a variety of other countries. The number of applicants for the program has been rising since.

Coastal and Marine Management

Coastal and Marine Management is a demanding and ambitious master&#x27;s program in environmental and resource management. T he program is cross-disciplinary and prepares students for diverse positions in both the public and private sectors. The program emphasizes management and each course involves an interdisciplinary approach. Emphasis is placed on solving real life problems. The programme emphasises ideas and methods from ecology, sociology, economics and business studies. Students completing the programme have knowledge of the diverse and valuable resources of the coast and the sea, understand their current condition, and have gathered tools and expertise to drive the sustainable use of marine resources. The course language, including all teaching, is English. The University Centre of the Westfjords offers this programme in co-operation with the University of Akureyri. Teaching takes place in Ísafjörður. Students graduate from the University of Akureyri with an MRM degree (Master of Resource Management), with coastal and marine management as a specialty.

Students complete 8 core courses and up to 12 electives. The core course are :
*Scientific Methods and Research Practices
*Principles of Planning
*Integrated Coastal Zone Management: Introduction and Theory
*Understanding the Ocean
*Applied Methodology
*Physical Processes of Coastal and
Marine Environment
*Economics and Policy
*Integrated Coastal Zone Management: Practical Applications and
Challenges

Students can choose from a number of electives to fulfill the taught part of the program, including but not limited to:
*Leadership and Management in Changing Times
*Marine Protected Area Management
*Coastal and Underwater Heritage
*Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning
*Managing Coastal and Offshore Emergencies
*Pollution in the Coastal Arctic
*Evaluating Sustainable Fisheries
*Environmental Certification and Eco-labeling Schemes
*Law of the Sea
*Geographical Information Systems
*Innovation and Sustainability in Aquaculture
*Fishing Technology
*Communicating Climate Change
*Adaption Planning
*Conflict Resolution in Ocean Management
*Marine Renewable Energy

Among the fields which the master&#x27;s program in Coastal and Marine Management prepares students to work in are resource and land use planning, environmental impact assessment, consulting work, teaching and research. The program is internationally oriented and taught in English, and both students and instructors come from a diverse range of countries. The master&#x27;s program in Coastal and Marine Management brings together people of different backgrounds who share their experience, knowledge, and ideas in a small-scale, creative and fertile intellectual environment, with the goal of finding ways of using natural resources in a sustainable way.

Marine Innovation

The professional master&#x27;s program in Marine Innovation is an unconventional program offered in cooperation with the University of Akureyri and the Innovation Centre Iceland, where students learn to make a job instead of taking one. We define marine innovation in a wide sense, covering everything from fisheries, aquaculture, and food production, to technical solutions and energy production, as well as tourism and culture.

The program gives students insight into coastal and marine issues and the nature and conditions of starting and running an innovative micro-business. Each student designs an individually-tailored plan of study, combining courses in their professional field and business management courses with the respective innovative project. Students work closely with the Innovation Centre Iceland and the Westfjords economy. Because the program is individually structured the number of students is limited.

By completing the program students will be well-prepared to execute their own ideas; whether it is by founding a new business or within an established business. These skills are also valuable in the labor market in general, in fields such as project managing, strategic planning and decision making for example. In this sense the program provides students with excellent skills that are useful in the ever-changing modern labor market that demands independent work methods, innovative spirit and self-discipline.

<text>Toledo is a province in the autonomous community of Castilla–La Mancha, Spain, that is divided into 204 municipalities. Spanish census, the province is the 23rd largest by population, with inhabitants, and the 7th largest by land area, spanning . Municipalities are the basic local political division in Spain, and can only belong to one province. They enjoy a large degree of autonomy in their local administration, being in charge of tasks such as urban planning, water supply, lighting, roads, local police, and firefighting.

The organisation of municipalities in Spain is outlined in a local government law (; ) passed on 2 April 1985 and finalised by an 18 April 1986 royal decree. The Statute of Autonomy of Castilla–La Mancha also contains provisions concerning the relations between the municipalities and the autonomous government of Castilla–La Mancha. All citizens of Spain are required to register in the municipality in which they reside. Each municipality is a corporation with independent legal personhood: its governing body is called the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; (municipal council or corporation), a term often also used to refer to the municipal offices (city and town halls). The &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; is composed of the mayor (), the deputy mayors (&quot;tenientes de alcalde&quot;) and the plenary assembly (&quot;pleno&quot;) of councillors (&quot;concejales&quot;). Municipalities are categorised by population for the purpose of determining the number of councillors: three when the population is up to 100 inhabitants, five for 101250, seven for 2511,000, nine for 1,0012,000, eleven for 2,0015,000, thirteen for 5,00110,000, seventeen for 10,00120,000, twenty-one for 20,00150,000, and twenty-five for 50,001100,000.

The mayor and the deputy mayors are elected by the plenary assembly, which is itself elected by universal suffrage. Elections in municipalities with more than 250 inhabitants are carried out following a proportional representation system with closed lists, whilst those with a population lower than 250 use a block plurality voting system with open lists. The plenary assembly must meet periodically at the seat of the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot;, with meetings occurring more or less frequently depending on the population of the municipality: monthly for those whose population is larger than 20,000, once every two months if it ranges between 5,001 and 20,000, and once every three months if it does not exceed 5,000. Many &quot;ayuntamientos&quot; also have a local governing board (), which is named by the mayor from amongst the councillors and is required for municipalities of more than 5,000 inhabitants. The board, whose role is to assist the mayor between meetings of the plenary assembly, may not include more than one third of the councillors.

The largest municipality by population in the province as of the 2023 Spanish census is Toledo, its capital, with 85,818 residents, while the smallest is Illán de Vacas, with 3 residents. The largest municipality by area is Los Yébenes, which spans 676.16 km2, while El Puente del Arzobispo is the smallest at 0.98 km2.

<doc id="304005" wikidata="Q1350451" url="?curid=304005" title="Misawa Air Base">
<text>is an air base of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), the United States Air Force, and the United States Navy located in Misawa, Aomori, in the northern part of the island of Honshū of Japan. It is located north of Tokyo at the &quot;Tip of the Spear&quot;. It is a Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) facility with the 35th Fighter Wing (35 FW, about 48 F-16 aircraft split among the 13th and 14th Fighter Squadrons) as its host wing. It hosts both Japanese and American troops.

==History==

=== Origins ===
What is now called Misawa Air Base has been used by the military since the Meiji period, when it was used as a cavalry training center for the Imperial Army.

In 1870, the Emperor Meiji established a stud farm for the household cavalry in the area that later became Misawa AB, and kept his own (Tenno Heika) cavalry there until 1931, when the Sino-Japanese conflict required their use in China. Misawa remained a training center for Japanese Cavalry until the Japanese Army constructed the first runway at Misawa for military aircraft in 1938.

Misawa Air Base was near the takeoff site of the world&#x27;s first non-stop trans-Pacific flight in 1931. Clyde Pangborn and Hugh Herndon took off from a gravel runway on Sabishiro Beach near Misawa in the aircraft known as &quot;Miss Veedol&quot;, landing 41 hours later in Wenatchee, Washington, thereby successfully crossing the Pacific Ocean. The runway is commemorated by a large sign in the coastal forest and is a popular beach and recreation area for Misawa AB personnel. The cities of Wenatchee and Misawa cemented their special relationship by becoming official sister cities in 1981, strengthening their friendship through annual cultural exchange programs.

The Imperial Army transformed Misawa into an air base in 1938 when it was used as a base for long-range bombers. By early 1941, the Genzan Flying Corps trained at Misawa. The base was taken over by the Imperial Navy Air Corps in 1942, when the 22d Imperial Naval Air Wg assumed control of the base and the mission was changed to research and development. In 1944, facilities were built for Kamikaze Special Attack forces.

=== World War II ===
Before the outbreak of World War II, Lake Ogawara at Misawa was used by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service to practice for the attack on Pearl Harbor. The lake was used because it was similar in depth to Pearl Harbor. The Japanese military fashioned hills near the shore of the lake to resemble the shapes of Battleships and Cruisers that were anchored in Pearl Harbor. This provided for a realistic view for their pilots from the air. The pilots conducted low level bombing runs, dropping torpedoes into the shallow depths of Lake Ogawara. This practice developed and refined the method to attack the ships that were anchored at Pearl Harbor. During World War II, the Misawa area was heavily damaged (base 90 percent destroyed) by U.S. fighters and bombers.

=== Postwar era===
The American occupation of Misawa began in September 1945. Misawa had to be almost completely reconstructed by occupying U.S. forces, the Army&#x27;s 32nd Engineer Construction Group, who restored the base for future use by the United States Army Air Forces. During the Korean War and Vietnam War, Misawa supported fighter missions. The base was the launching point for clandestine surveillance overflights into China and the USSR during the 1950s.

After the immediate postwar reconstruction of facilities, the first permanent USAAF tenant was the 613th Air Control and Warning Squadron (613th AC&amp;WS), taking up residence on July 15, 1946, and providing air traffic control in the Misawa area for the next decade.

==== 49th Fighter Bomber Wing ====
The first operational fighter wing was the 49th Fighter-Bomber Group, being reassigned to Misawa on March 31, 1948. The 49th had three operational squadrons, the 7th, 8th and 9th, and flew the P-80 Shooting Star along with a few P-61 Black Widow night fighters. The 49th FBW performed occupation duties in Japan and took part in maneuvers and surveillance patrols as part of Far East Air Forces. In February 1950, the unit was redesignated as the 49th Fighter-Bomber Wing, with the group being its operational component.

=== Korean War ===
With the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, the 49th Fighter-Bomber Group was split off from the wing and was one of the first USAF units dispatched to Korea from Japan, its tactical squadrons began operations with F-51D Mustangs as the F-51D performed the ground support role better than the Shooting Stars. The group was rejoined with the wing in December 1950 when the Wing was reassigned to Taegu AB (K-2).

At Misawa, the 49th was replaced by the 6163d Air Base Wing to perform host and occupation duties. The 41st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron from the 35th FIW at Johnson AB was deployed to Misawa to provide air defense starting in September 1950, remaining until February 1951, being replaced by the 40th FIS also from Johnson AB, which remained until July. The 27th Fighter-Escort Wing was transferred from Taegu to Misawa in October, and remained at the base until January 20, 1953, to provide air defense flying straight-winged Republic F-84G Thunderjets which proved inadequate against the North Korean MiG-15s it encountered over Korean airspace.

Between May and August 1953, the 12th Strategic Fighter Wing pulled a rotational TDY at Misawa relieving the 27th and being relieved in turn by the 31st Strategic Fighter Wing. remaining until February 12, 1954. The 12th SFW returned for a second TDY in May 1954, remaining until August.

The 49th Fighter-Bomber Wing was relieved from its duties in South Korea on November 7, 1953, and resumed its host duties at the base. It remained at Misawa until December 10, 1957, however its operational control of its squadrons and group came under the 39th Air Division on March 1, 1955.

=== Cold War ===
==== 39th Air Division ====
On March 1, 1952, the 39th Air Division was established at Misawa, and through January 15, 1968, the Air Division controlled all of the units responsible for the air defense of north Japan, which included northern Honshū and Hokkaidō islands and the contiguous territorial waters.

Wings controlled by the 39th AD were:

* 49th Fighter Bomber Wing March 1, 1955 – April 15, 1957
*4th Fighter Bomber Wing March 8, 1955 – December 8, 1957
*21st Tactical Fighter Wing November 10, 1958 – June 18, 1960

Squadrons controlled by the 39th AD were:

* 4th Fighter Interceptor Squadron March 1, 1955 – June 20, 1965
*45th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron April 25, 1960 – January 15, 1968
*67th Tactical Fighter Squadron December 15, 1967 – January 15, 1968
* 339th Fighter Interceptor Squadron March 1, 1955 – January 15, 1958
* 356th Tactical Fighter Squadron November 29, 1965 – January 15, 1968
* 416th Tactical Fighter Squadron June 18, 1960 – June 16, 1964
* 418th Fighter Day Squadron December 10, 1957 – March 25, 1958
* 531st Tactical Fighter Squadron June 18, 1960 – June 16, 1964
* 612th Tactical Fighter Squadron November 3, 1965 – January 15, 1968.

In this role the 39th trained the assigned units and controlled aerial interception missions when Japanese air space was violated. The division also controlled air refueling and ECM missions, and trained personnel of the Japanese Air Self Defense Force in flying operations, radar operations and maintenance, and proper radio procedures.

After the Soviet Union shot down an RB-29 aircraft on November 7, 1954, the 39th provided fighter escort for all friendly reconnaissance aircraft flying near Soviet territory and the Northern Air Defense Sector.

The division also supported combat operations during the Vietnam War.

Aircraft flown by the 39th AD included the F-84, 1952–1954, 1958–1959; KB-29, 1953–1954; North American F-86 Sabre, 1954–1960; F-100, 1957–1964; F-102, 1960–1965; RF-101, 1960–1968; F-105, 1967–1968.

==== Japanese Air Forces ====
The first Japanese Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) units were activated at Misawa in October 1954, and the first Japanese Northern Air Defense Force units began operations in 1957.

==== 475th Air Base Wing ====
The 31st Air Division was inactivated on January 15, 1968, and was replaced at Misawa by the 475th Air Base Wing. The operational squadron at the base was the 67th Tactical Fighter Squadron, being deployed to Misawa from the 18th Tactical Fighter Wing based at Kadena AB, Okinawa. The squadron remained detached at Misawa until March 15, 1971, when the flight line was transferred to the United States Navy and all U.S. Air Force fighter sorties ended.

==== 6112th Air Base Group ====

The 6112th ABG took over the base host duties at Misawa in 1971, with the inactivation of the 475th ABW. For the next several years, Misawa&#x27;s focus was with the electronic intelligence gathering mission of the 6921st (later 6920th) Security Wing of the U.S. Air Force Security Service. The 6112th ABG performed PACAF administrative duties. The flight line was controlled by Naval Aviation units, with the JASDF operating from its own flight lines. The JASDF took over control of the airspace over Misawa on October 1, 1978.

During this period, the base hosted various Allied exercises in the region and the 6112th ABG provided support for 13 Air Force associated non-flying units, 14 DOD agencies and the JASDF units stationed in the Misawa area until September 1, 1982.

In 1983, Misawa was a major deployment site for rescue and recovery operations, following the downing of Korean Air Flight 007.

==== 432d Tactical Fighter Wing ====
In July 1984, the 432d Tactical Fighter Wing was reactivated at Misawa on the resumption of operational PACAF flying. The 432d controlled two F-16 Fighting Falcon squadrons (13th, 14th FS) and a rescue squadron (39th RQS) flying the HH-53 &quot;Super Jolly Green Giant&quot; helicopter.

=== Post Cold War ===
The 35th Fighter Wing was redesignated and reassigned October 1, 1994, when it inactivated at Naval Air Station Keflavik, Iceland and was reactivated the same day at Misawa where the wing assumed the missions and responsibilities previously performed by the 432nd Fighter Wing.

Near the 1995 new year, Misawa experienced two earthquakes—7.5 and 7.9 on the Richter scale at the epicenter off the coast of Hachinohe.

On July 25, 1998, a US F-16 based at Misawa was unable to become airborne and collided with an antenna array at the east end of Misawa&#x27;s runway and exploded. The pilot ejected, but landed in the flaming wreckage of the jet. He succumbed to his injuries on September 17, 1998, at Brooke Army Medical Center.

=== Global War on Terror ===
On September 25, 2003, a magnitude 8.3 earthquake occurred off the east coast of Hokkaidō which was strongly felt in Misawa and all of Aomori Prefecture. Damage to Misawa Air Base was limited to burst water mains, cosmetic cracks in walls and personal property damage. There were no reports of damage to the base runway. This was the largest earthquake reported by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for 2003.

On July 17, 2007, a US F-16 from Misawa, while deployed to the 13th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron, Balad AB, Iraq crashed after delinquent tire pressure testing and pilot misinterpretation. The pilot ejected safely and there were no injuries or deaths.

The base was slightly damaged by the March 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami and experienced a black out. There were concerns about flooding from the tsunami reaching the base, and about a nearby nuclear facility, the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant.

After the quake, personnel and aircraft from the base assisted with Operation Tomodachi. The base also served as an important hub for airlifted assistance during the disaster recovery efforts. During the crisis, around 1,400 American family members voluntarily departed the base for locations outside Japan.

In April 2015, two US F-16s based at Misawa made an emergency landing at a local airport after oil started leaking from one of the fighters.

In October 2016, four Royal Air Force Typhoon fighters from No. 2 Squadron RAF supported by a Voyager aerial tanker and a C-17 deployed to Misawa for the first bilateral exercises in Japan for the JASDF to host conducted with non-U.S. forces.

On February 20, 2018, a US F-16 based at Misawa dumped two external fuel tanks into the nearby Lake Ogawara after experiencing an engine fire.

On January 14, 2019, a US F-16 based at Misawa made a precautionary landing at a Japanese regional airport after a problem with the aircraft. It was later revealed that this was due to a plastic piece falling off of the aircraft mid-flight.

On April 3, 2019, a Japanese F-35A based at Misawa crashed over the Pacific Ocean approximately 85 miles East of Misawa Air Base. The cause was attributed to the pilot experiencing spatial disorientation. The JASDF proceeded to ground their F-35 fleet until safety inspections and additional training for pilots on spatial disorientation could be completed. Some debris from the aircraft was recovered, however, the pilot&#x27;s remains were not recovered until June 2019.
On November 1, 2019, a US F-16 based at Misawa accidentally dropped an inert training device about 3 miles North of Misawa Air Base&#x27;s Draughon Range, into a privately owned field. There were no injuries or deaths.

On February 2, 2020, the 35th Fighter Wing Commander temporarily tightened the base&#x27;s curfew and prohibited the consumption of alcohol off-post until March 2, 2020. This was due to 5 DUI cases and eight other alcohol related incidents over the course of December 2019 and January 2020.

In May 2021, the US Navy forward deployed Unmanned Patrol Squadron 19, operating two MQ-4C Tritons, from Andersen AFB to Naval Air Facility Misawa under CTF-72. The aircraft returned to Andersen AFB in Oct 2021.

=== Post Global War on Terror ===
On December 1, 2021, a US F-16 based at Misawa dropped its external fuel tank in the town of Fukaura, Aomori, during an in-flight emergency. The fuel tank fell near homes and the town hall of Fukaura. There were no injuries or deaths following the incident, and the F-16 made an emergency landing at Aomori Airport. The Japanese Ministry of Defense requested the base ground all F-16s, until it could be determined they were fit to fly.

In March 2022, the Japan Air Self Defense Force acquired the first of three RQ-4B Global Hawks which were stationed at Misawa as part of the 3rd Air Wing. All three are scheduled to be delivered by the end of 2022.

In September 2022, the 35th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron was inactivated and split into the 13th and 14th Fighter Generation Squadrons under the 35th Maintenance Group.

== Role and operations ==
Misawa is the only combined, joint service installation in the western Pacific. It houses three U.S. military services (Air Force, Navy, and Army), as well as the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. The base is home to 5,200 US military personnel, as well as 350 US civilian employees and 900 Japanese national employees.

The Misawa Passive Radio Frequency space surveillance site was used for tracking satellites using the signals they transmit. It also provided coverage of geosynchronous satellites using the Deep Space Tracking System (DSTS) but was dismantled around 2002. The Misawa Security Operations Center (MSOC), located in the northwestern part of the Air Base, is believed to be one of the largest ECHELON ground stations.

===United States===

The United States Air Force&#x27;s 35th Fighter Wing (35 FW) is the host unit at Misawa Air Base. The wing conducts daily F-16 flight training to maintain its combat readiness. Its pilots fly air-to-air weapons delivery exercises over water and sharpen their air-to-ground skills using the Draughon Gunnery Range (formerly Ripsaw Range) located 12 miles north of Misawa.

Four groups are assigned to the 35th Fighter Wing: the 35th Maintenance Group, the 35th Mission Support Group, 35th Medical Group and 35th Operations Group. Operational fighter squadrons of the 35th Operations Group are:

*13th Fighter Squadron &quot;Panthers&quot;, Red tail stripe
*14th Fighter Squadron &quot;Samurais&quot;, Yellow tail stripe

Both squadrons fly the Block 50 F-16C/D &quot;Wild Weasels&quot;, and use the tail code of &quot;WW&quot; (before adopting the &quot;WW&quot; tail code, the code &quot;MJ&quot; (for Misawa, Japan) was carried.

<doc id="304011" wikidata="Q180884" url="?curid=304011" title="Onyx">
<text>Onyx is a typically black-and-white banded variety of agate, a silicate mineral. The bands can also be monochromatic with alternating light and dark bands. &quot;Sardonyx&quot; is a variety with red to brown bands alternated with black or white bands. The name “onyx” is also frequently used for level-banded (parallel-banded) agates, but in proper usage it refers to color pattern not band structure. Onyx, as a descriptive term, has also been incorrectly applied to parallel-banded varieties of alabaster, marble, calcite, obsidian, and opal, and misleadingly to materials with contorted banding, such as &quot;cave onyx&quot; and &quot;Mexican onyx&quot;.

==Etymology==
&quot;Onyx&quot; comes through Latin (of the same spelling), from the Ancient Greek (), meaning or . Onyx with pink and white bands can sometimes resemble a fingernail. The English word &quot;nail&quot; is cognate with the Greek word.

==Varieties==

Onyx is formed of chalcedony bands in alternating colors. It is cryptocrystalline, consisting of fine intergrowths of the silica minerals quartz and moganite. Its bands are parallel, unlike the more chaotic banding that often occurs in agates.

Sardonyx is a variant in which the colored bands are sard (shades of red) rather than black. Black onyx is perhaps the most famous variety, but it is not as common as onyx with colored bands. Artificial treatments have been used since ancient times to produce the black color in &quot;black onyx&quot; and the reds and yellows in sardonyx. Most &quot;black onyx&quot; on the market is artificially colored.

==Imitations and treatments==
The name has also commonly been used to label other banded materials, such as banded calcite found in Mexico, India, and other places, and often carved, polished, and sold. This material is much softer than true onyx and more readily available. The majority of carved items sold as &quot;onyx&quot; today are this carbonate material.

Artificial onyx types have also been produced from common chalcedony and plain agates. The first-century naturalist Pliny the Elder described these techniques used in Roman times. Treatments for producing black and other colors include soaking or boiling chalcedony in sugar solutions, then treating with sulfuric or hydrochloric acid to carbonize sugars which had been absorbed into the top layers of the stone. These techniques are still used, as well as other dyeing treatments, and most so-called &quot;black onyx&quot; sold is artificially treated. In addition to dye treatments, heating and treatment with nitric acid have been used to lighten or eliminate undesirable colors.

==Geographic occurrence==
Onyx can be found in various regions of the world, including Greece, Yemen, Uruguay, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Germany, Pakistan, India, Indonesia, Madagascar, Latin America, the UK, and various states in the US.

==Historical use==

It has a long history of use for hardstone carving and jewelry, where it is usually cut as a cabochon or into beads. It has also been used for intaglio and hardstone cameo engraved gems, where the bands make the image contrast with the ground. Some onyx is natural but much of the material in commerce is produced by the staining of agate.

Onyx was used in Egypt as early as the Second Dynasty to make bowls and other pottery items. Use of sardonyx appears in the art of Minoan Crete, notably from the archaeological recoveries at Knossos.

Brazilian green onyx was often used as plinths for art deco sculptures created in the 1920s and 1930s. The German sculptor Ferdinand Preiss used Brazilian green onyx for the base on the majority of his chryselephantine sculptures. Green onyx was also used for trays and pin dishes – produced mainly in Austria – often with small bronze animals or figures attached.

Onyx is mentioned in the Bible many times. Sardonyx (onyx in which white layers alternate with sard - a brownish color) is mentioned in the Bible as well.

Onyx was known to the Ancient Greeks and Romans. The first-century naturalist Pliny the Elder described both types of onyx and various artificial treatment techniques in his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot;.

Slabs of onyx (from the Atlas Mountains) were famously used by Mies van der Rohe in Villa Tugendhat at Brno (completed 1930) to create a shimmering semi-translucent interior wall.

The Hôtel de la Païva in Paris is noted for its yellow onyx décor, and the new Mariinsky Theatre Second Stage in St.Petersburg uses yellow onyx in the lobby.

===Superstitions===
The ancient Romans entered battle carrying amulets of sardonyx engraved with Mars, the god of war. This was believed to bestow courage in battle. In Renaissance Europe, wearing sardonyx was believed to bestow eloquence. A traditional Persian belief is that it helped with epilepsy. Sardonyx was traditionally used by English midwives to ease childbirth by laying it between the breasts of the mother.

<text>Biscay is a province in the autonomous community of the Basque Country, Spain, that is divided into 113 municipalities. Spanish census, the province is the tenth largest by population, with inhabitants, and the second smallest by land area, spanning . Municipalities are the basic local political division in Spain and can only belong to one province. They enjoy a large degree of autonomy in their local administration. Amongst other tasks, they are in charge of urban planning, water supply, lighting, road network, local police, and firefighting.

The organisation of municipalities in Spain is outlined in a local government law (; ) passed on 2 April 1985 and finalised by an 18 April 1986 royal decree. The Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country of 1979 also contains provisions concerning the relations between the municipalities and the autonomous government of the Basque Country. All citizens of Spain are required to register in the municipality in which they reside. Each municipality is a corporation with independent legal personhood: its governing body is called the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; (municipal council or corporation), a term often also used to refer to the municipal offices (city and town halls). The &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; is composed of the mayor (), the deputy mayors (&quot;tenientes de alcalde&quot;) and the plenary assembly (&quot;pleno&quot;) of councillors (&quot;concejales&quot;). Municipalities are categorised by population for the purpose of determining the number of councillors: three when the population is up to 100 inhabitants, five for 101250, seven for 2511,000, nine for 1,0012,000, eleven for 2,0015,000, thirteen for 5,00110,000, seventeen for 10,00120,000, twenty-one for 20,00150,000, and twenty-five for 50,001100,000. One councillor is added for every additional 100,000 inhabitants, with a further one added when the number of councillors based on this methodology would be even in order to prevent tied votes.

The mayor and the deputy mayors are elected by the plenary assembly, which is itself elected by universal suffrage. Elections in municipalities with more than 250 inhabitants are carried out following a proportional representation system with closed lists, whilst those with a population lower than 250 use a block plurality voting system with open lists. The plenary assembly must meet periodically at the seat of the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot;, with meetings occurring more or less frequently depending on the population of the municipality: monthly for those whose population is larger than 20,000, once every two months if it ranges between 5,001 and 20,000, and once every three months if it does not exceed 5,000. Many &quot;ayuntamientos&quot; also have a local governing board (), which is named by the mayor from amongst the councillors and is required for municipalities of more than 5,000 inhabitants. The board, whose role is to assist the mayor between meetings of the plenary assembly, may not include more than one third of the councillors.

The largest municipality by population in the province of Biscay as of the 2023 Spanish census is Bilbao, its capital, with 345,235 residents, while the smallest is Arakaldo, with 162 residents. The largest municipality by area is Karrantza Harana/Valle de Carranza, which spans 137.82 km², while Lanestosa is the smallest at 1.14 km².

<text>Brent Fraser &quot;Billy&quot; Bowden (born 11 April 1963) is a New Zealand cricket umpire and former cricketer. He was a player until rheumatoid arthritis forced him to retire. He is well known for his dramatic signaling style which includes the famous &quot;crooked finger of doom&quot; out signal. On 6 February 2016, Bowden stood in his 200th One Day International match in the game between New Zealand and Australia in Wellington.

==Early life and career ==
Bowden was born in the Auckland suburb of Henderson and was educated at Westlake Boys High School.

In March 1995, Bowden officiated his first One Day International between New Zealand and Sri Lanka at Hamilton. In March 2000 he was appointed his first Test match as an on-field umpire, and in 2002 he was included in the Emirates Panel of International Umpires. A year later he was asked to umpire at the Cricket World Cup in South Africa, and was chosen to be the fourth umpire in the final between Australia and India. Shortly after this he was duly promoted to the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires, of which he was a member until 2013. He reprised his role as fourth umpire in the 2007 Cricket World Cup final Bowden was involved in an incident at the 2006 Brisbane Ashes test while standing at the square leg fielding position, when knocked to the ground by a ball hit by Geraint Jones.

He was selected as one of the twenty umpires to stand in matches during the 2015 Cricket World Cup.

He was a member of the International Panel of Umpires and Referees until June 2016, when he was demoted to New Zealand&#x27;s national panel.

On 24 December 2020, he umpired the Dream 11 domestic T20 competition opening double-header between Wellington Firebirds and Auckland Aces as both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sides were both featured. In October 2023, Bowden become the first New Zealand umpire to officiate in 200 first-class matches.

Suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, Bowden is known for his distinctive umpire signalling and his &quot;crooked finger dismissal&quot;. He has drawn both praise and criticism for his style, with Dave Richardson calling him &quot;one of the best performers of the entire tournament&quot;, while Martin Crowe referred to him as a &quot;&#x27;Bozo the Clown&#x27; character&quot;. In 2006, he headed a campaign to raise money and awareness about the disease.

<doc id="304025" wikidata="Q1042743" url="?curid=304025" title="Carlos Beltrán">
<text>Carlos Iván Beltrán (; born April 24, 1977) is a Puerto Rican former professional baseball outfielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as an outfielder from 1998 to 2017 for the Kansas City Royals, Houston Astros, New York Mets, San Francisco Giants, St. Louis Cardinals, New York Yankees, and Texas Rangers. A right-handed thrower and switch hitter, Beltrán stands tall and weighs .

Beltrán was the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year in 1999 while with the Royals. He was named to nine MLB All-Star Games and won three Gold Glove Awards and two Silver Slugger Awards. Beltrán was the fifth player to reach both 400 home runs and 300 stolen bases and just the fourth switch hitter with 400 home runs. He has the highest success rate in stealing bases (88.3%) of any major league player with 300 or more career attempts. He also joined the 30–30 club in 2004. In 2013, Beltrán was named the recipient of the prestigious Roberto Clemente Award. He retired after the 2017 season, winning a World Series title with the Astros.

Beltrán was among the best all-time statistical hitters in postseason games, which has earned him nicknames such as &quot;the New Mr. October&quot;, &quot;Mr. October Jr.&quot;, &quot;Señor Octubre&quot;, and &quot;the real Mr. October&quot; from the media. In 56 plate appearances during the 2004 playoffs, he scored 21 runs to set a record for most runs scored in one postseason (Jose Altuve has since tied the record).

Following retirement from baseball, Beltrán was hired as the manager of his former team, the Mets, for the 2020 season. However, he stepped down without managing a game after the Astros sign stealing scandal broke in late 2019. While Beltrán was the only player to be named in the investigation report, the extent of his involvement in the scheme has been disputed. Beltrán was briefly an analyst for YES Network in 2022 and has been a member of the Mets&#x27; front office since 2023.

==Early life==
In his youth, Beltrán excelled in many sports, with volleyball and baseball being his favorites. At his father&#x27;s urging, he gave up volleyball to concentrate on baseball when he was seventeen. He was originally a shortstop before moving to the outfield. He graduated from Fernando Callejo High School in 1995.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
The Kansas City Royals selected Beltrán in the second round of the 1995 Major League Baseball draft. After he signed, the Royals assigned him to the Gulf Coast Royals of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League. Originally only hitting right-handed, he batted .276 with no home runs. During the off-season, Beltrán taught himself to hit left-handed, with advice from New York Yankees outfielder Bernie Williams and Royals minor league coach Kevin Long. In 1996, he played for the Spokane Indians of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League, and the Lansing Lugnuts of the Class A Midwest League. In 1997 he spent the entire season playing for the Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League. He began the 1998 season with Wilmington and received a promotion to the Wichita Wranglers of the Class AA Texas League.

===Kansas City Royals (1998–2004)===
====1998–99====
Beltrán made his major league debut on September 14, 1998, playing 15 games. Unlike many players, he never played in Triple-A. In 14 games of the 1998 baseball year, Beltrán got 16 hits, 5 doubles, 3 triples, and 7 RBIs with a .276 batting average during his time in the majors.

By 1999, he won the job as the Royals&#x27; starting center fielder and leadoff hitter. He displayed significant power by midsummer and was moved to the #3 slot in the batting order. Beltrán won the American League Rookie of the Year award, batting .293 with 22 home runs, 108 runs batted in (RBIs) and 27 stolen bases in 156 games played. On September 27, 1999, Beltrán made the final out at Tiger Stadium, striking out against relief pitcher Todd Jones as the Detroit Tigers beat the Royals 8–2.

====2000–2003====
Injuries restricted Beltrán to 98 games during the 2000 season and he slumped to .247, losing his center field position to the popular Johnny Damon. After Damon was traded to the Oakland Athletics following the season, Beltrán regained his job in 2001 and recaptured his rookie form. He batted .306 with 24 home runs and 101 RBIs in that season, followed by lines of .273-29-105 in 2002 and .307-26-100 in 2003.

====2004====
In 2003, Beltrán batted .194 in April. His luck changed in 2004, as Beltrán began the year with eight home runs and 19 RBIs and was selected as American League Player of the Month for April.

In the first 69 games of the 2004 season, Beltrán batted .278 with 15 homers, 51 RBI, and 14 stolen bases. Playing for a small market club and represented by agent Scott Boras, Beltrán endured trade rumors through the 2003 and 2004 seasons. As the end of his contract neared, the two sides failed to negotiate a long-term deal. Following an interleague doubleheader loss to the last-place Montreal Expos, Royals&#x27; general manager Allard Baird informed reporters that he was preparing to dismantle the team and rebuild it for the 2005 season.

===Houston Astros (2004)===
On June 24, 2004, the Royals traded Beltrán to the Houston Astros in a three-team deal, which also sent relief pitcher Octavio Dotel from the Astros to the Oakland Athletics, while the Royals picked up Oakland minor leaguers (pitcher Mike Wood and third-baseman Mark Teahen) and Astros&#x27; catcher John Buck.

While still a Royal, Beltrán had been selected as an AL starting outfielder for the 2004 All-Star Game. After being traded to the Astros, Beltrán was ruled ineligible for the AL roster and was not listed on the NL roster. However, after NL starter Ken Griffey Jr., went on the disabled list, Beltrán was named his substitute.

For the rest of the 2004 season with the Astros, Beltrán played 90 games, batting .258 with 23 home runs, 53 RBI, and 28 stolen bases. Overall in 2004 combined with both teams he played for, Beltrán played 159 games with a .267 batting average, 38 home runs, 42 stolen bases, 104 RBI, and 121 runs scored.

In the 2004 playoffs, Beltrán tied Barry Bonds&#x27; single post-season record with eight home runs. He hit one in each of the first four games of the National League Championship Series (NLCS) against the St. Louis Cardinals, including the game-winner in Game 4. He hit two home runs in Game 5 of the previous playoff round in the National League Division Series (NLDS) against the Atlanta Braves; it was the first time Beltran or the Astros had won a postseason series and his performance was the first time that an Astro had hit two home runs in a postseason game. In total, Beltrán clubbed at least one home run in a record-setting five consecutive postseason games, outnumbered only by Daniel Murphy&#x27;s home runs in six consecutive postseason games in 2015. In 12 games in the 2004 playoffs, Beltrán batted .435 with 14 RBIs and 21 runs scored.

===New York Mets (2005–2011)===
====2005–06====

Following the 2004 season, Beltrán became a free agent. The New York Yankees were tipped as favorites and Beltrán allegedly offered them a $19 million discount. The Yankees declined and the crosstown New York Mets signed him to a seven-year, $119-million contract, the biggest in franchise history at the time. It became the tenth contract in baseball history to surpass $100 million.

On August 11, 2005, in a game against the San Diego Padres at Petco Park, Beltrán was seriously injured after colliding head-to-head with fellow Mets outfielder Mike Cameron when both were diving to catch a ball in shallow right center field. Cameron missed the rest of the season with a concussion, temporary loss of vision, and two broken cheekbones. Beltrán suffered vertigo for a while, although both players eventually recovered.

A quadriceps injury bothered him most of the 2005 season and limited his speed. In 582 at bats, Beltrán&#x27;s stats included career lows in batting average (.266), home runs (16), RBIs (78), runs scored (83), and stolen bases (17). Despite the limited participation, he was still voted to his second All-Star team.

Beltrán played for Puerto Rico in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, joining Carlos Delgado, Bernie Williams, Javier Vázquez, Iván Rodríguez and others on the team managed by St. Louis Cardinals third base coach José Oquendo. His 2006 season was an upgrade on his first year in New York. Boosted by 10 home runs in May, he surpassed his home run total from the previous year before the season was half over. Beltrán&#x27;s performance secured him a spot in the 2006 All-Star Game, his third. Five other Mets joined him, including three as starters. Beltrán was a standout for the NL as the only batter with multiple hits, along with two stolen bases. He scored the go-ahead run that gave the National League a 2–1 lead in the third inning, though the American League won the game. He hit grand slams in consecutive games on July 16 and 18, becoming the 23rd player to do so. Another grand slam at the end of July made him only the third Met to hit three in one season. Beltrán continued to produce with a walk-off home run against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 22, off Cardinals closer Jason Isringhausen. It was Beltrán&#x27;s second walk-off of the season, following a 16th-inning gamewinner against the Phillies.

Beltrán&#x27;s 41 home runs tied the Mets&#x27; single season record for homers, matching Todd Hundley&#x27;s total in 1996. (This record was broken by Pete Alonso in 2019.) His 127 runs scored gave him sole possession of the Mets&#x27; single season franchise mark. He and teammate José Reyes won the Silver Slugger Award at their respective positions. He also tied for the major league lead in times reached base on an error (13).

Beltrán&#x27;s defense was also recognized during the 2006 season, as he received his first Gold Glove award. He made only two errors in 372 chances to give him a .995 fielding percentage, and recorded 13 outfield assists and six double plays. He also won a Fielding Bible Award as the top fielding center fielder in MLB. Beltrán came fourth in the National League MVP award voting, behind winner Ryan Howard, Albert Pujols, and Lance Berkman. Returning to the playoffs, Beltrán hit three home runs in the NLCS, bringing his career playoff total to 11 home runs in 22 games. However, with the bases loaded and two outs in the ninth inning of Game 7 of the NLCS against the Cardinals, Beltrán struck out looking against Adam Wainwright, ending the New York Mets season.

====2007–08====
In 2007, Beltrán hit below .230 from May to July. However, he improved in August and September, finishing with a .276 batting average and 112 RBIs. In July, he made his fourth All-Star Game appearance and upon the conclusion of the season, won his second straight Gold Glove award.
In 2008, Beltrán batted .284 with 27 home runs and 112 RBI. In the final game before the All-Star game, Beltrán hit his 15th home run of the season. On August 29, Beltrán collected all five RBIs for the Mets including a grand slam with two outs in the 9th to give the Mets a 5–2 lead. The Mets won this game 5–4. Beltrán hit the last and only Mets home run in the final regular season game at Shea Stadium (the last home run was by Dan Uggla). The home run was a two-run shot that tied the game 2–2 against the Florida Marlins. Beltrán won his third straight Gold Glove award in the outfield for the Mets. He also won his second Fielding Bible Award as the top MLB center fielder in 2008.

====2009–2011====
Beltrán recorded his 1,000th RBI against Scott Olsen (Washington Nationals) with a triple in the third inning on April 24, 2009.

In the voting for the 2009 All Star Game, Beltrán was third among NL outfielders (2,812,295 votes), trailing only Ryan Braun (4,138,559) and Raúl Ibañez (4,053,355).

On January 13, 2010, Beltrán had surgery on his knee and was originally expected to miss 8–12 weeks. The procedure was performed by Beltrán&#x27;s personal physician Dr. Richard Steadman. The Mets stated that the surgery was done without their consent, and the team expressed their disappointment with Beltrán&#x27;s decision. However, Beltrán&#x27;s agent, Scott Boras, claimed that the Mets consented to the procedure. Beltrán played his first game of the 2010 season on July 15.

Due to his declining defense, in 2011, Beltrán was moved from center field to right field. On May 12, 2011, playing against the Colorado Rockies, Beltrán hit three two-run home runs in a 9–5 Mets&#x27; victory. It was the first three-home run game of his career, and he became only the eighth Mets hitter in history to hit three home runs in a single game.

===San Francisco Giants (2011)===

On July 28, 2011, after he waived his no-trade clause, the Mets traded Beltrán to the San Francisco Giants in exchange for pitching prospect Zack Wheeler. The Mets also sent $4 million cash to the Giants to cover Beltrán&#x27;s remaining $6.5 million contract, which expired at the end of the 2011 season.

The day after the trade, Beltrán got his first hit with the Giants (an RBI single to left field in the first inning), going 1-for-5 while playing right field against the Cincinnati Reds. The Giants eventually lost to the Reds 4–3 in thirteen innings.

On September 14, Beltrán hit two solo home runs against San Diego Padres&#x27; starting pitcher Mat Latos. The shot gave him 20 home runs for the season and 300 for his career. Prior to this game, Beltrán had never hit against Latos. Both home runs were hit to the right side of the field with Beltrán batting from the left side. The 299th hit the arcade, and the 300th landed in McCovey Cove which increased the &quot;Splash Hit&quot; count to 59. Both home runs proved to be crucial, as the Giants swept the Padres in a 3-game series, with a score of 3–1. His home runs in the series accounted for 4 out of the 14 runs.

For the rest of the 2011 season with the Giants, Beltrán played 44 games batting .323 with 7 home runs and 18 RBI. Overall in 2011 combined with both teams he played for, Beltrán played 142 total games batting .300 with 22 home runs and 84 RBI.

===St. Louis Cardinals (2012–2013)===
====2012====
On December 22, 2011, Beltrán agreed to a two-year deal with the St. Louis Cardinals worth $26 million which included a full no-trade clause. After Beltrán signed with the Cardinals, he attained numerous milestones, personal as well other firsts.

On April 4, 2012 Opening Day, Beltrán recorded the first-ever hit in a regular-season game at Marlins Park against Josh Johnson of the Miami Marlins. Beltrán was named NL Player of the Week on May 14 after he hit .360 (9-for-25) with six home runs, 13 RBIs, eight runs, 30 total bases for a 1.200 slugging percentage and 1.648 OPS in the previous six games. He hit safely in five of the six games and homered in four of them. It was his ninth career weekly award, and sixth in the NL.
On June 1, in his first game in New York after leaving the Mets, the crowd gave him a standing ovation. In one notable moment, a Beltrán batted ball touched the outside part of the foul line but was ruled a foul ball in a game in which former teammate, Johan Santana, was credited with throwing the first no-hitter in Mets&#x27; history. Two weeks later, on June 15, while batting against another former team in the Kansas City Royals, Beltrán stole second base in the second inning to become the first switch-hitter in MLB history to attain 300 home runs and 300 stolen bases, and the eighth player overall.

In a June 29 home game versus the Pittsburgh Pirates, he recorded a single in the third inning for his 2,000th hit, becoming the 270th player in MLB history to do so. The day after he got his 2,000th hit, Beltrán collected his 400th double, becoming the 170th player to do so. Beltrán also participated in that year&#x27;s Home Run Derby.

The Mets announced on June 18, 2012, that Beltrán was selected as the starting center fielder for 50th Anniversary Mets All-Time Team.

In the 2012 National League Wild Card Game, his first postseason game since 2006, Beltrán had 1 hit in 4 at-bats, scoring a run in the 4th inning. In the NLDS against the Nationals, Beltrán went 8–18 at the plate with 2 home runs and 4 RBI. Down 5–7 in the 9th inning in game 5 of the NLDS, Beltrán hit a leadoff double off of Drew Storen, eventually scoring two outs later on a Daniel Descalso single. The Cardinals would win the game 9–7.

In the 2012 National League Championship Series, Beltrán batted .300 with 2 RBI and 2 stolen bases. He played in 6 of the 7 games in the series, missing most of game 3 and all of game 4 after suffering a knee injury. Playing in his 3rd NLCS game 7 in his career, Beltrán went 1–4 at the plate as the Cardinals lost 0–9 to the Giants.

====2013====
In 2013, Beltrán played in 145 games with a .296 batting average, 24 home runs and 84 RBI. Beltrán played in his 2,000th game on July 11, 2013. That same month, he was selected to his third straight All-Star Game. In October, Beltrán was the recipient of the Roberto Clemente Award, becoming the fourth Cardinals player to win it, joining Albert Pujols, Ozzie Smith, and Lou Brock.

In the 2013 National League Division Series against the Pirates, Beltrán had 4 hits in 18 at-bats, hitting 2 home runs and 6 RBI in the series. In game 1 of the 2013 National League Championship Series against the Dodgers, Beltrán hit a double at the bottom of the 3rd inning to tie the game 2–2. At the top of the 10th inning, with the game still tied 2–2, Beltrán threw out Mark Ellis at the plate after catching a fly ball, completing a double-play that prevented the Dodgers from taking the lead. At the bottom of the 13th inning, Beltrán hit a walk-off single off of Kenley Jansen, giving the Cardinals a 3–2 victory. For the whole NLCS, Beltrán had 6 hits and 6 RBI in 21 at-bats. The Cardinals won the series 4–2, and Beltrán advanced to the first World Series in his career.

In Game 1 of the 2013 World Series against the Red Sox, Beltrán injured his ribs in the 2nd inning after robbing David Ortiz of a grand slam. Despite the injury, Beltrán would play in all 6 games of the series, batting .294 with 5 hits and 3 RBI as the Cardinals fell to the Red Sox four games to two.

Beltrán filed for free agency after the World Series ended on October 30. On November 9, Beltrán declined a one-year, $14.1 million qualifying offer from the Cardinals, making him a free agent.

===New York Yankees (2014–2016)===
On December 6, 2013, Beltrán agreed to a three-year, $45 million deal to join the New York Yankees, despite receiving a $48 million offer from another team. The deal became official on December 19, 2013.

====2014====
On April 13, 2014, Beltrán played at first base for the first time in his professional career after Francisco Cervelli left the game due to a hamstring injury. On the night of May 12, 2014, Beltrán experienced soreness in his right elbow. It was revealed that the elbow had a bone spur and was immediately given a cortisone shot. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list on May 15, 2014. He was activated on June 5, 2014. To prevent any further damage to the elbow, he was used primarily as a designated hitter for the remainder of the season.

On September 16, 2014, Beltrán left the team for an indefinite period of time due to his wife&#x27;s miscarriage. Limited to 109 games in 2014, Beltrán batted .233 with 15 home runs and 49 RBI. On October 1, 2014, he underwent surgery to remove loose pieces and a bone spur in his right elbow, which required 12 weeks to recover. The procedure was performed by Yankees head team physician, Dr. Christopher Ahmad.

====2015====

Beltrán got off to a slow start in 2015, batting around .200 through April. He slowly improved throughout the season and in September had a batting average over .280. On July 3, Beltrán was placed on the 15-day disabled list with an oblique injury. He was activated on July 19. On August 14 against the Blue Jays, Beltrán hit a pinch-hit go-ahead 3-run home run in the 8th inning. It proved to be the game winner and temporarily put the Yankees back in 1st place. He reached 500 career doubles on August 31 against the Boston Red Sox. Beltrán ended the regular season with 19 home runs, 67 RBIs and a .276 average in 133 games.

In the 2015 American League Wild Card Game against the Astros, Beltrán had 1 hit in 4 at-bats as the Yankees fell to the Astros 3–0.

====2016====
On April 25, 2016, Beltrán became the 84th player to make 10,000 career plate appearances. He collected his 2,473rd career hit on April 27 against the Texas Rangers to pass Ted Simmons for tenth place on the all-time list for switch-hitters. Beltrán hit his 400th career home run against the Chicago White Sox on May 15, the 54th player in MLB history to do, fourth switch hitter, the third Puerto Rican-born player, and the fifth to do so with 300 stolen bases and 500 doubles. On May 28, Beltrán homered for his 2,500th career hit off Matt Moore of the Tampa Bay Rays, joining Roberto Clemente, Ivan Rodriguez and Roberto Alomar as just the fourth Puerto Rican-born player to reach the milestone, and the 99th player overall to reach 2,500 hits. He became the fourth player, after Alex Rodriguez, Barry Bonds and Willie Mays, to reach 2,500 hits, 400 homers, 300 stolen bases and 1,000 walks.
On June 7, Beltrán became the 38th player all time to record 1,000 career extra base hits. He was selected to his ninth All-Star Game at Petco Park in San Diego. In a 5–3 loss to the Boston Red Sox on July 15, he became the 55th player, and fourth switch-hitter, to reach 1,500 RBIs for his career. In 99 games with the Yankees, Beltrán batted .304 with 22 home runs and 64 RBIs.

===Texas Rangers (2016)===
On August 1, 2016, the Yankees traded Beltrán to the Texas Rangers for prospects Dillon Tate, Erik Swanson, and Nick Green. Beltrán hit his first home run for Texas on August 3 against the Baltimore Orioles, also scoring his 1,500th run on the play. Towards the end of the season, Beltrán stated that he had &quot;no plans to retire&quot;, in contrast to his statements before the season. Beltrán ended the season with a .295 average, 29 home runs and 93 RBIs in 151 games between the Yankees and Rangers.

In the 2016 ALDS, Beltrán batted 2-for-11 with one RBI in three games as the Toronto Blue Jays swept the Rangers.

===Second stint with the Astros (2017)===
On December 3, 2016, Beltrán signed a one-year, $16 million contract to return to the Houston Astros for the 2017 season as their designated hitter. On July 17, after not having played in the field in two months, his teammates held a mock funeral for his glove.

The Astros won 101 games and clinched the AL West division title, marking the second time in franchise history they won at least 100 games. They faced the Boston Red Sox in the best-of-five ALDS. In Game 4 on October 9, Beltrán hit a ninth-inning RBI double that proved to be the deciding run in a 5–4 victory that clinched the ALDS for the Astros.
The Astros overcame one of Beltrán&#x27;s former teams, the Yankees, in the ALCS in seven games. As the Astros advanced to the World Series, it was the second of Beltrán&#x27;s career, where they opposed the Los Angeles Dodgers. During the series, Beltrán registered three plate appearances over three games, going 0–3. The Astros defeated the Dodgers in seven games, making Beltrán a World Series champion. Beltrán announced his retirement from playing on November 13, 2017.

Two years later, it was revealed via a sign stealing scandal that the Astros had broken MLB rules during the 2017 season. According to the report, an electronic sign-stealing scheme was implemented during the season, allegedly spearheaded by a coach and a &quot;veteran player&quot;. Many have speculated that the coach and player in question were Alex Cora and Beltrán, with some Astros players&#x27; testimonies lining up with some of their speculations. When Major League Baseball confirmed that the Astros had stolen signs illegally, Beltrán was the only player named in the commissioner&#x27;s report. Beltrán apologized for his role in the scandal.

===Career statistics===
In 2,586 games over 20 seasons, Beltrán posted a .279 batting average (2,725-for-9,768) with 1,582 runs, 565 doubles, 78 triples, 435 home runs, 1,587 RBI, 312 stolen bases, 1,084 bases on balls, .350 on-base percentage and .486 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .986 fielding percentage playing primarily at center and right field. In 65 postseason games, Beltrán batted .307 (66-for-215) with 45 runs, 15 doubles, 16 home runs, 42 RBI, 11 stolen bases and 37 walks. He broke the 1.000 OPS mark in four different playoff series. Beltrán also had a 100% stolen base percentage (11-for-11) during the playoffs, which are the most stolen bases without being caught.

==International career==
Beltrán has appeared in the four editions of the World Baseball Classic (2006, 2009, 2013, 2017) for Team Puerto Rico. In the 2017 World Baseball Classic, he batted 4th in the lineup as their designated hitter. Following the conclusion of the tournament, which was won by United States upon beating Puerto Rico in the final, Beltrán was named to the 2017 All-World Baseball Classic team.

==Post-playing career==
Following the 2017 season, the New York Yankees&#x27; managerial position became available, for which Beltrán interviewed. The Yankees eventually selected Aaron Boone to be the manager. In December 2018, the Yankees hired Beltrán as a special adviser to general manager Brian Cashman.

On November 1, 2019, the Mets hired Beltrán as their manager to replace Mickey Callaway, signing him to a three-year contract with a club option for a fourth year. However, on January 16, 2020, before Beltrán ever managed a game, he and the Mets mutually agreed to part ways after he was the only player implicated by name for his role in the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal.

On January 28, 2022, the YES Network hired Beltran as a game analyst.

On February 6, 2023, he left the Yankees broadcast team and joined the Mets front office.

==Personal life==
Beltrán and his wife Jessica have two daughters and one son. They reside in New York City. Beltrán&#x27;s cousin Rey Fuentes is also a baseball player and also played for the Royals. A nephew, Matthew Lugo, was drafted by the Red Sox in 2019.

Beltrán is a Christian. While sliding into second base for his 300th career steal on June 15, 2012, joining the 300–300 club, a cross necklace popped out of his jersey, and after the game, he told a reporter &quot;all the glory&quot; was God&#x27;s. 

In 2004, Beltrán was one of 24 athletes who endorsed George W. Bush&#x27;s reelection campaign.

Since establishing his foundation, Beltrán began a fund with part of his salary, intending to establish a high school focused on developing young athletes. Construction of the Carlos Beltrán Baseball Academy began in 2009, in the municipality of Florida, Puerto Rico. Beltrán donated over $4 million to the academy, built on of land donated by the local government. The school opened in 2011 and graduated its first class in June 2013. It accepts students between the ages of 14 and 18 years, with a curriculum that includes instruction by MLB players.

In 2017, Beltrán was named winner of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;&#x27;s inaugural Hope Award for his work in assisting Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.

<doc id="304033" wikidata="Q1313477" url="?curid=304033" title="Iron lung">
<text>An iron lung is a type of negative pressure ventilator, a mechanical respirator which encloses most of a person&#x27;s body and varies the air pressure in the enclosed space to stimulate breathing. It assists breathing when muscle control is lost, or the work of breathing exceeds the person&#x27;s ability. Need for this treatment may result from diseases including polio and botulism and certain poisons (for example, barbiturates and tubocurarine).

The use of iron lungs is largely obsolete in modern medicine as more modern breathing therapies have been developed and due to the eradication of polio in most of the world. In 2020 however, the COVID-19 pandemic revived some interest in them as a cheap, readily-producible substitute for positive-pressure ventilators, which were feared to be outnumbered by patients potentially needing temporary artificially assisted respiration.

The iron lung is a large horizontal cylinder designed to stimulate breathing in patients who have lost control of their respiratory muscles. The patient&#x27;s head is exposed outside the cylinder, while the body is sealed inside. Air pressure inside the cylinder is cycled to facilitate inhalation and exhalation. Devices like the Drinker, Emerson, and Both respirators are examples of iron lungs, which can be manually or mechanically powered. Smaller versions, like the cuirass ventilator and jacket ventilator, enclose only the patient&#x27;s torso. Breathing in humans occurs through negative pressure, where the rib cage expands and the diaphragm contracts, causing air to flow in and out of the lungs.

The concept of external negative pressure ventilation was introduced by John Mayow in 1670. The first widely used device was the iron lung, developed by Philip Drinker and Louis Shaw in 1928. Initially used for coal gas poisoning treatment, the iron lung gained fame for treating respiratory failure caused by polio in the mid-20th century. John Haven Emerson introduced an improved and more affordable version in 1931. The Both respirator, a cheaper and lighter alternative to the Drinker model, was invented in Australia in 1937. British philanthropist William Morris financed the production of the Both–Nuffield respirators, donating them to hospitals throughout Britain and the British Empire. During the polio outbreaks of the 1940s and 1950s, iron lungs filled hospital wards, assisting patients with paralyzed diaphragms in their recovery.

Polio vaccination programs and the development of modern ventilators have nearly eradicated the use of iron lungs in the developed world. Positive pressure ventilation systems, which blow air into the patient&#x27;s lungs via intubation, have become more common than negative pressure systems like iron lungs. However, negative pressure ventilation is more similar to normal physiological breathing and may be preferable in rare conditions. , after the death of Paul Alexander, only one patient in the U.S., Martha Lillard, is still using an iron lung. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the shortage of modern ventilators, some enterprises developed prototypes of new, easily producible versions of the iron lung.

==Design and function==


The iron lung is typically a large horizontal cylinder in which a person is laid, with their head protruding from a hole in the end of the cylinder, so that their full head (down to their voice box) is outside the cylinder, exposed to ambient air, and the rest of their body sealed inside the cylinder, where air pressure is continuously cycled up and down to stimulate breathing.

To cause the patient to inhale, air is pumped out of the cylinder, causing a slight vacuum, which causes the patient&#x27;s chest and abdomen to expand (drawing air from outside the cylinder, through the patient&#x27;s exposed nose or mouth, into their lungs). Then, for the patient to exhale, the air inside the cylinder is compressed slightly (or allowed to equalize to ambient room pressure), causing the patient&#x27;s chest and abdomen to partially collapse, forcing air out of the lungs, as the patient exhales the breath through their exposed mouth and nose, outside the cylinder.

Examples of the device include the Drinker respirator, the Emerson respirator, and the Both respirator. Iron lungs can be either manually or mechanically powered, but are normally powered by an electric motor linked to a flexible pumping diaphragm (commonly opposite the end of the cylinder from the patient&#x27;s head). Larger &quot;room-sized&quot; iron lungs were also developed, allowing for simultaneous ventilation of several patients (each with their heads protruding from sealed openings in the outer wall), with sufficient space inside for a nurse or a respiratory therapist to be inside the sealed room, attending the patients.

Smaller, single-patient versions of the iron lung include the so-called &quot;cuirass ventilator&quot; (named for the cuirass, a torso-covering body armor). The cuirass ventilator encloses only the patient&#x27;s torso, or chest and abdomen, but otherwise operates essentially the same as the original, full-sized iron lung. A lightweight variation on the cuirass ventilator is the &quot;jacket ventilator&quot; or &quot;poncho&quot; or &quot;raincoat&quot; ventilator, which uses a flexible, impermeable material (such as plastic or rubber) stretched over a metal or plastic frame over the patient&#x27;s torso.

==Method and use==
Humans, like most mammals, breathe by &quot;negative pressure&quot; breathing: the rib cage expands and the diaphragm contracts, expanding the chest cavity. This causes the pressure in the chest cavity to decrease, and the lungs expand to fill the space. This, in turn, causes the pressure of the air inside the lungs to decrease (it becomes negative, relative to the atmosphere), and air flows into the lungs from the atmosphere: inhalation. When the diaphragm relaxes, the reverse happens and the person exhales. If a person loses part or all of the ability to control the muscles involved, breathing becomes difficult or impossible.

==Invention and early use==
===Initial development===
In 1670, English scientist John Mayow came up with the idea of external negative pressure ventilation. Mayow built a model consisting of bellows and a bladder to pull in and expel air. The first negative pressure ventilator was described by British physician John Dalziel in 1832. Successful use of similar devices was described a few years later. Early prototypes included a hand-operated bellows-driven &quot;Spirophore&quot; designed by Dr Woillez of Paris (1876), and an airtight wooden box designed specifically for the treatment of polio by Dr Stueart of South Africa (1918). Stueart&#x27;s box was sealed at the waist and shoulders with clay and powered by motor-driven bellows.

===Drinker and Shaw tank===
The first of these devices to be widely used however was developed in 1928 by Phillip Drinker and Louis Shaw of the United States. The iron lung, often referred to in the early days as the &quot;Drinker respirator&quot;, was invented by Philip Drinker (1894–1972) and Louis Agassiz Shaw Jr., professors of industrial hygiene at the Harvard School of Public Health. The machine was powered by an electric motor with air pumps from two vacuum cleaners. The air pumps changed the pressure inside a rectangular, airtight metal box, pulling air in and out of the lungs.
The first clinical use of the Drinker respirator on a human was on October 12, 1928, at the Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital in the US. The subject was an eight-year-old girl who was nearly dead as a result of respiratory failure due to polio. Her dramatic recovery within less than a minute of being placed in the chamber helped popularize the new device.

====Variations====
Boston manufacturer Warren E. Collins began production of the iron lung that year. Although it was initially developed for the treatment of victims of coal gas poisoning, it was most famously used in the mid-20th century for the treatment of respiratory failure caused by polio.

Danish physiologist August Krogh, upon returning to Copenhagen in 1931 from a visit to New York where he saw the Drinker machine in use, constructed the first Danish respirator designed for clinical purposes. Krogh&#x27;s device differed from Drinker&#x27;s in that its motor was powered by water from the city pipelines. Krogh also made an infant respirator version.

In 1931, John Haven Emerson (1906–1997) introduced an improved and less expensive iron lung. The Emerson iron lung had a bed that could slide in and out of the cylinder as needed, and the tank had portal windows which allowed attendants to reach in and adjust limbs, sheets, or hot packs. Drinker and Harvard University sued Emerson, claiming he had infringed on patent rights. Emerson defended himself by making the case that such lifesaving devices should be freely available to all. Emerson also demonstrated that every aspect of Drinker&#x27;s patents had been published or used by others at earlier times. Since an invention must be novel to be patentable, prior publication/use of the invention meant it was not novel and therefore unpatentable. Emerson won the case, and Drinker&#x27;s patents were declared invalid.

The United Kingdom&#x27;s first iron lung was designed in 1934 by Robert Henderson, an Aberdeen doctor. Henderson had seen a demonstration of the Drinker respirator in the early 1930s and built a device of his own upon his return to Scotland. Four weeks after its construction, the Henderson respirator was used to save the life of a 10-year-old boy from New Deer, Aberdeenshire who had poliomyelitis. Despite this success, Henderson was reprimanded for secretly using hospital facilities to build the machine.

===Both respirator===
The Both respirator, a negative pressure ventilator, was invented in 1937 when Australia&#x27;s epidemic of poliomyelitis created an immediate need for more ventilating machines to compensate for respiratory paralysis. Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs or 340 kg), bulky, and expensive. An adult machine cost about $2,000 in the US in 1930 (), and about £1,500 sterling in Europe in the mid-1950s (). The cost of one delivered to Melbourne in 1936 was AU£2,000 (). Consequently, there were few of the Drinker devices in Australia and Europe.

The South Australia Health Department asked Adelaide brothers Edward and Don Both to create an inexpensive &quot;iron lung&quot;. Biomedical engineer Edward Both designed and developed a cabinet respirator made of plywood that worked similarly to the Drinker device, with the addition of a bi-valved design which allowed temporary access to the patient&#x27;s body. Far cheaper to make (only £100) than the Drinker machine, the Both Respirator also weighed less and could be constructed and transported more quickly. Such was the demand for the machines that they were often used by patients within an hour of production.

Visiting London in 1938 during another polio epidemic, Both produced additional respirators there which attracted the attention of William Morris (Lord Nuffield), a British motor manufacturer and philanthropist. Nuffield, intrigued by the design, financed the production of approximately 1700 machines at his car factory in Cowley and donated them to hospitals throughout all parts of Britain and the British Empire. Soon, the Both–Nuffield respirators were able to be produced by the thousand at about one-thirteenth the cost of the American design. By the early 1950s, there were over 700 Both-Nuffield iron lungs in the United Kingdom, but only 50 Drinker devices.

=== Polio epidemic ===
Rows of iron lungs filled hospital wards at the height of the polio outbreaks of the 1940s and 1950s, helping children, and some adults, with bulbar polio and bulbospinal polio. A polio patient with a paralyzed diaphragm would typically spend two weeks inside an iron lung while recovering.
===Outcomes===
Patients treated in iron lungs for polio experienced varying outcomes depending on the severity of their condition and the duration of their treatment: Most patients needed the iron lung for only a few weeks or months. However, a minority with permanently paralyzed chest muscles faced a lifetime of confinement in the iron lung. Learning to breathe again outside the iron lung was often a difficult and frightening process for patients. Most gradually built up strength in their chest muscles through therapy, allowing them to spend increasing amounts of time outside the device. Some patients were able to fully recover and end the treatment. In severe cases, fatal complications set in, especially aspiration pneumonia and central respiratory center involvement. In the late 20th century vaccination programs have virtually eradicated new cases of poliomyelitis in the developed world. Because of this, the development of modern ventilators, and widespread use of tracheal intubation and tracheotomy, the iron lung has mostly disappeared from modern medicine. In 1959, 1,200 people were using tank respirators in the United States, but by 2004 that number had decreased to just 39. By 2014, only 10 people were left with an iron lung.

==Modern development and usage==

=== Replacement ===
Positive pressure ventilation systems are now more common than negative pressure systems. Positive pressure ventilators work by blowing air into the patient&#x27;s lungs via intubation through the airway; they were used for the first time in Blegdams Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark, during a polio outbreak in 1952. It proved a success and by 1953 it had superseded the iron lung throughout Europe. 

The positive pressure ventilator has the asset that the patient&#x27;s airways can be cleared and the patient can be in a semi-seated position in the acute phase of polio. The fatality rate on using iron lungs on respiratory paralysis patients could be as high as 80% to 90%, most patients either drowning in their own saliva as their swallowing muscles had been paralyzed, or from organ shutdown due to acidosis due to accumulated carbon dioxide in bloodstream due to clogged airways. By using the positive pressure ventilators instead of iron lungs, the Copenhagen hospital team was able to decrease the fatality rate eventually down to 11%. The first patient treated this way was a 12-year-old girl named Vivi Ebert, who had bulbar polio.

The iron lung now has a marginal place in modern respiratory therapy. Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern mechanical ventilators that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients&#x27; movements or caregivers&#x27; ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does.

=== Continued use ===
Despite the advantages of positive ventilation systems, negative pressure ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing and results in a more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions, such as central hypoventilation syndrome, in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no autonomic control of breathing. At least one reported polio patient, Dianne Odell, had a spinal deformity that caused the use of mechanical ventilators to be contraindicated.

At least a few patients today still use the older machines, often in their homes, despite the occasional difficulty of finding replacement parts.

Joan Headley of Post-Polio Health International said that as of May 28, 2008, about 30 patients in the US were still using an iron lung. That figure may be inaccurately low; Houston alone had 19 iron lung patients living at home in 2008.

Martha Mason of Lattimore, North Carolina, died on May 4, 2009, after spending 61 of her 72 years in an iron lung.

On October 30, 2009, June Middleton of Melbourne, Australia, who had been entered in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the person who spent the longest time in an iron lung, died aged 83, having spent more than 60 years in her iron lung.

In 2013, the Post-Polio Health International (PHI) organizations estimated that only six to eight iron lung users were in the United States; as of 2017, its executive director knew of none. Press reports then emerged, however, of at least three (perhaps the last three) users of such devices, sparking interest amongst those in the makerspace community such as Naomi Wu in the manufacture of the obsolete components, particularly the gaskets.

In 2021, the National Public Radio programs &quot;Radio Diaries&quot; and &quot;All Things Considered&quot; gave a report on Martha Lillard, one of the last remaining Americans depending on the daily use of an iron lung, which she had been using since 1953. In her interview, she reported that she was having problems obtaining replacement parts to keep her machine working properly.

On March 11, 2024, Paul Alexander of Dallas, Texas, United States, died at the age of 78. He had been confined to an iron lung for 72 years from the age of six, longer than anyone, and was the last man living in an iron lung. With his death, Martha Lillard is the only person in the U.S. known to use an iron lung.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
In early 2020, reacting to the COVID-19 pandemic, to address the urgent global shortage of modern ventilators (needed for patients with advanced, severe COVID-19), some enterprises developed prototypes of new, readily-producible versions of the iron lung. These developments included:

* a compact, torso-sized &quot;exovent&quot; developed by a team in the United Kingdom, which included the University of Warwick, the Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital, the Marshall Aerospace and Defence Group, and the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, along with teams of medical clinicians, academics, manufacturers, engineers and citizen scientists
* a full-size iron lung developed in the United States by a team led by Hess Services, Inc., of Hays, Kansas

<text>Albert Isidore Meltzer (7 January 1920 – 7 May 1996) was an English anarcho-communist activist and writer.

==Early life==
Meltzer was born in Hackney, London, of Jewish ancestry, and educated at The Latymer School, Edmonton. He was attracted to anarchism at the age of fifteen as a direct result of taking boxing lessons where he met Billy Campbell, a seaman, boxer and anarchist. 

As the Spanish Revolution turned into the Spanish Civil War, Meltzer became active organising solidarity appeals. He involved himself with smuggling arms from Hamburg to the CNT in Spain and acted as a contact for the Spanish anarchist intelligence services in Britain. At this time he had a part as an extra in Leslie Howard&#x27;s film &quot;Pimpernel Smith&quot;, as Howard wanted more authentic actors playing the anarchists. In the Second World War he registered as a conscientious objector on 9 March 1940, but later renounced his objection, enlisting in the Pioneer Corps in 1945. He took part in a mutiny in Cairo in late 1946.

==Views==
Meltzer believed that the only true type of anarchism was communistic. He opposed the individualist anarchism of people such as Benjamin Tucker, believing that the private police that some individualists support would constitute a government.

==Activism==
Albert Meltzer was a contributor in the 1950s to the long-running anarchist paper &quot;Freedom&quot; before leaving in 1965 to start his own venture Wooden Shoe Press. Soon Meltzer was to be involved in a long and bitter dispute with fellow anarchist and former comrade at Freedom Press Vernon Richards which entangled many of their associates and the organisations with which they were involved and continued after both their deaths. Although the feud started in a dispute arising from the possibility of Wooden Shoe moving into Freedom premises, there were also political differences. Meltzer advocated a more firebrand and proletarian variety of anarchism than Richards and often denounced him and the Freedom collective as &quot;liberals&quot;.

Meltzer was a co-founder of the anarchist newspaper &quot;Black Flag&quot; and was a prolific writer on anarchist topics. Amongst his books were &quot;Anarchism, Arguments For and Against&quot; (originally published by Cienfuegos Press), &quot;The Floodgates of Anarchy&quot; (co-written with Stuart Christie) and his autobiography, &quot;I Couldn&#x27;t Paint Golden Angels&quot;, published by AK Press shortly before his death.

Meltzer also was involved in the founding of the Anarchist Black Cross. The imprisonment of Stuart Christie, jailed in 1964 for his part in a plot to assassinate Francisco Franco, led to the spotlight being placed on anarchist resistance and the fate of other anarchist prisoners. Meltzer campaigned for Christie&#x27;s release and when he was freed in 1967 Christie joined with Albert to launch the Anarchist Black Cross, to call for solidarity with those anarchists left behind in prison. This solidarity gave practical help, such as food and medicine, to the prisoners, and helped force the Spanish state to apply its own parole rules. One of the first prisoners the Anarchist Black Cross helped free was Miguel Garcia, a veteran of the Spanish anarchist resistance, as well as wartime resistance in France. After serving 20 years in Spanish jails he moved to London to work with the Anarchist Black Cross. At the time, Albert was a printworker—a copytaker with the conservative &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;—and managed to get Garcia work in the trade.

Meltzer also helped to found the Kate Sharpley Library. He was involved in producing the library&#x27;s publications, and helped shape its philosophy.

He joined the anarcho-syndicalist Direct Action Movement in the early 80s and was a member of it, and its successor organisation the Solidarity Federation until his death. He was originally a member of the Central London Direct Action Movement branch, but when that wound up he joined the Deptford branch, as he lived in Lewisham. He died after a stroke at the 1996 Solidarity Federation Conference in Weston-super-Mare. His biography &quot;I Couldn&#x27;t Paint Golden Angels: Sixty Years of Commonplace Life and Anarchist Agitation&quot; was published in 1996, with illustrations by Chris Pig.

Acting on behalf of – and with – the boy&#x27;s natural father, in 1983 he was charged with harbouring an 8-year-old boy who had been kidnapped by his birth mother from his adoptive mother on the way to school. He was acquitted. The birth mother was under the mistaken belief that she could not be convicted of kidnapping her natural child, the law having changed weeks earlier. She was later acquitted because she was under the mistaken belief that her son was being abused. Reporting of the case in City Limits described Meltzer as a &#x27;gentle and generous soul who is one of the leading figures in British anarchism&#x27;. Police examination of seized diaries and address books led them to interview a doctor specialising in diseases of the gums, something Meltzer himself attributed to his poor handwriting and the similarity of the words gun and gum.

<text>The Brotherhood of Mutants (originally known as the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, sometimes referred to as the BoEM or B.O.E.M.) is a fictional group of mutants appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The Brotherhood are among the chief adversaries of the X-Men.

While the group&#x27;s roster and ideology have varied from incarnation to incarnation, most versions of the Brotherhood are generally founded and led by the mutant Magneto as a supervillain team or organization that believes in mutant superiority over humans at any costs. They are almost always at odds with the more peaceful X-Men, though on rare occasions, the two sides have allied against a common threat, most notably Apocalypse. Among the Mutants who are frequently depicted as members of the Brotherhood are Mystique, Toad, Blob, Pyro, Mastermind, Quicksilver, and Scarlet Witch.

The original Brotherhood was depicted as Magneto&#x27;s primary allies in his early battles with the X-Men in comics published in the 1960s. The original Brotherhood was ultimately disbanded, with Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch going on to become members of the Avengers. In 1981, the Brotherhood of Mutants was revived under the leadership of Mastermind, while the group&#x27;s most visible incarnation during the early 1990s was led by Toad.

The Brotherhood of Mutants has also appeared on several animated series featuring the X-Men and has been Magneto’s group in the recent &quot;X-Men&quot; film series.

==Publication history==
The original Brotherhood of Evil Mutants was created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-writer Jack Kirby and first appeared in &quot;X-Men&quot; #4 (March 1964).

== Ideology ==
While later incarnations of the Brotherhood promoted the group&#x27;s existence as a political and ideological rival to Professor Charles Xavier&#x27;s dream of peace with humans, the group was originally conceived as simply a small, but powerful army of minions gathered by Magneto to aid in his schemes for world domination. But since the group&#x27;s second incarnation, the group has become a much more politically motivated group designed for use of violence to provide justice and lead a &#x27;mutant revolution&#x27; against mankind.

One of the greater ironies of the group has been its use of &quot;Evil&quot; in its name. When his decision to name the group was brought up in an interview, Stan Lee simply said &quot;We were kind of corny in those days.&quot; Since the early 1990s, writers have attempted to explain this away by having Toad describe it as irony, based upon the perceived notion that all mutants are &quot;evil.&quot; Later writers have opted instead to simply drop &quot;Evil&quot; from the group&#x27;s name and refer to the group as &quot;The Brotherhood of Mutants&quot; or simply the Brotherhood. In Earth-X, Uatu explained that Magneto chose it so that, as the opposing side, Charles would be forced to assume the role of &quot;Good,&quot; and that Magneto believed that by locking Charles into absolutes of morality, he could manipulate him.

Many of the group&#x27;s members have been shown to be past victims of anti-mutant prejudice, which has made the group a haven for many mutants who feel they are outcasts and pariahs. While many of these outcast mutants have willingly embraced the violent aspects of the Brotherhood&#x27;s ideology, several have ultimately rejected it and left the group because of it. Most notably, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch left the group due to their disillusionment with Magneto&#x27;s ideology to join the Avengers, a group of heroes dedicated to protecting the world as opposed to ruling it.

==Fictional team history==
===Magneto&#x27;s Brotherhood===
The original leader of the team was Magneto, a mutant with the ability to control magnetic fields. It would later be revealed that Magneto was a Holocaust survivor, explaining his distrust of humanity because of the actions done by the Nazi Party and its inability to accept those who are different. The other members of the original team were Quicksilver, who can move and think at incredible speeds, his twin sister, the Scarlet Witch, who has the power to affect probability fields, the Toad, a sniveling villain with incredible jumping ability and a medieval costume, and Mastermind, with the power to create illusions of sight, smell, taste, touch and sound. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch had joined after Magneto saved Scarlet Witch from a mob who believed she was a witch after she accidentally made a house burst into flame. She joined to repay the debt, and Quicksilver joined to keep her safe.

Time and again, the Brotherhood clashed with the original X-Men team (consisting of Cyclops, Angel, Beast, Iceman and Marvel Girl), in their first appearance taking control of a small country with the aid of Mastermind creating an illusion of an army. They captured Angel and took him to their base, known as Asteroid M, but he was rescued. They tried to recruit the Sub-Mariner, and then the Blob, but the X-Men succeeded against them. Finally Magneto and Toad were captured by an extraterrestrial being called the Stranger, who they at first believed was a powerful mutant, but he revealed himself to be an alien. Mastermind had been turned to a block of solid matter by the Stranger, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch left the team and later joined the Avengers. Later, back on Earth, Magneto reorganized the team three times, including such mutants as Blob and Unus the Untouchable, as well as the Savage Land mutate Lorelei, and creating a team that was later alternately called Mutant Force and the Resistants. Following a battle with the Defenders, the members of the Brotherhood were all transformed into infants by Alpha. The babies were brought to Muir Island, where they were placed under the care of Moira MacTaggert. Magneto was later restored to adulthood by Erik the Red, and quickly escaped MacTaggert&#x27;s research facility. During this incident, the other members of the Brotherhood also regained their adult forms, but discovered that Magneto had abandoned them. Without their leader, the Brotherhood soon teamed up with the Vanisher as part of a plot to get revenge on the X-Men, but were beaten by the Champions. After this defeat, the Brotherhood was disbanded, and its remaining members were imprisoned.

===Mystique&#x27;s Brotherhood===
The shapeshifting mutant Mystique later organized her own Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Members included Pyro, Blob, Avalanche, Destiny and Rogue. This team (minus Rogue, who had defected to the X-Men) later became the core membership of the government-sponsored team called Freedom Force. As Freedom Force, their membership briefly included Spiral and the second Spider-Woman, and later included Super Sabre, the Crimson Commando, and Stonewall. This group both fought and teamed up with several heroic groups, including the Avengers, but ultimately disbanded after Destiny, Super Sabre and Stonewall were killed in action, Mystique faked her death, the Crimson Commando was crippled and the Blob and Pyro were abandoned on a mission in Iraq.

===Toad&#x27;s Brotherhood===
The Toad also organized a Brotherhood of Evil Mutants of his own at one point, including the Blob and Pyro, a woman named Phantazia who could disrupt electronics and superhuman powers, and the vampiric humanoid Pteranodon called Sauron, who is not an actual mutant. Toad&#x27;s Brotherhood was concerned mostly with hatching revenge schemes against the X-teams, but was repeatedly defeated by X-Force, X-Factor, Darkhawk, Spider-Man, and Sleepwalker.

===Havok&#x27;s Brotherhood===
After being captured and subjected to intensive brainwashing by the Dark Beast, Havok formed his own short-lived Brotherhood of Mutants whose membership included himself, the Dark Beast, Fatale, and, briefly, Aurora, Random, Ever, and X-Man. This incarnation was the first Brotherhood to omit the &quot;Evil&quot; from its name. Despite Jean Grey&#x27;s proclamation that Havok was acting of his own free will as well as the plot point of Dark Beast brainwashing Havok, it was ultimately revealed that Havok formed the team as part of a sting operation designed to find out the illegal experiments the Dark Beast was performing and fell apart when Havok and the Dark Beast finally clashed.

===Professor X&#x27;s Brotherhood===
The following incarnation included new members the Mimic and Post as well as Blob and Toad. They freed Charles Xavier from prison and helped the X-Men against the animated Cerebro, who had created a team of fake X-Men. They later cooperated with Mystique in an attempt to capture the Machine Man. The team disbanded shortly afterwards.

During this time period, it was revealed that the teleporter named Astra had been a member of the original Brotherhood, providing Magneto with the technology used to create Asteroid M and locating potential recruits, including Nightcrawler. Though she was in love with Magneto, he did not love her. This rejection led to her quitting the team and served as the motivation behind her creation of the Magneto clone Joseph.

===Mystique&#x27;s Second Brotherhood===
During the threat of the Legacy Virus, Mystique organized another Brotherhood, drawing members from nearly every incarnation like Avalanche, Blob, Toad, and Post and adding Sabretooth and Martinique Jason to the lineup. A training session also showed a new Super Sabre and Crimson Commando, but they were not included on the mission. This Brotherhood attempted to kill Senator Robert Kelly. This plot was thwarted by Cable, Gambit, Beast, Colossus, and Pyro (who died from the Legacy Virus saving Senator Kelly from Post), but managed to assassinate Moira MacTaggert before they were disbanded.

===The Brotherhood===
Later, a short-lived Marvel series called &quot;The Brotherhood&quot; featured a large group of mutant terrorists, unrelated to any other version of the Brotherhood. The group was founded by the mutants Hoffman, Orwell and Marshal, but Marshal left the group and became a government agent. Hoffman hid his identity under the alias &quot;X&quot;. Marshal had the orders to take down the Brotherhood, but was really planning on killing Hoffman and becoming the new &quot;X&quot;. This series was cancelled after nine issues, at which point all members had either been killed in the power struggle between Hoffman and Marshal or by the publicity-driven X-Force (later renamed X-Statix).

===Mystique&#x27;s Third Brotherhood===
The next incarnation of the Brotherhood was led by Mystique again and included Avalanche, Blob, Mastermind, and new member Fever Pitch. This Brotherhood had infiltrated the X-Corps and took over the group, before it was defeated by the X-Men and Mystique sucked into another dimension by X-Corps recruit Abyss (ironically landing the two into the arms of Azazel, who was the father of both Abyss and Mystique&#x27;s biological son Nightcrawler). Following her being rescued from her former lover&#x27;s realm, Mystique would become a reluctant agent of Professor X, doing black ops missions for him. While employed, Mystique claimed that the second and third Brotherhood formed by her were actually formed by someone trying to frame her, something Xavier dismissed as lies designed by Mystique to gain sympathy from Xavier.

===Xorn&#x27;s Brotherhood===
Another Brotherhood was formed by former X-Man Xorn, who thought he was Magneto. His Brotherhood were his former students Beak, Angel Salvadore, Martha Johansson, Basilisk II, Ernst, Esme of the Stepford Cuckoos, and old Brotherhood member Toad. Most members rebelled against Xorn after he accidentally killed Basilisk and his insanity became too obvious to ignore.

===Exodus&#x27; Brotherhood===
In the &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; arc that concluded Chuck Austen&#x27;s run on &quot;X-Men&quot;, a new version of the Brotherhood appeared. The team was led by the powerful mutant Exodus, who had once been Magneto&#x27;s herald, and its other members included Avalanche, Sabretooth (who had simply been hired by Exodus), and new members Black Tom Cassidy, Mammomax, Nocturne (who was revealed to be spying on the team), and Juggernaut (who was later revealed to be a mole). After Black Tom killed Juggernaut&#x27;s friend Squid-Boy (who was attacking Juggernaut for his &quot;apparent betrayal&quot;), Juggernaut lashes out and tried to destroy the Brotherhood. After knocking Juggernaut and several other Brotherhood members unconscious, Exodus led his team to the Xavier Institute to claim revenge for the apparent death of Magneto. The entire team was defeated by the second Xorn, who sucked them into the &quot;black hole&quot; within his head; Nocturne was sucked in as well, and Juggernaut followed her. They eventually landed in Mojoworld, where the others sold Nocturne and Juggernaut to Mojo, for their freedom.

===Sunspot&#x27;s Brotherhood===
In Young X-Men, Donald Pierce, in disguise as Cyclops, deceives several X-Men in training into attacking what he dubs a new incarnation of the Brotherhood, which consists of Cannonball, Danielle Moonstar and Magma, all under the leadership of Sunspot, Lord Imperial of the Hellfire Club. However, this was just a manipulative ruse, and these four New Mutants were neither a team at the time nor conducting villainous activity.

===Red Queen&#x27;s Sisterhood===
An all-female incarnation called &quot;the Sisterhood&quot; was formed by the &quot;Red Queen&quot;—revealed to be Madelyne Pryor—who recruited Martinique Jason, Lady Mastermind, Chimera, and the non-mutants Spiral and Lady Deathstrike. The Sisterhood was able to capture and brainwash the former X-Man Psylocke, making her a member also. Although being neither female nor a recruited member, former Hellions member Empath was revealed to be helping the team in their attack against the X-Men. The Red Queen is later lured into a trap set by Cyclops (Madelyne&#x27;s former husband) and defeated. Psylocke broke free from her brainwashing and rejoined the X-Men. The other Sisterhood members all escape.
===Joseph&#x27;s Brotherhood===
In the miniseries &quot;Magneto: Not a Hero&quot;, Joseph is resurrected under unknown circumstances and forms a new Brotherhood of Mutants with Astra and mutated deformed versions of Blob, Mastermind, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, and Toad. It is soon revealed that the mutated versions of Blob, Mastermind, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, and Toad are clones created by Astra. All the clones were killed by Magneto. Joseph is defeated by Magneto and remanded to Utopia&#x27;s X-Brig.

===Daken&#x27;s Brotherhood===
In Uncanny X-Force, Wolverine&#x27;s son Daken forms a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants with Mystique, Sabretooth, Shadow King (back in Amahl Farouk&#x27;s body), Blob (AoA version), Skinless Man (Weapon III of Weapon Plus) and the Omega Clan (consisting of Omega Red II, Omega Black and Omega White who each share the DNA of the original Omega Red) with the apparent goal of exacting revenge on X-Force. The group was seen recruiting Genesis as their next member, in order to turn him into the new Apocalypse.

===Mystique&#x27;s Fourth Brotherhood===
Mystique has since gathered a new Brotherhood which consists of herself, Sabretooth, Blob, Silver Samurai II, and Lady Mastermind. By using Lady Mastermind&#x27;s illusions, they commit numerous heists to incriminate the original X-Men, who had recently been brought through time to the present by Beast.

With the money the Brotherhood of Mutants robbed in the heists, Mystique acquired Madripoor from HYDRA and attempted to turn it into a mutant sanctuary. Posing as Dazzler, Mystique attracted Magneto to the island and showed him her plans. However, Magneto reacted violently to the plan, believing that Mystique and the others were traitors to their species in part due to allowing the use of Mutant Growth Hormone to run rampant in the streets to fund their operations. He heavily injured Mystique and the Brotherhood and left after making their base collapse.

===Lady Deathstrike&#x27;s Sisterhood===
Inspired by Madelyne&#x27;s attempt of defeating the X-Men, Lady Deathstrike has recruited the likes of Typhoid Mary and Enchantress and put together an all new Sisterhood, her own illuminati to take down the X-Men, as well as helping each one of them to achieve their individual goals. They have recently added the newly resurrected Selene to their ranks with the aid of the sentient virus, Arkea, and intend to bring back Madelyne Pryor herself as well. After Lady Deathstrike&#x27;s host, Ana Cortes had a change of heart about being a supervillain and serving Arkea, she contacted the X-Men and informed them of the Sisterhood&#x27;s location. She committed suicide. Arkea placed Lady Deathstrike&#x27;s consciousness in the same body Arkea used for a host, Reiko. Arkea then took the Jean Grey genetic material she purchased and modified Ana Cortes corpse so that it could host Madelyne Pryor. Amora completed the resurrection of Madelyne Pryor. The X-Men assaulted the Sisterhood&#x27;s hideout. They cut the hideout off the grid. The X-Men assaulted the Sisterhood. As most members of the Sisterhood did not particularly care for Arkea, they did not defend her to the fullest of their capabilities. Karima killed Arkea with a bullet specifically designed to destroy hive mind bacteria. As Arkea Prime was the queen bee of Arkea, once she was killed all Arkea bacteria everywhere died. As Madelyne and Selene left, Madelyne informed the group of her plan to create a new Sisterhood. Lady Deathstrike survived the destruction of Arkea.

===Mesmero&#x27;s Brotherhood===
Following the war with the Inhumans and the destruction of the remaining Terrigen cloud, a new group claiming to be the new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants appears, consisting of a new Avalanche, a new Pyro, Masque, Magma and a new reptile-looking member named Kologoth. They are led by a somehow-repowered Mesmero and secretly funded by an anti-mutant activist named Lydia Nance. It was also discovered by the X-Men that Mesmero had used his powers to brainwash the members of his Brotherhood to join the team and force them to carry out those attacks. Once his control was broken, the Brotherhood was dissolved and Mesmero was arrested.

Mesmero eventually escape from the Box and persuades Pyro and Avalanche to help him get revenge on Lydia Nance. After the fight with the X-Men and the NYPD, the Brotherhood of Mutants retreated to their hideout where Mesmero revealed that they were still under Lydia Nance&#x27;s paycheck and she was the one who facilitated their escape from the Box and that she still has plans for the Brotherhood of Mutants. While Pyro walked away upon not wanting to work for an anti-mutant activist, Avalanche remained with Mesmero and asked for Pyro&#x27;s cut as well.

===Magneto&#x27;s Second Brotherhood===
When Magneto time-traveled 20 years into the future to escape an attack, he found a city in ruins and statues of himself all around. He was greeted by mutants who saw him as a savior. He was also greeted by the time-displaced X-Men, who say Magneto is beyond redemption and that they should have stopped him when they had the chance. When Magneto returns to his own time, he decides it&#x27;s time to stop pretending. He knows who he is, what he is, and he feels that being that person, that monster, is necessary for mutants to survive. His trip to the future assured him of that. Donning his classic red and purple costume, he steps onto his restored base, New Asteroid M, and calls upon his new Brotherhood of Mutants which consists of Briar Raleigh, Toad, Exodus, Unuscione, Marrow, and Elixir.

This new Brotherhood was short-lived though, as Magneto was soon afterwards captured and turned into a Horseman of Salvation, Elixir and Marrow were seen on Earth and members of Emma Frost&#x27;s new Hellfire Club, while Exodus had established a new team of Acolytes, with Unuscione as one of its members.

===Joseph&#x27;s Second Brotherhood===
Taking the opportunity of Magneto disappearance, Joseph disguised himself as Magneto and appears to disband the former Brotherhood, only to sway Avalanche, Juggernaut, Pyro, Random and Toad to form a new Brotherhood in the wake of the death of the X-Men. The Brotherhood went to an Air Force base in East Transia to put the fear in humans, but were confronted by a new group of X-Men led by a resurrected Cyclops. After the battle, Joseph&#x27;s identity is revealed as the real Master of Magnetism was actually kidnapped by Nate Grey and mind-controlled to become one of his Horsemen of Salvation.

===Brotherhood of Arakko===
Following the terraformation of Mars and the relocation of the mutant nation of Arakko to the newly verdant planet, Storm claimed a seat on the Great Ring of Arakko. While Storm attempted to navigate the complicated politics of the warlike Arakki, she found herself at odds with Abigail Brand and S.W.O.R.D.&#x27;s plans for the planet. When Brand proposed an X-Men team as a controlling influence for the Arakki, Storm declined her offer and instead formed the new &quot;Brotherhood of Arakko&quot; alongside Magneto, Sunspot, and the Fisher King.

===Genesis&#x27; Brotherhood===
After Storm brings an end to the bloody &quot;Genesis War&quot; by destroying the staff that has kept Genesis trapped beneath Annihilation&#x27;s whispering and corruption as punishment for the civil war, Arakko&#x27;s Great Ring chooses to exile Genesis. But even in exile, Genesis is hardly ready to give up on battle. She announces her new Brotherhood, along with her children, War and Famine. As the three of them prepare to face Orchis, who &quot;aimed [them] like a weapon&quot;.

==Known members==
==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; reality, Apocalypse is served by a strikeforce of mutant fanatics calling itself the Brotherhood of Chaos. Its members are Copycat, Box, Spyne, Yeti and Arclight.

===Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows===
In &quot;Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows&quot;, the Brotherhood of Mutants consists of Magneto, Blob, Toad, Mist Mistress, Jubilee, and an unnamed mutant that resembles Crucible. They appear to attack the X-Mansion at the time when Spider-Man and his family are visiting. Spider-Man and his family join the fight against the Brotherhood of Mutants who are also shown to have Emma Frost in their group. Magneto wanted Emma Frost to operate Cerebro for the group. With help from Spider-Man&#x27;s family, the X-Men defeat the Brotherhood of Mutants who are remanded to the Raft.

===&quot;Battle of the Atom&quot;===
This version of the Brotherhood appeared in the &quot;Battle of the Atom&quot; event, first posing as a future X-Men team who wanted to send the past X-Men to their own time. Their true reasons, to prevent the past X-Men from suffering and dying in the future, were revealed, and they were soon at war against the present X-Men, the Uncanny X-Men, and the true Future X-Men. Their members include Xorn (the past Jean Grey, who had to wear a Xorn mask to limit her power), Charles Xavier II (the alleged son of the original Professor X and Mystique), Beast, Ice Thing (a semi-sentient ice construct created by the future Iceman), Molly Hayes, Deadpool, and Raze Logan (the son of Wolverine and Mystique, who first arrived disguised as Shadowcat). Some of the members of the Future Brotherhood died during the event, while some of them survived and remain living in the present.

Although it appeared that all of the Brotherhood members had survived when they infiltrated Cyclops&#x27; new school, after the Brotherhood were defeated by the past-Jean Grey&#x27;s mind powers, it is revealed that Xorn/Jean had been killed in their first appearance in the past, while all of the Brotherhood&#x27;s other members- except for Raze Logan- were only working with the team due to the telepathic influence of Charles Xavier II. With Xavier II and Raze both subdued, the former Brotherhood were freed and returned to their home future while Charles Xavier II and Raze Logan are left in the present, locked in the prison&#x27;s Cage.

===Marvel 1602===
In Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Marvel 1602&quot; series, Magneto is Enrique, the Grand Inquisitor of the Spanish Inquisition during the year 1602, with Brother Petros and Sister Wanda (Pietro and Wanda Maximoff respectively) serving under him as messenger and assistant, respectively. Enrique had been born a Jew in the ghetto of Venice, but he was taken away from his parents and raised within the Catholic Church. At some point Enrique befriended Carlos Javier, that world&#x27;s Professor X, who crafted a helmet to protect Enrique from his psychic powers.

After Toad, their spy at the Vatican, betrays the fact that they have been sheltering any &#x27;Witchbreed&#x27; (1602 word for Mutants) that can hide their powers, he and his children escape being burnt at the stake, capture Toad, and sail to the Americas; as Gaiman&#x27;s reinterpretation of Magneto is more rooted in religion than morality, here his group is named &#x27;The Brotherhood of Those Who Will Inherit The Earth&#x27;. After a brief encounter with Carlos Javier in which Roberto Trefusis freezes their ship in the middle of the ocean, Enrique agrees to work with the other heroes. When the world is saved, Enrique departs, entrusting Wanda and Petros to Javier, and instructing him to take care of them until he returns, and never to tell them that they are his children. The fate of Toad in this world is unknown, but Enrique had promised to punish him for his betrayal, a punishment which was ultimately left unseen.

===Marvel Noir===
In the reality of &quot;Marvel Noir&quot;, this Brotherhood, led by Chief Detective Eric Magnus, is a cabal of corrupt and violent policemen, doing the bidding of Sebastian Shaw. It is formed by Magnus, Dukes, Toynbee, and Wyngarde.

===MC2===
In &quot;Amazing Spider-Girl&quot; #22, a Sisterhood of Mutants is featured. This group consists of Magneta, Impact (a superstrong mutant able to increase the size of any part of her body), Pirouette (who can rotate at high speeds), and Headcase (a powerful psychic).

===House of M===
In the alternate reality depicted in the 2005 &quot;House of M&quot; storyline, the Brotherhood was created as an NYPD strikeforce team to take down organized crime. Members included John Proudstar (leader), Frank Castle (only human member who left due to seeing how the Brotherhood are mistreating the human criminals), Blob, Feral, Taskmaster, Avalanche, Boom Boom and Misty Knight (who had secretly infiltrated the &quot;Avengers&quot;, and would later defect from the Brotherhood).

===Ultimate Marvel===
In &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;, the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants is called the Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy, headed by a far more violent and genocidal version of Magneto. It was originally formed by Professor X and Magneto in a plan to create a safe haven for mutants in a city within the Savage Land, but Magneto had other plans to make the mutants more dominant over the humans. The original Brotherhood first seen consisted of Blob, Mastermind, Magneto&#x27;s twins Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch; Toad, and Wolverine. Soon after their first appearance, Wolverine was planted in the X-Men as a mole and later defected to the X-Men. Cyclops once sided with the Brotherhood during Wolverine&#x27;s infiltration only to turn against the Brotherhood and assist the X-Men in fighting the Brotherhood of Mutants. When Magneto was seemingly killed by Professor X, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch tried to use the Brotherhood in more positive ways of gaining mutant rights such as proceeding with talks to the UN. This caused many splinter groups (such as the Acolytes) to split off and attempt to continue Magneto&#x27;s genocidal techniques. During this short-lived less violent phase, several mutant animal recruits rescued from laboratories were added (one of which was the mutated ape Prosimian), but Magneto rejected them upon his return seeing them as lower species like &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; and wiped out the mutant animals.

In the &quot;Ultimate War&quot; and &quot;Return of the King&quot; storylines, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch defected to the Ultimates to help stop the resurfaced Magneto. Unus, Detonator, Juggernaut, Longshot, Hard-Drive, Rogue, Sabretooth, Vanisher, Forge, and Multiple Man join the Brotherhood. After being defeated by the X-Men, the Brotherhood receded for a time. Mystique and Forge free Magneto from his plastic prison cell in the Triskelion, with Mystique taking his place to prevent anyone from realizing that Magneto is free.

In &quot;The Ultimates 3&quot;, Magneto leads Sabertooth, Blob, Unus, Multiple Man, Mystique, Pyro, Mastermind, and Lorelei in a fight against the Ultimates after the death of his daughter Scarlet Witch at the hands of Ultron. The battle results in the seeming death of Quicksilver as well (though he is later revealed to be alive), Unus being killed by Thor, and Mastermind being killed by Valkyrie who also dismembered Pyro&#x27;s hands.

Magneto, Blob, Detonator, Forge, Hard-Drive, Longshot, Lorelei, and Multiple Man are killed during the &quot;Ultimatum&quot; storyline, during which Magneto tries to destroy the human race with Thor&#x27;s hammer before being killed by Cyclops. Quicksilver turned up alive and was the one who shot Cyclops as he meets up with Mystique and Sabretooth.

Quicksilver later reforms the Brotherhood of Mutants with Mystique, Sabretooth, Blob II/Teddy Allan.

===&quot;X-Men: No More Humans&quot;===

<text>Joseph Gregory Randa (; born December 18, 1969) is an American former Major League Baseball player. He was primarily a third baseman during his career. His nickname is &quot;[[Joker (comics)|the Joker]]&quot; due to his resemblance to the comic book character in &quot;Batman&quot; and his ever-present smile, especially during his plate appearances. It was given to him by Tony Muser, the Kansas City Royals manager during Randa&#x27;s second tour with the ballclub. This had resulted from Muser having to constantly answer questions about why Randa was always smiling. &quot;I&#x27;d tell them that&#x27;s not a smile, it&#x27;s his normal look&quot;, Muser explained.

==Early life==
Randa attended Kettle Moraine High School in Wales, Wisconsin, lettering in football, basketball, baseball, and tennis. Randa&#x27;s #12 was retired by the Lasers. He is also a member of the Kettle Moraine Laser Trailblazer Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==
Randa played minor league for the Eugene Emeralds. He made his major league debut in with the Kansas City Royals, playing in 34 games. He played the next three seasons as a competitive third baseman with three different teams, hitting .303, .302, and .254 for the Royals, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Detroit Tigers, respectively.

The Royals reacquired Randa prior to the season. Installed as a full-time third baseman for the first time in his career, Randa hit .314 with 16 home runs and 84 RBIs, establishing himself as a run producer in the middle of the order and a steady fielder at third base. In 2003, Randa set the Kansas City Royals&#x27; team record for the most consecutive errorless games by a third baseman, going 75 games without an error. After the season ended, Randa signed with the Cincinnati Reds as a free agent. On Opening Day, Randa hit the game-winning home run in the bottom of the 9th for Cincinnati in a 7–6 victory. On July 23, , Randa was traded to the San Diego Padres for pitchers Justin Germano and Travis Chick. He was then signed by the Pirates on December 28, 2005, for a one-year contract worth between $3.5 and $4 million. On September 22, Randa broke up Padres pitcher Chris Young&#x27;s no-hit bid with a pinch-hit home run in the 9th inning. On November 2, , Randa announced his retirement. He batted .284/.339/.426 with 123 HRs and 739 RBIs in 1,522 games over 12 seasons.

Randa is one of only three players in Kansas City Royal history to collect six hits in a nine-inning game, which he did on September 9, in the first game of a doubleheader against the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park; he went 6-for-7 in a 26–5 Royal blowout win. Bob Oliver had collected six hits in a (the franchise&#x27;s inaugural season) game and Kevin Seitzer in . Randa also scored six runs in that game; as of 2019, he is the most recent Major Leaguer to do so.

Randa made his first and only playoff appearance in 2005 with the Padres, hitting .364 in three games.

==Post pro career==
Randa works with the Royals&#x27; minor league teams as a special assistant.

<doc id="304041" wikidata="Q192867" url="?curid=304041" title="Artaxerxes III">
<text>Ochus ( ), known by his dynastic name Artaxerxes III ( ; ), was King of Kings of the Achaemenid Empire from 359/58 to 338 BC. He was the son and successor of Artaxerxes II and his mother was Stateira.

Before ascending the throne Artaxerxes was a satrap and commander of his father&#x27;s army. Artaxerxes came to power after one of his brothers was executed, another committed suicide, the last murdered and his father, Artaxerxes II died. Soon after becoming king, Artaxerxes murdered all of the royal family to secure his place as king. He started two major campaigns against Egypt. The first campaign failed, and was followed up by rebellions throughout the western part of his empire. During the second invasion, Artaxerxes finally defeated Nectanebo II, the Pharaoh of Egypt, bringing the country back into the Persian fold after six decades.

In Artaxerxes&#x27; later years, Philip II of Macedon&#x27;s power was increasing in Greece, where he tried to convince the Greeks to revolt against the Achaemenid Empire. His activities were opposed by Artaxerxes, and with his support, the city of Perinthus resisted a Macedonian siege. 

There is evidence for a renewed building policy at Persepolis in his later life, where Artaxerxes erected a new palace and built his own tomb, and began long-term projects such as the Unfinished Gate.

== Etymology ==
&quot;&quot; is the Latin form of the Greek &quot;Artaxerxes&quot; (), itself from the Old Persian &quot;Artaxšaçā&quot; (&quot;whose reign is through truth&quot;). It is known in other languages as; Elamite &quot;Ir-tak-ik-ša-iš-ša&quot;, &quot;Ir-da-ik-ša-iš-ša&quot;; Akkadian &quot;Ar-ta-ʾ-ḫa-šá-is-su&quot;; Middle Persian &quot;Ardaxšēr&quot; and New Persian &quot;Ardašīr&quot;. His personal name was &quot;Ochus&quot; (Greek: ; Babylonian: 𒌑𒈠𒋢 ).

==Background==
Ochus was the legitimate son of Artaxerxes II and his wife Stateira. He had two elder full-brothers, Ariaspes and Darius (the eldest). He also had many illegitimate brothers born to concubine mothers, whom the 2nd-century AD Roman writer Justin numbered to be 115. Out of all the sons, it was Darius who had been appointed as the heir to the empire, thus receiving the royal privilege of wearing the upright tiara. However, Artaxerxes II&#x27;s long reign frustrated the latter, who was already over 50 years old. Incited by the former satrap Tiribazus, he started plotting against his father to quicken his succession. Darius expected that he would receive support from many courtiers, including fifty of his illegitimate brothers according to Justin. A eunuch discovered the conspiracy, and as a result Darius was summoned to the court and executed, &quot;along with the wives and children of all the conspirators&quot; (Justin). The right of succession then passed over to Ariaspes. However, Ochus, with the support of some eunuchs, created a series of ruses and allegations to make his legitimate brother Ariaspes go mad and commit suicide. Artaxerxes II, who disliked Ochus, appointed his favourite illegitimate son Arsames as the new crown prince. He was, however, soon killed by Arpates at the instigation of Ochus. Ochus was then finally appointed as crown prince, with Artaxerxes dying shortly after.

==Revolt of Artabazus==

At his accession (which happened sometime between November 359 and March 358 BC), Artaxerxes III demanded that all the satraps in western Anatolia were to disband their mercenary forces. This was done to diminish the power of powerful satraps and consolidate the power of the crown. Indeed, under Artaxerxes III&#x27;s father, the satrap Datames had with the help of his mercenaries ruled a more or less independent state, while previously the Achaemenid prince Cyrus the Younger had almost managed to overthrow Artaxerxes II with the help of his mercenaries. All the satraps followed his order and disbanded their mercenaries. Later in 356 BC, Artaxerxes III attempted to dismiss Artabazus II from his satrapy of Hellespontine Phrygia, which resulted in the latter revolting. His royal blood through his mother Apama, a sister of Artaxerxes III, may have made the latter vigilant towards him. Artabazus&#x27; two brothers are Oxythres and Dibictus are also reported to have joined him, which implies that Artaxerxes III was targeting the whole family.

Artaxerxes III sent the other satraps in Anatolia—Tithraustes, Autophradates and Mausolus—to suppress the revolt. Artabazus quickly joined forces with the Athenian military commander Chares, who had acquired most of his disbanded mercenary unit. Together, they defeated the satraps in 355 BC and marched deeper into Greater Phrygia, ransacking the region. Artaxerxes III quickly pressured Athens to stop supporting Artabazus by the threat of war. Artabazus subsequently found a new ally in the Thebian general Pammenes, who supplied him with 5,000 soldiers in 354 BC. Further defeats were inflicted on the Achaemenid forces, but Artabazus soon fell out with Pammenes, and had him arrested. In 354/3 BC, he ceased his rebellion and fled to Macedonia, where he was well received by its king, Philip II.

==First Egyptian Campaign (351 BC)==
In around 351 BC, Artaxerxes embarked on a campaign to recover Egypt, which had revolted under his father, Artaxerxes II. At the same time a rebellion had broken out in Asia Minor, which, being supported by Thebes, threatened to become serious. Levying a vast army, Artaxerxes marched into Egypt, and engaged Nectanebo II. After a year of fighting the Egyptian Pharaoh, Nectanebo inflicted a crushing defeat on the Persians with the support of mercenaries led by the Greek generals: the Athenian Diophantus and the Spartan Lamius. Artaxerxes was compelled to retreat and postpone his plans to reconquer Egypt.

==Rebellion of Cyprus and Sidon==

Soon after this Egyptian defeat, Phoenicia, Anatolia and Cyprus declared their independence from Persian rule. In 343 BC, Artaxerxes committed responsibility for the suppression of the Cyprian rebels to Idrieus, prince of Caria, who employed 8000 Greek mercenaries and forty triremes, commanded by Phocion the Athenian, and Evagoras, son of the elder Evagoras, the Cypriot monarch. Idrieus succeeded in reducing Cyprus.

===Sidon campaign of Belesys and Mazaeus===
Artaxerxes initiated a counter-offensive against Sidon by commanding the satrap of Syria Belesys and Mazaeus, the satrap of Cilicia, to invade the city and to keep the Phoenicians in check. Both satraps suffered crushing defeats at the hands of Tennes, the Sidonese king, who was aided by 4,000 Greek mercenaries sent to him by Nectanebo II and commanded by Mentor of Rhodes. As a result, the Persian forces were driven out of Phoenicia.

===Sidon campaign of Artaxerxes===
After this, Artaxerxes personally led an army of 330,000 men against Sidon. Artaxerxes&#x27; army comprised 300,000 foot soldiers, 30,000 cavalry, 300 triremes, and 500 transports or provision ships. After gathering this army, he sought assistance from the Greeks. Though refused aid by Athens and Sparta, he succeeded in obtaining a thousand Theban heavy-armed hoplites under Lacrates, three thousand Argives under Nicostratus, and six thousand Æolians, Ionians, and Dorians from the Greek cities of Anatolia. This Greek support was numerically small, amounting to no more than 10,000 men, but it formed, together with the Greek mercenaries from Egypt who went over to him afterwards, the force on which he placed his chief reliance, and to which the ultimate success of his expedition was mainly due.

The approach of Artaxerxes sufficiently weakened the resolution of Tennes that he endeavoured to purchase his own pardon by delivering up 100 principal citizens of Sidon into the hands of the Persian king, and then admitting Artaxerxes within the defences of the town. Artaxerxes had the 100 citizens transfixed with javelins, and when 500 more came out as supplicants to seek his mercy, Artaxerxes consigned them to the same fate. Sidon was then burnt to the ground, either by Artaxerxes or by the Sidonian citizens. Forty thousand people died in the conflagration. Artaxerxes sold the ruins at a high price to speculators, who calculated on reimbursing themselves by the treasures which they hoped to dig out from among the ashes. Tennes was later put to death by Artaxerxes. Artaxerxes later sent Jews who supported the revolt to Hyrcania, on the south coast of the Caspian Sea.

==Conquest of Egypt==
It was probably in 340 or 339 BC that Artaxerxes finally succeeded in conquering Egypt. After years of extensive and meticulous preparations, the King assembled and led in person a large host which included Greek mercenaries from Thebes, Argos, Asia Minor, and those commanded by the turncoat mercenary Mentor of Rhodes, as well as a war fleet and a number of transport ships. Although the Artaxerxes&#x27;s army considerably outnumbered that of his Egyptian counterpart Nectanebo II, the difficulty of marching through the dry land south of Gaza and the many rivers of Lower Egypt still posed, as in previous invasions, a challenge, which was compounded, according to Diodorus Siculus, by the refusal of the Persians to make use of local guides. The invasion started poorly, as Artaxerxes lost some troops to quicksand at Barathra, and an attempt by his Theban troops to take Pelusium was successfully counterattacked by the garrison.

Artaxerxes then created three divisions of shock troops, each with a Greek commander and a Persian supervisor, while remaining himself in command of the reserves. One unit, to which he assigned the Thebans, a force of cavalry and Asiatic infantry, was tasked with taking Pelusium, while a second, commanded by Mentor of Rhodes and the eunuch Bagoas, was sent against Bubastis. The third division, which comprised the Argives, some unspecified elite troops and 80 triremes, was to establish a bridgehead on the opposite bank of the Nile. After an attempt to dislodge the Argives failed, Nectanebo retreated to Memphis, which prompted the besieged garrison of Pelusium to surrender. Bubastis likewise capitulated, as the Greek mercenaries in the garrison came to terms with the Persians after falling out with the Egyptians. This was followed by a wave of surrenders, which opened the Nile to Artaxerxes&#x27;s fleet and caused Nectanebo to lose heart and abandon his country.

After this victory over the Egyptians, Artaxerxes had the city walls destroyed, started a reign of terror, and set about looting all the temples. Persia gained a significant amount of wealth from this looting. Artaxerxes also raised high taxes and attempted to weaken Egypt enough that it could never revolt against Persia. For the 10 years that Persia controlled Egypt, believers in the native religion were persecuted and sacred books were stolen. Before he returned to Persia, he appointed Pherendares as satrap of Egypt. With the wealth gained from his reconquering Egypt, Artaxerxes was able to amply reward his mercenaries. He then returned to his capital having successfully completed his invasion of Egypt.

==Later years==
After his success in Egypt, Artaxerxes returned to Persia and spent the next few years effectively quelling insurrections in various parts of the Empire so that a few years after his conquest of Egypt, the Persian Empire was firmly under his control. Egypt remained a part of the Persian Empire until Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquest of Egypt.

After the conquest of Egypt, there were no more revolts or rebellions against Artaxerxes. Mentor of Rhodes and Bagoas, the two generals who had most distinguished themselves in the Egyptian campaign, were advanced to posts of the highest importance. Mentor, who was governor of the entire Asiatic seaboard, was successful in reducing to subjection many of the chiefs who during the recent troubles had rebelled against Persian rule. In the course of a few years Mentor and his forces were able to bring the whole Asian Mediterranean coast into complete submission and dependence.

Bagoas went back to the Persian capital with Artaxerxes, where he took a leading role in the internal administration of the Empire and maintained tranquility throughout the rest of the Empire. During the last six years of the reign of Artaxerxes III, the Persian Empire was governed by a vigorous and successful government.

The Persian forces in Ionia and Lycia regained control of the Aegean and the Mediterranean Sea and took over much of Athens’ former island empire. In response, Isocrates of Athens started giving speeches calling for a ‘crusade against the barbarians’ but there was not enough strength left in any of the Greek city-states to answer his call.

Although there weren&#x27;t any rebellions in the Persian Empire itself, the growing power and territory of Philip II of Macedon in Macedon (against which Demosthenes was in vain warning the Athenians) attracted the attention of Artaxerxes. In response, he ordered that Persian influence was to be used to check and constrain the rising power and influence of the Macedonian kingdom. In 340 BC, a Persian force was dispatched to assist the Thracian prince, Cersobleptes, to maintain his independence. Sufficient effective aid was given to the city of Perinthus that the numerous and well-appointed army with which Philip had commenced his siege of the city was compelled to give up the attempt. By the last year of Artaxerxes&#x27; rule, Philip II already had plans in place for an invasion of the Persian Empire, which would crown his career, but the Greeks would not unite with him.

In late August/late September 338 BC, the court eunuch and chiliarch (&quot;hazahrapatish&quot;) Bagoas orchestrated the poisoning and subsequent death of Artaxerxes III through the latter&#x27;s own physician. Artaxerxes III&#x27;s early death proved to be a problematic issue for Persia, and may have played a role in the weakening of the country. The majority of Artaxerxes III&#x27;s sons, with the exception of Arses and Bisthanes, were also murdered by Bagoas. Bagoas, acting as kingmaker, put the young Arses (Artaxerxes IV) on the throne.

==Legacy==

Historically, kings of the Achaemenid Empire were followers of Zoroaster or heavily influenced by Zoroastrian ideology. The reign of Artaxerxes II saw a revival of the cult of Anahita and Mithra, when in his building inscriptions he invoked Ahura Mazda, Anahita and Mithra and even set up statues of his gods. Mithra and Anahita had until then been neglected by true Zoroastrians—they defied Zoroaster&#x27;s command that God was to be represented only by the flames of a sacred fire. Artaxerxes III is thought to have rejected Anahita and worshipped only Ahuramazda and Mithra. An ambiguity in the cuneiform script of an inscription of Artaxerxes III at Persepolis suggests that he regarded the father and the son as one person, suggesting that the attributes of Ahuramazda were being transferred to Mithra. Strangely, Artaxerxes had ordered that statues of the goddess Anâhita be erected at Babylon, Damascus and Sardis, as well as at Susa, Ecbatana and Persepolis.

Artaxerxes&#x27; name appears on silver coins (modeled on Athenian ones) issued while he was in Egypt. The reverse bears an inscription in an Egyptian script, saying &quot;Artaxerxes Pharaoh. Life, Prosperity, Wealth&quot;.

===In literature===
It is thought by some that the &quot;Book of Judith&quot; could have been originally based on Artaxerxes&#x27; campaign in Phoenicia, as Holofernes was the name of the brother of the Cappadocian satrap Ariarathes, the vassal of Artaxerxes. Bagoas, the general that finds Holofernes dead, was one of the generals of Artaxerxes during his campaign against Phoenicia and Egypt.

===Construction===

There is evidence for a renewed building policy at Persepolis, but some of the buildings were unfinished at the time of his death. Two of his buildings at Persepolis were the Hall of Thirty-Two Columns, the purpose of which is unknown, and the palace of Artaxerxes III. The unfinished Army Road and Unfinished Gate, which connected the Gate of All Nations and the One-hundred Column Hall, gave archaeologists an insight into the construction of Persepolis. In 341 BC, after Artaxerxes returned to Babylon from Egypt, he apparently proceeded to build a great Apadana whose description is present in the works of Diodorus Siculus.

The Nebuchadnezzar II palace in Babylon was expanded during the reign of Artaxerxes III. Artaxerxes&#x27; tomb was cut into the mountain behind the Persepolis platform, next to his father&#x27;s tomb.

==Family==

Artaxerxes III was the son of Artaxerxes II and Statira. Artaxerxes II had more than 115 sons by many wives, most of them however were illegitimate. Some of Ochus&#x27; more significant siblings were Rodogune, Apama, Sisygambis, Ocha, Darius and Ariaspes, most of whom were murdered soon after his ascension.

His children were:

By Atossa:
* Artaxerxes IV Arses

By an unknown wife: 
* Bisthanes 
* Parysatis II, future wife of Alexander the Great.

He also married:
* An unknown daughter of his sister Ocha. 
* A daughter of Oxyathres, brother of Darius III

<text>Deaf-mute is a term which was used historically to identify a person who was either deaf and used sign language or both deaf and could not speak. The term continues to be used to refer to deaf people who cannot speak an oral language or have some degree of speaking ability, but choose not to speak because of the negative or unwanted attention atypical voices sometimes attract. Such people communicate using sign language. Some consider it to be a derogatory term if used outside its historical context; the preferred term today is simply &quot;deaf&quot;.

==Historical usage of &quot;deaf-mute&quot; and other terms==
===United Kingdom===
In 19th-century British English &quot;mute&quot; and &quot;dumb&quot; meant &#x27;non-speaking&#x27;, and were not pejorative terms. For example, in 1889 Queen Victoria instigated the &quot;Royal Commission on The Blind, the Deaf and Dumb etc. in the United Kingdom&quot;. The intention was to examine contemporary education and employment of blind or deaf people, with a view to improving conditions for them. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states that the North American pejorative usage of the word to imply stupidity was first noted in the UK in 1928. According to the OED, &quot;deaf-mute&quot; was coined in the early 19th century as a medical term for an inability to speak as a consequence of deafness. There is no mention of offensiveness of this term in the UK.

===North America===
The primary definition of &quot;dumb&quot; in &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; is &quot;lacking intelligence&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot;. Its second definition of the word is &quot;lacking the ability to speak ... now often offensive&quot;. Webster&#x27;s definition of &quot;mute&quot;, on the other hand, gives the adjectival meaning as &quot;unable to speak&quot;, whereas one of its usages as a noun is &quot;a person who cannot speak ... sometimes offensive&quot;.

In informal American English the term &quot;dumb&quot; is sometimes used to refer to other hearing people in jest, to chide, or to invoke an image of someone who refuses to employ common sense or who is unreliable. In the past &quot;deaf-mute&quot; was used to describe deaf people who used sign language, but in modern times, the term is frequently viewed today as offensive and inaccurate. From antiquity (as noted in the Code of Hammurabi) until recent times, the terms &quot;deaf-mute&quot; and &quot;deaf and dumb&quot; were sometimes considered analogous to &quot;stupid&quot; by some hearing people. The simple identity of &quot;deaf&quot; has been embraced by the community of signing deaf people since the foundations of public deaf education in the 18th century and remains the preferred term of reference or identity for many years. Within the deaf community there are some who prefer the term &quot;Deaf&quot; (upper-case D) to &quot;deaf&quot; (lower-case) as a description of their status and identity.

===Jewish law===
Classification as a deaf-mute has a particular importance in Jewish law. Because historically it was thought impossible to teach or communicate with them, deaf-mutes were not moral agents, and therefore were unable to own real estate, act as witnesses, or be punished for any crime. However, today when techniques for educating deaf people are known, they are no longer classed as such.

==Deaf-mute people in history==
The Ottoman Sultans used people referred to as &quot;congenital deaf-mutes&quot; (called in Turkish or , i.e. &#x27;mute&#x27; or &#x27;without tongue&#x27;) in their own personal service from the 15th century to the end of the Ottoman Empire. Due to their nature, they were often entrusted with confidential and delicate missions, including executions.

==Deaf-muteness in art and literature==

Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;The Stand&quot; features a main character named Nick Andros who is referred to as &quot;deaf-mute.&quot; Though deaf people almost always have a voice, King interpreted the term literally and made Nick unable to vocalize. However, he could read lips and make himself clearly understood by pantomiming and in writing.

The phrase is used in &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; to indicate someone who does not speak his mind, and hears nothing, in effect becoming isolated from the world.

Chief Bromden, in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, is believed by all to be deaf and mute, but in fact he can hear and speak; he does not let anyone know this because, as he grew up, he was not spoken to (making him &quot;deaf&quot;) and ignored (making him &quot;mute&quot;).

The character Singer in the novel &quot;The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter&quot;, written in 1940, is referred to as &quot;deaf-mute&quot; throughout.

In the classic Zorro stories, television series, etc. Zorro&#x27;s aid Bernardo, a mute, pretends that he can also not hear, in order to get information to aid his master in his fight for justice.

In the early &quot;87th Precinct&quot; novels written by Ed McBain, Teddy Carella, the wife of Detective Steve Carella, was referred to as a &quot;deaf-mute,&quot; but in later books, McBain stopped using the term. In the foreword to a reprinted edition of &quot;The Con Man&quot;, originally published in 1957, McBain says, &quot;A reader pointed out to me two or three years ago that this expression was now considered derogatory. Out the window it went, and Teddy is now speech-and-hearing impaired.&quot;

<text>Cindy Smart is a brand of doll manufactured by Manley Toy Quest. Introduced in 2002, Cindy Smart was the first doll that could see, capable of reading words in five languages, do basic math, and could tell time. The doll was first sold in the United States, and then in Australia beginning in 2003. 

== Capabilities ==

Cindy Smart has the appearance of a standard female doll. The doll is tall with blonde hair and blue eyes, and is intended to appear five years of age. Cindy Smart differs from other dolls because of her extra equipment, which includes: a digital camera in the doll&#x27;s torso, a 16-bit microprocessor in the stomach, and voice-recognition software. The camera makes Cindy Smart the first doll that can see.

When someone speaks to Cindy Smart, the software attempts to match the speech to one of 70 preprogrammed commands. If the command calls for reading, the digital camera searches for text in a 15-degree sector in front of it. The microprocessors compare the text with a database of words. The doll then gives the word and its spelling aloud, unless the word is an expletive. The doll can recognize 650 English words, as well as some French, German, Italian, and Spanish words. The doll can also do basic math, recognize shapes and colors, and tell time.

== History ==

Toymaker Bob Del Principe spent 10 years working on Cindy Smart. He completed the doll in 2002, when he was Vice President for Research and Development at a Los Angeles subsidiary of Manley Toy Quest, a Hong Kong–based toy manufacturing company. The doll was first sold in the United States for US$99, with a number of sales coming through the Home Shopping Network.

Manley Toy Quest expanded sales to Australia beginning on 19 August 2003 with a launch event at a Myer department store in Melbourne. The Australian version uses Commonwealth spelling and says &quot;Mum&quot; instead of the American &quot;Mom&quot;, but otherwise retains her American English dialect. The doll first sold for AU$149 in Australia.

== Reception ==

Several news outlets, including &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Wired&quot;, compared Cindy Smart to Chatty Cathy, which was the first talking doll and influential in the toy business. &quot;Wired&quot; and &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; also compared Cindy Smart to I-Cybie, the first widely available toy to accept voice commands. &quot;Time&quot; named Cindy Smart to its list of the 42 best inventions of 2002, praising her technical capabilities but calling her &quot;a little creepy&quot;. &quot;Wired&quot; also called her &quot;a little creepy&quot;.

Cindy Smart was a modest financial success. &quot;The Australian Financial Review&quot; named it a &quot;must-have&quot; for Christmas 2003.

<text>Solicitation is the act of offering, or attempting to purchase, goods and/or services. Legal status may be specific to the time or place where it occurs. The crime of &quot;solicitation to commit a crime&quot; occurs when a person encourages, &quot;solicits, requests, commands, importunes or otherwise attempts to cause&quot; another person to attempt or commit a crime, with the purpose of thereby facilitating the attempt or commission of that crime.

==England and Wales==
In England and Wales, the term soliciting is usually &quot;for a person (whether male or female) persistently to loiter or solicit in a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution&quot; under the Street Offences Act 1959 as amended. The crime of soliciting should not be confused with the profession of a solicitor, which under UK law is typically that of a lawyer, who may also function as a legal agent to obtain the services of a barrister on behalf of a client.

==United States==
In the United States, solicitation is the name of a crime, an inchoate offense that consists of a person offering money or inducing another to commit a crime with the specific intent that the person solicited commit the crime. For example, under federal law, for a solicitation conviction to occur the prosecution must prove both that defendant had the intent that another person engage in conduct constituting a felony crime of violence, and that the defendant commanded, induced, or otherwise endeavored to persuade the other person to commit the felony.

In some jurisdictions in the United States, solicitation of prostitution is subject to occasional police sting operations, which have been in turn subject to court cases on privacy grounds.

===Differences in laws===
In the United States, the term &quot;solicitation&quot; implies some part of commercial element, consideration, or payment.
In some other common law countries, the situation is different:
*where the substantive offense is not committed, the charges are drawn from incitement, conspiracy, and attempt;
*where the substantive offense is committed, the charges are drawn from conspiracy, counseling and procuring (see accessories), and the substantive offenses as joint principals (see common purpose).

===Differences from other crimes===

Solicitation has in the U.S. these unique elements:
# the encouraging, bribing, requesting, or commanding a person
# to commit a substantive crime,
# with the intent that the person solicited commit the crime.

Unlike conspiracy, there is no overt step necessary for solicitation, one person can be a defendant and it merges with the substantive crime.

It is not necessary that the person commit the crime, nor is it necessary that the person solicited be willing or able to commit the crime (such as if the &quot;solicitee&quot; were an undercover police officer).

For example, if Alice commands Bob to assault Charlie, and Alice intends for Bob to assault Charlie, then Alice is guilty of solicitation. However, if Alice commands Bob to assault Charlie without intending that a crime be committed (perhaps believing that Charlie has given consent), then there is no solicitation.

An interesting twist on solicitation occurs when a third party that the solicitor did not intend to receive the incitement overhears the request to the original solicitee and unbeknownst to the solicitor, commits the target offense. In a minority of jurisdictions in the United States, this situation would still be considered solicitation even though the defendant never intended the person that committed the crime to have done so.

Solicitation is also subject to the doctrine of merger, which applies in situations where the person solicited commits the crime. In such a situation, both Alice and Bob could be charged with the crime as accomplices, which would preclude conviction under solicitation; a person cannot be punished for both solicitation and the crime solicited.

===No soliciting signs – residential===

In addition to the inchoate offense of solicitation, &quot;solicitor&quot; can also refer to a door-to-door salesman. This creates another form of illegal solicitation, as in many jurisdictions, it is illegal to ignore &quot;no soliciting&quot; signs with the burden typically resting upon the solicitor to look for the sign and upon observation to vacate the premises without attempting to contact the homeowner. Some cities require the employer to properly train employees on the appropriate observation of local solicitation ordinances and instruct them to always carry an identifying badge that they must show upon request.

City ordinances vary but may require a soliciting sign to be of a certain dimension to qualify for legal protection. Some signs may cite the city ordinance and describe the consequences to the solicitor. Although certainly not required, such methods may be more effective at deterring unwanted solicitation.

<text>Zhang (; ) is the third most common surname in China and Taiwan (commonly spelled as Chang in Taiwan), and it is one of the most common surnames in the world. It is spoken in the first tone &quot;Zhāng&quot;. It is a surname that exists in many languages and cultures, corresponding to the surname &#x27;Archer&#x27; in English for example. In the Wade–Giles system of romanization, it is romanized as Chang, which is commonly used in Taiwan. Cheung is commonly used in Hong Kong as a romanization. It is the 24th name on the &quot;Hundred Family Surnames&quot; poem, contained in the verse 何呂施張 &quot;(Hé Lǚ Shī Zhāng)&quot;.

Zhang is also the pinyin romanization of the less-common surnames &#x27; (&quot;Zhāng&quot;), which is the 40th name on the &quot;Hundred Family Surnames&quot; poem, and &#x27; (&quot;Zhǎng&quot;).

Today, it is one of the most common surnames in the world at over 100 million people worldwide. Zhang was listed by the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s National Citizen ID Information System as the third-most-common surname in mainland China (April 2007), with 87.50 million bearers.

A commonly cited but erroneous factoid in the 1990 Guinness Book of Records listed it as the world&#x27;s most common surname, but no comprehensive information from China was available at the time and more recent editions have not repeated the claim.

==History==

===Characters===
 combines the Chinese characters (&quot;gōng&quot;, &quot;bow&quot;) and ( , &quot;cháng&quot;, &quot;long&quot; or &quot;wide&quot;). It originally meant &quot;to open up&quot; or &quot;to spread&quot; as an arching bow, but as a common noun in modern use it is a measure word for flat objects such as paper and cloth, like the English &quot;sheet of&quot;.

===Families===
The traditional origin of the surname (Old Chinese: &quot;*C. traŋ&quot;) is rooted in Chinese legend. The fifth son of the Yellow Emperor, Qing Yangshi (), had a son Hui () who was inspired by the Heavenly Bow constellation (, &quot;Tiān Gōng Xīng&quot;) to invent the bow and arrow. Hui was then promoted to &quot;First Bow&quot; (, &quot;Gōng Zhèng&quot;) and bestowed the surname , whichwhen broken into its constituent radicalsmeans &quot;widening bow&quot; or &quot;archer&quot;. Its Middle Chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as &quot;Trjang&quot;.

===Other origins===
* for some families, it is traced back to Xie Zhang (解張), whose style name was Zhang Hou (張侯, lit “Marquis Zhang”) a noble in Jin during the Spring and Autumn period.
* from the family of Zhang Liao (張遼), an official in Cao Wei during Three Kingdoms period. Zhāng Liao&#x27;s family had changed from &quot;Nie&quot; to &quot;Zhang&quot; to avoid association with his disgraced ancestor Nie Yi (聶壹).
* the surname is also traced back to Long Youna, chief of a minority ethnic groups during the Three Kingdoms period, who was given the Chinese surname Zhang (張) by Zhuge Liang, the prime minister of Shu.

<text>Safavi () is a Persian surname, best known as the surname of the royal family of the Safavid dynasty.

==Etymology==
Some have argued that &quot;Safavi&quot; is a cognate of the word &quot;Safaviyeh&quot; (Persian: صفویه). And that &quot;Safa&quot; is a cognate of the word Sufi (Persian: صوفی). &quot;Safavi&quot; is an adjective, created for the name &quot;Safi&quot;. Translated to English, &quot;Safavi&quot; would correspond roughly to &quot;Safi-ish&quot; or &quot;Safidian&quot; &quot;Safavi&quot; is the correct Persian language reference to &quot;Safi&quot; (Persian: صفی), the name of Sheikh Safi-ad-din Ardabili (Persian: صفی‌الدین اردبیلی). Similarly we speak of &quot;Edwardian&quot;, when making a reference to the era affiliated with king Edward VII. Sheikh Safi&#x27;s descendants have been going by this name for 770 years. There are numerous bearers of the name &quot;Safavi&quot; thriving in modern-day Iran, who claim descent from Sheikh Safi (Persian: شیخ صفی) or any of his royal heirs.

Many &quot;Safavis&quot; can still be found in East Azerbaijan, Ardebil Province and Isfahan Province – the former capital of the Safavid dynasty – and can also be found in Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan province. &quot;Safavi&quot;s can also be found all across Iran. Another branch of the family is found in South Lebanon under the names Safa and Jaber, a branch of the Safa family.

==Safavid==
The term &quot;Safavid&quot;, as in Safavid dynasty (of which Sheikh Safi is the Eponym), is likewise referred to as &quot;Safavi&quot; by Persian speakers. The &quot;d&quot; at the end of &quot;Safavid&quot; was added by the principle of analogy with the Greek-derived names of several ancient dynasties, such as the Achaemenid dynasty and the Sassanid dynasty, based on the oblique cases of the Greek names. The English adjective &quot;Safavid&quot; and the name &quot;Safavids&quot; for the dynasty, and the corresponding forms in many European languages, are therefore based on a redundant application of adjective-forming rules.

The names &quot;Safavid/Safavids&quot; are well-established in the English language, however, and have become legitimate terms. When added to a Shah&#x27;s name however, the original &quot;Safavi&quot;, without the &quot;d&quot; at the end, must always be retained, e.g., Shah Ismail I Safavi.

<doc id="304064" wikidata="Q1094637" url="?curid=304064" title="Clerical celibacy">
<text>Clerical celibacy is the requirement in certain religions that some or all members of the clergy be unmarried. Clerical celibacy also requires abstention from deliberately indulging in sexual thoughts and behavior outside of marriage, because these impulses are regarded as sinful. Vows of celibacy are generally required for monks and nuns in Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism and other religions, but often not for other clergy. 

Within the Catholic Church, clerical celibacy is mandated for all clergy in the Latin Church except in the permanent diaconate. Exceptions are sometimes admitted for ordination to transitional diaconate and priesthood on a case-by-case basis for married clergymen of other churches or communities who become Catholics, but ordination of married men to the episcopacy is excluded (see Personal ordinariate). Clerical marriage is not allowed and therefore, if those for whom in some particular church celibacy is optional (such as permanent deacons in the Latin Church) wish to marry, they must do so before ordination. Eastern Catholic Churches either follow the same rules as the Latin Church or require celibacy for bishops while allowing priestly ordination of married men.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodoxy, celibacy is the norm for bishops; married men may be ordained to the priesthood, but even married priests whose wives pre-decease them are not allowed to remarry after ordination. Similarly, celibacy is not a requirement for ordination as a deacon and in some Oriental Orthodox churches deacons may marry after ordination. For a period in the 5th and early 6th centuries the Church of the East did not apply the rule of celibacy even for ordination to the episcopate.

Lutheranism, Anglicanism and Nonconformist Protestantism in general do not require celibacy of its clergy and allow—or even encourage—clerical marriage. In the past, Lutheran deaconesses in the Church of Sweden took vows of celibacy, poverty and ties to a motherhouse; the vow of celibacy was made optional in the 1960s and in the present-day, Lutheran deacons/deaconesses (both male and female) may marry.

==Meanings of &#x27;celibacy&#x27;==
The word &quot;celibacy&quot; can mean either the state of being unmarried or sexual abstinence, especially because of religious vows, from sexual intercourse.

In the canon law of the Latin Church, the word &quot;celibacy&quot; is used specifically in the sense of being unmarried. However, for its clergy this state of being unmarried is considered to be a consequence of the obligation to be completely and perpetually continent:

Permanent deacons, namely those deacons who are not intended to become priests, are, in general, exempted from this rule. However, married permanent deacons are not allowed to remarry after the death of their spouse.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church states:

On the granting of permission, by exception, for the priestly ordination of married men in the Latin Church, see Rules, below.

==Background==
In some Christian churches, such as the western and some eastern sections of the Catholic Church, priests and bishops must as a rule be unmarried men. In others, such as the Eastern Orthodox Church, the churches of Oriental Orthodoxy and some of the Eastern Catholic Churches, married men may be ordained as deacons or priests, but may not remarry if their wife dies, and celibacy is required only of bishops. Since celibacy is seen as a consequence of the obligation of continence, it implies abstinence from sexual relationships. The Code of Canon Law prescribes:
Clerics are to behave with due prudence towards persons whose company can endanger their obligation to observe continence or give rise to scandal among the faithful. According to Jason Berry of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The requirement of celibacy is not dogma; it is an ecclesiastical law that was adopted in the Middle Ages because Rome was worried that clerics&#x27; children would inherit church property and create dynasties.&quot;

In some Christian churches, a vow of chastity is made by members of religious orders or monastic communities, along with vows of poverty and obedience, in order to imitate the life of Jesus of Nazareth (see also Evangelical counsels). This vow of chastity, made by people – not all of whom are clergy – is different from what is the obligation, not a vow, of clerical continence and celibacy.

Celibacy for religious and monastics (monks and sisters/nuns) and for bishops is upheld by the Catholic Church and the traditions of both Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy. Bishops must be unmarried men or widowers; a married man cannot become a bishop. In Latin Church Catholicism and in some Eastern Catholic Churches, most priests are celibate men. Exceptions are admitted, with there being several Catholic priests who were received into the Catholic Church from the Lutheran Church, Anglican Communion and other Protestant faiths. In most Orthodox traditions and in some Eastern Catholic Churches men who are already married may be ordained priests, but priests may not marry after ordination.

Neither the Catholic nor the Orthodox tradition considers the rule of clerical celibacy to be an unchangeable dogma, but instead as a rule that could be adjusted if the Church thought it appropriate and to which exceptions are admitted.

From the time of the first ecumenical council the Christian church forbids voluntary physical castration, and the alleged self-castration of the theologian Origen was used to discredit him.

==Clerical continence in Christianity==
===First century===
Some of the earliest Christian leaders were married men. The mention in Mark 1:30, Luke 4:38, and Matthew 8:14–15 of Peter&#x27;s mother-in-law indicates that he had at some time been married (Matthew 8:14–15: &quot;when Jesus was come into Peter&#x27;s house, he saw his wife&#x27;s mother laid, and sick of a fever.&quot;) According to Clement of Alexandria, &quot;Peter and Philip begat children&quot;, and Peter&#x27;s wife suffered martyrdom.

On the other hand, in Luke 18:28–30, Jesus responds to Peter&#x27;s statement that he and the other disciples had left all and followed him by saying &quot;there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God who will not receive back an overabundant return in this present age and eternal life in the age to come&quot;.

In 1 Corinthians 7:8, Paul the Apostle indicates that he was unmarried: either single or a widower. In 1 Corinthians 9:5, he contrasts his situation with that of the other apostles, including Peter, who were accompanied by believing wives. Paul, says Laurent Cleenewerck, a priest of the Orthodox Church in America and professor of theology at Euclid University, clearly favored celibacy, which he understood as &quot;a gift&quot;. Cleenewerck supports this statement by quoting 1 Corinthians 7:5–8:

In the same chapter Paul, who wrote that a pastor is to be &quot;the husband of one wife&quot;, forbids abstinence of marital relations except &quot;for a set time&quot; and states that celibacy is a gift.

A used in favour of sacerdotal celibacy is 1 Corinthians 7:32–33 (&quot;The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord. But the married man is anxious about worldly things, how to please his wife&quot;) and a used against sacerdotal celibacy is the statement in 1 Timothy 3:2–4 that a bishop should be &quot;the husband of one wife&quot; and &quot;one who ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection&quot;.

One interpretation of &quot;the husband of one wife&quot; is that the man to be ordained could not have been married more than once and that perfect continence, total abstinence, was expected from him starting on the day of his ordination. Usually these also conclude that, because of the exclusion of sexual relations, the members of the clergy were not entitled to marry after ordination.

Another interpretation of &quot;the husband of one wife&quot; was a prohibition of polygamy, which was not uncommon in the Old Testament (King David and King Solomon, for example, were polygamists).

On the other hand, George T. Dennis SJ of Catholic University of America says: &quot;There is simply no clear evidence of a general tradition or practice, much less of an obligation, of priestly celibacy-continence before the beginning of the fourth century.&quot; Peter Fink SJ agrees, saying that underlying premises used in the book, &quot;Apostolic Origins of Priestly Celibacy&quot;, &quot;would not stand up so comfortably to historical scrutiny&quot;. Dennis says this book provides no evidence that celibacy had apostolic origins.

Similarly, Philippe Delhaye wrote: &quot;During the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Celibacy was a matter of choice for bishops, priests, and deacons.[...] The apostolic constitutions () excommunicated a priest or bishop who left his wife &#x27;under pretense of piety&#x27; ( 1:51).&quot;

However, the 19th-century Protestant historian Philip Schaff evidences that by the early 4th century, priestly celibacy-continence was not a novelty, stating that all marriages contracted by clerics in Holy Orders were declared null and void in 530 by Emperor Justinian I, who also declared the children of such marriages illegitimate.

Catholic author Greg Dues states that:

===Second to third centuries===
Tertullian (), writing of the apostles, indicated that he was obliged to believe that apart from Peter, who was certainly married, the apostles were continent. In his , Tertullian mentioned continence as one of the customs in Mithraism that he claimed were imitated from Christianity, but does not associate it specifically with the clergy. In &quot;De exhortatione castitatis&quot;, Tertullian did regard with honour those in ecclesiastical orders who remained continent.

The , written in Greek in the first half of the 3rd century, mentions the requirements of chastity on the part of both the bishop and his wife, and of the children being already brought up, when it quotes 1 Timothy 3:2–4 as requiring that, before someone is ordained a bishop, enquiry be made &quot;whether he be chaste, and whether his wife also be a believer and chaste; and whether he has brought up his children in the fear of God&quot;.

There is record of a number of 3rd-century married bishops in good standing, even in the West. They included: Passivus, bishop of Fermo; Cassius, bishop of Narni; Aetherius, bishop of Vienne; Aquilinus, bishop of Évreux; Faron, bishop of Meaux; Magnus, bishop of Avignon. Filibaud, bishop of Aire-sur-l&#x27;Adour, was the father of Philibert de Jumièges, and Sigilaicus, bishop of Tours, was the father of Cyran of Brenne. No statement is made about whether they had children after becoming bishops or only before.

&quot;A famous letter of Synesius of Cyrene ( ) is evidence both for the respecting of personal decision in the matter and for contemporary appreciation of celibacy. For priests and deacons clerical marriage continued to be in vogue&quot;.

The consequence of the requirement from higher clerics who lived in marriages to abstain permanently from sexual intercourse with their wives was prohibition for those who were single of entering a marriage after ordination. The Apostolic Canons of the Apostolic Constitutions decreed that only lower clerics might still marry after their ordination. Bishops, priests, and deacons were not allowed.

===Fourth century===
The Council of Elvira (306) is often seen as the first to issue a written regulation requiring clergy to abstain from sexual intercourse. Its canon 33 decreed: &quot;Bishops, presbyters, deacons, and others with a position in the ministry are to abstain completely from sexual intercourse with their wives and from the procreation of children. If anyone disobeys, he shall be removed from the clerical office.&quot; It is disputed whether this canon mandated permanent continence or only, as is the practice in the Eastern Orthodox Church even for the laity, periodical continence before partaking of the Eucharist. and Maurice Meigne even interpreted it as meaning: &quot;It was decided to forbid keeping back from one&#x27;s wife and not producing children&quot;.

In 387 or 390, or according to others in 400, a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests and deacons abstain from conjugal relations: &quot;It is fitting that the holy bishops and priests of God as well as the Levites, i.e. those who are in the service of the divine sacraments, observe perfect continence, so that they may obtain in all simplicity what they are asking from God; what the Apostles taught and what antiquity itself observed, let us also endeavour to keep... It pleases us all that bishop, priest and deacon, guardians of purity, abstain from conjugal intercourse with their wives, so that those who serve at the altar may keep a perfect chastity.&quot;

The Directa Decretal of Pope Siricius (385) states: &quot;We have indeed discovered that many priests and deacons of Christ brought children into the world, either through union with their wives or through shameful intercourse. And they used as an excuse the fact that in the Old Testament—as we can read—priests and ministers were permitted to beget children.&quot; Two other Papal decrees of the time, and , demanded an end to the &quot;scandal&quot; of priests failing to uphold perpetual sexual abstinence, and rejected the claim that St. Paul had permitted priests to remain married by declaring that Paul only meant to disbar polygamists. Both decrees described continence as an ancient obligation from scripture and the tradition of the Church fathers.

Hilary of Poitiers (315–368), a Doctor of the Church, was a married bishop and had a daughter named Apra, who was baptized together with her father, when he and his wife became Christians. Among Popes of the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries, the father of Pope Damasus I (366–384) was a bishop. Pope Felix III (483–492), whose father was almost certainly a priest, was the great-great-grandfather of Pope Gregory I the Great (590–604). Pope Hormisdas (514–523) was the father of Pope Silverius (536–537). No statement is given on whether, among these, the children in question were born when their fathers were still laymen.

As for the East, the Greek ecclesiastical historians Socrates and Sozomen, who wrote a century after the event, reported that the First Council of Nicaea (325) considered ordering all married clergy to refrain from conjugal relations, but the Council was dissuaded by Paphnutius of Thebes.

According to Sozomen&#x27;s history:

The Council of Nicaea, AD 325, decides in Canon 3:

The term refers to an unmarried woman living in association with a man in a merely spiritual marriage, a practice that seems to have existed already in the time of Hermas; in the 4th century such a woman was also referred to as an &quot;agapeta&quot;. Stefan Heid has argued that the pre-Nicaean acceptance of that arrangement for clerics was an indication that the clergy were expected to live in continence even with their wives.

A leading participant in the Council, Eusebius of Caesarea, wrote: &quot;It is fitting that those in the priesthood and occupied in the service of God, should abstain after ordination from the intercourse of marriage.&quot;

Epiphanius of Salamis (died 403) accused the heretics whom he called &quot;Purists&quot; of &quot;mixing up everyone&#x27;s duty&quot;:

Similar evidence of the existence in the 4th-century East, as in the West, of a rule or at least an ideal of clerical continence for bishops that was considered to be canonical is found in Epiphanius&#x27;s Panarion, 48, 9 and , 21. Synesius (died ), who refused to be bound by the obligation, knew that, if made a bishop, he was expected to live in continence with his wife. One of the accusations against Antoninus, Bishop of Ephesus, in his trial before John Chrysostom was that &quot;after separating from his married wife, he had taken her again&quot;. In his note on this phrase, the translator Herbert Moore says: &quot;According to the &#x27;Apostolic Canons&#x27;, only the lower orders of clergy were allowed to marry after their appointment to office; the Council in Trullo ordered that a bishop&#x27;s wife should retire to a convent, or become a deaconess; that of Neo-Caesarea, that if a priest marries after ordination he must be degraded. For Antoninus to resume relations with his wife was equivalent to marriage after ordination. It was proposed at the Council of Nicaea that married clergy should be compelled to separate from their wives, but the proposal was rejected; though it was generally held that the relations of bishops with their wives should be those of brother and sister.&quot;

The 4th-century Church Fathers Ambrose and Jerome argued that the passage in 1 Timothy 3:2–4 did not conflict with the discipline they knew, whereby a married man who became a bishop was to abstain from sexual relations and not marry again: &quot;He speaks of having children, not of begetting them, or marrying again&quot;; &quot;He does not say: Let a bishop be chosen who marries one wife and begets children; but who marries one wife, and has his children in subjection and well disciplined. You surely admit that he is no bishop who during his episcopate begets children. The reverse is the case—if he be discovered, he will not be bound by the ordinary obligations of a husband, but will be condemned as an adulterer.&quot;

According to Epiphanius of Salamis, also of the 4th century, Nicholas, one of the Seven Deacons of Acts 6:1–6, noticed others being admired for their celibacy. To avoid seeming immoderately devoted to his beautiful wife and therefore inferior in his ministry, he renounced conjugal intercourse forever. While he was able to remain continent for a while, eventually his burning desire overpowered him. However, he did not want to be regarded as inconsistent or seen as taking his oath lightly. Instead of returning to his wife, he engaged in promiscuous sex and what Epiphanius termed &quot;sex practices against nature&quot;. In this way, he started Nicolaism, an antinomian heresy which believed that as long as they abstained from marriage, it was not a sin to exercise their sexual desires as they pleased. Revelation 2:6 and 15 expresses hatred for the &quot;works of the Nicolaitans&quot;.

Jerome, referred in &quot;Against Jovinianus&quot; to marriage prohibition for priests when he argued that Peter and the other apostles had been married, but had married before they were called and subsequently gave up their marital relations. The Paphnutius legend in the first half of the 5th century called the marriage prohibition an ancient ecclesiastical tradition. In &quot;Against Vigilantius&quot;, Jerome testified that the Churches of the East, Egypt and of the Apostolic See &quot;accept for the ministry only men who are virgins, or those who practice continency, or, if married, abandon their conjugal rights&quot;

===Fifth to seventh centuries===
In saying that &quot;in certain provinces it is permitted to the readers and singers to marry&quot;, the Council of Chalcedon (451) suggests that, in other provinces, not only bishops, priests, deacons and subdeacons, but even those in the lower orders of readers and singers were at that time not permitted to marry.

According to Gregory of Tours, Namatius a 5th century bishop of Clermont was married and his wife was involved in the construction of St Stephen&#x27;s church in Clermont.

Needless to say, the rule or ideal of clerical continence was not always observed either in the West or in the East, and it was because of violations that it was from time to time affirmed. Emperor Justinian I (died 565) ordered that &quot;sacred canons permit neither the pious presbyter, nor the devoted deacons or subdeacons to contract marriage after their ordination&quot;. If they, &quot;in disregard of the sacred canons, have children by women with whom, according to sacerdotal regulation, they may not cohabit&quot; their children would be considered illegitimate on the same level as those &quot;procreated in incest and in nefarious nuptials&quot;, while the clergy would be &quot;deprived of their priesthood, their sacred ministry and the dignity itself which they hold.&quot; As for bishops, he forbade &quot;any one to be
ordained bishop who has children or grandchildren&quot;.

Canon 13 of the Quinisext Council (Constantinople, 692) shows that by that time there was a direct contradiction between the ideas of East and West about the legitimacy of conjugal relations on the part of clergy lower than the rank of bishop who had married before being ordained:

The canon mistakenly claims that the canon of the late-4th-century Council of Carthage quoted above excluded conjugal intercourse by clergy lower than bishops only in connection with their liturgical service or in times of fasting. The Council of Carthage excluded such intercourse perpetually and made no distinction between bishops, priests and deacons.

There have been no changes since then in the discipline of the Eastern Orthodox Church, which for bishops, priests, deacons, and subdeacons excludes marriage after ordination, but allows, except for periods before celebrating the Divine Liturgy, conjugal relations by priests and deacons married before ordination, and requires celibacy and perpetual continence only of bishops.

The last married Pope was Adrian II (r. 867–872), who was married to Stephania, with whom he had a daughter. He was married before his ordination, and was elected Pope only in old age.

===11th and 12th centuries===
In 888, two local councils, that of Metz and that of Mainz, prohibited cohabitation even with wives living in continence. This tendency was taken up by the 11th-century Gregorian Reform, which aimed at eliminating what it called &quot;Nicolaitism&quot;, that is clerical marriage, which in spite of being theoretically excluded was in fact practised, and concubinage.

The First Lateran Council (1123), a General Council, adopted the following canons:

The phrase &quot;contract marriage&quot; in the first part of canon 21 excludes clerical marriages, and the marriages that the second part says must be dissolved may possibly be such marriages, contracted after ordination, not before. Canon 3 makes reference to a rule made at the First Council of Nicaea (see above), which is understood as not forbidding a cleric to live in the same house with a wife whom he married before being ordained.

Sixteen years later, the Second Lateran Council (1139), in which some five hundred bishops took part, enacted the following canons:

This Council thus declared clerical marriages not only illicit though valid, as before, but invalid (&quot;we do not regard as matrimony&quot;). The marriages in question are, again, those contracted by men who already are &quot;bishops, priests, deacons, subdeacons, canons regular, monks and professed clerics&quot;. And later legislation, found especially in the Quinque Compilationes Antiquae and the Decretals of Gregory IX, continued to deal with questions concerning married men who were ordained legally. In 1322, Pope John XXII insisted that no one bound in marriage—even if unconsummated—could be ordained unless there was full knowledge of the requirements of church law. If the free consent of the wife had not been obtained, the husband, even if already ordained, was to be reunited with his wife, exercise of his ministry being barred. Accordingly, the assumption that a wife might not want to give up her marital rights may have been one of the factors contributing to the eventual universal practice in the Latin Church of ordaining only unmarried men.

However, although the decrees of the Second Council of the Lateran might still be interpreted in the older sense of prohibiting marriage only after ordination, they came to be understood as absolute prohibitions, and, while the fact of being married was formally made a canonical impediment to ordination in the Latin Church only with the 1917 Code of Canon Law, the prohibition of marriage for all clerics in major orders began to be taken simply for granted. The Second Lateran Council is thus often cited as having for the first time introduced a general law of celibacy, requiring ordination only of unmarried men. Somewhat inaccurately, since several of the Eastern Catholic Churches allow married men to be ordained (though not to be consecrated as bishops), the New Catholic Encyclopedia states: &quot;The Second Lateran Council (1139) seems to have enacted the first written law making sacred orders a diriment impediment to marriage for the universal Church.&quot;.

===16th century===
While the 11th-century Gregorian Reform&#x27;s campaign against clerical marriage and concubinage met strong opposition, by the time of the Second Council of the Lateran it had won widespread support from lay and ecclesiastical leaders.

New opposition appeared in connection with the Protestant Reformation, not only on the part of the Reformers, but also among churchmen and others who remained in union with the see of Rome. Figures such as Panormitanus, Erasmus, Thomas Cajetan, and the Holy Roman Emperors Charles V, Ferdinand I and Maximilian II argued against it.

In practice, the discipline of clerical continence meant by then that only unmarried men were ordained. Thus, in the discussions that took place, no distinction was made between clerical continence and clerical celibacy.

The Reformers made abolition of clerical continence and celibacy a key element in their reform. They denounced it as opposed to the New Testament recommendation that a cleric should be &quot;the husband of one wife&quot; (see on 1 Timothy 3:2–4 above), the declared right of the apostles to take around with them a believing Christian as a wife (1 Corinthians 9:5) and the admonition, &quot;Marriage should be honoured by all&quot; (Hebrews 13:4). They blamed it for widespread sexual misconduct among the clergy.

Against the long-standing tradition of the Church in the East as well as in the West, which excluded marriage after ordination, Zwingli married in 1522, Luther in 1525, and Calvin in 1539. And against what had also become, though seemingly at a later date, a tradition in both East and West, the married Thomas Cranmer was made Archbishop of Canterbury in 1533.

The Council of Trent considered the matter and at its twenty-fourth session decreed that marriage after ordination was invalid: &quot;If any one saith, that clerics constituted in sacred orders, or Regulars, who have solemnly professed chastity, are able to contract marriage, and that being contracted it is valid, notwithstanding the ecclesiastical law, or vow; and that the contrary is no thing else than to condemn marriage; and, that all who do not feel that they have the gift of chastity, even though they have made a vow thereof, may contract marriage; let him be anathema: seeing that God refuses not that gift to those who ask for it rightly, neither does He suffer us to be tempted above that which we are able&quot;.

It also decreed, concerning the relative dignity of marriage and celibacy: &quot;If any one saith, that the marriage state is to be placed above the state of virginity, or of celibacy, and that it is not better and more blessed to remain in virginity, or in celibacy, than to be united in matrimony; let him be anathema.&quot;

==Rules for Christian clergy==

Rules on celibacy differ between different religious traditions and churches:
* In the Church of Sweden, a Lutheran Church, the vow of clerical celibacy, along with those to a motherhouse, and to a life of poverty, was required of deacons/deaconesses until the 1960s; this vow of celibacy was dropped and deacons/deaconesses in the Church of Sweden may be married.
* In the Latin (Western) Catholic Church, since the Second Vatican Council mature married men who intend not to advance to priesthood may be ordained deacons and are referred to as &quot;permanent deacons&quot;, but married men may not be ordained priests or bishops or even as &quot;transitional deacons&quot;, nor may anyone marry &quot;after&quot; ordination. Since the start of the pontificate of Pope Pius XII (1939–1958), exceptions may be allowed for married Protestant ministers, including Lutheran or Anglican clergy, who convert to Catholicism and wish to become priests in the Catholic Church, provided their wives consent. The Catholic Church considers Protestant, including most Anglican ordinations invalid, while recognizing Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox. In some cases, laicized Catholic priests are allowed to marry by special dispensation. Additionally, dispensations can be granted for deacons whose wives have died to marry a second time, especially if they have young children to look after.
* In Eastern Orthodox Churches, and Eastern Catholic Churches (which latter are in full communion with Rome), married men may be ordained to any order except as bishops, and one may not marry &quot;after&quot; ordination as a subdeacon. The Oriental Orthodox churches follow the same rules as in the Eastern Orthodox Church for bishops and priests, but the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, and the Syriac Orthodox Church permit ordained deacons to marry, while the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria does not allow it. For much of the 5th century, the Church of the East allowed even bishops to marry, but in the early 6th century decided to ordain only celibate monks to episcopacy, while still allowing priests to marry after ordination. While some incorrectly believe all Orthodox bishops must be monks, in fact, according to church law, they simply may no longer be living with their wives if they are to be consecrated to the episcopacy. (The canons stipulate that they must also see to their wives&#x27; maintenance, for example Canon 12 of the Quinisext Council.) Typically, the wife of such a man will take up the monastic life herself, though this also is not required. There are many Orthodox bishops currently serving who have never been tonsured (formally initiated) to monastic orders. There are also many who are tonsured monastics but have never formally lived the monastic life. Further, a number of bishops are widowers, but because clergy cannot remarry after ordination, such a man must remain celibate after the death of his wife. The Holy See&#x27;s 1929 decree &quot;Cum data fuerit&quot;, forbidding priestly ordination and ministry of married men in certain diaspora areas outside the home territories of the Eastern Catholic Churches, was revoked by a decree of June 2014.
* Churches of the Anglican Communion have no restrictions on the marriage of deacons, priests, bishops, or other ministers to a person of the opposite sex. Early Anglican Church clergy under Henry VIII were required to be celibate (see Six Articles), but the requirement was eliminated by Edward VI. Some Anglo-Catholic priestly orders require their members to remain celibate, as do monastic orders of all brothers and sisters.
* Most other Protestant traditions have no restrictions on the marriage of ministers or other clergy, except that in some circles divorced persons may not serve as pastors, and in practice the large majority of pastors are married.

== Other religions ==
* In Hinduism, priests can marry. At the same time, monks in Hindu monasteries and saddhus or individual ascetics, are usually expected to withdraw from saṃsāra (&#x27;the world&#x27;), and practice celibacy. The idea is to keep the mind free from distraction caused by sex-life and use that focus in serving God.
* The traditions of monasticism within Buddhism require celibacy. Several cultures, in particular American Zen traditions, have revised this and now have forms of married lay teachers, who are distinct from the celibate clergy. Moreover, in the countries of Southeast Asia practicing Theravada Buddhism, a tradition exists of young men becoming ordained as monks for brief periods (typically a few weeks and generally no more than a year) upon completing education, but then leaving monastic life, and continuing to return to the monastery for short periods of reflection even after marriage (if the wife consents). Many Japanese monks and priests were celibate up to the time of the Meiji Restoration.
* In Jainism, Monks do not marry from the day they enter Jain monasticism.
* Judaism has no history of celibacy for its leaders, including rabbis and kohanim. Before the destruction of the Jerusalem temple, priests (kohanim) and Levites were required to practice continence (abstain from sexual intercourse with their wives) before and during their time of service at the temple. They were permitted to resume marital relations after completing their service. Some community functions are, as a rule, filled only by married men. Marriage is encouraged for everyone and men are obligated to have children.
* In Islam, lifelong celibacy or monasticism is forbidden. Marriage is encouraged for everyone.
* Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints reject lifelong clerical celibacy. All worthy males can receive a priesthood office beginning with that of deacon in the year that they turn 12 years of age. A young man is usually encouraged to delay marriage until after he has been ordained an elder and served two years as a full-time missionary for his church. Generally, only married men are called to be bishops (who preside over local congregations designated as wards), and marriage in the temple and faithfulness to it are seen as necessary for salvation in the highest heaven. All Latter-day Saints, including members of the priesthood, are expected to entirely abstain from unchaste conduct.

==The Catholic Church today==

Celibacy is represented in the Catholic Church as having apostolic authority. Theologically, the church desires to imitate the life of Jesus with regard to chastity and the sacrifice of married life for the &quot;sake of the Kingdom&quot; (Luke 18:28–30, Matthew 19:27–30; Mark 10:20–21), and to follow the example of Jesus Christ in being &quot;married&quot; to the church, viewed by Catholicism and many Christian traditions as the &quot;Bride of Christ&quot;. Also of importance are the teachings of Paul that chastity is the superior state of life, and his desire expressed in 1 Corinthians 7:7–8, &quot;I would that all men were even as myself [celibate]—but every one has his proper gift from God; one after this manner, and another after that. But I say to the unmarried and the widows. It is good for them if they so continue, even as I.&quot;

Practically speaking, the reasons for celibacy are given by the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 7:7–8; 32–35: &quot;But I would have you to be without solicitude. He that is without a wife is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please God. But he that is with a wife, is solicitous for the things of the world, how he may please his wife: and he is divided. And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit. But she that is married thinketh on the things of this world how she may please her husband. And this I speak for your profit, not to cast a snare upon you, but for that which is decent and which may give you power to attend upon the Lord without impediment.&quot;

1 Corinthians 9:5 is sometimes cited by those opposed to mandatory clerical celibacy, as the verse is often rendered as referring to the Apostles carrying &quot;wives&quot; with them. Even apart from disputes about the significance of the word translated as &quot;wives&quot;, this passage is of doubtful relevance to the rule of celibacy for priests of the Latin Church, which was introduced much later and is seen only as a &quot;discipline&quot; within that particular church alone, not a &quot;doctrine&quot; binding all: in other words, a church regulation, but not an integral part of church teaching. Peter, the first pope, as well as many subsequent popes, bishops, and priests during the church&#x27;s first 270 years were in fact married men, and often fathers of children. The practice of clerical continence, along with a prohibition of marriage after ordination as a deacon, priest or bishop, is traceable from the time of the Council of Elvira of approximately 305–306. This law was reinforced in the Directa Decretal (385) and at the Council of Carthage in 390. The tradition of clerical continence developed into a practice of clerical celibacy (ordaining only unmarried men) from the 11th century onward among Latin Church Catholics and became a formal part of canon law in 1917. This law of clerical celibacy does not apply to Eastern Catholics. Until recently, the Eastern Catholic bishops of North America would generally ordain only unmarried men, for fear that married priests would create scandal. Since Vatican II&#x27;s call for the restoration of Eastern Catholic traditions, a number of bishops have returned to the traditional practice of ordaining married men to the presbyterate. Bishops are still celibate and normally chosen from the ranks of ordained monks.

In the Latin Church exceptions are sometimes made. After the Second Vatican Council a general exception was made for the ordination as deacons of men of at least thirty-five years of age who are not intended to be ordained later as priests and whose wives consent to their ordination. Since the time of Pope Pius XII individual exceptions are sometimes made for former non-Catholic clergymen. Under the rules proposed for personal ordinariates for former Anglicans, the ordinary may request the Pope to grant authorization, on a case-by-case basis, for admission to ordination in the Catholic Church of married former Anglican clergy (see Personal ordinariate#Married former Anglican clergy and rules on celibacy).

Because the rule of clerical celibacy is a law and not a doctrine, exceptions can be made, and it can, in principle, be changed at any time by the Pope. Both Pope Benedict XVI and Pope John Paul II spoke clearly of their understanding that the traditional practice is unlikely to change. Pope Francis, however, has called for consideration of the question of electing so-called viri probati for the ordination to the priesthood, particularly in areas like Amazonia where there is an acute shortage of priests.

=== Amazon Synod in Rome in October 2019 ===
In October 2019, many of the bishops at the Amazon Synod in Rome said that married priests should be allowed in the Roman Catholic Church. Pope Francis neglected the celibacy issue in the post-synodal documents, maintaining prior rules on celibacy for Catholic priests.

===Historical lack of enforcement===
Despite the Latin Church&#x27;s historical practice of priestly celibacy, there have been Catholic priests throughout the centuries who have engaged in sexual relations through the practice of concubinage.

In February 2019, the Catholic Church acknowledged that the church&#x27;s celibacy policy has not always been enforced and that at some point in history, the Vatican enacted secret rules to protect priests who violated their vows of celibacy. The rules even applied to Catholic clergy who fathered children by doing so as well. Some of those who were fathered by Catholic clergy also publicly came forward.

Some clergy who violated the celibacy policy, which also forbids marriage for clergy who did not convert from Protestant faiths, such as Lutheranism or Anglicanism, have also maintained their clerical status after marrying women in secret. One example was shown in the Diocese of Greensburg in Pennsylvania, where a priest maintained his clerical status after he had married a girl he impregnated. In 2012, Kevin Lee, a priest in Australia, revealed that he had maintained his clerical status after he had secretly married for a full year and that church leaders were aware of his secret marriage but disregarded the celibacy policy. The same year, it was revealed that former Los Angeles Auxiliary Bishop Gabino Zavala had privately fathered two children, who were not twins, and had &quot;more than a passing relationship&quot; with their mother before he resigned from his post as Auxiliary Bishop and from the Catholic clergy.

<text>Dynamic Debugging Technique (DDT) is a series of debugger programs originally developed for Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) hardware, initially known as DEC Debugging Tape because it was distributed on paper tape. The name is a pun on the insecticide DDT. The first version of DDT was developed at MIT for the PDP-1 computer in 1961, but newer versions on newer platforms continued to use the same name. After being ported to other vendor&#x27;s platforms and changing media, the name was changed to the less DEC-centric version. Early versions of Digital Research&#x27;s CP/M and CP/M-86 kept the DEC name DDT (and DDT-86 and DDT-68K) for their debugger, however, now meaning Dynamic Debugging Tool. The CP/M DDT was later superseded by the &quot;Symbolic Instruction Debugger&quot; (SID, ZSID, SID86, and GEMSID) in DR DOS and GEM.

In addition to its normal function as a debugger, DDT was also used as a top-level command shell for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS) operating system; on some more recent ITS systems, &quot;PWORD&quot;—which implements a restricted subset of DDT&#x27;s functionality—is run first and is overlaid with DDT as soon as the user logs in. DDT could run and debug up to eight processes (called &quot;jobs&quot; on ITS) at a time, such as several sessions of TECO, and DDT could be run recursively - that is, some or all of those jobs could themselves be DDTs (which could then run another eight jobs, and so on). These eight jobs were all given unique names, and the usual name for the original and top-most DDT was &quot;HACTRN&quot; (&quot;hack-tran&quot;). Guy L. Steele wrote a filk poem parody of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Raven,&quot; entitled &quot;The HACTRN&quot;.

==DEC-10/DEC-20 DDT==
DDT (Dynamic Debugging Technique), as implemented on the DECsystem-10 &amp; DECSYSTEM-20 allowed references to symbols within the programming being debugged. This feature loaded symbols from the .EXE executable file; a special version named SDDT used symbols from the running monitor and allowed system programmers to &quot;peek&quot; inside.
