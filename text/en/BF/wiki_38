<text>Whitman College is a private liberal arts college in Walla Walla, Washington. The school offers 53 majors and 33 minors in the liberal arts and sciences, and it has a student-to-faculty ratio of 9:1. 

Founded as a seminary by a territorial legislative charter in 1859, the school became a four-year degree-granting institution in 1882 and abandoned its religious affiliation in 1907. It is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities and competes athletically in the NCAA Division III as a member of the Northwest Conference. 

Alumni have received 1 Nobel Prize in physics, 1 Presidential Medal of Freedom, 5 Rhodes Scholarships, and 93 Fulbright Fellowships.

== History ==
=== Whitman Seminary ===
In 1859, soon after the United States military declared that the land east of the Cascade Mountains was open for settlement by American pioneers, Cushing Eells traveled from the Willamette Valley to Waiilatpu, near present-day Walla Walla, where 12 years earlier, Congregationalist missionaries Marcus Whitman and Narcissa Whitman, along with 12 others were killed by a group of Cayuse Indians during the Whitman Massacre. While at the site, Eells became determined to establish a &quot;monument&quot; to his former missionary colleagues in the form of a school for pioneer boys and girls. Eells obtained a charter for Whitman Seminary, a pre-collegiate school, from the territorial legislature. From the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, he acquired the Whitman mission site. Eells soon moved to the site with his family and began working to establish Whitman Seminary.

Despite Eells&#x27;s desire to locate Whitman Seminary at the Whitman mission site, local pressure and resources provided a way for the school to open in the burgeoning town of Walla Walla. In 1866, Walla Walla&#x27;s wealthiest citizen, Dorsey Baker, donated land near his house to the east of downtown. A two-story wood-frame building was quickly erected and classes began later that year. The school&#x27;s first principal, local Congregational minister Peasly B. Chamberlin, resigned within a year and Cushing Eells was called upon to serve as principal, which he did until 1869. After Eells&#x27;s resignation in 1869, the school struggled—and often failed—to attract students, pay teachers, and stay open for each term.

=== From seminary to college ===
Whitman&#x27;s trustees decided in 1882 that while their institution could not continue as a prep school, it might survive as the area&#x27;s only college. Alexander Jay Anderson, the former president of the Territorial University (now the University of Washington), came to turn the institution into a college and become its president. After modeling the institution after New England liberal arts colleges, Anderson opened the school, Whitman College, on September 4, 1882 (Marcus Whitman&#x27;s birthday) with an enrollment of 60 students and three senior faculty (Anderson, his wife and son). In 1883, the school received a collegiate charter and began expanding with aid from the Congregational American College and Education Society.

=== Financial turmoil and new leadership ===
Despite local support for Whitman College and help from the Congregational community, financial troubles set in for the school. After losing favor with some of the school&#x27;s supporters, Anderson left Whitman in 1891 to be replaced by Reverend James Francis Eaton. The continuing recession of the 1890s increased the institution&#x27;s financial worries and lost Eaton his backing, leading to his resignation in 1894.

Reverend Stephen Penrose, an area Congregational minister and former trustee, became president of the college and brought the school back to solvency by establishing Whitman&#x27;s endowment with the aid of D. K. Pearsons, a Chicago philanthropist. By popularizing Marcus Whitman&#x27;s life and accomplishments (including the false claim that the missionary had been pivotal in the annexation by the United States of Oregon Territory), Penrose was able to gain support and resources for the college. Under his leadership, the faculty was strengthened and the first masonry buildings, Billings Hall and the Whitman Memorial Building, were constructed.

=== End of religious affiliation ===
In 1907, Penrose began a plan called &quot;Greater Whitman&quot; which sought to transform the college into an advanced technical and science center. To aid fundraising, Penrose abandoned affiliation with the Congregational Church, and became unaffiliated with any denomination. The prep school was closed and fraternities and sororities were introduced to the campus. Ultimately, this program was unable to raise enough capital; in 1912, the plan was abandoned and Whitman College returned to being a small liberal arts institution, albeit with increased focus on co-curricular activities. Penrose iterated the school&#x27;s purpose &quot;to be a small college, with a limited number of students to whom it will give the finest quality of education&quot;. In 1920 Phi Beta Kappa installed a chapter, the first for a Northwest college, and Whitman had its first alum Rhodes Scholar.

=== World War II ===
During World War II, Whitman was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

== Campus ==

Whitman&#x27;s 117 acre campus is located in downtown Walla Walla, Washington. Most of the campus is centered around a quad, which serves as the location for intramural field sports. Around this, Ankeny Field, sits Penrose Library, Olin Hall and Maxey Hall, and two residence halls, Lyman and Jewett. South of Ankeny Field, College Creek meanders through the main campus, filling the artificially created &quot;Lakum Duckum&quot;, the heart of campus and the habitat for many of Whitman&#x27;s beloved ducks.

The oldest building on campus is the administrative center, Whitman Memorial Building, commonly referred to as &quot;Mem&quot;. Built in 1899, the hall, like the college, serves as a memorial to Marcus and Narcissa Prentiss Whitman. The building is the tallest on campus and was placed on the National Historical Register of Historic Places in 1974. The oldest residence halls on campus, Lyman House and Prentiss Hall, were built in 1924 and 1926. Over the next fifty years, the college built or purchased several other buildings to house students, including the former Walla Walla Valley General Hospital, which was transformed into North Hall in 1978. In addition to the nine residence halls, many students choose to live in one of eleven &quot;Interest Houses,&quot; run for sophomore, juniors, and seniors committed to specific focuses such as community service, fine arts, environmental studies, multicultural awareness, or the French, Spanish, or German languages. These houses, like most of the residential architecture of Walla Walla, are in the Victorian or Craftsman style.

In addition to property in Walla Walla, the college also has about of other land holdings – mainly in the form of wheat farms in Eastern Washington and Oregon. Of special note: the Johnston Wilderness Campus, which is used for academic and social retreats.

== Academics ==
Whitman College focuses solely on undergraduate studies in the liberal arts. All students must take a two-semester course their first year, Encounters, which examines cultural interactions throughout history and gives students a grounding in the liberal arts. Students choose from courses in 48 major fields and 34 minor fields and have wide flexibility in designing independent study programs, electing special majors, and participating in internships and study-abroad programs. In addition, Whitman is noted for a strong science program. Its three most popular majors, based on 2021 graduates, were: Biological and Biomedical Sciences (33), Research and Experimental Psychology (32), and Economics (30).

In early 2021, Whitman president Kathleen Murray proposed substantial cuts to a number of social science, humanities, arts, and other academic programs in anticipation of a $3.5 million budget deficit for the 2021–2022 academic year, prompting criticism from students, faculty, and alumni.

Degrees are awarded after successful completion of senior &quot;comprehensive exams&quot;. These exams vary depending on the students&#x27; primary focus of study, but commonly include some combination of (i) a senior thesis, (ii) written examination, and (iii) oral examination. The oral examination is either a defense of the student&#x27;s senior thesis, or is one or multiple exams of material the student is expected to have learned during their major. The written exam is either a GRE subject test or a test composed by the department.

For students who are interested in foreign policy, Whitman is one of 16 institutions participating in the two-year-old Thomas R. Pickering Foreign Affairs Fellowship program. The State Department pays for fellows to obtain their master&#x27;s degree at the university of their choice in return for three years of service as a Foreign Service Officer. Whitman has a number of alumni who serve in diplomatic corps.

=== Combined programs ===
Whitman also offers combined programs in conjunction with several institutions throughout the United States:

* 3–2 programs in engineering with the California Institute of Technology, Columbia University, University of Washington, and Washington University in St. Louis;
* 3–2 programs in forestry and environmental management with Duke University, leading to a Master of Environmental Management or an MBA degree;
* A 3–2 program in oceanography at University of Washington, leading to a Whitman B.A. and a University of Washington B.S. in Oceanography.

=== Off-campus programs ===
Whitman offers a &quot;Semester in the West&quot; program, a field study program in environmental studies, focusing on ecological, social, and political issues confronting the American West. During every other fall semester since 2002, 21 students leave Walla Walla to travel throughout the interior West for field meetings with a variety of leading figures in conservation, ecology, environmental writing, and social justice.

Whitman also offers &quot;The U.S.-Mexico Border Program&quot; every other June. The program is based in Arizona and Sonora, Mexico, and exposes students to a wide range of competing perspectives on the politics of immigration, border enforcement, and globalization.

Since 1982, &quot;Whitman in China&quot; provides Whitman alumni the opportunity to teach English at Northwestern Polytechnical University, Shantou University, or Yunnan University. Participants receive an immersion experience in urban Chinese culture, where they can witness the rapid modernization of the country. At the same time, Whitman alumni give Chinese university students the rare chance to study with an English native speaker.

Whitman also offers a large range of year- or semester-long off-campus study programs - 88 programs across 40 countries, and a few short-term, faculty-led programs.
=== Student Engagement Center ===
In 2010, under the leadership of (former) President George Bridges, Whitman centralized and integrated various programs intended to help students connect their in-class learning to off-campus work, volunteer, and internship opportunities in the Walla Walla Valley. The office that emerged, the Student Engagement Center (SEC), houses community service and career services in one place. Students and alumni can get assistance with resumes, cover letters, networking, internships, interviews, grad school applications, and civic engagement in the SEC.

=== Admissions ===
Whitman&#x27;s admission selectivity is considered &quot;more selective&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. For the Class of 2023 (enrolling Fall 2019), Whitman received 4,823 applications and accepted 2,697 (55.9%), with 425 enrolling. The middle 50% range of SAT scores for enrolling freshmen was 630-710 for evidence-based reading and writing, and 610-740 for math. The middle 50% ACT score range was 25-31 for math, 30-35 for English, and 28-33 for the composite.

For 2020, students of color (including non-citizens) made up 36.8% of the incoming class; international students were 8.8% of enrolling freshmen.

In May 2022, Whitman College announced a $10 million donation made in memory of long-time professor of 35 years J.Walter Weingart. The donation is set to fund full scholarships for all in-state students with financial need. The J. Waler and Katherine Weingart opportunity scholarship will begin distribution in 2023 and will annually support 500 in-state students.

== Athletics ==

Whitman holds membership in the NCAA&#x27;s Northwest Conference (Division III) and fields nine varsity teams each for men and women. More than 20 percent of students participate in a varsity sport. In addition, 70 percent of the student body participates in intramural and club sports. These sports include rugby union, water polo, lacrosse, dodgeball, and nationally renowned cycling and ultimate teams. In 2016, the college adopted the new mascot for the school and its athletes of the &quot;Blues&quot;, named after the local mountain range. Whitman&#x27;s athletic teams had formerly used the nickname &quot;Missionaries&quot;.

As a junior in 2012–13, basketball player Ben Eisenhardt led the Northwest Conference (NWC) in scoring (442 points), became the first Missionary to be named to the National Association of Basketball Coaches Division 3 All-American Third Team as a junior, and was named NWC Player of the Year.

The club-sport-level Whitman cycling team has won the DII National Championships for two years, and four times in six years, making them the athletic team at Whitman with the most national championships. The women&#x27;s ultimate team, also a club sports team, finished second to Stanford in Division I play in 2016.
The football program began in 1892 and ended in March 1977; the last winning season was in 1969.

== Student life ==
Of the 1,579 undergraduate students enrolled in Whitman College in the fall of 2019, 55.3% were female and 44.7% male. There are over one hundred student activities, many of which focus on student activism and social improvement, such as Whitman Direct Action and Global Medicine.

=== Greek life ===
Greek life has a long history at Whitman, with many chapters dating back to a century or more and having the first chapters in the Pacific Northwest. Some claim that around 33% of students are involved in the Greek system.

=== KWCW 90.5 FM ===
KWCW 90.5 FM is a Class A radio station owned and operated by the Whitman Students&#x27; Union, the Associated Students of Whitman College (ASWC).

&quot;K-dub&quot; as it is known to students, is located inside the Reid Campus Center on Whitman Campus. At a power of 160 watts, the station&#x27;s range is approximately 15 miles (24 km), broadcasting as well as streaming online

<doc id="298273" wikidata="Q4989857" url="?curid=298273" title="Émigré">
<text>An émigré () is a person who has emigrated, often with a connotation of political or social exile or self-exile. The word is the past participle of the French verb &quot;émigrer&quot; meaning &quot;to emigrate&quot;.

==French Huguenots==
Many French Huguenots fled France following the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685.

==The American Revolution==
Many Loyalists that made up large portions of colonial United States, particularly in the South, fled the United States during and after the American Revolution. Common destinations were other parts of the British Empire, such as Upper Canada, Nova Scotia, Great Britain, Jamaica, and the British West Indies. The new government often awarded the lands left by the fleeing Tories to Patriot soldiers by way of land grants.

==The French Revolution==

Although the French Revolution began in 1789 as a bourgeois-led drive for increased political equality for the Third Estate, it soon turned into a violent popular rebellion. To escape political tensions and sometimes in fear for their lives, some emigrated from France, settling in neighboring countries, chiefly Great Britain, Spain, Germany, Austria, and Prussia. A few also migrated to North America.

==Partitions of Poland and Polish uprisings==
 Throughout the nineteenth century Poland was occupied by the partitioning powers of Poland: Austria, Prussia and Russia. Poles struggled for independence in a series of failed uprisings, which resulted in many having to seek refuge in Western Europe (known as the Wielka Emigracja) in order to avoid reprisals, such as being forcefully sent to the vast and harsh emptiness of Siberia. The exiles included artists, soldiers, politicians and prisoners-of-war who escaped from captivity. Most of the political émigrés based themselves in France.

The spirit of Polish émigrés lives on through one of the unofficial mottos of Poland: For our freedom and yours () 

==The Russian Revolution==
The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent Russian Civil War led many notable political and intellectual figures to leave Russia and neighboring states. Among these, Russian &quot;White&quot; émigrés, who fervently opposed the new communist regime, fled west after their defeat in the civil war. Other groups would also leave Russia, most notably the Mensheviks as well as leaders and intellectuals from defeated countries such as the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic and the Democratic Republic of Georgia.

Marx and Engels, drafting their strategy for future revolutions in &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;, suggested confiscating the property of émigrés to finance the revolution—a recommendation the Bolsheviks followed 70 years later.

After the October Revolution, more than 20,000 émigrés went to Finland and Yugoslavia, notably Pyotr Wrangel. Many however moved on to France. Paris was the favourite destination for Russian émigrés. Many others traveled east to China, especially to Harbin and Shanghai.

==Twentieth-century émigrés==
Aristocrats of some European countries were forced to leave their native lands by political upheavals from the beginning of the 20th century to the end of World War II opting to emigrate elsewhere such as the Serbs and Romanians in 1945 and after, Hungarians in 1956 and the Czechs and Slovaks in 1968.

In 2016, 5,411 US citizens living in other countries relinquished their US citizenship. This is often attributed to extraterritorial laws on US citizens, such as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010. In comparison, there were only 235 expatriations in 2008.

== South Africa ==
After the historical electoral victory in South Africa by the ANC (African National Congress) in 1994, many Afrikaners emigrated from South Africa to other countries, citing discrimination in employment and social violence as reasons.

According to the 2011 Australian census there are 145,683 South African émigrés, born in South Africa, in Australia, of whom 30,291 reside in the city of Perth or greater Perth area.

<text>The Bible code (, ), also known as the Torah code, is a purported set of encoded words within a Hebrew text of the Torah that, according to proponents, has predicted significant historical events. The statistical likelihood of the Bible code arising by chance has been thoroughly researched, and it is now widely considered to be statistically insignificant, as similar phenomena can be observed in any sufficiently lengthy text. Although Bible codes have been postulated and studied for centuries, the subject has been popularized in modern times by Michael Drosnin&#x27;s book &quot;The Bible Code&quot; (1997) and the movie &quot;The Omega Code&quot; (1999).

Some tests purportedly showing statistically significant codes in the Bible were published as a &quot;challenging puzzle&quot; in a peer-reviewed academic journal in 1994, which was pronounced &quot;solved&quot; in a subsequent 1999 paper published in the same journal.

==Overview==
Discussion around one specific steganographic method became widespread in 1994 when Doron Witztum, Eliyahu Rips and Yoav Rosenberg published a paper, &quot;Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis&quot;, in the scientific journal &quot;Statistical Science&quot;. The paper, which was presented by the journal as a &quot;challenging puzzle&quot;, presented what appeared to be strong statistical evidence that biographical information about famous rabbis was encoded in the text of the Book of Genesis, centuries before those rabbis lived.

==Equidistant letter sequence method==

The primary method by which purportedly meaningful messages have been extracted is the &quot;Equidistant Letter Sequence&quot; (ELS), also referred to as (, ). Letters are selected based on a starting point and counting every nth letter based on a given &#x27;skip number&#x27; in a given direction. For example, taking every fourth letter in the phrase &quot;his entnce its n EL&quot;, when read backwards and ignoring spaces, derives the word &#x27;Safest&#x27;.

In some cases, multiple terms may be derived from an &#x27;ELS letter array&#x27; (text in a grid, with the same number of letters in each line). In the example provided, part of the King James Version&#x27;s rendering of Genesis (26:5–10) is shown with 21 letters per line, showing ELSs for &quot;Bible&quot; and &quot;code&quot;.

===Extensions===

Once a specific word has been found using the ELS method, other words are sought based on the same letter spacing. Code proponents Haralick and Rips have published an example of a longer, extended ELS, which reads, &quot;Destruction I will call you; cursed is Bin Laden and revenge is to the Messiah&quot;.

Proponents claim that such ELS extensions that form phrases or sentences have statistical significance, maintaining that the longer the extended ELS, the less likely it is to be the result of chance. Critics reply, as in the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; deconstruction of 1997, that the longer ELS is in fact effectively nothing more than further increased number of permutations, employing a massive application of the look-elsewhere effect.

==History==
===Early history===
The 13th-century Spanish rabbi Bachya ben Asher described an ELS in the Bible. His four-letter example related to the traditional zero-point of the Hebrew calendar. Over the following centuries there are hints that the ELS technique was known, e.g. in Pardes Rimonim of the 16th century mystic Moshe Cordovero.

In the 20th century, many examples were found by Michael Ber Weissmandl and published by his students after his death in 1957. In the 1980s, some discoveries of Israeli school teacher Avraham Oren came to the attention of the mathematician Eliyahu Rips at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Rips then took up the study together with his religious studies partners Doron Witztum and Alexander Rotenberg, among several others.

===Rips and Witztum===

Rips and Witztum and Yoav Rosenberg designed computer software for the ELS technique and subsequently found many examples. About 1985, they decided to carry out a formal test, and the &quot;Great rabbis experiment&quot; was born. This experiment tested the hypothesis that ELS&#x27;s of the names of famous rabbinic personalities and their respective birth and death dates form a more compact arrangement than could be explained by chance. Their definition of &quot;compact&quot; was complex but, roughly, two ELSs were compactly arranged if they can be displayed together in a small window. When Rips &quot;et al.&quot; carried out the experiment, the data was measured and found to be statistically significant, supporting their hypothesis.

The &quot;great rabbis experiment&quot; went through several iterations, and was eventually published in 1994, in the peer-reviewed journal &quot;Statistical Science&quot;. The editorial board was highly skeptical due to the fact that computers can be used to &quot;mine&quot; data for patterns that intuitively seem surprising but upon careful analysis are found to be statistically insignificant. While they did find a number of possible sources of error, they were unable to find anyone willing to put in the substantial time and energy required to properly reanalyze the data. However, they did find it intriguing, and therefore decided to offer it as a &quot;challenging puzzle&quot; for anyone interested in doing so. An unintended result of this was that outsiders mistook this as a confirmation of the paper&#x27;s claims.

===Other experiments===

Another experiment, in which the names of the famous rabbis were matched against the places of their births and deaths (rather than the dates), was conducted in 1997 by Harold Gans, former Senior Cryptologic Mathematician for the United States National Security Agency.

Again, the results were interpreted as being meaningful and thus suggestive of a more than chance result. These Bible codes became known to the public primarily due to the American journalist Michael Drosnin, whose book &quot;The Bible Code&quot; (1997) was a best-seller in many countries. Rips issued a public statement that he did not support Drosnin&#x27;s work or conclusions; even Gans has stated that, although the book says the codes in the Torah can be used to predict future events, &quot;This is absolutely unfounded. There is no scientific or mathematical basis for such a statement, and the reasoning used to come to such a conclusion in the book is logically flawed.&quot; In 2002, Drosnin published a second book on the same subject, called &quot;Bible Code II: the Countdown&quot;.

The Jewish outreach group Aish HaTorah employs Bible codes in their Discovery Seminars to persuade secular Jews of the divinity of the Torah, and to encourage them to trust in traditional Orthodox Jewish teachings. Use of Bible code techniques also spread into certain Christian circles, especially in the United States. The main early proponents were Yakov Rambsel, who is a Messianic Jew, and Grant Jeffrey. Another Bible code technique was developed in 1997 by Dean Coombs (also Christian). Various pictograms are claimed to be formed by words and sentences using ELS.

Since 2000, physicist Nathan Jacobi, an agnostic Jew, and engineer Moshe Aharon Shak, an orthodox Jew, claim to have discovered hundreds of examples of lengthy, extended ELSs. The number of extended ELSs at various lengths is compared with those expected from a non-encoded text, as determined by a formula from Markov chain theory.

==Criticism==

The precise order of consonantal letters represented in the Hebrew Masoretic Text is not consistent across manuscripts in any period. It is known from earlier versions, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, that the number of letters was not constant even in the first centuries CE. The Bible code theory thus does not seem to account for these variations.

===Criticism of the original paper===

In 1999, Australian mathematician Brendan McKay, Israeli mathematicians Dror Bar-Natan and Gil Kalai, and Israeli psychologist Maya Bar-Hillel (collectively known as &quot;MBBK&quot;) published a paper in &quot;Statistical Science&quot;, in which they argued that the case of Witztum, Rips and Rosenberg (WRR) was &quot;fatally defective, and that their result merely reflects on the choices made in designing their experiment and collecting the data for it.&quot; The MBBK paper was reviewed anonymously by four professional statisticians prior to publication. In the introduction to the paper, Robert Kass, the Editor of the Journal who previously had described the WRR paper as a &quot;challenging puzzle&quot; wrote that &quot;considering the work of McKay, Bar-Natan, Kalai and Bar-Hillel as a whole it indeed appears, as they conclude, that the puzzle has been solved&quot;.

From their observations, MBBK created an alternative hypothesis to explain the &quot;puzzle&quot; of how the codes were discovered. MBBK&#x27;s argument was not strictly mathematical, rather it asserted that the WRR authors and contributors had intentionally:

# Selected the names and/or dates in advance, and;
# Designed their experiments to match their selection, thereby achieving their &quot;desired&quot; result.

The MBBK paper argued that the ELS experiment is extraordinarily sensitive to very small changes in the spellings of appellations, and the WRR result &quot;merely reflects on the choices made in designing their experiment and collecting the data for it.&quot;

The MBBK paper demonstrated that this &quot;tuning&quot;, when combined with what MBBK asserted was available &quot;wiggle&quot; room, was capable of generating a result similar to WRR&#x27;s Genesis result in a Hebrew translation of &quot;War and Peace&quot;. Bar-Hillel subsequently summarized the MBBK view that the WRR paper was a hoax, an intentionally and carefully designed &quot;magic trick&quot;.

===Replies to MBBK&#x27;s criticisms===
====Harold Gans====

Harold Gans, a former cryptanalyst at the National Security Agency, argued that MBBK&#x27;s hypothesis implies a conspiracy between WRR and their co-contributors to fraudulently tune the appellations in advance. Gans argues that the conspiracy must include Doron Witztum, Eliyahu Rips, and S. Z. Havlin, because they all say Havlin compiled the appellations independently. Gans argues further that such a conspiracy must include the multiple rabbis who have written a letter confirming the accuracy of Havlin&#x27;s list. Finally, argues Gans, such a conspiracy must also include the multiple participants of the cities experiment conducted by Gans (which includes Gans himself). Gans concludes that &quot;the number of people necessarily involved in [the conspiracy] will stretch the credulity of any reasonable person.&quot; Gans further argued that while &quot;the mathematical issues are difficult for non-mathematicians to comprehend, I can summarize as follows: Professor McKay and his colleagues never claimed to have discovered real codes in those non-Torah texts. Their only &quot;successful&quot; results were obtained by deliberately rigging the experiment in such a way that the layman wouldn&#x27;t recognize the mathematical flaws.&quot;

Brendan McKay has replied that he and his colleagues have never accused Havlin or Gans of participating in a conspiracy. Instead, says McKay, Havlin likely did what WRR&#x27;s early preprints stated he did, in providing &quot;valuable advices&quot;. Similarly, McKay accepts Gans&#x27;s statements that Gans did not prepare the data for his cities experiment himself. McKay concludes that &quot;there is only ONE person who needs to have been involved in knowing fakery, and a handful of his disciples who must be involved in the cover-up (perhaps with good intent).&quot;

====WRR authors====

The WRR authors issued a series of responses regarding the claims of MBBK, including the claim that no such tuning did or even could have taken place. An earlier WRR response to a request by MBBK authors presented results from additional experiments that used the specific &quot;alternate&quot; name and date formats which MBBK suggested had been intentionally avoided by WRR. Using MBBK&#x27;s alternates, the results WRR returned showed equivalent or better support for the existence of the codes, and so challenged the &quot;wiggle room&quot; assertion of MBBK. In the wake of the WRR response, author Bar-Natan issued a formal statement of non-response. After a series of exchanges with McKay and Bar-Hillel, WRR author Witztum responded in a new paper claiming that McKay had used smoke screen tactics in creating several straw man arguments, and thereby avoided the points made by WRR authors refuting MBBK. Witztum also claimed that, upon interviewing a key independent expert contracted by McKay for the MBBK paper, some experiments performed for MBBK had validated, rather than refuted, the original WRR findings. Witzum questioned why MBBK had expunged these results. McKay replied to these claims.

No publication in a peer reviewed scientific journal has appeared refuting MBBK&#x27;s paper. In 2006, four new Torah Codes papers were published at the IEEE Computer Society&#x27;s 18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR&#x27;06).

====Robert Aumann====

Robert Aumann, a game theorist and winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2005, has followed the Bible code research and controversy for many years. He wrote:

Following an analysis of the experiment and the dynamics of the controversy, stating for example that &quot;almost everybody included [in the controversy] made up their mind early in the game&quot;, Aumann concluded:

====Robert Haralick====

Robert Haralick, a Professor of Computer Science at the City University of New York, has checked the Bible Code for many years and became convinced of its validity. He contributed a new experiment, checking whether, besides the minimal ELS – in which it was known that WRR&#x27;s list was successful in Genesis and MBBK&#x27;s list was successful in War and Peace – there were other, non-minimal ELSs where there is convergence between the rabbis&#x27; names and their respective dates. This had the effect of checking convergence found at 2nd minimal ELSs, 3rd minimal ELSs and so on. According to Haralick, the results were impressive; WRR&#x27;s list was successful until the 20th minimal ELS, whereas MBBK&#x27;s list failed after the 2nd minimal ELS. Haralick lectured on the subject in front of the participants of the International Conference on Pattern Recognition in 2006.

===Criticism of Michael Drosnin===

Journalist Drosnin&#x27;s books have been criticized by some who believe the Bible code is real but that it cannot predict the future. On Drosnin&#x27;s claim of Yitzhak Rabin&#x27;s assassination, Drosnin wrote in his book &quot;The Bible Code&quot; (1997) that &quot;Yigal Amir could not be found in advance&quot;. Critics have noted a huge error in the &quot;code&quot; Drosnin claimed to have found: Drosnin misused the Biblical verse . Scholars note; &quot;For example, citing again the passage intersecting with Rabin: that passage is from Deuteronomy 4:42, but Drosnin ignores the words immediately following &quot;a murderer who will murder.&quot; What comes next is the phrase &quot;unwittingly&quot; (). This is because the verse deals with the cities of refuge where accidental killers can find asylum. In this case, then, the message would refer to an accidental killing of (or by) Rabin and it would therefore be wrong. Another message (p. 17) supposedly contains a &quot;complete&quot; description of the terrorist bombing of a bus in Jerusalem on February 25, 1996. It includes the phrase &quot;fire, great noise,&quot; but overlooks the fact that the letters which make up those two words are actually part of a larger phrase from which says: &quot;under the terebinth that was near Shechem.&quot; If the phrase does tell of a bus bombing, why not take it to indicate that it would be in Nablus, the site of ancient Shechem?&quot;

Drosnin also made a number of claims and alleged predictions that have since failed. Among the most important, Drosnin clearly states in his book &quot;The Bible Code II&quot;, published on December 2, 2002, that there was to be a World War involving an &quot;atomic holocaust&quot; that would allegedly be the end of the world. Another claim Drosnin makes in &quot;The Bible Code II&quot; is that the nation of Libya would develop weapons of mass destruction which would then be given to terrorists who would then use them to attack the West (specifically the United States). In reality, Libya improved relations with the West in 2003 and gave up all their existing weapons of mass destruction programs. A final claim Drosnin made in &quot;The Bible Code II&quot; was that Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat would allegedly be assassinated by being shot to death by gunmen which Drosnin specifically stated would be from the Palestinian Hamas movement. This prediction by Drosnin also failed, as Yasser Arafat died on November 11, 2004 of what was later declared to be natural causes (specifically a stroke brought on by an unknown infection).

<text>Zen Arcade is the second studio album by American punk rock band Hüsker Dü, released in July 1984 on SST Records. Originally released as a double album on two vinyl LPs, &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; tells the story of a young boy who runs away from an unfulfilling home life, only to find the world outside is even worse. &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; and subsequent Hüsker Dü albums were instrumental in the creation of the alternative rock genre, and it is considered by some to be one of the greatest rock albums of all time.

==Background==
Hüsker Dü had gained notice in the American indie music scene of the early 1980s as a fast, aggressive hardcore punk band. They were the first non-West Coast group signed to the California independent record label SST Records, which at the time specialized in releases by hardcore bands, most notably Black Flag. However, the trio&#x27;s music was becoming more melodic and nuanced with each album; songs such as &quot;Diane&quot; (from the EP &quot;Metal Circus&quot;), a true story about the rape and murder of a young woman, covered subjects not addressed in hardcore at the time, and the band indicated an interest in 1960s rock by covering The Byrds&#x27; &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;.

In an interview with Steve Albini for his &quot;Matter&quot; column in 1983, singer and guitarist Bob Mould told Albini: &quot;We&#x27;re going to try to do something bigger than anything like rock &amp; roll and the whole puny touring band idea. I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s going to be, we have to work that out, but it&#x27;s going to go beyond the whole idea of &#x27;punk rock&#x27; or whatever.&quot;

The band began rehearsing in preparation for the album during the summer of 1983, in a church-turned-punk squat in St. Paul, Minnesota. The band brainstormed lyrics and musical ideas during jam sessions that lasted several hours. Mould and drummer Grant Hart were the band&#x27;s songwriters, and prior to embarking to California to record &quot;Zen Arcade&quot;, Mould was moved (by artwork that Hart had done for another band that did not list songwriting credits) to demand that &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; list individual songwriter credits. This practice would continue on all of the band&#x27;s subsequent albums and would contribute to ever-growing tensions between Mould and Hart.

==Recording and production==
As their EP &quot;Metal Circus&quot; was being released, Hüsker Dü entered the Total Access Studio in Redondo Beach, California to record their next album with SST producer Spot. The band recorded 25 tracks, with all but two songs (&quot;Something I Learned Today&quot; and &quot;Newest Industry&quot;) being first takes, in 40 hours. The entire album was then mixed in one 40-hour session; the entire album took 85 hours to record and produce and cost $3,200. The band collaborated with underground contemporaries during recording; &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; contains guest vocals from ex-Black Flag vocalist Dez Cadena.

&quot;Eight Miles High&quot; was also recorded at the sessions and released as a non-album single in April 1984. In a 2019 interview with &quot;Stereogum&quot;, Mould talked about the track, saying, &quot;Everything we did in the studio, basic tracks, was first take. We did not want to use one of the songs from the album as a warm up track. We would jam a little. We had to do something, so that was the first song. We did that, and I did vocals right away to warm up. It&#x27;s a pretty crazy vocal take. It became this calling card, at the moment, for the band, coming out right before &quot;Zen Arcade&quot;.

&quot;Something I Learned Today&quot; and &quot;Newest Industry&quot; were the album&#x27;s only songs that were not recorded in one take.

==Composition==

=== Music ===
&quot;Zen Arcade&quot;, in line with previous Hüsker Dü albums, had a mainly hardcore punk focus, with songs such as &quot;Indecision Time&quot; and &quot;Pride&quot; displaying common traits of the hardcore punk genre. However, the album also marked the point where the band introduced a more melodic and guitar-driven musical style, with elements of acoustic folk (&quot;Never Talking to You Again&quot;), psychedelia (&quot;Hare Krsna&quot; and &quot;The Tooth Fairy and the Princess&quot;) and piano interludes (&quot;One Step at a Time,&quot; &quot;Monday Will Never Be the Same&quot;), concepts rarely touched upon in early &#x27;80s hardcore punk.

Indicative of the band&#x27;s desire for the album to be taken as a whole, no singles were released from it.

The opening song, written by guitarist Bob Mould, was often used to open their set as early as 1983. The lyric describes growing up and trusting few people. A fast-paced song with simple verse and chord progressions, it begins with a simple drum beat, then an undulating bass rhythm, and finally kicks into the verse riff. Mould and Hart harmonize vocally in the chorus.

===Lyrics===
&quot;Zen Arcade&quot; tells the story of a young man who runs away to escape a miserable and abusive home life (&quot;Broken Home, Broken Heart&quot;, &quot;Never Talking to You Again&quot;). The character briefly joins the military (&quot;Chartered Trips&quot;), turns to religion (&quot;Hare Krsna&quot;), and seems to find a tenuous peace through love (&quot;Somewhere&quot;) before losing his lover to drugs (&quot;Pink Turns to Blue&quot;). He reaches a point of despair, ultimately concluding that he won&#x27;t be able to change his circumstances (&quot;Newest Industry&quot;, &quot;Whatever&quot;) before waking up to find that the whole odyssey had occurred in his subconscious during a night of troubled sleep; the challenges of his life—for better or worse—remain in front of him (&quot;The Tooth Fairy and the Princess&quot;, &quot;Turn on the News&quot;). &quot;Reoccurring Dreams&quot;, a disorienting 14-minute instrumental that reprises a shorter instrumental interlude (&quot;Dreams Reoccurring&quot;), closes the album.

==Release==
While the band insisted sales would be strong for &quot;Zen Arcade&quot;, SST initially pressed only between 3,500 and 5,000 copies of the album. The album was out of stock for months afterward and the delay in further copies stifled sales.

==Critical reception==
Upon its release &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; received positive reviews in many mainstream publications, including &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In his review for &quot;Rolling Stone,&quot; David Fricke described &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; as &quot;the closest hardcore will ever get to an opera ... a kind of thrash &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Zen Arcade&quot; placed eighth in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; annual Pazz &amp; Jop poll and Robert Christgau declared in his annual review of the poll&#x27;s results that, while he preferred peers The Replacements&#x27; &quot;Let It Be&quot;, the song &quot;Turn On the News&quot; garnered his nomination for song of the year. The critical praise given to the album drew attention from major labels, including Warner Bros. Records, with whom Hüsker Dü would eventually sign in 1985.

==Legacy==
The release of &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; inspired SST label-mates Minutemen to record their own double album, &quot;Double Nickels on the Dime&quot; in 1984. By spring of 1985 &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; had sold 20,000 copies, and in subsequent years it has maintained a high critical status regardless of commercial success. AllMusic says in its review of the album that &quot;Hüsker Dü try everything&quot; and while &quot;that reckless, ridiculously single-minded approach does result in some weak moments,&quot; it is &quot;also the key to the success of &quot;Zen Arcade&quot;.&quot; In 1989, it was ranked No. 33 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has placed &quot;Turn On the News&quot; on its list of &quot;500 songs that shaped rock and roll.&quot; It was ranked No. 4 on &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of top 100 Alternative music albums, ahead of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; (No. 5), and Patti Smith&#x27;s &quot;Horses&quot; (No. 6). It was also ranked the 32nd best album of the 1980s by Pitchfork Media, who also included &quot;Pink Turns to Blue&quot; in &quot;The Pitchfork 500&quot;. Slant Magazine listed the album at No. 73 on its list of &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;. Andy Cairns, from the Northern Irish alternative band Therapy?, listed the album as his seventh favourite album of all time on an article for the online music publication &quot;Louder Than War&quot;. In the article, Cairns said &quot;I got this at a time when [I] needed to hear fearsome music that wasn&#x27;t just boneheaded rage. An album to completely lose yourself in, a punk headphone album. After sitting through the whole album the world takes on a different colour and taste. The first time [I] heard it [I] thought it sounded like The Byrds with a fuzzbox. I love not only the tunes but all the little interludes and backwards masking that goes on. The whole thing just shimmers from start to finish.&quot;
===Covers===
&quot;Zen Arcade&quot; was the subject of two tribute albums, &quot;Du Huskers: The Twin Cities Replays Zen Arcade&quot; (Synapse Recordings, 1993) and the fan-compiled &quot;Something I Learned Today: An International Tribute to Zen Arcade&quot; (Krapp, 2004).

<doc id="298282" wikidata="Q989467" url="?curid=298282" title="Wood Badge">
<text>The Wood Badge is an award for Scout leader training, first awarded by The Boy Scouts Association in the United Kingdom in 1919 and subsequently adopted, with variations, by some other Scout organizations. Wood Badge courses teach Scout leadership skills and instil an ideological bond and commitment to the organizations. Courses generally have theory and practical phases followed by a practice project. Scouters who complete the course are awarded a pair of wood beads on each end of a leather thong, from a necklace of beads Robert Baden-Powell claimed to have taken from the African chief Dinizulu.

== Insignia ==

The Wood Badge is worn around the neck as part of the Scouter&#x27;s uniform. In some Scout organizations, the wood badge is presented together with a Gilwell scarf and a Gilwell woggle, denoting membership of the notional 1st Gilwell Scout Group.

=== Beads ===
Early Wood Badge beads came from a necklace that Baden-Powell claimed to have taken from a deserted Zulu mountain stronghold while on a failed military campaign to capture Dinizulu in Zululand (now part of South Africa). Such necklaces of beads made from acacia, known as &quot;iziQu&quot; in Zulu, were presented to brave warrior leaders. In 1919, Baden-Powell threaded beads from the necklace he had taken onto leather thong he claimed had been given to him by an elderly South African in Mafeking and called it the &quot;Wood Badge&quot;.

When produced, the thong is joined by a simple overhand knot but the two ends of the thong are often tied together with a decorative diamond knot. Various rituals are practiced in tying the diamond knot, such as having a fellow course member tie it, having a mentor or course leader tie it or having the recipient tie it after completing an additional activity that shows they have mastered training skills.

==== Additional beads ====
Additional beads are awarded for completion of training for different levels.

===Gilwell scarf or neckerchief===

The Gilwell scarf is a triangular scarf or neckerchief made of cotton or wool twill with a taupe face and red back, with a patch of Clan MacLaren tartan affixed near the point. The patch of Maclaren clan tartan honours William de Bois Maclaren, The Boy Scouts Association commissioner who donated £7000 to The Boy Scouts Association in 1919 to purchase Gilwell Park as a leader training centre and an additional £3000 for improvements to the house on the estate. The Maclaren tartan represents the Wood Badge and training ties to Gilwell Park. Originally, the scarf was made entirely of triangular pieces of the tartan but its expense forced the adoption of the current design.

===Gilwell woggle===

The Gilwell woggle is a braided leather two or three-strand Turk&#x27;s head knot, which has no beginning and no end and symbolizes the commitment to the Scout Movement. In some countries, Wood Badge training is divided into parts and the Gilwell woggle is given for completion of part one. First designed in the early 1920s by British Scouter Bill Shankley, making a Turk&#x27;s head knot woggle was part of the leader training scheme by 1926.

== Scout leader training course ==

=== History ===
The Boy Scouts Association conducted early Scoutmaster training camps in London and Yorkshire. The first Wood Badge training, with 18 participants, was organized by The Boy Scouts Association and held from 8 to 19 September 1919 at its newly acquired leader training centre, Gilwell Park, then just outside London. The training was led by The Boy Scouts Association&#x27;s Gilwell Park Camp Chief, Francis Gidney and its Commissioner for Training Percy Everett, with lectures by Baden-Powell and others. Wood Badge training courses continued at Gilwell Park. Other sites providing Wood Badge training have taken the Gilwell name.

=== Modern curriculum ===
The principles underpinning the Wood Badge Training Scheme are: 

*&quot;Continuous Development&quot;: Emphasizes continuous adult development from both internal and external sources. 
*&quot;Essential Areas&quot; Directed to include &quot;Fundamentals of Scouting, Leadership and Team Management, Project management, Communication and Adult development.&quot;
*&quot;Progressive With Multi-Entry Points&quot; Adaptive to varying skill and knowledge levels. 
*&quot;Not Time-Bound&quot; 
*&quot;Adaptable&quot; Specifies that it be flexible, adaptable and responsive to the evolving needs of young people, adults and the scout organizations. 
*&quot;Recognizing and Using the Scout Method&quot;
*Acceptance of the Principles and Practices of the &quot;Safe from Harm&quot; framework
*&quot;Recognition of Individual Development&quot; Direct that in each country establish a framework of skills to be attained and the participants be recognized when they are attained. 

Included in the areas above, a Wood Badge competence framework is directed to cover development of the competencies in the following topic clusters:
* Scouting (fundamentals) essentials such as Essential Characteristics of Scouting, Youth Program Implementation, Vision and Growth, Safe from Harm, etc.
* Leadership and Management such as situational leadership, team management and development, taking initiative, leading change, learning organization, etc.
* Project management such as generating ideas, working on plans and solutions, achieving results, evaluating success etc.
* Communicating meaningfully, effectively and with cultural sensitivity.
* Adult development such as facilitating learning, organizing training, providing coaching and mentoring support etc.
Every suggested topic is directed to have a list of competencies developed through various training programs.

Generally, a Wood Badge course consists of classroom work, a series of self-study modules, outdoor training and the Wood Badge &quot;ticket&quot; or &quot;project&quot;. Classroom and outdoor training are often combined and taught together and occur over one or more weeks or weekends. As part of completing this portion of the course, participants must write their tickets.

The exact curriculum varies from country to country but the training generally includes both theoretical and experiential learning. All course participants are introduced to the &quot;1st Gilwell Scout group&quot; or &quot;Gilwell Scout Troop 1&quot; (the latter name is used in the Boy Scouts of America and some other countries). In the Boy Scouts of America, they are also assigned to one of the traditional Wood Badge &quot;critter&quot; patrols. Instructors deliver training designed to strengthen the patrols. One-on-one work with an assigned troop guide helps each participant to reflect on what they have learned, so that he can better prepare an individualized &quot;ticket&quot;. This part of the training program gives the adult Scouter the opportunity to assume the role of a Scout joining the original &quot;model&quot; troop, to learn firsthand how a troop ideally operates. The locale of all initial training is referred to as &quot;Gilwell Field&quot;, no matter its geographical location.

=== Ticket ===
The phrase &#x27;working your ticket&#x27; comes from a story attributed in Scouting legend to Baden-Powell: Upon completion of a British soldier&#x27;s service in India, he had to pay the cost of his ticket home. The most affordable way for a soldier to return was to engineer a progression of assignments that were successively closer to home.

Part of the transformative power of the Wood Badge experience is the effective use of metaphor and tradition to reach both heart and mind. In most Scout associations, &quot;working your ticket&quot; is the culmination of Wood Badge training. Participants apply themselves and their new knowledge and skills to the completion of items designed to strengthen the individual&#x27;s leadership and the home unit&#x27;s organizational resilience in a project or &quot;ticket&quot;. The ticket consists of specific goals that must be accomplished within a specified time, often 18 months due to the large amount of work involved. Effective tickets require much planning and are approved by the Wood Badge course staff before the course phase ends. Upon completion of the ticket, a participant is said to have earned his way back to Gilwell.

=== On completion ===
After completion of the Wood Badge course, participants are awarded the insignia in a Wood Badge bead ceremony. They receive automatic membership in the national 1st Gilwell Park Scout Group or Gilwell Troop 1. Within scouting, these leaders are henceforth called Gilwellians or Wood Badgers. It is estimated that worldwide over 100,000 Scouters have completed their Wood Badge training.

=== 1st Gilwell Scout Group ===
The 1st Gilwell Scout Group is a notional Scout Group composed of Wood Badge recipients. A meeting of the Group is held annually, during the first weekend in September at Gilwell Park for the Gilwell Reunion. Gilwell Reunions are also held in other places, often on that same weekend.

===Training camp symbols===
==== Axe and Log ====

The axe and log logo was conceived by the first Camp Chief, Francis Gidney, in the early 1920s to distinguish Gilwell Park from the Scout Headquarters. Gidney wanted to associate Gilwell Park with the outdoors and Scoutcraft rather than the business or administrative Headquarters offices. Scouters present at the original Wood Badge courses regularly saw axe blades masked for safety by being buried in a log. Seeing this, Gidney chose the axe and log as the totem of Gilwell Park.

==== Other symbols ====

The kudu horn is another Wood Badge symbol. Baden-Powell first encountered the kudu horn at the Battle of Shangani, where he discovered how the Matabele warriors used it to quickly spread a signal of alarm. He used the horn at the first Scout encampment at Brownsea Island in 1907. It is used from the early Wood Badge courses to signal the beginning of the course or an activity and to inspire Scouters to always do better.

The grass fields at the back of the White House at Gilwell Park are known as the Training Ground and The Orchard and are where Wood Badge training was held from the early years onward. A large oak, known as the &quot;Gilwell Oak&quot;, separates the two fields. The Gilwell Oak symbol is associated with Wood Badge, although the beads for the Wood Badge have never been made of this oak.

Wolf Cub leaders briefly followed a separate training system beginning in 1922, in which they were awarded the &quot;Akela Badge&quot; on completion. The badge was a single fang on a leather thong. Wolf Cub Leader Trainers wore two fangs. The Akela Badge was discontinued in 1925 and all leaders were awarded the Wood Badge on completion of their training. Very few of the fangs issued as Akela Badges can now be found.

== International training centers and trainers ==

=== Australia ===
The first Australian Wood Badge courses were held in 1920 at Gilwell Park, Gembrook after the return of two deputy camp chiefs, Charles Hoadley and Mr. Russell from training at Gilwell Park in England. In 2003, Scouts Australia established its Scouts Australia Institute of Training, a government-registered National Vocational &amp; Education Training (VET) provider and awards a &quot;Diploma of Leadership and Management&quot; to adult leaders who complete the Wood Badge training and additional competencies. The VET qualifications are recognized throughout Australia by government and private industry.

=== Austria ===
The first Wood Badge Training in Austria took place in 1932. Scoutmaster Joesef Miegl took his Wood Badge training in Gilwell Park and September 8 to 17, 1922, he led a Leader Training near Vienna, one of the first in Austria. Scouters from Austria, Germany, Italy and Hungary took part. He brought in many things he learned in Gilwell Park about International and British Scouting but it was not an official Wood Badge training.

=== Belgium ===
The first Wood Badge training in Belgium was held in August 1923 at Jannée, led by Étienne Van Hoof.
In the largest Scout association of the country, known as Les Scouts – Fédération des Scouts Baden-Powell de Belgique, it is necessary to complete the 3-steps formation in 3 years. After the 3 steps, the scout leader become a Wood Badger and he receives a Certificate as an animator in a holiday centre (Brevet d’animateur en centre de vacances (BACV)) by the French Community of Belgium.

===Canada===
Scouts Canada requires that Scouters (volunteers) are required to complete an online Wood Badge Part I Course, and are encouraged to complete a Wood Badge Part II program that includes self-directed learning, conducted through mentorship and coaching in addition to traditional courses and workshops. Upon completion of the Wood Badge Part II program a volunteer is awarded their &quot;beads&quot; and the Gilwell Neckerchief.

=== Finland ===
Alfons Åkerman gave the first eight Wood Badge courses and was from 1927 to 1935 the first Deputy Camp Chief. In lieu of Gilwell training, the Finnish Scouts have a &quot;Kolmiapila-Gilwell&quot; (Trefoil-Gilwell), combining aspects of both girls&#x27; and boys&#x27; advanced leadership training.

=== France ===
The first Wood Badge training in France was held Easter 1923 by Père Sevin in Chamarande.

=== Ireland ===
Wood Badge training in Ireland goes back to the 1st Larch Hill of the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland, who conducted Wood Badge courses that emphasized the Catholic approach to Scouting. This emphasis is now disappeared since the formation of Scouting Ireland.

=== Hungary ===
In 2010, 21 year after the reorganization of Hungarian Scout Association, was the first Scoutmaster training with the Wood Badge. (There was other Scoutmaster training before but these weren&#x27;t organized according to the Wood Badge Framework.) The head of the first Wood Badge training in Hungary was Balázs Solymosi who has four beads. From 2010 to 2018, in 8 courses more than 50 adult leader performed successfully and awarded. In 2019 started a new era in Wood Badge training in Hungary. Two type of courses are available: one for leaders in the Association and one for local group leaders. The association level have the basis made by Balázs Solymosi, the group leader level based on a new training program. Both program gives the highest level of scouting knowledge from different point of view for the participants.

===Madagascar===
The First Wood Badge training of the Tily eto Madagasikara, known as the first Lasy Ravinala, was held in 1957 at Dinta Ambohidratrimo, Antananarivo, led by the first malagasy Chief Commissioner Samuel Randria. 

In Madagascar, the participants of the Wood badge camp can only wear the woggle. They will get their first two bead one year later after writing and defend a dissertation. The Gilwell scarf can only be worn by a three-bead (Trainer) and a four-bead (Trainer of trainer) holder.

=== The Netherlands ===

The first Wood Badge training in the Netherlands was held in July 1923 by Scoutmaster Jan Schaap, on Gilwell Ada&#x27;s Hoeve, Ommen. At Gilwell Sint Walrick, Overasselt, the Catholic Scouts had their training. Since approximately 2000, the Dutch Wood Badge training takes place on the Scout campsite &quot;Buitenzorg&quot;, Baarn, or outdoors in Belgium or Germany under the name &#x27;Gilwell Training&#x27;.

=== Norway ===
In Norway, Woodbadge is known as Trefoil-Gilwell Training.

=== Philippines ===
Wood Badge was introduced in the Philippines in 1953 with the first course held at Camp Gre-Zar in Novaliches, Quezon City. Today, Wood Badge courses are held at the Philippine Scouting Center for the Asia-Pacific Region, at the foothills of Mount Makiling, Los Baños, Laguna province.

=== Sweden ===
As in several other Nordic countries, the Swedish Wood Badge training is known as Trefoil Gilwell, being a unification of the former higher leadership programmes of the Swedish Guides and Scouts, known respectively as the Trefoil training and the Gilwell training.

=== United Kingdom ===
The first Wood Badge training took place at Gilwell Park. The estate continues to provide the service for British Scouters of The Scout Association and international participants. Original trainers include Baden-Powell and Gilwell Camp Chiefs Francis Gidney, John Wilson and John Thurman.

=== United States ===
Wood Badge was introduced to the United States by Baden-Powell. The first course was held in 1936 at the Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation, the Boy Scouts of America national training center until 1979. Despite this early first course, Wood Badge was not formally adopted in the United States until 1948 under the guidance of Bill Hillcourt who became the first national Deputy Camp Chief of Gilwell in the BSA, also called the Deputy Camp Chief for the United States. Wood Badge courses are held throughout the country at local council camps, others are held at the National High Adventure Bases.

<doc id="298284" wikidata="Q542093" url="?curid=298284" title="Operation Pegasus">
<text>Operation Pegasus was a military operation carried out on the Lower Rhine near the village of Renkum, close to Arnhem in the Netherlands. Overnight on 22–23 October 1944, Allied military forces, Britain&#x27;s MI9 intelligence organisation, and the Dutch Resistance evacuated 138 men, mostly soldiers trapped in German-occupied territory who had been in hiding since the Battle of Arnhem a month earlier.

The fighting north of the Rhine in September had forced the 1st British Airborne division to withdraw, leaving several thousand men behind. Several hundred of these were able to evade capture and go into hiding with the assistance of the Dutch Resistance. Initially, the men hoped to be able to wait for the British 2nd Army to resume its advance and thus rescue them, but when it became clear that the Allies would not cross the Rhine that year, the men decided to escape back to Allied territory. The first escape operation (Pegasus I) was a success, but a second operation (Pegasus II) was compromised and failed. Despite this, the Resistance continued to help the evaders and many more men were able to escape in small groups over the winter.

==Background==

===Battle of Arnhem===

In September 1944, the Western Allies launched Operation Market Garden, an attempt by the British 2nd Army to bypass the Siegfried Line and advance into the Ruhr, Germany&#x27;s industrial heartland. The operation required the First Allied Airborne Army to seize several bridges over rivers and canals in the Netherlands, allowing ground forces to advance and cross the Lower Rhine at Arnhem. The 1st British Airborne Division dropped onto Arnhem on 17 September. They encountered far greater resistance than had been expected and only a small force were able to reach Arnhem road bridge. XXX Corps ground advance became delayed and without reinforcement this small force under Lt Colonel John Frost was overwhelmed. The rest of the division became trapped in a small perimeter in Oosterbeek and were withdrawn on the night of 25/26 September in Operation Berlin. More than 10,400 British and Polish paratroopers fought in the battle of Arnhem. In Operation Berlin, between 2,400 and 2,500 men escaped to the south bank, leaving some 7,900 men behind. Of these almost 1,500 were killed and more than 6,000 were captured by the Germans. At the end of the battle, 500 paratroopers were still in hiding in villages north of the Nederrijn (lower Rhine River).

==Organising the escape==
MI9, the British intelligence agency formed to help soldiers and airmen stranded behind enemy lines evade German capture, parachuted agent Dick Kragt into the Netherlands in June 1943. Prior to the Battle of Arnhem in September 1944, Kragt, his deputy Joop Piller, and their escape organisation helped more than 100 allied airmen shot down over the occupied Netherlands to escape to Brussels, Belgium from where the Comet Escape Line guided the downed airmen to Spain and hence to safety in England. Thus, by the time of the Battle of Arnhem, MI9 had experienced agents in the Netherlands to help stranded allied military personnel.

Airey Neave of MI9 arrived in Nijmegen in early October 1944 to assist in the rescue of the British soldiers located near Arnhem and hiding from the Germans. Major Hugh Fraser of the Special Air Service (SAS) joined him as his second-in-command. Nijmegen (captured by the allies in Operation Market Garden) was south of Arnhem with two large river crossings, the Waal and the Lower Rhine separating the two cities. Neave and Fraser found a way to communicate by telephone from Nijmegen to the Dutch Resistance in Ede where many of the British soldiers were hiding and received nightly reports about casualties and evaders which greatly assisted in the planning of Pegasus. The telephone link was crucial in planning the operation.

In a decision he later acknowledged as poor, Neave sent Captain Peter Baker into German-controlled territory to contact the Dutch Resistance, but Baker, who &quot;fancied himself as a secret agent&quot; disobeyed orders and was captured on 16 October, disrupting plans for the evacuation of the soldiers. Baker survived as a prisoner of war, but the Ebbens family who sheltered him were executed. The Dutch civilians who hid and gave shelter and food to the stranded soldiers ran a greater risk than did the soldiers. Captured soldiers were sent to prisoner of war camps; Dutch civilians who helped the soldiers were often executed. The Germans were aware that a large number of British soldiers were hiding near Arnhem and were actively searching for them. 

Inside German controlled territory, Major Digby Tatham-Warter had escaped a German hospital as early as 21 September and, having lain low for a week, came into contact with the Dutch Resistance in the town of Ede. In early October he was joined by Brigadier Gerald Lathbury and soon a &#x27;Brigade HQ in hiding&#x27; was set up. Tatham-Warter made contact with of the Belgian SAS who arranged supply drops of weapons, uniforms and supplies for the growing number of British hiding in the area.

Piet Kruijff, head of the local Resistance, had been organising the evaders into safe houses in Ede. Soon there were over 80 men in the town and it was becoming so congested that he began housing men in as well. By the time of the evacuation an additional 40 men were there. At first it was hoped that the Allied offensive would be quickly resumed thus liberating the men. Tatham-Warter even made plans to carry out operations against the Germans when the 2nd Army began crossing the Rhine. However, in October Kirschen informed the Resistance that there were no plans to attack north of the Lower Rhine in the near future. As the presence of so many Allied evaders would place a great strain on the Resistance and expose the civilians hiding them to great risk, it was decided to evacuate the men as soon as possible.

The &#x27;HQ in hiding&#x27; near Arnhem was in contact with MI9 and 2nd Army in Nijmegen. Lt Colonel David Dobie (commander of 1st Battalion) was rowed across the Rhine by a young Dutchman on the night of 16 October and reached Allied lines. Dobie contacted the XXX Corps and the 101st Airborne Division, who approved the proposed evacuation. Dobie was appointed to lead the evacuation with Neave and Fraser as his intelligence officers. They contacted Tatham-Warter by telephone and drew up a plan they hoped would allow all of the men in hiding to escape.

Dobie selected a location on the river near Renkum to make the crossing of the Rhine (codenamed Digby). The Rhine was wide. A route to the river from the north were decided upon, and it was arranged that the men would be met on the north bank by Royal Canadian Engineers and British Royal Engineers of XXX Corps escorted by men of the 506 PIR, 101st Airborne Division. To help guide the evaders the crossing point would be marked by tracer fire from a Bofors gun. The American forces sent patrols north of the river and tracer fire over the river for several nights to disguise the actual purpose of the operation when it came. The date was set for the night of 23–24 October.

==Pegasus I==
On 20 October the Germans ordered residents of villages near Arnhem to leave their homes by the 22nd. Deciding to take advantage of the confusion this would cause, the date for the operation was brought forward to the night of 22–23 October.

The Pegasus operation required the combined efforts of MI9, the Dutch Resistance, and British and American soldiers. The Dutch Resistance was asked to collect the stranded soldiers from their hiding places and take them to a location near the village of Renkum, west of Arnhem on the German-controlled north side of the lower Rhine River. From the south bank of the river, controlled by the allies, the Royal Engineers of the British Army crossed the river in rowing boats accompanied by American paratroopers who were there to provide combat support, if needed. Neave and Fraser of MI9 set up a command centre in a farmhouse near Randwijk to greet the evaders on the southern bank of the Rhine after they had successfully crossed.

The German presence in this area was very heavy after the Arnhem fighting and the men assembled in a location only from German machine gun nests. By dark 139 men had assembled. They were mainly from the 1st Airborne Division, but there were also a US 82nd Airborne Division trooper, a number of aircrew, some Dutch civilians, and some Russians wishing to join the Allies. The men were organised into platoons and at 9 pm began moving south towards the river. Tatham-Warter recorded that the Germans were almost certainly aware of their presence, but perhaps unsure of their numbers and wary of American patrols, they kept some distance. There was one contact with a patrol and a brief exchange of fire, but no one was hurt.

At midnight the group reached the riverbank and moved to the crossing point indicated by the Bofors tracer fire. Once there they flashed a V for Victory signal with their torches, but there was an anxious wait of twenty minutes for the boats. In fact, on the south bank, Dobie, the engineers, and a patrol of E Company, 506 PIR observed the signal and immediately launched their boats, but the British were some upriver of the crossing point. Upon reaching the north bank E Company established a small perimeter while men headed east to locate the evaders. The men quickly moved downstream and in the next 90 minutes all of them were evacuated, with the exception of a Russian who was caught and arrested by the Germans. The Germans opened fire sporadically and some mortar rounds fell near the crossing, but the fire was inaccurate. Once on the other side, the escapees were led to a farmhouse for refreshments, before being driven to Nijmegen where Dobie had arranged a party and champagne. The men were later flown back to the UK, rejoining the men who had escaped in Operation Berlin.

==Pegasus II==

The success of the first evacuation prompted the Allies to organise Operation Pegasus II to evacuate additional soldiers trapped near Arnhem. Unfortunately the security of this operation was compromised early, when a reporter impersonated an intelligence officer and interviewed several escapees from the first operation. The subsequent news story alerted the Germans who strengthened their patrols along the river.

Major Hugh Maguire (of HQ, 1st Airborne Division) was put in charge of the second escape. The operation largely replicated the original, but was due to take place further east on the evening of 18 November. A party of between 130 and 160 men would attempt to cross the river on this occasion, although this number included a much higher proportion of civilians, aircrew, and other non-infantry who were unused to this sort of operation. Because of the distance from Ede to the crossing point and the need to skirt a German &#x27;no man&#x27;s zone&#x27;, the main party&#x27;s march to the river was approximately , compared to the of Pegasus I, and would take two days to make. The main party became fragmented on the second night and while attempting to make a short cut, one party under Major John Coke of the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers stumbled into a German patrol. Several men were killed in the resulting firefight – perhaps more than twenty – and the evaders were forced to scatter. No one was able to cross that night, although seven men crossed during the next two days. The Germans searched the area intensively with patrols and spotter planes, enabling them to capture more of the evaders, and most of the Resistance&#x27;s Dutch guides were killed or captured.

==Later escapes==
Colonel Graeme Warrack and Captain Alexander Lipmann Kessel had been on the abortive Pegasus II, but were able to escape capture. Like many of the remaining evaders, they continued to hide in German-occupied territory for some months. In February 1945, they joined Brigadier John Hackett, who by now had recovered from his injuries sustained at Arnhem. Kessel had saved Hackett&#x27;s life during the battle and even performed minor operations during their time in hiding. They eventually escaped across the Waal at Groot-Ammers, west of Arnhem, on a route later used by another 37 men, including Gilbert Kirschen.

==Notable escapees==

Although many men had failed to return after the Battle of Arnhem, many were able to escape in Operation Pegasus or with the aid of the Resistance over the winter. They included senior ranks:
* Brigadier Gerald Lathbury, CO 1st Parachute Brigade (Operation Pegasus).
* Brigadier John Hackett, CO 4th Parachute Brigade (February 1945).
* Colonel Graeme Warrack, Senior medical officer, 1 Airborne Division (February 1945).
* Lieutenant Colonel David Dobie, CO 1 Battalion, Parachute Regiment (in advance of Operation Pegasus).
* Lieutenant Colonel Martin Herford, 163 RAMC (October 1944).
* Major Allison Digby Tatham-Warter, OC A Company, 2 Battalion, Parachute Regiment (Operation Pegasus).
* Major Anthony Deane-Drummond, 2IC Divisional Signals (Operation Pegasus).
* Major Tony Hibbert, Brigade Major 1st Parachute Brigade (Operation Pegasus).
* Captain Alexander Lipmann Kessel, 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance (February 1945).

==In popular culture==
Operation Pegasus was depicted in the fifth episode of the 2001 HBO miniseries &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;.

<doc id="298286" wikidata="Q7774431" url="?curid=298286" title="The Whisperer (radio program)">
<text>The Whisperer was an American old-time radio program which broadcast 13 episodes on late Sunday afternoons [5:00 p.m. Eastern] as a summer replacement from July 8 to September 30, 1951 on NBC.

It was based on stories by Dr. Stetson Humphrey (in collaboration with his wife, Irene).

The tone of the show was often tongue-in-cheek, and satirized the radio crime dramas of the day.

==Plot==
Lawyer Philip Gault (Carleton G. Young), due to a college football injury, lost his voice and can only speak in an eerie whisper. Gault infiltrates &quot;the syndicate&quot; in his native Central City to bring down organized crime from within; to the underworld, he becomes known as the Whisperer. Later, his voice is restored through surgery, but he continues to lead a double life as the Whisperer, relaying instructions by telephone from the syndicate bosses in New York (who don&#x27;t know he&#x27;s a mole) to their lackeys in Central City, whom Gault is actually setting up.

In the prologue to the final episode from September 30, 1951 titled &quot;Strange Bed Fellows&quot;, Philip Gault explains his history as follows:
&quot;It all began ten years ago when I was kicked in the throat while playing college football. After the bandages were removed I opened my mouth to speak and all that came out was this rattling hiss. After a bakers dozen of women fainted when I spoke to them and countless babies went into paraclisms of crying, I disappeared from my usual haunts and went to work for a group which I later discovered were known as the crime syndicate. I decided to stay with them and collect sufficient evidence to help destroy them. Then one day I met Dr. Lee and through a miracle of surgery he restored my voice enabling me to resume my real identity as Philip Gault, Lawyer. This dual identity makes life very interesting. For if the syndicate ever finds out that the Whisperer, who passes on their orders, is really Philip Gault, the man who has wrecked so many of their plans, there&#x27;ll be slow walking and low moaning. But I won&#x27;t be around to comment on it.&quot;

Betty Moran portrayed Gault&#x27;s girlfriend, Ellen Norris, the only person who knows Gault&#x27;s double identity, other than Dr. Lee. Paul Frees occasionally appeared as Gault&#x27;s &quot;friend on the force&quot;, Lt. Charles Denvers. William Conrad frequently appeared in different supporting roles under his alias, &quot;Julius Krelboyne&quot;, as he was under exclusive contract to CBS radio at the time.

Bill Karn was the producer-director (and occasional writer), and organist Johnny Duffy supplied the background music.

The radio actor Carleton G. Young is sometimes confused with the film actor Carleton Scott Young.

<doc id="298291" wikidata="Q1154636" url="?curid=298291" title="DNA (American band)">
<text>DNA was an American no wave band formed in 1977 by guitarist Arto Lindsay and keyboardist Robin Crutchfield, and later joined by drummer Ikue Mori and bassist Tim Wright. They were associated with the late 1970s New York no wave scene, and were featured on the 1978 compilation &quot;No New York&quot;.

==History==
DNA originally consisted of Lindsay, Crutchfield, Gordon Stevenson and Mirielle Cervenka, and took their name from a song by another no wave band, Mars. Stevenson went on to play bass for Teenage Jesus and the Jerks; Cervenka was the younger sister of Exene Cervenka of X. Terry Ork, head of Ork Records, booked the band at Max&#x27;s Kansas City for its first show. Cervenka and Stevenson left after hearing this. Lindsay and Crutchfield hastily recruited Ikue Mori—who at the time had little command of English and no musical experience—to be DNA&#x27;s drummer.

This lineup of DNA played occasionally at Tier 3, CBGB and Max&#x27;s Kansas City and recorded one 7&quot; single. Within their first year, they had cemented their reputation as a paradigmatic no wave band when Brian Eno selected them as one of the four groups documented on the &quot;No New York&quot; LP, the first recording to expose no wave groups to an audience outside of Lower Manhattan. The other three bands appearing on this album were The Contortions, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, and Mars.

Shortly after the recording of &quot;No New York&quot;, Crutchfield left DNA to form a new band, Dark Day. He was replaced by Tim Wright, previously of the Cleveland band Pere Ubu. As Wright played bass guitar and not keyboards and was the only member of the band to have any conventional instrumental technique, the change in DNA&#x27;s sound was dramatic. The music became even more spare and angular, with Wright&#x27;s bass lines creating a sometimes menacing sound to support Lindsay&#x27;s scraping, atonal guitar and Mori&#x27;s irregular rhythms. Their song structures became tighter, briefer, more abstract, and have been compared to haiku.

The Lindsay-Mori-Wright lineup of DNA developed something of a cult following between 1979 and 1982, but perhaps more of their fans came from the art world than from rock audiences. Live shows were frequent in this period, but rarely outside of the CBGB/Mudd Club/Tier 3 circuit in lower Manhattan.

The group&#x27;s 10-minute debut album, &quot;A Taste of DNA&quot; was recorded for Kip Hanrahan&#x27;s &quot;American Clavé&quot; label, and was later released on Rough Trade in 1980. Some live DNA tracks appeared on compilation albums while the band was still in existence.

Lindsay, Mori, and Wright decided to dissolve the band in 1982. Its final concerts were three consecutive sold-out nights at CBGB. DNA&#x27;s final encore was a cover of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot;. This is not included on the CD &quot;Last Live at CBGB&quot;, released more than a decade later, on John Zorn&#x27;s Avant label.

Lindsay and Mori, and to a lesser extent Crutchfield, have remained active in music.

&quot;DNA on DNA&quot;, a comprehensive CD chronicle of the band, was released by No More Records in 2004.

==In popular culture==
The band is featured in the film &quot;Downtown 81&quot; starring Jean-Michel Basquiat.

The rock group Blonde Redhead takes its name from a DNA song.

<text>William Bowyer (; 19 December 169913 November 1777) was an English printer known as &quot;the learned printer&quot;.

==Life==
Born in London, Bowyer was educated at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and in 1722 became a partner in his father William Bowyer&#x27;s business. In 1729 he was appointed printer of the votes of the British House of Commons, and in 1736 printer to the Society of Antiquaries, of which he was elected a fellow in 1737. He was also appointed printer to the Society for the Encouragement of Learning. On the death of his father in 1737 he became the sole owner of the Bowyer press.

In 1759 he took as apprentice John Nichols, who was to be his successor and biographer. Bowyer was also a close collaborator with the prominent London bookseller Andrew Millar.

In 1761 Bowyer became printer to the Royal Society, and in 1767 printer of the rolls of the House of Lords and the journals of the House of Commons. Also in 1767 he moved from Whitefriars to a larger house in Red Lion Passage, Fleet Street. He died leaving unfinished a number of large works and among them the reprint of Domesday Book. He was known as &quot;the learned printer.&quot;
Bowyer was buried in Leyton parish church, where he has a monument.

==Works==
Bowyer&#x27;s major work was an edition of the New Testament in Greek, with notes. Prior to the publication of his critical edition of the New Testament, Bowyer published several editions of the Textus Receptus. He wrote tracts and pamphlets, and edited, arranged and published a host of books. He also edited the Greek-Latin Lexicon of Schrevelius.

==Legacy==
Bowyer&#x27;s generous bequests in favour of indigent printers were administered by the Stationers&#x27; Company, of which he became a liveryman in 1738. In their hall was his portrait bust and a painting of his father.

<text>William Bowyer the elder (166327 December 1737), English printer, was apprenticed to a Miles Flesher in 1679, made a liveryman of The Stationers&#x27; and Newspaper Makers&#x27; Company in 1700, and nominated as one of the twenty printers allowed by the Star Chamber.

Bowyer originally settled in White Friars, where he remained until January 1712/3, when his printing-house and warehouse were destroyed by fire. Bowyer began printing again on his own in October 1713 in Temple Lane. By 1716, thanks to the grant of a royal warrant for a charitable collection, and the generous support of the London trade, Bowyer was well on his way to economic recovery. William Bowyer, the son, born in 1699, entered the business as a corrector in June 1722. Father and son worked side by side until the former&#x27;s death in December 1737 and their publishing house was considered the most learned of its time. Although they published such important, learned works as Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, they also published political pamphlets and advertising bills.

The four Bowyer ledgers, kept by father and son, are one of but four printing houses out of the seventy-four master printers in London in 1724, for which records are extant and offer the earliest example by over 20 years.

A main source for the lives of both father and son is John Nichols&#x27; &quot;Literary anecdotes of the eighteenth century&quot;.

<doc id="298304" wikidata="Q1361543" url="?curid=298304" title="Sunny Day Real Estate">
<text>Sunny Day Real Estate is an American emo band from Seattle, Washington, formed in 1992. The band currently consists of founding members Jeremy Enigk (vocals, guitar), Dan Hoerner (guitar) and William Goldsmith (drums), alongside Greg Suran (guitar), who originally played with the band between 2000 and 2001, and Chris Jordan (bass), who joined the band in 2022. Founding bass guitarist Nate Mendel was a member of the band during three of its four incarnations.

Sunny Day Real Estate were one of the early rock bands in the Midwest emo scene which they helped establish, despite not being from the Midwest themselves. In 1994, the band released their debut album &quot;Diary&quot; on Sub Pop Records to critical acclaim. However, shortly after recording their second album &quot;LP2&quot;, the band broke up. Rhythm section Mendel and Goldsmith joined Foo Fighters, while lead vocalist and guitarist Enigk embarked on a solo career. 

In 1997, they regrouped long enough to record two more studio albums and a live album, but ultimately disbanded once again in 2001. The band reunited again in 2009. Bassist Nate Mendel, who chose to remain with Foo Fighters during the previous reunion in 1997, took part in this reunion. In a 2013 interview with MusicRadar, Mendel said Sunny Day Real Estate was inactive. According to Mendel, the band attempted to record a full-length album after the end of their reunion tour, but the sessions &quot;just fell apart&quot;. In 2014 the band released one song from those sessions, &quot;Lipton Witch,&quot; on a split 7-inch vinyl with Circa Survive on Record Store Day.

In January 2022, the band announced its third reunion, with Chris Jordan replacing Mendel on bass guitar. The band embarked on a tour with the Appleseed Cast in September 2022.

==History==

===Early years===
In 1992, guitarist Dan Hoerner and bassist Nate Mendel met when they became housemates at the University of Washington. After jam sessions, they decided to form a band and sought a drummer, eventually deciding to invite William Goldsmith. Goldsmith played in many bands but decided to join the duo&#x27;s project. They released a demo tape under the name &quot;Empty Set&quot;. Post-release, the band changed their name from Empty Set to Chewbacca Kaboom, upon realization that a band with the name Empty Set already existed. However, when another demo tape was released, the new name earned them little attention, and it was yet again subject to change, this time to One Day I Stopped Breathing. The band eventually settled on the name Sunny Day Real Estate. Mendel stated the band&#x27;s name &quot;was just a random thought that popped into my head that came from a Talking Heads song, &#x27;(Nothing But) Flowers&#x27;&quot;. He felt that since the band&#x27;s outlook on the world saw that every possible thing was becoming a commodity to be bought and sold, it was possible that one day, people would even start selling sunny days. The lyrics made him ponder what could be sold as property, and come up with the commercialization of sunny days.

The newly baptized band started as an instrumental outfit, but decided to add a singer. After testing with a female vocalist, Hoerner decided to start singing. The band recorded a self-released two-song 7-inch single called &quot;Flatland Spider&quot;. Afterwards Mendel took a break to tour with local band Christ on a Crutch. Goldsmith called his high school friend Jeremy Enigk to play along with them in a new project, Thief, Steal Me a Peach, in which Hoerner played bass and Enigk played guitar. After Mendel returned from tour, Hoerner convinced him to let Enigk join Sunny Day Real Estate on vocals and guitar.

Early on, the band&#x27;s influences included Dischord Records bands like Rites of Spring and Shudder to Think. Where Hoerner&#x27;s vocal style had been in the rougher, hardcore vein, Enigk&#x27;s vocals were higher-pitched, inspired by Shudder to Think singer Craig Wedren. The musicians also decided to add slower tempos and more groove to their songs. The band&#x27;s new style went on to shape what music fans and journalists alike consider the &quot;indie-emo sound.&quot; Emotional hardcore being a style initiated in the late 1980s saw a divergence in sound with bands like Sunny Day Real Estate who strayed away from the hardcore tendencies of original emotional hardcore or emo while keeping some of the intensity and stylistic motifs.

===&quot;Diary&quot;, self-titled and break-up===
The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Diary&quot;, released by indie label Sub Pop in 1994, was greeted with numerous positive reviews. That September, the band performed lead single &quot;Seven&quot; on an episode of &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot;. A few days later, they taped several songs for MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot;. Through November and December, the band undertook a US tour with Shudder to Think and Soul Coughing in support of the album.

The band projected an enigmatic presence to the public. While supporting &quot;Diary&quot;, the band allowed only one publicity photo and granted just a single interview (though, strangely, the band posed for an advertisement for department-store chain Nordstrom). In a 1998 interview with Norm Arenas of Texas Is the Reason, Hoerner explained that the band made up a fake band name and brought in a fake lead singer for the ad shoot, only to have the store stick their real band name on the ad. For most of its early days, the band also refused to play a show in California, for reasons that were never fully explained. When the band was asked to perform at the 1994 Almost Acoustic Christmas in Los Angeles for radio station KROQ, Hoerner refused to join them, leaving Enigk, Mendel, and Goldsmith to perform the show as a trio.

After finishing their 1994 US tour, the band regrouped to begin recording the follow-up to &quot;Diary&quot;. While the events surrounding the sessions have not been publicly discussed, the band was clearly enduring internal conflict. Rumors abounded that the root cause was Enigk&#x27;s sudden conversion to Christianity. In early 1995, the band announced that it was disbanding. William Goldsmith would later reveal in June 2020 on the &quot;This Was The Scene&quot; podcast that the band had already decided to split up before their first US tour in 1994 and the recording of the Pink Album.

There was much talk but little really known about the reasons for the break-up. While many fans focused on Enigk being a reborn Christian, Enigk and other band members later downplayed that aspect. In a letter addressed &quot;To Seth and other readers&quot;, Enigk responded to rumors regarding his faith. Dismissing the connection between his conversion and their break-up, Enigk wrote, &quot;I took a shot on calling upon God. He answered me. My pain was gone. I was full of joy. I had hope again. I must say that the true God is the one who is in the Bible, Jesus Christ,&quot; and, &quot;I would be a fool to say that He hasn&#x27;t worked miracles in my life.&quot; Goldsmith would later reveal the break up was mainly due to their lack of success and Enigk&#x27;s desire to leave the band.

In November 1995, Sub Pop released the band&#x27;s second album, bearing only the label &quot;Sunny Day Real Estate&quot;. The album was released without cover art or liner notes, and was distributed by Sub Pop as &quot;LP2&quot;. It has also occasionally been referred to as &quot;The Pink Album&quot;, a reference to its solid pink cover. When Sub Pop contacted the band for artwork for the release, the band had nothing to offer, so Goldsmith suggested that they &quot;make it pink&quot;. The album included the songs recorded during the brief sessions, as well as tracks such as &quot;Rodeo Jones&quot; that were recorded during the sessions for &quot;Diary&quot;.

Enigk confessed in an interview in December 2008 that because the band had already broken up during the recording of &quot;LP2&quot;, he and Hoerner never sat down to complete the lyrics; &quot;We broke up and we just felt like we were done. We put no energy into the artwork or into anything. On a lot of songs, there aren&#x27;t lyrics! In a lot of cases, we never sat down to write them, because we just wanted to get it out of the way as fast as possible. So I just sang a lot of gibberish, which makes it really quirky. My favorite is the Japanese translations&quot;.

After the breakup, Enigk pursued a solo career, releasing his first solo album, &quot;Return of the Frog Queen&quot;, in 1996. Hoerner moved out to a farm in rural Washington, while Mendel and Goldsmith joined Foo Fighters, the band which Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl had formed following the death of Kurt Cobain. In 1997, following a dispute with Grohl during the sessions for the second Foo Fighters record, Goldsmith departed the band, but Mendel remained.

===Reformation, &quot;How It Feels to Be Something On&quot;, &quot;The Rising Tide&quot; and second break-up===
In 1997, Sub Pop began pressing Enigk and Hoerner about the possibility of releasing a rarities record of Sunny Day Real Estate material, including the band&#x27;s early 7-inch releases and otherwise unreleased songs, such as the band&#x27;s unused contribution to &quot;The Crow: City of Angels&quot; soundtrack. Given that the album with only this material would have been rather short, the band decided to regroup to record a few new songs. While working on the songs, the quartet realized that whatever had driven them apart was behind them, and decided to continue working on new material, eventually signaling to Sub Pop that they wanted to release a full new album. Initially, Mendel intended to quit the Foo Fighters to rejoin Sunny Day full-time, but hedged for several months on actually quitting. Just before starting the recording sessions for the album, Mendel turned down the opportunity, noting that he did not want to leave what he had with the Foo Fighters for a potentially tenuous reunion.

In September 1998, the band released &quot;How It Feels to Be Something On&quot;. For the album, the remaining trio replaced Mendel with Jeff Palmer, formerly of the Mommyheads. Palmer left the band after a short time, and he was replaced by Joe Skyward. The title track and &quot;Every Shining Time You Arrive&quot; were intended for Enigk&#x27;s second solo album, but later became Sunny Day Real Estate songs. On the album, Hoerner took the opportunity to write about his environmental concerns in &quot;100 Million&quot;.

While supporting the album, Sub Pop approached them about the possibility of filming the band for a live release. Two shows were documented, one on video and one on audio, in the form of &quot;Live&quot;. In the weeks after their release, the band noted their displeasure with the video and CD, complaining that Sub Pop did not allow them final approval on the artwork or on the final mixes. Having fulfilled their contractual obligations, the band left the label.

The band&#x27;s manager Greg Williamson departed, and the band signed with Time Bomb Recordings, an independent label distributed by BMG. The band joined with long-time Hüsker Dü sound engineer Lou Giordano to record &quot;The Rising Tide&quot;, released in June 2000. The band had high expectations for the release, and subsequently undertook a lengthy US tour. Afterward, the band announced their breakup.

===Post-second split activity, second and third reunions===
After their second disbanding, Hoerner again retreated to his farm in Washington, eventually working with Chris Carrabba on tracks for Dashboard Confessional.

In 2001, Enigk and Goldsmith reunited with Mendel to form a new band, called The Fire Theft, releasing their first self-titled album in 2003. While they had the option of retaining the Sunny Day Real Estate name, the trio decided that it was time to leave the past behind them and start fresh. Mendel remained with the Foo Fighters, joining the Fire Theft when his schedule allowed it.

In 2006, Enigk reignited his solo career by recording and releasing the LP &quot;World Waits&quot; on his own label, Lewis Hollow Records. Following the October 17 release, Enigk embarked upon a supporting solo tour of the U.S. using material from his 2006 release, as well as his decade-prior solo album, &quot;Return of the Frog Queen&quot;.

After some speculation in 2006 and 2008, in April 2009, several web sites reported that the band had reunited with all original members. The reunion was confirmed in June 2009, by Seattle radio DJ Andrew Harms from 107.7 The End. The band toured the United States and Canada in September and October 2009, and Australia in February 2010 as part of the Soundwave Festival. The band&#x27;s first show was a surprise secret show on September 16, 2009, at Hell&#x27;s Kitchen in Tacoma, Washington. To coincide with the new tour, the band&#x27;s first two albums were remastered and reissued with bonus tracks and newly written liner notes.

For their 2009 reunion tour, the band frequently played a newly written song called &quot;10&quot;.

On September 29, 2009, the band performed the song &quot;Seven&quot; on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;. The band also performed at the 2010 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, and went on to play their first ever European gig on May 29 at Barcelona&#x27;s Primavera Sound. After that, they played at the HMV Forum in London for their debut UK gig on May 31. They were also scheduled to play at the punk festival Groezrock in Belgium as part of a European tour, but had to cancel their date due to the volcanic ash situation.

In 2009, the band had been making statements from the stage implying that new recorded material was on the way. In early 2010, Dan Hoerner confirmed in an interview with Australian music website FasterLouder that the band were writing a new album, and were expecting to start recording in May 2010. Mendel ultimately returned to recording and touring with Foo Fighters.

In a 2013 interview with MusicRadar, Mendel stated that Sunny Day Real Estate was inactive. According to Mendel, the band attempted to record a new full length after the end of their reunion tour, but the sessions &quot;just fell apart.&quot;

In 2014, the band released a split 7-inch vinyl with Circa Survive on Record Store Day. The band&#x27;s only song from the 7-inch, &quot;Lipton Witch,&quot; was their first new material released in 14 years.

In December 2018, William Goldsmith claimed on his Facebook page that the unfinished fifth Sunny Day Real Estate album remained &quot;silenced, abandoned and buried within the murkiest depths of David Grohl&#x27;s sock drawer.&quot; He would later clarify that he was referring to the Grohl-owned Studio 606 where the album sessions took place and were abandoned due to Jeremy Enigk not receiving &quot;the moral support as well as engineering that he deserved.&quot; Goldsmith also claimed that Grohl disapproved of Nate Mendel&#x27;s involvement in the Fire Theft, and thus would not be supportive of Mendel completing the new Sunny Day Real Estate LP. Via Foo Fighters&#x27; representatives, Mendel denied Goldsmith&#x27;s initial allegations, to which Goldsmith replied that he had not spoken with Mendel since 2011 after a planned conference call to discuss finishing the album did not happen.

In January 2022, a new Instagram page for Sunny Day Real Estate was set up by Goldsmith, leading to speculation that a fourth reunion of the band was imminent. This was confirmed by &quot;Spin&quot; on January 24, 2022 – with Enigk, Hoerner and Goldsmith confirmed to be involved. A North American tour with the Appleseed Cast was announced in May 2022. On September 10, Sunny Day Real Estate played their first show of this reunion at The Big Dipper (a venue co-owned by Hoerner) in Spokane. 

On January 17, 2024, an Instagram Reel was posted to the group&#x27;s page teasing new music featuring a drawing of a tugboat while a snippet of an unreleased song played in the background. The song “Novum Vetus” was released on January 27; it was revealed that the song originated during the recording sessions for &quot;How It Feels to Be Something On.&quot; The song was recorded by the three original members of the band, plus their new members, bassist Chris Jordan and guitarist Greg Suran.

==Musical style and legacy==
Sunny Day Real Estate has primarily been classified as emo, and according to Brian Raftery of AllMusic, the band present &quot;more than a hint of grunge&quot;.

<text>Guy Picciotto ( ; born September 17, 1965) is an American songwriter, musician, and record producer from Washington, D.C. He is best known as the guitarist and co-lead vocalist in Fugazi and as lead vocalist of Rites of Spring.

==Career==

===Rites of Spring and early projects===

Picciotto&#x27;s career as a guitarist and vocalist began in 1984, with the group Rites of Spring. A part of the D.C. post-hardcore scene, Rites of Spring increased the frenetic violence and visceral passion of hardcore while simultaneously experimenting with its compositional rules. Picciotto, as the band&#x27;s lyricist, as well as singer and guitarist, shifted hardcore into intensely personal realms and, in doing so, is generally credited with creating emo.

Picciotto&#x27;s early musical resume includes the bands Insurrection (1982) where he only played guitar, One Last Wish (1986), Happy Go Licky (1987–1988), Brief Weeds (EPs released circa 1991–1992), and The Black Light Panthers (ongoing sporadic project since 1982), the last two bands both being projects with Brendan Canty. He created a record label called Peterbilt Records, which released limited-quantity vinyl record albums for the bands Rain, Happy Go Licky, and Deadline, then years later was involved in releasing the album &quot;1986&quot; by One Last Wish, along with Dischord Records.

===Fugazi===

Though not in the original lineup of Fugazi, Picciotto joined very early in the group&#x27;s career, singing with them by their second show and appearing on all the band&#x27;s studio recordings.

From the &quot;Repeater&quot; album on, he took up second guitar duties, playing characteristically trebly Rickenbacker guitars. After seven albums and several tours, Fugazi went on &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot; in 2003.

===Side projects and production work===
Picciotto has collaborated and performed with Mats Gustafsson, Vic Chesnutt, and members of the Ex among others. He has produced numerous albums including the Gossip&#x27;s breakthrough record &quot;Standing in the Way of Control&quot; as well as Blonde Redhead&#x27;s &quot;Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons&quot; (2000) and &quot;Misery Is a Butterfly&quot; (2004), The Blood Brothers final album, &quot;Young Machetes,&quot; and Downtown Boys&#x27; &quot;Cost of Living&quot; (2017) as well as two records for The Casual Dots, their self-titled debut album and the follow-up &quot;Sanguine Truth&quot; (2022). Additionally, Picciotto has produced five albums by the duo Xylouris White: &quot;Goats&quot; (2014), &quot;Black Peak&quot; (2016), &quot;Mother&quot; (2018), &quot;The Sisypheans&quot; (2019) and &quot;The Forest In Me&quot; (2023). Picciotto also co-produced the drummer Jim White&#x27;s first solo album &quot;All Hits : Memories&quot; (2024).

Picciotto played on the Vic Chesnutt albums &quot;North Star Deserter&quot; (2007) and &quot;At the Cut&quot; (2009), and accompanied him on tours of Europe and North America. He co-produced the films &quot;Chain&quot; and &quot;Museum Hours&quot; with Jem Cohen (who made the Fugazi film &quot;Instrument&quot;).

In 2012, Picciotto was interviewed on stage at the Pop Montreal festival by Howard Bilerman about his experiences in the music industry. On January 24, 2020, Guy appeared on an episode of Live From the Barrage for a wide-ranging discussion that was his first long form interview in quite some time.

==Personal life==
Picciotto was born to an American mother and an Italian father. He holds a BA degree in English from Georgetown University and is a graduate of the Washington, D.C. private school, the Georgetown Day School.

Picciotto married musician Kathi Wilcox from the bands Bikini Kill and the Frumpies; in 2013 the two were reported living in Brooklyn with their child.

==Equipment==
=== Guitars ===
* Rickenbacker 330 – Picciotto&#x27;s main guitars are a sunburst Rickenbacker 330 and 2 identical black Rickenbacker 330&#x27;s all equipped with RIC HB1 humbuckers. He has occasionally been seen playing a natural-finish 330. The characteristically trebly Rickenbackers allowed Picciotto to make use of sonic space not taken by MacKaye&#x27;s chunkier, rhythmic guitar playing in Fugazi.
* Rickenbacker 370 – Picciotto&#x27;s main guitar when he fronted Rites of Spring, One Last Wish and in the first few years with Fugazi was a Mapleglo Rickenbacker 370. It eventually ended up in a state too fragile for live use, but he still used it in the studio right up to The Argument.
*Gibson Les Paul Jr. – During Picciotto&#x27;s time with Rites of Spring and during the early days of Fugazi (photos show until at least as late as 1993), he could also be seen playing a white Gibson Les Paul Doublecut Jr. with a single P90 pickup. In an interview done in 2011, Picciotto is quoted as having had a Gibson SG Jr. stolen in New York City. The NPR article may be incorrect about it being an SG and it was likely the same Les Paul Jr. guitar.

=== Amplification ===
*Park 100 Watt heads
*Marshall JCM 800 2203 heads
*Red or Black Marshall JCM 800 4x12 cabinets fitted with 75-watt celestion speakers
* Fender Twin reverb (studio)

<doc id="298309" wikidata="Q380961" url="?curid=298309" title="John Foxe">
<text>John Foxe (1516/1517 – 18 April 1587) was an English clergyman, theologian, and historian, notable for his martyrology &quot;Actes and Monuments&quot; (otherwise known as &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs&quot;), telling of Christian martyrs throughout Western history, but particularly the sufferings of English Protestants and proto-Protestants from the 14th century and in the reign of Mary I. The book was widely owned and read by English Puritans and helped to mould British opinion on the Catholic Church for several centuries.

==Education==
Foxe was born in Boston, in Lincolnshire, England, of a middlingly prominent family and seems to have been an unusually studious and devout child. In about 1534, when he was about 16, he entered Brasenose College, Oxford, where he was the pupil of John Hawarden (or Harding), a fellow of the college. In 1535 Foxe was admitted to Magdalen College School, where he may either have been improving his Latin or acting as a junior instructor. He became a probationer fellow in July 1538 and a full fellow the following July.

Foxe took his bachelor&#x27;s degree on 17 July 1537, his master&#x27;s degree in July 1543, and was lecturer in logic in 1539–1540. A series of letters in Foxe&#x27;s handwriting dated to 1544–45, shows Foxe to be &quot;a man of friendly disposition and warm sympathies, deeply religious, an ardent student, zealous in making acquaintance with scholars.&quot; By the time he was twenty-five, he had read the Latin and Greek fathers, the schoolmen, the canon law, and had &quot;acquired no mean skill in the Hebrew language.&quot;

==Resignation from Oxford==
Foxe resigned from his college in 1545 after becoming a Protestant and thereby subscribing to beliefs condemned by the Church of England under Henry VIII. After a year of &quot;obligatory regency&quot; (public lecturing), Foxe would have been obliged to take holy orders by Michaelmas 1545, and the primary reason for his resignation was probably his opposition to clerical celibacy, which he described in letters to friends as self-castration. Foxe may have been forced from the college in a general purge of its Protestant members although college records state that he resigned of his own accord and &quot;ex honesta causa&quot;. Foxe&#x27;s change of religious opinion may have temporarily broken his relationship with his stepfather and even have put his life in danger. Foxe personally witnessed the burning of William Cowbridge in September 1538.

After being forced to abandon what might have been a promising academic career, Foxe experienced a period of dire need. Hugh Latimer invited Foxe to live with him, but Foxe eventually became a tutor in the household of Thomas Lucy of Charlecote, near Stratford-on-Avon. Before leaving the Lucys, Foxe married Agnes Randall on 3 February 1547. They had six children.

==London under Edward VI==
Foxe&#x27;s prospects, and those of the Protestant cause generally, improved after the accession of Edward VI in January 1547 and the formation of a Privy Council dominated by pro-reform Protestants. In the middle of, or at the end of 1547 Foxe moved to London and probably lived in Stepney. There he completed three translations of Protestant sermons published by the &quot;stout Protestant&quot; Hugh Singleton. During this period Foxe also found a patron in Mary Fitzroy, Duchess of Richmond, who employed him as tutor to the children of her brother, Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, a Roman Catholic who had been executed for treason in January 1547. The children were Thomas, who would become the fourth duke of Norfolk and a valuable friend of Foxe; Jane, later Countess of Westmorland, and Henry, later earl of Northampton. The duchess was the widow of Henry VIII&#x27;s illegitimate son Henry FitzRoy and in that sense was the sister-in-law of the new king. Foxe lived in the duchess&#x27;s London household at Mountjoy House and later at Reigate Castle, and her patronage &quot;facilitated Foxe&#x27;s entry into the ranks of England&#x27;s Protestant elite.&quot; During his stay at Reigate, Foxe helped suppress a cult that had arisen around the shrine of the Virgin Mary at Ouldsworth, which had been credited with miraculous healing powers.

Foxe was ordained deacon by Nicholas Ridley on 24 June 1550. His circle of friends, associates, and supporters came to include John Hooper, William Turner, John Rogers, William Cecil, and most importantly John Bale, who was to become a close friend and &quot;certainly encouraged, very probably guided, Foxe in the composition of his first martyrology.&quot; From 1548 to 1551, Foxe brought out one tract opposing the death penalty for adultery and another supporting ecclesiastical excommunication of those who he thought &quot;veiled ambition under the cloak of Protestantism.&quot; He also worked unsuccessfully to prevent two burnings for religion that occurred during the reign of Edward VI.

==Marian exile==
On the accession of Mary I in July 1553, Foxe lost his tutorship when the children&#x27;s grandfather, the Duke of Norfolk was released from prison. Foxe walked warily as befitted one who had published Protestant books in his own name. As the political climate worsened, Foxe believed himself personally threatened by Bishop Stephen Gardiner. Just ahead of officers sent to arrest him, he sailed with his pregnant wife from Ipswich to Nieuwpoort. He then travelled to Antwerp, Rotterdam, Frankfurt and Strasbourg, which he reached by July 1554. In Strasbourg, Foxe published a Latin history of the Christian persecutions, the draft of which he had brought from England and according to &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot;, &quot;formed the first outline of the Actes and Monuments.&quot; The final publication would then help shape the depiction and legend of Mary I as &quot;Bloody Mary&quot;.

In the autumn of 1554, Foxe moved to Frankfurt, where he served as a preacher for the English church ministering to refugees in the city. There he was unwillingly drawn into a bitter theological controversy. One faction favoured the church polity and liturgy of the Book of Common Prayer, while the other advocated the Reformed models promoted by John Calvin&#x27;s Genevan church. The latter group, led by John Knox, was supported by Foxe; the former was led by Richard Cox. Eventually Knox, who seems to have acted with more magnanimity, was expelled, and in the autumn of 1555, Foxe and about twenty others also left Frankfurt. Although Foxe clearly favoured Knox, he was irenic by temperament and expressed his disgust at &quot;the violence of the warring factions&quot;.

Moving to Basel, Foxe worked with his fellow countrymen John Bale and Lawrence Humphrey at the drudgery of proofreading. (Educated Englishmen were noted for their learning, industry and honesty and &quot;would also be the last persons to quarrel with their bread and butter.&quot; No knowledge of German or French was required because the English tended to socialise with one another and could communicate with scholars in Latin.) Foxe also completed and had printed a religious drama, &quot;Christus Triumphans&quot; (1556), in Latin verse. Yet despite receiving occasional financial contributions from English merchants on the continent, Foxe seems to have lived very close to the margin and been &quot;wretchedly poor.&quot;

When Foxe received reports from England about the ongoing religious persecution there, he wrote a pamphlet urging the English nobility to use their influence with the queen to halt it. Foxe feared that the appeal would be useless, and his fears proved correct. When Knox attacked Mary Stuart in his now famous &quot;The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women&quot;, Foxe apparently criticized Knox&#x27;s &quot;rude vehemency&quot; although their friendship seems to have remained unimpaired.

==Return to England==

After the death of Mary I in 1558, Foxe was in no hurry to return home, and he waited to see if religious changes instituted by her successor, Elizabeth I, would take root. Foxe was also so poor that he was unable to travel with his family until money was sent to him. Back in England, he seems to have lived for ten years at Aldgate, London, in the house of his former pupil, Thomas Howard, now Fourth Duke of Norfolk. Foxe quickly became associated with John Day the printer and published works of religious controversy while working on a new martyrology that would eventually become the &quot;Actes and Monuments&quot;.

Foxe was ordained a priest by his friend Edmund Grindal, now Bishop of London, but he &quot;was something of a puritan, and like many of the exiles, had scruples about wearing the clerical vestments laid down in the queen&#x27;s injunctions of 1559.&quot; Many of his friends eventually conformed, but Foxe was &quot;more stubborn or single-minded.&quot; Some tried to find him preferments in the new regime, but it &quot;was not easy to help a man of so singularly unworldly a nature, who scorned to use his powerful friendships to advance himself.&quot;

==&quot;Actes and Monuments&quot;==

===Latin editions===
Foxe began his Book of Martyrs in 1552, during the reign of Edward VI, with the Marian Persecutions still in the future. In 1554, while still in exile, Foxe published in Latin at Strasbourg the first shadow of his great book, emphasising the persecution of the English Lollards during the 15th century.

As word of the contemporary English persecution made its way to the continent, Foxe began to collect materials to continue his story to the present. He published the first true Latin edition of his famous book at Basel in August 1559. Of course, it was difficult to write contemporary English history while living (as he later said) &quot;in the far parts of Germany, where few friends, no conference, [and] small information could be had.&quot; But Foxe, who had left England poor and unknown, returned only poor. He had gained &quot;a substantial reputation&quot; through his Latin work.

===First edition===
On 20 March 1563, Foxe published the first English edition of the &#x27;Actes and Monuments&quot; from the press of John Day. It was a &quot;gigantic folio volume&quot; of about 1800 pages, about three times the length of the 1559 Latin book. As is typical for the period, the full title was a paragraph long and is abbreviated by scholars as &quot;Acts and Monuments&quot;, although the book was popularly known then, as it is now, as &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs&quot;. Publication of the book made Foxe instantly famous – &quot;England&#x27;s first literary celebrity&quot; – although because there were then no royalties, Foxe remained as poor as ever although the book sold for more than ten shillings, three weeks&#x27; pay for a skilled craftsman. This publication would then go on to become the second most popular book written in English, after the Bible.

===Second edition===
&quot;Actes and Monuments&quot; was immediately attacked by Catholics such as Thomas Harding, Thomas Stapleton, and Nicholas Harpsfield. In the next generation, Robert Parsons, an English Jesuit, also struck at Foxe in &quot;A Treatise of Three Conversions of England&quot; (1603–04). Harding, in the spirit of the age, called &quot;Actes and Monuments&quot; &#x27;&quot;that huge dunghill of your stinking martyrs,&quot; full of a thousand lies&#x27;.

Intending to strengthen his book against his critics, and being flooded by new material brought to light by the publication of the first edition, Foxe put together a second edition in 1570 and where the charges of his critics had been reasonably accurate, Foxe removed the offending passages. Where he could rebut the charges, &quot;he mounted a vigorous counter-attack, seeking to crush his opponent under piles of documents.&quot; Even though he deleted material that had been included in the first edition, the second edition was nearly double the size of the first, &quot;two gigantic folio volumes, with 2300 very large pages&quot; of double-columned text.

The edition was well received by the English church, and the upper house of the convocation of Canterbury meeting in 1571, ordered that a copy of the Bishop&#x27;s Bible and &quot;that full history entitled Monuments of Martyrs&quot; be installed in every cathedral church and that church officials place copies in their houses for the use of servants and visitors. The decision was of certain benefit to Foxe&#x27;s printer Day because he had taken great financial risks printing such a mammoth work.

===Third and fourth editions===

Foxe published a third edition in 1576, but it was virtually a reprint of the second, although printed on inferior paper and in smaller type. The fourth edition, published in 1583, the last in Foxe&#x27;s lifetime, had larger type and better paper and consisted of &quot;two volumes of about two thousand folio pages in double columns.&quot; Nearly four times the length of the Bible, the fourth edition was &quot;the most physically imposing, complicated, and technically demanding English book of its era. It seems safe to say that it is the largest and most complicated book to appear during the first two or three centuries of English printing history.&quot; The title page included the poignant request that the author &quot;desireth thee, good reader, to help him with thy prayer.&quot;

===Accuracy===
Foxe based his accounts of martyrs before the early modern period on previous writers, including Eusebius, Bede, Matthew Paris, and many others. Foxe&#x27;s own contribution was his compilation of the English martyrs from the period of the Lollards through the persecution of Mary I. Here Foxe had primary sources of all kinds to draw on: episcopal registers, reports of trials, and the testimony of eyewitnesses, a remarkable range of sources for English historical writing of the period. All this contributed to reinforcing the &quot;English association of Catholicism with bigotry and cruelty&quot;.

Foxe&#x27;s material is more accurate when he deals with his own period, although it is selectively presented, and the book is not an impartial account. Sometimes Foxe copied documents verbatim; sometimes he adapted them to his own use. Foxe&#x27;s method of using his sources &quot;proclaims the honest man, the sincere seeker after truth.&quot;

Foxe often treated his material casually, and any reader &quot;must be prepared to meet plenty of small errors and inconsistencies.&quot; Furthermore, Foxe did not hold to later notions of neutrality or objectivity. He made unambiguous side glosses on his text, such as &quot;Mark the apish pageants of these popelings&quot; and &quot;This answer smelleth of forging and crafty packing&quot;, as Foxe&#x27;s age was one of strong language as well as of cruel deeds. The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica went so far as to accuse Foxe of &quot;wilful falsification of evidence.&quot; Nevertheless, Foxe is &quot;factually detailed and preserves much firsthand material on the English Reformation unobtainable elsewhere.&quot; According to J. F. Mozley, Foxe presented &quot;lifelike and vivid pictures of the manners and feelings of the day, full of details that could never have been invented by a forger.&quot;

In some cases, Foxe&#x27;s reports were denied with incredulity by Catholic commentators: for example, Foxe claimed that seven people were burnt for teaching their children the &quot;Pater Noster&quot;, Creed and Ten Commandments in English. Contemporary Jesuit Robert Parsons wrote &quot;Who will believe this monstrous tale [... this] fiction that we (Catholics) hold reading of scriptures in English [...] as heresy?&quot;

==Life under Elizabeth I==
===Salisbury and London===
Foxe had dedicated &quot;Acts and Monuments&quot; to the queen, and on 22 May 1563, he was appointed prebend of Shipton in Salisbury Cathedral, in recognition of his championship of the English church. Foxe never visited the cathedral or performed any duties associated with the position except to appoint a vicar, William Masters, a highly educated fellow Protestant and former Marian exile. Foxe&#x27;s inaction as a canon of the cathedral led him to him being declared contumacious, and he was charged with failing to give a tithe for repairs to the cathedral. Perhaps his poverty made him unwilling to spare the time or money to make visits or contributions. In any case, he retained the position until his death.

By 1565, Foxe had been caught up in the vestments controversy led at that time by his associate Crowley. Foxe&#x27;s name was on a list of &quot;godly preachers which have utterly forsaken Antichrist and all his Romish rags&quot; that was presented to Lord Robert Dudley some time between 1561 and 1564. He was also one of the twenty clergymen who on 20 March 1565 petitioned to be allowed to choose not to wear vestments; but unlike many of the others, Foxe did not have a London benefice to lose when Archbishop Parker enforced conformity. Rather, when Crowley lost his position at St Giles-without-Cripplegate, Foxe may have preached in his stead.

At some point before 1569, Foxe left Norfolk&#x27;s house and moved to his own on Grub Street. Perhaps his move was motivated by his concerns about Norfolk&#x27;s exceptionally poor judgment in attempting to marry Mary Stuart, which led to his imprisonment in the Tower in 1569 and his condemnation in 1572 following the Ridolfi Plot. Although Foxe had written Norfolk &quot;a remarkably frank letter&quot; about the injudiciousness of his course, after Norfolk&#x27;s condemnation, he and Alexander Nowell ministered to the prisoner until his execution, which Foxe attended, on 2 June 1572.

In 1570, at the request of Edmund Grindal, Bishop of London, Foxe preached the Good Friday sermon at Paul&#x27;s Cross. This lofty exposition of the Protestant doctrine of redemption and attack on the doctrinal errors of the Roman Catholic Church was enlarged and published that year as &quot;A Sermon of Christ Crucified&quot;. Another sermon Foxe preached seven years later at Paul&#x27;s Cross resulted in his denunciation to the Queen by the French ambassador on grounds that Foxe had advocated the right of the Huguenots to take arms against their king. Foxe replied that he had been misunderstood: he had argued only that if the French king permitted no foreign power (the Pope) to rule over him, the French Protestants would immediately lay down their arms.

In 1571, Foxe edited an edition of the Anglo-Saxon gospels, in parallel with the Bishops&#x27; Bible translation, under the patronage of Archbishop Parker, who was interested in Anglo-Saxon and whose chaplain, John Jocelyn was an Anglo-Saxon scholar. Foxe&#x27;s introduction argues that the vernacular scripture was an ancient custom in England.

===Death and legacy===
Foxe died on 18 April 1587 and was buried at St. Giles&#x27;s, Cripplegate. His widow, Agnes, probably died in 1605. Foxe&#x27;s son, Samuel Foxe (1560–1630) prospered after his father&#x27;s death and &quot;accumulated a substantial estate.&quot; Fortunately for posterity, he also preserved his father&#x27;s manuscripts, and they are now in the British Library.

==Personality==
Foxe was so bookish that he ruined his health by his persistent study. Yet he had &quot;a genius for friendship,&quot; served as a spiritual counselor and was a man of private charity. He even took part in matchmaking. Foxe was so well known as a man of prayer that Francis Drake credited his victory at Cadiz in part to Foxe&#x27;s praying. Furthermore, Foxe&#x27;s extreme unworldliness caused others to claim that he had prophetic powers and could heal the sick.

Certainly, Foxe had a hatred of cruelty in advance of his age. When a number of Flemish Anabaptists were taken by Elizabeth&#x27;s government in 1572 and sentenced to be burnt, Foxe first wrote letters to the Queen and her council asking for their lives and then wrote to the prisoners themselves (having his Latin draft translated into Flemish) pleading with them to abandon what he considered their theological errors. Foxe even visited the Anabaptists in prison. (The attempted intercession was in vain; two were burnt at Smithfield &quot;in great horror with roaring and crying.&quot;)

John Day&#x27;s son Richard, who knew Foxe well, described him in 1607 as an &quot;excellent man … exceeding laborious in his pen … his learning inferior to none of his age and time; for his integrity of life a bright light to as many as knew him, beheld him, and lived with him&quot;
 Foxe&#x27;s funeral was accompanied &quot;by crowds of mourners&quot;.

==Historical reputation==
After his death, Foxe&#x27;s &quot;Acts and Monuments&quot; continued to be published and appreciatively read. John Burrow refers to it as, after the Bible, &quot;the greatest single influence on English Protestant thinking of the late Tudor and early Stuart period.&quot;

By the end of the 17th century, however, the work tended to be abbreviated to include only &quot;the most sensational episodes of torture and death&quot;, thus giving to Foxe&#x27;s work &quot;a lurid quality which was certainly far from the author&#x27;s intention.&quot; Because Foxe was used to attack Catholicism and a rising tide of high-church Anglicanism, the book&#x27;s credibility was challenged in the early 19th century by a number of authors, most importantly, Samuel R. Maitland. In the words of one Catholic Victorian, after Maitland&#x27;s critique, &quot;no one with any literary pretensions … ventured to quote Foxe as an authority.&quot; Further analysis of Maitland&#x27;s criticism in the 21st century has in the words of David Loades, that Maitland &quot;deserves to be treated with genuine, but limited, respect. His demolition of the martyrologist&#x27;s history of the Waldenses, and of some of his other medieval reconstructions, was accurate up to a point, but he never addressed those parts of the &quot;Acts and Monuments&quot; where Foxe was at his strongest, and his general conclusion that the work was nothing but a tissue of fabrications and distortions is not supported by modern analysis.&quot;

It was not until J. F. Mozley published &quot;John Foxe and His Book&quot;, in 1940, that Foxe&#x27;s rehabilitation as a historian began, initiating a controversy that has continued to the present. Recent renewed interest in Foxe as a seminal figure in early modern studies created a demand for a new critical edition of the &quot;Actes and Monuments&quot;: &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs Variorum Edition&quot;.

In the words of Thomas S. Freeman, one of the most important living Foxe scholars, &quot;current scholarship has formed a more complex and nuanced estimate of the accuracy of &quot;Acts and Monuments&quot; … Perhaps [Foxe] may be most profitably seen in the same light as a barrister pleading a case for a client he knows to be innocent and whom he is determined to save. Like the hypothetical barrister, Foxe had to deal with the evidence of what actually happened, evidence that he was rarely in a position to forge. But he would not present facts damaging to his client, and he had the skills that enabled him to arrange the evidence so as to make it conform to what he wanted it to say. Like the barrister, Foxe presents crucial evidence and tells one side of a story which must be heard. But he should never be read uncritically, and his partisan objectives should always be kept in mind.&quot;

<doc id="298311" wikidata="Q7902817" url="?curid=298311" title="Utilitarian bioethics">
<text>Utilitarian bioethics refers to the branch of bioethics that incorporates principles of utilitarianism to directing practices and resources where they will have the most usefulness and highest likelihood to produce happiness, in regards to medicine, health, and medical or biological research.

Utilitarian bioethics deals with whether or not decisions of biology or medicine are good based on the Greatest Happiness principle, and thus any action or decision that leads to happiness for the greatest number of people is good. Many see problems with the morality of utilitarian bioethics, citing moral dilemmas in medical research and triage for example. Still, proponents for utilitarian bioethics look toward models like quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and medical policies like the Texas Advanced Directives Act (TADA) and euthanasia in the Netherlands as advancements in modern health care, while dissenting views argue of its devaluing of individual human life.

==History==

Although utilitarian philosophy traces itself back to the nineteenth century British thinkers John Stuart Mill and Jeremy Bentham, the application of utilitarianism in contemporary bioethics originated in the work of Peter Singer in the 1970s and 1980s. A second generation of utilitarian bioethicists, including Julian Savulescu, Jacob M. Appel and Thaddeus Mason Pope, advanced utilitarian ethics further in the 1990s and 2000s. A few applications of the utilitarian bioethics in policy are the Groningen Protocol in the Netherlands and the Advance Directives Act in Texas.

In the 1990s, backlash against utilitarian bioethics emerged, led by such figures as Wesley J. Smith and novelist Dean Koontz. Philosopher Bernard Williams was also critical of the utilitarian perspective.

== Related areas ==

=== Morality ===
Those against utilitarian principles in research, health care, or bio-medical fields suggest that the means to achieve an overall benefit for society is not justified and becomes immoral, and anyone who is part of the act or who is involved in it being allowed is complicit in its immorality. They argue that utilitarianism fails to join itself with common morality, and thus the cannot be accepted as a moral, and any application of utilitarian principles are unethical.

Those in favor of utilitarian principles in research, health-care, or bio-medical fields seek advancements in these areas for the benefit of all people and the collective happiness as a species. They view, what those who are against utilitarian ethics would suggest as immoral acts, as good and necessary practices as a means to maximize total well-being, and the arguably controversial research and medical practices are good and beneficial to all people. Many who argue for the morality of utilitarian principles in research and medical areas point to our already accepted model of disaster triage, inherently utilitarian, which seeks to do the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people by foregoing treatment of those in critical conditions for those who have a higher chance to recover and those that can be quickly cared for to then help in the care effort.

=== Resource distribution ===

Utilitarian bioethics is based on the premise that the distribution of resources is a zero-sum game, and therefore medical decisions should logically be made on the basis of each person&#x27;s total future productive value and happiness, their chance of survival from the present, and the resources required for treatment. One way to grasp an effective way to distribute resources is by cost-effective analysis. Utilitarian bioethicists argue that cost-effective analysis is the most effective tool in distributing and utilizing resources so to maximize the best possible outcome with the idea that the outcome would lead to a benefit or increased happiness for society. One example of cost-effective analysis in regard to health care is the concept of quality-adjusted life years or QALY. QALY is a measure of benefit from treating or allocating resources to individuals based on the comparison of each individuals alternative outcome. Although there is controversy in regard to the equality of persons in this concept, equality should be regarded as a separate issue, because if one uses a standard of measurement that produces the same amount of qalys for each individual, as proposed by G.W. Torrance one of the economist credited to the creation of the concept, then there is unfairness when we consider different age groups, with the elderly getting a lower amount of qalys.

Some this method of resource allocation as mechanical and devoid of human emotion, and argue for an augmented form of cost-effective analysis which seeks to correct this, called the Kevany Riposte. The Kevany Riposte is similar to the traditional cost-effective analysis method in that it compares alternative choices and their cost-effective ratio, but adds and additional element to the equation which is called the diplomatic value. This added element to resource allocation takes into account the future diplomatic and political effects of a decision, which shows how choices can have a future improvement and be more advantageous in the long run, though less cost-effective in the outset.

For many resource allocation decisions, those involving the most rare and severe cases, medical culture and society are at odds and the choice of where to distribute resources will inevitably cause some ethical offense.

=== Policy ===
Though not the principle moral framework for guiding laws, utilitarian ethics can be seen in a number of different areas of state and federal laws, especially those involving resource distribution and health policies.

==== TADA and Futile Care ====
In 1999, with the passing of the TADA, Texas became the first state to have a law on the books that deals directly with futile medical care. Section 166.046, Subsection (e) of the law states physicians have the right to refuse any intervention they deem as inappropriate. Utilitarian ethics would allow for such a decision given that if there is no benefit from the intervention, than resources as being used ineffectively and therefore effecting others in society, decreasing overall happiness. Some argue that the law is inherently flawed, in that what some physicians find futile-care, others might not agree. And even more, some argue that the very law itself demeans the value and dignity of human life. There have also been cases where the physicians who determined that treatment being done was futile-care were actually not so, which lead to possibly avoidable death. Given its criticisms, many applaud TADA for its groundbreaking development into medical policy and see it as a step forward to better health care.

==== The Groningen Protocol and Neonatal Euthanasia ====
Euthanasia in the Netherlands has been legal for sometime, albeit not for infants. However, neonatal euthanasia still occurs in the Netherlands with a general tolerance by society and no physicians or associated parties going to trial. The Groningen Protocol sought to provide an ethical framework to allow for euthanasia of infants with severe medical diagnosis and prognosis. Many believe that the protocol cannot be followed because the criteria of the protocol cannot be met by neonates, namely the quality-of-life and pain and suffering criteria. Those against the protocol believe in the value of principlism, that of beneficence and non-maleficence, and that the physician should care for the infant with the best of their ability. Proponents of the protocol argue that if there is unanimous agreement for the euthanizing of the neonate among those who are in the best position to make that decision, the parents and physicians, then euthanizing is in severe cases is a good and not immoral.

<text>Neil Postman (March 8, 1931 – October 5, 2003) was an American author, educator, media theorist and cultural critic, who eschewed digital technology, including personal computers, mobile devices, and cruise control in cars, and was critical of uses of technology, such as personal computers in school. He is best known for twenty books regarding technology and education, including &quot;Teaching as a Subversive Activity&quot; (1970), &quot;The Disappearance of Childhood&quot; (1982), &quot;Amusing Ourselves to Death&quot; (1985), &quot;Conscientious Objections&quot; (1988), &quot;Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology&quot; (1992) and &quot;The End of Education: Redefining the Value of School&quot; (1995).

==Biography==
Postman was born in New York City, where he spent most of his life. In 1953, he graduated from the State University of New York at Fredonia and enlisted in the military but was released less than five months later. At Teachers College, Columbia University, he was awarded a master&#x27;s degree in 1955 and an Ed.D. (Doctor of Education) degree in 1958. Postman took a position with San Francisco State University&#x27;s English Department in 1958. Soon after, in 1959, he began teaching at New York University (NYU).

In 1971, at NYU&#x27;s Steinhardt School of Education, he founded a graduate program in media ecology. He became the School of Education&#x27;s only University Professor in 1993, and was chairman of the Department of Culture and Communication until 2002.

Postman received an honorary doctorate from Brigham Young University in 2000. 

Postman died at age 72 of lung cancer at a hospital in Flushing, Queens, on October 5, 2003. At the time, he had been married to his wife, Shelley Ross Postman, for 48 years. They had three children and were longtime residents of Flushing.

==Works==

Postman wrote 20 books and more than 200 articles in academic and popular publications including &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, &quot;Harvard Educational Review,&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Stern&quot; and &quot;Le Monde&quot;. He was the editor of the quarterly journal &quot;ETC: A Review of General Semantics&quot; from 1976 to 1986. In 1976, Postman taught a course for NYU credit on CBS-TV&#x27;s &quot;Sunrise Semester&quot; called &quot;Communication: the Invisible Environment&quot;. He was also a contributing editor at &quot;The Nation&quot;. Several of his articles were reprinted after his death in the quarterly journal, &quot;ETC: A Review of General Semantics&quot; as part of a 75th anniversary edition in October 2013.

==On education==
In 1969 and 1970, Postman collaborated with the New Rochelle educator Alan Shapiro on the development of a model school based on the principles expressed in &quot;Teaching as a Subversive Activity&quot;. In &quot;Teaching as a Subversive Activity,&quot; Postman and co-author Charles Weingartner suggest that many schools have curricula that are trivial and irrelevant to students&#x27; lives. The result of Postman and Weingartner&#x27;s critiques in &quot;Teaching as a Subversive Activity&quot; was the &quot;Program for Inquiry, Involvement, and Independent Study&quot; within New Rochelle High School. This &quot;open school&quot; experiment survived for 15 years and in subsequent years many programs following these principles were developed in American high schools; current survivors include Walter Koral&#x27;s language class at the Village School in Great Neck, New York.

In a 1973 address, &quot;The Ecology of Learning&quot;, at the Conference on English Education, Postman proposed seven changes for schools that build on his critiques expressed in &quot;Teaching as a Subversive Activity&quot;. First, Postman proposed that schools should be &quot;convivial communities&quot; for learning rather than places that try to control students through judgment and punishment. Secondly, he suggested that schools should either discard or dramatically change grading practices that lead to competition in school rather than an attitude of learning. He also proposed getting rid of homogeneous groupings of students that reinforce social and economic inequalities, standardized tests that promote competition and permanently kept student records that are used to punish and control students. Proactively, he suggested that industries and professional schools, rather than K-12 schools, should develop criteria for selecting students and that schools should focus on civic education that teaches students their rights as citizens.

Later in his career, Postman moved away from his work in &quot;Teaching as a Subversive Activity&quot; with the publication of &quot;Teaching as a Conserving Activity.&quot; In it Postman calls for schools to act as a counter to popular culture dominated by television and highlighted the need for an emphasis on literacy education. Postman also argued for the need of teachers to separate themselves from students in dress and speech, offering an alternative role model for children. Postman was concerned with the degradation of the culture caused by technology and saw education as a means of conserving important cultural ideas.

In a television interview conducted in 1995 on PBS&#x27;s &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour&quot;, Postman spoke about his opposition to the use of personal computers in schools. He felt that school was a place to learn together as a cohesive group and that it should not be used for individualized learning. Postman also worried that the personal computer was going to take away from individuals socializing as citizens and human beings.

== &quot;Amusing Ourselves to Death&quot; ==
One of Postman&#x27;s most influential works is &quot;Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business&quot;. In &quot;Amusing&quot;, Postman argued that by expressing ideas through visual imagery, television reduces politics, news, history and other serious topics to entertainment. He worried that culture would decline if the people became an audience and their public business a &quot;vaudeville act&quot;. He also argued that television is destroying the &quot;serious and rational public conversation&quot; that was sustained for centuries by the printing press. Rather than the restricted information in George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;1984&quot;, he claimed the flow of distraction we experience is akin to Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot;.

==&quot;Technopoly&quot;==
In his 1992 book &quot;Technopoly: the Surrender of Culture to Technology&quot;, Postman defines &quot;technopoly&quot; as a society which believes &quot;the primary, if not the only, goal of human labor and thought is efficiency, that technical calculation is in all respects superior to human judgment ... and that the affairs of citizens are best guided and conducted by experts&quot;.

In a C-SPAN interview, Postman described &quot;Technopoly&quot; as &quot;the tendency in American culture to turn over to technology sovereignty, command, control over all of our social institutions.&quot;

Postman argued that the United States is the only country to have developed into a technopoly. He claimed that the U.S. has been inundated with technophiles who do not see the downside of technology. This is dangerous because technophiles want more technology and thus more information. However, according to Postman, it is impossible for a technological innovation to have only a one-sided effect. With the ever-increasing amount of information available, Postman argues that: &quot;Information has become a form of garbage, not only incapable of answering the most fundamental human questions but barely useful in providing coherent direction to the solution of even mundane problems.&quot;

Postman was not opposed to all forms of technology. In &quot;Technopoly&quot;, he agrees that technological advancements, specifically &quot;the telephone, ocean liners, and especially the reign of hygiene&quot;, have lengthened and improved modern life. In his words, this agreement proves that he is not a &quot;one-eyed technophobe&quot;.

In &quot;Technopoly&quot;, Postman discusses Luddism, explaining that being a Luddite often is associated with a naive opposition to technology. But, according to Postman, historical Luddites were trying to preserve their way of life and rights given to them prior to the advancement of new technologies.

<text>John Day (1574–1638?) was an English dramatist of the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods.

==Life==
He was born at Cawston, Norfolk, and educated at Ely. He became a sizar of Caius College, Cambridge, in 1592, but was expelled in the next year for stealing a book. He became one of Philip Henslowe&#x27;s playwrights, collaborating with Henry Chettle, William Haughton, Thomas Dekker, Richard Hathwaye and Wentworth Smith. There are 22 plays to which he is linked.

However his almost incessant activity does not seem to have paid, to judge by the small loans, of five shillings and even two shillings, that he obtained from Henslowe. Little is known of his life beyond these small details, and disparaging references by Ben Jonson in 1618/19, describing him, (with Dekker and Edward Sharpham) as a &quot;rogue&quot; and (with Thomas Middleton and Gervase Markham) as a &quot;base fellow&quot;. It may be indicative of his abilities that of all the writers who did a substantial amount of work for Henslowe&#x27;s companies Day is one of only two not mentioned and praised by Francis Meres in his lists of &quot;the best&quot; writers in 1598. In &quot;Peregrinatio Scholastica, or Learning&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;, a collection of 22 &quot;morall Tractes&quot; written towards the end of his life, but not published until 1881, he laments that &quot;notwithstanding . . . Industry . . . he was forct to take a napp at Beggars Bushe&quot;, and elsewhere he refers to &quot;being becalmde in a fogg of necessity&quot; having been passed over by &quot;Credit&quot; and &quot;Opinion&quot;. It seems likely that he was the &quot;John Daye, yeoman&quot; who killed fellow dramatist Henry Porter in Southwark 1599. If so it does not seem have to interrupted his career; he continued to collaborate with writers such as Henry Chettle, who had written with Porter.

==Works==
The first play in which Day appears as part-author is &quot;The Conquest of Brute, with the finding of the Bath&quot; (1598), which, with most of his early work, is lost. Day&#x27;s earliest extant work, written in collaboration with Chettle, is &quot;The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green&quot; (acted 1600, printed 1659), a drama dealing with the early years of the reign of Henry VI. It bore the sub-title of &quot;The Merry Humor of Tom Strowd, the Norfolk Yeoman&quot;, and was so popular that second and third parts, by Day and Haughton, were produced in the next year. &quot;The Isle of Gulls&quot; (printed 1606), a prose comedy founded upon Sir Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Arcadia&quot;, contains in its light dialogue much satire to which the key is now lost, but Algernon Charles Swinburne notes in Manasses&#x27;s burlesque of a Puritan sermon is a curious anticipation of the eloquence of Mr. Chadband in &quot;Bleak House&quot;. In 1607 Day produced, in conjunction with William Rowley and George Wilkins, &quot;The Travels of the Three English Brothers&quot;, which detailed the adventures of Sir Thomas, Sir Anthony and Robert Shirley. This play is a dramatic romance of a type that hearkened back to the early decades of the public stage in London. In 1608 Day published two comedies, &quot;Law Tricks, or Who Would have Thought it?&quot; and &quot;Humour out of Breath&quot;.

&quot;The Parliament of Bees&quot; is the work on which Day&#x27;s reputation chiefly rests. The piece contains much for which parallel passages are found in Thomas Dekker&#x27;s &quot;Wonder of a Kingdom&quot; (1636) and &quot;The Noble Spanish Soldier&quot; (printed 1634). The passages which echo &quot;The Noble Spanish Soldier&quot; include references to speaking Spanish which are only meaningful in the context of Dekker&#x27;s play; this suggests that the Dekker play is the original, a possibility reinforced by the consideration that there is no known edition of &quot;The Parliament of Bees&quot; earlier than 1641.

The six dramas by Day which we possess show a delicate fancy and dainty inventiveness all his own. He preserved, in a great measure, the dramatic tradition of John Lyly, and affected a kind of subdued euphuism. Without ever wholly abandoning these characteristics, Day&#x27;s comedy also reveals some influence of early Jacobean satirists such as John Marston, who like Day wrote for the children&#x27;s companies. &quot;The Maid&#x27;s Metamorphosis&quot; (1600), once supposed to be a posthumous work of Lyly&#x27;s, may be an early work of Day&#x27;s. It possesses, at all events, many of his marked characteristics. His prose &quot;Peregrinatio Scholastica or Learninges Pilgrimage&quot;, dating from his later years, was printed by A. H. Bullen from a manuscript of Day&#x27;s. Considerations partly based on this work have suggested that he had a share in the anonymous &quot;The Pilgrimage to Parnassus&quot; and the &quot;Return from Parnassus&quot;. The beauty and ingenuity of &quot;The Parliament of Bees&quot; were noted and warmly extolled by Charles Lamb; and Day&#x27;s work has since found many admirers.
The date of his death is unknown, but an elegy on him by John Tatham, the city poet, was published in 1640.

==Publication==
His works, edited by Bullen, were printed at the Chiswick Press in 1881. The same editor included &quot;The Maid&#x27;s Metamorphosis&quot; in Vol. 1 of his &quot;Collection of Old Plays&quot;. &quot;The Parliament of Bees&quot; and &quot;Humour out of Breath&quot; were printed in &quot;Nero and other Plays&quot; (Mermaid Series, 1888), with an introduction by Arthur Symons. An appreciation by Algernon Charles Swinburne appeared in &quot;The Nineteenth Century&quot; (October 1897).

<doc id="298315" wikidata="Q2839880" url="?curid=298315" title="Samuel Rowley">
<text>Samuel Rowley was a 17th-century English dramatist and actor.

Rowley first appears in the historical record as an associate of Philip Henslowe in the late 1590s. Initially he appears to have been an actor, perhaps a sharer, in the Admiral&#x27;s Men, who performed at the Rose Theatre. After 1598, he assumed some non-acting responsibilities, helping Henslowe and Edward Alleyn manage the business affairs of the company. Yet he remained an actor as late as 1617, as he appears in the &quot;plots&quot; for plays including &quot;Frederick and Basilea&quot; (as Heraclius), &quot;The Battle of Alcazar&quot; (as an ambassador), and &quot;1 Tamar Cam&quot;. He remained with the company through its successive patronage by Prince Henry and the Palsgrave.

As a writer, Rowley belonged to the crowd of collaborating playwrights who kept Henslowe and Alleyn supplied with new drama. Henslowe paid him for additions to Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;; tradition, deferential to Marlowe, has assigned him the clown&#x27;s bits in the 1616 edition. He wrote the now-lost &quot;Judas&quot; with William Borne (or Bird, or Boyle) and Edward Juby. He also wrote alone. His only extant solo work is &quot;When You See Me You Know Me&quot; (1603–5), a history of Henry VIII from the death of Jane Seymour to the visit of Charles V. He also wrote a play on Richard III and two apparent comedies, &quot;Hard Shift for Husbands&quot; and &quot;A Match or no Match&quot;—all three licensed shortly before his death, and none of which have survived.

On stylistic grounds, H. D. Sykes assigned him a share in &quot;The Famous Victories of Henry V&quot;, &quot;The Taming of a Shrew&quot;, and parts of Robert Greene&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;. These attributions are possible but not widely accepted, as the plays are associated with Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Men, a troupe with which Rowley is not otherwise associated. MacD. P. Jackson also credits him with writing &quot;Richard II, Part One&quot; which others attribute to Shakespeare.

The long-uncertain question of his connection to the more-famous William Rowley was perhaps clarified by the discovery of his will in the 1960s: in this document, a brother named William is bequeathed all of Samuel&#x27;s books. Samuel Rowley died in the parish of St Mary&#x27;s in Whitechapel, where he had resided for decades.

<doc id="298318" wikidata="Q2068895" url="?curid=298318" title="Henry Chettle">
<text>Henry Chettle () was an English dramatist and miscellaneous writer of the Elizabethan era, best known for his pamphleteering.

==Early life==
The son of Robert Chettle, a London dyer, he was apprenticed in 1577 and became a member of the Stationer&#x27;s Company in 1584, traveling to Cambridge on their behalf in 1588. His career as a printer and author is shadowy. He may have set up some of the tracts printed in response to Martin Marprelate. In 1591, he entered into partnership with William Hoskins and John Danter, two stationers. They published a good many ballads, and some plays, including a surreptitious and botched first quarto of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, to which it is suggested Chettle added lines and stage directions.

==&quot;The Groat&#x27;s-Worth of Wit&quot;==
In 1592 &quot;Greene&#x27;s Groats-Worth of Wit&quot;, supposedly the work of the recently deceased, and very popular, Robert Greene, was published, having been entered in the register of the Stationer&#x27;s Company &quot;at the peril of Henry Chettle&quot;. This contained a passage criticising various playwrights, which offended at least two contemporary writers, one probably the alleged &quot;atheist&quot; Christopher Marlowe and the other possibly William Shakespeare. Chettle was accused of writing the work under Greene&#x27;s name. He denied the charge in the preface to his &quot;Kind Heart&#x27;s Dream&quot;, published later that year:

About three months since died M. Robert Greene, leaving many papers in sundry booksellers&#x27; hands, among other his Groatsworth of Wit, in which a letter written to divers play-makers is offensively by one or two of them taken, and because on the dead they cannot be avenged, they willfully forge in their conceits a living author [...] With neither of them that take offence was I acquainted, and with one of them I care not if I never be. The other, whom at that time I did not so much spare as since I wish I had, for that, as I have moderated the heat of living writers and might have used my own discretion (especially in such a case, the author being dead), that I did not I am as sorry as if the original fault had been my fault, because myself have seen his demeanor no less civil than he excellent in the quality he professes. Besides, divers of worship have reported his uprightness of dealing, which argues his honesty, and his facetious grace in writing that approves his art.

The theory that &quot;Greene&#x27;s Groatsworth&quot; is a forgery by Chettle has been both supported and challenged by scholars. In 1935 Harold Jenkins attributed the work to Greene, not Chettle. However, a pioneering 1969 computer-aided stylometric analysis by Warren B. Austin firmly attributed it to Chettle. Austin&#x27;s views were challenged in 2006 by Richard Westley.

==Links to Henslowe==
He seems to have been generally in debt, judging from numerous entries in Philip Henslowe&#x27;s diary of advances for various purposes, on one occasion (17 January 1599) to pay his expenses in the Marshalsea prison, on another (7 March 1603) to get his play out of pawn. He made a greater number of small borrowings from Henslowe than any other person. These and Henslowe&#x27;s casual records of them suggest some friendship between them, though in 1602 Chettle seems to have been writing for both Worcester&#x27;s Company and the Admiral&#x27;s, despite signing a bond to write exclusively for the latter.

==Works==
As early as 1598 Francis Meres includes Chettle in his &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot; as one of the &quot;best for comedy&quot;, and Henslowe lists payments to him for thirty-six plays between 1598 and 1603, and he may have been involved in as many as fifty plays, although only a dozen seem to be his alone. Chettle had regular association with Henry Porter, Thomas Dekker, and after 1600 with John Day. Of the thirteen plays usually attributed to Chettle&#x27;s sole authorship only one was printed. This was &quot;The Tragedy of Hoffmann: or a Revenge for a Father&quot; (played 1602; printed 1631). It has been suggested that this piece was put forward as a rival to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

Chettle&#x27;s non-dramatic writings include (besides &quot;Kind Heart&#x27;s Dream&quot;) &quot;Piers Plainnes Seaven Yeres Prentiship&quot; (1595), the story of a fictitious apprenticeship in Crete and Thrace, and &quot;England&#x27;s Mourning Garment&quot; (1603), in which are included some verses alluding to the chief poets of the time.

==Death==
He died before 1607, when Dekker in his &quot;Knight&#x27;s Conjurer&quot; described him joining the poets in Elysium: &quot;in comes Chettle sweating and blowing by reason of his fatness&quot;.

<text>Sir John Suckling (1569 – 27 March 1627) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1601 and 1627.

Suckling was the son of Robert Suckling, mayor of Norwich and MP for the city&#x27;s constituency between 1571-1572 and 1586-1588, and his wife Elizabeth Barwick, daughter of William Barwick. He entered Gray&#x27;s Inn on 22 May 1590. He was elected Member of Parliament for Dunwich in 1601.

In 1602, he was acting as secretary to the Lord High Treasurer, Sir Robert Cecil, and in December 1604 he became receiver of fines on alienations, in succession to Sir Arthur Aty. In 1614 he was elected MP for Reigate. He was knighted by James I at Theobalds on 22 January 1616. In February 1619 he became a Master of Requests, and, in 1622, he was appointed comptroller of the royal household, &quot;paying well for the post.&quot; Suckling had become wealthy and accumulated manors, fee-farms, and advowsons in various parts of the country. 

In September 1621, he was mentioned as Sir Richard Weston&#x27;s most serious competitor for the chancellorship of the exchequer and in March 1622 he was promoted to be secretary of state. Charles I, upon his accession three years later, created him a privy councillor. 

In 1624, he was elected MP for Middlesex, Lichfield and Kingston upon Hull and chose to sit for Middlesex. In 1625, he represented Yarmouth (IoW) after Edward Clarke opted to sit for Hythe. In 1626 he was elected MP for Norwich and for Sandwich; he chose to sit for Norwich.

==Marriages==
Suckling married Martha Cranfield, daughter of Thomas Cranfield of London, and sister of Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex. She died on 28 October 1613, aged 35. By her, he was the father of the poet Sir John Suckling. A monument of Sir John Suckling, his first wife, Martha, and family, can be seen in St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Norwich.

On 2 March 1616, Suckling married Jane Hawkins, widow of Charles Hawkins and originally of the Suffolk family of Reve or Reeve. Suckling&#x27;s widow took as her third husband Sir Edwin Rich, of Mulbarton, Norfolk and on the default of her stepson carried into that family the estate of Roos Hall near Beccles Suffolk which Suckling had acquired in 1600 as his residence. On Suckling&#x27;s death, Roos Hall had been inherited by Sir Alexander Temple (Suckling&#x27;s brother-in-law) in lieu of repayment of a debt, but was later repurchased by the family.

<text>Thomas Heywood (early 1570s – 16 August 1641) was an English playwright, actor, and author. His main contributions were to late Elizabethan and early Jacobean theatre. He is best known for his masterpiece &quot;A Woman Killed with Kindness&quot;, a domestic tragedy, which was first performed in 1603 at the Rose Theatre by the Worcester&#x27;s Men company. He was a prolific writer, claiming to have had &quot;an entire hand or at least a maine finger in two hundred and twenty plays&quot;, although only a fraction of his work has survived.

==Early years==
Few details of Heywood&#x27;s life have been documented with certainty. Most references indicate that the county of his birth was most likely Lincolnshire, while the year has been variously given as 1570, 1573, 1574 and 1575. It has been speculated that his father was a country parson and that he was related to the half-century-earlier dramatist John Heywood, whose death year is, again, uncertain, but indicated as having occurred not earlier than 1575 and not later than 1589.

Heywood is said to have been educated at the University of Cambridge, though his college is a matter of dispute. The persistent tradition that he was a Fellow of Peterhouse was discussed and dismissed by a Master of that college. Alternatively, there is evidence that Heywood was a member of Emmanuel. Subsequently, however, he moved to London, where the first mention of his dramatic career is a note in the diary of theatre entrepreneur Philip Henslowe recording that he was paid for a play that was performed by the Admiral&#x27;s Men, an acting company, in October 1596. By 1598, he was regularly engaged as a player in the company; since no wages are mentioned, he was presumably a sharer in the company, as was normal for important company members. He was later a member of other companies, including Lord Southampton&#x27;s, Lord Strange&#x27;s Men and Worcester&#x27;s Men (who subsequently became known as Queen Anne&#x27;s Men). During this time, Heywood was extremely prolific; in his preface to &quot;The English Traveller&quot; (1633) he describes himself as having had &quot;an entire hand or at least a maine finger in two hundred and twenty plays&quot;. However, only twenty three plays and eight masques have survived that are accepted by historians as wholly or partially authored by him.

==Creative activity==
Heywood&#x27;s first play may have been &quot;The Four Prentices of London&quot; (printed 1615, but acted some fifteen years earlier). This tale of four apprentices who become knights and travel to Jerusalem may have been intended as a burlesque of the old romances, but it is more likely that it was meant seriously to attract the apprentice spectators to whom it was dedicated. Its popularity was satirized in Beaumont and Fletcher&#x27;s travesty of the middle-class taste in drama, &quot;The Knight of the Burning Pestle&quot;. Heywood&#x27;s two-part history plays &quot;Edward IV&quot; (printed 1600), and &quot;If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody, or, The Troubles of Queene Elizabeth&quot; (1605 and 1606) concern, respectively, The Wars of the Roses and the life of the Queen contrasted with that of the preeminent merchant and financier Thomas Gresham.

He wrote for the stage, and (perhaps disingenuously) protested against the printing of his works, saying he had no time to revise them. Johann Ludwig Tieck called him the &quot;model of a light and rare talent&quot;, and Charles Lamb wrote that he was a &quot;prose Shakespeare&quot;; Professor Ward, one of Heywood&#x27;s most sympathetic editors, pointed out that Heywood had a keen eye for dramatic situations and great constructive skill, but his powers of characterization were not on a par with his stagecraft. He delighted in what he called &quot;merry accidents&quot;, that is, in coarse, broad farce; his fancy and invention were inexhaustible.

Heywood&#x27;s best known plays are his domestic tragedies and comedies (plays set among the English middle classes); his masterpiece is generally considered to be &quot;A Woman Killed with Kindness&quot; (acted 1603; printed 1607), a domestic tragedy about an adulterous wife, and a widely admired Plautine farce &quot;The English Traveller&quot; (acted approximately 1627; printed 15 July 1633), which is also known for its informative &quot;Preface&quot;, giving Heywood an opportunity to inform the reader about his prolific creative output. His citizen comedies are noteworthy because of their physicality and energy. They provide a psycho-geography of the sights, smells, and sounds of London&#x27;s wharfs, markets, shops, and streets which contrasts with the more conventional generalisations about the sites of commerce, which are satirised in city comedies.

Heywood wrote numerous prose works, mostly pamphlets about contemporary subjects, of interest now primarily to historians studying the period. His best known long essay is &quot;An Apology for Actors&quot;, a moderately-toned and reasonable reply to Puritan attacks on the stage, which contains a wealth of detailed information on the actors and acting conditions of Heywood&#x27;s day. It is in the &quot;Epistle to the Printer&quot; in this 1612 work that Heywood writes about William Jaggard&#x27;s appropriation of two of Heywood&#x27;s poems for the same year&#x27;s edition of &quot;The Passionate Pilgrim&quot;. In 1641 Heywood had printed &quot;The Life of Merlin Surnamed Ambrosius&quot;. The book chronicled all the kings of England dating back to the legendary king Brutus, who had come from Troy to start an exploration and a new colony, up to Charles I who was the King when Heywood died. The book goes on to chronicle certain prophesies told by Merlin and the interpretations of each and explanation of each within the context of the modern world.

==Final two decades==
Between 1619 and 1624, Heywood seems to have inexplicably ceased all activity as an actor, but from 1624, until his death seventeen years later, his name frequently appears in contemporary accounts. In this period, Heywood was associated with Christopher Beeston&#x27;s company at The Phoenix theatre, Queen Henrietta&#x27;s Men or Lady Elizabeth&#x27;s Men. At The Phoenix, Heywood produced new plays such as &quot;The Captives&quot;, &quot;The English Traveller&quot;, and &quot;A Maidenhead Well Lost&quot; as well as revivals of old plays. Numerous volumes of his prose and poetry were published, including two lengthy poetic works, &quot;Gynaikeion&quot; (1624), described as &quot;nine books of various history concerning women&quot; and, eleven years later, &quot;The Hierarchy of the Blessed Angels&quot;. As a measure of Heywood&#x27;s popular standing in the final years of his life, &quot;Love&#x27;s Mistress or the Queen&#x27;s Masque&quot;, a play published in 1636, but performed since 1634, was reported to have been seen by King Charles I and his queen three times in eight days.

According to writings of the period, Thomas Heywood had been living in Clerkenwell since 1623 and it was there, at St. James&#x27;s Church that he was buried eighteen years later. Because of the uncertainty regarding the year of his birth, his age can only be estimated, but he was likely in his late sixties, possibly having reached seventy. The date of the burial, 16 August 1641, the only documented date, also appears in a number of reference books as Heywood&#x27;s death date, although he may actually have died days earlier. It may be presumed, however, that due to a possible August heatwave, the burial occurred on an expedited basis.

<doc id="298324" wikidata="Q1818349" url="?curid=298324" title="William Haughton (playwright)">
<text>William Haughton (died 1605) was an English playwright in the age of English Renaissance theatre.

==Life==
Most of what little biographical information there is about him is derived from the papers of Philip Henslowe, proprietor of the Rose Theatre. Henslowe&#x27;s earliest reference to him refers to him as &quot;young&quot; Haughton. He wrote all his known dramatic work for Henslowe, for production by the Admiral&#x27;s Men and Worcester&#x27;s Men. (Henslowe&#x27;s papers refer to Haughton as Hawton, Hauton, Haughtoun, Haulton, Howghton, Horton, Harton, and Harvghton—a fine example of the famously flexible Elizabethan orthography. His name is spelled Houghton in his 1605 will.)

On 10 March 1600 Henslowe lent Haughton ten shillings &quot;to release him out of The Clink&quot;.

A William Haughton received an M.A. from Oxford in 1604, but Baugh doubts that this was the playwright. Haughton made his will on 6 June 1605, with his sometime dramatic collaborator Wentworth Smith and one Elizabeth Lewes as witnesses. It was proved on 20 July 1605. He was of All Hallows Staining at that time, a London church whose tower survives. He left a widow Alice and children.

==Career as a playwright==
During the years 1597 to 1602 he collaborated in many plays with Henry Chettle, Thomas Dekker, John Day, Richard Hathwaye and Wentworth Smith. Haughton&#x27;s hand has also been sought in several anonymous plays of the period, including &quot;Wiley Beguiled&quot;, &quot;The Wit of a Woman&quot;, &quot;The Merry Devil of Edmonton&quot;, &quot;Captain Thomas Stukeley&quot; and &quot;A Warning For Fair Women&quot;.

A merry comedy entitled &quot;Englishmen for My Money, or A Woman will have her Will&quot; (1598) is ascribed to his sole authorship, and Fleay credits him with a considerable share in &quot;Patient Grissel&quot; (1599). The latter attribution has been confirmed and refined by W. L. Halstead and by Cyrus Hoy (1980), giving the subplot concerning Sir Owen the Welsh Knight and his wife Gwenthyan, as well as that concerning the Duke&#x27;s sister Julia and her three foolish suitors to Haughton, leaving the main plot to Dekker and Chettle.

&quot;The Devil and his Dame&quot;, mentioned as a forthcoming play by Henslowe in March 1600, is identified by Fleay as &quot;Grim the Collier of Croydon&quot;, which was printed in 1662. In this play an emissary is sent from the infernal regions to report on the conditions of married life on earth.
 This attribution has recently been confirmed by William M Baillie (see below).

&quot;Grim&quot; is reprinted in vol. viii, and &quot;Englishmen for My Money&quot; iii, vol. 5, of WC Hazlitt&#x27;s edition of Dodsley&#x27;s &quot;Old Plays&quot;. &quot;Englishmen for My Money&quot; was edited in old-spelling by A. C. Baugh in 1917, and appeared as a Tudor Facsimile Text in 1911. &quot;Grim&quot; has been edited by William L. Baillie as part of &quot;A Choice Ternary of English Plays: Gratiae Theatrales&quot; (1984), and appeared as a Tudor Facsimile Text in 1912. &quot;Patient Grissell&quot; appears in Fredson Bowers&#x27; edition of Dekker&#x27;s Dramatic Works. In May 1600 he brokered a play, now lost, to Henslowe called &quot;The English Fugitives&quot;, possibly based on Lewes Lewknor&#x27;s &quot;The Estate of English Fugitives&quot; published in 1595.

==Known works==

<text>Anthony Munday (or Monday) (1560?10 August 1633) was an English playwright and miscellaneous writer. He was baptized on 13 October 1560 in St Gregory by St Paul&#x27;s, London, and was the son of Christopher Munday, a stationer, and Jane Munday. He was one of the chief predecessors of Shakespeare in English dramatic composition, and wrote plays about Robin Hood. He is believed to be the primary author of &quot;Sir Thomas More&quot;, on which he is believed to have collaborated with Henry Chettle, Thomas Heywood, William Shakespeare, and Thomas Dekker.

==Biography==

He was once thought to have been born in 1553, because the monument to him in the church of St Stephen Coleman Street, since destroyed, stated that at the time of his death, he was eighty years old. From the inscription we likewise learn that he was &quot;a citizen and draper&quot;. In 1589 he was living in the city, and dates his translation of &quot;The History of Palmendos&quot; &quot;from my house in Cripplegate&quot;. That he carried on the business of a draper or had some connection with the trade as late as 1613, may be gathered from the following passage at the close of &quot;The Triumphs of Truth&quot;, the city pageant for that year, by Thomas Middleton: &quot;The fire-work being made by Maister Humphrey Nichols, a man excellent in his art; and the whole work and body of the Triumph, with all the proper beauties of the workmanship, most artfully and faithfully performed by John Grinkin; and those furnished with apparel and porters by Anthony Munday, Gentleman.&quot; The style of &quot;gentleman&quot; was probably given to him with reference to the productions of his pen.

He probably already had appeared on the stage as an actor when he was bound apprenticed in 1576 for eight years to the stationer John Allde, an apprenticeship from which he was soon released. By 1578 he was in Rome. In the opening lines of his &quot;English Romayne Lyfe&quot; (1582), he states that he went abroad solely in order to see strange countries and to learn foreign languages; but he may have been a spy sent to report on the Jesuit English College in Rome or a journalist intent on making literary capital out of the designs of the English Catholics then living in France and Italy. He writes that he and his companion, Thomas Nowell, were robbed of all their possessions on the road from Boulogne to Amiens, where they were helped by an English priest who entrusted them with letters to be delivered in Reims. These they handed over to the English ambassador in Paris. Under a false name, as the son of a well-known English Catholic, Munday gained recommendations which secured his reception at the English College in Rome. He was treated with special kindness by the rector, Dr Morris, for the sake of his supposed father. He gives a detailed account of the routine of the place, of the dispute between the English and Welsh students, of the carnival at Rome, and finally of the martyrdom of Richard Atkins.

===The playwriting years===
His political services against the Catholics were rewarded in 1584 by the post of messenger to her Majesty&#x27;s chamber, and from this time he seems to have given up acting. In 1598–1599, when he travelled with the Earl of Pembroke&#x27;s men in the Low Countries, it was in the capacity of playwright to rewrite old plays. He devoted &#x27;himself to writing for the booksellers and the theatres, compiling religious works, translating &quot;Amadis de Gaule&quot; and other French (sic) romances, and putting words to popular airs.

He was the chief pageant writer for the City from 1605 to 1616. These works included &quot;London&#x27;s Love to Prince Henry&quot; (1610), his publication describing the city&#x27;s pageant on the Thames for the investiture of Prince Henry as Prince of Wales in May 1610. One of the more gorgeous Lord Mayor&#x27;s shows was that of 1616, which was devised by Munday. It is also possible that he supplied most of the pageants between 1592 and 1605, of which no authentic record has been kept.

==His works==

At what date he acquired the title of &quot;poet to the city&quot; is not known; he had certainly been previously employed in a similar capacity, as Ben Jonson introduces him in that capacity in &quot;The Case is Altered&quot;, which was written in 1598 or 1599. He pours ridicule upon &quot;Don Antonio Balladino&quot; (as he calls Munday), and Middleton mentions him in his &quot;The Triumphs of Truth&quot;.

Munday was a prolific author in verse and prose, original and translated, and may be counted among the predecessors of Shakespeare in dramatic composition. One of his earliest works was &quot;The Mirror of Mutability&quot;, from 1579: he dedicated it to his long-time patron Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, and perhaps then belonged to the Earl&#x27;s company of players, to which he had again attached himself on his return from Italy. Munday&#x27;s &quot;Banquet of Dainty Conceits&quot; was printed in 1588.

Nearly all the existing information respecting Anthony Munday&#x27;s dramatic works is derived from Philip Henslowe&#x27;s papers. At what period he began to write for the stage cannot be ascertained: the earliest date in these manuscripts connected with his name is December 1597, but he may have been a member of the Earl of Oxford&#x27;s theatrical company before he went to Rome prior to 1578. In the old catalogues, and in Gerard Langbaine&#x27;s &quot;Momus Triumphans&quot;, 1688, a piece called &quot;Fidele and Fortunatus&quot; is mentioned, and such a play was entered at Stationers&#x27; Hall on 12 November 1584. There is little doubt that this is the same production, two copies of which have been discovered, with the running title of &quot;Two Italian Gentlemen&quot;, that being the second title to &quot;Fidele and Fortunatus&quot; in the Register. Both copies are without title pages; but to one of them is prefixed a dedication signed A.M., and we may with tolerable certainty conclude that Anthony Munday was the author or translator of it, and that it was printed about the date of its entry on the Stationers&#x27; Books.

Munday wrote two plays on the life of Robin Hood, &quot;The Downfall&quot; and &quot;The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington&quot;, first mentioned in the Rose theatre records in 1597–8 and published in 1601.

===Contemporary reception===
The earliest praise of Munday is contained in William Webbe&#x27;s &quot;Discourse of English Poetrie&quot;, 1586, where his &quot;Sweete Sobs of Sheepheardes and Nymphes&quot; is especially pointed out as &quot;very rare poetrie.&quot; Francis Meres, in 1598 (&quot;Palladis Tamia,&quot; fo. 283, b.), enumerating many of the best dramatic poets of his day, including Shakespeare, Heywood, Chapman, Porter, Lodge, etc., gives Anthony Munday the praise of being &quot;our best plotter&quot;.

<doc id="298328" wikidata="Q4857090" url="?curid=298328" title="Banqueting house">
<text>In English architecture, mainly from the Tudor period onwards, a banqueting house is a separate pavilion-like building reached through the gardens from the main residence, whose use is purely for entertaining, especially eating. Or it may be built on the roof of a main house, as in many 16th-century prodigy houses. It may be raised for additional air or a vista, with a simple kitchen below, as at Hampton Court Palace and Wrest Park, and it may be richly decorated, but it normally contains no bedrooms, and typically a single grand room apart from any service spaces. The design is often ornamental, if not downright fanciful, and some are also follies, as in Paxton&#x27;s Tower. There are usually plenty of windows, as appreciating the view was a large part of their purpose. Often they are built on a slope, so that from the front, only the door to the main room can be seen; the door to the servants&#x27; spaces underneath was hidden at the back (Wrest Park). The Banqueting House, Gibside is an example.

In the English of the period, &quot;banquet&quot; had two distinct meanings: firstly a grand formal celebratory meal (the usual modern sense), but also a course or light meal taken in a special place away from the main dining place, the relevant sense here (Whitehall apart). In large meals a banqueting house was most likely to be used for eating dessert, if reasonably close to the main house. Otherwise it might be used on fine days for taking tea, or any kind of drink, snack or meal. 
The best known example, though far larger than most, is the Banqueting House on Whitehall, once part of Whitehall Palace. This is a grand dining hall for full formal meals, and what may be called in distinction a banqueting hall. Such buildings were created in various settings, for example at Cholmley House next to Whitby Abbey, which had been converted into a country house. Most banqueting houses fitted at most twenty people, and many fewer. 

Similar buildings, under various names such as &quot;pavilion&quot;, appear in the architecture of European and many Asian countries. Its contemporary Italian equivalent was a &quot;casina&quot;; the Casina Pio IV in the grounds of the Vatican Palace, (1550s-1560s) is an architecturally important example. Large French examples, like the Château du Grand Jardin of the House of Guise are called a &quot;maison de plaisance&quot; (house of pleasures).

<text>Edmund Campion, SJ (25 January 15401 December 1581) was an English Jesuit priest and martyr. While conducting an underground ministry in officially Anglican England, Campion was arrested by priest hunters. Convicted of high treason, he was hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn. Campion was beatified by Pope Leo XIII in 1886 and canonised in 1970 by Pope Paul VI as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales. His feast day is celebrated on 1 December.

==Early years and education (1540–1569)==
Born in London on 25 January 1540, Campion was the son of a bookseller in Paternoster Row, near St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. He received his early education at Christ&#x27;s Hospital school and, at the age of 13, was chosen to make the complimentary speech when Queen Mary visited the city in August 1553. William Chester, a governor of Christ&#x27;s Hospital, took a special interest in him, and sponsored him as a scholar to St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he became junior fellow in 1557 and took the required Oath of Supremacy, probably on the occasion of his B.A. degree in 1560. He took a master&#x27;s degree at Oxford in 1564.

Two years later, Campion welcomed Queen Elizabeth to the university, and won her lasting regard. He was selected to lead a public debate in front of the Queen. By the time the Queen had left Oxford, Campion had earned the patronage of the powerful William Cecil and also the Earl of Leicester, tipped by some to be future husband of the young Queen.

When Sir Thomas White, the founder of the college, was buried in 1567, it fell to Campion to give the Latin oration.

==Rejecting Anglicanism==
Religious difficulties then arose but despite holding Catholic doctrines, at the persuasion of Richard Cheyney, Bishop of Gloucester, he received Holy Orders in 1564 as a deacon in the Anglican Church. Inwardly &quot;he took a remorse of conscience and detestation of mind.&quot; Rumours of his opinions began to spread and he left Oxford in 1569 and went to Ireland for private study and research, but not, as Simpson said (now corrected by P. Joseph&#x27;s revision of Simpson, 2010) to take part in a proposed establishment of the University of Dublin.

===Ireland (1569–1570)===
Edmund Campion went to Ireland with his university friend, Richard Stanihurst, where he was the guest of Richard and his father, James Stanihurst, the Speaker of the Irish House of Commons. Warned of his imminent arrest by the Lord Deputy Sir Henry Sidney, he was transferred through Stanihurst&#x27;s arrangement to the house of Christopher Barnewall at Turvey House in the Pale. For some three months he eluded his pursuers, going by the name &quot;Mr Patrick&quot; and occupying himself by writing &quot;A Historie of Ireland&quot;.

===Douai (1571–1573)===
In the year of 1571, Campion left Ireland in secret and escaped to Douai in the Low Countries (now France) where he was reconciled to the Catholic Church and received the Eucharist that he had denied himself for the past twelve years. He entered the English College founded by William Allen. The enrollment of the college grew, and a papal subsidy was granted a little time after Campion&#x27;s arrival. Campion found himself reunited with Oxford friends. He was to teach rhetoric while there and finish studying for the degree of Bachelor of Divinity, which was granted him by the University of Douai on 21 January 1573. He received minor orders after this and was ordained sub-deacon.

===Rome, Brünn and Prague (1573–1580)===
Campion then travelled to Rome on foot, alone and in the guise of a pilgrim, to join the Jesuits. In April 1573, in Rome, he became the first novice accepted into the Society of Jesus by Mercurianus, the order&#x27;s fourth Superior General. He was assigned to the Austrian Province as there was not yet an English province of the Jesuits and began his two-year novitiate at Brünn (now Brno) in Moravia. He was ordained deacon and priest by Antonín Brus, OMCRS, Archbishop of Prague and said his first Mass on 8 September 1578. For six years, Campion taught at the Jesuit college in Prague as professor of both rhetoric and philosophy. In 1578 his play &quot;Ambrosia&quot; was staged in Prague by the students of the recently founded Jesuit College Clementinum.

===Mission to England (1580–1581)===
In 1580, the Jesuit mission to England began. The mission was strictly forbidden, according to Campion&#x27;s &quot;Challenge to the Privy Council&quot;, &quot;to deal in any respects with matters of state or policy of this [English] realm...&quot; Campion accompanied Robert Persons who, as superior, was intended to counterbalance his own fervour and impetuousness. He had been surprised to learn that he was chosen to take part in the mission, and expressed the fear that he lacked constitutional courage. The members of the mission were instructed to avoid the company of boys and women and to avoid giving the impression of being legacy hunters. Before embarking, the members of the mission were embarrassed to receive news of a landing by papal-sponsored forces in the Irish province of Munster in support of the Irish rebel James Fitzmaurice Fitzgerald. They also learned that a letter detailing their party and mission had been intercepted and that they were expected in England.
 Campion finally entered England in the guise of a jewel merchant, arriving in London on 24 June 1580, and at once began to preach. His presence soon became known to the authorities and to his fellow Catholics lying in London&#x27;s prisons. Among the latter was Thomas Pounde in the Marshalsea, where a meeting was held to discuss means of counteracting rumours circulated by the Privy Council to the effect that Campion&#x27;s mission was political and treasonous. Pounde rode in haste after Campion and explained the need for Campion to write a brief declaration of the true causes of his coming. The diffusion of this declaration, known as the &quot;Challenge to the Privy Council&quot;, or, &quot;Campion&#x27;s Brag&quot;, made his position more difficult. He led a hunted life, administering the sacraments and preaching to Catholics in Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Northamptonshire, and Lancashire.

During this time he wrote his &quot;Decem Rationes&quot; (&quot;Ten Reasons&quot;), arguments against the validity of the Anglican Church. This pamphlet, in Latin, was printed in a clandestine press at Stonor Park, Henley, and 400 copies were found on the benches of St Mary&#x27;s, Oxford, at the Commencement, on 27 June 1581. It caused great sensation, and the hunt for Campion was stepped up. On his way to Norfolk, he stopped at Lyford Grange, the house of Francis Yate, then in Berkshire, where he preached on 14 July and the following day, by popular request. Here, he was captured by a spy named George Eliot and taken to London with his arms pinioned and bearing on his hat a paper with the inscription &quot;&quot;Campion, the Seditious Jesuit&quot;.&quot;

==Imprisonment, torture and disputations==
Imprisoned for four days in the Tower of London in a tiny cell called &quot;Little Ease&quot;, Campion was then taken out and questioned by three Privy Councillors—Lord Chancellor Sir Thomas Bromley, Vice-Chamberlain of the Royal Household Sir Christopher Hatton and Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester—on matters including whether he acknowledged Queen Elizabeth to be the true Queen of England. He replied that he did, and was offered his freedom, wealth and honours, including the Archbishopric of Canterbury, which he could not accept in good conscience.

Campion was imprisoned in the Tower more than four months and tortured on the rack two or three times. False reports of a retraction and of a confession by Campion were circulated. He had four public disputations with his Anglican adversaries, on 1, 18, 23 and 27 September 1581, at which they attempted to address the challenges of Campion&#x27;s &quot;Challenge to the Privy Council&quot; and &quot;Decem Rationes&quot;. Although still suffering from the effects of his torture, and allowed neither time nor books for preparation, he reportedly conducted himself so easily and readily that &quot;even the spectators in the court looked for an acquittal&quot;.

He was arraigned and indicted on 14 November 1581 with several others at Westminster on a charge of having conspired, in Rome and Reims, to raise a sedition in the realm and dethrone the Queen.

==Trial, sentence and execution==
The trial was held on 20 November 1581. After hearing the pleadings for three hours, the jury deliberated an hour before delivering its verdict: Campion and his fellow defendants were found guilty of treason. He answered the verdict: 
Lord Chief Justice Wray read the sentence: &quot;You must go to the place from whence you came, there to remain until ye shall be drawn through the open city of London upon hurdles to the place of execution, and there be hanged and let down alive, and your privy parts cut off, and your entrails taken out and burnt in your sight; then your heads to be cut off and your bodies divided into four parts, to be disposed of at Her Majesty’s pleasure. And God have mercy on your souls.&quot;

On hearing the death sentence, Campion and the other condemned men broke into the words of the &quot;Te Deum&quot;. After spending his last days in prayer he was dragged with two fellow priests, Ralph Sherwin and Alexander Briant, to Tyburn where the three were hanged, drawn and quartered on 1 December 1581. Campion was 41 years of age.

==Veneration and feast day==
Edmund Campion was beatified by Pope Leo XIII on 9 December 1886. Edmund Campion was canonised nearly eighty-four years later in 1970 by Pope Paul VI as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales. His feast day is celebrated on 1 December, the day of his martyrdom.

The actual ropes used in his execution are now kept in glass display tubes at Stonyhurst College in Lancashire; each year they are placed on the altar of St Peter&#x27;s Church for Mass to celebrate Campion&#x27;s feast day—which is always a holiday for the school.

<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1973 with the song &quot;Power to All Our Friends&quot;, written by Guy Fletcher and Doug Flett, and performed by Cliff Richard. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final, after having previously selected the performer internally. Richard had previously represented the .

==Before Eurovision==
=== &quot;A Song for Europe 1973&quot; ===
The show was held on 24 February 1973 and presented by Cilla Black as part of her BBC1 series &quot;Cilla&quot;. Cliff Richard performed all of the six finalists in the final, where the performances were then immediately repeated. He had previously performed one of the songs weekly in the run up to the final. Richard had been permitted to choose two songs for the shortlist of 12 entries, from which a panel including his manager and producer selected the final six. Viewers cast votes by postcards through the mail to choose the winning song and &quot;Power to All Our Friends&quot; was the winner with 125,505 votes, very nearly four times the score of the runner-up &quot;Come Back Billie-Jo&quot; which polled 34,209.
=== Chart success ===
Both of the Top 2 songs were released as the A &amp; B-Sides of a single, which reached No.4 in the UK singles chart, Cliff&#x27;s first top 5 hit since &quot;Congratulations&quot; in 1968 and his last until 1979. For the first and only time in the history of the contest, all the entries from the UK final reached the UK singles chart. Following the release of the top two songs, the remaining four were issued as an extended play &quot;Eurovision Special&quot; single, which reached No.29 in the charts later in the year. The lead track, &quot;Help It Along&quot; was later released as the title track of Cliff&#x27;s 1974 live album of Christian gospel music. All six songs were eventually made available on CD compilations. Richard recorded German, Spanish and French versions of the winning song. Eurovision Song Contest 1971 winner Séverine reached No.46 in the French singles chart with her French-language version of the song, &quot;Il faut chanter la vie&quot;.

== At Eurovision ==
&quot;Power to All Our Friends&quot; placed 3rd in the Eurovision Song Contest. The 1973 contest became the most watched Eurovision Song Contest in the UK, with 23.54 million watching Cliff Richard perform in , almost 1 million more viewers than the record set in 1972. For the second year running, the contest was the No.1 rated TV show for the entire year in the UK.

This was also the first Eurovision Song Contest where Terry Wogan provided the BBC television commentary, having previously provided the BBC radio commentary for the . Pete Murray returned for the fourth time to provide the radio commentary for BBC Radio 1 and 2 listeners.

Each participating broadcaster appointed two jury members, one below the age of 25 and the other above, who voted by giving between one and five points to each song, except that representing their own country. All jury members were colocated in a television studio in Luxembourg. The jury members from the United Kingdom were Catherine Woodfield and Pat Williams.

<doc id="298343" wikidata="Q4354047" url="?curid=298343" title="Svinhufvud (family)">
<text>The Svinhufvud family (; ; ; ) is an ancient Swedish nobility originating from Dalarna. The family is incorporated both at the Swedish House of Nobility and the Finnish House of Nobility.

A prominent member is P. E. Svinhufvud, President of Finland from 1931 to 1937. Prince Daniel, Duke of Västergötland (né Daniel Westling), the husband of Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, shares ancestors very far back in time with this family.

==History==
The origin of the family can be traced back to a parchment letter from 1386 when a Jöns Swinshwoth (ie Svinshuvud) bought the two farms Höjen and Stenbjörnsarvet (now Stämnarvet ) in Torsångs parish (now Stora Kopparbergs parish) . The text has been partially changed, possibly in connection with the fact that the letter was displayed at the Autumn Parliament in Sundborn in 1673 by, among others, the mountain man Olof Nilsson on Höjen . Investigations of the document indicate, however, that Svinhuvud was there from the beginning.

The miner at Kopparberget, Hans Jönsson (mentioned 1430–1440), like his brother Dan Jönsson, vicar of Hedemora parish 1405–1427, carried a pig&#x27;s head in his coat of arms.

Hans Jönsson, who was married to Ingeborg Larsdotter, daughter of the subaltern in Västmanland Lars Korske and his wife Cecilia Birgersdotter, was the father of Jöns Hansson, miner at Kopparberget in 1450 and, according to a later statement from Rasmus Ludvigsson, lived at Höjen . Another son was Jeppe Hansson, mentioned 1452-1481, who signed up for Risholn (then in Svärdsjö, later Sundborn parish ). From his son Hans Jeppesson in Risholn (mentioned 1485–1513, died before 1540) and his daughter Margareta Hansdotter, Svinhufvud in Westergötland traces its ancestry . Hans Jeppesson&#x27;s son, Dala bailiff Ingel Hansson, settled at Gylle in Stora Tuna parishand was executed in 1534 for his participation in the Bell Rebellion . His son Nils Ingelsson (died no earlier than 1600) was mayor of Västerås 1575–1595 and from him, through a grandson&#x27;s son, the Ikornsköld family (extinct at the sword&#x27;s end 1644) that was introduced to the house of knights is descended from him .

Hans Jönsson&#x27;s daughter Cecilia, mentioned in 1450, was married to Magnus Henriksson Svart. Their son, the mountain bailiff at Kopparberget Nils Månsson, in turn became the father of Måns Nilsson (Svinhufvud) . From his granddaughter Per Hansson descends the noble family Svinhufvud af Qvalstad . Per Hansson&#x27;s brother, the district chief Albrekt Hansson (died 1631) in Aspeboda has left behind a large number of descendants in Dalarna and neighboring regions .

Gudlög Hansdotter, mentioned in 1452, daughter of the miner Hans Jönsson above, became, through her marriage to Jeppe Henriksson (Simla) in Karlborn, Svärdsjö parish, petitioner to the noble and countable families Ekeblad (Stola family) .

The miner Hans Jönsson was the father of the miner Jöns Hansson (mentioned 1450–1452) who in turn was the father of the priests Daniel and Timme Jönsson, who when they were enrolled at the University of Rostock in 1465 and 1466 were the first to use the surname Svinhufvud with certainty. Their nephew, Västerås bishop Otto Svinhufvud, also took up the name when he enrolled at the University of Rostock in 1480.

<text>John Lyly (; also spelled &quot;Lilly&quot;, &quot;Lylie&quot;, &quot;Lylly&quot;; born c. 1553–4 – buried 30 November 1606) was an English writer, playwright, courtier, and parliamentarian. He first achieved success with his two books &quot;Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit&quot; (1578) and its sequel &quot;Euphues and His England&quot; (1580), and then became a dramatist, writing eight plays which survive, at least six of which were performed before Queen Elizabeth I. Lyly&#x27;s distinctive and much imitated literary style, named after the title character of his two books, is known as &quot;euphuism&quot;. He is sometimes grouped with other professional dramatists of the 1580s and 1590s like Christopher Marlowe, Robert Greene, Thomas Nashe, George Peele, and Thomas Lodge, as one of the so-called University Wits. He has been credited by some scholars with writing the first English novel, and as being &#x27;the father of English comedy&#x27;.

==Biography==
===Childhood and education===
John Lyly was born in Kent, England, c. 1553–4, the eldest son of Peter Lyly and his wife, Jane Burgh (or Brough), of Burgh Hall in the North Riding of Yorkshire. He was probably born either in Rochester, where his father is recorded as a notary public in 1550, or in Canterbury, where his father was the for the Archbishop, Matthew Parker, and where the births of his siblings are recorded between 1562 and 1568. His grandfather was William Lily, the grammarian and the first High (or Head) Master of St Paul&#x27;s School, London. His uncle, George Lily, was a scholar and cartographer, and served as domestic chaplain to Reginald Pole, Archbishop of Canterbury.

Lyly was probably educated at King&#x27;s School, Canterbury, where his younger brothers are recorded as contemporaries of Christopher Marlowe. He was about 15 years old when, in October 1569, his father died. Peter&#x27;s will made his wife Jane and his son John his joint executors and named &quot;my dwelling house... called the Splayed Eagle&quot;, close by Canterbury Cathedral on either Sun Street or Palace Street. They sold the house fourteen months later, in Jan 1571.

In 1571, at the age of 16, Lyly became a student at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he is recorded as having received his bachelor&#x27;s degree on 27 April 1573, and his master&#x27;s two years later on 19 May, 1575. In his address &quot;To my very good friends the gentlemen scholars of Oxford&quot; at the end of the second edition of his &quot;Anatomy of Wit&quot;, he complains about a sentence of rustication apparently passed on him at some time during his university career, but nothing more is known about either its date or its cause. According to Anthony Wood, while Lyly had the reputation of &quot;a noted wit&quot;, he never took kindly to the proper studies of the university:

While at Oxford, Lyly wrote to William Cecil, Lord Burghley, on 16 May 1574, to seek his assistance in applying for the Queen&#x27;s letters to admit him as fellow at Magdalen College. Although the fellowship was not granted, later letters to Burghley show that their connection continued after he left university. In the &quot;Glasse for Europe&quot;, in the second part of &quot;Euphues&quot; (1580), Lyly described how grateful he felt towards him:

===Writer and dramatist===
At some point after university Lyly moved to London, finding lodgings at the fashionable residence of the Savoy Hospital on the Strand, where Gabriel Harvey described him as &quot;a dapper &amp; a deft companion&quot; and &quot;a pert-conceited youth.&quot; Here he began his literary career, writing his first book &quot;Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit&quot;. It was licensed to Gabriel Cawood on 2nd December 1578 and printed that year with a dedication to William West, 1st Baron De La Warr, and a second expanded edition immediately followed in 1579. In the same year Lyly was incorporated M.A. at the University of Cambridge. &quot;The Anatomy of Wit&quot; was an instant success, and Lyly quickly followed it with a sequel, &quot;Euphues and his England&quot;, licensed to Cawood on 24 July, and published in 1580. Like the first, it won immediate popularity. Between them, the two works went through over thirty editions by 1630. As Leah Scragg, their most recent editor, describes them, they would &quot;prove the literary sensation of the age&quot;.

For a time Lyly was the most successful and fashionable of English writers, hailed as the author of &quot;a new English&quot;, as a &quot;raffineur de l&#x27;Anglois&quot;; and, as Edward Blount, one of the publishers of his plays, wrote in 1632, &quot;that beautie in court which could not parley Euphuism was as little regarded as she which nowe there speakes not French&quot;. Lyly&#x27;s prose style was much imitated, for example by Barnabe Rich in his &quot;Second Tome of the Travels and Adventures of Don Simonides&quot;, 1584; by Robert Greene in his &quot;Menaphon, Camilla&#x27;s Alarum to Slumbering Euphues&quot;, 1589; and by Thomas Lodge in his &quot;Rosalynde, Euphues Golden Legacie&quot;, 1590, the source text for &quot;As You Like It&quot;.

Lyly dedicated his second &quot;Euphues&quot; novel to Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, who seems to have acted as patron to most of Lyly&#x27;s literary associates when they left Oxford for London, and it is about this time that Lyly became his private secretary. De Vere was Burghley&#x27;s son-in-law, and two years later a letter from Lyly to Burghley, dated July 1582, protests against an accusation of dishonesty which had brought him into trouble with the Earl, and requests a personal interview in order to clear his name. In the same year, he contributed an introductory epistle, &quot;John Lyly to the Author his friend&quot;, to Thomas Watson&#x27;s collection of poems &quot;Hekatompathia, or passionate Centurie of Love&quot;, also published by Cawood, and which Watson also dedicated to de Vere. 

In 1583, de Vere secured him the lease of the first Blackfriars Playhouse, where Lyly&#x27;s first two plays, &quot;Campaspe&quot; and &quot;Sapho and Phao&quot; were performed by the joint company of the Children of the Chapel and the Children of Paul&#x27;s known as Oxford&#x27;s Boys, before their performances at Court in the presence of the Queen at Whitehall Palace. &quot;Campaspe&quot; was performed there during the Christmas festivities 1583–84, on &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day at Night&quot;, and &quot;Sapho&quot; during the pre-Lent festivities on the evening of Shrove Tuesday, 3 March 1584. A warrant issued on 12 March ordered that Lyly be paid a total of £20 for the two performances, although it took until 25 November until he finally received the money. In the meantime, Lyly lost control of the theatre around Easter when Sir William More reclaimed the lease, closing it down, and in June, Lyly was briefly jailed in the Fleet Prison for a debt of £9 8s 8d owed to Nicholas Bremers. Patent Rolls show he was quickly released, &quot;for pity&#x27;s sake&quot;, on 10 June, by the intervention the Queen herself.

A letter written on 30 Oct, 1584 from Oxford to Burghley shows that Lyly was still in de Vere&#x27;s service, and that Lyly was awkwardly positioned in his loyalty to both men, saying &quot;you sent for Amis my man, and yf he wear absent, that Lylle should come unto yow... I mean not to be yowre ward nor yowre chyld ... and scorne to be offered that injurie, to think I am so weak of government as to be ruled by servants&quot;. On 24 November Oxford transferred the rental rights of the manor of Bentfield Bury and a nearby wood, both in Stansted Mountfitchet, Essex, to Lyly worth £30 13s 4d a year. Just over a year later, on 3 March 1586, the property&#x27;s tenants then bought out the rental rights from him for the lump sum of £250.
In 1587, Lyly revived his theatrical career, writing for the Children of Paul&#x27;s at their playhouse adjacent to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, where his plays would be publicly staged first before their subsequent performance at court. &quot;Gallathea&quot; was likely performed at Greenwich Palace on &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day at Night&quot; as part of the 1587/88 Christmas revels there, with &quot;Endymion&quot; following suit at Candlemas on 2nd February, 1588. Paul&#x27;s Boys performed on three dates during the 1589/90 Christmas season at Richmond Palace, on Sunday after Christmas Day, New Year&#x27;s Day, and Twelfth Day, according to the Council Registers records of payment made for them. The last of these three, 6 Jan 1590, must have been the occasion for &quot;Midas&quot; since its title page states it was &quot;played... upon Twelfth Day at Night&quot;, and this was the only time the company is recorded playing that date. Both &quot;Mother Bombie&quot; and &quot;Love&#x27;s Metamorphosis&quot; must also date from this period 1588–91, each with title pages stating their performance by Paul&#x27;s Boys, although neither mentions performance before the Queen. After the closure of Paul&#x27;s Playhouse sometime 1590–91, the latter was subsequently revived for performance at the second Blackfriars Theatre in 1600–01, this time, as its title page states, by the Children of the Chapel. An eighth play by Lyly, &quot;The Woman in the Moon&quot;, his only play in verse and first published in 1597, also declares its royal performance but is the only one that does not state the name of the company who performed it. In total, at least six of Lyly&#x27;s eight known surviving plays were performed before the Queen.

In 1589, Lyly published a tract in the Martin Marprelate controversy, called &quot;Pappe with an hatchet, alias a figge for my Godsonne; Or Crack me this nut; Or a Countrie Cuffe, etc.&quot; Though published anonymously, the evidence for his authorship of the tract may be found in Gabriel Harvey&#x27;s &quot;Pierce&#x27;s Supererogation&quot; (written November 1589, published 1593), in Thomas Nashe&#x27;s &quot;Have with You to Saffron-Walden&quot; (1596), and in various allusions in Lyly&#x27;s own plays.

===Parliamentarian and courtier===
Lyly sat as an MP in Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s last four Parliaments, for Hindon in Wiltshire in 1589, for Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire twice, in 1593 and 1601, and for Appleby in Westmorland in 1597–98 when he also served on a parliamentary committee about wine casks.

In 1594, Lyly was made an honorary member of Gray&#x27;s Inn in order to attend the lawyers&#x27; Christmas Revels, during which, on 28 December, Shakespeare&#x27;s company famously performed their &quot;Comedy of Errors&quot;. In 1597, Lyly contributed commendatory verses in Latin to Henry Lok&#x27;s verse translation of the book of &quot;Ecclesiastes&quot;, which Lok dedicated to the Queen.

In addition to plays, Lyly also composed at least one &quot;entertainment&quot; (a show that combined elements of masque and drama) performed for Queen Elizabeth during her various Progresses through the country; &quot;The Entertainment at Chiswick&quot; was staged on 28 and 29 July 1602 at the house of Sir William Russell. Lyly has been suggested as the author of several other royal entertainments of the 1590s, most notably &quot;The Entertainment at Mitcham&quot; performed on 13 September 1598 at the house of Sir Julius Caesar.

Two petitions by Lyly to Queen Elizabeth show that he entered her service at some time in the late 1580s, with hopes of becoming her Master of the Revels, hopes that eventually ended in disappointment. In the first petition he says that:

In the second petition, dated 1601, Lyly complains:

The originals of the two petitions do not survive, but, whatever their success with Elizabeth, after Lyly&#x27;s death the pair enjoyed the most extensive circulation in manuscript of any Elizabethan-Jacobean dramatist. Forty-six copies of the two letters in post-1620 manuscript miscellanies, anthologies of state correspondence, and letter-manuals, can currently be recorded.

A third, now lost, petition is mentioned in a letter to Sir Robert Cecil, Elizabeth&#x27;s Principal Secretary, dated 4 Feb 1602, where Lyly tells him that:

What he did in fact receive, if anything, as a result of this third petition is unknown. At Elizabeth&#x27;s death a year later in March 1603, Lyly was granted seven yards of black cloth for her funeral, and his servants four yards.

Lyly died of unknown causes in 1606, in the early part of the reign of James I, and was buried on 30 November in the church of St Bartholomew-the-Less in London. He was married to Beatrice Browne of Yorkshire, and they had at least four sons and five daughters.

The proverb &quot;All is fair in love and war&quot; has been attributed to Lyly&#x27;s &quot;Euphues&quot;.

==Plays==
Although the two volumes of &quot;Euphues&quot; were Lyly&#x27;s most popular and influential works in the Elizabethan period, it is his plays which are now admired most, for their flexible use of dramatic prose and the elegant patterning of their construction.

Eight of Lyly&#x27;s plays survive in quarto, published during his lifetime in fourteen separate editions, all but the last written in prose:

* &quot;Campaspe&quot; performed 1583/84 (printed 1584 three times, &amp; 1591)
* &quot;Sapho and Phao&quot; performed 1584 (printed 1584 twice, &amp; 1591)
* &quot;Gallathea&quot; performed 1587/88 (printed 1592)
* &quot;Endymion, the Man in the Moon&quot; performed 1588 (printed 1591)
* &quot;Midas&quot; performed 1589/90 (printed 1592)
* &quot;Mother Bombie&quot; performed c. 1590 (printed 1594, &amp; 1598)
* &quot;Love&#x27;s Metamorphosis&quot; performed c. 1589/90, revived 1600/01 (printed 1601)
* &quot;The Woman in the Moon&quot; probably performed 1590–95 (printed 1597)

While &quot;A Warning for Fair Women&quot; (1599) and &quot;The Maid&#x27;s Metamorphosis&quot; (1600) have been attributed to Lyly in the past, these attributions have not gained any serious acceptance.

&quot;Six Court Comedies,&quot; the first printed collection of Lyly&#x27;s plays, was published in duodecimo format by Edward Blount in 1632, the same year that he published the Second Folio of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. They appear in the volume in the following order: &quot;Endymion&quot;, &quot;Campaspe&quot;, &quot;Sapho and Phao&quot;, &quot;Gallathea&quot;, &quot;Midas&quot; and &quot;Mother Bombie&quot;, all first printed 1584–94. The last two of his plays to be published, &quot;The Woman in the Moon&quot; and &quot;Love&#x27;s Metamorphosis&quot;, printed in 1597 &amp; 1601 respectively, were omitted. The collection printed the songs in &quot;Campaspe&quot; and &quot;Gallathea&quot; for the first time.

In his introduction to the plays, &#x27;To the Reader&#x27;, Blount explained his motivation for publication:

He ended his address with:

Blount dedicated the collection to Richard, 1st Viscount Lumley of Waterford, writing:

Francis Meres placed &quot;eloquent and witty John Lyly&quot; alongside Shakespeare in his list of &quot;the best for comedy amongst us&quot; when describing the playwrights of his day in his &quot;Palladis Tamia, or Wits Treasury&quot;, printed in 1598. Ben Jonson, in his poem &quot;To the Memory of My Beloved, the Author, Mr William Shakespeare&quot; printed in the 1623 First Folio, praised Lyly by listing him as one of the best playwrights whom Shakespeare surpassed: &quot;How far thou didst our Lyly outshine, Or sporting Kyd, or Marlowe&#x27;s mighty line&quot;. 

Lyly&#x27;s importance as a dramatist has been very differently estimated, but his dialogue was a great advance in anything that had gone before it, and his nimbleness and wit represents an important step in English dramatic art. Shakespeare&#x27;s comedies &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, &quot;As You Like It&quot; and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; are all seen to have drawn influence from Lyly&#x27;s work.

* &quot;John Lyly and early modern authorship&quot; (Andy Kesson, 2014; e-book 2015; paperback 2016)

A collection of twenty four essays on Lyly, written between 1956 and 2005, has been published in a single volume dedicated to him, edited by Ruth Lunney, in &quot;The University Wits&quot; series, published by Ashgate in 2011.

The standard modern book-length biography remains G. K. Hunter&#x27;s &quot;John Lyly: The Humanist as Courtier&quot; (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, &amp; Harvard University Press, 1962). Full transcriptions of most of the documentary evidence concerning Lyly&#x27;s life were printed in Albert Feuillerat&#x27;s &quot;John Lyly: Contribution a l&#x27;Histoire de la Renaissance en Angleterre&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 1910).

<doc id="298349" wikidata="Q1660989" url="?curid=298349" title="Incompatible Timesharing System">
<text>Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS) is a time-sharing operating system developed principally by the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, with help from Project MAC. The name is the jocular complement of the MIT Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS).

ITS, and the software developed on it, were technically and culturally influential far beyond their core user community. Remote &quot;guest&quot; or &quot;tourist&quot; access was easily available via the early ARPANET, allowing many interested parties to informally try out features of the operating system and application programs. The wide-open ITS philosophy and collaborative online community were a major influence on the hacker culture, as described in Steven Levy&#x27;s book &quot;&quot;, and were the direct forerunners of the free and open-source software (FOSS), open-design, and Wiki movements.

==History==
ITS development was initiated in the late 1960s by those (the majority of the MIT AI Lab staff at that time) who disagreed with the direction taken by Project MAC&#x27;s Multics project (which had started in the mid-1960s), particularly such decisions as the inclusion of powerful system security. The name was chosen by Tom Knight as a joke on the name of the earliest MIT time-sharing operating system, the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS), which dated from the early 1960s.

By simplifying their system compared to Multics, ITS&#x27;s authors were able to quickly produce a functional operating system for their lab. ITS was written in assembly language, originally for the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-6 computer, but the majority of ITS development and use was on the newer, largely upwards-compatible, PDP-10.

Although not used as intensively after about 1986, ITS continued to operate on original hardware at MIT until 1990, and then until 1995 at in Sweden. Today, some ITS implementations continue to be remotely accessible, via emulation of PDP-10 hardware running on modern, low-cost computers supported by interested hackers.

==Significant technical features==
ITS introduced many then-new features:
* The first device-independent graphics terminal output; programs generated generic commands to control screen content, which the system automatically translated into the appropriate character sequences for the particular type of terminal operated by the user.
* A general mechanism for implementing virtual devices in software running in user processes (which were called &quot;jobs&quot; in ITS).
* Using the virtual-device mechanism, ITS provided transparent inter-machine filesystem access. The ITS machines were all connected to the ARPAnet, and a user on one machine could perform the same operations with files on other ITS machines as if they were local files.
* Sophisticated process management; user processes were organized in a tree, and a superior process could control a large number of inferior processes. Any inferior process could be frozen at any point in its operation, and its state (including contents of the registers) examined; the process could then be resumed transparently.
* An advanced software interrupt facility that allowed user processes to operate asynchronously, using complex interrupt handling mechanisms.
* PCLSRing, a mechanism providing what appeared (to user processes) to be quasi-atomic, safely-interruptible system calls. No process could ever observe any process (including itself) in the middle of executing any system call.
* In support of the AI Lab&#x27;s robotics work, ITS also supported simultaneous real-time and time-sharing operation.

==User environment==
The environment seen by ITS users was philosophically significantly different from that provided by most operating systems at the time.
* Initially there were no passwords, and a user could work on ITS without logging on. Logging on was considered polite, though, so other people knew when one was active on the system.
* To deal with a rash of incidents where users sought out flaws in the system in order to crash it, a novel approach was taken. A command which could be run by anyone would cause the system to crash, taking away the challenge and notoriety of doing so. It first also broadcast a message to say who was initiating the crash.
* All files were editable by all users, including online documentation and source code. A series of informal papers and technical notes documented new commands, technical issues, primitive games, mathematical puzzles, and other topics of interest to the ITS hacker community. Some were issued as more formal AI Memos, including the iconic HAKMEM compendium.
* All users could talk with instant messaging on another&#x27;s terminal, or they could use a command (SHOUT) to ask all active users for help.
* Users could see what was happening on another&#x27;s terminal (using a command called OS for &quot;output spy&quot;). A target of OS could detect and kill it using another command called JEDGAR, named after FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. This facility was later disabled with a placebo command: it appeared as if the remote session was killed, but it was not.
* Tourists (guest users either at MIT AI Lab terminals, or over the ARPAnet) were tolerated and occasionally invited to actively join the ITS community. Informal policy on tourist access was later formalized in a written policy. Ease of access, with or without a guest account, allowed interested parties to informally explore and experiment with the operating system, application programs, and hacker culture. Working copies of documentation and source code could be freely consulted or updated by anybody on the system.
* System security, to the extent that it existed, was mostly-based on de facto &quot;security by obscurity&quot;. Guest hackers willing to dedicate significant time and effort to learning ITS were expected to behave respectfully, and to avoid interfering with the research projects which funded the hardware and software systems. There was little of exclusive value on the ITS systems except information, much of which would eventually be published for free distribution, and open and free sharing of knowledge was generally encouraged.

The wide-open ITS philosophy and collaborative community were the direct forerunner of the free and open-source software (FOSS), open-design, and Wiki movements.

==Important applications developed on ITS==
The EMACS (&quot;Editor MACroS&quot;) editor was originally written on ITS. In its ITS instantiation it was a collection of TECO programs (called &quot;macros&quot;). On later operating systems, it was written in the common language of those systems – for example, the C language under Unix, and Zetalisp under the Lisp Machine system.

GNU‘s info help system was originally an EMACS subsystem, and then was later written as a complete standalone system for Unix-like machines.

Several important programming languages and systems were developed on ITS, including MacLisp (the precursor of Zetalisp and Common Lisp), Microplanner (implemented in MacLisp), MDL (which became the basis of Infocom&#x27;s programming environment), and Scheme.

Among other significant and influential software subsystems developed on ITS, the Macsyma symbolic algebra system, started in 1968, was the first widely-known mathematical computing environment. It was a forerunner of Maxima, MATLAB, Wolfram Mathematica, and many other computer algebra systems.

Terry Winograd&#x27;s natural-language interpreter SHRDLU was developed on ITS. The computer game &quot;Zork&quot; was also originally written on ITS.

Richard Greenblatt&#x27;s Mac Hack VI was the top-rated chess program for years and was the first to display a graphical board representation.

==Miscellaneous==
The default ITS top-level command interpreter was the PDP-10 machine language debugger (DDT). The usual text editor on ITS was TECO and later Emacs, which was written in TECO. Both DDT and TECO were implemented through simple dispatch tables on single-letter commands, and thus had no true syntax. The ITS task manager was called PEEK.

The local spelling &quot;TURIST&quot; is an artifact of six-character filename (and other identifier) limitations, which is traceable to six SIXBIT encoded characters fitting into a single 36-bit PDP-10 word. &quot;TURIST&quot; may also have been a pun on Alan Turing, a pioneer of theoretical computer science. The less-complimentary term &quot;LUSER&quot; was also applied to guest users, especially those who repeatedly engaged in clueless or vandalous behavior.

The Jargon File started as a combined effort between people on the ITS machines at MIT and at Stanford University SAIL. The document described much of the terminology, puns, and culture of the two AI Labs and related research groups, and is the direct predecessor of the &quot;Hacker&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; (1983), the first compendium of hacker jargon to be issued by a major publisher (MIT Press).

Different implementations of ITS supported an odd array of peripherals, including an automatic wire stripper devised by hacker Richard Greenblatt, who needed a supply of pre-stripped jumper wires of various lengths for wire-wrapping computer hardware he and others were prototyping. The device used a stepper motor and a formerly hand-held wire stripper tool and cutter, operated by solenoid, all under computer control from ITS software. The device was accessible by any ITS user, but was disappointingly unreliable in actual use.

The Xerox Graphics Printer (XGP), one of the first laser printers, was supported by ITS by 1974. The MIT AI Lab had one of these prototype continuous roll-fed printers for experimentation and use by its staff. By 1982, the XGP was supplemented by a Xerox Dover printer, an early sheet-fed laser printer. Although any ITS user could send files to the laser printers, physical access to pick up printouts was limited to staff and others who obtained access to the MIT lab, to control usage of printer supplies which had to be specially ordered.

CTSS and ITS file systems have a number of design elements in common. Both have an M.F.D. (master file directory) and one or more U.F.D. (user file directories). Neither of them have nested directories (sub-directories) Both have file names consisting of two names which are a maximum of six-characters long. Both support linked files.

<text>Antonio de Guevara (c. 1481 – 3 April 1545) was a Spanish bishop and author. In 1527, he was named royal chronicler to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. His first book &quot;Libro áureo&quot; first appeared in pirated editions the following year. This pseudo-historical book of incidents and letters from the life of Marcus Aurelius (known in a later expanded edition as &quot;Relox des principes&quot;) was translated into nearly every language of Europe, including Russian, Swedish, Hungarian, Polish, Armenian, and Romanian. The popularity of Guevara&#x27;s book led scholar and translator Méric Casaubon to remark that no book besides the Bible was so often translated as Guevara&#x27;s &quot;Relox de principes&quot;, or &quot;Dial of Princes&quot;. Besides his book of Marcus Aurelius, Guevara wrote eight other books, some of which continued to be translated and republished in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

==Biography==

Born in Treceño in the province of Cantabria, he spent some of his youth at the court of Isabella I of Castile. In 1505 he entered the Franciscan order. He successively held the offices of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor&#x27;s court preacher, court historiographer, Bishop of Guadix, Bishop of Mondoñedo and counselor to Charles V. He travelled in the royal entourage during Charles V&#x27;s journeys to Italy and other parts of Europe. His most well-known work, entitled &quot;The Dial of Princes&quot; (&quot;Reloj de príncipes&quot; in its original Spanish), was published at Valladolid in 1529, and, according to its author, the fruit of eleven years&#x27; labour, is a mirror for princes in the form of a didactic novel, designed after the manner of Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Cyropaedia&quot;, to delineate in a somewhat ideal way, for the benefit of modern sovereigns, the life, and character of an ancient prince, Marcus Aurelius, distinguished for wisdom and virtue. It was often reprinted in Spanish; it so speedily attained fame that before the close of the century, there were published several translations in Latin, Italian, French, German, Dutch and English. The two earliest English translations are by Lord Berners (London, 1534) and later by Thomas North. This book appeared in an earlier form in 1528 in pirated editions as Libro Aureo. The pseudo-historical nature of the book gave rise to a literary controversy, the author having claimed in his prologue that the book was drawn from an imaginary manuscript in a library belonging to the Medicis in Florence.

Other works of Guevara include the four works published in a single volume in Valladolid in 1539: &quot;Década de los Césares&quot;, or &quot;Lives of the Ten Roman Emperors&quot; in imitation of the manner of Plutarch and Suetonius; the &quot;Epístolas familiares&quot;, or &quot;The Familiar Epistles&quot;; &quot;Libro de los inventores del arte de marear&quot;, on the art of navigation; and &quot;Aviso de privados y doctrina de cortesanos&quot;. In this last-mentioned work, known in the English translation of Edward Hellowes as &quot;The Favored Courtier&quot;, Guevara anatomized the concept of the courtier and, thus, the society of the royal court. Guevara, who most certainly had read &quot;Il Cortegiano&quot; (1518) by Baldassare Castiglione—whom Charles V called the greatest courtier of his age—brought a different aspect to the figure of the courtier: while the latter&#x27;s work was a &#x27;behavioral&#x27; guide, Guevara described the practical aspects of men surrounding a monarch and differentiated their duties from those who were part of religious orders in a famous passage in Chapter 1:

&quot;En la Religión si se levanta a media noche, es por loar al Señor en el culto Divino; mas en la Corte infinitas veces trasnochan, no por más de cumplir con el mundo.&quot;

&quot;As far as religion is concerned, if one wakes up in the middle of night, it is to laud the Lord in the Divine worship. But at the court, they stay awake all night infinite times, for no other reason than to keep up with the world.&quot;
Besides the controversy mentioned above, there was another regarding the two chapters on the Danubian Farmer, which appeared in different versions both in the &quot;Libro áureo&quot; and the &quot;Reloj de príncipes&quot; in which it has been argued the Farmer is a metaphor for the New World Indigenous peoples and the Roman Empire is nothing less than the Spanish Empire.

Guevara died in Mondoñedo. He was the cousin of Diego de Guevara.

==Criticism and legacy==
Critical attitudes toward Guevara&#x27;s literary works may be roughly grouped into three phases: first, a period of great popularity throughout Europe peaking in the mid- to late-sixteenth century; second, a period during which Guevara&#x27;s works were censured on stylistic grounds and using spurious citations and historical references, and consequently devalued; and, thirdly, in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, a rediscovery and more positive reassessment of his work.

The attitude of censure towards Guevara&#x27;s work first arose against the liberties he took in his pseudo-histories. Pedro de Rhúa, in his &quot;Cartas censorias&quot;, wrote three letters to Guevara expressing indignation that Guevara had written &#x27;fábulas por historias&#x27;. Pierre Bayle&#x27;s judgment in his &quot;Dictionary Historical and Critical&quot; is in many ways representative of a negative view of Guevara&#x27;s work prevailing during the late Renaissance and Enlightenment periods:

Guevara, (Antony de), preacher and historiographer to the emperor Charles V, was born in the province of Alaba in Spain. He was brought up at court; but after the death of queen Isabella of Castile, he turned a Franciscan friar, and very honourable employments in his order. Afterwards, having made himself known at court, he was made a preacher to Charles V, and was much esteemed for his politeness, eloquence, and great parts. He ought to have been contented with the glory he got by his tongue; for, pretending to write books, he made himself ridiculous to good judges. His high-flown and figurative style, full of antitheses, is not the greatest fault of his works. An ill taste, and a wrong notion of eloquence, put him upon such a way of writing; which was an inconsiderable thing, if compared with his extravagant way of handling history. He broke the most sacred and essential laws of it, with a boldness that cannot be sufficiently detested; and he shewed that no man was ever so unworthy of the character of Chronicler to Charles V, which was given him. He alleged a very bad excuse, when he was censured for it: he pretended, that, excepting the holy scripture, all other histories are too uncertain to be credited.

Bayle concludes his entry on Guevara by stating of &quot;The Dial of Princes&quot; that &quot;if the French are to blame for having highly valued such a book, the Spaniards who have esteemed it still more, deserve more to be laughed at&quot;.

In the twentieth century, scholarship on Guevara grew considerably. Book-length studies by Redondo, Ernest Grey, Joseph R. Jones, and Horacio Chiong Rivero have recounted Guevara&#x27;s harsh critical reception and made strong cases for his importance. Presently Guevara&#x27;s complete works are freely available in accurate HTML editions at Filosofia. The scholar and editor Emilio Blanco has edited works by and about Guevara and in 2018 delivered public lectures on the life and works of Guevara at the Fundación Juan March in Madrid.

<text>Frederick William Fairholt (1814 – 3 April 1866) was an English antiquary and wood-engraver.

==Early life==
Fairholt was born in London. His father, who was of a German family (the name was originally Fahrholz), was a tobacco manufacturer, and Frederick was at first employed in the business. He then worked as a drawing-master and later as a scene-painter. Pen and ink copies made by him of figures from William Hogarth&#x27;s plates led to his being employed by Charles Knight on several of his illustrated publications.

==Career==
Fairholt&#x27;s first published literary work was a contribution to &quot;Hone&#x27;s Year-Book&quot; in 1831. His life was one of almost uninterrupted quiet labour, carried on until within a few days of death. Several works on civic pageantry and some collections of ancient unpublished songs and dialogues were edited by him for the Percy Society in 1842. In 1844, he was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He published an edition of the dramatic works of John Lyly in 1858.

His principal works are &quot;Tobacco, its History and Association&quot; (1859); &quot;Gog and Magog&quot; (1860); &quot;Up the Nile and Home Again&quot; (1862); many articles and serials contributed to the &quot;Art Journal&quot;, some of which were afterwards separately published, as &quot;Costume in England&quot; (1846); and &quot;Dictionary of Terms in Art&quot; (1854). These works are illustrated by numerous cuts, drawn on the wood by his own hand. He also illustrated Evans&#x27;s &quot;Coins of the Ancient Britons&quot;, Frederic William Madden&#x27;s &quot;Jewish Coinage&quot;, Halliwell&#x27;s folio &quot;Shakespeare&quot; and his &quot;Sir John Maundeville&quot;, Charles Roach Smith&#x27;s &quot;Richborough&quot;, the &quot;Miscellanea Graphica&quot; of Lord Londesborough, and many other works.

==Later life==
Fairholt died in 1866 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

==Legacy==
His books relating to Shakespeare were bequeathed to the library at Stratford-on-Avon; those on civic pageantry (between 200 and 300 volumes) to the Society of Antiquaries; his old prints and works on costume to the British Museum; his general library he desired to be sold and the proceeds devoted to the Royal Literary Fund.

<text>The Sicilian Vespers (; ) was a successful rebellion on the island of Sicily that broke out at Easter 1282 against the rule of the French-born king Charles I of Anjou. Since taking control of the Kingdom of Sicily in 1266, the Angevin government had made itself unpopular with its exploitative policies and exclusion of native Sicilians from power.

Sparked by an incident in Palermo, the revolt quickly spread to the majority of Sicily. Within six weeks, approximately 13,000 French men and women were slain or expelled by the rebels, and the government of Charles lost control of the island. Seeking support for the rebellion, the Sicilians offered the throne to Peter III of Aragon, who claimed the crown on behalf of his wife, Constance of Sicily. The Aragonese intervention in the rebellion led to an expansion of the conflict into the War of the Sicilian Vespers.

== Background ==

=== The papacy versus the House of Hohenstaufen ===
The rising had its origin in the struggle of investiture between the pope and the Hohenstaufen Holy Roman Emperors for control of Italy, especially the Church&#x27;s private demesne known as the Papal States. These lay between Hohenstaufen lands in northern Italy and the Hohenstaufen Kingdom of Sicily in the south; the Hohenstaufens also, at the time, ruled Germany.

In 1245 Pope Innocent IV excommunicated Frederick II and declared him deposed, and roused opposition against him in Germany and Italy. When Frederick died in 1250, his dominion was inherited by his son, Conrad IV of Germany. A period of turmoil followed Conrad&#x27;s death in 1254, and the Kingdom of Sicily was seized by Manfred, King of Sicily, Frederick&#x27;s illegitimate son, who reigned from 1258 to 1266.

Manfred had no involvement in German politics, where the interregnum lasted longer and there was no emperor until 1274. He first styled himself as vicar of his nephew Conradin, Conrad&#x27;s son. However, following a false rumor that Conradin was dead, Manfred had himself crowned king. He wished for a reconciliation with the papacy, which may have explained his support for the landless Baldwin II, Latin Emperor. However, Pope Urban IV and later Pope Clement IV were not prepared to recognize Manfred as lawful ruler of Sicily and first excommunicated him, then sought to depose him by force of arms.

After abortive attempts to enlist England as the champion of the Papacy against Manfred, Urban IV settled on the later Charles I of Naples as his candidate for the Sicilian throne. Charles would invade Italy, and in 1266 defeated and killed Manfred at the Battle of Benevento, becoming King of Sicily. In 1268 Conradin, who had meanwhile come of age, invaded Italy to press his claim to the throne, but he was defeated at the Battle of Tagliacozzo and executed afterwards. Charles was now undisputed master of the Kingdom of Sicily.

=== Charles of Anjou and Sicilian unrest ===
Charles regarded his Sicilian territories as a springboard for his Mediterranean ambitions, which included the overthrow of Michael VIII Palaiologos of the Byzantine Empire and the capture of Constantinople. Constantinople was captured during the Fourth Crusade and had been brought into the fold of the Roman Catholic religion for 57 years under the rule of the Latin Empire. With the Byzantine recapture of the city in 1261, Michael VIII Palaiologos continued to rebuild what was left of the economically strategic city as an important trade route to Europe.

Unrest simmered in Sicily because of its very subordinate role in Charles&#x27; empire—its nobles had no share in the government of their own island and were not compensated by lucrative posts abroad, as were Charles&#x27; French, Provençal and Neapolitan subjects; also, Charles spent the heavy taxes he imposed on wars outside Sicily, making Sicily somewhat of a donor economy to Charles&#x27; nascent empire. As Steven Runciman put it, &quot;[The Sicilians] saw themselves now being ruled to enable an alien tyrant make conquests from which they would have no benefit&quot;.

The unrest was also fomented by Byzantine agents to thwart Charles&#x27; projected invasion and by King Peter III of Aragon, Manfred&#x27;s son-in-law, who saw his wife Constance as rightful heir to the Sicilian throne.

== The uprising ==

The event takes its name from an insurrection which began at the start of Vespers, the sunset prayer marking the beginning of the night vigil on Easter Monday, 30 March 1282, at the Church of the Holy Spirit just outside Palermo. Beginning on that night, thousands of Sicily&#x27;s French inhabitants were massacred within six weeks. The events that started the uprising are not known for certain, but the various retellings have common elements.

According to Steven Runciman, the Sicilians at the church were engaged in holiday festivities and a group of French officials came by to join in and began to drink. A sergeant named Drouet dragged a young married woman from the crowd, pestering her with his advances. Her husband then attacked Drouet with a knife, killing him. When the other Frenchmen tried to avenge their comrade, the Sicilian crowd fell upon them, killing them all. At that moment all the church bells in Palermo began to ring for Vespers. Runciman describes the mood of the night:
According to Leonardo Bruni (1416), the Palermitans were holding a festival outside the city when the French came up to check for weapons, and on that pretext began to fondle the breasts of their women. This then began a riot. The French were attacked, first with rocks, then weapons, and all were killed. The news spread to other cities leading to revolt throughout Sicily. &quot;By the time the furious anger at their insolence had drunk its fill of blood, the French had given up to the Sicilians not only their ill-gotten riches but their lives as well.&quot;

There is also a third version of the events that is quite close to Runciman&#x27;s, varying only in the minor details. This story is part of the oral tradition on the island up to the present time. This oral tradition cannot be verified, but is of interest to sociologists. According to the legend, John of Procida was the mastermind behind the conspiracy, though modern sources consider Procida&#x27;s role in instigating the revolt to be either an exaggeration or outright historical inaccuracy. It seems that he was in contact with both Michael VIII Palaiologos and Peter III of Aragon. All three were later excommunicated by Pope Martin IV in 1282.

==Immediate aftermath==
After leaders were elected in Palermo, messengers spread word across the island for the rebels to strike before the French had time to organise resistance. In a fortnight the rebels gained control over most of the island, and within six weeks it was all under rebel control, except for Messina which was well fortified, and whose leading family, the Riso, remained faithful to Charles. But on 28 April it too broke into open revolt under the command of Captain of the People and, most significantly, the islanders&#x27; first act was to set fire to Charles&#x27;s fleet in the harbor. It is reported that upon hearing of the fleet&#x27;s destruction, King Charles exclaimed &quot;Lord God, since it has pleased You to ruin my fortune, let me only go down in small steps.&quot;

Charles&#x27; Vicar Herbert and his family were safely within castle Mategriffon, but after negotiations the rebels granted Herbert and his family safe conduct to leave the island upon a promise that they never return. After the restoration of order in the city, the townsmen announced themselves a free commune answerable only to the pope. They elected leaders, one of whom was Bartholomaeus of Neocastro who was prominent in the unfolding events and would later chronicle much of the revolt in &quot;Historia Sicula&quot;, an important if sometimes contradictory source of information for historians. Again significantly, the leaders&#x27; next act was to send word, via a Genoese merchant named Alafranco Cassano, to the Emperor Michael advising him that his nemesis Charles had been crippled. Only thereafter were ambassadors sent to Pope Martin IV pleading for each city on the island to be recognised as a free commune under the sole suzerainty of the Holy Church. The islanders were hoping for status similar to that enjoyed by Venice, Genoa, Pisa and other cities, which were free to form their own government but morally answerable only to the Pope, who would hold a vague and unstable suzerainty. However, the French pope was firmly in Charles&#x27; camp and he directed the Sicilians to recognize Charles as their rightful king. But Martin underestimated the Sicilians&#x27; hatred of the French, and especially of Charles, who ruled from Naples rather than Palermo, where he could have seen the suffering caused by his officials. Charles&#x27; island officials were far removed from his oversight; he did not see the avarice, the rape, theft and murder, nor did he see the high taxes levied against the meager possessions of the peasants, which kept them impoverished, but made no improvement in their lives.

==Aragonese intervention==
The pope refused the rebels&#x27; pleas to allow the status of free communes; therefore, the Sicilians sent their pleas to Peter III of Aragon married to Constance, daughter of Manfred, King of Sicily and granddaughter of the Hohenstaufen Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick II. Of all that emperor&#x27;s heirs, she was the only one not captive and was able to assert her rights. Peter III championed his wife&#x27;s claim to the entirety of the Kingdom of Sicily.

Before the Vespers, Peter III constructed and outfitted a fleet for war. When the pope asked why he needed such a great war fleet, Peter stated that it would be used against the Saracens along the northern coast of Africa, because he had legitimate trade interests there and needed to protect them. So when Peter received a request for help from the Sicilians he was conveniently on the north coast of Africa in Tunis, just 200 miles across the sea from the island. At first, Peter feigned indifference to the request of the Sicilians and their plight, but after several days to allow a proper showing of deference made for the pope&#x27;s consumption, he took advantage of the revolt. Peter ordered his fleet to sail for Sicily, landed at Trapani on 30 August 1282. While he marched towards Palermo, his fleet followed close by the coastal road. Peter III of Aragon&#x27;s involvement changed the character of the uprising from a local revolt into a European war. When Peter arrived at Palermo on September 2, he was received initially by the populace with indifference, as merely one foreign king replacing another. However, when Pope Martin made plain his orders for the Sicilians to accept Charles, Peter promised the islanders that they would enjoy the ancient privileges they had had under the Norman king, William II of Sicily. Thus, he was accepted as a satisfactory second choice and crowned by acclamation at the cathedral in Palermo on September 4, thus becoming also Peter I of Sicily.

With the pope&#x27;s blessing, the counterattack from Charles was not long in coming; his fleet from the Kingdom of Naples arrived and blockaded the port of Messina and made several attempts to land troops on the island, but all were repulsed.

== The commentary of Michael Palaeologos ==
Years later, in his autobiography, the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII wrote: &quot;Should I dare to claim that I was God&#x27;s instrument to bring freedom to the Sicilians, then I should only be stating the truth.&quot; But as Runciman observes, with or without Byzantine gold, it was the proud people of Sicily alone who fought against their armed oppressor; and &quot;However it may have been plotted and prepared, it was that one March evening of the Vespers at Palermo that brought down King Charles&#x27; empire.&quot;

*The Sicilian Vespers has been a commonly represented topic by Italian painters, for example, Francesco Hayez painted three works on the Sicilian Vespers, the first in 1821. Other painters include Morelli, Erulo Eroli, and Michele Rapisardi.
*Felicia Hemans&#x27;s tragedy, &quot;The Vespers of Palermo&quot; (1823), in which the hero, Raimond di Procida (son of the Count di Procida), supports the insurrection but refuses to take part in the murder of innocent French citizens, is based loosely on this uprising.
*The German composer Peter Josef von Lindpaintner composed the opera &quot;Die Sizilianische Vesper&quot;, premiered in 1843 in Stuttgart and recorded in 2015 in its Italian version, &quot;Il vespro siciliano&quot;.
*The present (but composed in 1847 and set to music in 1848) Italian National anthem, &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot;, popularly known as &quot;Fratelli d&#x27;Italia&quot; (&quot;Brothers of Italy&quot;): &quot;Il suon d&#x27;ogni squilla / i vespri sonò&quot; (with reference to the past uprisings of the Italian people against foreign rulers, occurring again in these years).
*Reflecting the dual significance of the events to both France and Italy, Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Les vêpres siciliennes&quot; (1855) was originally written for the Paris Opera to a libretto by Eugène Scribe but circulated more widely in its Italian version, &quot;I vespri siciliani&quot;.
*A popular urban legend holds that the Mafia began with the Sicilian Vespers and the word Mafia itself is a backronym for &quot;Morte Alla Francia Italia Anelia!&quot; (&quot;Death to the French is Italy&#x27;s Cry!&quot;). However, this is very unlikely as Sicilians did not consider themselves to be Italians in the 13th century. The first reference to the term Mafia dates from 1862. The claim that the Mafia originated as a secret society that had allegedly organised and led the uprising of 1282 was propagated by Mafiosi in the 19th and 20th centuries to promote the Mafia&#x27;s self-image as the romantic and chivalrous defenders of ordinary Sicilians against foreign oppressors. This origins story came to be believed by Mafiosi themselves with for example the American Mafiosi Joseph Bonanno telling his friends and family when asked about the origin of the Mafia that it began with the Sicilian Vespers. The fact that many Sicilians considered the Piedmont-dominated Italian state that emerged after Italian unification in 1861 to be a sort of foreign occupation gave the Mafia a strong reason to promote this image to capitalise on the widespread resentment felt by people in the &quot;Mezzogiorno&quot; about the way that the Piedmontese monopolised power in the new state. Hence the story about Mafia as the leaders of the Sicilian Vespers was invented, with the implication that the Italian state was the latest in a series of foreign oppressors and it would be ignoble for Sicilians to co-operate with the Italian state against the Mafia.

==Other uses of the term==
*In 1594, when the French King Henry IV was taking some tedious peace negotiations with the Spanish ambassador in France, bored with the unwillingness of the Spaniards to accept his terms, he stated that the King of Spain should behave with more humility, for if not, he could easily invade Spanish territories in Italy, stating that &quot;My armies could move so fast that I would have breakfast in Milan and dine in Rome.&quot; Whereupon the Spanish ambassador replied &quot;Now then, if that is so, Your Majesty would surely make it to Sicily in time for Vespers&quot;. 
*Having previously arranged the murder of mafia boss Joe Masseria on 15 April 1931 in order to consolidate organized crime in New York City under Salvatore Maranzano, mafia boss Lucky Luciano then ordered the murders of Maranzano and those capos of Maranzano and Masseria whom Luciano saw as threats. These murders allegedly occurred on September 10, 1931, which marked the end of the Castellammarese War in New York City and in mafia parlance is known as the &quot;Night of the Sicilian Vespers&quot;. This was later proved to be mostly a myth in mafia culture as no hard evidence exists that all these murders – outside of Maranzano and a few others – actually occurred.
*Sicilian-born brothers David and Francis Rifugiato named their short-lived band &quot;The Sicilian Vespers&quot; after this event. They released one album on Profile Records in 1988.

<doc id="298361" wikidata="Q465589" url="?curid=298361" title="Hamida Djandoubi">
<text>Hamida Djandoubi (; 22 September 1949 – 10 September 1977) was a Tunisian convicted murderer sentenced to death in France. He moved to Marseille in 1968, and six years later he was convicted of the kidnapping, torture and murder of 21-year-old Élisabeth Bousquet. He was sentenced to death in February 1977 and executed by guillotine in September that year, and also the last person to be lawfully executed by beheading anywhere in the Western world. Marcel Chevalier served as chief executioner.

== Early life ==
Born in Tunisia on 22 September 1949, Djandoubi started living in Marseille in 1968, where he worked in a grocery store. He later worked as a landscaper but had a workplace accident in 1971: his leg got caught in the tracks of a tractor, resulting in the loss of two-thirds of his right leg.

== Allegation of forced prostitution ==
In 1973, a 21-year-old woman named Élisabeth Bousquet, whom Djandoubi had met in the hospital while recovering from his amputation, filed a complaint against him, stating that he had tried to force her into prostitution.

== Murder of Élisabeth Bousquet ==
After his arrest and eventual release from custody during the spring of 1973, Djandoubi drew two other young girls into his confidence and then forced them into prostitution for him. On 3 July 1974, he kidnapped Bousquet and took her into his home where, in full view of the terrified girls, he beat the woman before stubbing a lit cigarette all over her breasts and genital area. Bousquet survived the ordeal so he took her by car to the outskirts of Marseille and strangled her there.

On his return, Djandoubi warned the two girls to say nothing of what they had seen. Bousquet&#x27;s body was discovered in a shed by a boy on 7 July 1974. One month later, Djandoubi kidnapped another girl who managed to escape and report him to police.

== Trial and execution ==
After a lengthy pre-trial process, Djandoubi eventually appeared in court in Aix-en-Provence on charges of torture-murder, rape, and premeditated violence on 24 February 1977. His main defence revolved around the supposed effects of the loss of his leg six years earlier, which his lawyer claimed had driven him to a paroxysm of alcohol abuse and violence that had turned him into &quot;a different man&quot;.

On 25 February, he was sentenced to death. An appeal was rejected on 9 June. On 10 September 1977, Djandoubi was informed early in the morning that, as in the child murderers cases of Christian Ranucci (executed on 28 July 1976) and Jérôme Carrein (executed on 23 June 1977), he had not received a reprieve from President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing. Shortly afterwards, at 4:40 a.m., Djandoubi was executed by guillotine at Baumettes Prison in Marseille.

While Djandoubi was the last person executed in France, he was not the last condemned. Fifteen defendants were sentenced to die before capital punishment was abolished in France on 9 October 1981 following the election of François Mitterrand, and those previously sentenced had their sentences commuted. Djandoubi&#x27;s death was the last time any Western nation carried out an execution by beheading, as well as the most recent government-sanctioned guillotine execution in the world.

<text>The Lotus Sūtra (Sanskrit: &quot;Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtram&quot;, Sūtra on the White Lotus of the True Dharma, ) is one of the most influential and venerated Buddhist Mahāyāna sūtras. It is the main scripture on which the Tiantai along with its derivative schools, the Japanese Tendai and Nichiren, Korean Cheontae, and Vietnamese Thiên Thai schools of Buddhism were established. It is also influential for other East Asian Buddhist schools, such as Zen. According to the British Buddhologist Paul Williams, &quot;For many Buddhists in East Asia since early times, the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; contains the final teaching of Shakyamuni Buddha—complete and sufficient for salvation.&quot; The American Buddhologist Donald S. Lopez Jr. writes that the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; &quot;is arguably the most famous of all Buddhist texts,&quot; presenting &quot;a radical re-vision of both the Buddhist path and of the person of the Buddha.&quot;

Two central teachings of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; have been very influential for Mahāyāna Buddhism. The first is the doctrine of the One Vehicle, which says that all Buddhist paths and practices lead to Buddhahood and so they are all actually &quot;skillful means&quot; of reaching Buddhahood. The second is the idea that the lifespan of the Buddha is immeasurable and that therefore, he did not really pass on into final Nirvana (he only appeared to do so as &quot;upāya&quot;), but is still active teaching the Dharma.

== Title ==

The earliest known Sanskrit title for the sūtra is the &quot;Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra&quot;, which can be translated as &quot;the Scripture of the Lotus Blossom of the Fine Dharma&quot; or &quot;The Discourse on the White Lotus of the True Doctrine.&quot; In English, the shortened form &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; is more common.

Translations of this title into Asian languages include the following:

* . This is the title of Kumarajiva&#x27;s Chinese translation. The characters mean: subtle dharma lotus flower sutra
** Shortened title: (&quot;Dharma Flower Sutra&quot;)
** The title of Dharmaraksha&#x27;s Chinese translation is (&quot;True Dharma Flower Sutra&quot;)
* (short: &quot;Hoke-kyō&quot;)
* (short: ).
* (short: ).
* Tangut (romanized): 

The Japanese Buddhist priest Nichiren (1222–1282) regarded the title as the summary of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; teachings. The chanting of the title is the basic religious practice he advocated during his lifetime.

== Main themes ==
=== One Vehicle, Many Skillful Means ===
The &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; is known for its extensive instruction on skillful means (Sanskrit: &quot;upāyakauśalya&quot; or &quot;upāya&quot;, Ch.: &quot;fangbian&quot;, Jp.: &quot;hōben&quot;), which refers to how Buddhas teach in many ways adapted to the needs of their disciples. This concept of Buddhist pedagogical strategies is often explained through parables or allegories. In the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;, the many &#x27;skillful&#x27; or &#x27;expedient&#x27; practices and teachings taught by the Buddha (including the &quot;three vehicles&quot; to awakening) are revealed to all be part of the &quot;One Vehicle&quot; (Skt.: &quot;ekayāna&quot;, Ch.:一乘; &quot;yīchéng&quot;), the supreme and all encompassing path that leads to Buddhahood. Moreover, this single vehicle is none other than the myriad skillful means which are its expressions and modes. As the Buddha says in the sutra, &quot;seek as you will in all ten directions, there is no other vehicle, apart from the &quot;upāyas&quot; of the buddhas.&quot;

The One Vehicle is associated with the Mahāyāna (&quot;Great Vehicle&quot;), which is a path that rejects the cutting off of rebirth (the individual nirvana or &quot;extinction&quot; of the Buddhist saint) and seeks to heroically remain in the world of suffering to help others attain awakening, all while working towards complete Buddhahood. In the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;, the One Vehicle encompasses many different and seemingly contradictory teachings because the Buddha&#x27;s great compassion and wish to save all beings (&quot;bodhicitta&quot;) led him to adapt the teaching to suit many different kinds of people and contexts. As the Buddha states in the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;: &quot;Ever since I became a buddha, I have used a variety of causal explanations and a variety of parables to teach and preach, and countless skillful means to lead living beings.&quot;

The &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; declares also all other teachings are subservient to, propagated by and in the service of the ultimate truth of the &quot;One Buddha–Vehicle&quot;, a goal that is available to all. This can and has been interpreted by some figures in an exclusive and hierarchical sense, as meaning that all other Buddhist teachings are to be dispensed with. However, Reeves and other interpreters understand the one vehicle in a more pluralist and inclusive sense which embraces and reconciles all Buddhist teachings and practices. Some have even applied this universalism to non-Buddhist teachings.

Reeves also notes that the theme of unity and difference also includes other ideas besides the One Vehicle. According to Reeves &quot;on more than one occasion, for example, the many worlds of the universe are brought together into a unity.&quot; Similarly, though there are said to be many Buddhas, they are all closely connected with Shakyamuni and they all teach the same thing.

=== All beings have the potential to become Buddhas ===
Another important teaching of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; is that all beings can become Buddhas. The sutra sees the awakening of a Buddha as the only and ultimate goal, and it claims that &quot;of any who hear the dharma, none shall fail to achieve buddhahood.&quot; Numerous figures in the sutra receive predictions of future Buddhahood, including the ultimate Buddhist villain Devadatta. In chapter 10, the Buddha points out that all sorts of people will become Buddhas, including monks, nuns, laypeople, along with numerous non-human beings like nagas. Even those, who practice only simple forms of devotion, such as paying respect to the Buddha, or drawing a picture of the Buddha, are assured of their future Buddhahood.

According to Gene Reeves, this teaching also encourages this potential for Buddhahood in all beings, even in enemies as well as &quot;to realize our own capacity to be a buddha for someone else.&quot; According to Reeves, the story of the little Dragon Girl promotes the idea that women can also become Buddhas just like monks. Reeves sees this as an inclusive message which &quot;affirms the equality of everyone and seeks to provide an understanding of Buddha-dharma that excludes no one.&quot;

Although the term buddha-nature (&quot;buddhadhatu&quot;) is not mentioned in the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;, Japanese scholars Hajime Nakamura and Akira Hirakawa suggest that the concept is implicitly present in the text. An Indian commentary (attributed to Vasubandhu), interprets the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; as a teaching of buddha-nature and later East Asian commentaries tended to adopt this view. Chinese commentators pointed to the story of Bodhisattva Never Disparaging in chapter 20 as evidence that the Lotus taught buddha-nature implicitly.

=== The nature of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas ===
Another key concept introduced by the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; is the idea that the Buddha&#x27;s lifespan is immeasurable and that he is still present in the world. The text states that the Buddha actually achieved Buddhahood innumerable eons ago, but remains in the world to help teach beings the Dharma time and again. The lifespan of the Buddha is said to be incalculable, beyond imagination, &quot;ever enduring, never perishing.&quot; The biography and apparent death (&quot;paranirvana&quot;, &quot;final nirvana&quot;) of Sakyamuni Buddha (i.e., the Buddha Gautama) are portrayed as an illusory manifestation, a skillful means meant to teach others.

The idea that the physical death of a Buddha is the termination of their life is graphically refuted by the appearance of another Buddha, Prabhūtaratna, who has taught the &quot;Lotus&quot; countless aeons ago. The &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; indicates that not only can multiple Buddhas exist in the same time and place (which contrasts with earlier Indian views), but that there are countless streams of Buddhas extending throughout all of space and through unquantifiable eons of time. The &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; illustrates a sense of timelessness and the inconceivable, often using large numbers and measurements of space and time.

Jacqueline Stone writes that the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; affirms the view that the Buddha constantly abides in our present world. As the &quot;Lotus&quot; states in chapter 16, the Buddha remains &quot;constantly dwelling in this Sahā world sphere, preaching the dharma, teaching and converting.&quot; According to Stone, the sūtra has also been interpreted as promoting the idea that the Buddha&#x27;s realm (&quot;buddhakṣetra&quot;) &quot;is in some sense immanent in the present world, although radically different from our ordinary experience of being free from decay, danger and suffering.&quot; In this view, which is very influential in Tiantai and Japanese Buddhism, &quot;this world and the pure land are not, ultimately, separate places but are in fact non dual.&quot;

According to Gene Reeves, the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; also teaches that the Buddha has many embodiments and these are the countless bodhisattva disciples. These bodhisattvas choose to remain in the world to save all beings and to keep the teaching alive. For Reeves &quot;the fantastically long life of the Buddha, in other words, is at least partly a function of and dependent on his being embodied in others.&quot;

== Overview ==
The sutra is presented in the form of a drama consisting of several mythological scenes. According to British writer Sangharakshita, the Lotus uses the entire cosmos for its stage, employs a multitude of mythological beings as actors and &quot;speaks almost exclusively in the language of images.&quot;

According to Gene Reeves the first part of the sutra &quot;elucidates a unifying truth of the universe (the One Vehicle of the Wonderful Dharma)&quot;, the second part &quot;sheds light on the everlasting personal life of the Buddha (Everlasting Original Buddha); and the third part emphasizes the actual activities of human beings (the bodhisattva way).&quot;

The following chapter by chapter overview is based on the expanded Chinese version of Kumārajīva, the most widely translated version into other languages. Other versions have different chapter divisions.

=== Chapter 1 ===
During a gathering at Vulture Peak, Shakyamuni Buddha goes into a state of deep meditative absorption (&quot;samadhi&quot;), the earth shakes in six ways, and he brings forth a ray of light from the tuft of hair in between his eyebrows (&quot;ūrṇākośa&quot;) which illuminates thousands of buddha-fields in the east. Maitreya wonders what this means, and the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī states that he has seen this miracle long ago when he was a student of the Buddha Candrasūryapradīpa. He then says that the Buddha is about to expound his ultimate teaching, &quot;The White Lotus of the Good Dharma&quot;. In fact, Mañjuśrī says this sutra was taught by other Buddhas innumerable times in the past.

=== Chapters 2–9 ===
Modern scholars suggest that chapters 2–9 contain the original form of the text. In Chapter 2 the Buddha declares that there ultimately exists only one path, one vehicle, the Buddha vehicle (&quot;buddhayāna&quot;). This concept is set forth in detail in chapters 3–9, using parables, narratives of previous existences and prophecies of awakening.

Chapter 2: Skillful Means

Shakyamuni explains his use of skillful means to adapt his teachings according to the capacities of his audience. He also says that his ways are inconceivable. Śāriputra asks the Buddha to explain this and five thousand monks leave because they do not want to hear this teaching. The Buddha then reveals that the three vehicles (&quot;yānas&quot;) are really just skillful means, and that they are in reality the One Vehicle (&quot;ekayāna&quot;). He says that the ultimate purpose of the Buddhas is to cause sentient beings &quot;to obtain the insight of the Buddha&quot; and &quot;to enter the way into the insight of the Buddha.&quot;

The Buddha also states the various benefits for those who preserve the sutra, and that those who perform even the simplest forms of devotion will eventually reach Buddhahood. The Buddha also states that those who reject and insult the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; (and those who teach it) will be reborn in hell.

Chapter 3: The Parable of the Burning House

The Buddha prophesies that in a future eon (&quot;kalpa&quot;) Śāriputra will become a Buddha called Padmaprabha. Śāriputra is happy to have heard this new teaching, but says that some in the assembly are confused. The Buddha responds with the parable of the burning house, in which a father (symbolizing the Buddha) uses the promise of various toy carts to get his children (sentient beings) out of a burning house (symbolizing samsara). Once they are outside, he gives them all one large cart to travel in instead. This symbolizes how the Buddha uses the three vehicles, as skillful means to liberate all beings – even though there is only one single vehicle to Buddhahood, i.e. the Mahāyāna. The sutra emphasizes that this is not a lie, but a compassionate salvific act.

Chapter 4: Belief and Understanding

Four senior disciples including Mahākāśyapa address the Buddha. They tell the parable of the poor son and his rich father (sometimes called the &quot;prodigal son&quot; parable). This man left home and became a beggar for 50 years while his father became incredibly rich. One day the son arrives at the father&#x27;s estate, but the son does not recognize his father and is afraid of such a powerful man. The father therefore sends low class people to offer him a menial job cleaning trash. For over 20 years, the father gradually leads his son to more important and better jobs, such as being the accountant for all the father&#x27;s wealth. Then one day he announces his identity and the son is overjoyed. The senior disciples say that they are like the son, because initially they did not have the confidence to accept full Buddhahood, but today they are happy to accept their future Buddhahood.

Chapter 5: The Parable of Medicinal Herbs

This parable says that the Dharma is like a great monsoon rain that nourishes many different kinds of plants in accordance with their needs. The plants represent Śrāvakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and Bodhisattvas, and all beings which receive and respond to the teachings according to their respective capacities. Some versions of the sutra also contain other parables, such as one which compares the Dharma to the light of the Sun and moon, which shine equally on all. Just like that, the Buddha&#x27;s wisdom shines on everyone equally. Another parable found in some versions says that just like a potter makes different types of pots from the same clay, the Buddha teaches the same One Vehicle in different forms.

Chapter 6: Bestowal of Prophecy

The Buddha prophesies the future Buddhahood of Mahākāśyapa, Mahā­maudgalyāyana, Subhūti, and Mahākātyāyana.

Chapter 7: A Past Buddha and the Illusory City

The Buddha tells a story about a past Buddha called Mahābhijñā­jñānābhibhū, who reached awakening after aeons under the Bodhi tree and then taught the four noble truths and dependent origination. At the request of his sixteen sons, he then taught the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; for a hundred thousand eons. His sons proceeded to teach the sutra. The Buddha then says that these sons all became Buddhas and that he is one of these.

The Buddha also teaches a parable about a group of people seeking a great treasure who are tired of their journey and wish to quit. Their guide creates a magical illusory city for them to rest in and then makes it disappear. The Buddha explains that the magic city represents the &quot;Hinayana Nirvana&quot;, created merely as a rest stop by the Buddha, and the real treasure and ultimate goal is Buddhahood.

Chapter 8: Prophecy for Five Hundred Disciples

Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇī­putra is declared by the Buddha to be the supreme teacher in his saṅgha and is given a prediction of future Buddhahood (his name will be Dharmaprabhāsa). The Buddha then gives prophecies of future Buddhahood to twelve hundred arhats. The five hundred arhats who had walked out before confess that they were ignorant in the past and attached to the inferior nirvana but now they are overjoyed since they have faith in their future Buddhahood.

The arhats tell the parable of a man who has fallen asleep after drinking and whose friend sews a jewel into his garment. When he wakes up he continues a life of poverty without realizing he is really rich, he only discovers the jewel after meeting his old friend again. The hidden jewel has been interpreted as a symbol of Buddha-nature. Zimmermann noted the similarity with the nine parables in the &quot;Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra&quot; that illustrate how the indwelling Buddha in sentient beings is hidden by negative mental states.

Chapter 9: Prophecies for the Learners and Adepts

Ānanda, Rāhula, and two thousand bhikṣus aspire to get a prophecy, and the Buddha predicts their future Buddhahood.

=== Chapters 10–22 ===
Chapters ten to twenty two expound the role of the bodhisattva and the concept of the immeasurable and inconceivable lifespan and omnipresence of the Buddha. The theme of propagating the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; which starts in chapter 10, continues in the remaining chapters.

Chapter 10: The Dharma teachers

The Buddha states that whoever hears even just one line from the sūtra will attain Buddhahood. This chapter presents the practices of teaching the sutra which includes accepting, embracing, reading, reciting, copying, explaining, propagating it, and living in accordance with its teachings. The teachers of the Dharma (&quot;dharmabhāṇaka&quot;) are praised as the messengers of the Buddha. The Buddha states that they should be honored as if they were Buddhas and that stupas should be built wherever the sutra is taught, recited or written. Someone who does not know the &quot;Lotus&quot; is like digging a well and finding only dry earth, while a bodhisattva that knows the &quot;Lotus&quot; is like striking water. The Buddha also says that he will send emanations to protect the teachers of the sutra.
Chapter 11: The Emergence of the Jeweled Stupa

A massive jeweled stupa (a stylized Buddhist reliquary burial mound) rises from the earth and floats in the air. Then a voice is heard from within praising the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;. The Buddha states that another Buddha resides in the stupa, Prabhūtaratna, who attained awakening through the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; and made a vow to make an appearance to verify the truth of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; whenever it is preached.

Countless manifestations of Shakyamuni Buddha in the ten directions are now summoned by the Buddha into this world, transforming it into a Pure Land. The Buddha then opens the stupa. Thereafter Prabhūtaratna invites Shakyamuni to sit beside him in the jeweled stupa. This chapter reveals the existence of multiple Buddhas at the same time as well as the idea that Buddhas can live on for countless aeons. According to Donald Lopez &quot;among the doctrinal revelations that this scene intimates is that a buddha does not die after he passes into nirvāna.&quot;

Chapter 12: Devadatta

The Buddha tells a story about how in a previous life he was a king who became the slave of a rishi just so he could hear the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;. This rishi was none other than Devadatta, who is destined for Buddhahood in the future as the Buddha Devarāja.

In another story, Mañjuśrī praises the nāga king Sāgara&#x27;s daughter and says she can attain Buddhahood. The bodhisattva Prajñākūṭa is skeptical of this, and then the nāga princess appears. Śāriputra says that women cannot attain Buddhahood. The nāga princess makes an offering to the Buddha of a precious jewel and then says she can reach Buddhahood faster than she made that offering. She then turns into a male bodhisattva and becomes a Buddha. Through these stories, the Buddha teaches that everyone can become enlightened – men, women, animals, and even the most sinful murderers.

Chapter 13: Encouraging Devotion

The Buddha encourages all beings to embrace the teachings of the sutra in all times, even in the most difficult ages to come. The bodhisattvas Bhaiṣajyarāja, Mahāpratibhāna and two hundred thousand others promise to teach the sutra in the future. The Buddha prophecies that the six thousand nuns who are also present, including Mahāprajāpatī and Yaśodharā, will all become Buddhas.

Chapter 14: Peaceful Practices

Mañjuśrī asks how a bodhisattva should spread the teaching. The Buddha explains the four qualities they should cultivate to teach the sutra. First, they should be self-controlled and correctly see the characteristics of phenomena and they should stay apart from worldly life. Secondly, they should see the emptiness of phenomena. Thirdly, they should be happy and never criticize and discourage people from enlightenment. Finally, they should have compassion for people and wish to attain Buddhahood so they may help liberate others. Virtues such as patience, gentleness, a calm mind, wisdom and compassion are to be cultivated.

Chapter 15: Emerging from the Earth

The bodhisattvas from other world systems say they will help the Buddha teach this sutra here, but the Buddha says their help is not needed—he has many bodhisattvas here. Then the ground splits open and countless bodhisattvas spring up from the earth (led by Vi­śiṣṭacāritra, Anantacāritra, Vi­śuddhacāritra, and Supratiṣṭhitacāritra‍), ready to teach. Maitreya asks who these bodhisattvas are since nobody has heard of them before. The Buddha affirms that he has taught all of these bodhisattvas himself in the remote past after attaining Buddhahood. Maitreya then asks how this is possible, since these bodhisattvas have been training for aeons.

Chapter 16: The Life Span of Tathagatha

The Buddha (Tathagatha) states that he actually attained Buddhahood countless quintillions of eons ago. He has only appeared to become awakened recently as a skillful means to teach others. The Buddha also says that he only appears to pass into final nirvāṇa, but actually he does not really do so. This is just an expedient teaching so that beings will not become complacent. The Buddha then teaches the Parable of the Excellent Doctor who entices his poisoned sons into taking an antidote by feigning his death. After they hear this they are shocked and take the medicine. The doctor then reveals he is still alive. Because the Buddha uses skillful means in this way, he should not be seen as a liar, but as an intelligent teacher.

Chapter 17: Merit

The Buddha explains the merit (&quot;punya&quot;) or benefits that come from listening to and believing in this teaching on the Buddha&#x27;s lifespan. He says that this teaching has led countless bodhisattvas, as many as the sands of the Ganges, to various levels of spiritual accomplishment. He also says that there is greater benefit in hearing and believing the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; than practicing the first five perfections for eons. The Buddha states that those who have faith in this teaching will see this world as a pure land filled with bodhisattvas. Those who have faith in the sutra have already made offerings to past Buddhas and they do not need to build stupas or temples. These beings will develop excellent qualities and attain Buddhahood. This chapter also says that Caityas should be built to honor the Buddha.

Chapter 18: Rejoicing

The Buddha states that the merit generated from rejoicing in this sutra (or in even just a single line from it) is far greater than bringing thousands of beings to arhathood. The merits of listening to the sutra, for even a moment, are extensively praised in this chapter.

Chapter 19: Benefits of the Teacher of the Law

The Buddha praises the merits of those who are devoted to the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;. He states that their six sense bases (&quot;ayatanas&quot;) will become purified and develop the ability to experience the senses of billions of worlds as well as other supernatural powers.

Chapter 20: The Bodhisattva Never Disparaging

The Buddha tells a story about a previous life when he was a bodhisattva called Sadāparibhūta (&quot;Never-disparaging&quot; or &quot;Never-disrespectful&quot;) and how he treated every person he met, good or bad, with respect, always remembering that they will become Buddhas. Never-disparaging experienced much ridicule and condemnation by other monastics and laypersons but he always responded by saying &quot;I do not despise you, for you will become a buddha.&quot; He continued to teach this sutra for many lifetimes until he reached Buddhahood.

Chapter 21: Supernatural Powers of the Thus Come One

This chapter reveals that the sutra contains all of the Buddha&#x27;s secret spiritual powers. The bodhisattvas who have sprung from the earth (in chapter 15) are entrusted with the task of spreading and propagating it and they promise to do so. Śākyamuni and Prabhūtaratna extend their tongues into the Brahmā realm, emitting numerous rays of light along with countless bodhisattvas. This miracle lasts for a hundred thousand years. Then they clear their throats and snap their fingers, which is heard in all worlds and all worlds shake. All beings in the universe are then given a vision of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas. All Buddhas praise Śākyamuni for teaching the &quot;Lotus&quot;. The Buddha says that the merits of teaching the sutra is immeasurable and that any place where it is being taught or copied is a holy place.

Chapter 22: Entrustment

The Buddha transmits the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; to all bodhisattvas in his congregation and entrusts them with its safekeeping and its propagation far and wide. The Buddha Prabhūtaratna in his jeweled stupa and the countless manifestations of Shakyamuni Buddha return to their respective buddha-fields. According to Donald Lopez, the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; &quot;appears to end with Chapter Twenty-Two, when the Buddha exhorts his disciples to spread the teaching, after which they return to their abodes...scholars speculate that this was the final chapter of an earlier version of the &quot;Lotus&quot;, with the last six chapters being interpolations.&quot; This is the final chapter in the Sanskrit versions and the alternative Chinese translation. Shioiri suggests that an earlier version of the sutra ended with this chapter and that chapters 23–28 were inserted later into the Sanskrit version.

=== Chapters 23–28 ===
These chapters are focused on various bodhisattvas and their deeds.

Chapter 23: Former Affairs of Bodhisattva Medicine King（藥王菩薩本事品）

The Buddha tells the story of the &#x27;Medicine King&#x27; (Bhaiṣajyarāja) bodhisattva, who, in a previous life as the bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana, set his body on fire, lighting up many world systems for twelve years, as a supreme offering to a Buddha. This chapter teaches the practice &quot;offering the body&quot;, which involves burning a part of one&#x27;s body (such as toe, finger, or a limb) as an offering. The hearing and chanting of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; is also said to cure diseases. The Buddha uses nine similes to declare that the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; is the king of all sutras. 

Chapter 24: The Bodhisattva Gadgadasvara（妙音菩薩品）

Gadgadasvara (&#x27;Wonderful Voice&#x27;), a bodhisattva from a distant world, visits Vulture Peak to worship the Buddha. Gadgadasvara once made offerings of various kinds of music to the Buddha Meghadundubhisvararāja. His accumulated merits enable him to take on many different forms to propagate the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;.

Chapter 25: The Universal Gateway Or The Universal Door of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva（觀世音菩薩普門品）

This chapter is devoted to bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara (Skt. “Lord Who Looks Down”, Ch. &quot;Guanyin,&quot; “Regarder of the Cries of the World”), describing him as a compassionate bodhisattva who hears the cries of sentient beings, and rescues those who call upon his name in various forms, which was explained when Akṣayamati asks the Buddha to elaborate on the character of the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara. Other names include the &quot;Avalokiteśvara Sutra&quot;（觀世音經）, &quot;Universal Gateway Chapter&quot;（普門品）and it is often recited separately from the main sutra. 

Chapter 26: Dhāraṇī（陀羅尼品）

Hariti and several bodhisattvas offer sacred &quot;dhāraṇī&quot; (magical formulas) in order to protect those who keep and recite the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;.

Chapter 27: Former Affairs of King Wonderful Adornment（妙莊嚴王本事品）

This chapter tells the story of the conversion of King &#x27;Wonderful-Adornment&#x27; by his two sons.

Chapter 28: Encouragement of Samantabhadra（普賢菩薩勸發品）

A bodhisattva called &quot;Universal Virtue&quot; or &quot;All Good&quot; (Samantabhadra) asks the Buddha how to preserve the sutra in the future. Samantabhadra promises to protect and guard all those who keep this sutra in the future. He says that those who uphold the sutra will be reborn in the Trāyastriṃśa and Tuṣita heavens. He also says that those who uphold this sutra will have many good qualities and should be seen and respected as Buddhas.

== History and reception ==

According to Lopez, the &quot;Lotus&quot; &quot;is clearly a work of high literary quality. Its authors are unknown, but they were likely highly educated Buddhist monks, fully at ease among the doctrines and tropes of Buddhism as it existed in India at the time.&quot; According to Peter Alan Roberts, the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; may have had its origin among the Mahāsāṃghika school and may have been written in a middle Indic language (a &quot;prakrit&quot;) that was subsequently Sanskritized. The idea that the sutra was originally in prakrit remains a contested claim among both secular and religious historians.

The &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; was frequently cited in Indian scholarly treatises and compendiums and several authors of the Madhyamaka and the Yogacara school discussed and debated its doctrine of the One Vehicle. According to Jonathan Silk, the influence of the Lotus Sūtra in India may have been limited, but &quot;it is a prominent scripture in East Asian Buddhism.&quot; Jacqueline Stone and Stephen F. Teiser meanwhile write that &quot;it is perhaps no exaggeration to say that the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; has been the most influential Buddhist scripture in East Asia.&quot; The sutra has most prominence in Tiantai (sometimes called &quot;The Lotus School&quot;) and Nichiren Buddhism.

=== Early development ===
According to Donald Lopez &quot;the general scholarly consensus is that the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; took shape in four phases.&quot; One of the earliest four layer theories of the development of the sutra was Kogaku Fuse&#x27;s.

Lopez and Seishi Karashima outline these phases as follows:

# The composition of Chapters 2–9. According to Seishi Karashima, this first layer includes the &quot;tristubh&quot; verses of these chapters which may have been transmitted orally in a Prakrit dialect.
# The composition of the prose sections of chapters 2–9. According to Karashima, this layer consists of the śloka verses and the prose of chapters 2–9.
# The third phase, which according to Lopez, saw the addition of Chapter One, as well as Chapter Ten through Chapter Twenty-Two (with the exception of Chapter Twelve). However, according to Karashima, this layer is comprised by Chapters 1, 10–20, 27, and a part of Chapter 5 that is missing in Kumarajiva&#x27;s translation.
# The fourth and final phase. Lopez writes that this comprises &quot;chapter Twenty-Three through Chapter Twenty-Seven, as well as Chapter Twelve, the Devadatta Chapter, with Chapter Twenty Eight added at some later date.&quot; Karashima argues that this comprises Chapters 21–26 and the section on Devadatta in chapter 11 of the Sanskrit version.
Stephen F. Teiser and Jacqueline Stone opines that there is consensus about the stages of composition but not about the dating of these strata. Author Yoisho Tamura argues that the first stage of composition (Chapters 2–9) was completed around 50 CE and expanded by chapters 10–21 around 100 CE. He dates the third stage (Chapters 22–27) around 150 CE.

=== Reception in India ===
According to Lopez, &quot;the number of surviving manuscripts and manuscript fragments of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; suggests that the text was copied often.&quot; The &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; is also cited in numerous scholarly treatises and compendiums, including in the Compendium of Sūtras (&quot;Sūtrasamuccaya,&quot; which cites four passages from the &quot;Lotus&quot;), in the Compendium of Training (&quot;Śiksāsamuccaya&quot;, three passages), in the &quot;Dazhidu lun&quot; (23 citations) and in the Great Compendium of Sūtras (&quot;Mahāsūtrasamuccaya&quot;) by the eleventh-century Bengali master Atiśa. It is cited by Indian Buddhists such as Vasubandhu (in his commentary on the &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot;), Candrakīrti (&quot;Madhyamakāvatāra-bhāṣya&quot;), Śāntideva, Kamalaśīla and Abhayākaragupta.

According to Paramārtha (499–569 CE), there were over fifty Indian commentaries on the &quot;Lotus&quot;. However, there is now only one surviving Indian commentary (which only survives in Chinese). It is attributed to Vasubandhu (but this has been questioned by scholars). This commentary asserts the superiority of the &quot;Lotus&quot; above all other sutras.

The &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;&#x27;s doctrine of the One Vehicle was not received equally by all Indian Buddhist traditions. While this doctrine was fully embraced by the Madhyamaka school, the Yogācāra school saw the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; as a provisional text. Thus, for the Indian Yogācāra thinkers, the doctrine of the One Vehicle should not be taken literally, since it is merely provisional (&quot;neyārtha&quot;). According to Donald Lopez &quot;the Yogācāra commentators argue in turn that the declaration that there is but one vehicle is not definitive but provisional, requiring interpretation; it is not to be taken to mean that there are not, in fact, three vehicles. When the Buddha said that the buddha vehicle was the one vehicle, he was exaggerating. What he meant was that it was the supreme vehicle.&quot; For Yogācāra scholars, this sutra was taught as an expedient means for the benefit of those persons who have entered the lesser śrāvaka vehicle but have the capacity to embrace the Mahāyāna.

An Indian version of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; was translated into Tibetan by Yeshé Dé, and the Indian translator Surendrabodhi during the reign of King Ralpachen (r. 815–38). This version most closely matches the Chinese version of Jñānagupta and Dharmagupta, as well as the Nepalese Sanskrit version.

=== In China ===

==== Translations ====
Three translations of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; into Chinese are extant. It was first translated into Chinese by &#x27;s team in 286 C. E. in Chang&#x27;an during the Western Jin period (265–317 CE). It was initially held that the source text was in Sanskrit, however, the view that the source text was actually in a Prakrit language has gained widespread acceptance.

This early translation by Dharmarakṣa was superseded by a translation in seven fascicles by Kumārajīva&#x27;s team in 406 C.E. which became the standard translation in East Asian Buddhism. According to Jean-Noël Robert, Kumārajīva relied heavily on the earlier version. The Sanskrit editions are not widely used outside of academia. Kumārajīva&#x27;s version is missing the Devadatta chapter which had been present in the Dharmaraksa version.
The third extant version, &quot;The Supplemented Lotus Sūtra of the Wonderful Dharma&quot; (Chinese: &quot;Tiān Pǐn Miào Fǎ Lián Huá Jīng&quot;), in 7 volumes and 27 chapters, is a revised version of Kumārajīva&#x27;s text, translated by Jñānagupta and Dharmagupta in 601 C. E. This version included elements that were absent in the Kumārajīva text, including the Devadatta chapter, various verses and the concluding part of chapter 25. Later, these elements were added back to the Kumārajīva text.

The Chinese &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; has been translated into other Asian languages including Uighur, Tangut, and more recently colloquial Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean.

==== Commentaries ====
One of Kumārajīva&#x27;s great disciples, Daosheng (355–434), wrote the oldest surviving Chinese commentary on the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; (titled the &quot;Fahua jing yishu&quot;). For Daosheng, the central teaching of the sutra is the One Vehicle. According to Lopez, Daosheng divided the sutra into three parts (omitting the Devadatta Chapter): &quot;the first thirteen chapters demonstrate that the cause of the three vehicles becomes the cause of the one vehicle. The next eight chapters demonstrate that the effect of the three vehicles is also the effect of the one vehicle. The final six chapters demonstrate that the followers of the three vehicles are the same as the followers of the one vehicle.&quot; Daosheng was also known for promoting the concept of Buddha nature and the idea that even deluded people will attain enlightenment.

Already during the Tang dynasty, Daoxuan (596–667) was writing that the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; was &quot;the most important sutra in China&quot;. Kuiji (632–82), a disciple of Xuanzang, wrote a commentary on the &quot;Lotus&quot;. This commentary was translated into Tibetan and survives in the Tibetan Buddhist canon. Numerous other commentators from different Chinese Buddhist traditions wrote commentaries on the &quot;Lotus&quot;&quot;. One topic of debate among Chinese commentators to the &quot;Lotus&quot; was the &quot;three carts or four carts&quot; debate which focused on whether the One Vehicle was the same as the bodhisattva vehicle or a different vehicle that transcends the Mahāyāna.

Chinese exegetes also disagreed on whether the Buddha of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; had an infinite life or a finite life (of immeasurable length) as well as on the issue of whether the ultimate, primordial Buddha of the &quot;Lotus&quot; referred to the Dharma-body (&quot;dharmakaya&quot;), to the reward body (&quot;sambhogakaya&quot;), or to the manifest, physical body (&quot;nirmanakaya&quot;).

==== Tiantai ====
Perhaps the most influential Chinese commentator on the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; was Zhiyi (538–597), a patriarch of the Tiantai School, who was said to have experienced awakening while reading the &quot;Lotus Sūtra.&quot; Zhiyi was a student of Nanyue Huisi who was the leading authority of his time on the Lotus Sūtra.

Zhiyi adopted Daosheng&#x27;s division of the sutra into three parts. For Zhiyi, the first fourteen chapters are &quot;the trace teaching&quot; (Ch. &quot;jimen; shakumon&quot; in Japanese) and the second fourteen chapters are the &quot;fundamental&quot; or &quot;original&quot; teaching (&quot;benmen;&quot; Jp. &quot;honmon&quot;). For Zhiyi, the key message of the first part is the One Vehicle, while the key message of the second half (the fundamental teaching of the whole text) is the immeasurable lifespan of the Buddha. According to Lopez, &quot;Zhiyi compares the fundamental teaching with the moon shining in the sky and the trace teaching with a moon reflected in a lake; the first is the source of the second.&quot; The Chinese practice of developing systems of doctrinal classifications (&quot;panjiao&quot;) was adopted by Zhiyi, which he interpreted through the doctrine of the One Vehicle. For Zhiyi, while other sutras provide different messages for their intended audiences, the &quot;Lotus&quot; is uniquely comprehensive and holistic.

Zhiyi&#x27;s philosophical synthesis saw the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; as the final teaching of the Buddha and the highest teaching of Buddhism. There are two major commentaries from Zhiyi on the sutra, the &quot;Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Fahua xuanyi&quot;) which explains the main principles of the text and the &quot;Words and Phrases of the Lotus Sutra&quot; (法華文句 &quot;Fahua Wenzhu&quot;), which comments on specific passages. These two works were compiled by Zhiyi&#x27;s disciple Guanding (561–632). For Zhiyi, the central principle of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;&#x27;s One Vehicle is the &quot;Threefold Truth&quot;, a doctrine he developed out of Nagarjuna&#x27;s Madhyamaka philosophy which posited a twofold truth. For Zhiyi, this was the unifying principle which included all of the teachings of the Buddha&#x27;s teachings and practices. According to Lopez and Stone, Zhiyi&#x27;s view of the &quot;Lotus&quot; was an inclusive vision which had a place for every Buddhist sutra, teaching and practice.

Zhiyi also linked the teachings of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; with the Buddha nature teachings of the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra.&quot; Zhiyi also interpreted the Buddha of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; as referring to all three Buddha bodies of the Trikaya. According to Stone and Teiser, for Zhiyi &quot;the dharma body is the truth that is realized; the reward body is the wisdom that realizes it; and the manifest body, a compassionate expression of that wisdom as the human buddha who lived and taught in this world.&quot; For Zhiyi, Vairocana (the primordial Buddha) is seen as the &quot;bliss body&quot; (&quot;sambhogakāy&quot;a) of the historical Gautama Buddha. Zhiyi also wrote texts which outlined various spiritual practices that made use of the Lotus Sūtra. For example, chanting the sūtra is an element of one of the &quot;Four samādhis&quot; (&quot;sizhǒng sānmèi&quot;) in Zhiyi&#x27;s magnum opus, the &quot;Mohe Zhiguan&quot;. He also composed the &quot;Lotus Samādhi Rite of Repentance&quot; (&quot;Fahua sanmei chanyi&quot;) based on the sūtra.

The later Tiantai scholar Zhanran (711–778) wrote sub-commentaries to Zhiyi&#x27;s works on the &quot;Lotus&quot;. Based on his analysis of chapter 5, Zhanran would develop a new theory which held that even insentient beings such as rocks, trees and dust particles, possess buddha-nature. This doctrine would be adopted and developed by Japanese Buddhists like Saichō and Nichiren. 

==== The Chinese &quot;Threefold Lotus Sūtra&quot; ====

Due to the religious and sacred emphasis on the Buddhist text, some East Asian traditions have compiled the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; together with two other sutras which serve as a prologue and epilogue

* The &quot;Sutra of Innumerable Meanings&quot; (; Japanese: ); and 
* The &quot;Sutra of Meditations of (according to) Samantabhadra&quot; (; Japanese: ).

The combination of these three Sutras is often called the &quot;Threefold Lotus Sūtra&quot; or &quot;Three-Part Dharma Flower Sutra&quot; (; Japanese: ).

=== Japan ===
The &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; has also been an extremely influential text in Japanese Buddhism. One of the oldest Japanese texts is the &quot;Hokke Gisho&quot;, a commentary on the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; based on the Chinese commentary by Fayun (467–529 CE). By the 8th century, the sūtra was important enough that the emperor had established a network of nunneries, the so-called &quot;Temples for the Eradication of Sins through the &quot;Lotus&quot;&quot; (&quot;Hokke metsuzai no tera&quot;), in each province, as a way to protect the royal family and the state. There were also various &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; rituals that were held throughout Japan, at both temples and aristocratic households. They were believed to help the dead and to grant long life to the living. These rituals are mentioned in &quot;The Tale of Genji.&quot; The sūtra was also very influential on Japanese art and some copies of the text are highly elaborate and ornate.

==== Tendai ====
The Tiantai school was brought to Japan by Saichō (767–822), who founded the Japanese Tendai tradition and wrote a commentary to the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;, which would remain central to Tendai. Saichō attempted to create a great synthesis of the various Chinese Buddhist traditions in his new Tendai school (including esoteric, Pure Land, Zen and other elements), all which would be united under the Lotus One Vehicle doctrine. Saichō also understood the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; to be a &quot;great direct path&quot; to Buddhahood which could be reached in this very life and in this very body. Saichō taught that the Dragon king&#x27;s daughter story was evidence for this direct path (&quot;jikidō&quot;) to Buddhahod which did not require three incalculable eons.

Like Zhiyi, the Japanese Tendai school (as well as the Nichiren tradition which is influenced by Tendai) divided the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; into two parts, the trace or provisional teachings (&quot;shaku-mon&quot;, Chapters 1–14) and the essential teaching (&quot;hon-mon&quot;, Chapters 15–22) of the true and original Buddha.

Post-Saichō Tendai leaders like Ennin and Enchin also adopted further teachings from Esoteric Buddhism (&quot;mikkyō)&quot; into their interpretation and practice of the &quot;Lotus&quot;. These figures interpreted the &quot;Lotus&quot; as an esoteric text, and the Buddha of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; became seen as timeless and omnipresent cosmic reality that is immanent in all things. By reciting mantras, performing mudras and using mandalas in esoteric rituals, Tendai monks sought to unite their body, speech and mind with that of the Buddha and attain &quot;Buddhahood in this very body&quot; (&quot;sokushin jōbutsu&quot;). According to Jacqueline Stone, in Tendai esotericism, &quot;the cosmic buddha is identified with the primordially enlightened Sakyamuni of the &quot;Life Span&quot; chapter, and his realm—that is, the entire universe—is conceived in mandalic terms as an ever-present, ongoing &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; assembly.&quot;

As a result of this interpretation, all the provisional Buddhas (such as Amida, Dainichi, and Yakushi) were integrated into the Primordial Buddha of immeasurable life from the latter half of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;. These esoteric influences also led to the development of the Tendai concept of original enlightenment (&quot;hongaku hōmon&quot;). According to this theory, Buddhahood is not a distant goal, but is always present as the true inherent nature of all things. Buddhist practice is a way to realize this nature.

Apart from the major Heian period Tendai temples, there also arose groups of independent &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; devotees (&quot;jikyōsha&quot;) or &quot;Lotus holy ones&quot; (&quot;hokke hijiri&quot;). Many of them were mountain ascetics, or recluses (&quot;tonsei&quot;) who disliked the large established temples and saw them as more concerned with worldly gain. They focused instead on practices based on the simple recitation, listening or reading of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; in solitary places (&quot;bessho&quot;), something which did not require temples and ritual paraphernalia. Hokke hijiri also engaged in esoteric &quot;taimitsu&quot; and Daoist immortality practices. These figures feature prominently in the &quot;Hokke Genki&quot;, a collection of &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; stories and miracles by the priest Chingen, which sees the hokke hijiri as being superior to aristocrats or traditional monks.

Tendai Buddhism was the dominant form of mainstream Buddhism in Japan for many years and the influential founders of later popular Japanese Buddhist sects including Nichiren, Honen, Shinran and Dogen were trained as Tendai monks.

==== Nichiren Buddhism ====
The Japanese monk Nichiren (1222–1282) founded a new Buddhist school based on his belief that the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; is &quot;the Buddha&#x27;s ultimate teaching&quot;, and that the title is the essence of the sutra, &quot;the seed of Buddhahood&quot;. He was originally a Tendai monk, but grew to believe that Tendai had become corrupt and had turned away from the Lotus Sūtra and embraced all sorts of useless practices, such as esoteric Buddhism and Pure Land devotionalism. Nichiren taught that chanting the title of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; in a phrase called the daimoku (&quot;Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō,&quot; &quot;Glory to the Dharma of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;&quot;) or (Basic translation: Devotion to the Mystic Law of Cause and Effect through Sound). – was the only effective Buddhist practice in what he believed was the current degenerate age of Dharma decline (Skt. &quot;saddharmavipralopa&quot;, Jp. &quot;mappo&quot;). This was to be recited in front of a gohonzon (&quot;object of veneration&quot;). According to Stone, Nichiren believed that &quot;the immanent Buddha realm is an ever-present reality&quot; which one could access by this practice.

Nichiren held that current Buddhist sects were gravely mistaken and doomed to Avīci hell because they &quot;slandered the true Dharma&quot; (Skt. &quot;saddharmapratiksepa&quot;; Jp. &quot;hōbō&quot;) by seeing other teachings as being above or equal to the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;. He also held that the current social and political chaos in Japan was caused by this misbelief. He therefore tasked himself and his followers with informing as many people as possible by refuting the provisional teachings and encouraging them to abandon their misconceptions of Buddhism through personal engagement (&quot;shakubuku&quot;) and directing them to the one vehicle of the &quot;Lotus&quot;. He believed that establishing the true Dharma of the &quot;Lotus&quot; in Japan would lead to lasting peace and he identified with the Bodhisattva Viśiṣṭacāritra (Superior Practices), leader of the bodhisattvas of the earth which appear in chapter 15.

Nichiren thus vehemently debated the teachings of all other Japanese Buddhist sects in person and in print. This behavior would often lead to persecution. It was when he saw his own followers being persecuted that he decided it was time to establish the true teachings and inscribed the Dai Gohonzon for all humanity. Nichiren saw this persecution as a compassionate act of self-sacrifice, which needed to be endured. He found this ideal in chapters 10–22 as the &quot;third realm&quot; of the Lotus Sutra (&quot;daisan hōmon&quot;) which emphasizes the need for a bodhisattva to endure the trials of life in the defiled &quot;sahā&quot; world. For Nichiren, these trials and tribulations were termed &quot;shikidoku&quot; (&quot;reading [the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;] with the body&quot;) and they were believed to lesson karmic retribution. Nichiren Buddhism went through various developments and schisms after the death of Nichiren. Nichiren prophesied this misconstruction and that&#x27;s why he always emphasized to his disciples to &quot;always follow the Law and not the person.&quot; The Law (Nam Myoho Renge Kyo) is absolute, whereas the person is relative.

==== Zen Buddhism ====
The &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; was also a key source for Dōgen (1200–1253), the Japanese founder of Sōtō Zen Buddhism. Dōgen writes in his &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot; that &quot;compared with this sūtra, all the other sūtras are merely its servants, its relatives, for it alone expounds the truth.&quot; According to Taigen Dan Leighton, &quot;While Dogen&#x27;s writings employ many sources, probably along with his own intuitive meditative awareness, his direct citations of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; indicate his conscious appropriation of its teachings as a significant source&quot; and that his writing &quot;demonstrates that Dogen himself saw the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;, &#x27;expounded by all buddhas in the three times,&#x27; as an important source for this self-proclamatory rhetorical style of expounding.&quot;

In his &quot;Shōbōgenzō,&quot; Dogen directly discusses the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; in the essay &quot;Hokke-Ten-Hokke&quot;, &quot;The Dharma Flower Turns the Dharma Flower&quot;. The essay uses a dialogue from the Platform Sutra between Huineng and a monk who has memorized the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; to illustrate the non-dual nature of Dharma practice and sutra study. During his final days, Dogen spent his time reciting and writing the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; in his room which he named &quot;The Lotus Sutra Hermitage&quot;. The Soto Zen monk Ryōkan also studied the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; extensively and this sutra was the biggest inspiration for his poetry and calligraphy.

The Rinzai Zen master Hakuin Ekaku (1687–1768) achieved enlightenment while reading the third chapter of the Lotus Sūtra. Hakuin writes that when he first read the sutra at age sixteen, he was disappointed with it. However, sixteen years later, after experiencing an awakening, he wrote, “One night, after some time, I took up the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;. Suddenly I penetrated to the perfect, true, ultimate meaning of the Lotus. The doubts I had held initially were destroyed and I became aware that the understanding I had obtained up to then was greatly in error. Unconsciously I uttered a great cry and burst into tears.”

==== Modern developments ====
According to Shields, modernist Japanese interpretations of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; begin with the early 20th century nationalist applications of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; by Chigaku Tanaka, Nissho Honda, Seno&#x27;o, and Nisshō Inoue. Japanese new religions began forming in the 19th century and the trend accelerated after World War II. Some of these groups have pushed the study and practice of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; to a global scale. 

According to scholar Jacqueline Stone, Soka Gakkai generally follows an exclusivist approach to the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;, believing that only Nichiren Buddhism can bring world peace. Sōkka Gakkai no longer teaches the differences between the two gates or &quot;divisions&quot; of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;. Instead, the modern organization teaches that only the sincere recitation of the daimoku is the &quot;Doctrine of Essential Teaching&quot; and that this does not require any clerical priesthood or temples since the true sangha comprises all people &quot;who believe in the Buddha Dharma of Nichiren&quot;.

Meanwhile, Risshō Kōsei Kai follows an ecumenical, and inclusive approach and is known for its interfaith efforts and focus on world peace. According to its co-founder Niwano Nikkyō (1906–1999), &quot;&quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; is not a proper noun, but the fundamental truth—God, Allah, or the one vehicle—at the heart of all great religions.&quot;

In a similar fashion, Etai Yamada (1900–1999), the 253rd head priest of the Tendai denomination conducted ecumenical dialogues with religious leaders around the world based on his inclusive interpretation of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;, which culminated in a 1987 summit. He also used the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; to move his sect from a &quot;temple Buddhism&quot; perspective to one based on social engagement. Nichiren-inspired Buddhist organizations have shared their interpretations of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; through publications, academic symposia, and exhibitions.

=== In the West ===
One of the first mentions of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; by a westerner can be found in the work of the Catholic missionary Matteo Ricci. In his &quot;The True Doctrine of the Lord of Heaven&quot; (&quot;Tianzhu shiyi&quot;), published in 1603, Ricci mentions the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; and denounces its teaching.

==== 19th century ====
Eugene Burnouf&#x27;s &quot;Introduction à l&#x27;histoire du Buddhisme indien&quot; (1844) marks the start of modern academic scholarship of Buddhism in the West. According to Lopez, this tome &quot;seems to have been originally intended to aid readers in understanding the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;,&quot; the translation of which Burnouf had completed in 1839. Burnouf decided to delay the publication of this translation so that he could write an introduction to it, that is, his 1844 &quot;Introduction&quot;. Burnouf&#x27;s French translation of a Nepalese Sanskrit manuscript of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;, titled &quot;Le Lotus de la bonne loi traduit du Sanscrit accompagné d’un commentaire et de vingt et un mémoires relatifs au Buddhisme&quot;, was published posthumously in 1852.

Burnouf really appreciated the &quot;parables&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;aupamya&quot;, &quot;comparisons&quot;, &quot;analogies&quot;, more accurately described as allegories) found in the &quot;Lotus&quot;, which reminded him of the parables of the New Testament. He would write &quot;I know of nothing so Christian in all of Asia&quot; and saw the &quot;Lotus&quot; as containing a &quot;moral Christianity, full of compassion for all creatures.&quot; He also understood the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; (as well as other Mahayana works) to be later, more &quot;developed&quot; texts than the &quot;simple&quot; earlier sutras which contained more historical content and less metaphysical ideas.

A chapter of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; was published in 1844, prior to Burnouf&#x27;s translation being published. This chapter was published in the journal &quot;The Dial&quot;, a publication of the New England transcendentalists, and had been translated from French to English by Elizabeth Palmer Peabody. This chapter was the first English version of any Buddhist scripture.

An English translation of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; from two Sanskrit manuscripts copied in Nepal around the 11th century was completed by Hendrik Kern in 1884 and published as &quot;Saddharma-Pundarîka, or, the Lotus of the True Law&quot; as part of the Sacred Books of the East project.

Western interest in the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; waned in the latter 19th century as Indo-centric scholars focused on older Pali and Sanskrit texts. However, Christian missionaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, based predominantly in China, became interested in Kumārajīva&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;. These scholars attempted to draw parallels between the Old and New Testaments to earlier Nikaya sutras and the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;. Abbreviated and &quot;Christianized&quot; translations were published by Richard and Soothill.

==== 20th century translations ====
After the Second World War, scholarly attention to the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; was inspired by renewed interest in Japanese Buddhism as well as archeological research in Dunhuang in Gansu, China. In 1976, Leon Hurvitz published &quot;The Scripture of the Lotus Blossom of the Fine Dharma,&quot; a scholarly English translation of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; based on Kumarajiva&#x27;s Chinese. Whereas the Hurvitz work was independent scholarship, other modern translations were sponsored by Japanese Buddhist institutions. For example, the 1975 Bunno Kato and Yoshiro Tamura translation of the &quot;Threefold Lotus Sutra&quot; was promoted by Rissho-kosei-kai, the Burton Watson translation was backed by Soka Gakkai and the Tsugunari Kubo and Akira Yuyama translation was sponsored by Bukkyō Dendō Kyōkai (&quot;Society for the Promotion of Buddhism&quot;).

Translations into French, Spanish and German are also based on Kumarajiva&#x27;s Chinese text. Each of these translations incorporate different approaches and styles that range from complex to simplified.

== Lotus Sūtra practice ==

According to Gene Reeves, &quot;the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; frequently advocates concrete practices, which are often related to the sutra itself. They are often given as sets of four to six practices, but include receiving and embracing the sutra, hearing it, reading and reciting it, remembering it correctly, copying it, explaining it, understanding its meaning, pondering it, proclaiming it, practicing as it teaches, honoring it, protecting it, making offerings to it, preaching it and teaching it to others, and leading others to do any of these things.&quot; The Sūtra also promotes the building of stūpas wherever the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; is being preached.

The &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; also mentions the six paramitas and the eightfold path. Other passages from the sutra have been seen as promoting certain ways of living. For example, the story of Never Disrespectful Bodhisattva in chapter 20 has been seen by some as teaching that we should see all beings as potential Buddhas and treat them accordingly. Similarly, other parts of the sutra have been interpreted as exhortations to share the Dharma of the &quot;Lotus&quot; with other people.

=== In East Asia ===

The sūtra became an extremely important text for religious practice in East Asian Buddhism, especially through ritualized devotional practice. A particularly important set of practices are the &quot;five practices of the preacher of the dharma&quot; (found in Chapter 19), which are preserving (or &quot;upholding&quot;), reading, reciting, explaining, and copying the sūtra.

According to Daniel Stevenson, &quot;upholding the sutra,&quot; &quot;does not connote a specific regimen of practice but functions as a generic designation for &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; devotion in all its guises, above all devotion that is focused and sustained.&quot; Thus, it is a general term for enthusiastic embrace of the sutra. The term derived from the Sanskrit root &quot;dhr,&quot; related to dharani and could refer to the memorization and retention of the teaching as well as to the more abstract &quot;apprehension&quot; of the Dharma in meditative states of samadhi. It could also refer to the storing, enshrining and safekeeping of the physical copies of the sutra.

It was said that these practices were very meritorious and could lead to miracles. Stories dealing with &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; miracles, such as Huixiang&#x27;s &quot;Accounts of the Propagation of the Lotus Sūtra&quot; (c. 7th century) became a popular genre in China and Japan. The popularity of these practices can be seen from the fact that a thousand copies of the text were sealed in the Dunhuang caves in the 11th century. The &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; was also one of the most widely memorized Buddhist texts, a practice which became a requirement for Buddhist monastic ordination at various points throughout Chinese history.

These practices were often sponsored by Asian states as a way to protect the nation but they were also carried out by people from all social classes. Ritualized recitation, copying of the text and lectures explaining the Lotus Sūtra were performed at temples, shrines, and private residences. It was believed that these practices generated many benefits, from spiritual benefits like visions of Buddhas, rebirth in a pure land, awakening, and helping deceased relatives, to worldly benefits like peace, healing and protection from harm. In a similar fashion, the creation of different forms of visual, plastic, calligraphic, performance arts based on the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; also came to be seen as a form of spiritual practice and a skillful means. The production of these works, which included &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; manuscripts themselves, could become highly ritualized processes. Likewise, the telling of miracle stories and composition of literature based on the Lotus Sūtra was also seen as another way to practice its teachings.

In China, the practice extracted from chapter 20 of seeing all beings as Buddhas or &quot;universal veneration&quot; (pujing 普敬) was adopted as the main practice of Xinxing (540–594) &quot;Three Stages Movement&quot;. Meanwhile, the self immolation of bodhisattva Medicine King inspired a controversial tradition of cremating parts of one&#x27;s body as a kind of devotion. Chapter 25 has also been very influential on Asian Guanyin (觀音) devotionalism.

The chanting of the &quot;Lotus&quot; was and remains widely practiced in Chinese Buddhism. It is often accompanied by the wooden fish instrument and preceded by various ritual acts, invocations, offerings and visualizations. The works of the Tiantai master Zhiyi include various &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; based practices like the &quot;Lotus samādhi&quot; and the &quot;Rite of Repentance for the Lotus Samādhi&quot;. Zhiyi was also said to have memorized the entire Threefold &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;. Zongxiao (1151–1214) mentions a practice which consisted in performing one or three prostrations for every character of the sutra.

In the Japanese Tendai school, the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; is an important part of Taimitsu (&quot;Tendai esotericism&quot;) where it is part of certain rituals, such as the &quot;Lotus rite&quot; (&quot;Hokke ho&quot;), &quot;performed to eradicate sin, build merit, and realize awakening.&quot; According to Stone and Teiser, &quot;the mandala used in this ritual depicts the two buddhas Sakyamuni and Many Jewels seated together in its central court, as they appeared in the jeweled stūpa of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra.&quot;&quot;

In Nichiren Buddhism, the central practice is the recitation of the title of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;, called the &quot;daimoku.&quot; This formula is &quot;Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō&quot;. Nichiren Buddhists believe that this phrase contains the meaning of the entire sutra and contains and supersedes all other Buddhist practices (which are seen as provisional and no longer effective). By chanting this phrase with faith, one is said to be able to achieve Buddhahood. Nichiren Buddhists often chant this phrase while facing a &quot;great mandala&quot; (&quot;daimandara&quot;), or &quot;revered object of worship&quot; (&quot;gohonzon&quot;), a practice that was promoted by Nichiren himself. Nichiren believed that chanting while contemplating the gohonzon allowed to enter the mandala of the Lotus assembly.

== In East Asian culture ==
The &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; has had a great impact on East Asian literature, art, and folklore for over 1400 years. James Shields of Bucknell University remarked that, with regard to cultural influence, the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; &quot;plays a role equivalent to the Bible in Europe or the Qur’an in the Middle East.&quot;

=== Art ===
Various events from the sutra are depicted in religious art. Wang argues that the explosion of art inspired by the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;, starting from the 7th and 8th centuries in China, was a confluence of text and the topography of the Chinese medieval mind in which the latter dominated.

Motifs from the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; figure prominently in the Dunhuang caves built in the Sui era. In the fifth century, the scene of Shakyamuni and Prabhutaratna Buddhas seated together as depicted in the 11th chapter of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; became arguably the most popular theme in Chinese Buddhist art. Examples can be seen in a bronze plaque (year 686) at Hase-dera Temple in Japan and, in Korea, at Dabotap and Seokgatap Pagodas, built in 751, at Bulguksa Temple.

=== Literature ===
Tamura refers to the &quot;&quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; literary genre.&quot; Its ideas and images are writ large in great works of Chinese and Japanese literature such as &quot;The Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; and &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;. The &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; has had an outsized influence on Japanese Buddhist poetry. Far more poems have been &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;-inspired than other sutras. In the work &quot;Kanwa taisho myoho renge-kyo&quot;, a compendium of more than 120 collections of poetry from the Heian period, there are more than 1360 poems with references to the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; in just their titles.

According to Gene Reeves, &quot;Japan&#x27;s greatest twentieth-century storyteller and poet, Kenji Miyazawa, became devoted to the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;, writing to his father on his own deathbed that all he ever wanted to do was share the teachings of this sutra with others.&quot; Miyazawa implicitly references the sutra in his writings.

=== Theater ===
According to Jacqueline Stone and Stephen Teiser &quot;the Noh drama and other forms of medieval Japanese literature interpreted Chapter 5, &quot;Medicinal Herbs&quot;, as teaching the potential for buddhahood in grasses and trees (&quot;sōmoku jōbutsu&quot;).&quot;

=== Folklore ===
The &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; has inspired a branch of folklore based on figures in the sutra or subsequent people who have embraced it. The story of the Dragon King&#x27;s daughter, who attained enlightenment in the 12th (Devadatta) chapter of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;, appears in the &quot;Complete Tale of Avalokiteśvara and the Southern Seas&quot; and the &quot;Precious Scroll of Sudhana and Longnü&quot; folkstories. The &quot;Miraculous Tales of the Lotus Sutra&quot; is a collection of 129 stories with folklore motifs based on &quot;Buddhist pseudo-biographies.&quot;

=== Pilgrimage ===
In the Kongō Range surrounding Osaka, Japan, the Katsuragi 28 Shuku is a series of sutra mounds corresponding to each of the twenty-eight chapters of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;. According to legend, each chapter of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; was buried in a separate location by En no Gyoja, the mythical 7th-century founder of Shugendō.

<text>The shmoo (plural: shmoos, also shmoon) is a fictional cartoon creature created by Al Capp (1909–1979); the character first appeared in the comic strip &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; on August 31, 1948. The character created a fad that lasted into the 1950s, including merchandise, songs, fan clubs, and appearances on magazine covers. The parable of the shmoo has been interpreted in many different ways, both at the time and in later analysis. 
==Origins==
Al Capp offered his version of the origin of the Shmoo in a wryly satirical article, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like Shmoos&quot;, in &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; (June 1949):

Capp introduced many other allegorical creatures in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; over the years—including Bald Iggles, Kigmies, Nogoodniks, Mimikniks, the Money Ha-Ha, Shminks, Abominable Snow-Hams, Gobbleglops, Shtunks and Bashful Bulganiks, among others. Each one highlighted another disquieting facet of human nature—but none have ever had quite the same cultural impact as the Shmoo. According to publisher Denis Kitchen: &quot;For the rest of his career Capp got countless letters [from] people begging him to bring the Shmoo back. Periodically he would do it but each time it ended the same way—with the Shmoo being too good for humanity, and he had to essentially exterminate them again. But there was always one or two who would survive for future plot twists...&quot;

===Etymology===
The origin of Capp&#x27;s word &quot;shmoo&quot; has been the subject of linguistic consideration by scholars for decades.

It has been speculated by that &quot;shmoo&quot; was a thinly veiled phallic symbol, and that the name derives from Yiddish &quot;schmuck&quot; (&quot;schmo&quot;) meaning ‘male genitalia’ or a ‘fool, contemptuous person’ (Arthur Asa Berger and Allan H. Orrick of Johns Hopkins). Even prior to these two academics, Thomas Pyles (U. Florida) had favored the &quot;shmuck&quot; etymology over the derivation from the Yiddish &quot;schmu&quot; (‘profit’), suggested by Leo Spitzer.

Spitzer noted the shmoo&#x27;s providential characteristics (providing eggs and milk) in arguing his hypothesis, further explaining that in Yiddish &quot;schmu&quot; specifically connoted &quot;illicit profit&quot;, and that the word also giving rise to term &quot;schmus&quot; ‘tale, gossip’, whose verb form &quot;schmusen&quot; or ‘shmoosing’ (schmooze) has become familiar even to non-Jews. Lilian Mermin Feinsilver assessed this association with &quot;shmu&quot; ‘illicit profit’ as &quot;pertinent&quot;, together with the observation that &quot;shmue&quot; was a taboo Yiddish term for the uterus.

It is one of many Yiddish slang variations that would find their way into &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;. Revealing an important key to the story, Al Capp wrote that the Shmoo metaphorically represented the limitless bounty of the Earth in all its richness—in essence, Mother Nature herself. In Li&#x27;l Abner&#x27;s words, &quot;Shmoos &quot;hain&#x27;t&quot; make believe. The hull [whole] earth is one!!&quot;

==Analysis==
&quot;Capp is at his allegorical best in the epics of the Shmoos, and later, the Kigmies&quot;, wrote comic strip historian Jerry Robinson (in &quot;The Comics: An Illustrated History of Comic Strip Art&quot;, 1974). &quot;Shmoos are the world&#x27;s most amiable creatures, supplying all man&#x27;s needs. Like a fertility myth gone berserk, they reproduced so prodigiously they threatened to wreck the economy&quot;—if not western civilization as we know it, and ultimately society itself.

Superficially, the Shmoo story concerns a cuddly creature that desires nothing more than to be a boon to humans. Although initially Capp denied or avoided discussion of any satirical intentions (&quot;If the Shmoo fits&quot;, he proclaimed, &quot;wear it!&quot;), he was widely seen to be using clever subtext. The story has social, ethical, and philosophical implications that continue to invite analysis into the 21st Century. During the remainder of his life, Capp was seldom interviewed without reference to the nature of the Shmoo story.

The mythic tale ends on a deliberately ironic note. Shmoos are officially declared a menace, and systematically hunted down and slaughtered—because they were deemed &quot;bad for business&quot;. The much-copied story line was a parable that was interpreted in many different ways at the outset of the Cold War. Al Capp was even invited to go on a radio show to debate socialist Norman Thomas on the effect of the Shmoo on modern capitalism.

&quot;After it came out both the left and the right attacked the Shmoo&quot;, according to publisher Denis Kitchen. &quot;Communists thought he was making fun of socialism and Marxism. The right wing thought he was making fun of capitalism and the American way. Capp caught flak from both sides. For him it was an apolitical morality tale about human nature... I think [the Shmoo] was one of those bursts of genius. He was a genius, there&#x27;s no question about that.&quot;

==Reception==
The Shmoo inspired hundreds of &quot;Shmoo clubs&quot; all over North America. College students—who had made Capp&#x27;s invented idea of the Sadie Hawkins dance a universally adopted tradition—flocked to the Shmoo as well. One school, the University of Bridgeport, even launched the &quot;American Society for the Advancement of the Shmoo&quot; in early 1949.

==Licensing history==
An unexpected—and virtually unprecedented—postwar merchandising phenomenon followed Capp&#x27;s introduction of the Shmoo in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;. As in the strip, shmoos suddenly appeared to be everywhere in 1949 and 1950—including a &quot;Time&quot; cover story. They also garnered nearly a full page of coverage (under &quot;Economics&quot;) in the &quot;Time&quot; International section. Major articles also ran in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, and countless other publications and newspapers. Virtually overnight, as a &quot;Life&quot; headline put it, &quot;The U.S. Becomes Shmoo-Struck!&quot;

===Toys and consumer products===

Shmoo dolls, clocks, watches, jewelry, earmuffs, wallpaper, fishing lures, air fresheners, soap, ice cream, balloons, ashtrays, toys, games, Halloween masks, salt and pepper shakers, decals, pinbacks, tumblers, coin banks, greeting cards, planters, neckties, suspenders, belts, curtains, fountain pens, and other shmoo paraphernalia were produced. A garment factory in Baltimore turned out a whole line of shmoo apparel, including &quot;Shmooveralls&quot;. In 1948, people danced to the Shmoo Rhumba and the Shmoo Polka. The Shmoo briefly entered everyday language through such phrases as &quot;What&#x27;s Shmoo?&quot; and &quot;Happy Shmoo Year!&quot;

Close to a hundred licensed shmoo products from 75 different manufacturers were produced in less than a year, some of which sold five million units each. In a single year, shmoo merchandise generated more than $25 million in sales in 1948 dollars (equivalent to $ million in ).

The Shmoo was so popular it even replaced Walt Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse as the face of the Children&#x27;s Savings Bond, issued by the U.S. Treasury Department in 1949. The valid document was colorfully illustrated with Capp&#x27;s character, and promoted by the Federal Government of the United States with a $16 million advertising campaign budget. According to one article at the time, the Shmoo showed &quot;Thrift, loyalty, trust, duty, truth, and common &quot;cents&quot; [that] add up to aid to his nation&quot;. Al Capp accompanied President Harry S. Truman at the bond&#x27;s unveiling ceremony.

===Comic books and reprints===
&quot;The Life and Times of the Shmoo&quot; (1948), a paperback collection of the original sequence, was a bestseller for Simon &amp; Schuster and became the first cartoon book to achieve serious literary attention. Distributed to small town magazine racks, it sold 700,000 copies in its first year of publication alone. It was reviewed coast to coast alongside Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s &quot;Crusade in Europe&quot; (the other big publication at the time).

The original book and its sequel, &quot;The Return of the Shmoo&quot; (1959), have been collected in print many times since—most recently in 2002—always to high sales figures.

There was also a separate line of comic books, &quot;Al Capp&#x27;s Shmoo Comics&quot; (featuring Washable Jones), published by the Capp family-owned Toby Press. Comics historian and &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; expert Denis Kitchen recently edited a complete collection of all five original &quot;Shmoo Comics&quot;, from 1949 and 1950. The book was published by Dark Horse Comics in 2008. Kitchen edited a second Shmoo-related volume for Dark Horse in 2011, on the history of the character in newspaper strips, collectibles, and memorabilia.

===Animation and puppetry===
Originally, shmoos were meant to be included in the 1956 Broadway &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; musical, employing stage puppetry. Reportedly, the idea was abandoned in the development stage by the producers, however, for reasons of practicality. A variation of the character had appeared earlier as a marionette puppet on television. &quot;Shmoozer&quot;, a talking shmoo with an anthropomorphic human body, was a recurring sidekick character on &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot;, a short-lived puppet series that aired on NBC-TV in 1952.

After Capp&#x27;s death in 1979, the Shmoo gained its own animated series as part of &quot;Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo&quot;, which consisted of reruns of &quot;The New Fred and Barney Show&quot; mixed with the Shmoo&#x27;s own cartoons; despite the title the two sets of characters didn&#x27;t directly &quot;meet&quot; within the show. The characters &quot;did&quot; meet, however, in the early 1980s Flintstones spin-off &quot;The Flintstone Comedy Show&quot;. The Shmoo appeared, incongruously, in the segment &quot;Bedrock Cops&quot; as a police officer alongside part-time officers Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble. Needless to add, this Shmoo had little relationship to the &quot;L&#x27;il Abner&quot; character, other than a superficial appearance. A later Hanna-Barbera venture, &quot;The New Shmoo&quot;, featured the character as an (inexplicably) shape-shifting mascot of Mighty Mysteries Comics, a group of teens who solve &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;-like mysteries. In this series the Shmoo could metamorphose magically into any shape at will — like &quot;Tom Terrific&quot;. None of these revisionist revivals of the venerable character was particularly successful.

==In popular culture==
* Frank Sinatra, who was frequently spoofed by Al Capp in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, has a line in the MGM musical &quot;On the Town&quot; (1949) about cops &quot;multiplyin&#x27; like shmoos!&quot;
* Florence King refers to owning a ceramic shmoo, which she threw out of her window after reading the books of Ayn Rand.
* In the 1990 movie &quot;Book of Love&quot;, the character Crutch wins a stuffed shmoo at a carnival.
* In the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; television episode &quot;Who Knew?&quot;, Colonel Potter (played by Harry Morgan) displays an inflatable shmoo toy in his office that he purchased for his grandson.
* In Larry Niven&#x27;s &quot;Known Space&quot; stories, an alien species known as the Bandersnatch, also edible and intelligent, is described as being &quot;smooth as a shmoo&quot;.
* In the novel &quot;The Forge of God&quot; by Greg Bear, &quot;Shmoo&quot; is the name humans give to the race of robots that visits Earth, due to their similar shape.
* Some overlapping similarities exist between shmoos and tribbles—the multitudinous alien creatures featured in a 1967 television episode from the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Like shmoos, tribbles &quot;also&quot; reproduced at such an alarming rate, they threatened ecological disaster. However, David Gerrold—who wrote &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;—drew his inspiration from an historical event: Australia&#x27;s environmentally destructive rabbit overpopulation.
* The characters Gleep and Gloop—two protoplastic creatures from the Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning animated cartoon series &quot;The Herculoids&quot;—were clearly inspired by (and are sometimes mistaken for) shmoos.
* French artists Etienne Chambaud and David Jourdan have written &quot;Economie de l&#x27;abondance ou La courte vie et les jours heureux&quot;, a new adventure of &quot;Jacques le fataliste et son maître&quot; from Diderot, based on the discovery by Jacques of the Shmoo.
* In the 2006 film &quot;Lucky Number Slevin&quot;, the character known only as &quot;The Boss&quot; (played by Morgan Freeman) refers to the Shmoo, recounting its original features as a source of plenty (in a monologue taken from an old &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; comic).
* The Marxist political philosopher Gerald Cohen used the story of the Shmoo to illustrate his objections to capitalism in an episode of &quot;Opinions&quot;.
* &quot;The Simpsons&quot; uses a statue of the Shmoo to replace the giant phallic statue from the film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; in the episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror XXV&quot;.
* The Shmoo is featured in &quot;Bedrock Cops&quot; as a friend and partner of Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble.
* In all non-Japanese versions of the video game &quot;&quot;, there is an enemy monster called &quot;Schmoo&quot;, an homage to the Shmoo. (In the original Japanese version, the monster is instead an &quot;obake&quot; called &quot;Kyuu,&quot; an homage to the protagonist of the manga &quot;Obake no Q-tarō&quot;.) Schmoos appear in the Forbidden Library and they have a rare chance of dropping the Crissaegrim upon death, one of the most powerful weapons in the game.
* During the Soviet Union&#x27;s blockade of West Berlin, Germany in 1948, candy-filled shmoos were air-dropped to hungry West Berliners from transport planes by America&#x27;s 17th Military Airport Squadron. The commanders of the Berlin airlift had cabled Capp, requesting the inflatable shmoos as part of Operation: Little Vittles. &quot;When the candy-chocked shmoos were dropped, a near-riot resulted...&quot;
* Shmoos invaded the 1948 presidential election, as challenger Thomas Dewey accused incumbent Harry S. Truman of &quot;promising everything, including the Shmoo!&quot;
* Capp periodically reintroduced the Shmoos in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, sometimes with significant variations. &quot;Bad&quot; Shmoos (called &quot;Nogoodniks&quot;) debuted in a series of Sunday strips in 1949. The nasty cousin of the good-natured Shmoo, Nogoodniks were a sickly shade of green, and had &quot;li&#x27;l red eyes, sharp yaller teeth, an&#x27; a dirty look&quot;. Frequently sporting 5 o&#x27;clock shadows, eye patches, scars, bandages, and other ruffian attributes—they devoured &quot;good&quot; Shmoos, were the sworn enemies of &quot;hoomanity&quot;, and wreaked havoc on Dogpatch.
* In the ABC sitcom &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, Beverley Goldberg endearingly refers to her children as Shmoos.
* The product of artist Mark Gonzale, Adidas sells a version of its Trefoil logo (termed the Shmoofoil), that is patterned after the Shmoo.

==Eponyms==

The term &quot;shmoo&quot; has entered the English language, defining highly technical concepts in at least four separate fields of science:
* &quot;Shmoo plot&quot; is a technical term relating to the graphical display of test results in electrical engineering, dating back at least to 1966. The name most likely arose because the shape of the two-dimensional plots often resembled a shmoo. The term is also a verb: to &quot;shmoo&quot; means to run the test.
* In microbiology, the shmoo&#x27;s uncanny resemblance to budding yeast—combined with its near-limitless usefulness—has led to the character&#x27;s adoption as a mascot of sorts for scientists studying yeast as a model organism for genetics and cell biology. In fact, the cellular bulge that is produced by a haploid yeast cell as a response to a pheromone from the opposite mating type (either or α-factor) is referred to as a &quot;shmoo&quot;, because cells that are undergoing mating and present this particular structure resemble the cartoon character. The whole process is known to biologists as &quot;shmooing&quot;. Shmoos are essential; without them, we would have neither bread nor beer. The word &quot;shmoo&quot; has appeared in nearly 700 science publications since 1974; it is used in labs studying the bread- and beer-making species &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;.
* Echinoderm biologists use &quot;shmoo&quot; (often misspelled &quot;schmoo&quot;) to refer to a very simple, highly derived, blob-shaped larva found in some sea urchins (e.g. Wray 1996).
* The Mouse Head Mesemb, &quot;Muiria hortensae&quot;, a monotypic genus of succulent plant in the Aizoaceae, is also known as the Shmoo Plant. It is native to a small area of the Succulent Karoo of South Africa.
* In bird collections, skin specimens prepared without bills are often called &quot;shmoos&quot;.
* It has been used in discussions of socioeconomics, for instance. In economics, a &quot;widget&quot; is any material good that is produced through labor (extracted, refined, manufactured, or assembled) from a finite resource—in contrast to a &quot;shmoo&quot;, which is a material good that reproduces itself and is captured or bred as an economic activity (the original shmoo lives and reproduces without requiring any material sustenance). &quot;If shmoos really existed, they would be a &#x27;free good&#x27;.&quot; Erik Olin Wright uses the &quot;parable of the shmoo&quot; to introduce discussion of class structure and economics.
* In the field of particle physics, &quot;shmoo&quot; refers to a high energy cosmic ray survey instrument used at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for the Cygnus X-3 Sky Survey performed at the LAMPF (Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility) grounds. At one time, more than one hundred white &quot;shmoo&quot; detectors were sprinkled around the accelerator beamstop area and adjacent mesa to capture subatomic cosmic ray particles emitted from the Cygnus constellation. The detectors housed scintillators and photomultipliers in an array that gave the detector its distinctive shmoo shape. The particle accelerator Tevatron at Fermilab houses superconducting magnets that produce ice formations that also resembled shmoos.
* In medicine, the &quot;Shmoo sign&quot; refers to the appearance of a prominent, rounded left ventricle and dilated aorta on a plain AP chest radiograph, giving the appearance of a Shmoo.
Applied conversely, the shmoo has been cited as a hypothetical example of the potential falsifiability of natural selection as a key driving mechanism of biological evolution. That is, such a poorly adapted species could not possibly evolve via natural selection, so if it were to exist, it would falsify the theory.

<text>The Obfuscated Perl Contest was a competition for programmers of Perl which was held annually between 1996 and 2000. Entrants to the competition aimed to write &quot;devious, inhuman, disgusting, amusing, amazing, and bizarre Perl code&quot;. It was run by &quot;The Perl Journal&quot; and took its name from the International Obfuscated C Code Contest.

== Contest ==
The entries were judged on aesthetics, output and incomprehensibility. One entrant per year received the &quot;Best of Show&quot; award.
Entrants were advised to try and demonstrate a range of Perl knowledge, while being humorous, surprising and deceitful. Code which purposely crashed the judges&#x27; machines was discouraged.

The competition was typically divided into four categories, which, in the last contest, included:
* Create a Diversion (limit of 2048 bytes if using Perl/Tk, 512 bytes otherwise)
* World Wide Wasteland (limit of 512 bytes)
* Inner Beauty (limit of 512 bytes)
* Best &quot;The Perl Journal&quot; (code which generated the words &quot;The Perl Journal&quot;, limit of 256 bytes)

<doc id="298384" wikidata="Q223271" url="?curid=298384" title="Anthony de Mello (Jesuit priest)">
<text>Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; de Mello, (4 September 1931 – 2 June 1987), was an Indian Jesuit priest and psychotherapist. A teacher and public speaker, de Mello wrote several books on spirituality and hosted numerous spiritual retreats and conferences. He is known for his storytelling, which drew from the various mystical traditions of both East and West.

== Early Life ==
De Mello was the oldest of five children born to Frank and Louisa (née Castellino) de Mello. He was born in Bombay, British India, on 4 September 1931. He was raised in a Catholic family.

At the age of 16 de Mello entered the Society of Jesus seminary of Vinalaya on the outskirts of Bombay. In 1952 he was sent to Spain to study philosophy in Barcelona before undertaking the ministry. He then returned to India to study theology at De Nobili College in Pune and was ordained to the priesthood in March 1961. After his return to India, he spent several years working in seminaries, and in 1968 he was made rector of the seminary of Vinalaya.

De Mello was first attracted to the Jesuits for their strict discipline. Those who knew him during his earlier years in the order said he was somewhat conservative in his theology and reluctant to explore other religions. Some of his peers said that his experience in Spain led him to broaden his perspective and to lose much of his rigidity.

== Work ==
In 1972, he founded the Institute of Pastoral Counselling, later renamed the Sadhana Institute of Pastoral Counselling, in Poona, India. De Mello&#x27;s first published book, &quot;Sadhana – A Way to God&quot;, was released in 1978. It outlined a number of spiritual principles and &quot;Christian exercises in Eastern form&quot; inspired by the teachings of Saint Ignatius. It popularized various mindfulness and contemplative practices in the United States for his readers and for those who attended his lectures.

== Death ==
De Mello died of a heart attack in 1987, aged 55, in New York City. Bill De Mello, a brother of Tony&#x27;s, recounts in his book &quot;Anthony deMello: The Happy Wanderer&quot; that Tony&#x27;s body was found by Fr. Frank Stroud, S.J. According to Fr. Stroud, de Mello&#x27;s body was curled up in a fetal position. His official death certificate lists the immediate cause of his death as &quot;Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease with recent thrombosis of left circumflex branch.&quot;

== Posthumous controversy ==

In 1998, 11 years after de Mello&#x27;s death, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) under the leadership of its Cardinal-Prefect, Joseph Ratzinger (who later became Pope Benedict XVI), conducted a review of de Mello&#x27;s work and released a comment stating that while &quot;his works, which almost always take the form of brief stories, contain some valid elements of oriental wisdom . . . [which] can be helpful in achieving self-mastery, in breaking the bonds and feelings that keep us from being free, and in approaching with serenity the various vicissitudes of life,&quot; some of de Mello&#x27;s views, expressed particularly in his later work, &quot;are incompatible with the Catholic faith and can cause grave harm.&quot; 

In particular, the CDF wrote that while &quot;especially in his early writings, Father de Mello, while revealing the influence of Buddhist and Taoist spiritual currents, remained within the lines of Christian spirituality,&quot; they understood de Mello&#x27;s view of Jesus as &quot;a master alongside others,&quot; objected to the idea that &quot;the question of destiny after death is declared to be irrelevant; only the present life should be of interest,&quot; and expressed further concern that &quot;the author&#x27;s statements on the final destiny of man give rise to perplexity.&quot; 

The Indian magazine &quot;Outlook&quot; saw this as an attempt by Rome to undermine the clergy in Asia amid widening fissures between Rome and the Asian Church. De Mello&#x27;s books are available in many Catholic bookshops in the West, but sometimes include an advisory that they were written in a multi-religious context and are not intended to be manuals on Christian doctrine. Father Lisbert D’Souza (president of the Jesuit Conferences of South Asia), who knew De Mello since 1961, was the Jesuit provincial superior who presided at Father de Mello&#x27;s funeral in Bombay in June 1987. He stated that “If one understood the context in which his ideas were presented, there [would be] no problem” , and that “[de Mello] was instrumental in popularizing the full (30-day) Ignatian retreat in India.”

<text>The Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa (Devanagari: विमलकीर्तिनिर्देश) (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Vimalakīrti Sūtra&quot; or &quot;Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa Sūtra&quot;) is a Buddhist text which centers on a lay Buddhist meditator who attained a very high degree of enlightenment considered by some second only to the Buddha&#x27;s. It was extremely influential in East Asia, but most likely of considerably less importance in the Indian and Tibetan sub-traditions of Mahāyāna Buddhism. The word &quot;nirdeśa&quot; in the title means &quot;instruction, advice&quot;, and Vimalakīrti is the name of the main protagonist of the text, and means &quot;Taintless Fame&quot;.

The sutra teaches, among other subjects, the meaning of nondualism, the doctrine of the true body of the Buddha, the characteristically Mahāyāna claim that the appearances of the world are mere illusions, and the superiority of the Mahāyāna over other paths. It places in the mouth of the upāsaka (lay practitioner) Vimalakīrti a teaching addressed to both arhats and bodhisattvas, regarding the doctrine of śūnyatā. In most versions, the discourse of the text culminates with a wordless teaching of silence. Translator Burton Watson argues that the &quot;Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa&quot; was likely composed in approximately 100 CE.

Although it had been thought lost for centuries, a version in Sanskrit was recovered in 1999 among the manuscripts of the Potala Palace in Lhasa. The Sanskrit was published in parallel with the Tibetan and three Chinese versions by the Study Group on Buddhist Sanskrit Literature at the Institute for Comprehensive Studies of Buddhism at Taisho University in 2004, and in 2006, the same group published a critical edition that has become the standard version of the Sanskrit for scholarly purposes. In 2007 the Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods published a romanized Sanskrit version under the title &quot;Āryavimalakīrtinirdeśo Nāma Mahāyānasūtram&quot;.

For a recent and thorough summary of the present scholarly understanding of the text, readers should consult Felbur.

== Translations ==

Various translations circulate, and an even greater number are known or claimed to have existed in the past.

Tradition holds that the text was translated into Classical Chinese seven times. A supposed first translation (probably legendary) is said in some classical bibliographic sources, beginning with the notoriously unreliable &quot;Lidai sanbao ji&quot; 歷代三寶紀 T2034 in 598 C.E., to have been produced by Yan Fotiao 嚴佛調. Three canonical Chinese versions are extant: an earlier version ascribed to Zhi Qian 支謙, entitled &quot;Weimojie jing&quot; 維摩詰經 T474; one produced by Kumārajīva 鳩摩羅什 in 406 C.E. under the title &quot;Weimojie suoshuo jing&quot; 維摩詰所說經 T475; and one translated by Xuanzang in 650 玄奘 and is entitled &quot;Shuo Wogoucheng jing&quot; 說無垢稱經 T476. Of these, the Kumārajīva version is the most famous.

The principal Tibetan version is that found in the Kanjur, by Chos nyid tshul khrims (Dharmatāśila), &quot;Dri ma med par grags pas bstan pa&quot; D176/Q843.&#x27; An additional version was found at Dunhuang in the early 20th century.

In modern English, six main translations exist, three from Kumārajīva&#x27;s Chinese, two from the Tibetan, and one from the recently rediscovered Sanskrit text. A typically erudite French translation by Étienne Lamotte was made from the Tibetan. Lamotte&#x27;s French was re-translated into English by Sara Boin-Webb, bringing the total number of English versions to five. The English translations are:

* (From Kumārajīva&#x27;s Chinese)
* (An exhaustive scholarly treatment) - Translation from French
* (From Kumārajīva&#x27;s Chinese and featuring a short introduction)
* (From Tibetan and featuring short introduction, extensive notes and glossary entries). The same translation &quot;with an abridged introduction and notes, and lightly edited under the supervision of Professor Thurman&quot; is published online with open access at &quot;84000: Translating the Words of the Buddha&quot; 
* (From Kumārajīva&#x27;s Chinese and featuring short introduction, glossary, and minor notes)
* (The first English edition translated from the Potala Palace Sanskrit manuscript, with brief introduction. Seems available only as electronic book.)
*Gómez, Luis; Harrison, Paul (2022)&quot;. The Teaching of Vimalakīrti: An English Translation of the Sanskrit Text Found in the Potala Palace, Lhasa,&quot; Mangalam Translation Group. 
* (From Kumārajīva&#x27;s Chinese and featuring a short introduction, annotations, index, and original Chinese version.)

Jan Nattier has discussed and compared most of these translations in considerable detail, as an interesting case in the agendas and resulting shortcomings of various approaches to modern Buddhist Studies.

There also exist or existed various translations (some of them at second remove) into the Japanese, Korean, Khotanese, Mongolian, Sogdian and Manchurian languages.

Most Japanese versions are based on Kumārajīva, but two translations directly from the rediscovered Sanskrit text into vernacular Japanese have also now been published, one by Takahashi Hisao 高橋尚夫 and Nishino Midori 西野翠, and one by Ueki Masatoshi 植木雅俊.

== Synopsis ==

The &quot;Vimalakirti Sutra&quot; can be summarised as follows.

Chapter 1

The scene is Āmrapālī&#x27;s garden outside Vaiśālī. Even in this setting, we may see evidence of the literary sophistication of the authors, and the foreshadowing of key themes (antinomianism, female characters as literary tropes): Āmrapālī was a famously accomplished courtesan, ascribed in narrative with various roles in relation to promulgation of the Dharma. Five hundred Licchavi youths offer parasols to the Buddha, who miraculously transforms them into a single gigantic parasol that covers the entire cosmos. The youths ask how the &quot;Buddha field&quot; (&quot;buddhakṣetra&quot;) can be purified. The Buddha responds that the Buddha field is pure when the mind is pure (this line was one source of a whole line of interpretation in Pure Land thinking in the later East Asian tradition). The &quot;buddhakṣetra&quot; is also equated with various other exalted categories in the Mahāyāna, such as the six perfections, or the four &quot;illimitables&quot; or &quot;noble dwelling-places&quot; (&quot;brahmavihāra&quot;). Because Śāriputra is unable to see this purity, the Buddha performs a miracle that displays it to him briefly. One implication of this scene is that our Sahā world—the &quot;buddhakṣetra&quot; of Śākyamuni—is in fact as glorious as other Buddha worlds, but our defilements prevent us from correctly seeing it as such.

Chapter 2

The scene is now Vimalakīrti&#x27;s house in Vaiśālī. He is a wealthy merchant householder. He is a husband and a father. However, he is also a powerful bodhisattva with Buddha-like qualities. He enters dens of iniquity, such as gambling parlours, brothels, and the haunts of philosophers of other schools, but even in so doing, he is merely appearing to conform with the ways of this world in order to bring sentient beings to realisation of the truth. Note the echo of the famous courtesan Āmrapālī in the theme, emphasised here, of Vimalakīrti&#x27;s ambivalent, even paradoxical, relationship to sexuality and chastity; the same theme is revisited in an amusing anecdote in Chapter 3, in which Vimalakīrti bests Māra (the &quot;Buddhist devil&quot;) by accepting 12,000 goddesses from him for his &quot;serving-women&quot;. These goddesses have just been rejected by another advanced practitioner as improper, but Vimalakīrti immediately takes the occasion to convert them towards ultimate awakening.

Here, it now transpires that Vimalakīrti is feigning illness, in order that he can exploit the sympathy visits of his fellow citizens to teach them. He teaches one such group of visitors about the distinction between the apparently impermanent material body, which is prone to such sickness, and the true body of the Buddha. This is one of the earliest developed instances of &quot;dharmakāya&quot; (&quot;Dharma-body&quot;) doctrine known in Mahāyāna literature.

Chapter 3

The Buddha successively appeals to a string of his most advanced non-Mahāyāna disciples (&quot;mahāśrāvakas&quot;), and also to three bodhisattvas and a householder, to visit Vimalakīrti and ask after his health. They all refuse, saying that on prior occasions when they met with him, he showed them up in his understanding of various doctrines. Vimalakīrti is typically portrayed in these recounted exchanges as having triumphed by a kind of paradoxical and contrary rhetoric, which on the surface makes no sense. For example, he bested Śāriputra on the topic of sitting in meditation by asserting that true meditation is in fact a string of things bearing no obvious resemblance to meditation, such as having no body in the visible world, or abiding in a state of complete meditative cessation (normally held to resemble physical death to the untrained eye) while at the same time engaging actively and perfectly in all the niceties of monastic deportment.

Chapter 4

The bodhisattva Mañjuśrī (conventionally understood as the embodiment of supreme wisdom) is persuaded by the Buddha to visit Vimalakīrti, albeit with some difficulty. Vimalakīrti miraculously transforms his apparently narrow and humble abode into a vast cosmic palace, thus creating enough space for the throng Mañjuśrī has brought with him. Vimalakīrti explains his illness in spiritual terms, equating it with the fundamental existential malaise of all sentient beings. According to this discourse, the true cure for all ills is also spiritual, and involves the achievement of states of non-self and non-dualism.

Chapter 5

Vimalakīrti performs a further miracle, summoning from another distant Buddha-field 32,000 vast &quot;lion thrones&quot; (&quot;siṃhāsana&quot;) for Mañjuśrī and his company, without expanding his narrow room. Each of these seats is so immense that advanced bodhisattvas must transform their bodies to a size of 42,000 &quot;yojana&quot;s (leagues) tall to sit on them. Śariputra and other &quot;mahāśrāvaka&quot;s, incapable of this feat, cannot mount their seats. This space- and mind-bending miracle is taken as the chance to teach that a vast array of &quot;unthinkable&quot; things are possible for advanced adherents of the Mahāyāna (e.g. inhaling all the winds of all the worlds at once, or showing all the offerings ever given to all Buddhas in a single pore of the skin of their bodies).

Chapter 6

Vimalakīrti expounds a series of analogies designed to explain the point that the bodhisattva regards sentient beings as, in various senses, illusory or even logically impossible. A goddess then appears, who has been living in Vimalakīrti&#x27;s room for twelve years. She creates a shower of heavenly petals. These petals stick to the bodies of the non-Mahāyāna adepts (&quot;mahāśrāvaka&quot;s), but slide off the bodies of the bodhisattvas and drop to the ground. Śāriputra, perturbed (among other things, by a probable infringement of the monastic code, which prohibits personal adornment), even attempts to use his supernatural powers to shed this unwelcome decoration, but in vain. A battle of wits and wisdom ensues, in which Śāriputra is sorely bested and humiliated by the goddess. She explains that he cannot shake off the flowers because he is &quot;attached&quot; (for instance, to a formalistic and superficial understanding of the Dharma and the Vinaya). Śāriputra asks the goddess, perhaps somewhat peevishly, why she still has the (inferior) body of a woman, if she has attained to such high levels of insight. In response, she uses her own supernatural powers to switch bodies with Śāriputra, who is even more perturbed to find himself in the guise of a woman, but finds that nothing he does allows him to return to his own &quot;true&quot; form. Eventually, the goddess takes mercy and releases her hold, but the overall effect of the exchange is to show the vast superiority of Mahāyāna doctrine and practice over the other, more traditional forms of Buddhism of which Śāriputra is a paragon. The drama presented in this chapter has been an important reference point for traditional and especially modern attempts to find Mahāyāna perspectives on the nature of gender, and Buddhist feminist attempts to find canonical sources for a stance that ascribes equal spiritual status or potential to women.

Chapter 7

A dialogue ensues between Mañjuśrī and Vimalakīrti. Echoing the dramatic besting of Śāriputra—a famed expert in doctrine—by a mere non-Buddhist deity and female, this dialogue ultimately sees Mañjuśrī, the paragon of Mahāyāna wisdom, upstaged by someone who is apparently a &quot;mere&quot; householder, and (as we saw in Chapter 2), apparently no model of virtue at that—a companion of gamblers and prostitutes.

Chapter 8

Vimalakīrti conducts a dialogue with a series of bodhisattvas from Mañjuśrī&#x27;s entourage on the topic of non-duality (&quot;advaya&quot;). Again, Vimalakīrti ultimately emerges supreme from this contest. His &quot;statement&quot; on the topic is his famous silence, which crowns the whole series of exchanges and is implicitly framed as the &quot;last word&quot;. This portion of the text was important for later tradition, including various Chan/Zen texts and schools, as a source of the notion that truth is beyond language, and specially framed acts of silence are its most adequate expression.

Chapter 9&quot;

Vimalakīrti uses his powers to conjure up a magically emanated bodhisattva, whom he sends to a remote Buddha-world to fetch a wonderfully fragrant type of food that is eaten there. The emanated bodhisattva brings this food back to Vimalakīrti&#x27;s home, and he uses a single bowlful to miraculously feed the vast congregation in attendance. Vimalakīrti takes the occasion to deliver a discourse on the necessity of suffering as a means of teaching for the beings in Śākyamuni&#x27;s Sahā world.

Chapter 10

Vimalakīrti picks up the entire assembly in his room in one hand, and miraculously transports it to Āmrapālī&#x27;s garden (the scene we left in the opening chapter), where they visit the Buddha and Ānanda. When Ānanda smells the fragrance of the wonderful food described in the previous chapter, it is used as the occasion for a teaching that describes how the Buddhas accomplish their teaching and liberation of sentient beings by all means conceivable (and inconceivable!). Ānanda concedes that &quot;śrāvaka&quot;s are inferior to bodhisattvas, and Vimalakīrti delivers another teaching.

Chapter 11

Vimalakīrti explains how he views the Buddha. This teaching is conveyed by a series of negations. The Buddha reveals to Śāriputra that Vimalakīrti is in fact a bodhisattva from the Buddha-world Abhirati, which is created and overseen by the Buddha Akṣobhya. In order to show the assembly in Āmrapālī&#x27;s garden this world, Vimalakīrti uses his prodigious powers to bring the entire world into the garden. Śākyamuni Buddha predicts to all present that they will be reborn in Abhirati, and Vimalakīrti puts the Buddha-world back where it came from.

Chapter 12

The text closes with formulaic statements that the teaching it delivers should be preserved and transmitted. A new sermon expounds a series of characteristics of inferior bodhisattvas, which prevent them attaining the highest attainments. The Buddha entrusts the &quot;sūtra&quot; to Maitreya, in order that sentient beings of future ages may also be able to hear it.

== Themes ==

According to Fan Muyou, the &quot;Vimalakīrtinirdeśa&quot; contains numerous philosophical and doctrinal themes, including:

* the ignorance and delusion of the sravakas, 
* the superiority of Mahayana over Hinayana, 
* the transcendental body of a tathagata, 
* the ambivalence of the sexes
* the benevolent and saving power of the bodhisattvas
* Emptiness (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;)

=== Śūnyatā ===
According to Etienne Lamotte, the &quot;Vimalakīrtinirdeśa&quot; is one of the oldest Mahayana sutras and contains the madhyamika philosophy of emptiness (&quot;Śūnyatā&quot;) in a raw state (which may have served as a foundation for Nagarjuna&#x27;s school). In his translation of the sutra (&quot;L&#x27;Enseignement de Vimalakīrti (Vimalakīrtinirdeśa)&quot;), Lamotte outlines the major theses of the madhyamaka school and shows how the &quot;Vimalakīrtinirdeśa&quot; contains all of these. Some of these major ideas include:

* All dharmas are without self-nature (&quot;niḥsvabhāva&quot;) and are empty of self-nature (&quot;svabhāva-śūnya&quot;)
* All dharmas are originally calm (&quot;ādiśānta&quot;) and naturally nirvana-ized (&quot;prakṛtiparinirvṛta&quot;). Lamotte states: “For the Madhyamaka, dharmas which do not arise at all are not produced by reason of causes and do not enter the round of rebirth: thus they are nirvana-ized. For them, samsara is intermixed with nirvana.” This agrees with &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot; 25.19–20: &quot;There is nothing whatsoever of samsara distinguishing (it) from nirvana. There is nothing whatsoever of nirvana distinguishing it from samsara.&quot;
* Dharmas are without marks (&quot;alakṣṇa&quot;) and consequently inexpressible (&quot;anabhilāpya&quot;) and unthinkable.
* All dharmas are the same (&quot;sama&quot;) and without duality (&quot;advaya&quot;). Since dharmas are devoid of nature and empty, they are essentially identical, as shown in the verse from the &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot; that reads: “Being, from the absolute point of view, equally without production and equally without birth, all dharmas are the same from the absolute point of view.”
Burton Watson also argues that the doctrine of emptiness is the central teaching of this sutra, along with the related idea that since all dharmas are of the same nature, they are non-dual, having a single ultimate quality.

=== Silence ===
The &quot;Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa&quot; &quot;offers us two dramatic and contrasting moments of silence. The first of these [is] the silence of Śāriputra&quot;, who is rendered silent during an exchange with a goddess:
Vimalakīrti remains silent while discussing the subject of emptiness with an assembly of bodhisattvas. The bodhisattvas give a variety of answers on the question what non-duality is. Mañjuśrī is the last bodhisattva to answer, and says that &quot;by giving an explanation they have already fallen into dualism&quot;. Vimalakīrti, in his turn, answers with silence.

With this emphasis on silence the &quot;Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa&quot; served as a forerunner of the approach of the Ch&#x27;an/Zen tradition, with its avoidance of positive statements on &#x27;ultimate reality&#x27;:
But it does not mean that language is to be discredited completely:
== East Asian Commentaries ==
The &quot;Vimalakīrti&quot; was the object of much commentary activity in East Asian Buddhism. By contrast, no commentaries are known in India or Tibet. A fragment of a very early commentary, conceivably dating before the end of the fourth century, has been preserved in manuscript form, and taken as the object of a monographic study. 

Another important text, the &quot;Zhu Weimojie jing&quot; 注維摩詰經 (which modern scholarship has shown to be the product of a complex history), transmits what is actually a set of interrelated commentaries ascribed to scholars among the very translation team that produced the second Chinese translation at the beginning of the fifth century, including Kumārajīva himself. 

Other relatively early commentaries were produced by Jingying Huiyuan 淨影慧遠 (523–592): &quot;Wuimo yiji&quot; 維摩義記 T1776; Zhiyi 智顗 (538–597): &quot;Weimo jing xuanshu&quot; 維摩經玄疏; Jizang 吉藏 (549–623): &quot;Jingming xuanlun&quot; 淨名玄論 T1780 and &quot;Weimo jing yishu&quot; 維摩經義疏 T1781; [Kiu]Ji [窺]基 (632–682): &quot;Shuo Wugoucheng jing shu&quot; 說無垢稱經疏 T1782; and Zhanran 湛然 (711–782): &quot;Weimo jing lüeshu&quot; 維摩經略疏 T1778. Yet another significant commentary is the &quot;Yuimagyō gisho&quot; 維摩経義疏, or &quot;Commentary on the Vimalakīrti Sūtra&quot;, ascribed to Prince Shōtoku 聖徳太子 (574–622), an early work of Japanese Buddhism, which is said to be based on the commentary of the Liang dynasty Chinese monk Zhizang 智藏 (458–522 CE).

== Other influence in East Asia ==
The impact of the &quot;Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa&quot; can also be traced in many other dimensions of East Asian culture. Large numbers of manuscript copies of the text survive in collections from Dunhuang 敦煌 and elsewhere. The text had a major impact on the arts, including visual art, but also poetry. The self-chosen soubriquet of the Tang poet Wang Wei 王維 (699–759), for instance, means nothing less than &quot;Vimalakīrti&quot;. In the modern world, the famous Peking opera &quot;The Heavenly Maiden Scatters Flowers&quot; 天女散花, created by Mei Lanfang 梅蘭芳 (1894–1961), also took as its basis the dramatic encounter between the goddess and Śāriputra in Chapter 6.

The sutra is also thought to have been influential in East Asian Buddhism for its perceived humor (though the supposed humour of the text is a difficult topic, somewhat controversial in modern scholarship), and the perception that it provides scriptural warrant for various compromises between (typically monastic) austerity and engagement with secular life. The text has also been influential in Mahāyāna Buddhism for its perceived inclusiveness and respect for non-monastic practitioners, and is often interpreted as advocating an equal role for women in Buddhism.

One context in which the text was especially popular was the Chan/Zen 禪 school. However, McRae also notes that the sūtra was not used as an object of devotion, and that no school was ever formed around it, so that it does not seem to have enjoyed the degree of popularity of some other sūtras.

Richard B. Mather traces multiple causes of the popularity of the text in China, including its &quot;brash&quot; humor, its criticism of śrāvakas and Abhidharma, and the universality and &quot;flexibility&quot; of its outlook. Mather states that despite its disparagement of &quot;śrāvaka&quot;s, the &quot;sūtra&quot; strong supports the Saṃgha, and the text intends to sanction the pursuit of the bodhisattva path by both monastics and laity without opposition to one another.

Hu Shih, an important figure in Chinese language reform in the early 20th century, wrote that the &quot;Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa&quot; was among Kumārajīva&#x27;s three most influential translations (the other two being the &quot;Diamond Sūtra&quot; and &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;). As a literary work, he praised this version of the sūtra as &quot;half novel and half drama, with the greatest impact on literature and fine arts.&quot; Nan Huaijin also regards this translation of the &quot;Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa&quot; as unique in Chinese literature, and forming &quot;virtually its own literary realm.&quot;

According to Nan Huaijin&#x27;s description of the Chan/Zen monastic system, the abbot of the monastery customarily lived in a small room patterned after that of Vimalakīrti&#x27;s room. This room, as well as the abbot himself, were colloquially referred to as the &quot;fāngzhàng&quot; (Ch. 方丈, Jpn. &quot;hōjō&quot;), or &quot;ten-foot square,&quot; &quot;square fathom.&quot; This refers to a description of Vimalakīrti&#x27;s apparently small and humble room, which the text portrays as miraculously transforming into a vast cosmic arena in which transcendent truths are taught for an audience of advanced bodhisattvas.

<text>Johann Baptist Joseph Maximilian Reger (19 March 187311 May 1916) was a German composer, pianist, organist, conductor, and academic teacher. He worked as a concert pianist, a musical director at the Leipzig University Church, a professor at the Royal Conservatory in Leipzig, and a music director at the court of George II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen.

Reger first composed mainly &quot;Lieder&quot;, chamber music, choral music and works for piano and organ. He later turned to orchestral compositions, such as the popular &quot;Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Mozart&quot; (1914), and to works for choir and orchestra such as &quot;Gesang der Verklärten&quot; (1903), &quot;&quot; (1909), &quot;Der Einsiedler&quot; and the &quot;Hebbel Requiem&quot; (both 1915).

== Biography ==
Born in Brand, Bavaria, Reger was the first child of Josef Reger, a school teacher and amateur musician, and his wife Katharina Philomena. The devout Catholic family moved to Weiden in 1874. Max had only one sister, Emma, after three other siblings died in childhood. When he turned five, Reger learned organ, violin and cello from his father and piano from his mother. From 1884 to 1889, Reger took piano and organ lessons from Adalbert Lindner, one of his father&#x27;s students. During this time, he frequently acted as substitute organist for Lindner in the parish church of the city. In 1886, Reger entered into the Royal Preparatory School according to his parents&#x27; wishes to prepare for a teaching profession.

In 1888, Reger was invited by his uncle Johann Baptist Ulrich to visit the Bayreuth Festival, where he heard Richard Wagner&#x27;s operas &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot; and &quot;Parsifal&quot;. This left a deep impression and made Reger decide to pursue a music career. In late summer of that year, Reger wrote his first major composition, the Overture in B minor, an unpublished work for orchestra with 120 pages. Lindner sent the score to Hugo Riemann, who replied positively but warned him against Wagner&#x27;s influence and to write melodies instead of motifs. Reger finished the preparatory school in June 1889. Also that year, he composed a Scherzo for string quartet and flute in G minor, a three movement string quartet in D minor, and a Largo for violin and piano. At his father&#x27;s request, he sent the latter two works to composer Josef Rheinberger, a professor at the University of Music and Performing Arts Munich, who recognized his talents. Reger eventually sought a career in music despite his father&#x27;s concerns.

In 1890, Reger began studying music theory with Riemann in Sondershausen, then piano and theory in Wiesbaden. The first compositions to which he assigned opus numbers were chamber music and &quot;Lieder&quot;. A concert pianist himself, he composed works for both piano and organ. His first work for choir and piano to which he assigned an opus number was &quot;Drei Chöre&quot; (1892).

Reger returned to his parental home in Weiden due to illness in 1898, where he composed his first work for choir and orchestra, &quot;&quot; (Hymn to singing), Op. 21. From 1899, he courted Elsa vonBercken who at first rejected him. He composed many songs including the love poems &quot;Sechs Lieder&quot;, Op. 35. Reger moved to Munich in September 1901, where he obtained concert offers and where his rapid rise to fame began. During his first Munich season, Reger appeared in ten concerts as an organist, chamber pianist and accompanist. Income from publishers, concerts and private teaching enabled him to marry in 1902. Because his wife Elsa was a divorced Protestant, he was excommunicated from the Catholic Church. He continued to compose without interruption, for example &quot;Gesang der Verklärten&quot;, Op. 71.

In 1907, Reger was appointed musical director at the Leipzig University Church, a position he held until 1908, and professor at the Royal Conservatory in Leipzig. In 1908 he began to compose &quot;&quot; (The 100th Psalm), Op. 106, a setting of Psalm 100 for mixed choir and orchestra, for the 350th anniversary of Jena University. Part I was premiered on 31 July that year. Reger completed the composition in 1909, premiered in 1910 simultaneously in Chemnitz and Breslau.
In 1911 Reger was appointed &quot;Hofkapellmeister&quot; (music director) at the court of Duke Georg II of Saxe-Meiningen, also taking charge of music at the Meiningen Court Theatre. He continued with his master class at the Leipzig conservatory. In 1913 he composed four tone poems on paintings by Arnold Böcklin (&quot;Vier Tongedichte nach Arnold Böcklin&quot;), including &quot;Die Toteninsel&quot; (&quot;Isle of the Dead&quot;), as his Op. 128.

He gave up the court position in 1914 for health reasons. In response to World War I, already in 1914 he was planning to compose a choral work, commemorating those lost in the war. He began to set the Latin Requiem but abandoned the work as a fragment. He composed eight motets as his &quot;Acht geistliche Gesänge für gemischten Chor&quot; (Eight Sacred Songs, Op. 138), embodying &quot;a new simplicity&quot;. In 1915 he moved to Jena, commuting once a week to teach in Leipzig. In Jena he composed the &quot;Hebbel Requiem&quot; for soloist, choir and orchestra.

Reger died of a heart attack while staying at a hotel in Leipzig on 11 May 1916. The proofs of &quot;Acht geistliche Gesänge&quot;, including &quot;Der Mensch lebt und bestehet nur eine kleine Zeit&quot;, were found next to his bed. Six years after Reger&#x27;s death, his funeral urn was transferred from his home in Jena to a cemetery in Weimar. In 1930, on the wishes of Reger&#x27;s widow Elsa, his remains were moved to a grave of honour in Munich Waldfriedhof.

Reger had also been active internationally as a conductor and pianist. Among his students were Joseph Haas, Sándor Jemnitz, Jaroslav Kvapil, Ruben Liljefors, Aarre Merikanto, Sofie Rohnstock, George Szell and Cristòfor Taltabull. He was the cousin of Hans von Koessler.

== Works ==

Reger produced an enormous output in just over 25 years, nearly always in abstract forms. His work was well known in Germany during his lifetime. Many of his works are fugues or in variation form, including the &quot;Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Mozart&quot; based on the opening theme of Mozart&#x27;s Piano Sonata in A major, K. 331.

Reger wrote a large amount of music for organ, the most popular being the &quot;Benedictus&quot; from the collection Op. 59 and his &quot;Fantasy and Fugue on BACH&quot;, Op. 46. While a student under Hugo Riemann in Wiesbaden, Reger had already met the German organist, Karl Straube; their association as colleagues and friends began in 1898, with Straube premiering many of Reger&#x27;s organ works, such as the Three chorale fantasias, Op. 52.
Reger recorded some of his works on the Welte Philharmonic organ, including excerpts from 52 Chorale Preludes, Op. 67. He also composed various secular organ works, including the Introduction, Passacaglia and Fugue, Op. 127. It was dedicated to Straube, who gave its first performance in 1913 to inaugurate the Wilhelm Sauer organ at the opening of the Breslau Centennial Hall.

Reger was particularly attracted to the fugal form and created music in almost every genre, save for opera and the symphony (he did, however, compose a Sinfonietta, his Op. 90). A similarly firm supporter of absolute music, he saw himself as being part of the tradition of Beethoven and Brahms. His work often combined the classical structures of these composers with the extended harmonies of Liszt and Wagner, to which he added the complex counterpoint of Bach. Reger&#x27;s organ music, though also influenced by Liszt, was provoked by that tradition.

Some of the works for solo string instruments turn up often on recordings, though less regularly in recitals. His solo piano and two-piano music places him as a successor to Brahms in the central German tradition. He intensively pursued Brahms&#x27;s continuous development and free modulation, whilst being rooted in Bach-influenced polyphony.

Reger was a prolific writer of vocal works, Lieder, works for mixed chorus, men&#x27;s chorus and female chorus, and extended choral works with orchestra such as &quot;Der 100. Psalm&quot; and &quot;Requiem&quot;, a setting of a poem by Friedrich Hebbel, which Reger dedicated to the soldiers of World War I. He composed music to texts by poets such as Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio, Otto Julius Bierbaum, Adelbert von Chamisso, Joseph von Eichendorff, Emanuel Geibel, Friedrich Hebbel, Nikolaus Lenau, Detlev von Liliencron, Friedrich Rückert and Ludwig Uhland. Reger assigned opus numbers to major works himself.

His works could be considered retrospective as they followed classical and baroque compositional techniques such as fugue and continuo. The influence of the latter can be heard in his chamber works which are deeply reflective and unconventional.

== Reception ==
In 1898 Caesar Hochstetter, an arranger, composer and critic, published an article entitled &quot;Noch einmal Max Reger&quot; (&quot;Max Reger once again&quot;) in a music magazine (&quot;Die redenden Künste&quot; 5 no. 49, pp. 943 f). Caesar recommended Reger as &quot;a highly talented young composer&quot; to the publishers. Reger thanked Hochstetter with the dedications of his piano pieces &quot;Aquarellen&quot;, Op. 25, and &quot;Cinq Pièces pittoresques&quot;, Op. 34.

Reger had an acrimonious relationship with Rudolf Louis, the music critic of the &quot;Münchener Neueste Nachrichten&quot;, who usually had negative opinions of his compositions. After the first performance of the Sinfonietta in A major, Op. 90, on 2 February 1906, Louis wrote a typically negative review on 7 February. Reger wrote back to him: &quot;Ich sitze in dem kleinsten Zimmer in meinem Hause. Ich habe Ihre Kritik vor mir. Im nächsten Augenblick wird sie hinter mir sein!&quot; (&quot;I am sitting in the smallest room of my house. I have your review before me. In a moment it will be behind me!&quot;). Another source has the German composer Sigfrid Karg-Elert as the targeted critic of this letter.

Arnold Schoenberg was an admirer of Reger&#x27;s. A letter he sent to Alexander von Zemlinsky in 1922 states: &quot;Reger...must in my view be done often; 1, because he has written a lot; 2, because he is already dead and people are still not clear about him. (I consider him a genius.)&quot;

== Films ==
The documentary &quot;Max Reger – Music as a perpetual state,&quot; by and Ewald Kontschieder, Miramonte Film, was released in 2002. It was the first factually based film documentation about Max Reger. It was produced in cooperation with the Max-Reger-Institute.

&quot;Max Reger: The Last Giant&quot;, a documentary film about the life and works of Max Reger, is included on a 6 DVD set entitled &quot;Maximum Reger&quot; released in December 2016 to mark the 100th anniversary of Reger&#x27;s death. The set was produced by Fugue State Films and in addition to the documentary includes excerpts from Reger&#x27;s most important works for orchestra, piano, chamber ensemble and organ, with performances by Frauke May, Bernhard Haas, Bernhard Buttmann and the Brandenburgisches Staatsorchester Frankfurt.

<text>Micheál Martin (; born 1 August 1960) is an Irish Fianna Fáil politician serving as Taoiseach since January 2025, having previously held the position from 2020 to 2022. Martin served as Tánaiste, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Defence from December 2022 to January 2025. He has been leader of Fianna Fáil since January 2011 and a TD for Cork South-Central since 1989. He previously served as Leader of the Opposition from 2011 to 2020 and held various cabinet offices under Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen.

Born in Cork, Martin initially worked as a teacher before entering politics. He was elected to Cork City Council in 1985, and served as Lord Mayor of Cork from 1992 to 1993. In 1989, he was first elected to Dáil Éireann for Cork South-Central, a seat he has represented ever since. After the victory of Fianna Fáil at the 1997 general election, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern appointed Martin to cabinet as Minister for Education and Science. In 2000, Martin was appointed Minister for Health and Children. In 2004, during his time as Health Minister, Martin was notable for introducing a ban on tobacco smoking in all Irish workplaces, making Ireland the first country in the world to introduce a full workplace smoking ban. In the same year, Martin established the Health Service Executive. He served as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment from 2004 to 2008, before being appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs by Ahern&#x27;s successor, Brian Cowen. In 2009, Martin became the first Irish foreign minister to travel to Latin America, during which time he also made the first official visit to Cuba by any Irish minister. Martin also visited Khartoum during his time as Foreign Minister, following the kidnapping of Sharon Commins and Hilda Kawuki.

In January 2011, Martin resigned as Foreign Minister in protest at Cowen&#x27;s leadership. Following Cowen&#x27;s own resignation as leader of Fianna Fáil, Martin was elected to replace him. Weeks later, at the 2011 general election, Martin led Fianna Fáil to the worst result in its 85-year history, with a loss of 57 seats and a popular vote of just 17.4%. He remained in the leadership, becoming Leader of the Opposition. At the 2016 general election, Fianna Fáil&#x27;s performance improved significantly, more than doubling their representation in the Dáil: Martin continued to serve as Leader of the Opposition.

Martin led his party through the 2020 general election, at which Fianna Fáil becoming the largest party in the Dáil by just one seat. After lengthy negotiations, he was appointed Taoiseach on 27 June 2020, leading a grand coalition with longtime rival party Fine Gael, marking the first time these two parties had governed together, along with the Green Party. Under the terms of the coalition agreement, Martin served as Taoiseach for the first half of the five-year term, with his predecessor Leo Varadkar as Tánaiste. Martin resigned as Taoiseach on 17 December 2022 to facilitate the appointment of Varadkar to the office.

In the 2024 general election, Fianna Fáil achieved the most seats in the Dáil; Martin was appointed as Taoiseach in January 2025 after a new coalition government was formed.

==Early life==
Martin was born in 1960 in Cork and was raised in the Turners Cross area. Martin was the son of Paddy Martin (1923–2012), a former soldier in the Defence Forces, CIÉ bus driver and Irish international boxer, and Eileen &quot;Lana&quot; Corbett (1929–2010). He was the third child in a family of five. Martin&#x27;s eldest brother Seán and his twin brother Pádraig subsequently became involved in local politics in Cork. His two younger sisters, Eileen and Máiréad, have remained apolitical. Martin attended Coláiste Chríost Rí before studying arts at University College Cork.

It was during his time at university that Martin became involved in politics. He was a prominent member of the UCC Cumann of Ógra Fianna Fáil, the youth wing of the party, before serving as national chairman of Ógra. After graduating with a BA degree, Martin completed an MA in political history. Subsequently, he completed a higher diploma in education, and began a career as a history teacher in Presentation Brothers College.

In 2009, he published his MA thesis as a book: &quot;Freedom to Choose: Cork and Party Politics in Ireland 1918–1932&quot;.

==Early political career==
Martin&#x27;s time as a teacher was short-lived: he left after just one year to become a full-time politician, when he secured election to Cork Corporation as a Fianna Fáil candidate in 1985. It was from this local base that he decided to embark on a career in national politics a little under two years later. Martin was one of four candidates who secured the Fianna Fáil nomination to run in the Cork South-Central constituency at the 1987 general election; however, of the four he polled the fewest first-preference votes and failed to be elected. He became a member of the Fianna Fáil national executive in 1988.

In 1989, Taoiseach Charles Haughey called a snap election, and Martin was once again added to the Fianna Fáil ticket in Cork South-Central, and on that occasion he secured election to Dáil Éireann. He has been re-elected at each election since.

In his first few years as a TD, Martin served on a number of Oireachtas committees, including those dealing with crime, finance and the Irish language. He served as Lord Mayor of Cork in 1992. Two years later, in December 1994, Bertie Ahern was elected as the new leader of Fianna Fáil, as the party lost power and went into opposition. Martin, however, joined Ahern&#x27;s new front bench at the start of 1995 as Spokesperson on Education and the Gaeltacht.

==Cabinet career (1997–2011)==
===Minister for Education and Science (1997–2000)===
When Fianna Fáil returned to power following the 1997 general election, Martin was appointed to the newly expanded position of Minister for Education and Science. Aged 36, he was the youngest member of Bertie Ahern&#x27;s first cabinet. As Minister for Education and Science, his tenure was characterised by an increase in spending at all levels of education, while a number of educational initiatives, such as a review of the primary school curriculum and the introduction of special needs assistants, were also initiated.

===Minister for Health and Children (2000–2004)===
In a cabinet reshuffle in January 2000, Martin was appointed Minister for Health and Children. Martin&#x27;s predecessor, Brian Cowen, described the position as &quot;like being in Angola&quot;, because &#x27;landmines&#x27; can go off at any time.

Despite tough opposition, Martin introduced a ban on tobacco smoking in all Irish workplaces, including pubs and restaurants. On 30 January 2003 he announced his intention to have the ban in place on 1 January 2004. He visited New York in September 2003 to look at how a similar ban worked there, and signed the UN&#x27;s framework convention on tobacco control at their headquarters. The smoking ban was introduced on 29 March 2004, making Ireland the first country in the world to introduce a blanket ban on smoking in the workplace. On 4 September 2004 Martin was presented with an award for his work on the smoking ban by the European Respiratory Society in Glasgow.

He introduced an overhaul of the health system, which included the abolition of the health boards and the establishment of the Health Service Executive (HSE). He deregulated the country&#x27;s pharmacies on 31 January 2002.

In October 2003, Martin promised to examine cases of symphysiotomy in Irish hospitals which occurred during the 1940s and 1950s, and offered free health care to those affected.

===Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (2004–2008)===
In September 2004, he exchanged government positions with Mary Harney, to become Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The following September, the government&#x27;s economic record on the cost of living came under scrutiny from the RTÉ television programme &quot;Rip-Off Republic&quot;. This led to Martin abolishing the controversial Groceries Order 1987, a piece of legislation which prohibited the sale of groceries below cost price.

Letters containing death threats and shotgun cartridges, from a group calling itself the Irish Citizens Defence Force, were posted to Martin on 29 February 2008, at a prominent Dublin fertility clinic.

===Minister for Foreign Affairs (2008–2011)===
On the resignation of Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach in May 2008, Martin supported Brian Cowen&#x27;s bid for the Fianna Fáil leadership.

In a cabinet reshuffle on 13 May 2008, following the election of Brian Cowen as Taoiseach, Martin became Minister for Foreign Affairs. One of the first issues that he had to deal with was the referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon.

Martin led the government campaign. Despite the overwhelming majority of government and opposition parties supporting a Yes vote, the electorate rejected the government&#x27;s recommendation. Martin and Cowen failed to convince the Irish public to support the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, and this protest expressed in the referendum on 12 June 2008 plunged the government into a major political crisis.

In February 2009, Martin travelled to Latin America for the first time, making stopovers in Mexico and Havana; it was the first time an Irish government Minister had made an official visit to Cuba.

In September 2009, he travelled to Khartoum to discuss the kidnapping of Sharon Commins and Hilda Kawuki with the Sudanese government.

On 7 February 2010, he defended the €4.4 million redevelopment of the Irish embassy in Ottawa, Canada. While in Brussels on 22 February 2010, he questioned Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel Avigdor Lieberman over the use of fraudulent Irish passports in the assassination of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh.

On 17 March 2010, he met President of the United States Barack Obama in the White House, alongside Taoiseach Brian Cowen.

On 26 May 2010, he met with senior Chinese leaders in Beijing, to discuss relations between China and Ireland, before travelling onward to Shanghai. While there, he visited the Irish pavilion at Expo 2010 in the city.

On 28 June 2010, he began a five-day trip to Uganda and Ethiopia, where he visited buildings and met ministers and businesspeople.

====Criticism of Gaza blockade====
As Minister for Foreign Affairs, Martin was critical of the blockade of Gaza, particularly after being denied access to the area in 2009. He wrote to Spain (incoming holder of the presidency of the Council of the EU) to suggest that the EU send a delegation of foreign ministers to the area in 2010. He made his first visit there himself on 25 February 2010, on a one-day humanitarian mission through the Egyptian border. In doing so, Martin became the first Western foreign minister to visit Gaza since Hamas took control in 2007. While in Gaza, the Minister toured hospitals and schools. He was accompanied by United Nations vehicles.
The following week Martin wrote about his experience in the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;.

Martin was Minister for Foreign Affairs during the Gaza flotilla raid and the aftermath of this incident. He told Dáil Éireann that he had requested that the Israeli government allow the MV &quot;Rachel Corrie&quot; to deliver its cargo of aid to Gaza instead of involving itself in &quot;further bloodshed&quot;.

== Leadership of Fianna Fáil (2011–present) ==
===2011===
In September 2010, doubts about Brian Cowen&#x27;s abilities and political judgment as Taoiseach and party leader emerged following a disastrous early-morning radio interview on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot;. Cowen survived; however, that same month Martin admitted that he and other cabinet members, namely Brian Lenihan and Dermot Ahern, harboured ambitions to lead the party should a vacancy arise. While some backbench rebel Fianna Fáil TDs and senators called for Cowen to go, no cabinet minister publicly came forward to challenge the incumbent. In spite of this, Martin once again expressed an interest in running for the leadership of Fianna Fáil once the vacancy arises in December 2010 on RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;Saturday View&quot; radio programme.

On 16 January 2011, Martin announced that he would vote against Brian Cowen in the upcoming confidence motion in his leadership of the party. He offered to resign as Minister for Foreign Affairs, but his resignation was initially refused by Cowen. Following the result of the motion, which Cowen won, the resignation was accepted.

On 22 January 2011, just days after winning a vote of confidence, Brian Cowen announced that he was stepping down as leader of Fianna Fáil, but would remain as Taoiseach. On a special RTÉ News programme that day, a number of Fianna Fáil TDs and senators came on the air and publicly backed Martin for the leadership. Later that evening, Martin formally announced his intention to seek support for the leadership of Fianna Fáil. He was immediately seen as the front-runner; however, a number of other candidates, including Brian Lenihan Éamon Ó Cuív and Mary Hanafin, entered the field to ensure a contest.

On 26 January 2011, the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party met to elect a new leader. Martin was proposed by Dara Calleary and seconded by Áine Brady and received 33 first-preference votes. After Hanafin and Lenihan had been eliminated from the contest and their surplus votes distributed, Martin emerged with 50 votes and was duly elected the eighth leader of Fianna Fáil. After election, he pledged to reinvigorate Fianna Fáil from its traditional centre ground roots, believing that Fianna Fáil has never delivered to the Irish people through the labels of left and right.

Martin led the party into the 2011 general election, which saw Fianna Fáil swept from power in the worst defeat of a sitting government in the history of the Irish state. The party saw its first-preference vote more than halved. Without significant transfers, the count quickly turned into a rout. Ultimately, Fianna Fáil lost 57 seats, representing a decline of 75%–the worst electoral performance in its 85-year history. The party was knocked down to only 20 seats for third place–the first time in 79 years that it was not the largest party in the Dáil.

While Martin and other Fianna Fáil leaders concluded early on that they would not be re-elected to another term in government, they were surprised by the severity of the defeat; they had hoped to hold onto at least 30 seats. In the wake of what has been described as &quot;defeat on a historic scale&quot;, Martin pledged to renew the party &quot;at every level&quot;.

During the Seanad elections, Martin recommended support for 10 candidates, in an attempt to bring new blood into the parliamentary party. This caused resentment from Fianna Fáil Councillors and incumbent Fianna Fáil Senators. Only five of the recommended ten were elected, although the party performed better than expected winning fourteen seats.

In August 2011, Martin approached Gay Byrne as a possible nominee for the presidential election, but this approach caused controversy within his party, who favoured an internal candidate, Brian Crowley, which was exacerbated on the declining of the nomination by Byrne and the withdrawal from the process by Crowley. In an opinion poll in September 2011, Fianna Fáil&#x27;s popularity fell to 10%, several points lower than its performance in the February 2011 election.

===2016–2018===
In 2016, he criticised Fine Gael for plans to cut personal taxation in Ireland to levels seen in the United States.

At the 2016 general election, Martin led Fianna Fáil to a modest recovery, with a representation of 44 seats in the 158-member parliament. In 2016, he was nominated for Taoiseach, but no nominees received enough votes to be nominated as Taoiseach.

Martin was also the party Spokesperson on Northern Ireland.

In January 2018, Martin stated that he would support a relaxation of Ireland&#x27;s abortion stance, citing &quot;cruel inflexibility and unintended consequences&quot;. Specifically, he said &quot;he would vote in favour of repealing the Eighth Amendment and to allow abortion on request until near the end of the first trimester,&quot; leading to some political conflict within Fianna Fáil. 31 of the party&#x27;s TDs and Senators posed for a photograph showing their opposition to repealing the eighth amendment, with over half of the parliamentary party supporting a No vote.

In November 2018, Varadkar and Martin argued over carbon tax increases led to the Dáil almost being adjourned for the day. Martin was given the decision in December 2018 on whether to enter into talks to renegotiate the confidence-and-supply deal. In December 2018, Martin ruled out a 2019 general election, agreeing to a one-year extension between his party and Fine Gael in Ireland&#x27;s &quot;national interest&quot;.

==Taoiseach (2020–2022)==

On 27 June 2020, Martin was elected as Taoiseach, in a historic coalition agreement that saw his party Fianna Fáil go into government with the Green Party and Fianna Fáil&#x27;s historical rivals, Fine Gael. A majority of 93 members of the Dáil voted in favour of him taking the role, while 63 members voted against him. As part of the agreement, Varadkar became Tánaiste in Martin&#x27;s government, and swapped roles with Martin in December 2022, approximately two-and-a-half years into the five-year parliamentary term.
In July 2020, following drunk-driving revelations, he sacked Barry Cowen as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Cowen&#x27;s successor Dara Calleary resigned that August following the Golfgate scandal, having attended a social hosted by the Oireachtas Golf Society which was contrary to national health guidelines surrounding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
In July 2021, Fianna Fáil suffered what many sources called the party&#x27;s worst-ever electoral defeat when the party polled extremely poorly in the 2021 Dublin Bay South by-election. Subsequently, there was much unrest within Fianna Fáil, with a number of TDs such as Jim O&#x27;Callaghan, Cathal Crowe, James Lawless and Marc MacSharry openly questioning in public whether or not Martin should lead the party into the next general election.

Late on 16 March 2022, Martin tested positive for COVID-19 while he was at an event in Washington, D.C., United States, being held for St Patrick&#x27;s Day. This meant Martin could not personally meet President of the United States Joe Biden at the White House as planned the next day. Biden and Martin met virtually instead, with Martin isolating in Blair House. Unable to return to Ireland as planned, Martin planned to chair the next cabinet meeting from the Irish embassy in Washington.

Martin made an official visit to Ukraine in July 2022 amidst the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This was the first official visit made by a Taoiseach to Ukraine. Martin stated he would provide support for Ukraine joining the European Union and condemned attacks on civilians.

As part of the 2020 coalition agreement between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party, Martin resigned as Taoiseach on 17 December 2022 to allow the appointment of Leo Varadkar as Taoiseach and the formation of a new government, which will be a continuation of the tri-party coalition for the remainder of the 33rd Dáil.

==Tánaiste, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Defence (2022–2025)==

On 17 December 2022, Martin was appointed Tánaiste, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Defence in a cabinet reshuffle after Leo Varadkar&#x27;s appointment as Taoiseach.

On 12 April 2023, Martin met with U.S. President Joe Biden as he toured Carlingford Castle and Dundalk in County Louth, during Biden&#x27;s four-day visit to the island of Ireland.

In 2023, Martin launched the Consultative Forum on International Security Policy, a 4-day, 3-city conference on the subject of International security, to be held in June. The programme for the forum has been criticised by the President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins.

In March 2024, Martin criticised the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip, saying that &quot;The use of starvation as a weapon of war is a blatant violation of international humanitarian law.&quot;

==Taoiseach (2025–present)==
At the 2024 general election, Martin was re-elected to the Dáil. Martin was awarded &quot;Politician of the Year&quot; by the Journal for his performance and election result. He was elected again as Taoiseach in a 95–76 vote by the Dáil on 23 January 2025 following a coalition agreement between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and with the support of several independent TDs.

==Political views==
In the early part of his career, Martin was considered to be a social conservative. However, after Martin altered his positions on abortion and same-sex marriage, it was considered that he had become more of a &quot;centrist&quot;. In 2023, Jack Sheehan of &quot;the Irish Times&quot; described Fianna Fáil and Martin by stating &quot;for a decade now, a socially conservative, supposedly republican party has been led by a centrist social liberal with a more cautious position on Irish unification than even Leo Varadkar.&quot;

===Abortion===
Prior to the 2010s, Martin opposed the legislation of abortion in Ireland.

In 2017, following discussions by the Citizens&#x27; Assembly, it became clear that there would be a referendum on the legality of abortion in Ireland. This prompted all political parties in Ireland to reexamine their positions on abortion in depth. Following internal debates, a majority of Fianna Fáil declared a &quot;pro-life&quot; position. However, Martin &quot;shocked&quot; his party when came out in favour of permitting abortion and later would endorse a Yes vote in the 2018 abortion referendum. Martin stated that his views had evolved after he heard testimony from women speaking about their pregnancies in the Oireachtas and that he had become simultaneously both &quot;pro-life&quot; and &quot;pro-choice&quot;;
Members of Fianna Fáil were not placed under a party whip on abortion and were free to vote and campaign either for or against abortion based on their personal views. By the time of the referendum itself, a majority of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party supported a No vote.

=== Cannabis ===
During a 2022 Dáil debate on legislation to decriminalise cannabis, Martin stated his concern about cannabis being &quot;glamorised&quot; and mentioned &quot;real concerns within the health community&quot; about cannabis. In 2023, as Tánaiste, Martin stated he was &quot;concerned&quot; about the legalisation of cannabis, but expressed his support for decriminalisation.

===Economics===
Speaking in 2024, Martin described himself as an advocate of free trade and specifically a supporter of EU-wide trade deals such as the CETA agreement with Canada. Martin contrasted himself against other Irish politicians who he suggested were more protectionist. Martin stressed the importance of foreign direct investment and suggested some Irish political parties take it &quot;for granted&quot;. 

===LGBT rights===
In 2012, Martin clashed with Taoiseach Enda Kenny over the issue of same-sex marriage; Martin needled Kenny in the Dáil to declare a firm position on same-sex marriage and urged him to press ahead with a referendum. In 2015, Martin supported a Yes vote in the 2015 marriage equality referendum. In 2019, Martin voiced his support for a similar referendum in Northern Ireland. In 2021, Martin condemned legislation passed in Hungary which prohibited gay people from featuring in educational material, describing it as &quot;unacceptable&quot; and saying a strong response was needed from the European Union.

In 2021, Martin expressed openness to changing laws regarding transgender teenagers and self-identification, stating he believed that &quot;we should consult young trans people to hear their views&quot;. In a 2022 interview with NXF, Martin said he had &quot;no time&quot; for a &quot;toxic&quot; discussion on transgender people, saying &quot;acceptance is key&quot; and &quot;we should fully accept and acknowledge their identity in the first instance&quot;.

===Physical-force Irish republicanism=== 
Martin, citing Jon Boutcher of Operation Kenova, &quot;Say Nothing&quot; by Patrick Radden Keefe, and &quot;Killing Thatcher&quot; by Rory Carroll says he believes the Troubles was a &quot;futile war&quot; in which the Provisional IRA did &quot;more damage to their own people&quot; than otherwise. Martin has said that period of history should never be &quot;triumphalised&quot; and those born after the conflict should not be led to believe there was any glory in it. Martin also attributes the Troubles as a major contributor to the economic depression felt in Ireland during the 1970s and 1980s.

==Personal life==

Martin met Mary O&#x27;Shea at university; they later married in 1990 and had a total of five children. Their son, Ruairí, died at five weeks old in 2000 from sudden infant death syndrome. Their seven-year-old daughter, Léana, died in October 2010 shortly before her eighth birthday at London&#x27;s Great Ormond Street Hospital after suffering from a heart condition. His three other children are Cillian, Aoibhe, and Micheál Aodh, who is a Gaelic football goalkeeper.

<text>The Protocol of Peace, Friendship, and Boundaries between Peru and Ecuador, or Rio Protocol for short, was an international agreement signed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on January 29, 1942, by the foreign ministers of Peru and Ecuador, with the participation of the United States, Brazil, Chile, and Argentina as guarantors. The Protocol was intended to finally resolve the long-running territorial dispute between the two countries, and brought about the official end of the Ecuadorian–Peruvian War of 1941–1942. Nevertheless, the Protocol was incomplete, and war broke out between Peru and Ecuador twice more, in 1981 and in 1995, before the signing of the Itamaraty Peace Declaration which brought final resolution to the dispute.

==History==

In May 1941, as tensions at the Ecuadorian-Peruvian border mounted and war was imminent, the governments of the United States, Brazil, and Argentina offered their services in aiding in the mediation of the dispute. Their efforts failed to prevent the outbreak of hostilities on July 23, 1941, but the diplomatic intervention led to a definitive cease-fire being put into place on July 31. Despite this, limited skirmishes continued to occur through the months of August and September in the Ecuadorian provinces of El Oro and Loja, as well as in the Amazonian lands. Ecuador accused Peru of continuing its advances into the highland province of Azuay.

On October 2, with military observers from the three mediating countries serving as witnesses, Ecuador and Peru signed the Talara Accord, which created a demilitarized zone inside the provinces of El Oro and Loja, pending the signing of a definitive peace treaty. Diplomatic efforts continued, with the mediating countries being joined by Chile.

With its recent entry into World War II, the United States was eager to present a united American continent. At the third Pan-American Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the United States encouraged a settlement between the two countries.

On January 29, 1942, on the final day of the third Pan-American Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro, the foreign ministers of Ecuador and Peru, Julio Tobar Donoso and Alfredo Solf y Muro, signed a &quot;Protocol of Peace, Friendship, and Boundaries&quot;, known as the Rio de Janeiro Protocol. The observers from the United States, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile co-signed the document, becoming &quot;Guarantors of the Protocol&quot;. The Rio Protocol was subsequently ratified by each country&#x27;s congress on February 26, 1942.

By the terms of the Protocol, Ecuador agreed to withdraw its long-standing claim for rights to direct land access to the Marañon and Amazon rivers; Peru agreed to withdraw Peruvian military forces from Ecuadorian territory. An area of of hitherto disputed territory in the Maynas region of the Amazonian basin was awarded to Peru, which had been established to be the &quot;de facto&quot; possessor of the land since the end of the 19th century. The &quot;status quo&quot; line defined in the 1936 Lima Accord was used as the basis for the definitive border line; the previous border recognized current possessions, but not sovereignty. Relative to the 1936 line, Ecuador ceded 18,552 km2 of previously possessed territory to Peru, while Peru ceded 5,072 km2 of previously possessed territory to Ecuador.

During the 1960s, the Ecuadorian government alleged that the Protocol was invalid, because it had been signed under coercion while foreign troops were stationed on Ecuadorian soil. This stance was modified by subsequent governments, but was never officially reverted until the resolution of the dispute in 1995.

The intended goal of the Rio Protocol was not fulfilled until the signing of the Itamaraty Peace Declaration in 1995. Between the signing of the two treaties, the Paquisha Incident and the Cenepa War rekindled the dispute.

<text>Michael Oser Rabin (; born September 1, 1931) is an Israeli mathematician, computer scientist, and recipient of the Turing Award.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education ===
Rabin was born in 1931 in Breslau, Germany (today Wrocław, in Poland), the son of a rabbi. In 1935, he emigrated with his family to Mandatory Palestine. As a young boy, he was very interested in mathematics and his father sent him to the best high school in Haifa, where he studied under mathematician Elisha Netanyahu, who was then a high school teacher.

Rabin graduated from the Hebrew Reali School in Haifa in 1948, and was drafted into the army during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The mathematician Abraham Fraenkel, who was a professor of mathematics in Jerusalem, intervened with the army command, and Rabin was discharged to study at the university in 1949. Afterwards, he received an M.Sc from Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He began graduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania before receiving a Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1956.

=== Career ===
Rabin became Associate Professor of Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley (1961–62) and MIT (1962-63). Before moving to Harvard University as Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science in 1981, he was a professor at the Hebrew University.

In the late 1950s, he was invited for a summer to do research for IBM at the Lamb Estate in Westchester County, New York with other promising mathematicians and scientists. It was there that he and Dana Scott wrote the paper &quot;Finite Automata and Their Decision Problems&quot;. Soon, using nondeterministic automata, they were able to re-prove Kleene&#x27;s result that finite state machines exactly accept regular languages.

As to the origins of what was to become computational complexity theory, the next summer Rabin returned to the Lamb Estate. John McCarthy posed a puzzle to him about spies, guards, and passwords, which Rabin studied and soon after he wrote an article, &quot;Degree of Difficulty of Computing a Function and Hierarchy of Recursive Sets.&quot;

Nondeterministic machines have become a key concept in computational complexity theory, particularly with the description of the complexity classes P and NP.

Rabin then returned to Jerusalem, researching logic, and working on the foundations of what would later be known as computer science. He was an associate professor and the head of the Institute of Mathematics at the Hebrew University at 29 years old, and a full professor by 33. Rabin recalls, &quot;There was absolutely no appreciation of the work on the issues of computing. Mathematicians did not recognize the emerging new field&quot;.

In 1960, he was invited by Edward F. Moore to work at Bell Labs, where Rabin introduced probabilistic automata that employ coin tosses in order to decide which state transitions to take. He showed examples of regular languages that required a very large number of states, but for which you get an exponential reduction of the number of states with probabilistic automata.

In 1966 (published in conference proceedings in 1967), Rabin introduced the notion of polynomial time (introduced independently and very shortly before by Cobham and Edmonds).

In 1969, Rabin introduced infinite-tree automata and proved that the monadic second-order theory of &quot;n&quot; successors (S2S when &quot;n&quot; = 2) is decidable. A key component of the proof implicitly showed determinacy of parity games, which lie in the third level of the Borel hierarchy.

In 1975, Rabin finished his tenure as Rector of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the USA as a visiting professor. While there, Rabin invented the Miller–Rabin primality test, a randomized algorithm that can determine very quickly (but with a tiny probability of error) whether a number is prime. Rabin&#x27;s method was based on previous work of Gary Miller that solved the problem deterministically with the assumption that the generalized Riemann hypothesis is true, but Rabin&#x27;s version of the test made no such assumption. Fast primality testing is key in the successful implementation of most public-key cryptography, and in 2003 Miller, Rabin, Robert M. Solovay, and Volker Strassen were given the Paris Kanellakis Award for their work on primality testing.

In 1976 he was invited by Joseph Traub to meet at Carnegie Mellon University and presented the primality test, which Traub called &quot;revolutionary&quot;. 

In 1979, Rabin invented the Rabin cryptosystem, the first asymmetric cryptosystem whose security was proved equivalent to the intractability of integer factorization.

In 1981, Rabin reinvented a weak variant of the technique of oblivious transfer invented by Wiesner under the name of multiplexing, allowing a sender to transmit a message to a receiver where the receiver has some probability between 0 and 1 of learning the message, with the sender being unaware whether the receiver was able to do so.

In 1987, Rabin, together with Richard Karp, created one of the most well-known efficient string search algorithms, the Rabin–Karp string search algorithm, known for its rolling hash.

Rabin&#x27;s more recent research has concentrated on computer security. He is currently the Thomas J. Watson Sr. Professor of Computer Science, Emeritus at Harvard University and Professor of Computer Science (Emeritus) at Hebrew University. During the spring semester of 2007, he was a visiting professor at Columbia University teaching &quot;Introduction to Cryptography&quot;.

== Awards and honours==
Rabin is a foreign member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, a member of the American Philosophical Society, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the
French Academy of Sciences, and a foreign member of the Royal Society.

In 1976, the Turing Award was awarded jointly to Rabin and Dana Scott for a paper written in 1959, the citation for which states that the award was granted:
&quot;For their joint paper &quot;Finite Automata and Their Decision Problems,&quot; which introduced the idea of nondeterministic machines, which has proved to be an enormously valuable concept. Their (Scott &amp; Rabin) classic paper has been a continuous source of inspiration for subsequent work in this field.&quot;
In 1995, Rabin was awarded the Israel Prize, in computer sciences. In 2010, Rabin was awarded the Tel Aviv University Dan David Prize (&quot;Future&quot; category), jointly with Leonard Kleinrock and Gordon E. Moore, for Computers and Telecommunications. Rabin was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Science from Harvard University in 2017.

==Personal life==
Rabin has a daughter, computer scientist Tal Rabin.

<text>The Mangy Parrot: The Life and Times of Periquillo Sarniento Written by himself for his Children () by Mexican author José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi, is generally considered the first novel written and published in Latin America. &quot;El Periquillo&quot; was written in 1816, though due to government censorship the last of four volumes was not published until 1831. The novel has been continuously in print in more than twenty editions since then.

Lizardi has been recognized as the precursor of the romantic literature in Mexico, an author product of the Enlightenment and rebellious nature. He published one of the first newspapers of insurgent Mexico, which he titled with what would later become his pseudonym, the Mexican Thinker; The printing press was closed by the viceregal government on the accusation that it perniciously stimulated the imagination of its readers and could cause another rebellion in the New Spain.
&quot;El Periquillo Sarniento&quot; can be read as a nation-building novel, written at a critical moment in the transition of Mexico (and Latin America) from colony to independence. Jean Franco has characterized the novel as &quot;a ferocious indictment of Spanish administration in Mexico: ignorance, superstition and corruption are seen to be its most notable characteristics&quot;.

Given Lizardi&#x27;s career as a pioneering Mexican journalist, his novel can also be read as a journal of opinion in the guise of a picaresque novel. It follows the adventures of Pedro Sarmiento (nicknamed &quot;Periquillo Sarniento&quot; or &quot;Mangy Parrot&quot; by his disreputable friends), who, like Lizardi himself, is the son of a &quot;Criollo&quot; family from Mexico City with more pretensions to &quot;good birth&quot; than means of support. The story begins with Periquillo&#x27;s birth and miseducation and continues through his endless attempts to make an unearned living, as a student, a friar, a gambler, a notary, a barber, a pharmacist, a doctor, a beggar, a soldier, a count, and a thief, until late in life he sees the light and begins to lead an honest life.

At every point along the way, Lizardi uses the deathbed voice of the elderly and repentant Periquillo to lambast the social conditions that led to his wasted life. In this, the novelist mimics the role of the early nineteenth-century journalist more interested in arguing opinions than relating mundane incidents. The marriage of slapstick humor with moralizing social commentary, established in &quot;El Periquillo&quot;, remained a constant in the Mexican novels that followed on its heels throughout the nineteenth century. Agustín Yáñez justifies this often criticized &quot;moralizing&quot; tendency in Lizardi as &quot;a constant in the artistic production of Mexico... and moreover, it is a constant in Mexican life&quot;.

At the same time, as critics have noted, Lizardi&#x27;s interest in depicting the realities and reproducing the speech of Mexicans from all social classes make his novel a bridge between the inherited picaresque mold that forms its overt structure and the costumbrista novels of the nineteenth century.

==Place in Lizardi&#x27;s Work==

José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi is emblematic of the generation of intellectuals, artists, and writers who led Mexico into the modern era. His own life history resonates with the ambivalences and outright contradictions of a world between colonial rule and independence. His writings — four novels, several fables, two plays, dozens of poems, over 250 articles and pamphlets — are important in three ways: as artistic expressions in themselves; as texts that contributed in vital ways to the intellectual life of Mexico early in its independence; and as windows into the daily life of that period.

Of Lizardi&#x27;s many published works, &quot;El Periquillo Sarniento&quot; remains the most important. It typifies the dual impulse of his writing: to entertain and to edify. It is also a lively, comic novel that captures much of the reality of Mexico in 1816. In his subsequent novels &quot;Noches tristes&quot; (1818) and &quot;La Quijotita y su prima&quot; (1818–19), Lizardi&#x27;s didactic side won out over his will to entertain. &quot;La Quijotita&quot; in particular is an exercise in moralizing, populated with flat characters whose function is to model particular foibles or virtues. Lizardi&#x27;s last novel, &quot;Don Catrín de la Fachenda&quot; (1820), has on the contrary been held up by some critics as superior to &quot;El Periquillo&quot;. In &quot;Don Catrín&quot;, Lizardi took pains to respond to critics of the overt moralizing in his first novel. The result is a slimmed-down, artistically unified, more ironic, and darker picaresque. Yet &quot;El Periquillo&quot; retains its importance. As Antonio Benítez-Rojo writes, citing Benedict Anderson&#x27;s use of &quot;El Periquillo&quot; as an exemplar of the anti-colonial novel, &quot;the illusion of accompanying Periquillo along the roads and through the villages and towns of the viceroyalty helped awaken in the novel&#x27;s readers the desire for nationness.&quot; &quot;Don Catrín&quot; &quot;is artistically superior to El Periquillo Sarniento,&quot; Benítez-Rojo continues, &quot;yet for all its defects the latter, because of its great vitality, is a major work of Mexican literature.&quot;

Finally, &quot;El Periquillo&quot; has the virtue of being the first, as Lizardi himself noted: &quot;I am far from believing that I have written a masterpiece that is free from defects: it has many that I recognize, and must have others still that I have not noticed; but it also has one undeniable distinction, which is that of being the first novel that has been written in this country by an American in three hundred years.&quot; Because of its status as the first novel written by a Latin American and one emulated by generations of Mexican novelists, &quot;El Periquillo Sarniento&quot; appears on many &quot;must-read&quot; lists for graduate programs in Latin American literature, and it is of equal interest to students of Latin American history.

==Print editions of &quot;El Periquillo&quot; in Spanish and English==

*The most widely available edition in Spanish of &quot;El Periquillo Sarniento&quot;, edited and annotated by Jefferson Rea Spell, is published in Mexico by Editorial Porrúa (many editions since 1949).
*An excellent new edition, edited and annotated by Carmen Ruiz Barrionuevo, was published in Madrid by Ediciones Cátedra in 1997, but has since gone out of print.
*A partial translation of &quot;El Periquillo Sarniento&quot; into English was published in 1942 by Doubleday under the title The Itching Parrot. Katherine Anne Porter, the translator, concentrated on the lively picaresque novel and stripped it of its journalistic pamphlet parts.
*A new and unabridged English translation by David Frye, The Mangy Parrot (2004), is published by Hackett Publishing Company. 
*An abridgment of the Hackett translation is published under the title The Mangy Parrot, Abridged (2005).

<doc id="298406" wikidata="Q995633" url="?curid=298406" title="Michael Woods (Irish politician)">
<text>Michael Joseph Woods (born 8 December 1935) is an Irish former Fianna Fáil politician who served as Government Chief Whip from July 1979 to December 1979, Minister for Social Welfare from 1979 to 1981, 1987 to 1991, March 1982 to December 1982 and 1993 to 1994, Minister for Health from 1979 to 1981, March 1982 to December 1982 and November 1994 to December 1994, Minister for Agriculture and Food from 1991 to 1992, Minister for the Marine from 1992 to 1993, Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources from 1997 to 2000 and Minister for Education and Science from 2000 to 2002. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1977 to 2011.

==Early life==
Woods was born in County Wicklow in December 1935. He was educated at Christian Brothers in Synge Street, Dublin; University College Dublin and Harvard Business School. He qualified with a degree in Agricultural science and a PhD in science.

==Political career==
Woods joined Fianna Fáil in 1968. At the 1977 general election he stood for the Dáil in the Dublin Clontarf constituency as a Fianna Fáil candidate and was elected alongside Fianna Fáil stalwart George Colley. From 1981 to 2011, he was elected for the Dublin North-East constituency. In 1979, Jack Lynch appointed him as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Government Chief Whip). That same year Woods supported Colley in his leadership bid, but the other candidate, Charles Haughey, was successful.

Despite Woods having supported Colley, Haughey appointed him Minister for Health and Social Welfare. He held that post until 1981, and again in the short-lived 1982 government. In 1987, Fianna Fáil returned to power and he returned as Minister for Social Welfare. In 1991, he became Minister for Agriculture and Food. In 1992, Woods entered the contest to succeed Haughey as leader. He received little support and withdrew from the contest. The eventual victor, Albert Reynolds, retained Woods as Minister for the Marine in his new cabinet. Following the formation of the Fianna Fáil–Labour Party coalition in 1993, Woods remained in the cabinet, this time with the Social Welfare portfolio, and—after the mass resignation of the Labour ministers—was additionally appointed Minister for Health.

After three years in opposition, Fianna Fáil returned to power in 1997. Woods was appointed Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. He introduced a £70 million overhaul of Ireland&#x27;s fishing fleet and also launched a new maritime college. In the cabinet reshuffle in 2000, he replaced Micheál Martin as Minister for Education. Woods was not retained in the cabinet following the 2002 general election. He was Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs from 2002 to 2007.

He retired from politics at the 2011 general election.

==Controversies==
While serving as Minister for Education, Woods signed a controversial agreement with 18 Irish religious orders involved in child sex-abuse scandals which limited their compensation liability to the victims of abuse to only €128 million. This compensation scheme is projected to eventually cost the Irish government €1.35 billion. The agreement was signed just before the 2002 general election and consequently was not laid before the cabinet for its approval. It then remained unpublished for several months.

In 2003, after brokering the deal, Woods claimed his strong Catholic faith made him the most suitable person to negotiate the deal. He also denied allegations that he was a member of Opus Dei or the Knights of Saint Columbanus after the group Survivors of Child Abuse alleged he was a member of the former.

After the publication of the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (CICA), Woods defended the deal; he claimed the Department of Education and Science had the management role in the schools in question and that the state knew all the details when making the deal. Mary Raftery criticised his remarks, pointing out that some of them contradicted remarks made by Woods himself.

<doc id="298407" wikidata="Q599170" url="?curid=298407" title="Antoninianus">
<text>The antoninianus or pre-reform radiate was a coin used during the Roman Empire thought to have been valued at 2 &quot;denarii&quot;. It was initially silver, but was slowly debased to bronze with a minimal silver content. The coin was introduced by Caracalla in early 215 AD. It was silver, similar to the &quot;denarius&quot;, except that it was slightly larger and featured the emperor wearing a radiate crown, indicating it was a double denomination. &quot;Antoniniani&quot; depicting women (usually the emperor&#x27;s wife) featured the bust resting upon a crescent moon.

Even at its introduction, the silver content of the &quot;antoninianus&quot; was only equal to 1.5 &quot;denarii&quot;. This created inflation: people rapidly hoarded the &quot;denarii&quot; (Gresham&#x27;s law), while both buyers and sellers recognized the new coin had a lower intrinsic value and elevated their prices to compensate. Silver bullion supplies began running short because the Roman Empire was no longer conquering new territory, the Iberian silver mines had been exhausted, and a series of soldier emperors and usurpers needed coin to pay their troops and buy their loyalty. Each new issue of the &quot;antoninianus&quot; thus had less silver in it than the last, and thus contributed to ever-increasing inflation.

In 271 AD, Aurelian increased the average weight of the &quot;antoninianus&quot;, this change lasting for only a short time. Around this time, the enigmatic &quot;XXI&quot; was first marked on the reverse of the &quot;antoninianus&quot;. The true meaning of this series of numbers is still a topic of debate, but is thought to represent a 20:1 silver ratio (4.76% silver, which may originally have been 5%, if worn-away silver enrichment on the surface is allowed for).

By the late 3rd century AD, &quot;antoniniani&quot; were almost entirely made of bronze reclaimed from melted-down older issues like the &quot;sestertius&quot;. Vast quantities were minted, with a large percentage of the circulating stock being contemporary forgeries, often with blundered legends and designs. Individual coins were by then practically worthless, and were lost or discarded by the millions. The resultant situation was not unlike the hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic in 1920s Germany, when paper money was printed in reckless abundance. The coin ceased to be used by the end of the 3rd century, when a series of monetary reforms attempted to arrest the decline by issuing new coinage.
Today most of these coins are extremely common finds, with a few scarcer examples including Aemilianus, Marcus Aurelius Marius, Quietus, and Regalianus. 

Modern numismatists use &quot;antoninianus&quot; because it is not known what it was called in antiquity. An ancient Roman document called the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; (of generally low reliability) refers to silver coins named after an Antoninus on several occasions (several Roman emperors in the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries bore this name). Because Caracalla&#x27;s silver coin was a new issue, and he had taken Antoninus as part of his imperial name, an association (though likely false) was made with it, and the name stuck.

<doc id="298408" wikidata="Q2372570" url="?curid=298408" title="Brownian tree">
<text>In probability theory, the Brownian tree, or Aldous tree, or Continuum Random Tree (CRT) is a random real tree that can be defined from a Brownian excursion. The Brownian tree was defined and studied by David Aldous in three articles published in 1991 and 1993. This tree has since then been generalized.

This random tree has several equivalent definitions and constructions: using sub-trees generated by finitely many leaves, using a Brownian excursion, Poisson separating a straight line or as a limit of Galton-Watson trees.

Intuitively, the Brownian tree is a binary tree whose nodes (or branching points) are dense in the tree; which is to say that for any distinct two points of the tree, there will always exist a node between them. It is a fractal object which can be approximated with computers or by physical processes with dendritic structures.

== Definitions ==
The following definitions are different characterisations of a Brownian tree, they are taken from Aldous&#x27;s three articles. The notions of &quot;leaf, node, branch, root&quot; are the intuitive notions on a tree (for details, see real trees).

=== Finite-dimensional laws ===
This definition gives the finite-dimensional laws of the subtrees generated by finitely many leaves.

Let us consider the space of all binary trees with formula_1 leaves numbered from formula_2 to formula_1. These trees have formula_4 edges with lengths formula_5. A tree is then defined by its shape formula_6 (which is to say the order of the nodes) and the edge lengths. We define a probability law formula_7 of a random variable formula_8 on this space by:

: formula_9

where formula_10.

In other words, formula_11 depends not on the shape of the tree but rather on the total sum of all the edge lengths.

In other words, the Brownian tree is defined from the laws of all the finite sub-trees one can generate from it.

=== Continuous tree ===
The Brownian tree is a real tree defined from a Brownian excursion (see characterisation 4 in Real tree).

Let formula_12be a Brownian excursion. Define a pseudometric formula_13 on formula_14 with

: formula_15 for any formula_16

We then define an equivalence relation, noted formula_17 on formula_14 which relates all points formula_19 such that formula_20 .

: formula_21

formula_13 is then a distance on the quotient space formula_23. 

It is customary to consider the excursion formula_24 rather than formula_25.

=== Poisson line-breaking construction ===
This is also called &quot;stick-breaking construction&quot;.

Consider a non-homogeneous Poisson point process with intensity formula_26. In other words, for any formula_27, formula_28 is a Poisson variable with parameter formula_29. Let formula_30 be the points of formula_31. Then the lengths of the intervals formula_32 are exponential variables with decreasing means. We then make the following construction:

* (&quot;initialisation&quot;) The first step is to pick a random point formula_33 uniformly on the interval formula_34. Then we glue the segment formula_35 to formula_33 (mathematically speaking, we define a new distance). We obtain a tree formula_37 with a root (the point 0), two leaves (formula_38 and formula_39), as well as one binary branching point (the point formula_33).
* (&quot;iteration&quot;) At step , the segment formula_41 is similarly glued to the tree formula_42, on a uniformly random point of formula_42.

This algorithm may be used to simulate numerically Brownian trees.

=== Limit of Galton-Watson trees ===
Consider a Galton-Watson tree whose reproduction law has finite non-zero variance, conditioned to have formula_44 nodes. Let formula_45 be this tree, with the edge lengths divided by formula_46. In other words, each edge has length formula_47. The construction can be formalized by considering the Galton-Watson tree as a metric space or by using renormalized contour processes.
G_n&lt;/math&gt; converges in distribution to a random real tree, which we call a Brownian tree.
| name = Definition and Theorem

Here, the limit used is the convergence in distribution of stochastic processes in the Skorokhod space (if we consider the contour processes) or the convergence in distribution defined from the Hausdorff distance (if we consider the metric spaces).

<text>Johnny Shuggie Otis (born Johnny Alexander Veliotes Jr.; November 30, 1953) is an American singer-songwriter, recording artist, and multi-instrumentalist. His parents are Johnny Otis and Phyllis Latrecia Otis.

Otis&#x27;s composition &quot;Strawberry Letter 23&quot; as recorded by The Brothers Johnson topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart and reached #5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in 1977. He achieved commercial success with his 1974 single &quot;Inspiration Information&quot; (from the album of the same title), reaching #56 on the R&amp;B chart.

==Biography==
Born in Los Angeles, California, Otis is the son of rhythm and blues musician, bandleader, and impresario Johnny Otis, who was of Greek descent, and his wife Phyllis Walker, who was of African American and Filipino descent. The name &quot;Shuggie&quot; (short for &quot;sugar&quot;, according to his mother) was coined by Phyllis when he was a newborn. Otis began playing guitar when he was two years old and performing professionally with his father&#x27;s band at the age of eleven, often disguising himself with dark glasses and a false mustache so that he could play with his father&#x27;s band in after-hours nightclubs.

Otis is primarily known as a guitarist and also sings and plays a multitude of other instruments. While growing up with and being heavily influenced by many blues, jazz and R&amp;B musicians in his father&#x27;s immediate circle, Otis began to gravitate towards the popular music of his generation such as Jimi Hendrix, Arthur Lee (of the band Love), and Sly Stone.

In 1969, Al Kooper asked Otis to be the featured guest on the second installment (&quot;Kooper Session&quot;) of the &quot;Super Session&quot; album series that had previously included Stephen Stills and Mike Bloomfield. Kooper and the then-fifteen-year-old Otis recorded the whole album over one weekend in New York. After returning to Los Angeles, Otis, along with his father and singer Delmar &quot;Mighty Mouth&quot; Evans, performed on the album &quot;Cold Shot&quot; (by the elder Otis), released in 1969 on the Los Angeles-based Kent label. Another obscure album this three-man team recorded was the extremely rare and risque &quot;Snatch &amp; The Poontangs&quot;, on which Otis recorded tracks under the pseudonym &quot;Prince Wunnerful&quot;.

Otis released his first solo album later that year entitled &quot;Here Comes Shuggie Otis&quot; on Epic Records. Guest musicians on his debut included Johnny, Leon Haywood, Al McKibbon, Wilton Felder. This further established his reputation and catapulted him to the attention of B. B. King, who was quoted in a 1970 issue of &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine saying Otis was his &quot;favorite new guitarist&quot;. Some of the artists Otis performed and recorded with during that time include Frank Zappa (having played electric bass on the instrumental, &quot;Peaches en Regalia&quot; from the 1969 album &quot;Hot Rats&quot;), Etta James, Eddie Vinson, Richard Berry, Louis Jordan, and Bobby &#x27;Blue&#x27; Bland, among many others.

The album Otis received the most recognition for was his second Epic Records release in 1971, &quot;Freedom Flight&quot;, which featured his hit &quot;Strawberry Letter 23&quot;. Both the album and single reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively and caught the attention of Brothers Johnson guitarist George Johnson, who then played it for producer Quincy Jones. They covered the song and it became a hit. Even though Otis played most of his own parts in the studio, the lineup on this album was quite extensive, including keyboardist George Duke and Aynsley Dunbar of Frank Zappa, Journey and Whitesnake fame.

In 1974, Otis released &quot;Inspiration Information&quot;, his third and final album for Epic Records. The album had taken almost three years to finish. All the songs were written and arranged by Otis himself, who played every musical instrument on the album, except for horns and some strings. &quot;Inspiration Information&quot; had but one single (the title track) reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. After the album&#x27;s release, Otis was approached by Billy Preston on behalf of The Rolling Stones, asking him to join the band for their upcoming world tour. He declined the offer, along with the chance to work with Quincy Jones in helping produce Otis&#x27;s next album. After a series of similar refusals, Otis gained the reputation of &quot;taking his time&quot;, and his recording contract with Epic Records was nullified. Otis&#x27;s only credited works throughout the mid-1970s were done as a session musician for his father&#x27;s recording projects.

&quot;Inspiration Information&quot; gained a cult following during the 1990s with the emergence of rare groove and acid jazz. It was lauded by such musicians as Prince and Lenny Kravitz. Due in part to this regained interest, the album was re-released on April 3, 2001, by David Byrne&#x27;s independent label Luaka Bop Records. This CD re-issue includes all nine original album tracks plus four songs taken from Otis&#x27; 1971 album &quot;Freedom Flight&quot;, and features new cover art, liner notes, and exclusive never-seen-before photos.

Otis is featured in every one of his father Johnny&#x27;s books, as well as &quot;Alligator Records Presents West Coast Blues&quot;, issued in August 1998.

Otis and Sony Music Entertainment made a deal for a double CD which was released on April 20, 2013. It is a re-release of &quot;Inspiration/Information&quot;. Added to the album are several bonus tracks, including an accompanying album entitled &quot;Wings of Love&quot;. &quot;Wings of Love&quot; is an album of previously unreleased material, all of which was written from 1975 to the present, including live material from some of his performances. It will be available on Shugiterius records (Otis&#x27;s company) and Sony records, through Sony Music Entertainment.

Otis and a band entitled Shuggie Otis Rite toured internationally in 2013 in support of the release, including Australia, Japan, the U.S., Ireland and the U.K. Their performances earned rave reviews from critics.

A new, mostly instrumental, album was released in April 2018 titled &quot;Inter-Fusion&quot;.

==Personal life==
Otis had a son named Johnny III, known as Lucky Otis, with his first wife Miss Mercy of The GTOs, an all-girl group produced by Frank Zappa. Soon after his first marriage ended, he married Lillian Wilson (known as Teri), daughter of trumpeter/bandleader/Latin-jazz pioneer Gerald Wilson; they had a son, Eric, naming him after Eric Dolphy, who was one of Gerald&#x27;s bandmates and close friends.

Both of Shuggie&#x27;s sons, Lucky and Eric, are musicians. Eric has played and toured in his father&#x27;s band. Lucky, a bassist, began by playing with his grandfather, Johnny Otis, and then launched a solo career, heading his own group Otis Ledbetter with partner Louis Ledbetter, great-grandson of blues musician Lead Belly. He has also fronted a 13-piece rhythm-and-blues orchestra, The New Johnny Otis All-Stars, continuing his grandfather&#x27;s Big Band legacy.

<text>Deborah Frances Tannen (born June 7, 1945) is an American author and professor of linguistics at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Best known as the author of &quot;You Just Don&#x27;t Understand&quot;, she has been a McGraw Distinguished Lecturer at Princeton University and was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences following a term in residence at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.

Tannen is the author of thirteen books, including &quot;That&#x27;s Not What I Meant!&quot; and &quot;You Just Don&#x27;t Understand&quot;, the latter of which spent four years on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Sellers list, including eight consecutive months at number one. She is also a frequent contributor to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot; magazine, among other publications.

==Education==
Tannen graduated from Hunter College High School and completed her undergraduate studies at Harpur College (now part of Binghamton University) with a B.A. in English literature. Tannen went on to earn a master&#x27;s in English literature at Wayne State University. Later, she continued her academic studies at UC Berkeley, earning an M.A. and a Ph.D. in linguistics (1979) with a dissertation entitled &quot;Processes and consequences of conversational style&quot;. She took up a position at Georgetown in 1979 and subsequently became a Distinguished University Professor in Linguistics there.

==Writing career==
Tannen has written and edited numerous academic publications on linguistics, discourse analysis, and interpersonal communication. She has published many books including &quot;Conversational Style: Analyzing Talk Among Friends&quot;; &quot;Talking Voices: Repetition, Dialogue and Imagery in Conversational Discourse&quot;; &quot;Gender and Discourse&quot;; and &quot;The Handbook of Discourse Analysis&quot;. Her major theoretical contribution, presented in &quot;Talking Voices&quot;, is a poetics of conversation. She demonstrates that everyday conversation is made up of linguistic features that are traditionally regarded as literary, such as repetition, dialogue, and imagery.

Tannen has also written nine general-audience books on interpersonal communication and public discourse as well as a memoir. She became well known in the United States after her book &quot;You Just Don&#x27;t Understand: Women and Men in Conversation&quot; was published in 1990. It remained on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for nearly four years, and was subsequently translated into 30 other languages. She has written several other general-audience books and mainstream articles between 1983 and 2017.

Two of her other books, &quot;You Were Always Mom&#x27;s Favorite!: Sisters in Conversation Throughout Their Lives&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Wearing THAT?: Understanding Mothers and Daughters in Conversation&quot; were also &quot;New York Times&quot; best sellers. &quot;The Argument Culture&quot; received the Common Ground Book Award, and &quot;I Only Say This Because I Love You&quot; received a Books for a Better Life Award.

==Research==
===Overview===

Tannen&#x27;s main research has focused on the expression of interpersonal relationships in conversational interaction. Tannen has explored conversational interaction and style differences at a number of different levels and as related to different situations, including differences in conversational style as connected to the gender and cultural background, as well as speech that is tailored for specific listeners based on the speaker&#x27;s social role. In particular, Tannen has done extensive gender-linked research and writing that focused on miscommunications between men and women, which later developed into what is now known as the genderlect theory of communication. However, some linguists have argued against Tannen&#x27;s claims from a feminist standpoint.

Tannen&#x27;s research began when she analyzed her friends while working on her Ph.D. Since then, she has collected several naturally occurring conversations on tape and conducted interviews as forms of data for later analysis. She has also compiled and analyzed information from other researchers in order to draw out notable trends in various types of conversations, sometimes borrowing and expanding on their terminology to emphasize new points of interest.

===Gender differences in US family interaction===
Tannen highlighted the &quot;Telling Your Day&quot; ritual that takes place in many U.S. families, in which, typically, the mother in a two-parent family encourages a child to share details (about their day which the mother has typically already heard about) with the father. She also emphasizes the common occurrence of the &quot;troubles talk&quot; ritual in women. This ritual involves a woman sharing details about &quot;a frustrating experience&quot; or other previously encountered problem with a confidant. She cites this ritual as an example of how, for many women, closeness is established through sharing personal details. As one example of gender-linked misinterpretations, Tannen points out that a man who is on the receiving end of &quot;troubles talk&quot; from his wife will often take the mention of a problem and how it was handled as an invitation to pass judgment, despite the fact that &quot;troubles talk&quot; is simply an expository experience meant to enhance emotional connections.

===Interplay of connection maneuvers and power maneuvers in family conversations===
Tannen once described family discourse as &quot;a prime example…of the nexus of needs for both power and connection in human relationships. She coined the term &quot;connection maneuvers&quot; to describe interactions that take place in the closeness dimension of the traditional model of power and connection; this term is meant to contrast with the &quot;control maneuvers&quot;, which, according to psychologists Millar, Rogers, and Bavelas, take place in the power dimension of the same model.

Tannen challenged the conventional view of power (hierarchy) and connection (solidarity) as &quot;unidimensional and mutually exclusive&quot; and offered her own kind of model for mapping the interplay of these two aspects of communication, which takes the form of a two-dimensional grid (Figure 1). 

In this model, the vertical axis represents the level of power in the interaction, and the horizontal axis represents connection. Having presented this model, Tannen proposed that in the American paradigm, a sibling relationship would be mapped in the bottom left quadrant, as there is a high level of closeness and a relative equality that is not comparable to the power dynamic in an American parent/child relationship. Using this new model, Tannen argues that connection maneuvers do not only occur independently of control maneuvers. Among other examples, she mentions a wife who refuses to let her husband take over making popcorn by saying &quot;You always burn it&quot;. According to Tannen, the wife&#x27;s resistance to her husband&#x27;s request is a control maneuver, but by citing a potential undesirable effect for her family (i.e. burnt popcorn), she ties a connection maneuver into her attempt to enforce a decision.

Tannen also highlights ventriloquizing – which she explains as a &quot;phenomenon by which a person speaks not only for another but also as another&quot; – as a strategy for integrating connection maneuvers into other types of interactions. As an example of this, she cites an exchange recorded by her research team in which a mother attempts to convince her son to pick up his toys by ventriloquizing the family&#x27;s dogs: &quot;[extra high pitch] We&#x27;re naughty, but we&#x27;re not as naughty as Jared&quot;.

===Conversational style===
Tannen describes the notion of conversational style as &quot;a semantic process&quot; and &quot;the way meaning is encoded in and derived from speech&quot;. She cites the work of R. Lakoff and J. Gumperz as the inspiration behind her thinking. According to Tannen, some features of conversational style are topic (which includes type of topics and how transitions occur), genre (storytelling style), pace (which includes rate of speech, occurrence or lack of pauses, and overlap), and expressive paralinguistics (pitch/amplitude shifts and other changes in voice quality).

===&quot;High-involvement&quot; vs. &quot;high-considerateness&quot;===
Based on a two-and-a-half hour recording of Thanksgiving dinner conversations with friends, Tannen analyzed the two prevailing conversational styles among the six participants, which she divided evenly between the categories of New Yorker and non-New Yorker. Upon analyzing the recording, Tannen came to the conclusion that the speech of the New Yorkers was characterized by exaggerated intonations (paralinguistics), overlapping speech between two or more speakers, short silences, and machine-gun questions, which she defines as questions that are &quot;uttered quickly, timed to overlap or latch onto another&#x27;s talk, and characterized by reduced syntactic form&quot;. The style of the non-New Yorkers was opposite that of the New Yorkers in all regards mentioned above; furthermore, the non-New Yorkers were caught off-guard by the New Yorkers&#x27; exaggerated intonation and interrupting questions, two factors that discouraged them from finishing their conversations at some points. Tannen refers to the New Yorkers&#x27; style as &quot;high-involvement&quot; and the unimposing style of the non-New Yorkers as &quot;high-considerateness&quot;.

===Indirectness in work situations===
Tannen has expressed her stance against taking indirect speech as a sign of weakness or as a lack of confidence; she also set out to debunk the idea that American women are generally more indirect than men. She reached this conclusion by looking through transcripts of conversations and interviews, as well as through correspondence with her readers. One example she uses against the second idea comes from a letter from a reader, who mentioned how his Navy superior trained his unit to respond to the indirect request &quot;It&#x27;s hot in this room&quot; as a direct request to open the window. A different letter mentions the tendency of men to be more indirect when it comes to expressing feelings than women.

Tannen also mentions exchanges where both participants are male, but the two participants are not of equal social status. As a specific example, she mentions a &quot;black box&quot; recording between a plane captain and a co-pilot in which the captain&#x27;s failure to understand the co-pilot&#x27;s indirect conversational style (which was likely a result of his relatively inferior rank) caused a crash.

===Indirectness as a sociocultural norm===
During a trip to Greece, Tannen observed that comments she had made to her hosts about foods she had not seen yet in Greece (specifically, scrambled eggs and grapes) had been interpreted as indirect requests for the foods. This was surprising to her, since she had just made the comments in the spirit of small talk. Tannen observed this same tendency of Greeks and Greek-Americans to interpret statements indirectly in a study that involved interpreting the following conversation between a husband and a wife:

The participants – some Greeks, some Greek-Americans, and some non-Greek Americans – had to choose between the following two paraphrases of the second line in the exchange:

Tannen&#x27;s findings showed that 48% of Greeks chose the first (more indirect) paraphrase, while only 32% of non-Greek Americans chose the same one, with the Greek-Americans scoring closer to the Greeks than the other Americans at 43%. These percentages, combined with other elements of the study, suggest that the degree of indirectness a listener generally expects may be affected through sociocultural norms.

Tannen provides an overview to how culture and power may subconsciously influence a speaker&#x27;s preference for indirectness in her 1994 &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; article &quot;How to Give Orders Like a Man.&quot;

===Agonism in written academic discourse===
Tannen analyzed the agonistic framing of academic texts, which are characterized by their &quot;ritualized adversativeness&quot;. She argued that expectations for academic papers in the US place the highest importance on presenting the weaknesses of an existing, opposing, argument as a basis for bolstering the author&#x27;s replacement argument. According to her, agonism limits the depth of arguments and learning, since authors who follow the convention pass up opportunities to acknowledge strengths in the texts they are arguing against; in addition, this places the newest, attention-grabbing works in prime positions to be torn apart.

<text>Eddie &quot;Cleanhead&quot; Vinson (born Edward L. Vinson Jr.; December 18, 1917 – July 2, 1988) was an American jump blues, jazz, bebop and R&amp;B alto saxophonist and blues shouter. He was nicknamed &quot;Cleanhead&quot; after an incident in which his hair was accidentally removed by lye contained in a hair-straightening product, necessitating shaving it off; enamoured of the look, Vinson maintained a shaved head thereafter. Music critic Robert Christgau has called Vinson &quot;one of the cleanest, and nastiest, blues voices you&#x27;ll ever hear.&quot;

==Biography==
Vinson was born in Houston, Texas. He started out with Milton Larkin&#x27;s orchestra in the 1930s. At various times, he was with Tom Archia, while other members of the band included Cedric Haywood and Wild Bill Davis. He then played for Big Bill Broonzy. During the 1940s, he was with the Cootie Williams Orchestra. He recorded such tunes as &quot;Cherry Red&quot;.

There is some controversy over who composed &quot;Four&quot;.

He died aged 70 in 1988, from a heart attack while undergoing chemotherapy, in Los Angeles, California.

<text>In mathematical analysis, the maximum and minimum of a function are, respectively, the greatest and least value taken by the function. Known generically as extremum, they may be defined either within a given range (the &quot;local&quot; or &quot;relative&quot; extrema) or on the entire domain (the &quot;global&quot; or &quot;absolute&quot; extrema) of a function. Pierre de Fermat was one of the first mathematicians to propose a general technique, adequality, for finding the maxima and minima of functions.

As defined in set theory, the maximum and minimum of a set are the greatest and least elements in the set, respectively. Unbounded infinite sets, such as the set of real numbers, have no minimum or maximum.

In statistics, the corresponding concept is the sample maximum and minimum.

==Definition==
A real-valued function &quot;f&quot; defined on a domain &quot;X&quot; has a global (or absolute) maximum point at &quot;x&quot;∗, if for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. Similarly, the function has a global (or absolute) minimum point at &quot;x&quot;∗, if for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. The value of the function at a maximum point is called the &#x27; of the function, denoted formula_1, and the value of the function at a minimum point is called the &#x27; of the function, (denoted formula_2 for clarity). Symbolically, this can be written as follows:
:formula_3 is a global maximum point of function formula_4 if formula_5
The definition of global minimum point also proceeds similarly.

If the domain &quot;X&quot; is a metric space, then &quot;f&quot; is said to have a local (or relative) maximum point at the point &quot;x&quot;∗, if there exists some &quot;ε&quot; &gt; 0 such that for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; within distance &quot;ε&quot; of &quot;x&quot;∗. Similarly, the function has a local minimum point at &quot;x&quot;∗, if &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;∗) ≤ &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; within distance &quot;ε&quot; of &quot;x&quot;∗. A similar definition can be used when &quot;X&quot; is a topological space, since the definition just given can be rephrased in terms of neighbourhoods. Mathematically, the given definition is written as follows:
:Let formula_6 be a metric space and function formula_7. Then formula_3 is a local maximum point of function formula_9 if formula_10 such that formula_11

The definition of local minimum point can also proceed similarly.

In both the global and local cases, the concept of a &#x27; can be defined. For example, &quot;x&quot;∗ is a &#x27; if for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; with , we have , and &quot;x&quot;∗ is a if there exists some such that, for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; within distance &quot;ε&quot; of &quot;x&quot;∗ with , we have . Note that a point is a strict global maximum point if and only if it is the unique global maximum point, and similarly for minimum points.

A continuous real-valued function with a compact domain always has a maximum point and a minimum point. An important example is a function whose domain is a closed and bounded interval of real numbers (see the graph above).

==Search==
Finding global maxima and minima is the goal of mathematical optimization. If a function is continuous on a closed interval, then by the extreme value theorem, global maxima and minima exist. Furthermore, a global maximum (or minimum) either must be a local maximum (or minimum) in the interior of the domain, or must lie on the boundary of the domain. So a method of finding a global maximum (or minimum) is to look at all the local maxima (or minima) in the interior, and also look at the maxima (or minima) of the points on the boundary, and take the greatest (or least) one.Minima

For differentiable functions, Fermat&#x27;s theorem states that local extrema in the interior of a domain must occur at critical points (or points where the derivative equals zero). However, not all critical points are extrema. One can often distinguish whether a critical point is a local maximum, a local minimum, or neither by using the first derivative test, second derivative test, or higher-order derivative test, given sufficient differentiability.

For any function that is defined piecewise, one finds a maximum (or minimum) by finding the maximum (or minimum) of each piece separately, and then seeing which one is greatest (or least).

==Examples==

For a practical example, assume a situation where someone has formula_12 feet of fencing and is trying to maximize the square footage of a rectangular enclosure, where formula_13 is the length, formula_14 is the width, and formula_15 is the area:

:formula_16
:formula_17
:formula_18
:formula_19
:formula_20

The derivative with respect to formula_13 is:
:formula_22
Setting this equal to formula_23
:formula_24
:formula_25
:formula_26
reveals that formula_26 is our only critical point.
Now retrieve the endpoints by determining the interval to which formula_13 is restricted. Since width is positive, then formula_29, and since that implies that 
Plug in critical point as well as endpoints formula_23 and into and the results are formula_31 and formula_23 respectively.

Therefore, the greatest area attainable with a rectangle of formula_12 feet of fencing is 

==Functions of more than one variable==

For functions of more than one variable, similar conditions apply. For example, in the (enlargeable) figure on the right, the necessary conditions for a &quot;local&quot; maximum are similar to those of a function with only one variable. The first partial derivatives as to &quot;z&quot; (the variable to be maximized) are zero at the maximum (the glowing dot on top in the figure). The second partial derivatives are negative. These are only necessary, not sufficient, conditions for a local maximum, because of the possibility of a saddle point. For use of these conditions to solve for a maximum, the function &quot;z&quot; must also be differentiable throughout. The second partial derivative test can help classify the point as a relative maximum or relative minimum.
In contrast, there are substantial differences between functions of one variable and functions of more than one variable in the identification of global extrema. For example, if a bounded differentiable function &quot;f&quot; defined on a closed interval in the real line has a single critical point, which is a local minimum, then it is also a global minimum (use the intermediate value theorem and Rolle&#x27;s theorem to prove this by contradiction). In two and more dimensions, this argument fails. This is illustrated by the function
:formula_34
whose only critical point is at (0,0), which is a local minimum with &quot;f&quot;(0,0) = 0. However, it cannot be a global one, because &quot;f&quot;(2,3) = −5.

==Maxima or minima of a functional==
If the domain of a function for which an extremum is to be found consists itself of functions (i.e. if an extremum is to be found of a functional), then the extremum is found using the calculus of variations.

==In relation to sets==
Maxima and minima can also be defined for sets. In general, if an ordered set &quot;S&quot; has a greatest element &quot;m&quot;, then &quot;m&quot; is a maximal element of the set, also denoted as formula_35. Furthermore, if &quot;S&quot; is a subset of an ordered set &quot;T&quot; and &quot;m&quot; is the greatest element of &quot;S&quot; with (respect to order induced by &quot;T&quot;), then &quot;m&quot; is a least upper bound of &quot;S&quot; in &quot;T&quot;. Similar results hold for least element, minimal element and greatest lower bound. The maximum and minimum function for sets are used in databases, and can be computed rapidly, since the maximum (or minimum) of a set can be computed from the maxima of a partition; formally, they are self-decomposable aggregation functions.

In the case of a general partial order, a least element (i.e., one that is less than all others) should not be confused with the minimal element (nothing is lesser). Likewise, a greatest element of a partially ordered set (poset) is an upper bound of the set which is contained within the set, whereas the maximal element &quot;m&quot; of a poset &quot;A&quot; is an element of &quot;A&quot; such that if &quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; (for any &quot;b&quot; in &quot;A&quot;), then &quot;m&quot; = &quot;b&quot;. Any least element or greatest element of a poset is unique, but a poset can have several minimal or maximal elements. If a poset has more than one maximal element, then these elements will not be mutually comparable.

In a totally ordered set, or &quot;chain&quot;, all elements are mutually comparable, so such a set can have at most one minimal element and at most one maximal element. Then, due to mutual comparability, the minimal element will also be the least element, and the maximal element will also be the greatest element. Thus in a totally ordered set, we can simply use the terms minimum and maximum. 

If a chain is finite, then it will always have a maximum and a minimum. If a chain is infinite, then it need not have a maximum or a minimum. For example, the set of natural numbers has no maximum, though it has a minimum. If an infinite chain &quot;S&quot; is bounded, then the closure &quot;Cl&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) of the set occasionally has a minimum and a maximum, in which case they are called the greatest lower bound and the least upper bound of the set &quot;S&quot;, respectively.

<text>The Riblet Tramway Company of Spokane, Washington, which operated from 1908 to 2003, was once the largest ski chairlift manufacturer in the world.

==History==
The company was founded by Byron Christian Riblet, who was born in Osage, Iowa, in 1865 and earned a degree in Civil Engineering. Arriving in Spokane in 1885, his first work was laying out railway and streetcar lines. He also built dams and irrigation projects.

In 1896, Riblet was contracted to erect an ore tramway designed by the Finlayson company at the Noble Five silver mine in Sandon, British Columbia, to assist in moving ore down Reco Mountain to the mill at Cody. Apparently Riblet thought he was coming to build a streetcar line. Even so, Riblet decided he could improve the mining tram performance. Over time, Riblet raised more aerial tramways in the booming mining district, building 30 in the next decade. Riblet returned to Spokane in 1908, after working in the Kootenays, to found the Riblet Tramway Company. The company, which specialized in mining tramways, built them in Alaska, Canada, the western United States, and South America.

Riblet built its first chairlift in 1938 at Mount Hood, Oregon. Byron Riblet died in 1952, but the company boomed with the postwar rise of ski resorts. Skiing gained in popularity, and soon ski lifts became the major part of the Riblet Tramway Company&#x27;s business. They built more than 400 lifts, particularly in Washington, Oregon, and California, and as far away as Australia, New Zealand and Chile; one secondhand American lift has also been relocated to Pakistan. They have the most double chair lifts operating in the U.S.

===1974 World&#x27;s Fair===
During Expo &#x27;74 Riblet built both the skyride a Gondola tramway over Spokane Falls and the A&amp;W SkyFloat a chairlift that went over the fairgrounds.

After the World&#x27;s Fair, the chairlift was dismantled and went to Schweitzer Mountain. The Gondola became one of the attractions at Riverfront Park and was replaced by a new Gondola system in 2005.

===Decline===
The company only built fixed-grip lifts, whose chair grip is woven into the haul rope rather than clamped onto it. But other technologies eventually proved more popular. In early 2003, the firm announced that it was no longer viable and would go out of business.

== Installations ==
Riblet chairlifts can be found in many places still in service, though the majority have been removed. The following tables contain those documented by liftblog.com as of September 5, 2021. More Riblet chairlifts may be in existence, though some listed below may have already been removed. At least 265 existing Riblet chairlifts still exist and 268 are no longer installed.

<doc id="298425" wikidata="Q451312" url="?curid=298425" title="Umberto Saba">
<text>Umberto Saba (9 March 1883 – 25 August 1957) was an Italian poet and novelist, born Umberto Poli in the cosmopolitan Mediterranean port of Trieste when it was the fourth largest city of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Poli assumed the pen name &quot;Saba&quot; in 1910, and his name was officially changed to Umberto Saba in 1928. From 1919 he was the proprietor of an antiquarian bookshop in Trieste. He suffered from depression for all of his adult life.

==Life and career==
Saba&#x27;s Christian father, 29-year-old Ugo Edoardo Poli, converted to Judaism in order to marry 37-year-old Felicita Rachele Cohen in July 1882. Felicita was one month pregnant with Umberto at the time of the wedding. Ugo abandoned his new wife and faith before Umberto was born and the child was raised first by a Slovene Catholic wet-nurse, Gioseffa Gabrovich Schobar (&quot;Peppa&quot;), and her husband, who had just lost a child, and from 1887 onwards by his mother, in her sister Regina&#x27;s home, though Umberto maintained a close lifelong attachment to Peppa. (p. 528) 

Saba was a keen reader who kept pet birds and studied the violin. (pp. xix, 528) In 1897 he transferred from the Gymnasium to a commercial college, the Imperial Academy of Commerce and Navigation, and then went to work in the office of a customs agent.

As a boy and a young man he was of a shy and solitary character, with just a few friends, among whom were his cousin Giorgio Fano and the other great Triestine poet Virgilio Giotti.

In 1900 he began composing poetry, signing his work &quot;Umberto Chopin Poli.&quot; In January 1903 Saba travelled to Pisa to study archaeology, German and Latin, but began to complain of a nervous disorder and, in June, returned to Trieste. After a holiday in Slovenia, he spent some time later that year in Switzerland, writing a play. In July 1904, the socialist newspaper, &quot;Il Lavoratore&quot;, edited by his friend Amadeo Tedeschi, published Saba&#x27;s account of a visit to Montenegro earlier in the year, and in May 1905, &quot;Il Lavoratore&quot; printed his first published poem. In 1905 he travelled to Florence with friends and – upon meeting his father for the first time – changed his pen name to &quot;Umberto da Montereale,&quot; after the town of his father&#x27;s birth. That summer he met Carolina (Lina) Wölfler, and began corresponding with her the following December. Between 1907 and 1908 he completed an obligatory year of Italian military service in an infantry unit based in Salerno. He married Lina in a Jewish ceremony in 1909, and they had a daughter, Linuccia, the following year. (p. xix)

In November 1910 his first collection of poems, &quot;Poesie&quot;, was published under the name Saba, and the name was legally recognised as his surname in 1928. (p. xix). This choice of name (which may be based on one of two Hebrew words – &quot;sova&quot; (שובע) meaning &quot;being well-fed&quot; or &quot;saba&quot; (סבא) meaning &quot;grandfather&quot;) is thought by some scholars to be a homage to his Jewish mother, while others point to the similarity with his wet nurse&#x27;s surname, Schobar.

In the spring of 1911, while Saba was away in Florence meeting people associated with the influential magazine &quot;La Voce&quot;, and initiating a collaboration with Mario Novaro, Lina had an affair with a painter. The couple separated, but were together again by May 1912 when the family moved to Bologna, where public readings of his poetry were poorly received and Saba was beset by depressed lows and creative highs. Destitute, in 1914 the family moved to Milan, where Saba found work first as a secretary, then as a nightclub manager. In early 1915 he began writing for Benito Mussolini&#x27;s &quot;Il Popolo d&#x27;Italia&quot; newspaper, but in June was drafted into the army, where he saw no active service and was hospitalised due to depression. (pp. 544–5)

In 1919, he returned to Trieste and purchased the &quot;Mailänder&quot; second-hand bookshop, which he renamed &quot;La Libreria Antica e Moderna.&quot; The business produced enough income to support the family, and Saba soon became enthusiastic about buying and selling rare old books and enjoyed the extensive travel involved. After both returned to Trieste in 1919, Saba started meeting on a daily basis and collaborating artistically with Giotti, who designed for him the logo of the &quot;Libreria Antica e Moderna&quot;, edited and illustrated the &quot;plaquette&quot; for Saba&#x27;s &quot;Cose leggere e vaganti&quot; and of ten small books. Saba on the other hand published &quot;Il mio cuore e la mia casa&quot; at his library. After the death of Giotti&#x27;s sister in 1929, his friendship with Saba deteriorated in the 1930s, up to the point when the two even avoided meeting.

He self-published the first edition of his &quot;Songbook&quot; in 1921 (successive, enlarged editions followed, and eventually it grew to contain over four hundred poems, spanning fifty years). (p. 544–5) In 1929 he began psychoanalysis under the influential Trieste psychoanalyst Edoardo Weiss, a student of Freud. (p. xxi)

In 1939 Saba sought exemption from the newly proclaimed anti-Jewish laws, but was unwilling to be baptised into the Catholic faith, so the following year he sold the bookshop to his long-time assistant and friend, Carlo Cerne. Upon the announcement of the armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces in 1943, Saba fled Trieste with his family to Florence, where they moved to eleven different hiding places over the following 12 months, to avoid deportation; after which Lina returned to Trieste and Saba moved to Rome, where he oversaw the publication of &quot;Scorciatoie e raccontini,&quot; a collection of his aphorisms. In 1946 Saba was awarded the Viareggio Prize and returned to Trieste where, in the following year, he sparked a vitriolic debate over the future of the city with his article &quot;If I were named governor of Trieste&quot;.

After being prescribed injectable opium for his depression, from 1950 onwards Saba was frequently admitted to a Rome nursing home for treatment of addiction. At the age of 70, in 1953, the University of Rome bestowed upon him an honorary doctorate, and he received an award from the Lincean Academy. He died at the age of 74 in Gorizia, nine months after a heart attack, and a year after the death of his wife.

==Influence of Jewish background==

The 1948 prose essay &quot;Storia e cronistoria del Canzoniere&quot; (&quot;History and chronology of song-writing&quot;) shows autobiographical elements. &quot;Gli Ebrei&quot; (The Jews) which is part of his 1956 &quot;Ricordi-Racconti 1910–1947&quot; (&quot;Records and Stories 1910–1947&quot;) describes the life of the Trieste Jewish Community of his childhood. The 1952 &quot;Vignette di vita giudaica&quot; (&quot;Vignettes of Jewish life&quot;) includes a description of Samuel David Luzzatto, his mother&#x27;s uncle on her own mother&#x27;s side. His works indicate his knowledge of both Hebrew and the Trieste Jewish dialect.

<doc id="298428" wikidata="Q609647" url="?curid=298428" title="Identity (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, an identity is an equality relating one mathematical expression &quot;A&quot; to another mathematical expression &quot;B&quot;, such that &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; (which might contain some variables) produce the same value for all values of the variables within a certain domain of discourse. In other words, &quot;A&quot; = &quot;B&quot; is an identity if &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; define the same functions, and an identity is an equality between functions that are differently defined. For example, formula_1 and formula_2 are identities. Identities are sometimes indicated by the triple bar symbol instead of , the equals sign. Formally, an identity is a universally quantified equality.

== Common identities ==

=== Algebraic identities ===

Certain identities, such as formula_3 and formula_4, form the basis of algebra, while other identities, such as formula_5 and formula_6, can be useful in simplifying algebraic expressions and expanding them.

=== Trigonometric identities ===
Geometrically, trigonometric identities are identities involving certain functions of one or more angles. They are distinct from triangle identities, which are identities involving both angles and side lengths of a triangle. Only the former are covered in this article.

These identities are useful whenever expressions involving trigonometric functions need to be simplified. Another important application is the integration of non-trigonometric functions: a common technique which involves first using the substitution rule with a trigonometric function, and then simplifying the resulting integral with a trigonometric identity.

One of the most prominent examples of trigonometric identities involves the equation formula_7 which is true for all real values of formula_8. On the other hand, the equation
:formula_9

is only true for certain values of formula_8, not all. For example, this equation is true when formula_11 but false when formula_12.

Another group of trigonometric identities concerns the so-called addition/subtraction formulas (e.g. the double-angle identity formula_13, the addition formula for formula_14), which can be used to break down expressions of larger angles into those with smaller constituents.

=== Exponential identities ===
The following identities hold for all integer exponents, provided that the base is non-zero:
:formula_15

Unlike addition and multiplication, exponentiation is not commutative. For example, and , but whereas .

Also unlike addition and multiplication, exponentiation is not associative either. For example, and , but 23 to the 4 is 84 (or 4,096) whereas 2 to the 34 is 281 (or 2,417,851,639,229,258,349,412,352). When no parentheses are written, by convention the order is top-down, not bottom-up:
:formula_16   whereas   formula_17

=== Logarithmic identities ===

Several important formulas, sometimes called &quot;logarithmic identities&quot; or &quot;log laws&quot;, relate logarithms to one another:

==== Product, quotient, power and root ====
The logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the numbers being multiplied; the logarithm of the ratio of two numbers is the difference of the logarithms. The logarithm of the th power of a number is times the logarithm of the number itself; the logarithm of a th root is the logarithm of the number divided by . The following table lists these identities with examples. Each of the identities can be derived after substitution of the logarithm definitions formula_18 and/or formula_19 in the left hand sides.

==== Change of base ====
The logarithm log&quot;b&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) can be computed from the logarithms of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;b&quot; with respect to an arbitrary base &quot;k&quot; using the following formula:
: formula_20
Typical scientific calculators calculate the logarithms to bases 10 and &quot;e&quot;. Logarithms with respect to any base &quot;b&quot; can be determined using either of these two logarithms by the previous formula:
:formula_21
Given a number &quot;x&quot; and its logarithm log&quot;b&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) to an unknown base &quot;b&quot;, the base is given by:
: formula_22

=== Hyperbolic function identities ===

The hyperbolic functions satisfy many identities, all of them similar in form to the trigonometric identities. In fact, Osborn&#x27;s rule states that one can convert any trigonometric identity into a hyperbolic identity by expanding it completely in terms of integer powers of sines and cosines, changing sine to sinh and cosine to cosh, and switching the sign of every term which contains a product of an even number of hyperbolic sines.

The Gudermannian function gives a direct relationship between the trigonometric functions and the hyperbolic ones that does not involve complex numbers.

== Logic and universal algebra ==
Formally, an identity is a true universally quantified formula of the form formula_23 where and are terms with no other free variables than formula_24 The quantifier prefix formula_25 is often left implicit, when it is stated that the formula is an identity. For example, the axioms of a monoid are often given as the formulas
:formula_26
or, shortly,
:formula_27

So, these formulas are identities in every monoid. As for any equality, the formulas without quantifier are often called equations. In other words, an identity is an equation that is true for all values of the variables.

<doc id="298440" wikidata="Q304083" url="?curid=298440" title="Leonid Stein">
<text>Leonid Zakharovych Stein (; November 12, 1934 – July 4, 1973) was a Soviet chess Grandmaster from Ukraine. He won three USSR Chess Championships in the 1960s (1963, 1965, and 1966), and was among the world&#x27;s top ten players during that era.

== Early life ==

Leonid Stein was born in Kamenets-Podolsky. He was a Jewish Ukrainian who served in the Soviet Army.

In both 1955 and 1956, he tied for first place in the individual Army Championship. He achieved the national Master title for chess at the relatively late age of 24, but, as his Army titles against strong competition attest, he was likely at that strength somewhat earlier. At 24, he competed for the first time in the USSR Chess Championship at Tbilisi, 1959. In the following year he won the Ukrainian Championship at Kyiv, winning it again in 1962. He played board one for the Soviet team at the Helsinki 1961 Student Olympiad, scoring a strong +8, =3, −1, and helping his team to the overall gold medals.

== Grandmaster and Soviet Champion ==

Stein tied for third place in the 1961 Soviet Championship, at Moscow, defeating Tigran Petrosian on the way. He won his first Soviet title at Leningrad 1963; he tied with Boris Spassky and Ratmir Kholmov in the tournament itself, then won the playoff. He won again at Tallinn, 1965, and repeated the next year, 1966, at Tbilisi. Two outstanding international tournament victories were attained at Moscow 1967 (commemorating the 50th anniversary of the 1917 October Revolution), and Moscow 1971 (Alekhine Memorial, equal with Anatoly Karpov). Both of the Moscow tournaments were considered to be among the strongest tournaments in chess history up to that time. Further international tournament victories were scored at Sarajevo (Bosna) 1967, equal with Borislav Ivkov, Hastings 1967–68, shared, Kecskemét 1968, Tallinn 1969, Pärnu 1971, and Las Palmas 1973, equal with Tigran Petrosian. From 1963 to his premature death in 1973, Stein was in the top ten players in the world, or just outside that range.

== World title challenge frustrations ==

With his strong result at the 1961 Soviet Championship, he earned the right to play in the 1962 Stockholm Interzonal tournament. His play there was excellent, finishing in a tie for 6th–7th places, but he was denied the right to advance to the Candidates&#x27; Tournament, because of a FIDE rule then in force which limited the qualifiers from any one country to three (in this case USSR). He had finished behind fellow Soviets Efim Geller, Petrosian, and Viktor Korchnoi. Despite winning a 3-way playoff against Pal Benko and Svetozar Gligorić for the 6th and final spot, due to the aforementioned Soviets finishing ahead of him, Stein was denied the final spot and Benko was awarded it instead.

A very similar occurrence was the story of the next Interzonal tournament, in Amsterdam 1964. Stein took fifth place, sufficient for qualification for any non-Soviet player, with an outstanding total of 16½ / 23, but was blocked from advancement. He had finished behind fellow Soviets Mikhail Tal, Vasily Smyslov, and Boris Spassky, who, along with Danish GM Bent Larsen, had all scored 17 points. He did represent the USSR at the Tel Aviv Olympiad that year, scoring a fine 10/13, and winning an individual gold medal on the first reserve board. Again, he was in the Soviet side at the Havana Olympiad 1966, scoring 9/12, winning an individual silver medal on board four. Both times, the Soviet Union won the team gold medals.

Again, in 1967, Stein qualified for the Sousse Interzonal, scored well, in a tie for 6th–8th places, but had to undergo a further playoff with Samuel Reshevsky and Vlastimil Hort, in Los Angeles, which was won by Reshevsky.

He was on the Soviet side for the European team championships at Hamburg 1965 and Kapfenberg 1970, both of which were victorious. He served as an alternate on the Soviet team for the Match of the Century against the Rest of the World team, at Belgrade 1970. He played one game, losing to Larsen.

Stein had already qualified for the 1973 Petropolis Interzonal, and was considered a potential favorite to win the entire Candidates&#x27; cycle

== Death == 
He died of a heart attack at the age of 38 at the Rossiya Hotel in Moscow as he prepared to leave for the European chess championships in Bath, England. At the time of death, he was still considered as one of the main contenders for World Championship. He was buried in Kyiv, in his native Ukraine. His widow and children currently live in US.

== Style and legacy ==

Stein&#x27;s creative style was greatly influenced by Chigorin and Alekhine. He was a highly intuitive, natural player. He was considered to be a brilliant attacking genius, but nevertheless played very sound chess, being less willing than Tal to complicate with unforeseeable results. He excelled in sharp openings such as the King&#x27;s Indian systems with both colors, the Grünfeld Defence, and the Sicilian Defence.

He was one of few players who had an even score against Vasily Smyslov, Tigran Petrosian, and Mikhail Botvinnik. He had plus records against Mikhail Tal, Boris Spassky, and Paul Keres. Stein defeated many of the top players of his era.

== Notable games ==
* Nikolay Krogius vs Leonid Stein, Ukrainian Championship, Kyiv 1960, King&#x27;s Indian Defence, Petrosian Variation (E92), 0–1 Stein was a terror in the King&#x27;s Indian, and shows it here.
* Leonid Stein vs Tigran Petrosian, USSR Championship, Moscow 1961, French Defence, Winawer Variation (C18), 1–0 Stein takes off the world champion-to-be in devastating fashion.
* Leonid Stein vs Mikhail Tal, USSR Club Championship Team finals, Moscow 1961, Sicilian Defence, Najdorf Variation (B94), 1–0 Former world champion Tal has to concede defeat in an ultra-sharp game.
* Leonid Stein vs Lajos Portisch, Stockholm Interzonal 1962, Sicilian Defence, Kan Variation (B42), 1–0 Stein unleashes a nasty knight sacrifice to tear open Black&#x27;s king position.
* Boris Spassky vs Leonid Stein, USSR Championship, Leningrad 1964, Grunfeld Defence (D86), 0–1 Another world champion-to-be meets his match in Leonid Stein.
* Mikhail Botvinnik vs Leonid Stein, Moscow 1965, Ruy Lopez, Delayed Exchange Variation (C85), 0–1 Yet another former world champion may have wished he had stayed home.
* Leonid Stein vs Pal Benko, Caracas 1970, Sicilian Defence, Lasker Variation (B33), 1–0 Black&#x27;s opening play was daring and was refuted in precise fashion.
* Leonid Stein vs Vasily Smyslov, Moscow 1972, English Opening (A17), 1–0 Smyslov, a master of quiet positional play, has few answers for Stein&#x27;s tactics.
* Ljubomir Ljubojevic vs Leonid Stein, Las Palmas 1973, Nimzo-Larsen Opening (A01), 0–1 Two skilled tacticians go toe-to-toe, and Stein comes out on top, after slipping in a surprise knight sacrifice in the opening.

<doc id="298443" wikidata="Q334511" url="?curid=298443" title="Rennell Rodd, 1st Baron Rennell">
<text>James Rennell Rodd, 1st Baron Rennell, (9 November 1858 – 26 July 1941), known as Sir Rennell Rodd before 1933, was a British diplomat, poet and politician. He served as British Ambassador to Italy during the First World War.

==Early life==
Rodd was born in London on 9 November 1858. He was the only son of Cornishman Major James Rennell Rodd (1812–1892) of the Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry, and his wife Elizabeth Anne Thomson, the third daughter of Dr. Anthony Todd Thomson. His paternal grandparents were Admiral Sir John Tremayne Rodd and the former Jane Rennell, a daughter of the geographer James Rennell.

Rodd was educated at Haileybury and Balliol College, Oxford, where he was associated with the circle of Oscar Wilde. In 1880, he won the Newdigate prize for &quot;Raleigh&quot;. Wilde later assisted Rodd in securing publication for his first book of verse, &quot;Rose Leaf and Apple Leaf&quot;, for which Wilde provided an introduction. As Wilde began to court scandal in his public career, their friendship cooled. Following Wilde&#x27;s trial, Rodd strongly dissociated himself from him, particularly as his own work had contained a number of gently homoerotic verses, such as: &quot;his eyes would gaze from his soul at mine/My eyes that would answer without one sign/And that were enough for love.&quot;

== Career ==
Rodd entered the British Diplomatic Service in 1883, and served in minor positions at embassies in Berlin, Rome, Athens and Paris. From 1894 to 1902, Rodd worked under the Consul-General of Egypt, Lord Cromer. He played an important part in negotiating the Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1897 with Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia. In late 1901, he was appointed first secretary at the embassy in Rome, where he arrived in 1902, and remained for the next two years.

In 1904, Rodd was made minister plenipotentiary to Sweden—and until November 1905, Norway—but did not arrive until 17 January 1905. He played an active and neutral part in the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden, for which he was rewarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the Polar Star by King Oscar II. After the secession, he continued as a minister in Sweden until 1908.

In 1908 he was appointed ambassador to Italy. He remained in this post until 1919, and played a key role in securing Italy&#x27;s adhesion to the Triple Entente. Rodd left the Diplomatic Service in 1919, but nonetheless served on the mission to Egypt in 1920, with The Viscount Milner. Rodd was the British delegate to the League of Nations from 1921 to 1923. He also sat as Unionist Member of Parliament for the constituency of St Marylebone between 1928 and 1932.

===Writing career and scholar===
Apart from his diplomatic services Rodd was also a published poet and scholar of ancient Greece and Rome. In 1920 he delivered the British Academy&#x27;s Italian Lecture, and in 1928 he visited America where he delivered a lecture on modern Greek folklore to an enraptured H. P. Lovecraft. Earlier in 1927 he met travel writer Richard Halliburton at a party and the two &quot;clicked at once&quot; as Halliburton recounted his time in Greece, including his following in the footsteps of Odysseus and Alexander the Great, deeds which appeared in his recent &quot;The Glorious Adventure&quot;. He published his memoirs, entitled &quot;Social and Diplomatic Memories&quot;, in three volumes between 1922 and 1925. His diaries were published in 1981 by Torsten Burgman, and edited by Victor Lal in 2005.

===Honours===
Rodd was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1897, Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1899, Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) in 1905, Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in 1915, and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in the 1920 New Year Honours. He was appointed to the Privy Council in 1908 and in 1933 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Rennell, of Rodd in the County of Hereford.

==Personal life==

On 27 October 1894, Rennell Rodd was married to Lilias Georgina Guthrie (1864–1951) at St George&#x27;s Hanover Square Church. She was the fourth daughter of James Alexander Guthrie, 4th Baron of Craigie, and the former Elinor Stirling (a daughter of Adm. Sir James Stirling, Governor of Western Australia from 1834 to 1838). Lilias&#x27; sister, Rose Ellinor Guthrie, was the wife of Maj.-Gen. The Hon. Sir Cecil Edward Bingham (a younger son of Charles Bingham, 4th Earl of Lucan). They had four sons and two daughters, including:

* Francis James Rennell Rodd, 2nd Baron Rennell (1895–1978), who married the Hon. Mary Constance Vivian Smith, daughter of Vivian Smith, 1st Baron Bicester.

<text>Our Lady of La Salette () is a Marian apparition reported by two French children, Maximin Giraud and Mélanie Calvat, to have occurred at La Salette-Fallavaux, France, in 1846.

On 19 September 1851, the local bishop formally approved the public devotion and prayers to Our Lady of La Salette. On 21 August 1879, Pope Leo XIII granted a canonical coronation to the image now located within the Basilica of Our Lady of La Salette. A Russian-style tiara was granted to the image, instead of the solar-type tiara used in the traditional depictions of Our Lady during her apparitions.

Places dedicated to Our Lady of La Salette outside of France include a sanctuary in Oliveira de Azeméis, Portugal; a chapel in San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato, Mexico; a shrine in Kodaikanal, Tamilnadu, India; as well as a national shrine in Attleboro, Massachusetts, and a shrine in Enfield, New Hampshire, in the United States, known for their displays of Christmas lights.

== Background ==

In 1846, the village of La Salette consisted of eight or nine scattered hamlets. The population was about 800, principally small farmers with their families and dependents.

== The apparition ==
On Saturday 19 September 1846, around 3 p.m., two young shepherds, Mélanie Calvat (or Mélanie Mathieu), aged just under 15, and Maximin Giraud (sometimes called Mémin, and, by mistake, Germain), 11 years old, guarded their herds on a mountain near the village of La Salette-Fallavaux (department of Isère). On the evening, they said to their masters that they had seen a lady in tears who had spoken to them. Widow Pra (also known as widow Caron), mistress of Mélanie, thought that they had seen the Blessed Virgin and the children were urged to tell the priest of La Salette everything. They did it the next day, Sunday morning. The priest wept with emotion, took notes and, again in tears, described what had been told to him, in his sermon.

== The Pra report ==
On Sunday evening, in the presence of Mélanie but in the absence of Maximin, whom his master had taken back to his family in Corps, Baptiste Pra (Mélanie&#x27;s master), Pierre Selme (Maximin&#x27;s master) and a certain Jean Moussier collaborated to put in writing the words addressed by the Virgin to the children. The resulting document, which is called the &quot;Pra report&quot;, is now only known from a copy made by an investigator, Abbé Lagier, in February 1847. Nevertheless, this copy agrees with earlier documents which surely derive from the original Pra report.

Lagier&#x27;s copy reads as follows:
According to later reports, the words &quot;I will tell you otherwise&quot; mean that the Virgin, who had first spoken in French, began to speak in the patois of Corps. From 12 October 1846 the documents mention that during the apparition, the lady confided a personal secret to each of the two children.

For Father Stern, the Pra report is of prime importance among the documents on the apparition.

== Process of harmonization between the testimonies of the two children ==

The Pra report was written in the presence of Mélanie and in the absence of Maximin. Father Stern, however, considers it possible that the writers of the report added to Mélanie&#x27;s statements things that had been said by Maximin.

Each of the two seers had, in the first weeks, a part of the lady&#x27;s message of which they were more sure than the other seer. The parish priest of La Salette noted on 16 October 1846: &quot;All this story&quot; (that is to say, essentially, what concerns the complaints, threats and promises of the Virgin) &quot;is faithfully given by little Mélanie and although little Germain could not in principle give it with the same order, he always said, however, when hearing his little companion tell it, that it was indeed that. What follows&quot; (that is to say, essentially, the account of the Coin incident, which features Maximin and his father) &quot;was more particularly understood and remembered by little Germain, Mélanie admitting that it is certain that the lady spoke to the little boy without Mélanie being able to understand the lady.&quot;

However, in the words of Father Stern, a &quot;process of harmonization&quot; between the statements of the two children resulted in the fixation of the &quot;Salettine vulgate&quot;: &quot;The way he (Maximin) presents the words of the Lady[...] in February–March 1847 certainly owes something to the stories he heard from Mélanie in the meantime. But an influence in the opposite direction, from Maximin to Mélanie, must also have existed.&quot;

== Episcopal inquiries ==

The story of Mélanie and Maximin was very well received by the population and, at least from November 1846, the bishop of Grenoble, Philibert de Bruillard, was convinced of the reality of the apparition, but, wishing to be able to support his judgment on indisputable evidence, he requested several reports from various commissions.

== The Ars incident ==

In September 1850, Maximin, who was advised by some to become a Marist, wanted to consult the Curé of Ars about his vocation. Brayer, benefactor of the two seers, and Verrier, one of the partisans of the &quot;Baron de Richemont&quot; who hoped that the secret of La Salette related to the destinies of this alleged Louis XVII, undertook to take Maximin to the famous priest. Maximin&#x27;s guardian officially gave his consent, but the bishop of Grenoble opposed the trip. Maximin, stamping with vexation, refused to submit to this prohibition. Brayer and Verrier disregarded the will of the bishop and took Maximin to Ars accompanied by his sister Angélique, who was an adult.

The group arrived in Ars on 24 September in the evening. They were received by the Abbé Raymond, vicar of Ars, who expressed to Maximin a total incredulity with regard to the apparition of La Salette. The next morning, Maximin had a one-on-one interview with the Curé of Ars. After this interview, the priest, who until then had great confidence in the apparition of La Salette, declared to several people, in particular to ecclesiastics, that Maximin retracted his testimony. One of these ecclesiastics informed the episcopal commission in charge of investigating the apparition and Abbé Gerin, a member of the commission, came at the end of October to hear the Curé of Ars.

Maximin was questioned about the Ars incident at the minor seminary of Grenoble and at the bishopric. On 2 November, he attested in writing, at the minor seminary, that the Curé of Ars had not questioned him either about the apparition of La Salette or about his secret and that, for his part, in his answers to the parish priest and the vicar of Ars, he said nothing that was contrary to what he had said to thousands of others since the apparition. The same day, he declared before a special commission meeting at the bishopric that he had not retracted his testimony in Ars, but that, not hearing the priest distinctly, he sometimes said &#x27;yes&#x27; and &#x27;no&#x27; at random. &quot;This is at least how Rousselot presents his explanations&quot;, adds Father Stern. (Canon Rousselot considered himself the postulator of the cause of La Salette.) On 8 November, Father Mélin, parish priest of Corps, and Canon Rousselot went to Ars. The Curé of Ars told them that Maximin confessed to him &quot;that he had seen nothing and had lied when making his known story and had persisted in this lie for three years as he saw the good effects of it&quot;. On 21 November, Maximin wrote (&quot;one made him write&quot;, says Father Stern) a letter to the Curé of Ars in which he gave the following explanation: &quot;Allow me to tell you in all sincerity, that there has been a complete misunderstanding on your part. I did not want to tell you, Father, and I never said seriously to anyone, that I had seen nothing and had lied by making my known story and had persisted in this lie for three years, as I saw the good effects of it. I only told you, Father, when I left the sacristy and on the door, that I saw something and that I didn&#x27;t know if it was the Blessed Virgin or another lady. At this moment you were advancing through the crowd and our conversation ceased.&quot; According to Father Stern, the least that can be said of Maximin&#x27;s various explanations is that they lack coherence. (Later, in 1865, Maximin would give yet another explanation: the lie he had confessed to the Curé of Ars did not concern the apparition, but a theft of cherries he had committed in road to Ars. &quot;As if&quot;, remarks Father Stern, &quot;cherries grew in September!&quot;)

Bishop de Bruillard, however, tended to believe in the sincerity of Maximin&#x27;s explanation by the misunderstanding. He supported this explanation in a letter he wrote to the Curé of Ars, as he forwarded to him that of Maximin: &quot;During the recent visit to you by Canon Rousselot and M. Mélin, Pastor-Archpriest of Corps, you told these Gentlemen that Maximin had confessed to you &#x27;that he had seen nothing and had lied in making his known story and had persisted in this lie for three years as he saw the good effects of it&#x27;.[...] Finally, you said to MM. Rousselot and Mélin that as a result of this interview with Maximin, you could no longer believe in the apparition of La Salette as before, and that you no longer believed in it. MM. Mélin and Rousselot told me all these things with a common voice. Now, such a change of opinion on your part, M. le Curé, which is more and more known, (for the very sake of the salvation of souls,) would be a very serious fact if the apparition is real, as believed nine bishops whom I consulted. If you misheard Maximin, as he affirms with all appearances of sincerity, in the judgment of several people who have my confidence, affirmation written in the attached document that the child addresses you very resolutely, you cannot exempt you from examining again, and you will not refuse to inform me of the result of this examination and of the opinion to which it may lead you. You understand, M. le Curé, that having encouraged the belief of the people in the apparition of La Salette, by the approval I gave to the publication of the reports drawn up by my order on this affair, you cannot put yourself in a kind of public opposition with me, without having the kindness to inform me of your reasons, since I have the honor to request them from you insistently.&quot;

In his answer, the Curé of Ars did not adopt the explanation based on the misunderstanding that the Bishop of Grenoble suggested to him. On the question of fact, he stood by his statements to the parish priest of Corps and to Canon Rousselot, but he did not exclude that the apparition could be authentic despite Maximin&#x27;s categorical retraction: &quot;It is not necessary to repeat to Your Highness what I said to these Gentlemen. The boy having told me that he had not seen the Blessed Virgin, I was tired of it for a couple of days. After all, Monseigneur, the wound is not so great, and if this fact is the work of God, man will not destroy it.&quot; This response of the Curé of Ars did not trouble Bishop de Bruillard. For him, it was not possible that the children invented all the circumstances of the apparition, so either there was a misunderstanding between the Curé of Ars and Maximin, or it was not seriously that Maximin said he had seen nothing.

The Curé of Ars continued to maintain that Maximin had in fact retracted his testimoney. Abbé Alfred Monnin, who entered the entourage of the Curé of Ars as a missionary, reported as follows an interview he had with him in the presence of a few people:

This passage from the book of Abbé Alfred Monnin disappeared from some later editions, but there are other testimonies in the same sense.

Father Stern notes that the Curé of Ars had very good hearing and was neither stupid nor stubborn: &quot;If there had been the possibility of a misunderstanding on his part, why would he have had difficulty to admit it, he who asked nothing better than to believe?&quot; Therefore Father Stern adopts, with other authors favorable to the authenticity of the apparition, an explanation different from those that Maximin himself gave in 1850: Maximin would have voluntarily fooled the Curé of Ars. According to one of the partisans of this thesis of a hoax from Maximin, the vicar of Ars had affirmed before Maximin that the priest read consciences and Maximin would have liked to put the priest to the test. Father Stern, for his part, does not consider it necessary to make the vicar of Ars play an important role: Maximin was surrounded by naive people to whom he liked to tell balderdash and when these naive people spoke to him about the extraordinary priest of Ars, he behaved towards him as towards the others.

The Curé of Ars, whom the affair had plunged into desolation, confided to his auxiliary Catherine Lassagne, years after the recognition of the apparition by the bishop of Grenoble, that he was very annoyed not to believe in it. He ended up recovering his faith in La Salette for many reasons, one of which was purely subjective (deliverance from an inner pain) and the other of which (attribution of a miraculous cause to a help arriving during financial difficulties) was of a degree of objectivity that varied according to the witnesses.

== The 1851 episcopal letter and the persistence of the opposition ==

In an episcopal letter which is dated 19 September 1851 (fifth anniversary of the apparition), but which, at the bishopric, is classified among the November texts, Bishop de Bruillard declared the apparition authentic and authorized the cult of Our Lady of La Salette. This act weakened the opposition without making it disappear and its leaders, taking advantage in 1852 of the arrival of a new bishop (Mgr Ginoulhiac, replacing Mgr de Bruillard who had resigned), violently attacked the reality of the miracle of the Salette. Two ecclesiastics, Abbé Deléon and Cartellier, parish priest of the Saint-Joseph church in Grenoble, even claimed that the &quot;beautiful lady&quot; was in fact an old daughter called Mademoiselle de La Merlière, a former nun. This claim gave rise to a curious lawsuit for defamation which the plaintiff (La Merlière) lost twice, at first instance on 2 May 1855 and on appeal on 6 May 1857, despite an eloquent plea by Jules Favre.

Abbé Cartellier and Abbé Deléon continued thereafter to publish pamphlets against the apparition. The cardinal-archbishop of Lyon, Louis Jacques Maurice de Bonald, was favorable to the two polemicists. The Papacy did not commit.

== The basilica and the missionaries ==

The first stone of a large church was solemnly laid on the mountain of La Salette, on 25 May 1852, in front of a large congregation of believers. This church, later promoted to the rank of basilica, was served by religious called missionaries of La Salette, who were replaced in 1891 by diocesan priests after their expulsion by exile laws.

== Similarities with the &quot;letter of Jesus Christ on Sunday&quot; ==

On 2 May 1847, the , an anticlerical newspaper from Lyon, attacked the apparition of La Salette and denounced those who &quot;deceive the credulity of peasants by inventing miracles, such as the letters of Jesus Christ, the apparitions of angels and the Virgin&quot;.

These &#x27;letters of Jesus Christ&#x27; are variants of the , a New Testament apocryphon whose first known mention dates from around 584.

In such a &quot;letter&quot;, seized in 1818 from a pedlar in the department of Isère, Christ says in particular: &quot;Attacks (sins) so worthy of the most cruel punishments, are stopped by the prayers of the divine Mary my very dear Mother [...]. I have given you six days to work, and the seventh to rest[...] but you make it a day to accomplish the works of the devil, such as gambling, drunkenness, blasphemy[...].&quot; A similar document, seized from the same peddler, begins with these words: &quot;Here is the hand of Our Lord Jesus Christ, which is ready to punish sinners&quot; and then makes the Virgin say: &quot;I can no longer stop the anger of my Son&quot;.

The of Lyon, as seen above, had mentioned the apparition of La Salette and the &quot;Letters of Jesus Christ&quot; in the same article, but had not compared the message of the apparition and the content of the &quot;Letters&quot;. This comparison was made in 1855 by a Belgian anticlerical author who signed &quot;François-Joseph&quot;. He reproduces (after Voltaire) a version of the &quot;Letter of Jesus Christ&quot; allegedly fallen from heaven at Paimpol in 1771, which contains in particular the following words: &quot;I warn you that, if you continue to live in sin[...], I will make you feel the weight of my divine arm. If it weren&#x27;t for my dear mother&#x27;s prayers, I would have already destroyed the earth, for the sins you commit against one another. I have given you six days to work, and the seventh to rest, to sanctify my holy name, to hear holy mass, and to use the rest of the day in the service of God my father. On the contrary, we only see blasphemy and drunkenness&quot;. The &quot;Letter of Jesus Christ&quot; being considered as apocryphal by the Church, François-Joseph concludes, from the similarities between this &quot;Letter&quot; and the speech of Our Lady of La Salette, that there are there two related impostures.

Hippolyte Delehaye , president of the Bollandist Society, expressed in 1928 an opinion similar to that of François-Joseph: &quot;We will add that the famous question of the &#x27;fact of La Salette&#x27; had could have been settled sooner and more easily if one had recognized in the words attributed to the Blessed Virgin one of the forms of the celestial letter, barely demarcated.[...] One has not even taken the trouble to arrange a text originally placed in the mouth of the Saviour, but which, pronounced by the Virgin, no longer makes sense: &#x27;I gave you six days to work, I reserved the seventh for myself, and they don&#x27;t want to give it me.&#x27; Particularly significant is the title given to the first draft, written on September 20, 1846, the very day after the event: &#x27;Letter dictated by the Blessed Virgin to two children on the mountain of La Salette-Fallavaux.&#x27; We won&#x27;t add any comments.&quot;

==The secrets==
No mention of secrets is made in the children&#x27;s first accounts. The children later reported that the Blessed Virgin had confided a special secret to each of them. These two secrets, which neither Mélanie nor Maximin ever made known to each other, were sent by them in 1851 to Pope Pius IX on the advice of de Bruillard. It is assumed that these secrets were of a personal nature. Maximin advised the Marquise de Monteyard, &quot;Ah, it is good fortune.&quot; In October 1999, Fr. Michel Corteville discovered the original Secrets given to Pope Pius IX in 1851, buried for more than one century in the Vatican archives.

=== Maximin&#x27;s secret ===
The text sent by Maximin to Pope Pius IX and discovered in the Vatican archives reads as follows:

=== Melanie&#x27;s secret ===
The text sent by Mélanie to Pope Pius IX and discovered in the Vatican archives reads as follows:

=== Subsequent version of Mélanie&#x27;s secret ===
In 1879, Mélanie released a greatly expanded version of the secret, including new interpretations of the true secret as well as completely new revelations unmentioned in the 1851 version; such new version were published under the title of and contained several apocalyptic claims, such as that Rome would lose its faith and become the See of the Antichrist. While the book initially received an &quot;imprimatur&quot; by Archbishop Salvatore Luigi Zola of Lecce, its contents were later deemed to be false and in contrast with the Catholic faith by the Holy See, and were subsequently put onto the by decree of the Holy Office on 9 May 1923.

The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; describes the new version of the secret as &quot;a work of imagination&quot;, arguing that, over the years, Mélanie&#x27;s mind had been disturbed by reading apocalyptic books and the lives of the Illuminati.

==Fate of the children==
&quot;Maximin Giraud, after an unhappy and wandering life, returned to Corps, his native village, and died there a holy death (1 March 1875). Mélanie Calvat ended a no less wandering life at Altamura, Italy (15 December 1904).&quot;

Mélanie Calvat died as a Catholic nun at Altamura, Italy, on 15 December 1904.

==Legacy==
The Missionaries of Our Lady of La Salette were founded in 1852 by Philbert de Bruillard, Bishop of Grenoble, France, and presently serve in some 25 countries.

The U.S. National Shrine of Our Lady of La Salette is located in Attleboro, Massachusetts. Known simply as &quot;La Salette&quot; locally, it is famous for its Festival of Lights, held annually during the Christmas season, where the grounds are decorated with elaborate Christmas light displays. The shrine is visited by over 1 million people per year and hosts many pilgrimages and retreats throughout the year.
