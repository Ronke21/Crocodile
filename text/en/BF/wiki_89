<text>Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical analysis and data structures to analyze and solve problems that involve fluid flows. Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the free-stream flow of the fluid, and the interaction of the fluid (liquids and gases) with surfaces defined by boundary conditions. With high-speed supercomputers, better solutions can be achieved, and are often required to solve the largest and most complex problems. Ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as transonic or turbulent flows. Initial validation of such software is typically performed using experimental apparatus such as wind tunnels. In addition, previously performed analytical or empirical analysis of a particular problem can be used for comparison. A final validation is often performed using full-scale testing, such as flight tests.

CFD is applied to a wide range of research and engineering problems in many fields of study and industries, including aerodynamics and aerospace analysis, hypersonics, weather simulation, natural science and environmental engineering, industrial system design and analysis, biological engineering, fluid flows and heat transfer, engine and combustion analysis, and visual effects for film and games.

==Background and history==

The fundamental basis of almost all CFD problems is the Navier–Stokes equations, which define many single-phase (gas or liquid, but not both) fluid flows. These equations can be simplified by removing terms describing viscous actions to yield the Euler equations. Further simplification, by removing terms describing vorticity yields the full potential equations. Finally, for small perturbations in subsonic and supersonic flows (not transonic or hypersonic) these equations can be linearized to yield the linearized potential equations.

Historically, methods were first developed to solve the linearized potential equations. Two-dimensional (2D) methods, using conformal transformations of the flow about a cylinder to the flow about an airfoil were developed in the 1930s.

One of the earliest type of calculations resembling modern CFD are those by Lewis Fry Richardson, in the sense that these calculations used finite differences and divided the physical space in cells. Although they failed dramatically, these calculations, together with Richardson&#x27;s book &quot;Weather Prediction by Numerical Process&quot;, set the basis for modern CFD and numerical meteorology. In fact, early CFD calculations during the 1940s using ENIAC used methods close to those in Richardson&#x27;s 1922 book.

The computer power available paced development of three-dimensional methods. Probably the first work using computers to model fluid flow, as governed by the Navier–Stokes equations, was performed at Los Alamos National Lab, in the T3 group. This group was led by Francis H. Harlow, who is widely considered one of the pioneers of CFD. From 1957 to late 1960s, this group developed a variety of numerical methods to simulate transient two-dimensional fluid flows, such as particle-in-cell method, fluid-in-cell method, vorticity stream function method, and
marker-and-cell method. Fromm&#x27;s vorticity-stream-function method for 2D, transient, incompressible flow was the first treatment of strongly contorting incompressible flows in the world.

The first paper with three-dimensional model was published by John Hess and A.M.O. Smith of Douglas Aircraft in 1967. This method discretized the surface of the geometry with panels, giving rise to this class of programs being called Panel Methods. Their method itself was simplified, in that it did not include lifting flows and hence was mainly applied to ship hulls and aircraft fuselages. The first lifting Panel Code (A230) was described in a paper written by Paul Rubbert and Gary Saaris of Boeing Aircraft in 1968. In time, more advanced three-dimensional Panel Codes were developed at Boeing (PANAIR, A502), Lockheed (Quadpan), Douglas (HESS), McDonnell Aircraft (MACAERO), NASA (PMARC) and Analytical Methods (WBAERO, USAERO and VSAERO). Some (PANAIR, HESS and MACAERO) were higher order codes, using higher order distributions of surface singularities, while others (Quadpan, PMARC, USAERO and VSAERO) used single singularities on each surface panel. The advantage of the lower order codes was that they ran much faster on the computers of the time. Today, VSAERO has grown to be a multi-order code and is the most widely used program of this class. It has been used in the development of many submarines, surface ships, automobiles, helicopters, aircraft, and more recently wind turbines. Its sister code, USAERO is an unsteady panel method that has also been used for modeling such things as high speed trains and racing yachts. The NASA PMARC code from an early version of VSAERO and a derivative of PMARC, named CMARC, is also commercially available.

In the two-dimensional realm, a number of Panel Codes have been developed for airfoil analysis and design. The codes typically have a boundary layer analysis included, so that viscous effects can be modeled. developed the PROFILE code, partly with NASA funding, which became available in the early 1980s. This was soon followed by Mark Drela&#x27;s XFOIL code. Both PROFILE and XFOIL incorporate two-dimensional panel codes, with coupled boundary layer codes for airfoil analysis work. PROFILE uses a conformal transformation method for inverse airfoil design, while XFOIL has both a conformal transformation and an inverse panel method for airfoil design.

An intermediate step between Panel Codes and Full Potential codes were codes that used the Transonic Small Disturbance equations. In particular, the three-dimensional WIBCO code, developed by Charlie Boppe of Grumman Aircraft in the early 1980s has seen heavy use.

Developers turned to Full Potential codes, as panel methods could not calculate the non-linear flow present at transonic speeds. The first description of a means of using the Full Potential equations was published by Earll Murman and Julian Cole of Boeing in 1970. Frances Bauer, Paul Garabedian and David Korn of the Courant Institute at New York University (NYU) wrote a series of two-dimensional Full Potential airfoil codes that were widely used, the most important being named Program H. A further growth of Program H was developed by Bob Melnik and his group at Grumman Aerospace as Grumfoil. Antony Jameson, originally at Grumman Aircraft and the Courant Institute of NYU, worked with David Caughey to develop the important three-dimensional Full Potential code FLO22 in 1975. Many Full Potential codes emerged after this, culminating in Boeing&#x27;s Tranair (A633) code, which still sees heavy use.

The next step was the Euler equations, which promised to provide more accurate solutions of transonic flows. The methodology used by Jameson in his three-dimensional FLO57 code (1981) was used by others to produce such programs as Lockheed&#x27;s TEAM program and IAI/Analytical Methods&#x27; MGAERO program. MGAERO is unique in being a structured cartesian mesh code, while most other such codes use structured body-fitted grids (with the exception of NASA&#x27;s highly successful CART3D code, Lockheed&#x27;s SPLITFLOW code and Georgia Tech&#x27;s NASCART-GT). Antony Jameson also developed the three-dimensional AIRPLANE code which made use of unstructured tetrahedral grids.

In the two-dimensional realm, Mark Drela and Michael Giles, then graduate students at MIT, developed the ISES Euler program (actually a suite of programs) for airfoil design and analysis. This code first became available in 1986 and has been further developed to design, analyze and optimize single or multi-element airfoils, as the MSES program. MSES sees wide use throughout the world. A derivative of MSES, for the design and analysis of airfoils in a cascade, is MISES, developed by Harold Youngren while he was a graduate student at MIT.

The Navier–Stokes equations were the ultimate target of development. Two-dimensional codes, such as NASA Ames&#x27; ARC2D code first emerged. A number of three-dimensional codes were developed (ARC3D, OVERFLOW, CFL3D are three successful NASA contributions), leading to numerous commercial packages.

Recently CFD methods have gained traction for modeling the flow behavior of granular materials within various chemical processes in engineering. This approach has emerged as a cost-effective alternative, offering a nuanced understanding of complex flow phenomena while minimizing expenses associated with traditional experimental methods.

==Hierarchy of fluid flow equations==

CFD can be seen as a group of computational methodologies (discussed below) used to solve equations governing fluid flow. In the application of CFD, a critical step is to decide which set of physical assumptions and related equations need to be used for the problem at hand. To illustrate this step, the following summarizes the physical assumptions/simplifications taken in equations of a flow that is single-phase (see multiphase flow and two-phase flow), single-species (i.e., it consists of one chemical species), non-reacting, and (unless said otherwise) compressible. Thermal radiation is neglected, and body forces due to gravity are considered (unless said otherwise). In addition, for this type of flow, the next discussion highlights the hierarchy of flow equations solved with CFD. Note that some of the following equations could be derived in more than one way.

* Conservation laws (CL): These are the most fundamental equations considered with CFD in the sense that, for example, all the following equations can be derived from them. For a single-phase, single-species, compressible flow one considers the conservation of mass, conservation of linear momentum, and conservation of energy.

* Continuum conservation laws (CCL): Start with the CL. Assume that mass, momentum and energy are &quot;locally&quot; conserved: These quantities are conserved and cannot &quot;teleport&quot; from one place to another but can only move by a continuous flow (see continuity equation). Another interpretation is that one starts with the CL and assumes a continuum medium (see continuum mechanics). The resulting system of equations is unclosed since to solve it one needs further relationships/equations: (a) constitutive relationships for the viscous stress tensor; (b) constitutive relationships for the diffusive heat flux; (c) an equation of state (EOS), such as the ideal gas law; and, (d) a caloric equation of state relating temperature with quantities such as enthalpy or internal energy.
* Compressible Navier-Stokes equations (C-NS): Start with the CCL. Assume a Newtonian viscous stress tensor (see Newtonian fluid) and a Fourier heat flux (see heat flux). The C-NS need to be augmented with an EOS and a caloric EOS to have a closed system of equations.
* Incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (I-NS): Start with the C-NS. Assume that density is always and everywhere constant. Another way to obtain the I-NS is to assume that the Mach number is very small and that temperature differences in the fluid are very small as well. As a result, the mass-conservation and momentum-conservation equations are decoupled from the energy-conservation equation, so one only needs to solve for the first two equations.
* Compressible Euler equations (EE): Start with the C-NS. Assume a frictionless flow with no diffusive heat flux. 

* Weakly compressible Navier-Stokes equations (WC-NS): Start with the C-NS. Assume that density variations depend only on temperature and not on pressure. For example, for an ideal gas, use formula_1, where formula_2 is a conveniently-defined reference pressure that is always and everywhere constant, formula_3 is density, formula_4 is the specific gas constant, and formula_5 is temperature. As a result, the WC-NS do not capture acoustic waves. It is also common in the WC-NS to neglect the pressure-work and viscous-heating terms in the energy-conservation equation. The WC-NS are also called the C-NS with the low-Mach-number approximation.
* Boussinesq equations: Start with the C-NS. Assume that density variations are always and everywhere negligible except in the gravity term of the momentum-conservation equation (where density multiplies the gravitational acceleration). Also assume that various fluid properties such as viscosity, thermal conductivity, and heat capacity are always and everywhere constant. The Boussinesq equations are widely used in microscale meteorology.
* Compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations and compressible Favre-averaged Navier-Stokes equations (C-RANS and C-FANS): Start with the C-NS. Assume that any flow variable formula_6, such as density, velocity and pressure, can be represented as formula_7, where formula_8 is the ensemble-average of any flow variable, and formula_9 is a perturbation or fluctuation from this average. formula_9 is not necessarily small. If formula_8 is a classic ensemble-average (see Reynolds decomposition) one obtains the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. And if formula_8 is a density-weighted ensemble-average one obtains the Favre-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. As a result, and depending on the Reynolds number, the range of scales of motion is greatly reduced, something which leads to much faster solutions in comparison to solving the C-NS. However, information is lost, and the resulting system of equations requires the closure of various unclosed terms, notably the Reynolds stress.
* Ideal flow or potential flow equations: Start with the EE. Assume zero fluid-particle rotation (zero vorticity) and zero flow expansion (zero divergence). The resulting flowfield is entirely determined by the geometrical boundaries. Ideal flows can be useful in modern CFD to initialize simulations.
* Linearized compressible Euler equations (LEE): Start with the EE. Assume that any flow variable formula_6, such as density, velocity and pressure, can be represented as formula_14, where formula_15 is the value of the flow variable at some reference or base state, and formula_16 is a perturbation or fluctuation from this state. Furthermore, assume that this perturbation formula_16 is very small in comparison with some reference value. Finally, assume that formula_15 satisfies &quot;its own&quot; equation, such as the EE. The LEE and its many variations are widely used in computational aeroacoustics.
* Sound wave or acoustic wave equation: Start with the LEE. Neglect all gradients of formula_15 and formula_16, and assume that the Mach number at the reference or base state is very small. The resulting equations for density, momentum and energy can be manipulated into a pressure equation, giving the well-known sound wave equation.
* Shallow water equations (SW): Consider a flow near a wall where the wall-parallel length-scale of interest is much larger than the wall-normal length-scale of interest. Start with the EE. Assume that density is always and everywhere constant, neglect the velocity component perpendicular to the wall, and consider the velocity parallel to the wall to be spatially-constant.
* Boundary layer equations (BL): Start with the C-NS (I-NS) for compressible (incompressible) boundary layers. Assume that there are thin regions next to walls where spatial gradients perpendicular to the wall are much larger than those parallel to the wall.
* Bernoulli equation: Start with the EE. Assume that density variations depend only on pressure variations. See Bernoulli&#x27;s Principle.
* Steady Bernoulli equation: Start with the Bernoulli Equation and assume a steady flow. Or start with the EE and assume that the flow is steady and integrate the resulting equation along a streamline.
* Stokes Flow or creeping flow equations: Start with the C-NS or I-NS. Neglect the inertia of the flow. Such an assumption can be justified when the Reynolds number is very low. As a result, the resulting set of equations is linear, something which simplifies greatly their solution.
* Two-dimensional channel flow equation: Consider the flow between two infinite parallel plates. Start with the C-NS. Assume that the flow is steady, two-dimensional, and fully developed (i.e., the velocity profile does not change along the streamwise direction). Note that this widely-used fully-developed assumption can be inadequate in some instances, such as some compressible, microchannel flows, in which case it can be supplanted by a &quot;locally&quot; fully-developed assumption.
* One-dimensional Euler equations or one-dimensional gas-dynamic equations (1D-EE): Start with the EE. Assume that all flow quantities depend only on one spatial dimension.
* Fanno flow equation: Consider the flow inside a duct with constant area and adiabatic walls. Start with the 1D-EE. Assume a steady flow, no gravity effects, and introduce in the momentum-conservation equation an empirical term to recover the effect of wall friction (neglected in the EE). To close the Fanno flow equation, a model for this friction term is needed. Such a closure involves problem-dependent assumptions.
* Rayleigh flow equation. Consider the flow inside a duct with constant area and either non-adiabatic walls without volumetric heat sources or adiabatic walls with volumetric heat sources. Start with the 1D-EE. Assume a steady flow, no gravity effects, and introduce in the energy-conservation equation an empirical term to recover the effect of wall heat transfer or the effect of the heat sources (neglected in the EE).

==Methodology==
In all of these approaches the same basic procedure is followed.
* During preprocessing
** The geometry and physical bounds of the problem can be defined using computer aided design (CAD). From there, data can be suitably processed (cleaned-up) and the fluid volume (or fluid domain) is extracted.
** The volume occupied by the fluid is divided into discrete cells (the mesh). The mesh may be uniform or non-uniform, structured or unstructured, consisting of a combination of hexahedral, tetrahedral, prismatic, pyramidal or polyhedral elements.
** The physical modeling is defined – for example, the equations of fluid motion + enthalpy + radiation + species conservation
** Boundary conditions are defined. This involves specifying the fluid behaviour and properties at all bounding surfaces of the fluid domain. For transient problems, the initial conditions are also defined.
* The simulation is started and the equations are solved iteratively as a steady-state or transient.
* Finally a postprocessor is used for the analysis and visualization of the resulting solution.

===Discretization methods===
The stability of the selected discretisation is generally established numerically rather than analytically as with simple linear problems. Special care must also be taken to ensure that the discretisation handles discontinuous solutions gracefully. The Euler equations and Navier–Stokes equations both admit shocks and contact surfaces.

Some of the discretization methods being used are:

==== Finite volume method ====

The finite volume method (FVM) is a common approach used in CFD codes, as it has an advantage in memory usage and solution speed, especially for large problems, high Reynolds number turbulent flows, and source term dominated flows (like combustion).

In the finite volume method, the governing partial differential equations (typically the Navier-Stokes equations, the mass and energy conservation equations, and the turbulence equations) are recast in a conservative form, and then solved over discrete control volumes. This discretization guarantees the conservation of fluxes through a particular control volume. The finite volume equation yields governing equations in the form,
:formula_21
where formula_22 is the vector of conserved variables, formula_23 is the vector of fluxes (see Euler equations or Navier–Stokes equations), formula_24 is the volume of the control volume element, and formula_25 is the surface area of the control volume element.

==== Finite element method ====

The finite element method (FEM) is used in structural analysis of solids, but is also applicable to fluids. However, the FEM formulation requires special care to ensure a conservative solution. The FEM formulation has been adapted for use with fluid dynamics governing equations. Although FEM must be carefully formulated to be conservative, it is much more stable than the finite volume approach. FEM also provides more accurate solutions for smooth problems comparing to FVM. Another advantage of FEM is that it can handle complex geometries and boundary conditions. However, FEM can require more memory and has slower solution times than the FVM.

In this method, a weighted residual equation is formed:

:formula_26

where formula_27 is the equation residual at an element vertex formula_28, formula_22 is the conservation equation expressed on an element basis, formula_30 is the weight factor, and formula_31 is the volume of the element.

==== Finite difference method ====

The finite difference method (FDM) has historical importance and is simple to program. It is currently only used in few specialized codes, which handle complex geometry with high accuracy and efficiency by using embedded boundaries or overlapping grids (with the solution interpolated across each grid). 
:formula_32
where formula_22 is the vector of conserved variables, and formula_23, formula_35, and formula_36 are the fluxes in the formula_37, formula_38, and formula_39 directions respectively.

==== Spectral element method ====

Spectral element method is a finite element type method. It requires the mathematical problem (the partial differential equation) to be cast in a weak formulation. This is typically done by multiplying the differential equation by an arbitrary test function and integrating over the whole domain. Purely mathematically, the test functions are completely arbitrary - they belong to an infinite-dimensional function space. Clearly an infinite-dimensional function space cannot be represented on a discrete spectral element mesh; this is where the spectral element discretization begins. The most crucial thing is the choice of interpolating and testing functions. In a standard, low order FEM in 2D, for quadrilateral elements the most typical choice is the bilinear test or interpolating function of the form formula_40. In a spectral element method however, the interpolating and test functions are chosen to be polynomials of a very high order (typically e.g. of the 10th order in CFD applications). This guarantees the rapid convergence of the method. Furthermore, very efficient integration procedures must be used, since the number of integrations to be performed in numerical codes is big. Thus, high order Gauss integration quadratures are employed, since they achieve the highest accuracy with the smallest number of computations to be carried out.
At the time there are some academic CFD codes based on the spectral element method and some more are currently under development, since the new time-stepping schemes arise in the scientific world.

==== Lattice Boltzmann method ====

The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) with its simplified kinetic picture on a lattice provides a computationally efficient description of hydrodynamics.
Unlike the traditional CFD methods, which solve the conservation equations of macroscopic properties (i.e., mass, momentum, and energy) numerically, LBM models the fluid consisting of fictive particles, and such particles perform consecutive propagation and collision processes over a discrete lattice mesh. In this method, one works with the discrete in space and time version of the kinetic evolution equation in the Boltzmann Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) form.

==== Vortex method ====

The vortex method, also Lagrangian Vortex Particle Method, is a meshfree technique for the simulation of incompressible turbulent flows. In it, vorticity is discretized onto Lagrangian particles, these computational elements being called vortices, vortons, or vortex particles. Vortex methods were developed as a grid-free methodology that would not be limited by the fundamental smoothing effects associated with grid-based methods. To be practical, however, vortex methods require means for rapidly computing velocities from the vortex elements – in other words they require the solution to a particular form of the N-body problem (in which the motion of N objects is tied to their mutual influences). This breakthrough came in the 1980s with the development of the Barnes-Hut and fast multipole method (FMM) algorithms. These paved the way to practical computation of the velocities from the vortex elements.

Software based on the vortex method offer a new means for solving tough fluid dynamics problems with minimal user intervention. All that is required is specification of problem geometry and setting of boundary and initial conditions. Among the significant advantages of this modern technology;
* It is practically grid-free, thus eliminating numerous iterations associated with RANS and LES.
* All problems are treated identically. No modeling or calibration inputs are required.
* Time-series simulations, which are crucial for correct analysis of acoustics, are possible.
* The small scale and large scale are accurately simulated at the same time.

==== Boundary element method ====

In the boundary element method, the boundary occupied by the fluid is divided into a surface mesh.

==== High-resolution discretization schemes ====

High-resolution schemes are used where shocks or discontinuities are present. Capturing sharp changes in the solution requires the use of second or higher-order numerical schemes that do not introduce spurious oscillations. This usually necessitates the application of flux limiters to ensure that the solution is total variation diminishing.

===Turbulence models===

In computational modeling of turbulent flows, one common objective is to obtain a model that can predict quantities of interest, such as fluid velocity, for use in engineering designs of the system being modeled. For turbulent flows, the range of length scales and complexity of phenomena involved in turbulence make most modeling approaches prohibitively expensive; the resolution required to resolve all scales involved in turbulence is beyond what is computationally possible. The primary approach in such cases is to create numerical models to approximate unresolved phenomena. This section lists some commonly used computational models for turbulent flows.

Turbulence models can be classified based on computational expense, which corresponds to the range of scales that are modeled versus resolved (the more turbulent scales that are resolved, the finer the resolution of the simulation, and therefore the higher the computational cost). If a majority or all of the turbulent scales are not modeled, the computational cost is very low, but the tradeoff comes in the form of decreased accuracy.

In addition to the wide range of length and time scales and the associated computational cost, the governing equations of fluid dynamics contain a non-linear convection term and a non-linear and non-local pressure gradient term. These nonlinear equations must be solved numerically with the appropriate boundary and initial conditions.

==== Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes ====

Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations are the oldest approach to turbulence modeling. An ensemble version of the governing equations is solved, which introduces new &quot;apparent stresses&quot; known as Reynolds stresses. This adds a second-order tensor of unknowns for which various models can provide different levels of closure. It is a common misconception that the RANS equations do not apply to flows with a time-varying mean flow because these equations are &#x27;time-averaged&#x27;. In fact, statistically unsteady (or non-stationary) flows can equally be treated. This is sometimes referred to as URANS. There is nothing inherent in Reynolds averaging to preclude this, but the turbulence models used to close the equations are valid only as long as the time over which these changes in the mean occur is large compared to the time scales of the turbulent motion containing most of the energy.

RANS models can be divided into two broad approaches:

; Boussinesq hypothesis: This method involves using an algebraic equation for the Reynolds stresses which include determining the turbulent viscosity, and depending on the level of sophistication of the model, solving transport equations for determining the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation. Models include k-ε (Launder and Spalding), Mixing Length Model (Prandtl), and Zero Equation Model (Cebeci and Smith). The models available in this approach are often referred to by the number of transport equations associated with the method. For example, the Mixing Length model is a &quot;Zero Equation&quot; model because no transport equations are solved; the formula_41 is a &quot;Two Equation&quot; model because two transport equations (one for formula_42 and one for formula_43) are solved.
; Reynolds stress model (RSM): This approach attempts to actually solve transport equations for the Reynolds stresses. This means introduction of several transport equations for all the Reynolds stresses and hence this approach is much more costly in CPU effort.

====Large eddy simulation====

Large eddy simulation (LES) is a technique in which the smallest scales of the flow are removed through a filtering operation, and their effect modeled using subgrid scale models. This allows the largest and most important scales of the turbulence to be resolved, while greatly reducing the computational cost incurred by the smallest scales. This method requires greater computational resources than RANS methods, but is far cheaper than DNS.

====Detached eddy simulation====
Detached eddy simulations (DES) is a modification of a RANS model in which the model switches to a subgrid scale formulation in regions fine enough for LES calculations. Regions near solid boundaries and where the turbulent length scale is less than the maximum grid dimension are assigned the RANS mode of solution. As the turbulent length scale exceeds the grid dimension, the regions are solved using the LES mode. Therefore, the grid resolution for DES is not as demanding as pure LES, thereby considerably cutting down the cost of the computation. Though DES was initially formulated for the Spalart-Allmaras model (Philippe R. Spalart et al., 1997), it can be implemented with other RANS models (Strelets, 2001), by appropriately modifying the length scale which is explicitly or implicitly involved in the RANS model. So while Spalart–Allmaras model based DES acts as LES with a wall model, DES based on other models (like two equation models) behave as a hybrid RANS-LES model. Grid generation is more complicated than for a simple RANS or LES case due to the RANS-LES switch. DES is a non-zonal approach and provides a single smooth velocity field across the RANS and the LES regions of the solutions.
====Direct numerical simulation====
Direct numerical simulation (DNS) resolves the entire range of turbulent length scales. This marginalizes the effect of models, but is extremely expensive. The computational cost is proportional to formula_44. DNS is intractable for flows with complex geometries or flow configurations.

====Coherent vortex simulation====

The coherent vortex simulation approach decomposes the turbulent flow field into a coherent part, consisting of organized vortical motion, and the incoherent part, which is the random background flow. This decomposition is done using wavelet filtering. The approach has much in common with LES, since it uses decomposition and resolves only the filtered portion, but different in that it does not use a linear, low-pass filter. Instead, the filtering operation is based on wavelets, and the filter can be adapted as the flow field evolves. Farge and Schneider tested the CVS method with two flow configurations and showed that the coherent portion of the flow exhibited the formula_45 energy spectrum exhibited by the total flow, and corresponded to coherent structures (vortex tubes), while the incoherent parts of the flow composed homogeneous background noise, which exhibited no organized structures. Goldstein and Vasilyev applied the FDV model to large eddy simulation, but did not assume that the wavelet filter eliminated all coherent motions from the subfilter scales. By employing both LES and CVS filtering, they showed that the SFS dissipation was dominated by the SFS flow field&#x27;s coherent portion.

====PDF methods====

Probability density function (PDF) methods for turbulence, first introduced by Lundgren, are based on tracking the one-point PDF of the velocity, formula_46, which gives the probability of the velocity at point formula_47 being between formula_48 and formula_49. This approach is analogous to the kinetic theory of gases, in which the macroscopic properties of a gas are described by a large number of particles. PDF methods are unique in that they can be applied in the framework of a number of different turbulence models; the main differences occur in the form of the PDF transport equation. For example, in the context of large eddy simulation, the PDF becomes the filtered PDF. PDF methods can also be used to describe chemical reactions, and are particularly useful for simulating chemically reacting flows because the chemical source term is closed and does not require a model. The PDF is commonly tracked by using Lagrangian particle methods; when combined with large eddy simulation, this leads to a Langevin equation for subfilter particle evolution.

====Vorticity confinement method====

The vorticity confinement (VC) method is an Eulerian technique used in the simulation of turbulent wakes. It uses a solitary-wave like approach to produce a stable solution with no numerical spreading. VC can capture the small-scale features to within as few as 2 grid cells. Within these features, a nonlinear difference equation is solved as opposed to the finite difference equation. VC is similar to shock capturing methods, where conservation laws are satisfied, so that the essential integral quantities are accurately computed.

====Linear eddy model====

The Linear eddy model is a technique used to simulate the convective mixing that takes place in turbulent flow. Specifically, it provides a mathematical way to describe the interactions of a scalar variable within the vector flow field. It is primarily used in one-dimensional representations of turbulent flow, since it can be applied across a wide range of length scales and Reynolds numbers. This model is generally used as a building block for more complicated flow representations, as it provides high resolution predictions that hold across a large range of flow conditions.

===Two-phase flow===

The modeling of two-phase flow is still under development. Different methods have been proposed, including the Volume of fluid method, the level-set method and front tracking. These methods often involve a tradeoff between maintaining a sharp interface or conserving mass . This is crucial since the evaluation of the density, viscosity and surface tension is based on the values averaged over the interface.

===Solution algorithms===

Discretization in the space produces a system of ordinary differential equations for unsteady problems and algebraic equations for steady problems. Implicit or semi-implicit methods are generally used to integrate the ordinary differential equations, producing a system of (usually) nonlinear algebraic equations. Applying a Newton or Picard iteration produces a system of linear equations which is nonsymmetric in the presence of advection and indefinite in the presence of incompressibility. Such systems, particularly in 3D, are frequently too large for direct solvers, so iterative methods are used, either stationary methods such as successive overrelaxation or Krylov subspace methods. Krylov methods such as GMRES, typically used with preconditioning, operate by minimizing the residual over successive subspaces generated by the preconditioned operator.

Multigrid has the advantage of asymptotically optimal performance on many problems. Traditional solvers and preconditioners are effective at reducing high-frequency components of the residual, but low-frequency components typically require many iterations to reduce. By operating on multiple scales, multigrid reduces all components of the residual by similar factors, leading to a mesh-independent number of iterations.

For indefinite systems, preconditioners such as incomplete LU factorization, additive Schwarz, and multigrid perform poorly or fail entirely, so the problem structure must be used for effective preconditioning. Methods commonly used in CFD are the SIMPLE and Uzawa algorithms which exhibit mesh-dependent convergence rates, but recent advances based on block LU factorization combined with multigrid for the resulting definite systems have led to preconditioners that deliver mesh-independent convergence rates.

===Unsteady aerodynamics===
CFD made a major break through in late 70s with the introduction of LTRAN2, a 2-D code to model oscillating airfoils based on transonic small perturbation theory by Ballhaus and associates. It uses a Murman-Cole switch algorithm for modeling the moving shock-waves. Later it was extended to 3-D with use of a rotated difference scheme by AFWAL/Boeing that resulted in LTRAN3.

===Biomedical engineering===
CFD investigations are used to clarify the characteristics of aortic flow in details that are beyond the capabilities of experimental measurements. To analyze these conditions, CAD models of the human vascular system are extracted employing modern imaging techniques such as MRI or Computed Tomography. A 3D model is reconstructed from this data and the fluid flow can be computed. Blood properties such as density and viscosity, and realistic boundary conditions (e.g. systemic pressure) have to be taken into consideration. Therefore, making it possible to analyze and optimize the flow in the cardiovascular system for different applications.

=== CPU versus GPU ===
Traditionally, CFD simulations are performed on CPUs.

In a more recent trend, simulations are also performed on GPUs. These typically contain slower but more processors. For CFD algorithms that feature good parallelism performance (i.e. good speed-up by adding more cores) this can greatly reduce simulation times. Fluid-implicit particle and lattice-Boltzmann methods are typical examples of codes that scale well on GPUs.

<text>Vitrification (, via French &quot;&quot;) is the full or partial transformation of a substance into a glass, that is to say, a non-crystalline or amorphous solid. Glasses differ from liquids structurally and glasses possess a higher degree of connectivity with the same Hausdorff dimensionality of bonds as crystals: dimH = 3. In the production of ceramics, vitrification is responsible for their impermeability to water.

Vitrification is usually achieved by heating materials until they liquify, then cooling the liquid, often rapidly, so that it passes through the glass transition to form a glassy solid. Certain chemical reactions also result in glasses.

In terms of chemistry, vitrification is characteristic for amorphous materials or disordered systems and occurs when bonding between elementary particles (atoms, molecules, forming blocks) becomes higher than a certain threshold value. Thermal fluctuations break the bonds; therefore, the lower the temperature, the higher the degree of connectivity. Because of that, amorphous materials have a characteristic threshold temperature termed glass transition temperature (&quot;T&quot;g): below &quot;T&quot;g amorphous materials are glassy whereas above &quot;T&quot;g they are molten.

The most common applications are in the making of pottery, glass, and some types of food, but there are many others, such as the vitrification of an antifreeze-like liquid in cryopreservation.

In a different sense of the word, the embedding of material inside a glassy matrix is also called &quot;vitrification&quot;. An important application is the vitrification of radioactive waste to obtain a substance that is thought to be safer and more stable for disposal.

One study suggests during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, a victim&#x27;s brain was vitrified by the extreme heat of the volcanic ash; however, this has been strenuously disputed.

==Ceramics==
Vitrification is the progressive partial fusion of a clay, or of a body, as a result of a firing process. As vitrification proceeds, the proportion of glassy bond increases and the apparent porosity of the fired product becomes progressively lower. Vitreous bodies have open porosity, and may be either opaque or translucent. In this context, &quot;zero porosity&quot; may be defined as less than 1% water absorption. However, various standard procedures define the conditions of water absorption. An example is by ASTM, who state &quot;The term vitreous generally signifies less than 0.5% absorption, except for floor and wall tile and low-voltage electrical insulators, which are considered vitreous up to 3% water absorption.&quot;

Pottery can be made impermeable to water by glazing or by vitrification. Porcelain, bone china, and sanitaryware are examples of vitrified pottery, and are impermeable even without glaze. Stoneware may be vitrified or semi-vitrified; the latter type would not be impermeable without glaze.

==Applications==
When sucrose is cooled slowly it results in crystal sugar (or rock candy), but when cooled rapidly it can form syrupy cotton candy (candyfloss).

Vitrification can also occur in a liquid such as water, usually through very rapid cooling or the introduction of agents that suppress the formation of ice crystals. This is in contrast to ordinary freezing which results in ice crystal formation. Vitrification is used in cryo-electron microscopy to cool samples so quickly that they can be imaged with an electron microscope without damage. In 2017, the Nobel prize for chemistry was awarded for the development of this technology, which can be used to image objects such as proteins or virus particles.

Ordinary soda-lime glass, used in windows and drinking containers, is created by the addition of sodium carbonate and lime (calcium oxide) to silicon dioxide. Without these additives, silicon dioxide would require very high temperature to obtain a melt, and subsequently (with slow cooling) a glass.

Vitrification is used in disposal and long-term storage of nuclear waste or other hazardous wastes in a method called geomelting. Waste is mixed with glass-forming chemicals in a furnace to form molten glass that then solidifies in canisters, thereby immobilizing the waste. The final waste form resembles obsidian and is a non-leaching, durable material that effectively traps the waste inside. It is widely assumed that such waste can be stored for relatively long periods in this form without concern for air or groundwater contamination. Bulk vitrification uses electrodes to melt soil and wastes where they lie buried. The hardened waste may then be disinterred with less danger of widespread contamination. According to the Pacific Northwest National Labs, &quot;Vitrification locks dangerous materials into a stable glass form that will last for thousands of years.&quot;

=== Vitrification in cryopreservation ===
Vitrification in cryopreservation is used to preserve, for example, human egg cells (oocytes) (in oocyte cryopreservation) and embryos (in embryo cryopreservation). It prevents ice crystal formation and is a very fast process: -23,000 °C/min.

Currently, vitrification techniques have only been applied to brains (neurovitrification) by Alcor and to the upper body by the Cryonics Institute, but research is in progress by both organizations to apply vitrification to the whole body.

Many woody plants living in polar regions naturally vitrify their cells to survive the cold. Some can survive immersion in liquid nitrogen and liquid helium. Vitrification can also be used to preserve endangered plant species and their seeds. For example, recalcitrant seeds are considered hard to preserve. Plant vitrification solution (PVS), one of application of vitrification, has successfully preserved &quot;Nymphaea caerulea&quot; seeds.

Additives used in cryobiology or produced naturally by organisms living in polar regions are called cryoprotectants.

<doc id="305929" wikidata="Q553560" url="?curid=305929" title="Harold Shapero">
<text>Harold Samuel Shapero (April 29, 1920 – May 17, 2013) was an American composer.

==Early years==
Shapero was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on April 29, 1920. He and his family later moved to nearby Newton. He learned to play the piano as a child, and for some years was a pianist in dance orchestras. With a friend, he founded the Hal Kenny Orchestra, a swing-era jazz band.

He was more interested in classical music. In his teens some of his teachers included Nicolas Slonimsky (editor of Baker&#x27;s &quot;Biographical Dictionary of Musicians&quot;) in 1936 and Ernst Krenek in 1937. At 18 he entered Harvard, where he became friends with Leonard Bernstein and studied composition with Walter Piston in 1938. He also studied with Paul Hindemith at the Berkshire Music Center in 1940–41.

Shapero was one of the first students at Tanglewood following its founding in the 1940s. When Igor Stravinsky was Norton Professor at Harvard in 1940, Shapero showed Stravinsky his &quot;Nine-Minute Overture&quot;. Shapero hoped to get the Overture played at Tanglewood that summer, but Hindemith ordered that no student compositions would be played that season. Aaron Copland hastily put together an orchestra to play student compositions, including Shapero&#x27;s Overture. Shapero was awarded the Rome Prize in 1941 for his &quot;Nine-Minute Overture&quot;, which included a $1000 award. World War II prevented him from taking advantage of the residency in Italy the prize provided.

At Harvard he held the Naumberg and Paine Fellowships. After graduating in 1941, Shapero undertook further studies with Nadia Boulanger at the Longy School of Music in 1942–43. While studying with her, Shapero was also in contact with Stravinsky, who was helpful in his critiques of Shapero&#x27;s music.

==Postwar years==
Shapero&#x27;s output was prolific in the 1940s and included three piano sonatas, the Sonata for Violin and Piano, and a variety of songs and works for chamber ensembles. His major work was the &quot;Symphony for Classical Orchestra&quot;, a 45-minute work in four movements. Decades later, he told a &quot;New York Times&quot; interviewer that he was unaware while composing it of how lengthy it had become, that he &quot;had wildly miscalculated my materials. When I measured out the slow movement, I was shocked. It was 15 minutes. I stopped working for a month. Then I tried to cut the thing. But it fought me and won. Slowly I became aware, with horror, of what I was writing: a long and difficult symphony. I thought I&#x27;d never get it performed&quot;. In 1946 Shapero won the Joseph H. Bearns Prize of US$1200 for a Symphony for String Orchestra. Leonard Bernstein &quot;fell in love&quot; with the Symphony for Classical Orchestra and led its premiere with the Boston Symphony Orchestra in January 1948. George Szell, though far less enthusiastic about the work, gave its second performance with the Cleveland Orchestra in March. Reviews were mixed. It received an award from the Koussevitsky Foundation. Bernstein recorded the work in 1953, but it was largely forgotten until revived in 1986 by André Previn to positive reviews. Previn recorded the work and played it several times with other orchestras.

In 1945, Shapero married the painter Esther Geller. Throughout the rest of the decade they were often residents at the MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, New Hampshire. In 1946 he won the second annual George Gershwin Memorial Contest for his Serenade in D, which included a performance of one movement from the work at Carnegie Hall on February 13, 1946. The prize also included publication of the score with royalties and US$1000. It was the first time Shapero had a score published.

Aaron Copland thought highly of Shapero&#x27;s technical skill and the spontaneity of musical inspiration. Once, after being impressed with Shapero&#x27;s Woodwind Quintet, he teased Leonard Bernstein, who was two years ahead of Shapero at Harvard with a note: &quot;Look to your laurels! There may be another composer in your neighborhood!&quot; But in a 1948 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, he wrote: &quot;Stylistically, Shapero seems to feel a compulsion to fashion his music after some great model. Thus, his ... Serenade ... is founded upon neoclassical Stravinskian principles, his three &quot;Amateur Piano Sonatas&quot; on Haydnesque principles, and his recent long &quot;Symphony [for Classical Orchestra]&quot; is modeled after Beethoven... [H]e seems to be suffering from a hero-worship complex—or perhaps it is a freakish attack of false modesty&quot;.

In the 1940s Shapero was closely associated with fellow Piston students Arthur Berger and Irving Fine in a &quot;Stravinsky school&quot; of American composers—a phrase first coined by Copland. He was also grouped in the &quot;Boston school&quot; along with Arthur Berger, Lukas Foss, Irving Fine, Alexeï Haieff, and Claudio Spies.

He won a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1946. He won the first of his two Fulbright Fellowships in 1948.

His output fell off by the 1960s as his neo-classical style met increasing resistance, especially in academic music circles. He told an interviewer in 1986 that &quot;Comfortable university life is a disaster, especially if you have a university that doesn’t pressure you to produce or perish. And I had a young child. I like home handicrafts and hobbies. I like gardening. I like photography. So it was only too easy to put off some of those hard operations like writing music&quot;.

In 1951 he was a fellow of the American Academy in Rome. That same year, Brandeis University hired Shapero and he later became chairman of the department and founder of its electronic music studio with the day&#x27;s most advanced synthesizers. He taught at Brandeis for 37 years. His notable students include John Adams, Gustav Ciamaga, Scott Wheeler, and Richard Wernick.

His daughter, Hannah Shapero, was born in 1953. She became a commercial artist and electronic musician.

When Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic played the local premiere of Shapero&#x27;s &quot;Credo&quot; in 1958, a work commissioned by the Louisville Orchestra, Harold Schonberg wrote: &quot;The new Shapero work is in one movement, lasts about eight and a half minutes, ... a quiet and sensitive mood piece, harmonically rather conservative (a Copland type of conservatism, with strong echoes of &quot;Our Town&quot;), but unmistakably of this generation. Mr. Shapero orchestrates beautifully; some of his combinations are very effective&quot;.

== Later years ==
When awarded his second Fulbright Fellowship in 1961, Shapero took the opportunity to travel to Europe with his family for a year. In 1971 he returned to Europe to be composer-in-residence at the American Academy in Rome.

In 1988, Shapero was forced to retire from Brandeis University. Encouraged by André Previn&#x27;s interest in his work in the late 1980s, Shapero returned to composition. His late works included &quot;Three Hebrew Songs for Tenor, Piano and String Orchestra&quot; (1989) and, not long before his death, &quot;24 Bagatelles for Piano&quot;.

Shapero died in a nursing home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on May 17, 2013, following complications from pneumonia.

==Analyses==
&quot;Symphony for Classical Orchestra&quot;. The instrumentation is largely classical with a few modern additions: woodwinds in pairs, plus piccolo and contrabassoon, pairs of horns and trumpets, three trombones, three timpani, and the standard complement of strings. Alan Rich called it &quot;the greatest American symphony&quot;. Anthony Tommasini has described it:
In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Martin Bernheimer wrote of a 1986 performance of the Symphony that &quot;Shapero reveals himself here as a superb craftsman, an artist totally in control of the grandiose variables at hand.&quot; He called the writing &quot;clever, subtle, elegant&quot; and added that the symphony &quot;isn&#x27;t affecting in spite of the inherent anachronisms, but because of them&quot;.

While Shapero uses some modern notation in his scores, he employs only procedures that have already been established by other modern composers or that are derived from traditional notation.

<text>Phelsuma astriata astriata is a subspecies of Seychelles small day gecko. It is a small, slender lizard with bright green colour that feeds primarily on insects. It is found on several islands of the Seychelles.

== Description ==

Its body is lime green with coloured dots and bars on the back. Those reddish dots sometimes form a mid-dorsal stripe, which can be very faint. Males often have a bluish or turquoise-coloured tail and lower back. On both sides of the snout, a reddish-brown stripe extends from the nostrils to the eyes. The undersurface of the body is off-white. These lizards reach a total length of about 14 cm.

== Distribution ==
This gecko is found on the Seychelles islands of Astove, Mahé, Praslin, Curieuse, La Digue, and Frégate.

== Habitat ==
This species is typically found on coconut palms and banana trees. It often lives near human settlements.

== Reproduction ==
&quot;Phelsuma astriata astriata&quot; normally lays two 10 mm eggs. Seychelles small day geckos are not gluers; they do not stick their eggs to the sides/underside of items, but instead place them in safe, well-hidden areas. Incubation is generally 65 – 70 days at 82 degrees Fahrenheit.

<doc id="305938" wikidata="Q7573278" url="?curid=305938" title="Spanish Prisoner">
<text>The Spanish Prisoner is a confidence trick originating by at least the early 19th century, as Eugène François Vidocq described in his memoirs.

==The scam==

In its original form, the confidence trickster tells his victim (the &quot;mark&quot;) that he is (or is in correspondence with) a wealthy person of high estate who has been imprisoned in Spain under a false identity. Some versions had the imprisoned person being an unknown or remote relative of the mark. Supposedly the prisoner cannot reveal his identity without serious repercussions, and is relying on a friend (the trickster) to raise money to secure his release. In this classic pigeon drop game archetype, the trickster offers to let the mark put up some of the funds, with a promise of a greater monetary reward upon release of the prisoner, and sometimes the additional reward of marrying a beautiful woman stated to be the prisoner&#x27;s daughter. After the mark has turned over the funds, he is informed further difficulties have arisen, and more money is needed. With such explanations, the trickster continues to press for more money until the victim is cleaned out, declines to put up more funds, or dies.

==Characteristics==
Key features of the Spanish Prisoner trick are the emphasis on secrecy and the trust the trickster apparently places in the mark not to reveal the prisoner&#x27;s identity or situation. The trickster will typically claim to have chosen the mark carefully, based on his reputation for honesty and straight dealing, and may appear to structure the deal so that the trickster&#x27;s ultimate share of the reward will be distributed voluntarily by the mark.

==Modern variants==
Modern variants of the Spanish Prisoner fraud include the advance-fee scam, in particular the Nigerian money transfer (or 419) scam.

<doc id="305948" wikidata="Q3017756" url="?curid=305948" title="David Dellinger">
<text>David T. Dellinger (August 22, 1915 – May 25, 2004) was an American pacifist and an activist for nonviolent social change. Although active beginning in the early 1940s, Dellinger reached peak prominence as one of the Chicago Seven, who were put on trial in 1969.

== Early life==
Dellinger was born in Wakefield, Massachusetts to a wealthy family. He was the son of Maria Fiske and Raymond Pennington Dellinger; his father was an alumnus of Yale University, a lawyer, and a prominent Republican and friend of Calvin Coolidge. His maternal grandmother, Alice Bird Fiske, was active in the Daughters of the American Revolution.

Dellinger graduated from Yale University with a Bachelor of Arts in economics, began a doctorate for a year at New College, Oxford, and studied theology at Union Theological Seminary of Columbia University with the intention of becoming a Congregationalist minister. At Yale he had been a classmate and friend of the economist and political theorist Walt Rostow. Rejecting his comfortable background, he walked out of Yale one day to live with hobos during the Depression. While at Oxford University, he visited Nazi Germany and drove an ambulance during the Spanish Civil War. Dellinger, who opposed the war&#x27;s victorious Nationalist faction, led by Francisco Franco, later recalled, &quot;After Spain, World War II was simple. I wasn&#x27;t even tempted to pick up a gun to fight for General Motors, U.S. Steel, or the Chase Manhattan Bank, even if Hitler was running the other side.&quot;

==Political career==
During World War II, he was an imprisoned conscientious objector and anti-war agitator. In federal prison, he and fellow conscientious objectors, including Ralph DiGia and Bill Sutherland, protested racial segregation in the dining halls, which were ultimately integrated because of the protests. He sat on the executive committee of the Socialist Party of America and the Young People&#x27;s Socialist League, its youth section, until he left in 1943. In February 1946, Dellinger helped to found the radical pacifist Committee for Nonviolent Revolution. In 1948, he co-founded the Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors. He was also a long-time member of the War Resisters League, joining the staff in March 1955. In July–November 1951, Dellinger participated in the Paris-to-Moscow bicycle trip for disarmament with Ralph DiGia, Bill Sutherland, and Art Emery and sponsored by the Peacemakers; cyclists got as far as the headquarters of the Soviet Army in Vienna. “We were warned not to go to the Soviet zone. People who went to the army headquarters were sometimes never seen again. But we didn’t think that would happen to us. The worst that would happen was jail, and I already knew I could stand that. I was only worried about what I was putting my family through back in the States.” The Paris-to-Moscow Bicycle Trip for Disarmament was a key inspiration for the San Francisco to Moscow Walk for Peace in 1960–1961.

In the 1950s and the 1960s, Dellinger joined freedom marches in the South and led many hunger strikes in jail. In 1956, he, Dorothy Day, and A. J. Muste founded the magazine &quot;Liberation&quot; as a forum for the pacifist, non-Marxist left. Dellinger had contacts and friendships with such diverse individuals as Eleanor Roosevelt, Ho Chi Minh, Martin Luther King Jr., Abbie Hoffman, A.J. Muste, Greg Calvert, James Bevel, David McReynolds, and numerous Black Panthers such as Fred Hampton, whom he greatly admired. As chair of the Fifth Avenue Vietnam Peace Parade Committee, he worked with many antiwar organizations and helped bring King and Bevel into leadership positions in the 1960s antiwar movement. In 1966 Dellinger travelled to both North and South Vietnam to learn first-hand the impact of American bombing. He later recalled that critics ignored his trip to Saigon and focused solely on his visit to Hanoi. In 1968, he signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments to protest the Vietnam War, and later became a sponsor of the War Tax Resistance project, which practiced and advocated tax resistance as a form of protest against the war.

===Chicago Seven trial===
As US involvement in Vietnam grew, Dellinger applied Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s principles of nonviolence to his activism within the growing antiwar movement. One of the high points of this was the Chicago Seven trial over allegations that Dellinger and several others had conspired to cross state lines with the intention of inciting a riot, after antiwar protesters had interrupted the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The ensuing court case was turned by Dellinger and his co-defendants into a nationally publicized platform for putting the Vietnam War on trial. On February 18, 1970, they were acquitted of the conspiracy charge, but five defendants, including Dellinger, were convicted of crossing state lines to incite a riot. All of the defendants, along with their two lawyers, were given sentences for contempt of court; Dellinger was sentenced to 29 months and 16 days on 32 contempt counts.

Judge Julius Hoffman&#x27;s handling of the trial, along with the FBI&#x27;s bugging of the defense lawyers, resulted, with the help of the Center for Constitutional Rights, in the convictions being overturned by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals two years later. The appeals court remanded the contempt citations for trial before a judge other than Julius Hoffman. Dellinger was eventually convicted on five contempt counts, but was sentenced to time already served.

===Subsequent activities===
Dellinger spoke at the December 1971 John Sinclair Freedom Rally in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

In the late 1970s, Dellinger spent two years teaching at Goddard College&#x27;s Adult Degree Program and Vermont College. In 2001, he was invited back to give the commencement address to the graduating class of Goddard&#x27;s Residential Undergraduate Program.

Dellinger also was a founder of &quot;Seven Days&quot;, an American alternative news magazine written from a leftist or anti-establishment perspective. Dellinger obtained the subscription list of &quot;Ramparts&quot; magazine, which ceased publication in October 1975. &quot;Seven Days&quot; began preview editions in 1975, published regularly starting in 1977 but ceased publication in 1980. 

In 1986, when his Yale class of 1936 held its 50th reunion, Dellinger wrote in the reunion book: &quot;Lest my way of life sounds puritanical or austere, I always emphasize that in the long run one can&#x27;t satisfactorily say no to war, violence, and injustice unless one is simultaneously saying yes to life, love, and laughter.&quot;

For his lifelong commitment to pacifist values and for serving as a spokesperson for the peace movement, Dellinger was awarded the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience award on September 26, 1992.

In 1996, during the first Democratic convention held in Chicago since 1968, Dellinger and his grandson were arrested along with nine others, including Civil Rights Movement historian Randy Kryn, Bradford Lyttle, and Abbie Hoffman&#x27;s son Andrew, during a sit-in at Chicago&#x27;s Federal Building.

In 2001, Dellinger led a group of young activists from Montpelier, Vermont, to Quebec City to protest a conference that planned to create a free trade zone.

== Death ==
Dellinger died in Montpelier, Vermont, in 2004 after an extensive stay at Heaton Woods Nursing Home. He suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease for years before his death.

<doc id="305956" wikidata="Q3774256" url="?curid=305956" title="Porphyritic">
<text>Porphyritic is an adjective used in geology to describe igneous rocks with a distinct difference in the size of mineral crystals, with the larger crystals known as phenocrysts. Both extrusive and intrusive rocks can be porphyritic, meaning all types of igneous rocks can display some degree of porphyritic texture. Most porphyritic rocks have bimodal size ranges, meaning the rock is composed of two distinct sizes of crystal.

In extrusive rocks, the phenocrysts are surrounded by a fine-grained (aphanitic) matrix or groundmass of volcanic glass or non-visible crystals, commonly seen in porphyritic basalt. Porphyritic intrusive rocks have a matrix with individual crystals easily distinguished with the eye, but one group of crystals appearing clearly much bigger than the rest, as in a porphyritic granite.

The term comes from the Ancient Greek (), meaning &quot;purple&quot;. Purple was the color of royalty, and the &quot;imperial porphyry&quot; was a deep purple igneous rock with large crystals of plagioclase, prized for monuments and building projects due to its hardness. Subsequently, the name was adapted to describe any igneous rocks with a similar texture.

== Formation ==
Porphyritic rocks are a product of igneous differentiation, and are generally formed when a column of rising magma is cooled in two stages: In the first stage, the magma is cooled slowly deep in the crust, creating the large crystal grains, with a diameter of 2mm or more. In the final stage, the magma is cooled rapidly at relatively shallow depth or as it erupts from a volcano, creating small grains that are usually invisible to the unaided eye, typically referred to as the matrix or groundmass.

The formation of large phenocrysts is due to fractional crystallization. As the melt cools, it begins crystallizing the highest melting point minerals closest to the overall composition first. This forms large, well-shaped euhedral phenocrysts. If these phenocrysts are different in density to the remaining melt, they usually settle out of solution, eventually creating cumulates. However, when this is interrupted by sudden eruption of the melt as lava, or when the density of the crystals and remaining melt remains similar, they become entrapped in the final rock.

This can also occur when the chemical composition of the remaining melt is close to the eutectic point as it cools, resulting in multiple different minerals solidifying at once and filling the remaining space simultaneously, limiting their size and shape.

<text>The International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers (IANTD) is a scuba diving organization concerned with certification and training in recreational diving, technical diving, cave diving, wreck diving, rebreather diving and diver leadership. Originally formed as the International Association of Nitrox Divers in 1985 by Dick Rutkowski it pioneered the introduction of Enriched Air Nitrox diving to the recreational diving community, before its name change in 1992 to reflect the more &quot;technical&quot; diving courses it had begun to teach. The European Association of Technical Divers (EATD) became part of IANTD in 1993.

== History ==
Dick Rutkowski, the former dive supervisor for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), formed the International Association of Nitrox Divers (IAND) in 1985 to teach nitrox to recreational divers. This program was developed through NOAA during his tenure. In 1992 Tom Mount became the President and CEO, and the name of the organization was changed to the International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers (IANTD). Billy Deans has also served as a director of IANTD. Prior to founding IAND, Rutkowski worked for Dr Wells and was director of the diver training at NOAA. 

As the first agency to offer recreational certification in nitrox, IANTD grew at a steady pace from 1985 through February 1992 with the support of Hyperbarics International. The European Association of Technical Divers (EATD) was formed by Kevin Gurr, Richard Bull, and Rob Palmer in the UK in 1992 and merged into IANTD the following year. In 1992 Tom Mount became President of IANTD, a position that he held until 2005. During this period of time IANTD saw rapid growth as the diving community began to accept the use of technology such as nitrox. In 1992 the National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI) became the first mainstream US agency to accept IANTD qualifications, and the Sub-Aqua Association (SAA) became the first UK agency to recognise IANTD certifications in 1993.

In 2000, IANTD introduced a free-diver program prepared by Divetech Ltd of Grand Cayman.

On January 7, 2016 IANTD becomes the first agency in the scuba industry to acknowledge digitally validated logs as an official proof of diving experience, furthermore it declares Diviac its official digital logbook.

In March 2018, IANTD joined the United States RSTC and renewed its ISO certification .

<doc id="305961" wikidata="Q1375984" url="?curid=305961" title="Henry Ernest Atkins">
<text>Henry Ernest Atkins (20 August 1872 – 31 January 1955) was a British chess master who is best known for his unparalleled record of winning the British Chess Championship nine times in eleven attempts. He won every year from 1905 to 1911, and again in 1924 and 1925. A schoolmaster, Atkins treated chess as a hobby, devoting relatively little time to it and playing in only a handful of international tournaments. He was an extremely gifted player who would likely have become one of the world&#x27;s leading players had he pursued the game more single-mindedly. FIDE, the World Chess Federation, awarded him the International Master title in 1950 in recognition of his past achievements.

==Non-chess life==
Born in Leicester, Atkins was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys. In 1890, he went to Peterhouse, Cambridge, as a mathematical scholar. He was a mathematical master at Northampton College from 1898 to 1902 and at the Wyggeston School from 1902 to 1909. He was then appointed principal of what later became Huddersfield New College in 1909, serving in that position until 1936.

Atkins died on 31 January 1955 in Huddersfield, England.

==Chess career==

Atkins is considered by many to be Britain&#x27;s most talented player ever. A schoolmaster who played chess only in his spare time, he nonetheless became one of the strongest amateur players. He made a deep study of the games of Wilhelm Steinitz, and modeled his play so closely on Steinitz&#x27;s that he became known on the European continent as &quot;der kleine Steinitz&quot; (&quot;the little Steinitz&quot;).

Atkins learned chess from one of his brothers, and joined the Wyggeston School Chess Club at age 10. One of his sisters gave him a copy of Howard Staunton&#x27;s treatise &quot;The Chess-Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, which he closely studied. At the age of 15, he joined the Leicester Chess Club and within two years was playing on the first board. While in college, he also played on first board for Cambridge University. In four years playing for Cambridge he only lost one match game.

Between 1895 and 1901, Atkins played in seven minor tournaments, winning four and finishing second or equal second in the others, and losing just 3 out of 70 games. These included the minor tournament at the great Hastings 1895 tournament, where he finished equal second, behind Géza Maróczy, and was awarded the Newnes Cup for the best result by a British amateur. At Bristol 1896, he yielded just one draw in nine games. At Southampton 1897, the Eighth British Amateur Championship, he scored an undefeated 8.5 points out of 10 possible, retaining his British amateur title. At Craigside 1899, he scored 7.5/10, behind Amos Burn (9/10). At Amsterdam 1899, an amateur tournament that was Atkins&#x27; first international appearance, he achieved a rare perfect score, winning all 15 games and finishing 4 points ahead of the second-place finisher. He scored 4/6, again finishing behind Burn (5/6), at Birmingham 1899. At Bath 1900, he scored 12.5/14, yielding just 3 draws in 14 games. At Llandudno 1901, a four-man double-round robin, Atkins was again bested by Burn, who scored 4.5/6 to Atkins&#x27; 3.5 points. Between 1896 and 1911, Atkins participated in the annual 10-board cable match between Britain and the United States every year except 1909.

Atkins&#x27; best-ever result came at his first major international tournament, Hanover 1902. He finished third with 11.5/17 (8 wins, 7 draws and just 2 losses), behind David Janowski (13.5 points) and Harry Nelson Pillsbury (12 points), but ahead of Mikhail Chigorin and Frank Marshall, among others. Chessmetrics ranks Pillsbury number 2 in the world at the time; Chigorin had played matches for the World Chess Championship in 1889 and 1892, and Marshall and Janowski would go on to do so in 1907 and 1910, respectively. Although Atkins could at this point have considered making chess his career, he did not, and indeed played in no international tournaments for the next 20 years because &quot;he &#x27;never found it possible again to play&#x27;&quot;.

His record in the British Chess Championship is without parallel. Atkins played eleven times, winning in all but his first and last attempts. He first played at Hastings 1904, the first Championship organized by the newly formed British Chess Federation. He tied for first with William Ewart Napier, each scoring 8.5/11. However, Atkins lost the playoff (3 draws, 1 loss) and was thus relegated to second place. Remarkably, this was to be Atkins&#x27; worst result in the Championship for a third of a century. He proceeded to win the next seven Championships: Southport 1905 and Shrewsbury 1906, again scoring 8.5/11 each time; Crystal Palace 1907 (7.5/11); Tunbridge Wells 1908 (8/11); Scarborough 1909, where he tied for first with Joseph Henry Blake, each scoring 8.5/11, but won the playoff with 2.5/3; Oxford 1910 (8.5/11); and Glasgow 1911, tying for first with Frederick Yates at 8.5/11, and winning all three games in the playoff. Coles writes, &quot;His success in these years was all the more striking because of his lack of other first-class practice, which not infrequently caused him to get away to a bad start; yet such was his natural ability and determination that he invariably overhauled the field before the end as confidence and skill returned.&quot; Atkins wrote the introduction to the first edition of &quot;Modern Chess Openings&quot; (1911).

After the 1911 Championship, Atkins retired completely from tournament chess for the next 11 years. He later remarked, &quot;I really can&#x27;t say why I didn&#x27;t play after 1911 for so many years.&quot; He had agreed to play in the 1919 Hastings Victory Congress, but withdrew at the last moment &quot;by doctor&#x27;s orders&quot;. In 1922, a major international tournament was organized in London, the first in almost a quarter of a century; many of the world&#x27;s leading players agreed to compete, such as newly crowned World Champion José Raúl Capablanca, Alexander Alekhine, and Akiba Rubinstein. Despite his long layoff from the game, Atkins was also invited, and agreed to play. After such a long hiatus, he unsurprisingly had a disappointing tournament, scoring only 6/15 and finishing 10th out of 16 players. He finished just outside the prize list, for the first and only time in his career. However, did have the consolation of claiming among his victims Rubinstein and Savielly Tartakower.

His appetite for competition having been stirred, he returned to the British Championship, playing at Southport in 1924. This time he showed his old form, winning his eighth championship with his usual score of 8.5/11. The following year, he exceeded himself, winning at Stratford-on-Avon with his best-ever score of 9.5/11 (8 wins, 3 draws). His final Championship appearance was in 1937, when he tied for third at the age of 65.

Atkins also represented England at the Chess Olympiads of 1927 and 1935. Playing first board for England in the London 1927 Olympiad, he scored 3 wins, 8 draws, and 1 loss (58.4%), leading the English team to what author Árpád Földeák calls an &quot;unexpected but well deserved&quot; third-place finish. England did not place this high again until Haifa 1976. At age 63, he played fourth board for England at the Warsaw 1935 Olympiad, scoring 3 wins, 6 draws, and 4 losses (46.2%).

G. H. Diggle recollected of Atkins:
... we well remember his giving a &quot;simultaneous&quot; at the Lincoln Chess Club in 1924, winning 17 and drawing two. One of his more elderly opponents (a notorious non-resigner) who for 30 moves had been wobbling along with a piece down until &quot;time&quot; had to be called, then proceeded to &quot;demonstrate a draw&quot; by concocting a continuation so optimistic that even clubmates with lifelong experience of his powers stood aghast. Atkins, with his greatcoat on ready to go home, made no attempt to refute this analytical masterpiece but merely remarked with great deference: &quot;I don&#x27;t think we can play it quite like that!&quot; and then beat a craven retreat &quot;escorted by Club Officials&quot;.

An unobtrusive man, we last saw him as a spectator at &quot;Nottingham, 1936&quot; wandering about as if he was nobody.

==Contribution to chess theory==

Atkins originated an important defensive strategy in the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined: an early ...Ne4 by Black in order to exchange off a pair of minor pieces and ease the pressure on Black&#x27;s position. He played it successfully against Marshall in a 1902 cable match between England and the United States, the game beginning 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7 5.Nf3 Nbd7 6.e3 Ne4. (See &quot;Notable games&quot; section below.) Today, the ...Ne4 maneuver is generally referred to as the &quot;Lasker Variation&quot;, after Emanuel Lasker, who later adopted it, but is also sometimes referred to as the &quot;Atkins Variation&quot;. Today, Black usually employs a different move order, such as 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7 5.e3 0-0 6.Nf3 and now either 6...h6 7.Bh4 Ne4, or immediately 6...Ne4.

==Playing strength==

In 1950, FIDE, in its first award of international titles, awarded Atkins the International Master title in recognition of his past achievements. By Arpad Elo&#x27;s calculation, Atkins&#x27; strength during his five-year peak was equivalent to an Elo rating of 2540.

World Champion Emanuel Lasker believed that if Atkins had devoted more time to chess, he would have become one of the world&#x27;s leading players. Sir George Thomas, one of Britain&#x27;s leading players in the first half of the 20th century, observed, &quot;H. E. Atkins ranks, indisputably, as the greatest figure in English chess since Amos Burn, and only lack of opportunity prevented him, in my opinion, from definitely establishing his position in the world championship class.&quot; Anne Sunnucks writes that, &quot;His devotion to teaching and his insistence on treating chess as merely a game was all that prevented him from becoming one of the leading players of the world.&quot;

== Notable games ==


Atkins (Black) won the following game at London 1922 against Savielly Tartakower (White), then one of the world&#x27;s leading players. Tartakower thought highly enough of the game to include it in his book &quot;500 Master Games of Chess&quot;.&lt;br&gt;1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Nc3 Nxe4 5.Nxe4 d5 6.Bd3 dxe4 7.Bxe4 Bd6 8.d4 Nxd4 9.Nxd4 exd4 10.Qxd4 O-O 11.Be3 Qe7 12.O-O-O Re8 13.Bd5? This allows Black to gain time for his queen-side pawn storm with ...c6. Correct was 13.Bf3. Be5 14.Qa4 c6 15.Bf3 Be6 16.Kb1 a5! With the surprising threat of 17...Qb4! 18.Qxb4 axb4 19.b3 Rxa2! and wins. 17.Bd4 Bd6 18.Bb6? Bb4 Threatening to drive away the bishop with ...Ra6, followed by ...b5 winning the queen. 19.c3 Ra6! Now if 20.cxb4, axb4 is devastating. 20.Be3 Bf5+ 21.Ka1 b5 22.Qb3 Bd6 23.a4? Instead of weakening his queen-side with this move, White should have played 23. Rd2. Rb8 24.Rd2 Be6 25.Qd1 Be5 26.Bd4 Bf4 27.Be3 Bxe3 28.fxe3 b4! 29.cxb4 Rab6! Tartakower and du Mont remark, &quot;Black conducts the game with superb &quot;élan&quot;.&quot; Weak would have been 29...Rxb4?? 30.Rd8+; 29...Qxb4? 30.Rd8+; or 29...axb4 30.b3, keeping the queen-side closed. 30.Rd6 Black&#x27;s attack has become overwhelming. If 30.bxa5, Rxb2! wins. Or 30.Rd4 Rxb4 31.Rxb4 Qxb4 32.Qc2 Bb3 33.Qxc6 Bc4 34.Rb1 Bd3 and wins. Rxb4 31.Bxc6 Rxb2 Threatening 31...Ra2#. If 32.Rxe6, Qa3#! 32.Bb5 Ra2+ 33.Kb1 Rxa4! 34.Kc2 White tries to escape; if instead 34.Qxa4 Qxd6, White will lose the bishop on b5. Ra2+ 35.Kc3 Rc8+ 36.Bc6 Rxc6+! Tartakower and du Mont observe, &quot;This curious &quot;break-through sacrifice&quot; is the crowning touch to a powerfully conducted game.&quot; 37.Rxc6 Qb4+ 38.Kd3 Qb5+ 39.Kd4 Qxc6 40.Ke5 Qc5+ 41.Kf4 Qf5+ 42.Kg3 Qf2# Oddly, White&#x27;s king rook never moved.

Here, using his novel ...Ne4 maneuver in the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined, Atkins routs the young American star Frank Marshall:&lt;br&gt;

<doc id="305966" wikidata="Q1866303" url="?curid=305966" title="Arabic grammar">
<text>Arabic grammar () is the grammar of the Arabic language. Arabic is a Semitic language and its grammar has many similarities with the grammar of other Semitic languages. Classical Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic have largely the same grammar; colloquial spoken varieties of Arabic can vary in different ways.

The largest differences between classical and colloquial Arabic are the loss of morphological markings of grammatical case; changes in word order, an overall shift towards a more analytic morphosyntax, the loss of the previous system of grammatical mood, along with the evolution of a new system; the loss of the inflected passive voice, except in a few relict varieties; restriction in the use of the dual number and (for most varieties) the loss of the feminine plural. Many Arabic dialects, Maghrebi Arabic in particular, also have significant vowel shifts and unusual consonant clusters. Unlike in other dialects, first person singular verbs in Maghrebi Arabic begin with a n- (ن). This phenomenon can also be found in the Maltese language, which itself emerged from Sicilian Arabic.

==History==
The identity of the oldest Arabic grammarian is disputed; some sources state that it was Abu al-Aswad al-Du&#x27;ali, who established diacritical marks and vowels for Arabic in the mid-600s, Others have said that the earliest grammarian would have been Ibn Abi Ishaq (died AD 735/6, AH 117).

The schools of Basra and Kufa further developed grammatical rules in the late 8th century with the rapid rise of Islam, using Quran as the main source for Arabic grammar rules. From the school of Basra, generally regarded as being founded by Abu Amr ibn al-Ala, two representatives laid important foundations for the field: Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi authored the first Arabic dictionary and book of Arabic prosody, and his student Sibawayh authored the first book on theories of Arabic grammar. From the school of Kufa, Al-Ru&#x27;asi is universally acknowledged as the founder, though his own writings are considered lost, with most of the school&#x27;s development undertaken by later authors. The efforts of al-Farahidi and Sibawayh consolidated Basra&#x27;s reputation as the analytic school of grammar, while the Kufan school was regarded as the guardian of Arabic poetry and Arab culture. The differences were polarizing in some cases, with early Muslim scholar Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi favoring the Kufan school due to its concern with poetry as a primary source.

Early Arabic grammars were more or less lists of rules, without the detailed explanations which would be added in later centuries. The earliest schools were different not only in some of their views on grammatical disputes, but also their emphasis. The school of Kufa excelled in Arabic poetry and exegesis of the Qur&#x27;an, in addition to Islamic law and Arab genealogy. The more rationalist school of Basra, on the other hand, focused more on the formal study of grammar.

==Division==
For classical Arabic grammarians, the grammatical sciences are divided into five branches:

*&quot; (language/lexicon) concerned with collecting and explaining vocabulary.
*&quot; (morphology) determining the form of the individual words.
*&quot;&quot; (syntax) primarily concerned with inflection (&quot;&quot;).
*&quot; (derivation) examining the origin of the words.
*&quot; (rhetoric) which elucidates stylistic quality, or eloquence.

The grammar or grammars of contemporary varieties of Arabic are a different question. Said M. Badawi, an expert on Arabic grammar, divides Arabic grammar in Egypt into five different types based on the speaker&#x27;s level of literacy and the degree to which the speaker deviates from Classical Arabic: Illiterate Spoken Arabic ( ), Semi-literate Spoken Arabic ( ), Educated Spoken Arabic ( ), Modern Standard Arabic ( ), and Classical Arabic ( ).

==Phonology==

Classical Arabic has 28 consonantal phonemes, including two semi-vowels, which constitute the Arabic alphabet.

It also has six vowel phonemes (three short vowels and three long vowels). These appear as various allophones, depending on the preceding consonant. Short vowels are not usually represented in the written language, although they may be indicated with diacritics.

Word stress varies from one Arabic dialect to another. A rough rule for word-stress in Classical Arabic is that it falls on the penultimate syllable of a word if that syllable is closed, and otherwise on the antepenultimate.

&#x27; (), elidable &quot;hamza&quot;, is a phonetic object prefixed to the beginning of a word for ease of pronunciation, since Literary Arabic doesn&#x27;t allow consonant clusters at the beginning of a word. Elidable &quot;hamza&quot; drops out as a vowel, if a word is preceding it. This word will then produce an ending vowel, &quot;helping vowel&quot; to facilitate pronunciation. This short vowel may be, depending on the preceding vowel, a &#x27; (:  ), pronounced as ; a &#x27; (:  ), pronounced as ; or a &#x27; (:  ), pronounced as . If the preceding word ends in a &#x27; (), meaning that it is not followed by a short vowel, the &#x27; assumes a &#x27; . The symbol ( &#x27;) indicates gemination or consonant doubling. See more in Tashkīl.

==Nouns and adjectives==

In Classical Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), nouns and adjectives ( &quot;&quot;) are declined, according to case (&quot;&quot;), state (definiteness), gender and number. In colloquial or spoken Arabic, there are a number of simplifications such as the loss of certain final vowels and the loss of case. A number of derivational processes exist for forming new nouns and adjectives. Adverbs can be formed from adjectives.

==Pronouns==

=== Personal pronouns ===
In Arabic, personal pronouns have 12 forms. In singular and plural, the 2nd and 3rd persons have separate masculine and feminine forms, while the 1st person does not. In the dual, there is no 1st person, and only a single form for each 2nd and 3rd person. Traditionally, the pronouns are listed in the order 3rd, 2nd, 1st.

Informal Arabic tends to avoid the dual forms &#x27; and &#x27; . The feminine plural forms &#x27; and &#x27; are likewise avoided, except by speakers of conservative colloquial varieties that still possess separate feminine plural pronouns.

==== Enclitic pronouns ====
The enclitic forms of personal pronouns ( &quot;&quot;) are used both as accusative and genitive forms of the pronouns. As genitive forms they appear in the following contexts:

* After the construct state of nouns, where they have the meaning of possessive determiners, e.g. &quot;my, your, his&quot;
* After prepositions, where they have the meaning of objects of the prepositions, e.g. &quot;to me, to you, to him&quot;

As accusative forms they appear:

* Attached to verbs, where they have the meaning of direct object pronouns, e.g. &quot;me, you, him&quot;
* Attached to conjunctions and particles like &#x27; &quot;that ...&quot;, &#x27; &quot;because ...&quot;, &#x27; &quot;but ...&quot;, &#x27; (topicalizing particle), where they have the meaning of subject pronouns, e.g. &quot;because I ...&quot;, &quot;because you ...&quot;, &quot;because he ...&quot;. (These particles are known in Arabic as &#x27; ( &quot;sisters of &#x27;&quot;.)

Only the first person singular makes a distinction between the genitive and accusative function. As a possessive it takes the form &quot;-ī&quot; while as an object form it has the form &quot;-nī&quot; (e.g. ( &quot;&quot; &quot;you saw me&quot;).

Most of the enclitic forms are clearly related to the full personal pronouns.

===== Variant forms =====
For all but the first person singular, the same forms are used regardless of the part of speech of the word attached to. In the third person masculine singular, &#x27; occurs after the vowels &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; (&#x27;), while &#x27; occurs after &quot;i&quot; or &quot;y&quot; (&#x27;). The same alternation occurs in the third person dual and plural.

In the first person singular, however, the situation is more complicated. Specifically, &#x27; &quot;me&quot; is attached to verbs, but &#x27; &quot;my&quot; is attached to nouns. In the latter case, &#x27; is attached to nouns whose construct state ends in a long vowel or diphthong (e.g. in the sound masculine plural and the dual), while &#x27; is attached to nouns whose construct state ends in a short vowel, in which case that vowel is elided (e.g. in the sound feminine plural, as well as the singular and broken plural of most nouns). Furthermore, &#x27; of the masculine sound plural is assimilated to &#x27; before &#x27; (presumably, &#x27; of masculine defective &quot;-an&quot; plurals is similarly assimilated to &quot;&quot;). Examples:
* From &#x27; &quot;book&quot;, pl &#x27; (most of nouns in general).

* From &quot;&quot; &quot;word&quot; (nouns ending on ), pl or .

* From &#x27; &quot;world&quot;; &#x27; &quot;hospital&quot; (nouns ending on ).

* From nom. dual &#x27; &quot;teachers&quot;, acc./gen. dual &#x27; (dual nouns)

* From nom. pl. &#x27; &quot;teachers&quot;, acc./gen. pl. &#x27; (regular plural nouns)

* From pl. &quot;&quot; &quot;chosen&quot; (regular plural nouns)

* From &quot;&quot; &quot;judge&quot; (active participle nouns ending on as nominative)

* From &#x27; &quot;father&quot;, long construct form &#x27; (long construct nouns)

* From any nouns ending on &#x27;, &#x27; or &quot; (more commonly loanwords).

* From any nouns ending on &quot; (more commonly loanwords).

Prepositions use &#x27;, even though in this case it has the meaning of &quot;me&quot; (rather than &quot;my&quot;). The &quot;sisters of &#x27;&quot; can use either form (e.g. &#x27; or &#x27;), but the longer form (e.g. &quot;) is usually preferred.

The second-person masculine plural past tense verb ending &#x27; changes to the variant form &#x27; before enclitic pronouns, e.g. &quot; &quot;you (masc. pl.) wrote it (masc.)&quot;.

===== Pronouns with prepositions =====
Some very common prepositions — including the proclitic preposition &quot;&quot; &quot;to&quot; (also used for indirect objects) — have irregular or unpredictable combining forms when the enclitic pronouns are added to them:
In the above cases, when there are two combining forms, one is used with &quot;... me&quot; and the other with all other person/number/gender combinations. (More correctly, one occurs before vowel-initial pronouns and the other before consonant-initial pronouns, but in Classical Arabic, only &quot;&quot; is vowel-initial. This becomes clearer in the spoken varieties, where various vowel-initial enclitic pronouns exist.)

Note in particular:
* &#x27; &quot;to&quot; and &#x27; &quot;on&quot; have irregular combining forms &#x27;, &#x27;; but other pronouns with the same base form are regular, e.g. &quot;&quot; &quot;with&quot;.
* &#x27; &quot;to&quot; has an irregular combining form &#x27;, but &quot;&quot; &quot;in, with, by&quot; is regular.
* &#x27; &quot;from&quot; and &#x27; &quot;on&quot; double the final &quot;n&quot; before &quot;&quot;.

===== Less formal pronominal forms =====
In a less formal Arabic, as in many spoken dialects, the endings &quot;-ka, -ki, and -hu&quot; and many others have their final short vowel dropped, for example, كِتابُكَ &quot;kitābuka&quot; would become كِتابُك &quot;kitābuk&quot; for ease of pronunciation. This doesn&#x27;t make a difference to the spelling as the diacritics used to represent short vowels are not usually written.

===Demonstratives===
There are two demonstratives ( &quot;&quot;), near-deictic (&#x27;this&#x27;) and far-deictic (&#x27;that&#x27;):

The dual forms are only used in very formal Arabic.

Some of the demonstratives (&#x27;, and &#x27;) should be pronounced with a long &#x27;, although the unvocalised script is not written with alif (). Instead of an alif, they have the diacritic (dagger alif: &#x27;), which doesn&#x27;t exist on Arabic keyboards and is seldom written, even in vocalised Arabic.

Qur&#x27;anic Arabic has another demonstrative, normally followed by a noun in a genitive construct and meaning &#x27;owner of&#x27;:
Note that the demonstrative and relative pronouns were originally built on this word. &#x27;, for example, was originally composed from the prefix &#x27; &#x27;this&#x27; and the masculine accusative singular &#x27;; similarly, &#x27; was composed from &#x27;, an infixed syllable &#x27;, and the clitic suffix &#x27; &#x27;you&#x27;. These combinations had not yet become completely fixed in Qur&#x27;anic Arabic and other combinations sometimes occurred, e.g. &#x27;, &#x27;. Similarly, the relative pronoun &#x27; was originally composed based on the genitive singular &#x27;, and the old Arabic grammarians noted the existence of a separate nominative plural form &#x27; in the speech of the Hudhayl tribe in Qur&#x27;anic times.

This word also shows up in Hebrew, e.g. masculine &quot;zeh&quot; (cf. &#x27;), feminine &quot;zot&quot; (cf. &#x27;), plural &quot;eleh&quot; (cf. &quot;&quot;).

===Relative pronoun===
The relative pronoun is declined as follows:

Note that the relative pronoun agrees in gender, number and case, with the noun it modifies—as opposed to the situation in other inflected languages such as Latin and German, where the gender and number agreement is with the modified noun, but the case marking follows the usage of the relative pronoun in the embedded clause (as in formal English &quot;the man who saw me&quot; vs. &quot;the man whom I saw&quot;).

When the relative pronoun serves a function other than the subject of the embedded clause, a resumptive pronoun is required: &quot;&quot;, literally &quot;the man who I spoke with him&quot;.

The relative pronoun is normally omitted entirely when an indefinite noun is modified by a relative clause: &quot;&quot; &quot;a man that I spoke with&quot;, literally &quot;a man I spoke with him&quot;.

===Colloquial varieties===
The above system is mostly unchanged in the colloquial varieties, other than the loss of the dual forms and (for most varieties) of the feminine plural. Some of the more notable changes:
*The third-person &#x27; variants disappear. On the other hand, the first person &#x27; variation is preserved exactly (including the different circumstances in which these variants are used), and new variants appear for many forms. For example, in Egyptian Arabic, the second person feminine singular appears either as &#x27; or &#x27; depending on various factors (e.g. the phonology of the preceding word); likewise, the third person masculine singular appears variously as &#x27;, &#x27;, or &quot;&quot; (no ending, but stress is moved onto the preceding vowel, which is lengthened).
*In many varieties, the indirect object forms, which appear in Classical Arabic as separate words (e.g. &#x27; &quot;to me&quot;, &#x27; &#x27;to him&#x27;), become fused onto the verb, following a direct object. These same varieties generally develop a circumfix for negation (from Classical &quot; &#x27;not ... a thing&#x27;, composed of two separate words). This can lead to complicated agglutinative constructs, such as Egyptian Arabic &#x27;he didn&#x27;t write it (fem.) to me&#x27;. (Egyptian Arabic in particular has many variant pronominal affixes used in different circumstances, and very intricate morphophonemic rules leading to a large number of complex alternations, depending on the particular affixes involved, the way they are put together, and whether the preceding verb ends in a vowel, a single consonant, or two consonants.)
*Other varieties instead use a separate Classical pseudo-pronoun &quot; for direct objects (but in Hijazi Arabic the resulting construct fuses with a preceding verb).
*Affixation of dual and sound plural nouns has largely vanished. Instead, all varieties possess a separate preposition with the meaning of &quot;of&quot;, which replaces certain uses of the construct genitive (to varying degrees, depending on the particular variety). In Moroccan Arabic, the word is &quot;dyal&quot; (also &quot;d-&quot; before a noun), e.g. &quot;l-kitab dyal-i&quot; &quot;my book&quot;, since the construct-state genitive is mostly unproductive. Egyptian Arabic has &quot;bitā‘ &quot;, which agrees in gender and number with the preceding noun (feminine &quot;bitā‘it/bita‘t&quot;, plural &quot;bitū‘ &quot;). In Egyptian Arabic, the construct-state genitive is still productive, hence either &quot;kitāb-i&quot; or &quot;il-kitāb bitā‘-i&quot; can be used for &quot;my book&quot; [the difference between them is similar to the difference between &#x27;my book&#x27; and &#x27;the book is mine&#x27;], but only &quot;il-mu‘allimūn bitū‘-i&quot; &quot;my teachers&quot;.
*The declined relative pronoun has vanished. In its place is an indeclinable particle, usually &quot;illi&quot; or similar.
*Various forms of the demonstrative pronouns occur, usually shorter than the Classical forms. For example, Moroccan Arabic uses &quot;ha l-&quot; &quot;this&quot;, &quot;dak l-/dik l-/duk l-&quot; &quot;that&quot; (masculine/feminine/plural). Egyptian Arabic is unusual in that the demonstrative follows the noun, e.g. &quot;il-kitāb da&quot; &quot;this book&quot;, &quot;il-binti di&quot; &quot;this girl&quot;.
*Some of the independent pronouns have slightly different forms compared with their Classical forms. For example, usually forms similar to &quot;inta, inti&quot; &quot;you (masc./fem. sg.)&quot; occur in place of &#x27;, and &quot;(n)iḥna&quot; &quot;we&quot; occurs in place of &#x27;.

==Numerals==

=== Cardinal numerals ===
Numbers behave in a very complicated fashion. &#x27; &quot;one&quot; and &#x27; &quot;two&quot; are adjectives, following the noun and agreeing with it. &#x27; &quot;three&quot; through &#x27; &quot;ten&quot; require a following noun in the genitive plural, but disagree with the noun in gender, while taking the case required by the surrounding syntax. &#x27; &quot;eleven&quot; through &#x27; &quot;nineteen&quot; require a following noun in the accusative singular, agree with the noun in gender, and are invariable for case, except for &quot;&quot; &quot;twelve&quot;.

The formal system of cardinal numerals, as used in Classical Arabic, is extremely complex. The system of rules is presented below. In reality, however, this system is never used: Large numbers are always written as numerals rather than spelled out, and are pronounced using a simplified system, even in formal contexts.

Example:
: Formal: &quot;&quot; &quot;2,912 years&quot;
: Spoken: &quot;&quot; &quot;2,912 years&quot;
: Formal: &quot;&quot; &quot;after 2,912 years&quot;
: Spoken: &quot;&quot; &quot;after 2,912 years&quot;

Cardinal numerals ( &quot;&quot;) from 0–10. Zero is &quot;ṣifr&quot;, from which the words &quot;cipher&quot; and &quot;zero&quot; are ultimately derived.
* 0 &quot; ()
* 1 &quot; ()
* 2 &quot; ()
* 3 &quot; ()
* 4 &quot; ()
* 5 &quot; ()
* 6 &quot; ()
* 7 &quot; ()
* 8 &quot; ()
* 9 &quot; ()
* 10 &#x27; () (feminine form &#x27; )

It is very common, even by news announcers and in official speeches, to pronounce numerals in local dialects.

The endings in brackets are dropped in less formal Arabic and in pausa. () is pronounced as simple in these cases. If a noun ending in is the first member of an idafa, the is pronounced as , while the rest of the ending is not pronounced.

 &#x27; is changed to &#x27; in oblique cases. This form is also commonly used in a less formal Arabic in the nominative case.

The numerals 1 and 2 are adjectives. Thus they follow the noun and agree with gender.

Numerals 3–10 have a peculiar rule of agreement known as polarity: A feminine referrer agrees with a numeral in masculine gender and vice versa, e.g. &quot;&quot; () &quot;three girls&quot;. The noun counted takes indefinite genitive plural (as the attribute in a genitive construct).

Numerals 11 and 13–19 are indeclinable for case, perpetually in the accusative. The form is always that of the construct state, whether preceded by a definite article or not: &quot;twelve nights&quot;, &quot;the twelve nights&quot;. Numbers 11 and 12 show gender agreement in the ones, and 13–19 show polarity in the ones. Number 12 also shows case agreement in the units. The gender of in numbers 11–19 agrees with the counted noun (unlike the standalone numeral 10 which shows polarity). The counted noun takes indefinite accusative singular.
Unitary numbers from 20 on (i.e. 20, 30, ... 90, 100, 1000, 1000000, etc.) behave entirely as nouns, showing the case required by the surrounding syntax, no gender agreement, and a following noun in a fixed case. 20 through 90 require their noun to be in the accusative singular; 100 and up require the genitive singular. The unitary numbers themselves decline in various fashions:
* &#x27; &quot;20&quot; through &#x27; &quot;90&quot; decline as masculine plural nouns
* &quot;&quot; &quot;100&quot; ( or ) declines as a feminine singular noun
* &quot;&quot; &quot;1,000&quot; () declines as a masculine singular noun

The numbers 20–99 are expressed with the units preceding the tens. Both parts decline like independent nouns, taking the &quot;tanwīn&quot; in the indefinite state. There is agreement in gender with the numerals 1 and 2, and polarity for numerals 3–9. The whole construct is followed by the accusative singular indefinite.
* 20 &quot; () (plural of 10)
* 21 &quot; ()
* 22 &quot; ()
* 23 &quot; ()
* 30 &quot; ()
* 40 &quot; ()

&#x27; &quot;100&quot; and &#x27; &quot;1,000&quot; can themselves be modified by numbers (to form numbers such as 200 or 5,000) and will be declined appropriately. For example, &#x27; &quot;200&quot; and &#x27; &quot;2,000&quot; with dual endings; &#x27; &quot;3,000&quot; with &#x27; in the plural genitive, but &#x27; &quot;300&quot; since &#x27; appears to have no plural.

In compound numbers, the number formed with the last two digits dictates the declension of the associated noun, e.g. 212, 312, and 54,312 would all behave like 12.

Large compound numbers can have, e.g.:

* &quot;&quot; &quot;1,909 years&quot;
* &quot;&quot; &quot;after 1,909 years&quot;
* &quot;&quot; &quot;94,863 years&quot;
* &quot;&quot; &quot;after 94,863 years&quot;
* &quot;&quot; &quot;12,222 years&quot;
* &quot;&quot; &quot;after 12,222 years&quot;
* &quot;&quot; &quot;12,202 years&quot;
* &quot;&quot; &quot;after 12,202 years&quot;

Note also the special construction when the final number is 1 or 2:
* &quot;&quot; &quot;1,001 nights&quot;
* &quot;&quot; &quot;102 books&quot;

===Fractions===
Fractions of a whole smaller than &quot;half&quot; are expressed by the structure &#x27; () in the singular, &#x27; () in the plural.
* half &quot; ()
* one-third &quot; ()
* two-thirds &quot; ()
* one-quarter &quot; ()
* three-quarters &quot;&quot; ()
* etc.

===Ordinal numerals===
Ordinal numerals ( &#x27;) higher than &quot;second&quot; are formed using the structure &#x27;, &quot;&quot;, the same as active participles of Form I verbs:
*m. &#x27;, f. &#x27; &quot;first&quot;
*m. &#x27; (definite form: &#x27;), f. &quot;&quot; &quot;second&quot;
*m. &#x27;, f. &#x27; &quot;third&quot;
*m. &#x27;, f. &#x27; &quot;fourth&quot;
*m. &#x27;, f. &#x27; &quot;fifth&quot;
*m. &#x27;, f. &#x27; &quot;sixth&quot;
*m. &#x27;, f. &#x27; &quot;seventh&quot;
*m. &#x27;, f. &#x27; &quot;eighth&quot;
*m. &#x27;, f. &#x27; &quot;ninth&quot;
*m. &#x27;, f. &#x27; &quot;tenth&quot;

They are adjectives, hence there is agreement in gender with the noun, not polarity as with the cardinal numbers. Note that &quot;sixth&quot; uses a different, older root than the number six.

==Verbs==
Verbs in Arabic ( &quot;fi‘l&quot;) are based on a root made up of three or four consonants (called a triliteral or quadriliteral root, respectively). The set of consonants communicates the basic meaning of a verb, e.g. k-t-b &#x27;write&#x27;, q-r-’ &#x27;read&#x27;, ’-k-l &#x27;eat&#x27;. Changes to the vowels in between the consonants, along with prefixes or suffixes, specify grammatical functions such as tense, person and number, in addition to changes in the meaning of the verb that embody grammatical concepts such as mood (e.g. indicative, subjunctive, imperative), voice (active or passive), and functions such as causative, intensive, or reflexive.

Since Arabic lacks a verb meaning &quot;to have&quot;, constructions using &quot;li&quot;-, &quot;‘inda&quot;, and &quot;ma‘a&quot; with the pronominal suffixes are used to describe possession. For example: (&quot;ʿindahu bayt&quot;) – literally: At him (is) a house. → He has a house.

For the negation of Arabic verbs, see Negation in Arabic.

==Prepositions==

There are two types of prepositions, based on whether they arise from the triconsonantal roots system or not. The &#x27;true prepositions&#x27; ( &#x27;) do not stem from the triconsonantal roots. These true prepositions cannot have prepositions preceding them, in contrast to the derived triliteral prepositions. True prepositions can also be used with certain verbs to convey a particular meaning. For example, &#x27; means &quot;to discuss&quot; as a transitive verb, but can mean &quot;to search for&quot; when followed by the preposition &#x27;, and &quot;to do research about&quot; when followed by &#x27;.

The prepositions arising from the triliteral root system are called &quot;adverbs of place and time&quot; in the native tradition ( &quot;&quot;) and work very much in the same way as the &#x27;true&#x27; prepositions.

A noun following a preposition takes the genitive case. However, prepositions can take whole clauses as their object too if succeeded by the conjunctions &#x27; or &#x27;, in which case the subject of the clause is in the nominative or the accusative respectively.

==Syntax==

=== Genitive construction () ===
A noun may be defined more precisely by adding another noun immediately afterwards. In Arabic grammar, this is called (&quot;annexation, addition&quot;) and in English is known as the &quot;genitive construct&quot;, &quot;construct phrase&quot;, or &quot;annexation structure&quot;. The first noun must be in the construct form while, when cases are used, the subsequent noun must be in the genitive case. The construction is typically equivalent to the English construction &quot;(noun) of (noun)&quot;. This is a very widespread way of forming possessive constructions in Arabic, and is typical of a Semitic language.

Simple examples include:
* &quot;the daughter of Hasan/Hasan&#x27;s daughter&quot;.
* &quot;the house of peace&quot;.
* &quot;a kilo of bananas&quot;.
* &quot;&quot; &quot;the house of a man/a man&#x27;s house&quot;.
* &quot;the house of the man/the man&#x27;s house&quot;.

The range of relationships between the first and second elements of the &quot;idafah&quot; construction is very varied, though it usually consists of some relationship of possession or belonging. In the case of words for containers, the &quot;idāfah&quot; may express what is contained: &#x27; &quot;a cup of coffee&quot;. The &quot;idāfah&quot; may indicate the material something is made of: &#x27; &quot;a wooden ring, ring made of wood&quot;. In many cases the two members become a fixed coined phrase, the &quot;idafah&quot; being used as the equivalent of a compound noun used in some Indo-European languages such as English. Thus &quot;&quot; can mean &quot;house of the (certain, known) students&quot;, but is also the normal term for &quot;the student hostel&quot;.

===Word order===
====Word order in classical Arabic====

Classical Arabic tends to prefer the word order VSO (verb before subject before object), but uses the particle &quot;ʼinna&quot; and SVO (subject before verb) to emphasize the subject. Verb-initial word orders like in Classical Arabic are relatively rare across the world&#x27;s languages, occurring only in a few language families including Celtic, Austronesian, and Mayan. The different Arabic word orders have an agreement asymmetry: the verb shows person, number, and gender agreement with the subject in SVO constructions but only gender (and possibly person) agreement in VSO, to the exclusion of number.

Modern Standard Arabic tends to use SVO without &quot;ʼinna&quot;.


Despite the fact that the subject in the latter two above examples is plural, the verb lacks plural marking and instead surfaces as if it were in the singular form.

Though early accounts of Arabic word order variation argued for a flat, non-configurational grammatical structure, more recent work has shown that there is evidence for a VP constituent in Arabic, that is, a closer relationship between verb and object than verb and subject. This suggests a hierarchical grammatical structure, not a flat one. An analysis such as this one can also explain the agreement asymmetries between subjects and verbs in SVO versus VSO sentences, and can provide insight into the syntactic position of pre- and post-verbal subjects, as well as the surface syntactic position of the verb.

In the present tense, there is no overt copula in Arabic. In such clauses, the subject tends to precede the predicate, unless there is a clear demarcating pause between the two, suggesting a marked information structure. It is a matter of debate in Arabic literature whether there is a null present tense copula which syntactically precedes the subject in verbless sentences, or whether there is simply no verb, only a subject and predicate.

Subject pronouns are normally omitted except for emphasis or when using a participle as a verb (participles are not marked for person). Because the verb agrees with the subject in person, number, and gender, no information is lost when pronouns are omitted. Auxiliary verbs precede main verbs, prepositions precede their objects, and nouns precede their relative clauses.

Adjectives follow the noun they are modifying, and agree with the noun in case, gender, number, and state: For example, &#x27; &#x27;a beautiful girl&#x27; but &#x27; &#x27;the beautiful girl&#x27;. (Compare &quot;&quot; &#x27;the girl is beautiful&#x27;.) Elative adjectives, however, usually do not agree with the noun they modify, and sometimes even precede their noun while requiring it to be in the genitive case.

====Word order in colloquial spoken Arabic====
Colloquial spoken Arabic may employ different word order than Classical Arabic or Modern Standard Arabic.

Regarding subject-verb order, Owens et al. (2009), examined three dialects of the Arabian peninsula from a discourse informational and a morpholexical perspective. They show that subject-verb or verb-subject word order is correlated with the lexical class (i.e. pronoun, pronominal, noun), definiteness, and the discourse-defined lexical specificity of a noun. Owens et al. (2009) argue that verb-subject order usually presents events, while subject-verb indicates available referentiality.

In Modern Standard Arabic, the VSO and SVO word orders results in an agreement asymmetry between the verb and the subject: the verb shows person, number, and gender agreement with the subject in SVO constructions, but only gender (and possibly person) agreement in VS, to the exclusion of number. In Lebanese Arabic and Moroccan Arabic, there is agreement between verb and subject in number under both the SV and the VS orders.
El-Yasin (1985) examined colloquial Jordanian Arabic, and concluded that it exhibits a SVO order. This, according to El-Yasin, provides evidence of a language changing from a VSO (CA) into a SVO language (Jordanian Arabic). On the other hand, Mohammad, M. A. (2000) showed that MSA allows all six possible word orders (VSO, SVO, VOS, SOV, OSV, OVS) while Palastinian Arabic (PA) allows only three word orders, namely: VSO, VOS, and SVO.

In her book &quot;Spoken Arabic,&quot; Brustad, K. (2000) notes that in the dialects she studied (Moroccan, Egyptian, Syrian, and Kuwaiti) verb initial (VSO) and subject initial (SVO) word orders are present. In the case of verb initial word order, it is common that the subject is marked on the verb and is not expressed as an independent verb.
Brustad, K. (2000) points out that if both VSO and SVO are basic typologies in spoken Arabic, then functional typology investigating the semantic and pragmatic roles can shed light on the different contexts where these word orders appear. Despite the analysis that both VS and SV typologies are found in spoken Arabic dialects (Moroccan, Egyptian, Syrian, and Kuwaiti), Brustad, K. (2000) notes that sentence typologies found in spoken Arabic are not limited to these two word orders. She adds that almost any basic constituent may begin an Arabic sentence. She argues that sentences other than VS and SV are marked forms of topic-prominent or subject-prominent sentences.

====&quot;’inna&quot;====
The subject of a sentence can be topicalized and emphasized by moving it to the beginning of the sentence and preceding it with the word &#x27; &#x27;indeed&#x27; (or &#x27;verily&#x27; in older translations). An example would be &#x27; &#x27;The sky is blue indeed&#x27;.

&#x27;, along with its related terms (or &quot;sister&quot; terms in the native tradition) &#x27; &#x27;that&#x27; (as in &quot;I think that ...&quot;), &#x27; &#x27;that&#x27; (after &#x27; &#x27;say&#x27;), &#x27; &#x27;but&#x27; and &#x27; &#x27;as if&#x27; introduce subjects while requiring that they be immediately followed by a noun in the accusative case, or an attached pronominal suffix.

=== Definite article ===

As a particle, &quot;al-&quot; does not inflect for gender, number, person, or grammatical case. The sound of the final -l consonant, however, can vary; when followed by a sun letter such as t, d, r, s, n and a few others, it is replaced by the sound of the initial consonant of the following noun, thus doubling it. For example: for &quot;the Nile&quot;, one does not say &quot;al-Nīl&quot;, but &quot;an-Nīl&quot;. When followed by a moon letter, like m-, no replacement occurs, as in &quot;al-masjid&quot; (&quot;the mosque&quot;). This affects only the pronunciation and not the spelling of the article.

=== Absolute object (al-maf&#x27;ūl al-muṭlaq) ===
The absolute object ( &#x27;) is an emphatic cognate object construction in which a verbal noun derived from the main verb appears in the accusative ( &#x27;) case.
=== Object of purpose (al-maf&#x27;ūl li-&#x27;ajlihi) ===
The ( &#x27;) is an adverbial structure used to indicate purpose, motive, or reason for an action. It consists of a verbal noun derived from the main verb that appears in the accusative ( &#x27;) case.
=== Dynasty or family ===

Some people, especially in the region of Arabia, when they are descended from a famous ancestor, start their last name with , a noun meaning &quot;family&quot; or &quot;clan&quot;, like the dynasty Al Saud (family of Saud) or Al ash-Sheikh (family of the Sheikh). is distinct from the definite article .

Object pronouns are clitics and are attached to the verb; e.g., &#x27; &#x27;I see her&#x27;. Possessive pronouns are likewise attached to the noun they modify; e.g., &#x27; &#x27;his book&#x27;. The definite article &#x27; is a clitic, as are the prepositions &#x27; &#x27;to&#x27; and &#x27; &#x27;in, with&#x27; and the conjunctions &#x27; &#x27;as&#x27; and &quot;&quot; &#x27;then, so&#x27;.

==Reform of the Arabic tradition==
An overhaul of the native systematic categorization of Arabic grammar was first suggested by the medieval philosopher al-Jāḥiẓ, though it was not until two hundred years later when Ibn Maḍāʾ wrote his &quot;Refutation of the Grammarians&quot; that concrete suggestions regarding word order and linguistic governance were made. In the modern era, Egyptian litterateur Shawqi Daif renewed the call for a reform of the commonly used description of Arabic grammar, suggesting to follow trends in Western linguistics instead.

<doc id="305972" wikidata="Q1192648" url="?curid=305972" title="Forward compatibility">
<text>Forward compatibility or upward compatibility is a design characteristic that allows a system to accept input intended for a later version of itself. The concept can be applied to entire systems, electrical interfaces, telecommunication signals, data communication protocols, file formats, and programming languages. A standard supports forward compatibility if a product that complies with earlier versions can &quot;gracefully&quot; process input designed for later versions of the standard, ignoring new parts which it does not understand.

The objective for forward compatible technology is for old devices to recognise when data has been generated for new devices.

Forward compatibility for the older system usually means backward compatibility for the new system, i.e. the ability to process data from the old system; the new system usually has &quot;full&quot; compatibility with the older one, by being able to both process and generate data in the format of the older system.

Forward compatibility is not the same as extensibility. A forward compatible design can process at least some of the data from a future version of itself. An extensible design makes upgrading easy. An example of both design ideas can be found in web browsers. At any point in time, a current browser is forward compatible if it gracefully accepts a newer version of HTML, whereas how easily the browser code can be upgraded to process the newer HTML determines how extensible it is.

==Examples==

===Telecommunication standards===
The introduction of FM stereo transmission, or color television, allowed forward compatibility, since monophonic FM radio receivers and black-and-white TV sets still could receive a signal from a new transmitter. It also allowed backward compatibility since new receivers could receive monophonic or black-and-white signals generated by old transmitters.

===Video gaming===
* The Game Boy is able to play certain games released for the Game Boy Color. These games utilize the same cartridge design as games for the original Game Boy, though the plastic used is typically black rather than gray and feature the GBC&#x27;s logo on the label and packaging; Nintendo officially referred to such titles as being &quot;Dual Mode&quot;.
* The Leapster is able to play Leapster L-Max games, and the Leapster L-Max is able to play Leapster2 games.
* The original PlayStation is compatible with the DualShock 2 controller. Likewise the PlayStation 3 can be played with a DualShock 4 and DualSense controller.
*The Neo Geo Pocket was able to play most games from Neo Geo Pocket Color.
*The WonderSwan is able to play some WonderSwan Color games.
*The Xbox One can use the controller from the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, and likewise an Xbox One controller will work on the Xbox Series X and Series S.
*The V.Smile Smartridge is compatible with every VTech console and handheld game system. However, it does not support the V.Smile Baby, PC Pal, and V.Flash systems. Depending on the device inserted, some functions may be limited, reflecting the varied capabilities of each console.

===HTML===
HTML is designed to treat all tags in the same way (as inert, unstyled inline elements) unless their appearance or behavior is overridden; either by the browser&#x27;s default settings, or by scripts or styles included in the page. This makes most new features degrade gracefully in older browsers. One case where this did not work as intended was script and style blocks, whose contents are meant to be interpreted by the browser instead of being part of the page. Such cases were dealt with by enclosing the contents within comment blocks.

As there is no mandatory upgrade of computers or web browsers, many web developers use a graceful degradation or progressive enhancement approach, attempting to make newly-created websites that are usable by people who have turned off Javascript or who have old computers or old web browsers or on a slow connection, yet still taking advantage of faster hardware and better JavaScript support in more modern web browsers, when available.

===Optical media===
Each of the three most common 12 cm optical media formats (CD, DVD, and Blu-ray) was first released in read-only form years before writable forms were available. Within each format, there is both forward and backward compatibility, in that most older read-only drives and players can read (but not write) writable media in the same format, while read/write drives can read (but not write) old read-only media. There is no forward compatibility between formats; a CD player, for instance, can&#x27;t read a DVD (a newer format), not even the audio tracks. There may be backward compatibility for better marketability (such as a DVD player playing an audio CD), but it is not intrinsic to the standards.

==Not upwardly compatible==

Some products are not designed to be forward compatible, which has been referred to as NUC (not upwardly compatible). In some cases this might be intentional by the designers as a form of vendor lock-in or software regression.

For example, a cubicle producer considers changing their cubicle design. One designer promotes changing the footprint from square to 1.2 meter square. Immediately, the sales manager calls &quot;NUC&quot; and the problem is understood: if the footprint changes and existing customers are considering buying more from the producer, they will have to fit a different sized unit in an office designed for the 4 foot square cubicle.

Planned obsolescence is a type of upward compatibility, but rather than adopting a policy of backwards compatibility, companies adopt a commercial policy of backwards incompatibility so that newer apps require newer devices.

<doc id="305975" wikidata="Q645615" url="?curid=305975" title="National Association of Underwater Instructors">
<text>The National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI Worldwide) is a nonprofit association of scuba instructors founded in 1960 by Albert Tillman and Neal Hess. 

NAUI primarily serves as a recreational dive certification and membership organization, providing international diver standards and education programs. NAUI is headquartered in Riverview, Florida near Tampa with dive and member instructors, resorts, stores, service and training centers located around the world.

== Certifications &amp; leadership ==
It was officially CE and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certified in May 2007 in all three diver levels and both instructor levels. It was re-certified for its scuba diving programs as meeting ISO and European Underwater Federation standards on November 24, 2015.

Agency standards, policies, and ethics are governed by the Association&#x27;s Board of Directors, who are members themselves and who are each elected through a democratic election process by the overall instructor membership.

==History==

After Jacques-Yves Cousteau introduced the Aqua-Lung to the market, there followed a growing interest in scuba diving by the public and a subsequent need to codify the training.

In 1951, Jim Auxie Jr and Chuck Blakeslee started a magazine called &quot;The Skin Diver&quot; (later renamed &quot;Skin Diver Magazine&quot;). Two-year dive teacher Neal Earl Hess contributed to its &quot;The Instructors Corner&quot; column to inform readers about scuba. He soon established a column called &quot;The National Diving Patrol&quot; as a section to name new skin and scuba diving &quot;instructors&quot;.

Still, no official training and certifying agency existed, except for the training and resources provided by the military (Underwater Demolition Teams) and dive clubs.

In 1952, Al Tillman, the director of sports for the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation, said in a letter to Parks and Recreation director Paul Gruendyke, &quot;A new sport—skin diving—is becoming popular in the area. Recently while diving in Palos Verdes, I ran into several divers in the water with me who didn&#x27;t know what they were doing. One had one of the new underwater breathing units that allows divers to stay under for long periods of time... I propose that my department get involved in this sport and provide training classes. I believe that diving will grow in the future and we have an obligation to make the sport as safe as possible.&quot;

In 1955, Tillman and L.A. County lifeguard Bev Morgan created the L.A. County Parks and Recreational Underwater Instructor Certification Course (1UICC) in an effort to respond to the growing number of diver requests. It was the world&#x27;s first civilian training program to certify recreational divers and soon began granting Provisional Certification to instructors across the country.

In the May 1960 issue of &quot;Skin Diver Magazine&quot;, the creation of The National Diving Patrol was announced as an official, national organization. Its purpose and function was &quot;to insure competent underwater instruction and to reduce diving accidents through education.&quot; In 1959, the name was changed to the National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI).

Hess, Blakeslee, Auxier, and Tillman met in August 1960 to discuss and organize NAUI&#x27;s first Instructor Certification Course. It was held at the Shamrock Hotel in Houston, Texas on August 22–26. During the six-day course, 72 candidates attended from the U.S. and Canada, but only 53 graduated. The 53 graduates along with their staff instructors became the first instructor members of the National Association of Underwater Instructors. The NAUI ICC became the first course to make diver certification available worldwide.

A year later, the second NAUI ICC was held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, under the direction of Ben Davis.

In October 1961, NAUI was incorporated in the State of California as a non-profit educational organization, with Al Tillman as the President and Neal Hess as the Executive Secretary.

NAUI&#x27;s first elected Board of Directors included Al Tillman, John C. Jones, Jr., Neal Hess, Garry Howland, Jim Auxier, and James Cahill. A Board of Advisers was appointed and included Captain Albert Behnke, Jr., Commander George Bond, Captain Jacques-Yves Cousteau, and Dr. Andreas Rechnitzer.

The number of NAUI ICCs grew throughout the 1960s in central locations throughout North America. The association&#x27;s conduct of business relied on volunteers and the board regional leaders, all administered out of Al Tillman&#x27;s home. &quot;Skin Diver Magazine&quot; published the &quot;NAUI Page&quot; as a regular feature to help the organization grow, to accumulate a salary and, later, to provide office space.The first International Conference on Underwater Education was held in 1969 at Santa Ana College, where it served as a venue for NAUI members from all over could meet and exchange ideas. It was also used as a forum to present information on diving skills and safety, teaching, diving physiology, physics, and other diving and marine sciences.

The US Internal Revenue Service determined that NAUI be a tax-exempt nonprofit educational organization in 1971.

Soon, NAUI membership began to expand internationally, with an ICC being held in Japan in 1970 and NAUI Canada being organized as a separate corporation in 1972.

NAUI instructors certified more than 40,000 entry-level scuba divers in 1970 alone; 1979 was a year with over 5,000 newly certified NAUI scuba instructors. By the time 1989 came around, over 12,000 NAUI instructors were certified. NAUI Worldwide had established a network of 20 service centers in 1998.

From 1981 to 1997, NAUI headquarters facilities remained in Montclair, California. It was during these years (in 1987) that the NAUI Board of Directors elected its first woman president, Nancy Guarascio.

In 1997, NAUI Worldwide headquarters was moved to Tampa, Florida and included Board of Directors members from Europe and Asia for the first time.

NAUI hired Jim Bram as its president in June 1995. Bram renamed NAUI to do business as &quot;NAUI Worldwide&quot;, with the intent to provide business support to members everywhere via licensed service centers.

On January 20, 2015, the Ohio Board of Pharmacy amended Code 4729-21-06: Sales of medical oxygen to scuba divers. The code authorized individuals who completed courses from NAUI to purchase and possess medical oxygen for the purpose of emergency care or treatment at the scene of a diving emergency.

In November 2015, NAUI released a series of announcements during the 2015 DEMA Show in Orlando, Florida. Its first podcast series, the &quot;Dive Team Report&quot;, released once per week. The podcast was designed to inform the general public and divers on trends and issues affecting the sport of diving. The first full episode aired on November 12, 2015.

A series of other announcements included its new marketing campaign &quot;The Definition of Diving&quot;, its demo version of its new website interface (version 1.0), and its alliance with the Divers Alert Network and Performance Freediving International. For the first time, NAUI and DAN came together to offer DAN&#x27;s first-aid programs to NAUI divers and members. NAUI established and incorporated the co-branded DAN-NAUI first-aid courses into their curricula.

=== NAUI Green Diver Initiative ===
In 2010, NAUI Worldwide formed the NAUI Green Diver Initiative (GDI). GDI was implemented to &quot;empower individuals to preserve and conserve the ocean planet with the common goal of taking action to protect the environment.&quot; With stagnant progress, it was not until July 2015 that NAUI renewed its commitment to the Initiative, unveiling its first manager, Sam Richardson, who entered the full-time position with over 10 years of non-profit experience. GDI remained a U.S. registered 501 (c) (3) non-profit that relied on the support of donors to fulfill its mission.

== Honorary NAUI members recognitions ==

In the United States, US Navy SEALs, Coast Guard rescue divers, and other special military forces are trained to NAUI standards as part of their overall training with open and closed circuit rebreathers; National Park Service and NOAA divers receive NAUI training and certifications.

Aqualung inventor Captain Jacques-Yves Cousteau was on the original Board of Advisers of NAUI, as was Albert R. Behnke, a pioneer of diving medicine.

Actor Lloyd Bridges was the first honorary NAUI instructor member. He played frogman &quot;Mike Nelson&quot; in the American television series &quot;Sea Hunt&quot;, which popularized scuba diving as a recreational sport. Zale Parry played the female role, and she formally instructed Lloyd Bridges on how to dive for the part. She was a research diver starring in the television&#x27;s first underwater documentary series, Kingdom of the Sea, in 1954. She made a record-setting 209-foot dive that same year, distinguishing women as skilled divers.

=== Corporate alliances ===

NAUI has numerous corporate alliances with organizations, such as Walt Disney World Resort, The Florida Aquarium, NASA&#x27;s Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, and the Fire Department of New York. Many of the first generation of diving safety officers of the top universities, colleges and institutes of technology in the United States were NAUI members and made significant contributions to NAUI&#x27;s programs, including: Lee Somers University of Michigan, James Stewart Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Richard Bell University of California, Davis, Henry Viex United States Military Academy, Lloyd Austin University of California, Berkeley, Mark Flahan California State University, San Diego, Phillip Sharkey University of Rhode Island, Ronnie D&#x27;Amico California State University, Long Beach, Walt Hendricks, Sr. University of Puerto Rico, Glen Egstrom University of California, Los Angeles, and John Heine Moss Landing Marine Laboratories.

These institutions, and others, belong to the American Academy of Underwater Sciences, and while their training programs greatly exceed minimum NAUI requirements, certifications in their scientific diving training programs are often arranged through NAUI. Many governmental agencies in the United States do the same, including the US Navy SEALs, Army Special Forces, and NASA.

=== NAUI programs ===

==== Insurance programs ====

NAUI is allied with Divers Alert Network, a non-profit organization for diver&#x27;s assistance and medical research on recreational scuba diving safety, developed by Executive Director Dan Orr in 1980. DAN and NAUI allied in 2007 to work together for diver safety. DAN is the official dive accident insurance provider for NAUI. In November 2015, DAN and NAUI renewed their alliance to extend their reach of dive safety programs.

NAUI initiated a worldwide coverage instructor liability insurance policy in 1974. This worldwide policy allowed members of the Bahamas, British Virgin Islands and other islands of the Caribbean, and military personnel stationed in various areas around the world to receive worldwide coverage.

==== First aid programs ====
NAUI&#x27;s rescue certification course was first proposed and made available to members in 1981 to provide an alternative to the Red Cross training, which was previously required for leadership candidates in NAUI courses. It was created by the NAUI Board of Directors to avoid making NAUI programs dependent upon other agency certifications.

== NAUI technical diving professional certifications ==

NAUI sanctioned nitrox training in 1992 and published standards for teaching technical diving in 1997. 

Technical diving includes methods that exceed the limits imposed on depth or immersion time for traditional recreational diving. It often involves the use of special gas mixtures (rather than compressed air) for breathing. NAUI standards for technical diving were developed by Tim O&#x27;Leary and published by NAUI Worldwide in 1997. NAUI&#x27;s technical diving program requires special training, equipment, and qualified support teams.

In 1997, the NAUI Technical Diving Division was created. NAUI formed a Technical Training Advisory Board and Rebreather Advisory Board, with Tim O&#x27;Leary as the chairman for each, to assist in the development of technical diving standards and training.

===NAUI decompression algorithms and tables===

The reduced gradient bubble model is an iterative approach to staging diver ascents. It employs a dual phase approach with separated phase volumes as limit points, along with critical tensions across tissue compartments. It was developed by Dr. Bruce Wienke in 1988 at Los Alamos National Laboratories. He published the model in 1992. The algorithm is now incorporated into many dive computers and advanced dive planning software. Today it enhances the safety of serious deep and technical divers.

NAUI&#x27;s RGBM decompression tables were developed in 1997 exclusively for NAUI by Dr. Bruce Wienke and Tim O&#x27;Leary. NAUI began publishing the only decompression manual with a full set of RGBM tables in 2000 for air, nitrox and trimix for both open and closed-circuit diving. Recreational RGBM no-calculation tables were published in 2001 exclusively for NAUI for sea level through 10,000 feet, no-stop diving.

== Accreditation and affiliations ==
The Chinese Underwater Association (CUA), in conjunction with the China Water Sports Administration (CWSA), officially legitimized NAUI to provide translated diver training materials and diver training in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

The Malaysian Sport Diving Association (MSDA)] officially adopted NAUI standards for use in their diver training in Malaysia.

NAUI is the diver training organization of choice of NASA&#x27;s Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas (USA). NAUI&#x27;s alliance with the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory provides training materials, certification cards and collateral materials for their scuba program.

NAUI is a member of the Universal Referral Program (URP), a worldwide customer service program that allows instructors to refer their students for certification dives with either NAUI or other diver training agencies. The URP was developed in 1998 through the cooperative efforts of IDEA, NASDS, NAUI, PDIC, SSI, and YMCA. PADI Instructors and facilities can also receive students and be registered as referral instructors and locations under the URP.

<text>The American Legion, commonly known as the Legion, is an organization of U.S. war veterans headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. It comprises state, U.S. territory, and overseas departments, in turn made up of local posts. It was established in March 1919 in Paris, France, by officers and men of the American Expeditionary Forces (A.E.F.). It was subsequently chartered by the 66th U.S. Congress on September 16, 1919.

The Legion played the leading role in drafting and passing the Servicemen&#x27;s Readjustment Act of 1944, commonly known as the &quot;G.I. Bill&quot;. In addition to organizing commemorative events, members assist at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals and clinics. It is active in issue-oriented U.S. politics. Its primary political activity is lobbying on behalf of veterans and service members, including for benefits such as pensions and the Veterans Health Administration.

==History==
The American Legion was established in Paris, France, on March 15 to 17, 1919, by a thousand commissioned officers and enlisted men, delegates from all the units of the American Expeditionary Forces to an organization caucus meeting, which adopted a tentative constitution and selected the name &quot;American Legion&quot;.

==Background==
The aftermath of two American wars in the second half of the 19th century had seen the formation of several ex-soldiers&#x27; organizations. Former Union Army soldiers of the American Civil War of 1861–65 established a fraternal organization, the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), while their Southern brethren formed the United Confederate Veterans (UCV). Both organizations emerged as powerful political entities, with the GAR serving as a mainstay of the Republican Party, which controlled the presidency from the Civil War through William Howard Taft&#x27;s administration except during Grover Cleveland&#x27;s two terms in office. In Southern politics the UCV maintained an even more dominant position as a bulwark of the Democratic Party, which dominated there. The conclusion of the brief Spanish–American conflict of 1898 ushered in another soldiers&#x27; organization, the American Veterans of Foreign Service, known today as the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (VFW).

==20th century==

===Birth of the Legion===
With the termination of hostilities in World War I in November 1918, some American officers who had participated in the conflict began to think about creating a similar organization for the two million men who had been on European duty. The need for an organization for former members of the AEF was pressing and immediate. With the war at an end, hundreds of thousands of impatient draftees found themselves trapped in France and pining for home, certain only that untold weeks or months lay ahead of them before their return would be logistically possible. Morale plummeted. Cautionary voices were raised about an apparent correlation between disaffected and discharged troops and the Bolshevik uprisings in Russia, Finland, Germany, and Hungary. 

This situation was a particular matter of concern to Lieutenant Colonel Theodore Roosevelt Jr., President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s eldest son. One day in January 1919, he had a discussion at General Headquarters with the mobilized National Guard officer George A. White, a former newspaper editor at the Portland &quot;Oregonian.&quot; After long discussion, he suggested the immediate establishment of a new servicemen&#x27;s organization including all AEF members as well as those soldiers who remained stateside as members of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps during the war without having been shipped abroad. Roosevelt and White advocated ceaselessly for this proposal until they found sufficient support at headquarters to move forward with the plan. General John J. Pershing issued orders to a group of 20 non-career officers to report to the YMCA in Paris on February 15, 1919. Roosevelt had personally selected these men. They were joined by a number of regular Army officers Pershing selected.

The session of reserve and regular officers was instructed to provide a set of laws to curb the problem of declining morale. After three days, the officers presented a series of proposals, including eliminating restrictive regulations, organizing additional athletic and recreational events, and expanding leave time and entertainment programs. At the end of the first day, the officers retired to the Inter-Allied Officers Club, a converted home across the street from the YMCA building. There, Roosevelt told them of his proposal for a new veterans&#x27; society. Most of those present were rapidly won to Roosevelt&#x27;s plan. The officers decided to make all their actions provisional until an elected convention of delegates could convene and did not predetermine a program for the unnamed veterans organization. Instead, they chose to expand their number with a large preliminary meeting, to consist of an equal number of elected delegates to represent both enlisted men and commissioned officers. 

A provisional executive committee of four men emerged from the February 15 &quot;Roosevelt dinner&quot;: Roosevelt in the first place, who was to return to the U.S. and obtain his military discharge when able, and then to gather assistants and promote the idea of the new veterans&#x27; organization among demobilized troops there; White, who was to travel to France touring the AEF camps and explaining the idea; veteran wartime administrator Eric Fisher Wood, who was to establish a central office and maintain contact with the various combat divisions and headquarters staffs, as well as publicize activities to the press; and former Ohio Congressman Ralph D. Cole. 

Preparations for a convention in Paris began apace. Wood prepared a convention call and &quot;invitations&quot; were distributed to about 2,000 officers and enlisted men and publicized in the March 14, 1919 issue of &quot;Stars and Stripes.&quot; The convention call expressed the desire to form &quot;one permanent nation-wide organization...composed of all parties, all creeds, and all ranks who wish to perpetuate the relationships formed while in military service.&quot; In addition to the personal invitations distributed, the published announcement indicated that &quot;any officer or enlisted man not invited who is in Paris at the time of the meeting is invited to be present and to have a voice in the meeting.&quot; The conclave was slated to begin on March 15.

The site of Ferdinand Branstetter Post No. 1 is a vacant lot in Van Tassell, Wyoming, where the first American Legion post in the U.S. was established in 1919. Branstetter was a Van Tassell resident who died in World War I. The structure housing the post has since been demolished. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. In 1969, it was hoped that an interpretative sign would be put up, and also possibly that a restored post building would be constructed.

The first post of the Legion, General John Joseph Pershing Post Number 1 in Washington, DC, was organized on March 7, 1919, and obtained the first charter issued to any Legion post on May 19, 1919. The St. Louis caucus that year decided that Legion posts should not be named after living persons, and the first post changed its name to George Washington Post 1. The post completed the constitution and made plans for a permanent organization. It set up temporary headquarters in New York City and began its relief, employment, and Americanism programs.

On May 20, 1919, Colonel Ernest Lester Jones received a petition from 20 of the enlisted women of the U.S. Naval Reserve Force for a charter to organize a post to be known as &quot;Betsy Ross Post No. l&quot;, composed entirely of Yeomen (F) of the U.S. Navy. In October of that year, the post changed its name to U.S.S. Jacob Jones, which commemorated the members&#x27; Navy heritage.

Congress granted The American Legion a national charter in September 1919.

The American Legion chartered Paris Post No. 1 on December 13, 1919. It was the first overseas post to be chartered and has been in continuous existence since then.

China Post One, formed in 1919, one year after the &quot;great war&quot; and chartered by The American Legion on April 20, 1920, was originally named the General Frederick Townsend Ward Post No. 1, China. It is the only post nominally headquartered in a Communist country, and has been operating in exile since 1948—presently in Fate, Texas.

====Paris Caucus====
Having immediately received a blizzard of acceptances to attend the opening of the &quot;Liberty League Caucus&quot;, as he had begun to call it, Temporary Secretary Eric Fisher Wood began to search for use of a room of sufficient size to contain the gathering. The Cirque de Paris had been retained, a large, multisided amphitheater that could accommodate about 2,000 people. Delegates began to assemble from all over France. The 10:00 am scheduled start was delayed by various logistical problems, with a beginning finally made shortly after 2:45 pm.

As &quot;Temporary Chairman&quot; Teddy Roosevelt Jr. had already departed for America, the session was gaveled to order by Wood, who briefly recounted Roosevelt&#x27;s idea and the story of the 20 AEF officers who had jointly helped to give the new organization form. In his opening remarks, Wood recommended to the delegates of the so-called Paris Caucus that they do three things: first, set up an apparatus to conduct a formal founding conference in the U.S. sometime in the winter; second, draft a tentative name for the organization; and finally, compose a provisional constitution to be submitted to the founding convention for acceptance or rejection.

William G. Price Jr. was selected to preside. Convention rules were decided upon and four 15-member committees were chosen. The Committee on Name reported back that it had considered a dozen potential names, including Veterans of the Great War, Liberty League, American Comrades of the Great War, Legion of the Great War, and The American Legion, among others. This list was whittled down to five ranked choices for the consideration of the Caucus, with &quot;The American Legion&quot; the preferred option. It was noted in passing during the course of debate on the topic that Roosevelt had been responsible for an earlier organization called &quot;The American Legion&quot; in 1914, a &quot;preparedness&quot; society with a claimed membership of 35,000 that had been absorbed into the Council of National Defense in 1916.

The Committee on Constitution reported with a report containing the draft of a Preamble for the organization, specifying organizational objectives. This document stated that the group:

desiring to perpetuate the principles of Justice, Freedom, and Democracy for which we have fought, to inculcate the duty and obligation of the citizen to the State; to preserve the history and incidents of our participation in the war; and to cement the ties of comradeship formed in service, do propose to found and establish an Association for the furtherance of the foregoing purposes.

The majority report of the Committee on Convention recommended that 11 am on November 11, 1919—one year to the hour after the termination of hostilities in World War I—be selected as the date and time for the convocation of a national convention. No location was specified.

The Committee on Permanent Organization recommended an organization based upon territorial units rather than those based upon military organizations, governed by an Executive Committee of 50, with half of these from the officer corps and half from the ranks of enlisted men.

====St. Louis Caucus====
The Paris Caucus in March was by its nature limited to AEF soldiers who remained in Europe; a parallel organizational meeting for those who had returned to the American preparatory to a formal organizational convention was deemed necessary. This was a conclave dominated by the presence of Roosevelt, who called the convention to order amid mass chanting akin to that of a presidential nominating convention—&quot;We Want Teddy! We Want Teddy!&quot;

A minor crisis followed when Roosevelt twice declined nomination for permanent chairman of the session, to the consternation of many overwrought delegates, who sought to emphasize the symbolism of President Roosevelt&#x27;s son maintaining the closest of connections with the organization. 

The St. Louis Caucus&#x27;s work was largely shaped by the fundamental decisions made by the earlier Paris Caucus. Its agenda was in addition carefully prepared by a 49-member &quot;Advance Committee&quot;, which included at least one delegate from each fledgling state organization and drew up a draft program for the organization in advance of the convention&#x27;s opening. 

As time before the scheduled start of the convention was short, delegation to the assembly was highly irregular. On April 10, 1919, Temporary Secretary Eric Fisher Wood mailed a letter to the governors of every state, informing them of the forthcoming gathering and making note of the League&#x27;s nonpartisan and patriotic nature. Follow-up cables by Roosevelt and Wood encouraged the organization of state conventions to select delegates. This was largely a failed formality, as states lacked sufficient time to organize themselves and properly elect delegates to St. Louis. In practice, the fledgling organization&#x27;s provisional Executive Committee decided to allow each state delegation twice as many votes as that state had in the United States House of Representatives and left it to each to determine how to apportion those votes.

Participants at the St. Louis Caucus were enthusiastic, but the session was not productive. Fully two days were invested choosing ceremonial officers and selecting Minneapolis as the site for the organization&#x27;s formal Founding Convention in the fall. Over 1,100 participants competed to gain the floor to speechify, leading one historian to call the scene a &quot;melee&quot; in which &quot;disorder reigned supreme&quot;. Consequently, the gathering&#x27;s passage of the program was largely a &quot;pro forma&quot; exercise, rushed through during the session&#x27;s last day, with the actual decision-making about such matters as the constitution and the organization&#x27;s publications done by committee at night.

The preamble of the constitution adopted in St. Louis became one of the seminal statements of the Legion&#x27;s orientation and objectives:

For God and Country we associate ourselves together for the following purposes:To uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States of America; to maintain law and order; to foster and perpetuate a 100 Percent Americanism; to preserve the memories and incidents of our association in the Great War; to inculcate a sense of individual obligation to the community, state, and nation; to combat the autocracy of both the classes and the masses; to make right the master of might; to promote peace and good will on earth; to safeguard and transmit to prosperity the principles of justice, freedom, and democracy; to consecrate and sanctify our comradeship by devotion to mutual helpfulness.

The St. Louis Caucus spent much of its time discussing resolutions: whether a stand should be taken on the League of Nations, Prohibition, or the implementation of universal military service; whether posts composed of Negro soldiers should be established; and whether Secretary of War Newton D. Baker should be impeached for his apparent leniency toward conscientious objectors in the months after the war.

A particularly hard line was taken toward the American radical movement, with one resolution passed on the final day calling on Congress to &quot;pass a bill or immediately deporting every one of those Bolsheviks or Industrial Workers of the World.&quot; Minneapolis, Minnesota, was chosen for the site of the organization&#x27;s founding convention in November over the more centrally located Chicago after much acrimonious debate about the Chicago city administration&#x27;s perceived political transgressions.

====Founding convention====
The formal founding convention was held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, from November 10 to 12, 1919. 684 delegates from across the nation attended.

From the outset, The American Legion maintained a strictly nonpartisan orientation toward electoral politics. The group wrote a specific prohibition of the endorsement of political candidates into its constitution, declaring:

this organization shall be absolutely non-political and shall not be used for the dissemination of partisan principles or for the promotion of the candidacy of any person seeking public office or preferment; and no candidate for or incumbent of a salaried elective public office shall hold any office in The American Legion or in any branch or post thereof.

One semi-official historian of the organization has noted the way that this explicit refusal to affiliate with a political party had the paradoxical effect of rapidly building great political power for the organization, as politicians from both of the &quot;old parties&quot; competed for the favor of the Legion&#x27;s massive and active membership.

One of the gathering&#x27;s primary accomplishments was the establishment of a permanent National Legislative Committee to advance the Legion&#x27;s political objectives as its lobbying arm. The first iteration of this official Washington, D.C.–based lobby for the Legion included only four members—two Republicans and two Democrats. After 1920 the National Legislative Committee was expanded to consist of one member from each state, with additional effort made at the state level to exert pressure upon various state legislatures.

Chief on the Legion&#x27;s legislative agenda was a dramatic improvement of the level of compensation for soldiers who suffered permanent disability during the war. At the time of the end of World War I, American law stated that soldiers who suffered total disability were to receive only the base pay of a private—$30 per month. The Legion concentrated its lobbying effort in 1919 on passage of legislation increasing payment for total disability suffered in the war to $80 a month—a sum roughly sufficient to provide a living wage. Those partially disabled by their wounds would receive lesser payments. A flurry of lobbying by the Legion&#x27;s National Legislative Committee in conjunction with cables National Commander Franklin D&#x27;Olier sent to Congressional leaders helped pass this legislation by the end of 1919.

The Legion&#x27;s chief base of support during its first years was among the officers corps of the reserves and the National Guard. The regular army was comparatively small and its representation in the League in its earliest days was even more limited. Consequently, for nearly two decades The Legion maintained a largely isolationist perspective, best expressed in three resolutions passed by the Minneapolis founding convention:

1. That a large standing army is uneconomic and un-American. National safety with freedom from militarism is best assured by a national citizen army and navy based on the democratic principles of equality of obligation and opportunity for all.2. That we favor universal military training and the administration of such a policy should be removed from the complete control of any exclusively military organization or caste.3. That we are strongly opposed to compulsory military service in time of peace.

Additional resolutions the founding convention passed emphasized the need for military preparedness, albeit through a citizens&#x27; army of reservists and National Guardsmen rather than the costly and undemocratic structure of a vast standing army led by a professional military caste. This nationalist isolationism remained in place until the eve of American entry into World War II.

====Centralia massacre====


November 11, 1919, the first anniversary of Armistice Day and the occasion of the Legion&#x27;s formal launch at its Minneapolis Founding Convention, was also a historic moment of violence and controversy. On that day a parade of Legionnaires took place in the mill town of Centralia, in southwestern Washington. Some of the marchers planned at the conclusion of their patriotic demonstration to storm and ransack the local hall maintained by the Industrial Workers of the World, a labor union founded 14 years earlier at a convention of socialists, anarchists, Marxists, and radical trade unionists from all over the U.S., which had been the target of multiple arrests, large trials, and various incidents of mob violence during the months of American participation in World War I. But the plans for this violence had reached union members (commonly called Wobblies), and 30 or 40 IWW members had been seen coming and going at their hall on the day of the march, some of them carrying guns.

At 2 p.m. the march began at the city park, led by a marching band playing &quot;Over There&quot;. Marchers included Boy Scouts, members of the local Elks Lodge, active-duty sailors, and marines, with about 80 members of the newly established Centralia and Chehalis posts bringing up the rear. As the parade turned onto Tower Avenue and crossed Second Street, it passed IWW Hall. The parade stopped and Legionnaires surrounded the hall.

Parade Marshal Adrian Cormier rode up on horseback and, according to some witnesses, blew a whistle giving the signal to the Legionnaires to charge the IWW headquarters building. A group of marchers rushed the hall, smashing the front plate-glass window and attempting to kick the door in. As the door gave way, shots were fired at the intruders from within. This provided the signal to other armed IWW members, who were stationed across the street, to set up crossfire against potential invaders, and they also began firing on the Legionnaires. In less than a minute the firing was over, with three AL members left dead or dying and others wounded.

Taken by surprise by the armed defense of IWW headquarters, many Legionnaires rushed home to arm themselves, while others broke into local hardware stores to steal guns and ammunition. Now armed, a furious mob reassembled and charged the IWW Hall again, capturing six IWW members inside. The mob destroyed the hall&#x27;s front porch and a large bonfire was built, upon which were torched the local Wobblies&#x27; official records, books, newspapers and mattresses.

One local Wobbly, Wesley Everest, escaped through a back door when he saw the mob approaching the hall. He fled into nearby woods, exchanging gunshots with his pursuers. One of those chasing him was hit in the chest several times with bullets and killed, increasing the Legionnaires&#x27; death toll to four. Everest was taken alive, kicked and beaten, with a belt wrapped around his neck as he was dragged back to town to be lynched. But local police intervened, and Everest was taken to jail, where he was thrown down on the concrete floor. At 7:30 pm, on cue, all city lights in town went out for 15 minutes and Legionnaires stopped cars and forced them to turn out their headlights. The Elks Hall gathering entered the jail without meeting resistance and took Everest, dragging him away to a waiting car but leaving other incarcerated Wobblies untouched. A procession of six cars drove west to a railroad bridge across the Chehalis River.

A rope was attached to Everest&#x27;s neck and he was pushed off the bridge, but the lynching attempt was bungled and Everest&#x27;s neck was not snapped by the fall. Everest was hauled up again, a longer rope was substituted, and Everest was pushed off the bridge again. The lynch mob then shined their car headlights on the hanging Everest and shot him.

Although a mob milled around the jail all night, terrorizing the occupants, no further acts of extra-legal retribution were taken. Everest&#x27;s body was cut down the next morning, falling into the riverbed below, where it remained all day. As night fell, Everest&#x27;s body was hauled back to town, the rope still around his neck, where it was refused by local undertakers and left on the floor of the jail in sight of the prisoners all night. No charges were ever filed in connection with the lynching.

A grand jury ultimately indicted 12 IWW members for first-degree murder in connection with the killing of the four Legionnaires and a local left-wing lawyer was charged as an accessory to the crime. A January 1920 trial resulted in the conviction of six defendants on charges of second-degree murder. A memorial statue created by Alonzo Victor Lewis, known as &quot;The Sentinel&quot;, was dedicated in Centralia&#x27;s George Washington Park in 1924 to honor the four legionnaires - Casagranda, Grimm, Hubbard, and McElfresh - killed during the Armistice Day Riot.

===1920s: Patriotism and Bonus===
The Legion was very active in the 1920s. The organization was formally nonpartisan, endorsing no political party. Instead the group worked to the spread of the ideology of Americanism and acted as a lobbying organization on behalf of issues of importance to veterans, with particular emphasis on winning a &quot;soldier&#x27;s bonus&quot; payment from the government. Led by top lobbyist Colonel John Thomas Taylor, it helped secure passage in 1924 over presidential veto of The World War Adjusted Compensation Act, or Bonus Act. The law granted a life insurance policy to veterans of military service in World War I. The actual payout was promised for 1945, but veterans would get a certificate immediately and they could borrow against it from banks.

The Legion also served a strong social function, building and buying &quot;clubhouses&quot; in communities across America at which its members could gather, reflect, network, and socialize. The Legion was instrumental in the creation of the U.S. Veterans&#x27; Bureau, now known as the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Legion also created its own American Legion Baseball Program, hosting national tournaments annually since 1926.

Commander Travers D. Carmen awarded Charles Lindbergh the Legion&#x27;s first &quot;Distinguished Service Medal&quot; on July 22, 1927. The Legion&#x27;s national convention was held in Paris in September 1927. A major part of this was a drum and bugle corps competition in which approximately 14,000 members took part.

====Controversy====
According to William Pencak: Veterans and their role in American society were extremely controversial in the twenties and thirties, both because of actual issues such as the Bonus or veterans’ support for defense expenditures, but also because critics saw in the American Legion a mirror of the powerful fascist movements in Europe, such as the Nazis in Germany and Fascists in Italy. The comparison reflected fear more than rationality: the Legion had no need or desire to overthrow the government. It was able to achieve nearly all its goals through traditional political channels and strongly supported constitutional authority. Its members did not wear military uniforms (only the familiar caps), elected its officers through democratic means—although as in all associations, an active elite ran the show—and had black, Catholic, and Jewish members. It boasted of Jewish national chaplains and Catholic national commanders. . . .The Legion’s anti-radical program was typical of conservatives throughout American history, who . . . rarely concerned themselves with the rights of union organizers or socialist ‘‘agitators’’ despite the formal constitutional protections.

====Americanism====

The Legion&#x27;s efforts to promote Americanism during the 1920s included urging its members to report on publication materials perceived to be subversive, left-wing, or reflective of radical foreign political views, and established a National Americanism Commission to oversee its actions related to subversive activities. It commissioned the development of textbooks that promoted American patriotism, worked with members of the National Education Association to promote teaching history from an American perspective, and sought the removal of textbooks it saw as &quot;un-American&quot;. In 1940 the Legion joined conservative publicists who were attacking high school American history textbooks by Harold Rugg. They complained the books were politically loaded against business and promoted socialism.

The Legion supported legislation restricting immigration and seditious speech and used its influence in an effort to deny public forums to speakers whose views it opposed.

In 1923, Legion Commander Alvin Owsley cited Italian Fascism as a model for defending the nation against the forces of the left. Owsley said:

If ever needed, the American Legion stands ready to protect our country&#x27;s institutions and ideals as the Fascisti dealt with the destructionists who menaced Italy! ... The American Legion is fighting every element that threatens our democratic government—Soviets, anarchists, IWW, revolutionary socialists and every other red ... Do not forget that the Fascisti are to Italy what the American Legion is to the United States.
The Legion invited Mussolini to speak at its convention as late as 1930, but he never came.

===Great Depression===
The American Legion Memorial Bridge in Traverse City, Michigan, was completed in 1930. The Traverse City city commission decided to purchase dedication plaques for $100 at the request of the Legion in 1930.

The Sons of the American Legion formed at the 14th National Convention in Portland, Oregon, on September 12–15, 1932. Membership is limited to the male descendants of members of The American Legion, or deceased individuals who served in the armed forces of the United States during times specified by the Legion.

In the spring of 1933, at the very beginning of his presidency, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt sought to balance the federal budget by sharp reductions in veterans benefits, which constituted one quarter of the federal budget. The Economy Act of 1933 cut disability pensions and established strict new guidelines for proving disabilities. The Legion generally supported the FDR administration and the Act, while the VFW was loudly opposed. After a VFW convention heard speeches denouncing FDR&#x27;s programs, the Legion invited Roosevelt to speak and he won the convention&#x27;s support. Nevertheless, the Legion&#x27;s stance was unpopular with its membership and membership plummeted in 1933 by 20% as 160,000 failed to renew their memberships. The VFW then campaigned for a &quot;Bonus Bill&quot; that would immediately pay World War I veterans what they were due in 1945 under the 1924 World War Adjusted Compensation Act. The Legion&#x27;s failure to take a similar position allowed the much smaller, less prestigious VFW to rally support while accusing the Legion of ties to the FDR Administration and business interests.

In 1935, the first Boys&#x27; State convened in Springfield, Illinois. The Legion&#x27;s first National High School Oratorical Contest was held in 1938.

After the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane, which killed about 480 former servicemen and women, the Legion was very critical of the government and the safety of the New Deal&#x27;s Works Progress Administration camps. When Col. Taylor testified about the event in front of the House Committee on World War Veterans&#x27; Legislation in 1937, he tried to have the Legion&#x27;s report &quot;Murder at Matecumbe&quot; read into the Congressional Record. He was stopped by Chairman John Elliott Rankin and asked to leave a copy for the committee to review. It was made clear that the copy would not be put into the record.

===World War II===
In 1942, the Legion adopted the practice of the VFW to become a perpetual organization, rather than die off as its membership aged as that of the Grand Army of the Republic was rapidly doing. The Legion&#x27;s charter was changed to allow veterans of World War II to join.

====G.I. Bill====
Throughout the 1940s, the Legion was active in providing support for veterans and soldiers who fought in World War II. The Legion wrote the original draft of the Veterans Readjustment Act, which became known as the G.I. Bill. The original draft is preserved at the Legion&#x27;s National Headquarters. It was passed in 1944 by a conservative coalition in Congress that want to reach practically all wartime veterans, as opposed to the Roosevelt administration that wanted a much smaller program limited to poverty-stricken veterans. The Legion mobilized its members across the country and secured passage in June 1944. Benefits included low-cost home mortgages, low-interest loans to start a business or buy a farm, cash payments of tuition and living expenses to attend high school, college or vocational/technical school, as well as one year of unemployment compensation. It was available to veterans who had been on active duty during the war years for at least 120 days and had not been dishonorably discharged—exposure to combat was not required. The Legion helped veterans fill out the paperwork and obtain the benefits.

====Refusal of Japanese American veterans====
Many posts and departments refused Japanese Americans entry into the Legion, until white officers from the 442nd RCT lobbied on behalf of their troops, gaining charters for the segregated Nisei Post 1183 in Chicago, Illinois, and a joint Chinese and Japanese Cathay Post 185 in Denver, Colorado. California veterans managed to convince a forward thinking VFW state commander to grant charters for 14 segregated Nisei VFW posts to returning veterans there, however Washington and Oregon state commanders for both the VFW and the Legion refused, and those veterans were forced to form their own independent Nisei veteran organizations. Post 22 of Hood River, Oregon even passed a resolution to remove the names of 16 local Japanese-American veterans from its roll of honor. Scathing editorials in The Oregonian and The New York Times eventually caused the post to reverse its course, restoring all the names of Nisei servicemen from Hood River to the wall.

===Cold War===

As the new veterans returned home, membership soared to 3.3 million in 1946, triple the prewar number. There were another million members in the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary. Its main objective after the war was to set up universal military service, but it had to settle for selective conscription. The first Boys Nation program was held in 1946.

Late in 1950, at least some local Legion organizations began to support Senator Joe McCarthy, sponsoring his appearance at an &quot;Americanism&quot; rally in Houston. During his speech, the senator falsely claimed there were 205 Communists in the State Department. The Legion also took a McCarthyist stance on film, threatening to boycott any theater that screened director Edward Dmytryk&#x27;s &quot;Salt to the Devil&quot; (also known as &quot;Give Us This Day&quot;) (1949) because of Dmytryk&#x27;s status on the blacklist.

At the Legion&#x27;s 1951 convention, it formally endorsed its &quot;Back to God&quot; movement. When launching the program in 1953 with a national television broadcast that included speeches by President Eisenhower and Vice-President Nixon, the Legion&#x27;s National Commander Lewis K. Gough said it promoted &quot;regular church attendance, daily family prayer, and the religious training of children.&quot;

The Legion&#x27;s Americanism activities continued through to the 1950s. It promoted the passage of state bills requiring loyalty oaths of school teachers, and supported the activities of anti-Communist newspaper publishers, including William Randolph Hearst, in identifying Communist sympathizers in academic institutions. It was also influential in the creation of state-level legislative investigations into communist or un-American activities, and staged a mock Communist takeover of Mosinee, Wisconsin that garnered national headlines. Its programs were rejuvenated by increased membership after World War II, and in its 1950 convention called for members of the American Communist Party to be tried for treason. Along with the VFW, it maintained files on supposed Communist sympathizers, and it shared the fruits of its research with government investigators. Local posts picketed films they perceived as anti-American, and the national organization was formally involved in Hollywood&#x27;s efforts to clear films of such influence. The list of names and organizations the Legion provided to movie studios formed the basis for the Hollywood blacklist, and supported the work of the House Un-American Activities Committee and its predecessors before and during the Cold War. It was unsuccessful in applying pressure to the movie studios when the blacklist began to crumble in the late 1950s.

The Legion&#x27;s political activities were opposed from an early date by organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which characterized them as a danger to political and civil rights. In a report issued in 1921, the ACLU documented 50 instances of what it described as illegal acts of violence by Legionnaires. In 1927, the ACLU reported that the Legion &quot;had replaced the [Ku Klux] Klan as the most active agent of intolerance and repression in the country. The Legion, for its part, branded the ACLU as an un-American organization at every convention it held between 1920 and 1962. In 1952, the Legion asked for a congressional investigation into the ACLU to determine if it was a communist or communist front organization.

Veterans of the Korean War were approved for membership in The Legion in 1950, and The American Legion Child Welfare Foundation was formed in 1954.

Although the Legion paid very close attention to the threat of domestic communism, it did not pay much attention to foreign affairs before 1945. It ignored the League of Nations, and was hostile to the Washington Naval Conference of 1921 that rolled back the naval arms race in the 1920s. Pacifism was popular in the 1920s, and Legion locals ridiculed it and sometimes booed the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom. During World War II, it accepted the wartime alliance with Stalin against Nazi Germany. As the Cold War emerged in 1946–47, the Legion paid increasing attention to an anti-Soviet foreign policy. Its Counter-Subversive Activities Committee in 1946 began publishing the &quot;American Legion Firing Line,&quot; a newsletter for members which provides information on communist, fascist, and other extremist groups to its subscribers. It warned members against far-right groups such as the John Birch Society and anti-Semitic groups. By the late 1950s the newsletter became much more interested in foreign affairs. The Legion&#x27;s policy resolutions endorsed large-scale defense spending and the deployment of powerful new weapon systems from the hydrogen bomb in the 1950s to Reagan&#x27;s Strategic Defense Initiative in the 1980s. Harry Truman was the first Legionnaire to occupy the White House, but he came under Legion attack for waging a limited war in Korea and not following the advice of General Douglas MacArthur in attacking China. By 1961 the Legion outright rejected the policy of containment, and called for the liberation of the captive peoples in Eastern Europe. Legion members typically hailed Barry Goldwater as their hero, but like Goldwater they rejected the extremism of the John Birch Society. The Legion supported increased intervention in Vietnam, as well as anti-Communist forces in Central America and Afghanistan. The Legion never saw much benefit in the United Nations, and like other conservatives worried about a loss of American sovereignty to international bodies. The collapse of Soviet-style communism in Eastern Europe and in Russia itself saw the Legion looking to new venues for militaristic action. Thus, it praised President George H.W. Bush is intervention in Kuwait against Iraq in 1990. After 9-11, it vigorously endorsed President George W. Bush&#x27;s strategy of a global war on terror, and supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

On May 30, 1969, the Cabin John Bridge, which carried the Capital Beltway (I-495) across the Potomac River northwest of Washington, was officially renamed to the &quot;American Legion Memorial Bridge&quot; in a ceremony led by Lt. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, director of the U.S. Selective Service System.
In 1976, an outbreak of bacterial pneumonia occurred in a convention of the Legion at the Bellevue Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia. This pneumonia killed 34 people at the convention and later became known as Legionnaires&#x27; disease (&quot;Legionellosis&quot;). The bacterium that causes the illness was later named &quot;Legionella&quot;.

In 1988, after over 44 years of opposing U.S. Merchant seamen from receiving benefits under the G.I. Bill, they allowed Merchant seamen to join the American Legion. This followed Merchant seamen being granted limited veterans status by the United States Secretary of the Air Force on January 19, 1988.

After a 1989 U.S. Supreme Court decision (&quot;Texas v. Johnson&quot;), the American Legion launched and funded an unsuccessful campaign to win a constitutional amendment against harming the flag of the United States. The Legion formed the Citizens&#x27; Flag Honor Guard and it later became the Citizens Flag Alliance.

===Close of the 20th century===
In 1993, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts renamed a bridge in the city of Chicopee to the &quot;American Legion Memorial Bridge&quot;.

Also in 1993, two members of Garden City, Michigan, Post 396 shared an idea that would bond motorcycle enthusiasts in the Legion from the idea of Chuck Dare and post commander Bill Kaledas, creating the American Legion Riders. Joined by 19 other founding members, the group soon found itself inundated with requests for information about the new group. As a source of information a website was set up, and it continues to be a source of information worldwide. By 2009, the Legion Riders program had grown to over 1,000 chapters and 100,000 members in the United States and overseas.

In a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton in May 1999, the Legion urged the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Operation Allied Force in Yugoslavia. The National Executive Committee of the Legion met and adopted a resolution unanimously that stated, in part, that they would only support military operations if &quot;Guidelines be established for the mission, including a clear exit strategy&quot; and &quot;That there be support of the mission by the U.S. Congress and the American people.&quot;

==21st century==
The American Legion sponsors Boys State and Girls State, an honor given to one male student and one female student in each high school, with selected individuals participating in a conference to learn about patriotism and government. On a national level, this occurs through Boys Nation and Girls Nation.

===2000s===
In 2006, the Chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, Steve Buyer (R-Ind.), announced that he planned to eliminate the annual congressional hearings for Veterans Service Organizations that was established by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In response, National Commander Thomas L. Bock said, &quot;I am extremely disappointed in Chairman Buyer&#x27;s latest effort to ignore the Veterans Service Organizations. Eliminating annual hearings before a joint session of the Veterans Affairs Committees will lead to continued budgetary shortfalls for VA resulting in veterans being underserved.&quot;

The Legion has criticized the ACLU for using the threat of attorney fees to pressure locally elected bodies into removing religion from the public square. As such the Legion states that it &quot;is leading a nationwide effort to combat the secular cleansing of our American heritage&quot;, stating that the phrase &quot;separation of church and state&quot; is nowhere mentioned in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution The American Legion released a document titled &quot;In the Footsteps of the Founders – A Guide to Defending American Values&quot; to be available to the citizens of the United States of America. The veteran&#x27;s organization has done this to curtail religious-establishment cases against the Boy Scouts and the official display of the Ten Commandments and other religious symbols on public property.

===Recent events===
In October 2011, National Commander Jimmie L. Foster objected to courts allowing homosexuals to serve openly in the military.

On March 25, 2014, the Legion testified before Congress in favor of the bill &quot;To amend title 38, United States Code, to reestablish the Professional Certification and Licensure Advisory Committee of the Department of Veterans Affairs (H.R. 2942; 113th Congress).&quot; They argued that the legislation would &quot;benefit service members, as well as those who eventually employ veterans in civilian work-force easing the placement of qualified veterans in civilian careers, and matching civilian employers with skilled veteran employees.&quot; The American Legion argued that this committee was important to the process of matching military certifications with their corresponding civilian ones, smoothing that transition for veterans, and that the committee provided much needed expertise on these matters to the VA. The Legion said that &quot;there is a definite need to resume this independent body with expertise in matters relating to licensing and credentialing which can present new solutions to VA&#x27;s senior leadership and congressional members as well as other stakeholders.&quot;

In 2014, Verna L. Jones was appointed as the first female executive director of the Legion. In August 2017, Denise H. Rohan was elected as the first female national commander of the Legion.

==Headquarters==
The national headquarters, informally known as American Legion headquarters, is located on the Indiana World War Memorial Plaza at 700 North Pennsylvania Street, Indianapolis, Indiana. It is the headquarters for the National Commander of The American Legion and also houses the archives, library, Membership, Internal Affairs, Public Relations, and &quot;The American Legion&quot; magazine&#x27;s editorial offices. The national headquarters has expanded multiple times since its establishment.

==Emblem==
The World War I Victory Button on a narrow circular band of blue enamel, containing the words &quot;American Legion&quot; in gold letters, forms the central element of the American Legion Emblem. The Legion emblem or &quot;button&quot; was officially adopted by the National Executive Committee of The American Legion on July 9, 1919.

==Eligibility==
Membership in the American Legion was originally restricted to soldiers, sailors, and marines who served honorably between April 6, 1917, and November 11, 1918. Eligibility has since been expanded to include personnel who served on active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States or armed forces associated with the U.S., between December 7, 1941, through a date of cessation of hostilities as determined by the federal government, and was an American citizen when they entered that service or continues to serve honorably. U.S. Merchant Marines who served between December 7, 1941, and December 31, 1946, are also eligible. Honorary, associate, social, or guest memberships in the Legion are not permitted. Members must be eligible through the nature and timing of their military service.

The following is a list of eligibility dates the American Legion uses to determine membership eligibility.

==Publication==
The official publication, originally known as &quot;The American Legion Weekly&quot;, launched on July 4, 1919. In 1926, the Legion Weekly reduced the frequency of publication and was renamed &quot;The American Legion Monthly&quot;. In 1936, the publication&#x27;s name and volume numbering system changed again, this time to &quot;The American Legion&quot;.

The American Legion Digital Archive online offers scans of &quot;American Legion magazine, national meeting digests, newsletters, press releases, and other publications published by the national organization.&quot;

<text>Jean-Jacques Lebel (born 30 June 1936, Paris) is a French visual artist, poet, art collector, writer, political activist, and creator of performance art happening art events. Besides his heterogeneous artworks and poetry, Lebel is also known for his very early work with the Beat Generation and Happenings, as an art theory writer with close ties to Félix Guattari, Gilles Deleuze and the American poetry and art scene. He is also an art curator and son of Robert Lebel; a poet, translator, poetry publisher, political activist, art collector, art historian and expert in the work of Marcel Duchamp. 

==Life and work==
Lebel had his first exhibition in 1955 at Galleria Numero in Florence, Italy. After a brief period of time with Surrealists, Lebel exhibited in Milan and Paris, and then went on to exhibit at various museums and galleries around the world. He has regularly collaborated with artist and writer Arnaud Labelle-Rojoux.

Beginning in 1955, Lebel published a poetry journal called &quot;Front Unique&quot; and organized various nomadic poetry festivals, such as &quot;La Libre Expression&quot; (&quot;Free Expression&quot;) in 1964 and &quot;Polyphonix&quot; in 1979. In the 1960s, Lebel translated into French and published various work by William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Michael McClure, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gregory Corso.

In 1960, Lebel oversaw and partook in the first European Happening &quot;L&#x27;enterrement de la Chose&quot; in Venice. For his performance there - called &quot;Happening Funeral Ceremony of the Anti-Process&quot; - Lebel invited the audience to attend a ceremony in formal dress. In a decorated room within a grand residence, a draped &quot;cadaver&quot; rested on a plinth which was then ritually stabbed by an &quot;executioner&quot; while a &quot;service&quot; was read consisting of extracts from the French décadent writer Joris-Karl Huysmans and le Marquis de Sade. Then pall-bearers carried the coffin out into a gondola and the &quot;body&quot; - which was in fact a mechanical sculpture by Jean Tinguely - was ceremonially slid into the canal.

During the 1960s, Lebel closely followed the work of the avant-garde American theatre group The Living Theatre. He extensively interviewed the group&#x27;s members and accompanied them during rehearsal, which would lead to the 1969 book &quot;Entretiens avec le Living Theatre.&quot;

Lebel published the first critical essay in French on the Happening movements throughout the world, citing the 1920 &quot;Dada-Messe&quot; (First International Dada Fair) as the key precedent of the modern happening in Europe. After this, he produced over 70 Happenings, performances and actions on numerous continents, including &quot;Pour conjurer l&#x27;esprit de catastrophe&quot; (1962), &quot;Déchirex&quot; (1965) and &quot;120 minutes dédiées au divin marquis&quot; (1966). In 1967 he staged in Gassin at the &quot;Festival de la Libre Expression&quot; Pablo Picasso&#x27;s 1941 surrealist theatrical farce in six acts &quot;Le Désir attrapé par la queue&quot; (&quot;Desire Caught by the Tail&quot;). For it, Lebel invited Soft Machine to perform and later that year Lebel was arrested for promoting nudity in Knokke, Belgium for a happening he did with Yoko Ono.

In 1968, Lebel took part in the activities of &quot;Mouvement du 22-mars&quot;, followed by &quot;Noir et Rouge&quot;, an anarchist group, and the Socialist splinter group &quot;Informations et Correspondences Ouvrières.&quot; Lebel also followed the philosophical teachings of Gilles Deleuze at Faculty de Vincennes at Paris 8 University. 1980 Lebel organized a &quot;Performance Festival&quot; at the ARC - Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, amongst others with Harry de Kroon, Julien Blaine, Joel Hubaut and Barbara Heinisch.

With François Pain he produced the 90 minute long &quot;Monument à Félix Guattari, le film&quot; and in 1994 he installed a large assemblage entitled &quot;Monument à Félix Guattari&quot; in the Forum of the Centre Pompidou.

Since 2001 he has frequently exhibited his &quot;Manifestation Itinérante&quot; and his digital art morphing animation &quot;Reliquaire pour un culte de Vénus&quot; that is based on the concept of &quot;vénusté&quot; as put forward by Pierre Klossowski.

In 2001, he was the guest curator at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts of the erotic work of Pablo Picasso called &quot;Picasso Erotique&quot; and appeared on the Charlie Rose show. The exhibition traveled to the Museu Picasso in Barcelona and Galerie nationale du jeu de paume in Paris. A book entitled &quot;Picasso Erotique&quot; was produced by Prestel Publishing in 2001 as a result of the show. This book contains texts by Lebel, Pablo Picasso, Annie Le Brun, Pascal Quignard, Patrick Roegiers and Malen Gual.

In 2009, La Maison Rouge in Paris presented all facets of Lebel&#x27;s work (artist, exhibition curator, writer, performer, and art festival organizer) in an exhibition entitled &quot;Jean-Jacques Lebel, Soulvements.&quot; The exhibition was divided into the following themes: Happenings, Insubordination, Poetry, Hallucination, Eros, Dada, War and the Rhizome - and was illustrated with works of primitive art, works by anonymous artists and others such as Johann Heinrich Füssli, Giuseppe Arcimboldo, Louise Michel, Charles Fourier, Ravachol, Guillaume Apollinaire, Marcel Duchamp, Pablo Picasso, Otto Dix, George Grosz, André Breton, Francis Picabia, Antonin Artaud, Victor Brauner, Bernard Heidsieck, Erró, Antonio Saura, and Peter Saul. Some three hundred works in all. The show curator was Jean de Loisy.

In 2013, Laure Adler produced an extensive radio interview with Lebel called &quot;L&#x27;iconoclaste Jean-Jacques Lebel&quot; (in 5 parts) that was broadcast on France Culture. In 2018 he co-organized at the Palais de Tokyo an exhibition on the theme of evil and repair called &quot;L’Un et l’Autre&quot; (One and the Other) and also that year was honored by a solo exhibition of his early work at the Centre Pompidou entitled &quot;l&#x27;outrepasseur&quot;.

In 2024, the Centre Pompidou presented the exhibition &quot;Chaosmose: Fonds de dotation Jean-Jacques Lebel&quot; that displays the endowment collaboration between the Jean-Jacques Lebel Endowment Fund and the Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne.

<doc id="305981" wikidata="Q13218598" url="?curid=305981" title="NatWest Group">
<text>NatWest Group plc is a British banking and insurance holding company, based in Edinburgh, Scotland.

The group operates a wide variety of banking brands offering personal and business banking, private banking, investment banking, insurance and corporate finance. In the United Kingdom, its main subsidiary companies are National Westminster Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, NatWest Markets and Coutts. The group issues banknotes in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Before the 2008 financial crisis, NatWest was very briefly the largest bank in the world, and for a period was the second-largest bank in the UK and Europe and the fifth-largest in the world by market capitalisation. Subsequently, with a slumping share price and major loss of confidence, the bank fell sharply in the rankings, although in 2009 it was briefly the world&#x27;s largest company by both assets (£1.9 trillion) and liabilities (£1.8 trillion). It was bailed out by the UK government via the 2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package.

The government retained a majority share until 28 March 2022, held and managed through UK Government Investments. It has subsequently reduced its shareholding in a series of transactions.

In addition to its primary share listing on the London Stock Exchange, the company is also listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

==History==
===The Royal Bank of Scotland Group===
By the late 1960s, economic conditions were becoming more difficult for the banking sector. In response, the National Commercial Bank of Scotland merged with the Royal Bank of Scotland. The merger resulted in a new holding company, the National and Commercial Banking Group being founded in 1968, with the merger formalised in 1969. The holding company was renamed The Royal Bank of Scotland Group in 1979 and became a public company in 1982.

The late 1990s saw a new wave of consolidation in the financial services sector. In 1999, the Bank of Scotland launched a hostile takeover bid for English rival National Westminster Bank. The Bank of Scotland intended to fund the deal by selling off many of NatWest&#x27;s subsidiary companies, including Ulster Bank and Coutts. However, the Royal Bank of Scotland subsequently tabled a counter-offer, sparking off the largest hostile takeover battle in UK corporate history. A key differentiation from the Bank of Scotland&#x27;s bid was the Royal Bank of Scotland&#x27;s plan to retain all of NatWest&#x27;s subsidiaries. Although NatWest, one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; English clearing banks, was significantly larger than either Scottish bank, it had a recent history of poor financial performance and plans to merge with insurance company Legal &amp; General were not well received, prompting a 26% fall in share price.

On 11 February 2000, The Royal Bank of Scotland was declared the winner in the takeover battle, becoming the second largest banking group in the UK after HSBC Holdings. NatWest as a distinct banking brand was retained, although many back-office functions of the bank were merged with the Royal Bank&#x27;s, leading to over 18,000 job losses throughout the UK.

===Further expansion===

In August 2005, the bank expanded into China, acquiring a 10% stake in the Bank of China for £1.7 billion, which it had sold by 2009.

In 2005, the bank built a new international headquarters at Gogarburn on the outskirts of Edinburgh, and was opened by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

The group was part of a consortium with Belgian bank Fortis and Spanish bank Banco Santander that acquired Dutch bank ABN AMRO in October 2007. Rivals speculated that RBS had overpaid for the Dutch bank although the bank pointed out that of the £49bn paid for ABN AMRO, RBS&#x27;s share was only £10bn (equivalent to £167 per citizen of the UK).

Much later, the bank announced it was to scale back its international presence. &quot;Let me spell it out very clearly: the days when RBS sought to be the biggest bank in the world, those days are well and truly over&quot;, Chief Executive Ross McEwan, who had been in charge of the bank for four months, said in unveiling plans to reduce costs by £5bn over four years. &quot;Our ambition is to be a bank for UK customers&quot;, he added.

===2007–2008 financial crisis===

On 22 April 2008, RBS announced a rights issue which aimed to raise £12 billion in new capital to offset a writedown of £5.9 billion resulting from credit market positions and to shore up its reserves following the purchase of ABN AMRO. This was, at the time, the largest rights issue in British corporate history.

The bank also announced that it would review the possibility of divesting some of its subsidiaries to raise further funds, notably its insurance divisions Direct Line and Churchill. Additionally, the bank&#x27;s stake in Tesco Bank was bought by Tesco for £950 million in 2008.

On 13 October 2008, in a move aimed at recapitalising the bank, it was announced that the British Government would take a stake of up to 58% in the Group. The aim was to &quot;make available new tier 1 capital to UK banks and building societies to strengthen their resources permitting them to restructure their finances, while maintaining their support for the real economy, through the recapitalisation scheme which has been made available to eligible institutions&quot;.

HM Treasury injected £37 billion ($64 billion, €47 billion, equivalent to £617 per citizen of the UK) of new capital into Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Lloyds TSB and HBOS, to avert financial sector collapse. The government stressed, however, that it was not &quot;standard public ownership&quot; and that the banks would return to private investors &quot;at the right time&quot;.

Alistair Darling, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, stated that the UK government would benefit from its rescue plan, for it would have some control over RBS in exchange for £5 billion in preference shares and underwriting the issuance of a further £15 billion in ordinary shares. If shareholder take-up of the share issue was 0%, then total government ownership in RBS would be 58%; and, if shareholder take-up was 100%, then total government ownership in RBS would be 0%. Less than 56 million new shares were taken up by investors, or 0.24pc of the total offered by RBS in October 2008.

As a consequence of this rescue, the chief executive of the group, Fred Goodwin, offered his resignation and it was duly accepted. Sir Tom McKillop confirmed that he would stand down from his role as chairman when his contract expired in March 2009. Goodwin was replaced by Stephen Hester, previously the chief executive of British Land, who commenced work at the Royal Bank of Scotland in November 2008.

On 19 January 2009, the British Government announced a further injection of funds into the UK banking system in an attempt to restart personal and business lending. This would involve the creation of a state-backed insurance scheme which would allow banks to insure against existing loans going into default, in an attempt to restore the banks&#x27; confidence.

At the same time the government announced its intention to convert the preference shares in RBS that it had acquired in October 2008 to ordinary shares. This would remove the 12% coupon payment (£600m p.a.) on the shares but would increase the state&#x27;s holding in the bank from 58% to 70%.

On the same day RBS released a trading statement in which it expected to post full-year trading losses (before writedowns) of between £7bn and £8bn. The group also announced writedowns on goodwills (primarily related to the takeover of Dutch bank ABN-AMRO) of around £20bn. The combined total of £28bn would be the biggest ever annual loss in UK corporate history (the actual figure was £24.1bn). As a result, during the Blue Monday Crash, the group&#x27;s share price fell over 66% in one day to 10.9p per share, from a 52-week high of 354p per share, itself a drop of 97%.

===Mid-2008 onwards===
RBS&#x27; contractual commitment to retain the 4.26% Bank of China (BoC) stake ended on 31 December 2008, and the shares were sold on 14 January 2009. Exchange rate fluctuations meant that RBS made no profit on the deal. The Scottish press suggested two reasons for the move: the need for a bank mainly owned by HM Treasury to focus scarce capital on British markets, and the growth possibility of RBS&#x27;s own China operations.

Also in March 2009, RBS revealed that its traders had been involved in the purchase and sale of sub-prime securities under the supervision of Fred Goodwin.

In September 2009, RBS and NatWest announced dramatic cuts in their overdraft fees including the unpaid item fee (from £38 to £5), the card misuse fee (from £35 to £15) and the monthly maintenance charge for going overdrawn without consent (from £28 to £20). The cuts came at a time when the row over the legality of unauthorised borrowing reached the House of Lords. The fees were estimated to earn current account providers about £2.6bn a year. The Consumers&#x27; Association chief executive, Peter Vicary-Smith, said: &quot;This is a step in the right direction and a victory for consumer pressure.&quot;

In November 2009, RBS announced plans to cut 3,700 jobs in addition to 16,000 already planned, while the government increased its stake in the company from 70% to 84%.

In December 2009, the RBS board revolted against the main shareholder, the British government. They threatened to resign unless they were permitted to pay bonuses of £1.5bn to staff in its investment arm.

More than 100 senior bank executives at the Royal Bank of Scotland were paid more than £1 million in late 2010 and total bonus payouts reached nearly £1 billion – even though the bailed-out bank reported losses of £1.1 billion for 2010. The 2010 figure was an improvement on the loss of £3.6 billion in 2009 and the record-breaking £24bn loss in 2008. The bonuses for staff in 2010 topped £950 million. The CEO Stephen Hester got £8 million in payments for the year. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite the Union, said: &quot;Taxpayers will be baffled as to how it is possible that while we own 84% of this bank it continues to so handsomely reward its investment bankers.&quot;

In October 2011, Moody&#x27;s downgraded the credit rating of 12 UK financial firms, including RBS, blaming financial weakness.

In January 2012, there was press controversy about Hester&#x27;s bonus—Hester was offered share options with a total value of £963,000 that would be held in long-term plans, and only paid out if he met strict and tough targets. If he failed to do this, it would be clawed-back. The Treasury permitted the payment because they feared the resignation of Hester and much of the board if the payment was vetoed by the government as the majority shareholder. After a large amount of criticism in the press, news emerged of Chairman Sir Philip Hampton turning down his own bonus of £1.4 million several weeks before the controversy. Hester, who had been on holiday in Switzerland at the time, turned down his own bonus shortly after.

In June 2012, a failure of an upgrade to payment processing software meant that a substantial proportion of customers could not transfer money to or from their accounts. This meant that RBS had to open a number of branches on a Sunday – the first time that they had had to do this.

RBS released a statement on 12 June 2013 that announced a transition in which CEO Stephen Hester would stand down in December 2013 for the financial institution &quot;to return to private ownership by the end of 2014&quot;. For his part in the procession of the transition, Hester would receive 12 months&#x27; pay and benefits worth £1.6 million, as well as the potential for £4 million in shares. The RBS stated that, as of the announcement, the search for Hester&#x27;s successor would commence. Ross McEwan, the head of retail banking at RBS, was selected to replace Hester in July 2013.

On 4 August 2015 the UK government began the process of selling shares back to the private sector, reducing its ownership of ordinary shares from 61.3% to 51.5% and its total economic ownership (including B shares) from 78.3% to 72.9%. On 5 June 2018 the government reduced its ownership through UK Government Investments to 62.4% at a loss of £2 billion.

===Restructuring===
In June 2008 RBS sold its subsidiary Angel Trains for £3.6bn as part of an assets sale to raise cash.

In March 2009, RBS announced the closure of its tax avoidance department, which had helped it avoid £500m of tax by channelling billions of pounds through securitised assets in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. The closure was partly due to a lack of funds to continue the measures, and partly due to the 84% government stake in the bank.

On 29 March 2010, GE Capital acquired Royal Bank of Scotland&#x27;s factoring business in Germany. GE Capital signed an agreement with the Royal Bank of Scotland PLC (RBS) to acquire 100% of RBS Factoring GmbH, RBS&#x27;s factoring and invoice financing business in Germany, for an undisclosed amount. The transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including regulatory approval.

In January 2012, due to pressure from the UK government to shut down risky operations and prepare for tougher international regulations, the bank announced it would cut 4,450 jobs and close its loss-making cash equities, corporate broking, equity capital markets, and mergers and acquisitions businesses. This move brought the total number of jobs cut since the bank was bailed out in 2008 to 34,000.

During 2012, RBS separated its insurance business from the main group to form the Direct Line Group, made up of several well-known brands including Direct Line and Churchill. RBS sold a 30% holding in the group through an initial public offering in October 2012. Further shares sales in 2013 reduced RBS&#x27; holding to 28.5% by September 2013, and RBS sold its remaining shares in February 2014.

In October 2015, RBS sold its remaining stake in Citizens Financial Group, having progressively reduced its stake through an initial public offering (IPO) started in 2014.

===Williams &amp; Glyn divestment===

As a condition of the British Government purchasing an 81% shareholding in the group, the European Commission ruled that the group sell a portion of its business, as the purchase was categorised as state aid. In August 2010, the group reached an agreement to sell 318 branches to Santander UK, made up of the RBS branches in England and Wales and the NatWest branches in Scotland. Santander withdrew from the sale on 12 October 2012.

In September 2013, the group confirmed it had reached an agreement to sell 314 branches to the Corsair consortium, made up of private equity firms and a number of institutional investors, including the Church Commissioners, which controls the property and investment assets of the Church of England. The branches, incorporating 250,000 small business customers, 1,200 medium business customers and 1.8 million personal banking customers, were due to be separated from the group in 2016 as a standalone business. The planned company would have traded as an ethical bank, using the dormant Williams &amp; Glyn&#x27;s brand.

In August 2016, RBS cancelled its plan to spin off Williams &amp; Glyn as a separate business, stating that the new bank could not survive independently. It revealed it would instead seek to sell the operation to another bank.

In February 2017, HM Treasury suggested that the bank should abandon the plan to sell the operation, and instead focus on initiatives to boost competition within business banking in the United Kingdom. This plan was formally approved by the European Commission in September 2017.

===2020 group rebranding===
On 14 February 2020, it was announced that RBS Group was to be renamed NatWest Group, taking the brand under which the majority of its business is delivered. On 16 July 2020 the company announced that the rebrand would take place on 22 July 2020. The change took effect on 23 July 2020. The NatWest Group is likely to remain state-owned until March 2025, a deadline which the UK Treasury has announced for selling all government shares in the business.

===Further Government share sales===
The government reduced its holding in NatWest to 59.8% in March 2021, losing the taxpayer £1.8bn, followed by a further sale in May 2021 bringing it to 54.8%. The government announced that a further sale would take place in late 2021 (bringing the holding down to 50.6%) and a sale in March 2022 reduced it further to 48.1%. Following a buyback by the NatWest Group in May 2023, the government reduced its holding in the company to 38.6%. Regulatory filings showed the government had reduced its holding to 34.96% by February 2024. The holding fell to 29.82% in March 2024. On 31 May 2024 the government announced a further £1.24bn worth of shares sold back to NatWest after a plan to sell to the public was frozen due to the 2024 general election; this brought the government&#x27;s ownership of NatWest down to 22.5%. By late July 2024, the shareholding had been reduced to 19.97%. On 11 November 2024 the government sold a further £1bn of its shares back to NatWest, taking its holding down from 14.2% to 11.4%. By mid December 2024 it was down to 9.99%.

==Controversies==

===Media commentary and criticism===
During Goodwin&#x27;s tenure as CEO, he attracted some criticism for lavish spending, including on the construction of a £350m headquarters in Edinburgh opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005 and a $500m headquarters in the US begun in 2006, and the use of a Dassault Falcon 900 jet owned by leasing subsidiary Lombard for occasional corporate travel.

In February 2009, RBS reported that, while Fred Goodwin was at the helm, it had posted a loss of £24.1bn, the biggest loss in UK corporate history. His responsibility for the expansion of RBS, which led to the losses, has drawn widespread criticism. His image was not enhanced by the news that emerged in questioning by the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons on 10 February 2009, that Goodwin has no technical bank training, and has no formal banking qualifications.

In January 2009, &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s City editor, Julia Finch, identified him as one of twenty-five people who were at the heart of the financial meltdown. Nick Cohen described Goodwin in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;the characteristic villain of our day&quot;, who made £20m from RBS and left the government &quot;with an unlimited liability for the cost of cleaning up the mess&quot;. An online column by Daniel Gross labelled Goodwin &quot;The World&#x27;s Worst Banker&quot;, a phrase echoed elsewhere in the media. Gordon Prentice MP argued that his knighthood should be revoked as it is &quot;wholly inappropriate and anomalous for someone to retain such a reward in these circumstances.&quot;

Other members have also frequently been criticised as &quot;fat cats&quot; over their salary, expenses, bonuses and pensions.

===Fossil fuel financing===
RBS provides the financial means for companies to build coal-fired power stations and dig new coal mines at sites throughout the world. RBS helped to provide an estimated £8 billion from 2006 to 2008 to energy corporation E.ON and other coal-utilising companies.

====Canadian oil sands====
Climate Camp activists criticise RBS for funding firms which extract oil from Canadian oil sands. The Cree indigenous people describe RBS as being complicit in &quot;the biggest environmental crime on the planet&quot;. In 2012, 7.2% of RBS&#x27; total oil and gas lending was to companies who derived more than 10% of their income from oil sands operations.

===Huntingdon Life Sciences===
In 2000 and 2001, staff of the bank were threatened over its provision of banking facilities for the animal-testing company Huntingdon Life Sciences. The intimidation resulted in RBS withdrawing the company&#x27;s overdraft facility, requiring the company to obtain alternative funding within a tight deadline.

===Nigel Farage===

In July 2023, former MEP Nigel Farage had his account closed by Coutts, according to a report by the BBC, for failing to meet the required minimums. However, revelations published in The Daily Telegraph newspaper disproved the BBC&#x27;s report and showed that financially Farage&#x27;s accounts&#x27; &quot;economic contribution is now sufficient to retain on a commercial basis&quot;, and that the accounts were closed after an internal risk committee at Coutts judged his &quot;views were at odds with our position as an inclusive organisation&quot;. CEO Dame Alison Rose resigned after admitting to being the source of the inaccurate BBC report and for suggesting that his accounts had been closed only for commercial rather than any political reasons, and for this being a breach of client confidentiality.

=== Regulatory breaches ===
To date NatWest has paid total penalties of £703,562,895 in fines for UK regulatory breaches between 2010 and 2023, making it one of the most penalised parent companies in the UK according to the website Violation Tracker UK.

In the US it has incurred total penalties of over $14 billion for corporate infringements between 2000 and 2023.

=== Staff Messaging ===
In November 2024, NatWest Group blocked WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Skype on company devices in the UK to stop staff using them to communicate with each other due to security concerns.

The initiative of banning certain apps for staff communication came into existence after fines of more than $2.5 billion levied against other banks in the United States. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup were among other banks who were issued with penalties for the misuse of record-keeping-rules.

<text>Nadia Younes (; June 13, 1946 – August 19, 2003) was an Egyptian national who spent her entire career, for over 33 years, in the United Nations (UN) and the World Health Organization, rising to high-level posts in a variety of areas.

She was born in Cairo, Egypt, and earned a Master of Arts degree in political science and international relations from New York University, and a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature from Cairo University. She spoke French, English and Arabic fluently.

==Career in the United Nations==
Nadia Younes joined the United Nations in 1970. From 1974, she worked with the Department of Public Information in various capacities, initially as a press officer in both the English and French Sections. Later assignments included Information Officer for the World Conference of the Decade for Women; Information Office, Planning, Programme and Evaluation Unit; and Spokeswoman for the President of the Forty-Second Session of the General Assembly.

Younes served as Deputy Spokeswoman for the Secretary-General from March 1988 until January 1993, when she was appointed Director of the United Nations Information Centre in Rome. She subsequently moved back to New York City to assume the post of Director of the Media Division in the Department of Public Information.

She worked as United Nations Chief of Protocol from 1998. From July 1999 to January 2001, she worked in the field mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) where she was in charge of the information and communication office in the Cabinet of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Bernard Kouchner. Following her assignment in Kosovo, Younes returned to New York and resumed her functions as Chief of Protocol.

In August 2002, Younes was appointed as WHO’s Executive Director in charge of External Relations and Governing Bodies. Her position included responsibility for relations with WHO’s Member States, resource mobilization and WHO’s governing bodies.

In May 2003, she was seconded by WHO to act as Chief of Staff for the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General to Iraq, Sérgio Vieira de Mello, in Baghdad. Younes died from wounds sustained in the Canal Hotel bombing on August 19, 2003, along with de Mello and 21 other members of his office staff.

WHO&#x27;s official tribute to her reads in part &quot;...&quot;WHO mourns the loss of one of its most respected, effective and charismatic officials&quot;. The Reuters news agency referred to her as &quot;witty&quot; and &quot;with a sharp sense of humor&quot;&quot;.

She was buried in Cairo, Egypt.

<doc id="305983" wikidata="Q1016648" url="?curid=305983" title="Burlington Northern Railroad">
<text>The Burlington Northern Railroad was a United States–based railroad company formed from a merger of four major U.S. railroads. Burlington Northern operated between 1970 and 1995.

Its historical lineage begins in the earliest days of railroading with the chartering in 1848 of the Chicago and Aurora Railroad, a direct ancestor line of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, which lends Burlington to the names of various merger-produced successors.

Burlington Northern acquired the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway on December 31, 1996, to form the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (later renamed BNSF Railway), which was owned by the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation. That corporation was purchased in 2009 by Berkshire Hathaway, which is controlled by investor Warren Buffett.

==History==
The Burlington Northern Railroad was the product of the merger of four major railroads: the Great Northern Railway (GN), the Northern Pacific Railway (NP), the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway (SP&amp;S) and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&amp;Q).

The four railroads shared a very intertwined history, due to the efforts of James J. Hill, the railroad tycoon who had founded the Great Northern Railway. Hill purchased an interest in the Northern Pacific in 1896 as the railway endured a period of financial turmoil. Hill attempted to merge the two railways but was rebuffed by the leaders of the Northern Pacific.

In 1901, the two railways teamed up to purchase nearly all shares of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, giving both a needed connection to Chicago, the nation&#x27;s railroad hub. That same year, came the next attempt to merge the railroads with the establishment of the Northern Securities Company, a trust that controlled all three, with Hill serving as president. The company was sued in 1902 under the Sherman Antitrust Act and in 1904 the Justice Department won in the Supreme Court ruling &quot;Northern Securities Co. v. United States.&quot;

Although the ruling forced the three companies to be operated independently, they were still closely linked, even sharing a headquarters building, the Railroad and Bank Building in Saint Paul, Minnesota. In 1905, the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway was founded. Like the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, this new railroad was co-owned by the Great Northern and Northern Pacific and allowed both to access Portland via the Columbia River Gorge. Leaders attempted to merge another two times, in 1927 and 1955, but were unsuccessful.

The four railroads were finally cleared to merge on March 2, 1970, after a legal challenge that once again went to the Supreme Court. By that time, the GN&#x27;s president was John M. Budd, the NP&#x27;s president was Louis W. Menk, and the CB&amp;Q&#x27;s president was William John Quinn. Under the leadership of Budd and Menk, the newly established holding company, Burlington Northern, Inc. purchased the four railroads and merged them into the Burlington Northern Railroad. Budd became the company&#x27;s first board chairman and CEO while Menk became the company&#x27;s first president and COO.

To further expand the Burlington Northern, a single track was constructed in 1972 into the Powder River Basin to serve various coal mines. The expansion was a source of traffic unprecedented in United States railroad history. In 1971, the first full year for the new railroad, trains carried 64,116 million revenue ton-miles of freight, by 1979 the total was 135,004 million. Most of the increase was attributed to Powder River coal from Wyoming.

The Burlington Northern, along with handling freight trains, briefly operated inter-city passenger trains. The BN had started operations just a matter of weeks before the end of service of the original &quot;California Zephyr&quot;, which had been operated by the CB&amp;Q, in conjunction with the Denver and Rio Grande Western and Western Pacific railroads, and continued to operate the &quot;North Coast Limited&quot;, &quot;Mainstreeter&quot;, &quot;Empire Builder&quot;, &quot;Western Star&quot;, &quot;Denver Zephyr&quot;, &quot;Gopher&quot;, and &quot;International&quot;, until Amtrak took over intercity passenger service in May 1971, thus becoming the last &quot;new&quot; Class I railroad to operate its own passenger trains. The BN also operated a commuter line inherited from the CB&amp;Q from Aurora, Illinois to Chicago Union Station. This line is still owned and operated to this day by the BNSF Railway under a purchase-of-service agreement with Metra.

In May 1980 when Mount St. Helens erupted, the BN owned the land around the summit of Mount St. Helens in Washington state. In the 19th century, the United States government distributed land to railroads as a way to open up the American West and the peak was granted to the Northern Pacific. It was inherited in the 1970 merger by Burlington Northern. Following the eruption the land including the volcano was subsequently transferred in a land swap between the railroad and the United States Forest Service so the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument could be established.

On November 21, 1980, the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway was acquired, giving the railroad trackage as far south as Florida.

In the early 1980s two independently operated railroads, owned by Burlington Northern Inc. were absorbed into the Burlington Northern Railroad; the Colorado and Southern Railway was absorbed in 1981, followed by the Fort Worth and Denver Railway in 1982.

The railroad relocated its headquarters from Saint Paul to Seattle, Washington in 1981, as well as its parent company and sister companies.

All of Burlington Northern, Inc&#x27;s non-rail operations were spun off to a new company, Burlington Resources in 1988.

The railroad once again relocated its headquarters in 1988, moving from Seattle to Fort Worth, Texas.

On September 22, 1995, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway merged with the Burlington Northern to create the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway. However, the merger was not official until December 31, 1996, when a common dispatching system was established, Santa Fe&#x27;s non-union dispatchers were unionized and the implementation of Santa Fe&#x27;s train identification codes systemwide. On January 24, 2005, the railroad shortened its name to BNSF Railway.

==Route==
The Burlington Northern traversed the most northerly routes of any railroad in the western United States. These routes started at Chicago, Illinois and ran west-northwest to La Crosse, Wisconsin. From here the routes continued northwest through Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota to Grand Forks, North Dakota. From Grand Forks the routes ran west through North Dakota, Montana, and Idaho to Spokane, Washington. The former GN routed through North Dakota/Northern Montana, crossing the continental divide at Marias Pass, while the former NP line routed through the southern part of Montana (which was spun off to Montana Rail Link in 1987), crossing the continental divide at Mullan and Homestake Passes. At Spokane the routes split into three. The former Great Northern route ran west to Wenatchee, Washington, crossed under the Cascade Range at New Cascade Tunnel on Stevens Pass, and descended to the Puget Sound region through Everett, Washington. The former Northern Pacific turned southwest towards the Tri-Cities, then northwest to Yakima, Washington, and crossed under the Cascade Range at Stampede Tunnel, descending to the Green River Valley at Auburn, Washington where it connected with existing NP lines from British Columbia to Portland, Oregon. The Spokane, Portland and Seattle ran southwest to the Tri-Cities, then followed the north bank of the Columbia River to Vancouver, Washington.With the acquisition of the St. Louis – San Francisco Railway the route was extended into the South Central and Southeastern United States.

&quot;Transport Statistics&quot; shows BN operated 23609 miles of line and 34691 miles of track at the end of 1970; it shows 4547 SLSF miles of line not including QA&amp;P and AT&amp;N. At the end of 1981 BN showed of line and of track.

At the time of the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, the summit of the volcano that was owned by Burlington Northern. Following the eruption, Burlington Northern agreed to a land swap with the U.S. government and exchanged its square mile (2.59 square kilometer) of land on the mountain for national forest land elsewhere to allow for the creation of the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument to preserve the volcano and allow for its aftermath to be scientifically studied.

<text>Tracy Ann Austin Holt (born December 12, 1962) is an American former professional tennis player. She was ranked as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s singles by the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA) for 21 weeks. Austin won 30 WTA Tour-level singles titles, including two major titles at the 1979 and 1981 US Opens, as well as five doubles titles, including the mixed doubles title at the 1980 Wimbledon Championships, partnering her brother John. Additionally, she won the 1980 WTA Tour Championships and the year-ending 1981 Toyota Championships, both in singles.

Austin remains the youngest US Open women&#x27;s singles champion (aged 16) and the youngest inductee into the International Tennis Hall of Fame at age 29. A series of injuries and a serious automobile accident in 1989 cut short her professional career.

Tracy Austin was born December 12, 1962, in Palos Verdes Peninsula, California. Her parents were George and Jeanne Austin.

==Career==
===1977 to 1980===
In January 1977, a month after turning fourteen, Austin won her first professional singles title, defeating Stacy Margolin at the Avon Futures event in Portland. As an amateur she could not accept the prize money. At her Wimbledon debut in 1977 she reached the third round where she lost to top-seeded Chris Evert. In September, she made her US Open debut and reached the quarterfinal, falling to fifth-seeded Betty Stöve.

Less than two months before her sixteenth birthday, Austin turned professional in October 1978. That same month, she won her first professional singles title, defeating Betty Stöve in the final of the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Filderstadt, West Germany.

Austin followed up with tournament wins in Tokyo and Washington, defeating Martina Navratilova in both finals. She defeated 35-year-old Billie Jean King in the quarterfinals of the 1979 Wimbledon Championships, then lost to eventual champion Navratilova in straight sets in the semifinals. In September, Austin became the youngest-ever US Open champion, aged 16 years and 9 months, by defeating second-seeded Navratilova in the semifinals and top seed Chris Evert in the final. Evert had been attempting to win the title for the fifth consecutive year. Earlier that year, Austin ended Evert&#x27;s 125-match winning streak on clay by beating her in three sets in a semifinal of the Italian Open.

The Associated Press named Austin its Female Athlete of the Year for 1979.

Austin lost in the semifinals of both Grand Slam tournaments she played in 1980. Evonne Goolagong Cawley, seeded fourth and the eventual champion, defeated Austin at the Wimbledon Championships. As the top seed and defending champion at the US Open, Austin was expected to extend her five-match winning streak against third-ranked Evert. Austin took a 4–0 lead in the first set before Evert won 16 of the final 20 games to win the match. Evert went on to defeat Hana Mandlíková in the final. Austin was ranked the world No. 1 singles player in 1980 for two weeks (April 7–20) and then for 19 weeks (July 7-November 17), partly because she captured the two tour-ending events. Austin defeated Navratilova to win the Avon Championships in March and Andrea Jaeger to capture the 1980 Colgate Series Championships in January 1981. In 1980, Austin won the Wimbledon mixed doubles title with her brother John, becoming the first brother and sister team to win a Grand Slam title together.

===1981 to 1983===
During the first four months of 1981, Austin played only two events because of chronic injuries. On grass, she defended her singles title at the Eastbourne International in the United Kingdom in June without losing a set. After Wimbledon, Austin won 26 consecutive matches and four consecutive tournaments. She defeated Pam Shriver in the final of the Wells Fargo Open in San Diego, and three weeks later, she beat both Navratilova and Evert in straight sets to win the Canadian Open in Toronto. As the third-seeded player at the US Open, Austin defeated fourth-seeded Navratilova in a three-set final. Navratilova, however, ended Austin&#x27;s winning streak in the final of the U.S. Indoor Championships. In Europe during the autumn, Austin lost to Sue Barker in the quarterfinals of the Brighton International in Brighton, United Kingdom, but recovered the following week to defeat Navratilova in the final of the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, West Germany. At the final Grand Slam tournament of the year, Austin was seeded second but lost to sixth-seeded Shriver in the Australian Open quarterfinals. The 1981 year-ending Toyota Series Championships featured two matches against Evert and one against Navratilova. Evert won her round-robin match with Austin, then Austin defeated Evert in their semifinal. Austin won the tournament with a three-set defeat of Navratilova. The Associated Press named Austin its 1981 Female Athlete of the Year for the second time.

Austin was the first opponent of Steffi Graf when the German made her professional debut at the 1982 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart. Austin defeated the 13-year-old Graf 6–4, 6–0.

Back injuries and recurring sciatica then began to impair Austin&#x27;s effectiveness and sidelined her for long stretches. Billie Jean King, seeded twelfth, upset third-seeded Austin in the 1982 Wimbledon quarterfinals. Several weeks later, however, Austin won her 30th and final top-level singles title in San Diego. Austin had a good showing at the 1982 season-ending Toyota Series Championships where she defeated Jaeger, the world No. 3, in straight sets to reach the semifinals. However, she was unable to repeat 1981&#x27;s victory over Evert, who defeated her in the semifinals.

In 1983, she was the runner-up at the Family Circle Cup, losing the final to Navratilova in three sets. She also reached the quarterfinals of the French Open.

===1984 to 1989===
Austin played sporadically from 1984 to 1987 and tried yet another comeback on the tour in 1988 when she played in seven doubles tournaments, and in 1989, when she played in one doubles and two singles tournaments. A highlight of this comeback included a semifinal showing in the 1988 US Open mixed doubles with partner Ken Flach. This comeback was ended by a near-fatal motor vehicle accident in Millburn, New Jersey, on August 3, 1989. A van coming from the opposite direction crashed into her vehicle&#x27;s driver side, and she suffered a bruised heart, a bruised spleen, a sprained back and a shattered knee.

===1992 to 1994===
In 1992, Austin became the youngest person to be inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, at the age of 29. She attempted a second comeback in 1993 and 1994 but was not particularly successful. In 1993, Austin upset Rennae Stubbs and Katerina Maleeva at the Evert Cup in Indian Wells, California, then lost to Stephanie Rottier. At the WTA Manhattan Beach event, she upset Gigi Fernández and Elena Likhovtseva, then lost to Gabriela Sabatini in the round of 16. Her wins over Maleeva, Fernandez, and Likhovtseva began a buzz that Austin might become at least a top 20 player again. However, in 1994, her results were not as promising and at the Evert Cup in Indian Wells, California, Austin lost in the second round to Steffi Graf, and Austin soon retired in June 1994.

===Playing style===
Austin possessed a solid baseline game, with a strong flat-hit forehand and reliable two-handed backhand. Her favorite shot was the backhand down the line and she considered her backhand to be more powerful and accurate than her forehand.

She had excellent court coverage and struck the ball deep, with substantial pace, and with pinpoint accuracy.

Austin&#x27;s first serve was a mid-paced high percentage shot that functioned well on all playing surfaces, and although her second serve has been described as lacking penetration, she rarely double faulted.

==Post-tennis career==
Since retiring as a player, Austin has worked as a commentator for NBC and the USA Network for the French Open and the US Open. During the 2000s, she worked for the Seven Network, which broadcast the Australian Open and usually participates in the BBC&#x27;s Wimbledon coverage. She began working for the Tennis Channel in 2010 and joined its US Open team and later its Australian Open team in 2012. Austin has worked for Canadian television for its coverage of the Rogers Cup since 2004.

==Personal life==
Austin is married to mortgage broker Scott Holt and is the mother of three sons: Sean, Brandon, and Dylan. Brandon Holt is also a professional tennis player and was previously a member of the USC tennis team.

Austin&#x27;s older sister Pam and her brothers Jeff, Doug and John were professional tennis players. She is the sister-in-law of fitness author Denise Austin, who is married to Jeff.

<doc id="305992" wikidata="Q580078" url="?curid=305992" title="Regenerative braking">
<text>Regenerative braking is an energy recovery mechanism that slows down a moving vehicle or object by converting its kinetic energy or potential energy into a form that can be either used immediately or stored until needed.

Typically, regenerative brakes work by driving an electric motor in reverse to recapture energy that would otherwise be lost as heat during braking, effectively turning the traction motor into a generator. Feeding power backwards through the system like this allows the energy harvested from deceleration to resupply an energy storage solution such as a battery or a capacitor. Once stored, this power can then be later used to aid forward propulsion. Because of the electrified vehicle architecture required for such a braking system, automotive regenerative brakes are most commonly found on hybrid and electric vehicles.

This method contrasts with conventional braking systems, where excess kinetic energy is converted to unwanted and wasted heat due to friction in the brakes. Similarly, with rheostatic brakes, energy is recovered by using electric motors as generators but is immediately dissipated as heat in resistors.

In addition to improving the overall efficiency of the vehicle, regeneration can significantly extend the life of the braking system. This is because the traditional mechanical parts like discs, calipers, and pads – included for when regenerative braking alone is insufficient to safely stop the vehicle – will not wear out as quickly as they would in a vehicle relying solely on traditional brakes.

== General principle ==
The most common form of regenerative brake involves an electric motor functioning as an electric generator. In electric railways, the electricity generated is fed back into the traction power supply. In battery electric and hybrid electric vehicles, the energy is stored chemically in a battery, electrically in a bank of capacitors, or mechanically in a rotating flywheel. Hydraulic hybrid vehicles use hydraulic motors to store energy in the form of compressed air. In a hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicle, the electrical energy generated by the motor is stored chemically in a battery, similar to battery and hybrid electric vehicles.

===Practical regenerative braking===
Regenerative braking is not by itself sufficient as the sole means of safely bringing a vehicle to a standstill, or slowing it as required, so it must be used in conjunction with another braking system such as friction-based braking.

* The regenerative braking effect drops off at lower speeds and cannot bring a vehicle to a complete halt reasonably quickly with current technology. However, some cars, like the Chevrolet Bolt, can bring the vehicle to a complete stop on level surfaces when the driver knows the vehicle&#x27;s regenerative braking distance. This is referred to as One Pedal Driving (OPD).
* Some current regenerative brakes do not immobilize a stationary vehicle; physical locking is required, for example, to prevent vehicles from rolling down hills. Some cars, like the Chevrolet Bolt, can remain stationary on small slopes using only the motor.
* Many road vehicles with regenerative braking do not have drive motors on all wheels (as in a two-wheel drive car); regenerative braking is normally only applicable to wheels with motors. For safety, the ability to brake all wheels is required.
* The regenerative braking effect available is limited, and mechanical braking is still necessary for substantial speed reductions or to bring a vehicle to a stop.
* On steep hills with real traffic speeds, the magnitude of potential energy recoverable during the descent of a vehicle at a slower speed than its terminal speed is substantially greater than that recoverable by bringing the vehicle from even the terminal speed to a complete stop. An example used by bicyclists is that during the descent of a hill, approximately three hair dryers&#x27; worth of power or some two horsepower is lost to Air drag at terminal speeds. 

Regenerative and friction braking must both be used, creating the need to control them to produce the required total braking. The GM EV-1 was the first commercial car to do this. In 1997 and 1998, engineers Abraham Farag and Loren Majersik were issued two patents for this &quot;brake-by-wire&quot; technology.

Early applications commonly suffered from a serious safety hazard: in many early electric vehicles with regenerative braking, the same controller positions were used to apply power and to apply the regenerative brake, with the functions being swapped by a separate manual switch. This led to a number of serious accidents when drivers accidentally accelerated when intending to brake, such as the runaway train accident in Wädenswil, Switzerland in 1948, which killed twenty-one people.

In the 2020s, most vehicles equipped with regenerative braking can completely halt reasonably quickly in One Pedal Driving mode. Some car models do not illuminate the braking light when engaging in regenerative braking, leading to safety concerns. Most regulations do not mandate the illumination of a braking light when the vehicle decelerates through regenerative braking. The One Pedal Driving (OPD) mode also lead to concerns over sudden unintended acceleration (SUA), as the driver could confuse the accelerator as the brake in stressful situations when the latter is seldomly used during OPD driving.

== Conversion to electric energy: the motor as a generator ==
Electric motors, when used in reverse, function as generators and will then convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. Vehicles propelled by electric motors use them as generators when using regenerative braking, braking by transferring mechanical energy from the wheels to an electrical load.

== History ==
In 1886 the Sprague Electric Railway &amp; Motor Company, founded by Frank J. Sprague, introduced two important inventions: a constant-speed, non-sparking motor with fixed brushes, and regenerative braking.

Early examples of this system in road vehicles were the front-wheel drive conversions of horse-drawn cabs by Louis Antoine Krieger in Paris in the 1890s. The Krieger electric landaulet had a drive motor in each front wheel with a second set of parallel windings (bifilar coil) for regenerative braking. The Orwell Electric Truck introduced by Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies in England during WW1 used regenerative braking switched in by the driver.

In England, &quot;automatic regenerative control&quot; was introduced to tramway operators by John S. Raworth&#x27;s Traction Patents 1903–1908, offering them economic and operational benefits

 as explained in some detail by his son Alfred Raworth.
These included tramway systems at Devonport (1903), Rawtenstall, Birmingham, Crystal Palace-Croydon (1906), and many others. Slowing the speed of the cars or keeping it in control on descending gradients, the motors worked as generators and braked the vehicles. The tram cars also had wheel brakes and track slipper brakes which could stop the tram should the electric braking systems fail. In several cases the tram car motors were shunt wound instead of series wound, and the systems on the Crystal Palace line utilized series-parallel controllers. Following a serious accident at Rawtenstall, an embargo was placed on this form of traction in 1911; the regenerative braking system was reintroduced twenty years later.

Regenerative braking has been in extensive use on railways for many decades. The Baku-Tbilisi-Batumi railway (Transcaucasus Railway or Georgian railway) started utilizing regenerative braking in the early 1930s. This was especially effective on the steep and dangerous Surami Pass. In Scandinavia the Kiruna to Narvik electrified railway, known as Malmbanan on the Swedish side and Ofoten Line on the Norwegian, carries iron ore on the steeply-graded route from the mines in Kiruna, in the north of Sweden, down to the port of Narvik in Norway to this day. The rail cars are full of thousands of tons of iron ore on the way down to Narvik, and these trains generate large amounts of electricity by regenerative braking, with a maximum recuperative braking force of 750 kN. From Riksgränsen on the national border to the Port of Narvik, the trains use only a fifth of the power they regenerate. The regenerated energy is sufficient to power the empty trains back up to the national border. Any excess energy from the railway is pumped into the power grid to supply homes and businesses in the region, and the railway is a net generator of electricity.

Electric cars used regenerative braking since the earliest experiments, but this initially required the driver to flip switches between various operational modes in order to use it. The Baker Electric Runabout and the Owen Magnetic were early examples, which used many switches and modes controlled by an expensive &quot;black box&quot; or &quot;drum switch&quot; as part of their electrical system. These, like the Krieger design, could only practically be used on downhill portions of a trip, and had to be manually engaged.

Improvements in electronics allowed this process to be fully automated, starting with 1967&#x27;s AMC Amitron experimental electric car. Designed by Gulton Industries the motor controller automatically began battery charging when the brake pedal was applied. Many modern hybrid and electric vehicles use this technique to extend the range of the battery pack, especially those using an AC drive train (most earlier designs used DC power).

An AC/DC rectifier and a very large capacitor may be used to store the regenerated energy, rather than a battery. The use of a capacitor allows much more rapid peak storage of energy, and at higher voltages. Mazda used this system in some 2018 cars, where it is branded i-ELOOP.

== Electric railways ==
During braking, the traction motor connections are altered to turn them into electrical generators. The motor fields are connected across the main traction generator (MG) and the motor armatures are connected across the load. The MG now excites the motor fields. The rolling locomotive or multiple unit wheels turn the motor armatures, and the motors act as generators, either sending the generated current through onboard resistors (dynamic braking) or back into the supply (regenerative braking). Compared to electro-pneumatic friction brakes, braking with the traction motors can be regulated faster improving the performance of wheel slide protection.

For a given direction of travel, current flow through the motor armatures during braking will be opposite to that during motoring. Therefore, the motor exerts torque in a direction that is opposite from the rolling direction.

Braking effort is proportional to the product of the magnetic strength of the field windings, multiplied by that of the armature windings.

Savings of 17%, and less wear on friction braking components, are claimed for British Rail Class 390s. The Delhi Metro reduced the amount of carbon dioxide () released into the atmosphere by around 90,000 tons by regenerating 112,500 megawatt hours of electricity through the use of regenerative braking systems between 2004 and 2007. It was expected that the Delhi Metro would reduce its emissions by over 100,000 tons of per year once its phase II was complete, through the use of regenerative braking.

Electricity generated by regenerative braking may be fed back into the traction power supply; either offset against other electrical demand on the network at that instant, used for head end power loads, or stored in lineside storage systems for later use.

A form of what can be described as regenerative braking is used on some parts of the London Underground, achieved by having small slopes leading up and down from stations. The train is slowed by the climb, and then leaves down a slope, so kinetic energy is converted to gravitational potential energy in the station. This is normally found on the deep tunnel sections of the network and not generally above ground or on the cut and cover sections of the Metropolitan and District Lines.

== Comparison of dynamic and regenerative brakes ==

What are described as dynamic brakes (&quot;rheostatic brakes&quot; in British English) on electric traction systems, unlike regenerative brakes, dissipate electric energy as heat rather than using it, by passing the current through large banks of resistors. Vehicles that use dynamic brakes include forklift trucks, diesel-electric locomotives, and trams. This heat can be used to warm the vehicle interior, or dissipated externally by large radiator-like cowls to house the resistor banks.

General Electric&#x27;s experimental 1936 steam turbine locomotives featured true regeneration. These two locomotives ran the steam water over the resistor packs, as opposed to air cooling used in most dynamic brakes. This energy displaced the oil normally burned to keep the water hot, and thereby recovered energy that could be used to accelerate again.

The main disadvantage of regenerative brakes when compared with dynamic brakes is the need to closely match the generated current with the supply characteristics and increased maintenance cost of the lines. With DC supplies, this requires that the voltage be closely controlled. The AC power supply and frequency converter pioneer Miro Zorič and his first AC power electronics have also enabled this to be possible with AC supplies. The supply frequency must also be matched (this mainly applies to locomotives where an AC supply is rectified for DC motors).

In areas where there is a constant need for power unrelated to moving the vehicle, such as electric train heat or air conditioning, this load requirement can be utilized as a sink for the recovered energy via modern AC traction systems. This method has become popular with North American passenger railroads where head end power loads are typically in the area of 500 kW year round. Using HEP loads in this way has prompted recent electric locomotive designs such as the ALP-46 and ACS-64 to eliminate the use of dynamic brake resistor grids and also eliminates any need for any external power infrastructure to accommodate power recovery allowing self-powered vehicles to employ regenerative braking as well.

A small number of steep grade railways have used 3-phase power supplies and induction motors. This results in a near constant speed for all trains, as the motors rotate with the supply frequency both when driving and braking.

== Kinetic energy recovery systems ==

Kinetic energy recovery systems (KERS) were used for the motor sport Formula One&#x27;s 2009 season, and are under development for road vehicles. KERS was abandoned for the 2010 Formula One season, but re-introduced for the 2011 season. By 2013, all teams were using KERS with Marussia F1 starting use for the 2013 season. One of the main reasons that not all cars used KERS immediately is because it raises the car&#x27;s center of gravity, and reduces the amount of ballast that is available to balance the car so that it is more predictable when turning. FIA rules also limit the exploitation of the system. The concept of transferring the vehicle&#x27;s kinetic energy using flywheel energy storage was postulated by physicist Richard Feynman in the 1950s and is exemplified in such systems as the Zytek, Flybrid, Torotrak and Xtrac used in F1. Differential based systems also exist such as the Cambridge Passenger/Commercial Vehicle Kinetic Energy Recovery System (CPC-KERS).

Xtrac and Flybrid are both licensees of Torotrak&#x27;s technologies, which employ a small and sophisticated ancillary gearbox incorporating a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The CPC-KERS is similar as it also forms part of the driveline assembly. However, the whole mechanism including the flywheel sits entirely in the vehicle&#x27;s hub (looking like a drum brake). In the CPC-KERS, a differential replaces the CVT and transfers torque between the flywheel, drive wheel and road wheel.

== Motor sports ==


The first of these systems to be revealed was the Flybrid. This system weighs 24 kg and has an energy capacity of 400 kJ after allowing for internal losses. A maximum power boost of for 6.67 seconds is available. The 240 mm diameter flywheel weighs 5.0 kg and revolves at up to 64,500 rpm. Maximum torque is 18 Nm (13.3 ftlbs). The system occupies a volume of 13 litres.

=== Formula One ===
Formula One have stated that they support responsible solutions to the world&#x27;s environmental challenges, and the FIA allowed the use of KERS in the regulations for the 2009 Formula One season. Teams began testing systems in 2008: energy can either be stored as mechanical energy (as in a flywheel) or as electrical energy (as in a battery or supercapacitor).

Two minor incidents were reported during testing of KERS systems in . The first occurred when the Red Bull Racing team tested their KERS battery for the first time in July: it malfunctioned and caused a fire scare that led to the team&#x27;s factory being evacuated. The second was less than a week later when a BMW Sauber mechanic was given an electric shock when he touched Christian Klien&#x27;s KERS-equipped car during a test at the Jerez circuit.

With the introduction of KERS in the 2009 season, four teams used it at some point in the season: Ferrari, Renault, BMW, and McLaren. During the season, Renault and BMW stopped using the system. McLaren Mercedes became the first team to win a F1 GP using a KERS equipped car when Lewis Hamilton won the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix on 26 July 2009. Their second KERS equipped car finished fifth. At the following race, Lewis Hamilton became the first driver to take pole position with a KERS car, his teammate, Heikki Kovalainen qualifying second. This was also the first instance of an all KERS front row. On 30 August 2009, Kimi Räikkönen won the Belgian Grand Prix with his KERS equipped Ferrari. It was the first time that KERS contributed directly to a race victory, with second placed Giancarlo Fisichella claiming &quot;Actually, I was quicker than Kimi. He only took me because of KERS at the beginning&quot;.

Although KERS was still legal in Formula 1 in the 2010 season, all the teams had agreed not to use it. New rules for the 2011 F1 season which raised the minimum weight limit of the car and driver by 20 kg to 640 kg, along with the FOTA teams agreeing to the use of KERS devices once more, meant that KERS returned for the 2011 season. This is still optional as it was in the 2009 season; in the 2011 season 3 teams elected not to use it. For the 2012 season, only Marussia and HRT raced without KERS, and by 2013, with the withdrawal of HRT, all 11 teams on the grid were running KERS.

In the 2014 season, the power output of the MGU-K (The replacement of the KERS and part of the ERS system that also includes a turbocharger waste heat recovery system) was increased from 60 kW to 120 kW and it was allowed to recover 2 mega- joules per lap. This was to balance the sport&#x27;s move from 2.4-litre V8 engines to 1.6-litre V6 engines. The fail-safe settings of the brake-by-wire system that now supplements KERS came under examination as a contributing factor in the fatal crash of Jules Bianchi at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix.

=== Autopart makers ===
Bosch Motorsport Service is developing a KERS for use in motor racing. These electricity storage systems for hybrid and engine functions include a lithium-ion battery with scalable capacity or a flywheel, a four to eight kilogram electric motor (with a maximum power level of ), as well as the KERS controller for power and battery management. Bosch also offers a range of electric hybrid systems for commercial and light-duty applications.

=== Car makers ===
Automakers including Honda have been testing KERS systems. At the 2008 1,000 km of Silverstone, Peugeot Sport unveiled the Peugeot 908 HY, a hybrid electric variant of the diesel 908, with KERS. Peugeot planned to campaign the car in the 2009 Le Mans Series season, although it was not capable of scoring championship points. Peugeot plans also a compressed air regenerative braking powertrain called Hybrid Air.

McLaren began testing of their KERS in September 2008 at the Jerez test track in preparation for the 2009 F1 season, although at that time it was not yet known if they would be operating an electrical or mechanical system. In November 2008 it was announced that Freescale Semiconductor would collaborate with McLaren Electronic Systems to further develop its KERS for McLaren&#x27;s Formula One car from 2010 onwards. Both parties believed this collaboration would improve McLaren&#x27;s KERS system and help the system filter down to road car technology.

Toyota has used a supercapacitor for regeneration on a Supra HV-R hybrid race car that won the Tokachi 24 Hours race in July 2007.

BMW has used regenerative braking on their E90 3 Series as well as in current models like F25 5 Series under the EfficientDynamics moniker. Volkswagen have regenerative braking technologies under the BlueMotion brand in such models as the Volkswagen Golf Mk7 and Mk7 Golf Estate / Wagon models, other VW group brands like SEAT, Skoda and Audi.

=== Motorcycles ===
KTM racing boss Harald Bartol has revealed that the factory raced with a secret kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) fitted to Tommy Koyama&#x27;s motorcycle during the 2008 season-ending 125cc Valencian Grand Prix. This was against the rules, so they were banned from doing it afterwards.

=== Races ===
Automobile Club de l&#x27;Ouest, the organizer behind the annual 24 Hours of Le Mans event and the Le Mans Series, was &quot;studying specific rules for LMP1 that will be equipped with a kinetic energy recovery system&quot; in 2007. Peugeot was the first manufacturer to unveil a fully functioning LMP1 car in the form of the 908 HY at the 2008 Autosport 1000 km race at Silverstone.

== Civilian transport ==

=== Bicycles ===
On electric bicycles, regenerative braking can be used in principle. However, as of 2024 it is rarely used on bicycles, mainly because it requires a direct-drive hub motor (while many bicycles use a mid-drive motor which drives the chain), and because it cannot be combined with a freewheel mechanism. Also, the amount of energy regenerated is typically too low to be worthwhile.

Regenerative braking is also possible on a non-electric bicycle. The United States Environmental Protection Agency, working with students from the University of Michigan, developed the hydraulic Regenerative Brake Launch Assist (RBLA).

=== Cars ===
Many hybrid electric and fully electric vehicles employ regenerative braking in conjunction with friction braking, Regenerative braking systems (RBS) are not able to fully emulate conventional brake function for drivers, but there are continuing advancements. The calibrations used to determine when energy will be regenerated and when friction braking is used to slow down the vehicle affects the way the driver feels the braking action.

The RBS is a key mechanism for electric vehicles to obtain braking energy. This technology seriously affects the economy, emissions, safety and other functions of electric vehicles. By improving the RBS, the kinetic energy recovery rate of the vehicle can be significantly increased, and the driving stability of the vehicle can be improved.

===Streetcars/trams===
Power consumption is reduced by regenerative braking on streetcars () or trams () in Oranjestad, Aruba. Designed and built by TIG/m Modern Street Railways in Chatsworth, USA, the vehicles use hybrid/electric technology: they do not take their power from external sources such as overhead wires when running but are self-powered by lithium batteries augmented by hydrogen fuel cells.

== Thermodynamics ==

=== KERS flywheel ===
The energy of a flywheel can be described by this general energy equation, assuming the flywheel is the system:
:formula_1

where
:*formula_2 is the energy into the flywheel.
:*formula_3 is the energy out of the flywheel.
:*formula_4 is the change in energy of the flywheel.

An assumption is made that during braking there is no change in the potential energy, enthalpy of the flywheel, pressure or volume of the flywheel, so only kinetic energy will be considered. As the car is braking, no energy is dispersed by the flywheel, and the only energy into the flywheel is the initial kinetic energy of the car. The equation can be simplified to:
:formula_5

where
:*formula_6 is the mass of the car.
:*formula_7 is the initial velocity of the car just before braking.

The flywheel collects a percentage of the initial kinetic energy of the car, and this percentage can be represented by formula_8. The flywheel stores the energy as rotational kinetic energy. Because the energy is kept as kinetic energy and not transformed into another type of energy this process is efficient. The flywheel can only store so much energy, however, and this is limited by its maximum amount of rotational kinetic energy. This is determined based upon the inertia of the flywheel and its angular velocity. As the car sits idle, little rotational kinetic energy is lost over time so the initial amount of energy in the flywheel can be assumed to equal the final amount of energy distributed by the flywheel. The amount of kinetic energy distributed by the flywheel is therefore:

:formula_9

=== Regenerative brakes ===
Regenerative braking has a similar energy equation to the equation for the mechanical flywheel. Regenerative braking is a two-step process involving the motor/generator and the battery. The initial kinetic energy is transformed into electrical energy by the generator and is then converted into chemical energy by the battery. This process is less efficient than the flywheel. The efficiency of the generator can be represented by:
:formula_10

where
:*formula_11 is the work into the generator.
:*formula_12 is the work produced by the generator.

The only work into the generator is the initial kinetic energy of the car and the only work produced by the generator is the electrical energy. Rearranging this equation to solve for the power produced by the generator gives this equation:
:formula_13

where
:*formula_14 is the amount of time the car brakes.
:*formula_6 is the mass of the car.
:*formula_7 is the initial velocity of the car just before braking.

The efficiency of the battery can be described as:
:formula_17

where
:*formula_18
:*formula_19
The work out of the battery represents the amount of energy produced by the regenerative brakes. This can be represented by:
: formula_20

=== In cars ===

A diagram by the United States Department of Energy (DoE) shows cars with internal combustion engines as having efficiency of typically 13% in urban driving, 20% in highway conditions. Braking in proportion to the useful mechanic energy amounts to 6/13 i.e. 46% in towns, and 2/20 i.e. 10% on motorways.

The DoE states that electric cars convert over 77% of the electrical energy from the grid to power at the wheels. The efficiency of an electric vehicle, taking into account losses due to the electric network, heating, and air conditioning is about 50% according to Jean-Marc Jancovici (however for the overall conversion see Embodied energy#Embodied energy in the energy field).

Consider the electric motor efficiency formula_21 and the braking proportion in towns formula_22 and on motorways formula_23.

Let us introduce formula_24 which is the recuperated proportion of braking energy. Let us assume formula_25.
Under these circumstances, formula_26 being the energy flux arriving at the electric engine, formula_27 the energy flux lost while braking and formula_28 the recuperated energy flux, an equilibrium is reached according to the equations

formula_29 and formula_30

thus formula_31

It is as though the old energy flux formula_26 was replaced by a new one formula_33

The expected gain amounts to formula_34

The higher the recuperation efficiency, the higher the recuperation.

The higher the efficiency between the electric motor and the wheels, the higher the recuperation.

The higher the braking proportion, the higher the recuperation.

On motorways, this figure would be 3%, and in cities it would amount to 14%.

<doc id="306004" wikidata="Q1524939" url="?curid=306004" title="Imperial Crown of India">
<text>The Imperial Crown of India was used by King in his capacity as Emperor of India at the Delhi Durbar of 1911.

==Origin==
Tradition prohibits the Crown Jewels from leaving the United Kingdom, a product of the days when kings and queens often pawned the jewels to foreign brokers. There are also considerable risks involved in transporting the historic regalia by sea and land over such a great distance. For these reasons, a new crown was made specially for King George V and Queen Mary&#x27;s trip to India in 1911, where they were proclaimed as Emperor and Empress of India before the princes and rulers of India.

The Crown Jewellers at the time, Garrard &amp; Co, made the crown at a cost of £60,000
(), which was borne by the India Office.

==Description==
The Imperial Crown of India weighs and is set with 6,170 diamonds, 9 emeralds, 4 rubies, and 4 sapphires. At the front is a very fine emerald weighing . The King wrote in his diary that it was heavy and uncomfortable to wear: &quot;Rather tired after wearing my crown for  hours; it hurt my head, as it is pretty heavy.&quot;

Similar to other British crowns, it consists of a circlet with four crosses pattée and four fleurs-de-lis. However, the eight half-arches on top, which join at a typical monde and cross pattée, point upwards in the form of a Gothic ogee arch. The Crown of India is the only crown of a British sovereign to have eight half-arches, in the style of continental European crowns, departing from the tradition of British crowns having two arches or four half-arches.

==Use==

George and Mary were not crowned as emperor and empress at the ceremony; the Archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Davidson, did not think it appropriate for a Christian service to take place in a country where the people were mostly Hindu or Muslim. Instead, the king simply wore the crown as he entered the durbar, and the durbar was styled as an affirmation of the king&#x27;s coronation, which had already taken place in the United Kingdom six months earlier.

It has not been used since George V returned from India. On 15 August 1947, British rule over India ended and the Dominions of India and Pakistan came into being. George VI and his British Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, agreed that
as long as the two new Dominions remained in the Commonwealth, the crown should be retained among the Crown Jewels, but if at later date one or both were to secede it might be contended that, in view of the fact that it had been purchased out of Indian funds, the crown should be vested in some Indian authority&quot;.

The Imperial Crown of India is on public display in the Jewel House at the Tower of London.

<text>Andean music is a group of styles of music from the Andes region in South America.

Original chants and melodies come from the general area inhabited by Quechuas (originally from Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile), Aymaras (originally from Bolivia), and other peoples who lived roughly in the area of the Inca Empire prior to European contact. This early music then was fused with music elements. It includes folklore music of parts of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. Andean music is popular to different degrees across South America,having its core public in rural areas and among indigenous populations. The Nueva Canción movement of the 1970s revived the genre across South America and brought it to places where it was unknown or forgotten.

==Instruments==

The panpipes group include the sikú (or zampoña) and Antara. These are ancient indigenous instruments that vary in size, tuning, and style. Instruments in this group are constructed from aquatic reeds found in many lakes in the Andean region of South America. The sikú has two rows of canes and are tuned in either pentatonic or diatonic scales. Some modern single-row panpipes modeled after the native antara are capable of playing full scales, while traditional sikús are played using two rows of canes wrapped together. It is still commonplace for two performers to share a melody while playing the larger style of sikú called the toyo. This style of voicing with notes interspersed between two musicians is called playing in hocket and is still in use today in many of the huaynos traditional songs and contemporary Andean music.

Quenas (notched-end flutes) remain popular and are traditionally made out of the same aquatic canes as the sikús, although PVC pipe is sometimes used due to its resistance to heat, cold and humidity. Generally, quenas are played only during the dry season, while vertical flutes, either pinkillos or tarkas, are played during the wet season. Tarkas are constructed from local Andean hardwood sources. Marching bands dominated by drums and panpipes are commonplace today and are used to celebrate weddings, carnivals and other holidays.

==Modern history==
The twentieth century saw drastic changes in Andean society and culture. Bolivia, for example, saw a nationalistic revolution in 1952, leading to increased rights and social awareness for natives. The new government established a folklore department in the Bolivian Ministry of Education and radio stations began broadcasting in Aymara and Quechua.

By 1965, an influential group called Los Jairas formed in La Paz, Bolivia; the quartet fused native sounds into forms suitable for urban Europeans and the middle class. One member of Los Jairas, Gilbert Favre (a Swiss-French flautist) had previously been an acquaintance of the Parras (Ángel, Isabel, and their mother Violeta) in Paris. The Parras eventually began promoting indigenous music in Santiago, Chile. Simon and Garfunkel covered Los Incas song &quot;El Cóndor Pasa&quot; and Andean music became famous around the world.

The late 1960s released native groups such as Ruphay, Grupo Aymara, and the emblematic quechua singer, Luzmila Carpio. Later Chilean groups such as Inti-Illimani and Los Curacas took the fusion work of Los Jairas and the Parras to invent nueva canción, which returned to Bolivia in the 1980s in the form of canto nuevo artists such as Emma Junaro and Matilde Casazola.

The 1970s was a decade in which Andean music saw its biggest growth. Different groups sprang out of the different villages throughout the Andes Region. Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Bolivia, south of Colombia, and northwest Argentina.

Many musicians made their way to the big cities forming different bands and groups. One of the most legendary was Los Kjarkas, from Bolivia, singing and composing songs that became huge hits in Bolivia and would later become Andean standards. They would later take Andean music to the rest of the world.

===Cumbia===
Originally from the Caribbean coast of Colombia, cumbia later spread through much of Latin America. In Peru, it developed into a style colloquially known as chicha, which has become a popular style in the Andean region, especially among the lower socioeconomic strata of the society including Quechua and Aymara populations. Several Andean music genres have also borrowed elements originally introduced by the Peruvian cumbia such as electric bass guitars, electronic percussion and little from the original cumbia rhythm.

===Nueva canción===
Andean music has served as a major source of inspiration for the neo-folkloric Nueva canción movement that began in the 1960s, Nueva canción musicians both interpreted old songs and created new pieces that are now considered Andean music. Some Nueva canción musicians such as Los Jaivas would fuse Andean music with psychedelic and progressive rock.

===Rock en español===
While the rock en español wave of the 1980s and 1990s largely rejected Nueva canción and folklore in favor of hard rock, pop rock, punk, alternative rock and new wave sounds some elements of Andean music has been featured in rock en Español songs such as &quot;Cuando pase el temblor&quot; by Soda Stereo and &quot;Lamento boliviano&quot; by Los Enanitos Verdes.

<text>The Conscription Crisis of 1917 () was a political and military crisis in Canada during World War I. It was mainly caused by disagreement on whether men should be conscripted to fight in the war, but also brought out many issues regarding relations between French Canadians and English Canadians. The vast majority of French Canadians opposed conscription; they felt that they had no particular loyalty to either Britain or France. Led by Henri Bourassa, they felt their only loyalty was to Canada. English Canadians supported the war effort as they felt stronger ties to the British Empire. On January 1, 1918, the Unionist government began to enforce the &quot;Military Service Act&quot;. The Act caused 404,385 men to be liable for military service, from which 385,510 sought exemption.

The most violent opposition occurred in Quebec, where anti-war attitudes sparked a weekend of rioting between March 28 and April 1, 1918. The disturbances began on a Thursday when the Dominion Police detained a French-Canadian man who had failed to present his draft exemption papers. Despite the man&#x27;s release, an angry mob of nearly 200 soon descended upon the St. Roch District Police Station where the man had been held. Rioters then ransacked the conscription registration office as well as two pro-conscription newspapers within Quebec City. The final and bloodiest conflict happened Easter Monday when crowds once again organized against the military presence in the city, which by then had grown to 1,200 soldiers. The soldiers were ordered to fire on the crowds, immediately causing them to disperse. Though the actual number of civilian casualties is debated, official reports from that day name five men killed by gunfire. Dozens more were injured. Among the soldiers are 32 recorded injuries that day, with no deaths. Monday, April 1, marked the end of the Easter Riots, which totalled over 150 casualties and $300,000 in damage.

==Background==

Canada entered World War I on 4 August 1914. Colonel Sam Hughes was the Canadian Minister of Militia, and on 10 August he was permitted to create a militia of 25,000 men. Before the end of August 1914, Hughes had already created a training camp at Valcartier, Quebec, which was capable of housing 32,000 men. The first contingent of 31,200 Canadians, dubbed &quot;Canada&#x27;s Answer&quot;, arrived in Britain on October 14 for continued training. Hughes moved with incredible speed to create Canadian battalions which allowed Canadian troops to be kept together as units for the first time.

Relatively few French Canadians volunteered. The experience of the first contingent suggested that they could expect nothing but ill-treatment as French-speaking Catholics in English-speaking battalions filled with what they perceived as mostly Protestant men and officers who were unable to communicate with them. Young French Canadians seeking to serve, chose, instead, the few traditional &quot;French&quot; regiments of the Canadian militia, such as &quot;Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal&quot;, where barracks life was in French, and only the command language was in English. They had to be turned away because the Minister of Militia and his subordinates were obstinate in their refusal to mobilize these traditionally French regiments or to create new ones. However, the government continued to raise its expectations for volunteers, aiming for 150,000 men by 1915. English Canadians did not believe that French Canada was providing a fair share to the war effort. Sam Hughes, in June 1917, informed the House of Commons that of the 432,000 Canadian volunteers fewer than 5% came from French Canada, which made up 28% of the Canadian population at that time. There have been many reasons proposed for the lack of Québécois volunteers; however, many prominent Canadian historians suggest that the Ontario government&#x27;s move to disallow French language instruction in Regulation 17 as the main reason.

Political pressure in Quebec, along with some public rallies, demanded the creation of French-speaking units to fight a war that was viewed as being right and necessary by many Quebecers, despite Regulation 17 in Ontario and the resistance in Quebec of those such as Henri Bourassa. Indeed, Montreal&#x27;s &quot;La Presse&quot; editorialized that Quebec should create a contingent to fight as part of the French Army. When the government relented, the first new unit was the 22nd (French Canadian) Battalion, CEF. While a few other French-speaking groups were also allowed to be created, mostly by Reserve officers, they were all disbanded to provide replacements for the 22nd, which suffered close to 4,000 wounded and killed in the course of the war.

As the war dragged on, soldiers and politicians soon realized there would be no quick end. Eventually, people learned of the trench conditions and some casualties in Europe, and men stopped volunteering. There were over 300,000 recruits by 1916, but Prime Minister Robert Borden had promised 500,000 by the end of that year, even though Canada&#x27;s population was only 8 million at the time.

==Conscription Crisis 1917==
After the Battle of the Somme, Canada was in desperate need to replenish its supply of soldiers; however, there were very few volunteers to replace them. The recruiting effort in Quebec had failed, and the Canadian government turned to its only remaining option: conscription.

Almost all French Canadians opposed conscription; they felt that they had no particular loyalty to either Britain or France. Led by Henri Bourassa, they felt their only loyalty was to Canada. English Canadians supported the war effort as they felt stronger ties to the British Empire. The Conscription Crisis of 1917 caused a considerable rift along ethnic lines between Anglophones and Francophones.

After visiting Britain for a meeting of First Ministers in May 1917, Borden announced that he would introduce the &quot;Military Service Act &quot;on August 29, 1917. The Act was passed: allowing the government to conscript men aged 20 to 45 across the country if the Prime Minister felt that it was necessary.

==The election of 1917==
To solidify support for conscription in the 1917 election, Borden extended the vote through the &quot;Military Voters Act&quot; to overseas soldiers, who were in favour of conscription to replace their depleted forces (women serving as nurses were also given the right to vote). For Borden, these votes had another advantage, as they could be distributed in any riding, regardless of the soldier&#x27;s regular place of residence. With the &quot;Wartime Elections Act&quot;, women who were the wives, sisters, daughters and mothers of men serving overseas were also granted the right to vote in this election, as they appeared to be more patriotic and more worthy of a public voice. On the other hand, conscientious objectors and recent immigrants from &quot;enemy countries&quot; were denied the right to vote. In the election, Borden was opposed not only by Bourassa but also by Liberal Party leader Wilfrid Laurier, though he had been abandoned by much of his party. Laurier had opposed conscription from the beginning of the war, arguing that an intense campaign for volunteers would produce enough troops. He privately felt that if he joined the coalition government, Quebec would fall under what he perceived as a dangerous nationalism of Bourassa, which might ultimately lead to Quebec leaving the Canadian confederation.

Borden&#x27;s Unionist Party won the election with 153 seats; Laurier&#x27;s Liberals secured 82 seats, 62 from Quebec.

==Conscription in practice==
After the &quot;Military Service Act&quot; was passed in 1917 tensions ran high throughout Canada. Not all Canadians were as enthusiastic about joining the war effort as the first Canadian volunteer had been. In fact, many people objected to the idea of war completely. The conscientious objectors or unwilling soldiers sought exemption from combat. Instead, many joined the Non-Combatant Corps, where they took on other roles. Their duties consisted of cleaning and other labour. They did not carry weapons but were expected to dress in uniform, and they practised regular army discipline. Often the conscientious objector was abused, deemed a coward, and stripped of basic rights. In the British House of Commons, a resolution for the disenfranchisement of conscientious objectors was defeated by 141 to 71. Lord Hugh Cecil, who was a well-known churchman and statesman, said that he was &quot;entirely out of sympathy for conscientious objectors, but he could not force them to do what they thought was wrong or punish them for refusing to do something they thought was wrong&quot;.

However, the government was making an effort to be sympathetic toward those who refused to take part in military service. Many communities set up local tribunals. If a man refused to serve he was put in front of a panel of two judges: one appointed by a board of selection named by Parliament, and the other by the senior county judge. The man was to plead his case, and if the panel was not convinced, the man asking for exemption was allowed to appeal. If the judges found that it was best if the person stayed at home, then he was not sent overseas. Many Canadians were unhappy with the conscientious objectors&#x27; choice to refuse combat. Many people believed that if people were not willing to give service against the enemy, then the only choice for them was between civil or military prisons.

Conscription posed a difficult question for the government. Conscription was unprecedented, and the problem proved to be that the government did not know who was best suited to become a soldier, a toolmaker or a farmer. The issue of manpower and ensuring that the proper men were being relocated to the most appropriate roles overseas was an issue that lasted the duration of the war.

==Imperialism and nationalism==
Even though 35,000 French Canadians served overseas throughout the war, the conscription question resulted in French Canadians feeling more isolated than ever from the rest of Canada. They never fully supported the war effort, which resulted in the Federal government expressing deep concern over French Canada&#x27;s nationalist and anti-war stance. For the first time in Canada&#x27;s brief fifty-year history, there were substantial arguments being made in favour of revoking the &quot;Constitution Act&quot; of 1867. The nation was divided between English-speaking imperialists who supported the overseas war effort and French-speaking nationalists who believed that conscription was a second attempt to impose the Conquest, therefore it needed to be resisted at all costs. The Federal Conservatives had stated on numerous occasions that conscription would not be imposed. However, upon his return from London in May 1917, Borden met with his cabinet and announced that he would be imposing conscription. While in London, Borden had received a lot of pressure to send more troops to fully support the allied forces. He was convinced that Canada&#x27;s war effort was weak and only conscription could make it respectable. All of his English-speaking ministers supported the idea. However, his two French-Canadian ministers were hesitant. They fully understood the negative reactions that French-Canadians would have. The French-Canadian nationalists who opposed conscription viewed it as neither necessary nor successful. They argued that it caused an avoidable rift between English and French-Canada. The debate surrounding conscription would be one that would have a significant impact on both Federal and provincial politics for many years following World War I.

==Quebec Easter riots and the end of the war==
On January 1, 1918, the Unionist government began to enforce the &quot;Military Service Act&quot;. The Act made 404,385 men liable for military service, from which 385,510 sought exemptions. The Act was vague and offered many exemptions, and almost all of these men were able to avoid service, even if they had supported conscription. The most violent opposition occurred in Quebec, where anti-war attitudes drawn from French-Canadian nationalism sparked a weekend of rioting between March 28 and April 1. The disturbances began on a Thursday when the Dominion Police detained a French-Canadian man who had failed to present his draft exemption papers. Despite the man&#x27;s release, a mob of nearly 200 soon descended upon the St. Roch District Police Station where the man had been held. By the following Good Friday evening, an estimated 15,000 rioters had ransacked the conscription registration office as well as two pro-conscription newspapers within Quebec City.

This escalation of violence along with rumours of an alleged province-wide uprising prompted Quebec City Mayor Henri-Edgar Lavigueur to contact Ottawa and request reinforcements. Alarmed by the two days of rioting, the Borden government invoked the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; of 1914, which gave the federal government the power to directly oversee the maintenance of law and order in Quebec City. By the following morning, 780 soldiers had been deployed in the city, with an additional 1,000 en route from Ontario and 3,000 from western provinces. Despite their imminent arrival, protracted violence continued into the night of March 30, leading into a precarious Sunday. The final and bloodiest conflict happened Easter Monday when crowds once again organized against the military presence in the city, which by then had grown to 1,200 soldiers all of whom came from Ontario. Once armed rioters began to fire on troops from concealed positions, the soldiers were ordered to fire on the crowds, immediately dispersing them. Though the actual number of civilian casualties is debated, official reports from that day name five men killed by gunfire; dozens more were injured. Among the soldiers are 32 recorded injuries that day, but no deaths. Monday, April 1, marked the end of the Easter Riots, which totalled over 150 casualties and $300,000 in damage.

The Easter Riots represent one of the most violent domestic disturbances in Canadian history. This stemmed from a clash between English Canada&#x27;s linkage to the British Empire and opposing currents in French-Canadian nationalism, which became exacerbated during wartime and ultimately erupted over conscription. The severity and swiftness of Ottawa&#x27;s response demonstrated their determination to impose conscription and prevent a national crisis. Moreover, the military crackdown which lasted in Quebec until the end of the war resulted in an increase in state power in the wake of growing French-Canadian nationalism.

By the spring of 1918, the government had amended the Act so that there were no exemptions, which left many English Canadians opposed as well. Even without exemptions, only about 125,000 men were ever conscripted, and only 24,132 of these were sent to the front. The war ended within a few months, but the issue left Canadians divided and distrustful of their government. In 1920, Borden retired, and his successor, Arthur Meighen, was defeated in the 1921 election. Conservatives had a difficult time in Quebec subsequently, with the Quebec Liberal Party holding power until August 1936, when Maurice Duplessis and the Union Nationale unseated Louis-Alexandre Taschereau&#x27;s Quebec Liberals. Duplessis, however, was an ardent Québécois, and his party strongly opposed conscription throughout the Second World War. The Liberal Party in Quebec unseated Duplessis in October 1939 due to the Canadian Liberal Party committing to not impose conscription. But by August 1944, Duplessis had regained power in Quebec as the Liberal Party in Ottawa attempted, counter to their previous assurances, to again impose conscription on Quebec.

<text>The death of Henry Hale Bliss (June 13, 1830 – September 14, 1899) was the first recorded instance of a person being killed in a motor vehicle collision in the United States.

==Death==
On September 13, 1899, at West 74th Street and Central Park West in New York City, Henry Hale Bliss, a 69-year-old local real estate dealer, was alighting from a south bound 8th Avenue trolley car when he was struck by the driver of an electric-powered taxicab (Automobile No. 43). Bliss hit the pavement, crushing his head and chest. He was taken by ambulance to Roosevelt Hospital, but upon arrival the house surgeon, Dr. Marny, said his injuries were too severe to survive, and Bliss died from his sustained injuries the next morning.

Arthur Smith, the driver of the taxicab, claimed that a large truck occupied the right side of the avenue, making it necessary to drive his vehicle closer to the car. Smith was arrested and charged with manslaughter, but was subsequently acquitted on the grounds that he had no malice, nor was he negligent.

The passenger of the taxi-cab, Dr. David Orr Edson, was the son of former New York City mayor Franklin Edson.

==Legacy==
A plaque was dedicated at the site on September 13, 1999, to commemorate the centenary of this event. It reads:

The ceremony was attended by his great-granddaughter, who placed roses on the place where Bliss was struck.

== Family ==
Bliss&#x27;s stepdaughter, Mary Alice Altmont Livingston, who assumed the surname &quot;Fleming&quot;, was later tried for the murder of her mother, Bliss&#x27;s ex-wife, Evelina Bliss, by means of poisoned chowder. She was found innocent.

<doc id="306026" wikidata="Q6942068" url="?curid=306026" title="Music of Ecuador">
<text>The music of Ecuadoris a diverse aspect of Ecuadorian culture. Ecuadorian music ranges from indigenous styles such as pasillo to Afro-Ecuadorian styles like &quot;bomba&quot; to modern indie rock like &quot;Cambio de Tonalidad&quot; by Da Pawn.

The Andes mountains house several indigenous styles of music, such as that of the Otavalo. Afro-Ecuadorian music is also a prominent part of the country&#x27;s scene, with styles such as &quot;marimba&quot; and &quot;bomba&quot; stemming from the days of slavery.

Pasillo, pasacalle, and yarabi are popular styles of folksong, with the former being similar to a flute and usually downtempo as it is descended from the waltz. Pasacalle is a form of dance music, while the sentimental yarabi is probably the most popular form in Ecuador.

In recent years, cities such as Guayaquil and Quito have developed an indie rock scene that has allowed bands such as Da Pawn and La Máquina Camaleön to achieve international popularity.

==Andean music (La Sierra)==

The mountainous, Andean region of Ecuador, the Sierra, is home to a style of music called Sanjuanito. The music of the Otavalo people is well-known worldwide. A small panpipe called the &quot;rondador&quot; is the most distinctive instrument, but ensembles are typically groups of wind instruments, guitar trios (often including a bandolin), or brass bands. Folk rhythms include &quot;cachullapi&quot;, &quot;yumbo&quot;, and danzante.
Musicians like Huayanay have helped to popularize Andean-Ecuadoran music. Musical traditions have been of vital importance for Ecuadorians, especially for the Andean and indigenous peoples. This dates back even before the Spaniards came to conquer the country of Ecuador. As archaeologists went on the hunt towards digging up artifacts, they came across ancient instruments that were a key point in the musical aspect. These instruments varied all the way from various wind instruments such as Pan flutes all the way to drums and guitar types.

== Afro-Ecuadorian music ==
Afro-Ecuadorian music is mainly of two types. &quot;Marimba&quot; music comes from Esmeraldas, and gets its name from the prominent use of &quot;marimbas&quot;, along with drums and other instruments specific to this region such as the &quot;bombo&quot;, the &quot;cununo&quot; and the &quot;wasa&quot;. Petita Palma is considered a national treasure for her music. She keeps the tradition going with her group Grupo Folclórico &quot;Tierra Caliente&quot; de Petita Palma which was given a Premio Eugenio Espejo award in 2007. &quot;Marimba&quot; music also plays a part in Roman Catholic worship in and around Esmeraldas, as well as in celebrations and at parties. It features call and response chanting along with the music. Some of the rhythms associated with it are &quot;currulao&quot;, &quot;bambuco&quot; and &quot;andarele&quot;.

In the Chota Valley, &quot;bomba&quot; music is the predominant style. The &quot;bomba&quot; style originates from its namesake instrument, a &quot;bomba&quot; drum. The drum is played in both single and compound duple meter and is typically accompanied by an ensemble of three guitars, a shaker, and vocals. The origins of &quot;bomba&quot; are disputed due to lack of written documentation, though it is known to have been created mostly by Afro-Ecuadorian slaves. &quot;Bomba&quot; was originally a style used only during celebrations and holidays, but following its rise to popularity and commercialization, it has been found in other contexts as well. 

Religious practice among afro-Ecuadorians is usually Roman Catholic. There is no significant African religion, although Catholic worship is distinctive in Esmeraldas, and sometimes is done with &quot;marimba&quot; music.

== San Juanito ==
At the very beginning when Ecuadorian music was starting to flourish, what could be determined is that Patriotism played a major role in the lyrical portion of this genre of music. Individuals in small Ecuadorian villages demonstrated how certain music was fairly symbolic to them. El San Juanito being one of the many genres in Ecuadorian music out there that stressed allegiance. This genre allowed for citizens to feel a sense of belonging as well as the sensation of sentiment and pride of being in a place they called home.

== Pasillo (Costa)==

Pasillo is highly popular in Ecuador. Originally from the coast it has become the &quot;national genre of music.&quot; In contrast to other styles of pasillo, however, Ecuadorian pasillo is slow and melancholic, often resting on themes of heartbreak and regret. Pasillo was named the &quot;national style of Ecuador&quot; and is the style of many city anthems, such as that of Guayaquil. Today, it has incorporated more European features of classical dance, such as waltz. As it spread during the Gran Chaco period, pasillo also absorbed the individual characteristics of isolated villages. This gives it an eclectic feel; however, the style, tone, and tempo of the music differ in each village.

In its waltz, pasillo alters the classically European dance form to accompany guitar, mandolin, and other string instruments.

== Ecuadorian Rock ==
Rock music came to Ecuador in the midst of military dictatorship in the 1960s. Within the context of political culture deeply shaped by Catholicism, rock music was considered to be a dangerous movement that seduced the youth. To left-leaning factions, rock was regarded as an expression of cultural imperialism that corrupts national popular culture. Consequently, groups such as the Catholic Church, the police, and government institutions denounced Ecuadorian rock music following its arrival. 

Several mestizo-bands in Ecuador made use of indigenous musical elements in rock music since the 1990s. Rocola Bacalao integrated Andean rhythms and made in their song-texts references to emblematic rural towns, such as Pujilí in Cotopaxi. Sal y Mileto and Casería de Lagartos coined the genre of new Ecuadorian Rock. Nevertheless, in the 1980s and the early 1990s the rhythm of the social as expressed in Ecuadorian rock was characterized by hopelessness and resistance or even resignation against repression. With the emergence of a powerful indigenous movement, the rhythm changed. The most emblematic references towards the political impact of the indigenous movement are made by the metalband Aztra and the hardcore band CURARE at the beginning of the 2000s, during the a time of indigenous social protest against neoliberalism and for democratization. Today, the genre involves different styles including hardcore punk, metalcore, gothic metal, heavy metal, alternative rock, punk, ska, blues, and grunge.
==Folk instruments==
*Cununo: a percussion instrument similar to a conga drum
*Bombos
*Bandolin: a string instrument similar to a mandolin
*Pinkillu: a wind instrument similar to a wooden recorder. Native to the Quichua people in the Napo province

==Music institutions==
The Fundación de Desarrollo Social Afroecuatoriano (AZUCAR) has existed since 1993, and offers a variety of workshops for all ages in music and dance, as well as handicrafts and other topics. More information can be found on their website here.

===Music festivals===
Ecuador has many annual festivals, with nearly every village celebrating a Roman Catholic Saint. The annual festival in August held in San Antonio de Pichincha is particularly well known, as is the independent music festival Quito Fest.

<text>Stade (), officially the Hanseatic City of Stade (, ) is a city in Lower Saxony in northern Germany. First mentioned in records in 934, it is the seat of the district () which bears its name. It is located roughly to the west of Hamburg and belongs to that city&#x27;s wider metropolitan region. Within the area of the city are the urban districts of Bützfleth, Hagen, Haddorf and Wiepenkathen, each of which have a council () of their own with some autonomous decision-making rights.

Stade is located in the lower regions of the river Elbe. It is also on the German Timber-Frame Road.

==History==

The first human settlers came to the Stade area in 30,000 BC.

Swedish and Danish Vikings under Eric the Victorious conquered Stade and looted the town during the 990s. Many prominent Saxons were taken back as slaves by Swedish troops. A majority of Vikings withdrew after taking plenty of plunder. A minor part of the Swedish and Danish forces stayed but were later defeated by reinforcements sent by the emperor. 
Since 1180 Stade belonged to the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen. In early 1208 King Valdemar II of Denmark and his troops conquered Stade. In August Valdemar II&#x27;s cousin being in enmity with the king, the then Prince-Archbishop Valdemar reconquered the city only to lose it soon after again to Valdemar II. In 1209 Emperor Otto IV persuaded his ally Valdemar II to withdraw into the north of the Elbe, and the deposed Prince-Archbishop Valdemar took Stade.

On 2 May 1209 Otto IV granted important town privileges () to Stade. Otto IV confirmed the burghers to be personally free and recognised them constituting a political entity of their own law, the &quot;burgenses and optimi cives&quot; of Stade. Property within the municipal boundaries could not be subjected to feudal overlordship and was to be freely inherited without feudal claims to reversion. Fair juridical procedures were constituted and maximal fines fixed. Otto IV obliged himself to prevent burghers from being taken as hostages and to liberate captured burghers.

After Otto IV had changed his mind and reinvested Prince-Archbishop Valdemar with the See in 1211, Valdemar II recaptured Stade. In 1213 Otto&#x27;s elder brother Count Palatine Henry V of the Rhine, reconquered Stade for the Prince-Archbishop. In 1215 Henry repelled another Danish attack on Stade. In the winter of 1216 Valdemar II and his Danish troops, unable to take the city of Stade, ravaged the County of Stade. From then on Stade remained a part of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen.

In medieval times (from the 13th century to the late 17th century), Stade was a prominent member of the Hanseatic League, but was later eclipsed by Hamburg. In 1611 the city signed a contract with Sephardic Jews, allowing the foundation of a community. In 1613, Johann Friedrich, Administrator of the Prince-Archbishopric, followed by settling Ashkenazic Jews in the city, but during the turmoil of Catholic conquest and Lutheran reconquest the last archival traces of Jews date from 1630. In 1648, by the Treaty of Westphalia, the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen underwent a constitutional transformation from a prince-bishopric into a monarchy, the &quot;Duchy of Bremen&quot;. The duchy and the neighboured &quot;Principality of Verden&quot;, colloquially referred to as Bremen-Verden, were granted by the &quot;Treaty of Westphalia&quot; as an appanage to the Swedish crown. Stade, already under Swedish occupation since 1645, was a part of the Swedish province of Bremen-Verden-Wildeshausen from 1645 to 1712, and some of the buildings built by the Swedes are still in use today.

===Swedish fortress===
Stade&#x27;s heyday lasted until the Thirty Years&#x27; War. In 1628 Tilly conquered the town; shortly thereafter, Sweden took possession of it until 1636. After a period of Danish occupation, Sweden finally recaptured it in 1643 and was also officially granted possession of it, together with the Archbishopric of Bremen, in the Peace of Westphalia. Two-thirds of the town were razed in the great town fire on 26 May 1659. The town was rebuilt again to the same plan.

From 1675 to 1676, in the Swedish-Brandenburg War, Swedish Stade was conquered during a campaign by Denmark-Norway and several states of the Holy Roman Empire and remained in allied hands until the end of that war in 1679. Stade, as the headquarters of the Swedish Stadhalter, was besieged from early April 1676 to 13 Aug 1676. In the wake of the Treaty of Saint Germain in 1679, Stade was once again awarded to Sweden.

The Elbe customs station near Stade, in Brunshausen at the mouth of the Schwinge, played special role in trading on the River Elbe from the period of the archbishopric. In 1663, the Swedes stationed an Elbe customs frigate as a permanent patrol ship. This arrangement continued to exist under various rulers until 1850 and the customs station on the Schwinge fieldworks itself existed until 1865.
Swedish sovereignty ended in 1712. Danish troops besieged the town in the Great Northern War and shelled it from 29 August to 7 September 1712 that destroyed 152 houses, a quarter of the built-up area.

During the Swedish times Stade was the capital of the province.

===Danish rule===
In 1712 Denmark-Norway conquered Stade and the whole of Bremen-Verden. Stade remained Bremen-Verden&#x27;s capital also after the Danes ceded it to the Electorate of Hanover in 1715. When in 1823 Bremen-Verden was replaced by new administrative forms, Stade continued to be the capital of the Stade region.

In 1355 and in 1712, Stade suffered from the plague epidemic, which killed at least 30–40% of the city&#x27;s population.

===Early modern and modern period===
In 1757 following the French Invasion of Hanover, the Army of Observation under Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, and the Privy Council of Hanover (government) took shelter in Stade. Cumberland prepared to defend the town before agreeing the Convention of Klosterzeven which brought about a temporary armistice.

By the end of the 17th century Ashkenazi Jews reappeared in Stade. In 1842 the Kingdom of Hanover granted equal rights to Jews and promoted to build up Jewish congregations and a regional superstructure (rabbinate) within a nationwide scope. The Jews in Stade regarded this a progress and a burden alike, because prior they had not employed any rabbi and religion teacher due to the implied financial burden. In 1845 – according to the new law – a land-rabbinate, under Land-Rabbi Joseph Heilbut, was established in the city, serving 16 Jewish congregations, which were founded over the years in the whole Stade Region, with altogether 1,250 Jews in 1864 (highest number ever reached). The local authorities now requested, that the Jewish congregations establish synagogues and Jewish education for the pupils.
In 1849 Stade&#x27;s synagogue opened, but had to close due to financial restrictions in 1908. And a teacher for Jewish religion and Hebrew was employed (after 1890 Stade&#x27;s community couldn&#x27;t afford a teacher any more). From 1903 on the Jewish community of Stade was granted public subsidies to continue functioning. The Stade Region stayed a Jewish diaspora, and from 1860 on Stade&#x27;s land-rabbinate was never staffed again, but served alternately by one of the other three Hanoverian land-rabbinates. Labour migration and emigration to urban centres outside the Stade Region and Jewish demography rather lead to a reduction of the number of Jews in the &quot;Stade Region&quot; (786 in 1913, 716 in 1928). However, most of the remaining Jews were deported during the Nazi reign. During World War II, Stade remained completely untouched by allied bombings.

In past decades, Stade has economically benefited significantly from the presence of chemical and aerospace industry at the Elbe river, most notably Dow Chemical and Airbus. Also by the Elbe at Stade is the decommissioned Stade Nuclear Power Plant, which was connected to the power grid from 1972 to 2003. By the time the plant was brought offline, it was Germany&#x27;s second oldest reactor. Following Germany&#x27;s 2002 decision to phase out nuclear power generation, Stade was the first German plant to be affected; it was closed down permanently on 14 November 2003. Close to the former nuclear plant there is an inactive oil-fired power station, the Schilling Power Station.

<text>La Borde (French: &quot;Clinique de Cour-Cheverny&quot;, &quot;Clinique de La Borde&quot;) is a psychiatric clinic that opened in 1953, near the town of Cour-Cheverny in the Loire Valley of France. Still in operation today, La Borde has been a model in the field of institutional psychotherapy where citizens actively participate in running the facility.

==History==
The clinic was founded by Jean Oury, a psychiatrist who previously worked in experimental therapy at Saint-Alban Psychiatric Hospital. The psychiatric practice borrowed the idea of Hermann Simon that it is necessary to look after the establishment and to look after each citizen, while returning initiative and responsibility to them by developing situations in which they can work and express their creativity. According to its constitution written by Oury, La Borde was founded on three principles: democratic centralism, a rotating basis for the division of labor, and anti-bureaucracy.

From the mid-50s Félix Guattari worked at La Borde, developing its practice and organization and producing alongside Oury a body of theoretical work on the practice and theory of schizoanalysis, set in practice at La Borde, and included in his 1972 collaboration with the philosopher Gilles Deleuze, &quot;Anti-Œdipus&quot;.

Among the many aspects of La Borde is the annual summer tradition in which the &quot;boarders&quot; and staff work together to perform a play. Nicolas Philibert, the documentary film-maker, made a documentary set at La Borde entitled &quot;Every Little Thing&quot; (French &quot;La Moindre des choses&quot;). The film was released in 1997 and follows the citizens and staff staging their production of &quot;Operette&quot; by Witold Gombrowicz.

== La Borde today ==
The La Borde clinic was run by Jean Oury until his death in 2014. Its capacity is 107 beds, and it now includes a so-called day hospital structure with 15 places.

La Borde is known for its plays put on every summer by both residents and caregivers. Nicolas Philibert made a film of it entitled La Moindre des choses, released in theaters in March 1997.

A screening session dedicated to La Borde, in the presence of Jean-Claude Polack (psychiatrist and psychoanalyst and director of publication of the schizoanalysis journal Chimères) and the director François Pain was organized on January 14, 2009, at the Le Méliès cinema in Montreuil by the film programming structure The Missing People.

<doc id="306043" wikidata="Q4545033" url="?curid=306043" title="-yllion">
<text>-yllion (pronounced ) is a proposal from Donald Knuth for the terminology and symbols of an alternate decimal superbase system. In it, he adapts the familiar English terms for large numbers to provide a systematic set of names for much larger numbers. In addition to providing an extended range, &quot;-yllion&quot; also dodges the long and short scale ambiguity of -illion.

Knuth&#x27;s digit grouping is exponential instead of linear; each division doubles the number of digits handled, whereas the familiar system only adds three or six more. His system is basically the same as one of the ancient and now-unused Chinese numeral systems, in which units stand for 104, 108, 1016, 1032, ..., 102&quot;n&quot;, and so on (with an exception that the -yllion proposal does not use a word for thousand which the original Chinese numeral system has). Today the corresponding Chinese characters are used for 104, 108, 1012, 1016, and so on.

==Details and examples==
In Knuth&#x27;s &quot;-yllion&quot; proposal:
*1 to 999 still have their usual names.
*1000 to 9999 are divided before the 2nd-last digit and named &quot;&quot;foo&quot; hundred &quot;bar&quot;.&quot; (e.g. 1234 is &quot;twelve hundred thirty-four&quot;; 7623 is &quot;seventy-six hundred twenty-three&quot;)
*104 to 108 − 1 are divided before the 4th-last digit and named &quot;&quot;foo&quot; myriad &quot;bar&quot;&quot;. Knuth also introduces at this level a grouping symbol (comma) for the numeral. So 382,1902 is &quot;three hundred eighty-two myriad nineteen hundred two.&quot;
*108 to 1016 − 1 are divided before the 8th-last digit and named &quot;&quot;foo&quot; myllion &quot;bar&quot;&quot;, and a semicolon separates the digits. So 1,0002;0003,0004 is &quot;one myriad two myllion, three myriad four.&quot;
*1016 to 1032 − 1 are divided before the 16th-last digit and named &quot;&quot;foo&quot; byllion &quot;bar&quot;&quot;, and a colon separates the digits. So 12:0003,0004;0506,7089 is &quot;twelve byllion, three myriad four myllion, five hundred six myriad seventy hundred eighty-nine.&quot;
*etc.
Each new number name is the square of the previous one — therefore, each new name covers twice as many digits. Knuth continues borrowing the traditional names changing &quot;illion&quot; to &quot;yllion&quot; on each one. 
Abstractly, then, &quot;one n-yllion&quot; is formula_1. &quot;One trigintyllion&quot; (formula_2) would have 232 + 1, or 42;9496,7297, or nearly forty-three myllion (4300 million) digits (by contrast, a conventional &quot;trigintillion&quot; has merely 94 digits — not even a hundred, let alone a thousand million, and still 7 digits short of a googol). Better yet, &quot;one centyllion&quot; (formula_3) would have 2102 + 1, or 507,0602;4009,1291:7605,9868;1282,1505, or about 1/20 of a tryllion digits, whereas a conventional &quot;centillion&quot; has only 304 digits.

The corresponding Chinese &quot;long scale&quot; numerals are given, with the traditional form listed before the simplified form. Same numerals are used in the Ancient Greek numeral system, and also the Chinese &quot;short scale&quot; (new number name every power of 10 after 1000 (or 103+&quot;n&quot;)), &quot;myriad scale&quot; (new number name every 104&quot;n&quot;), and &quot;mid scale&quot; (new number name every 108&quot;n&quot;). Today these Chinese numerals are still in use, but are used in their &quot;myriad scale&quot; values, which is also used in Japanese and in Korean. For a more extensive table, see Myriad system. 
==Latin- prefix==
In order to construct names of the form n-yllion for large values of &quot;n&quot;, Knuth appends the prefix &quot;latin-&quot; to the name of &quot;n&quot; without spaces and uses that as the prefix for &quot;n&quot;. For example, the number &quot;latintwohundredyllion&quot; corresponds to &quot;n&quot; = 200, and hence to the number formula_4.

== Negative powers ==
To refer to small quantities with this system, the suffix &quot;-th&quot; is used.

For instance, formula_5 is a &quot;myriadth.&quot;
formula_6 is a &quot;vigintyllionth.&quot;

==Disadvantages==
Knuth&#x27;s system wouldn&#x27;t be implemented well in Polish due to some numerals having the &quot;-ylion&quot; suffix in basic forms due to Polish-language rules, which change the syllables &quot;-ti-&quot;, &quot;-ri-&quot;, &quot;-ci-&quot; into &quot;-ty-&quot;, &quot;-ry-&quot;, &quot;-cy-&quot; in adapted loanwoards, present in all &quot;-illions&quot; above a billion (e.g. &quot;trylion&quot; as &quot;trillion&quot;, &quot;kwadrylion&quot; as &quot;quadrillion&quot;, &quot;kwintylion&quot; as &quot;quintillion&quot; etc; &quot;nonilion&quot; as &quot;nonnillion&quot; is the only exception, but also not always), causing ambiguity for numbers above 1032-1.

<text>Schizoanalysis (&quot;or&quot; ecosophy, pragmatics, micropolitics, rhizomatics, or nomadology) (; &quot;schizo-&quot; from Greek σχίζειν &quot;skhizein&quot;, meaning &quot;to split&quot;) is a set of theories and techniques developed by philosopher Gilles Deleuze and psychoanalyst Félix Guattari, first expounded in their book &quot;Anti-Oedipus&quot; (1972) and continued in their follow-up work, &quot;A Thousand Plateaus&quot; (1980).

==Overview==

The practice acquired many different definitions, uses and articulations during the course of its development in their collaborative work and individually in the work of Guattari; for instance, in his final work &quot;Chaosmosis&quot;, he explained that &quot;rather than moving in the direction of reductionist modifications which simplify the complex&quot;, schizoanalysis &quot;will work towards its complexification, its processual enrichment, towards the consistency of its virtual lines of bifurcation and differentiation, in short towards its ontological heterogeneity&quot; whereupon it could take on the same tasks expected of revolutionary ideologies and political projects.

===Background===


Schizoanalysis was developed by Guattari as an open-ended theoretical practice responding to the shortcomings of French psychoanalytic practice and as the culmination of his work with institutional psychotherapy at the La Borde clinic. Guattari was regularly confronted with the use of the Oedipus complex as a starting point for analysis, and the uneven dynamic of the authority figure of the psychoanalyst in relationship to the patient. Guattari was interested in a practice that could derive, from given systems of enunciation and subjective structures, new &quot;assemblages [&quot;agencements&quot;] of enunciation&quot; capable of forging new coordinates of analysis, and to create unforeseen propositions and representations from the standpoint of psychosis that would yield positive conclusions to analysis.

Deleuze would later begin to break away from the framework, stating that in 1973 that &quot;we no longer want to talk about schizoanalysis, because that would amount to protecting a particular type of escape, schizophrenic escape&quot;.

==Concepts==


In the phrasing of David Burrows and Simon O&#x27;Sullivan, schizoanalysis is a project of &quot;experiments that dissemble and dissolve the self and other configurations and modes of organisation, but that also propose that an individual is composed of a diversity of different individuations, of other durations, both organic and inorganic [...] it is schizoanalysis that reveals that a sense of self can be made and unmade&quot;. Deleuze and Guattari themselves summarized schizoanalytic practice in the fourth chapter of &quot;Anti-Oedipus&quot;, &quot;Introduction to Schizoanalysis&quot;, as prompting the questions &quot;What are your desiring-machines, what do you put into these machines, what is the output, how does it work, what are your nonhuman sexes?&quot;. In this sense, they developed four theses of schizoanalysis:

# Every unconscious libidinal investment is social and bears upon a socio-historical field.
# Unconscious libidinal investments of group or desire are distinct from preconscious investments of class or interest.
# Non-familial libidinal investments of the social field are primary in relation to familial investments.
# Social libidinal investments are distinguished according to two poles: a paranoiac reactionary pole, and a schizoid revolutionary pole.

===Schizoanalyst===


A schizoanalyst cannot be considered a kind of deconstructionist; in Guattari&#x27;s terms, they pass what is understood to be &quot;logos&quot; through a text-machine-subject having the status of a partial object to express praxis-enslavement by—in Deleuze and Guattari&#x27;s French—&quot;puissance&quot;, and the experience of the process of machinic enslavement. Schizoanalysis addresses ressentiment by leading the neurotic subject to a rhizomatic state of becoming. Schizoanalysis uses psychosis as a figurative-philosophical diagrammatic model, creating &quot;abstract machines&quot; that go beyond a semiotic simulacrum, generating a reality not already present. Contradistinct from the psychoanalytic axiom of lack generating the kernel at the core of the subject, schizoanalytic desiring-production of intensities decode &quot;representational territories&quot; by self-generating the subject-becoming-BwO as a multiplicity. Desiring-production is a virtuality of becoming-&quot;intense&quot;, a becoming-Other. Schizoanalysis deterritorializes-reterritorializes found assemblages through rhizomatic desiring-production.

===Body without organs===


The body without organs is a metaphysical concept of Deleuze and Guattari&#x27;s that they considered in &quot;A Thousand Plateaus&quot; to be &quot;the only practical object of schizoanalysis&quot;. It is state of freedom that they refer to as &quot;the unproductive, the sterile, the unengendered, the unconsumable&quot;. Bodies without organs are produced by the unconscious when desiring-production achieves its third nonproductive stage; a body without organs is &quot;produced as a whole, but in its own particular place within the process of production, alongside the parts that it neither unifies nor totalizes.&quot; Deleuze wrote, prior to his work with Guattari, in &quot;The Logic of Sense&quot; that &quot;a body without organs, with neither mouth nor anus, having given up all introjection or projection, and being complete, at this price&quot;, is &quot;closed on a full depth without limits and without exteriority.&quot;

===Four functors===
The four functors, or ontological dimensions, are concepts that were deployed by Guattari within a typical clinical model of the unconscious, which are laid out in the following schema:

# Fluxes: material, energetic and semiotic transformations (for instance, libido)
# Territories: finite existential subjectifications (for instance, the notion of self and the process of transference)
# Universes of reference (value): virtual incorporeal enunciative alterifications (for instance, complexes and the process of sublimation)
# Phylum (machinic): drive deterritorialization (for instance, Deleuze and Guattari&#x27;s notion of breakdown as breakthrough, and the Lacanian &quot;sinthome&quot;)

The territory (first assemblage that appears by decoding) is the social field of deterritorialization and reterritorialization, while the flux and phylum are the components of abstract machines. With these functors, there are four circular components that bud and form rhizomes:

# The generative component: the study of concrete mixed semiotics; their mixtures and variations, making a tracing of the mixed semiotics.
# The transformational component: the study of pure semiotics; their transformations-translations and the creation of new semiotics, making the transformational map of the regimes, with their possibilities for translation and creation, for budding along the lines of the tracings.
# The diagrammatic component: The Real as an Absolute synchronic-parallel diagram of Reality (or Nature), surpassing all regimes of signs by the merging of content and expression.
# The machinic component: the study of the assemblages that effectuate abstract machines, simultaneously semiotizing matters of expression and physicalizing matters of content, outlining the program of the assemblages that distribute everything and bring a circulation of movement with alternatives, jumps, and mutations.

===Nick Land===
British philosopher and theorist Nick Land, whose critical work and experimental texts in the 1990s frequently cited Deleuze and Guattari, wrote that &quot;schizoanalysis shares in the delicious irresponsibility of everything anarchic, inundating and harshly impersonal.&quot; In his 1992 essay &quot;Circuitries&quot;, Land described the practice of schizoanalysis as a prescient theory, writing that it &quot;was only possible because we are hurtling into the first globally integrated insanity: politics is obsolete. &quot;Capitalism and Schizophrenia&quot; hacked into a future that programs it down to its punctuation, connecting with the imminent inevitability of viral revolution, soft fusion.&quot; Land&#x27;s later work in the 1990s, associated with the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit, also further reinterpreted and developed schizoanalysis alongside cybernetics, cyberpunk aesthetics and occultism, most prominently in his 1995 essay &quot;Meltdown&quot;:
 Machinic Synthesis. Deleuzoguattarian schizoanalysis comes from the future. It is already engaging with nonlinear nano-engineering runaway in 1972; differentiating molecular or neotropic machineries from molar or entropic aggregates of nonassembled particles; functional connectivity from antiproductive static. Philosophy has an affinity with despotism, due to its predilection for Platonic-fascist top-down solutions that always screw up viciously. Schizoanalysis works differently. It avoids Ideas, and sticks to diagrams: networking software for accessing bodies without organs. BwOs, machinic singularities, or tractor fields emerge through the combination of parts with (rather than into) their whole; arranging composite individuations in a virtual/actual circuit.

===Bard &amp; Söderqvist===
Swedish philosophers and futurologists Alexander Bard and Jan Söderqvist build from Deleuze &amp; Guattari&#x27;s schizoanalysis in their book &quot;The Body Machines&quot; (2009), the third and final installment of &quot;The Futurica Trilogy&quot; (2000–2009) with Lacan&#x27;s empty signifier re-added as an extra +1 to a properly implemented 12+1 structure – developed in collaboration with Stockholm&#x27;s Royal Institute of Art – as both the empty unifier of the psyche and the dissolution of social hierarchy. The authors argue the 12+1 model is a psychoanalytic improvement to the otherwise &quot;Kantian all too Kantian&quot; technique of compartmentalization in psychology. As cultural examples of 12+1 are cited the hour prior to and following the twelve hours of a clock, Christ as living present and dead absent in relation to the twelve Apostles in the New Testament, and the ace card as both superior to the king and inferior to two in a playing card series. In this sense, the socially constructed +1 is nothing but a subject&#x27;s passport name, understanding capitalist subjectivity as multipolar (twelve being a random number) akin to the urban intersubjectivities explored in musical theatre pieces like Puccini&#x27;s La bohème and Jonathan Larson&#x27;s Rent.

===Radical Black Aesthetic===

John Gillespie posits that writers Amiri Baraka and Frantz Fanon are schizoanalytic under the lens of critically examining racism (e.g., &quot;Black Dada Nihilismus&quot; on Dada).

<doc id="306053" wikidata="Q58434" url="?curid=306053" title="Paternalism">
<text>Paternalism is action that limits a person&#x27;s or group&#x27;s liberty or autonomy and is intended to promote their own good. Paternalism can also imply that the behavior is against or regardless of the will of a person, or also that the behavior expresses an attitude of superiority. Paternalism, paternalistic and paternalist have all been used as a pejorative for example in the context of societal and/or political realms and references.

Some such as John Stuart Mill think paternalism can be appropriate towards children, saying:

Paternalism towards adults is sometimes thought of as treating them as if they were children.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;paternalism&quot; derives from the adjective &quot;paternal&quot;, which entered the English language in the fifteenth century from Old French &quot;paternel&quot; (cf. Old Occitan &quot;paternal&quot;, as in Catalan, Spanish and Portuguese), itself from Medieval Latin &quot;paternalis&quot;. The classical Latin equivalent was &quot;paternus&quot; &quot;fatherly&quot;, from &quot;pater&quot; &quot;father&quot;.

==Types==

===Soft and hard===

Soft paternalism is the view that paternalism is justified only if an action to be committed is involuntary. John Stuart Mill gives the example of a person about to walk across a damaged bridge. Because the person does not know the bridge is damaged and there is no time to warn him, seizing him and turning him back is not an infringement on his liberty. According to soft paternalism, one would be justified in forcing him to not cross the bridge so one could find out whether he knows about the damage. If he knows and wants to jump off the bridge and commit suicide then one should allow him to. Hard paternalists say that at least sometimes one is entitled to prevent him from crossing the bridge and committing suicide.

===Pure and impure===

Pure paternalism is paternalism where the people having their liberty or autonomy taken away are those being protected. Impure paternalism occurs when the class of people whose liberty or autonomy is violated by some measure is wider than the group of persons thereby protected.

===Moral and welfare===

Moral paternalism is where paternalism is justified to promote the moral well-being of a person(s) even if their welfare would not improve. For example, it could be argued that someone should be prevented from prostitution even if they make a decent living off it and their health is protected. A moral paternalist would argue that it is ethical considering they believe prostitution to be morally corrupting.

==Criteria for effective paternalism==

Thomas Pogge argues that there are a number of criteria for paternalism.
* The concept should work within human flourishing. Generally accepted items such as nutrition, clothing, shelter, certain basic freedoms may be acceptable by a range of religious and social backgrounds.
* The criteria should be minimally intrusive.
* The requirements of the criteria should not be understood as exhaustive; leaving societies the ability to modify the criteria based on their own needs.
* The supplementary considerations introduced by such more ambitious criteria of justice must not be allowed to outweigh the modest considerations.

==Opponents==
In his &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot;, John Locke argues (against Robert Filmer) that political and paternal power are not the same.

John Stuart Mill opposes state paternalism on the grounds that individuals know their own good better than the state does, that the moral equality of persons demands respect for others&#x27; liberty, and that paternalism disrupts the development of an independent character. In &quot;On Liberty&quot;, he writes:

Mill, however, disregards his own analysis when it comes to colonial subjects. In On Liberty, he writes:

Mill above declares barbarians to be in need of paternalism. But he narrowly defines barbarism historically, geographically, and economically insofar as to declare it fit to describe the people he intends to describe as such.

Contemporary opponents of paternalism often appeal to the ideal of personal autonomy.

==In society==

* In the Southern United States before the Civil War, paternalism was a concept used to justify the legitimacy of slavery. Women would present themselves as mothers for the slaves, or protectors that provided benefits the slaves would not get on their own. Plantation mistresses would attempt to civilize their workers by providing food, shelter, and affection. These women would justify that the conditions for freed blacks were poorer than those who were under the mistresses&#x27; protection. Paternalism was used as an argument against the emancipation of slavery due to these mistresses providing better living conditions than the enslaved&#x27;s counterpart in the factory-based north. As a result of this conclusion, the whites would often manage basic rights of the enslaved such as child rearing and property.

==Paternalism and slavery==

 Walter Johnson introduces a concept of paternalism in &quot;Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market&quot; that mentions &quot;Slave-market paternalism thus replayed the plots of proslavery propaganda and fiction: the good hearted slave at the side of the dying master; the slave who could be trusted to master himself; the slaveholder&#x27;s saving interventions in the life of the unfortunate slave&quot;. Even though slaves could benefit from the concept of paternalism by receiving abundant food and medical care, the concept can never justify the institution of slavery. Some libertarians consider paternalism, especially when imposed by the state to be a form of modern slavery.

<text>The Army National Guard (ARNG) is an organized militia force and a federal military reserve force of the United States Army. It is simultaneously part of two different organizations: the Militia of the United States (consisting of the ARNG of each state, most territories, and the District of Columbia), as well as the federal ARNG, as part of the National Guard as a whole (which includes the Air National Guard). It is divided into subordinate units stationed in each state or insular area, responsible to their respective governors or other head-of-government.

The Guard&#x27;s origins are usually traced to the city of Salem, Massachusetts, in 1636. That year a regiment of militia drilled for the first time to defend a multi-community area within what is now the United States.

==Activation==

The ARNG operates under Title 10 of the United States Code when under federal control, and Title 32 of the United States Code and applicable state laws when under state control. It may be called up for active duty by the state or territorial governors to help respond to domestic emergencies and disasters, such as those caused by hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes, as well as civil disorder. The District of Columbia Army National Guard is a federal militia, controlled by the president of the United States with authority delegated to the secretary of defense, and through him to the secretary of the Army.

Members or units of the ARNG may be ordered, temporarily or indefinitely, into United States service. If mobilized for federal service, the member or unit becomes part of the U.S. ARNG, which is a reserve component of the U.S. Army. Individuals volunteering for active federal service may do so subject to the consent of their governors. Largely on the basis of a 1990 U.S. Supreme Court decision, governors generally cannot veto involuntary activations of individuals or units for federal service, either for training or national emergency.

The president may also call up members and units of the ARNG, in its status as the militia of the several states, to repel invasion, suppress rebellion, or enforce federal laws. The Army National Guard is one of two organizations administered by the National Guard Bureau, the other being the Air National Guard. The director of the ARNG is the head of the organization, and reports to the chief of the National Guard Bureau. Because the ARNG is both the militia of the several states and a federal reserve component of the Army, neither the chief of the National Guard Bureau nor the director of the ARNG &quot;commands&quot; it. This operational command authority is performed in each state or territory by the state adjutant general, and in the District of Columbia by the commanding general of the D.C. National Guard when a unit is in its militia status. While under federal activation, the operational command authority is transferred to the commanders of the unified combatant commands, who command all U.S. forces within their area of responsibility. The chief of the National Guard Bureau and the director of the ARNG serve as the channel of communications between the Department of the Army and the ARNG in each state and territory, and administer federal programs, policies, and resources for the National Guard.

The ARNG&#x27;s portion of the president&#x27;s proposed federal budget for the 2018 fiscal year is approximately $16.2 billion to support an end strength of 343,000, including appropriations for personnel pay and allowance, facilities maintenance, construction, equipment maintenance and other activities.

==History==

==Units and formations==
Deployable Army units are organized as Table of organization and equipment (TOE) organizations or modified table of organization and equipment (MTOE) organizations. Non-deployable units, such as a state&#x27;s joint force headquarters or regional training institutes are administered as Table of distribution and allowance (TDA) units.

=== Divisions ===
In addition to many deployable units which are non-divisional, the Army National Guard&#x27;s deployable units include eight infantry divisions. These divisions, their subordinate brigades or brigades with which the divisions have a training oversight relationship, and the states represented by the largest units include:

&quot;Army Aviation&quot; Magazine wrote on 31 March 2021 that &quot;The ARNG is pressing forward with the Division Alignment for Training (DIV AFT) effort. The DIV AFT intent is to enhance leader development and training readiness through codified relationships across echelons and states to develop combat capable division formations for large scale combat operations. The Director, ARNG. recently convened a DIV AFT Initial Planning Conference to clarify unit alignments for all eight ARNG Division Headquarters and synchronize activities that will facilitate unity of effort between Division Headquarters and aligned for training States.&quot;

== Leadership ==


Upon the creation of the United States Air Force in 1947, the National Guard Bureau was organized into two divisions; Army National Guard and Air National Guard. Each were headed by a major general who reported to the chief of the National Guard Bureau. The head of the Army National Guard was originally established as the chief of the Army Division at the National Guard Bureau. The position was downgraded to brigadier general in 1962 due to force reduction. It was renamed to Director of the Army National Guard and elevated back to major general in 1970. The position was later elevated to the rank of lieutenant general in 2001. The Army National Guard is also authorized a deputy director which was originally established as a brigadier general office in 1970. It was elevated to the rank of major general in 2006.

The director of the Army National Guard oversees a staff which aids in planning and day-to-day organization and management. In addition to a chief of staff, the director&#x27;s staff includes several special staff members, including a chaplain and protocol and awards specialists. It also includes a primary staff, which is organized as directorates, divisions, and branches. The directorates of the Army National Guard staff are arranged along the lines of a typical American military staff: G-1 for personnel; G-2 for intelligence; G-3 for plans, operations and training; G-4 for logistics; G-5 for strategic plans, policy and communications; G-6 for communications; and G-8 for budgets and financial management.

===List of chiefs and directors===

==Prominent members==
=== U.S. presidents ===

Of the 45 individuals to serve as president of the United States , 33 had military experience. Of those 33, 21 served in the militia or ARNG.

* George Washington, commissioned a major in the Virginia Militia in 1753. He attained the rank of colonel before resigning his commission at the end of the French and Indian War.
* Thomas Jefferson, colonel and commander of the Albemarle County Militia at the start of the American Revolution

* Ulysses S. Grant, having left the Army as a captain, at the start of the Civil War he served in the Illinois Militia as aide de camp and mustering officer for Governor Richard Yates. He held these positions until being appointed commander of the 21st Illinois Infantry, which set him on the path to becoming a general and commander of all Union armies.
* Rutherford B. Hayes, joined a militia company in 1846 intending to fight in the Mexican–American War, but resigned because of ill health. Enlisted as a private in a Cincinnati militia company at the start of the Civil War in 1861, and was elected commander with the rank of captain. He was subsequently appointed a major in the 23rd Ohio Infantry, and ended the war as a brigade commander and brevet Major General.
* James A. Garfield, commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the Ohio Militia in 1861, he took part in recruiting and training the 42nd Ohio Infantry Regiment, which he commanded as a colonel. He later served as Chief of Staff for the Army of the Cumberland and received promotion to Major General.
* Chester A. Arthur, became a member of the New York Militia soon after becoming a lawyer. During the Civil War he served on the staff of Governor Edwin D. Morgan as Quartermaster General with the rank of brigadier general. He later served as Morgan&#x27;s inspector general, responsible for visiting New York&#x27;s front line units, assessing conditions and recommending improvements.
* Benjamin Harrison, commissioned in the Indiana Militia by Governor Oliver P. Morton to recruit a regiment during the Civil War, he was subsequently appointed a second lieutenant and captain in and then colonel and commander of the 70th Indiana Infantry Regiment. He received the brevet of brigadier general as a commendation of his service, and later commanded a brigade. He also enrolled in the militia again during labor unrest in Indianapolis in 1877.
* William McKinley, joined a volunteer militia company called the Poland Guards at the start of the Civil War. The company was subsequently mustered in as part of the 23rd Ohio Infantry, the same regiment in which President Hayes served. McKinley ended the war as a major and chief of staff for division commander Samuel S. Carroll.
* Theodore Roosevelt, commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 8th New York Infantry Regiment in 1884, he served until 1888 and attained the rank of captain. During the Spanish–American War he was commissioned lieutenant colonel of the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry, which he later commanded as a colonel. In 2001 a review of his war record led to a posthumous award of the Medal of Honor.
* Harry S. Truman, served in the Missouri Army National Guard from 1905 to 1911, rising to the rank of corporal. During World War I he rejoined and was commissioned a first lieutenant in the 2nd Missouri Field Artillery. This regiment was federalized as the 129th Field Artillery, and Truman commanded Battery D as a captain. He continued to serve in the Army Reserve, retiring as a colonel in 1953.

(Note: President George W. Bush served in the National Guard in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and he was the first Air National Guard member to attain the presidency.)

<text>Louis Hennepin, OFM (born Antoine Hennepin; ; 12 May 1626 – 5 December 1704) was a Belgian Catholic priest and missionary best known for his activities in North America. A member of the Recollects, a minor branch of the Franciscans, he travelled to New France and proselytised to several Native American tribes.

==Biography==
Antoine Hennepin was born in Ath in the Spanish Netherlands (present-day Hainaut, Belgium). In 1659, while he was living in the town of Béthune, it was captured by the army of Louis XIV of France. Henri Joulet, who accompanied Hennepin and wrote his own journal of their travels, called Hennepin a Fleming (a native of Flanders), although Ath was and still is a Romance-speaking area found in present-day Wallonia.
Hennepin joined the Franciscans, and preached in Halles (Belgium) and in Artois. He was then put in charge of a hospital in Maestricht. He was also briefly an army chaplain.

At the request of Louis XIV, the Récollets sent four missionaries to New France in May 1675, including Hennepin, accompanied by René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle. In 1676 Hennepin went to the Indian mission at Fort Frontenac, and from there to the Mohawks.

In 1678, Hennepin was ordered by his provincial superior to accompany La Salle on an expedition to explore the western part of New France. Hennepin departed in 1679 with La Salle from Quebec City to construct the 45-ton barque Le Griffon, sail through the Great Lakes, and explore the unknown West.

Hennepin was with La Salle at the construction of &quot;Fort Crevecoeur&quot; (near present-day Peoria, Illinois) in January 1680. In February, La Salle sent Hennepin and two others as an advance party to search for the Mississippi River. The party followed the Illinois River to its junction with the Mississippi. Shortly thereafter, Hennepin was captured by a Sioux war party and carried off for a time into what is now the state of Minnesota.

In September 1680, thanks to Daniel Greysolon, Sieur Du Lhut, Hennepin and the others were given canoes and allowed to leave, eventually returning to Quebec. Hennepin returned to France and was never allowed by his order to return to North America. Local historians credit the Franciscan Récollet friar as the first European to step ashore at the site of present-day Hannibal, Missouri.

Two great waterfalls were brought to Europe&#x27;s attention by Hennepin: Niagara Falls, with the most voluminous flow of any in North America, and the Saint Anthony Falls in what is now Minneapolis, the only natural waterfall on the Mississippi River. In 1683, he published a book about Niagara Falls called &quot;A New Discovery&quot;. The Regionalist painter Thomas Hart Benton created a mural, &quot;Father Hennepin at Niagara Falls&quot; for the New York Power Authority at Lewiston, New York.

==Books by Hennepin==
Hennepin authored:
* &quot;Description de la Louisiane&quot; (Paris, 1683),
* &quot;Nouvelle découverte d&#x27;un très grand pays situé dans l&#x27;Amérique entre le Nouveau-Mexique et la mer glaciale&quot; (Utrecht, 1697), and
* &quot;Nouveau voyage d&#x27;un pays plus grand que l&#x27;Europe&quot; (Utrecht, 1698).
* &quot;A New Discovery of a Vast Country in America&quot; (2 volumes); reprinted from the second London issue of 1698 with facsimiles of original title-pages, maps, and illustrations, and the addition of Introduction, Notes, and Index By Reuben Gold Thwaites. A.C. McClurg &amp; Co., Chicago, 1903.

The truth of much of Hennepin&#x27;s accounts has been called into question—or flatly denied—notably by American historian Francis Parkman (Parkman has also been accused of bias, etc.).

<text>Guillaume du Vair (7 March 1556 – 3 August 1621) was a French bishop, author, lawyer, Magistrate of the Parliament and Keeper of the Seals of France under French king Louis XIII.

==Life==
Du Vair was born in Paris. After taking holy orders, he exercised only legal functions for most of his career. However, from 1617 until his death he was Bishop of Lisieux. His reputation is that of a lawyer, a and a man of letters. In 1584, he became counsellor of the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris, and as deputy for Paris to the Estates of the League he pronounced his most famous politico-legal discourse, an argument nominally for the Salic law, but in reality directed against the alienation of the crown of France to the Spanish infanta, which was advocated by the extreme Leaguers. King Henry IV of France acknowledged his services by entrusting him with a special commission as magistrate at Marseille, and made him Master of Requests.

In 1595, Vair published his treatise &quot;De l&#x27;éloquence française et des raisons pour quoi elle est demeurée si basse&quot;, in which he criticizes the orators of his day, adding examples from the speeches of ancient orators, in translations which reproduce the spirit of the originals. He was sent to England in 1596 with the marshal de Bouillon to negotiate a league against Spain; in 1599 he became first president of the &quot;parlement&quot; of Provence (Aix-en-Provence); and in 1603 was appointed to the see of Marseille, which he soon resigned in order to resume the presidency. In 1616 he received the highest promotion open to a French lawyer and became keeper of the seals. He died at Tonneins (Lot-et-Garonne).

Both as speaker and writer he was highly regarded. Like other political lawyers of the time, Du Vair studied philosophy. The most famous of his treatises are &quot;La Philosophie morale des Stoiques&quot;, translated into English by Thomas James (1598) and Charles Cotton (1664); &quot;De la constance et consolation ès calamités publiques&quot;, which was composed during the siege of Paris in 1589, and applied the Stoic doctrine to present misfortunes; and &quot;La Sainte philosophie&quot;, in which religion and philosophy are intimately connected.

Pierre Charron drew freely on these and other works of Du Vair. Ferdinand Brunetière points out the analogy of Du Vair&#x27;s position with that afterwards developed by Blaise Pascal, and sees in him the ancestor of Jansenism. Du Vair had a great indirect influence on the development of style in French, for in the south of France he made the acquaintance of François de Malherbe, who conceived a great admiration for Du Vair&#x27;s writings. The reformer of French poetry learned much from the treatise &quot;De l&#x27;éloquence française&quot;, to which the counsels of his friend were no doubt added.

Du Vair died at Tonneins, and his works were published in folio at Paris in 1641.

<text>Kulintang (, )
is a modern term for an ancient instrumental form of music composed on a row of small, horizontally laid gongs that function melodically, accompanied by larger, suspended gongs and drums. As part of the larger gong-chime culture of Southeast Asia, kulintang music ensembles have been playing for many centuries in regions of the Southern Philippines, Eastern Malaysia, Eastern Indonesia, Brunei and Timor, Kulintang evolved from a simple native signaling tradition, and developed into its present form with the incorporation of knobbed gongs from Sundanese people in Java Island, Indonesia. Its importance stems from its association with the indigenous cultures that inhabited these islands prior to the influences of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Christianity or the West, making kulintang the most developed tradition of Southeast Asian archaic gong-chime ensembles.

Technically, &quot;kulintang&quot; is the Maguindanaon, Lumad Ternate, Moluccas, and Timor term for the idiophone of metal gong kettles which are laid horizontally upon a rack to create an entire kulintang set. It is played by striking the bosses of the gongs with two wooden beaters. Due to its use across a wide variety groups and languages, the &quot;kulintang&quot; is also called &quot;kolintang&quot; by the people of Maranao and Sulawesi, &quot;kulintango&quot; by Mongondow, &quot;totobuang&quot; by those in central Maluku, &quot;kulintangan&quot; and &quot;gulintangan&quot; by those in Brunei, Sabah, North Kalimantan and the Sulu Archipelago. Gulintangan or gulingtangan literally means rolling hands in Brunei, Sabah and Sulu.

By the twentieth century, the term &quot;kulintang&quot; had a come to denote an entire Maguindanao ensemble of five to six instruments. Traditionally the Maguindanao term for the entire ensemble is &quot;basalen&quot; or &quot;palabunibunyan&quot;, the latter term meaning “an ensemble of loud instruments” or “music-making” or in this case “music-making using a kulintang.”

==Geographic extent==

Kulintang belongs to the larger unit/stratum of “knobbed gong-chime culture” prevalent in Southeast Asia. It is considered one of the region&#x27;s three major gong ensembles, alongside the gamelan of western Indonesia and piphat of Thailand, Burma, Cambodia and Laos, which use gongs and not wind or string instruments to carry the melodic part of the ensemble. Like the other two, kulintang music is primarily orchestral with several rhythmic parts orderly stacked one upon another. It is also based upon the pentatonic scale. However, kulintang music differs in many aspects from gamelan music, primarily in the way the latter constructs melodies within a framework of skeletal tones and prescribed time interval of entry for each instruments. The framework of kulintang music is more flexible and time intervals are nonexistent, allowing for such things as improvisations to be more prevalent.

Because kulintang-like ensembles extended over various groups with various languages, the term used for the horizontal set of gongs varied widely. Along with it begin called kulintang, it is also called kolintang, kolintan, kulintangan, kwintangan, k’lintang, gong sembilan, gong duablas, momo, totobuang, nekara, engkromong, kromong/enkromong and recently kakula/kakula nuada. Kulintang-like instruments are played by the Maguindanaon; the Maranao, Iranun, Kalagan, Kalibugan, Tboli, Blaan, Subanon, and other Lumad tribes of Mindanao, the Tausug, Sama-Bajau, Yakan and the Sangir/Sangil of the Sulu archipelago; the Ambon, Banda, Seram, Ternate, Tidore, and Kei of Maluku; and the Bajau, Suluk, Murut, Kadazan-Dusun, Kadayah and Paitanic Peoples of Sabah, the Malays of Brunei, the Bidayuh and Iban/Sea Dayak of Sarawak, the Bolaang Mongondow and Kailinese/Toli-Toli of Sulawesi and other groups in Banjarmasin and Tanjung in Kalimantan and Timor.

==History==

Kulintang music is considered an ancient tradition that predates the influences of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, and the West. In the Philippines, it represents the highest form of gong music attained by Filipinos and in North Maluku, it is said to have existed for centuries.

As ancient as this music is, there has never been substantial data recorded regarding the kulintang&#x27;s origins. The earliest historical accounts of instruments resembling those of the present day kulintang are in the writings of various European explorers from the 16th century who would have seen such instruments used in passing.

Because of limited data concerning gong music prior to European exploration, theories abound as to when the prototypes of what is now the kulintang came to be. One theory suggest that the bronze gong had an ancient history in Southeast Asia, arriving in the Indonesian archipelago two or even three thousand years ago, making its way to the Philippines from China in the third century AD. Another theory lays doubt to the former claim, suggesting the kulintang could not have existed prior to the 15th century due to the belief that Javanese (Indonesian) gong tradition, which is what the kulintang was believed to be derived from, developed only by the 15th century.

In Borneo, the kulintang was originally played during the harvest festival and the Bruneian court. With the expansion of Bruneian empire which at some point encompassed the island of Borneo and souther Philippine, the tradition of kulintang was adopted by the inland Dayak tribes. With that, the tradition of kulintang was expanded to include various tribe ceremonies such as before and after head-hunting expeditions and silat.

Though different theories abound as to the exact centuries the kulintang was finally realized, there is a consensus that kulintang music developed from a foreign musical tradition which was borrowed and adapted to the indigenous music tradition already present in the area. It&#x27;s likely the earliest gongs used among the indigenous populace had no recreational value but were simply used for making signals and sending messages.

Kulintang music likely evolved from this simple signaling tradition, transitioning into a period consisting of one player, one-gong type ensembles (like those found among the Ifugao of Luzon or Tiruray of Mindanao), developing into a multi-gong, multiplayer ensemble with the incorporation of concepts originating from Sunda (Indonesian) and finally transforming into the present day kulintang ensemble, with the addition of the dabakan, babandil and musical concepts of Islam via Islam traders.

==Instrument==
===Description===
The instrument called the “kulintang” (or its other derivative terms) consist of a row/set of 5 to 9 graduated pot gongs, horizontally laid upon a frame arranged in order of pitch with the lowest gong found on the players’ left. The gongs are laid in the instrument face side up atop two cords/strings running parallel to the entire length of the frame, with bamboo/wooden sticks/bars resting perpendicular across the frame, creating an entire kulintang set called a &quot;pasangan&quot;.


The gongs weigh roughly from two pounds to three pounds each, and have dimensions of 6 to 10 inches for their diameters and 3 to 5 inches for their height. Traditionally they were made from bronze but due to the disruption and loss of trade routes between the islands of Borneo and Mindanao during World War II, resulting in loss of access to necessary metal ores, and the subsequent post-war use of scrap metal, brass gongs with shorter decaying tones are now commonplace.

The kulintang frame is known as an &quot;antangan&quot; by the Maguindanao (which means to “arrange”) and &quot;langkonga&quot; by the Maranao. The frame can be crude, made from simple bamboo/wooden poles, or it can be highly decorated and rich with traditional okil/okir motifs or arabesque designs. The frame is a necessary part of the instrument, and functions as a resonator.

It is considered taboo to step or cross over the antangan while the kulintang gongs are placed on it.

===Technique===
The kulintang is played by striking the bosses of the gongs with two wooden beaters. When playing the kulintang, the Maguindanao and Maranao would always sit on chairs while for the Tausug/Suluk and other groups that who play the kulintangan, they would commonly sit on the floor. Modern techniques include twirling the beaters, juggling them in midair, changing the arrangement of the gongs either before or while playing, crossings hands during play or adding very rapid fire strokes all in an effort to show off a player&#x27;s grace and virtuosity.

===Casting===

Kulintang gongs are made using the &quot;cire perdue&quot; method, a lost-wax process used for casting the individual gongs. The first phase is the creation of wax molds of the gongs. In the past, before the availability of standardized wax sheets made specifically for foundry use, the molds were made out of either beeswax (&quot;talo&quot;) or candle wax (&quot;kandilà&quot;). The wax mold is covered with a special mixture of finely powdered coal/mud, which is applied on the wax surface using a brush.

The layers are then left to dry under the sun, after which the entire mold is heated in a furnace to melt away the wax and hardening the coal/mud mixture, leaving behind a hollowed shell. With this hardened mold, molten bronze is poured down the mold&#x27;s mouth cavity, cooled to a certain degree, then the coal/mud is broken apart, revealing a new gong. The gong is then refined, cleaned, and properly identified by the blacksmith (&quot;pandáy&quot;). Finally, the gongs are refined using the &quot;tongkol&quot; process, tuning these either by hammering the boss from the inside to slightly raise its pitch, or by hammering the boss from the outside to lower the pitch. The correct tuning is found by ear, with players striking a sequence of gongs, looking for a melodic contour they are familiar with.

===Tuning===
Unlike westernized instrumentation, there is no set tuning for kulintang sets throughout the Philippines. Great variation exist between each set due to differences in make, size and shape, alloy used giving each kulintang set a unique pitch level, intervals and timbre. Though the tuning varies greatly, there does exist some uniformity to contour when same melody heard on different kulintang sets. This common counter results in similar interval relationships of more or less equidistant steps between each of the gongs. This tuning system, not based upon equal temperament or upon a system of standard pitches but on a similar/certain pattern of large and small intervals, could also be found among the gamelan orchestras of western Indonesia. In fact, though the Maguindanao, Maranao and Tausug artists technically have no concept of scale (because emphasis placed on the concept of “rhythmic modes”), the Pelog and Slendro scales of Java were found to be most satisfactory to their own varying pentatonic/heptatonic scales.

===Notation system===
Kulintang repertory lacked an indigenous notation system. Compositions were passed down orally from generation to generation negating the need for notation for the pieces. Recent attempts have been made to transcribe the music using cipher notation, with gongs indicated by a numbering system for example, starting from 1 to 8 with the lowest gong starting at number 1 for an eight gong kulintang set.

===Feminine instrument===
The kulintang is traditionally considered a women&#x27;s instrument by many groups: the Maguindanao, Maranao, Tausūg/Suluk, Samal, Badjao/Sama, Iranun, Kadazan, Murut, Bidayuh and Iban. Traditionally, the playing of the kulintang was associated with graceful, slow, frail and relaxed movements that showed elegance and decorum common among females. Nowadays, the traditional view of kulintang as strictly for women has waned as both women and men play all five instruments, with some of the more renowned kulintang players being men.

==Performance==
The main purpose for kulintang music in the community is to function as social entertainment at a professional, folk level. This music is unique in that it is considered a public music in the sense everyone is allowed to participate. Not only do the players play, but audience members are also expected to participate. These performances are important in that they bring people in the community and adjacent regions together, helping unify communities that otherwise may not have interacted with one another. Traditionally, when performers play kulintang music, their participation is voluntary. Musicians see performances as an opportunity to receive recognition, prestige and respect from the community and nothing more.

Generally, performances can be classified as either formal ones or informal. During formal performances adherents follow a traditional set of rules that would govern playing and it usually involved people from outside the home. Informal performances are quite the opposite. The strict rules that normally govern play are often ignored and the performers are usually between people well acquainted with one another, usually close family members. These performances usually were times when amateurs practiced on the instruments, young boys and girls gathered the instruments, substituting the kulintang with the saronay and inubab. Ensembles didn&#x27;t necessary have to have five instruments like formal performances: they could be composed of only four instruments (three gandingan gongs, a kulintang, an agung, and a dabakan), three instruments (a kulintang, a dabakan, and either an agung or three gandingan gongs) or simply just one instrument (kulintang solo).

==Social functions==

Kulintang music generally could be found as the social entertainment at a host of different occasions. It is used during large feasts, festive/harvest gatherings, for entertainment of visiting friends and relatives, and at parades. Kulintang music also accompanies ceremonies marking significant life events, such as weddings and returnees from the Hajj. Kulintang music also plays a significant role during state functions, used during official celebrations, entertaining of foreign dignitaries and important visitors of distant lands, court ceremonies of either the sultanate or village chieftains, enthroning/coronations of a new leader and the transferral of a sultanate from one family to another.

Kulintang music is prohibited from being played inside mosques and during Islamic rites/observances/holidays, such as the fasting month of Ramadan, where playing is only allowed at night when people are allowed to eat after Iftar. It is also prohibited during the mourning period of the death of an important person, during funerals, and during the peak times of the planting and harvest season.

===Other uses===
Kulintang instrument has uses other than public performances. It also is used to accompany healing ceremonies/rituals (pagipat)/animistic religious ceremonies. Though this practice has died out among the Maranao due to its non-Islamic nature, some areas in Mindanao, Sabah and Maluku still practice this ancient tradition.

Kulintang music can be used for communicating long distance messages from one village or longhouse to another. Called &quot;apad&quot;, these renditions mimic the normal speaking tones of the Maguindanao language, creating a specific message or, through the use of double entendre, a social commentary understood by nearly any adult native Maguindanao speaker. However, &quot;apad&quot; is falling into disuse because times have changed, and the necessity of its use for long-distance communication purposes has faded away. &quot;Anun&quot; as a music without a message, is used instead to express sentiments and feelings, and has come more and more into use due to its compatibility with the musical elaborations and idiosyncratic styles of the times.

Kulintang music was also crucial in relation to courtships due to the very nature of Islamic custom, which did not allow for unmarried men and women to intermingle. Traditionally, unmarried daughters were kept in a special chamber in the attic called a lamin, off-limits to visitors and suitors. It was only when she was allowed to play during kulintang performances that suitors were allowed to view her. Because of this, kulintang music was one of the rare socially approved vehicles for interaction among the sexes.

Musical contest, particularly among the Maguindanao, have become a unique feature of these kulintang performances. They occur at almost all the formal occasions mentioned above, particularly weddings. What has made the Maguindanao stand out from the other groups is that they practice solo gong contest – with individual players showcasing their skill on the various ensemble instruments – the agung, gandingan and the kulintang – as opposed to only group contest, where performers from one town and another town are pitted against each other.

==Compositions==

===Rhythmic modes===

Kulintang music has no set compositions due to its concept of rhythmic modes. A rhythmic mode (or designation or genre or pattern) is defined as a musical unit that binds together the entire five instrument ensemble. By adding together the various rhythms of each instrument, one could create music and by changing one of the rhythms, one could create different music. This is the basis of the rhythmic mode.

===Improvisation===
The kulintang player&#x27;s ability to improvise within the parameters of a rhythmic mode is a must. As with gamelan orchestras, each kulintang mode has a kind of theme the kulintang player “dresses up” by variations of ornamentation, manipulating segments by inserting repetitions, extensions, insertions, suspensions, variations and transpositions. This occurs at the discretion of the kulintang player. Therefore, the kulintang player functions not only as the one carrying the melody, but also as the conductor of the entire ensemble. She determines the length of each rendition and could change the rhythm at any time, speeding up or slowing down, accord to her personal taste and the composition she plays.

This emphasis on improvisation was essential due traditional role of the music as entertainment for the entire community. Listeners in the audience expected players to surprise and astound them by playing in their own unique style, and by incorporating improvisation to make newer versions of the piece. If a player simply imitated a preceding player, playing patterns without any improvisation, the audience members would believe she/he to be repetitious and mundane. This also explains why set performance pieces for musical productions are different in some respect—young men/women would be practicing before an event, therefore rarely relying on improvisations.

===Maguindanaon and Maranao compositions===

Though allowing such a variety of rhythms would lead to innumerable patterns, generally one could categorize these rhythmic modes on the basis on various criteria such as the number of beats in a recurring musical phrase, differences in the melodic and rhythmic groups with the musical phrase, differences in the rhythmic emphasis, and differences in the opening formulas and cadential patterns. For the Maguindanao, three to five typical genres can be distinguished: Duyug, Sinulog, Tidtu, Binalig and Tagonggo. The Maranao on the other hand have only three typical genres—Kapromayas/Romayas, Kapagonor/Onor, and Katitik Pandai/Kapaginandang.

These general genres could be further grouped among each other into styles/subcategories/stylistic modifiers, which are differentiated from one another based on instrumentation, playing techniques, function and the average age and gender of the musicians as well. Generally, these styles are differentiated by what is considered traditional or “old,” and more contemporary or “new.”

Old styles are considered slow, well-pronounced and dignified like the Maguindanao&#x27;s kamamatuan and the Maranao&#x27;s andung. Genres classified under this style have moderate tempos, are rhythmically oriented, balanced, lack many improvisations and are usually played by the older folks and are therefore always played first, to give due respect to the older generation.

New styles such as the Maguindanao&#x27;s kagungudan and the Maranao&#x27;s bago, are considered fast, rhythmic and showy. Generally genres under this classification have faster tempos with an emphasis on power and speed, are highly rhythmic and pulsating, and are highly improvised with musicians employing different rhythmic/melodic formulae not used with old patterns. “Young” musicians, specifically young men, gravitate toward this style because of its emphasis on virtuosity and one&#x27;s individualism. Generally played after all kamamatuan pieces have been played to give younger musicians the opportunity to participate.
Tagunggo cannot be easily classified under one of these styles, being more ritualistic than recreational in nature. Tagunggo is a rhythmic mode often used to accompany trance and dance rituals such as sagayan. During the playing of these pieces, a ritual specialist would dance in rhythm with the music calling on the help of ancestral spirits (tunong).

===Sulu-type kulintangan compositions===
Sulu-type compositions on the kulintangan are found among the Tausug, Samal, Yakan, Sama/Badjao, Iranun and Kadazan-Dusun. Though there exist no identifiable rhythmic or melodic differences between patterns with names such as the Maguindanao, each group has their own music compositions. For instance, the Tausug have three identifiable compositions—Kuriri, Sinug, and Lubak-Lubak—the Yakan have two—Tini-id and Kuriri—and the Dusun have three—Ayas, Kudidi and Tidung. Though these melodies vary even within groups like the Maguindanao and Maranao, one theme which characterizes the Sulu-type is the exchange of short melodic phrases between the kulintangan and the Agungs, where both instruments imitate and duplicate each other&#x27;s rhythms very quickly. This is clearly seen in the Tausug Sinug and Yakan Tini-id and Kuriri compositions where this sort of jousting becomes a game of skill and virtuoso playing.

===Composition titles===

The kulintang repertoire has no fixed labels because the music itself is not considered a fixed entity. Due to the fact it is orally transmitted, the repertoire itself is considered something always in a state of flux due to two primary reasons. First, standardized titles weren&#x27;t considered a priority. Though to the musicians themselves the melodies would sound similar, the labels they would place on a particular rhythmic mode or style could vary even from household to household within that same village. For the musicians, the emphasis is on the excitement and pleasure of playing the music without much regard to what the piece was referred to as. Secondly, because musicians improvised their pieces regularly, modes and styles were continually revised and changed as they were passed on to a newer generation of musicians, making the pieces and therefore the labels attached to them relevant only during a certain frame of time.

Such issues made attempts to codify the compositions in a uniform manner impossible. An example of this could be found among the Maguindanao where the word binalig is used by contemporary musicians as a name for one of the rhythmic modes associated with kangungudan but it has also been used as a term designating a “new” style. Another example concerns the discrepancy among “old” and “new” genres. With “new pieces” continuously proliferating even up till now, pieces only created decades ago are now considered “old” even though this is considered a tradition spanning many centuries. These differences could sometimes make discussing this repertoire and the modes and styles within it a bit confounding.

===Origin of the gong===

The kulintang gong itself is believed to have been one of those foreign musical elements incorporated into kulintang music, derived from the Sundanese kolenang due to its striking similarities. Along with the fact that they play important roles in their respectively ensembles, both the kulintang and kolenang show striking homogeneity in tapered rims (as opposed to pronouncedly tapered Javanese bonang and non-tapered Laotian khong vong gongs). Even the word kulintang is believed to be just an altered form of the Sundanese word kolenang.

It was these similarities that lead theorists to conclude that the kulintang was originally imported to the Philippines during the migration of the kolenang through the Malay Archipelago. Based on the etymology, two routes have been proposed as the route for the kulintang to Mindanao: one from Sunda through Banjermasin, Brunei and the Sulu Archipelago, a route where the word “kulintangan” is commonly used for the horizontal row of gongs; the other from Sunda through Timor, Sulawesi, Moluccas and Mindanao where the word kolintang/kulintang is commonly seen.

===Future===
The tradition of kulintang music has been waning throughout the Eastern Malay Archipelago, and has become extinct in some places. Sets of five bronze gong-chimes and a gong making up the totobuang ensembles of Buru island in Central Maluku have also come to disuse. Kolintang sets of bossed kettle gongs were once played in Gorontalo, North Sulawesi long ago but that has all but disappeared, replaced by what locals are presently familiar with—a slab-key instrument known as a kolintang.

The extent of past kulintang tradition in the Philippines, particularly in the Northern and Central islands of Luzon and the Visayas, will never be fully known due to the harsh realities of three hundred years of Spanish colonization. The fact that there are areas which were able to keep kulintang tradition alive during European colonization has caused some observers to aptly term this music “the music of resistance.”

In 1968, at the University of the Philippines, eminent ethnomusicologist Professor José Maceda ushered in a new interest in kulintang music with the kulintang Master, Aga Mayo Butocan. The latter devised a notation system and wrote Palabunibunyan, a collection of kulintang music pieces from Maguindanao—which made its study more accessible. Further, she emphasized the improvisational aspect of performing on the kulintang. This enhanced its popularity among students from all over the country.

Today, the existence of kulintang music is threatened by the influence of globalization, and the introduction of Western and foreign ideals into the region. Younger generations would rather listen to American music, or bike in the streets with other children than spend time practicing and imitating on the traditional instruments of their parents.

Philippine kulintang music has had a revival of sorts due to the work of Philippine-born, U.S.-educated musicians/ethnomusicologists Master Danongan &quot;Danny&quot; Kalanduyan and Usopay Cadar, as well as their predecessor Professor José Maceda. Through the work of Professor Robert Garfias, both Cadar and Kalanduyan began teaching and performing traditional kulintang music in the United States during the late 20th century; quite unexpectedly, the music became a bridge between contemporary Filipino American culture and ancient Philippine tribal traditions.

Both Kalanduyan and Cadar have been impressed that so many people lacking Maguindanaon or Maranao background, and some who are not even Filipino, have become dedicated students and supporters of their cultural heritage. An additional surprise came after a decade-long series of American-based kulintang students traveled to Mindanao to perform, sparking a kulintang renaissance in the Philippines. The groundwork for this Renaissance originated as early as 1978 through the work of one of the early cultural pioneers and activists amongst Filipino Americans, Robert Kikuchi-Yngojo. It was his dedication in the early 80&#x27;s that created the cultural awareness in the Fil-Am community of San Franccisco that sparked a cultural movement. The knowledge of outsiders playing traditional kulintang has encouraged the younger generation of musicians in the Philippines, both in Mindanao and in Taguig, Metro Manila. Enthusiastic appreciation by foreigners has given life to a dying tradition, and the music has become a unifying force in the Philippine diaspora. For the first time in history, kulintang music is now formally taught to music students at several universities located throughout Metro Manila.

==Composition of various ensembles==

The makeup of kulintang ensembles throughout the region varies between the various cultural groups. Generally, they consist of five to six instruments dominated of course by a melody-playing gong row that functions as a lead/central melodic instrument for the entire ensemble.

<text>Ecosophy or ecophilosophy (a portmanteau of ecological philosophy) is a philosophy of ecological harmony or equilibrium. The term was coined by the French post-structuralist philosopher Félix Guattari and the Norwegian philosopher Arne Næss, father of deep ecology.

==Félix Guattari==
Ecosophy also refers to a field of practice introduced by psychoanalyst, poststructuralist philosopher, and political activist Félix Guattari. In part Guattari&#x27;s use of the term demarcates a necessity for the proponents of social liberation, whose struggles in the 20th century were dominated by the paradigm of social revolution, to embed their arguments within an ecological framework which understands the interconnections of social and environmental spheres.

Guattari holds that traditional environmentalist perspectives obscure the complexity of the relationship between humans and their natural environment through their maintenance of the dualistic separation of human (cultural) and nonhuman (natural) systems; he envisions ecosophy as a new field with a monistic and pluralistic approach to such study. Ecology in the Guattarian sense, then, is a study of complex phenomena, including human subjectivity, the environment, and social relations, all of which are intimately interconnected. Despite this emphasis on interconnection, throughout his individual writings and more famous collaborations with Gilles Deleuze, Guattari has resisted calls for holism, preferring to emphasize heterogeneity and difference, synthesizing assemblages and multiplicities in order to trace rhizomatic structures rather than creating unified and holistic structures.

Guattari&#x27;s concept of the three interacting and interdependent ecologies of mind, society, and environment stems from the outline of the three ecologies presented in &quot;Steps to an Ecology of Mind&quot;, a collection of writings by cyberneticist Gregory Bateson.

== Næss&#x27;s definition ==
Næss defined ecosophy in the following way:

While a professor at the University of Oslo in 1972, Arne Næss, introduced the terms &quot;deep ecology movement&quot; and &quot;ecosophy&quot; into environmental literature. Næss based his article on a talk he gave in Bucharest in 1972 at the Third World Future Research Conference. As Drengson notes in &quot;Ecophilosophy, Ecosophy and the Deep Ecology Movement: An Overview&quot;, &quot;In his talk, Næss discussed the longer-range background of the ecology movement and its connection with respect for Nature and the inherent worth of other beings.&quot; Næss&#x27;s view of humans as an integral part of a &quot;total-field image&quot; of Nature contrasts with the alternative construction of ecosophy outlined by Guattari.

The term ecological wisdom, synonymous with ecosophy, was introduced by Næss in 1973. The concept has become one of the foundations of the deep ecology movement. All expressions of values by Green Parties list ecological wisdom as a key value—it was one of the original Four Pillars of the Green Party and is often considered the most basic value of these parties. It is also often associated with indigenous religion and cultural practices. In its political context, it is necessarily not as easily defined as ecological health or scientific ecology concepts.

<text>Ferdinand Vincent-de-Paul Marie Brunetière (; 19 July 1849 – 9 December 1906) was a French writer and critic.

==Personal and public life==

===Early years===
Brunetière was born in Toulon, Var, Provence. After school at Marseille, he studied in Paris at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand. Desiring a teaching career, he entered for examination at the École Normale Supérieure, but failed, and the outbreak of war in 1870 prevented him trying again. He turned to private tuition and literary criticism. After the publication of successful articles in the &quot;Revue Bleue&quot;, he became connected with the &quot;Revue des Deux Mondes&quot;, first as contributor, then as secretary and sub-editor, and finally, in 1893, as principal editor.

===Career===
In 1886 Brunetière was appointed professor of French language and literature at the École Normale, a singular honour for one who had not passed through the academic mill; and later he presided with distinction over various conferences at the Sorbonne and elsewhere. He was decorated with the Legion of Honour in 1887, and became a member of the Académie française in 1893.

The published works of Brunetière consist largely of reprinted papers and lectures. They include six series of &quot;Études critiques&quot; (1880–1898) on French history and literature; &quot;Le Roman naturaliste&quot; (1883); &quot;Histoire et Littérature&quot;, three series (1884–1886); &quot;Questions de critique&quot; (1888; second series, 1890). The first volume of &quot;L&#x27;Évolution de genres dans l&#x27;histoire de la littérature&quot;, lectures in which a formal classification, founded on Darwinism, is applied to the phenomena of literature, appeared in 1890; and his later works include a series of studies (2 vols, 1894) on the evolution of French lyrical poetry during the 10th century, a history of French classic literature begun in 1904, a monograph on Honoré de Balzac (1906), and various pamphlets of a polemical nature dealing with questions of education, science and religion. Among these may be mentioned &quot;Discours académiques&quot; (1901), &quot;Discours de combat&quot; (1900, 1903), &quot;L&#x27;Action sociale du Christianisme&quot; (1904), &quot;Sur les chemins de la croyance&quot; (1905).

===Political activity===
Brunetière was a leading member of the anti-Dreyfusards.

===Personal views===
Before 1895 Brunetière was widely known as a rationalist, freethinking scholar. That year, however, he published an article, (After a Visit to the Vatican), in which he argued that science was incapable of providing a convincing social morality and that faith alone could achieve that result.
This work introduced the metaphor of the &quot;bankruptcy of science&quot;.

Shortly afterwards, Brunetière converted to Roman Catholicism. As a Catholic, he was orthodox and his political sympathies were conservative. He authored the article on &quot;Literary and Theological Appreciation of Bousset&quot; for the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;.

<text>The United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (&quot;Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia&quot;, or AUC, in Spanish) were a Colombian far-right paramilitary and drug trafficking group which was an active belligerent in the Colombian armed conflict during the period from 1997 to 2006. The AUC was responsible for retaliations against the FARC and ELN communist organization as well as numerous attacks against civilians beginning in 1997 with the Mapiripán massacre.

The militia had its roots in the 1980s when militias were established by drug lords to combat rebel kidnappings and extortion by communist guerrillas. In April 1997 the AUC was formed through a merger, orchestrated by the ACCU, of local right-wing militias, each intending to protect different local economic, social and political interests by fighting left-wing insurgents in their areas.

The organization was believed to have links to some local military commanders in the Colombian Armed Forces. According to Human Rights Watch, the paramilitary groups and the armed forces of Colombia share a very close connection and due to which paramilitary groups are also perceived as an extension, more commonly called sixth-division, of the Colombia&#x27;s armed forces which has five official divisions.

The AUC had about 20,000 members and was heavily financed through the drug trade and through support from local landowners, cattle ranchers, mining or petroleum companies, and other companies such as Chiquita Brands International, and politicians.

The Colombian military has been accused of delegating to AUC paramilitaries the task of murdering peasants and labor union leaders, amongst others suspected of supporting the rebel movements and the AUC publicly and explicitly singled out &#x27;political and trade union operatives of the extreme left&#x27; as legitimate targets. No definitive proof of direct links to the Colombian government has been established. The AUC was designated as a terrorist organization by many countries and organizations, including the United States, Canada and the European Union.

The bulk of the AUC&#x27;s blocs demobilized by early 2006 and its former top leadership was extradited to the U.S. in 2008. However, local successors such as the Black Eagles continue to exist and death threats have been made using its name. On May 8, 2008, employees of a community radio station (Sarare FM Stereo) received a message stating: &quot;For the wellbeing of you and your loved ones, do not meddle in subjects that do not concern the radio station. AUC, Arauca&quot;. A few days later the letters AUC were daubed on the front of their office. This threat was made due to their participation in a public meeting attended by members of a Congressional Human Rights Commission on the 27 September 2007. Here, members of the public denounced human rights abuses committed in Arauca Department by different parties to the armed conflict, including the AUC.

==Activities==
The AUC&#x27;s main enemies were the leftist insurgency groups Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (&quot;Ejército de Liberación Nacional&quot;, ELN). The AUC was designated as a terrorist organization by many countries and organizations, including the United States, Canada and the European Union. The U.S. State Department added the AUC to the list in 2001, condemning it for , torture, and other human rights abuses against civilians.

According to the Colombian National Police, in the first ten months of 2000 the AUC conducted 804 assassinations, 203 kidnappings, and 75 massacres with 507 victims. The AUC claims the victims were mostly guerrillas or sympathizers. Combat tactics consist of conventional and guerrilla operations against main force insurgent units. AUC clashes with military and police units gradually increased, although the group has traditionally been friendly with government security forces.

A February 2005 report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that, during 2004, &quot;the AUC was responsible for 342 cases of violations of the cessation of hostilities. These include the presumed reincorporation of demobilized persons into its ranks, massacres, forced displacements, selective and systematic homicides, kidnappings, rape, disappearances, threats, intimidation and lootings. These actions took place in 11 departments and targeted the civilian population, in many cases indigenous communities.&quot;

Human Rights Watch reports allege that numerous elements within the Colombian military and police have collaborated with or continue to tolerate local AUC paramilitary groups.

Under the leadership of Salvatore Mancuso, son of Italian immigrants, the AUC maintained close links with the Calabrian &#x27;Ndrangheta concerning cocaine trafficking.

One of the AUC&#x27;s targets has been Colombian trade unions. Carlos Castaño said that &quot;We kill trade unionists because they interfere with people working.&quot;

===Links to corporations===
In March 2007, the international fruit corporation, Chiquita, admitted to having paid the AUC from 1997 to 2004 US$1.7 million ostensibly in order to protect its workers and operations, in Urabá and Santa Marta, of which at least US$825,000 came after the AUC was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the US State Department in 2001. These payments were often made through a group belonging to the Convivir network, a government-sponsored program of rural security cooperatives. The payments were arranged during a 1997 meeting between Carlos Castaño, Veloza and &quot;Movil 1&quot; with officials from Banadex, a subsidiary of Chiquita. Chiquita subsequently made a plea bargain with the United States Department of Justice, and agreed to pay a $25 million fine. Colombia&#x27;s attorney general, Mario Iguarán, also opened a case on Chiquita. He stated that he will request the extradition of eight Chiquita officials connected to the case. He has also charged Chiquita of using one of their ships to smuggle weapons (some 3,400 AK-47 rifles and 4 million rounds of ammunition) for the AUC. These charges were first brought ahead in a 2003 report from the Organization of American States (OAS).

Later, Attorney General Iguarán contradicted himself by claiming the extraditions could not be completed since the implicated persons had not been &quot;identified and charged.&quot; Specifically, Iguarán asserted &quot;there are indeed some Chiquita Brands directors, but we are not able to ask for them in extradition, rather we have to have some information contained in the agreement reached with the U.S. court that includes a confidentiality agreement.&quot; Nonetheless, specific information on the identities of the Chiquita directors, executives, and senior employees – namely Cyrus Freid Heim Jr., Roderick M. Hills, Robert Olson, Morten Arzen, Jeffery D. Benjamin, Steven Stanbrook, Durk I. Jager, Jaime Serra, Robert F. Kistenberger, James B. Riley, Robert W. Fisher, Carl H. Linder, Keith Linder, and Steven Warshaw – have already been presented before the Attorney General&#x27;s Office.

===Israeli role===

According to a 1989 Colombian Secret Police intelligence report, apart from training Carlos Castaño in 1983, Israeli trainers arrived in Colombia in 1987 to train him and other paramilitaries who would later make up the AUC. Fifty of the paramilitaries&#x27; &quot;best&quot; students were then sent on scholarships to Israel for further training according to a Colombian police intelligence report.

==2003–2004: Initial negotiation efforts== 

After a ceasefire was declared (which in practice has been publicly admitted by the AUC and the government to be partial, resulting in a reduction but not the cessation of killings), the government of President Álvaro Uribe began talks with the group with the aim to eventually dismantle the organization and reintegrate its members to society. The stated deadline for completing the demobilization process was originally December 2005, but was later extended into February 2006. Between 2003 and February 2, 2006, about 17,000 of the AUC&#x27;s 20,000 fighters surrendered their weapons. This is more than double the figure originally estimated by the government before negotiations began.

A draft law was presented to the public which offered to pardon the members of any illegal armed group (which would legally include both guerrillas and paramilitaries, (i.e. members of both left- and right-wing groups) that declared a ceasefire and entered talks with the government, in return for, mainly, their verified demobilization, concentration within a specific geographic area and the symbolic reparation of the offenses committed against the victims of their actions. After much discussion and controversy over it, a further revised draft was distributed to the media and political circles. This new project was not officially submitted for approval by Congress and further public discussion on the matter continued.

The bill, among other details, called for the creation of a three to five member Truth Tribunal which would study each case brought before it (at the request of the president), after the groups/individuals sign an agreement to respect international humanitarian laws and accept the authority of the Tribunal, in exchange for a minimum sentence of five to ten years (part of it could possibly be served outside jail) for those guilty of the most serious crimes, the confession of the crimes which were committed in connection with the activities of the illegal armed group, and the completion of concrete acts of reparation towards the victims.

If the Tribunal were to deny the benefits to anyone, there would be no possibility of reconsideration. However, the president would be able to veto individuals who did receive a favorable sentence. This new draft version of the law would have been in effect only until 31 December 2006.

Human Rights Watch spokesman José Miguel Vivanco publicly stated, during one of the final audiences which were created to discuss aspects of the original bill (of which he remained highly critical), that the new proposition seemed to be considerably more in line with international standards, at first glance, but that more needed to be done in order to fully resolve the issue.

Salvatore Mancuso, one of the AUC&#x27;s main commanders, publicly expressed that he was against both any potential extradition of either himself or his &quot;comrades in arms&quot; to the USA and refused &quot;spending a single day in jail&quot;.

Also, there have been internal conflicts within the illegal organization, as other AUC leaders have mutually accused each other of being tainted with narcotrafficking and their troops have even met in combat. These different, regional and sometimes warring factions within the AUC make successfully concluding any peace initiative a considerably difficult task.

In mid-May 2004, the talks appeared to move forward as the government agreed to grant the AUC leaders and 400 of their bodyguards a 142 square mile (368 km²) safe haven in Santa Fe de Ralito, Córdoba, where, under OAS verification, further discussions will be held, for a (renewable) trial period of 6 months. As long the AUC leaders remain in this area, they will not be subject to arrest warrants.
That condition and most of remaining legal framework invoked was previously implemented for the much larger San Vicente del Caguán area that former president Andrés Pastrana granted the FARC guerrillas as safe haven during the 1998–2002 peace process, but there are differences:
* the local, state and police authorities will not leave the zone, so Colombian laws will still be fully applicable within its limits
* the paramilitary leaders will require special permission to leave and re-enter the zone, and government prosecutors will be allowed to operate inside it in order to investigate criminal offenses.

==Disappearance and death of Carlos Castaño==

Paramilitary leader Carlos Mauricio García alias &quot;Doble Cero&quot; (&quot;Double Zero&quot;) or &quot;Rodrigo&quot;, who since the 1980s had been a close associate of Castaño within the AUC, was found dead on 30 May 2004. He had strongly objected to what he considered an improperly close relationship between the AUC and drug traffickers, and was also opposed to the group&#x27;s talks with the government. &quot;Double Zero&quot; had fallen into disgrace in recent years, leading to the formation of his own independent &quot;Bloque Metro&quot; (&quot;Metro Bloc&quot;), which operated in the Antioquia area until it was exterminated by rival paramilitary commanders from the AUC mainstream.

Separately, in events which remain clouded and confusing, former AUC supreme leader Carlos Castaño, who had become relatively isolated from the organization, apparently suffered an attempt on his life on 16 April 2004, presumably at the hands of either his own bodyguards, those of rival paramilitary troops, or perhaps even other entities altogether. Acting AUC commanders claim to believe that there was an accidental exchange of gunfire between his bodyguards and a separate group of paramilitary fighters, but that he may still be alive and possibly in hiding.

Other independent sources within the group and among its dissident factions claim that he and his men were captured and tortured before being executed and then buried by order of other AUC top leaders (perhaps his own brother Vicente Castaño and/or Diego Fernando Murillo), who have become increasingly close to narcotraffickers and their trade. Investigators found a makeshift grave and an unidentified body (yet apparently not Castaño&#x27;s) near the supposed area of the events. Those same sources allege that the bodies of Castaño and his other companions were dug up and taken to other locations before the investigators could arrive.

It has been speculated in the Colombian and international press that this could be a potential blow to the peace process, as Castaño seemed to become relatively critical of the increasing association with narcotraffickers in recent years and more willing to compromise with the Colombian state, and thus the remaining AUC commanders (such as Mancuso and &quot;Don Berna&quot;) would potentially maintain a much less open negotiating position in the ongoing talks with the Uribe government.

The death of AUC co-founder Carlos Castaño remained unexplained for two years, and was subject of wild and rampant speculation. One of the more exotic rumours (dating to 1 June 2004), stated that unidentified diplomatic sources told the AFP agency that Castaño had been spirited away to Israel, via Panama, with U.S. assistance. No specific reasoning or details regarding this claim were produced. The governments of the United States, Colombia, and Israel denied these allegations.

Details about Castaño&#x27;s possible fate began to emerge in 2006. The Cali-based &quot;Nuevo Diario Occidente&quot; reported that an assassin hired by Vicente Castaño confessed to the police that he had killed Castaño in 2004. This assassin&#x27;s confessions allowed Colombian authorities to locate Castaño&#x27;s body in August 2006, and DNA tests confirmed its identity in September that year.

==Possible paramilitary activities in Venezuela==
In early May 2004, Venezuelan authorities arrested at least 100 individuals that they accused of being Colombian paramilitaries and of scheming, together with part of the Venezuelan opposition, to begin a series of scheduled attacks against heavily fortified military targets within Caracas, aiming at the overthrow of President Hugo Chávez.

The AUC officially denied that they had anything to do with them. President Uribe congratulated the Venezuelan president for the capture and pledged to cooperate with the investigation, while President Chávez himself declared that, as far as he was concerned, he did not believe that Uribe had anything to with the operation, for which he blamed &quot;elements&quot; within &quot;the oligarchies of Miami and Bogotá&quot;, also implicating individual high-ranking U.S. and Colombian military officers, who have denied such involvement.

Vice-president Francisco Santos Calderón added that he hoped that the Venezuelan government would pursue with equal zeal those FARC and ELN guerrillas who would also be present in Venezuela. The Venezuelan opposition dismissed the whole event as a &quot;setup&quot;, claiming that Chávez intended to interfere with the potential approval of a referendum which sought to remove him from power.


==Late 2004: Demobilizations==

In November 2004, the Supreme Court approved the extradition to the United States of top paramilitary leaders Salvatore Mancuso and Carlos Castaño, together with that of the guerrilla commander Simón Trinidad, the only one of the men to be in state custody (Castaño&#x27;s extradition was approved because the court considered that the matter of his death was not yet clear).

The court ruled that the three US extradition requests, all for charges of drug trafficking and money laundering, respected current Colombian legal procedures and therefore they could now proceed, once the president gave his approval.

It has been speculated in the Colombian press that the government would possibly approve the extradition of Salvatore Mancuso, but would delay it for the duration of the peace talks that he and his organization are conducting with the state. Mancuso himself has declared that he will continue to participate in the process despite the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling.

In early December and late November, there have been new events in the peace negotiations with the AUC. First, several hundred men of the Bloque Bananero (loosely translated, the Banana Producers&#x27; Bloc) turned in their weapons and demobilized in order to be reintegrated into civilian life. This group operated in the Uraba region of northern Antioquia, where the AUC had dislodged the FARC and gained total control in the mid- to late nineties. However, the AUC remain in the area with the presence of other divisions.

A few weeks later, the Catatumbo Bloc also demobilized. This was a milestone in Colombian history, for, with its 1425 mercenaries, the Catatumbo Bloc was one of the most important AUC groups. With them Salvatore Mancuso, the AUC&#x27;s military leader, turned himself in. A few days later, the government announced that it would not make Mancuso&#x27;s extradition effective as long as he avoided criminal activities and fulfilled his commitments to the peace process.

Both of these massive demobilizations of AUC groups are an apparent improvement over the first one in 2003 in Medellín because on this occasion important leaders turned themselves in and the weapons presented were assault rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers and rockets, rather than the homemade shotguns and old, malfunctioning revolvers that were turned in the first demobilization. The AUC was supposed to have demobilized completely by 2006 but successor organizations continued to operate such as the neo-paramilitary alliance BACRIM (&#x27;bandas criminales emergentes&#x27;). 

==2005: Legal framework and controversy==
Many Colombian and international observers are skeptical about the demobilization&#x27;s prospects and see multiple causes for criticism. A concern shared by a high number of critics, both inside and outside the country, is that the demobilization process, if it does not provide a legal framework that contemplates the proper doses of truth, reparation and justice, could allow those who have committed human rights violations to possibly enjoy an undue degree of impunity for their crimes. A different kind of concern is held by a few of the supporters of the demobilization process, some of which believe that, without a certain degree of acceptance from the paramilitaries themselves, any unilateral attempts at reducing impunity could stay in writing and not be practically effective.

A smaller number of the critics have also expressed their fear that the current administration could integrate the AUC into its civilian defence militias or other military structures. Military and government spokesmen have stated multiple times that there is no intention to integrate the AUC into the state&#x27;s legal security apparatus. While no reports of that occurring have been put forward yet, there have been signs of some individual paramilitaries expressing an interest in wanting to aid local security efforts in areas formerly under their influence and control, in order to prevent possible guerrilla inroads.

The debate on the subject of potential impunity has had a high profile in both the international and Colombian media, with critical views being expressed in &quot;Chicago Tribune &quot;and &quot;New York Times &quot;editorials, in addition to many Colombian outlets. The main argument of several editorials has been that the international community should not help fund the demobilization process until the necessary legal framework to minimize impunity is in place. This position was also echoed by representatives of the international community in a February 2005 donors&#x27; conference in Cartagena.

After many public and private discussions through mid-to-late 2004, in early 2005, a number of congressmen, including Senator Rafael Pardo and Gina Parody (traditionally holding pro-government positions) and Wilson Borja (a former leftwing labor leader who survived a paramilitary assassination attempt back in 2000) among others, independently presented a multiparty draft bill that, according to several observers such as Colombian and international NGOs (including Human Rights Watch), indicates a substantial improvement (compared to the government&#x27;s previous initiatives) in meeting the necessary conditions of adequately dismantling paramilitarism and reducing impunity. Among these sectors, there is a semblance of a broad consensus in support of this bill.

Congressional discussion on the subject was set to begin on February 15, 2005, but suffered several delays. The Colombian government&#x27;s own official draft had apparently gradually incorporated several of the provisions in the Pardo, Parody and Borja proposal, but a number of disagreements remained, which would be the source for further debate on the subject. Other congressmen, including supporters of the government, also begun to present their own draft projects.

On February 23, the top AUC leaders published an online document on their webpage which stated that they will not submit to a legal framework that, in their own words, would force them to suffer through an undue humiliation that their leftwing guerrilla foes would not contemplate for themselves. They also declared that they are in favor of laws that will allow their fighters to return to civilian and productive lives in a fair, peaceful and equitable manner. In the absence of such conditions, they claimed that the consequence would be the end of the negotiations and their preferring to face the prospect of continuing &quot;war and death&quot;. A government communique answered that the AUC should not put pressure on Congress, the media or the Executive on the matter of the legal framework, and that they would have five days to leave the Ralito zone if they chose to quit the talks. The AUC later reduced the tone of its earlier remarks.

On April 11, an AUC spokesman repeated their claims that the current proposal for amnesty was too harsh primarily because it still allowed extradition for drug charges.

==Mass extradition to the U.S.==
In the early morning of May 13, 2008, thirteen high-profile paramilitary leaders were taken from their jail cells in a surprise action by the government. According to Interior Minister Carlos Holguín they have been refusing to comply to the country&#x27;s Peace and Justice Law and were therefore extradited to the United States. Amongst them are Salvatore Mancuso, Don Berna, Jorge 40, Cuco Vanoy and Diego Ruiz Arroyave (cousin of assassinated paramilitary leader Miguel Arroyave). President Uribe said immediately afterwards the United States has agreed to compensate the victims of extradited paramilitary warlords with any international assets they might surrender. The US State Department said the US&#x27; courts can also help the victims by sharing information on atrocities with Colombian authorities.

The National Movement of State Crimes, a coalition of several victim organizations that have suffered from state or paramilitary violence, has asked &quot;to return the paramilitary chiefs to the Colombian authorities so they may be processed by the ordinary justice system and not under the framework of the Law of Justice and Peace, since this framework benefits the victimizers and not the victims, since they have not told all of the truth, have not made comprehensive reparations to the victims, and have not dismantled their criminal structures.&quot;

The Office in Colombia of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that &quot;[...] according to Colombian law, the reasons claimed by the President of the Republic to proceed with the previously-suspended extraditions are also grounds for their removal from the application of the ‘Law of Justice and Peace’ and for the loss of the benefits established therein&quot;.

The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights stated that this &quot;affects the Colombian State’s obligation to guarantee victims’ rights to truth, justice, and reparations for the crimes committed by the paramilitary groups. The extradition impedes the investigation and prosecution of such grave crimes through the avenues established by the Justice and Peace Law in Colombia and through the Colombian justice system’s regular criminal procedures. It also closes the door to the possibility that victims can participate directly in the search for truth about crimes committed during the conflict, and limits access to reparations for damages that were caused. This action also interferes with efforts to determine links between agents of the State and these paramilitary leaders.&quot;

After his extradition to the United States, paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso has continued to testify via satellite as part of the Justice and Peace process. On November 18, 2008, &quot;Revista Semana&quot; reported on Mancuso&#x27;s declarations about the 1997 El Aro massacre, in which he stated that the AUC had received logistical help from the national military and police.

Mancuso confessed to the Colombian justice system in 2023 in order to benefit from the transitional justice system and detailed the links between the State and the paramilitaries. He acknowledged the assassination of the humorist Jaime Garzón in 1998 on the orders of the Colombian army, the massacres of political opponents carried out jointly with the armed forces, his participation in the practice known as &quot;false positives&quot; by assassinating civilians that the military then passed off as guerrillas who had died in combat, the use of crematoria to make some of the victims disappear and mass graves in Venezuela containing hundreds of bodies that the unit he commanded made disappear. He also acknowledges that the paramilitaries helped elect Andrés Pastrana in 1998 and Álvaro Uribe in 2002.

<text>Pierre Charron (; 1541 – 16 November 1603, Paris), French Catholic theologian and major contributor to the new thought of the 17th century. He is remembered for his controversial form of skepticism and his separation of ethics from religion as an independent philosophical discipline.

==Biography==

Pierre Charron was born in Paris, one of the twenty-five children of a bookseller. After studying law at Orléans and Bourges he practiced as an advocate, for a few years. He then entered the church and soon became a popular priest, rising to become a canon.

He moved to the southwest of France, invited by Arnaud de Pontac, Bishop of Bazas. He was appointed priest in ordinary to Marguerite de Valois, wife of Henry IV of Navarre. In about 1588, Charron decided to become a monk, but being rejected by both the Carthusians and the Celestines, he returned to his old profession. He delivered a course of sermons at Angers, and in the next year moved to Bordeaux, where he formed a famous friendship with Michel de Montaigne. On Montaigne&#x27;s death, in 1592, Charron was requested in the will to bear the Montaigne arms.

From 1594, he used his own name; he spent from 1594 to 1600 under the protection of Antoine Hérbrard de Saint-Sulpice, Bishop of Cahors, who appointed him grand vicar and theological canon. His first book led to his being chosen deputy to the general assembly of the clergy, for which he became chief secretary.

Charron retired to Condom in 1600; he died suddenly of a stroke; his works were then receiving attention.

==Works==
Charron first published his works anonymously. Later he wrote under the name of &quot;Benoit Vaillant, Advocate of the Holy Faith.&quot; While Charron&#x27;s reading of Montaigne is now considered dogmatic and indeed something of a distortion, it was important in its time and during the 17th century as a whole.

===&quot;Les Trois Vérités&quot;===
In 1594, he published a long work, &quot;Les Trois Vérités,&quot; in which Charron sought to prove that there is a God and a true religion, that the true religion is Christianity, and that the true church is Roman Catholicism. It was a response to the Protestant work &quot;Le Traité de l&#x27;Eglise,&quot; by Philippe de Mornay. In the second edition (1595), there is an elaborate reply to criticisms of the third &quot;Vérité&quot; by a Protestant writer. &quot;Les Trois Vérités&quot; ran through several editions.

===&quot;Discours chretiens&quot;===
Then followed, in 1600, &quot;Discours chretiens,&quot; a book of sermons with a similar tone, half of which is about the Eucharist .

===&quot;De la sagesse&quot;===

In 1601, Charron published in Bordeaux his third work, &quot;De la sagesse,&quot; a system of moral philosophy that develops ideas of Montaigne. Charron also connected Montaigne&#x27;s scepticism with the anti-rational strand in Christianity. It received the support of Henry IV and of magistrate Pierre Jeannin. A second revised edition appeared in 1603, supported by Claude Dormy, the second Bishop of Boulogne.

&quot;De la sagesse&quot; also was attacked, in particular by the Jesuit François Garasse (1585–1631), who described Charron as an atheist.

A summary and defence of the book, written shortly before his death, appeared in 1606. In 1604, Charron&#x27;s friend Michel de la Roche prefixed a &quot;Life&quot; to an edition of &quot;De la sagesse,&quot; which depicts Charron as an amiable man of good character. His complete works, with this contribution by de la Roche, were published in 1635. An abridgment of the &quot;Sagesse&quot; is given in Wilhelm Gottlieb Tennemann&#x27;s &quot;Philosophie&quot;, vol. ix. An edition with notes by A. Duval appeared in 1820. It was translated into English as &quot;Of Wisdome&quot; (1612) by Samson Lennard; and again by George Stanhope (1697).

==Views==
;Influences
Apart from the major influence of Montaigne, Charron took from Raymond of Sabunde (Sibiuda). Another influence was neostoicism, as handled by Justus Lipsius.

;Psychology
According to Charron, the soul, located in the ventricles of the brain, is affected by the temperament of the individual; the dry temperament produces acute intelligence; the moist, memory; the hot, imagination. Dividing the intelligent soul into these three faculties, he writes the branches of science corresponding with each. On the nature of the soul, he quotes opinions. The belief in its immortality, he says, is the most universal of beliefs, but the most feebly supported by reason. As to a human&#x27;s power of attaining truth, he declares that none of our faculties enable us to distinguish truth from error. In comparing humans with animals, Charron insists that there are no breaks in nature. Though inferior in some respects, in others, animals are superior. Namely, humanity&#x27;s essential qualities are vanity, weakness, inconstancy, and presumption.

;Theology
Charron writes that all religions teach that God is to be appeased by prayers, presents, vows, but especially, and, most irrationally, by human suffering . Each religion is said by its devotees to have commenced by divine inspiration. A human is a Christian, Jew, or Muslim, before he or she knows that they are persons. Furthermore, he writes that one religion is built upon another.

While Charron declares religion to be &quot;strange to common sense,&quot; the practical result at which he arrives is that one is not to sit in judgment on his or her faith, but to be &quot;simple and obedient,&quot; and to submit to public authority. He writes that this is one rule of wisdom with regard to religion. Another equally important is to avoid superstition, which he defines as the belief that God is like a hard judge who, eager to find fault, narrowly examines our slightest act, that he is vengeful and hard to appease, and that, therefore, he must be flattered and won over by pain and sacrifice.

Charron states that true piety, which is the first of duties, is the knowledge of God and of one&#x27;s self; the latter knowledge being necessary to the former. The belief that what God sends is all good, and that all the bad is from ourselves is the abasing of humanity and the exalting of God. It leads to spiritual worship, for external ceremony is merely for our advantage, not for his glory.

;Politics
Charron declares the sovereign to be the source of law, and asserts that popular freedom is dangerous.

<text>Wilhelm Gottlieb Tennemann (7 December 1761 – 30 September 1819) was a German historian of philosophy.

==Life==
He was born and educated at Erfurt. In 1788, he became a lecturer on the history of philosophy at the University of Jena. Ten years later, he became a professor at the same university, where he remained till 1804. His great work is an eleven-volume history of philosophy (&quot;Geschichte der Philosophie&quot;), which he began at Jena and finished at the University of Marburg, where he was professor of philosophy from 1804 till his death. He was one of the numerous German philosophers who accepted the Kantian theory as a revelation.

In 1812, he published a shorter history of philosophy (&quot;Grundriss der Geschichte der Philosophie für den akademischen Unterricht&quot;), which was translated into English in 1852 under the title &quot;A manual of the history of philosophy&quot;.

He died at Marburg.

<text>Fernand Oury (18 January 1920 – 19 February 1998) was a pedagogue and creator of institutional pedagogy. He recommended and practiced a &quot;school of the people&quot; methodology, in which children were no longer passive receivers, but actively participated in the management of their learning, methods, forms of relations and the everyday life of the class: all of which he called &quot;institutions&quot; (in the sociological sense). Some of the notable elements of this methodology were &quot;pupils&#x27; council&quot;, &quot;school funds&quot; and individualized curricula.

==Background==
As a teacher in 1950, Oury reacted to what he saw as the deplorable state of the French educational system: &quot;overloaded classes&quot;, &quot;colossal school sizes&quot;, and &quot;absurd regulations&quot;. Along with fellow educator Célestin Freinet, he worked with school leadership to reform organizational practice within urban schools. By 1958, following on the initiatives of institutional psychotherapy led by his brother Jean Oury, François Tosquelles, and Lucien Bonnafe, Fernand Oury founded the discipline of institutional pedagogy, the object of which would be the progressive analysis of liberating means of education. Perhaps the most well-known name in the field of institutional pedagogy, Oury maintained an open relationship with respect to defining the scope and practice of teaching.

By 1966, Oury and psychoanalyst Aïda Vasquez, along with the Groupe Techniques Éducatives (GET) begin to work out the practical and theoretical instruments institutional pedagogy would develop as a practice. This was accomplished primarily through the elaboration of monographs. The practice of publishing articles of analysis, case-studies and critiques also began to be encouraged.

In 1978, Oury and others established CEPI, the Collective of Teams of Institutional Pedagogy (French &quot;Le Collectif des Équipes de Pédagogie Institutionnelle&quot;), and the MPI, Association for the Support of Institutional Pedogagy (&quot;Association Maintenant la Pédagogie Institutionnelle&quot;), both still in existence. Their primary tasks are the publication and dissemination of institutional pedagogic literature, reports, analyses and case-studies, the promotion and activism in favour of progressive pedagogic practices, and the education of teachers, social workers and others in Institutional Pedagogic practices.

===Pillars of institutional pedagogy===
Oury&#x27;s framework of initially consisted of three pillars of consideration (1964):

#Materialist: the equipment, the techniques of organisation and initiating activities, consideration of concrete situations, and concrete relations. 
#Sociological: consideration of the class, groups and grouping of groups and classes and effects; intercommunications and phenomena within groups that overdetermine behaviour and evolutions of the students. 
#Psychoanalytic: to quote Oury &quot;acknowledged or disclaimed, the unconscious is in the class and it speak... It is better to understand that to be subjected it.&quot;

<text>Pierre Jeannin (1542–1623) was a French , otherwise known as a surintendant des finances (Finance Superintendent). In 1573 he married Anne Gueniot and had one daughter, Charlotte Jeannin.

== Career ==
He was born at Autun. A pupil of the great jurist Jacques Cujas at Bourges, he was an advocate at Dijon by 1569 and became councillor and then president of the parlement of Burgundy. He unsuccessfully opposed the massacre of St Bartholomew in his province. As councillor to Charles of Lorraine, Duke of Mayenne, he sought to reconcile him with King Henry IV of France.

After the victory of Fontaine-Française (1595), Henry took Jeannin into his council and in 1602 named him intendant of finances. He took part in the principal events of the reign, negotiated the Treaty of Lyon with Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, and the defensive alliance between France and the United Netherlands in 1608. As Superintendent of Finances under King Louis XIII, be tried to establish harmony between the king and the queen mother, Marie de&#x27; Medici.

<text>Biochemists are scientists who are trained in biochemistry. They study chemical processes and chemical transformations in living organisms. Biochemists study DNA, proteins and cell parts. The word &quot;biochemist&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;biological chemist.&quot;

Biochemists also research how certain chemical reactions happen in cells and tissues and observe and record the effects of products in food additives and medicines.

Biochemist researchers focus on playing and constructing research experiments, mainly for developing new products, updating existing products and analyzing said products. It is also the responsibility of a biochemist to present their research findings and create grant proposals to obtain funds for future research.

Biochemists study aspects of the immune system, the expressions of genes, isolating, analyzing, and synthesizing different products, mutations that lead to cancers, and manage laboratory teams and monitor laboratory work. Biochemists also have to have the capabilities of designing and building laboratory equipment and devise new methods of producing correct results for products.

The most common industry role is the development of biochemical products and processes. Identifying substances&#x27; chemical and physical properties in biological systems is of great importance, and can be carried out by doing various types of analysis. Biochemists must also prepare technical reports after collecting, analyzing and summarizing the information and trends found.

In biochemistry, researchers often break down complicated biological systems into their component parts. They study the effects of foods, drugs, allergens and other substances on living tissues; they research molecular biology, the study of life at the molecular level and the study of genes and gene expression; and they study chemical reactions in metabolism, growth, reproduction, and heredity, and apply techniques drawn from biotechnology and genetic engineering to help them in their research. About 75% work in either basic or applied research; those in applied research take basic research and employ it for the benefit of medicine, agriculture, veterinary science, environmental science, and manufacturing. Each of these fields allows specialization; for example, clinical biochemists can work in hospital laboratories to understand and treat diseases, and industrial biochemists can be involved in analytical research work, such as checking the purity of food and beverages.

Biochemists in the field of agriculture research the interactions between herbicides with plants. They examine the relationships of compounds, determining their ability to inhibit growth, and evaluate the toxicological effects surrounding life.

Biochemists also prepare pharmaceutical compounds for commercial distribution.

Modern biochemistry is considered a sub-discipline of the biological sciences, due to its increased reliance on, and training, in accord with modern molecular biology. Historically, even before the term &quot;biochemist&quot; was formally recognized, initial studies were performed by those trained in basic chemistry, but also by those trained as physicians.

==Training==
Some of the job skills and abilities that one needs to attain to be successful in this field of work include science, mathematics, reading comprehension, writing, and critical thinking. These skills are critical because of the nature of the experimental techniques of the occupation. One will also need to convey trends found in research in written and oral forms. 

A degree in biochemistry or a related science such as chemistry is the minimum requirement for any work in this field. This is sufficient for a position as a technical assistant in industry or in academic settings. A Ph.D. (or equivalent) is generally required to pursue or direct independent research. To advance further in commercial environments, one may need to acquire skills in management.

Biochemists must pass a qualifying exam or a preliminary exam to continue their studies when receiving a Ph.D. in biochemistry.

Biochemistry requires an understanding of organic and inorganic chemistry. All types of chemistry are required, with emphasis on biochemistry, organic chemistry and physical chemistry. Basic classes in biology, including microbiology, molecular biology, molecular genetics, cell biology, and genomics, are focused on. Some instruction in experimental techniques and quantification is also part of most curricula.

In the private industries for businesses, it is imperative to possess strong business management skills as well as communication skills. Biochemists must also be familiar with regulatory rules and management techniques.

Biochemistry Blog publishes high quality research articles, papers, posts and jobs related to biochemistry. Biochemistry 2019, biochemistry papers latest.

Due to the reliance on most principles of the basic science of Biochemistry, early contemporary physicians were informally qualified to perform research on their own in mainly this (today also related biomedical sciences) field.

==Employment==
Biochemists are typically employed in the life sciences, where they work in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industry in a research role. They are also employed in academic institutes, where in addition to pursuing their research, they may also be involved with teaching undergraduates, training graduate students, and collaborating with post-doctoral fellows.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates that jobs in the biochemist, combined with the statistics of biophysicists, field would increase by 31% between 2004 and 2014 because of the demand in medical research and development of new drugs and products, and the preservation of the environment.

Because of a biochemists&#x27; background in both biology and chemistry, they may also be employed in the medical, industrial, governmental, and environmental fields. Slightly more than half of the biological scientists are employed by the Federal State and local governments. The field of medicine includes nutrition, genetics, biophysics, and pharmacology; industry includes beverage and food technology, toxicology, and vaccine production; while the governmental and environmental fields includes forensic science, wildlife management, marine biology, and viticulture.

The average income of a biochemist was $82,150 in 2017. The range of the salaries begin around 44,640 to 153,810, reported in 2017. The Federal Government in 2005 reported the average salaries in different fields associated with biochemistry and being a biochemist. General biological scientists in nonsupervisory, supervisory, and managerial positions earned an average salary of $69,908; microbiologists, $80,798; ecologists, $72,021; physiologists, $93,208; geneticists, $85,170; zoologists, $101,601; and botanists, $62,207.

<text>The Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI, ) is a science and technology museum in Portland, Oregon, United States. It contains three auditoriums, including a large-screen theatre, planetarium, and exhibition halls with a variety of hands-on permanent exhibits focused on natural sciences, industry, and technology, while transient exhibits span a wider range of disciplines.

==History==
Beginning in 1903, odd artifacts were displayed in hallways and alcoves in Portland City Hall arranged by Colonel L. L. Hawkins.
When the collection was evicted in 1936, about 12,000 artifacts were stored throughout the city.
On November 5, 1944, the Oregon Museum Foundation was founded with the mission of establishing an Oregon Museum of History, Science, and Industry. It displayed its first collection of natural history objects at the Portland Hotel. Subsequent small exhibits occurred around town to generate interest and donations. In 1949, a house at 908 NE Hassalo St. was donated by Ralph B Lloyd, the Lloyd of the Lloyd District and Lloyd Center to establish the museum. Within a year, the Pacific Northwest&#x27;s first public planetarium opened in a dome on the front lawn.

By 1955, OMSI&#x27;s annual attendance had grown to 25,000. The need for expansion led volunteers to build a new site at Washington Park, achieving the original goal of establishing a hands-on museum. It opened to the public on August 3, 1958, following a formal dedication by the governor on June 7. A planetarium was again included. The new building at the southwest corner of what was then Hoyt Park (now part of Washington Park) was located adjacent to the then-new site of the Portland Zoo (now the Oregon Zoo), which began a one-year phased move in the same month as the new OMSI was dedicated. The two attractions remained neighbors, sharing a parking lot, until 1992. The planetarium at the Washington Park site was originally a 90-seat facility housed in a temporary dome; in 1967, it was replaced by a larger 142-seat facility in a distinctive dodecahedral (12-sided) building equipped with a new projector.

===1992 move===

By the mid-1980s, 600,000 people per year were visiting the building, which was designed for only 100,000. Expansion at the Washington Park site was deemed infeasible, and in 1986 it was announced that the museum would move to a new location on the east bank of the Willamette River, where a much larger building would be constructed. Property that included the historic Station L power plant was donated by Portland General Electric, and building construction was paid for by a fundraising campaign. In 1992, OMSI opened at the new site, which continues to be the current location. (The building at the Washington Park site later became the Portland Children&#x27;s Museum.) The construction integrated the existing PGE turbine building and included the creation of a 330-seat OMNIMAX theater. The facility also includes a 200-seat planetarium with Digistar 3 technology.
===21st century===
In 2004, the Turbine Hall was closed from September through November for renovations in which the Discovery Space and Technology Lab changed places and a new Inventors Ballroom was added. Also added were a small staging area for public exhibit demonstrations and a bridge connecting a new metal staircase with the mezzanine exhibits.

The museum started planning for an expansion of the facility in 2006. In 2008, OMSI began finalizing the plans for the expansion, which was estimated to cost about $500 million and would double the size of the museum. They began working to secure the funds for the expansion in 2009, but decided to hold off on the plans in 2010 after the poor economy had made it difficult to try to raise funds for the project. In 2023, the city of Portland Design Commission approved a new hub in Central Eastside. This hub would be designed for science learning, arts, and culture. These plans would renovate a 10-block district and construct 1,200 units of housing space (with a focus on Indigenous heritage) and public green space.

The OMNIMAX dome theater closed in September 2013 for conversion into a conventional flat-screen movie theater that is not IMAX but still has an extra-large screen, about four stories tall. Renamed the Empirical Theater, it reopened in December 2013.

As part of the COVID-19 pandemic, the museum received between $2 million and $5 million in federally backed small business loans from Heritage Bank as part of the Paycheck Protection Program.

==Exhibits and attractions==
OMSI has five different specialized exhibit halls, a planetarium, and a submarine exhibit.

===USS &quot;Blueback&quot;===

The was purchased by OMSI in February 1994. This submarine appeared in the 1990 film &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; before being towed to its present location, a pier adjacent to the museum. It was opened to the public on May 15, 1994, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in September 2008. The propeller is a National Submarine Memorial located outside of the main museum area, beside the Eastbank Esplanade. The submarine is available for daily guided tours and sleepovers.

===Featured Exhibit Hall===
The Featured Exhibit Hall is used for temporary exhibits created by OMSI or those brought in from museums around the world. Past exhibits have included &quot;Grossology&quot; (Winter–Spring 2001), &quot;Giants of the Gobi&quot; (1997), &quot;A T-rex named Sue&quot; (September 2001 – January 2002), and &quot;CSI: The Experience&quot; (May–September 2009). Gunther von Hagens&#x27; &quot;Body Worlds 3&quot;, opened on June 7, 2007, and closed on October 7, 2007. By late September 2007, the exhibit had received 300,000 visitors, setting the record as OMSI&#x27;s most visited traveling exhibit. In September 2015, OMSI hosted the National Guitar Museum&#x27;s exhibition &quot;GUITAR: The Instrument That Rocked the World.&quot;
===Turbine Hall===

The Turbine Hall is named for the large retired steam turbine from its days as a PGE power plant. It features exhibits about engineering, physics, chemistry, and space travel. The Turbine Hall has two floors. On the main floor are the large exhibits and enrichment areas. On the mezzanine there are smaller exhibits.

The Innovation Station includes hands-on exhibits related to technology and invention. Laboratories for physics, chemistry, technology, and laser holography are connected to the Turbine Hall.

The Chemistry Lab is the first hands-on wet chemistry laboratory in the nation. There are six stations that allow visitors to learn about chemical interactions by participating in experiments that share a common theme. Themes rotate weekly and include the chemistry of toys, the nature of matter, biochemistry, environmental chemistry, industrial chemistry, chemical reactions, everyday chemistry, and crime scene chemistry. Chemical reaction demonstrations are given daily and are often related to the weekly theme.

Physics Lab exhibits include a Van de Graaff generator (a static electricity generator), motion detectors, electrical circuits, Morse code, magnets, computers that simulate basic properties of physics, and musical instruments.

The Laser/Holography Lab, which is open for approximately one hour every day, presents 30-minute demonstrations constructing a hologram.

The Vernier Technology Lab investigates the impact of technology on society. Rotating interactive exhibits allow visitors to investigate technologies such as robots and computers, security technology, biomedical technology, communications technology, and household technology. Visitors can also use a wide variety of educational software on internet-connected computers.

===Life Sciences Hall===
The Life Sciences Hall, on the second floor of the museum, offers exhibits about biology. These include a collection of preserved fetuses at nearly every stage of development, from a few weeks after conception to full-term, and the exhibit Amazing Feats of Aging, which is concerned with the biology of aging. One of the features of this exhibit is the Age Machine, a computer program that allows visitors to capture and then &quot;age&quot; a picture of themselves. The Life Sciences Hall also contains the Life Science Laboratory and the Earth Science Hall.

The Life Sciences Laboratory houses a wide variety of live animals, such as rats, walking sticks, chameleons, Madagascar hissing cockroaches, other mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and insects. Volunteers and staff members demonstrate and lead a variety of a group activities such as owl pellet dissections and exploration of the differences between male and female skulls and pelvises.

===Earth Science Hall===
The Earth Science Hall, located on the second floor, features geology-oriented exhibits and two specialized laboratories. The Watershed Laboratory gives visitors an experience in constructing an erosion cycle out of a physical model of a river. Visitors can learn about the life cycle of salmon and investigate microscopic organisms from local waterways through a video microscope. Visitors to the Paleontology Laboratory watch staff members and volunteers excavating fossils, such as dinosaur bones.

===Science Playground===

The Science Playground, in the early childhood education area on the second floor of the museum, is designed for families with newborn to six-year-old children. The area is fully enclosed and designed to keep children visible and secure, while giving them freedom to explore at will. Its purpose is to give children the opportunity to develop interactive scientific learning through play. It contains a variety of experimental stations intended to encourage natural curiosity including a stimulating infant area, a giant sandbox, a water area, a reading area, and physical science exhibits. The area is staffed by trained specialists in early childhood education. There is also a Parent Resource Corner with reference materials on topics ranging from the developing brain to behavior intervention techniques.

The Animal Secrets exhibit encourages children and parents to explore the hidden habitats and lives of forest animals. Visitors can crawl through the roots of a discovery tree, look for animals in a cave and a chipmunk den, play in a woodland stream, and be a naturalist for a day. Animal Secrets features English and Spanish text panels.

The Discovery Laboratory offers rotating experiments and activities such as exploring Flubber or ice cube painting. Themed Discovery Drawers encourage parents to teach their own children about the contents. OMSI is a member of Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network, and participates in NanoDays.

===Planetarium===
Computer-aided astronomy and laser light shows are performed daily in the Harry C. Kendall Planetarium (previously the M. J. Murdock Sky Theater).

=== Best Buy Teen Tech Center ===
On February 1, 2020, the Best Buy Teen Tech Center opened. As a partnership between Best Buy and The Clubhouse Network, the Teen Tech Center is a free, out-of-school space for teens to explore their ideas, develop skills, and express themselves through technology. Available technology includes programming, filmmaking, music production, and graphic design.

===Theory Eatery===
Theory Eatery, or simply Theory, is an American cuisine restaurant opened on January 30, 2013, as an addition to OMSI. Located alongside the Willamette River in the Central Eastside Industrial District, the restaurant has of dining space. Mark Patel, former developer director of OMSI, was behind the creation of the restaurant, which is operated by Bon Appétit Management Company. The restaurant is part of the museum, also offering exhibits, science demonstrations, and public and private events. The former head chef was Ryan Morgan. In 2023, Theory reopened under Epicurean Group management.

Theory is located off of the Willamette River, with views of the Tilikum Crossing, Marquam Bridge, and the downtown Portland skyline. In November 2013, the restaurant was redesigned, and included a new mural of photographed ingredients arranged with formulas in the background, designed by OMSI graphic artist Melissa Hicks.

==Auditoriums==

OMSI contains both an ultra-large-screen theater (which replaced an OMNIMAX theater in 2013) and a large auditorium with a stage where annual events such as science fairs occur. Science fairs that take place in the main auditorium include OHSU&#x27;s Brain Awareness, Safety Safari, and the Reptile and Amphibian Show. The auditorium is also used for private events.

==Educational outreach==
OMSI operates the largest science museum outreach program in the country. The museum offers presentations in schools, summer science camp programs for individuals, and outdoor school programs for school groups on the Oregon Coast at Camp Gray and in the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument at Hancock Field Station. OMSI is a frequent site for field trips, primarily for grades K-12, from all over the region. OMSI also runs several educational star parties in the Portland area at L.L. &quot;Stub&quot; Stewart State Park and Rooster Rock State Park for events such as the solstice and meteor showers, which helps teach the public about astronomy during this outreach.

OMSI offers Science Communication Fellowships for current STEM professionals. This program is open to industry or academic researchers or science professionals interested in improving their scientific communication, which includes university faculty, graduate students, technicians, or other individuals in science-, engineering-, health-, or technology-related positions. Fellows who are chosen participate in a series of communication training workshops and develop their own hands-on demonstration based on their work. Lastly, fellows participate in OMSI&#x27;s Meet a Scientist program to engage with the museum visitors with their demonstration.

==Funding and volunteer support==
OMSI is a non-profit organization and is funded by admissions, member contributions, public and private donations, community agencies, federal grants, and fundraising events. The largest OMSI fundraising event each year is the OMSI Gala, a black-tie party in May where visitors gather to show support for science education.

Although it is staffed with full- and part-time employees, much of the museum is dependent on volunteers who perform many of the same duties as staff members such as greeting visitors, customer service, and performing exhibit demonstrations. The volunteers include high school and college students as well as other community members. Volunteers serve in a wide range of areas within the museum, both onstage and off. After 50 hours of service, all volunteers receive a free one-year museum membership.

The Teen Science Alliance, OMSI&#x27;s youth volunteer program, takes place both during the summer and during the school year. As a part of the program, participants attend weekly classes focusing on developing communication and customer service skills and practice these skills by performing demonstrations on the museum floor. Participants also develop an original science demonstration for presentation to the public at the end of each session.

<text>Henry Thomas Buckle (24 November 1821 – 29 May 1862) was an English historian, the author of an unfinished &quot;History of Civilization&quot; and a strong amateur chess player. He is sometimes called &quot;the Father of Scientific History&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Buckle, the son of Thomas Henry Buckle (1779–1840), a wealthy London merchant and shipowner, and his wife, Jane Middleton (d. 1859) of Yorkshire, was born at Lee, London (Kent County) on 24 November 1821. He had two sisters. His father died in January 1840.

===Education===
As a boy, Buckle&#x27;s &quot;delicate health&quot; rendered him unsuited for the usual formal education or games of middle-class youth. However, he loved reading. That made him suitable to be &quot;educated at home by his mother, to whom he was devoted until her death in 1859. She taught him to read the Bible, the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, and Shakespeare. His father read theology and literature and occasionally recited Shakespeare to the family in the evenings.&quot;

Buckle&#x27;s one year of formal education was in Gordon House School at age fourteen. When his father offered him a reward for winning a prize in mathematics, Buckle asked &quot;to be taken away from school&quot;. From then on he was self-taught. As such, Buckle said later, &quot;I was never much tormented with what is called education, but allowed to pursue my own way undisturbed... Whatever I may now be supposed to know I taught myself&quot;.

At 19, Buckle first gained distinction as a chess player. He was known as one of the best in the world. In matchplay, he defeated Lionel Kieseritzky and Johann Löwenthal.

===Father&#x27;s death===
Buckle&#x27;s father died in 1840. Buckle inherited £20,000. This inheritance allowed Buckle to live the rest of his life in reading, writing, and travel.

==Writing &quot;History of Civilization in England&quot;==
In July 1840, Buckle, his mother, and his sister Mary spent almost a year in Europe, with &quot;extended stays in Germany, Italy, and France. Buckle studied the language, literature, and history of each place they visited&quot;. Buckle taught himself to read 18 foreign languages.

By 1840, Buckle had decided &quot;to direct all his reading and to devote all his energies to the preparation of some great historical work&quot;. During the next seventeen years he worked ten hours a day toward that purpose. By 1851, Buckle had decided that his &quot;great historical work&quot; would be &quot;a history of civilization&quot;. During the next six years, he was engaged &quot;in writing and rewriting, altering and revising the first volume&quot;. It was titled the &quot;History of Civilization in England&quot; and was published in June 1857.

==Private life==
Because he was uneasy about his health, Buckle &quot;rose, worked, walked, dined, and retired with remarkable regularity&quot;. His inheritance &quot;enabled him to live comfortably&quot;, but he spent money prudently with two exceptions: fine cigars and his collection of 22,000 books. Buckle and his mother enjoyed giving dinners for friends and dining out. Buckle was mostly deemed to be &quot;a good conversationalist&quot; because of his &quot;deep knowledge of a wide range of subjects&quot;. On the other hand, some thought him &quot;tedious or egotistical&quot; with a tendency &quot;to dominate conversations&quot;. He won the first British chess tournament in 1849.

==False accusation==
The pornographic publisher John Camden Hotten claimed that his series of flagellation reprints &quot;The Library Illustrative of Social Progress&quot; had been taken from Buckle&#x27;s collection, but that was untrue, as reported by Henry Spencer Ashbee.

==Death of his mother (1859)==
On 1 April 1859, Buckle&#x27;s mother died. Shortly afterward, under the influence of this &quot;crushing and desolating affliction&quot;, he added an argument for immortality to a review he was writing of John Stuart Mill&#x27;s essay &quot;On Liberty&quot;. Buckle&#x27;s argument was not based on theologians &quot;with their books, their dogmas, their traditions, their rituals, their records, and their other perishable contrivances&quot;. Rather he based his argument on &quot;the universality of the affections; the yearning of every mind to care for something out of itself&quot;. Buckle asserted that &quot;it is in the need of loving and of being loved, that the highest instincts of our nature are first revealed.&quot;

As if reflecting on his mother&#x27;s death, Buckle continued that &quot;as long as we are with those whom we love..., we rejoice. But when &quot;the enemy [death]&quot; approaches, &quot;when the very signs of life are mute ... and there lies before us nought save the shell and husk of what we loved too well, then truly, if we believed the separation were final ... the best of us would succumb, but for the deep conviction that all is not really over.&quot; We have &quot;a forecast of another and a higher state&quot;. Thus, Buckle concludeD, &quot;it is, then, to that sense of immortality with which the affections inspire us, that I would appeal for the best proof of the reality of a future life&quot;.

He also wrote, &quot;If immortality be untrue it matters little if anything else be true or not.&quot;

==Other women in life==
Although love for his mother dominated his life, there were other instances of his love for women. At 17, he fell in love with a cousin and &quot;challenged a man to whom she was engaged&quot;. He fell for another cousin, but his parents objected.

In 1861, when Buckle went to Egypt, he invited &quot;one Elizabeth Faunch, the widow of a carpenter, to join him... Mrs. Faunch refused his invitation, but there is some evidence that the two had been engaged in a liaison for some time&quot;.

==Last travels and death==
The death of his mother in 1859 combined with the exhausting work on the second volume of the &quot;History of Civilization in England&quot;, and its publication in 1861 invoked a decision by Buckle to go to Egypt to recover from exhaustion. He toured Egypt. Then, feeling better, Buckle traveled to Palestine and Syria. He died of typhoid fever in Damascus, Syria, on 29 May 1862 and was buried there. A sister provided a gravestone with the epitaph &quot;I know that he shall rise again&quot;. The sister of the British consul in Damascus added, &quot;The written word remains long after the writer; The writer is resting under the earth, but his works endure&quot;.

==&quot;Buckle&#x27;s Trichotomy&quot;==
A quote attributed to Buckle which has stood the test of time. Attested by Charles Stewart (of Achara, Appin, Argyllshire), a Scottish nobleman, in his 1901 autobiography, Buckle notes, &quot;Men and women range themselves into three classes or orders of intelligence ; you can tell the lowest class by their habit of always talking about persons; the next by the fact that their habit is always to converse about things; the highest, by their preference for the discussion of ideas&quot;.

==&quot;History of Civilization in England&quot;==
The description of &quot;History of Civilization in England&quot; is taken from the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition (1911):

Buckle&#x27;s fame rests mainly on his &quot;History of Civilization in England&quot;. It is a gigantic unfinished introduction of which the plan was firstly to state the general principles of the author&#x27;s method and the general laws that govern the course of human progress and secondly to exemplify these principles and laws through the histories of certain nations characterized by prominent and peculiar features: Spain, Scotland, the United States and Germany. The completed work was to have extended to 14 volumes; its chief ideas are:

# That, owing partly to the want of ability in historians, and partly to the complexity of social phenomena, extremely little had as yet been done towards discovering the principles that govern the character and destiny of nations, or, in other words, towards establishing a science of history;
# That, while the theological dogma of predestination is a barren hypothesis beyond the province of knowledge, and the metaphysical dogma of free will rests on an erroneous belief in the infallibility of consciousness, it is proved by science, and especially by statistics, that human actions are governed by laws as fixed and regular as those that rule in the physical world;
# That climate, soil, food, and the aspects of nature are the primary causes of intellectual progress: the first three indirectly, through determining the accumulation and distribution of wealth, and the last by directly influencing the accumulation and distribution of thought, the imagination being stimulated and the understanding subdued when the phenomena of the external world are sublime and terrible, the understanding being emboldened and the imagination curbed when they are small and feeble;
# That the great division between European and non-European civilization turns on the fact that in Europe man is stronger than nature, and that elsewhere nature is stronger than man, the consequence of which is that in Europe alone has man subdued nature to his service;
# That the advance of European civilization is characterized by a continually diminishing influence of physical laws, and a continually increasing influence of mental laws;
# That the mental laws that regulate the progress of society cannot be discovered by the metaphysical method, that is, by the introspective study of the individual mind, but only by such a comprehensive survey of facts as enable us to eliminate disturbances, that is, by the method of averages;
# That human progress has been due, not to moral agencies, which are stationary, and which balance one another in such a manner that their influence is unfelt over any long period, but to intellectual activity, which has been constantly varying and advancing: &quot;The actions of individuals are greatly affected by their moral feelings and passions; but these being antagonistic to the passions and feelings of other individuals, are balanced by them, so that their effect is, in the great average of human affairs, nowhere to be seen, and the total actions of mankind, considered as a whole, are left to be regulated by the total knowledge of which mankind is possessed&quot;;
# That individual efforts are insignificant in the great mass of human affairs, and that great men, although they exist, and must &quot;at present&quot; be looked upon as disturbing forces, are merely the creatures of the age to which they belong;
# That religion, literature and government are, at the best, the products and not the causes of civilization;
# That the progress of civilization varies directly as &quot;scepticism&quot;, the disposition to doubt and to investigate, and inversely as &quot;credulity&quot; or &quot;the protective spirit&quot;, a disposition to maintain, without examination, established beliefs and practices.

===Assessments===
====&quot;The North American Review&quot; (1861)====
&quot;The North American Review&quot; characterized Buckle as a &quot;self-styled historian of civilization&quot;. He &quot;ransacks all history, history, literature, and science for proofs and illustrations of his preconceived opinion&quot;. Furthermore, &quot;the absurdity of the conclusions to which he is led furnishes, perhaps, the best proof of the erroneousness of his method and the falsity of his premises&quot;. In conclusion, &quot;under the guise of a history, [the book&#x27;s] only aim is to teach the preconceived conclusions of a false and debasing philosophy&quot;.

====&quot;The New York Times&quot; (1861)====
There was a review of Buckle&#x27;s &quot;History of Civilization in England. Vol II&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The review concluded, &quot;notwithstanding these imperfections, we still regard the &quot;History of Civilization&quot; as perhaps the most important contribution to modern historical science... It is easy for one to make a great many very superficial objections to Mr. Buckle&#x27;s mode of treating history..., but the more one comes up with the grandeur of his method, the less disposition there will be to make such objections... His influence on the thought of the present age cannot but be enormous; and if he gives us no more than we already have in the two volumes of the magnum opus, he will still be classed among the fathers and founders of the Science of History&quot;.

====&quot;The Portland Daily Press&quot; (1862)====
A review of Buckle&#x27;s newly published &quot;Essays&quot; appeared in the direct predecessor of the &quot;Portland Press Herald&quot; on Saturday, 27 December 1862. The editors wrote of Buckle: &quot;a solitary unremitting student, with no encouragement save from the home circle, and no opportunity of measuring himself with rivals, he naturally, with all his wealth of learning, command of language, and vigor of thinking, fell into those pitfalls of rashness and inaccuracy which lie in wait for the recluse&quot;.

====Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;Notes From Underground&quot; (1864)====
The paranoid narrator of Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;Notes From Underground&quot; discusses Buckle&#x27;s theories: &quot;Why, to maintain this theory of the regeneration of mankind by means of the pursuit of his own is to my mind almost the same thing... as to affirm, for instance, following Buckle, that through civilisation mankind becomes softer, and consequently less bloodthirsty and less fitted for warfare. Logically it does seem to follow from his arguments. But man has such a predilection for systems and abstract deductions that he is ready to distort the truth intentionally, he is ready to deny the evidence of his senses only to justify his logic. I take this example because it is the most glaring instance of it. Only look about you: blood is being spilt in streams, and in the merriest way, as though it were champagne. Take the whole of the nineteenth century in which Buckle lived. Take Napoleon—the Great and also the present one. Take North America—the eternal union [an ironic reference to the ongoing American Civil War]. Take the farce of Schleswig-Holstein... And what is it that civilisation softens in us? The only gain of civilisation for mankind is the greater capacity for variety of sensations—and absolutely nothing more&quot;.

====The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (1910)====
Buckle did not define the general conceptions with which he worked: &quot;civilization&quot;, &quot;history&quot;, &quot;science&quot;, &quot;law&quot;. Therefore, &quot;his arguments are often fallacies&quot;. Furthermore, &quot;he sometimes altered and contorted the facts&quot; and &quot;he very often unduly simplified his problems&quot;. Nevertheless, &quot;many of his ideas... have been more precisely elaborated by later writers on sociology and history&quot; and his work was immensely valuable in provoking further research and speculation&quot;.

====John William Cousin (1910)====
Buckle is remembered for treating history as an exact science, which is why many of his ideas have passed into the common literary stock, and have been more precisely elaborated by later writers on sociology and history because of his careful scientific analyses. Nevertheless, his work is not free from one-sided views and generalisations resting on insufficient data.

====Robert Bierstedt (1981)====
In his &quot;History of Civilization in England&quot;, &quot;Buckle criticized historians on the ground that they were too much interested in biography and in military and political history and failed to seek universal principle or laws&quot;. In contrast, &quot;Buckle was confident that it was possible to construct a science of society on the basic of inductions from history&quot;. His difficulty was the &quot;sheer quantity of materials that would have to be mastered.&quot; Herbert Spencer said that Buckle &quot;&#x27;took in&#x27; more than he was able to organize&quot;.

<text>Racing games are a video game genre in which the player participates in a racing competition. They may be based on anything from real-world racing leagues to fantastical settings. They are distributed along a spectrum between more realistic racing simulations and more fantastical arcade-style racing games. Kart racing games emerged in the 1990s as a popular sub-genre of the latter. Racing games may also fall under the category of sports video games.

==Sub-genres==

===Arcade-style racing===
Usually, arcade-style racing games put fun and a fast-paced experience above all else, as cars usually compete in unique ways. A key feature of arcade-style racers that specifically distinguishes them from simulation racers is their far more liberal physics. Whereas in real racing (and subsequently, the simulation equivalents) the driver must reduce their speed significantly to take most turns, arcade-style racing games generally encourage the player to &quot;powerslide&quot; the car to allow the player to keep up their speed by drifting through a turn. Collisions with other racers, track obstacles, or traffic vehicles is usually much more exaggerated than simulation racers as well. For the most part, arcade-style racers simply remove the precision and rigor required from the simulation experience and focus strictly on the racing element itself. They often license real cars and leagues, but are equally open to more exotic settings and vehicles. Races take place on highways, windy roads, or in cities; they can be multiple-lap circuits or point-to-point sprints, with one or multiple paths sometimes with checkpoints, or other types of competition, like demolition derby, jumping, or testing driving skills. Popular arcade-style racing franchises include &quot;Battle Gear&quot;, &quot;Out Run&quot;, &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;, &quot;Daytona USA&quot;, &quot;Need for Speed&quot;, &quot;Sega Rally&quot;, &quot;Cruis&#x27;n&quot;, &quot;Burnout&quot;, &quot;Rush&quot;, &quot;Midnight Club&quot;, &quot;Project Gotham Racing&quot;, &quot;TrackMania&quot;, &quot;MotorStorm&quot; and &quot;Forza Horizon&quot;.

Conversely, many arcade racing games in amusement arcades frequently use hydraulic motion simulator arcade cabinets that simulate the look and feel of driving or riding a vehicle. For example, a motorbike that the player sits on and moves around to control the on-screen action, or a car-like cabinet (with seats, steering wheel, pedals and gear stick) that moves around in sync with the on-screen action. This has been especially common for arcade racing games from Sega since the 1980s. However, this can typically only be found in arcade racing games for amusement arcades, rather than arcade-style racing games for home systems.

During the mid-late 2000s there was a trend of new street racing; imitating the import scene, one can tune sports compacts and sports cars and race them on the streets. The most widely known ones are the &quot;Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition&quot; and the &quot;Midnight Club&quot; series, certain entries in the &quot;Need for Speed&quot; and &quot;Test Drive&quot; series, &quot;Initial D&quot; series, the &quot;Juiced&quot; series and &quot;FlatOut 2&quot;. Some arcade-style racing games increase the competition between racers by adding weapons that can be used against opponents to slow them down or otherwise impede their progress so they can be passed. This is a staple feature in kart racing games such as the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series, but this kind of game mechanic also appears in standard, car-based racing games as well. Weapons can range from projectile attacks to traps as well as non-combative items like speed boosts. Weapon-based racing games include games such as &quot;Full Auto&quot;, &quot;Rumble Racing&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Re-Volt&quot; and &quot;Blur&quot;. There are also Vehicular combat games that employ racing games elements: for example, racing has been featured as a game mode in popular vehicular combat franchises such as &quot;Twisted Metal&quot;, &quot;Destruction Derby&quot; and &quot;Carmageddon&quot;.

===Simulation racing===
Simulation style racing games strive to convincingly replicate the handling of a real automobile. They often license real cars or racing leagues, but will sometimes use fantasy cars built to resemble real ones if unable to acquire an official license for them. Vehicular behavior physics are a key factor in the experience. The rigors of being a professional race driver are usually also included (such as having to deal with a car&#x27;s tire condition and fuel level). Proper cornering technique and precision racing maneuvers (such as trail braking) are given priority in simulation racing games.

Although these racing simulators are specifically built for people with a high grade of driving skill, it is not uncommon to find aids that can be enabled from the game menu. The most common aids are traction control (TC), anti-lock brakes (ABS), steering assistance, damage resistance, clutch assistance, and automatic gear changes.

Sound plays a crucial role in player feedback in racing games, with the engine and tire sounds communicating what is physically happening to the car. The three main elements of car audio are intake, exhaust, and internal engine sounds. Recorded samples of those elements are implemented in-game by methods such as granular synthesis, loop-based modelling, or physical modeling. Tire sounds modulate loop samples or pitch based on slip angle and deformation to let the player know the limit of grip. The best sounding games effectively integrate the sound model with the vehicle and tire simulation models.

Some of these racing simulators are customizable, as game fans have decoded the tracks, cars, and executable files. Internet communities have grown around the simulators regarded as the most realistic and many websites host internet championships. Some of these racing simulators consist of &quot;Forza Motorsport&quot;, &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;, &quot;GTR2&quot;, &quot;Assetto Corsa&quot;, &quot;iRacing&quot;, &quot;Project CARS&quot;, &quot;Automobilista 2&quot; and many more.

===Kart racing===

Kart racing games have simplified driving mechanics while adding obstacles, unusual track designs and various action elements. Kart racers are also known to cast characters known from various platform games or cartoon television series as the drivers of &quot;wacky&quot; vehicles. Kart racing games are a more arcade-like experience than other racing games and usually offer modes in which player characters can shoot projectiles at one another or collect power-ups. Typically, in such games, vehicles move more alike go-karts, lacking anything along the lines of a gear stick and clutch pedal.

While car combat elements date back to earlier titles such as Taito&#x27;s &quot;Crashing Race&quot; in 1976, the kart racing subgenre was popularized by Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; in 1992 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), which spawned the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series. The game was slower than other racing games of the time due to hardware limitations, prompting the developers to use a go-kart theme for the game. Since then, over 50 kart racing games have been released, featuring characters ranging from Nicktoons to &quot;South Park&quot;.

===Anti-gravity racing===
Anti-gravity racing games are a type of racing game where players use vehicles that hover or glide using anti-gravity technology to race against the clock or other competitors. These games often feature science fiction themes, with high-tech vehicles and futuristic track designs. A number of anti-gravity racing games may also feature vehicular combat elements.

In the arcades, anti-gravity racing games (originally known as futuristic racers) date back to the 1980s. The laserdisc games &quot;Star Rider&quot; (1983) and &quot;Cosmos Circuit&quot; (1984) featured animated racing, using animated laserdisc video for the backgrounds. Alpha Denshi&#x27;s &quot;Splendor Blast&quot; (1985) combined &quot;Pole Position&quot; style racing with &quot;Zaxxon&quot; style sci-fi vehicles, space settings and shoot &#x27;em up elements. &quot;STUN Runner&quot; (1989) by Atari Games featured 3D polygon graphics and allowed players to blast other vehicles.

On home consoles, anti-gravity racing games were defined by Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;F-Zero&quot; (1990) for the SNES, which spawned the &quot;F-Zero&quot; series. The PlayStation game &quot;Wipeout&quot; (1995) by Psygnosis featured 3D polygon graphics and spawned the &quot;Wipeout&quot; series. The &quot;F-Zero&quot; series subsequently made the transition to 3D polygon graphics with &quot;F-Zero X&quot; (1998) for the Nintendo 64.

==History==
===1941–1976: Electro-mechanical driving games===
The basis for racing video games were arcade driving electro-mechanical games (EM games). The earliest mechanical racing arcade game dates back to 1900, when the London-based Automatic Sports Company manufactured a mechanical yacht racing game, &quot;Yacht Racer&quot;. Mechanical car driving games later originated from British amusement arcades in the 1930s. In the United States, International Mutoscope Reel Company adapted these British arcade driving games into the electro-mechanical game &quot;Drive Mobile&quot; (1941), which had an upright arcade cabinet similar to what arcade video games would later use. A steering wheel was used to control a model car over a road painted on a metal drum, with the goal being to keep the car centered as the road shifts left and right. Kasco introduced this type of driving game to Japan as &quot;Mini Drive&quot; in 1958. Capitol Projector&#x27;s 1954 machine &quot;Auto Test&quot; was a driving test simulation that used film reel to project pre-recorded driving video footage, awarding the player points for making correct decisions as the footage is played. These early EM driving games consisted of only the player vehicle on the road, with no rival cars to race against.

EM driving games later evolved in Japan, with Kasco&#x27;s 1968 racing game &quot;Indy 500&quot;, which was licensed by Chicago Coin for release in North America as &quot;Speedway&quot; in 1969. It had a circular racetrack with rival cars painted on individual rotating discs illuminated by a lamp, which produced colorful graphics projected using mirrors to give a pseudo-3D first-person perspective on a screen, resembling a windscreen view. The gameplay involved players driving down a circular road while dodging cars to avoid crashing, and it resembled a prototypical arcade racing video game, with an upright cabinet, yellow marquee, three-digit scoring, coin box, steering wheel and accelerator pedal. &quot;Indy 500&quot; sold over 2,000 arcade cabinets in Japan, while &quot;Speedway&quot; sold over 10,000 cabinets in North America, becoming one of the biggest arcade hits of the 1960s. Taito&#x27;s similar 1970 rear-projection driving game &quot;Super Road 7&quot; involved driving a car down an endlessly scrolling road while having to dodge cars, which formed the basis for Taito&#x27;s 1974 racing video game &quot;Speed Race&quot;.

One of the last successful electro-mechanical arcade games was &quot;F-1&quot;, a racing game developed and released by Namco in 1976, and distributed in North America by Atari the same year. The gameplay is viewed from the perspective of the driver&#x27;s viewpoint, which is displayed on the screen using a projector system. It was Japan&#x27;s highest-grossing arcade game for two years in a row, in 1976 and 1977. &quot;F-1&quot; is believed to have been influenced by &quot;Indy 500&quot;, and would in turn be influential on Namco&#x27;s racing video games in the 1980s. Another notable EM game from the 1970s was &quot;The Driver&quot;, a racing-action game released by Kasco (Kansai Seiki Seisakusho Co.) that used 16 mm film to project full motion video on screen, though its gameplay had limited interaction, requiring the player to match their steering wheel, accelerator and brakes with movements shown on screen, much like the sequences in later LaserDisc games.

===1970: Mainframe racing game===
The BBC television program Tomorrow&#x27;s World broadcast a mainframe computer racing game played between TV presenter Raymond Baxter and British two-time Formula One world champion Graham Hill on their 1970 Christmas special, broadcast on Christmas Eve, 1970. The game was written by IBM-employee, Ray Bradshaw, using CALL/360 and required two data centre operators to input the instructions.

===1972–1988: Top-down 2D racing video games===

Atari founder Nolan Bushnell had the idea for a driving video game in the early 1970s. When he was a college student, he worked at an arcade where he became familiar with EM driving games, watching customers play and helping to maintain the machinery, while learning how it worked and developing his understanding of how the game business operates. When he founded Atari, Bushnell had originally planned to develop a driving video game, influenced by &quot;Speedway&quot;, but they ended up developing &quot;Pong&quot; (1972) instead.

The earliest rudimentary racing video game to be released dates back to 1972, with the release of the first video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey. It included a game called &quot;Wipeout&quot;, where the player moves a dot around a race track that is outlined by an overlay placed on the television screen. It required the use of physical items to play, including a race game board, screen overlay, car tokens and pit stop cards. In 1973, Atari released &quot;Space Race&quot;, an arcade video game where players control spaceships that race against opposing ships, while avoiding comets and meteors. It is a competitive two-player game with black and white graphics and controlled with a two-way joystick. The following year, Atari released the first driving video game in the arcades, &quot;Gran Trak 10&quot;, which presents an overhead single-screen view of the track in low resolution white-on-black graphics. It inspired the Kee Games clone &quot;Formula K&quot;, which sold 5,000 arcade cabinets.

In late 1974, Taito released &quot;Speed Race&quot; designed by Tomohiro Nishikado (of &quot;Space Invaders&quot; fame), in which the player drives down a straight track dodging other cars. The game used vertical scrolling, inspired by two older electro-mechanical games: Kasco&#x27;s &quot;Mini Drive&quot; and Taito&#x27;s &quot;Super Road 7&quot;. &quot;Speed Race&quot; was re-branded as &quot;Wheels&quot; by Midway Games for release in North America and was influential on later racing games. Midway also released another version, &quot;Racer&quot;, with a sit-down cabinet. &quot;Speed Race&quot; became a hit in Japan, while &quot;Wheels&quot; and &quot;Wheels II&quot; sold 10,000 cabinets in the United States. Its use of vertical scrolling was adopted by Atari&#x27;s &quot;Hi-way&quot; (1975), which introduced a sit-down cabinet similar to older electro-mechanical games.

In 1977, Atari released &quot;Super Bug&quot;, a racing game historically significant as &quot;the first game to feature a scrolling playfield&quot; in multiple directions. Sega&#x27;s &quot;Monaco GP&quot; (1979) was one of the most successful traditional 2D racing games, becoming the most popular arcade driving game in the US in 1981, and among the highest-grossing games that year, while making a record number of appearances on the &quot;RePlay&quot; arcade charts through 1987. In 1980, Namco&#x27;s overhead-view driving game &quot;Rally-X&quot; was one of the first games to have background music, and allowed scrolling in multiple directions, both vertical and horizontal. It also uses a radar, to show the rally car&#x27;s location on the map.

===1976–1992: Pseudo-3D racing video games===
In February 1976, Sega released the arcade game &quot;Road Race&quot;, which was re-worked into a motorbike variant &quot;Moto-Cross&quot;, also known as &quot;Man T.T.&quot; (released August 1976). It was then re-branded as &quot;Fonz&quot; in the US, as a tie-in for the popular sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot;. The game featured a three-dimensional perspective view, as well as haptic feedback, which caused the motorcycle handlebars to vibrate during a collision with another vehicle. In Spring 1976, the arcade game &quot;Nürburgring 1&quot; presented a first-person view. Considered the first &quot;scandalous&quot; arcade game, Exidy&#x27;s &quot;Death Race&quot; (1976) was widely criticized in the media for its violent content, which only served to substantially increase its popularity. Sega released a two-player version of &quot;Man T.T.&quot; called &quot;Twin Course T.T.&quot; in January 1977. 1979 saw the release of Vectorbeam&#x27;s &quot;Speed Freak&quot;, a three-dimensional vector racing game, which Killer List of Videogames calls &quot;very impressive and ahead of their time&quot;. &quot;Turbo&quot;, released by Sega in 1981, was the first racing game to use sprite scaling with full-color graphics.

&quot;Pole Position&quot;, developed by Namco and released by Atari in North America, was released in 1982. It is considered &quot;arguably the most important racing game ever made.&quot; It was an evolution of Namco&#x27;s earlier racing electro-mechanical games, notably &quot;F-1&quot; (1976), whose designer Sho Osugi worked on &quot;Pole Position&quot;. &quot;Pole Position&quot; was the first video game to be based on a real racing circuit, and the first with a qualifying lap, where the player needs to complete a time trial before they can compete in Grand Prix races. While not the first third-person racing video game (it was predated by Sega&#x27;s &quot;Turbo&quot;), &quot;Pole Position&quot; established the conventions of the genre and its success inspired numerous imitators. According to &quot;Electronic Games&quot;, for &quot;the first time in the amusement parlors, a first-person racing game gives a higher reward for passing cars and finishing among the leaders rather than just for keeping all four wheels on the road&quot;. According to IGN, it also &quot;introduced checkpoints,&quot; and its success, as &quot;the highest-grossing arcade game of 1983 in North America, cemented the genre in place for decades to come and inspired a horde of other racing games&quot;. It sold over 21,000 arcade cabinets in the US by 1983, and again became the highest-grossing arcade game of 1984 in the US.

Taito&#x27;s &quot;Laser Grand Prix&quot;, introduced in July 1983, was the first racing laserdisc game, using pre-recorded live-action footage. In 1984, several other racing laserdisc games followed, including Sega&#x27;s &quot;GP World&quot; with live-action footage and Universal&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; featuring 3D animated race car driving. The same year, Irem&#x27;s &quot;The Battle-Road&quot; was a vehicle combat racing game with branching paths and up to 32 possible routes. Geoff Crammond, who later developed the &quot;Grandprix&quot; series (Known collectively as GPX to its fanbase), produced what is considered the first attempt at a racing simulator on a home system, &quot;REVS&quot;, released for the BBC Microcomputer. The game offered an unofficial (and hence with no official team or driver names associated with the series) recreation of British Formula 3. The hardware capabilities limited the depth of the simulation and restricted it (initially) to one track, but it offered a semi-realistic driving experience with more detail than most other racing games at the time.

Since the mid-1980s, it became a trend for arcade racing games to use hydraulic motion simulator arcade cabinets. The trend was sparked by Sega&#x27;s &quot;taikan&quot; games, with &quot;taikan&quot; meaning &quot;body sensation&quot; in Japanese. The &quot;taikan&quot; trend began when Yu Suzuki&#x27;s team at Sega (later known as Sega AM2) developed &quot;Hang-On&quot; (1985), a racing video game where the player sits on and moves a motorbike replica to control the in-game actions. &quot;Hang-On&quot; was a Grand Prix style motorbike racer. It used force feedback technology and was also one of the first arcade games to use 16-bit graphics and Sega&#x27;s &quot;Super Scaler&quot; technology that allowed pseudo-3D sprite-scaling at high frame rates. &quot;Hang-On&quot; became the highest-grossing arcade game of 1986 in the United States, and one of the year&#x27;s highest-grossing arcade games in Japan and London.

Suzuki&#x27;s team at Sega followed it with hydraulic motion simulator cockpit cabinets for later racing games, notably &quot;Out Run&quot; (1986). It was one of the most graphically impressive games of its time, known for its pseudo-3D sprite-based driving engine, and it became an instant classic that spawned many sequels. It was also notable for giving the player the non-linear choice of which route to take through the game and the choice of soundtrack to listen to while driving, represented as radio stations. The game has up to five endings depending on the route taken, and each one was an ending sequence rather than a simple &quot;Congratulations&quot; as was common in game endings at the time. It became Sega&#x27;s best-selling arcade cabinet of the 1980s, with over 30,000 arcade cabinets sold worldwide. The same year, Durell released &quot;Turbo Esprit&quot;, which had an official Lotus license, and working car indicator lights.

In 1987, Square released &quot;Rad Racer&quot;, one of the first stereoscopic 3D games. In the same year, Atari produced &quot;RoadBlasters&quot;, a driving game that also involved a bit of shooting.

One of the last successful pseudo-3D arcade racers was Sega&#x27;s &quot;Super Monaco GP&quot; (1989), a simulation of the Monaco Grand Prix. It was the third highest-grossing arcade game of 1989 in Japan, and again the third highest-grossing arcade game of 1990 in Japan. In 1992, Nintendo released &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;, but it was known that it was pseudo-3D racing. Here it has items to affect players from racing and the referee, Lakitu will help you out to know the rules and rescue racers from falling down.

===1988–1994: Transition to 3D polygon graphics===
In 1988, Namco released &quot;Winning Run&quot;, which used 3D polygon graphics. It became the second highest-grossing arcade game of 1989 in Japan. In 1989, Atari released &quot;Hard Drivin&#x27;&quot;, another arcade driving game that used 3D polygon graphics. It uses force feedback, where the wheel fights the player during aggressive turns, and a crash replay camera view.

Sega produced &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; in 1992. While not the first arcade racing game with 3D graphics (it was predated by &quot;Winning Run&quot;, &quot;Hard Drivin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Stunts&quot;), it was able to combine the best features of games at the time, along with multiplayer machine linking and clean 3D graphics to produce a game that was above and beyond the arcade market standard of its time, laying the foundations for subsequent 3D racing games. It improved on earlier 3D racing games with more complex 3D models and backdrops, higher frame rate, and switchable camera angles including chase-cam and first-person views. IGN considers it the third most influential racing game of all time.

In 1993, Namco released &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;. Its 3D polygon graphics stood out for the use of Gouraud shading and texture mapping. And thus began the polygon war of driving games. Sega later released &quot;Daytona USA&quot;, which featured 3D polygon graphics with texture filtering. The following year, Electronic Arts produced &quot;The Need for Speed&quot;, which would later spawn one of the world&#x27;s most successful racing game series and one of the most successful video game series. In the same year, Midway introduced &quot;Crusin&#x27; USA&quot;.

===1989–1995: Emergence of sim racing subgenre===
The now defunct Papyrus Design Group produced their first attempt at a racing simulator in 1989, the critically acclaimed &quot;Indianapolis 500: The Simulation&quot;, designed by David Kaemmer and Omar Khudari. The game is generally regarded as the first true auto racing simulation on a personal computer. Accurately replicating the 1989 Indianapolis 500 grid, it offered advanced 3D graphics for its time, setup options, car failures and handling. Unlike most other racing games at the time, &quot;Indianapolis 500&quot; attempted to simulate realistic physics and telemetry, such as its portrayal of the relationship between the four contact patches and the pavement, as well as the loss of grip when making a high-speed turn, forcing the player to adopt a proper racing line and believable throttle-to-brake interaction. It includes a garage facility to allow players to enact modifications to their vehicle, including adjustments to the tires, shocks and wings. The damage modelling, while not accurate by today&#x27;s standards, was capable of producing some spectacular and entertaining pile-ups.

Crammond&#x27;s &quot;Formula One Grand Prix&quot; in 1992 became the new champion of sim racing, until the release of Papyrus&#x27; &quot;IndyCar Racing&quot; the following year. &quot;Formula One Grand Prix&quot; boasted detail that was unparalleled for a computer game at the time as well as a full recreation of the drivers, cars and circuits of the 1991 Formula One World Championship. However, the U.S. version (known as &quot;World Circuit&quot;) was not granted an official license by the FIA, so teams and drivers were renamed (though all could be changed back to their real names using the Driver/Team selection menu): Ayrton Senna became &quot;Carlos Sanchez&quot;, for example.

In 1995, &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot; introduced rally racing and featured cooperative gameplay alongside the usual competitive multiplayer. &quot;Sega Rally&quot; was also the first to feature driving on different surfaces (including asphalt, gravel, and mud) with different friction properties and the car&#x27;s handling changing accordingly, making it an important milestone in the genre.

===1996–present: Modern racing games===
During the early-to-mid-1990s, Sega and Namco largely had a monopoly on high-end arcade racing games with realistic 3D visuals. In 1996, a number of competitors attempted to challenge their dominance in the field, including Atari Games with &quot;San Francisco Rush: Extreme Racing&quot;, Gaelco with &quot;Speed Up&quot;, Jaleco with &quot;Super GT 24h&quot;, and Konami with &quot;Winding Heat&quot;. In 1996, Nintendo created a 3D game called &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; and has an action so that Lakitu needs to either reverse, rev up your engines to Rocket Start, or rescue players. &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; focused more on the items used. Atari didn&#x27;t join the 3D craze until 1997, when it introduced &quot;San Francisco Rush&quot;.

In 1997, &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; was released for the PlayStation, after being in production for five years since 1992. It was considered the most realistic racing simulation game in its time, combined with playability, enabling players of all skill levels to play. It offered a wealth of meticulous tuning options and introduced an open-ended career mode where players had to undertake driving tests to acquire driving licenses, earn their way into races and choose their own career path. The &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; series has since become the second-most successful racing game franchise of all time, selling over 80 million units worldwide as of April 2018.

By 1997, the typical PC was capable of matching an arcade machine in terms of graphical quality, mainly due to the introduction of first generation 3D accelerators such as 3DFX Voodoo. The faster CPUs were capable of simulating increasingly realistic physics, car control, and graphics.

&quot;Colin McRae Rally&quot; was introduced in 1998 to the PC world, and was a successful semi-simulation of the world of rally driving, previously only available in the less serious &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot;. &quot;Motorhead&quot;, a PC game, was later adapted back to arcade. In the same year, Sega releases &quot;Daytona USA 2&quot; (Battle On The Edge and Power Edition), which is one of the first racing games to feature realistic crashes and graphics.

The year 1999 introduced &quot;Crash Team Racing&quot;, a kart racing game featuring the characters from Crash Bandicoot. It was praised for its controls and courses. Crash Bandicoot and its racing series has continued, with the most recent game being &quot;Crash Team Racing: Nitro Fueled&quot; (June 2019). The year 1999 also marked a change of games into more &quot;free form&quot; worlds. &quot;Midtown Madness&quot; for the PC allows the player to explore a simplified version of the city of Chicago using a variety of vehicles and any path that they desire. In the arcade world, Sega introduced &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot;, a sandbox racing game where you are a taxi driver that needed to get the client to the destination in the shortest amount of time. A similar game also from Sega is &quot;Emergency Call Ambulance&quot;, with almost the same gameplay (pick up patient, drop off at hospital, as fast as possible). Games are becoming more and more realistic visually. Some arcade games are now featuring 3 screens to provide a surround view.

In 2000, Angel Studios (now Rockstar San Diego) introduced the first free-roaming, or the former &quot;free form&quot;, racing game on video game consoles and handheld game consoles with &quot;Midnight Club: Street Racing&quot; which released on the PlayStation 2 and Game Boy Advance. The game allowed the player to drive anywhere around virtual recreations of London and New York. Instead of using enclosed tracks for races, the game uses various checkpoints on the free roam map as the pathway of the race, giving the player the option to take various shortcuts or any other route to the checkpoints of the race.
In 2001 Namco released &quot;Wangan Midnight&quot; to the arcade and later released an upgrade called Wangan Midnight R. Wangan Midnight R was also ported to the PlayStation 2 by Genki as just Wangan Midnight.

In 2003, Rockstar San Diego&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Club II&quot; was the first racing game to feature both playable cars and playable motorcycles. Namco released a sort of sequel to &quot;Wangan Midnight R&quot; called &quot;Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune&quot;.

There is a wide gamut of driving games ranging from simple action-arcade racers like &quot;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&quot; (for Nintendo Switch) and &quot;Nicktoon Racers&quot; to ultra-realistic simulators like &quot;Grand Prix Legends&quot;, iRacing, &quot;Virtual Grand Prix 3&quot;, &quot;Live for Speed&quot;, &quot;NetKar Pro&quot;, &quot;Assetto Corsa&quot;, &quot;GT Legends&quot;, &quot;GTR2&quot;, &quot;rFactor&quot;, &quot;X Motor Racing&quot;, &quot;CarX Street&quot;, and iPad 3D racer &quot;Exhilarace&quot;.

<text>William Edward Hartpole Lecky, (26 March 1838 – 22 October 1903) was an Irish historian, essayist, and political theorist with Whig proclivities. His major work was an eight-volume &quot;History of England during the Eighteenth Century&quot;.

==Early life==
Born at Newtown Park, Stillorgan, Dublin, he was the eldest son of John Hartpole Lecky, a landowner.
He was educated at Kingstown, Armagh, at Cheltenham College, and at Trinity College Dublin, where he graduated with a BA in 1859 and MA in 1863, and where he studied divinity with a view to becoming a priest in the Church of Ireland.

==Career==
In 1860, Lecky published anonymously a small book entitled &quot;The Religious Tendencies of the Age&quot;, but on leaving college he turned to historiography. In 1861, he published &quot;Leaders of Public Opinion in Ireland&quot;, containing brief sketches of Jonathan Swift, Henry Flood, Henry Grattan and Daniel O&#x27;Connell, originally anonymous, republished in 1871; the essay on Swift, rewritten and amplified, appeared again in 1897 as an introduction to an edition of Swift&#x27;s works. Two surveys followed: &quot;A History of the Rise and Influence of Rationalism in Europe&quot; (2 vols., 1865), and &quot;A History of European Morals from Augustus to Charlemagne&quot; (2 vols., 1869). The latter aroused criticism, with its opening dissertation on &quot;the natural history of morals.&quot; Lecky&#x27;s &quot;History of European Morals&quot; was one of Mark Twain&#x27;s favorite books, and influenced the writing of &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot;.

Lecky then concentrated on his major work, &quot;A History of England during the Eighteenth Century&quot;, Vols. i. and ii. of which appeared in 1878, Vols. v. and vi in 1887, and Vols. vii. and viii., which completed the work, in 1890. In the &quot;cabinet&quot; edition of 1892, in 12 volumes (later reprinted), &quot;A History of Ireland in the Eighteenth Century&quot; is separated out.

A volume of &quot;Poems&quot; (1891) was less successful. In 1896, he published two volumes entitled &quot;Democracy and Liberty&quot;, in which he considered modern democracy. The pessimistic conclusions at which he arrived provoked criticism in both the United Kingdom and the United States of America, which was renewed when he published in a new edition (1899) his low estimate of William Ewart Gladstone, then recently dead.
In &quot;The Map of Life&quot; (1899) Lecky discussed in a popular style ethical problems of everyday life. In 1903, he published a revised and enlarged edition of &quot;Leaders of Public Opinion in Ireland&quot;, in two volumes, with the essay on Swift omitted and that on O&#x27;Connell expanded into a complete biography. A critic of the methods by which the Act of Union was passed, Lecky, who grew up as a moderate Liberal, was opposed to Gladstone&#x27;s policy of Home Rule, and in 1895, he was returned to parliament as a Liberal Unionist member for Dublin University in a by-election. In 1897, he was made a privy councillor. In the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, he was nominated an original member of the new Order of Merit (OM), and he was invested as such by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October 1902.

==Degrees==

His university honours included the degree of LL.D. from Dublin, St Andrews and Glasgow, the degree of D.C.L. from Oxford and the degree of Litt.D. from Cambridge. In 1894, he was elected corresponding member of the Institute of France. He contributed occasionally to periodical literature, and two of his addresses, &quot;The Political Value of History&quot; (1892) and &quot;The Empire, its Value and its Growth&quot; (1893), were published.

==Family and posthumous recognition==
After his father died when Lecky was 14, he was raised as a member of the family of the 8th Earl of Carnwath, his stepmother&#x27;s husband.

He was married in 1871 to Elizabeth van Dedem, a lady-in-waiting to Queen Sophie of the Netherlands and member of the aristocratic van Dedem family. The couple had no children. Elizabeth, herself a writer and historian, contributed articles, chiefly on historical and political subjects, to various reviews.

In 1904, money for a memorial was raised by subscription and a statue by Goscombe John was erected in Trinity College, Dublin.

A volume of Lecky&#x27;s &quot;Historical and Political Essays&quot; was published posthumously (London, 1908), edited and introduced by his wife.

The Lecky Chair of History at Trinity College Dublin, was endowed by his widow in 1913.

One of the constituent libraries of Trinity College Dublin is also named in his honour, along with that of the Berkeley and Ussher libraries.

In 1978, part of the college&#x27;s humanities library complex was named in his honour.

==Learned societies==
Lecky was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1891.

<text>Educational games are games explicitly designed with educational purposes, or which have incidental or secondary educational value. All types of games may be used in an educational environment, however educational games are games that are designed to help people learn about certain subjects, expand concepts, reinforce development, understand a historical event or culture, or assist them in learning a skill as they play. Game types include board, card, and video games.

As educators, governments, and parents realize the psychological need and benefits that gaming has on learning, this educational tool has become mainstream. Games are interactive play that teach goals, rules, adaptation, problem solving, interaction, all represented as a story. They satisfy a fundamental need to learn by providing enjoyment, passionate involvement, structure, motivation, ego gratification, adrenaline, creativity, social interaction and emotion in the game itself while the learning takes place.

== Video games ==
With the increase and availability of technological devices, there has been a shift in what types of games people play. Video or electronic gaming has become more widely used than traditional board games. Barab (2009) defines conceptual play as &quot;a state of engagement that involves (a) projection into the role of character who, (b) engaged in a partly fictional problem context, (c) must apply conceptual understandings to make sense of, and ultimately, transform the context&quot;. The goal of such play spaces is to have the &quot;gamer&quot; engage in the narrative while learning cognitive and social skills. The ability to immerse oneself in the gaming process facilitates &quot;empathetic embodiment&quot; which occurs when a player learns to identify with the character they have chosen for the game and the virtual environment of the game (Barab, 2009).

Educational video games have been divided into two major categories. &quot;Edutainment&quot; games are those that are typically based on drilling fundamental lessons in a linear progression, with added entertainment value. &quot;Educational video games&quot; are ones that encourage creative thinking and problem solving.

== Game-based learning ==
Game-based learning (GBL) is a type of game play that has defined learning outcomes. Generally, game-based learning is designed to balance subject matter with gameplay and the ability of the player to retain, and apply said subject matter to the real world. Children tend to spend hours playing hide and seek, learning the steps of digital games, such as chess, and engaging in creative games. Therefore, it can be said that play and learning are synonymous, leading to cognitive and emotional development inside a social and cultural context. For instance, the game of hide and seek: Good hiders need visual and spatial perspective to define the best hiding places, while seekers must be skilled at searching for cues from the surroundings and choosing the most probable location for the hider among various possible places. A systematic review investigated the effects of educational games for mental health students:
==Origins==
In his classical essay, &quot;Upon the Aesthetic Education of Man&quot;, Friedrich Schiller discusses play as a force of civilization, which helps humans rise above their instincts and become members of enlightened communities. He states that &quot;humans are only fully human when they play&quot;. While the text is limited by the author&#x27;s beliefs in concepts such as freedom and beauty, it nevertheless sets the stage for Johan Huizinga&#x27;s classical study, &quot;Homo Ludens&quot;.

Games have long been employed as a means of education. Using the ancient game of chess, noblemen of the Middle Ages learned strategies of war. During the Civil War, volunteers from Rhode Island played American Kriegsspiel, which had originally been created in 1812 for training Prussian officers-of-war. Then, in the early 19th century, came the creation of Kindergarten by Friedrich Fröbel, which was based on learning through play. Children delighted in his Fröbel Gifts, simple educational toys such as blocks, sewing kits, clay, and weaving materials.

===Theory===

According to Richard N. Van Eck, there are three main approaches to creating software that stimulates cognitive growth in the gamer. These three approaches are: building games from scratch created by educators and programmers; integrate commercial off-the-shelf (COTS); and creating games from scratch by the students. The most time- and cost-effective approach to designing these educational games is to incorporate COTS games into the classroom with the understanding of the learning outcomes the instructor has for the course. This requires the teacher to buy into the positive results of using digital games for education. It also requires teachers to have adequate self-efficacy concerning the use of these games and their technology. The students usually have high amounts of self-efficacy in usage of digital games, while the lack of confidence teachers have in incorporating the digital games usually results in less effective educational use of the games. However, Gerber and Price (2013) have found that teachers&#x27; inexperience with digital games does not preclude them from the desire to incorporate them in class instruction, but districts must have in place support through regular professional development, supportive learning communities with their colleagues, and adequate financial support to implement game-based learning in their class instruction.

Games often have a fantasy element that engages players in a learning activity through narrative or storylines. Educational video games can motivate children and allow them to develop an awareness of consequentiality. Children are allowed to express themselves as individuals while learning and engaging in social issues. Today&#x27;s games are more social, with most teens playing games with others at least some of the time and can incorporate many aspects of civic and political life. In classrooms, social game-based learning platforms are increasing in popularity, as they purport to enable students to reinforce knowledge and develop social and leadership skills.

The success of game-based learning strategies owes to active participation and interaction being at the center of the experience, and signals that current educational methods are not engaging students enough. Experience with and affinity for games as learning tools is an increasingly universal characteristic among those entering higher education and the workforce. Game-based learning is an expansive category, ranging from simple paper-and-pencil games like word searches all the way up to complex, massively multiplayer online (MMO) and role-playing games. The use of collaborative game-based role-play for learning provides an opportunity
for learners to apply acquired knowledge and to experiment and get feedback in the form of consequences or rewards, thus getting the experiences in the &quot;safe virtual world&quot;.

The built-in learning process of games is what makes a game enjoyable. The progress a player makes in a game is through learning. It is the process of the human mind grasping and coming to understand a new system. The progress of understanding a new concept through gaming makes an individual feel a sense of reward whether the game is considered entertainment (&quot;Call of Duty&quot;) or serious (FAA-approved flight simulator). Well-designed games that motivate players are what make them ideal learning environments. Real-world challenges are easier faced within a game containing effective, interactive experiences that actively engage people in the learning process. In a successful game-based learning environment, choosing actions, experiencing consequences, and working toward goals allows players to make mistakes through experimentation in a risk-free environment. Games have rules and structure and goals that inspire motivation. Games are interactive and provide outcomes and feedback. Most games also have problem solving situations that spark creativity.

Identification with the character within the video game is an important factor in the learning potential of the gamer. Some of the electronic games allow the gamer to create an avatar that is designed and “owned” by the gamer. This character is an expression of the human creating the virtual character. This has opened a new set of scientific possibilities. The virtual world can be used as a laboratory. The relationships and space within the games can simulate complex societies and relationships without having to truly participate. This application of an avatar in not limited to simulation exercises. According to Bainbridge, interviews and ethnographic research could be conducted within the reality of the game space. This could include experiments in social psychology and cognitive science. The fact that game creators and gamers are wanting new experiences within the games, the introduction of “experiments” could increase the level of play and engagement.

===Application===

Traditionally, technology used in school operates usually to solve problems in a fun way, particularly in mathematics. They usually make up case studies designed to introduce students to certain technologies in an effort to prepare them for a future major assignment that requires the aforementioned technology. They have also been developed to work in the virtual world. More recently educational egames have been developed for Higher Education students, combining real-world case studies in a virtual environment for students to have a consistent, 24/7 educational &#x27;virtual&#x27; experience. In some public schools implementing Common Core Standards, game-based learning programs are utilized by educators to supplement their teaching programs. According to a recent case study by an ed tech-based nonprofit organization, teachers find some digital learning games help address issues with alignment in Common Core.

In the future, technology and games are expected to be used in simulation environments to simulate real world issues. In the professional sector, such as flight training, simulations are already used in an effort to prepare pilots for training before actually going out into planes. These training sessions are used to replicate real life stresses without the risk factor associated with flying. Simulation-games are used in other professional areas as well; a spy-themed learning game has been used to improve sales skills at Avaya and a 3D simulation game has been used to train New York City emergency responders.

Before deciding how to use game-based learning, the trainer must first determine what they would like the trainees to learn. A trainer that fails to focus training around a central idea runs the risk of using a game that fails to connect with the learners. To prevent this, tailor the material to the demographic (age group, familiarity, educational pre-text) so that the material is neither too difficult for, nor too familiar to the learner. Gathering ideas from children early in the design process has yielded useful insights into what children want in technology in general or in a specific type of application. Children&#x27;s early involvement in requirements gathering has revealed clues about gender differences in preferences related to technology, children&#x27;s navigation skills, ways of presenting textual information, application-specific content-related preferences, the variety of elements to be included in user interfaces and their structures, and children&#x27;s desire to personalize their applications. Multiplayer role playing games (MMO&#x27;s) provide opportunities for players to improve such skills as, “complex learning, thinking, and social practices”. MMO&#x27;s also provide a social network which can favor collaborative gaming and learning and contribute to the formation of teams, communication within a group and help strengthen individual and communal identities.
