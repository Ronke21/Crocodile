<text>In mathematics, homotopy groups are used in algebraic topology to classify topological spaces. The first and simplest homotopy group is the fundamental group, denoted formula_1 which records information about loops in a space. Intuitively, homotopy groups record information about the basic shape, or &quot;holes&quot;, of a topological space.

To define the &quot;n&quot;-th homotopy group, the base-point-preserving maps from an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional sphere (with base point) into a given space (with base point) are collected into equivalence classes, called [[homotopy class]]es. Two mappings are homotopic if one can be continuously deformed into the other. These homotopy classes form a group, called the&quot;n&quot;-th homotopy group, formula_2 of the given space &quot;X&quot; with base point. Topological spaces with differing homotopy groups are never homeomorphic, but topological spaces that homeomorphic have the same homotopy groups.

The notion of homotopy of paths was introduced by Camille Jordan.

==Introduction==
In modern mathematics it is common to study a category by associating to every object of this category a simpler object that still retains sufficient information about the object of interest. Homotopy groups are such a way of associating groups to topological spaces.

That link between topology and groups lets mathematicians apply insights from group theory to topology. For example, if two topological objects have different homotopy groups, they cannot have the same topological structure—a fact that may be difficult to prove using only topological means. For example, the torus is different from the sphere: the torus has a &quot;hole&quot;; the sphere doesn&#x27;t. However, since continuity (the basic notion of topology) only deals with the local structure, it can be difficult to formally define the obvious global difference. The homotopy groups, however, carry information about the global structure.

As for the example: the first homotopy group of the torus formula_3 is
formula_4
because the universal cover of the torus is the Euclidean plane formula_5 mapping to the torus formula_6 Here the quotient is in the category of topological spaces, rather than groups or rings. On the other hand, the sphere formula_7 satisfies:
formula_8
because every loop can be contracted to a constant map (see homotopy groups of spheres for this and more complicated examples of homotopy groups). Hence the torus is not homeomorphic to the sphere.

== Definition ==
In the &quot;n&quot;-sphere formula_9 we choose a base point &quot;a&quot;. For a space &quot;X&quot; with base point &quot;b&quot;, we define formula_10 to be the set of homotopy classes of maps
formula_11
that map the base point &quot;a&quot; to the base point &quot;b&quot;. In particular, the equivalence classes are given by homotopies that are constant on the basepoint of the sphere. Equivalently, define formula_10 to be the group of homotopy classes of maps formula_13 from the &quot;n&quot;-cube to &quot;X&quot; that take the boundary of the &quot;n&quot;-cube to &quot;b&quot;.
For formula_14 the homotopy classes form a group. To define the group operation, recall that in the fundamental group, the product formula_15 of two loops formula_16 is defined by setting
formula_17

The idea of composition in the fundamental group is that of traveling the first path and the second in succession, or, equivalently, setting their two domains together. The concept of composition that we want for the &quot;n&quot;-th homotopy group is the same, except that now the domains that we stick together are cubes, and we must glue them along a face. We therefore define the sum of maps formula_18 by the formula
formula_19

For the corresponding definition in terms of spheres, define the sum formula_20 of maps formula_21 to be formula_22 composed with &quot;h&quot;, where formula_22 is the map from formula_9 to the wedge sum of two &quot;n&quot;-spheres that collapses the equator and &quot;h&quot; is the map from the wedge sum of two &quot;n&quot;-spheres to &quot;X&quot; that is defined to be &quot;f&quot; on the first sphere and &quot;g&quot; on the second.

If formula_25 then formula_26 is abelian. Further, similar to the fundamental group, for a path-connected space any two choices of basepoint give rise to isomorphic formula_27

It is tempting to try to simplify the definition of homotopy groups by omitting the base points, but this does not usually work for spaces that are not simply connected, even for path-connected spaces. The set of homotopy classes of maps from a sphere to a path connected space is not the homotopy group, but is essentially the set of orbits of the fundamental group on the homotopy group, and in general has no natural group structure.

A way out of these difficulties has been found by defining higher homotopy groupoids of filtered spaces and of &quot;n&quot;-cubes of spaces. These are related to relative homotopy groups and to &quot;n&quot;-adic homotopy groups respectively. A higher homotopy van Kampen theorem then enables one to derive some new information on homotopy groups and even on homotopy types. For more background and references, see &quot;Higher dimensional group theory&quot; and the references below.

== Homotopy groups and holes ==
A topological space has a &quot;hole&quot; with a &quot;d&quot;-dimensional boundary if-and-only-if it contains a &quot;d&quot;-dimensional sphere that cannot be shrunk continuously to a single point. This holds if-and-only-if there is a mapping formula_28 that is not homotopic to a constant function. This holds if-and-only-if the &quot;d&quot;-th homotopy group of &quot;X&quot; is not trivial. In short, X has a hole with a &quot;d&quot;-dimensional boundary, if-and-only-if formula_29.

==Long exact sequence of a fibration==
Let formula_30 be a basepoint-preserving Serre fibration with fiber formula_31 that is, a map possessing the homotopy lifting property with respect to CW complexes. Suppose that &quot;B&quot; is path-connected. Then there is a long exact sequence of homotopy groups
formula_32

Here the maps involving formula_33 are not group homomorphisms because the formula_33 are not groups, but they are exact in the sense that the image equals the kernel.

Example: the Hopf fibration. Let &quot;B&quot; equal formula_7 and &quot;E&quot; equal formula_36 Let &quot;p&quot; be the Hopf fibration, which has fiber formula_37 From the long exact sequence
formula_38

and the fact that formula_39 for formula_25 we find that formula_41 for formula_42 In particular, formula_43

In the case of a cover space, when the fiber is discrete, we have that formula_44 is isomorphic to formula_45 for formula_46 that formula_44 embeds injectively into formula_45 for all positive formula_49 and that the subgroup of formula_50 that corresponds to the embedding of formula_51 has cosets in bijection with the elements of the fiber.

When the fibration is the mapping fibre, or dually, the cofibration is the mapping cone, then the resulting exact (or dually, coexact) sequence is given by the Puppe sequence.

=== Homogeneous spaces and spheres ===
There are many realizations of spheres as homogeneous spaces, which provide good tools for computing homotopy groups of Lie groups, and the classification of principal bundles on spaces made out of spheres.

==== Special orthogonal group ====
There is a fibration

formula_52

giving the long exact sequence

formula_53

which computes the low order homotopy groups of formula_54 for formula_55 since formula_56 is formula_57-connected. In particular, there is a fibration

formula_58

whose lower homotopy groups can be computed explicitly. Since formula_59 and there is the fibration

formula_60

we have formula_61 for formula_62 Using this, and the fact that formula_63 which can be computed using the Postnikov system, we have the long exact sequence

formula_64

Since formula_65 we have formula_66 Also, the middle row gives formula_67 since the connecting map formula_68 is trivial. Also, we can know formula_69 has two-torsion.

===== Application to sphere bundles =====
Milnor used the fact formula_70 to classify 3-sphere bundles over formula_71 in particular, he was able to find exotic spheres which are smooth manifolds called Milnor&#x27;s spheres only homeomorphic to formula_72 not diffeomorphic. Note that any sphere bundle can be constructed from a formula_73-vector bundle, which have structure group formula_74 since formula_75 can have the structure of an oriented Riemannian manifold.

=== Complex projective space ===
There is a fibration

formula_76

where formula_77 is the unit sphere in formula_78 This sequence can be used to show the simple-connectedness of formula_79 for all formula_80

==Methods of calculation==
Calculation of homotopy groups is in general much more difficult than some of the other homotopy invariants learned in algebraic topology. Unlike the Seifert–van Kampen theorem for the fundamental group and the excision theorem for singular homology and cohomology, there is no simple known way to calculate the homotopy groups of a space by breaking it up into smaller spaces. However, methods developed in the 1980s involving a van Kampen type theorem for higher homotopy groupoids have allowed new calculations on homotopy types and so on homotopy groups. See for a sample result the 2010 paper by Ellis and Mikhailov.

For some spaces, such as tori, all higher homotopy groups (that is, second and higher homotopy groups) are trivial. These are the so-called aspherical spaces. However, despite intense research in calculating the homotopy groups of spheres, even in two dimensions a complete list is not known. To calculate even the fourth homotopy group of formula_7 one needs much more advanced techniques than the definitions might suggest. In particular the Serre spectral sequence was constructed for just this purpose.

Certain homotopy groups of &quot;n&quot;-connected spaces can be calculated by comparison with homology groups via the Hurewicz theorem.

==A list of methods for calculating homotopy groups==
* The long exact sequence of homotopy groups of a fibration.
* Hurewicz theorem, which has several versions.
* Blakers–Massey theorem, also known as excision for homotopy groups.
* Freudenthal suspension theorem, a corollary of excision for homotopy groups.

==Relative homotopy groups==

There is also a useful generalization of homotopy groups, formula_2 called relative homotopy groups formula_83 for a pair formula_84 where &quot;A&quot; is a subspace of formula_85

The construction is motivated by the observation that for an inclusion formula_86 there is an induced map on each homotopy group formula_87 which is not in general an injection. Indeed, elements of the kernel are known by considering a representative formula_88 and taking a based homotopy formula_89 to the constant map formula_90 or in other words formula_91 while the restriction to any other boundary component of formula_92 is trivial. Hence, we have the following construction:

The elements of such a group are homotopy classes of based maps formula_93 which carry the boundary formula_56 into &quot;A&quot;. Two maps formula_95 are called homotopic relative to &quot;A&quot; if they are homotopic by a basepoint-preserving homotopy formula_96 such that, for each &quot;p&quot; in formula_56 and &quot;t&quot; in formula_98 the element formula_99 is in &quot;A&quot;. Note that ordinary homotopy groups are recovered for the special case in which formula_100 is the singleton containing the base point.

These groups are abelian for formula_101 but for formula_102 form the top group of a crossed module with bottom group formula_103

There is also a long exact sequence of relative homotopy groups that can be obtained via the Puppe sequence:

:formula_104

==Related notions==
The homotopy groups are fundamental to homotopy theory, which in turn stimulated the development of model categories. It is possible to define abstract homotopy groups for simplicial sets.

Homology groups are similar to homotopy groups in that they can represent &quot;holes&quot; in a topological space. However, homotopy groups are often very complex and hard to compute. In contrast, homology groups are commutative (as are the higher homotopy groups). Hence, it is sometimes said that &quot;homology is a commutative alternative to homotopy&quot;. Given a topological space formula_105 its &quot;n&quot;-th homotopy group is usually denoted by formula_2 and its &quot;n&quot;-th homology group is usually denoted by formula_107

<text>The spotted redshank (Tringa erythropus) is a wader (shorebird) in the large bird family Scolopacidae. The genus name &quot;Tringa&quot; is the Neo-Latin name given to the green sandpiper by Aldrovandus in 1599 based on Ancient Greek &quot;trungas&quot;, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird mentioned by Aristotle. The specific &quot;erythropus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;eruthros&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, and &quot;pous&quot;, &quot;foot&quot;.

It breeds across northern Scandinavia and the northern Palearctic and migrates south to the Mediterranean, the southern British Isles, France, tropical Africa, and tropical Asia for the winter. It is an occasional vagrant to Australia and North America.

==Taxonomy==
The spotted redshank was described by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 and given the binomial name &quot;Scolopax erythropus&quot;.
It is a monotypic species, with no recognised subspecies. Taxonomically, it forms a close-knit group with several other large &quot;Tringa&quot; species, with molecular sequencing showing it to be a sister clade to that containing the greater yellowlegs and the common greenshank.

==Description==
This is a large wader (shorebird), measuring long, with a wingspan of and a weight ranging from . It is black in breeding plumage, and very pale in winter. It has a red legs and bill, and shows a white oval on the back in flight. Juveniles are grey-brown finely speckled white above, and have pale, finely barred underparts. 
Adults moult completely between July and October. In spring, the body plumage is moulted between March and May. Juveniles have a partial moult between August and February. 
The call is a creaking whistle &quot;teu-it&quot; (somewhat similar to the call of a roseate tern), the alarm call a &quot;kyip-kyip-kyip&quot;.

==Habitat and range==
The spotted redshank breeds in the Arctic across much of the Palearctic, from Lapland in the west to Chukotskaya in the east.

==Behaviour==

===Food and feeding===
Like most waders, it feeds on small invertebrates.

===Breeding===

It nests on open boggy taiga, laying four eggs in a ground scrape. For breeding the bird moults to a black to dark grey with white spots. During breeding plumage the legs also turn a dark grey. See image alongside.

==Conservation and threats==
The spotted redshank is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.

<text>The common greenshank (Tringa nebularia) is a wader in the large family Scolopacidae, the typical waders. The genus name &quot;Tringa&quot; is the Neo-Latin name given to the green sandpiper by Aldrovandus in 1599 based on Ancient Greek &quot;trungas&quot;, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird mentioned by Aristotle. The specific &quot;nebularia&quot; is from Latin &quot;nebula&quot; &quot;mist&quot;. Like the Norwegian &quot;Skoddefoll&quot;, this refers to the greenshank&#x27;s damp marshy habitat.

==Relatives==
Its closest relative is the greater yellowlegs, which together with the spotted redshank form a close-knit group. Among them, these three species show all the basic leg and foot colours found in the shanks, demonstrating that this character is paraphyletic. They are also the largest shanks apart from the willet, which is altogether more robustly built. The greater yellowlegs and the common greenshank share a coarse, dark, and fairly crisp breast pattern as well as much black on the shoulders and back in breeding plumage.

==Distribution==
This is a subarctic bird, breeding from northern Scotland eastwards across northern Europe and east across the Palearctic. It is a migratory species, wintering in Africa, the Indian subcontinent, and Australasia, usually on fresh water. It breeds on dry ground near marshy areas, laying about four eggs in a ground scrape.

==Description==
Common greenshanks are brown in breeding plumage, and grey-brown in winter. When in water, they can appear very similar to marsh sandpipers but are distinguished by the shape of the lower bill which gives it an upturned appearance to the bill. They have long greenish legs and a long bill with a grey base. They show a white wedge on the back in flight. They are somewhat larger than the related common redshank. The usual call is a rapid series of three short fluty notes syllabilized as &quot;teu-teu-teu&quot;.

Like most waders, they feed on small invertebrates, but will also take small fish and amphibians.

The common greenshank is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. In 2024, &quot;T. nebularia&quot; was listed as Endangered under the Australian EPBC Act.

<text>The Game Developers Choice Awards are awards annually presented at the Game Developers Conference for outstanding game developers and games.
Introduced in 2001, the Game Developers Choice Awards were preceded by the Spotlight Awards, which were presented from 1997 to 1999. Since then, the ceremony for the Independent Games Festival is held just prior to the Choice Awards ceremony.

==Winner selection process==
Nominations for games are made by International Choice Awards Network (ICAN), a group of leading game creators. Votes are then additionally made by editors of Game Developer. Any video game released in the preceding calendar year, regardless of medium, is eligible to be nominated, though upgrades, expansions, and mission packs are not eligible to be nominated.

The top nominated games are assembled into the list of nominees, typically presented in December, are then voted on by final voting body, made up of ICANs, and editors of Game Developer. In this final stage of voting, games with the highest votes in a category are the winners.

Winners for Special Awards (Lifetime Achievement, Pioneer, Ambassador) are decided by a &quot;Special Awards Jury&quot;, which appears to consist of a variety of 5 people. This group may consider recommendations from ICAN members.

The winners are announced during the Game Developers Conference, which is typically held in March of the calendar year.

GDC related properties are owned by the UBM technology group.

===Historical process===

In 2007, gamasutra.com took over management of the awards from the IGDA.
An advisory board selected by the editors of gamasutra.com and &quot;Game Developer&quot; magazine oversees the selection process.

In the past, nominations are accepted from registered gamasutra.com users, confirmed to be game developers, and from the advisory board.
Once the nomination process is complete, the advisory board identifies five finalists for each regular category.

The recipients of the Lifetime Achievement, Pioneer (formerly known as First Penguin) and Maverick awards are selected by the advisory board.
For the other awards, a vote open to all those who participated in the nomination process chooses a recipient from each category&#x27;s finalists.

==List of winners==
&quot;Note: Events held for awards are held early in the following year. Winners are listed first and highlighted in bold.&quot;

GDC had announced their intention to award Nolan Bushnell (co-founder of Atari) the 2018 Pioneer Award. However, after several people asked the GDC to reconsider this in light of documented sexist activities in Bushnell&#x27;s past in light of the current #MeToo movement, GDC opted to not award the Pioneer Award and instead &quot;will dedicate this year&#x27;s award to honor the pioneering and unheard voices of the past&quot;.

The massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) &quot;Ultima Online&quot; was inducted into the GDC Online Awards Hall of Fame for being &quot;a specific online game that has resulted in the long-term advancement of the medium, pioneering major shifts in online game development and games as a whole.&quot;

=== 2011 ===

The 2011 awards ceremony took place on October 12, 2011. All the awards from the previous year returned, and a new award for Online Innovation was introduced. &quot;Minecraft&quot; and &quot;Rift&quot; by Mojang and Trion Worlds respectively took home the most awards, with two each. Kelton Flinn and John Taylor received the special Online Game Legend award as founders of Kesmai and creators of &quot;Island of Kesmai&quot; and &quot;Air Warrior&quot;.

<text>Brad Rone (September 30, 1968 – July 18, 2003) was a journeyman boxer from Cincinnati, Ohio. Rone was not an accomplished boxer: He lost 26 professional bouts in a row before dying.

Rone died after a fight with Billy Zumbrun, a boxer who had beaten Rone before, and who had become friends with Rone after their first fight. Rone had been banned from fighting in Nevada for three years. Although he lived in Las Vegas, commissioner Marc Ratner, considered one of the most serious and respected figures in boxing, felt Rone was in risk of getting injured every time he boxed, so he denied the Ohio native a license in 2000. Rone then took to the road to find fights, going as far as Germany and Denmark.

Despite being banned from Nevada, he fought several times in California, as well as in Idaho and Texas. His fights with Zumbrun were in Utah. Usually, when a boxer is banned from fighting in one state of the United States, the suspension carries over to the other states, but in Rone&#x27;s case, he still managed to get fights on U.S. soil.

On July 17, Rone&#x27;s mother died of a heart attack. Seemingly out of money to fly to Ohio, Rone was offered a fight with Zumbrun in Utah the following day, for a fee of 800 dollars. He accepted, and drove to Utah for the fight.

Rone was hit by a Zumbrun jab just before the bell to end the first round. He turned around to walk to his corner when he collapsed, dying instantly. A ringside doctor tried to revive him using cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but his efforts were in vain. An autopsy later revealed Rone had died of a heart attack instead of as a consequence of the punch inflicted by Zumbrun.

Various theories have been formed after his death: Rone was a large, man who might have inherited a heart condition from his mother. He was distraught by her death and might have been under pressure and distress before the fight. Since he had a losing streak of 26 bouts in a row, the theory that he might have taken too much punishment inside a ring is also credible.

Former commissioner Ratner himself said that he would not have allowed Rone to fight. Moreover, Arizona senator John McCain expressed his feeling that Rone&#x27;s death showed that a unified national boxing commission was needed, one which would verify boxers&#x27; records and whether they are banned from one state or not. Rone&#x27;s opponent, Zumbrun, told friends that Rone lacked his usual strength.

<doc id="297519" wikidata="Q5459694" url="?curid=297519" title="Flipped SU(5)">
<text>The Flipped SU(5) model is a grand unified theory (GUT) first contemplated by Stephen Barr in 1982, and by Dimitri Nanopoulos and others in 1984. Ignatios Antoniadis, John Ellis, John Hagelin, and Dimitri Nanopoulos developed the supersymmetric flipped SU(5), derived from the deeper-level superstring.

In 2010, efforts to explain the theoretical underpinnings for observed neutrino masses were being developed in the context of supersymmetric flipped .

Flipped is not a fully unified model, because the factor of the Standard Model gauge group is within the factor of the GUT group. The addition of states below &quot;M&quot;x in this model, while solving certain threshold correction issues in string theory, makes the model merely descriptive, rather than predictive.

==The model==
The flipped model states that the gauge group is:

Fermions form three families, each consisting of the representations

: for the lepton doublet, L, and the up quarks ;
: for the quark doublet, Q, the down quark, and the right-handed neutrino, ;
: for the charged leptons, .

This assignment includes three right-handed neutrinos, which have never been observed, but are often postulated to explain the lightness of the observed neutrinos and neutrino oscillations. There is also a and/or called the Higgs fields which acquire a VEV, yielding the spontaneous symmetry breaking

The representations transform under this subgroup as the reducible representation as follows:

:formula_1 (uc and l)
:formula_2 (q, dc and νc)
:formula_3 (ec)
:formula_4.

==Comparison with the standard SU(5)==
The name &quot;flipped&quot; arose in comparison to the &quot;standard&quot; Georgi–Glashow model, in which and quark are respectively assigned to the and representation. In comparison with the standard , the flipped can accomplish the spontaneous symmetry breaking using Higgs fields of dimension 10, while the standard typically requires a 24-dimensional Higgs.

The sign convention for varies from article/book to article.

The hypercharge Y/2 is a linear combination (sum) of the following:

:formula_5

There are also the additional fields and containing the electroweak Higgs doublets.

Calling the representations for example, and is purely a physicist&#x27;s convention, not a mathematician&#x27;s convention, where representations are either labelled by Young tableaux or Dynkin diagrams with numbers on their vertices, and is a standard used by GUT
theorists.

Since the homotopy group

:formula_6

this model does not predict monopoles. See &#x27;t Hooft–Polyakov monopole.

==Minimal supersymmetric flipped SU(5)==

===Spacetime===
The superspace extension of Minkowski spacetime

===Spatial symmetry===
 SUSY over Minkowski spacetime with R-symmetry

===Gauge symmetry group===
===Global internal symmetry===

===Vector superfields===
Those associated with the gauge symmetry

===Chiral superfields===

===Superpotential===
A generic invariant renormalizable superpotential is a (complex) invariant cubic polynomial in the superfields which has an -charge of 2. It is a linear combination of the following terms:

formula_7

The second column expands each term in index notation (neglecting the proper normalization coefficient). and are the generation indices. The coupling has coefficients which are symmetric in and .

In those models without the optional sterile neutrinos, we add the nonrenormalizable couplings instead.

formula_8

These couplings do break the R-symmetry.

<text> is a program on Unix and Unix-like operating systems used to display the beginning of a text file or piped data.

==Syntax==
The command syntax is:

 head [options] 

By default, will print the first 10 lines of its input to the standard output. 

===Option flags===




==Other command==
Many early versions of Unix and Plan 9 did not have this command, and documentation and books used sed instead:

 sed 5q &quot;filename&quot;

The example prints every line (implicit) and quits after the fifth.

Equivalently, awk may be used to print the first five lines in a file:

 awk &#x27;NR &lt; 6&#x27; &quot;filename&quot;

However, neither sed nor awk were available in early versions of BSD, which were based on
Version 6 Unix, and included head.

==Implementations==
A codice_1 command is also part of ASCII&#x27;s &quot;MSX-DOS2 Tools&quot; for MSX-DOS version 2. The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system.

<doc id="297529" wikidata="Q1797448" url="?curid=297529" title="Connecticut College">
<text>Connecticut College (Conn) is a private liberal arts college in New London, Connecticut. Originally chartered as Thames College, it was founded in 1911 as the state&#x27;s only women&#x27;s college, a response to Wesleyan University having closed its doors to female students in 1909. The college became coeducational in 1969, adopting its current name. 

Conn is a four-year residential undergraduate institution with approximately 1,700 students. Students choose courses from 41 programs, including interdisciplinary pathways and centers, with a majority choosing to study abroad. The college is situated on a hill located adjacent to the Thames River. In 1982, Conn was inducted as a member of the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC), where its athletes compete as part of NCAA Division III.

==History==
Connecticut College was chartered in 1911 as Connecticut&#x27;s only women&#x27;s college, having been established as a direct response to Wesleyan University&#x27;s decision to stop admitting women. Elizabeth C. Wright and other Wesleyan alumnae convinced others to found this new college, espousing the increasing desire among women for higher education. To that end, the institution was founded as the Connecticut College for Women. Their initial endowment came from financial assistance from the city of New London and its residents, along with a number of wealthy benefactors. The college sits on a former dairy farm owned by Charles P. Alexander of Waterford. He died in 1904 and his wife Harriet (Jerome) Alexander died in 1911. Their son Frank sold a large part of the land to the trustees to found Connecticut College.

The &quot;Hartford Daily Times&quot; ran an article on October 12, 1935, marking the college&#x27;s 20th anniversary: &quot;On September 27, 1915, the college opened its doors to students. The entering class was made up of 99 freshmen students, candidates for degrees, and 52 special students, a total registration of 151. A fine faculty of 23 members had been engaged and a library of 6,000 volumes had been gathered together.&quot; The college became co-educational in 1969, as President Charles E. Shain claimed that there was evidence that women were becoming uninterested in attending women&#x27;s colleges. At that time, the school adopted its current name, Connecticut College.

In the spring of 2023, students, faculty, and staff began protesting against college president Katherine Bergeron, who had been president of the college for nearly a decade. The protests focused on allegations of bullying and actions related to diversity and equity, most notably a decision to hold a college fundraiser at the Everglades Club, a social club and venue that has longstanding accusations of discrimination against black and Jewish people. Students occupied the administrative building, Fanning Hall, for ten days, senior staff publicly resigned, and faculty voted no confidence in her. Students also organized a march around campus in support of Jewish and minority peers, with many students calling Bergeron racist and anti-Semitic. On March 24, 2023, after negotiation with faculty, the board of trustees, and ad-hoc student groups, Bergeron announced that she would resign at the end of the Spring 2023 semester, one year before her contract was to expire. On June 30, 2023, her last day in office, the board of trustees awarded her the title of President Emerita. 

On July 1, 2023, Leslie Wong began service as interim president of the college. Andrea Chapdelaine, then-president of Hood College, was selected by the search committee to be the College&#x27;s 12th president. Her term officially began on June 1, 2024.

==Campus==
The main campus has three residential areas. The North Campus contains the newest residential halls. The South Campus contains residence halls along the west side of Tempel Green, across from several academic buildings. The oldest dorms on campus are Plant House and Blackstone House, which were founded in 1914. The campus houses the Winslow Ames House.

Connecticut College&#x27;s two principal libraries are the Charles E. Shain Library and the Greer Music Library, which is located in the Cummings Arts Center. The Shain Library houses a collection of more than 500,000 books and periodicals and an extensive collection of electronic resources. It is also home to The Linda Lear Center for Special Collections and Archives, and to the Charles Chu Asian Art Reading Room. The Lear Center has more than fifty book, manuscript, and art collections including research archives devoted to Rachel Carson, Eugene O&#x27;Neill, and Beatrix Potter. The Charles Chu Asian Art Reading Room serves both as a quiet reading area and as the permanent exhibition space for the Chu-Griffis Art Collection.

The student center is &quot;The College Center at Crozier-Williams&quot; (often shortened to &quot;Cro&quot;), and is located in the middle of the campus. The student center houses the Connecticut College bookstore (which doubles as a small convenience store), the campus post office, the Oasis Snack Shop, and the campus bar, Humphrey&#x27;s (formerly The Cro Bar). There are also student services offices as well as faculty offices and performance spaces for the Dance department.The Charles E. Shain Library was originally dedicated in 1976 and is named after former College President Charles Shain. It was renovated, expanded, and re-dedicated in 2015. The renovation was honored by the American Institute of Architects with a 2015 New England Honor Award in the category of Preservation. In 2016, LibraryJournal named the library a New Landmark Libraries Winner.

Performance spaces on campus include: Palmer Auditorium, Tansill Theater, housed in Hillyer Hall; Myers Dance Studio, housed in Crozier-Williams College Center; Harkness Chapel; and Evans Music Hall, Fortune Recital Hall, and Oliva Hall, all located in Cummings Art Center.

Palmer Auditorium was home to the American Dance Festival from 1947 to 1977, featuring choreographers such as Martha Graham, José Limón, and Merce Cunningham in what was called &quot;the most important summertime event in modern dance.&quot;

The campus makes up part of the Connecticut College Arboretum. This arboretum and botanical garden is free and open to the public year-round.

Harkness Chapel was designed by architect James Gamble Rogers, exhibiting his colonial Georgian style, with twelve stained glass windows by G. Owen Bonawit. The building is used for denominational religious services, as well as for ceremonies, concerts and recitals, weddings, and other public functions.

The Lyman Allyn Art Museum is also located on campus, and while some classes are taught there, it is not part of the College itself. The museum&#x27;s website states that &quot;the permanent collection includes over 10,000 paintings, sculpture, drawings, prints, furniture, and decorative arts, with an emphasis on American art from the 18th through 20th centuries.&quot; The collection is housed in a neo-classical building designed by Charles A. Platt.

==Academics==

Connecticut College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education; it has been so continuously by NECHE or its predecessor since December 1932. The college&#x27;s academics are organized into thirty-one academic departments and seven interdisciplinary programs with forty-one traditional majors plus opportunities for self-designed courses of study. Starting with the class of 2020, students at Connecticut College participate in a new interdisciplinary general education curriculum called Connections.

Its most popular majors, by 2021 graduates, were: Psychology (44), Economics (36), Political Science &amp; Government (34), Biology/Biological Sciences (27), and Neuroscience (22).

Connecticut College has a history of undergraduate research work and students are encouraged to make conference presentations and publish their work under the guidance of a professor. The college had 182 full-time professors in 2017–18; 93% held a doctorate or equivalent. The student-faculty ratio is about 9 to 1.
===Admissions===
Admission to the college is considered &quot;more selective&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. The college received 9,397 applications for the Class of 2027 (entering fall 2023) of which 3,597 (38%) were accepted.

<doc id="297534" wikidata="Q1380238" url="?curid=297534" title="Hugh d'Avranches, Earl of Chester">
<text>Hugh d&#x27;Avranches ( 1047 – 27 July 1101), nicknamed &quot;le Gros&quot; (the Large) or &quot;Lupus&quot; (the Wolf), was from 1071 the second Norman Earl of Chester and one of the great magnates of early Norman England.

==Early life and career==
Hugh d&#x27;Avranches was born around 1047 as the son of Richard le Goz, Viscount of Avranches. His mother was traditionally said to have been Emma de Conteville, half-sister of William the Conqueror, but Lewis (2014) states that the identification was made &quot;on the basis of unsatisfactory evidence&quot; and that his mother is unknown. Keats-Rohan (1999), while accepting the poor quality of the evidence for the traditional account, has nonetheless argued in favour of some relationship existing between Hugh and William.

==Earl of Chester==
In 1071, Gerbod the Fleming, 1st Earl of Chester was taken prisoner at the Battle of Cassel in France and held in captivity. Taking advantage of the circumstances, the king declared his title vacant. Cheshire, with its strategic location on the Welsh Marches, held county palatine status and the king then granted these powers to Hugh along with the earldom. In that role he would appoint a number of hereditary barons, including his cousins Robert of Rhuddlan and Nigel of Cotentin.

He also received many of the local manors held by Edwin, the last Saxon earl of Mercia (died 1071).

After his father&#x27;s death, as late as 1082, Hugh succeeded his father as Viscount of Avranches, and inherited large estates, not just in the Avranchin but scattered throughout western Normandy. The earl regarded the Benedictine monk and theologian St Anselm to be his friend and, during his lifetime, founded the Benedictine Abbeys of Sainte-Marie-et-Saint-Sever, Saint-Sever-Calvados, Normandy and St. Werburgh in Chester as well as giving land endowments to Whitby Abbey, North Yorkshire. Hugh remained loyal to King William II during the rebellion of 1088. He later served Henry I as one of his principal councillors at the royal court.

==Wales==
Hugh spent much of his time fighting with his neighbours in Wales. Together with Robert of Rhuddlan, he subdued a good part of northern Wales. Initially, Robert held north-east Wales as a vassal of the tenant-in-chief. In 1081 Gruffudd ap Cynan, King of Gwynedd was captured through the treachery of one of his own men at a meeting near Corwen. Gruffudd was imprisoned by Earl Hugh in his castle at Chester, but it was Robert who took over his kingdom, holding it directly &quot;en liege&quot; from the king. When Robert was killed by a Welsh raiding party in 1093 Hugh took over these lands, becoming ruler of most of North Wales, but he lost Anglesey and much of the rest of Gwynedd in the Welsh revolt of 1094, led by Gruffudd ap Cynan, who had escaped from captivity.

==Norwegian invasion==
In the summer of 1098, Hugh joined forces with Hugh of Montgomery, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury, in an attempt to recover his losses in Gwynedd. Gruffudd ap Cynan had retreated to Anglesey, but then was forced to flee to Ireland when a fleet he had hired from the Danish settlement in Ireland changed sides. Things were altered by the arrival of a Norwegian fleet under the command of King Magnus III of Norway, also known as Magnus Barefoot, who attacked the Norman forces near the eastern end of the Menai Straits. Earl Hugh of Shrewsbury was killed by an arrow said to have been shot by Magnus himself. The Normans were obliged to evacuate Anglesey altogether leaving Gruffudd, who had returned from Ireland, to take possession the following year. Hugh apparently made an agreement with him and did not again try to recover these lands.

==Marriage, death and succession==
Hugh d&#x27;Avranches married Ermentrude of Claremont, daughter of Hugh I, Count of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis, by whom he had his son and heir, Richard d&#x27;Avranches, 2nd Earl of Chester, though he is known to have also had illegitimate children, including Robert, abbot of Bury St Edmunds, Otuer fitz Count and, less certainly, Geva, wife of Geoffrey Ridel.

Hugh fell ill and on 13 July 1101 became a monk at his religious foundation of St. Werburgh, dying there four days later on 17 July 1101. He was succeeded as Earl of Chester by his son Richard, who married Matilda of Blois, a granddaughter of William the Conqueror. Both Richard and Matilda died in the disastrous sinking of the &quot;White Ship&quot; in 1120, and the Earldom then passed to Hugh&#x27;s nephew Ranulph le Meschin, Earl of Chester, son of his sister Margaret by her husband Ranulf de Briquessart, Viscount of Bayeux.

Hugh would be remembered for his &quot;gluttony, prodigality and profligacy&quot;. His obesity gave rise to his nickname, &quot;le Gros&quot; (the Fat). He would also posthumously be called &quot;Lupus&quot; (Wolf) for his savage ferocity in the battle against the Welsh.

<text>Hattie Ophelia Wyatt Caraway (February 1, 1878 – December 21, 1950) was an American politician who was United States Senator from Arkansas from 1931 to 1945. She was the first woman elected to the Senate, the first woman to serve a full term as a United States senator, and the first woman to be reelected to the Senate. She was also the first woman to preside over the Senate. She won reelection to a full term in 1932 with the active support of fellow Senator Huey Long, of neighboring Louisiana.

==Early life==

Hattie Wyatt was born near rural Bakerville in Humphreys County in west-central Tennessee, the daughter of William Carroll Wyatt, a farmer and shopkeeper, and the former Lucy Mildred Burch. At the age of four, she moved with her family to Hustburg in Humphreys County. Despite her family&#x27;s relative poverty, she had always hoped to pursue higher education, which was made possible through the generosity of a wealthy aunt. After attending a one-room schoolhouse and Ebenezer Church in Hustburg, she transferred to Dickson (Tennessee) Normal College, wherein 1896 she received her Bachelor of Arts degree. She taught school for a time before in 1902 marrying Thaddeus Caraway, whom she had met in college. They had three sons: Paul, Forrest, and Robert; Paul and Forrest became generals in the United States Army. The couple settled in Jonesboro, Arkansas, where he established a legal practice while she cared for the children, tended the household and kitchen garden, and helped to oversee the family&#x27;s cotton farm.

The Caraways established a second home Riversdale at Riverdale Park, Maryland. Thaddeus was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1912, and he served in that office until 1921 when he became a U.S. senator. Although she took an interest in her husband&#x27;s political career, Hattie Caraway avoided the capital&#x27;s social and political life as well as the campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage. She recalled that &quot;after equal suffrage I just added voting to cooking and sewing and other household duties.&quot;

==U.S. Senator==
Thaddeus Caraway died in office in 1931. Following the precedent of appointing widows to temporarily take their husbands&#x27; places, Arkansas governor Harvey Parnell appointed Hattie Caraway to the vacant seat, and she was sworn into office on December 9.

===Elections===
====January 1932====
With the Democratic Party of Arkansas&#x27;s backing, she easily won a special election in January 1932 for the remaining months of the term, becoming the first woman elected to the Senate.

====1932====

In May 1932, Caraway surprised Arkansas politicians by announcing that she would run for a full term in the upcoming election, joining a field already crowded with prominent candidates who had assumed she would step aside. She told reporters, &quot;The time has passed when a woman should be placed in a position and kept there only while someone else is being groomed for the job.&quot; When she was invited by Vice President Charles Curtis to preside over the Senate she took advantage of the situation to announce that she would run for reelection. Populist former Governor and Senator Huey Long of neighboring Louisiana traveled to Arkansas on a seven-day campaign swing on her behalf. She was the first female senator to preside over the body as well as the first to chair a committee (Senate Committee on Enrolled Bills). Lacking any significant political backing, Caraway accepted the offer of help from Long, whose efforts to limit incomes of the wealthy and increase aid to the poor she had supported. Long was also motivated by sympathy for the widow and his ambition to extend his influence into the home state of his party rival, Senator Joseph Robinson, who had been Al Smith&#x27;s vice-presidential candidate in 1928. Bringing his colorful and flamboyant campaign style to Arkansas, Long stumped the state with Caraway for a week just before the Democratic primary. He helped her to amass nearly twice as many votes as her closest opponent.

Long effectively used a method to quiet crying babies at campaign stops in Arkansas to encourage voter interest:

Mrs. Caraway would never forget nor cease to laugh over the plans we made for caring for obstreperous infants in the audience so that their mothers might listen to the speeches without the crowds being disturbed. I remember when I saw her notice one of our campaigners take charge of the first baby. The child began fretting and then began to cry. One of the young men accompanying us immediately gave it a drink of water. The child quieted for a bit and resumed a whimper, whereupon the same campaign worker handed the baby an all-day sucker, which it immediately grasped and soon fell asleep. Mrs. Caraway did not understand that it was a matter of design until it had been repeated several times.

Caraway went on to win the general election in November, with the accompanying victory of Franklin D. Roosevelt as U.S. President.

====1938====

In 1938, Caraway entered a tough fight for reelection, challenged by Representative John Little McClellan, who argued that a man could more effectively promote the state&#x27;s interests using the slogan, &quot;Arkansas Needs Another Man in the Senate!&quot; With backing from government employees, women&#x27;s groups, and unions, Caraway won a narrow victory in the primary and took the general election with 89.4 percent of the vote over the Republican C. D. Atkinson of Fayetteville in Washington County. In doing so, she became not only the first woman to be elected to the Senate, but also the first to be reelected.

====1944====

In her bid for reelection in 1944, Caraway placed a poor fourth in the Democratic primary and lost to freshman U.S. Representative J. William Fulbright of Arkansas&#x27;s 3rd congressional district. He was the young, dynamic former president of the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville who had already gained a national reputation. To claim the seat, Fulbright defeated sitting Governor Homer Martin Adkins and then the Republican Victor Wade of Batesville. The lack of visibility with her constituents may have been the primary reason that Caraway lost the 1944 nomination.

===Tenure===
Caraway&#x27;s Senate committee assignments included Agriculture and Forestry, Commerce, and Enrolled Bills and Library, which she chaired. She sustained a special interest in relief for farmers, flood control, and veterans&#x27; benefits, all of direct concern to her constituents, and cast her votes for nearly every New Deal measure. In 1938, she joined fellow Southerners in a filibuster against an anti-lynching bill that year. Although she carefully prepared herself for Senate work, Caraway spoke infrequently and rarely made speeches on the floor but built a reputation as an honest and sincere senator. She was sometimes portrayed by patronizing reporters as &quot;Silent Hattie&quot; or &quot;the quiet grandmother who never said anything or did anything.&quot; She explained her reticence as unwillingness &quot;to take a minute away from the men. The poor dears love it so.&quot;

During her tenure in the Senate, three other women – Long&#x27;s widow, Rose McConnell Long, Dixie Bibb Graves, and Gladys Pyle – held brief tenures of two years or less in the Senate, but none of them overlapped, and so there were never more than two women in the body. She supported Roosevelt&#x27;s foreign policy, arguing for his Lend-Lease bill from her perspective as a mother with two sons in the United States Army. While encouraging women to contribute to the war effort, Caraway insisted that caring for the home and family was a woman&#x27;s primary task. Yet her consciousness of women&#x27;s disadvantages was evident as early as 1931, when, upon being assigned the same Senate desk that had been briefly occupied by the first widow ever appointed to take her husband&#x27;s place, she commented privately, &quot;I guess they wanted as few of them contaminated as possible.&quot; Moreover, in 1943, Caraway became the first woman legislator to cosponsor the Equal Rights Amendment. In early 1944, she was an early sponsor of the Servicemen&#x27;s Readjustment Act of 1944, popularly known as the G.I. Bill. However, by supporting the bill, she placed herself in opposition to powerful congressmen who condemned the bill for being socialist.

On her final day in the Senate, she received a rare standing ovation from her all-male colleagues. Roosevelt then appointed her to the Employees&#x27; Compensation Commission, and in 1946, President Harry S. Truman gave her a post on the Employees&#x27; Compensation Appeals Board, on which she served until suffering a stroke in January 1950. She died on December 21 of the same year in Falls Church, Virginia, and was buried in Oaklawn Cemetery in Jonesboro, Arkansas.

==Legacy==
Caraway was a prohibitionist and voted against anti-lynching legislation along with other Southern Democratic senators. She was generally a supporter of the New Deal. Caraway&#x27;s defiance of the Arkansas establishment in insisting that she was more than a temporary stand-in for her husband enabled her to set a valuable precedent for women in politics. Although she remained at the margins of power, Caraway&#x27;s diligent and capable attention to Senate responsibilities won the respect of her colleagues, encouraged advocates of wider public roles for women, and demonstrated that political skills were not the exclusive property of men.

On February 21, 2001, the United States Postal Service issued a 76-cent Distinguished Americans series postage stamp in her honor. Her gravesite at Oaklawn Cemetery in Jonesboro, Arkansas, was listed in 2007 on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="297540" wikidata="Q473748" url="?curid=297540" title="Buganda">
<text>Buganda is a Bantu kingdom within Uganda. The kingdom of the Baganda people, Buganda is the largest of the traditional kingdoms in present-day East Africa, consisting of Uganda&#x27;s Central Region, including the Ugandan capital Kampala. The 14 million &quot;Baganda&quot; (singular &quot;Muganda&quot;; often referred to simply by the root word and adjective, Ganda) make up the largest Ugandan region, representing approximately 16% of Uganda&#x27;s population.

Buganda&#x27;s history includes unification during the 13th century by the first king Kato Kintu, the founder of Buganda&#x27;s Kintu Dynasty, Buganda grew to become one of the largest and most powerful states in East Africa during the 18th and 19th centuries. During the Scramble for Africa, and following unsuccessful attempts to retain its independence against British imperialism, Buganda became the center of the Uganda Protectorate in 1884; the name Uganda, the Swahili term for Buganda, was adopted by British officials. Under British rule, many Baganda acquired status as colonial administrators, and Buganda became a major producer of cotton and coffee.

In 1967, Uganda&#x27;s first Prime Minister Milton Obote declared Uganda a republic, abolished all monarchs, parliament became the constituent assembly and later all political parties were outlawed, except UPC.

Following years of political turmoil, the kingdom that largely occupies a ceremonial role was officially restored in 1993 by Uganda&#x27;s ruling National Resistance Movement under Yoweri Museveni, the President of Uganda since 1986.

Since the restoration of the kingdom in 1993, the King of Buganda, known as the Kabaka, has been Muwenda Mutebi II. He is recognized as the 36th Kabaka of Buganda. The current queen, known as the Nnabagereka or Kaddulubale is Queen Sylvia Nagginda.

==Geography and environment==


Ganda villages, sometimes as large as forty to fifty homes, were generally located on hillsides, leaving hilltops and swampy lowlands uninhabited, to be used for crops or pastures. Early Ganda villages surrounded the home of a chief or headman, which provided a common meeting ground for members of the village. The chief collected tribute from his subjects, provided tribute to the Kabaka, who was the ruler of the kingdom, distributed resources among his subjects, maintained order, and reinforced social solidarity through his decision-making skills. During the late 19th century, Ganda villages became more dispersed as the role of the chiefs diminished in response to political turmoil, population migration, and occasional popular revolts.

Buganda&#x27;s boundaries are marked by the Tanzanian border in Lake Victoria (Lake Nalubaale) to the south, the River Nile (River Kiira) to the east, Lake Kyoga to the north, Ankole to the west and River Kafu to the northwest.

===Districts===
Buganda currently is divided into 26 districts as of 2021. These are:


==History==
===Origin===
Ganda oral history reveals that Buganda was distinct and of at least equal antiquity to that of its historical rival, Kitara. It is indeed very likely that the Buganda state is much more ancient than has previously been thought. Buganda began as a small kingdom in the north of Lake Victoria in what is now Busiro County.
Ganda oral history has no mention of the Chwezi and according to the historian Christopher Wrigley, &quot;It is unlikely that Buganda was fully integrated into the system that was probably not called Kitara. Its language is distinct from &#x27;Rutara&#x27;, and the directors of the Ntusi and Biggo systems would not have had much interest in a land that was not really suited to cattle-rearing&quot;.

Some traditions from Buganda&#x27;s historical enemy Bunyoro claim (likely propaganda in order to increase the prestige of their own state) that their &quot;first Bito king allotted Buganda to his son&quot; or supposed twin brother. The kings of Buganda do not claim to be Bito and the Ganda do not use the Luo Empaako names. The culture (such as kinship systems) of the Ganda and Nyoro are significantly different to one another with the Luganda and Runyoro languages not even being mutually intelligble. The Baganda regarded the Banyoro as &quot;inferior foreigners&quot;.
===Precolonial times===
Before the arrival of Europeans in the region, Buganda was an expanding, &quot;embryonic empire&quot;. It built fleets of war canoes from the 1840s to take control of Lake Victoria and the surrounding regions and subjugated several weaker peoples. These subject peoples were then exploited for cheap labor. The first Europeans to enter the Kingdom of Buganda were British explorers John Hanning Speke and Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton while searching for the headwaters of the Nile in 1862. They found a highly organized political system.

Historically, The Banyoro of Bunyoro-Kitara were the Baganda&#x27;s most hated and despised enemies. They were so hated that the word &quot;Nyoro&quot; became a synonym for &quot;foreigner&quot; and was used to refer to all other tribes whether they were truly ethnic Nyoro or not.

===Colonial times===

Buganda was colonized by the British and made a protectorate of the United Kingdom in 1884. The move towards independence reached a climax when the Lukiiko, the parliament of Buganda appointed theh Buganda Constitutional Committee in 1959 and later declared independence on 8 October 1960 and requested that the British protectorate be terminated.

While in exile, Mwanga II was received into the Anglican Church and was baptized with the name of Danieri (Daniel). He spent the rest of his life in exile. He died in 1903, at 35 years of age. On 2 August 1910, his remains were repatriated and buried at Kasubi.

On 24 July 1993, the monarchy of Buganda was restored when Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II was crowned king. Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II was the son of King &#x27;Freddy&#x27;, who had been deposed by the Ugandan government in 1966.

===Attempted secession in Kayunga===
In September 2009, some members of the minority Banyala ethnic group, led by the recently retired UPDF Captain Isabanyala Baker Kimeze, announced that Bugerere had seceded from the Kingdom of Buganda. The Banyala make up 0.09% of the population of Uganda and 13% of the population of the district, Kayunga, which they claimed to be leading into secession. Because of the resulting tensions, the government of Uganda prevented the Kabaka of Buganda from traveling to Bugerere, leading to riots in the capital, Kampala and its neighboring districts. Thirty people were killed in what came to be known as the Buganda riots.

===Previous kings===
On July 31, 2023, Buganda unveiled portraits of its former kings (bassekabaka) based on oral narrations and written histories dating back to the founding of the kingdom.

==Government==
Buganda is a constitutional monarchy. The current Head of State is the Kabaka, Muwenda Mutebi II who has reigned since the restoration of the kingdom in 1993. The Head of Government is the Katikkiro (Prime Minister) Charles Mayiga, who was appointed by the Kabaka in 2013. The Parliament of Buganda is the Lukiiko.

Prior to the Buganda Agreement of 1900, Buganda was an almost absolute monarchy. Under the Kabaka, there were three types of chief: &#x27; (administrative) chiefs, who were appointed directly by the Kabaka; traditional &#x27; chieftains; and &quot;&quot; chiefs, who served as representatives of the Kabaka, charged with &quot;maintaining internal security, supervising royal estates and military duties&quot;. The 1900 agreement, however, greatly enhanced the power of the Lukiiko (which had previously been simply an advisory council) at the expense of the Kabaka. While Buganda retained self-government, as one part of the larger Uganda Protectorate, it would henceforth be subject to formal British overrule. The Buganda Agreement of 1955 continued the transition from absolute to constitutional monarchy.

During Uganda independence, the constitutional position of Buganda (and the degree to which it would be able to exercise self-government) was a major issue. Discussions as part of the Uganda Relationships Commission resulted in the Buganda Agreement of 1961 and the first Constitution of Uganda (1962), as part of which Buganda would be able to exercise a high degree of autonomy. This position was reversed during 1966–67, however, before the Kabakaship and Lukiiko were disestablished altogether in 1967 before being restored in 1993.

===Amasaza===
Buganda is made up of 18 political divisions called amasaza in Luganda. These are:


==Infrastructure==
The explorer and journalist Henry Morton Stanley visited Buganda in 1875. At Buganda&#x27;s capital, Lubaga, Stanley found a well-ordered town surrounding the king&#x27;s palace, which was situated atop a commanding hill. A tall cane fence surrounded the palace compound, which was filled with grass-roofed houses, meeting halls, and storage buildings. Thronging the grounds were foreign ambassadors seeking audiences, chiefs going to the royal advisory council, messengers running errands, and a corps of young pages. He estimated the population of the kingdom at 2,000,000

===Communication===
As a rule, Ganda roads were remarkably straight, cutting over the crests of hills and through valleys, forests, swamps and rivers. Early visitors to Buganda describe the well-planned and carefully maintained system of roads, which radiated from the capital to all corners of the kingdom. The importance of these rapid means of communication in what the anthropologist Audrey Richards has called a &quot;pedestrian state&quot;, especially one whose terrain is covered with dense vegetation and contains innumerable papyrus swamps and streams, is evident. They enabled the king and his officials at the capital to maintain close political contact even with outlying parts of the kingdom, all of which could easily be reached by a runner within a day or two. Buganda&#x27;s excellent means of communication enabled the Kabaka &quot;to maintain active control over a territory one quarter the size of England without written communication and with no means of travel on land beyond the human foot&quot; 

When John Hanning Speke visited Buganda in 1862, he described the kingdom&#x27;s roads as being &quot;as long as our coach-roads, cut through the long grasses, straight over the hills and down through the woods in the dells—a strange contrast to the wretched tracks in all the adjacent countries.&quot;

Water transport was very important for Buganda and greatly helped in the kingdom&#x27;s expansion via its fleet of war canoes. Water transport also provided a means of political communication between the capital, which was usually sited fairly close to the lake, and outlying areas of the Kingdom along the lake shore, as well as the islands. The island chiefs had to maintain a great fleet of canoes ready for state service. The Mamba clan specialized in water transport and provided the kingdom&#x27;s overall “chief of canoes.”

Messages were sent by &quot;runners of athletic renown&quot;. These messengers were called bakayungirizi and were trained from an early age in prolonged, rapid marches, moving night and day with only short breaks; king Mutesa had many in his service.

The use of talking drums to spread messages was widespread in Buganda.

==Military==
Ganda elders say that &quot;in the old days, the work of men was war&quot;. Historians described Buganda as a &quot;war machine/warefare state&quot;, with warfare being the main activity which dominated the lives of most Ganda males. Armies were regularly sent out during each dry season in all directions against all foreign tribes, returning with much plunder (livestock, slaves, women etc.). The Baganda army consisted of district levies and each was headed by a royal-appointed chief or governor and remained the basic unit of military organization. All districts were expected to provide soldiers when called by the king. An army usually carried at least a month&#x27;s supply of food, though it generally lived off the countryside.

Kabaka Kamanya&#x27;s reign in the early nineteenth century was known as one of “restless warfare”. His successor Suna, carried on sixteen major military expeditions in a twenty-six- year reign. Under the Reign of Kabaka Suna II, Buganda&#x27;s borders were strengthened through the perfection of an army organization which was able to field 50,000 warriors. The Katikiro (prime minister) Apollo Kaggwa speaks of wars being waged regularly every six months.

The reign of Mutesa I was the zenith of Ganda military power. Under Mutesa, there were sixty-six wars in twenty-eight years. Mutesa led an army of 125,000 warriors supported by 230 war canoes during his campaign against tbe Sesse Islanders 

In the 1890s, raiding parties of up to 20,000 Baganda were mobilized to plunder the rival kingdom of Bunyoro.
Baganda war canoes could carry 60 to 100 warriors (not including the crew of 50 to 100) and could be as long as over 72 feet. These vessels were organized into a squadron under a leader. When engaged in battle, the paddlers squatted on the sides of the canoes while the warriors stood upright holding spears and shields.

In the year 1800, a military campaign involving canoes was undertaken by the Kabaka Kamanya against the Luo speaking Lango people north of Buganda. This war was noted for its ferocity. The geography of the Lango territory was daunting to the Ganda, the land being intersected by broad rivers and the eastern arms of Lake Kyoga. King Kamanya became extremely fustrated with his inability to overcome the Lango and so a grand council was held to discuss tactics. They decided to send 100 canoes to Jinja, where they would be disassembled and carried overland through Busoga to the Nagombwa river, where they would be reassembled and proceed to attack the Lango in their rear. At the same time, Kabaka Kamanya himself led another army along the western side of the Nile towards Urondogani, and attack the Lango from that side. The ensuing battle was eventually, if not easily, won.

In 1878, Mutesa sent a fleet to Ukerewe Island, where it helped the local ruler, Lukonge, put down a rebellion. The next year, the Baganda mounted successful slave raids against Busoga and the Buvuma Islands.

==Demographics==
Buganda had a projected population of about 11,952,600 people in 2021.

===Clans of Buganda===
As of 2009, there were at least 52 recognized clans within the kingdom, with at least another four making a claim to clan status. Within this group of clans, there are four distinct sub-groups, which reflect historical waves of immigration to Buganda.

====Nansangwa====
The oldest clans trace their lineage to Bakiranze Kivebulaya, who is supposed to have ruled in the region from about 400 AD until about 1300 AD. These seven clans are referred to as the Nansangwa, or the indigenous:

# Lugave (Pangolin)
# Mmamba (Lungfish)
# Ngeye (Colobus monkey)
# Njaza (Reedbuck)
# Ennyange (Cattle egret)
# Fumbe (Civet cat)
# Ngonge (Otter)
# Mpindi (Cowpea)
# Ngabi Ennyunga (Bushbuck)
# Njovu (Elephant)
# Mpologoma (Lion)

====Kintu migration====
The Abalasangeye dynasty came to power through the conquests of Kabaka of Buganda ssekabaka Kintu, which are estimated to have occurred sometime between 1200 and 1400 AD.

Thirteen clans that are believed to have come with Kintu:

# Ekkobe (Liana fruit)
# Mbwa (Dog)
# Mpeewo (Oribi antelope)
# Mpologoma (Lion)
# Namuŋoona (Pied crow)
# Ngo (Leopard)
# Ŋonge (Otter)
# Nte (cow)
# Nkejje (Cichlids)
# Nkima (Vervet monkey)
# Ntalaganya (Blue duiker)
# Nvubu (Hippopotamus)
# Nvuma (Pearl)

The descendants of the Basimba people (also known as Bashimba) which is a Bisa and Ambo nickname of the Clan of the leopards, the bena Ngo in Zambia, who settled at Mpogo, Sironko District, are among the Ngo Clan group that come along with Kabaka Kato Kintu in his immigration.

====Kato Kimera migration====
Around 1370 AD another wave of immigration began, assisted by Kabaka Kimera, who was the son of Omulangira Kalemeera. Kabaka Kimera was born in Kibulala, and returned to Buganda with Jjumba of the Nkima clan and other Buganda elders.

These eleven clans are:
# Bugeme
# Butiko (Mushrooms)
# Kasimba (Genet)
# Kayozi (Jerboa)
# Kibe (Fox)
# Mbogo (Buffalo)
# Musu/Omusu (Edible rat)
# Ngabi Ensamba(Antelope)
# Nkerebwe (Jungle Shrew)
# Nsuma (snout fish)
# Nseenene (Copiphorini)

===Major cities and towns===
The largest city in Buganda is Kampala. Others include Masaka City, Entebbe, Nansana, Kira, Makindye-Ssabagabo, Njeru and Mukono.

===Education===
Education in Buganda is divided between primary, secondary and higher education.

===Ethnic groups===
The majority of people in Buganda are Baganda. Other ethnic groups include the Basoga, Banyankole, Bagisu, Bateeso, Bayindi.

===Religion===
There are several religions practiced in Buganda. The largest are Catholicism, Anglicanism, Islam, and the traditional Kiganda religion. Some people practice both traditional religions as well as Christianity or Islam.

==Economy==

===Agriculture===
The traditional Ganda economy relied on crop cultivation. In contrast with many other East African economic systems, cattle played only a minor role. Many Baganda hired laborers from outside Buganda to herd the Baganda&#x27;s cattle, for those who owned livestock. Bananas were the most important staple food, providing the economic base for the region&#x27;s dense population growth. This crop does not require shifting cultivation or bush fallowing to maintain soil fertility, and as a result, Ganda villages were quite permanent. Women did most of the agricultural work, while men often engaged in commerce and politics (and in precolonial times, warfare). Before the introduction of woven cloth, traditional clothing was manufactured from the bark of trees.

===Crafts===
The royal craftsmen were a protected minority that were gifted land and were exempt from paying taxes or labour duties. The blacksmiths especially were extremely skilled and their work was highly specialized and sought after. Margaret Trowell describes further:

Leather working and tanning was an important industry and employed significant numbers of subjects. An account from 1874 describes the tanning of leather by the bakopi (commoners) who made large sheets of leather that were &quot;beautifully tanned and sewed together&quot;. A resident missionary in 1879 reported purchasing dyed leather skins cut in the shape of a hat. Cowhides were fashioned into sandals worn by the elite and priests since before the 18th century, with buffalo hides specifically worn by chiefs and the elite.

As early as the 1860s, professional smiths attached to the court were making ammunition for imported firearms, and by 1892, Federick Lugard observed that the Ganda smiths: &quot;will construct you a new stock to a rifle which you will hardly detect from that made by a London gun-maker. The Fundi Kisule, who learnt his art from Mackay, is an accomplished blacksmith and gunsmith, and will make a new spring or repair any damaged rifle with admirable workmanship. Their folding stools of rod iron, and their beautifully-tumed-out spears, attest their ability as blacksmiths.&quot;

===Slavery===
It was said that the average Muganda owned one hundred slaves; even youths possessed &quot;ten or twenty...whom they steal or kidnap in war&quot;. This was an exaggeration that conveyed some idea of the impression foreigners had of Ganda slavery and its extensive nature.
The vast majority of slaves in Buganda were from foreign ethnic groups such as the Banyoro, Basoga, and Banyankole. The Ganda sold other Ganda only in extremely exceptional circumstances and various Kabakas such as Suna banned the sale of any native Ganda to foreigners. Only cows, goats and ivory could be sold.

Ganda slave raiders invaded Bunyoro-Kitara throughout the 19th century and local missionaries would report vast numbers of slaves captured from Buganda&#x27;s enemy kingdom. The explorer John Hanning Speke witnessed the Ganda army returning from Bunyoro with &quot;immense numbers of cows, women and children, but not men, for they were killed&quot;.

The Hima (a pastoralist group) were especially sought out as slaves in raids into the foreign western kingdoms such as Ankole and Busongora. Hima women were considered highly attractive by the Ganda and were popular as wives. Many Hima women were put in the harems of chiefs and the Kabaka. Many cattle in Buganda were herded by enslaved Bahima herdsmen taken prisoners in war.

There was also a high demand for slaves from east of the Nile. Historian David William Cohen says that &quot;Ganda men relished the supposed attributes of women from Busoga, finding their elegantly cicatriced bodies beautiful and their separation from the tense, competitive arenas of Ganda politics a great virtue&quot;. In order to appease the Baganda, the basoga would send tribute to Buganda which included slave women. Baganda and Basoga alike participated in the kidnapping and transport of slaves. After the year 1850 no place in Busoga was hallowed sanctuary due to the scourge of kidnappings. It is estimated that Buganda had a sex ratio of 3.5:1 due to the vast numbers of foreign female slaves taken into the kingdom.

In the 1860s, kingdoms in Tanzania such as Unyanyembe and Urambo regarded slaves they purchased from Buganda as being the best available, especially the Hima women, (who were also brought from Karagwe). The export of slaves increased steadily through the 1860s and 1870s, reaching a peak in the 1880s, when as much as several thousand may have been exported annually.

==Culture and society==
===Women and royal power===
Pre-colonial Buganda was a strongly hierarchical and patriarchal kingdom. However, of the three people who could be called &quot;Kabaka&quot; or king, two were women: the queen mother (Namasole) and the queen sister (Lubuga). The queen mother was the most important woman in the kingdom and had political and ritual powers that resembled the king. The Namasole possessed her own courts and estates and had the power to collect taxes. The death of the Kabaka&#x27;s mother could instigate a time of terror, as the Kabaka would have his executioners catch and kill many people in his grief.

The Lubuga effectively shared the throne with her brother and had the same powers he had, for example, she controlled land throughout the country with estates in each district, and she had her own courts and her own chiefs with the same titles as those of the king&#x27;s chiefs. For their own subjects, the Namasole and Lubuga were the final decision makers and arbiters. The Lubuga&#x27;s palace was about twice the size of that of an important wife of the king. The others had more elaborate palaces.
 After the death of a king, the lùbugà took the title nnaalinnya (I will soon ascend) and became responsible for protecting the shrines in which the deceased king&#x27;s jawbone and umbilical cord were kept. This shrine was where the òmuzimù (spirit) of the king resided and so &quot;the lùbugà/nnaalinnya held significant creative power even after leaving office.&quot;

The senior wives of the king would also warrant special respect and had status and privilege within Ganda society. She was considered superior to all other chiefs and technically the most powerful commoner, being a royal by marriage. The Katikkiro (prime minister) and most chiefs in Buganda were under the control of the elite titled wives of the king The titled wives were privy to state secrets and were heavily involved in court politics and in vying for power through their sons and clans. Since succession was decided by the king&#x27;s mothers clan, in order to consolidate clan support, the sons of the king adopted the totems of their mothers and not of their fathers.

Women would also participate in military campaigns. Princess Nakuyita was second in command of Kabaka Sunna II&#x27;s army in the early 1800s.

The Àbàmbejja (Princesses) had many privileges, including the right to own land. They were shown great respect by chiefs and were exempted from many restrictions faced by the commoner women. Under Mutesa I, princesses were given to chiefs to consolidate their patron-client relations. Many princesses became spirit wives by ‘marrying’ the Balùbaalè (national deities) and were thus able to mobilise creative power to influence the king and the queen mother. One princess, the favorite wife of the king, and another titled woman in Mukaabya Mutesa&#x27;s court were instrumental in deposing the Katikkiro (prime minister), Kayira, because they felt he had claimed too much power. Princess Ndege Nassolo organized a successful rebellion of chiefs and princes against her brother, the cruel king Kagulu (1674–1704). Kagulu managed to escape capture after his capital fell but was later caught. Ndege Nassolo had Kagulu drowned in Lake Victoria.

In the 13-15th centuries, women are said to have ruled as Kabaka; Sir John Gray claims that there is abundant evidence of this. One such ruler was Naku, the daughter of Mukibi, the founder of the Lugave (Pangolin) clan and the wife of Kabaka Kimera. Naku was so powerful that every king that followed Kimera took a wife from her clan and called her Naku. Ganda history remembers another female Kabaka, Queen Nanono, wife of Kabaka Nakibinge (1494–1524), gained her fame from a battle with the Banyoro at Mpigi (which the Baganda lost) while pregnant. After finding out the king had died in battle, she rallied the Baganda warriors and prevented further losses. Thereafter she ruled the country for eighteen months and would have been chosen kabaka had she birthed a male child. Queen Nanano belonged to the Ngo (Leopard) clan, which brought prestige to her clan-mates, who initiated a new name for their daughters: Nnabulya (we also ruled).

===Cinema===
Several actors and actresses have been very influential in Kiganda drama including Sam Bagenda of the Ebonies, Mariam Ndagire, Aloysius Matovu, Abby Mukiibi, Charles Ssenkubuge, Alex Mukulu, Kato Lubwama, Benon Kibuuka, Nana Kagga, Sarah Kisawuzi, Ashraf Ssemwogerere, Ahmed Lubowa and Hellen Lukoma.

===Cuisine===
Kiganda cuisine is dominated by matooke, a banana cultivar. The matooke is sometimes prepared as part of Katogo.
The main dishes are almost always served with stew, soup or sauce.

===Fashion===
Historically, barkcloth was the textile of choice mainly worn by the royals from the days of Ssekabaka Kimera and later everyone else starting with the reign of Ssekabaka Semakookiro. Barkcloth is no longer as popular as it once was and has been replaced with cotton and silk. However, some fashion designers like Jose Hendo, still use it today. Barkcloth is also worn as a symbol of protest, mourning, or both. The traditional dress is the Kanzu for men and the Gomesi for women. However, Western-style fashion is very popular these days.

Some of the more common hairstyles are Bantu knots (especially Bitutwa), cornrows, Pencil braids (Biswahili), Braids, Crotchets, Weaves and Afros.

Some accessories may include necklaces, anklets, earrings, bracelets and waist beads ( or obutiti and they are always worn under ones clothes i.e. undergarments).

===Language and literature===
The Luganda language is widely spoken in Uganda and is the most popular language in Uganda along with English. Luganda is also widely spoken in and around other countries in East Africa, such as Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda. It is even used in South Sudan, mostly for business transactions. Luganda is the most spoken local language in Uganda. Despite all efforts made by different governments to promote Kiswahili over the language, it has survived and is still growing.

In literature and common discourse, Buganda is often referred to as Central Uganda.

Buganda has several famous writers like Michael Nsimbi, Solomon E. K. Mpalanyi, Edward Namutete Kawere, Ulysses Chuka Kibuuka, and Apollo Kaggwa.
===Music===
The ancient court music composers of Buganda discovered how human auditory perception processes a complex sequence of rapid, irregular sound impulses by splitting the total image into perceptible units at different pitch levels. They had made use of their discovery in composition, creating indirectly polyphonies of interweaving melodic lines that would suggest words to a Luganda speaker, as if some spirit were talking to the performers of a xylopnone or to the lone player of a harp (ennanga). The combination of the first two Xylophone parts creates &#x27;illusory&#x27; melodic patterns that exist only in the observers mind, not actually played by either of the first two musicians directly. That these &#x27;resultant&#x27; or &#x27;inherent&#x27; patterns are materialised only in the minds of listeners is a remarkable feature of Bugandan music. It is probably the oldest example of an audio-psychological effect known as auditory streaming (first recognized in western literature as the melodic fission effect) to delliberately occur in music. The music would be produced by regular movement, with the fingers or sticks combining two interlocking tone-rows, but the patterns heard would be irregular, often asymmetric and complex. All the 102 xylophone compositions that were transcribed by Gerhard Kubik In Buganda during the early 1960s reveal an extremely complex structure, and they &quot;fall apart&#x27; in perception-generated innerent melodlc-rhythmic patterns. No one, so far, has Succeeded in composing a new piece that would match in quality and complexity those compositions handed down for generations. Some of them can even be dated by correlating the accompanying song texts with the reign of past kings.

Several genres of music are popular in Buganda. Musicians produce traditional Kiganda music, Kadongo Kamu, Zouk, Dancehall and Reggae. Some of the most famous Kiganda musicians and performers are Annet Nandujja, Elly Wamala, Fred Masagazi, Herman Basudde, Paulo Kafeero, Gerald Kiweewa and Willy Mukabya,Fred Ssebata,Fred Ssebale,Mathias Walukagga.

===Tourism===
Buganda has several tourist attractions and cultural sites including the Kasubi Tombs, and Ssese Islands.

<text>Rebecca Ann Felton (&#x27;Latimer; June 10, 1835 – January 24, 1930) was an American writer, politician, and slave owner who was the first woman to serve in the United States Senate, serving for only one day. She was a prominent member of the Georgia upper class who advocated for prison reform, women&#x27;s suffrage and education reform. Her husband, William Harrell Felton, served in both the United States House of Representatives and the Georgia House of Representatives, and she helped organize his political campaigns. Historian Numan Bartley wrote that by 1915 Felton &quot;was championing a lengthy feminist program that ranged from prohibition to equal pay for equal work.&quot;

A major figure in American first-wave feminism, Felton was also a white supremacist and the last slave owner to serve in the Senate. She spoke vigorously in favor of lynching African Americans, under the pretense of protecting the sexual purity of European-American women. Most often the African Americans whom she admonished were falsely accused of rape.

The most prominent woman in the state of Georgia during the Progressive Era, she was honored near the end of her life by a symbolic one-day appointment to the Senate. Felton was sworn in on November 21, 1922, and served just 24 hours. At the age of 87, she was the oldest freshman senator to enter the Senate. Felton was the only woman to have served as a senator from Georgia until the appointment of Kelly Loeffler in 2020, nearly 100 years later.

==Early life ==
Felton was born in Decatur, Georgia, on June 10, 1835. She was the daughter of Charles Latimer, a prosperous planter, merchant, and general store owner. Charles was a Maryland native who had moved to DeKalb County in the 1820s, and his wife, Eleanor Swift Latimer, was from Morgan, Georgia. Felton was the oldest of four children; her sister, Mary Latimer, also became prominent in women&#x27;s reforms in the early 20th century. When Felton was 15, her father sent her to live with close relatives in the town of Madison, where she attended a private school within a local Presbyterian church. She then went on to attend Madison Female College, from which she received a classical liberal arts education. She graduated at the top of her class, at age 17, in 1852.
Based on her autobiography, Felton&#x27;s ancestors were Virginians and Marylanders before settling in Georgia. As per family tradition, she traced her ancestry to colonial settlers who came from England during the 1600s.

In October 1853, she married Dr. William Harrell Felton at her home, and she moved to live with him on his plantation just north of Cartersville, Georgia. She gave birth to five children, one daughter and four sons. Only one, Howard Erwin Felton, survived childhood. In the aftermath of the Civil War, their plantation was destroyed. Because they were now unable to rely on slave labor as a means of producing income, Dr. Felton returned to farming as a way to earn money until they had enough savings to open a school. Felton and her husband opened Felton Academy in Cartersville, where she and her husband both taught.

==White women&#x27;s suffrage ==

By joining the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union in 1886, Rebecca Latimer Felton was able to achieve stature as a speaker for equal rights for white women. Upon her entrance into the public realm, independent of her husband&#x27;s political career, in the late 19th century, Felton attempted to employ middle-class men to help middle-class women achieve equal status in society. She believed that it was necessary for men to be held accountable, and, during her 1887 address at the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union state convention, she argued that women were actively fulfilling their duties as wives and mothers, but that men undervalued their importance. She argued that women should have more power inside of the home, with more influence on the decision-making process and proper education being provided both to wives and daughters; she further stated that women should have economic independence through this education, training, and later employment, and that women should have more influence over the children. In 1898, Felton wrote &quot;Textile Education for Georgia Girls&quot; as an attempt to convince Georgia legislators that education for girls was necessary. In this article, she argued that it was a man&#x27;s responsibility to take care of his wife and children. Therefore, it was his responsibility to ensure his daughters&#x27; rights and opportunities were equal to his sons&#x27;.

However, this strategy was not working, and, in 1900, Felton joined the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. This move led her to work for women&#x27;s rights, including the right to vote, the progressive movement, free public education for women, and admittance into public universities. A prominent activist for women&#x27;s suffrage in Georgia, Felton found many opponents in anti-suffragist Georgians such as Mildred Lewis Rutherford and Dorothy Blount Lamar. During a 1915 debate with Rutherford and other anti-suffragists before the Georgia legislative committee, the chairman allowed each of the anti-suffragists to speak for 45 minutes but demanded Felton stop speaking after 30 minutes. Felton ignored him and spoke for an extra 15 minutes, at one point making fun of Rutherford and implicitly accusing her of hypocrisy. However, the Georgia legislative committee did not pass the suffrage bill. Georgia was later the first state to reject the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution when it was proposed in 1919, and, unlike most other states in the Union, Georgia did not allow women to vote in the 1920 presidential election. Women in Georgia were not given the right to vote until 1922.

Felton criticized what she saw as the hypocrisy of Southern men who boasted of superior Southern &quot;chivalry&quot; but opposed women&#x27;s rights, and she expressed her dislike of the fact that Southern states resisted white women&#x27;s suffrage longer than other regions of the United States. She wrote, in 1915, that women were denied fair political participation

except in the States which have been franchised by the good sense and common honesty of the men of those States—after due consideration, and with the chivalric instinct that differentiates the coarse brutal male from the gentlemen of our nation. Shall the men of the South be less generous, less chivalrous? They have given the Southern women more praise than the man of the West—but judged by their actions Southern men have been less sincere. Honeyed phrases are pleasant to listen to, but the sensible women of our country would prefer more substantial gifts...

==Racial views==
After she was married at age eighteen, Felton and her husband owned slaves before the American Civil War, and she was the last member of Congress to have been a slave owner.
Felton was a white supremacist. She claimed, for instance, that the more money that Georgia spent on black people&#x27;s education, the more crimes black people committed. For the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, she &quot;proposed a southern exhibit &#x27;illustrating the slave period,&#x27; with a cabin and &#x27;real colored folks making mats, shuck collars, and baskets—a woman to spin and card cotton—and another to play banjo and show the actual life of [the] slave—not the &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; sort. She wanted to display &quot;the ignorant contented darky—as distinguished from Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s monstrosities.&quot;

Felton considered &quot;young blacks&quot; who sought equal treatment &quot;half-civilized gorillas&quot;, and ascribed to them a &quot;brutal lust&quot; for white women. While seeking suffrage for white women, she decried voting rights for black people, arguing that it led directly to the rape of white women.

Felton also advocated more lynchings of black men, saying that such was &quot;elysian&quot; compared to the possible rape of white women. On August 11, 1898, Felton gave a speech in Tybee Island, Georgia, to several hundred members of the Georgia State Agricultural Society. She urged an increase in lynchings in order to protect rural white women from being raped by black men.

Newspapers reprinted a transcript of Felton&#x27;s speech to garner support for the Democratic Party. On August 18, 1898, Alex Manly&#x27;s &quot;Daily Record&quot; printed a rebuttal editorial arguing that white rape of black women was much more frequent, and contact between white women and black men was often consensual. Manly&#x27;s editorial was used as a pretext for the Wilmington Insurrection of November 1898.

Manly was interviewed by the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; three days after the massacre, and he stated that he only had wished to defend &quot;defamed colored men&quot; libeled by Felton. He said that his editorial had been distorted by white newspapers. Felton&#x27;s response appeared in the November 16 issue of the Raleigh &quot;News and Observer&quot;: &quot;When the negro Manly attributed the crime to intimacy between negro men and white women of the South the slanderer should be made to fear a lyncher&#x27;s rope rather than occupy a place in New York newspapers.&quot;

In 1899, a massive crowd of white Georgians arrested, tortured, and lynched a black man, Sam Hose, who had been falsely accused of murdering a white man and raping his victim&#x27;s wife. Felton said that any &quot;true-hearted husband or father&quot; would have killed &quot;the beast&quot; and that Hose was due less sympathy than a rabid dog.

==Day as a senator==

Thomas W. Hardwick, the Governor of Georgia, was planning to run as a candidate in the next election to the U.S. Senate, which was due in 1924. However, the current incumbent Senator Thomas E. Watson died unexpectedly on September 26, 1922. As Governor, Hardwick was entitled to appoint a replacement for Watson until a special election could be arranged. Hardwick sought an appointee who would not be a competitor in the coming election, and to ingratiate himself with the new women voters (who had been alienated by Hardwick&#x27;s opposition to the Nineteenth Amendment). On October 3, Hardwick therefore selected Felton to serve as senator, because she was a well known and respected representative of the suffrage movement. Congress was not expected to reconvene until after the special election, which was scheduled for November 7, so it was considered unlikely that Felton ever would be sworn in. Walter F. George defeated Hardwick by 55% to 33% in the Democratic Party primary, and was elected unopposed in the special election. Rather than take his seat immediately when the Senate reconvened on November 21, George allowed Felton to be sworn in. This was due in part to persuasion by Felton and a supportive campaign launched by the white women of Georgia. George benefited from the gesture, by presenting himself as a friend of the suffrage movement. Felton thus became the first female senator, serving until George took office one day later.

==Final years==
Felton was interviewed on film on April 9, 1929 at her home in Georgia, discussing her political accomplishments and her memories of witnessing part of the Trail of Tears around the year 1838. The interview was created for Fox Movietone News. Felton continued to write and lecture until her final days, finishing her book, &quot;The Romantic Story of Georgia&#x27;s Women&quot;, shortly before her death in Atlanta in 1930. Her remains were interred in the Oak Hill Cemetery in Cartersville.

<doc id="297544" wikidata="Q7888064" url="?curid=297544" title="United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1970">
<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1970 with the song &quot;Knock, Knock Who&#x27;s There?&quot;, written by John Carter and Geoff Stephens, and performed by Mary Hopkin. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final, after having previously selected the performer internally.

==Before Eurovision==
=== &quot;A Song for Europe 1970&quot; ===
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) held the national final on 7 March 1970, presented by Cliff Richard, as part of the BBC1 series &quot;It&#x27;s Cliff Richard!.&quot; Hopkin performed one of the six shortlisted songs each week, before performing all six in succession in the final. These performances were then immediately repeated. The votes were open to the public by post, with the results announced on 14 March, just a week before the Eurovision final itself. The BBC had chosen Welsh singer Mary Hopkin as its representative back in August 1969, having made her name with songs such as &quot;Those Were the Days&quot; and &quot;Goodbye&quot;. At the final, Hopkin was backed by singers John Evans and Brian Bennett, with the orchestra conducted alternately by John Cameron and Johnny Arthey, who directed the orchestra in Amsterdam. Hopkin was allowed to select one song for the contest, this being &quot;You&#x27;ve Everything You Need&quot;, while the other five were selected from over 200 songs put forward by songwriters. &quot;You&#x27;ve Everything You Need&quot; caused a minor scandal on the day of the British final when the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported that the publishers of that song had told all their staff to send in multiple votes. Whether votes had to be then adjusted by the BBC to avoid a scandal is unknown, but the song ended up being placed second-last. &quot;Knock, Knock Who&#x27;s There?&quot; ultimately became the easy victor with 120,290 votes. The song was written by Geoff Stephens and John Carter. The votes presented below were only announced rounded up.
=== Chart success ===
Hopkin recorded all six entries, with the top two placed being released as a single. Of the others, only a bootleg version of &quot;You&#x27;ve Everything You Need&quot; was ever available commercially. &quot;Knock, Knock Who&#x27;s There?&quot; was released as a single and became a hit across Europe, peaking at No.2 in the UK, with the runner up &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Fall in Love Again&quot; on the B-Side. Belatedly, it also became a minor US hit for her in 1972.

== At Eurovision ==
At the Eurovision final, BBC 1 broadcast the Contest with David Gell providing the television commentary, Tony Brandon provided the radio commentary on BBC Radio 1. The contest was also broadcast on British Forces Radio with commentary provided by John Russell.

=== Voting ===
Every participating broadcaster assembled a jury of ten people. Every jury member could give one point to his or her favourite song.

<doc id="297545" wikidata="Q13709" url="?curid=297545" title="Le Canard enchaîné">
<text>(; English: &quot;The Chained Duck&quot; or &quot;The Chained Paper&quot;, as is French slang meaning &quot;newspaper&quot;) is a satirical weekly newspaper in France. Its headquarters is in Paris.

Founded in 1915 during World War I, it features investigative journalism and leaks from sources inside the French government, the French political world and the French business world, as well as many jokes and cartoons. &quot;Le Canard enchaîné&quot; does not accept any advertisements and is privately owned, mostly by its own employees.

==Presentation==

===Early history===

The name is a reference to Radical Georges Clemenceau&#x27;s newspaper &quot;L&#x27;homme libre&quot; (‘The Free Man’), which was forced to close by government censorship and reacted upon its reopening by changing its name to &quot;L&#x27;homme enchaîné&quot; (&quot;The Chained-up Man&quot;); &quot;Le Canard enchaîné&quot; means ‘The chained-up duck’ but &quot;canard&quot; (duck) is also French slang for ‘newspaper’; it was also a reference to French journals published by soldiers during World War I.

The weekly was founded in 1915 by and his wife, , along with H. P. Gassier. It changed its title briefly after World War I to &quot;Le Canard Déchaîné&quot; (‘The duck unbound’ or ‘out of control’) to celebrate the end of military censorship of the press. It resumed the title &quot;Le Canard enchaîné&quot; in 1920.

The title also conveys a double meaning, ‘canard’ being a possible salacious rumour or whisper and ‘enchaîné’ simply meaning linked, hence ‘the inside whisper’. It continued to publish and grow in popularity and influence until it was forced to suspend publication during the German occupation of France in 1940. After the liberation of France it resumed publication. It changed to its eight-page format in the 1960s.

Many of the &quot;Canard&quot;&#x27;s early contributors were members of the Communist and Socialist parties, but it shed its alignment with those groups in the 1920s. Its current owners are not tied to any political or economic group. It now avoids any political alignment, and has gained a reputation for publishing incriminating stories and criticizing any political party with no preference. It is also fairly anti-clerical and lampoons the nobility. The &quot;Canard&quot; does not accept any advertisements.

In the 1920s it used to provide free advertising for &quot;Le Crapouillot&quot;, another satirical magazine created by Jean Galtier-Boissière, a friend of Maurice Maréchal. Similarly &quot;Le Crapouillot&quot; carried free advertisements for the &quot;Canard&quot;. Relations between the two magazines soured during the Spanish Civil War since Maréchal supported the Spanish Republican government of Madrid whilst Galtier-Boissière remained strictly pacifist. The &quot;Canard&quot; and its format served as an inspiration for the satirical weekly magazine &quot;El Be Negre&quot;, published in Barcelona between 1931 and 1936.

===Typical format===

The &quot;Canard&quot; has a fixed eight-page layout. Pages 1, 2–4 and 8 are mostly news and editorials. Page 2 carries anecdotes from the political and business world. Pages 5–7 are dedicated to social issues (such as the environment), profiles, general humour and satire, and literary, theatre, opera and film criticism. One section, called &quot;l&#x27;Album de la Comtesse&quot;, is dedicated to spoonerisms.

The &quot;Canard&quot; is notable because of its focus on scandals in French governmental and business circles, although it does also cover other countries. Although they became more aggressive during François Mitterrand&#x27;s presidency, major French newspapers are traditionally reluctant to challenge government corruption or pursue embarrassing scandals (the rationale being that revealing political or business scandals only profits extremists on the far-left or far-right); hence, the &quot;Canard&quot; fills that gap. The &quot;Canard&quot; publishes insider knowledge on politicians and leaks from administration officials, including information from whistle-blowers. Generally, the &quot;Canard&quot; is well informed about happenings within the world of French politics. Its revelations have sometimes brought about the resignation of cabinet ministers.

Some of the information published by the &quot;Canard&quot; clearly comes from very well-placed sources, who are likely to include ministerial aides. Charles de Gaulle was a frequent target, and was known to ask, &quot;What does the bird have to say?&quot; (&quot;Que dit le volatile?&quot;) every Wednesday – the day &quot;Canard&quot; would roll off the presses. There are often verbatim and off-the-record quotes from major politicians, including the president and prime minister, usually aimed at another politician.

The paper&#x27;s international coverage has been pretty spotty, though it has improved. It relies mostly on leaks from French government services and reports from the other media.

It also publishes satirical cartoons and jokes. The factual and jocular columns are cleanly delineated.

===Regular features===
Every issue includes short political news (&quot;Mare au Canards&quot;); weekly profile (&quot;Prises de Bec&quot;); news from the media world; sections of press clippings (typos and malapropisms found in the French press) &quot;Rue des petites perles&quot; and &quot;À travers la presse déchaînée&quot;; the section which highlights the two most absurd or incomprehensible sentences of the week by politicians, respectively hanging them up on the &quot;mur du çon&quot; or awarding them the &quot;noix d&#x27;honneur&quot;; as well as its &quot;Sur l&#x27;Album de la Comtesse&quot; section of comic, cryptic spoonerisms. Some features are recurring but not present in every issue, such as bogus humorous interviews (&quot;interviews (presque) imaginaires&quot;) which have been copied by many others.

Across the years, it also included recurring features focusing on one or more personalities of the day. Notably during the 1960s, and the cartoonist created a series, &quot;La Cour&quot;, which was a parody of Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs on the Reign of Louis XIV&quot;. Charles de Gaulle was turned into the king, and the deputies and the senators into courtiers. Thus, in &quot;La Cour&quot;, François Mitterrand became the ever-scheming count of Château-Chinon. In &quot;La Cour&quot;, the king would address his subjects by means of the &quot;étranges lucarnes&quot; (strange windows), a phrase de Gaulle had employed about television. After the death of de Gaulle, &quot;La Cour&quot; became &quot;La Régence&quot; with Georges Pompidou being the regent. This followed the Memoirs of Saint-Simon, which also extend into the Regency of Philippe II, Duke of Orléans that followed the death of Louis XIV. After the death of Georges Pompidou, &quot;La Régence&quot; was stopped.

Later long-running features include comical imaginary diaries such as the &quot;Journal de Xavière T.&quot; (following allegations of fake work done by Xavière Tiberi, wife of the then mayor of Paris); the &quot;Journal de Carla B.&quot; (describing Carla Bruni&#x27;s bohemian-bourgeois reactions towards events involving her husband, then President Nicolas Sarkozy); the &quot;Journal de Penelope F.&quot; (in the run-up to the 2017 presidential election and following allegations of fake work by Penelope Fillon, wife of the Les Républicains candidate François Fillon).

The &quot;Canard&quot; also reports on topics affecting the general population: scandals in industries (workforce, safety issues), miscarriages of justice, misconduct in public administrations and services...

As with the British satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;, it has its own language, jargon and style. In particular, it has nicknames for politicians and personalities.
Some examples include:
* Charles de Gaulle: &quot;Mongénéral&quot;, &quot;Badingaulle&quot; (after 13 May 1958, an allusion to Napoléon III)
* François Mitterrand: &quot;Tonton&quot; [Uncle] (the codename used by the French Secret Service in charge of his protection)
* Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing: &quot;Valy&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Ex&quot; (after 1981)
* Raymond Barre: &quot;Babarre&quot;
* Michel Debré: &quot;L&#x27;amer Michel&quot; [Bitter Michael] (from the popular rhyme &quot;La Mère Michel&quot; [Mother Michael])
* Michel Rocard: &quot;Hamster Jovial&quot; (an allusion to a comic by Marcel Gotlib in reference to his past as a scout)
* Robert Hersant: &quot;Le Papivore&quot; (a reference to the many papers that he bought)
* Christian Estrosi: &quot;Le Motodidacte&quot; (a reference to his past in motorbike racing)
* Jean-Pierre Raffarin: &quot;Le Phénix du Haut-Poitou&quot; (from his region of origin)
* Jacques Chirac: &quot;Chichi&quot;, &quot;Le Chi&quot;
* Bernadette Chirac: &quot;Bernie&quot;
* Nicolas Sarkozy: &quot;Sarkoléon&quot; (A portmanteau of Sarkozy with Napoléon), &quot;Le petit Nicolas&quot; (title of a popular series of children&#x27;s books and also a reference to Sarkozy&#x27;s short stature)
* François Hollande: &quot;Monsieur Royal&quot; (a reference to his one-time life-partner Ségolène Royal), the pedalo captain
* Jean-Pierre Chevènement: &quot;Le Che&quot;

==Scandals related to &quot;Le Canard enchaîné&quot;==

===Plumbers affair===
On 3 December 1973, policemen of the Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DST), disguised as plumbers, were caught trying to install a spy microphone in the directorial office of &quot;Le Canard&quot;. The resulting scandal forced Interior Minister Raymond Marcellin to leave the government, though it is said that Marcellin was a scapegoat for other members of the government, especially the Defense Minister, who was intent on knowing the identities of informers for the newspaper.

===Robert Boulin affair===
A series of articles accusing long-serving Gaullist minister and possible Prime Ministerial candidate Robert Boulin of involvement in dubious real estate deals was followed by Boulin&#x27;s mysterious death (October 1979), presumed to be suicide. Following his death, major officials publicly accused &quot;Le Canard enchaîné&quot; of the moral responsibility for Boulin&#x27;s death, and there were broad hints the government might use the reaction to the Boulin death to seek stricter libel laws, as was done in the 1930s after the suicide of Roger Salengro.

Jacques Chaban-Delmas, then President of the National Assembly, who had been politically identified with Boulin for many years, told a special memorial session of the assembly that it should &quot;draw the lessons of this tragedy, of this assassination&quot;. After meeting with President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, Prime Minister Raymond Barre called for &quot;meditation upon the consequences of certain ignominies&quot;, and spoke of &quot;a baseness&quot;. President Giscard d&#x27;Estaing also added to the criticism: Boulin, he said, &quot;was unable to resist the campaign of harassment he was subjected to. Public opinion should severely condemn any other similar campaigns.&quot;

==Notable investigations==
* Marthe Hanau affair (1928)
* Albert Oustric affair (1930)
* Stavisky Affair (1934)
* Cardinal Jean Daniélou&#x27;s death in the house of a prostitute (1974)
* Bokassa&#x27;s diamonds (1980s)
* The &quot;Canard&quot; fought to bring to light evidence of alleged corruption during President Jacques Chirac&#x27;s tenure as mayor of Paris. (&quot;see: Chirac&#x27;s role in Parisian corruption scandals&quot;)
* Contaminated blood scandal (1990s, in French)
* Yann Piat (a former far-right National Front MP, assassinated on 25 February 1994)
* Affair Elf–Dumas (1998)
* The &quot;Canard&quot; made efforts to uncover the Nazi past of former Paris chief of police Maurice Papon (1981).
* The revelations by the &quot;Canard&quot; about Finance Minister Hervé Gaymard&#x27;s lavish state-funded apartment led to his resignation in 2005.
* Fillon affair (Penelopegate): revelations which accuse Penelope Fillon, wife of politician François Fillon, of alleged fictitious employment, as her husband&#x27;s parliamentary assistant for a total salary of 900,000 euros over eight years on the one hand, and as a &quot;literary adviser&quot; of &quot;Revue des deux Mondes&quot; on the other, in January 2017.

==Ownership==
The &quot;Canard&quot; is published by &quot;Les Éditions Maréchal-Le Canard enchaîné&quot; (Maurice and Jeanne Maréchal founded the &quot;Canard&quot;), which is privately owned; the main associates are Michel Gaillard (CEO and director of publication), André Escaro, Nicolas Brimo, Erik Emptaz and employees of the newspaper.

Because it does not accept advertisements (being free of sponsors), being entirely privately owned (being the same,) and because its publishing costs are met by its sales, &quot;Le Canard Enchaîné&quot; is considered one of (if not the) most objective French publications—hence its continued existence.

==Business==
Despite declining newspaper circulations in France and elsewhere &quot;Canard&quot; is rich and growing. It owns cash reserves and property worth 110 million euros. It runs cheaply and profitably, restricting itself to eight pages of two-colour newsprint each week.

Circulation has risen by a third since 2007, its scandal-fuelled growth having seen a rise to 700,000 copies printed and sold each week. Its net profit in 2009 was 5 million euros.

==In popular culture ==
* In the film &quot;L&#x27;Armée des Ombres&quot;, directed by Jean-Pierre Melville, the character Luc Jardie (played by Paul Meurisse), while in London during the German occupation of France during World War II, imagines that his fellow countrymen will be truly liberated when they can see American films and once more read &quot;Le Canard enchaîné&quot;, alluding to the censorship of the Vichy Regime.
* In the TV film &quot;Notable donc coupable&quot; (2007) (translation: Well-to-do hence guilty), the fictional weekly &quot;Le Canardeur&quot; is modelled on &quot;Le Canard enchaîné&quot;.

<text>was a Japanese professional go player, and head of the Inoue house from 1824–1846. He proposed a changed numbering that made him the eleventh head (rather than tenth), by including Doseki at the head of the list.

At various times he was known as Hattori Rittetsu, Inoue Ansetsu, Intetsu, Gennan Inseki, Inoue Gennan Inseki. A talented player at the highest level, but unlucky in practical terms. He was involved in one of the most famous games, the so-called Ear-reddening game against Hon&#x27;inbō Shūsaku.

<text>This page compares the sovereign states of Europe on economic, financial and social indicators.

== Definition of Europe ==
For the purposes of comparison the broader definition of Europe will be used. A sovereign state must meet at least one of the following criteria to be included:
* Be a recognised European state by the United Nations geoscheme for Europe

<text>A birthing center is a healthcare facility, staffed by nurse midwives, midwives and/or obstetricians, for mothers in labor, who may be assisted by doulas and coaches. The midwives monitor the labor, and well-being of the mother and the baby during birth. Doulas can assist the midwives and make the birth easier. Should additional medical assistance be required, the mother can be transferred to a hospital. This transfer is more likely if an epidural is needed, there is meconium staining, it is a prolonged labor, or the newborn needs intensive care. Some hospitals have birth centers as an alternative to the usual high tech maternity wards.

A birth center presents a more home-like environment than a hospital labor ward, typically with more options during labor: food and drink, music, and the attendance of family and friends if desired. Other characteristics can also include non-institutional furniture such as queen-sized beds, large enough for both mother and father, and perhaps birthing tubs or showers for water births, an option that can help to reduce birthing pains. These centers also offer opioid injections (Pethidine) and Entonox gas as a way to help alleviate pain. The decor is meant to emphasize the normality of birth. In a birth center, women are free to act more spontaneously during their birth, such as squatting, walking or performing other postures that assist in labor. Active birth is encouraged. The length of stay after a birth is shorter at a birth center; sometimes just six hours after birth the mother and infant can go home.

== Comparison of traditional vs. alternative ==
A 2012 Cochrane review compared traditional hospital births with alternative, home-like settings in or near conventional hospital labor wards. In comparison with traditional hospital wards, home-like settings had a trend towards an increase in spontaneous vaginal birth, continued breastfeeding at six to eight weeks, and a positive view of care. The review also found that having a birth at an alternative birth center decreased the likelihood of medical intervention during labor, without increasing risk to mother or child. The likelihood of risks during a pregnancy or a mother&#x27;s preexisting medical conditions may impact the ability for that mother to use a birthing center.

== Around the world ==

=== United States ===
Like clinics, birth centers arose on the East and West Coasts in the 1970s, as alternatives to heavily institutionalized health care. Today, use of birthing centers is generally covered by health insurance. Several of the practices which were innovated in birth centers are beginning to enter the mainstream hospital labor and delivery floors, including:

* Bathtubs or whirlpools for labor and/or birthing
* Showers for mothers to labor in
* Hospital acceptance of the mother choosing to walk during labor, use a labor/birthing ball, not use pain medication during labor
* rooming in of the infant after birth
* Beds for family members to stay with the mother during labor and birth

There are more favourable cases where giving birth at a birth center would be ideal. First, the mother may have a low-risk, healthy pregnancy, 
are pregnant with one baby (i.e. not twins), and that the baby is positioned head down (cephalic presentation).

Free-standing birth centers require hospital backup in case complications arise during labor that require more complex care. However, even if a delivery cannot happen at the birth center due to a high-risk pregnancy, birth center midwives might provide prenatal care up to a certain week of gestation.

There also exists birthing centers inside of hospitals. Nearby doctors are very accessible in the case of extreme emergencies (which do not often happen).

==== Accreditation ====
The nationwide organization supporting and promoting birth centers is the American Association of Birth Centers (AABC). Many birth centers nationwide, like hospitals, chose to become accredited through the Commission for the Accreditation of Birth Centers (CABC). Since 1985, CABC has provided this accreditation service, as well as education and support to birth centers and alongside maternity centers. Some birth centers are required to obtain accreditation in order to apply for state licensure, or to become in-network with certain insurance plans. Many birth centers chose voluntarily to undergo accreditation to demonstrate their commitment to safety and continuous quality improvement.

Accreditation depends on a set of measures, called indicators, against which birth centers are evaluated during site visits by CABC Accreditation Specialists. Adherence to these indicators ensures both safety of mother and infant as well as protects the integrity of the birth center model of care as distinct from hospital care. For example, while continuous fetal monitoring is typical in hospital labor and delivery units, intermittent monitoring with a handheld electronic device is used in birth centers to protect the birthing woman&#x27;s freedom of mobility during her labor and birth. CABC Indicators also require a birth center to have a written plan for how to proceed with transfer to a hospital in the event of an emergency that cannot be managed at the birth center.

Birth center applications for accreditation are reviewed by Commissioners on the board of trustees of the CABC. These Commissioners are Certified Nurse‐Midwives, certified professional midwives, physician specialists in obstetrics and neonatology, nurses, and birth center consumers. The Commissioners meet quarterly to review items of concern relevant to birth center education and development and publish a monthly newsletter for CABC-accredited birth centers for continuing education. The CABC works with policy advocacy organizations to advance and promote birth centers and the midwifery model of care. While CABC works closely alongside the AABC, the organizations are separate and have distinctly separate roles regarding national standards and accreditation of birth centers. CABC is the only accrediting body devoted exclusively to birth centers, whose site visitors are specifically trained to conduct a site visit in a birth center; and whose review panels have first‐hand knowledge of the philosophy, clinical care and operation of birth centers. AABC on the other hand, is a membership and trade organization for established and developing birth centers and other individuals, agencies and institutions that support the birth center model of care and the national AABC Standards for Birth Centers.

There has been much research in recent years to support out of hospital birth—especially birth center birth—as not just safe but at times safer than hospital birth because of its judicious use of technology, licensed professionals and connection to the health care system.

==== Amish centers ====
The Amish, known for their great respect for tradition, usually have homebirths or give birth at birthing centers. Most Amish women only go to a hospital to give birth when there is a known medical risk for her or the child, but some Amish women choose to go the hospital during labor for peace of mind. Two books have been written about Amish medical issues including their birthing practices: &quot;Dr. Frau: A Woman Doctor among the Amish&quot; by Grace Kaiser and &quot;House calls and hitching posts: stories from Dr. Elton Lehman&#x27;s career among the Amish&quot; by Elton Lehman. Lehman is known for his work in founding a freestanding Amish birthing center. The Mount Eaton Care Center, Ohio&#x27;s first such center, was established in 1984. In her book, &quot;Kaiser&quot; recounts the private nature of birthing among the Amish. She points out the practice of Amish women keeping labor a secret to all except their own husbands and midwife or obstetrician, as well as the practice of women waiting until active labor before summoning a midwife or OB. Due to the latter practice, fathers occasionally end up delivering their own children before the midwife or OB can arrive if a homebirth is selected. Amish women who choose a home birth often continue with household duties until they are no longer physically able to continue. If birthing in a birth center, they are free to labor similar to that of home births: eating, drinking, visiting with their family members, etc.

=== Australia ===
In a response to the National Maternity Action Plan, State and Territory Governments in 2002 started to respond to consumer demand for an increased number of birth centers to be made available to women. Whilst most birth centers are attached to hospitals, some are being established as free-standing centers much further away from hospital back-up. As long as they are within 90 minutes of a hospital, they are considered &#x27;safe&#x27;. Most birth centers are now being run solely by midwives, with obstetric back-up only used when there are complications.

Some birth centers in Australia are moving away from the &#x27;low-risk&#x27; model and are moving to an &quot;All-risk model&quot; where women with medical complications are accepted into the birth center but extra care is provided to them where necessary.

=== Canada ===

Birthing centers remain controversial. Hospitals do offer this option, and it is available at special clinics.

=== Netherlands ===
The Netherlands has seen a growth in the number of locations for giving birth, other than homebirth or hospital maternity wards. In these facilities the birth is overseen by a midwife, typically in a homelike environment. Most community midwives work in group practices and only refer patients to hospital obstetric units for labor complications. Certification requires a four-year education at a midwifery academy.

=== Nepal ===
A three-year study focusing on the remote Solukhumbu District explored access to perinatal care and found that 36% of deliveries took place in a health facility. Results from this study noted that access to timely transportation options were a major factor in the lack of accessibility for maternal delivery support.

<text>Germany was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1957 with the song &quot;&quot;, composed by Friedrich Meyer, with lyrics by Ralph Maria Siegel, and performed by Margot Hielscher. The German participating broadcaster on behalf of ARD, (HR), selected its entry through a national final. In addition, HR was also the host broadcaster and staged the event at the in Frankfurt.

== Before Eurovision ==
 (HR) on behalf of ARD, organised and produced the German national final as part of the show . was a regular game show starting in autumn 1956. The selection of the German entry took place at the Großer Sendesaal des Hessischen Rundfunks in Frankfurt – the same venue as for the Eurovision Song Contest 1957 – on 17 February 1957 at 20:15 CET (19:15 UTC). The final was broadcast on ARD&#x27;s Deutsches Fernsehen, and abroad on ORF and NTS. It was hosted by Hans-Joachim Kulenkampff and directed by . oversaw the production of the show. 

Four songs competed in the national final. The artists were accompanied by the Tanzorchester des Hessischen Rundfunks under the musical direction of Willy Berking. A jury consisting of the directors of entertainment programs of the West-German broadcasters decided the winner. Each juror distributed ten points among his favourite songs. &quot;&quot;, composed by , and with lyrics by , won the national final with a large margin and was selected as the German entry.
== At Eurovision ==
HR hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 1957 in Frankfurt, when there was still no format in place for the previous year&#x27;s winning broadcaster to host the following year, and following Switzerland hosting and winning in 1956. &quot;&quot; was conducted by Willy Berking and Hielscher performed seventh, following the and preceding . The song received eight points, placing fourth in a field of ten. The song&#x27;s lyrics gave rise to what is generally considered the first &quot;gimmick performance&quot; in the contest history, with Hielscher in fact picking up a real telephone receiver during her performance. At the end of the song, she picks it up again and explains &quot;on the telephone&quot; that she can&#x27;t talk anymore because her song is ending. It was succeeded as German representative at the 1958 contest by Hielscher again, with &quot;&quot;.

Eurovision Song Contest 1957 was broadcast on ARD&#x27;s Deutsches Fernsehen and on HR&#x27;s radio station Zweites Programm. Excerpts from the show were also broadcast on UKW West (WDR) on 29 April 1957 at 21:15 CET.

=== Voting ===
Each participating broadcaster assembled a ten-member jury panel. Every jury member could give one point to his or her favourite song.

<doc id="297563" wikidata="Q1279204" url="?curid=297563" title="Allen Funt">
<text>Allen Albert Funt (September 16, 1914 – September 5, 1999) was an American television producer, director, writer and television personality, best known as the creator and host of &quot;Candid Camera&quot; from the 1940s to 1980s, as either a regular television show or a television series of specials. Its most notable run was from 1960 to 1967 on CBS.

==Early life and education==
Funt was born into a Jewish family in New York City, New York. His father Isidore Funt was a diamond wholesaler, and his mother was Paula Saferstein Funt.

Allen graduated from high school at age 15. Too young to attend college on his own, he studied at Pratt Institute (also located in Brooklyn). He later earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in fine arts from Cornell University, studied business administration at Columbia University, then returned to Pratt for additional art instruction.

==Career==
===Radio and television===
Trained in commercial art, Funt worked for an advertising agency in their art department, but he eventually moved to its radio department. Among his first jobs for radio, he wrote for &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; and assisted US First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt with her radio commentaries.

Drafted into the military during World War II and stationed in Oklahoma, Funt served in the Army Signal Corps, eventually making radio shows. He began his signature program on ABC Radio as &quot;The Candid Microphone&quot; on June 28, 1947, and it ran until September 23, 1948. The program was revived on CBS June 6 – August 29, 1950. He soon experimented with a visual version by doing a series of theatrical short films also known as &quot;Candid Microphone&quot;. These film shorts served as a springboard for his entrance into television on August 10, 1948. The show ran on all three major TV networks and in syndication while hosted by Allen Funt until he was sidelined by a stroke in 1993. Others appearing on the original show as a host or co-host were Arthur Godfrey, Durward Kirby, Dorothy Collins and Bess Myerson.

The syndicated version of &quot;Candid Camera&quot; was broadcast from 1974 to 1979; his co-hosts included, at various times, John Bartholomew Tucker, Phyllis George and Jo Ann Pflug.

In 1964, Funt appeared as himself in an episode of the situation comedy &quot;The New Phil Silvers Show&quot;.

===Films===
During the 1970s, Funt made two documentary films based on the hidden camera theme: the X-rated &quot;What Do You Say to a Naked Lady?&quot; (1970) and &quot;Money Talks&quot; (1972). In the 1980s, Funt produced a series of adult-oriented videos called &quot;Candid Candid Camera&quot;.

===Other pursuits===
Funt donated his recordings and films to his alma mater Cornell University and established a fellowship at Syracuse University for postgraduate studies in radio and television &quot;aimed at providing the broadcast industry with qualified black personnel.&quot;

He established a foundation which used laughter therapy for seriously ill patients by providing videocassettes of &quot;Candid Camera&quot; episodes. He also taught psychology at Monterey Peninsula College.

==Personal life==
In 1946, Funt married Evelyn Michal (1920–2014) with whom he had three children, Peter, Patricia, and John. In 1964 the couple was divorced and the same year Funt married Marilyn Laron, from whom he was divorced in 1978. The couple had two children, Juliet and William. Funt had seven grandchildren.

On February 3, 1969, Funt, his wife, and his two youngest children boarded Eastern Airlines Flight 7 in Newark, New Jersey, with a destination of Miami, Florida. While en route, two men hijacked the plane and demanded passage to Cuba. However, some of the passengers, having spotted Funt, believed the whole thing to be a &quot;Candid Camera&quot; stunt. Funt repeatedly attempted to persuade his fellow passengers as to the reality of the hijacking, but to no avail. The plane landed in Cuba, finally convincing the passengers. Funt and the other passengers were released after 11 hours of captivity.

Funt amassed a collection of works by the Victorian painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema and engineered an exhibition of them at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (bypassing the wishes of then director Thomas Hoving). The collection&#x27;s value skyrocketed as a result, and Funt sold them at a handsome profit.

Funt resided in Croton-on-Hudson, Westchester County, New York. His estate, White Gates, was sold to opera singer Jessye Norman in the early 1990s. Funt in the early 1970s purchased a ranch located south of Carmel near Big Sur, California, &quot;where he raised Hereford cattle and quarter horses&quot; Funt later purchased the nearby Bixby Ranch where he resided. Both ranches were eventually bought by The Trust for Public Land which expected to turn the land over to the US Forest Service.

After a stroke in 1993, he became incapacitated and died in 1999 in Pebble Beach, California, 11 days before his 85th birthday. &quot;Candid Camera&quot; continued with his son, Peter Funt, as host.

<text>Peter Funt (born 1947) is an American actor, host, and producer for the hit TV show &quot;Candid Camera&quot;. He worked for Denver radio station KHOW, the ABC Radio Network, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and various other media organizations. He is a University of Denver graduate.

==Early life==
Peter Funt grew up in New York, where he worked summers on the set of his father Allen Funt&#x27;s show, &quot;Candid Camera&quot;. He graduated from the University of Denver, earning his Bachelor of Arts in mass communications and journalism. During his time at the university he worked on the newspaper, &quot;The Clarion&quot;, as well as the radio station, KVDU. While a student, he interviewed Martin Luther King Jr. on his radio show in 1967.

After he graduated he worked at the Denver radio station KHOW and at the ABC Radio Network in New York. In 1970, he won the Silurian&#x27;s Award for that year&#x27;s best news reporting based upon Funt&#x27;s coverage on ABC News of racial disturbances in Asbury Park, New Jersey. Afterwards he got a job as an arts and leisure writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. During his earlier career, he also authored a book titled &quot;Gotcha!&quot; on the lost art of practical joking and was the editor and publisher of the television magazine &quot;On Cable&quot;.

==Career==
===Involvement with &quot;Candid Camera&quot;===
&quot;Candid Camera&quot; first aired in 1948 and was created by Peter Funt&#x27;s father, Allen. Peter first appeared on &quot;Candid Camera&quot; at age 3, posing as a shoeshine boy who charged ten dollars per shoe. He joined the show professionally in 1987 when he became a co-host with his father. During this time the show was being broadcast on the CBS television network. In 1993, Allen Funt had a serious stroke, from which he never fully recovered. This required Peter to host the show full-time. Later in 1996, he hosted and was the executive producer of the &quot;Candid Camera&quot; 50th anniversary special. The show returned in 1996 for the revamped version of &quot;Candid Camera&quot;. In 1997, Peter co-hosted the show with Suzanne Somers. In 2001, the show moved to the PAX network and Peter then co-hosted the show with Dina Eastwood until 2004, and began another revival of the show in 2014 with Mayim Bialik. During his time on the show Peter was a producer, host and acted on the show. He also produced and hosted over 200 episodes.

In 2001, Philip Zelnick, a Laughlin/Bullhead International Airport passenger claimed that he was injured during one of the sequences on the show. Funt posed as an airport security guard and had passengers go through a fake x-ray machine. During the skit, Zelnick received a bruise on his thigh when getting off a conveyor belt. Zelnick sued Funt and the show and won the case, but when Funt appealed, the matter was settled out of court. The Mojave County Airport Authority settled during the trial and paid Zelnick $95,000. PAX TV also gave him $7,500 out of court.

===Career after &quot;Candid Camera&quot;===
Following his work with &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, Funt has written frequent op-eds for many nationally recognized news outlets including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, as well as &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. In these articles he offered observations and opinions about television and film. His essay about the evolution of television was later included in &quot;The Story of American Business&quot;, which was published in 2009 by the Harvard Business Press. He also has a weekly column distributed by the Cagle Syndicate.

In addition to developing new &quot;Candid Camera&quot; shows, Funt performs a live tribute stage show, &quot;Candid Camera&#x27;s Lol Tour,&quot; in theaters across the U.S.

Funt will frequently use clips from his time on &quot;Candid Camera&quot; to give a visual to the point he is trying to convey. He used both his speaking ability and his clips in publishing two business training videos, entitled &quot;Too Close to the Customer&quot; and &quot;Expect the Unexpected&quot;. Both of these are still marketed frequently throughout the business community. His current presentation to business groups is called &quot;The Candid You&quot;.

In addition to his publishing career, Funt is also the founder of the Monterey County Young Journalists program in California. The program offers hands-on training for high school students to help pursue their journalism goals. He has also inaugurated the Courtroom Journalism in Monterey County, as well as a statewide event for the Constitutional Right Foundation in Los Angeles.

===Laughter Therapy Foundation===
Funt has followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps by taking over as President of the Laughter Therapy Foundation. Started in 1982 by Allen Funt, the foundation uses the immense comedic library of &quot;Candid Camera&quot; to send special tapes to terminally ill people throughout the country.

==Personal life==
In 1986, Peter Funt married Amy Suzanne Meltzer. He has two children. He currently lives in central California.

<text>Desilu Productions, Inc. () was an American television production company founded and co-owned by husband and wife Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball. The company is best known for shows such as &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, &quot;Mannix&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Until 1962, Desilu was the second-largest independent television production company in the United States, behind MCA&#x27;s Revue Studios, until MCA bought Universal Pictures and Desilu became and remained the number-one independent production company, until Ball sold it to Gulf and Western Industries (then the parent company of Paramount Pictures) in 1968.

Ball and Arnaz jointly owned the majority stake in Desilu from its inception until 1962, when Ball bought out Arnaz and ran the company by herself for several years. Ball had succeeded in making Desilu profitable again by 1968, when she sold her shares of Desilu to Gulf+Western for $17 million (valued at $ in ). Gulf+Western then transformed Desilu into the television production arm of Paramount Pictures, rebranding the company as the original Paramount Television.

Desilu&#x27;s entire library is owned by Paramount Global through two of its subsidiaries. The CBS unit owns all Desilu properties that were produced and concluded before 1960, which were sold to CBS by Desilu itself. Its CBS Studios unit owns the rights to everything Desilu produced after 1960 as successor in interest to Paramount Television.

There is a street named after Desilu in San Antonio, Texas.

== History ==
Desilu Productions was founded in 1950 using the combined names of the husband and wife production team of &quot;Desi Arnaz&quot; and &quot;Lucille Ball&quot;. It was created to produce Lucy and Desi&#x27;s vaudeville act as a television series and sell it to Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) executives. Arnaz and Ball wanted to adapt Ball&#x27;s CBS radio series &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot; to television. The television project eventually became &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. During the show&#x27;s first few years, Desilu rented space at General Service Studios (now the Sunset Las Palmas Studios) at Santa Monica Boulevard and North Las Palmas Avenue. They used Stage Two, which was named Desilu Playhouse. Later, a special entrance was added at 6633 Romaine Street, on the south side of the lot, to allow direct access to it.

=== Ball&#x27;s role in the company ===
Ball&#x27;s contribution was more on the artistic side. She was skilled at proposing new programs that were popular to broad audiences and successful in both their original broadcasts and syndication reruns. Before starring in &quot;I Love Lucy,&quot; she starred in many B movies, and had a good idea of what television audiences wanted.

She approved original production concepts (such as &quot;The Untouchables&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot;) for development into broadcast series, assessing how the public would enjoy them and their potential for long-term success. This led to continued profits from the programs through reruns, which would recover their high development and production costs. Even decades after the absorption of Desilu Productions and the production end of all original series Desilu approved for development, some series have achieved enduring success and, in some cases, redevelopment into feature-length movie franchises in their own right. Examples are &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Mission Impossible&quot;.

=== Arnaz&#x27;s role in the company ===
Much of Desilu Productions&#x27; early success can be traced to Arnaz&#x27;s unusual business style in his role as producer of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. For example, lacking formal business training, he knew nothing of amortization and often included all the costs incurred by the production into the first episode of a season rather than spreading them across the projected number of episodes in the year. As a result, by the end of the season, episodes were nearly entirely paid for, at preposterously low figures.

At that time, most television programs were broadcast live, and as the largest markets were in New York, the rest of the country received only images derived from kinescopes. Karl Freund, the cameraman on &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, and Arnaz himself have been credited with the development of the linked multifilm camera setup using adjacent sets in front of a live audience that became the standard production method for situation comedy. The use of film enabled every station around the country to broadcast high-quality images of the show. Arnaz was told it was impossible to allow an audience onto a sound stage, but he worked with Freund to design sets that accommodated audiences, allowed filming, and adhered to fire, health, and safety codes.

Network executives considered the use of film an unnecessary extravagance. Arnaz persuaded them to allow Desilu to cover all additional costs associated with filming, rather than broadcasting live, under the stipulation that Desilu owned and controlled all rights to the film prints and negatives. Arnaz&#x27;s unprecedented arrangement is widely considered to be one of the shrewdest deals in television history. As a result of his foresight, Desilu reaped the profits from all reruns of the series.

=== Early years ===
Desilu soon outgrew its first space and in 1954 bought its own studio, the Motion Picture Center on Cahuenga Boulevard in Hollywood, what is now Red Studios Hollywood. Most of the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; episodes were produced there.

In late 1957, the company bought the RKO Pictures production facilities for $6 million from General Tire and Rubber, including RKO&#x27;s main facilities on Gower Street in Hollywood and the RKO-Pathé lot (now Culver Studios) in Culver City. This purchase included Forty Acres, the backlot where exteriors for &quot;Mayberry&quot; were filmed. These acquisitions gave the Ball-Arnaz TV empire a total of 33 sound stages — four more than Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and eleven more than Twentieth Century-Fox had in 1957.

The studio&#x27;s initial attempt to become involved in film production was the film &quot;Forever, Darling&quot; (1956), Arnaz and Ball&#x27;s followup to their highly successful MGM release &quot;The Long, Long Trailer&quot; (1954), but it was a box-office failure. It was produced at Desilu, but under the banner of Zanra Productions (Arnaz spelled backward). Most subsequent attempts to bring projects to the big screen were aborted until &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot; (1968) with Ball and Henry Fonda. This film was a critical and financial success.

In 1960, Desi Arnaz sold the pre-1960s shows to CBS. Desilu Productions retained ownership of those shows that premiered after 1960, and were still in production.

=== Ball as sole owner ===

Ball and Arnaz divorced in 1960. In November 1962, Arnaz resigned as president when his holdings in the company were bought out by Ball, who succeeded him as president. Ball served as president and chief executive officer of Desilu while at the same time starring in her own weekly series. This made her the first woman to head a major studio and one of the most powerful women in Hollywood at the time. Ball founded Desilu Sales, Inc., for syndication which distributed Jay Ward Productions&#x27; &quot;Fractured Flickers&quot; in 1964. Today, Desilu Sales is part of CBS Media Ventures (formerly CBS Television Distribution).

During Ball&#x27;s time as sole owner, Desilu developed popular series such as &quot;&quot; (1966), &quot;Mannix&quot; (1967), and &quot;Star Trek&quot; (1966). It has been falsely rumored that a Desilu loss during this time was Carol Burnett, who declined to star in a sitcom for the studio in favor of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, a weekly variety show that lasted 11 seasons. In truth, &quot;Here&#x27;s Agnes&quot; was offered to Burnett by CBS executives who attempted to dissuade her from having a variety show because they felt that men were better suited for them. Burnett and Ball, however, remained close friends, often guest-starring in each other&#x27;s series.

In 1967, Ball agreed to sell her television company to Gulf+Western, which had only recently acquired Paramount Pictures. The company was renamed Paramount Television, and the former RKO main lot on Gower Street was absorbed into the adjacent Paramount lot. The old RKO globe logo is still in place. The company is now called CBS Studios (formerly CBS Television Studios). Perfect Film purchased Desilu Studios&#x27; other lot in Culver City in 1968.

=== Independent Arnaz ===
Arnaz left television production for a few years but returned in 1966 when he formed his own company, Desi Arnaz Productions, based at Desilu. Desi Arnaz Productions, along with United Artists Television, co-produced &quot;The Mothers-in-Law&quot; for the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). Arnaz attempted to sell other television pilots, including a comedy with Carol Channing and an adventure series with Rory Calhoun. Neither series sold. Arnaz also tried to create a law drama called &quot;Without Consent&quot;, with Spencer Tracy as a defense attorney, but after several attempts at developing a suitable script failed and because of insurance concerns regarding Tracy&#x27;s heavy drinking, the project was abandoned.

=== Independent Ball and Desilu Too ===
After selling Desilu, Ball established her own new production company, Lucille Ball Productions (LBP), in 1968. The company went to work on her new series &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; that year. The program ran until 1974 and enjoyed several years of ratings success. Ball returned to network television in 1986 with the short-lived &quot;Life with Lucy&quot;. It lasted eight episodes before it was cancelled—a first for Ball—because of poor ratings. LBP continues to exist, and its primary purpose is residual sales of license rights for &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;.

Desilu-Paramount TV&#x27;s holdings are owned by Paramount Global (formerly ViacomCBS), the owner of the pre-1960s shows. Desilu Productions Inc. was reincorporated in Delaware in 1967, by Paramount Pictures and still exists as a legal entity. Desilu Too LLC was later created by Lucie Arnaz mostly as a licensee for &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;-related merchandise. Desilu Too also partners with MPI Home Video and Lucille Ball Productions (formed by Ball and second husband Gary Morton) on the video releases of &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; and other material Ball and Arnaz made independently of each other. Desilu Too officials have worked with MPI Home Video for the home video reissue of &quot;The Mothers-In-Law&quot;. Paramount Home Entertainment (through CBS DVD) continues to hold DVD distribution rights to the CBS library. In November 2019, CBS Studios registered the DESILU trademark again to protect its previous Common Law trademark usage. Syndication rights for &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; were sold by Ball to Telepictures, which later merged with Lorimar Television and ultimately was folded into Warner Bros. Television. Warner Bros. Television is the show&#x27;s current distributor, although MPI now holds home video rights under license from Lucille Ball Productions and Desilu Too.

== Technological innovations ==

Desilu began the creation of its productions using conventional film studio materials, production, and processing techniques. The use of these materials and techniques meant that the 35 mm negatives (the source material for copyright purposes) were immediately available for production and distribution of prints when the &quot;Lucy&quot; series went into syndication at local stations around the country. As such, no &quot;lost&quot; episodes of programs occurred, and no programs were recorded by kinescope from the television broadcast.

Through the use of film-studio production techniques, the content and quality of Desilu productions displayed a high standard relative to peers in television of the 1950s and &#x27;60s. Moreover, they were readily adaptable to both comedy and drama formats and were able to handle special effects or feature interior or exterior sets and locations with equal ease.

<text>Gulf and Western Industries, Inc. (stylized as Gulf+Western) was an American conglomerate. The company originally focused on manufacturing and resource extraction, but it began purchasing a number of entertainment companies beginning in 1966 and continuing through the 1970s. Most notable among the acquisitions were film studio Paramount Pictures in 1966, television studio Desilu Productions in 1967, arcade and later videogame manufacturer Sega in 1969, book publisher Simon &amp; Schuster in 1975, and a number of music labels including Dot Records (a subsidiary of Paramount at the time of purchase). Some of these properties were reorganized under the Paramount brand, with Dot Records becoming the nucleus of Paramount Records and Desilu being renamed Paramount Television. 

The company pivoted to focus on entertainment and publishing, selling off its other assets through the course of the 1980s. Gulf and Western rebranded itself as Paramount Communications in 1989.

A controlling interest of Paramount Communications was purchased by Viacom in 1994, and the entertainment assets of Gulf and Western are today part of the media conglomerate Paramount Global.

== History ==
=== Bluhdorn period ===
Gulf and Western&#x27;s origins date to the 1934 founding of the Michigan Bumper Corporation. In 1955, the company changed its name to Michigan Plating and Stamping Company, and later in 1956 it was taken over by Charles Bluhdorn. In 1957, Michigan Plating and Stamping acquired the Beard &amp; Stone Electric Company of Houston, Texas, and changed its name to Gulf and Western Corporation in 1958. Bluhdorn treated this name change as the company&#x27;s &quot;founding&quot; for the purpose of later anniversaries. The name reflected its operations in Houston near the Gulf of Mexico and the intent to serve the growing automotive industry in the Western United States. It was changed once again in 1960 to Gulf and Western Industries.

Under Bluhdorn, the company diversified into a variety of businesses that included agriculture, apparel, building products, entertainment, financial services, home and consumer products, natural resources, and publishing.

Stevens &amp; Company, Matadero del Este, Mohasco Corporation, Alberto-Culver, Amfac, B.F. Goodrich, Brunswick Corporation, Bulova, Cluett Peabody &amp; Company, Cummins, Fratelli Fabbri Editori, General Tire, Libbey-Owens-Ford, Munsingwear and Uniroyal, among other companies.

===Other activities===
At the time of its acquisition by Gulf and Western in 1966, Paramount was struggling with heavy losses from feature film productions and had stopped producing television programs. However, it had valuable hidden assets, such as extensive real estate holdings and a library of old movies that could be sold to television networks for large profits. After paying $125 million for Paramount, Gulf and Western saw its sales improve to $450 million, elevating the company to the top 110 U.S. manufacturing companies. Bluhdorn appointed himself as chief executive officer, chairman, and president of Paramount and promoted Martin S. Davis to chief operating officer and executive vice president. The acquisition of Paramount was a significant move in Gulf and Western&#x27;s diversification strategy and allowed the company to expand into the entertainment industry.

With the Paramount acquisition, Gulf and Western became parent company of the International Telemeter Corporation, the Canadian Famous Players movie theater chain, the Dot Records label, the Famous Music publishing company (created in 1928 by Famous Players–Lasky Corporation, Paramount&#x27;s predecessor), and the Famous Studios animation studio (which would be shut down almost immediately after the acquisition). After Stax Records was acquired in 1968 (along with sister label Volt Records and East Publishing Company), it became a subsidiary of Dot, although Dot was not at all mentioned on the label (rather, Dot and Stax were noted as subsidiaries of Paramount). Later on, the record operation was moved under Famous Music.

In 1967, New Jersey Zinc constructed a diammonium phosphate fertilizer plant in DePue, Illinois, which was later leased and then bought outright by Mobil Chemical. The plant was designated a Superfund site after its closure and CBS and ExxonMobil became the responsible parties for the cleanup. Also in 1967, Gulf and Western purchased Lucille Ball&#x27;s Desilu Productions library, which included most of her television product, as well as such properties as &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;&quot;, both of which would rank amongst its most profitable commodities over the years. The three Desilu lots – the original RKO Studios and two Culver City locations – were also included in the sale, but the Justice Department forced Gulf and Western to sell the Culver Studios (which Perfect Film &amp; Chemical Corporation acquired in 1968) to avoid a monopoly. Desilu Productions was renamed Paramount Television and its distribution arm, Desilu Sales, became Paramount Television Sales.

In 1969, Gulf and Western sold Norma-Hoffman to the German company FAG (Fischer Aktien Gesellschaft). Also that year, Gulf and Western Indonesia signed a contract with the Indonesian state owned Pertamina Oil Company to explore oil resources in east Indonesia, and the Dominican government and Gulf and Western Americas Corporation established an industrial free zone in La Romana. The zone was administered by Gulf and Western America&#x27;s Operadora Zona Franca de La Romana subsidiary.

In the early 1970s, after a lunch meeting between Bluhdorn and Lew Wasserman, Gulf and Western&#x27;s Paramount and MCA&#x27;s Universal merged their international operations to create Cinema International Corporation, a joint venture. United Artists later joined the joint venture, which became United International Pictures.

In 1970, Gulf and Western sold a 50% stake in Marathon Studio Facilities to Società Generale Immobiliare and acquired 15 million shares in the company (which represented 10.5 percent of its common stock). Also that year, Casmo Mining Ltd. was incorporated as a subsidiary of New Jersey Zinc, Hubbard Spool was sold to the Wanskuck Company, the Hardie agricultural sprayer line to the Lockwood Corporation, and Stax Records back to its original owners, and with it the rights to all Stax recordings not owned by Atlantic Records. A year before, Dot&#x27;s non-country music roster and catalog was moved to a newly created label, Paramount Records (the name was previously used by a Paramount Records label unrelated to the film studio; Paramount acquired the rights to that name in order to launch this label). It assumed Dot&#x27;s status as the flagship label of Paramount&#x27;s record operations, releasing music by pop artists and soundtracks from Paramount&#x27;s films and television series. Dot meanwhile became a country label.

In 1971, Tumbleweed Records was formed by Larry Ray and Bill Szymczyk with the financial backing of Gulf and Western. The label was a subsidiary of Famous Music until 1973, when it folded. Also in 1971, Gulf and Western acquired certain assets of Auto Pak Company, Inc.

In 1972, Gulf and Western signed an agreement to provide equipment for the Soviet Union&#x27;s Kama River truck plant project. As part of the agreement, Gulf and Western&#x27;s E. W. Bliss division would provide one automated truck parts production line. According to the company, negotiations were under way for six more lines. Also in 1972, Gulf and Western sold its Conrad/Missimer division (which it created after acquiring Missimers in 1968 and merging it with Conrad) to Bemco Inc., Etablissements Daniel Doyen (which had already been a direct subsidiary since the 1960s) to A.P.S. Inc. (another Gulf and Western subsidiary), Angle Steel to Kewaunee Scientific Corporation, and Amron to Weatherby Nasco Inc. in exchange for Weatherby Nasco shares.

Famous Music provided distribution for several independent labels, such as Neighborhood Records and Sire Records. Famous began distributing yet another independent label, Blue Thumb Records, before buying it outright in 1972. In 1974, Gulf and Western sold the entire record operation to the American Broadcasting Company, which continued the Dot and Blue Thumb imprints as subsidiaries of ABC Records, while discontinuing the Paramount label altogether. Also that year, Gulf and Western sold Flinchbaugh Products to Clabir&#x27;s General Defense subsidiary. and Sega Enterprises, Ltd. was taken public in the United States by making it a subsidiary of another firm owned by Gulf and Western called the Polly Bergen Company (acquired in 1971), which was publicly traded and had become a shell corporation after selling most of its assets to Fabergé. David Rosen was appointed chief executive officer of Polly Bergen, which was renamed Sega Enterprises, Inc.

In 1975, Gulf and Western formed a joint venture with Union Minière of Belgium called Jersey Miniere Zinc Company. Gulf and Western owned a 60% stake in the joint venture, while Union Minière owned a 40% stake. Also in 1975, Gulf and Western&#x27;s Sega subsidiary bought a 50% stake in Kingdom of Oz, a company that operated arcades in California shopping malls which would later be rebranded as Sega Centers.

In 1976, during the shooting of the film Sorcerer in Villa Altagracia, a lawsuit was filed against Cinema Dominica (a subsidiary of Gulf and Western) by Dominican businessmen for alleged damages. The newspaper El Caribe said that the lawsuit against Cinema Dominica charged that the company had “failed to comply with the rental contract it signed for use of the town&#x27;s commercial locations.

In 1977, after acquiring Muntz Manufacturing (a projection TV manufacturer founded by Earl Muntz) the year prior, Sega introduced the Sega-Vision widescreen TV (production was suspended the next year). Also that year, Thai Zinc Ltd. (a subsidiary of New Jersey Zinc) and the government of Thailand signed a contract of a $90 million zinc mine and refinery project after three years of negotiation.

While working for Paramount, Barry Diller had proposed a &quot;fourth network&quot;; ultimately, the Paramount Television Service was cancelled six months prior to launch by Bluhdorn, who feared a major loss of revenue had the network gone forward. As a result, Paramount sold the Hughes Television Network (which it had acquired including its satellite time in planning for PTVS in 1976) to Madison Square Garden in 1979. Diller later left Paramount for 20th Century Fox; that studio&#x27;s new owner, News Corporation, was interested in starting a network, which became the Fox Broadcasting Company.

=== Early 1980s ===
On June 5, 1980, Gulf and Western unveiled an electric car, powered by a zinc chloride battery that would hold a charge for several hours and permit speeds of up to . By year&#x27;s end, the U.S. Department of Energy (which had invested $15 million in the project) reported that the battery had 65% less power than predicted and could be recharged only by highly trained personnel. Also in 1980, Gulf and Western sold Hammacher Schlemmer to J. Roderick MacArthur&#x27;s Bradford Exchange and its 80% interest in Brown Company to James River Corporation in return for cash and James River stock. Bluhdorn was confident that James River stock would be more profitable than Brown was for Gulf and Western.

In 1981, former officials of Gulf and Western Natural Resources Group led a buyout of New Jersey Zinc and made it a subsidiary of Horsehead Industries, Inc. That same year, Gulf and Western announced it would shut down its Schrafft Candy subsidiary (which it had acquired from Helme Products in 1974) after it had continued to be unprofitable. Schrafft&#x27;s was later sold to the American Safety Razor Company.

In 1982, executive vice president Don Gaston (who had also served on the board of Gulf and Western subsidiaries Madison Square Garden, Roosevelt Raceway, Capitol Life Insurance Company, and Providence Washington Insurance Company) formed Richfield Holdings Ltd., an investment group that purchased Providence Capitol International Insurance Ltd. and Famous Players Realty Ltd. from Gulf and Western for $350 million. Gaston resigned from Gulf and Western once the sale was completed. Also in 1982, Gulf and Western sold its Marquette Cement Manufacturing Company subsidiary (acquired in 1976) to Lone Star Industries and Pennsylvania Malleable Iron (acquired in 1969) to Champ Corporation.

In 1983, Bluhdorn died of a heart attack on a plane en route home from the Dominican Republic to New York, and the board bypassed president Jim Judelson and named senior vice president Martin S. Davis, who had come up through Paramount Pictures, as the new chief executive officer.

In 1984, Gulf and Western purchased Esquire Inc. (and by extension the Globe Book Company, Allyn &amp; Bacon, Modern Curriculum Press and the Cambridge Company), in which it already owned a minority stake, and Prentice Hall. That same year, its Kayser-Roth subsidiary acquired the women’s underwear division of Calvin Klein Industries and the use of the designer’s name for that business.

=== Martin S. Davis restructuring ===
Davis slimmed down the company&#x27;s wilder diversifications and focused it on entertainment, selling all of its non-entertainment and publishing assets. The idea was to aid financial markets in measuring the company&#x27;s success, which, in turn, would help place better value on its shares. Though its Paramount division had done very well in recent years, Gulf and Western&#x27;s success as a whole was translating poorly with investors. This process eventually led Davis to divest many of the company&#x27;s subsidiaries.

In 1983, Gulf and Western sold Consolidated Cigar to a purchasing group composed by five of its senior managers and headed by its president, Alexander N. Brainard. That same year, Gulf and Western sold its building products operations (Livingston-Graham, Symons Corporation and Richmond Screw Anchor Company) to Merrill L. Nash, E. W. Bliss to a group of investors, and the U.S. assets of Sega (manufacturing division of Sega Electronics, Inc., along with licenses to technology and distribution rights to arcade game library of Sega in the United States for two years) to pinball manufacturer Bally Manufacturing. The Japanese assets of Sega (Sega Enterprises, Ltd., Sega trademarks, and its library of games) were purchased by a group of investors led by David Rosen and Hayao Nakayama the year after. Gulf and Western subsequently folded the former Sega U.S. companies (the old Sega Enterprises, Inc. and Sega Electronics, Inc. were renamed and currently exist as shell companies Ages Entertainment Software LLC and Ages Electronics, Inc., part of CBS Media Ventures) into Simon &amp; Schuster and the old Sega Europe Limited into Paramount Pictures (since renamed several times and currently exist as High Command Productions Limited, part of Viacom International). Ironically, a couple decades later Paramount and Sega would team up to co-produce a film series based on the latter&#x27;s flagship video game franchise, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;.

In 1984, Gulf and Western divested itself of its many Taylor Forge operations to private owners. Taylor Forge&#x27;s Somerville, New Jersey plant became Taylor Forge Stainless, while its facilities in Paola, Kansas and Greeley, Kansas became Taylor Forge Engineered Systems. That same year, Bonney Forge was sold to its president John Leone, Super Tool and Morse Cutting Tools to industrialist Jim Lambert, and Gulf and Western&#x27;s holdings in Florida and the Dominican Republic to an investment group including Carlos Morales Troncoso and the Fanjul brothers.

In 1985, Gulf and Western Consumer and Industrial Products Group – consisting of A.P.S. auto parts, Kayser-Roth clothing and Simmons bedding – was sold to the Wickes Companies. Also that year, it sold its Columbus Circle Investors unit (which acted as the asset manager for the company&#x27;s pension and employee benefit plans) to Thomson McKinnon and bought Ginn &amp; Company from Xerox.

In 1986, as part of its new corporate strategy to focus on the entertainment and publishing industries, Gulf and Western acquired Mann Theatres (Warner Communications was later brought in as a partner). Also that year, Simon &amp; Schuster acquired Silver Burdett and its GLC (General Learning Corporation) subsidiary. This acquisition was followed by mapmaker Gousha in 1987, and Charles E. Simon and Quercus in 1988. The company, thus restructured, renamed itself Paramount Communications in 1989, and sold Associates First Capital Corporation to the Ford Motor Company.

=== Headquarters ===
Prior to 1970, the company&#x27;s headquarters were on Madison Avenue in Manhattan.

The Gulf and Western Building (15 Columbus Circle in Manhattan) by Thomas Stanley was built in 1970 for the Gulf and Western company north of Columbus Circle, at the south-western corner of Central Park. The building occupies a narrow block between Broadway and Central Park West and, at , it commands the dramatic view to the north, as well as its immediate surroundings.

The top of the building sported a restaurant, The Top of the Park, which was never a full success even though run by Stuart Levin, famous for the Four Seasons, Le Pavillon, and other &quot;shrines of haute cuisine,&quot; and it being graced with Levin&#x27;s own elegant signature sculpture by Jim Gary, &quot;Universal Woman.&quot;

Similarly, the cinema space in the basement, named Paramount after the picture company that Gulf and Western owned, was closed as the building was sold.

Problems with the 45-story building&#x27;s structural frame gave it unwanted fame as its base was scaffolded for years and the upper floors were prone to sway excessively on windy days, even leading to cases of nausea akin to motion sickness.

The 1997 renovation into a hotel and residential building, the Trump International Hotel and Tower (One Central Park West) by Costas Kondylis and Philip Johnson, involved extensive renovation of both interior and facades. For example, the 45 stories of the original office tower were converted into a 52-story residential building, enabled by the lower ceiling height of residential spaces. The facade was converted with the addition of dark glass walls with distinctive shiny steel framing.

<text>Coca-Cola Vanilla (commonly referred to as Vanilla Coke) is a vanilla-flavored version of Coca-Cola, introduced in 2002 but subsequently discontinued in North America and the United Kingdom in 2005, though it remained available at certain fountain outlets. It was relaunched in the US in 2007, in Denmark in 2012, the UK in 2013 and Canada in 2016. Vanilla Coke has been available in Australia since its initial introduction in 2002, being produced by Coca-Cola Europacific Partners. Originally announced as a limited edition in the UK, it became permanent for several years; however, Vanilla Coke was again discontinued in the UK in Summer 2018, though Diet Vanilla Coke and Coke Vanilla Zero remain available.

In 2003, Pepsi introduced Pepsi Vanilla to compete with Vanilla Coke. In 2002, Virgin released their own vanilla cola in the UK, prior to the appearance of Vanilla Coke.

== Development ==
Original Coca-Cola already contains small amounts of vanilla. The history of adding additional vanilla flavoring to Coca-Cola, at least in the US, dates back at least to the 1940s when local soda fountain workers (soda jerks) would upon request add a &quot;shot&quot; (roughly two tablespoons) of vanilla syrup to a (12-16 oz) Coca-Cola fountain soda. For decades, this remained common practice in ice cream shops where vanilla syrup and Coca-Cola were both available. The Coca-Cola Company first tested a Coca-Cola blend with extra vanilla flavoring at the 1982 World&#x27;s Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee, along with Cherry Coke. After the introduction of Cherry Coke and the failure of New Coke in 1985, the company was hesitant to introduce anything radically new. It was not until April, 2002 that rumors began to circulate that the company was planning a new variation to their classic soft drink. The Coca-Cola Company was tight-lipped regarding the details of the new beverage, commenting to a London based newspaper, &quot;We&#x27;ve always got a number of things in development,&quot; leaving open speculation for what was to develop. It was later revealed that testing for a vanilla flavor had been completed and that the new beverage would be available in months. However, in late April, 2002, the company announced that Vanilla Coke would begin production as early as May.

== Marketing campaign ==
The marketing campaign for Vanilla Coke aimed to appeal across all generations. Yolanda Ball, brand manager for Coca-Cola Classic, said, &quot;We had to learn how to balance the newness of vanilla with the established qualities of Coca-Cola&quot;. Vanilla Coke debuted at the Vanilla Bean Café, locally known as &quot;the Bean,&quot; in Pomfret, Connecticut. The diet variety would be directed primarily at women. The first public tasting of Vanilla Coke took place in the Buckhead district of Atlanta at the Three Dollar Cafe with Atlanta radio station Q100 and their morning hosts from The Bert Show.

One of the first notable advertisements was a television ad created by The Martin Agency which was based upon the product&#x27;s original campaign line of &quot;Reward Your Curiosity&quot;. The ad featured actor Chazz Palminteri, in which he and another man pull a teenager (played by a young Aaron Paul) into an alley after catching him peering into a hole. Palminteri gives the boy a Vanilla Coke, as a reward for his curiosity. Their former website rewardyourcuriosity.com went along with the campaign and drew a large interest at the time. (In the Philippine version of the ad, Palminteri&#x27;s role was taken by actor Johnny Delgado.) Ms. Ball described the ad: &quot;We were trying to create something new and intriguing. Half of it was about new, different and change of pace, and the rest of it was about how people love and trust Coca-Cola. But we didn&#x27;t have to say &quot;New from Coca-Cola&quot;. We didn&#x27;t have to hit them over the head with it.&quot;

== Distribution ==
The Coca-Cola Company announced in 2002 that Vanilla Coke would be introduced initially in the United States with distribution starting May 15, followed by a rollout in Canada. The introduction of vanilla flavor was hailed by The Coca-Cola Company as &quot;the greatest innovation since Diet Coke in 1983&quot;. It also marked the 116th anniversary of the Coca-Cola Company. Later that year, it was introduced to the Norwegian, Swedish, and Icelandic markets of Europe. This was the first Coca-Cola variety introduced in Norway since Coca-Cola itself in 1937 and Coca-Cola Light in 1983. , Vanilla Coke was marketed in several European countries as well as Australia and New Zealand (in mid-to-late-2002). By late 2003, the company had marketed Vanilla Coke in over 30 countries around the globe. During the 2016 Summer Olympics the vanilla and cherry version was presented to selected markets in Brazil. Today, It can easily be distributed using a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine, which injects vanilla syrup into Coca-Cola

=== Reception and discontinuation===
Its inaugural year in 2002 saw its best sales. It is estimated that the product was purchased by about 29% of all United States households that year. It still remains popular along with its flavored partner, Cherry Coca-Cola. Doubt was cast over the future of Vanilla Coke and its splinter beverages when the company announced the 2004 sales figures: 35 million unit cases in North America compared to 90 million in 2002; Vanilla Diet Coke dropped from 23 million unit cases in its inaugural year (2003) to 13 million in 2004.
In November 2005, after slumping sales, The Coca-Cola Company announced that Vanilla Coke would be discontinued in North America and Great Britain by the end of the year. Coca-Cola introduced Black Cherry Vanilla Coke and Diet Black Cherry Vanilla Coke in North America in January 2006. At the time, the company said Vanilla Coke and Diet Vanilla Coke would possibly be made available again in the future: &quot;We are exploring ways to bring them back at another time, but right now Diet Black Cherry Vanilla Coke and Black Cherry Vanilla Coke are what consumers are telling us they want.&quot; Vanilla Coke beverages were never discontinued in some markets, such as Australia, France, Russia, Malaysia, and Germany.

From February 19, 2007, Vanilla Coke was re-introduced into New Zealand. The official re-introduction of Vanilla Coke in the US began May 25, 2007 at the World of Coca-Cola Museum in Atlanta, Georgia. The Coca-Cola Company announced a partnership with Edy&#x27;s Ice Cream to co-advertise with Coke on the launch, and featured a 10-ton Vanilla Coke float, which was certified by the Guinness World Records as the largest ice cream float in the world. A Coca-Cola Vanilla Zero has also been introduced. The re-released Coca-Cola Vanilla features a new packaging design. The advertising campaign for the revival used an instrumental cover of &quot;Welcome Back&quot;. In 2007, Vanilla Coke was also introduced into China. It was also introduced in other countries in Europe and Asia. In June 2010, certain convenience stores in Ontario, Canada have re-introduced it by importing it from the neighbouring United States. Coca-Cola has made Coke Vanilla available in their Freestyle beverage machine in Canada; however, bottled and canned versions were not available until 2016.
Coca-Cola initially stated that it had no plans to return Coca-Cola Vanilla to the United Kingdom despite high demand. Several inquiries were made throughout 2011 and 2012. Coca-Cola then thought about returning Vanilla Coca-Cola to the United Kingdom sooner or later. It was reintroduced on March as part of a Papa John&#x27;s promotional campaign before becoming available elsewhere. In April 2017, Vanilla Zero Sugar was made available in the UK. In May 2013, Coca-Cola Vanilla appeared in stores in Romania (imported), expanding to more stores through the year due to demand, without an official announcement from Coca-Cola. In July 2013, the drink re-appeared in stores around Belgium and the Netherlands as well. In October 2013, Coca-Cola Vanilla appeared in stores in Czech Republic and Slovakia. In February 2015, it appeared in some Tesco stores in Poland, where it is also available in Carrefour shops. It can also be purchased in many shops in Canada, and is widely available in Sweden, and also in some stores in Finland. In July 2018, Coca-Cola Vanilla re-appeared in Russia as limited edition in Magnit supermarkets, but due to high sales, it became available in all retail chains as a permanent product. In 2018, Coca-Cola confirmed the product&#x27;s discontinuation in the UK in favour of Vanilla Zero Sugar.

Coca-Cola Vanilla was introduced in Lithuania by the end of 2015 for a limited time.

=== Packaging ===
Vanilla Coke was packaged in standard bottles in accordance with appropriate Coca-Cola packaging. For a brief period of time in mid-2003, the bottles that Vanilla Coke came in, which had before said &quot;Vanilla Coke&quot;, were changed simply to &quot;V&quot; (which matched Cherry Coke&#x27;s new labeling showing a picture of a cherry).

As part of Coca-Cola&#x27;s ongoing &quot;One Brand&quot; marketing campaign, a new U.S. packaging design for Coca-Cola Vanilla was introduced in January 2019. The new packaging follows the design principles already employed in the United States for Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, and Coca-Cola Life. The word &quot;Coca-Cola&quot; is superimposed upon a red disc with a light beige drop (representing a drop of vanilla syrup) below the text. The background color of the can or bottle is light beige in color. The word &quot;Vanilla&quot; is placed above the red disc, similar to the &quot;Original Taste&quot; text currently used on cans and bottles of original Coca-Cola.

=== Varieties ===

* Coca-Cola Vanilla (2002–05; 2007–present)

In some countries, including Australia and New Zealand, a similar drink is marketed as &quot;Diet Coke with Vanilla&quot; and in others is known as Coca-Cola light Vanilla (or Vanilla Coke Light) In 2005, the sugar-free product in the United States and Canada became &quot;Diet Coke Vanilla,&quot; with more emphasis on the Diet Coke label. All varieties were discontinued in 2005 in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Both varieties are still available in Australia and Hong Kong. Coca-Cola Vanille (translation) is also available in France and Germany. A new Coke Vanilla Zero was introduced in 2007, along with regular Vanilla. Only these two are available in the United States.

<doc id="297577" wikidata="Q272260" url="?curid=297577" title="Behemoth (band)">
<text>Behemoth is a Polish blackened death metal band from Gdańsk, formed in 1991. They are considered to have played an important role in establishing the Polish extreme metal underground.

==History==

===Early career and first five albums (1991–2000)===
Behemoth was formed in 1991 as a trio, with Nergal on lead guitar and vocals, Baal on drums, and Desecrator on rhythm guitar. They started with the demos &quot;Endless Damnation&quot;, and &quot;The Return of the Northern Moon&quot;. The most significant however, was the fourth demo—&quot;...From the Pagan Vastlands&quot; (1994). This tape was released by Polish label Pagan Records, and later on through Wild Rags. Their next release was &quot;Sventevith (Storming Near the Baltic)&quot; in 1995. A year later, they recorded their second album &quot;Grom&quot;, which was released in 1996. &quot;Grom&quot; features many different influences and musical styles, using female vocals as well as acoustic guitars and synthesizers. At the same time, Behemoth finally got a chance to play live shows in its native country and finally tour around Europe, gaining stage experience. Two years later, the band recorded a third album, titled &quot;Pandemonic Incantations&quot;. The culmination of their increasing presence and metal media set a new standard for them. However, due to a lack of promotion, the album was not well publicized. After another extensive tour, Behemoth signed a two-album deal with Italy&#x27;s Avantgarde Music in the fall of 1998. The first result of this new collaboration was the successful album &quot;Satanica&quot;, on which the black metal sound had evolved into blackened death metal.

The label also secured two European tours for the band in support of Deicide and Satyricon respectively. During that period, Behemoth had to go through some line-up changes and had problems with their ex-Polish label. By the time &quot;Satanica&quot; came out, Inferno and Les were out of the band. Nergal began looking for new members but could not find a new drummer. Inferno returned to the band in early 2000, along with new members Novy (formerly known from Devilyn, Vader and Dies Irae), who handled the bass duties, and Havok, who became the band&#x27;s guitarist. After the line-up changes Behemoth signed with the Polish label Mystic Production. The follow-up release to &quot;Satanica&quot; was &quot;Thelema.6&quot;. Massive guitar parts and precise drumming, with influences from different sources, saw them progress further towards blackened death metal.

&quot;Thelema.6&quot; was supported by the worldwide press and media, including official releases in Russia and Brazil for the first time. Continuing the support for &quot;Thelema.6&quot;, Behemoth appeared in several prestigious live events like Wacken Open Air, With Full Force, Inferno Metal Festival, Mystic Festival, and Mind Over Matter Autumn. They started their first headlining tour alongside Carpathian Forest and Khold, followed by a festival tour in Poland (Thrash em All Fest. with Vader and Krisiun, among others).

===&quot;Zos Kia Cultus (Here and Beyond)&quot;, &quot;Demigod&quot; and &quot;The Apostasy&quot; (2001–2008)===

In 2001, Behemoth focused on writing new material for a sixth studio album. Meantime, they completed their second headlining tour in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Having completed the recording of their new songs, Behemoth entered Hendrix Studio for the second time, with help of their friend and sound engineer Arkadiusz Malczewski, and produced &quot;Zos Kia Cultus (Here and Beyond)&quot;.

In February 2003, the band started their first tour in Norway, playing in cities such as Bergen, Oslo and Stavanger. On 11 March 2003, the American premiere, scheduled by Century Media Records, headlined Behemoth&#x27;s first appearance in the American continent. The tour started on 9 March at the New Jersey&#x27;s Metalfest and continued with a decent number of shows across America and Canada, with the company of Deicide, Revenge, Vehemence and Amon Amarth. Shortly after doing their first US tour the band was invited to join the Blackest of the Black Tour by Glenn Danzig. The already legendary festival included acts like Danzig, Superjoint Ritual, Nile, and Opeth. In fall 2003, Behemoth flew to the US to complete their third tour with Six Feet Under, Skinless and The Black Dahlia Murder. The band then played at the Tuska Festival in Finland with Ministry, Soulfly, among others. At that time, due to some line up difficulties, Nergal parted his ways with Havok and Novy, who decided to focus on activities with their own bands. Eventually, the band resumed touring in the UK and Europe.

In 2004, their seventh studio album, &quot;Demigod&quot;, was released to good critical response. Recorded at the Hendrix Studios, the album debuted at number 15 on the national Polish album charts. Music videos for the songs &quot;Conquer All&quot; and &quot;Slaves Shall Serve&quot; were also shot. In fall 2005, the band headlined the Demigod supremacy Canadian tour 2005 with Necronomicon.

In 2007, the band toured Europe alongside Napalm Death, Moonspell and Dew-Scented. Behemoth released their eighth studio album &quot;The Apostasy&quot; in July of that year. It was recorded at Radio Gdańsk studio in December 2006. Shortly after the release of &quot;The Apostasy&quot;, the band was featured as one of Ozzfest 2007&#x27;s second stage headliners, one of the four non-US bands playing that year. In October/November 2007, they played their first US headlining tour alongside Job for a Cowboy, Gojira, and Beneath the Massacre. In October/November 2007 the band toured Europe alongside Canadian death metal combo Kataklysm and Belgium&#x27;s Aborted.

In February 2008, Behemoth began a headlining tour along with Suicide Silence. In April/May 2008 the band toured North America as part of &quot;The Invaluable Darkness&quot; tour with Keep of Kalessin and headliner Dimmu Borgir. Behemoth spent the summer playing a number of prominent festivals all over Europe.

In October 2008, Behemoth released their first live album, &quot;At the Arena ov Aion – Live Apostasy&quot;. Also, an EP called &quot;Ezkaton&quot; was released featuring a re-recorded version of &quot;Chant for Eschaton 2000&quot;, one new song, two covers (Master&#x27;s Hammer, together with Root members Igor Hubik and Big Boss, and Ramones), and three live songs. The EP has been released in North America on 11 November.

===&quot;Evangelion&quot; (2009–2010)===

In March 2009, the band suggested that the new album, due in the summer, be produced by British producer Colin Richardson. Behemoth released its 9th full-length album entitled &quot;Evangelion&quot; on 9 August via Nuclear Blast in Europe and 11 August via Metal Blade in US. &quot;Shemhamforash&quot;, a track from this album, was released in July 2009 on their MySpace profile.

In July and August 2009, Behemoth participated in the Rockstar Mayhem Festival alongside a variety of metal bands such as Slayer, Bullet for My Valentine, All That Remains, Trivium, Marilyn Manson, Cannibal Corpse and Job for a Cowboy. In September 2009 Behemoth headlined the &quot;New Evangelion&quot; Polish tour alongside Azarath, Black River and Hermh.

In January 2010, Behemoth toured North America during &quot;Evangelia Amerika Tour&quot;. In March they toured Europe with shows in Scandinavia, Greece and Turkey. In April, Behemoth toured Japan, Australia and New Zealand. In May they started European &quot;Evangelion Summer Campaign 2010&quot; with shows on open-air festivals in Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Sweden, Denmark and Poland. In June and July they toured France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, Turkey, Serbia and Croatia with Decapitated and Ex Deo. In July and August they performed on next open-air festivals, in Czech Republic and Poland.

===Nergal&#x27;s illness, recovery and &quot;The Satanist&quot; (2010–2016)===
In August 2010, Nergal was rushed to a hospital and was diagnosed with leukemia. It was reported that his leukemia was so advanced that chemotherapy couldn&#x27;t help him; however, that has been proven false. Doda, his girlfriend at that time, offered her bone marrow for a transplant but tests showed she wasn&#x27;t a match. A donor was subsequently found. Behemoth was forced to cancel all upcoming shows in August, including the Sonisphere Festival in Finland, concerts in Russia, Belarus and Baltic States in September and October, and their North American tour &quot;Lawless States of Heretika&quot; with Watain, Withered and Black Anvil in November and December.

Behemoth&#x27;s live DVD &quot;Evangelia Heretika&quot; was released on 9 November 2010. The DVD package includes two DVDs featuring Live in Warsaw 2009, Live in Paris 2008, Documentaries, Bonus Material and an Audio CD.

On 17 January 2011, Nergal left the hematology division of Uniwersyteckie Centrum Kliniczne, four weeks after he underwent a bone marrow transplant procedure. He said that he would take several months of recovery while living in his flat in one of the Gdańsk&#x27;s districts in order to restore his physical condition. He also announced that he was eager to resume playing the guitar again, its having been six months since he last played. He also said that he had a huge motivation and desire to continue his work with the band, thanking all people who helped him.
According to Nergal, a new album and tour for 2012 were both in the works.

In an April 18, 2012 interview with Blabbermouth, Nergal stated that the new album&#x27;s possible release date to be in the middle of 2013, and also stated that &quot;But, I can tell you that there are at least three or four rough sketches of songs, just ideas. Main riffs, main themes. We will be building around these ideas, so about one-third of the album is underway.&quot;

The band was slated to play the 2013 Mayhem Festival, alongside Amon Amarth, Rob Zombie, Mastodon, Children of Bodom and others, but cancelled due to drummer Inferno taking ill and needing appendix surgery.

On May 30, 2013, Behemoth announced that the title of their tenth studio album would be &quot;The Satanist&quot;; it was released on 3 February 2014 and received widespread acclaim by both critics and audiences. On 26 February 2014 the band was announced to be playing Download Festival in June. On 27 July 2014 Behemoth performed live on Carpathian Alliance Open Air Metal Festival in Ukraine as a headliner. Behemoth have also scheduled a North American tour to take place in early 2015, co-headlining with Cannibal Corpse with support from Aeon and Tribulation.

On August 9, 2015, Behemoth were announced as the special guests at Bloodstock Open Air in 2016, playing &quot;The Satanist&quot; in its entirety on Friday, 12 August 2016.

Due to Inferno becoming a father in July 2017, Jon &quot;the Charn&quot; Rice replaced him on drums at the American summer tour with Slayer and Lamb of God.

===&quot;I Loved You at Your Darkest&quot;, &quot;Opvs Contra Natvram&quot; and &quot;The Shit ov God&quot; (2016–present)===

In 2016, the band announced that they would start working on the follow-up to &quot;The Satanist&quot;. In early 2017, Nergal started posting clips of riffs on his Instagram account. He also revealed that the band would release a new &quot;live DVD&quot;, recorded in Warsaw, later that year. In a May 2017 interview, Nergal said that the band had &quot;ten or thirteen, already, sketches of new songs&quot; for the new album, with an estimated release date in the fall of 2018. The band entered the studio in November 2017 to record their eleventh studio album.

In January 2018, Behemoth was announced as one of the supporting acts for Slayer&#x27;s final world tour. On 13 April, the live DVD &quot;Messe Noire&quot; was released as a conclusion to The Satanist touring cycle. A new single titled &quot;God = Dog&quot; was released on 2 August from the eleventh album &quot;I Loved You at Your Darkest&quot;, which was released on 5 October. In support of the album, the band embarked on a North American Tour on 20 October.

In August 2019, the band was announced as the support act for Slipknot&#x27;s 2020 European tour. 

In March 2021, Nergal announced that the band was preparing a new album to celebrate their 30th anniversary. The twelfth studio album &quot;Opvs Contra Natvram&quot; was announced on 11 May 2022, set to be released on 16 September. A music video of the first single titled &quot;Ov My Herculean Exile&quot; was made available for streaming that day.

In December 2023, Nergal reported that new music from Behemoth was in the works. On 29 January 2025, the band released &quot;The Shit ov God&quot; as the lead single and title track to their upcoming thirteenth studio album, due for release on 9 May.

== Musical style and lyrics ==
Until the late 1990s, the band played a traditional black metal style with secular lyrical content, but changed to that of occult, Nordic paganism and thelemic themes written by their lead vocalist Nergal and Krzysztof Azarewicz. With the 1999 release of &quot;Satanica&quot;, the band demonstrated their presence in the death metal scene, while retaining their own signature style characterized by the drum work of Inferno and multi-layered vocals. Despite Behemoth having been labeled as death metal or thrash metal-influenced, Nergal has mentioned that he does not like the band to be labeled as such. Later themes explored by the band include anti-Christianity and Satanism. According to Phoenix New Times, who named Behemoth one of the &quot;most Satanic metal bands of all time&quot;, assessed that the band &quot;merges the mysticism and image of black metal with the force, precision and brutality of death metal.&quot; 

==Controversy==
In July 2007, the All-Polish Committee for Defense Against Sects distributed to many Polish officials a list of bands that allegedly promote Satanism and murder. Critics of this policy primarily see this as a violation of free speech. The list has not gone into effect, and Behemoth were allowed to play in Poland freely. In October 2014 this changed when Behemoth was banned from performing in Poznań.

Nergal has repeatedly been on trial in Poland for tearing up the Bible in a 2007 incident.

In May 2014, Russia expelled Behemoth for four to five years because of visa issues.

<text>The flag of Serbia (), also known as the Tricolour (), is a tricolour consisting of three equal horizontal bands, red on the top, blue in the middle, and white on the bottom (on civil flag), with the lesser coat of arms left of center (on state flag). The same tricolour, in altering variations, has been used since the 19th century as the flag of the state of Serbia and the Serb people. The current form of the flag was adopted in 2004 and slightly redesigned in 2010.

==History==
===Medieval flags===

The son of King Stefan Vladislav (reigned 1233–1243), &quot;župan&quot; Desa, sent delegates from Kotor to Dubrovnik to bring back part of the king&#x27;s treasury held at Ragusa, which they did on 3 July 1281; the inventory list included, among other things, &quot;a flag of red and blue color&quot;. It is described as &quot;vexillum unum de zendato rubeo et blavo&quot;—&quot;a flag of fabric red and blue&quot;; &quot;zendato&quot; () being a type of light, silky fabric. This is the oldest known attestation of colours of a Serbian flag; the oldest known Serbian flag was red and blue. But already in 1271 the flag colors of župan Desa were red and white. Although the color order is not known, the version with horizontal red and blue is sometimes used in medieval-themed events in modern Serbia.

Hungarian King Bela IV mentioned in his charter dated 8 April 1268, that his army had defeated King Stefan Uroš I (reigned 1243–1276), and that when he hosted some foreign rulers, his magnates brought captured Serbs and &quot;in the sign of triumph, the flag of King Uroš before the court of Bela IV, and erected it there&quot;.

In 1326, king Stefan Dečanski sent a delegate to the Mamluk Sultanate in Alexandria and sought a flag in yellow colour, to be used as a war flag. The Byzantines mention that there were several war flags hoisted by the Serbs at the Battle of Velbazhd (1330), and the yellow one was likely one of those.

The oldest known drawing of a Serbian flag is from the 1339 map made by Angelino Dulcert; Serbia, at the time ruled by King Stefan Dušan, is represented by a white flag of a red double-headed eagle placed above the capital Skopje (&quot;Scopi&quot;). Stefan Dušan was crowned Emperor in 1346; Dušan also adopted the Byzantine &quot;tetragramme&quot; with four fire-steels, which afterwards became an element of the Serbian flag until today (the Serbian cross). A flag in Hilandar, seen by Dimitrije Avramović, was alleged by the brotherhood to have been a flag of Emperor Dušan; it was a triband of red at the top and bottom and white in the centre. Emperor Dušan also adopted the Imperial &quot;divelion&quot;, which was purple and had a golden cross in the centre. Another of Dušan&#x27;s flags was the Imperial cavalry flag, kept at the Hilandar monastery on Mount Athos; a triangular bicolor flag, of red and yellow.

===Revolutionary flags===

During the First Serbian Uprising, various flags were used. Among the early flags, the one described by Mateja Nenadović could be connected with today&#x27;s flag and the first Serbian flag: it was red-blue-red with three white crosses. Similar flags bearing only one Serbian cross could also be found. Regular armies of the uprising usually had light yellow flags with various symbols, while voivode flags were often red-white, and with a superimposed black two-headed eagle. There were also flags of other colors, including red-yellow, red-white-blue and red-blue. This variety of colors was followed by variety of symbols on the flags, most often taken from Hristofor Zhefarovich&#x27;s book &quot;Stemmatographia&quot; of 1741. The most common symbol on the flags were the Serbian cross, followed by coat of arms of the Timok Valley (Tribalia) and various other crosses. Most of the flags were made in Sremski Karlovci, designed by Serbian painters Stefan Gavrilović, Ilija Gavrilović and Nikola Apostolović. These would carry over to the Second Serbian Uprising as well, alongside its own flags, the most well known of which being the Takovo flag, a white flag with a large red Greek cross in the center.
===Modern flags===
The 1835 Sretenje Constitution described the colors of the Serbian flag as bright red, white and &quot;čelikasto-ugasita&quot; (that could be translated as &quot;steelish-dark&quot;). The constitution was criticized, especially by Russia, and the flag was specifically singled out as being similar to the revolutionary flag of France. Soon afterwards, Miloš Obrenović was requesting to the Porte that the new constitution should contain an article about the flag and coat of arms, and subsequent ferman allowed Serbs to use their own maritime flag, which will have &quot;upper part of red, middle of blue, and lower of white&quot;, which is the first appearance of the colors that are used today.

The colors of the current flag of Serbia are based on the symbolism of those of the flag of Russia since 1835, but these colors are the reverse of those on the flag of Russia, and various popular stories exist in Serbia which seek to explain why. An example:

Serbia used the red, blue and white tricolor as a national flag continuously from 1835 until 1918, when Serbia ceased to be a sovereign state after it joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later known as Yugoslavia, the tricolor was a used as a Serbian civil flag, from 1918 to 1945. Also in 1918, a Serbian flag was flown over the White House in Washington, D.C. as a show of solidarity by the U.S. towards Serbia during World War I.
After World War II, Yugoslavia was reformed into a socialist federal republic, composed of six republics, one of which was Serbia. Each republic was entitled to its own flag on the condition that it contained the socialist red star. The standardization of the flags of the Yugoslav Republics meant that the flag of SR Serbia was identical to that of SR Montenegro, as they continued the use of the tricolours of the Kingdom of Serbia and the Kingdom of Montenegro respectively. Following the breakup of Yugoslavia, Serbia initially continued using the flag of Serbia as a Yugoslav republic; the 1990 Constitution of Serbia stated that flag and coat of arms of Serbia can only be changed by the same procedure used to change the constitution itself, which required an absolute majority of voters to support it. The 1992 Serbian constitutional referendum asked the voters to choose between the flag with and without the star, with red star gaining the majority of votes, however not the absolute majority of voters. The red star was nonetheless removed from the flag in 1992 by a recommendation by the Serbian parliament; however, the coat of arms remained unchanged. In 2004, however, the National Assembly of Serbia issued a recommendation on use of the flag and coat of arms that preferred using different symbols from the ones in the constitution. The 2006 Constitution of Serbia sanctioned that national symbols would be regulated by law; the recommendation remained in use until 2009, when the actual Law on National Symbols was enacted. On 11 November 2010, a visual redesign of the coat of arms was enacted, which is currently used on the state flag.

The state flag of Serbia is also popular with Serbs in the Republika Srpska, who usually prefer to fly it instead of the national flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==Design==
The state flag bears the lesser coat of arms, centred vertically and shifted to the hoist side by one-seventh of the flag&#x27;s length. The flag ratio is 2 to 3 (height/width), with three equal horizontal bands of red, blue and white, each taking one third of the height. Recommended colors (white and black are not documented in Pantone) are: The colors have no officially-designated meaning, but traditionally red is taken to represent wartime bloodshed, blue freedom, and white mother&#x27;s breastmilk.
 Only used on the greater arms&#x27; ermine mantling, as seen on the presidential standards.

==Flag protocol==

The state flag (de facto national flag) is constantly flown on the entrances of state buildings. The National Assembly flies it only when in session and during national holidays. Institutions of provinces, Vojvodina and Kosovo and Metohija, fly it only on national holidays. It can also be flown during celebrations and other solemn manifestations which mark events of importance for Serbia, and on other occasions. During state mourning, it is flown at half mast, including by the organs of provinces, local organs, and public services. The flag must be displayed in an election room during an election for state bodies and in the room of civil registry dedicated for marriage (the officiant has to carry a sash with flag colours as well).

The civil flag of Serbia is constantly flown on the entrance of the National Assembly and organs of provinces and public services. It must be displayed in an election room during an election for provincial or local organs. Also, it can be hoisted during celebrations and other cultural or sport manifestations, and on other occasions.

Neither the state flag nor the civil flag can be hoisted so that they touch the ground, nor be used as rests, tablecloths, carpets or curtains, nor to cover vehicles or other objects, nor to attire speaker platforms or tables, except as table flags. They must not be used if damaged or otherwise look unsuitable for use. The flag is not flown in bad weather conditions. Also, it is flown only in daylight, unless it is illuminated.

If the flag is flown vertically on tables or otherwise, its top field is on the left side of the viewer. If it is flown vertically across a street or square, its top field should be on the northern side if the street has east–west orientation, and eastern side if it has north–south orientation or on a circular square.

The law defines how the flag of Serbia is displayed along with other flags, making no difference between state flags and other kinds of flags. If the flag is hoisted with another flag, it is always on the viewer&#x27;s left, except during an official visit of a representative of another country or an international organization, when the flag of the visitor is on the viewer&#x27;s left. If the flag is hoisted with another on crossed staffs, its staff must be the front one.

If the flag of Serbia is hoisted along with two flags, it must be in the middle.

If the flag is flown with multiple flags,
* If the flags are flown in a circle, it must be in the centre of the circle, clearly visible;
* If the flags are flown in a semicircle, it must be in its vertex;
* If the flags are flown in a column, it must be in the front of the column;
* If the flags are flown in a row, it must be in the first place, that is, on the viewer&#x27;s left;
* If the flags are flown in a group, it must be in the front of the group.

==Other official flags==
The President of the Republic and the President of the National Assembly use their respective standards. 
==Derived flags==

Montenegro used to have a flag inspired by the Serbian tricolor with varying shades of blue. It originated from Montenegrin national costume. During the socialist Yugoslavia, the republics of Serbia and Montenegro had flags of the same pattern and colors arrangement as the flag of Serbia. Montenegro changed its flag in 1993 by altering the proportion and shade of blue in its flag and used that flag until 2004.

The Serbian tricolor was also the basis for the breakaway territories of Republika Srpska and Republic of Serbian Krajina during the Yugoslav Wars. The flag of Republika Srpska is still the Serbian tricolor as well as flag of Serbs of Croatia.

<doc id="297588" wikidata="Q727574" url="?curid=297588" title="Georg Carl von Döbeln">
<text>Georg Carl von Döbeln (29 April 1758 – 16 February 1820) was a Swedish &quot;friherre&quot; (baron), Lieutenant general and above all known for his efforts on the Swedish side during the Finnish War.

== Early life ==
Georg Carl was born at the Stora Torpa manor in Segerstads parish in Västergötland (now Falköping Municipality) to district court judge (&quot;&quot;) Johan Jakob von Döbeln and Anna Maria Lindgren. He was also the great-grandson of professor and city physician Johan Jacob Döbelius. When von Döbeln was eight years old his father died and he was put in school by relatives with the aim of him becoming a priest. The boy however, showed affinity for a military life and he was enrolled at the Karlskrona naval academy in 1773. Upon graduating as an officer in 1775, he was directed by the family towards a career in law. Disliking this, he sought employment as a junior officer in 1778.

== Military career ==

As a lieutenant, Döbeln took part in Gustav III&#x27;s Russian War and was shot in the head at the Battle of Porrassalmi. The wound did not heal properly and he was forced to wear a black silken bandanna for the rest of his life. During the operation he stayed awake and wrote about it while looking at the whole process with the help of a mirror.

He then rapidly advanced to colonel and took part in the Finnish War. On 13 September 1808, he led the Swedish troops in the Battle of Jutas. For this, he would become legendary as the main hero of the war. His reputation was further enhanced when Johan Ludvig Runeberg wrote his epic &quot;Döbeln at Jutas&quot; in the Finnish National Poem &quot;Fänrik Ståls Sägner&quot; (in Swedish).

He successfully led the Swedish retreat from the Åland islands over the frozen Baltic Sea. Having re-organized his troops, he engaged Russian forces which ultimately stopped a planned attack on the Swedish capital, Stockholm.

Döbeln was the commanding officer of the North Army on 8 October 1809, when the last formal ties between Sweden and Finland were cut through the dismissal of the last Swedish-Finnish army in the church park of Umeå in Västerbotten North Sweden. Döbeln&#x27;s final orders to the parading army, issued verbally prior to dismissal, is considered to be the very essence of rhetoric in Swedish, and has been taught to generations of school-children.

In the War of the Sixth Coalition he commanded troops in Swedish Pomerania and led 15,000 troops to relieve Hamburg, which was besieged by the French, contrary to royal standing orders to not engage French forces unless possessing a three-to-one advantage, or to cross the Elbe River. Döbeln had received an urgent appeal from the citizens of Hamburg to protect them from the French, to which he gave his word that he would make an attempt to take the city. Despite a further written order from Swedish Crown Prince Charles John (formerly French Marshal Bernadotte), the commander-in-chief of the Swedish Army, Döbeln&#x27;s troops defeated the French masking force and occupied Hamburg on 21 May 1813. 

He and his forces would be forced to retreat a week later when the French XIII Corps, numbering 34,000 under the famed Marshal Davout, arrived to re-take Hamburg. For violating the Crown Prince&#x27;s repeated and explicit orders to not liberate Hamburg, Döbeln was court-martialled and sentenced to be executed. However, the execution order was countermanded by Charles John himself, who had Döbeln sequestered in Vaxholm Prison during the autumn of 1813.

While there, Döbeln wrote a letter to a relative, expressing the desire to be allowed to fight in the conflict, and serve out his sentence after the fighting concluded. The letter&#x27;s contents became known to the Crown Prince, whose Gascon romanticism was touched, and he fully pardoned Döbeln. The two remained on good terms until Döbeln&#x27;s death in 1820.

== Personal life ==

He was married to Kristina Karolina Ullström (they later divorced). The couple had one son, Napoleon (1802–1847). Although popular, having had a great career and after his death considered a war hero, von Döbeln lived his last years impoverished.

Döbelns Park in central Umeå in northern Sweden is the oldest park in Umeå. It came to be named after Döbeln when his monument was placed in the park in 1867. There is also a smaller park called &quot;Döbelns plan&quot; in the same city. A 1942 film was made about his 1813 campaign in North Germany.

<doc id="297595" wikidata="Q1504201" url="?curid=297595" title="Absolute threshold of hearing">
<text>The absolute threshold of hearing (ATH), also known as the absolute hearing threshold or auditory threshold, is the minimum sound level of a pure tone that an average human ear with normal hearing can hear with no other sound present. The absolute threshold relates to the sound that can just be heard by the organism. The absolute threshold is not a discrete point and is therefore classed as the point at which a sound elicits a response a specified percentage of the time.

The threshold of hearing is generally reported in reference to the RMS sound pressure of 20 micropascals, i.e. 0 dB SPL, corresponding to a sound intensity of 0.98 pW/m2 at 1 atmosphere and 25 °C. It is approximately the quietest sound a young human with undamaged hearing can detect at 1 kHz. The threshold of hearing is frequency-dependent and it has been shown that the ear&#x27;s sensitivity is best at frequencies between 2 kHz and 5 kHz, where the threshold reaches as low as −9 dB SPL.
== Psychophysical methods for measuring thresholds ==

Measurement of the absolute hearing threshold provides some basic information about our auditory system. The tools used to collect such information are called psychophysical methods. Through these, the perception of a physical stimulus (sound) and our psychological response to the sound is measured.

Several psychophysical methods can measure absolute threshold. These vary, but certain aspects are identical. Firstly, the test defines the stimulus and specifies the manner in which the subject should respond. The test presents the sound to the listener and manipulates the stimulus level in a predetermined pattern. The absolute threshold is defined statistically, often as an average of all obtained hearing thresholds.

Some procedures use a series of trials, with each trial using the &#x27;single-interval &quot;yes&quot;/&quot;no&quot; paradigm&#x27;. This means that sound may be present or absent in the single interval, and the listener has to say whether they thought the stimulus was there. When the interval does not contain a stimulus, it is called a &quot;catch trial&quot;.

=== Classical methods ===
Classical methods date back to the 19th century and were first described by Gustav Theodor Fechner in his work &quot;Elements of Psychophysics&quot;. Three methods are traditionally used for testing a subject&#x27;s perception of a stimulus: the method of limits, the method of constant stimuli, and the method of adjustment.
; Method of limits: In the method of limits, the tester controls the level of the stimuli. Single-interval &quot;yes/no&quot; paradigm&#x27; is used, but there are no catch trials.

: The trial uses several series of descending and ascending runs.

: The trial starts with the descending run, where a stimulus is presented at a level well above the expected threshold. When the subject responds correctly to the stimulus, the level of intensity of the sound is decreased by a specific amount and presented again. The same pattern is repeated until the subject stops responding to the stimuli, at which point the descending run is finished.

: In the ascending run, which comes after, the stimulus is first presented well below the threshold and then gradually increased in two decibel (dB) steps until the subject responds. As there are no clear margins to &#x27;hearing&#x27; and &#x27;not hearing&#x27;, the threshold for each run is determined as the midpoint between the last audible and first inaudible level.

: The subject&#x27;s absolute hearing threshold is calculated as the mean of all obtained thresholds in both ascending and descending runs.

: There are several issues related to the method of limits. First is anticipation, which is caused by the subject&#x27;s awareness that the turn-points determine a change in response. Anticipation produces better ascending thresholds and worse descending thresholds.

: Habituation creates completely opposite effect, and occurs when the subject becomes accustomed to responding either &quot;yes&quot; in the descending runs and/or &quot;no&quot; in the ascending runs. For this reason, thresholds are raised in ascending runs and improved in descending runs.

: Another problem may be related to step size. Too large a step compromises accuracy of the measurement as the actual threshold may be just between two stimulus levels.

: Finally, since the tone is always present, &quot;yes&quot; is always the correct answer.

; Method of constant stimuli: In the method of constant stimuli, the tester sets the level of stimuli and presents them at completely random order. 

: Thus, there are no ascending or descending trials.

: The subject responds &quot;yes&quot;/&quot;no&quot; after each presentation.

: The stimuli are presented many times at each level and the threshold is defined as the stimulus level at which the subject scored 50% correct. &quot;Catch&quot; trials may be included in this method.

: Method of constant stimuli has several advantages over the method of limits. Firstly, the random order of stimuli means that the correct answer cannot be predicted by the listener. Secondarily, as the tone may be absent (catch trial), &quot;yes&quot; is not always the correct answer. Finally, catch trials help to detect the amount of a listener&#x27;s guessing.
: The main disadvantage lies in the large number of trials needed to obtain the data, and therefore time required to complete the test.

; Method of adjustment: Method of adjustment shares some features with the method of limits, but differs in others. There are descending and ascending runs and the listener knows that the stimulus is always present. 

: However, unlike in the method of limits, here the stimulus is controlled by the listener. The subject reduces the level of the tone until it cannot be detected anymore, or increases until it can be heard again.

: The stimulus level is varied continuously via a dial and the stimulus level is measured by the tester at the end. The threshold is the mean of the just audible and just inaudible levels.

: Also this method can produce several biases. To avoid giving cues about the actual stimulus level, the dial must be unlabeled. Apart from the already mentioned anticipation and habituation, stimulus persistence (preservation) could influence the result from the method of adjustment.

: In the descending runs, the subject may continue to reduce the level of the sound as if the sound was still audible, even though the stimulus is already well below the actual hearing threshold.

: In contrast, in the ascending runs, the subject may have persistence of the absence of the stimulus until the hearing threshold is passed by certain amount.

=== Modified classical methods ===
=== Forced-choice methods ===
Two intervals are presented to a listener, one with a tone and one without a tone. The listener must decide which interval had the tone in it. The number of intervals can be increased, but this may cause problems for the listener who has to remember which interval contained the tone.

=== Adaptive methods ===
Unlike the classical methods, where the pattern for changing the stimuli is preset, in adaptive methods the subject&#x27;s response to the previous stimuli determines the level at which a subsequent stimulus is presented.

==== Staircase (up-down) methods ====
The simple &quot;1-down-1-up method&quot; consists of a series of descending and ascending trial runs and turning points (reversals). The stimulus level is increased if the subject does not respond and decreased when a response occurs. Similar to the method of limits, the stimuli are adjusted in predetermined steps. After obtaining from six to eight reversals, the first one is discarded and the threshold is defined as the average of the midpoints of the remaining runs. Experiments have shown that this method provides only 50% accuracy. To produce more accurate results, this simple method can be further modified by increasing the size of steps in the descending runs, e.g. &quot;2-down-1-up method&quot;, &quot;3-down-1-up methods&quot;.

====Bekesy&#x27;s tracking method====
Bekesy&#x27;s method contains some aspects of classical methods and staircase methods. The level of the stimulus is automatically varied at a fixed rate. The subject is asked to press a button when the stimulus is detectable. Once the button is pressed, the level is automatically decreased by the motor-driven attenuator and increased when the button is not pushed. The threshold is thus tracked by the listeners, and calculated as the mean of the midpoints of the runs as recorded by the automat.

== Hysteresis effect ==
Hysteresis can be defined roughly as &#x27;the lagging of an effect behind its cause&#x27;.
When measuring hearing thresholds it is always easier for the subject to follow a tone that is audible and decreasing in amplitude than to detect a tone that was previously inaudible.

This is because &#x27;top-down&#x27; influences mean that the subject expects to hear the sound and is, therefore, more motivated with higher levels of concentration.

The &#x27;bottom-up&#x27; theory explains that unwanted external (from the environment) and internal (e.g., heartbeat) noise results in the subject only responding to the sound if the signal-to-noise ratio is above a certain point.

In practice this means that when measuring threshold with sounds decreasing in amplitude, the point at which the sound becomes inaudible is always lower than the point at which it returns to audibility. This phenomenon is known as the &#x27;hysteresis effect&#x27;.

== Psychometric function of absolute hearing threshold ==

Psychometric function &#x27;represents the probability of a certain listener&#x27;s response as a function of the magnitude of the particular sound characteristic being studied&#x27;.

To give an example, this could be the probability curve of the subject detecting a sound being presented as a function of the sound level. When the stimulus is presented to the listener one would expect that the sound would either be audible or inaudible, resulting in a &#x27;doorstep&#x27; function. In reality a grey area exists where the listener is uncertain as to whether they have actually heard the sound or not, so their responses are inconsistent, resulting in a psychometric function.

The psychometric function is a sigmoid function characterised by being &#x27;s&#x27; shaped in its graphical representation.

== Minimal audible field vs minimal audible pressure ==

Two methods can be used to measure the minimal audible stimulus and therefore the absolute threshold of hearing.
Minimal audible field involves the subject sitting in a sound field and stimulus being presented via a loudspeaker. The sound level is then measured at the position of the subject&#x27;s head with the subject not in the sound field.
Minimal audible pressure involves presenting stimuli via headphones or earphones and measuring sound pressure in the subject&#x27;s ear canal using a very small probe microphone.
The two different methods produce different thresholds and minimal audible field thresholds are often 6 to 10 dB better than minimal audible pressure thresholds. It is thought that this difference is due to:
* monaural vs binaural hearing. With minimal audible field both ears are able to detect the stimuli but with minimal audible pressure only one ear is able to detect the stimuli. Binaural hearing is more sensitive than monaural hearing/
* physiological noises heard when ear is occluded by an earphone during minimal audible pressure measurements. When the ear is covered the subject hears body noises, such as heart beat, and these may have a masking effect.
Minimal audible field and minimal audible pressure are important when considering calibration issues and they also illustrate that the human hearing is most sensitive in the 2–5 kHz range.

== Temporal summation ==

Temporal summation is the relationship between stimulus duration and intensity when the presentation time is less than 1 second. Auditory sensitivity changes when the duration of a sound becomes less than 1 second. The threshold intensity decreases by about 10 dB when the duration of a tone burst is increased from 20 to 200 ms.

For example, suppose that the quietest sound a subject can hear is 16 dB SPL if the sound is presented at a duration of 200 ms. If the same sound is then presented for a duration of only 20 ms, the quietest sound that can now be heard by the subject goes up to 26 dB SPL. In other words, if a signal is shortened by a factor of 10 then the level of that signal must be increased by as much as 10 dB to be heard by the subject.

The ear operates as an energy detector that samples the amount of energy present within a certain time frame. A certain amount of energy is needed within a time frame to reach the threshold. This can be done by using a higher intensity for less time or by using a lower intensity for more time. Sensitivity to sound improves as the signal duration increases up to about 200 to 300 ms, after that the threshold remains constant.

The timpani of the ear operates more as a sound pressure sensor. Also a microphone works the same way and is not sensitive to sound intensity.

<doc id="297602" wikidata="Q406991" url="?curid=297602" title="Pan-Slavic colors">
<text>The pan-Slavic colors—blue, white and red—were defined by the Prague Slavic Congress, 1848, based on the symbolism of the colors of the flag of Russia, which was introduced in the late 17th century. Historically, however, many Slavic nations and states had already adopted flags and other national symbols that used some combination of those three colors. Slavic countries that use or have used the colors include Russia, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia, whereas Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland and Ukraine use different color schemes.

Yugoslavia, both the Kingdom (Kingdom of Yugoslavia, 1918–1943) and the Republic (SFR Yugoslavia, 1943–1992) was a union of several Slavic nations, and therefore not only sported the pan-Slavic colors but adopted the pan-Slavic flag as its own (later adding a red star). After the initial breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, the two remaining Yugoslav republics—Montenegro and Serbia—reconstituted as Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1992 and as State Union of Serbia and Montenegro in 2003, and continued to use the pan-Slavic flag until its own dissolution when Montenegro proclaimed independence in 2006. Serbia continues to use a flag with all three Pan-Slavic colors, along with fellow republics Croatia and Slovenia.

Most flags with pan-Slavic colors have been introduced and recognized by Slavic nations following the first Slavic Congress of 1848, although Serbia adopted its red-blue-white tricolor in 1835 and the ethnic flag of Sorbs (blue-red-white) had already been designed in 1842. The flag of Slovene nation (white-blue-red), which was based on the flag of Carniola, was introduced two months prior to the congress. Czech Moravians proclaimed their flag (white-red-blue) at the very congress. In 1848, Croatian viceroy Josip Jelačić first designed the flag of Croatia with its modern tricolor (red-white-blue) for the then-concepted Triune Kingdom (and officially adopted by the Kingdom of Croatia), a group of Slovenian intellectuals in Vienna, Austria created the flag of Slovenia (white-blue-red), and the first Slovak flag (in reverse layout – red-blue-white) was introduced and flown by Slovak revolutionaries. The flag of the Czech Republic adopted its three national colors in 1920 with the founding of Czechoslovakia.

<doc id="297619" wikidata="Q419041" url="?curid=297619" title="Trichlorosilane">
<text>Trichlorosilane (TCS) is an inorganic compound with the formula HCl3Si. It is a colourless, volatile liquid. Purified trichlorosilane is the principal precursor to ultrapure silicon in the semiconductor industry. In water, it rapidly decomposes to produce a siloxane polymer while giving off hydrochloric acid. Because of its reactivity and wide availability, it is frequently used in the synthesis of silicon-containing organic compounds.

== Production ==
Trichlorosilane is produced by treating powdered metallurgical grade silicon with blowing hydrogen chloride at 300 °C. Hydrogen is also produced, as described in the chemical equation:
:Si + 3 HCl → HCl3Si + H2

Yields of 80-90% can be achieved. The main byproducts are silicon tetrachloride (chemical formula SiCl4), hexachlorodisilane (Si2Cl6) and dichlorosilane (H2SiCl2), from which trichlorosilane can be separated by distillation.

It is also produced from silicon tetrachloride:
:Si + 3 SiCl4 + 2 H2 → 4 HCl3Si

== Uses ==
Trichlorosilane is the basic ingredient used in the production of purified polysilicon.
:HCl3Si → Si + HCl + Cl2

It can be used in the Siemens process, which is a type of chemical vapor deposition process.

===Ingredient in hydrosilylation===
Via hydrosilylation, trichlorosilane is a precursor to other useful organosilicon compounds:
:RCH=CH2 + HSiCl3 → RCH2CH2SiCl3
Some useful products of this or similar reactions include octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS), perfluoroctyltrichlorosilane (PFOTCS), and perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane (FDTS). These reagents used in surface science and nanotechnology to form self-assembled monolayers. Such layers containing fluorine decrease surface energy and reduce sticking. This effect is usually exploited as coating for MEMS and microfabricated stamps for a nanoimprint lithography (NIL) and in injection molding tools.

===Organic synthesis===
Trichlorosilane is a reagent in the conversion of benzoic acids to toluene derivatives. In the first step of a two-pot reaction, the carboxylic acid is first converted to the trichlosilylbenzyl compound. In the second step, the benzylic silyl derivative is converted to the toluene derivative with base.

== Safety ==
Trichlorosilane is highly reactive, and may respond violently (and even explosively) to many compounds. This also includes water, potentially producing silicon dioxide, chlorine, hydrogen, hydrogen chloride (and its aqueous form hydrochloric acid), and heat. Trichlorosilane can cause hazardous chemical reactions with moisture and humidity alone, and should be handled and stored under inert gas. Spills of trichlorosilane may be neutralized using a 1-1 ratio of sodium hydroxide, or a 2-1 ratio of sodium bicarbonate to trichlorosilane. Fires can be extinguished using alcohol-resistant aqueous film-forming foam (AR-AFFF).

<text>is a Japanese anime television series based on Akira Toriyama&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga franchise that ran from February 1996 to November 1997. Produced by Toei Animation, the series premiered in Japan on Fuji TV and ran for 64 episodes. Unlike &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, the previous two television adaptations in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; media franchise, &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; does not adapt a manga by Toriyama. &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; is an anime-exclusive sequel to &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; with an original storyline using the same characters and universe, which follows the exploits of Son Goku, the series main protagonist who is turned into a child; his granddaughter, Pan; and their associates on a quest to collect the Black Star Dragon Balls, a more powerful set of Dragon Balls which are hidden throughout the galaxy.

Despite the series being a non-manga adaptation, series creator Toriyama designed new characters and concepts for &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;. It is the last &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series chronologically and until the release of &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; in 2015, &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; was the last televised animated series in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise altogether.

== Plot ==
=== Black Star Dragon Balls/Baby Saga ===
Five years after the 28th and the end of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; (changed from 5 to 10 years in the Funimation dub), Son Goku is accidentally turned back into a child by , a much more powerful red version of Shenron created by the Nameless Namekian (before he split into Kami and Demon King Piccolo) who can grant any single wish, regardless of any restrictions placed on the other dragons, summoned from the by his old enemy Emperor Pilaf. He is then forced to travel across the universe to retrieve them, accompanied by his granddaughter Pan and Trunks as, if he does not retrieve them within a year, the Earth will explode. The trio goes through various adventures in their journey to find the Black Star Dragon Balls, until they encounter the artificial Tuffle parasite, Baby, who intends to destroy the Saiyan race as his revenge for their extermination of the Tuffles many years ago.

After turning practically all of the Earth&#x27;s population, including the Saiyans, into Neo-Tuffles, Baby decides to convert Vegeta&#x27;s body into his own and use it to kill Goku. Goku fights him and is quickly defeated, but, after having his tail regenerated by Kibito Kai and Old Kai, transforms and achieves the power of . In this new form, Goku easily overpowers Baby before destroying the evil Tuffle by propelling him into the sun with a . Piccolo then sacrifices himself to permanently destroy Ultimate Shenron and the Black Star Dragon Balls when the Earth explodes after Goku and the others help the people of Earth evacuate to Planet Plant, which Baby had wished back into existence using the Black Star Dragon Balls.

=== Super Android 17 Saga ===
A year after Baby&#x27;s defeat, Dr. Myuu (Baby&#x27;s creator) and Dr. Gero (creator of the Red Ribbon Army androids) create an evil replica of in Hell, and have it control the original Android 17 so that a portal from Hell to Earth opens up, leading to a mass invasion of the planet by revived villains. The original Android 17 attempts to mentally manipulate Android 18 as well, but Krillin intervenes. Enraged, 17 murders Krillin by shooting an energy beam through his heart. The two Android 17s then fuse into , who vows to destroy all of humanity and avenge the Red Ribbon Army&#x27;s defeat at the hands of Goku. Super 17 seems impervious to all of Goku&#x27;s attacks, but when 18 attacks him to avenge Krillin&#x27;s death, Goku takes advantage of the distraction to penetrate through Super 17 with his technique, then unleashes a that completely eradicates him.

=== Shadow Dragons Saga ===
The Dragon Balls are collected to revive those killed by Super 17, including Krillin. However, an evil black dragon emerges and then splits into seven Shadow Dragons, who set out to punish humanity for their constant misuse of the Dragon Balls by destroying the Earth. All but the most powerful and evil, Syn Shenron, are defeated by Goku and Pan. Syn Shenron appears to be losing until he absorbs the Dragon Balls and gains tremendous power, transforming into Omega Shenron and surpassing even Super Saiyan 4 Goku&#x27;s power. Goku is about to sacrifice himself to destroy the evil one-star dragon, but Vegeta intervenes and gains the Super Saiyan 4 transformation with help from Bulma&#x27;s newest invention, the Blutz Wave Generator. Goku and Vegeta merge using the Fusion Dance technique to create Super Gogeta 4, who uses his immense power to beat Omega Shenron to a pulp. However, after being too confident in his ability to defeat Omega Shenron, he uses up too much time in an attempt to embarrass him. Gogeta then defuses and Goku and Vegeta revert to their base forms because Omega Shenron destroyed the Blutz Wave Generator. Eventually, using the energy of every living being in the universe, Goku creates the incredibly powerful and uses it to destroy Omega Shenron once and for all.

Afterward, the real and original Shenron appears from the restored Dragon Balls to grant Goku and his friends one last wish, which they use to revive everyone killed by Super 17 and the Shadow Dragons, and then proceeds to disappear – along with Goku and the Dragon Balls. Several decades later, Goku&#x27;s great-great-grandson and descendant, Goku Jr., competes in the 64th World Martial Arts Tournament against Vegeta&#x27;s great-great grandson and descendant, Vegeta Jr., as the now-elderly Pan cheers him on. Pan then sees a rejuvenated adult Goku and tries to approach him, but he quickly disappears into the crowd. Goku then leaves the World Martial Arts Tournament with a flashback covering all the events of his timeline. After the flashback ends, Goku then catches his Power Pole and rides off on his Flying Nimbus cloud, bringing the story of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; to an end.

== Characters ==

===Main characters===
====Son Goku====

Goku is descended from an alien warrior race known as the Saiyans, who sent him, originally named Kakarot, to Earth to prepare it for conquest. In the first episode, Goku is transformed back into a child by an accidental wish made by the Pilaf Gang using the Black Star Dragon Balls, setting in motion the events of the entire series. The Black Star Dragon Balls were then scattered around the whole universe in different planets after the wish making, and due to the lethal side effect of these Black Star Dragon Balls, the Earth was set to be destroyed in a year if the Balls were not collected within that period of time. Goku, his granddaughter Pan, and the son of Vegeta, Trunks, travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb. Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He then appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta&#x27;s descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs. Goku is the main protagonist of &quot;Dragon Ball GT,&quot; and the overall main protagonist of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise.

====Pan====
 is the granddaughter of Goku and Chi-Chi and daughter of Gohan and Videl, as such her ancestry comes from both humans and the extraterrestrials called the Saiyans. Pan appears as a young child in the final installments of the original manga and &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; anime series and is featured as one of the protagonists of the &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; anime series and its television special &quot;A Hero&#x27;s Legacy&quot;. According to &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; producer Kōzō Morishita, Pan&#x27;s role in the GT series was intended to be a strong but constantly imperiled character who had to be rescued by Goku, essentially a “heroine who makes Goku a hero”. 

In Japanese media she is voiced by Yūko Minaguchi. In the North American versions of &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;, she is voiced by Elise Baughman in the Funimation dub (who also voices her in &quot;Dragon Ball Kai&quot;) and by Caitlynne Medrek in the Blue Water dub. Sharon Mann voices the older version of the character in AB Groupe&#x27;s English dub of the GT TV special, which was recorded in France. In the English version of &quot;Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout&quot;, she is voiced by Julie Maddalena.

====Trunks====

In &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;, Trunks&#x27; second incarnation has become the president of Capsule Corporation, but does not take the job seriously. During his time on Imecka, Trunks battles with Ledgic, but he is defeated, who after which, Goku fights him. Trunks later encounters more powerful threats, such as Luud, and General Rilldo. He is then later briefly controlled by Baby during the Baby arc, but is able to free himself from control, but not before Baby implants a mind-control seed. Trunks travels through space with Pan and a de-aged Goku in search of the Black Star Dragon Balls during the first half of the series, though his prominence in the series is reduced following the Baby arc. He also plays a very big part of giving energy to Goku to help him fight Omega Shenron.

===Supporting characters===
====Vegeta====

In the Baby arc, Vegeta is confronted by a Baby-possessed Gohan. Baby possessed Vegeta during their battle despite strong resistance by Vegeta, and the resulting Baby/Vegeta fusion battles Goku. Vegeta is later split from Baby&#x27;s body before Baby is destroyed. Later, he fights Super Android #17, but again, he is knocked out and nearly killed. When Omega Shenron wreaks havoc, he fights with Goku as a Super Saiyan 4 but the two eventually revert to normal. Afterwards, Vegeta says a farewell to Goku, who leaves the duty of protecting Earth in Vegeta&#x27;s hands before he flies off into the sky on Shenron.

====Giru====
 is a character that first appears in the 3rd episode of &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;. Originally known as T2006 or DB4649T2006RS, Giru is a Machine Mutant, fully mechanical beings with organic properties: they can mold, contort, and reshape themselves like organic lifeforms, absorb and integrate metallic and mechanical materials into their being, as well as restructure themselves. He is encountered by Goku, Pan and Trunks on Imecka. Giru consumes their Dragon Radar for energy in an act of desperation for survival, inadvertently integrating the Dragon Radar&#x27;s functionality into his software. Giru joins Goku&#x27;s group and accompanies them to various planets in the galaxy on their quest to find the Black Star Dragon Balls. Giru would become good friends with Pan in the series; however, he is frequently the recipient of abuse, both verbal and physical, at the hands of Pan, which makes him somewhat fearful of her. Giru plays a pivotal role during the group&#x27;s encounter with his creator Doctor Myuu as well as the parasitic Baby on the planet M-2, and aids them in their subsequent struggle against the villains. During the Shadow Dragons arc, Giru accompanies Goku and Pan to search for the seven Shadow Dragons using his built-in Dragon Radar functionality to track the creatures. He is voiced by Shinobu Satouchi in Japanese media and by Sonny Strait in the Funimation anime dub.

====Uub ====
, known as Uub in the English anime dub, is the human reincarnation of the evil Majin Buu. In &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, after Buu was destroyed, Goku asked for him to be reincarnated as a good person, so they may battle again. Goku eventually senses Uub&#x27;s hidden power and seeks him out ten years later, when Uub attends the tournament to gain money for his village. Goku ends up deciding to train him to be a future defender of Earth and as an opponent that he can battle. During the Baby arc he would merge with the , (lit. &quot;Demon Person Buu (Good)&quot;), and become (&quot;Majuub&quot; in the English dub), a being powerful enough to face threats such as Baby, Super 17, and Omega Shenron. After fusing with Buu, he experiences a slight alteration of his physical appearance and gains a massive boost in power as well as new abilities such as Buu&#x27;s signature ability to turn enemies into candy.

He is voiced by Atsushi Kisaichi in Japanese, by Scott Roberts and Brendan Hunter in the English Blue Water dub, and by Sean Teague in the Funimation dub.

===Major antagonists===
====Doctor Myuu====
 is a recurring character that first appears in the 13th episode of &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;. A brilliant but mad Machine Mutant scientist, he is assisted by his enforcer and intends to gather the Black Star Dragon Balls to complete what appears to be his ultimate creation, Baby. His plans are eventually foiled by Goku, Pan, and Trunks after they arrive on the planet M-2 and defeat most of his minions. Myuu escapes and evades Goku and his companions after Baby&#x27;s apparent defeat, only to be killed when Baby suddenly emerges from his body. It is then revealed that Baby was the one who created and programmed Dr. Myuu, and not the other way around. He later joins forces with Doctor Gero while in Hell to create a duplicate of Android 17 using Myuu&#x27;s machine mutant technology, who then manipulates the original Android 17 into converging their power together to open a rift between Earth and Hell, enabling him and his co-creators to escape. Android 17 and his Hell Fighter duplicate eventually fuse to become Super 17, who subsequently turns on and murders both Gero and Myuu. He is voiced by Kazuyuki Sogabe in Japanese media and Duncan Brannan in the Funimation anime dub.

====Baby====
 is a character that first appears in the 22nd episode of &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;. He is a parasitic alien created by combining the DNA of the king of the with a cybernetic body. Baby desires to exterminate all of the Saiyans to avenge the extinction of his people and the loss of their homeworld to the Saiyans. Baby is first reactivated from a sleep state by Doctor Myuu; he attempts to fight Goku, Trunks, and Pan but is easily defeated. To boost his power, Baby infects various people with his DNA and begins gathering energy from them. After a second defeat at the hands of the three Saiyans, Baby infects Trunks and travels to Earth with his unsuspecting host. On Earth, he battles Goten and Gohan, infects them both, and eventually infects Vegeta to make him his primary host. Goku, Trunks, and Pan return to Earth to find the entire population is now under Baby&#x27;s control. Baby defeats Goku, then he uses the Black Star Dragon Balls to restore the planet Tuffle and transport the Earth population to it. During this time, Baby evolves into an even more powerful form and defeats and eats Uub after his chocolate beam is reflected back. Goku returns for a rematch, but is swiftly defeated. This causes Goku to transform into a Golden Great Ape and then into a Super Saiyan 4. Baby then has Bulma, also under his control, fire a radiation beam at him from her Blutz Wave Generator which enables him to transform into a Golden Great Ape as well. After a lengthy battle, Goku emerges victorious with the help of Uub, who weakens Baby from inside him, and Trunks, Gohan, and Goten, who were freed from Baby&#x27;s control by Kibito Kai. Baby separates from Vegeta and attempts to escape in a spaceship, vowing to return to destroy the Saiyans. Goku blasts the spaceship with a &quot;10x Kamehameha&quot; attack, sending it into the sun and obliterating Baby. The character made his manga debut in the first chapter of &quot;Dragon Ball Heroes: Victory Mission&quot; in October 2012. Baby is voiced by Yusuke Numata in Japanese media and by Mike McFarland in the Funimation anime dub.

====Super 17====
In the &quot;Super 17&quot; arc, Doctor Gero and Doctor Myuu create a machine mutant copy of Android 17 by the name of Hell Fighter 17, who is capable of mentally controlling Red Ribbon Androids like 17 and 18. Android 17 is compelled into fusing with his machine mutant replica and become the villainous Super 17. Super 17 is capable of absorbing an opponent&#x27;s incoming attacks, but he is unable to move and absorb energy at the same time. Sometime after Goku kills Super 17 using the &quot;Super Dragon Fist&quot; while the latter is distracted by 18, the original Android 17 is eventually revived with the Dragon Balls during the series finale. He is voiced by Shigeru Nakahara in Japanese media and Chuck Huber in the Funimation anime dub.

====Shadow Dragons====
The Shadow Dragons, known as in the original Japanese, are a group of evil beings born from the evil energy caused by overuse of the Dragon Balls in &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;. They are named after the One-Star through Seven-Star Dragon Balls; , , , , , , and . In the English dubs, their names are changed to Syn Shenron, Haze Shenron, Eis Shenron, Nuova Shenron, Rage Shenron, Oceanus Shenron, and Naturon Shenron respectively.

When attempting to undo the damage caused by Super 17, a cigar-smoking , named Black Smoke Shenron in the Funimation dub, is summoned from the Dragon Balls instead of the regular Shenron. He is a dragon who is formed from all the negative energy accumulated from the selfish wishes granted throughout the series using the Dragon Balls. Summoned from the same Earth Dragon Balls, he splits into seven Evil Dragons who each take the form of a tainted Dragon Ball, spreading out all over the world and proceeding to cause chaos, causing the heroes to defeat each one. Goku, Pan, and Giru manage to defeat the other dragons before encountering Eis and Nuova Shenron. Being much more honorable than his brethren, Nuova helps Goku and turns on Eis. Syn Shenron, the most powerful of the Shadow Dragons, kills Nuova before absorbing both his Dragon Ball and the others as well to increase his power and become Omega Shenron, in Japanese, with access to all of the abilities of his brethren. After a long battle, he is killed by Goku&#x27;s Super &quot;Genki-Dama&quot;, and the Dragon Balls are purified. 

The Shadow Dragons make their manga debut in the Jaaku Missions Saga of &quot;Dragon Ball Heroes: Victory Mission&quot;. When confronted by the Dragon Ball Heroes, Black Smoke Shenron creates Shadow GT Goku (シャドウ悟空, Shadō Gokū) to combat them. Shadow GT Goku is a replication of GT Goku created by Black Smoke Shenron as his primary method of fighting.

Daisuke Gōri voices Black Smoke Shenron in Japanese, and Christopher Sabat voices him in the Funimation dub. Syn/Omega Shenron is voiced by Hidekatsu Shibata in Japanese. Bob Carter and Christopher R. Sabat respectively voice Syn Shenron and Omega Shenron in the Funimation dub, while Victor Atelevich voices them both in the Blue Water dub.

== Production ==
Unlike the previous anime series in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise, &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; does not adapt the manga series written by Akira Toriyama, but tells an original story conceived by the staff of Toei Animation using the same characters and universe from the original &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga and it continues the story where &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; had left off. Toriyama did, however, come up with the &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; name, which stands for &quot;Grand Tour&quot;, in reference to the series having the characters travel through the universe, and designed the appearances of the main cast. Toriyama himself referred to &quot;GT&quot; as a &quot;side story of the original &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;&quot;.

Chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Super Saiyan 4 Goku, which was the idea of the show&#x27;s producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan&#x27;s form, he made the hair more &quot;wild&quot; and covered Goku&#x27;s body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character; although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blond, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.

=== Music ===
The music of &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; was composed by Akihito Tokunaga, although the series uses five pieces of theme music by popular recording artists. Field of View performs the series opening theme, , which is used for all 64 episodes in Japanese. Vic Mignogna performs the English version. , performed by Deen in Japanese and Stephanie Young in English, is used for the ending theme for the first 26 episodes. Starting at episode 27, the series begins using Zard&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t You See!&quot; for the ending theme in Japanese. Stephanie Young performed the song in English. Episode 42 marks the next ending theme change, with &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; by Shizuka Kudō in Japanese and Brina Palencia in English being used. , performed by Wands in Japanese and Justin Houston in English, is introduced as an ending theme in episode 51. It was used as the ending theme for the remainder of the series, except for the final episode, which reuses the opening theme as an insert song, which was omitted in the alternate soundtrack, composed by Mark Manza.

=== Localization ===
====Funimation dub====
When &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; was originally airing in Japan during 1996 and 1997, Funimation had already begun dubbing the first two seasons of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, in association with Saban Entertainment and Ocean Productions. Once Funimation completed work on &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; in 2003, they licensed &quot;GT&quot; for an English language broadcast in the United States. Their English dub of the series utilized a new guitar-based musical score by Mark Menza, and a new rap metal theme, titled &quot;Step into the Grand Tour&quot;. The theme was performed by rapper Marcus Hall (known as &quot;Shorty the Man&quot;).

The Funimation dub aired on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Toonami programming block from November 7, 2003, to April 16, 2005, and had reruns outside of Toonami until June 13, 2005. Funimation decided to release the first few home video volumes several months ahead of the TV debut. Part of the reasoning behind this was so that Toonami could repeat the entirety of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; in 2003 before airing the first episode of &quot;GT&quot;.

The company&#x27;s original home video release and television broadcast both skipped the first 16 episodes of the series. Instead, Funimation created a composition episode entitled &quot;A Grand Problem&quot; which used scenes from the skipped episodes to summarize the story. The skipped episodes were later shown on Cartoon Network as &quot;The Lost Episodes&quot; after the original broadcast concluded. Funimation&#x27;s English dub began re-airing in the US on Nicktoons from January 16 to December 13, 2012, (which also included the U.S. television premiere of Episode 16 &quot;Giru&#x27;s Checkered Past&quot;) and rerun until January 2, 2015, due to Adult Swim having air rights &quot;Dragon Ball Z Kai&quot; through Toonami. &quot;Step into the Grand Tour&quot; was included on the original DVD/VHS volumes by Funimation, and appeared on all TV airings on Toonami and Nicktoons. However, subsequent home video releases and streaming have excluded the song in favor of an English version of the Japanese theme. Later releases also include an audio track that combines the Funimation voices with the original Tokunaga score.

In Australia, Funimation&#x27;s English dub aired on Network Ten&#x27;s Cheez TV morning cartoon block from March 2004 to June 2004. It also aired concurrently on the Australian version of Toonami.

====Blue Water dub====
AB Groupe (in association with Chinook Animation and Blue Water Studios) produced an alternate dub for Europe and Canada and was aired on YTV and Toonami UK, which divided the episodes into two seasons. The original Japanese music composed by Akihito Tokunaga was retained in the Blue Water dub. This dub ran in the UK from March 3, 2003, on CNX until August 17, 2003. The &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; Ocean cast, which was used in the Funimation/Saban dub of Seasons 1–2 and the Westwood Media/AB Groupe dub of Seasons 4–9, was originally contacted to dub &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; as well. Due to cost-cutting measures, this never came to fruition, with dubbing being moved from Vancouver to Calgary, where Blue Water Studios was based.

The dub had a script that was independent of Funimation, with some techniques having different titles (such as &quot;Instant Transmission&quot;, which is renamed &quot;Instant Translocation&quot;). The names of various characters, such as the Shadow Dragon villains, were more accurate to the Japanese version when compared to the names given by Funimation. Unlike with the Funimation dub and Japanese version, the dub utilized a real child actress for Pan.

====AB Groupe dub====
A third English dub exists, also produced by AB Groupe, utilizing a different French-based cast. This cast only dubbed the 1997 &quot;A Hero&#x27;s Legacy&quot; special, which aired on Toonami UK in 2005. Like with the Blue Water dub, it kept the original Japanese soundtrack. The French-based English cast also dubbed most of the other &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; / &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; films and specials, with their dub being known by fans as the &quot;Big Green dub&quot;, because it changed Piccolo&#x27;s name to Big Green.

===Home media and streaming===

In Japan, &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; did not receive a home video release until June 15, 2005, eight years after its broadcast. This was a remastering of the series in a single 12-disc DVD box set, that was made-to-order only, referred to as a &quot;Dragon Box&quot;. It was released by Pony Canyon.

Two years later, they began releasing the series again in DVD &quot;remastered season&quot; sets that finally put the episodes in proper chronological order; the first on December 9, 2008, and the second on February 10, 2009. A Game Boy Advance Video cartridge containing the episodes &quot;A Grand Problem&quot; and &quot;Pan&#x27;s Gambit&quot; was released on September 7, 2004, by Majesco Entertainment. A complete series DVD box set including the TV special was later released on September 21, 2010. Manga Entertainment began distributing &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; on DVD in the UK on January 20, 2014, which are re-releases of Funimation&#x27;s 2008 and 2009 sets. The first season set of &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; contains the first 34 episodes of the series on five discs, and was released alongside MVM Films&#x27; release of &quot;Is This a Zombie? of the Dead&quot;.

The series was made available on the FunimationNow app upon its launch. In March 2022, &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; along with the Dragon Ball titles were transferred to Crunchyroll, a streaming service Funimation acquired a year prior.

The game featured a Californian-based voice cast for the North American version, rather than the Vancouver-based Ocean cast, who were doing the original North American dub of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; during 1997. The 2005 Game Boy Advance game &quot;Dragon Ball GT: Transformation&quot; was released exclusively in North America.

Characters from the series continue to be featured in video games of the franchise, including &quot;Dragon Ball Xenoverse&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball FighterZ&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&quot;.

=== Other media ===
In 2018, a new &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; anime series was created by Toei called &quot;Super Dragon Ball Heroes&quot;. It was produced to promote spin-off merchandise of the franchise, specifically the game of the same name. In the show, the main cast of characters are shown a parallel universe modelled after &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;, this universe&#x27;s variant of Goku (known as Xenoverse Goku) emulates the Goku from the main series during the events of the &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; storyline, with his go-to form being that of &quot;Super Saiyan 4.&quot; 

== Reception ==
The series is often considered the &quot;black sheep&quot; of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise, due to the lack of involvement from series creator Akira Toriyama. In 2010, &quot;Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2&quot; producer Ryo Mito stated that &quot;GT is popular with fans overseas. In Japan, it&#x27;s not as popular.&quot; It was considered to be Funimation&#x27;s second-biggest anime property during the 2000s, behind only &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;. GT&#x27;s American release was labeled as &quot;very successful&quot; in 2005. 

Jeffrey Harris from IGN called it &quot;downright repellent,&quot; mentioning that the material and characters had lost their novelty and fun. They also criticized the GT character designs of Vegeta and Trunks as being &quot;goofy.&quot; Anime News Network (ANN) also gave negative comments about the anime, mentioning that the fights from the series were &quot;a very simple childish exercise&quot; and that older fans will want to stick with other anime. The series&#x27;s plot was also criticized for giving a formula that was already used in its predecessors. Although, it did call it &quot;a fun ride when not taken very seriously.&quot; 

In his 2008 Funimation season set review, Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk stated that the series became the &quot;bastard child of the series&quot;, and was &quot;a bad idea that spawned out of someone&#x27;s desire to make more money on the back of Toriyama&#x27;s work.&quot; He goes on to write, &quot;&quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; isn&#x27;t all bad. There are some nice fights scattered throughout the show and though the stories never quite reach the level we grew accustomed to in Z some of moments were entertaining enough to please &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; fans. It&#x27;s just that those snippets are spread few and far between and when compared to its predecessors it comes up woefully short by all accounts.&quot;

CBR stated that the character of Pan &quot;embraces a tomboy aesthetic and prefers fighting over other activities that might be considered more conventionally feminine.&quot;, and claimed that the show &quot;dropped the ball with [her] potential.&quot; Comicbook.com said that GT &quot;floundered to create characters who were memorable or even likable to fans&quot;, and criticized it for making Goku become &quot;so important to the show that former characters like Krillin, Gohan, and even Vegeta are all but forgotten.&quot;

<text>Louis Russell Chauvenet (February 12, 1920 – June 24, 2003) was an American champion chess player and one of the founders of science fiction fandom.

==Biography==

===Chess===
Chauvenet was the U.S. Amateur Champion in 1959, as well as state champion for Virginia in 1942 through 1948 and for Maryland in 1963, 1969 and 1976. He also wrote columns for &quot;Chess Life&quot;. Chauvenet reached the level of Expert, a rating better than nine out of 10 chess players involved in tournament play.

In 1991, Chauvenet won the fourth National Deaf Championship, in Austin, Texas. In 1992, at Edinburgh, Scotland, the International Committee of Silent Chess awarded him its Grandmaster title. Chauvenet represented the US at the World Individuals four times: Amsterdam in 1980, Washington, D.C., in 1984 where he won the Silver medal, Stockholm in 1988 where he won an additional Silver medal, and in Edinburgh in 1992. Chauvenet also won three National Tournaments of the Deaf, at Chicago in 1980, Washington, D.C. in 1983 and Rochester in 1987.

===Fandom===

Chauvenet was a founder of Boston&#x27;s The Stranger Club (the members of which were guests of honor at the 47th World Science Fiction Convention), and hosted its first meeting at his home in 1940. He also co-founded the National Fantasy Fan Federation, with Damon Knight and Art Widner, and was a member of First Fandom.

He coined the word &quot;fanzine&quot; in the October 1940 issue of his fanzine &quot;Detours&quot; and was for many years a member of the Fantasy Amateur Press Association (FAPA). He later coined &quot;prozine,&quot; a term for professionally published magazines containing science fiction stories.

===Other avocations===

Chauvenet was also an enthusiastic sailor, who built his own Windmill class sailboat and participated in regattas, as well as a medal-winning runner.
He served as editor of the Windmill Class Association newsletter in addition to other positions and is one of 5 individuals names as honorary members of the class.

===Early and family life===
Chauvenet was born in Knoxville, Tennessee. He became completely deaf in 1930 at age 10, after suffering cerebro-spinal meningitis. He attended Central Institute for the Deaf and Wright Oral School, before graduating from Belmont Hill Preparatory School. He went on to Harvard, Boston College and the University of Virginia, receiving a Bachelor of Science in biology in 1943 and a Master of Science in chemistry in 1948 from Virginia. From 1943-1946 he was employed by the Calco Chemical Company in New Jersey, after which he worked with computers as a civilian employee of the U.S. Department of Defense from 1948 until his retirement.

His wife, Jane, was a teacher. Their son, Allen, is a pediatric oncologist; in 1963, son and father respectively won the Maryland junior chess championship and the state title.

<text>Patrol chess is a chess variant in which captures can be made and checks given only if the capturing or checking piece is guarded (or &quot;patrolled&quot;) by a friendly unit. Non-capturing and non-checking moves are played as normal.

The variant was invented by Frederik Hendrik von Meyenfeldt who published a chess problem using the rules in &quot;The Problemist&quot; (the magazine of the British Chess Problem Society) in 1975.

Patrol chess has often been used as a condition in chess problems. It is also possible to play complete games under Patrol chess rules.
==Example==
The diagram position shows some of the peculiarities of Patrol chess. The white king cannot take the black knight because it is not guarded by a friendly piece. Similarly, the black rook is not giving check, and neither is the white knight on f7. If White were to play Nbd8, however, this would be check, as the knights would patrol one another. Black could reply ...Ke4, with checkmate: the king patrols the rook on e3 giving check and guarding b3 and d3; the rook on a2 is patrolled by the knight on b4 and so controls the squares b2, c2 and d2; Kd4 is not possible because the black king, patrolled by the e3 rook, controls that square; and Kxb4 is not possible because the white king is not patrolled and so cannot capture.

<doc id="297636" wikidata="Q191133" url="?curid=297636" title="Fátima, Portugal">
<text>Fátima () is a city in the municipality of Ourém and district of Santarém in the Oeste e Vale do Tejo Region of Portugal, with 71.29 km2 of area and 13,212 inhabitants (2021). The homonymous civil parish encompasses several villages and localities of which the city of Fátima is the largest.

The civil parish has been permanently associated with Our Lady of Fátima, a series of 1917 Marian apparitions that were purportedly witnessed by three local shepherd children at the Cova da Iria. The Catholic Church later recognized these events as &quot;worthy of belief&quot;. A small chapel was built at the site of the apparition in 1919, and a statue of Mary installed. The chapel and statue have since been enclosed within the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima, a shrine complex containing two minor basilicas. Associated facilities for pilgrims, including a hotel and medical centre, have also been built over the decades within and around the Sanctuary. The city has become an important international destination for religious tourists, receiving between 6 and 8 million pilgrims yearly.

==History==
===Name origin===
The name of the town and parish is a rendition of the Arabic given name &quot;Fátima&quot; ( ). According to the traditional narrative, Fátima was said to be the name of a Moorish princess kidnapped by a knight, Gonçalo Hermigues, and his companions. Hermigues took her to a small village in the Serra de Aire hills, in the recently established Kingdom of Portugal. Fatima fell in love with her kidnapper and decided to convert to Christianity to marry him. She was baptized and given the Christian name &quot;Oureana&quot;. However, the place name recalls the princess&#x27; original Arab name rather than her Christian one.

===Marian apparitions and &quot;Sun miracle&quot;===
The parish was founded in 1568, when it was annexed by the Collegiate of Ourém (). For centuries, most of the villagers kept herds of sheep and depended on subsistence farming.

Since the 18th century, Fátima has been associated with events related to Marian apparitions. The first supposed apparition dates back to the mid 18th century in Ortiga, now a quarter of Fátima, when, according to popular belief, the Virgin Mary appeared to a young, mute shepherdess and asked for one of her sheep, causing the girl to speak in response. This event supposedly incited the creation of the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Ortiga in 1758, which, in 1801, prompted Pope Pius VII to grant an indulgence to all pilgrims visiting the Marian shrine.

Later in the early 20th century, a similar event took place in which three local children, Lúcia dos Santos and her cousins, Francisco and Jacinta Marto, purportedly saw visions of a woman known as Our Lady of Fátima, since believed by the Catholic Church to be the Virgin Mary. On 13 May 1917, whilst guarding their families&#x27; sheep in the Cova da Iria, the children first claimed to have seen an apparition of a &quot;lady dressed in white&quot; and shining with a bright light.

The three shepherd children were born in Aljustrel, a small hamlet about from Fátima. To the west, near Aljustrel, is Loca do Cabeço, a smaller agglomeration of rocky outcroppings where, in 1916, an angel appeared twice to the three children. The children claimed to have seen the Marian apparition on six occasions; they said the last would be 13 October 1917. An estimated 70,000 pilgrims went to the site for the last prophesied apparition in October. Some of them reported what has been referred to as the Miracle of the Sun, when some observers reported it appeared to be behaving unusually.

The local bishop investigated the events and determined that the apparitions were worthy of belief. The site was marked by a cross erected by locals. In 1918 they built a small chapel of rock and limestone and covered in tile. It was by length, and height. It became a centre for Marian devotion, receiving names such as &quot;a fé de Fátima, cidade da Paz&quot; (&quot;the faith of Fátima, City of Peace&quot;), or &quot;Terra de Milagres e Aparições&quot; (&quot;Land of Miracles and Apparitions&quot;). The focus of Fatima as a place for peace pilgrimages developed in World War II when Lucia&#x27;s messages were linked to the conflict.

The chapel has since been enclosed within a large basilica and sanctuary, part of a complex including a hotel and other facilities. In 1930, the statue of Our Lady in the Chapel of Apparitions was crowned by the Vatican.

Francisco died in 1919 and Jacinta in 1920, during the international Spanish flu pandemic. Lucia dos Santos became a nun and lived until 2005. The two who died young were beatified on 13 May 2000 by Pope John Paul II, and were canonised by Pope Francis on 13 May 2017, the hundredth anniversary of the first apparition.

===Subsequent development===
The construction of the sanctuary and the steady visits by pilgrims stimulated local development. In addition to construction of a large shrine, basilica, and sanctuary, the complex includes a hotel and other facilities. The town of Fátima was elevated to the status of city on 12 July 1997.

In the early 21st century, numerous residents of the parish (primarily from its business sector) worked to have Fátima designated as an independent municipality. The project, led by Júlio Silva, engineer and ex-president of the &quot;Junta de Freguesia&quot; (Parish Council), was vetoed in July 2003 by President of Portugal Jorge Sampaio.

==Geography and climate==
===Geography===

Fátima is located in central west Portugal. It borders São Mamede (Batalha) and Minde (Alcanena) to the southwest, Pedrógão and Chancelaria (Torres Novas) in the east, Atouguia and Nossa Senhora das Misericórdias (Ourém) to the north and Santa Catarina da Serra e Chainça (Leiria) to the northwest.

The parish contains the following localities: Aljustrel, Alvaijar, Amoreira, Boleiros, Casa Velha, Casal Farto, Chã, Charneca, Cova da Iria, Eira da Pedra, Fátima, Giesteira, Lombo da Égua, Maxeira, Moimento, Moita Redonda, Moitas, Montelo, Pederneira, Poço de Soudo, Ramila, Vale de Cavalos and Valinho de Fátima.

Fátima sits on a plateau at approximately above sea level, being at a much higher altitude than the rest of the parishes in Ourém. This plateau represents the northernmost portion of the Estremadura Limestone Massif, which was created during the Middle Jurassic and is characterized by various geological formations including sinkholes, uvalas and polje (like the Polje de Minde-Mata), as well as karst grottoes, caves with stalactites and stalagmites, in addition to lapiez fields. As such, Fátima has geological and cultural similarities with the nature park of Serras de Aire e Candeeiros just south of it.

The soil is characteristically porous which intensifies the already low availability of water in the summer. And even though precipitation in autumn, winter and spring is relatively high, the overall flora is Mediterranean and well adapted to droughts.

The trees in this area are primarily dominated by holly oak (&quot;Quercus rotundifolia&quot;), Portuguese oak (&quot;Quercus faginea&quot;), strawberry trees (&quot;Arbutus unedo&quot;), buckthorn (&quot;Rhamnus alaternus&quot;), mastic (&quot;Pistacia lentiscus&quot;), bay laurel (&quot;Laurus nobilis&quot;) and olive trees, all of which are resistant to both the winter precipitation extremes and the summer drought. There are also areas of savannah, strips of land bounded by walls of loose stone. Pine and eucalyptus forests are also common in the outskirts of the city.

===Climate===
Fátima has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csb) in transition to a hot-summer (Csa).

The climate is characterized by heavy precipitation during late autumn and winter, with approximately annually, and warm, dry summers. Fátima has considerably more precipitation than other cities nearby in part due to its higher altitude, though precipitation in summer is more or less the same.

In the winter, temperatures range between on the daytime and at night with January being the coldest month. Humid air masses coming from N/NW that come into contact with the plateau of Fátima are the reason behind the strong rains experienced in the low-sun half of the year. Light frosts are typical from late December to mid February and temperatures can get down to occasionally.

Summer temperatures range between at day and at night, but are rather unpredictable, as influences from the marine layer of the nearby Atlantic can often lower the maxima to around and thermal lows from the Iberian Peninsula can lead temperatures to surpass . Temperatures rarely get above but when they do they are often accompanied by low humidity which can sometimes lead to unwanted forest fires around the area.

The city has about 2600 hours of annual sunshine. Snow is rare, the last significant events being in 2016 and 2013 both on 27 February.
===Twin towns – Sister cities===

Fátima is twinned with:

* Częstochowa in Poland
* Loreto in Italy
* Droß in Austria
* Altötting in Germany
* Lourdes in France
* Selçuk in Turkey
==Economy==

The economy of the city relies on religious tourism because the world devotion through Our Lady of Fátima attracts millions of Christian pilgrims. The locals have numerous shops and stalls devoted to the sale of religious articles and souvenirs. In addition, services for tourists, hotels, restaurants and other retail also benefit from the visitors. Other economic activities in the region include: marble sculpturing, saw-milling, carpentry, civil construction, commerce, and services.

<doc id="297644" wikidata="Q2296719" url="?curid=297644" title="Bubblegum Crash">
<text>is a 1991 OVA anime series produced by Artmic and Artland. It is the sequel to the 1987 OVA series &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot;, taking place a year after the series. The Knight Sabers seem to be finished, as each of its members except Nene Romanova have seemingly drifted off to pursue their own goals. But at the same time, a recent string of robberies, murders, and Boomer malfunctions begin to occur. Knight Sabers&#x27; leader Sylia Stingray is then forced to recruit Nene and the other members back together. The group tries to find out who or what is behind the recent string of crimes which are somehow related to the creation of an advanced artificial intelligence.

After the split between Artmic and Youmex, Artmic proceeded to make &quot;Bubblegum Crash&quot; on their own, which ran three OVA episodes and is conjectured that it was a shortened version of how &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot; was to end. Youmex then sued Artmic, cutting the series short and tying the franchise up in legal issues until the late 1990s, when Artmic went bankrupt and Youmex was absorbed into Toshiba EMI.

Upon release, the series received mixed reviews from fans and critics.

==Plot==
&quot;Bubblegum Crash&quot; takes place in 2034, one year after the events of &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot;. The Knight Sabers have broken up, as each of its members have moved on to pursue their own life goals as things seemed to have calmed down. Knight Sabers leader and founder Sylia Stingray has disappeared. The group&#x27;s number two, Japanese-American musician Priscilla &quot;Priss&quot; Asagiri, has stumbled from one manager to another. Nene Romanova, the IT expert of the Knight Sabers, is still working with the AD Police and trying to keep the Knight Saber ideal alive, and Linna Yamazaki has moved into playing the Japanese stock market and has gotten rich as a result. Things are quiet, until a group of mercenaries called the Illegal Army begin attacking tech companies across Tokyo, and they steal rare parts from them. As a result, Sylia is forced to bring Nene and the other members back together. They then try to find out who or what is behind the recent string of robberies, murders, and Boomer malfunctions caused by the Illegal Army which are related to the creation of an advanced artificial intelligence.

==Characters==

The characters are similar to those in the &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot; OVA series.

 (spelled Silia in &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot;)

Sylia is the 22-year-old ringleader of the Knight Sabers. She is a Hafu of British descent. Very calm and cool-headed, she does not show much emotion. She is the daughter of Dr. Katsuhito Stingray, the man who originally created the boomers. Sylia is a wealthy businesswoman whose business ventures, aside from the mercenaries&#x27; fee, finance the team. Her primary business is the lingerie shop &quot;Silky Doll&quot; she personally runs, housed in her private building, Lady&#x27;s 633, on whose top is also her penthouse apartment functioning as the Knight Sabers&#x27; base of operations. She wears a blue and silver Hard Suit equipped with retractable sword blades in the forearms, laser cannons in the palms and wings for full flight capability.

Priss is the strongest member of the Knight Sabers, specializing in heavy assault. The Japanese-American vocalist of an underground rock band, Priss is an orphan of the 2025 Kantō earthquake, who joined a biker gang. After her boyfriend was killed and his death declared insignificant by the police (giving her a dislike for the law enforcement), she attempted to hunt down the killers, but she was recruited into the Knight Sabers instead. She wears a dark blue Hard Suit, which features a railgun in the right hand as well as a laser gun in the original series and her signature knuckle bombers (explosive charges in both hands of her hard suit). In &quot;Crash&quot;, her suit becomes a modular core system to which a variety of selective heavy weapons can be attached.

Linna is a member of the Knight Sabers. She is the only member of the Sabers that is not a Hafu. Linna dons a green Hard Suit equipped with &quot;ribbon cutters&quot;, which are long, electrically charged nanomolecular ropes mounted behind the helmet that can be used to slash through Boomers and other high-tech opponents. Like Priss, she is also armed with explosive knuckle bombers as well as a finger-mounted triplet laser gun. In &quot;Crash&quot;, the knuckle bombers and lasers are replaced with electrically charged twin wire-daggers. Working as an aerobics instructor, Linna once hoped to pursue a career in professional dancing, but her efforts went unappreciated by all but Sylia, who recruited her into the Sabers. Eventually, her constant greed makes her switch to stockbroker consulting in &quot;Crash&quot;.

Nene is the youngest member of the Knight Sabers, acting as the IT expert of the group and as an officer of the AD Police, functioning as the group&#x27;s mole in the ADP. She is a Hāfu of Russian descent. She is bubbly, naive, has an affinity for candy and junk food, and is blissfully inept with real world logic. Due to her lack of (and unwillingness to engage in) regular exercise, she is often teased by Priss and Linna for not being more physically durable. Nene&#x27;s blue and pink Hard Suit&#x27;s offensive weapon is a laser gun unsuited for taking out enemies; instead, it is used to scribble the Knight Sabers&#x27; signature onto their scene of actions. She relies on her suit&#x27;s computer and electronic warfare systems to stay away from an enemy. She gets another new suit in &quot;Crash&quot;. Her suit&#x27;s offensive capabilities are stocked up considerably with an electromagnetic pulse striker and the capability of physically hacking into a Boomer&#x27;s computer brain.

Leon McNichol

An A.D. Police officer from America, Leon is a dedicated cop with a tendency to rush in without thinking. He is a skilled powered armor pilot, one of the A.D. Police&#x27;s aces in its K-11 and K-12S powered suits. Leon has a crush on Priss, which she does not like since she has a grudge against the A.D. Police.

Daley Wong

Daley is Leon&#x27;s partner and a highly skilled investigator. He is Chinese-American and openly homosexual. He flirts openly with the heterosexual Leon whenever Leon&#x27;s temper tends to get the better of him, and Leon often reciprocates with good humor.

==Reception==
Critical reception of &quot;Bubblegum Crash&quot; has been mixed. Both critics and fans consider it to be a downgrade compared to &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot; and its reboot &quot;Tokyo 2040&quot;.

Raphael See of THEM Anime Reviews gave &quot;Crash&quot; a rating of 3 out of 5 stars, praising the artwork and character development, but criticized the designs of the Boomers, as well as noting that &quot;the biggest complaint that fans have against &quot;Crash&quot; is that it doesn&#x27;t live up to the tone or flavor of &quot;Crisis&quot;. That much is true - &quot;Bubblegum Crash&quot; takes itself MUCH less seriously than &quot;Crisis&quot;. Less charitable critics sometimes call Crash &#x27;Sailor Moon in Hardsuits.&#x27;&quot; Overall, See concludes that &quot;Crash&quot; is not bad, but that &quot;die-hard Crisis fans will probably want to stay away.&quot;

Christopher Macdonald of Anime News Network gave the series a rating of C+, handing out praise for the artwork, animation, and some of the story, but criticized the lighter tone of the series compared to &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot;, the soundtrack, and for not keeping continuity in the Knight Sabers&#x27; personalities between the original and the sequel. He states that &quot;it isn&#x27;t as good as Crisis, but it&#x27;s still not that bad. However, sequels are never judged exclusively on their own merits; they are judged in comparison with the original, and Crash simply doesn&#x27;t have the character of Crisis.&quot;

<text>The Via Egnatia was a road constructed by the Romans in the 2nd century BC. It crossed Illyricum, Macedonia, and Thracia, running through territory that is now part of modern Albania, North Macedonia, Greece, and European Turkey as a continuation of the Via Appia.

Starting at Dyrrachium (now Durrës) on the Adriatic Sea, the road followed a difficult route along the river Genusus (Shkumbin), over the &quot;Candaviae&quot; (Jablanica) mountains and thence to the highlands around Lake Ohrid. It then turned by parts south, following several high mountain passes to reach the northern coastline of the Aegean Sea at Thessalonica. From there it ran through Thrace to the city of Byzantium (later Constantinople, now Istanbul). It covered a total distance of about 1,120 km (696 miles/746 Roman miles). Like other major Roman roads, it was about six metres (19.6 ft) wide, paved with large polygonal stone slabs or covered with a hard layer of sand.

== Construction and usage ==
The main literary sources for the construction of the road are Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geographica&quot; and a number of milestones found along the route&#x27;s length, marking the road for a length of 860 kilometres as far as the border between Macedonia and Thrace. Bilingual inscriptions on the milestones record that Gnaeus Egnatius, proconsul of Macedonia, ordered its construction, though the exact date is uncertain; the road presumably took its name from its builder. It may have succeeded an earlier military road from Illyria to Byzantium, as described by Polybius and Cicero, which the Romans apparently built over and/or improved.

The Via Egnatia was constructed in order to link a chain of Roman colonies stretching from the Adriatic Sea to the Bosphorus. The termini of the Via Egnatia and the Via Appia, leading from Rome itself, were almost directly opposite each other on the east and west shores of the Adriatic Sea. The route, thus gave the colonies of the southern Balkans a direct connection to Rome. It was also a vital link to Roman territories further to the east; until a more northerly route across Illyria was opened under Augustus it was Rome&#x27;s main link with her empire in the eastern Mediterranean. It was repaired and expanded several times but experienced lengthy periods of neglect due to Rome&#x27;s civil wars.

The road was used by the Apostle Paul on his second missionary journey as he traveled from Philippi to Thessalonica (Acts 16–17). It also played a vital role in several key moments in Roman history: the armies of Julius Caesar and Pompey marched along the Via Egnatia during Caesar&#x27;s civil war, and during the Liberators&#x27; civil war Mark Antony and Octavian pursued Cassius and Brutus along the Via Egnatia to their fateful meeting at the Battle of Philippi. Surviving milestones record that the emperor Trajan undertook extensive repairs of the road prior to his campaign of 113 against the Parthians. However, by the 5th century AD the road had largely fallen into disuse as a result of violent instability in the region. A 5th-century historian noted that the western sections of the Via Egnatia were in such a poor state that travellers could barely pass along it.

In later years, the Via Egnatia was revived as a key road of the Eastern Roman Empire; Procopius records repairs made by Eastern Roman emperor Justinian I during the 6th century, though even then the dilapidated road was said to be virtually unusable during wet weather. Almost all Byzantine overland trade with western Europe traveled along the Via Egnatia. During the Crusades, armies traveling to the east by land followed the road to Constantinople before crossing into Asia Minor. In the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, control of the road was vital for the survival of the Latin Empire as well as the Byzantine successor states the Empire of Nicaea and the Despotate of Epirus.

==Post-Roman usage==
During the first European conquests of Ottoman Turks &quot;sol kol&quot; (lit. &quot;left arm&quot;) was following the Via Egnatia.

Today there is a modern highway in Greece that is called Egnatia Odos. It runs in parallel to the Via Egnatia between Thessaloniki and the Turkish border on the Evros river, while its western, Thessaloniki-Igoumenitsa stretch runs far south of the Via Egnatia. Its name means &quot;Via Egnatia&quot; in Greek, alluding to its ancient counterpart.

The Via Egnatia is known as (&quot;The Big Road&quot;) by the Aromanians in their native Aromanian language.

Abstract: The Via Egnatia, which linked Dyrrachium to Kypsela and ultimately to Byzantium/Constantinople, was the first Roman highway to be built east of the Adriatic. The studies published so far on this important road are devoted almost exclusively to its military importance, particularly during the Roman Republic. This author&#x27;s goal instead was to assess the importance of the Egnatia at a political, social, and cultural level, by examining written sources (literary and epigraphical) and material remains. The article looks into the policy of Roman emperors regarding the Egnatia, and the role of the Via as a factor of commercial, social, and cultural interaction between the Italian peninsula and the Greek world, as well as among the cities and regions that it crossed. It also shows the contribution of the Egnatia to the spectacular development of certain cities and the parallel weakening of others, together with its impact upon the rural landscape.

Abstract: Cette étude est l&#x27;œuvre de deux auteurs don&#x27;t l&#x27;un (J. Votýpka-Pecha), en tant que médecin de l&#x27;expédition géologique tchécoslovaque en Albanie en 1957, eu l&#x27;occasion de prospecter le terrain sur place. La première partie présente un bref compte-rendu de sa part, tandis que les deux auteurs répondent en commun de la partie suivante dans laquelle ces observations sont appréciées et confrontées avec la littérature. Il s&#x27;agit de l&#x27;établissement du tracé de la route romaine Via Egnatia et de l&#x27;identification des stations mantionnées dans différents itinéraires, entre l&#x27;actuel Elbasan et le Lac d&#x27;Okhrida, donc dans un secteur en bien des endroits d&#x27;accès difficile, qui pour cela avait été jusqu&#x27;ici peu prospecté. D&#x27;Elbasan (l&#x27;antique Scampa) la route longeait tout d&#x27;abord la rive droite du Shkumbin jusqu&#x27;au pont appelé aujourd&#x27;hui Ura e Haxhi Bëgarit (eventuellement Beqarit; station Genesis flumen, eventuellement mutatio Treiecto). De là, elle poursuivait le long de la rive gauche du fleuve, à travers le massif Polis, jusqu&#x27;à la commune de Qukës, où elle rencontrait à nouveau le Shkumbin; elle le franchissait sur un pont dont les vestiges sont encore visibles. C&#x27;est à peu près au point culminant du passage à travers le massif Polis, près de la commune de Babjë, que se trouvait la station Ad Dianam (mansio Grandavia). Près du pont de Qukës se trouvait la station In Candavia (mutatio in Tabernas, Tres Tabernas). A propos de l&#x27;identification de ces stations et du tracé de la route d&#x27;Elbasan jusqu&#x27;à Qukës il ne peut y avoir de doute, et dans l&#x27;ensemble, les auteurs s&#x27;accordent à ce sujet avec Miller (Itineraria Romana) ainsi qu&#x27;avec les études du chercheur albanais Adam de 1953. Mais ils diffèrent foncièrement dans l&#x27;établissement du tracé du secteur suivant; ils estiment que la route ne passait par par l&#x27;affluent de rive droite du Shkumbin (Perroj i Lingajce), mais qu&#x27;aussitôt après le pont elle grimpait sur le massif, traversait le territoire des communes de Skroskë, Pishkash et Rajcë, après quoi elle ne rejoignait la route actuelle que sur les crêtes dominant le lac (Karakoll). C&#x27;est pourquoi ils situent la station Pons Servili vers le passage de la rivière dans la commune de Rajcë. Ils s&#x27;appuient ce faisant sur les trouvailles antiques de ce tracé (un fragment de statue de Skroskë, des pièces de monnaie au pied du Pishkash) ainsi que sur les traditions locales, mais avant tout sur les vestiges conservés de la route antique entre les communes de Pishkash et de Rajcë. — Sur le premier plan, la Via Egnatia est indiquée par une ligne interrompue (.—), sur le second, dessiné d&#x27;après une vue aérienne, son tracé est indiqué au pied du mont Pishkash.

Environmental &amp; Engineering Geoscience. III, no. 1: 123–132. Abstract: Romans, the first real road designers, designed and constructed the first organized road system in Europe. This system was in use for almost 2,000 years with some parts still in use as secondary roads. Via Egnatia, the first highway to cross the Balkan Peninsula, was the first road built by Romans outside Italy. It was constructed in the second century B.C. The road began in Dyrrachium (modern Durrës), by the Adriatic sea, and passed through Serbia, Macedonia (Thessaliniki) and Thrace terminating at Cypsela (east of Evros river) and later extended up to Konstantinoupolis. The total length of the road from Dirrachium to Cypsela was about 750 km. From the study of sections of the road surviving in the Thrace region, Greece, it appears that the design and the construction of the road (in the area under discussion) was based on well-known specifications. Specifically, the road was always adapted to local topography, geomorphology and ground conditions. Thus the road avoided the difficult and unstable ground, the close curves and the steep grades. The thickness and the layering of the pavement varied according to the foundation conditions. In stable, rocky ground, the pavement consisted of only one layer of well-fitted cobble stones; whereas, in soft and unstable ground the soft soil was excavated and replaced by several layers of cobbles, gravels and rubbles held together with compacted sandy soil or lime mortar. Up to four stone layers have been found in an archaeological excavation in the road pavement in the Thrace area. Some layers were made waterproof by well-compacted clay soil. The thickness of the pavement varied from 25 cm to more than 150 cm. The materials used were mainly of local origin. The width of the road ranged from 4 m to 8 m, depending on the ground conditions and the traffic demand. In cities its width reached up to 20 m to accommodate the increased traffic. The horizontal curvature (curves) of the road was usually more than 100 m (R&gt;100 m). Only in a few cases in mountainous areas curvatures of R = 10–20 m were found. The grade of the pavement normally was 1 to 2 percent, but in mountain regions gradients of 16 to 18 percent were observed. Gradients up to 20 percent were measured in a stretch of the road 2 km west of Kavala. The cross section of the pavement was convex, with grades perpendicular to its axis from 5 to 10 percent, for rapid drainage. Large rock blocks were placed at the sides of the pavement, raised above the surface, to prevent lateral spreading of the pavement and deterring carts and wagons from sliding off the road. A series of elongated rock blocks were constructed in the middle of the pavement, possibly for separating the opposite traffic. It is suggested that the remnants of this Roman road be preserved not only for their historic value, but also for their engineering significance.

<doc id="297648" wikidata="Q997470" url="?curid=297648" title="Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040">
<text>is a 1998 cyberpunk anime television series produced by AIC. It is a reboot of the 1987 OVA series &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot;, which focuses on the Knight Sabers, a rogue vigilante group made up of four women who use powered suits to fight rogue Boomer robots made by the megacorporation Genom.

&quot;Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040&quot; premiered on TV Tokyo on October 8, 1998, where it ran until its conclusion on March 31, 1999. Toshiba EMI released the series on VHS and Laserdisc across 13 volumes, each containing two episodes. The first volume was released on January 21, 1999; the final volume was released July 26, 2000. The series was later released on DVD, however the Japanese versions were simply the American DVD releases encoded to play for Region 2.

The series was positively received by critics, with some deeming it an improvement over the original OVA series.

== Plot ==
Like its predecessor, &quot;Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040&quot; takes place primarily in Tokyo. Much of the manual labor in the city is done by robots called Boomers, which are run by the high-tech mega-corporation Genom. 

While spending a night out, Linna Yamazaki, a new employee at the Hugh-Geit Corporation (a Genom subsidiary), observes a Boomer that has “gone rogue”, causing destruction and attacking people. Although the AD Police arrive stop the rogue Boomers, they struggle to restore order. Then, a renegade group called the Knight Sabers dressed in cybernetic, armored Hardsuits appear and save the day. Impressed by their work, Linna decides to join the group, which consists of: Priscilla “Priss” Asagiri, a rock star; Sylia Stingray, a boutique store owner and the group&#x27;s leader; and Nene Romanova, a computer hacker who also works within the AD Police as a dispatch operator, serving as the group’s mole in that organization.

Over the course of the series, the Knight Sabers go after rogue boomers, which frustrates AD Police officers Leon McNichol and his partner Daley Wong. Genom is also frustrated by their actions as their chairman, Quincy Rosenkreutz, and his advisor Brian J. Mason seek to unlock more boomer technology to defeat and capture the Knight Sabers. Later on, Sylia&#x27;s younger brother Mackie, who is part-boomer, joins the Knight Sabers as an assistant alongside their lead mechanic, Nigel Kirkland. Leon later pursues Priss with romantic intentions, and despite eventually learning that she is a member of the Knight Sabers, they both confess their feelings for one another anyway.

Mason uncovers and reactivates Galatea, a humanoid based on Sylia&#x27;s DNA who is able to control all boomers and wipe out the human race. The Knight Sabers’ hardsuits break down as a result of Galatea’s reactivation, and Sylia is forced to get Nigel and Mackie to build new ones based on liquid metal. Mason has Quincy killed and takes over Genom. He then cuts AD Police&#x27;s funding, resulting in a strike. Galatea&#x27;s influence causes boomers across Tokyo to go rogue, trapping the Knight Sabers and the AD Police officers inside their own buildings. The Japanese government then orders a complete evacuation of Tokyo, the AD Police are shut down, and the Knight Sabers are forced to use Nigel&#x27;s workshop as their new base of operations. Mackie later malfunctions and is presumed dead due to Galatea&#x27;s influence. Galatea then becomes too powerful for even Genom to control, as she subsumes Genom Tower and kills Mason. The Knight Sabers arrive to try to stop Galatea, but they are unsuccessful and Sylia suffers severe injuries from fighting her.

After retreating, Sylia retires from being an active member and sends Priss, Linna, and Nene to a Genom space station orbiting Earth to stop Galatea using the Motoslave that Nigel developed. As Galatea subsumes the space station, Linna and Nene are overwhelmed and are forced to retreat back to Earth, crash-landing on a deserted island. Priss then confronts Galatea, but Galatea’s influence causes her hardsuit to badly malfunction and transform into a boomer. Galatea then subjects Priss to extreme torture. However, Priss overcomes Galatea’s mental influence over her and summons the Motoslave, destroying Galatea, however she falls out into space afterwards. Galatea then uses the last of her strength to save Priss and send her back to Earth as a showing of respect. 

After Galatea&#x27;s defeat, Mackie is revived and reconciles with Sylia and Nigel. Linna and Nene are seen trapped on a deserted island without any clothes and both wonder if they&#x27;ll ever be rescued. Priss lands in a vast desert, and sings a song she had planned to perform with her band.

== Characters ==
Many of the characters are similar to those in the OVA series.

* 
:Priscilla &quot;Priss&quot; S. Asagiri is the strongest member of the Knight Sabers, specializing in heavy assault. The Japanese-American vocalist of an underground rock band, she lives in the slums of Tokyo in a trailer truck and is a distrustful loner who is rarely seen with her fellow Knight Sabers. A.D. Police officer Leon McNichol is attracted to her, but she initially mocks him. As the series progresses, her view changes as they both encounter each other in various dangerous situations and they help each other. She also begins to become more friendly with her fellow team mates, though she always retains some distance with them and is very protective of her privacy.
* 
:Linna was a farm girl who traveled to Megatokyo to become a Knight Saber and to get away from her overbearing family. She is the only member of the Sabers that is not a Hafu. She works for the Hugh-Geit Corporation, a Genom subsidiary, and is constantly harassed by her bosses and co-workers but continues to be a positive, friendly, and outgoing person who dreams of helping others. It was her confrontational tendencies and sense for justice which eventually got her admitted to the Knight Sabers. After joining the team, she forms a close sisterly relationship with Nene.
* 
:An enigmatic billionaire, and the founder of the Knight Sabers, Sylia is the daughter of Dr. Katsuhito Stingray, the man who invented Boomers. She is a Hafu of British descent. Implants in her brain were used to create both Galatea and Mackie and her brain patterns were used in the creation of Boomers thus strongly relating her to boomers, but she sees them as an abomination as her mother did. She acts as ground support for the Knight Sabers. She is in love with Nigel Kirkland, a sullen mechanic who was an engineer on the Boomer project who helped her design and build the hard suits. Sylia owns and operates an upscale clothing boutique called Silky Doll, which also serves as a front for the Knight Sabers HQ. Sylia suffers from regular flashbacks; most stem from her extremely complicated and disturbing childhood involving her mother&#x27;s death and the cruel experiments her father conducted on her. She rarely dons her hardsuit or enters combat.
* 
:An 18-year-old perky and naïve hacker who works as an operator for the AD Police, Nene is a genius with computers and routinely hacks into military networks. She is a Hafu of Russian descent. Nene was hired by Sylia after hacking her computer to try and learn more about the Knight Sabers. She primarily works on sensor ops, battlefield communications, ECM and ECCM. As the series progresses, Mackie develops a crush on her, despite the fact that she is three years older than him and part-boomer. The two eventually become good friends, with hints of a romantic relationship developing between them.
* 
: An AD Police officer from America, Leon is a frustrated but dedicated cop, with a tendency to rush in without thinking. Having worked his way up from the Normal Police, Leon sees himself as the protector of the local citizens and initially dislikes the vigilante nature of the Knight Sabers. He meets and becomes a big brother figure for Nene and falls in love with Priss. He is unaware of her being a Knight Saber until later in the series, but when he learns the truth he keeps it to himself. At the end of the series, Priss returns his feelings.
* 
:Daley is Leon&#x27;s partner, and a highly skilled investigator who actively questions the contradictory nature of the A.D. Police&#x27;s relationship with the Knight Sabers. He is Chinese-American and also openly homosexual, which is worth noting because at the time the original OVA was produced male homosexual characters were quite rare in anime. Towards the end of the series, he disappears without explanation, although it is likely that he chose to evacuate the city after he helps ensure that the boomer menace cannot spread any further.
* 
:A former Genom engineer from America, Nigel worked on the Boomer Project with Sylia&#x27;s father and Brian J. Mason, then later helped Sylia design and build the hard suits. Now a mechanic, he helps maintain the hard suits. He is romantically involved with Sylia, but because of his quiet, sullen nature he is called the &quot;man of a thousand grunts&quot; by other characters and his true feelings for Sylia are unknown. Macky becomes his protege and one of the few people Nigel seems to consider a friend. At the beginning of the series, Priss appears to be infatuated with him, though he does not react to her flirtations. However, he later creates a &quot;Motoslave&quot; (motorcycle that can transform into an exoskeleton for Priss&#x27;s hardsuit) specifically for her that, using Nigel&#x27;s voice, says it wishes to protect Priss. Both Priss and Sylia are attracted to Nigel, however, Nigel never showed preference for either one. However, Sylia was more emotionally desperate to have Nigel and Priss gave up on Nigel since she has Leon. Nigel would later build more advanced hardsuits based on liquid metal for the ladies in their battle against the boomers and eventually Galatea.
* 
:Mackie was initially introduced as Sylia&#x27;s younger brother, however, he&#x27;s actually a male doppelganger version of Sylia. Created by Sylia&#x27;s father, in his quest for advancing artificiality, Mackie is neither fully human nor boomer; he&#x27;s a prototype that was deemed too human and considered a failure. However, he wasn&#x27;t discarded and was kept around to be a false little brother to Sylia and she accepted Mackie as such. Mackie is depicted as being a naïve, inquisitive and awkward young man who loves machinery and computers; due to his artificial nature, he can never age and remains forever in his mid-teens form. After surviving the infamous earthquake, Mackie reunited with Sylia and walked right into her Knight Saber Operation. Although reluctant at Mackie&#x27;s infatuation with machinery and getting involved in her affairs, she eventually accepted it and allowed him to tag along with the Knight Sabers and eventually formed a good relationship with Nene and Nigel. As the series progresses, his origins was revealed as well as his connection with Galatea.
* 
:A ruthless corporate shark who works against the wishes of Chairman Quincy, Mason believes the human race should go away and that Boomers should become the new dominant species and uses Genom&#x27;s spaceborne solar generator and earthborne energy storage project to search for the underground laboratory that housed the Sotai project (Galatea). He once worked on that boomer project with Sylia&#x27;s father and Nigel Kirkland. Because of his traumatizing past, he is a bitter man. He adopted Galatea in hopes of using her. To fulfill his wish, in a manner he does not want, she changes him into a Boomer-Human hybrid, then fuses him into a wall to be hung up high above Megatokyo so that he can observe Galatea&#x27;s plans for Tokyo and the world.
* 
:The GENOM Chief Executive Officer, Quincy wishes for humans and Boomers to live together peacefully. Though suspicious of Mason&#x27;s activities, he believes he can control and maintain Mason. With his body badly decayed, he uses tubes and wires to keep him alive, afraid of using more advanced implants. Mason&#x27;s boomer secretary later kills him by disconnecting a vital cord in his life-support system. He shares his surname with Christian Rosenkreuz, legendary founder of the Rosicrucians.
* 
:Kuzui is a double-agent inside GENOM who passed information to Sylia in exchange for money, but was also aiding Mason in his search for Galatea. He is willing to sell his services to the highest bidder and states that he has no ethics. On Mason&#x27;s orders, he tells Sylia about the search for Galatea so that she could find it for Mason. Shortly afterwards, Mason has him killed.
* 
:Galatea is a secret Boomer Project started by Sylia&#x27;s father, Dr Stingray. She becomes the main antagonist of the series. It is revealed in flashback that she was grown from an implant inserted into a young Sylia&#x27;s brain against Sylia&#x27;s mother&#x27;s wishes, that Dr Stingray asked her to go into stasis when she started to function strangely and that she killed Dr Stingray while still complying and that Genon caused the great earthquake in order to seal her in and prevent her contaminating boomers for her own design. When she is initially seen, she has an appearance like that of a prepubescent Sylia. She is released from stasis by Mason and rapidly matures from her childlike appearance to an adult almost identical to Sylia. After her plans are revealed her hair turns black and her eyes change to red. Late in the series, her mind begins maturing and she begins questioning the meaning and purpose of her existence. At the end of the series, Priss helps her find her path, and Galatea, in turn, saves Priss&#x27;s life.

== List of Hardsuits ==
Hardsuits are powered battle armour developed by Sylia Stingray and Nigel Kirkland. Initially they are suits of armour that the four Knight Sabers step into while wearing body stockings as close contact with skin and &quot;plumbing&quot; connections are required. Sylia states that the reason there are no male Knight Sabers is because it was easier to find women who shared a similar shape to her than to redesign hardsuits for a different anatomy. After the original suits were lost, the replacement suits are instead applied to the naked women as a viscous liquid silver-coloured &#x27;biometal&#x27; that morphs into the coloured hardsuit. The new hardsuits and the Motoslave are revealed late in the series to be a form of Boomer, and the very first set of suits (not seen in the series) were all lost due to their wearers not being well suited for their use and that Sylia had to find people like her whose consciousness could meld with the Boomers&#x27; nascent consciousness (itself based on Sylia&#x27;s consciousness due to her father&#x27;s development process) in order to optimize their function. This requirement is revealed when the Knight Sabers receive psychic messages from Galatea and at times the four women are sometimes able to communicate telepathically. Sylia notes that the highly limited power supply of the hardsuits was to prevent them going rogue.

Priss&#x27;s Hardsuit is specifically designed for the alley-style, hit and run fighting tactics she prefers. Her red-accented dark blue suit&#x27;s main weapon is a set of &quot;knuckle bombs&quot;. These are essentially shaped-charge explosive devices on the knuckles of her gauntlets, with which she beats against a Boomer until she can tear inside where its &quot;core&quot; (its heart) resides and destroy it from the inside out. Until Linna&#x27;s arrival, Priss was the primary combatant of the team and it is her suit that is used in Linna&#x27;s first test simulation.

Linna&#x27;s hardsuit is a green color accented with orange trim, and is extremely maneuverable. As the newest suit of the group, it has some of the most advanced features, including a pair of long, ribbon-like cutters with nanometer-thick mono-molecular edges that can slice through almost anything. This newness is a double-edged sword however, for it fails on its first mission with almost tragic consequences for its owner. Linna&#x27;s suit also has heavily armored gauntlets, but she does not carry the knuckle bombs that Priss&#x27;s suit has.

Designed more for field support and data acquisition than for combat, Nene&#x27;s hardsuit is a reddish-pink and purple. Her weaponry includes a railgun that can shoot high sectional density armor-piercing metal spikes into her opponents, armored gauntlets, and an incredibly powerful computer system and scanner array that lets her handle almost any field intelligence operations required of her. Nene tries to prove herself as a fighter several times but overestimates her physical prowess and endangers herself and others. Eventually her suit is upgraded with several automatic functions that greatly increase her ability as a fighter.

Sylia&#x27;s Hardsuit is not often seen in the series, as Sylia does not engage in actual combat as often as the other Knight Sabers due to her health. However, when she does, her hardsuit is equipped with a retractable Katar (कटार) style sword blade that she uses to inflict fatal damage to any Boomer, and her combat style is even more savage and brutal than Priss&#x27;. Her suit is primarily a silver/white color with teal and pink accents. It also sports active stealth systems, and she is known to carry remote-detonating explosive charges.

== Media ==
=== Episode list ===
Each episode was named after an album or song by a rock/punk band. Many songs were also the title tracks of their respective albums and thus shared the same name as the album. The songs were never played in the episodes themselves. Two pieces of theme music are used for the series. The opening and ending themes, respectively titled &quot;y&#x27;know&quot; and &quot;Waiting for YOU&quot;, are performed by Akira Sudou.

The twenty-six episode anime series is directed by Hiroki Hayashi and features character designs by Hidenori Matsubara and Masaki Yamada. It premiered in Japan on October 7, 1998, and aired weekly until December 23, 1998. The remaining twelve episodes premiered on January 13, 1999, with new episodes airing weekly until the series concluded on March 31, 1999. Episodes 25 and 26 were unaired and instead along with the original video animations (OVAs), were released directly to VHS and laserdisc. The series was licensed for English-language broadcast and distribution in English by AD Vision and premiered their English dubbed version of the series on August 24, 1999.

As of November 3, 2010, the series has been re-licensed by Funimation, currently known as Crunchyroll.

== Reception ==
Critical reception of &quot;Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040&quot; has been generally positive, with some deeming it an improvement over the original OVA series.

Jason Bustard of THEM Anime Reviews gave the series a rating of 4 out of 5 stars, calling it a fitting tribute to the original &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot;. He praised the story, music, and character designs, deeming them an improvement upon the original series. He also praised the character development, stating that &quot;lots of detail went into humanizing the various cast members. From Nene&#x27;s snack habits, to Priss&#x27;s icy mercenary attitude, to Linna (best known from the original for her acrobatic green hardsuit) tripping all over herself the first time she tries on her suit, the characters shine with personality; a big improvement over the somewhat distant characters of the OVA.&quot;

Tim Henderson and Theron Martin of Anime News Network praised the series, with Henderson giving the series a B− rating, and stating that &quot;&quot;Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040&quot; is a difficult beast to heartily recommend, but it&#x27;s hardly a show to ward potential viewers away from either.&quot; Henderson praised the character designs, animation, and story, but criticized the opening episodes for being slow, and the ending for not being very original. Martin gave the series a higher rating of B+, praising the story, character designs, character development, soundtrack, and the English dub, but criticized the ending, stating that &quot;the pseudo-philosophizing which is especially prevalent near the end gets to be a little much.&quot;

<text>Sir Henry Sidney (20 July 1529 – 5 May 1586) was an English soldier, politician and Lord Deputy of Ireland.

==Background==
He was the eldest son of Sir William Sidney of Penshurst (1482 – 11 February 1553) and Anne Pakenham (1511 – 22 October 1544). William Sidney prominent politician and courtier during the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI, from both of whom he received extensive grants of land, including the manor of Penshurst in Kent, which became the principal residence of the family.

Henry Sidney was brought up at court as the companion of Prince Edward, afterwards King Edward VI, and he continued to enjoy the favour of the Crown, serving under Mary I of England and then, particularly, throughout the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. He was instrumental in the Elizabethan conquest of Ireland, serving as Lord Deputy three times. His career was controversial both at home and in Ireland.

==Career==

===First trip to Ireland===
In 1556, Sidney served in Ireland with the Lord Deputy, Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, who in the previous year had married his sister Frances. Both served Queen Mary until her death in 1558. Sidney played a large part in expanding the English administration in the country, which had shrunk over the centuries to the area around Dublin known as the Pale. He was also involved in the civil and military measures taken by his brother-in-law for bringing Irish chieftains into submission to the English Crown, known as Surrender and Regrant. In the course of the Lord Deputy&#x27;s expedition to Ulster in 1557, Sidney devastated the island of Rathlin. In the following year, during the absence of Sussex in England, he had sole responsibility for the government of Ireland and conducted himself with marked ability. A second absence of the Lord Deputy from Ireland, on the accession of Queen Elizabeth, threw the chief control into Sidney&#x27;s hands at the outbreak of trouble with Shane O&#x27;Neill, and he displayed great skill in temporising with the chieftain until Sussex reluctantly returned to his duties in August 1559. About the same time, Sidney resigned his office of Vice-Treasurer of Ireland on his appointment as president of the council of the Marches in Wales, and for the next few years, he resided chiefly at Ludlow Castle, with frequent visits to the court in London.

===In Scotland===
Queen Elizabeth sent Sidney to Scotland in July 1562. He was instructed to defer a meeting between Elizabeth and Mary, Queen of Scots to the next year. The Scottish queen was unhappy at the news and wept.

While he was with Mary Queen of Scots in the garden of Holyrood Palace there was an embarrassing incident. A Captain Hepburn came up to the queen and handed her a paper while she was talking to Sidney. She passed it to her brother, James Stewart, then Earl of Mar who opened it to discover four stanzas of obscene verse and a pornographic drawing. Meanwhile, Hepburn had fled to England. Mary was particularly affronted that Hepburn&#x27;s intervention occurred during her meeting with Sidney.

===Lord Deputy===

In 1565, Sidney was appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland in place of Sir Nicholas Arnold, who had succeeded the Earl of Sussex in the previous year. He said he found the English Pale to be in a more impoverished and turbulent condition than when he left it, and claimed the chief disturbing factor to be Shane O&#x27;Neill, Chief of the Name of Clan O&#x27;Neill. With difficulty he persuaded Elizabeth to sanction vigorous measures against O&#x27;Neill; and although the latter avoided a pitched battle, Sidney restored O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s rival Calvagh O&#x27;Donnell to his rights, and established an English garrison at Derry to prevent O&#x27;Neill expanding his influence.

In 1567, after being defeated by Clan O&#x27;Donnell at the Battle of Farsetmore, Shane surrendered himself to the Chief of Clan MacDonnell of Antrim, who immediately had O&#x27;Neill stabbed to death and beheaded during a feast at Cushendall as part of a secret agreement with Sidney. In the aftermath, Sidney turned his attention to the south, where he provoked a quarrel between Gerald FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Desmond, and Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormond, and he executed or imprisoned others he deemed to be disturbers of the peace; then, returning to Ulster, he compelled Turlough Luineach O&#x27;Neill, Shane&#x27;s successor as Chief of the Name, to make submission. Sidney placed garrisons at Belfast and Carrickfergus to dominate both Clan O&#x27;Donnell of Tír Eoghain and Clan MacDonnell of Antrim.

Sidney&#x27;s time as Lord Deputy is controversial, due to the fact that the government extended its campaign against not only Gaelic military opponents in the field of battle, but also killings against the general population of the peasantry at large. 
===Desmond Rebellions===
In the autumn of 1567, Sidney returned to England, and was absent from Ireland for the next ten months. On his return, he urged Lord Burghley to take measures to exploit what he saw as the potential of Ireland, to open up the country by the construction of roads and bridges, to replace the Irish clan system in Ulster with a system of freehold land tenure, and to repress the Gaelic customs prevalent in every part of the island. In 1569, he oversaw the opening of a parliament in Dublin, the first to be held for ten years. He proposed the establishment of the Court of Castle Chamber – an Irish version of the Star Chamber – which drew the encouragement of the Queen and was established after his recall.

Sidney proposed the appointment of a military governor (&quot;Lord President&quot;) in the provinces of Munster and Connacht. This provoked the first of the Desmond Rebellions led by James Fitzmaurice Fitzgerald of the Geraldine family, which had been put down with great severity by 1573. Sidney turned on the Hiberno-Norman Butlers in Ormond and Kilkenny, who had revolted against the opportunistic claims to their lands by Sir Peter Carew, an adventurer from Devon who pursued his entitlement with the blessing of the Dublin government. In 1570, many followers of Sir Edmund Butler were hanged, and three brothers of Thomas Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormonde, were attainted by an act of the Irish parliament.

Sidney left Ireland in 1571, aggrieved by the slight appreciation shown by Queen Elizabeth. In September 1575 he returned with greater royal authority, to find matters in a worse state than before. In Antrim the MacQuillan of the Route and Sorley Boy MacDonnell were the chief fomenters of clan warfare, and after pacifying this northern territory Sidney repaired to the south, where he was equally successful in making his authority respected. He left his mark on the administrative areas of the island by creating shire divisions on the English model.

At an earlier period, he had combined the districts of the Ardes and Clandeboye to form the county of Carrickfergus, and had converted the country of Clan O&#x27;Farrell into the County Longford. He then carried out a similar policy in Connacht, where the lands of Clan O&#x27;Brien in Thomond became County Clare, and the counties of Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Roscommon were also delimited.

Sidney also suppressed a rebellion headed by the earl of Clanricarde and his sons in 1576, and hunted Rory O&#x27;More to his death two years later. Sidney has also been implicated in the infamous atrocity against the seven Clans of Laois as the Massacre of Mullaghmast in 1578.

===The Cess Controversy===

Meantime Sidney&#x27;s annual levy (the cess), which was designed to fund a central government militia, had caused discontent among the gentry of the Pale, who sent a deputation of eminent barristers to London to carry their grievances in person to Queen Elizabeth. They were supported by several leading figures in the Irish Government, notably the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Sir William Gerard. Gerard&#x27;s defection was a bitter blow to Sidney, who for the previous five years had regarded Gerard as his indispensable ally, (&quot;my chief counsellor&quot;), and the resulting quarrel between the two men weakened Sidney&#x27;s position. The arguments that the cess policy was mistaken were ultimately successful: greatly to Sidney&#x27;s chagrin, the queen censured his conduct. He was recalled in September 1578, and was coldly received by Elizabeth.

===Coat of Arms===
These arms, which are shown within the Garter in the portrait, are the same as those which appear on Sir Henry&#x27;s Garter Stall Plate in St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor. The quarterings are blazoned and identified in 3 D 14, folio 236B. The first is Sidney, the second Clunford, the third Barrington, the fourth Mercy, the fifth Mandeville (the escarbuncle in the portrait is painted in a ghost-like way but it should be black), the sixth Chetwyn, the seventh Belhouse (the lions should be shown between three black cross-croslets), and the eighth Brandon (here the lion&#x27;s crown should be per pale Gules and Argent).

In the portrait, the porcupine in the crest should be blue with gold prickles, collar and line, as should the sinister supporter. The dexter supporter is simply the lion from the Brandon arms and should be so blazoned with a blue collar and line rather than a gold collar and chain.

===Later years===
From his position on the Privy Council in London, Sidney used his influence in the bloody suppression of the Second Desmond Rebellion, which led to a great loss of life in Munster in the period 1579–83, and ultimately to the plantation of the province with settler and planter families.

He lived chiefly at Ludlow Castle for the remainder of his life, performing his duties as president of the Welsh Marches.

==Marriage and family==
Sidney married Mary Dudley, eldest daughter of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, in 1551. They had three sons and four daughters. His eldest son was Sir Philip Sidney, and his second was Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester.

His daughter, Mary Sidney, married Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, and by reason of her literary achievements, was one of the most celebrated women of her time.

Richard Chancellor grew up in Sidney&#x27;s household.

<text>Sir Turlough Lynagh O&#x27;Neill (also known as Turlough Luineach) (Irish: &quot;Sir Toirdhealbhach Luineach mac Néill Chonnalaigh Ó Néill&quot;; c. 1532 – September 1595) was an Irish Gaelic lord of Tír Eoghain in early modern Ireland. He was inaugurated upon Shane O’Neill’s death, becoming &quot;The O&#x27;Neill&quot;. From 1567 to 1595, Sir Turlough Luineach O&#x27;Neill was leader of the O&#x27;Neill clan, the most powerful family in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland. He was knighted in 1578.

==Birth and ancestry==
Turlough was born around 1530 at &quot;Seanchaisleán&quot; (&#x27;Old Castle&#x27;), close to the modern town of Newtownstewart. He was the fourth son of Niall Connallagh O&#x27;Neill, Tanist of Tyrone (1519–1544), and was fostered by the O&#x27;Lunaigh family of Munterluney. As Tanist, Niall Connallach was designated to succeed his great-uncle Conn Bacach (1519–1559) as The O&#x27;Neill. Turlough&#x27;s mother may have been Niall Connellagh&#x27;s wife, Rose O&#x27;Donnell, the daughter of Manus O&#x27;Donnell, The O&#x27;Donnell of the neighbouring kingdom of Tyrconnell. Turlough was the grandson of Art Og McConn, The O&#x27;Neill (1513–1519), and was a direct descendant of Brian McNiall Roe, The O&#x27;Neill and ruler of Tír Eoghain (1238–1260).
==Tanist==
Turlough was Tanist of his uncle Shane O&#x27;Neill. Shane and Baron Dungannon contested for the title Earl of Tyrone. In 1562, both were ordered to attend the Court in London to present their cases to Queen Elizabeth I. Shane came to London, but while Lord Dungannon was travelling from Newry to Carlingford he was killed by Turlough, almost certainly on the orders of Shane.

==Turlough as O&#x27;Neill==
Making professions of loyalty to the Queen of England in the year following Shane&#x27;s assassination, Turlough sought to strengthen his position by alliance with the O’Donnells, MacDonnells and MacQuillans. In 1570 he killed Turlough MacSweeny in battle at Dún na Long on the Foyle. His conduct giving rise to suspicions, an expedition under The 1st Earl of Essex was sent against him, which met with such doubtful success that in 1575 a treaty was arranged by which O’Neill received extensive grants of lands and permission to employ three hundred Scottish mercenaries. A further treaty in 1578, negotiated by Lady Agnes, confirmed Turlough&#x27;s vast land holdings in Ulster, granted him a knighthood and the British titles of Earl of Clanconnell and Baron of Clogher, for life, and allowed him to retain for life the personal army of Scottish mercenaries negotiated three years before.
Still, at the outbreak of rebellion in Munster his attitude again became menacing, and for the next few years he continued to intrigue against the English authorities through clandestine alliances with Spain and Scotland, yet he maintained virtual control of Ulster until 1593, when he was forced by poor health and military setbacks to concede power to his principal rival, Hugh, brother of Brian, whom Turlough had assassinated in 1562 during Shane O’Neill&#x27;s absence at the court of Queen of England. Hugh was recognised by Turlough Luineach as captain of Tyrone, and as his Tanist, in 1593. During summer 1595 Hugh seized the last castle still held by Turlough Luineach, razed it, and drove him into the wilderness. He died in Strabane between 9 and 12 September 1595, and was buried at Ardstraw, probably at the Franciscan Friary founded by his ancestors.

Turlough Luineach had successfully survived as &quot;The O&#x27;Neill&quot; from 1567 until 1595, a turbulent quarter century that saw the most concerted efforts by the English administration to weaken and marginalise his authority in Ulster. He is frequently depicted by contemporary English historians as a weak, drunken buffoon, but his continued survival as the O&#x27;Neill through this period speaks of his considerable skill as a ruler and of a sustained policy of successful compromise.

==Patron of the Arts==
Turlough Luineach has the distinction of being one of the most highly praised rulers by the Gaelic poets and musicians of his time. His father Niall Connallach had been a celebrated patron of the arts and Turlough Luineach avidly followed his example. He sheltered Uilliam Nuinseann when the poet was accused of conspiracy in the Baltinglass rebellion of 1580.

==Family==
His second wife, Lady Agnes Campbell, was a daughter of The 3rd Earl of Argyll. One of his daughters was married, as his second wife, to Sorley Boy MacDonnell when he was past the age of eighty years. Another daughter was married to Sir Donnell O&#x27;Donnell, a leading figure in Tyrconnell until his death at the Battle of Doire Leathan in 1590. Turlough Luineach&#x27;s successor was his son Sir Arthur O&#x27;Neill, although Sir Arthur did not succeed him as head of the dynasty. During Tyrone&#x27;s Rebellion, Sir Arthur initially sided with his distant cousin, The Earl of Tyrone, but then switched sides and served with Sir Henry Docwra&#x27;s forces out of Derry until his death in 1600. Sir Arthur was then succeeded by his own son, Turlough O&#x27;Neill.

<text>The sestertius (: sestertii) or sesterce (: sesterces) was an ancient Roman coin. During the Roman Republic it was a small, silver coin issued only on rare occasions. During the Roman Empire it was a large brass coin.

The name &quot;sestertius&quot; means &quot;two and one half&quot;, referring to its nominal value of two and a half &quot;asses&quot; (a bronze Roman coin, singular &quot;as&quot;), a value that was useful for commerce because it was one quarter of a denarius, a coin worth ten &quot;asses&quot;. The name is derived from &quot;semis&quot;, &quot;half&quot; and &quot;tertius&quot;, &quot;third&quot;, in which &quot;third&quot; refers to the third &quot;as&quot;: the sestertius was worth two full &quot;asses&quot; and half of a third.

English-language sources routinely use the original Latin form &quot;sestertius&quot;, plural &quot;sestertii&quot;; but older literature frequently uses &quot;sesterce&quot;, plural &quot;sesterces&quot;, &quot;terce&quot; being the English equivalent of &quot;tertius&quot;. A modern shorthand for values in sestertii is IIS (Unicode 𐆘), in which the Roman numeral &quot;II&quot; is followed by &quot;S&quot; for &quot;semis&quot;, and the whole struck through; but because this symbol and striking through letters are not always convenient, HS may be used instead, with the horizontal bar of the &#x27;H&#x27; representing the strike through the numeral &quot;II&quot;, rather than the letter &quot;H&quot;.
==History==
The sestertius was introduced as a small silver coin valued at one-quarter of a denarius (and thus one hundredth of an aureus). A silver denarius was supposed to weigh about 4.5 grams, valued at ten &quot;asses&quot;, with the silver sestertius valued at two and a half &quot;asses&quot; (1.125 grammes). In practice, the coins were usually underweight.

When the denarius was retariffed to sixteen &quot;asses&quot; (due to the gradual reduction in the size of bronze denominations), the sestertius was accordingly revalued to four &quot;asses&quot;, still equal to one quarter of a denarius. It was produced sporadically, far less often than the denarius, through 44 BC.
In or about 23 BC, with the coinage reform of Augustus, the sestertius was reintroduced as a large brass denomination, while the &quot;as&quot;, now made of copper, was worth one quarter of a sestertius. Augustus tariffed the value of the sestertius as one hundredth of the gold aureus. The sestertius was produced as the largest brass denomination until the late third century AD. Most were struck in the mint of Rome but from AD 64 during the reign of Nero (AD 54–68) and Vespasian (AD 69–79), the mint of Lyon (&quot;Lugdunum&quot;), supplemented production.

The brass sestertius typically weighs in the region of 25 to 28 grams, is around 32–34 mm in diameter and about 4 mm thick. The distinction between bronze and brass was important to the Romans. Their name for brass was &quot;orichalcum&quot;, also spelled &quot;aurichalcum&quot; (echoing the word for a gold coin, aureus), meaning &#x27;gold-copper&#x27;, because of its shiny, gold-like appearance when the coins were newly struck (see, for example Pliny the Elder in his &quot;Natural History&quot; Book 34.4).

Orichalcum was considered, by weight, to be about double the value of copper. This is why the half-sestertius, the dupondius, was around the same size and weight as the bronze was, but was worth two asses.

Sestertii continued to be struck until the late third century, although there was a marked deterioration in the quality of the metal used and the striking even though portraiture remained strong. Later emperors increasingly relied on melting down older sestertii, a process which led to the zinc component being gradually lost as it burned off in the high temperatures needed to melt copper (zinc melts at 419 °C but boils at 907 °C, copper melts at 1085 °C). The shortfall was made up with bronze and even lead. Later sestertii tend to be darker in appearance as a result and are made from more crudely prepared blanks (see the Hostilian coin on this page).

The gradual impact of inflation caused by debasement of the silver currency meant that the purchasing power of the sestertius and smaller denominations like the dupondius and &quot;as&quot; was steadily reduced. In the first century AD, everyday small change was dominated by the dupondius and &quot;as&quot;, but in the second century, as inflation hit, the sestertius became the dominant small change. In the third century silver coinage contained less and less silver, and more and more copper or bronze. By the 260s and 270s the main unit was the double-denarius, the Antoninianus, but by then these small coins were almost all bronze. Although these coins were theoretically worth eight sestertii, the average sestertius was worth far more in plain terms of the metal it contained.

Some of the last sestertii were struck by Aurelian (270–275 AD). During the end of its issue, when sestertii were reduced in size and quality, the double sestertius was issued first by Trajan Decius (249–251 AD) and later in large quantity by the ruler of a breakaway regime in the West, named Postumus (259–268 AD), who often used worn old sestertii to overstrike his image and legends on. The double sestertius was distinguished from the sestertius by the radiate crown worn by the emperor, a device used to distinguish the dupondius from the &quot;as&quot; and the Antoninianus from the denarius.

Eventually, many sestertii were withdrawn by the state and by forgers, to melt down to make the debased Antoninianus, which made inflation worse. In the coinage reforms of the fourth century, the sestertius played no part and passed into history.

==Unit of account==

The sestertius was also used as a standard unit of account and was represented on inscriptions with the monogram HS. Large values were recorded in terms of &quot;sestertium milia&quot;, thousands of sestertii, with the &quot;milia&quot; often omitted and implied. The wealthy general and politician of the late Roman Republic, Crassus, who fought in the war to defeat Spartacus, was said by Pliny the Elder to have had &quot;estates worth 200 million sesterces&quot;.

A loaf of bread cost roughly half a sestertius, and a sextarius (c. 0.5 L) of wine anywhere from less than half to more than one sestertius. One modius (6.67 kg) of wheat in 79 AD Pompeii cost seven sestertii, of rye three sestertii, a bucket two sestertii, a tunic fifteen sestertii, a donkey five hundred sestertii.

According to Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Annals&quot;, book I, chapter 17.4 and 17.5, soldiers of the Rhine army who rose against Tiberius were paid ten &quot;asses&quot; a day, out of which they had to pay, among other things, for their own uniforms. They demanded to be paid a denarius a day, and they got it.

Records from Pompeii show a slave being sold at auction for 6,252 sestertii. A writing tablet from Londinium (Roman London), dated to –125 AD, records the sale of a Gallic slave girl called Fortunata for 600 denarii, equal to 2,400 sestertii, to a man called Vegetus. It is difficult to make any comparisons with modern coinage or prices, but for most of the first century AD, the ordinary legionary was paid nine hundred sestertii per annum, rising to twelve hundred under Domitian (81–96 AD), the equivalent of 3.3 sestertii per day. Half of it was deducted for living costs, leaving the soldier, if he was lucky enough to get paid, with about 1.65 sestertii per day.

==Numismatic value==

Early brass sestertii are highly valued by numismatists, since their large size gave engravers a large area in which to produce detailed portraits and reverse types. The most celebrated are those produced for Nero (54–68 AD) between the years 64 and 68 AD, created by some of the most accomplished coin engravers in history. The brutally realistic portraits of this emperor, and the elegant reverse designs, greatly impressed and influenced the artists of the Renaissance. The series issued by Hadrian (117–138 AD), recording his travels around the Roman Empire, depicts the Empire at its height, and included the first representation on a coin of the figure of Britannia; centuries later it was revived by English king Charles II, and continues to feature on the United Kingdom coinage.

As a result of ceasing production and withdrawals from circulation in the fourth century, sestertii are less common as a whole compared to other Roman bronze coins. Fully struck examples with sharp detail often command high premiums at auction.

<doc id="297661" wikidata="Q3079070" url="?curid=297661" title="Shane O'Neill (Irish chieftain)">
<text>Shane O&#x27;Neill (; 1530 – 2 June 1567) was an Irish chieftain of the O&#x27;Neill dynasty of Ulster in the mid-16th century. Shane O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s career was marked by his ambition to be the O&#x27;Neill—sovereign of the dominant O&#x27;Neill family of Tír Eoghain. This brought him into conflict with competing branches of the O&#x27;Neill family and with the English government in Ireland, who recognised a rival claim. Shane&#x27;s support was considered worth gaining by the English even during the lifetime of his father Conn O&#x27;Neill, 1st Earl of Tyrone (died 1559). But rejecting overtures from the 3rd Earl of Sussex, the lord deputy from 1556, Shane refused to help the English against the Scottish settlers on the coast of Antrim, allying himself for a short time instead with the MacDonnells, the most powerful of these settlers. Shane viewed the Scottish settlers as invaders, but decided to stay his hand against them with hopes of using them to strengthen his position with the English. However, tensions quickly boiled over and he declared war on the Scottish MacDonnell&#x27;s defeating them at the Battle of Glentaisie despite the MacDonnells calling for reinforcements from Scotland. The Scottish MacDonnells would later assassinate Shane O&#x27;Neill and collect the bounty on his head.









==Name==
The name &quot;Shane&quot; is an anglicisation of the Irish name &quot;Séan&quot; (John). Shane&#x27;s name is given in the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; (at M1567.2) as &quot;Sean mac Cuinn, mic Cuinn mic Enri, mic Eocchain&quot; (&quot;John son of Conn, son of Conn, son of Henry, son of Eoin&quot;). Elsewhere in the &quot;Annals&quot; (e.g. at M1552.7) he is referred to as &quot;Sean Donngaileach Ó Neill&quot;. This refers to the fact that as a youth he was fostered by his cousins, the O&#x27;Donnelly Clan, of which the Chief was Marshal of the O&#x27;Neill forces. This was rendered as anglicisations such as &quot;Donnolloh&quot; in contemporary manuscripts, and as &quot;John, or Shane Doulenagh O&#x27;Neil&quot; in Abbé MacGeoghegan&#x27;s 1758 &quot;History of Ireland&quot;. It would now be properly rendered as Donnellagh. After he assumed the leadership of the O&#x27;Neills, he was referred to simply as &quot;Ó Néill&quot; (&quot;The O&#x27;Neill&quot;).

The nickname &quot;Shane the Proud&quot; (), which appears in nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century popular histories, was coined sometime after his death by English writers, and originally had the pejorative meaning of &quot;arrogant&quot;, because they wished to portray him as vain, self-indulgent and ruthless, and thus undermine the legitimacy of his claim to the earldom of Tyrone. &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot; of 1587, for instance, had a side-note, &quot;The proud taunts of Shane O&#x27;neile&quot;, the text remarking that &quot;when the commissioners were sent to intreat with him vpon sundrie points, they found him most arrogant &amp; out of all good order, braieng out spéeches not méet nor séemelie.&quot; Later Irish writers, such as John Mitchel and P. J. O&#x27;Shea (&quot;Conán Maol&quot;) used the nickname with more positive connotations.

==Early life==
Shane was born in or just before 1530, to Conn Bacach O&#x27;Neill, chief of the O&#x27;Neills of Tyrone, and Sorcha O&#x27;Neill, daughter of Hugh Oge O&#x27;Neill, chief of the O&#x27;Neills of Clandeboye. Shane&#x27;s mother died while he was very young and Shane, following Gaelic custom, was fostered by the O&#x27;Donnelly family, who raised him until adulthood. As the youngest of Conn&#x27;s six sons, the fact that he was not sent to one of the great families for fostering suggests that he was not expected to achieve much status. He was briefly abducted in 1531 by a rival O&#x27;Neill family, but otherwise, nothing is known about his youth.

==Feuding within the O&#x27;Neill lordship==
The English, since the late 1530s, had been expanding their control over Ireland, this century-long effort is known as the Tudor conquest of Ireland. To incorporate the native Irish lordships, they granted English titles to Irish lords—thus making Conn Bacach O&#x27;Neill, Shane&#x27;s father, the first Earl of Tyrone. However, whereas in Gaelic custom the successor to a lordship was elected from his kinsmen in the system of Tanistry, the English insisted on succession by the first-born son or primogeniture. This created a conflict between Shane, who considered it his natural right to be head of his clan, and an &quot;affiliated son&quot; or adoptee of his father Conn Bacach, Matthew O&#x27;Neill or &quot;Fear Dorcha&quot; who was &#x27;conveniently mistaken&#x27; as the offspring of Conn when he travelled to London in 1542 to be invested with the Earldom of Tyrone. Feardorcha had accompanied Conn&#x27;s entourage as the Earl&#x27;s eldest son Phelim Caoch O&#x27;Neill had been killed by his enemy Gillespic MacDonnell during a raid in Ulster shortly before Conn&#x27;s inauguration visit. Gillespic MacDonnell&#x27;s family were noted as committed adherents of Feardorcha and his descendants.

During his trip to the English court to receive the title of earl of Tyrone, Shane&#x27;s father Conn Bacach, who had just lost his eldest son and was in open conflict with his surviving sons, was accompanied by the fosterling Mathew (known as &quot;Feardorcha&quot; in Irish), a youth who, until he was sixteen had been acknowledged as the son of a Dundalk blacksmith. Feardorcha&#x27;s mother Alison Kelly was Conn Bacach&#x27;s lover.

When Conn was created earl of Tyrone, Mathew was declared to be Conn&#x27;s heir in English law, disinheriting all of Conn&#x27;s surviving sons, including Shane. Under English law, Mathew, titled Baron of Dungannon from Conn&#x27;s principal house in Tyrone, was intended to succeed him as 2nd Earl of Tyrone. However, Mathew was ambushed and killed by Shane&#x27;s foster brothers, the O&#x27;Donnelly, in 1558, some months before the death of Conn Bacach, and the claim to the earldom passed to Brian, Mathew&#x27;s eldest son, who was later killed in 1562 in a skirmish with Turlough Luineach.

The claim to the earldom now passed to Mathew&#x27;s next son Hugh O&#x27;Neill who had been removed to England by Sir Henry Sidney in 1559 and was brought up there while Shane established his supremacy in Ulster; some sources say it was to the Pale that he was removed.

==Becoming the O&#x27;Neill==
Shane was inaugurated as the O&#x27;Neill. In English law, this was an illegal usurpation of the rulership of Ulster. But according to Brehon law succession (tanistry), Shane had every claim to be chief of the name. The case for Mathew&#x27;s disqualifying status under both English and Irish law, as an affiliated member of the family rather than as an actual son of Conn Bacach, was carefully stated by Shane when he made his own claim to the title of Earl of Tyrone both before and during his visit to Queen Elizabeth in 1562, and restated in some detail by the English authorities when Hugh O&#x27;Neill was outlawed during the Nine Years&#x27; War.

==Relationship with the English==
Although the O&#x27;Neill had allied himself against the English with the Scottish MacDonnell clan, who had settled in Antrim, Queen Elizabeth I, on succeeding to the English throne in 1558, was inclined to come to terms with the O&#x27;Neill, who after his father&#x27;s death functioned as &quot;de facto&quot; head of the dynasty. She accordingly agreed to recognise his claims to the lordship, throwing over Brian O&#x27;Neill, son of the assassinated Feardorcha, Baron of Dungannon, if the O&#x27;Neill would submit to her authority and that of her deputy. O&#x27;Neill refused to put himself in the power of the Earl of Sussex, Thomas Radclyffe, without a guarantee for his safety; and so Elizabeth decided to establish Brian in his place.

An attempt by Sussex to increase the enmity of the O&#x27;Donnells against the O&#x27;Neill was frustrated by his seizure of Calvagh O&#x27;Donnell in a monastery. Elizabeth, whose prudence and parsimony were averse to so formidable an undertaking as the complete subjugation of the powerful O&#x27;Neill, desired peace with him at almost any price. Elizabeth&#x27;s faith in Sussex&#x27;s aggressive strategy diminished when the repeated annual devastations of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s territory by the Lord Deputy with sizeable and expensive armies failed to bring him to submission.

The O&#x27;Neill destroyed the greater part of Sussex&#x27;s invasion army at the Battle of the Red Sagums, 18 July 1561, while Sussex was deep in O&#x27;Neill-controlled territory garrisoning Armagh with a small body of men. Afterwards, Elizabeth sent the Earl of Kildare to arrange terms with the O&#x27;Neill, who was demanding a complete withdrawal of the English from his territory. Unable to succeed against O&#x27;Neill in battle, Sussex tried in 1561 to assassinate him using poisoned wine. The O&#x27;Neill now called the lord deputy to account for his unnatural enmity, as displayed in this most recent of many attempts on his life.

Elizabeth consented to treat, and hostilities ceased on terms that gave the O&#x27;Neill practically all his demands. The O&#x27;Neill offered some concessions, most significantly consenting to present himself before Elizabeth in London to argue his case against Sussex and the Baron of Dungannon in person. The O&#x27;Neill requested the hand of Sussex&#x27;s half-sister Lady Frances Radclyffe in marriage as an earnest of future friendship. Accompanied by the Earls of Ormonde and Kildare as surety for his safety, the O&#x27;Neill reached London on 4 January 1562. William Camden describes the wonder which his gallowglasses occasioned in the English capital, with their heads bare, their long hair falling over their shoulders and clipped short in front above the eyes, and clothed in saffron-dyed shirts of fine linen.

Elizabeth was less concerned with the respective claims of Shane O&#x27;Neill and the Baron of Dungannon, the former resting on Gaelic law, the latter on an English patent, than with the question of policy involved. Characteristically, she temporised; but fearing that Shane could become a tool of Spanish intriguers, she permitted him to return to Ireland, recognising him as The O&#x27;Neill. (Elizabeth&#x27;s recognition of his claim to the title the O&#x27;Neill was meaningless, except symbolically, as she had no authority to confirm a title conferred under Brehon law.)

During this visit, Shane&#x27;s legal claim to his father Conn Bacach&#x27;s earldom was verbally confirmed and Shane was led to believe that he would be recognised as the 2nd Earl of Tyrone, though some reservation was made of the possible future rights of Hugh O&#x27;Neill, who had succeeded his brother Brian as Baron of Dungannon. Brian had been killed in a skirmish in April 1562 by Shane&#x27;s tanist, Turlough Lynagh O&#x27;Neill. However, confirmation of the grant of the earldom was never delivered, and the O&#x27;Neill was compelled to defend his hegemony in Ulster when his onetime supporter Sir Henry Sidney was appointed Lord Deputy and resurrected Sussex&#x27;s policy of undermining the O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s authority.

==War in Ulster==
There were at this time three powerful contemporary members of the O&#x27;Neill dynasty in Ireland—Shane O&#x27;Neill himself, Sir Turlough and Brian, 1st Baron of Dungannon. Turlough had been elected tanist (successor) when Shane was inaugurated as the O&#x27;Neill, and hoping to supplant him. During Shane&#x27;s absence in London, Turlough assassinated his principal rival, Mathew&#x27;s eldest son Brian, during the O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s absence when rumours of his imprisonment began to circulate. On return to Ireland, the O&#x27;Neill quickly re-established his authority, and, in spite of Sussex&#x27;s protestations, renewed his battle with the O&#x27;Donnells and the MacDonnells to force them to recognise O&#x27;Neill hegemony in Ulster.

In turning his hand against the MacDonnells, Shane O&#x27;Neill claimed that he was serving the Queen of England in harrying the Scots. He fought an indecisive battle with Sorley Boy MacDonnell near Coleraine in 1564, and the following Easter hosted his entire army at Feadan above Newry. Marching north at unprecedented speed, the O&#x27;Neill surprised the MacDonnells, who had expected him to intervene against an incursion by James MacDonnell of Dunnyveg&#x27;s own household troops who had landed in Lecale. While James MacDonnell of Dunnyveg and his brothers rapidly assembled an army in Scotland, the O&#x27;Neill defeated Sorley Boy MacDonnell&#x27;s local levies at Knockboy above Broughshane, crossed the Antrim mountains by way of Clogh and after burning James&#x27;s new castle at Redbay, pursued the remains of Sorley&#x27;s army and the recently landed army under James to the neighbourhood of Ballycastle, where he routed the MacDonnells at the Battle of Glentaisie and took Sorley&#x27;s and his badly wounded brother James prisoner.

This victory greatly strengthened Shane O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s position, and Sir Henry Sidney, who became lord deputy in 1565, declared to the earl of Leicester that &quot;Lucifer himself was not more puffed up with pride and ambition than O&#x27;Neill&quot;. The O&#x27;Neill ravaged the Pale, failed in an attempt on Dundalk, made a truce with the MacDonnells, and sought help from the Earl of Desmond. The English invaded Donegal and restored O&#x27;Donnell.

==Wives==
The custom among the nobility of sixteenth-century Ireland was for marriage to be undertaken to cement political alliances between powerful or enemy families. If the alliance fell apart, the wife could return to her father in a form of political divorce. All Shane&#x27;s marriages were of this type. His first wife was Catherine, the daughter of James MacDonald of Dunnyveg, Lord of the Isles. The O&#x27;Neill married Catherine while the MacDonnells were providing him with military support during the 1550s to contest the Lordship of Tyrone with his father Conn Bacach, at the time the O&#x27;Neill.

The O&#x27;Neill divorced Catherine to forge an alliance with the O&#x27;Donnells of Tyrconnell. He married Mary, a daughter of the Lord of Tyrconnell, Calvagh O&#x27;Donnell. Mary&#x27;s brother&#x27;s open hostility to the alliance led to the O&#x27;Neill rejecting Mary. In the ensuing conflict, the O&#x27;Neill captured and imprisoned her father Calvagh O&#x27;Donnell.

Calvagh was married to Catherine, the Dowager Countess of Argyll and daughter of Hector Mor MacLean of Clan MacLean of Duart on the Scottish island of Mull. Catherine was also the former wife of Archibald Campbell, 4th Earl of Argyll, whose favour could ensure Shane a ready supply of Highland &quot;Redshank&quot; mercenaries. Shane kept Calvagh imprisoned at Benburb and his island stronghold of Fuath na nGall (&quot;translation&quot;: &quot;Hatred of Foreigners&quot;) on the shore of Lough Neagh for many years. During Calvagh O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s imprisonment, this Catherine willingly became the O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s lover. Upon Calvagh&#x27;s eventual negotiated release, Catherine refused to accompany him, electing to stay with Shane. Her father, Hector Mor MacLean, came to Ireland and blessed her marriage with the O&#x27;Neill in 1563.

During the O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s visit to London in 1563, he requested that Queen Elizabeth should find him &quot;a well-born Englishwoman&quot; for a wife.

Between May and June 1567, while the O&#x27;Neill was attempting to negotiate a military alliance with the MacDonnells in the wake of his catastrophic defeat at Battle of Farsetmore, he discussed the possibility of divorcing Catherine MacLean to marry his current lover, Agnes Campbell, widow of James MacDonald; the O&#x27;Neill had captured her with her husband at the Battle of Glentasie in 1565. Agnes was the illegitimate sister of Catherine&#x27;s earlier husband, the Earl of Argyll.

The O&#x27;Neill was, however, still married to Catherine on 2 June 1567, the day of his assassination at Castle Cara, Cushendun, at the hands of a MacDonnell group with whom he was negotiating possible military aid. Catherine and her children had accompanied the O&#x27;Neill and his entourage to the MacDonnell camp at Castle Cara below Ballyterrim, and after his assassination they fled across the river Bann to the forest of Glenconkeyne, where they were protected by a lord of the Clandeboye O&#x27;Neills. Catherine made her way to safety at Duart Castle, where her brother fostered the youngest of Shane&#x27;s children, those who had been born to his sister, while offering protection to the other MacShanes.

==Descendants: the Mac Shanes==
Shane had at least ten sons by his wives, as well as possible other offshoots. Many of them were fostered in O&#x27;Neill relations and vassals after their father&#x27;s death, and they became the rival force to Hugh O&#x27;Neill in his climb to power in the 1580–1600 time frame.

His children with Catherine MacDonnell were:
*Shane Og. He was tanist to Turlough Luineach, in 1579, and was killed by the O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s after an unsuccessful raid in Breifne in 1581.
*Henry MacShane O&#x27;Neill, whose mother was Catherine MacDonnell. Father of Sir Henry Ó Néill and Con Boy McHenry. Perhaps the most famous of Shane&#x27;s sons, he was given a large Estate in Orior County, Armagh. He died in 1622.
*Turlough, whose mother was Catherine MacDonnell of the Route. He died in 1598.
His children with Catherine MacLean were:
*Cormac, whose mother was Catherine MacLean, stayed with his brother Hugh MacShane, as did his son Cormac Boy (Buidhe). He died after 1603.
*Hugh Gaveloch, the most popular of the Mac Shanes, led an army of his McLean kinsmen into Ulster to support his claim to the O&#x27;Neill Mór title, but was captured and hanged by his first cousin, Hugh, Earl of Tyrone. He died in January 1590.
*Art, whose mother was Catherine MacLean; he died of exposure after escaping from English captivity in a heroic trek from Dublin Castle through snow-covered Dublin and Wicklow with Red Hugh O&#x27;Donnell at Christmas 1592.
*Brian Laighneach, whose mother was Catherine MacLean. He died after 1598.
His children of unknown parentage were:
*Edmond, died fighting against Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone.
*Conn MacShane O&#x27;Neill, whose mother was either Catherine MacLean or the daughter of Shane Óg Maguire. He invaded Ulster in 1583 with 3,000 Scottish soldiers and was named Tanist of the O&#x27;Neill, Turlough Luineach, in the 1580s. During the Nine Years&#x27; War he fought against his cousin the earl and was given a large estate () and the manor lordship of Clabbye in Fermanagh. He played a part in Ulster politics until his death in 1630/1. Two of his grandsons were made Spanish counts.
*Niall, whose mother is thought to have been Catherine O&#x27;Donnell.
*Rose, who married Conn O&#x27;Donnell of Lifford.

Possible:
*Hugh McShane O&#x27;Neill, whose mother was Catherine MacLean, became chief of the O&#x27;Neill sept inside Glenconkeyne forest. Hugh&#x27;s parentage is however uncertain. Several other McShanes are listed in pardons issued by letters patent on 20 October 1609, with one listed as being &quot;McShane McOwen&quot;, suggesting that their Shane was the son of an Owen O&#x27;Neill rather than Conn Bacagh.

==Defeat and death==
Failing in an attempt to arrange terms, and also in obtaining the help which he solicited from France, the O&#x27;Neill was utterly routed by the O&#x27;Donnells again at the Battle of Farsetmore near Letterkenny; and seeking safety in flight, he threw himself on the mercy of his enemies, the MacDonnells. Attended by a small body of gallowglass, and taking his prisoner Sorley Boy with him, he presented himself among the MacDonnells near Cushendun, on the Antrim coast, hoping to propose an alliance. Here, on 2 June 1567, he was killed by the MacDonnells, and his headless body was buried at Crosskern Church at Ballyterrim above Cushendun. His body was possibly later moved to Glenarm Abbey. Unbeknownst to Shane, the Scots had already come to an agreement with Henry Sidney and William Piers, seneschal of Clandeboye, commander of the English garrison at Carrickfergus. The English Government tried to pass this off as a &quot;drunken brawl&quot; turned savage. Piers travelled to Cushendun to take Shane&#x27;s head and send it to Dublin Castle.

In his private character, Shane O&#x27;Neill was presented by the English as a brutal, uneducated savage. However, Irish history is often written by English historians. O&#x27;Neill had talent as a politician and tactician. Calvagh O&#x27;Donnell, when Shane&#x27;s prisoner, claimed he was subjected to continual torture. However, Calvagh&#x27;s wife, Catherine, the dowager Countess of Argyle, became his lover; Shane married her in 1563 and had several children by her. He frustrated his English opponents with his ability to defeat them in the field and then again at court. His death was greeted with delight by his enemies in London.

Shane was succeeded as the O&#x27;Neill by his tainiste, Turlough Luineach O&#x27;Neill, who married Agnes Campbell, widow of Lord James MacDonald of Dunyveg and Kintyre and daughter of Archibald Campbell, 4th Earl of Argyll some years after the assassination. Two of his sons became tanists to Turlough Luineach in his attempts to neutralise Hugh, Earl of Tyrone. The Church of Ireland Bishop of Clogher, Miler Magrath, said &quot;the people [of Ulster] adhere to the MacShanes, whom they consider the true branch of Conn Bacach&#x27;s line&quot;, but with their arch-enemy Hugh O&#x27;Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone, entering into warfare with the outbreak of the Nine Years&#x27; War the MacShanes were compelled to support Hugh&#x27;s enemy, the Dublin administration, and their support in Tyrone withered.

==Cultural recognition==
Antrim GAA has a Gaelic Athletic Association club named in his honour, Shane O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s GAC, founded by the solicitor and antiquarian Francis Joseph Bigger. It is situated on the outskirts of Glenarm village in Feystown and has over 100 members. Shane O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s hurling club was the first official GAA club in Glenarm, founded in 1903 using land donated by the Gibson family of the Libbert, Glenarm. Arthur and Dan Gibson went on to represent County Antrim. There is also a Shane O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s GAC in Camloch, County Armagh.

A cairn was raised at his reputed burial place above Cushendun by the antiquarian Francis Joseph Bigger in 1908 and yearly commemorations were held in Shane&#x27;s honour between that date and 1914. The poet Robinson Jeffers visited the site in 1929 and refers to Shane&#x27;s Cairn in several poems in the sequence &quot;Descent to the Dead&quot;, inspired by his pilgrimage to Ireland.

<text>Conn Bacagh O&#x27;Neill, 1st Earl of Tyrone (; – July 1559) was an Irish lord who ruled over Tyrone from 1519 to 1558. In 1541 O&#x27;Neill travelled to England to submit to Henry VIII as part of the surrender and regrant policy that coincided with the creation of the Kingdom of Ireland. He was made Earl of Tyrone, but his plans to pass the title and lands on to a chosen successor Matthew were thwarted by a violent succession dispute that led to another son, Shane O&#x27;Neill, emerging triumphant.

His grandson Hugh O&#x27;Neill eventually succeeded him as Earl and became head of the O&#x27;Neill of Tyrone dynasty. Hugh continued his grandfather&#x27;s alliance with the Crown until his eventual leadership of Tyrone&#x27;s Rebellion and later Flight of the Earls led to the collapse of the power of the traditional Irish lords in Ulster.

Conn&#x27;s epithet of bacagh () meant &quot;the lame&quot;.

==Biography==
Conn Bacach O&#x27;Neill was the son of Conn Mór O&#x27;Neill, king of Tyrone, and Lady Eleanor Fitzgerald. Con Mor O&#x27;Neill was the son of Henry O&#x27;Neill, king of Tyrone. Lady Eleanor Fitzgerald was the daughter of Thomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Kildare. Conn Mór O&#x27;Neill was murdered in 1493 by his younger brother, Henry Óg O&#x27;Neill. Conn Bacach killed his uncle, Henry Óg, 21 July 1498.

==Becoming The O&#x27;Neill==
In 1519, Conn Bacach succeeded his half-brother, Art Oge O&#x27;Neill, as chief of the Tír Eoghain branch of the O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s (Cenél nEógain). The English referred to these O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s as &quot;O&#x27;Neill Mor&quot; to differentiate them from the ruler of the O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s of Clandeboye who was styled &quot;O&#x27;Neill Boy&quot;. When his kinsman, the Earl of Kildare became viceroy in 1524, O&#x27;Neill consented to act as his swordbearer in ceremonies of state; but his allegiance was a personal matter, and while ready enough to give verbal assurances of loyalty, he could not be persuaded to readily give hostages to later lord Deputies as security for his conduct.

==Threat of excommunication==
By 1534, several excommunications had been pronounced against Conn by the archbishop of Armagh. That year diverse followers of Conn raided the archepiscopal manor in Armagh, inflicting harm on its custodian, Senekin McDugan, with Conn ordering the revenues to be paid to the excommunicated clergyman John O&#x27;Corr and his brethren. Conn had previously been invoked by the primate as the secular arm in ensuring that no harm came to Senekin McDugan amongst other items, with excommunication and interdict amongst the results of failing to.

A letter dated 16 February remarking on the events has the archbishop given Conn six days to have the &quot;delinquents&quot; reconcile and make satisfaction for the harm they have done otherwise he be likewise declared excommunicated for the six days following and all places he betook to placed under interdict until the archbishop ordered otherwise.

==Invasion and submission==
With the attainder of the Earl of Kildare and following rebellion, Conn sided with his in-laws the FitzGeralds. An alliance referred to as the Geraldine League sought the restoration of the heir of the FitzGerald lordship without interference from King Henry VIII of England. That rebellion was stoked by the idea of casting off England&#x27;s Protestant church in Ireland. In 1539 Conn Bacagh and Manus O&#x27;Donnell attacked The Pale. They were returning to their territories with treasure and spoils when Lord Deputy Leonard Grey overtook them at the Ford of Belahoe, south of Carrickmacross. The O&#x27;Neills and O&#x27;Donnells were quickly overwhelmed and suffered 400 casualties before fleeing in disarray and leaving their treasure and spoil.

After Tyrone was invaded in 1541 by Sir Anthony St Leger, the lord deputy, Conn and the Geraldine League were defeated and he made his submission. Conn delivered up his son Phelim Caoch O&#x27;Neill as a hostage. In early 1542, Phelim was killed with one cast of a javelin by MacDonnell gallowglass according to the entry recording his death in the Annals of the Four Masters of Ireland., just prior to his father&#x27;s submission to Henry VIII.

Conn attended a parliament held at Trim, and, crossing to England, became a Protestant, and made his submission at Greenwich to Henry VIII. Henry created him earl of Tyrone for life, and presented him with money and a valuable gold chain. He was also made a privy councillor in Ireland, and received a grant of lands within the Pale called Balgriffin.

==Civil war==
The appointment of his allegedly illegitimate son, Ferdoragh (Matthew), as Baron of Dungannon and as such his hereditary successor, caused deep resentment among the rest of his sons. Of these, it was Shane, Conn&#x27;s eldest surviving son, who was most favoured by the Irish custom of tanistry to succeed and so he went to war with his brother eventually having Ferdoragh killed in 1558. Conn Bacagh would die a year later, in July 1559. The next heir according to English succession was Ferdoragh&#x27;s son Brian, however, he was killed by his kinsman Turlough Lynagh O&#x27;Neill in 1562. After Brian&#x27;s death, the English administration took Ferdoragh&#x27;s last surviving heir, Hugh O&#x27;Neill, into custody to protect him. Shane, now O&#x27;Neill, had sought to be created Earl of Tyrone, however this was refused and the McDonnells killed him in 1567.

==Marriage and children==

Conn was twice married and had numerous sons. His first wife was Lady Alice Fitzgerald, daughter of Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare and Conn&#x27;s first cousin. Their son was Phelim Caoch O&#x27;Neill. &quot;Caoch&quot; was the nickname for someone with poor eyesight or &quot;the blind&quot;.

His second wife was Sorcha O&#x27;Neill, daughter of Hugh Oge O&#x27;Neill, chief of the O&#x27;Neills of Clandeboye. Sources differ in regards to the mother of Shane. Some stating he was the son of Conn and Sorcha and some stating he was from Conn and Lady Alice Fitzgerald.

Conn claimed an illegitimate son named Matthew or Ferdocha &quot;the dark one&quot; with Allison Kelly, the widowed wife of a blacksmith in Dundalk. Parenting aside, it was this Matthew that Conn designated as his heir to the English titles. He became the Baron of Dungannon when Conn became the Earl of Tyrone. This act caused great angst within the O&#x27;Neill clan and eventually led to civil war and the death of Matthew at the instigation of his half-brother Shane. As well an illegitimate daughter of Conn married the celebrated Sorley Boy MacDonnell, the man who eventually took part in the death of Shane O&#x27;Neill himself. His family spread throughout Ireland, Scotland, Europe and the New World during the downfall of the Gaelic Order, and today there are numerous families with a direct descent from Conn.

<doc id="297671" wikidata="Q1127799" url="?curid=297671" title="Dupondius">
<text>The dupondius (Latin &quot;two-pounder&quot;) was a brass coin used during the Roman Republic and Roman Empire valued at 2 &quot;asses&quot; (4/5 of a &quot;sestertius&quot; or 1/5 of a &quot;denarius&quot; during the Republic and 1/2 of a &quot;sestertius&quot; or 1/8 of a &quot;denarius&quot; during the time of Augustus).

The &quot;dupondius&quot; was introduced during the Roman Republic as a large bronze cast coin, although even at introduction it weighed less than 2 Roman pounds (&quot;librae&quot;). The initial coins featured the bust of Roma on the obverse and a six-spoked wheel on the reverse. A loaf of bread or a &quot;sextarius&quot; ( L) of wine cost roughly one &quot;dupondius&quot; at the height of the Roman Empire, though due to the debasement of the &quot;denarius&quot; over the following century, the &quot;dupondius&quot; was discarded.

With the coinage reform of Augustus in about 23 BC, the &quot;sestertius&quot; and &quot;dupondius&quot; were produced in a type of brass called orichalcum by the Romans and numismatists, while lower denominations were produced out of reddish copper. However, some &quot;dupondii&quot; were made entirely from copper under Augustus, while under Nero some &quot;asses&quot; were made from both orichalcum and copper, instead of only copper for &quot;asses&quot; coined until then. Therefore, the latter can only be distinguished from &quot;dupondii&quot; by their smaller size instead of by also the appearance of the metal.

The &quot;dupondius&quot; was normally further distinguished from the similarly sized &quot;as&quot; with the addition of a radiate crown to the bust of the emperor in 66 AD during the reign of Nero. Using a radiate crown to indicate double value was also markedly used on the &quot;antoninianus&quot; (double &quot;denarius&quot;) introduced by Caracalla and the double &quot;sestertius&quot;. Since &quot;dupondii&quot; minted prior to and during the reign of Nero, and occasionally under later rulers, lack the radiate crown, it is often hard to distinguish between the &quot;as&quot; and the &quot;dupondius&quot; due to heavy patina which often obscures the coin&#x27;s original color.

An extremely rare &quot;dupondius&quot; from the reign of Marcus Aurelius, dated to 154 or 155 and in excellent condition, was discovered in 2007 at the archaeological site in Draper&#x27;s Gardens, London.

<doc id="297672" wikidata="Q6498959" url="?curid=297672" title="Scale model">
<text>A scale model is a physical model that is geometrically similar to an object (known as the &quot;prototype&quot;). Scale models are generally smaller than large prototypes such as vehicles, buildings, or people; but may be larger than small prototypes such as anatomical structures or subatomic particles. Models built to the same scale as the prototype are called &quot;mockups&quot;.

Scale models are used as tools in engineering design and testing, promotion and sales, filmmaking special effects, military strategy, and hobbies such as rail transport modeling, wargaming and racing; and as toys. Model building is also pursued as a hobby for the sake of artisanship.

Scale models are constructed of plastic, wood, or metal. They are usually painted with enamel, lacquer, or acrylics.
Model prototypes include all types of vehicles (railroad trains, cars, trucks, military vehicles, aircraft, and spacecraft), buildings, people, and science fiction themes (spaceships and robots).

==Methods==
Models are built to scale, defined as the ratio of any linear dimension of the model to the equivalent dimension on the full-size subject (called the &quot;prototype&quot;), expressed either as a ratio with a colon (ex. 1:8 scale), or as a fraction with a slash (1/8 scale). This designates that 1 inch (or centimeter) on the model represents 8 such units on the prototype. In English-speaking countries, the scale is sometimes expressed as the number of feet on the prototype corresponding to one inch on the model, e.g. 1:48 scale = &quot;1 inch to 4 feet&quot;, 1:96 = &quot;1 inch to 8 feet&quot;, etc.

Models are obtained by three different means: kit assembly, scratch building, and collecting pre-assembled models. Scratch building is the only option available to structural engineers, and among hobbyists requires the highest level of skill, craftsmanship, and time; scratch builders tend to be the most concerned with accuracy and detail. Kit assembly is done either &quot;out of the box&quot;, or with modifications (known as &quot;kitbashing&quot;). Many kit manufacturers, for various reasons leave something to be desired in terms of accuracy, but using the kit parts as a baseline and adding after-market conversion kits, alternative decal sets, and some scratch building can correct this without the master craftsmanship or time expenditure required by scratch building.

==Purposes==

Scale models are generally of two types: &quot;static&quot; and &quot;animated&quot;. They are used for several purposes in many fields, including:

===Hobby===
Most hobbyist&#x27;s models are built for static display, but some have operational features, such as railroad trains that roll, and airplanes and rockets that fly. Flying airplane models may be simple unpowered gliders, or have sophisticated features such as radio control powered by miniature methanol/nitromethane engines.

====Slot car racing====

Cars in 1:24, 1:32, or HO scale are fitted with externally powered electric motors which run on plastic road track fitted with metal rails on slots. The track may or may not be augmented with miniature buildings, trees, and people.

====Wood car racing====

Children can build and race their own gravity-powered, uncontrolled cars carved out of a wood such as pine, with plastic wheels on metal axles, which run on inclined tracks.

The most famous wood racing event is the Boy Scouts of America&#x27;s annual Pinewood Derby which debuted in 1953. Entry is open to Cub Scouts. Entrants are supplied with a kit containing a wooden block out of which to carve the body, four plastic wheels, and four axle nails; or they may purchase their own commercially available kit. Regulations generally limit the car&#x27;s weight to , width to , and length to . The rules permit the cars to be augmented with tungsten carbide weights up to the limit, and graphite axle lubricant.

====Wargaming====

Miniature wargames are played using miniature soldiers, artillery, vehicles, and scenery built by the players.

===Television and film production===

Before the advent of computer-generated imagery (CGI), visual effects of vehicles such as marine ships and spaceships were created by filming &quot;miniature&quot; models. These were considerably larger scale than hobby versions to allow inclusion of a high degree of surface detail, and electrical features such as interior lighting and animation. For &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, a pre-production model of the Starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; was created in December 1964, mostly of pine, with Plexiglass and brass details, at a cost of $600. This was followed by a production model constructed from plaster, sheet metal, and wood, at ten times the cost of the first. As the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was originally reckoned to be long, this put the models at 1:344 and 1:83.9 scale respectively. The Polar Lights company sells a large plastic &quot;Enterprise&quot; model kit essentially the same size as the first TV model, in 1:350 scale (32 inches long). It can be purchased with an optional electronic lighting and animation (rotating engine domes) kit.

===Engineering===
====Structural ====
Although structural engineering has been a field of study for thousands of years and many of the great problems have been solved using analytical and numerical techniques, many problems are still too complicated to understand in an analytical manner or the current numerical techniques lack real world confirmation. When this is the case, for example a complicated reinforced concrete beam-column-slab interaction problem, scale models can be constructed observing the requirements of similitude to study the problem. Many structural labs exist to test these structural scale models such as the Newmark Civil Engineering Laboratory at the University of Illinois, UC.

For structural engineering scale models, it is important for several specific quantities to be scaled according to the theory of similitude. These quantities can be broadly grouped into three categories: &quot;loading&quot;, &quot;geometry&quot;, and &quot;material properties&quot;. A good reference for considering scales for a structural scale model under static loading conditions in the elastic regime is presented in Table 2.2 of the book &quot;Structural Modeling and Experimental Techniques&quot;.

Structural engineering scale models can use different approaches to satisfy the similitude requirements of scale model fabrication and testing. A practical introduction to scale model design and testing is discussed in the paper &quot;Pseudodynamic Testing of Scaled Models&quot;.

====Aerodynamic====

Aerodynamic models may be used for testing new aircraft designs in a wind tunnel or in free flight. Models of scale large enough to permit piloting may be used for testing of a proposed design.

====Architectural====


Architecture firms usually employ model makers or contract model making firms to make models of projects to sell their designs to builders and investors. These models are traditionally hand-made, but advances in technology have turned the industry into a very high tech process than can involve Class IV laser cutters, five-axis CNC machines as well as rapid prototyping or 3D printing. Typical scales are 1:12, 1:24, 1:48, 1:50, 1:100, 1:200, 1:500, etc.

===Advertising and sales ===
=== Military ===

With elements similar to miniature wargaming, building models and architectural models, a plan-relief is a means of geographical representation in relief as a scale model for military use, to visualize building projects on fortifications or campaigns involving fortifications.

In the first half of the 20th century, navies used hand-made models of warships for identification and instruction in a variety of scales. That of 1:500 was called &quot;teacher scale.&quot; Besides models made in 1:1200 and 1:2400 scales, there were also ones made to 1:2000 and 1:5000. Some, made in Britain, were labelled &quot;1 inch to 110 feet&quot;, which would be 1:1320 scale, but are not necessarily accurate.

==== Manned ships ====

Many research workers, hydraulics specialists and engineers have used scale models for over a century, in particular in towing tanks. Manned models are small scale models that can carry and be handled by at least one person on an open expanse of water. They must behave just like real ships, giving the shiphandler the same sensations. Physical conditions such as wind, currents, waves, water depths, channels, and berths must be reproduced realistically.

Manned models are used for research (e.g. ship behaviour), engineering (e.g. port layout) and for training in shiphandling (e.g. maritime pilots, masters and officers). They are usually at 1:25 scale.

==Materials==
Models, and their constituent parts, can be built out of a variety of materials, such as:

===Plastic===
This includes injection molded or extruded plastics such as polystyrene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), butyrate, and clear acrylic and copolyester (PETG). Parts can also be cast from synthetic resins.

===Wood===
Pine wood is sometimes used; balsa wood, a light wood, is good for flying airplane models.

===Metal===
Aluminum or brass can be used in tubing form, or can be used in flat sheets with photo-etched surface detail. Model figures used in wargaming can be made of white metal.

===Glue===
Styrene parts are welded together using plastic cement, which comes both in a thick form to be carefully applied to a bonding surface, or in a thin liquid which is applied into a joint by capillary action using a brush or syringe needle. Ethyl cyanoacrylate (ECA) aka &quot;super-glue&quot;, or fast-setting epoxy, must be used to bond styrene to other materials.

===Paint===
Glossy colors are generally used for car and commercial truck exteriors. Flat colors are generally desirable for military vehicles, aircraft, and spacecraft. Metallic colors simulate the various metals (silver, gold, aluminum, steel, copper, brass, etc.)

Enamel paint has classically been used for model making and is generally considered the most durable paint for plastics. It is available in small bottles for brushing and airbrushing, and aerosol spray cans. Disadvantages include toxicity and a strong chemical smell of the paint and its mineral spirit thinner/brush cleaner. Modern enamels are made of alkyd resin to limit toxicity. Popular brands include Testor&#x27;s in the US and Humbrol (now Hornby) in the UK.

Lacquer paint produces a hard, durable finish, and requires its own lacquer thinner.

Enamels have been generally replaced in popularity by acrylic paint, which is water-based. Advantages include decreased toxicity and chemical smell, and brushes clean with soap and water. Disadvantages include possibly limited durability on plastic, requiring priming coats, at least two color coats, and allowing adequate cure time. Popular brands include the Japanese import Tamiya.

Some beginner&#x27;s level kits avoid the necessity to paint the model by adding pigments and chrome plating to the plastic.

===Decals===
Decals are generally applied to models after painting and assembly, to add details such as lettering, flags, insignia, or other decorations too small to paint. Water transfer (slide-on) decals are generally used, but beginner&#x27;s kits may use dry transfer stickers instead.

====Trains====


Model railroading (US and Canada; known as &quot;railway modelling&quot; in UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland) is done in a variety of scales from 1:4 to 1:450 (T scale). Each scale has its own strengths and weaknesses, and fills a different niche in the hobby:
* The largest scales are used outdoors, for &quot;Live steam&quot; railroads with trains large enough for people to ride on, as much as longs are built in several scales such as 1-1/2&quot;, 1&quot;, and 3/4 inches to the foot. Common gauges are 7-1/2&quot; (Western US) and 7-1/4&quot; (Eastern US &amp; rest of the world), 5&quot;, and 4-3/4&quot;. Smaller live steam gauges do exist, but as the scale gets smaller, pulling power decreases. One of the smallest gauges on which a live steam engine can pull a passenger is the now almost defunct -inch gauge.
* The next largest scale range, G scale (1:22.5) in the US and 16 mm scale (1:19.05) in the UK, and as large as 1:12 scale, is too small for riding but is used for outdoor garden railways, which allow use of natural landscaping. G scale is also sometimes used indoors, with the track mounted adjacent to walls at eye level of standing adults. A franchise chain of restaurants and coffeehouses named Výtopna in the Czech Republic acquired a trademark for the use of G-scale trains mounted on the countertops to serve customers beverages, and pick up their orders and empty glasses.
* Smaller scales are used indoors. O scale (1:48) sets were introduced as early &quot;toy trains&quot; by companies such as Lionel Corporation, but has developed a following among serious adult hobbyists. American Flyer purchased by A. C. Gilbert Company popularized S scale (1:64) trains starting in 1946. Even smaller scales have become the most popular, allowing larger, more complex layouts to be built in smaller spaces. Dedicated model railroaders often mount indoor layouts on homemade plywood tables, at a height in the range of , putting the track optimally close to eye level for children or adults. As of 2022, the two most popular sizes are HO scale (1:87) and N scale (1:160).
=====Gauge vs scale=====
Model railroads originally used the term &quot;gauge&quot;, which refers to the distance between the rails, just as full-size railroads continue to do. Although model railroads were also built to different gauges, standard gauge in full-size railroads is 4&#x27; 8.5&quot;. Therefore, a model railroad reduces that standard to scale. An HO scale model railroad runs on track that is 1/87 of 4&#x27; 8.5&quot;, or 0.649&quot; from rail to rail. Today model railroads are more typically referred to using the term &quot;scale&quot; instead of &quot;gauge&quot; in most usages.

Confusion arises from indiscriminate use of &quot;scale&quot; and &quot;gauge&quot; synonymously. The word &quot;scale&quot; strictly refers to the proportional size of the model, while &quot;gauge&quot; strictly applies to the measurement between the inside faces of the rails. It is completely incorrect to refer to the mainstream scales as &quot;HO gauge&quot;, &quot;N gauge, &quot;Z gauge&quot;, etc. This is further complicated by the fact some scales use several different gauges; for example, HO scale uses 16.5 mm as the standard gauge of , 12 mm to represent gauge (HOm), and (HOn3-1/2), and 9 mm to represent a prototype gauge of .

The most popular scale to go with a given gauge was often arrived at through the following roundabout process: German artisans would take strips of metal of standard metric size to construct their products from blueprints dimensioned in inches. &quot;Four mm to the foot&quot; yielded the 1:76.2 size of the British &quot;OO scale&quot;, which is anomalously used on the standard HO/OO scale (16.5 mm gauge from 3.5 mm/foot scale) tracks, because early electric motors weren&#x27;t available commercially in smaller sizes. Today, most scale sizes are internationally standardized, with the notable exceptions of O scale and N scale.

There are three different versions of the &quot;O&quot; scale, each of which uses tracks of 32 mm for the standard gauge. The American version follows a dollhouse scale of 1:48, sometimes called &quot;quarter-gauge&quot; as in &quot;one-quarter-inch to the foot&quot;. The British version continued the pattern of sub-contracting to Germans, so, at 7 mm to the foot, it works out to a scale of 1:43.5. Later, the European authority of model railroad firms MOROP declared that the &quot;O&quot; gauge (still 32 mm) must use the scale of 1:45, to allow wheel, tire, and splasher clearance for smaller than realistic curved sections.

N scale trains were first commercially produced at 1:160 scale in 1962 by the Arnold company of Nuremberg. This standard size was imported to the US by firms such as the Aurora Plastics Corporation. However, the early N-scale motors would not fit in the smaller models of British locomotives, so the British N gauge was standardized to allow a slightly larger body size. Similar sizing problems with Japanese prototypes led to adoption of a 1:150 scale standard there. Since space is more limited in Japanese houses, N scale has become more popular there than HO scale.

====Aircraft====
Static model aircraft are commonly built using plastic, but wood, metal, card and paper can also be used. Models are sold painted and assembled, painted but not assembled (snap-fit), or unpainted and not assembled. The most popular types of aircraft to model are commercial airliners and military aircraft. Popular aircraft scales are, in order of increasing size: 1:144, 1:87 (also known as HO, or &quot;half-O scale&quot;), 1:72 (the most numerous), 1:48 (known as &quot;O scale&quot;), 1:32, 1:24, 1:16, 1:6, and 1:4. Some European models are available at more metric scales such as 1:50. The highest quality models are made from injection molded plastic or cast resin. Models made from Vacuum formed plastic are generally for the more skilled builder. More inexpensive models are made from heavy paper or card stock. Ready-made die-cast metal models are also very popular. As well as the traditional scales, die-cast models are available in 1:200, 1:250, 1:350, 1:400, 1:500 and 1:600 scale.

The majority of aircraft modelers concern themselves with depiction of real-life aircraft, but there are some modelers who &#x27;bend&#x27; history by modeling aircraft that either never actually flew or existed, or by painting them in a color scheme that did not actually exist. This is commonly referred to as &#x27;What-if&#x27; or &#x27;Alternative&#x27; modeling, and the most common theme is &#x27;Luftwaffe 1946&#x27; or &#x27;Luftwaffe &#x27;46&#x27;. This theme stems from the idea of modeling German secret projects that never saw the light of day due to the close of World War II. This concept has been extended to include British, Russian, and US experimental projects that never made it into production.
Flying model aircraft are built for aerodynamic research and for recreation (aeromodeling).

Recreational models are often made to resemble some real type. However the aerodynamic requirements of a small model are different from those of a full-size craft, so flying models are seldom fully accurate to scale. Flying model aircraft are one of three types: free flight, control line, and radio controlled. Some flying model kits take many hours to put together, and some kits are almost ready to fly or ready to fly.

====Rockets and spacecraft====
Model rocketry dates back to the Space Race of the 1950s. The first model rocket engine was designed in 1954 by Orville Carlisle, a licensed pyrotechnics expert, and his brother Robert, a model airplane enthusiast.

Static model rocket kits began as a development of model aircraft kits, yet the scale of 1:72 [V.close to 4 mm.::1foot] never caught on. Scales 1:48 and 1:96 are most frequently used. There are some rockets of scales 1:128, 1:144, and 1:200, but Russian firms put their large rockets in 1:288. Heller SA offers some models in the scale of 1:125.

Science fiction space ships are heavily popular in the modeling community. In 1966, with the release of the television show &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, AMT corporation released an model of the Starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;. This has been followed over the decades by a complete array of various starships, shuttlecraft, and space stations from the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. The 1977 release of the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film and the 1978 TV series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; also spawned lines of licensed model kits in scales ranging from 1:24 for fighters and smaller ships, to 1:1000, 1:1400, and 1:2500 for most main franchise ships, and up to 1:10000 for the larger &quot;Star Wars&quot; ships (for especially objects like the Death Stars and Super Star Destroyers, even smaller scales are used). Finemolds in Japan have recently released a series of high quality injection molded &quot;Star Wars&quot; kits in 1:72, and this range is supplemented by resin kits from Fantastic Plastic.

====Cars====
Although the British scale for 0 gauge was first used for model cars made of rectilinear and circular parts, it was the origin of the European scale for cast or injection molded model cars. MOROP&#x27;s specification of 1:45 scale for European 0 does not alter the series of cars in 1:43 scale, as it has the widest distribution in the world.

In America, a series of cars was developed from at first cast metal and later styrene models (&quot;promos&quot;) offered at new-car dealerships to drum up interest. The firm Monogram, and later Tamiya, first produced them in a scale derived from the Architect&#x27;s scale: 1:24 scale, while the firms AMT, Jo-Han, and Revell chose the scale of 1:25. Monogram later switched to this scale after the firm was purchased by Revell. Some cars are also made in 1:32 scale, and rolling toys are often made on the scale 1:64 scale. Chinese die-cast manufacturers have introduced 1/72 scale into their range. The smaller scales are usually die-cast cars and not the in the class as model cars. Except in rare occasions, Johnny Lightning and Ertl-made die-cast cars were sold as kits for buyers to assemble. Model cars are also used in car design.

====Buses and trucks====
Typically found in 1:50 scale, most manufacturers of commercial vehicles and heavy equipment commission scale models made of die-cast metal as promotional items to give to prospective customers. These are also popular children&#x27;s toys and collectibles. The major manufacturers of these items are Conrad and NZG in Germany. Corgi also makes some 1:50 models, as well as Dutch maker Tekno.

Trucks are also found as diecast models in 1:43 scale and injection molded kits (and children&#x27;s toys) in 1:24 scale. Recently some manufacturers have appeared in 1:64 scale like Code 3.

====Construction vehicles====
A model construction vehicle (or engineering vehicle) is a scale model or die-cast toy that represents a construction vehicle such as a bulldozer, excavator, crane, concrete pump, backhoe, etc.

Construction vehicle models are almost always made in 1:50 scale, particularly because the cranes at this scale are often three to four feet tall when extended and larger scales would be unsuited for display on a desk or table. These models are popular as children&#x27;s toys in Germany. In the US they are commonly sold as promotional models for new construction equipment, commissioned by the manufacturer of the prototype real-world equipment. The major manufacturers in Germany are Conrad and NZG, with some competition from Chinese firms that have been entering the market.

=== Robots ===

Japanese firms have marketed toys and models of what are often called mecha, nimble humanoid fighting robots. The robots, which appear in animated shows (anime), are often depicted at a size between 15-20m in height, and so scales of 1:100 and 1:144 are common for these subjects, though other scales such as 1:72 are commonly used for robots and related subjects of different size.

The most prolific manufacturer of mecha models is Bandai, whose Gundam kit lines were a strong influence in the genre in the 1980s. Even today, Gundam kits are the most numerous in the mecha modeling genre, usually with dozens of new releases every year. The features of modern Gundam kits, such as color molding and snap-fit construction, have become the standard expectations for other mecha model kits.

Due to the fantasy nature of most anime robots, and the necessary simplicity of cel-animated designs, mecha models lend themselves well to stylized work, improvisations, and simple scratchbuilds. One of Gundam&#x27;s contributions to the genre was the use of a gritty wartime backstory as a part of the fantasy, and so it is almost equally fashionable to build the robots in a weathered, beaten style, as would often be expected for AFV kits as to build them in a more stylish, pristine manner.

=== Live action figures ===

Scale models of people and animals are found in a wide variety of venues, and may be either single-piece objects or kits that must be assembled, usually depending on the purpose of the model. For instance, models of people as well as both domestic and wild animals are often produced for display in model cities or railroads to provide a measure of detail or realism, and scaled relative to the trains, buildings, and other accessories of a certain line of models. If a line of trains or buildings does not feature models of living creatures, those who build the models often buy these items separately from another line so they can feature people or animals. In other cases, scale model lines feature living creatures exclusively, often focusing on educational interests.

Model kits of superheroes and super-villains from popular franchises such as DC Entertainment and Marvel Entertainment are also sold, as are models of real-world celebrities, such as Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley.

One type of assembly kit sold as educational features skeletons and anatomical structure of humans and animals. Such kits may have unique features such as glow-in-the-dark pieces. Dinosaurs are a popular subject for such models. There are also garage kits, which are often figures of anime characters in multiple parts that require assembly.

=== Ships and naval war-gaming ===


Michele Morciano says small scale ship models were produced in about 1905 linked to the wargaming rules and other publications of Fred T. Jane. The company that standardized on 1:1200 was Bassett-Lowke in 1908. The British Admiralty subsequently contracted with Bassett-Lowke and other companies and individual craftsmen to produce large numbers of recognition models, to this scale, in 1914–18.

Just before the Second World War, the American naval historian (and science fiction author) Fletcher Pratt published a book on naval wargaming as could be done by civilians using ship models cut off at the waterline to be moved on the floors of basketball courts and similar locales. The scale he used was non-standard (reported as 1:666), and may have been influenced by toy ships then available, but as the hobby progressed, and other rule sets came into use, it was progressively supplemented by the series 1:600, 1:1200, and 1:2400. In Britain, 1:3000 became popular and these models also have come into use in the USA. These had the advantage of approximating the nautical mile as 120 inches, 60 inches, and 30 inches, respectively. As the knot is based on this mile and a 60-minute hour, this was quite handy.

After the war, firms emerged to produce models from the same white metal used to make toy soldiers. Lines Bros. Ltd, a British firm, offered a tremendously wide range of waterline merchant and naval ships as well as dockyard equipment in the scale 1:1200 which were die-cast in Zamak. In the US, at least one manufacturer, of the wartime 1:1200 recognition models, Comet, made them available for the civilian market postwar, which also drove the change to this scale. In addition, continental European manufacturers and European ship book publishers had adopted the 1:1250 drawing scale because of its similar convenience in size for both models and comparison drawings in books.

A prestige scale for boats, comparable to that of 1:32 for fighter planes, is 1:72, producing huge models, but there are very few kits marketed in this scale. There are now several clubs around the world for those who choose to scratch-build radio-controlled model ships and submarines in 1:72, which is often done because of the compatibility with naval aircraft kits. For the smaller ships, plank-on-frame or other wood construction kits are offered in the traditional shipyard scales of 1:96, 1:108, or 1:192 (half of 1:96). In injection-molded plastic kits, Airfix makes full-hull models in the scale the Royal Navy has used to compare the relative sizes of ships: 1:600. Revell makes some kits to half the scale of the US Army standard: 1:570. Some American and foreign firms have made models in a proportion from the Engineer&#x27;s scale: &quot;one-sixtieth-of-an-inch-to-the-foot&quot;, or 1:720.

=== Tanks and wargaming ===

Early in the 20th century, the British historian and science fiction author H. G. Wells published a book, &quot;Little Wars&quot;, on how to play at battles in miniature. His books use 2&quot; lead figures, particularly those manufactured by Britains. His fighting system employed spring-loaded model guns that shot matchsticks.

This use of physical mechanisms was echoed in the later games of Fred Jane, whose rules required throwing darts at ship silhouettes; his collection of data on the world&#x27;s fleets was later published and became renowned. Dice have largely replaced this toy mayhem for consumers.

For over a century, toy soldiers were made of white metal, a lead-based alloy, often in architect&#x27;s scale-based ratios in the English-speaking countries, and called tin soldiers. After the Second World War, such toys were on the market for children but now made of a safe plastic softer than styrene. American children called these &quot;army men&quot;. Many sets were made in the new scale of 1:40. A few styrene model kits of land equipment were offered in this and in 1:48 and 1:32 scales. However, these were swept away by the number of kits in the scale of 1:35.

Those who continued to develop miniature wargaming preferred smaller scale models, the soldiers still made of soft plastic. Airfix particularly wanted people to buy 1:76 scale soldiers and tanks to go with &quot;00&quot; gauge train equipment. Roco offered 1:87 scale styrene military vehicles to go with &quot;HO&quot; gauge model houses. However, although there is no 1:72 scale model railroad, more toy soldiers are now offered in this scale because it is the same as the popular aircraft scale. The number of fighting vehicles in this scale is also increasing, although the number of auxiliary vehicles available is far fewer than in 1:87 scale.

A more recent development, especially in wargaming of land battles, is 15 mm white metal miniatures, often referred to as 1:100. The use of 15 mm scale metals has grown quickly since the early 1990s as they allow a more affordable option over 28 mm if large battles are to be refought, or a large number of vehicles represented. The rapid rise in the detail and quality of castings at 15 mm scale has also helped to fuel their uptake by the wargaming community.

Armies use smaller scales still. The US Army specifies models of the scale 1:285 for its sand table wargaming. There are metal ground vehicles and helicopters in this scale, which is a near &quot;one-quarter-inch-to-six-feet&quot; scale. The continental powers of NATO have developed the similar scale of 1:300, even though metric standardizers really don&#x27;t like any divisors other than factors of 10, 5, and 2, so maps are not commonly offered in Europe in scales with a&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;in the denominator.

Consumer wargaming has since expanded into fantasy realms, employing scales large enough to be painted in imaginative detail - so called &quot;heroic&quot; 28 mm figures, (roughly 1:64 scale). Firms that produce these make small production lots of white metal.

Alternatively to the commercial models, some modelers also tend to use scraps to achieve home-made warfare models. While it doesn&#x27;t always involve wargaming, some modelers insert realistic procedures, enabling a certain realism such as firing guns or shell deflection on small scale models.

=== Engines ===
Kits for building an engine model are available, especially for kids. The most popular are the internal combustion, steam, jet, and Stirling model engine. Usually they move using an electric motor or a hand crank, and many of them have a transparent case to show the internal process in action.

=== Buildings ===


Most hobbyists who build models of buildings do so as part of a diorama to enhance their other models, such as a model railroad or model war machines. As a stand-alone hobby, building models are probably most popular among enthusiasts of construction toys such as Erector, Lego and K&#x27;Nex. Famous landmarks such as the Empire State Building, Big Ben and the White House are common subjects. Standard scales have not emerged in this hobby. Model railroaders use railroad scales for their buildings: HO scale (1:87), OO scale (1:76), N scale (1:160), and O scale (1:43). Lego builders use miniland scale (1:20), minifig scale (1:48), and micro scale (1:192) Generally, the larger the building, the smaller the scale. Model buildings are commonly made from plastic, foam, balsa wood or paper. Card models are published in the form of a book, and some models are manufactured like 3-D puzzles. Professionally, building models are used by architects and salesmen.

====House portrait====

Typically found in 1:50 scale and also called model house, model home or display house, this type of model is usually found in stately homes or specially designed houses. Sometimes this kind of model is commissioned to mark a special date like an anniversary or the completion of the architecture, or these models might be used by salesmen selling homes in a new neighborhood.

=== Miniatures in contemporary art ===

Miniatures and model kits are used in contemporary art whereby artists use both scratch built miniaturizations or commercially manufactured model kits to construct a dialogue between object and viewer. The role of the artist in this type of miniature is not necessarily to re-create an historical event or achieve naturalist realism, but rather to use scale as a mode of articulation in generating conceptual or theoretical exploration. Political, conceptual, and architectural examples are provided by noted artists such as Bodys Isek Kingelez, Jake and Dinos Chapman (otherwise known as the Chapman Brothers), Ricky Swallow, Shaun Wilson, Sven Christoffersen, or the Psikhelekedana artists from Mozambique, James Casebere, Oliver Boberg, and Daniel Dorall.

<doc id="297673" wikidata="Q744558" url="?curid=297673" title="HMS Sirius (1786)">
<text>HMS &quot;Sirius&quot; was the flagship of the First Fleet, which set out from Portsmouth, England, in 1787 to establish the first European colony in New South Wales, Australia. In 1790, the ship was wrecked on the reef, south east of Kingston Pier, in Slaughter Bay, Norfolk Island.

==Construction==
&quot;Sirius&quot; had been converted from the merchantman &quot;Berwick&quot;. There has been confusion over the early history of &quot;Berwick&quot;. A note about her by future New South Wales governor Philip Gidley King, describing her as a former &#x27;East country man&#x27;, was interpreted for many years as relating to the East Indies trade; however, analysis of the maritime nomenclature of the time suggests that this description referred instead to ships participating in the Baltic trade.

&quot;Berwick&quot; was likely built in 1780 by Christopher Watson and Co. of Rotherhithe, who also built another ship of the First Fleet, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. &quot;Berwick&quot; had a burthen of 511 tons (bm) and, after being burnt in a fire, was bought and rebuilt by the Royal Navy in November 1781, retaining her original name.

==As HMS &quot;Berwick&quot;==
The newly purchased vessel was fitted out and coppered at Deptford Dockyard between December 1781 and April 1782, for a total sum of £6,152.11s.4d. When completed she carried 10 guns, four 6-pounder long guns, and six 18-pounder carronades. She was commissioned for service under her first commander, Lieutenant Bayntun Prideaux in January 1782, and went out to North America later that year. She spent the last part of the American War of Independence there, transferring to the West Indies in June 1784. Paid off in February 1785 she was initially laid up before being fitted for sea between September and December 1786 for service with the First Fleet. She was nominally rated as a sixth-rate, allowing her to be commanded by a post-captain, though she retained her armament of only 10 guns, and on 12 October 1786 &quot;Berwick&quot; was renamed &quot;Sirius&quot;, after the southern star Sirius.

==Voyage of the First Fleet==
&quot;Sirius&quot; sailed from The Motherbank, Ryde, Isle of Wight on 13 May 1787 as the flagship of the eleven-vessel First Fleet, under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip (Governor-designate of the new colony). Phillip transferred to the Armed Tender HMS &quot;Supply&quot; at Cape Town, with Second Captain John Hunter remaining in command of &quot;Sirius&quot;. Also on board were Marine Major Robert Ross, who would be responsible for colony security and surgeons George Bouchier Worgan and Thomas Jamison. Midshipman Daniel Southwell recorded that &quot;Sirius&quot; was carrying the Larcum Kendall K1 marine chronometer used by Captain James Cook on his second and third voyages around the world. She arrived in Botany Bay on 20 January 1788, two days after &quot;Supply&quot;, according to the journals of Hunter and First Lieutenant (later Rear Admiral) William Bradley The 252-day voyage had gone via Rio de Janeiro and the Cape of Good Hope and covered more than . It was quickly decided that Botany Bay was unsuitable for a penal settlement and an alternative location was sought. While waiting to move, a large gale arose preventing any sailing; during this period the French expeditionary fleet of Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse arrived in Botany Bay. The colony was established at Sydney Cove in Port Jackson when Governor Phillip arrived on 26 January aboard &quot;Supply&quot;. &quot;Sirius&quot; arrived the following day. 

The British cordially received the French. &quot;Sirius&quot;″s captains, through their officers, offered assistance and asked if Lapérouse needed supplies. However the French leader and the British commanders never met personally.

Lapérouse also took the opportunity to send his journals, some charts and some letters back to Europe with &quot;Sirius&quot;. After obtaining wood and fresh water, the French left on 10 March for New Caledonia, Santa Cruz, the Solomons, the Louisiades, and the western and southern coasts of Australia. The French fleet and all on board were never seen again. The documents carried by &quot;Sirius&quot; would be its only testament. Decades later it was discovered that Lapérouse&#x27;s expedition had been shipwrecked on the island of Vanikoro.

&quot;Sirius&quot; left Port Jackson under the command of Hunter on 2 October 1788, when she was sent back to the Cape of Good Hope to get flour and other supplies. The complete voyage, which took more than seven months to complete, returned just in time to save the near-starving colony.

In 1789, she was refitted in Mosman Bay, which was originally named Great Sirius Cove after the vessel. The name lives on in the adjacent Sirius Cove (formerly &quot;Little Sirius Cove&quot;).

On 19 March 1790, &quot;Sirius&quot; was wrecked on a reef at Norfolk Island while landing stores. Among those who witnessed the ship&#x27;s demise from shore was Thomas Jamison, the surgeon for the penal settlement. Jamison would eventually become Surgeon-General of New South Wales. &quot;Sirius&quot;″s crew was stranded on Norfolk Island until they were rescued on 21 February 1791. Hunter returned to England aboard &quot;Waaksamheyd&quot; where he faced court martial and was honourably acquitted. He was appointed as Phillip&#x27;s successor as Governor of New South Wales in February 1795, though he did not return to the colony until September. One of the sailors on &quot;Sirius&quot;, Jacob Nagle, wrote a first-hand account of the ship&#x27;s last voyage, wreck, and the crew&#x27;s stranding. With the settlement in New South Wales still on the brink of starvation, the loss of &quot;Sirius&quot; left the colonists with only one navy ship.

==Legacy==

Many artefacts have been retrieved from the &quot;Sirius&quot; wreck. They include three anchors and two carronades. Objects are displayed in the Norfolk Island Museum. Another anchor, as well as a cannon, are on display in Macquarie Place, Sydney. Other &quot;Sirius&quot; artefacts including an anchor can be viewed at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney. A detailed 1:24 scale model of &quot;Sirius&quot; is displayed in the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney. Small models of all the First Fleet ships are displayed in the Museum of Sydney.

The &quot;Sirius&quot; wrecksite is protected by the Commonwealth &quot;Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976&quot; and is listed on the Australian National Heritage List.

An Urban Transit Authority First Fleet ferry was named after &quot;Sirius&quot; in 1984. Bas-relief memorials to the ship were erected in the Sydney suburb of Mosman, Norfolk Island and Ryde, Isle of Wight in 1989, 1990 and 1991 respectively.

The scientific name of the tiny crustacean &quot;Mallacoota sirius&quot; recalls HMS &quot;Sirius&quot;. The specimens of this species were collected from the point on the reef where &quot;Sirius&quot; wrecked.

<doc id="297678" wikidata="Q1669878" url="?curid=297678" title="Tanistry">
<text>Tanistry is a Gaelic system for passing on titles and lands. In this system the Tanist (; ; ) is the office of heir-apparent, or second-in-command, among the (royal) Gaelic patrilineal dynasties of Ireland, Scotland and Mann, to succeed to the chieftainship or to the kingship.

The word is preserved in the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s government, where the prime minister is the &quot;Taoiseach&quot; while the deputy prime minister is the &quot;Tánaiste&quot;.

==Origins==
Historically the tanist was chosen from among the heads of the &quot;roydammna&quot; or &quot;righdamhna&quot; (literally, those of &quot;kingly material&quot;) or, alternatively, among all males of the &quot;sept&quot;, and elected by them in full assembly. The eligibility was based on descent from a king to a few degrees of proximity. Usually descent from the male lines of a king was the norm, however in Scotland, descent through the female lines of a king was also accepted, possibly because of an intermingling with the Pictish succession rules. An example of this is King Eochaid who claimed the Scottish throne as the son of the daughter of Kenneth I. 

The composition and the governance of the clan were built upon descent from a similar ancestor. The office was noted from the beginning of recorded history in Ireland, and probably pre-dates it. A story about Cormac mac Airt refers to his eldest son as his tanist. Following his murder by a member of the Deisi, another &quot;roydammna&quot;, Eochaid Gonnat, succeeded as king.

In Ireland, the tanistry continued among the dominant dynasties, as well as lesser lords and chieftains, until the mid-16th/early 17th century when it was replaced by English common law. When in 1943 Ireland appointed its first new Chief Herald, it did not reintroduce tanistry. The state granted courtesy recognition to Irish chiefs based on primogeniture from the last known chief.

The royal succession in Celtic Scotland was limited to the elective succession of the male descendants of &quot;Siol Alpein&quot; (House of Alpin) until the accession of King Malcolm II in 1005. This monarch was the first to introduce the concept of hereditary monarchy in Scotland. He did so to try to eliminate the strife caused by the elective law, which encouraged rival claimants to fight for the throne. The earlier Pictish kingdoms had allowed female-line succession to the throne and in middle age Scotland, Pictish and Gaelic succession rules were intermingled. Since Malcolm had only daughters, the throne passed to his grandson through his eldest daughter and later, their descendants. The Irish monarchies, for their part, never at any stage allowed for female line succession.

==Candidates and functions==
The king or chief held office for life and was required by custom to be of full age, in possession of all his faculties, and without any remarkable blemish of mind or body. At the same time, and subject to the same conditions, a tanist or next heir to the monarchy was elected, who if the king died or became disqualified, at once became king. Typically a former king&#x27;s son became tanist (sometimes the son of the king simultaneously elected. However, perhaps more often a son of a rival branch of the dynasty), but not because the system of primogeniture was in any way recognised; indeed, the only principle adopted was that the dignity of chieftainship should descend to the eldest and most worthy agnate of the last ruler. (Note this still disqualified many in the clan, since most clansmen were clients, not related to the ruling line, patrilineally or otherwise.)
One of the most common rules for qualification as a &quot;roydammna&quot; was that a candidate had to be a member of the previous chief&#x27;s &quot;derbfhine&quot;, a kindred including all descended in the male line from a common great-grandfather. However, it was often restricted to the chief&#x27;s &quot;gelfhine&quot;, a &quot;fine&quot; descended from one common (patrilineal) grandfather. This meant that the group became highly exclusive, keeping the kingship within the dynasty. Many in the wider clan might be reduced to gentry or peasant status (though they might share the surname). These features make tanistry an agnatic succession mode, and a succession by appointment, as it was an elective monarchy. Tanistry evades the basic requirement of the hereditary monarchy, i.e. that the outcome of the succession is predictable, up to the identity of successor and next heirs, by genealogy.

The downside of the large group of eligibles was that increases in &quot;roydammna&quot; in each generation might lead to internecine dynastic civil war. Such was the case among the descendants of King and High King Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088–1156). His dynasty, the Uí Briúin, had successfully ruled as Kings of Connacht since at least the mid-5th century. Their increasing consolidation via the annexation of the Kingdoms of Mide and Dublin, plus suborning neighboring states and lordships to vassalage, led to Tairrdelbach becoming the first of his dynasty to become High King.

Competition between Tairrdelbach&#x27;s many sons caused corrosive warfare among at least four competing main lines, in addition to allied lordships&#x27; and kingdoms&#x27; striving for the main chance. Coupled with the incursions of the Normans from 1169 onwards, this fragmented Ó Conchobhar rule. By the mid-13th century, they were reduced to ruling a fraction of their former patrimony.

Another example of &quot;Derbfhine&quot; or &quot;Roydammna&quot; proliferation comes from the &quot;Annals of Connacht&quot;. It states that at the Second Battle of Athenry in August 1316, in addition to King Tadc Ó Cellaig of Uí Maine, &quot;there fell with him ... twenty-eight men who were entitled to succeed to the kingship of Uí Maine.&quot;

==Consequences==
The tanistry system often led to rotation among the most prominent branches of the clan or the reigning house, particularly in the Middle Ages. Though not necessarily intended to be so, tanistry was perceived to create balance between branches of family. A quite usual pattern was that the chief (king, lord) was succeeded by his tanist, elected earlier and from a branch different from that to which the incumbent chief belonged. Perhaps simultaneously upon that succession, a tanist was elected from another branch to fill the position vacated by the one now risen to chieftainship. He may have come from the branch to which the deceased belonged. The next vacancy would be handled in a similar way. If a chieftain attempted to have his own son (or brother) chosen over a representative of another branch, the electors were outraged, as they feared subjugation to one branch.

In 1296, the Bruce candidate to inherit the crown of Scotland pleaded the traditional tanistry in his favor. In terms of primogeniture, he was from a cadet branch of the old royal descent, and thus would not have succeeded. The idea of rotation and balance (and his seniority in age and experience) made him a credible competitor. A Pictish aspect was that both the House of Balliol and House of Bruce descended through female lines from the royal house, and were allowed to present candidacy. Bruce also claimed tanistry through a female line. This may be an indication that in Scotland, Pictish and Gaelic succession rules were intermingled. The judicial resolution of the succession quarrel, directed by the English king, favoured the Balliols on the basis of primogeniture. Subsequent political events reverted that result to a more &quot;clannish-tradition&quot; direction. Robert the Bruce, grandson of the candidate who argued for tanistry, ascended the throne despite descending from a rather junior cadet line of the original Royal House. All future monarchs of Scotland after that succeeded by the rights of the Bruce.

Tanistry as the system of succession left the headship open to the ambitious. It was a frequent source of strife both in families and between the clans, but it was conversely quasi-democratic. Tanistry was abolished by a legal decision during the reign of JamesVI of Scotland, who later was named JamesI of England and Ireland. The English land law was substituted.

The rules of succession of the House of Alpin of Scottish monarchs (a dynasty of mixed Pictish and Gaelic origin) and their successors abided by tanistry rules until at least 1034. They also used them in certain successions in the 1090s, and tanistry was used as an argument in succession litigation as late as the 1290s. A similar system operated in Wales, where, under Welsh law, any of the sons or brothers of the king could be chosen as the &quot;edling&quot;, or heir to the kingdom.

==Tanistry==
In the broadest sense, the name &quot;tanistry&quot; describes the functional principle that &quot;the most talented male member of the royal dynasty should inherit the throne, commonly by murder and war&quot;.

It is specifically used to describe the practical ramifications of the Turco-Mongol, as well as other Central Asian steppe nomad, principles of inheritance and succession. Because all male members of the royal clan are considered to have equally legitimate claims on power, the ruler is the individual who eliminates competitors and re-subjugates the rest of the state formation. The structure may be determined by bonds of personal loyalty to the ruler, which are considered to be dissolved on the ruler&#x27;s death.

<doc id="297681" wikidata="Q223625" url="?curid=297681" title="Curfew">
<text>A curfew is an order that imposes certain regulations during specified hours. Typically, curfews order all people affected by them to remain indoors during the evening and nighttime hours. Such an order is most often issued by public authorities, but may also be given by the owner of a house to those living in the household. For instance, children are often given curfews by their parents, and an au pair is traditionally given a curfew by which time he or she must return to his or her host family&#x27;s home. Some jurisdictions have juvenile curfews which affect all persons under a certain age not accompanied by an adult or engaged in certain approved activities.

Curfews have been used as a control measure in martial law, as well as for public safety in the event of a disaster, epidemic, or crisis. Various countries have implemented such measures throughout history, including during World War II and the Gulf War. The enforcement of curfews has been found to disproportionately affect marginalised groups, including those who are homeless or have limited access to transportation.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, curfews were implemented in several countries, including France, Italy, Poland and Australia, as a measure to limit the spread of the virus. However, recent studies have reported negligible or no effect, and even a potential increase in virus transmission. The use and enforcement of curfews during the pandemic has been associated with human rights violations and mental health deterioration, further complicating their use as a control measure. Curfews may also impact road safety, as studies indicate a potential decrease in crashes during curfew hours but an increase in crashes before curfew due to rushing.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;curfew&quot; comes from the Old French phrase &quot;couvre-feu&quot;, which means &quot;cover fire&quot;. It was later adopted into Middle English as &quot;curfeu&quot;, which later became the modern &quot;curfew&quot;. Its original meaning refers to a law by William the Conqueror that all lights and fires should be covered to extinction at the ringing of an eight o&#x27;clock bell to prevent the spread of destructive fire within communities in timber buildings. With the same derivation a &quot;curfew&quot; also refers to a device used to cover the embers of a fire at night, allowing it to be re-ignited more easily in the morning.

== Historical ==

Curfews have been used since the Middle Ages to limit uprisings among subordinate groups, including Anglo-Saxons under William the Conqueror. Prior to the U.S. Civil War, most Southern states placed a curfew on slaves.

Modern curfews primarily focus on youth as well as during periods of war and other crisis. In the United States, progressive reformers pushed for curfews on youth, successfully securing bans on children&#x27;s nighttime presence on streets in cities such as Louisville, Kentucky and Lincoln, Nebraska. General curfews were also put into place after crises such as the 1871 Chicago Fire.

Wartime curfews were also implemented during the First and Second World Wars. A formal curfew introduced by the British board of trade ordered shops and entertainment establishments to extinguish their lights by 10:30 p.m. to save fuel during World War I.

==Types==
* An order issued by public authorities or military forces requiring everyone or certain people to be indoors at certain times, often at night. It can be imposed to maintain public order (as was the case with the northeast blackout of 2003, the 2005 French riots, the 2010 Chile earthquake, the 2011 Egyptian revolution, and the 2014 Ferguson unrest), or suppress targeted groups. Curfews have long been directed at certain groups in many cities or states, such as Japanese-American university students on the West Coast of the United States during World War II, African-Americans in many towns during the time of Jim Crow laws, or people younger than a certain age (usually within a few years either side of 18) in many towns of the United States since the 1980s. In recent times, curfews have been imposed by many countries during disease epidemics or pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic; see below.
* A rule set for a child or teenager by their parents or legal guardians, requiring them to return home by a specific time, usually in the evening or night. This may apply daily, or vary with the day of the week, e.g., if the minor has to go to school the next day.
* An order by the head of household to a domestic assistant such as an au pair or nanny. The domestic assistant must then return home by a specific time.
* A daily requirement for guests to return to their hostel before a specified time, usually in the evening or night.
* A daily requirement that a person subject to a court order, such as probation or bail conditions, must return to their home before a certain hour and be inside it until a certain hour of the morning.
* In baseball, a time after which a game must end, or play be suspended. For example, in the American League the curfew rule for many years decreed that no inning could begin after 1 am local time (with the exception of international games).
* In aeronautics, night flying restrictions may restrict aircraft operations over a defined period in the nighttime, to limit the disruption of aircraft noise on the sleep of nearby residents. Notable examples are the London airports of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, which operate under the Quota Count system.
* In a few locations in the UK, patrons of licensed premises may not enter after a &quot;curfew&quot; time, also known as &quot;last orders&quot;. In Inverclyde, for example, this is currently set at 12:00 am. 
* In many boarding schools, students are usually ordered by school staff to stay in their dormitories at night.

==By country==

===Australia===
On 17 August 2011, a nighttime curfew was imposed on children who had run amok in the streets of Victoria after repeating youth offenses.

On 2 August 2020, following the surge of COVID-19 cases in Victoria, especially in Melbourne, Victorian premier Daniel Andrews declared a state of disaster across the state and imposed stage 4 lockdown in Metropolitan Melbourne. The new measures included nighttime curfew, which was implemented across Melbourne from 20:00 to 05:00 (AEST). The restrictions came into effect at 18:00 (6 pm) and lasted until 28 September 2020 (5 am).

On 16 August 2021, following a surge of COVID-19 cases and a drop in compliance in restrictions in Victoria, especially in Melbourne, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews reinstated the curfew in Melbourne, this time from 21:00 to 05:00 (AEST) effective midnight 17 August 2021 until at least 2 September 2021.

On 20 August 2021, as COVID-19 cases continued to surge in New South Wales, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian imposed a curfew in the local government areas of Bayside, Blacktown, Burwood, Campbelltown, Canterbury-Bankstown, Cumberland, Fairfield, Georges River, Liverpool, Parramatta, Strathfield, and parts of Penrith, from 9:00 pm to 5:00 am (AEST) beginning from 23 August.

===Belgium===

On 17 October 2020, due to surge of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Belgium, Prime Minister Alexander De Croo announced a nationwide curfew from midnight to 05:00 am local time. The curfew was imposed on 19 October 2020 and was to last for four weeks. The government also announced the closure of cafes, bars and restaurants for one month and alcohol sales were banned after 8:00 pm local time.

===Bangladesh===
On 19 July 2024 Bangladesh government declared a national curfew and announced plans to deploy the army to tackle the country’s worst unrest in a decade. The government announced the imposition of a curfew after days of clashes at protests against government job quotas across the country.

On 4th August 2024 Bangladesh government declared a curfew again following the deadliest day of the protest with Mass shooting and a violent crackdown on the Non Cooperation Movement.

===Canada===
On 6 January 2021, due to a surge of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the province of Quebec, a curfew was ordered by the premier of Quebec François Legault. The curfew was adjusted for different areas of the province depending on the number of cases, amongst other criteria. The more populous areas, such as the urban areas of Montréal and Quebec City qualified as &quot;red zones&quot; and were placed under a curfew from 8 pm to 5 am while the less urban areas were either &quot;orange zones&quot; with a curfew from 9:30 pm to 5 am. This curfew was expected to be in effect from 9 January up to and including 8 February 2021. 
&quot;Yellow zones&quot; did not have curfew. However, the curfew did not end in February. It ended on May 28, 2021. On December 30, 2021, Quebec reinstated the nightly curfew this time starting at 10:00 pm to 5:00 am. Following the reinstatement of the curfew, studies came out doubting its effectiveness in lowering the transmission of COVID-19.

===Egypt===
On 28 January 2011, during the Egyptian Revolution and following the collapse of the police system, President Hosni Mubarak declared a country-wide military enforced curfew. However, it was ignored by demonstrators who continued their sit-in in Tahrir Square. Concerned residents formed neighborhood vigilante groups to defend their communities against looters and the newly escaped prisoners.

On the second anniversary of the revolution, in January 2013, a wave of demonstrations swept the country against President Mohamed Morsi who declared a curfew in Port Said, Ismaïlia, and Suez, three cities where deadly street clashes had occurred. In defiance, the locals took to the streets during the curfew, organizing football tournaments and street festivals, prohibiting police and military forces from enforcing the curfew.

===Fiji===

On 27 March 2020, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama announced a nationwide curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. that would take effect on 30 March. The times have been adjusted forward and backward on several occasions, but as of January 2022, this curfew is still in effect. The government of Fiji maintains that this curfew will stay in effect for the foreseeable future.

===France===

On 14 October 2020, following the surge of COVID-19 cases and deaths in France that threatened to overwhelm hospitals, French President Emmanuel Macron declared a national state of public health emergency for the second time and imposed a nighttime curfew in the Île-de-France region that includes Paris, as well as Grenoble, Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Montpellier, Rouen, Saint-Etienne, and Toulouse. The curfew ran from 09:00 pm to 06:00 am local time (CEST) (08:00 pm to 05:00 am CET) and was implemented from 17 October 2020 to last four weeks.

Under the rules, people in those cities could only leave their homes for essential reasons, and anyone who violated the curfew would face a fine of 135 euros ($158.64) for the first offence. A second offence would bring a far steeper fine of 1,500 euros, or around $1,762. 
On 23 October, the curfew was expanded to 38 departments and French Polynesia. In total, 54 departments and one overseas collectivity were affected by new restrictions, comprising 46 million people, or two-thirds of the French population.

===Iceland===
Under Iceland&#x27;s Child Protection Act (no. 80/2002 Art. 92), minors aged 12 and under may not be outdoors after 20:00 (8:00 pm) unless accompanied by an adult. Minors aged 13 to 16 may not be outdoors after 22:00 (10:00 pm), unless on their way home from a recognized event organized by a school, sports organization or youth club. During the period 1 May to 1 September, children may be outdoors for two hours longer.

Children and teenagers that break curfew are taken to the local police station and police officers tell their parents to come and get them. The age limits are based upon year of birth, not date of birth. If a parent cannot be reached, the child or teenager is taken to a shelter.

===Ireland===

Several medieval towns in Ireland had a curfew after the English model. In Galway a curfew bell was rung every night before the town gates were locked. In Kilkenny the night watchmen stood guard over the market stalls &quot;from curfew to cockcrow.&quot;

During the 1916 Easter Rising, Dublin was under curfew between 7:30 p.m. and 5:30 am.

During the Irish War of Independence curfews were regularly imposed, including in 1920 in Dublin between midnight and 5 am. Curfew between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. was imposed on Cork City in July 1920 after the shooting of Gerald Smyth; in August it was extended to many parts of Munster.

In 1921 Limerick was under a curfew. In 1921, Dublin&#x27;s curfew began at 10 pm, moved to 9 p.m on 4 March.

In the Republic of Ireland, a restriction on movement order may be placed on an offender, which may include a curfew element.

===Italy===

In Italy a curfew went into effect from October 2020 to limit the spread of COVID-19. Between 22 and 26 October 2020 Lombardy, Campania, Lazio, Sicily, Calabria and Piedmont imposed a curfew between 11.00 pm and 5.00 am, so any movement was prohibited.

With the ministerial decree of 3 November 2020, corrected with the DPCM of 3 December 2020, and 14 January 2021, the Italian Regions are grouped into three types of different epidemiological scenarios. A curfew is instituted nationwide from 10 pm to 5 am, shopping centers are ordered to close on weekends, and the use of distance learning for high schools.

There have been many protests and riots against the curfew nationwide since it came into effect. However, the curfew has not been lifted by the government.

===Jersey===

During the German occupation of the Channel Islands, curfews were imposed.

===Morocco===

On 21 December 2020, the government of Morocco first announced a nationwide nighttime curfew as part of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to come into effect on 23 December. Initially implemented for a three-week period from 9:00 pm–6:00 am, it was extended throughout 2021 alongside the state of health emergency, with hours altered during Ramadan (8:00 pm–6:00 am), and from May to early August (11:00 pm–4:30 am). The curfew was lifted on 10 November 2021.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, a curfew from 9:00 pm to 4:30 am local time went into effect on 23 January 2021 to limit the spread of COVID-19. Across the first two nights, 5,765 people were given the 95 euro fine for disobeying the curfew. Nationwide anti-curfew riots occurred from 23 until 26 January, resulting in the arrests of over 575 people. On 8 February, the government announced an extension of the curfew until 2 March. The curfew was lifted on April 28, 2021 and has not been reinstated since then.

===Philippines===

In 1565, the Spanish conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi arrived in Cebu to colonize the islands that would later be known as the Philippines. Legazpi constructed a fort and instituted a curfew for those entering it at night, citing concerns that &quot;women prostituted themselves in the camp.&quot; During the American colonial period in the Philippines at the turn of the 19th century, Manila was under a &quot;Curfew Order&quot; requiring them not to go out of their houses after 7:00 pm, and later the restriction changed to 8:30 pm, then to 10:00 pm, then to 11:00 pm, and finally revoked in 1901.

On September 22, 1972, the day after then President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law, he issued General Order No. 4, mandating a curfew from midnight to 4:00 a.m., and anyone who violated this curfew would be arrested and taken into custody. In December 1972, Marcos conditionally lifted the curfew, and in 1977, he announced the complete removal of the curfew as part of efforts to ease restrictions imposed during martial law. The primary goal of the curfew was to reduce crime, among other reasons.

On May 23, 2017, then President Rodrigo Duterte proclaimed martial law in the entire Mindanao island group as a response to the siege of Marawi, and the proclamation involved curfews. 129 areas in Mindanao had curfews in 2017. After winning the 2016 presidential elections and before starting his term, Duterte proposed a nationwide curfew for minors. 

There have been local ordinances regarding curfew for minors in some cities and municipalities but no nationwide law. Article 129 of the Presidential Decree 603 in 1974 permits c]ty or municipal councils to implement &quot;curfew hours for children as may be warranted by local conditions.&quot; In 2022, a proposed bill was introduced in the House of Representatives to implement a nationwide curfew. However, the bill has been pending with the Committee on the Welfare of Children since July 2022. 

The curfew for minors in the Philippines is a debatable topic. Those in favor argue that curfews will promote the children&#x27;s safety and welfare, while those against state that curfews infringe on children&#x27;s right to travel in their vicinity and their parents&#x27; right to nurture them. In 2017, the Supreme Court of the Philippines ruled on the constitutionality of some of these local ordinances after a group filed a case. The high court upheld the curfew for minors in Quezon City but did not support the curfews implemented in Manila and Navotas.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, several areas of the Philippines enforced curfews, including Metro Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, Rizal, Cebu, and Cagayan de Oro.

===Poland===

A strict nationwide curfew was imposed in December 1981 following the introduction of Martial law in Poland.

===Slovenia===

In Slovenia, a curfew was implemented in February 1942 in the area occupied by Italy during World War II. More recently, it was imposed in October 2020 during the COVID-19 epidemic to limit the spread of the virus. The curfew, which was referred to as the &quot;epidemiological curfew,&quot; was enforced from 20 October 2020 to 12 April 2021, from 9:00 pm to 6:00 am local time, for a total of 174 days. The measure was recommended by the government&#x27;s COVID-19 expert group and enforced under the Infectious Diseases Act. The curfew was criticized by some experts as unnecessary and was challenged for its potential violation of human rights. In April 2023, the Constitutional Court declined to assess the curfew regulations as no longer valid, although a concern has been raised that similar measures may be implemented in the future.

===South Korea===
In South Korea, a curfew was imposed following the American military occupation and end of Japanese colonial rule in 1945. It remained in place throughout the Korean War and decades thereafter until it was lifted on 4 January 1982 under the presidency of Chun Doo-hwan, a few months after the capital Seoul was awarded host of the 1988 Summer Olympics.

===Spain===

In Spain, a curfew was imposed from 11:00 pm to 6:00 am local time on 25 October 2020 to limit the spread of COVID-19, in addition to some Autonomous Communities starting the curfew at 10:00 pm.

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka Police are empowered to declare and enforce a &quot;Police Curfew&quot; in any police area for any particular period to maintain the peace, law and order under the &quot;Police Ordinance&quot;. Under the emergency regulations of the &quot;Public Security Ordinance&quot;, the President may declare a curfew over the whole or over any part of the country. Travel is restricted, during a curfew, to authorised persons such as police, armed forces personal and public officers. Civilians may gain a Curfew Pass from a police station to travel during a curfew.
===Ukraine===
During the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, curfews are imposed in all oblasts of Ukraine except Zakarpattia, usually lasting from 12 am to 5 am, although may differ depending on specific oblast.

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom&#x27;s 2003 Anti-Social Behaviour Act created zones that allow police from 9 pm to 6 am to hold and escort home unaccompanied minors under the age of 16, whether badly behaved or not. Although hailed as a success, the High Court ruled in one particular case that the law did not give the police a power of arrest, and officers could not force someone to come with them. On appeal the court of appeal held that the act gave police powers to escort minors home only if they are involved in, or at risk from, actual or imminently anticipated bad behaviour.

In a few towns in the United Kingdom, the curfew bell is still rung as a continuation of the medieval tradition where the bell used to be rung from the parish church to guide travelers safely towards a town or village as darkness fell, or when bad weather made it difficult to follow trackways and for the villagers to extinguish their lights and fires as a safety measure to combat accidental fires. Until 1100 it was against the law to burn any lights after the ringing of the curfew bell. In Morpeth, the curfew is rung each night at 8 pm from Morpeth Clock Tower. In Chertsey, it is rung at 8 pm, from Michaelmas to Lady Day. A short story concerning the Chertsey curfew, set in 1471, and entitled &quot;Blanche Heriot. A legend of old Chertsey Church&quot; was published by Albert Richard Smith in 1843, and formed a basis for the poem &quot;Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight&quot;. At Castleton in the Peak District, the curfew is rung from Michaelmas to Shrove Tuesday. At Wallingford in Oxfordshire, the curfew bell continues to be rung at 9 pm rather than 8 pm which is a one-hour extension granted by William the Conqueror as the Lord of the town was a Norman sympathiser. However, none of these curfew bells serves its original function.

====Northern Ireland====

During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the British Army made an attempt to search for illegal items secretly held by Official IRA (OIRA) and the Provisional IRA (IRA) in Falls Road, Belfast, a predominantly Catholic neighbourhood. The operation, which became known as the Falls Curfew, took place from 3 to 5 July 1970, with British troops carrying out searches. As it ended, local youths attacked the soldiers, who responded by deploying riot control tactics; the confrontation quickly developed into a series of gunfights between the British Army and the IRA. After four hours, the Army sealed off the area and imposed a 36-hour curfew, carrying out more searches and recovering 96 weapons before the operation ended. Ultimately, 4 civilians were killed, 78 wounded and 337 arrested. 18 soldiers were also wounded. The curfew was later found to be illegal and no further attempts to impose curfews were made during the Troubles.

During the 2020–21 coronavirus pandemic, a curfew was imposed between Christmas 2020 and New Years 2021, 8 p.m. to 6 am, to reduce contagion.

===United States===

Curfew law in the United States is usually a matter of local ordinance (mainly applied by a municipality or county), rather than federal law. However, the Constitution guarantees certain rights, which have been applied to the states through the 14th Amendment. Hence, any curfew law may be overruled and struck down if, for example, it violates 1st, 4th, 5th or 14th Amendment rights.

Nonetheless, curfews are set by state and local governments. They vary by state and even by county or municipality.

American military curfews are a tool used by commanders at various installations to shape the behavior of soldiers.

====Juvenile curfews====

Local ordinances and state statutes may make it unlawful for minors below a certain age to be on public streets, unless they are accompanied by a parent or an adult or on lawful and necessary business on behalf of their parents or guardians. For example, a Michigan state law provides that &quot;[n]o minor under the age of 12 years shall loiter, idle or congregate in or on any public street, highway, alley or park between the hours of 10 o&#x27;clock p.m. and 6 o&#x27;clock a.m., unless the minor is accompanied by a parent or guardian, or some adult delegated by the parent or guardian to accompany the child.&quot; MCLA § 722.751; MSA § 28.342(1). Curfew laws in other states and cities typically set forth different curfews for minors of different ages.

The stated purpose of such laws is generally to deter disorderly behavior and crime, while others can include to protect youth from victimization and to strengthen parental responsibility, but their effectiveness is subject to debate. Generally, curfews attempt to address vandalism, shootings, and property crimes, which are believed to happen mostly at night, but are less commonly used to address underage drinking, drunk driving, risky driving, and teenage pregnancy. Parents can be fined, charged or ordered to take parenting classes for willingly, or through insufficient control or supervision, permitting the child to violate the curfew. Many local curfew laws were enacted in the 1950s and 1960s to attack the &quot;juvenile delinquent&quot; problem of youth gangs. Most curfew exceptions include:
*accompanied by a parent or an adult appointed by the parent;
*going to or coming home from work, school, religious, or recreational activity;
*engaging in a lawful employment activity or;
*involved in an emergency;
Some cities make it illegal for a business owner, operator, or any employee to knowingly allow a minor to remain in the establishment during curfew hours. A business owner, operator, or any employee may be also subject to fines.

A 2011 UC-Berkeley study looked at the 54 larger U.S. cities that enacted youth curfews between 1985 and 2002 and found that arrests of youths affected by curfew restrictions dropped almost 15% in the first year and approximately 10% in following years. However, not all studies agree with the conclusion that youth curfew laws actually reduce crime, and many studies find no benefit or sometimes even the opposite. For example, one 2016 systematic review of 12 studies on the matter found that the effect on crime is close to zero, and can perhaps even backfire somewhat.

There are also concerns about racial profiling. In response to concerns about racial profiling, Montgomery County, Maryland, passed a limited curfew, which would permit police officers to arrest juveniles in situations that appear threatening.

====Mall curfews====

Many malls in the United States have policies that prohibit minors under a specified age from entering the mall after specified times, unless they are accompanied by a parent or another adult or are working at the mall during curfew times. Such policies are known as &quot;mall curfews.&quot; For example, the Mall of America&#x27;s Youth Supervision Policy, requires all minors visiting Mall after 4 p.m. to be accompanied by someone 21 or older. One adult can chaperone up to four minors. The policy is part of the mall&#x27;s broader security program, which includes the addition of metal detectors, more patrols and a K-9 unit. Malls that have policies prohibiting unaccompanied minors at any time are known as &quot;parental escort policies.&quot;

====Curfews for adults====

States and municipalities in the United States have occasionally enacted curfews on the population at large, often as a result of severely inclement weather or civil disorder. Some such curfews require all citizens simply to refrain from driving. Others require all citizens to remain inside, with exceptions granted to those in important positions, such as elected officials, law enforcement personnel, first responders, healthcare workers, and the mass media.

However, unlike juvenile curfews, all-ages curfews have always been very limited in terms of both location and duration. That is, they are temporary and restricted to very specific areas, and generally only implemented during states of emergency, then subsequently lifted or allowed to sunset.

In 1992, a curfew was imposed in Los Angeles, California during the Rodney King Riots.

In 2015, the city of Baltimore enacted a curfew on all citizens that lasted for five days and prohibited all citizens from going outdoors from 10 pm to 5 am with the exception of those traveling to or from work and those with medical emergencies. This was in response to the 2015 Baltimore protests.

During the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, local curfews were used (typically in combination with daytime lockdown policies) in the attempt to slow down the spread of the virus by limiting nonessential interactions between people from different households. Later in 2020, citywide curfews were enacted in major cities across the country due to protests following the killing of George Floyd in May. Arizona enacted a statewide curfew. Countywide curfews were enacted for Los Angeles County and Alameda County in California. In spring 2021, the city of Miami Beach, Florida enacted a citywide curfew due to public disorder associated with spring break celebrations.

<doc id="297682" wikidata="Q1353724" url="?curid=297682" title="John Hunter (Royal Navy officer)">
<text>Vice Admiral John Hunter (29 August 1737 – 13 March 1821) was an officer of the Royal Navy, who succeeded Arthur Phillip as the second Governor of New South Wales, serving from 1795 to 1800.

Both a sailor and a scholar, he explored the Parramatta River as early as 1788, and was the first to surmise that Tasmania might be an island. As governor, he tried to combat serious abuses by the military in the face of powerful local interests led by John MacArthur. Hunter&#x27;s name is commemorated in historic locations such as Hunter Valley and Hunter Street, Sydney.

==Family and early life==
John Hunter was born in Leith, Scotland, the son of William Hunter, a captain in the merchant service, and Helen, &quot;née&quot; Drummond, daughter of J. Drummond and niece of George Drummond, several-time lord provost of Edinburgh. As a boy Hunter was sent to live with an uncle in the town of King&#x27;s Lynn in Norfolk, where, and also at Edinburgh, he received the classical education of the time. Hunter was sent to the University of Edinburgh, but soon left it to join the navy as a captain&#x27;s servant to Thomas Knackston on HMS &quot;Grampus&quot; in May 1754.

==Naval career==
===Seven Years&#x27; War===
In 1755 Hunter was enrolled as able seaman on HMS Centaur, became a midshipman and served on and then . While aboard &quot;Neptune&quot; he was present at the Raid on Rochefort in 1757, and afterwards served during cruises off Brest in 1758 and the capture of Quebec in 1759. Serving aboard &quot;Neptune&quot; at this time as her first lieutenant was John Jervis, later Earl of St Vincent and First Sea Lord, who became an acquaintance of Hunter.

Hunter spent the rest of the Seven Years&#x27; War as midshipman on several of Admiral Philip Durell&#x27;s flagships, serving aboard HMS &quot;Royal Anne&quot;, and the 100-gun , the latter in the Bay of Biscay until the Treaty of Paris ended the war in 1763. Hunter passed examinations and qualified for promotion to lieutenant in February 1760. (He was not, however, appointed lieutenant until 1780.) Hunter remained active in the navy during the years of peace, going out to Newfoundland aboard the frigate and then serving as master&#x27;s mate aboard HMS &quot;Launceston&quot; during her time in North America in 1767 with the fleet under Commodore Samuel Hood. Hood gave Hunter an acting-order as master in 1768, and after passing his exams with Trinity House in 1769, Hunter had the order confirmed. His first appointment was to the 28-gun for service in the West Indies. Hunter spent his time there making charts and plans of parts of the coast and of the Spanish fortifications at Havana, which he sent back to the Admiralty. &quot;Carysfort&quot; was nearly lost after running aground on Martyr Reef in the Gulf of Florida in 1771, while being sailed by a pilot, but Hunter&#x27;s exertions allowed her to be saved with the loss of her masts and guns.

===Service in the East Indies===
Hunter served as master of in the East Indies between 1772 and 1775, after which he became master of . The &quot;Kent&quot; was at this time commanded by Captain John Jervis, Hunter&#x27;s companion from HMS &quot;Neptune&quot;. Jervis took Hunter with him to his next command, . Also serving aboard &quot;Foudroyant&quot; at this time was Evan Nepean, then the ship&#x27;s purser, but later a leading civil servant and First Secretary to the Admiralty. From &quot;Foudroyant&quot; Hunter was moved into in 1776, at the request of Admiral Lord Howe, who was then going out to North America as commander-in-chief of the fleet, with &quot;Eagle&quot; as his flagship.

===American War of Independence===
When the American Revolutionary War broke out, Hunter served under Howe for the duration of his time in command, acting virtually as master of the fleet. He was active in the Chesapeake raid and the expeditions on the Delaware, as well as the defence of Sandy Hook. On Howe&#x27;s recall, his reputation by now stale with the Sandwich administration, Hunter was not able to have his request to be made lieutenant honoured. Instead he joined the 74-gun as a volunteer in 1779, under her captain, Keith Stewart. He was appointed lieutenant of HMS &quot;Union&quot; by Sir Charles Hardy, but the Admiralty refused to confirm the appointment and Hunter returned to the &quot;Berwick&quot; as a volunteer in 1780, and went out the West Indies. There he received a commission from the commander in chief, Sir George Rodney. Hunter returned to England aboard the &quot;Berwick&quot; in 1781, and was present at the Battle of Dogger Bank on 5 August that year. Howe appointed him third lieutenant of his flagship in 1782, and was advanced to first lieutenant by the time she took part in the relief of Gibraltar and the Battle of Cape Spartel. Following these engagements Hunter was appointed to his first command, that of the 14-gun sloop &quot;Marquis de Seignelay&quot;, on 12 November 1782.

===First Fleet===
When the preparation of the First Fleet was in progress, Lord Howe, by then first lord of the admiralty, arranged for Hunter to be promoted to post captain on 15 December 1786, and appointed to command . The fleet was under the overall command of Commodore Arthur Phillip who was going out to find and be governor of the new colony of New South Wales. Hunter carried a dormant commission as successor to Phillip if he should have died or was absent.

==Explorations around Australia and Tasmania==
The expedition arrived in Port Jackson in January 1788. Hunter led an expedition to explore the Parramatta River early in 1788. This expedition explored and made soundings as far as Iron Cove, Five Dock Bay and Hen and Chicken Bay on the Parramatta River. The Sir William Dixson Research Library at the State Library of New South Wales holds the original copy of the chart of the expedition, entitled &quot;Chart of the coasts and harbours of Botany-Bay, Port-Jackson and Broken-Bay, as survey&#x27;d by Capt.n John Hunter of H.M.S. Sirius&quot;. The expedition was significant because it may have marked the first contact to take place between the British and the Indigenous people of the land, the Wangal Clan, in 1788. William Bradley&#x27;s log says that this contact took place while Hunter was having breakfast and is remembered in the name of the suburb, Breakfast Point.

Hunter was ordered to the Cape of Good Hope for supplies in October 1788. He sailed around Cape Horn to the Cape of Good Hope, and from there back to New South Wales in May 1789, thus circumnavigating the globe. The voyage was made more difficult by leaky state of the ship, which rendered continual pumping necessary. &quot;Sirius&quot; was then refitted and sent to Norfolk Island with a large party of convicts, but was caught in a violent storm while anchored there. She was driven onto a coral reef and wrecked. A number of the crew returned to Port Jackson aboard the brig , the remainder, including Hunter, waited for nearly a year on the island before being taken off. Hunter and some of his men returned to England aboard the chartered Dutch vessel &quot;Waaksamheyd&quot; after a long and arduous voyage. Finally arriving at Portsmouth in April 1792, Hunter was court-martialled for the loss of the &quot;Sirius&quot; but was honourably acquitted. Hunter then prepared for publication his interesting &quot;An Historical Journal of the Transactions at Port Jackson and Norfolk Island, With the Discoveries That Have Been Made in New South Wales and the Southern Ocean Since the Publication of Phillip&#x27;s Voyage&quot;, published at the beginning of 1793. An abridged edition appeared later in the same year. In the first edition of this work is found the earliest reference to the possibility of there being a strait between the mainland and Tasmania. On page 126 Hunter says: &quot;There is reason thence to believe, that there is in that space either a very deep gulf, or a straight, which may separate Van Diemen&#x27;s Land from New Holland.&quot;

The French Revolutionary Wars having broken out during Hunter&#x27;s time in England, he went to sea again as a volunteer aboard the 100-gun , the flagship of his old patron Lord Howe. Hunter was present at the Glorious First of June on 1 June 1794, and remained in the ship until 1795. With Arthur Phillip&#x27;s resignation from the governorship of New South Wales in July 1793, Hunter had applied for the position in October and was appointed governor in January 1794. Various delays occurred, and it was not until February 1795 that he was able to sail. Hunter arrived at Sydney on 7 September 1795 on HMS &quot;Reliance&quot; and took up the office of governor on 11 September 1795.

==Governorship==
Hunter&#x27;s difficulties began before he arrived back in Sydney. Phillip left the colony in 1793, at the end of his term as governor, and for the following two years the military were in complete control. During the lieutenant-governorship of Francis Grose, who unmercifully exploited the convicts, a great traffic in alcoholic spirits sprang up, on which there was an enormous profit for the officers concerned. They had obtained the control of the courts and the management of the lands, public stores, and convict labour. Hunter realised that these powers had to be restored to the civil administration, a difficult task. And in John Macarthur he had an opponent who would ruthlessly defend his commercial interests. Hunter found himself practically helpless. A stronger man might have sent the officers home under arrest, but had Hunter attempted to do so he likely would have precipitated the rebellion which took place in William Bligh&#x27;s time. Anonymous letters were even sent to the home authorities charging Hunter with participation in the very abuses he was striving to prevent. In spite of Hunter&#x27;s vehement defence of the charges made against him, he was recalled in a dispatch dated 5 November 1799 from the Duke of Portland, one of the three secretaries of state. Hunter acknowledged this dispatch on 20 April 1800, and left for England on 28 September 1800, handing over the government to Lieutenant-Governor Philip Gidley King. When Hunter arrived he endeavoured to vindicate his character with the authorities but was given no opportunity. Hunter was obliged to state his case in a long pamphlet printed in 1802, &quot;Governor Hunter&#x27;s Remarks on the Causes of the Colonial Expense of the Establishment of New South Wales. Hints for the Reduction of Such Expense and for Reforming the Prevailing Abuses&quot;, which has become a valuable document in early Australian history.

Hunter explored and opened up the country near Sydney, and also encouraged the explorations of Matthew Flinders and George Bass. A contemporary, midshipman Daniel Southwell described Hunter as &quot;devoid of stiff pride, most accomplished in his profession, and, to sum up all, a worthy man.&quot; But the circumstances in which he was placed made it very difficult for him to be completely successful as a governor. As his successor Philip Gidley King said, his conduct was &quot;guided by the most upright intentions&quot;, and he was &quot;most shamefully deceived by those on whom he had every reason to depend for assistance, information, and advice.&quot; Of his sojourn in the colony Hunter said that he &quot;could not have had less comfort, although he would certainly have had greater peace of mind, had he spent the time in a penitentiary&quot;. His service as Governor was ultimately recognised through the grant of an annual pension of £300, approved by then-Prime Minister Henry Addington in October 1802.

Hunter continued his interest in Australia long after he left it, and the suggested reforms in his pamphlet were of much value. When the platypus was first seen by Europeans in 1798, a pelt and sketch were sent back to the United Kingdom by John Hunter.

==Later life and legacy==

In summer 1804 Hunter was given command of the 74-gun , serving with the fleet off Brest under Admiral William Cornwallis. While sailing out of Torbay on the evening of 24 November, a sudden fog came down. The ships of the fleet, unaware of each other&#x27;s positions and their own location became disorganised. Hunter twice narrowly avoided colliding with other ships, but ran aground at 8pm on the cliff near Paignton, and soon afterwards bilged. A gale then struck the area, and with &quot;Venerable&quot; fast going to pieces, her crew were evacuated with little loss by HMS &quot;Impetueux&quot;. Hunter again underwent a court-martial, and was again fully acquitted.

Hunter was promoted to rear-admiral on 2 October 1807, and then to vice-admiral on 31 July 1810 but never hoisted his flag at sea. Vice-Admiral John Hunter spent his final years in his home town of Leith, living at 6 Cassels Place. He died at his London home at Judd Street, New Road, Hackney, London on 13 March 1821. His tomb can be seen in the churchyard of St John-at-Hackney.

The Hunter River and Hunter Valley north of Sydney are both named after him, as is the suburb of Hunters Hill in Sydney, and the John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle. In 1986 he was honoured on a postage stamp depicting his portrait issued by Australia Post. HMAS &quot;Hunter&quot; the lead ship of the new &quot;Hunter&quot;-Class frigates of the Royal Australian Navy is named after him. The &quot;Hunter&quot; was laid down in 2023 and is expected to be commissioned in 2031.

He retired to his home town of Leith and lived at a then-new Georgian house at 5 Cassels Place, part of the still extant Georgian terrace at the foot of Leith Walk, and now renumbered as 34 Leith Walk.

==Memorials==

A bust of Hunter was placed by the Australian government at the north end of The Shore in Leith in 1996.

<doc id="297689" wikidata="Q3990712" url="?curid=297689" title="Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex">
<text>Thomas Radclyffe (or Ratclyffe), 3rd Earl of Sussex KG (c. 15259 June 1583), was Lord Deputy of Ireland during the Tudor period of English history, and a leading courtier during the reign of Elizabeth I.

== Family==
He was the eldest son of Henry Radclyffe, 2nd Earl of Sussex, and his first wife Elizabeth Howard. His maternal grandparents were Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk, and his second wife, Agnes Tilney.

His maternal uncles included, among others, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk and Lord Edmund Howard (father of Queen Katherine Howard); Sir Edward Howard; Lord William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham; and Lord Thomas Howard. His aunt, Elizabeth Howard, Lady Boleyn, was the mother of Queen Anne Boleyn.

== Early life ==
He was born about 1525, and after his father&#x27;s succession to the earldom in 1542 was styled Viscount Fitzwalter. After serving in the army abroad, he was employed in 1551 to negotiate a marriage between King Edward VI of England and a daughter of Henry II of France. Radclyffe&#x27;s prominence in the kingdom was shown by his inclusion among the signatories to the letters patent of 16 June 1553 settling the crown on Lady Jane Grey as Edward&#x27;s successor.

Nevertheless, he won favour with Queen Mary, who employed him in arranging her marriage with Philip II of Spain. As a reward, Philip gave him three diamonds, two rubies, and a sword. Mary created him Baron Fitzwalter in August 1553.

== Sussex in Ireland ==
Returning to England from a mission to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, in April 1556, Fitzwalter was appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition&quot;, the &quot;prevailing anarchy in Ireland, a country which, nominally subject to the English Crown, was torn by feuds among its practically independent native chieftains, rendered the task of the lord deputy one of no ordinary difficulty; a difficulty that was increased by the ignorance of English statesmen concerning Ireland and Irish conditions, and by their incapacity to devise or to carry into execution any consistent and thorough-going policy for bringing the half-conquered island under an orderly system of administration.&quot;

Fitzwalter effected Queen Mary&#x27;s policy for Ireland: the reversal of the partial attempts that had been made during the short reign of Edward VI to promote Protestantism there, the &quot;plantation&quot; by English settlers in the midlands and the shiring of King&#x27;s County and Queen&#x27;s County in 1556, named after Mary and her husband Philip. But before Fitzwalter could attend to such matters he had to make an expedition into Ulster, which was being kept in a constant state of disturbance by the Highland Scots from Kintyre and the Islands who were making settlements along the Antrim coast in the district of the &quot;Glynnes&quot; (now known as the Glens of Antrim), and by the efforts of Shane O&#x27;Neill to dominate more territory in Ulster. Brutal methods were deployed, as Sussex sent the earl of Ormond, Sir Nicholas Bagenal and other captains to Rathlin Island on 3 September 1557. They stayed for three days and hunted down the occupants of the island, and it was noted that they killed &#x27;as many as they might come by or get out of caves, both man, woman, child and beasts&#x27;.

Having defeated O&#x27;Neill and his allies, the MacDonnells, the lord deputy, who by the death of his father in February 1557 became Earl of Sussex, returned to Dublin, where he summoned a parliament in June of that year. Statutes were passed declaring the legitimacy of Mary I of England as Queen of the Kingdom of Ireland, reviving the laws for the suppression of heresy and forbidding the immigration of Scots. Having carried this legislation, Sussex endeavoured to give forcible effect to it, first by taking the field against Donough O&#x27;Conor, whom he failed to capture, and afterwards against Shane O&#x27;Neill, whose lands in Tyrone he ravaged (causing artificial famine by the burning of crops and killing of livestock), restoring to their nominal rights the Earl of Tyrone and his reputed son Matthew O&#x27;Neill, Baron of Dungannon. In June of the following year Sussex turned his attention to the west, where the head of the O&#x27;Brien clan had ousted his nephew Conor O&#x27;Brien, Earl of Thomond, from his possessions, and refused to pay allegiance to the Crown; he forced Limerick to open its gates to him, restored Thomond, and proclaimed The O&#x27;Brien a traitor.

In the autumn of 1558 the continued inroads of the Scottish islanders in the Antrim glens called for drastic treatment by the lord deputy. Sussex sailed from Dublin in the &quot;Mary Willoughby&quot; to Campbeltown Loch on the Kintyre peninsula. He burnt farms and houses including Saddell, a castle of James MacDonnell or MacDonald of Dunyvaig and Glynnes (died 1565), and then marched south to burn Dunaverty and Machrimore. He then burnt farms on the islands Arran, Bute, and Cumbrae. Landing at Carrickfergus, he fired and plundered the settlements of the Scots on the Antrim coast before returning to Dublin for Christmas. 

In the metropolis, the news reached him of the queen&#x27;s death. Crossing to England, he took part in the ceremonial of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s coronation in January 1559; and in the following July, he returned to Ireland with a fresh commission, now as lord lieutenant, from the new queen, whose policy required him to come to terms if possible with the troublesome leaders of the O&#x27;Neills and the MacDonnells. Shane O&#x27;Neill refused to meet Sussex without security for his safety, and having established his power in Ulster he demanded terms of peace which Elizabeth was unwilling to grant. Sussex failed in his efforts to bring Shane to submission, either by open warfare or by subterfuge.

He was preparing for a fresh attempt when he was superseded by Gerald FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Kildare, who was commissioned by Elizabeth to open negotiations with O&#x27;Neill, the result of which was that the latter repaired to London and made a formal submission to the queen. Shane&#x27;s conduct on his return to Ireland was no less rebellious than before, and energetic measures against him became more imperative than ever. Having obtained Elizabeth&#x27;s sanction, Sussex conducted a campaign in the summer of 1563 with Armagh as his temporary headquarters; but except for some indecisive skirmishing and the seizure of many of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s cattle, the operations led to no result and left O&#x27;Neill with his power little diminished. His continued failure to effect a purpose for the accomplishment of which he possessed inadequate resources led Sussex to pray for his recall from Ireland, and his wish was granted in May 1564. His government of Ireland had not, however, been wholly without fruit.

== Sussex the politician ==
Sussex was the first representative of the English Crown who enforced authority to any considerable extent beyond the limits of the Pale; the policy of planting English settlers in Offaly and Leix was carried out by him in 1562 with a certain measure of success; and although he fell far short of establishing English rule throughout any large part of Ireland, he made its influence felt in remote parts of the island, such as Thomond and the Glynnes of Antrim, where the independence of the native septs had hitherto been subjected not even to nominal interference. His letters from Ireland display a just conception of the problems with which he was confronted, and of the methods by which their solution should be undertaken; and his failure was due, not to lack of statesmanship or of executive capacity on his own part, but to the insufficiency of the resources placed at his command and want of insight and persistence on the part of Elizabeth and her ministers. He also had to contend with the hostility of certain highly placed officials in the Dublin administration, led by John Parker, the Master of the Rolls in Ireland. Parker, a strong Protestant and English by birth, accused Sussex of having Roman Catholic sympathies, a charge to which Sussex was clearly vulnerable in light of his loyal service to Queen Mary in her efforts to stamp out heresy in Ireland.

== Sussex as courtier ==
On his return to England, Sussex, who before leaving Ireland had to endure the indignity of an inquiry into his administration instigated by his enemies and led by John Parker, threw himself into opposition to Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, especially in regard to the suggested marriage between Leicester and the queen. He does not appear to have incurred Elizabeth&#x27;s displeasure, for in 1566 and the following year she employed him in negotiations for bringing about a different matrimonial alliance which he warmly supported, the proposal that she should bestow her hand on the Archduke Charles. When this project failed, Sussex returned from Vienna to London in March 1568, and in July he was appointed Lord President of the North, a position which threw on him the responsibility of dealing with the rebellion of the Northern Earls of Northumberland and Westmorland in the following year. The weakness of the force at his disposal rendered necessary at the outset a caution which engendered some suspicion of his loyalty, and this suspicion was increased by the counsel of moderation which he urged upon the queen; but in 1570 he laid waste the border, invaded Scotland, and raided the country round Dumfries, reducing the rebel leaders to complete submission.

In July 1572 Sussex became Lord Chamberlain, and he was henceforth in frequent attendance on Queen Elizabeth, both in her progresses through the country and at court, until his death. Elizabeth I came to his house New Hall in September 1579. She was greeted by a theatrical entertainment of Jupiter and a thunderstorm. The next day there was jousting, and a pageant of a sleeping knight, which the Queen revived. The Earl of Sussex gave Elizabeth a white palfey horse, a cloak, and a safeguard &quot;to keep her from evil weather that might hap&quot; in the next day&#x27;s hunting.

==Family==
He married twice: first to Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton; and secondly to Frances, daughter of Sir William Sidney of Penshurst. His second wife, Frances, was the foundress of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, which she endowed by her will, and whose name commemorates the father and the husband of the countess. The Earl left no children, and at his death, his titles passed to his brother Henry Radclyffe, 4th Earl of Sussex.

<text>Charles Henry Cooper (20 March 1808 – 21 March 1866) was an English antiquarian.

==Life==
Born at Marlow, Buckinghamshire, he was descended from a family formerly of Bray in Berkshire. He was privately educated in Reading. In 1826 he settled in Cambridge, and in 1836 was elected coroner of the borough. Four years later he qualified as a solicitor, and in time acquired an extensive practice, but he began to devote almost the whole of his time to antiquarian research — especially on the history of the University of Cambridge.

In 1849 he resigned as borough coroner when he was elected to the post of town clerk, which he retained till his death.

He is buried in the Mill Road cemetery, Cambridge.

==Works==
His earliest work, &quot;A New Guide to the University and Town of Cambridge&quot;, was published anonymously in 1831. The &quot;Annals of Cambridge&quot; followed (1842–1853), being a chronological history of the university and town from the earliest period to 1853. His most important work, the &quot;Athenæ Cantabrigienses&quot; (1858, 1861), a companion work to the famous &quot;Athenæ Oxonienses&quot; by Anthony Wood, contains biographical memoirs of the authors and other men of eminence who were educated at the University of Cambridge from 1500 to 1609.

Cooper&#x27;s other works are &quot;The Memorials of Cambridge&quot;, (1858–1866) and a &quot;Memoir of Margaret, Countess of Richmond and Derby&quot; (1874). He was a frequent contributor to &quot;Notes and Queries&quot;, &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and other antiquarian publications, and left an immense collection of manuscript materials for a biographical history of Great Britain and Ireland. His eldest son, Thompson Cooper (1837-1904), was a journalist and &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; contributor.

<doc id="297696" wikidata="Q211970" url="?curid=297696" title="Entebbe">
<text>Entebbe is a city in Central Uganda which is located on Lake Victoria peninsula, approximately southwest of the Ugandan capital city, Kampala. Entebbe was once the seat of government for the Protectorate of Uganda prior to independence, in 1962. The city is the location of Entebbe International Airport, Uganda&#x27;s largest commercial and military airport, which gained worldwide attention in 1976 Israeli rescue of 100 hostages kidnapped by the militant group of the PFLP-EO and Revolutionary Cells (RZ) organizations. Entebbe is also the location of State House, the official office and residence of the President of Uganda.

==Etymology==
The word came from Luganda language &quot;e ntebe&quot; which means &#x27;seat&#x27; / &#x27;chair&#x27;. Entebbe was a cultural site for the Mamba clan and it was called &quot;entebbe za Mugula&quot; - Mugula was the title of a chief of a subdivision of the Mamba clan - and is now the location of the official office and residence of the President of Uganda, as it was for British governors before independence. Entebbe was the former seat of power in the country, but has now been replaced by Kampala.

==Location==
Entebbe sits on the northern shores of Lake Victoria, Africa&#x27;s largest lake. The town is situated in Wakiso District, approximately south of Kampala, Uganda&#x27;s capital and largest city. The metropolis is located on a peninsula into Lake Victoria, covering a total area of , out of which is water. The coordinates of Entebbe are:0°03&#x27;00.0&quot;N, 32°27&#x27;36.0&quot;E (Latitude:0.0500; Longitude:32.4600). Neighborhoods within Entebbe City include Bugonga, Katabi, Nakiwogo, Nsamizi, Kitooro, Lunnyo and Lugonjo.
==Population==
During the 2002 national census, Entebbe&#x27;s population was estimated at 55,100 people. In 2010, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) estimated the population of the town at 76,500. In 2011, UBOS estimated the population of Entebbe at approximately 79,700. On 27 August 2014, the national population census put Entebbe&#x27;s population at 69,958.

==History==
&quot;Entebbe&quot;, in the local Luganda language, means a &quot;seat&quot; and was probably named that because it was the place where a Baganda chief sat to adjudicate legal cases. It first became a British colonial administrative and commercial centre in 1893 when Sir Gerald Portal, a colonial Commissioner, used it as a base. Port Bell went on to become Kampala&#x27;s harbour. Although no ships dock there now, there is still a jetty, which was used by Lake Victoria ferries.

Entebbe International Airport, the main international airport of Uganda, has been the site of some well known events, making it famous in Europe and abroad. It was from this airport that Queen Elizabeth II departed Africa to return to England in 1952 when she learned of her father&#x27;s death and that she had become Queen. The airport was the scene of Operation Entebbe, a hostage rescue on 4 July 1976, when soldiers from the Sayeret Matkal, Paratroopers Brigade and Golani Brigade units of the Israeli Army freed over 100 hostages following a hijacking by a group of Palestinian and German militia.

The city of Entebbe also hosted final resolution talks to end the M23 rebellion.

==Biomedical research hub==

Entebbe is home to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI), a Ugandan government organization which provides space to conduct research to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative HIV vaccine program, the UK Medical Research Centre Laboratories (MRC), the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Most research performed at UVRI is infectious disease-oriented and focuses on HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and helminth infections. It is also home for the headquarters of Uganda National Medical Stores, until the new headquarters and main warehouse building in Kajjansi is completed, then the headquarters will relocate to Kajjansi.

==Tourist attractions==

<doc id="297698" wikidata="Q82193" url="?curid=297698" title="Trinitarian formula">
<text>The Trinitarian formula is the phrase &quot;in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit&quot; (; ), or words to that form and effect, referring to the three persons of the Christian Trinity. It is often followed by an &quot;amen&quot;.

The Trinitarian formula is used in baptism as well as in numerous prayers, rites, liturgies, and sacraments. One of its most common uses apart from baptism is when Roman Catholics, Eastern and Oriental Orthodox, Lutherans, Anglicans, Methodists, and others make the sign of the cross while reciting the formula.

==Biblical origin==

These words are quoted from a command of the risen Jesus in the Great Commission: &quot;Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in
 the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit&quot; (Matthew 28:19).

The formula is mentioned in the Didache (7:1-3), and it is mostly accepted as authentic due to its supporting manuscript evidence.
Nevertheless, some scholars have held the view that the passage is an interpolation as it is absent from the first few centuries of early Christian quotations, in which case it would be part of an apostolic or early Christian oral tradition from which both the received texts of Matthew and the Didache emerged.
The view of the passage as an interpolation was in recent times maintained by the Jesus Seminar, a nontrinitarian movement active in the 1990s. Critics of the Jesus Seminar described this particular line of argument as eisegesis based on a preconceived conclusion.

==Use in baptism==
According to the doctrines of Roman Catholicism, Oriental Orthodoxy, Eastern Orthodoxy, and most forms of Protestantism, such as Lutheranism, Calvinism and Anglicanism, a baptism is not valid unless the Trinitarian formula is used in the administration of that sacrament. Consequently, they may not recognize religious communities that baptize without this formula – &quot;e.g.,&quot; Unitarians, Branhamists, Frankists, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and Oneness Pentecostals, all of whom deny the Trinity – as Christian religions. This is also the case with baptisms within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS church). Although LDS members baptize with the same Trinitarian formula, they reject the Nicene Trinitarian conception and regard the three persons of the Trinity as being distinct personages united not in substance, but in dominion and purpose.

Baptism according to the Trinitiarian formula is seen as being a basis for Christian ecumenism, the concept of working towards the eventual unity of Christians belonging to different Christian denominations.

<doc id="297700" wikidata="Q5024122" url="?curid=297700" title="Calvagh O'Donnell">
<text>Calvagh O&#x27;Donnell (; 26 October 1566), eldest son of Manus O&#x27;Donnell, was an Irish King of Tyrconnell of the mid-16th century. He was king and chief of the O&#x27;Donnell dynasty based in Tyrconnell in western Ulster. He is best known for his conflict with Shane O&#x27;Neill – a dispute that involved the intervention of the English government in Ireland on Calvagh&#x27;s side.

==Life==
Calvagh O&#x27;Donnell was the eldest son of Manus O&#x27;Donnell by his first wife, Joan O&#x27;Reilly. In the course of a quarrel with his father and his half-brother Hugh, Calvagh sought aid in Scotland from the Campbells, who with access to Scottish royal artillery were able to assist him in deposing Manus and securing the now very divided lordship of Tyrconnell for himself.

Hugh then appealed to Shane O&#x27;Neill, chief of the neighbouring O&#x27;Neill dynasty, to restore him at Calvagh&#x27;s expense. Shane accordingly invaded Tyrconnell at the head of a large army in 1557, desiring to make himself supreme throughout Ulster, and encamped on the shore of Lough Swilly.

Calvagh, acting apparently on the advice of his father, who was his prisoner and who remembered the successful night attack on Conn O&#x27;Neill, 1st Earl of Tyrone at Knockavoe in 1522, surprised the O&#x27;Neills in their camp at night and routed them with the loss of all their spoils.

Calvagh had at least two marriages, both reflecting his family&#x27;s alliance with the Earls of Argyll. By 1555, and perhaps as early as 1540, Calvagh was married to a daughter of the 4th Earl of Argyll whose name may have been Janet and who may have been the mother of his son, Conn. By 30 May 1561 Calvagh was married to his last wife, Catherine Maclean, widow of the 4th Earl.
Calvagh was then recognized by the English government as lord of Tyrconnell; but in 1561 he and his wife were kidnapped by Shane O&#x27;Neill in the Franciscan friary of Killydonnell. His wife had previously been the wife of the Earl of Argyll, was kept by Shane O&#x27;Neill as his mistress and bore him several children. Sources differ as to the level of ill-treatment she endured by her captor; as she divorced Calvagh and married Shane immediately upon their release. Calvagh himself was subjected to atrocious torture during the three years that he remained O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s prisoner, complete with being held in a metal cage at the front of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s castle in Dungannon, Tyrone. He was released in 1564 on conditions which he had no intention of fulfilling; and crossing to England he threw himself on the mercy of Queen Elizabeth.

In 1566 Sir Henry Sidney by the queen&#x27;s orders marched to Tyrconnell and restored Calvagh to his rights. On 26 October, in the midst of his cavalry, Calvagh suddenly fell dead from his horse on the public road between Baile-aghaidh-chaoin and the church of Rath. As his son Conn was a prisoner in the hands of Shane O&#x27;Neill, his half-brother Hugh MacManus was inaugurated The O&#x27;Donnell in his place. Hugh, who in the family feud with Calvagh had allied himself with O&#x27;Neill, now turned round and combined with the English to crush the hereditary enemy of his family; and in 1567 he utterly routed Shane at the battle of Farsetmore near Letterkenny with the loss of 1300 men, compelling him to seek refuge with the MacDonnells of Antrim, by whom he was treacherously put to death.

==Descendants==
In 1592 Hugh abdicated in favour of his son Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell; but there was a member of the elder branch of the family who resented the passing of the chieftainship to the descendants of Manus O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s second marriage. This was Niall Garve, second son of Calvagh&#x27;s son Conn. His elder brother was Hugh of Ramelton, whose son John, an officer in the Spanish army, was the father of Hugh Baldearg O&#x27;Donnell (d. 1704), known in Spain as Count O&#x27;Donnell, who commanded an Irish regiment as a brigadier in the Spanish service. This officer came to Ireland in 1690 and raised an army in Ulster for the service of James II in the Williamite war in Ireland, afterwards deserting to the side of William III, from whom he accepted a pension.
